00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,759
Pagalavan...?

2
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,679
Wake up, you!
Wake up, Pagalava!

3
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,560
Good morning, bro

4
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,816
- When did you come here?
- At 4:00 a.m

5
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,985
The door was open
So I came in and slept

6
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,654
Buffalo! Buffalo!

7
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,405
He's gotten drunk and
left the door wide open

8
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,199
What if a thief
had come in?

9
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,744
Why are you here
all of a sudden?

10
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,914
There was a problem
in my home town, Trichy

11
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,207
What problem?

12
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,379
Don't hit him like that...!

13
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,756
Are women so cheap?

14
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,509
Women shouldn't
be so violent?!

15
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,010
Don't hit him

16
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,388
Stop! Stop!

17
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,973
He's my son!

18
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,099
What happened?

19
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,726
You've raised 'venom'
instead of a son!

20
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,061
What did he do?

21
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,732
What did he do?!
Come, see for yourself!

22
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,155
Look... that's what he did!

23
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,544
Don't try and pull
a fast one on me!

24
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,016
Oh gawd! How did you do it?
How much did you spend?

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,603
- 1 and a half lakhs
- 1,50,000?!

26
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,148
You could've invested that
in some proper business, no?

27
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,150
Business?
For what?

28
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,590
Dude... daiiii!

29
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,053
You stinky bugger! Why are you
barging into my time for crapping!

30
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,609
- Are you Masa's friend?
- No, Kesavan's friend

31
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,821

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,459
- I don't know, dude
- Good answer

39
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,170
Those who came clueless
really made it big here

40
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,339
Ones with plans went
back home empty handed

41

You have a bright future, da

42
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,767

00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:02,063
People have started realizing that
even giving bribes is a crime now

70
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,357
Election dates has been
announced yesterday

71
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,527
This is being claimed a publicity stunt
What's your justification?

72
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,947
Only people who don't have publicity
will resort to something like that

73
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,618
I believe I have enough publicity
I don't need all those gimmicks, son

00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,636

Wait... wait
Stop the car

92
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,346
Hi

93
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,140
I said hi

94
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,059
- Love me
- Sorry?

95
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,686
I said 'love me

96
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,937
Love is a pain

97
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,273
We should straight away
go to the next step maybe

98
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,068
Why are you threatening me
while we are talking?

99
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,071
I'll cut my wrists if you don't love me
You'll be blamed for my death

100
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,280
Are you insane?

101
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,866
No... no, don't do it
Listen to me! Don't!

102
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,162
- Let me go
- Stop it! Stop it!

103
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,957
Awwwwwwwwww!

104
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,880
Where do you work, boss?

105
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,677
I set the alarm in the morning,
to get up and drink

106
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,137
How can you ask me this?

107
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,056
No, I thought maybe
you work night shifts

108
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,726
Why do you think so?

109
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,936
Why do you
think that of me?

110
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,147
Is it a must for
everyone to work?

111
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,650
A man must eat and crap daily,
in between, work a little

112
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,776
Isn't this your concept?

113
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,903
- It's not that, boss
- Then what is it, boss?

114
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,075
Always talk about work, work,
work... wretched fellows...!

115
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,618
Why do you
talk like this?

116
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,245
What else do you
want me to say?

117
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,872
Do you read
the paper daily?

118
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,124
They just change the date
and write the same thing

119
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,753
- That's why I don't read it
- That's why... you're happy

120
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,589
Read the paper daily
You'll go insane

121
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,967
Wife-swapping

122
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,260

Jewelry theft

125
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,724
On top of it, actress in an ashram
and a saint lying on her lap

126
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,642
This heroine in love
with a hero

127
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,352
That hero in love
with another heroine...

128
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,563
...who is the mistress
of another director

129
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,025
If isn't enough, youngsters turn into
murderers and even commit suicide

130
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,319
Suicide if they fail
in school or college

131
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:03,531
Suicide if they don't get a job
or the right bride or groom

132
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,951
Suppose, they get a bride
marriage ends in divorce

133
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,997
Divorce for the flimsiest of excuses
Sneeze, cough or even if you snore!

134
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,501
Besides all this mother-in-law burns
daughter-in-law and vice versa

135
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,252
Uncle stabs
his brother-in-law

136
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,212
And vice versa

137
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,380
Throwing acid on
his girl friend's face

138
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,469
If you wade through all this
rubbish and come to the 1st page...

139
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,349
...he'll report the temperature
in Chennai as 110 degrees

140
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,810
Why should a man work, huh?

141
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,521
You work at a 5 star
hotel, don't you?

142
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,649
Who told you?

143
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:42,570
Kesava told me you are a valet
in a 5 star hotel's car park

144
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,906
You could have
told me you knew, no?

145
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,283
I wouldn't have rattled
my philosophy to you!

146
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,285
It's okay
It was fun hearing it

147
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,205
It was jolly?
Huh... huh!

148
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,416
When you go to work,
please take me with you

149
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,211
I haven't ever seen
a 5 star hotel in my life

150
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,465
Do you know
a Jaguar car?

151
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,553
You know it's always
chauffer driven

152
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,474
Because there's always a driver,
we'll never get the joy to park it

153
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,393
But then, one day...!

154
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,229
That single day in my life...!!

155
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,443
'A white color Jaguar car
zoomed in looking right at me'

156
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,613
'Most importantly
it was owner-driven'

157
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,285
'He gave me the car key
I couldn't believe my luck'

158
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,581
'I opened the door
in slow motion'

159
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,292
'I sat inside leisurely'

160
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,544
'Haiiiyo...!
Awesome'

161
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,673
'I caressed the steering wheel
gently and started the car'

162
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,258
'Wow...!'

163
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,302
'Was it a car
I was driving?'

164
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,470
'I was driving
the Almighty Himself!'

165
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:54,225
'Slowly, I weaved my way
and turned... beautifully'

166
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,854
'Car's engine wasn't running
It was floating in mid-air!'

167
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,316
'I slowly parked it gently'

168
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,527
'That's when Mr Saturn turned
his malefic effect on me!'

169
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:09,407
And he said, "when will you ever
get this chance again, start the car"

170
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,245
What did you do boss?

171
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,874
I drove... a soooper round

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,917
A round?

173
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,752
You can't really
call it a round

174
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,588
I went 100 meters
past the hotel gate

175
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,007
- Don't... sir
- You thieving scoundrel!

176
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,343
- Police caught me
- Did you lose your job?

177
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,887
You're being
such a dumbass

178
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,430
Ssss... sorry!

179
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,934
In my family, no generation
has even washed a car

180
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:44,400
I don't mind losing 100 jobs
for creating this family history!

181
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,321
I like your spirit, boss

182
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,491
Naturally, someone who has built
a temple for actress Nayanthara...

183
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,368
...will be on my wavelength!

184
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,207
Hi, dude

185
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,800
What, da?
You've come home early

186
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,053
It's 7:00 p.m now
How is that early?

187
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,847
He usually comes
only after 11:00 p.m

188
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm asking you, no?
You're looking dull

189
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,902
What is it, man?
What happened?

190
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,949
What happened, bro?

191
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,451
Tell me what's upset you

192
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,245
You know what will
happen if I file a case?

193
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,038
Do you know how long
you'll spend in jail?

194
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,373
You're well educated

195
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,835
Forget behaving professionally
Can't you be a civilized human?

196
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,128
You barbarian!

197
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,714
Who on earth gave you
admission in a college?

198
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,134
You study in some junk college
and buy yourself a degree

199
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,636
Then land up in a corporate
set up and give us grief!

200
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,388
Do you know what
work culture is?

201
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,765
Have you never
befriended a girl before?

202
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,559
Is this how
you'll compel a girl?

203
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,269
Why are you ruining
our company's name?

204
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,353
You senseless bum!

205
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,480
Which nitwit appointed you
as the manager?

206
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,190
Baldie, don't give me
that blank look!

207
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,985
Whaaat?!
Lost your job?

208
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,409
Why did you
hit my friend?

209
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,411
Why did you hit him?

210
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,257
Whatever it is,
let us talk it over

211
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,717
Stop this right now

212
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,889
So now we go sell
ourselves for money?

213
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,890
That's your wish

214
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,351
Don't think I'll hesitate to hit you
because this is a public place

215
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,394
Be calm, boss

216
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,021
Why are you
provoking him, da?

217
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,732
It wasn't a big deal
when he lost his job

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,401
Why is he over reacting
because I lost mine?

219
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,029
You had a job
when I lost mine, no?

220
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,489
Now what do
we fall back on?

221
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,575
How do we manage rent, food,
cigarette, drinks and all that?

222
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,952
On top of it,
now a new refugee

223
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,413
Boss, don't call me a refugee

224
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,998
You and your ego!

225
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,376
Not capable of getting
the next plate of food

226
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:19,680
Mistakes... problems very much... do you
at least understand why I messed up?

227
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,934
'I don't know why
you mess up, dear'

228
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:27,230
Is the problem with me then?
Think and tell me

229
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,611
'I thought real hard
but zilch... no problem'

230
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:39,909
Think about it carefully, Shalu
It's our life matter, understood?

231
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,203
'I thought over it
threadbare, sweet heart'

232
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,621
'I don't know'

233
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,833
Hmph... you're a waste figure

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,002
'True, I'm a waste figure'

235
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,679
He's not giving us
balance change, dude

236
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,055
'I don't have change, man'

237
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,307
Who said there's no change?
I will rip him-

238
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,225
Sit... sit down

239
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,686
Wait, he gave me
nuts as change

240
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,065
If anyone says 'change'
once more, I'll kill him

241
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,693
Stop obsessing over it
and feeling bad about it

242
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,154
Last week, a girl
called me 'uncle'

243
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,947
As if I felt bad?!

244
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,829
Whacko!!

245
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,167
Oh my God!

246
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,381
'Honey, we are dead now'

247
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,302
'Let's leave right now'

248
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,554
'Aiyo!'

249
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,940
Did you get my beer
bottle to hit with?

250
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,151
Don't think
you are a hero!

251
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,362
You dare touch our friend?

252
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,864
What's all this sound?

253
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,533
Your guy is ruining
our peace here

254
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,452
Just shut up and drink

255
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:09,790
You have the gall to come to our area
and play judge, we'll rip you to pieces!

256
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,473
(General commotion)

257
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:44,617
"You've been... oh my dear boozer
(st)ripped off your trouser!"

258
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:53,626
"Pulled into a vortex pointless
Hey buddy... you're pant-less!"

259
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,611
What, boss? You don't announce
your arrival with sirens anymore?

260
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,156
Wait for me

261
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,625
Over here
Look here!

262
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,254
Get in... quickly

263
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,217
Sir, thanks a lot

264
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,636
In all fairness
I should be thanking you

265
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,389
If we don't even do this
for each other, then what, sir?

266
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,018
It's 9:50 p.m, they'll close down
the liquor shops, let's zip-zap-zoom!

267
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,867
Boss, I've been wanting to ask you
something for a real long time

268
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,578
Is this your own house?

269
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,750
That's a really tough question
There are a lot of legal problems

270
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,420
Sir, no problem
Don't strain yourself

271
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,214
What, sir?
You run a business?

272
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,510
For a while
I was smuggling

273
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,471
Scent, shoes, laptops

274
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,306
- 'Baby...!'
- Shut up

275
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,600
It got really boring

276
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,935
There was no
job satisfaction

277
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,688
'Baby! Don't trust them... problem'

278
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,234
If you keep working for money
boredom hits you, no?

279
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,153
Do you get
what I'm saying?

280
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,530
'Honey! Don't blabber
to these new guys!'

281
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,158
I told you to shut up
Didn't you hear me?

282
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,202
Do you want me
to spank you?

283
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,872
A woman should
know her place!

284
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,836
Sir? Whom are you talking to?

285
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,547
'You're a total waste piece, man'

286
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,300
I'll murder you
Don't say another word!

287
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,679
'You'll never learn even
if you burn your hands!'

288
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,889
'Go to hell'

289
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,725
Female trouble

290
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,353
Sir, who are you talking to?

291
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,231
Sorry, you guys
don't know her, no?

292
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,440
We have no clue

293
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,569
She's a girl called Shalu

294
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,157
Only I can see her

295
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,327
She's like my girl-friend

296
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,455
She's the only one
I can bare my soul to!

297
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,750
'My fate! I got stuck with
a crazy man like this'

298
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,419
No fears, man

299
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,714
Shalu is a very decent girl

300
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,554
Look at that drawing

301
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,307
She's Shalu

302
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,686
She's really hot, boss

303
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,688
This is a mental disorder, sir

304
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,857
I think you should
consult a doctor

305
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,025
'I'll smash your face
black and blue!'

306
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,154
Wait... cool
Calm down, babe

307
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,739
'Who wants your
random advice?'

308
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,367
'Get out of here, da'

309
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,786
You asked me to
consult a doctor, no?

310
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,455
That's why
she got a little angry

311
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,790
She's slightly
hyper-emotional

312
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,751
'My fate to listen
to these idiots!'

313
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,670
I've already done all that

314
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,382
He gave me tablets
and I took them

315
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,094
But my life was
boring without Shalu

316
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,763
I stopped the medicine

317
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,641
I 'liking it' basically

318
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,602
How did you get
this disease?

319
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,604
What should I do
to get it, boss?!

320
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,646
Shut up!

321
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,857
Sir, we're leaving
I'm late for work

322
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,193
Sir told me
you lost your job?

323
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,655
Leave it, da
He's one of us

324
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,575
You're all 3 in 'no-job'
position right now, no?

325
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,327
'Wretched wasted
mouth-to-feed!'

326
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,496
Are you looking
for some other work?

327
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,456
No, sir... I'm trying
for another job

328
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,790
What about you both?

329
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,585
As if we are that old, sir
Why work already?

330
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,922
Are you also free
and jobless now, sir?

331
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,633
If I tell you what I do,
you'll think I'm insane

332
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,260
No way!
Of course we won't

333
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,887
I'll tell you anyway

334
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,433
I don't know why, but I feel
like sharing it with you guys

335
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,144
My job is...

336
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,732
...what you might
call 'kidnapping'

337
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,695
In Tamil, we call it
'aal kadaththal' (abducting)

338
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,369
All this is your kidnapping
victims list, sir?

339
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:43,207
No... no, this is my study
of how not to kidnap!

340
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,294
What I've done will not
feature in the newspaper

341
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,755
Only if you've messed it up
will it become headlines

342
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,924
Sir, we're late now
We have to leave

343
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,841
Thanks for the drinks

344
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,843
- Come... come, da
- 'Go... go, good riddance!'

345
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,429
- Are you scared?
- No... not at all

346
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,305
Come, da

347
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,310
Hey! I paid for your drinks?
Now I'll pay, you must eat

348
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,829
If you call this 'idly', even
'chutney' won't believe it, da

349
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,080
Shall I ask for the bill?

350
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,582
Okay, sir
We're done

351
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,876
You sit in the car
I'll pay the bill and join you

352
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,896
Do you know how long it's been
since I sat in the driver's seat?!

353
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,442
Where did that man go?

354
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,238
Shall we just take
the car and leave?

355
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,197
Shut up

356
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,409
Let me go!

357
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,453
Silence!
Don't scream

358
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,954
Let me go!!

359
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,206
Start the car

360
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,125
Sir... sir, what are you doing?

361
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,294
Let me go, da

362
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,006
Police are after us
Start the car, da!

363
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,633
Police... awwww!

364
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,469
Start... go... go... go

365
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,431
- What the heck is happening?
- What do we do now?

366
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,766
I don't know

367
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,060
Pull along the kerb here
Let's run for our life

368
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,438
'Rascal! My guy has breathlessly
carried her with great difficulty'

369
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,481
'And you're ruining it!'

370
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,982
They can't hear
what you're saying, silly!

371
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,484
Why is he
on his own trip?

372
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,693
'Then you talk, buffalo!'

373
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,153
Turn right... right... right

374
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,489
- I'm petrified
- Just go somewhere

375
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,907
For heaven's sake, keep quiet

376
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,743
- Kesavan, just listen to me
- Quiet... quiet, please

377
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,162
Shut up... shut up

378
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,790
- 'Ask her for her phone'
- Give me your phone

379
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,541
Let go of her hand, da

380
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,752
Give me the phone!

381
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,131
- 'Call her dad'
- What's your dad's name?

382
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,300
Take out her
handkerchief

383
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,512
It's saved as 'dad'

384
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,430
I won't scream

385
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,141
Please don't stuff that stinky
kerchief into my mouth!

386
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,646
Don't panic or be
foolish, just trust me

387
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,488
Hello?

388
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,199
Sir, we've kidnapped
your daughter

389
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,705
Yes, dad, I'm in a car
They've kidnapped me

390
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,290
- Divya... Divya
- 'Don't panic, don't panic'

391
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,458
Don't panic
Don't panic

392
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,836
'We won't lay a finger
on your daughter'

393
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,213
Don't go to the police
Because we aren't criminals

394
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,840
We're doing this
only with a good intention

395
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,675
Son, please don't do
anything to my daughter

396
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,468
- Please...!
- I'm telling you we won't

397
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,595
But you must not do
anything foolish either

398
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,556
Son, what do you want?

399
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,057
I'm an ordinary
bank manager

400
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,351
How can a bank manager
be 'ordinary'?

401
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,270
Son, I'm a timid person

402
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,605
I didn't complain even
when my bike got stolen

403
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,149
Don't be scared

404
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,525
Be calm, please

405
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,484
Keep driving

406
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,403
Take deep breaths

407
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,613
Yes, nicely

408
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,615
Breathe in... real deep

409
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,452
Okay?

410
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,787
Now tell me, how much
do you earn monthly?

411
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,456
Eh? Monthly salary?

412
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,290
Son?

413
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,208
How much is your
monthly income?

414
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,626
Rs 45,000

415
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,296
Do you have 45,000
now in your account?

416
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,174
Because today is
10th of this month

417
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,341
I have, son

418
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,219
If I take 45,000, can you
manage the rest of this month?

419
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,137
Whaaaat?!

420
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,430
Yes, I can, son

421
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,266
Okay, then go to a nearby ATM
Withdraw Rs 45,000 and wait

422
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,684
I'll call you in 15 minutes

423
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,645
- Don't do anything to my daughter
- Aiyo! We won't do a thing to her!

424
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,522
Just withdraw the money

425
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,232
Ask your dad to
be brave, dear

426
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,652
Dad, don't be scared
Please be brave

427
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,238
Okay, sir?
Okay... okay

428
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,369
(Shalu giggles)

429
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,313
Hello?

430
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,066
- Sir, is the money ready?
- Yes, it's ready

431
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,526
Where should I come, son?

432
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,653
Good day, sir
Hand over that cash

433
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,489
Check if it's right, son

434
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,283
No need, I'll go down and
send your daughter up

435
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,117
Okay?

436
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,369
See you, sir

437
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,899
Here, this is for you
to buy something

438
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,035
Here, your share

439
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,830
Sekar, this is for you

440
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,666
This is your share

441
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,877
This is mine

442
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,715
Boss... how, boss?

443
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,264
If you follow these 5 rules,
kidnapping is truly awesome

444
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,893
1st rule, stay clear
of people with power

445
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,852
No power house

446
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,896
If you choose a rich kid,
you'll be in danger

447
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,564
Unnecessary tension for us

448
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,067
2nd rule: No threats to kill
No unwanted scaring

449
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,945
Because people have watched
enough films not to get fooled

450
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,406
Must not scare them unnecessarily

451
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,408
Rule 3: Affordable ransom money

452
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,285
Not a penny more
Not a penny less!

453
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,455
Or else they will go to the police
And we are buying trouble

454
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:00,584
4th rule: No arms, no harm
No weapons for any reason

455
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,712
Statistics say weapon is the cause
for us to be the corpse

456
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,881
And 5th rule,
most important

457
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,382
If the job gets
goofed up...

458
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,928
...if it's not according to plan,
no shame, just surrender

459
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,305
Heroism... should be zero!

460
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,474
Dai!!

461
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,395
Boss, your spelling for
'kednapping' is itself wrong

462
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,647
Come, dude

463
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,148
Accept you don't understand

464
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,816
Wait... he has just
started himself

465
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,610
No... I complete

466
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,487
These 5 rules cover et al

467
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,405
There's nothing more
to learn beyond this

468
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,032
Boss, when's the next project?

469
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,618
I'll break your teeth... come, da

470
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,870
Hello...?

471
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,376
If you come by 6:00 a.m
tomorrow, we'll all be a team

472
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,420
Otherwise, forget
that meeting

473
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,344
'Honey, how will you cope with
this many insane people?!'

474
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,595
Come out, da

475
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,889
Let's go back!

476
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,433
Are you brainless?
Come with me now

477
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,230
If you go begging just because
you're jobless, you'll get it, huh?

478
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,232
You'll get a job
only if you search

479
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,692
Understand?

480
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,403
You try something too, dude

481
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:13,907
There are supervisor jobs in Ambattur
for those who've got diplomas... huh?

482
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,285
Try and you'll succeed

483
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,830
- Okay?
- Okay...!

484
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,248
Okay

485
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,807
Aiyo!

486
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,895
"Brother... buddy... bro
Pal... comrade... amigo...!"

487
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,606
"Blood brother... bro"

488
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,945
"Come if you want to
Otherwise just go"

489
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:56,450
"Come and be naughty
Or else a non-celebrity!"

490
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:00,871
"No one's compelling you
Don't want to... just go"

491
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:05,250
"Come... you common soul
Or else... out you roll"

492
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,522
Close the door
Move... move

493
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,985
"When jobless, brain dreams
these cunning schemes!"

494
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:36,406
"When twiddling our thumb
deception gains momentum"

495
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,911
"Come if you want to
Otherwise nitwit, just go"

496
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:45,332
"Come and be naughty
Or else a nonentity!"

497
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,711
"Come or go is up to you
Life is how you pursue"

498
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:54,716
"Choice is completely yours
You're not under duress"

499
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:20,992
"A kite with holes can't fly at all
Luck won't land at your porch to call"

500
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:25,372
"A band of 'yes men'meet
and flee in the eye of defeat"

501
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,793
"If you want your job done
plan properly with wisdom"

502
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:34,297
"I'll wedge the dude who advised me
I'll settle down with a job and: -) happily"

503
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,677
"Lady, tell your son... strictly
Better send him along with me!"

504
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:43,098
"Come if you want to
Otherwise cheapo, just go"

505
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,185
- Call your father... contact
- Do you want me to call my folks?

506
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,688
Just pull up
Let's drop him off

507
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,648
Rejected!

508
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:02,159
"Come... you common soul
Or else... stick to your goal"

509
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,705
Hey! Son... hi!

510
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,134
Is this the place?

511
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,094
Yes, this is the place

512
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,182
Dai, why do you
have such a long face?

513
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,641
No reaction for
kidnapping you

514
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,894
Or when we demanded
ransom from your dad

515
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,353
We're scared, right?

516
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,356
'Babe, this kid is
so cute and chubby'

517
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,942
'I adore him
Can't we just keep him?'

518
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,989
What do you want, son?
An ice cream or something?

519
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,744
I'm bored, get me
some magazines?

520
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,206
We've kidnapped him
and he says he's bored!

521
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,293
Dad

522
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,128
My dad's calling

523
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,091
Hello, sir
Yes, it's us

524
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,594
We're here

525
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:03,887
Where?

526
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,307
Just wait and watch

527
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,476
You'll get caught
by the police very soon

528
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,811
Are you planning
to sneak to them?!

529
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,273
I won't sneak, but I'm just
generally making a statement

530
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,525
Why do you say that?
Hit you!

531
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,779
Poisonous little brat

532
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,405
Come

533
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,121
Go straight and take a left
Your dad is waiting for you

534
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,624
- Here, keep this
- No, thanks

535
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,637
Your life is in your hands
I understand this only now

536
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,681
We should make sure
we don't jinx our good luck

537
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,849
We haven't even started yet

538
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,484
Have you been rejected in many
companies before coming here?

539
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,652
Yes, sir

540
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,737
That's because
they've black listed you

541
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,281
- Black list?
- Yes

542
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,950
You must deal with this legally
with your old company

543
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,036
Or it'll be very difficult for
you to get a job... sorry

544
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,163
It doesn't sound
that sad, man

545
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,582
You're over reacting to this

546
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,793
Shut up, da

547
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,213
Fight in your ex-company
We'll fix it for you

548
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,008
'Love, he's heading our way!'

549
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,887
Count me in too
I'll be part of your team

550
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,307
This won't work for you

551
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,268
You need blind
foolhardiness

552
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,312
And cold blooded
intelligence

553
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,981
'Well said, baby... you rock!'

554
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,065
Shut up

555
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,527
This isn't your cup of tea

556
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,823
Buffalo!

557
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,826
I have all that they have

558
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,203
And even more

559
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,165
- Talk for me, da
- That's okay, dude

560
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,583
But why do you
want to do this?

561
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,834
We're earning now, no?

562
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,377
Wait for a while and see

563
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,670
As if you won't get a job

564
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,465
Boss, I'll tell you
one thing for sure

565
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,842
Before I do something,
I think a 1000 times

566
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,053
But once I've gotten in,
I won't back out

567
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,353
Whose phone is that?

568
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,897
Ring tone sounds new!

569
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,400
Boss, it's from your pocket

570
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,569
'And I just now
complimented you!'

571
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,155
I got that chubby kid's
phone here by mistake

572
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,244
Boss, what do we do now?

573
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,916
Go to the pickup spot

574
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,751
Your phone will be
in the dustbin... pick it up

575
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,835
Hello... hello, sir
Don't hang up on me

576
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,463
Listen to me
I didn't call for the phone

577
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,882
- I called for you
- Are you tracing the call?

578
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,844
Even if you asked me to go to
the police, I wouldn't... trust me

579
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,429
Hello?

580
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,140
Hello?
Sir...?

581
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,351
Tell me, what do you want?

582
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,812
No, I like the way
you dealt with the kidnap

583
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,190
Straight forward, intelligent
without harming others-

584
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,608
Come straight
to the point

585
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,486
Okay... sir, I need you
to do a job for me

586
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,447
Sorry, we don't
work for outsiders

587
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,323
Accept our apology

588
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,367
You don't need to, sir
At least listen to my deal

589
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,786
I'll tell you my offer
To take it up or not is your call

590
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,664
But if you agree to meet me,
I'll give you Rs 50,000!

591
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,750
And if you finish this deal
you can get up to 2,00,00,000

592
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,127
'Think it over'

593
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,509
We won't come to see you
You must come here

594
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,402
Why are you blind folding me?

595
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,664
So, Pagalava... what are you
deep in thought about?

596
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,708
When do you plan
to get married?

597
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,209
What's the hurry?

598
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,879
The car looks good
But no mileage at all, da!

599
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,340
I love dinosaurs, boss
lmagine if we saw 1 now!

600
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,676
Nayanthara is my
all time favorite

601
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:16,389
Too much worry ends in hair loss
Just a tablet will do the trick

602
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,857
I asked you to tie his hands
to his back, didn't I?

603
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,401
That's what I did

604
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,071
- Yeah, I can see that
- Hit me anywhere, not my head

605
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,034
But didn't I tie
his hands to his back?

606
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,503
Have we come to the place?

607
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,046
Yeah... yeah... we have

608
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,048
The man who spoke
to me on the phone-

609
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,841
Is sitting opposite you

610
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,884
Hello, sir

611
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,929
Thanks a lot for
accepting my proposal

612
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,097
You said you'd give us
Rs 50,000 for meeting you

613
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,557
I've brought it

614
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,019
Don't strain too much
I'll take it out myself

615
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,320
- What's your name?
- 'Reliable' Kannan

616
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,073
- 'Reliable' Kannan?
- That's my name

617
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,117
Okay, 'Reliable' Kannan
Why did you want to meet us?

618
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,747
I want you to kidnap someone
Same way you kidnapped my son

619
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,665
Why?

620
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,793
To put it simply,
I want revenge

621
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,628
We lost 2,00,00,000, sir

622
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,463
And our business collapsed
thanks to him

623
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,965
He needs to pay for it

624
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,761
- Who is the victim?
- Minister Gnanodhayam's son

625
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,430
1st rule, stay clear
of people with power

626
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,141
lf you choose a rich kid,
you'll be in danger, tension-

627
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,601
Sorry, sir
We can't do this

628
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,479
Why can't we do this?
20 million is not a joke

629
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,939
Be quiet, you don't
know anything

630
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,982
What is it I don't know?

631
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,985
If you keep earning peanuts, you won't
even have money to bail you out

632
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,736
Dai... shut up

633
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,196
Don't be idiots

634
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,116
We're doing this anyway
Might as well strike gold

635
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,118
Kidnapping once a week
Nothing to be proud of!!

636
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,035
Daiiiii...!

637
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,537
Sir, we can't do this
You can leave

638
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,955
Sekar, drop him

639
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,373
Sir...?

640
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,709
Stop it... dumbass

641
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,711
- Don't do that
- Don't fight

642
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,589
You don't have any
kidnapping manners?!

643
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,301
Shut up and
sit down, da!

644
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,434
Now he knows our faces
To agree is the best decision

645
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,685
No need

646
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,896
Sekar, it's fine as long as
he doesn't know where we stay

647
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,148
Let him not
know the way

648
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:34,902
Take right after Koyembedu
Then 3rd left from Nerkundram

649
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,155
Turn right there is the EB station

650
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,657
Left there leads
to Kavimani street

651
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,661
Turn left from the small bridge there
it's the yellow house on the left

652
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,039
1st floor, no?

653
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:52,003
Boss... he has some
supernatural power

654
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,425
- Sekar, ignore him
- Boss, he really is psychic!

655
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,012
Sekar... SEKAR... stop it
You also went with him, no?

656
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,013
Go

657
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,644
Please, sir
Do this for me

658
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,771
I'll be grateful to you
for the rest of my life

659
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,647
Sir, come

660
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,482
I came here
relying on you

661
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,692
Sir... please, sir

662
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,444
Damn this mask!

663
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,571
Please, sir

664
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:23,284
We can't do anything to him
but same time, we can't just sit idle

665
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,704
Why call us over to take a bribe
and then hand us over to the cops?

666
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,541
Sir, what you're doing is wrong
But I appreciate your work-ethics!

667
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,836
What they're doing maybe right
But it stinks of betrayal

668
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,048
My brother's life was ruined
by this betrayal, sir

669
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,300
Please, sir
I trust you

670
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,927
Don't let me down

671
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,891
'Baby, it's time to go
to the next level'

672
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,184
'You're a man, honey'

673
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,477
'Be brave... step forward'

674
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,853
'I'm there for you, no?'

675
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,522
Why don't we try it?

676
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,315
There's rule #5 anyway, no?

677
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,901
'Goof up, own up'
Our escape route

678
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:07,036
Whenever I'm in doubt,
I ask God to decide

679
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,457
Let me toss this
1 rupee coin

680
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,418
If it's heads,
we go ahead

681
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:17,130
Otherwise we forget
'that meeting'... okay?

682
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,590
Pagalava, bring that table

683
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,579
Heads...!

684
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,165
Tell me, in 20 million
what you share?

685
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,251
I don't want a paisa!
Take it all, sir

686
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,130
All I want is that man's disgraced
face hitting the headlines... that's all

687
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,256
What's the boy's name?

688
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,467
His name is
Arumai Prakasam

689
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,679
- Mother?
- Are you hungry?

690
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,848
I'm thinking of
quitting smoking

691
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,642
Didn't I tell you, his planets
are favorable now?

692
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,102
I just want to
start a business

693
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,395
I've become
responsible now

694
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,397
Really?
What business?

695
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,941
Depends on how much
my father is willing to invest

696
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,985
Can I start a college
if it is just 5,00,000?

697
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,570
I can only open
a roadside tea shop

698
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,449
Very true, but be clear
and frank with your father

699
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,743
Then don't both of you
wander around all muddled up

700
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,787
I don't confuse things
It's your husband who-

701
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,996
Ey, Arumai!

702
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,003
I asked you to do something
Did you do it?

703
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,296
No...!

704
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,216
How will you
ever reform?

705
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,093
Pa, I need money
to start a business

706
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,931
1st go earn some
money on your own

707
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,099
Then start a business
with that money

708
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,228
You should be ashamed
to live off your father

709
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,689
How will I get a job
if I'm not a graduate?

710
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,025
Sir, we're late
for the meeting

711
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:05,863
In 7 years he hasn't passed his under-grad
and he wants to start his own business!

712
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,656
Ma?

713
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,490
What?

714
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,618
Father refused me the money
I'm going back to smoking

715
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,744
Hey... dai!

716
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:23,673
This morning alone, he's gone to
7 tea shops, had 12 teas, 18 cigarettes

717
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,217
4 samosas and
2 bread omelet

718
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,971
Then he was in deep thought lying
on the bench in Kodambakkam park

719
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,057
Then again, 4 tea shops,
13 cigarettes and went back home

720
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,017
In between, he ate
'panipuri' in a shop

721
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,562
He's a minister's son, right?
No police or-?

722
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,356
No security
or any such thing

723
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,942
Roams around in
an old TVS 50 moped

724
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,444
We don't need a plan
to kidnap this guy

725
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,821
Just a tea shop will do

726
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,489
'Super, honey
We are ready'

727
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,034
Shall I stop the car here?
Or in the next street?

728
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,578
Let it be here

729
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,664
If we know how he travels,
we can nab him anywhere

730
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,958
Rowdies have started
to take films now

731
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,752
- Who's he?
- Some Koyambedu don

732
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,754
He is called 'Doctor

733
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,381
Doctor?

734
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,842
I don't get it

735
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,388
'Why, hon, is he making
an ass of himself?'

736
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,390
He's mad

737
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,476
- Boss, you know him?
- I do

738
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,146
Keep it inside
We'll deal with it later

739
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,655
You said the minister
won't be at home

740
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,198
100% he isn't at home

741
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,368
His car won't even
be here after 9:00 a.m

742
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,916
You said
he travels alone?

743
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,751
We followed him
only for a day

744
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,086
Start the car
We won't do it today

745
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,838
This plan
no pick up

746
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,185
- Why is that car following us?
- We're traveling in front of them

747
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,020
Both are the same

748
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,730
There's a world of difference

749
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:21,916
Quick... quick
Start the car

750
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,961
Be calm... dumbass
Don't get hyper

751
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,754
Out... faaast

752
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,715
Come soon
Start the car

753
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,593
- What's happening?
- Some other kidnap team!

754
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,220
Something fishy

755
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,013
Keep going...!

756
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,016
Don't stop

757
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,520
Follow them
without their knowledge

758
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,233
Didn't they go this way?

759
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,861
- Yes, this road... go... go
- Here it is... their car

760
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,739
Drive... don't stop

761
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,285
What do we do now?

762
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,787
Go... I'll tell you

763
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,457
Bro, don't we get a gun?

764
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,419
It's automatically part of
the Sub Inspector set

765
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,171
We'll take 1 SI set
and 1 Inspector set

766
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,757
Das brother is Inspector
and I'll be Sub Inspector

767
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,175
You both can
be constables

768
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,552
Why should I be
the constable?

769
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,137
Why are you
behaving like a kid?

770
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,680
Okay, how many of you?

771
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,639
4, bro

772
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:23,894
Then get 1 Sub Inspector set
1 Head constable, 2 Constables

773
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,063
Brother, how many guns
will we get for this?

774
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,231
Just 1

775
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,568
- Total amount?
- Rs 1900

776
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,988
Is this a film
or a serial?

777
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,491
- Fil... m
- Name of the film?

778
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,452
Dummy Police

779
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,274
Check around and see
if anyone's there

780
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,567
Upstairs

781
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,603
- He's alive
- But passed out

782
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,981
So where are
his kidnappers?

783
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,987
'We will tiffen and parsel
food to you and be back'

784
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,243
- How do we wake him up?
- Impossible!

785
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,176
Dude... police

786
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,692
Get into the car... start

787
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,488
Go... go... go

788
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,870
Dai! Kesava...?

789
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,543
Then, you arranged
the previous kidnapping?

790
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,590
How much were you
planning to ask your dad?

791
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,884
Huh?

792
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,265
I'll keep guessing the amount,
you just shake your head

793
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,475
10 million?

794
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,644
20 million?

795
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,356
30 million?

796
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,570
Have you called home as yet?

797
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:24,450
Son, this isn't your plan
anymore, it's ours...!

798
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,577
We intend
asking 20 million

799
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,497
When ransom is 50,000
we tip Rs 1000 or 2000

800
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,084
Since this is 20 million,
I'll tip you 200000

801
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,880
You must stay quiet
and not be a pain... okay?

802
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,216
What?

803
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,177
Angry man...!

804
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,850
Sir... sir?

805
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,644
Good day!

806
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,895
1st let me go in

807
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,313
Only your petition, sir

808
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,023
Sit... sit

809
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,278
Sir do you think you can
win without money?

810
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,906
I believe honesty is
the best policy in politics

811
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,824
With what margin
will you win, sir?

812
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,451
Sir, 1 last question

813
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,204
Sir, according to
Loyola's poll survey...

814
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,957
...this time also
you'll definitely win

815
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,881
Hello? Pull up along
the kerb, please

816
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,924
Why?

817
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,677
Sir, you've got
an important call

818
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,810
Sir, someone has
kidnapped our Arumai

819
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,813
Hello?

820
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,190
Sir, don't be tensed

821
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,653
We've kidnapped your son
but our needs are very limited

822
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,488
Sir?

823
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,409
Sir, don't take any rash
decisions in anger

824
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,910
Please listen
to what we say

825
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,537
We only need
Rs 20 million

826
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,497
Please don't go
to the police

827
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,832
I beg of you

828
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,210
'What, love?'

829
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,713
He cut the line

830
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,384
I was talking to your father
and he hung up on me!

831
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,802
Is that man mad?

832
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,309
Take that off

833
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,812
What did you say?

834
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,647
I said 'watch TV'

835
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,818
'During election time when law
has loosened its iron grip...'

836
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,696
'...a few anti-social elements
have shown their handiwork!'

837
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,698
'I would like to
make my point clear'

838
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,743
'I'll only rescue my son
through proper lawful means'

839
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,494
'And not succumb
to their demands'

840
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,497
'Minister Gnyanodhayam-'

841
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,587
'Let's leave them
and escape, hon! '

842
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,880
'When in danger
it isn't a sin'

843
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,381
- What is this?
- 'What?'

844
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,675
Why are you in
a swim suit now?

845
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,469
He lives life
'king size', da!

846
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:52,097
'You looked tensed
I wanted to de-stress you'

847
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,225
Change your dress please
and don't talk for a while

848
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,609
The minister seems
to be a crazy father!

849
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,778
Untie him and
take his gag off

850
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,950
All we wanted was 20 million
and he's moaning and groaning!

851
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:16,163
If you'd asked for 30 million, he'd have
just ignored you and gone back to work

852
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,124
Finish eating
We'll drop you back

853
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,627
Is 50-50 okay?

854
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,255
You might as well
have asked for 30 million

855
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,258
That won't work now
So we'll have to settle for 20

856
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,095
I get 10 million
and you get the same

857
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,137
Okay?

858
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,599
If you ask, will your
father give it on a platter?

859
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,309
I'll take care of that

860
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,435
Is the deal okay?

861
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,772
Boss, we are 4 of us
You are single

862
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,899
How will 50-50 be fair?

863
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,901
It's only right
to split it 5 ways

864
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,279
I don't hate you guys
That's why I offered 50-50

865
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,906
Otherwise you won't
even get that

866
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:55,577
You ruined my plan and now
like losers, sending me back home

867
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,995
You call that 'talent'!

868
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,957
I should by rights give you
only driver's wages for a day

869
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,418
I was being humane
offering you 10 million

870
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,002
If you want it, take it
Otherwise leave it

871
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,005
Boss, I think
50-50 is okay

872
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,757
I think so too

873
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,009
We're doing it
with his consent

874
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,388
'Didn't I say, honey
you're a real man?'

875
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,306
'Throw the net
and catch the fish!'

876
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,687
Okay, tell me
what your plan is

877
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,870
I'll make the call now

878
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,539
Strangle me when
I give you the signal

879
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,082
Grab like this... got it?

880
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,501
Not to the extent I die but
such that my voice is garbled

881
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,752
Say something

882
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,838
My way is
unique way

883
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,756
That's right
Understand?

884
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,009
Give me a coin

885
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,348
'We should take him
into our team, love'

886
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,766
'What a pro!'

887
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,854
- Hello?
- Hello, call my mother

888
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,023
Wait, son, I'll call her

889
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,112
- Arumai?
- Mother... maaa... maaaa!

890
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,780
Arumai, where are you, dear?

891
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,282
Maaa, forgive me!

892
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,701
Why are you talking like this?

893
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,329
I wanted to hear you
once before I die-

894
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,956
Don't say such things

895
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,754
How sad you were born to
that stupid, cheap, man!

896
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,172
Don't malign
your husband

897
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,509
Mom, please don't stage a protest
in front of the chief minister's house!

898
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,760
My father is a poor soul

899
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,346
Don't do anything like that
even if I die, ma

900
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,722
Don't say all that!

901
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,516
Don't forget me, ma

902
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,187
Order a tea for me

903
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,397
Save him, sir, save him!

904
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,360
Did you get only my son to use as
scapegoat in your political moves?

905
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,322
Save my son, sir
His father is heartless

906
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,910
'Minister Gnanodayam's wife
pleaded for her son's life...'

907
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,914
'...outside the Chief Minister's house
creating a furor amongst the public'

908
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,418
'A lot of women came along to
lament and support her struggle'

909
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:15,842
'Chief Minister has called the minister
to talk about this issue immediately'

910
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,154
I heard your wife is
making waves on TV

911
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,032
Come in

912
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,287
Shut up and just
read the paper

913
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,541
Good day, sir

914
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,834
Sit down

915
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,549
Don't pick up
if he calls again

916
00:59:55,633 --> 01:00:00,137
- Another rep to Delhi...?
- I don't want your stupid ideas!

917
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,348
- Yes, man
- Forgive me, sir

918
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,060
- My wife didn't know... and...
- What did she do wrong?

919
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:11,440
You are not worth a pie!
Why do we have you in our cabinet?

920
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,650
To enhance
our party's image

921
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,652
Even that is now tarnished

922
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:20,282
If there's an election, your wife
will ensure you lose your deposit

923
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,367
She won't go off to
the opposition, will she?

924
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,161
I won't let her do all that

925
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,371
What do you mean
you won't let her?

926
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,790
Always trying to
earn a good name

927
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,709
Your son
has been kidnapped

928
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,587
How does integrity
come into this?

929
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,465
What do we do?

930
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,509
Do you have 20 million
hidden somewhere?

931
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:45,182
No, sir, I swear I've never taken money
from anyone other than my salary

932
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,354
Okay, take 20 million
from the party's funds

933
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,772
Go and rescue your son

934
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:56,109
And don't hit your wife
She'll hit the headlines with it

935
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,570
Sir, I've told the police

936
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,155
They said they'll catch the-

937
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,281
Mad fellow!

938
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,200
Why the police?
To mess it up?

939
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,078
Just pay them off
and get your son back

940
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,329
Understand?

941
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,040
Go

942
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,723
Please drink
some water at least

943
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,774
You've got a call
from them, sir

944
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,819
Do what you want

945
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,572
Hello

946
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,616
Good day, sir, I am your
son's kidnapper speaking

947
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,159
I know... I know
Tell me!

948
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:49,579
We'll tell you when and where to bring
the money and you do so accordingly

949
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,581
We won't work tomorrow
because it's Sunday

950
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,584
But you'll get a call day after
with all the instructions

951
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,211
Just follow it

952
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,922
Be ready with the money and
to leave as soon as we call

953
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,006
And most importantly...

954
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,300
...the boy's mother only
has to bring the money

955
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,593
All conditions apply

956
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,555
You're playing unaware
of your opponent's power

957
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,723
If I ever get hold-

958
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,481
C. Manigandan IPS

959
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:18,859
Hello?

960
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,860
I'm Gnanodayam speaking

961
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,236
I know, tell me,
brother-in-law

962
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,321
He said I should pay him
the ransom money by Monday

963
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,615
He's threatening me on the phone
We need to catch them by then

964
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,826
Your leader has asked
you not to involve the police

965
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,369
And to finish it off simply, no?

966
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,912
What do you
mean 'simply'?

967
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:35,083
You want me to pay them and
beg for my son to be returned?

968
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,003
We aren't saying this
Your leader is

969
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,796
Why should
the news reach him?

970
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,549
If you catch them
why would he bother?

971
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,426
It's your responsibility
to catch them

972
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,845
Listen to me-

973
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,419
Sir, this phone is too small
to put a tracking chip in

974
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,879
Can you catch them or not?

975
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,672
Don't get tensed
Sit down

976
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,425
You've been saying this
for past 4 days, I can't concentrate

977
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,052
Let me do my work
Please sit down

978
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,679
In politics if you want to be upright
you mustn't have a family at all

979
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,432
No problem, you will
be followed by 2 bikes

980
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,644
Plus a car and a jeep
will follow secretly

981
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,646
We've fixed
a GPS in your car

982
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,481
It will point out
exactly where you are

983
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,525
- Understand?
- I'm scared, brother

984
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,778
Don't play with your
nephew's life, brother

985
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,949
Listen, only after you get your son
will the police even come inside

986
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,035
Till then, forget
we even exist

987
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,705
Here, talk to them

988
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,541
Talk

989
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,750
Hello?

990
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,837
Your son is fine
Do you want to talk to him?

991
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,296
Mother, don't mess it up

992
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,881
Arumai! Arumai!

993
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,592
How are you?
Are you safe?

994
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,845
Your son is fine
He's perfectly okay

995
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:13,139
Let me talk to your brother,
Deputy Inspector General of police

996
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,808
He's asking for you!

997
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,268
To me?

998
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:20,021
DIG sir, how many people
are following your sister here?

999
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,984
Look here, I've come here
as her brother, not as a cop

1000
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,529
Sir, cops behave as cops
Family is immaterial to them

1001
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,073
We won't take
any action, understand?

1002
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,783
Sir, do whatever
mess up you want to

1003
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,494
But just send
your sister and the phone

1004
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,705
We'll keep giving directions
to her over the phone

1005
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,540
She must simply follow it
You understand?

1006
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,499
Okay

1007
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,793
Go, don't be scared

1008
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,506
If their call gets cut
don't worry

1009
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,633
They'll call you back
You instruct the driver

1010
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,469
Don't be scared
Start the car

1011
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,264
Careful

1012
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,143
Maintain distance

1013
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,477
Keep following

1014
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,758
- Are you here?
- Yes, I am

1015
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,135
Give it... give it to me

1016
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,054
Come straight inside

1017
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,807
Enter the ground

1018
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,394
Are you there?
What do you see?

1019
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,396
They've covered
something with a cloth

1020
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,315
Walk towards that

1021
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,405
Hurry up... hurry up
Round up the area

1022
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:56,534
Are you near it?

1023
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,869
Yes, I am

1024
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,204
What's happening?

1025
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,374
Sir, madam is standing in the middle
of the ground and looking at something

1026
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,167
Take off the tarp

1027
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,847
Put the bag in
the stand underneath

1028
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,518
Keep it and
move backward

1029
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,512
Money is flying, sir

1030
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,015
What? The money's flying?!

1031
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,559
Is it coming?

1032
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,020
It'll come
Just wait

1033
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,150
On its way!

1034
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,410
Super, da

1035
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,932
Don't mess it up, da

1036
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,601
It's overloaded, I think

1037
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,685
It has stopped!

1038
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,103
Do something

1039
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,940
'Oh God... gone'

1040
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:54,069
Wait... wait, sir
I'll push it down

1041
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,570
What are you doing?

1042
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,906
This is why you mustn't watch
too many Hollywood films

1043
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:58,990
Our guys are
down there, no?

1044
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,200
Close

1045
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,453
Get his dhoti!

1046
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,207
Keep this 100
Give us your dhoti

1047
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,541
Are you guys kidding?

1048
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,668
Take 500
Quickly!

1049
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,003
Here... hold!

1050
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,842
Spread it right

1051
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:27,060
Catch...! Give me
a 'high 5'... yay!!

1052
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:45,829
"What's righteous, what's wrong?
If it's right for you, live it up lifelong"

1053
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:52,001
"What's fine, what's corrupt?
Good drives evil bankrupt!"

1054
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,554
Awesome, sir
We rocked, no?

1055
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:12,355
Boss, you used my 'remote' skill and
you're giving me with just 1 bundle

1056
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,232
There's already
5 of us here, da

1057
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,817
Be happy with
what you got

1058
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,902
Boss, tell him

1059
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,030
Kesava...?

1060
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,578
Thanks, boss

1061
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:33,418
- How are we splitting it?
- What do you mean how?

1062
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,253
We already
settled that

1063
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,548
That's true... but
helicopter plan was mine

1064
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,426
You think you could've got it
this easily without all our help?

1065
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,761
Think about it
Is 50-50 fair?

1066
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,555
We spoke about this
and only then decided

1067
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,391
This isn't right
What is this, Das?

1068
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,018
No need to talk
about it here

1069
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,853
Whatever... let us
go home and discuss

1070
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:55,064
After we go home, you can
take your share and leave

1071
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,199
What are you up to?
Let go of him!

1072
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,077
Run... run

1073
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:22,050
INTERVAL

1074
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,929
Careful of the glass

1075
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,894
Hold him

1076
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,330
Hey! Masa... get up, da

1077
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,084
Shalu... Shalu
Look at your sweet heart!

1078
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,377
Don't go, Shalu!

1079
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:00,588
'I made a mistake, baby'

1080
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,299
- 'Forgive me'
- Don't say that, Shalu

1081
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:08,471
'I don't want to
see you suffer at all'

1082
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,306
'I'm leaving you now'

1083
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,434
I can't survive without you
Please don't go, Shalu... Shalu!

1084
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,645
- Shalu!
- 'You take care'

1085
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,898
Shalu...?

1086
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,154
SHAAAALU!!!

1087
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,133
Boss, what happened?

1088
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:48,428
My Shalu has left me and gone

1089
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,640
It's okay, leave it, boss
Get up now

1090
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,518
- Come, let's go
- No... my Shalu!

1091
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:56,769
Get up

1092
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,480
Get up, boss

1093
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:03,234
Let's go

1094
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,532
Let's leave
before the police land here

1095
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:13,202
- Where's Arumai?
- He has gone to get you a soda

1096
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,079
Why all that fuss?

1097
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,623
You dumbass! He has
scooted with the money

1098
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,750
Come now

1099
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,717
Stop, this is it

1100
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,104
Please eat a little
You've been starving

1101
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,148
Your son will
be home soon

1102
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,858
Eat... please

1103
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,573
Arumai...?!

1104
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,494
Ma, I thought you'd be sad
and you're busy eating here

1105
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,957
God didn't let me down
Eat, son... eat

1106
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,710
God knows how long
they starved you

1107
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,754
Here, let me serve

1108
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,216
Eat lots!

1109
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,803
Ma, the spicy meat balls?

1110
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,848
Oh yes! Keep eating
I'll go and get them

1111
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,077
Eat

1112
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,751
Would you like to eat too?

1113
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:50,383
What guts to stand in front
of the chief minister's house...!

1114
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,885
Where are you going?
Open the door

1115
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,720
Will you open the door or not?

1116
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:57,223
- I'm warning you... open
- What a nuisance!

1117
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,724
Get a plate
Let's eat

1118
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:01,269
She has the gall to go
to my leader's house

1119
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:06,858
'The Minister's son who was kidnapped
4 days ago has finally returned home'

1120
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:12,071
'Minister Gnanodayam claimed he will not
bow down to the wishes of the kidnappers'

1121
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:16,409
'But since the kidnappers are still
roaming around freely, it is presumed...'

1122
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,120
'...they have been paid
their ransom money'

1123
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,165
'Regarding this minister Gnanodayam-'

1124
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,543
Nothing to worry, dad
Just a few bruises

1125
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,046
My reputation has been
ruined trying to save you

1126
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,506
My name is tarnished...!

1127
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,815
- Hey dude...!
- Hi Antony

1128
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,276
Whats up?
What's happening?

1129
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,486
Nothing much, da

1130
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,778
So sad...!!

1131
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,199
Yeah-aaaah!

I'll fly to a great height"

On my hands I walk muddled"

Nickel, dime, quarter, currency"

he is on a spending spree"

1159
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,254
- Hello?
- It's me

1160
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,423
I really want to know
what the heck you're doing

1161
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,508
What do you want me
to do, brother-in-law?

1162
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,344
Are you going to
catch them or not?

1163
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,846
How will I even face anyone
or campaign in public?

1164
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,891
They're not regulars
This is a new gang

1165
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:30,186
It'll only work if they surrender
or if they attempt this again

1166
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,856
There's no use trusting you
There's this inspector in Dindigul

1167
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,691
His name is... yes, Bramma!

1168
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,527
Will you call him to
Madras immediately?

1169
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,448
Why are you silent?

1170
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,325
Not him

1171
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,370
- Why?
- He's a weirdo

1172
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,748
He's always being transferred
Right now he's suspended

1173
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,417
- So?
- He's a psycho

1174
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,711
Just to kill
he became a cop

1175
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,839
It's been years
since he even spoke

1176
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,343
We're thinking of dismissing him
from the department for good

1177
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,971
Then he's the right guy
Hand this case over to him

1178
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:08,182
Listen to me when I say-

1179
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,394
'Dindigul'

1180
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:15,940
Please come out, dear

1181
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:44,779
He's in the restroom
I'll tell him, thank you

1182
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:50,367
Sir, we've both been
transferred to Madras

1183
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,409
You must have
seen the case file

1184
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,247
Kidnappers don't have
a very strong background

1185
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,456
A new team

1186
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,543
We couldn't really
pinpoint their motives

1187
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,087
Starting point
of this case is-

1188
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,841
Look, Mr Bramma, I'm also
professional and strict like you

1189
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:50,302
Except you have
a gun and I don't

1190
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,596
We can't keep giving
the kidnappers time...

1191
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,640
...to do this again
to arrest them

1192
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,894
Sooner you do this, the better
This is election time now

1193
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,439
It'll be good if we can
close this in a week

1194
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,317
Wait, why 1 week?

1195
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,320
Catch them in 48 hours

1196
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,738
Okay?

1197
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,205
He's just getting up
and going without a word?!

1198
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:22,459
He didn't want to waste even 1 minute of
the 48 hours you've given, I suppose

1199
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,507
You said it was a big accident!
There are hardly any injuries

1200
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,009
It's all internal, brother

1201
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,218
Who's next?

1202
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:32,636
No one!

1203
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:37,558
Read the latest in the kidnap
case of the minister's son?

1204
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,684
What happened?

1205
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,477
They've put Bramma onto the case

1206
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,396
Oh! Those guys are
as good as dead then

1207
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,274
Bro, can you give me
the paper for a minute?

1208
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,863
'Police inspector Bramma transferred
from Dindigul to Chennai'

1209
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,698
'He heads the team
to nab the kidnappers'

1210
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:53,741
Who's Bramma, bro?

1211
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:56,952
You resemble Saturn's malefic effect
and don't you know who Bramma is?

1212
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,163
- I don't
- Wait for a week and see

1213
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:03,125
That gang who kidnapped the minister's son
will be confronted by the police

1214
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:08,797
Headlines will be 'Police wounded in
their knee, gang wiped out totally'

1215
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,965
Das?

1216
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,679
Are you talking about
the rowdy who makes movies?

1217
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,474
- Yes
- Is he your friend?

1218
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,313
My elder brother

1219
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,447
What's bothering you?

1220
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,953
Body ache, fever every evening
and I'm unable to sleep

1221
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,792
Open your mouth

1222
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,921
Okay, close

1223
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,804
Go and see this doctor

1224
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,764
If you give him this slip,
he won't take any money

1225
01:22:58,807 --> 01:22:59,807
Okay, doctor

1226
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:00,641
Go now

1227
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,565
What were you saying?

1228
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,111
That party is not abiding
by the agreement, doctor sir

1229
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,196
If you can mediate
it can be settled

1230
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,572
What's the property worth?

1231
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,657
15 million

1232
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,828
Only big shots used to
dabble in real estate earlier

1233
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:25,708
This is what happens if random roadside
chaps and quack-astrologers interfere

1234
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:29,253
Come... this lucky parrot
will foretell your future!

1235
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,589
Hey, aren't you the guy who lures
people into 'Parrot Astrology'?

1236
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,717
- Yes, sir!
- I'll hit you!

1237
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,261
Get out of here

1238
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,139
Stray dogs!

1239
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,349
You and your desire
to get shortcut money

1240
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:46,186
If you step in here saying the word
'real estate', I'll shoot you

1241
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:29,563
- What's your name?
- Pagalavan

1242
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,190
Are you interested in acting?

1243
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:35,778
Have you ever acted in
a school drama before?

1244
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,947
Will you act
if I offer you a role?

1245
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,247
I've been hunting for a guy
like you for 6 months!

1246
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,918
Why were you
looking for me, sir?

1247
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:54,171
You're the hero of the film
I intend making!

1248
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:59,676
This is our film's story

1249
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,178
Listen, carefully

1250
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:04,181
The movie starts
with a wedding

1251
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:07,726
Ends with a divorce
Just 3 days in between

1252
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,645
Film's title...?

1253
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,021
Honeymoon

1254
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:15,776
- How's the title?
- Good, sir

1255
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:24,576
Hey! My beloved brother
Are you still alive?!

1256
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:28,080
'Police inspector Bramma transferred
from Dindigul to Chennai'

1257
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:31,166
What sins did you guys commit
in your previous birth...?

1258
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,335
This guy is chasing you?!

1259
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,213
Brother?

1260
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:38,298
What do we do now?

1261
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:40,384
- Don't do a damn thing
- Okay, brother

1262
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,804
All of you drink, shut and
pass out on your stomach

1263
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,725
If you guys do anything stupid,
as 'forewarned forearmed'...

1264
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,562
...that silent killer will
show-off his skill on you!

1265
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:56,233
In our profession, only those
who zip their lips, live long

1266
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:00,279
- Doctor?
- Tell me, my dear hero

1267
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:04,616
I've thought of a scene for
our film, shall I tell you?

1268
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:09,037
We'll take care of the scenes

1269
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,248
You zip up and stick to
building up your body

1270
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,667
- Okay?
- Okay, doctor

1271
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,335
Das...?

1272
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:19,923
Hey, Das!
I'll find out and tell you

1273
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,675
Let's not do
anything for now

1274
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:22,801
Okay?

1275
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,433
Remind me in the morning
There's a guy called Gilma

1276
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:33,687
We'll tell him this issue
His ears are tuned in always

1277
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:34,938
Okay?

1278
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:48,535
- Hello... who is this?
- Doctor here

1279
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:51,038
Doctor-bro, good morning!
How are you?

1280
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,082
I'm very drunk
Don't bug me with niceties

1281
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,002
- I need you to bend an ear
- For... tell me?

1282
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:59,338
There's someone new
coming to Chennai

1283
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:01,506
Called Bramma
Heard of him?

1284
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,884
Then Chennai is in for
the malefic effect of Saturn!

1285
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:07,221
It'll be good if the people
involved leave town at once

1286
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,098
We'll take care of all that

1287
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,434
You be 'all ears'
in his movements

1288
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,603
This is a risky job, bro
What's the cut?

1289
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:17,064
- How about 5?
- Say 8, bro!

1290
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:22,569
Don't be too greedy
Take 6 and do the job

1291
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:24,112
Okay, bro

1292
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,989
You're taking
a film I heard?

1293
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:29,409
If you give me a small role
you'll be blessed, bro

1294
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,537
I'll keep that in mind

1295
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:35,207
You tune your ear to this job

1296
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,125
- Okay?
- Okay, bro

1297
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:58,021
- What is this, Gilma?
- He started with me, bro

1298
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,524
He didn't leave a single
rowdy in the city

1299
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,096
Sir... sir, I don't know anything

1300
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,057
I swear
Let me go

1301
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,600
Tell me the truth

1302
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,810
You didn't blabber anything?

1303
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,981
Bro, I could handle it
because I was drunk

1304
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:27,069
If I had been sober, for sure
I would have puked it out

1305
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:30,614
Tell me correctly
You didn't mess it up?

1306
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,658
There's no problem as long
as nobody knows this link

1307
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:36,828
But if they know it,
they'll definitely blurt it out

1308
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,955
Sir... sir,
I'll tell you

1309
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,542
It hurts! I'll tell you
everything, sir... sir

1310
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:45,796
Sir, I know a boy
who sells marijuana

1311
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,091
I heard that he knows the guys
who kidnapped the minister's son

1312
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,384
That's all, sir

1313
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,386
I swear I don't
know anything else

1314
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:53,387
Sir...?

1315
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,144
Where are they, son?

1316
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,743
What do you want, sir?

1317
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:37,305
Sir, we've already paid
our dues to the cops

1318
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,433
Daiii, that's Bramma...!

1319
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,193
Sir, arrest us if you want
but don't do any-

1320
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,240
'5 shot dead'

1321
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:59,536
'ln the kidnapping case of the minister's son
another gang's involvement has come to light'

1322
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:02,164
'With more clues
regarding their whereabouts...'

1323
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:06,710
'...the police are confident of nabbing
the culprits within the next 48 hours'

1324
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:12,632
'Those who voluntarily provide
information will be suitably rewarded'

1325
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,637
Boss, shall we just
run off to Bihar?

1326
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,514
We'll deal with this later
Maybe after a year

1327
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,516
We won't be able
to survive in Bihar

1328
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,351
Police have no information

1329
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,439
Otherwise why would
they offer a reward?

1330
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,486
Doctor is calling

1331
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:34,821
Hello?

1332
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,615
Das! Where are you guys?

1333
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:37,324
In my room

1334
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,367
Leave the house immediately

1335
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:40,076
Why?

1336
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,536
Police know where you are

1337
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,455
- Leave now... right away
- That's impossible

1338
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,831
You're not listening to me

1339
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:45,916
Escape at once

1340
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:52,130
- What happened?
- Police

1341
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:56,843
Run... run

1342
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:58,053
Fast

1343
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,854
We don't have time for
sentiments... come now

1344
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:12,817
How did they find out?

1345
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:17,489
Who is this 'Reliable' Kannan?
He has sneaked for this reward

1346
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,911
'Please, sir
Do this for me'

1347
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,996
'I'll be grateful to you
for the rest of my life'

1348
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:27,165
I knew we'd be in this soup
when I heard his name

1349
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,250
The man's a fraud!

1350
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,752
If you look at it fairly,
we're not even guilty in this case

1351
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:33,880
They should
arrest Arumai Prakash

1352
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:37,926
Yes! He planned it all
And he has the money

1353
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,471
We're running around in circles
like our behind is on fire!

1354
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:45,350
If it were me, I'd have
kidnapped him again

1355
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,770
- What did you say now?
- Nothing, forget it

1356
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:53,775
You are bang on!
We are kidnapping him again

1357
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:58,446
Dai... don't

1358
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,032
I'll give you an idea
to get back your lives

1359
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,951
Just surrender

1360
01:33:03,035 --> 01:33:05,453
We'll find a way
to break this case

1361
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:08,248
No... no
We'll try this one time

1362
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,667
If it doesn't work,
we'll all surrender

1363
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,712
- What are you saying?
- Shut up

1364
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:16,965
Just get us a bike and
a car, that's enough

1365
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:21,052
Das, this is really risky

1366
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,387
Trust me

1367
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,223
We've taken risks like this
before and come out of it

1368
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:27,017
Just arrange this for us

1369
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:36,026
Keep this for safety

1370
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,754
Sir, everything that happened
that day seems like a dream

1371
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:57,505
I was unconscious half the time

1372
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,675
Someone would hit me with
a wooden stick... I'd faint

1373
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,636
They didn't even feed me, sir

1374
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,139
It was a pitch dark room
They had holed me inside that

1375
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:09,601
They'd cover my face with a mask
whenever they took me out of the room

1376
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,978
It was definitely in the city

1377
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:16,524
But I'm not sure
I heard cows moo

1378
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,402
What is that noise?

1379
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,574
- What's the sound?
- Nothing, ma

1380
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:28,536
Son, don't you
read the papers?

1381
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:31,915
Gang that 1st kidnapped you
confessed everything

1382
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,042
It's your turn to
tell the truth now

1383
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:36,961
I swear I don't know anything, sir

1384
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,305
You know
what this card means?

1385
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:53,645
Good for you if you
confess by 6:00 p.m

1386
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:24,384
Das, start the car
Start it... move fast

1387
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:28,638
Don't look at his jeep
Just be casual

1388
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,487
I forgot the matchbox, sir

1389
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:36,706
He's looking our way
End of our story!

1390
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:39,042
Just stay calm... quiet

1391
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:16,454
"You've been... oh my dear
(st)ripped off your trouser!"

1392
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:25,004
"Pulled into a vortex pointless
Yes, my love... you're pant-less"

1393
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:54,742
"Your pants are off!
Your game is up!!"

1394
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,042
He's catching up

1395
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:04,878
Go fast... faaaast... faster

1396
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,547
- Left... left... left!
- Hey, No! Right!

1397
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,966
This is a dead end...!

1398
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,032
Sir, don't do anything here

1399
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:35,909
Residential area

1400
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:45,919
Get down
Get down now

1401
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,337
Sir... sir

1402
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:49,505
We are not worth
your 'encounter'

1403
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,299
We know everything

1404
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,353
'Keep this for safety'

1405
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,917
I'm holding a gun to your face
and you're sneering at me!

1406
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:38,846
Sorry

1407
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:52,735
Get out... get out!

1408
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:55,780
You can pick up your car
at Nungambakkam station

1409
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:57,949
Go... start

1410
01:40:19,638 --> 01:40:23,683
Just buy me
a beer, you guys

1411
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:27,812
2 more minutes

1412
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:30,273
We get the bottles
and leave at once

1413
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,238
How many times
will you call?

1414
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,033
I saw it... the black car, right?

1415
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:44,370
I'm coming

1416
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:55,089
Come... come
Get him!

1417
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,341
Get inside

1418
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,927
Start the car

1419
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,264
Keep moving

1420
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,683
How long do we wait?
What happened?

1421
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,769
Wait, the boy is coming

1422
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,188
What is this?

1423
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:13,566
Like an interrogation scene
from Captain Vijaykanth's film

1424
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,693
What did you
tell the police?

1425
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:17,445
Shall I tell you the truth?

1426
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:20,907
If you guys had told my father
I ran off with the money...

1427
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:23,576
...he'd have forgiven you
and locked me up instead

1428
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,952
But you didn't

1429
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:27,413
And you kidnapped me again

1430
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,832
Even God can't save you now

1431
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,627
And that psycho Inspector
Bramma is here too

1432
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:34,504
I don't know how
you'll get away from him

1433
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:37,590
We'll take care of that
What did you tell the police?

1434
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:38,716
I didn't breathe a word

1435
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,594
- You didn't tell Bramma a thing?
- I swear, I didn't

1436
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,846
- Then where's the money?
- With me only

1437
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,308
Even yesterday, I thought to myself
if you survived 'Bramma', then...

1438
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,019
...I must give you guys
50-50 as agreed

1439
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:54,649
Okay

1440
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:57,527
Promise us something
and we'll let you go

1441
01:41:57,569 --> 01:41:58,778
Promise what?

1442
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:03,324
Promise us that you'll not
tell the cops anything about us

1443
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:10,081
I swear on my father's life
I won't tell the cops a thing

1444
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:12,959
You can leave now

1445
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:15,503
I can leave?
Just like this?

1446
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:16,504
Yes

1447
01:42:17,172 --> 01:42:20,216
Not blindfolded, I'll know exactly
where you guys are... is that okay?

1448
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,342
It's fine

1449
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:27,140
You're being very careless
Watch your back

1450
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:41,195
'I swear on my father's life
I won't tell the cops a thing'

1451
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:47,034
You immediately go and
make 5 copies of the tape

1452
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:53,457
1 for you, 1 for the police, 1 for
the minister and 1 for the press

1453
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:57,378
Then see how the govt.
shuts this case down

1454
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:58,629
I know a place

1455
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:00,590
We can take as many
copies as we want

1456
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:02,008
Then why are you
wasting time?

1457
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,134
Go quickly

1458
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:07,430
I thought of a scene
for our doc-bro's story

1459
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:11,142
- With oranges
- Oranges?

1460
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,518
What scene?

1461
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:15,980
I need to tell
the director first

1462
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:19,150
We're not free enough to
discuss scenes right now

1463
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:20,401
Close...!

1464
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:23,821
Boss, you're thinking about
whether we'll escape from death

1465
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:26,532
We're thinking of what we'll do
having escaped death

1466
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,701
We come with
full faith, boss

1467
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,930
Come... come
Get into the auto

1468
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:50,306
Come

1469
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:22,046
Sir... sir
Let me go

1470
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:26,008
I don't know anything
I swear... let me go, sir

1471
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:28,886
Sir, I remember now

1472
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:29,971
I'll tell you

1473
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:33,933
It's near the Devi Karumari
Amman theater on Porur road

1474
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:35,142
A small by-lane there

1475
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:38,646
The 'accused' have surrendered
at the Saidapet station, sir

1476
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:40,940
Sir... sir

1477
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:43,234
I'll tell you, sir

1478
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:46,195
Sir

1479
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:49,448
Aaaaaarghhhhhhhhh!

1480
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:54,662
'ln a sudden twist in the kidnap
of the minister's son...'

1481
01:44:54,746 --> 01:44:59,333
'...the 4 culprits have surrendered
at the Saidapet police station'

1482
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:05,172
'Police have informed that they will
be produced before the court today'

1483
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:15,558
Get in

1484
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:19,937
Get in, da

1485
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:39,415
'I'm holding a gun to your face
and you're sneering at me'

1486
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,363
Do you have any
political affiliation?

1487
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,490
Why did you
surrender suddenly?

1488
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:15,701
What was your ransom amount?
Through whom?

1489
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:18,871
Did you surrender
being scared of the police?

1490
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:23,042
I'd like to say
something to the press

1491
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:26,087
How can you manhandle him
right in front of us, sir?

1492
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:30,758
En route from jail to court or
vice versa we won't escape

1493
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:33,719
If we are shot under the pretext
that we tried to escape...

1494
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:36,847
...it's planned murder and
the cop responsible for it is...

1495
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,433
...Bramma! That is
why we surrendered

1496
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:41,852
Sir, what is your response?

1497
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:46,065
Why are you silent, sir?

1498
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:49,610
CC 843
Das and co

1499
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:03,833
Arumai Prakasam

1500
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:10,131
Leave your foot wear here

1501
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,554
Everything I say is the truth

1502
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:19,056
And nothing but the truth

1503
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:25,855
- Son, tell me your name
- Arumai Prakasam

1504
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:28,149
- Your father's name
- Gnanodhayam

1505
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:31,110
Were you kidnapped
on 25th of October?

1506
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:32,945
Don't just shake your head

1507
01:47:33,029 --> 01:47:34,780
- Say yes or no
- Yes, sir

1508
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:36,323
How many people
kidnapped you?

1509
01:47:36,366 --> 01:47:37,241
4 people

1510
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:43,956
Aren't these men, Das, Pagalavan,
Sekar and Kesavan, who kidnapped you?

1511
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,374
No, sir
Not them

1512
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,918
- Huh?
- Not them, sir

1513
01:47:49,045 --> 01:47:52,339
Son, don't be tensed
Don't be scared

1514
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:55,384
Look at them carefully
Weren't they the culprits?

1515
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:56,469
No, sir

1516
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:58,262
No, sir, look carefully

1517
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,763
They're the ones
who surrendered

1518
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:01,724
No, sir, I've never seen
these people before

1519
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:03,017
You haven't?

1520
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:07,813
I think... there is... your honor

1521
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,648
Case flopped?

1522
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:13,861
You're really not lucky

1523
01:48:18,116 --> 01:48:19,658
Sign here

1524
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:25,456
- Why, sir?
- Just do it

1525
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:43,849
Tell me
No problem?

1526
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,935
Okay, bye then

1527
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:50,439
Sir, the 4 are in the van
They are on their way

1528
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:56,862
What's happening, da?
They made us sign

1529
01:48:57,572 --> 01:48:59,406
We are released, no?

1530
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:04,286
You've been released
because you signed

1531
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:08,040
I specifically told the reporters
all that to ensure we are not killed

1532
01:49:08,124 --> 01:49:09,208
Then?

1533
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:12,920
They can't 'encounter' us
only if we are criminals

1534
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:17,299
Now we're free
He can do anything

1535
01:49:22,764 --> 01:49:24,557
Relax without
blowing your top

1536
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:27,059
We'll talk to him
when he gets here

1537
01:49:45,453 --> 01:49:47,496
Wait... what are you-

1538
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,332
You get lost
Get out of this room

1539
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:54,253
Come up with me now

1540
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:57,590
Let him go... please

1541
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:03,679
Where did you
get this money?

1542
01:50:04,514 --> 01:50:06,265
Tell me
where you got it

1543
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:08,267
Where are you running?

1544
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:10,561
You thief... traitor

1545
01:50:10,645 --> 01:50:12,313
Mother... maaaaa!

1546
01:50:12,355 --> 01:50:14,189
Leave him

1547
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:15,566
You get out

1548
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:18,068
Stop this now

1549
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:20,904
You don't have the skill
to earn money of your own!

1550
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,198
So why take your
failure out on him?

1551
01:50:23,325 --> 01:50:25,534
What did you say?

1552
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:28,996
Hey! Open the door

1553
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,789
Dai! Open the door now

1554
01:50:30,832 --> 01:50:33,334
I'll lock you up for
stealing this money

1555
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,377
Open the door

1556
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:38,922
I'll kill you
when I get in

1557
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:41,008
I hope he doesn't do
something drastic

1558
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:43,093
Bring the crowbar, Karuppa

1559
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:45,512
Surrender to the police

1560
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,473
No way can you escape

1561
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:48,849
Are you going to
open it or not?

1562
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:51,185
You'll reform
only if you count bars!

1563
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:54,730
Open the door
Listen to me

1564
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:57,399
Arumai! Don't do
anything drastic

1565
01:50:57,442 --> 01:51:00,361
You shut up! You have
pampered him too much

1566
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,237
Break the door

1567
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:05,908
Quickly... break the door

1568
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,952
What's he doing inside?

1569
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,626
Move... give it to me

1570
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,296
Hold it

1571
01:51:23,968 --> 01:51:26,428
Where are you
running off to?

1572
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,348
I'll trample you to death
for being born as my son

1573
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:30,724
Maaaaa...!

1574
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:32,851
You'll only learn if we
put you behind bars

1575
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:35,521
You're stealing
the party's money?

1576
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:39,400
Dai! Make sure
he doesn't escape

1577
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:42,736
Start the car
Drive to the party office

1578
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:27,758
I need to see the leader

1579
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,218
He's eating... sit down

1580
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:34,932
You're not out begging?!

1581
01:53:35,517 --> 01:53:38,519
I meant aren't you
begging for votes?

1582
01:53:39,771 --> 01:53:41,438
Wait! Where are you going?

1583
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,441
- Don't barge in
- Let go of me

1584
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,193
Good afternoon, sir

1585
01:53:46,277 --> 01:53:47,611
I did warn him

1586
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:51,073
Sorry, I needed to tell you
something urgently

1587
01:53:51,115 --> 01:53:52,074
That's why I-

1588
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:55,160
Don't just come in
like this for any reason

1589
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,745
- Okay, sir
- Tell me

1590
01:53:56,788 --> 01:54:00,666
Beyond this I can't show you
how upright I am, sir!

1591
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:03,710
I've brought back
the ransom money lent by the party

1592
01:54:03,753 --> 01:54:05,879
Look, the money you ga-

1593
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:10,300
What is this?

1594
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:39,538
Sir, 20 million... my son

1595
01:54:39,747 --> 01:54:41,957
Gnyana... sit down

1596
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,503
Are you unwell, Gnyana?

1597
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:51,508
Sir, there are parents with 4 or 5 sons
who enjoy peace of mind

1598
01:54:51,926 --> 01:54:56,013
I'm suffering with just one

1599
01:54:56,055 --> 01:54:58,390
If there was a son
like mine in every city...

1600
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:01,101
...I swear, the world
would cease to exist

1601
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:02,436
What are you saying?

1602
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:04,688
Sir has asked me
not to let you go

1603
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,647
Will you move now or not?

1604
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,066
Madam, even if you kill me,
I won't let your son leave

1605
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:09,318
Just move, da

1606
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,111
Ma, I'll handle it

1607
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,571
Here, keep this

1608
01:55:12,655 --> 01:55:14,656
- No, I don't want it
- Take it, bro

1609
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,366
I'm loyal to your father, he will-

1610
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,285
Not for you, but for
your kid's education

1611
01:55:18,369 --> 01:55:21,163
- No, son
- You didn't let me go

1612
01:55:21,205 --> 01:55:23,290
I escaped on my own
Is that okay?

1613
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:24,499
Son...?

1614
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:28,587
Don't mess this up
Tell me exactly where they are

1615
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:31,173
Huh? Hang up

1616
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:43,769
- Pagalava!
- Kesava!

1617
01:55:43,811 --> 01:55:45,562
Where is the light switch?

1618
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:48,023
Where are you?
Sekar?

1619
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:09,127
Hey! He's back, da

1620
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:22,307
Aiyo...!

1621
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:23,934
He's hitting Sekar

1622
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,194
Where is he?

1623
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:35,445
Das?

1624
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:38,115
Pagalava...?

1625
01:56:43,287 --> 01:56:44,746
Oh no!

1626
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:49,668
Aiyo!

1627
01:56:54,507 --> 01:56:56,883
You wasted wastrel!!

1628
01:56:59,303 --> 01:57:01,888
Switch on the light
if you're a real man

1629
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:05,225
Das, not the time to
show off your bravery!

1630
01:57:09,230 --> 01:57:11,773
Shalu...?!

1631
01:57:20,324 --> 01:57:29,541
"I am now your eyelid
I watch over you 24x7 stilled"

1632
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:38,550
"Is there anything that can't heal?
It will vanish... this ordeal"

1633
01:57:38,676 --> 01:57:47,851
"Why... my dear friend?
Let go... to the very end"

1634
01:57:47,935 --> 01:57:56,068
"Why this full stop now?
Go away, my love"

1635
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,499
Hey psycho!

1636
01:58:11,709 --> 01:58:15,337
Why are you stupidly hitting
that old fellow? Come here!

1637
01:58:15,379 --> 01:58:17,130
Pagalava!

1638
01:58:19,383 --> 01:58:21,426
Where are you, Pagalava?

1639
01:58:24,305 --> 01:58:30,894
Kesava... Sekar, is this what
making out in the dark means?

1640
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:35,774
(Hysterical howling)

1641
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:51,998
This is the railway gate he told us

1642
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:54,417
Go... go... go
Take this right

1643
01:59:02,343 --> 01:59:06,096
Sir, continuous calls
asking where you are

1644
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,931
They mentioned a transfer

1645
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:18,984
Come out now

1646
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:21,862
Walk fast

1647
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:40,088
Sir? It's getting late

1648
01:59:52,643 --> 01:59:54,477
Go fast

1649
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:10,535
Das... Das!
Get up

1650
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:14,122
What happened?

1651
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:20,587
If I ever get hold of him,
he'll be minced meat

1652
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:23,924
- That's not necessary
- What is he saying?

1653
02:00:24,008 --> 02:00:26,676
He's saying there is
no need of that at all

1654
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:28,720
Careful, watch your step

1655
02:00:28,804 --> 02:00:31,139
How did you find this place, bro?

1656
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:34,351
Police department
is my friend...!

1657
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:35,644
Start the car

1658
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:41,107
Don't worry, you guys
I've arranged everything

1659
02:00:41,275 --> 02:00:42,943
You're going to Bihar

1660
02:00:43,277 --> 02:00:44,277
For a month

1661
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:47,405
No contact with
anyone till then

1662
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:52,494
Why is he here now?

1663
02:00:52,995 --> 02:00:54,371
You...!

1664
02:00:54,789 --> 02:00:56,790
I need to talk
to Das alone

1665
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:06,675
There's 50-50 here
just as we agreed

1666
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:08,927
One bag for you
Another for me

1667
02:01:09,053 --> 02:01:11,888
Sudden affection is
not good for health, Arumai

1668
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:14,683
You let me off the 2nd time
without doing anything to me

1669
02:01:14,725 --> 02:01:16,810
This isn't fake affection
It's all real

1670
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:20,772
Without realizing
we became a team

1671
02:01:21,565 --> 02:01:24,234
I didn't say anything even
when the police asked

1672
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,902
I kept my word too

1673
02:01:26,195 --> 02:01:28,405
Now I need to escape
from my father

1674
02:01:29,073 --> 02:01:31,241
Cops are searching
everywhere for me

1675
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:32,993
Don't be scared

1676
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:34,995
You're not a terrorist

1677
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:37,122
No, Das... you don't
know my father

1678
02:01:37,164 --> 02:01:39,040
I need to escape from
this city for a while

1679
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,208
Please help me

1680
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:42,377
I'll maintain
low profile for a while

1681
02:01:42,503 --> 02:01:45,714
After I spend all my cash
I'll join your team

1682
02:01:46,882 --> 02:01:48,425
I'm a criminal too now

1683
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:51,761
Enough talking, boss
Come out now

1684
02:02:08,112 --> 02:02:09,863
Arumai Prakasam?

1685
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:35,347
What's happening here?

1686
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,057
I don't know

1687
02:02:37,224 --> 02:02:39,684
Before someone else comes
and takes you away...

1688
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:42,228
...tell me how you escaped
from that psycho Bramma

1689
02:02:42,271 --> 02:02:44,356
I'm so curious
my head will burst

1690
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:55,241
Sir... sir

1691
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:57,327
Department gun

1692
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:23,353
Sir, that's kind of
a rusty old busted gun

1693
02:03:31,487 --> 02:03:33,530
Sir...!

1694
02:03:38,702 --> 02:03:40,370
Sir... careful

1695
02:03:41,247 --> 02:03:44,374
Didn't I warn you, sir?!

1696
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:48,128
Be careful

1697
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:49,546
Wait, I'll be back

1698
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:52,841
The Inspector shot himself!
Come soon, man

1699
02:04:10,025 --> 02:04:11,234
Seriously...?

1700
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:25,957
Come in

1701
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:34,132
Sit down

1702
02:04:41,265 --> 02:04:45,727
In this election instead of
your father, you'll be contesting!

1703
02:04:48,355 --> 02:04:51,149
Heavy loss to the party
thanks to your father

1704
02:04:51,275 --> 02:04:54,444
How long do we write off
accounts in his name?

1705
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:57,113
The next rule is ours too

1706
02:04:57,156 --> 02:05:00,867
In those 5 years, I want
your share of 3000 million

1707
02:05:00,951 --> 02:05:03,161
Anything beyond that is yours
Depends on your talent!

1708
02:05:03,245 --> 02:05:05,288
Sir! I object this vehemently

1709
02:05:05,372 --> 02:05:08,374
Please do so
Who asked you now?

1710
02:05:09,293 --> 02:05:12,504
3000 million
Can you do it?

1711
02:05:16,634 --> 02:05:18,218
How beautifully
he shakes his head...!

1712
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:20,011
This is how
a minister should be

1713
02:05:20,054 --> 02:05:24,098
Sir, if you make a move like this,
I may have to join another party

1714
02:05:24,141 --> 02:05:26,726
Which other party is
willing to take you in?

1715
02:05:27,228 --> 02:05:30,939
Take your wife and go
on a peaceful pilgrimage

1716
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:36,402
Your son has taken over
You take rest at home

1717
02:05:36,445 --> 02:05:39,155
Sir, don't do this
Listen to me

1718
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:39,948
Come, sir

1719
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:41,115
Politics is pure

1720
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,825
Don't make him a politician

1721
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:44,369
The country can't handle it

1722
02:05:44,411 --> 02:05:46,996
No, don't do it... please listen!

1723
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:51,209
All these days, all the fraud you've done
without your father's knowledge...

1724
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:53,044
...politics is exactly the same!

1725
02:05:53,128 --> 02:05:56,047
But here, instead of swindling
your father, it's the people

1726
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:57,799
You understand?

1727
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:02,971
We'll finish the nomination tomorrow
and start the campaigning immediately

1728
02:06:03,013 --> 02:06:03,930
Okay?

1729
02:06:17,194 --> 02:06:23,491
"He who realizes 'this too will pass'
is an enlightened soul with class"

1730
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:25,118
Sir, what will you do
if you come to power?

1731
02:06:25,202 --> 02:06:26,452
Sky is the limit!

1732
02:06:26,495 --> 02:06:28,454
'Nagarajan Cholan, M.A'

1733
02:06:28,497 --> 02:06:31,332
'1 more politician in
the family of the Cholans!'

1734
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:38,256
"He who knows 'nothing is forever'
wisest soul is he, always remember"

1735
02:06:38,382 --> 02:06:46,639
"Even if countless hurdles hinder,
let's not falter, but be the pathfinder"

1736
02:06:48,976 --> 02:06:56,149
"We cherish 'work is worship'
Blood, sweat and tears, we flourish"

1737
02:06:56,233 --> 02:07:02,739
"Let's work hard, not be a lazy lout
'bro, work like a beaver' we'll shout"

1738
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:07,076
"Bro, work like a dog
Work against the clock"

1739
02:07:13,959 --> 02:07:21,007
"You need some brains to succeed
To respect people by words and deed"

1740
02:07:21,091 --> 02:07:27,597
"If you are not scared to lose
success will follow you to suffuse!"

1741
02:07:27,681 --> 02:07:29,891
"Bro... victory is yours"

1742
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:37,023
"Wise is he who can accept
change is the only constant"

1743
02:07:37,107 --> 02:07:44,030
"Even if zillion hurdles hamper
let's be beyond compare"

1744
02:07:44,156 --> 02:07:53,373
"He who believes 'this too will pass'
is a liberated soul with class"

1745
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:58,544
'I, Arumai Prakasam,
solemnly affirm...'

1746
02:07:58,712 --> 02:08:02,757
'...I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the Constitution of India and...'

1747
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:07,011
'...that I will uphold the sovereignity
and integrity of India'

1748
02:08:07,054 --> 02:08:11,891
'And faithfully discharge the duties
as minister of Tamil Nadu'

1749
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:15,728
'I swear this without fear or favor
in the name of Tamil'

1750
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:17,772
How much is the amount?

1751
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:18,981
50 million

1752
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:20,733
Can we see the minister?

1753
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:23,695
You can see him
only if it's above 500 million

1754
02:08:23,779 --> 02:08:27,240
But ministers are
usually busy even then

1755
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:35,206
You don't need
to see the minister

1756
02:08:35,332 --> 02:08:37,542
They are his right hands!

1757
02:08:38,877 --> 02:08:42,964
But you can't go
and see them like this

1758
02:08:46,927 --> 02:08:49,470
It is only because the state
of the country is unstable

1759
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:51,639
You never know
who'll rat you out

1760
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:54,350
No one even knows where
hidden cameras are fixed

1761
02:08:54,476 --> 02:08:57,812
So we don't let anyone wear
pants and shirts inside here

1762
02:08:57,938 --> 02:08:59,647
Are you done, dude?

1763
02:09:01,692 --> 02:09:02,900
Not yet

1764
02:09:02,985 --> 02:09:05,820
Machine seems hot
It needs a break, I guess

1765
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:14,746
Why... why is there no
romance in this face?

1766
02:09:15,372 --> 02:09:17,123
Why are you looking here?

1767
02:09:17,374 --> 02:09:18,666
Make up!

1768
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:22,295
Powder him up fully

1769
02:09:24,465 --> 02:09:28,092
Act properly
Or I'll kill you

1770
02:09:31,972 --> 02:09:35,224
'lf you follow these 5 rules,
kidnapping is truly awesome'

1771
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:38,144
'1st rule: Stay clear
of people with power'

1772
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:41,647
'Remember no power house'

1773
02:09:42,065 --> 02:09:44,400
'Rule 2: No threats to kill'

1774
02:09:44,443 --> 02:09:47,111
'Rule 3: Affordable ransom money'

1775
02:09:47,237 --> 02:09:49,697
'Rule 4: No arms, no harm'

1776
02:09:49,823 --> 02:09:52,575
'Rule 5: Goof up, own up'

1777
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:04,128
Sir, sir... is that girl okay?

1778
02:10:22,272 --> 02:10:24,440
Shalu...?!

1779
02:10:52,302 --> 02:11:00,142
'Today's headlines: Kidnapping of Home Minister
Rakesh Gupta's daughter, Shalini at 9:00 a.m'
