177
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,051
""If you were Radha.""

178
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,543
Look at God"s plans!

179
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,215
Floods have ruined your village.

180
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,519
Whereas here' in Bengal' there
is a dearth of drinking water.

181
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,556
It"s famine.

182
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,087
Where did you run during
last year"s floods?

183
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:54,630
Where would we go? We kept
sitting on the rooftop.

184
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,261
This time the roof also collapsed.

185
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,373
So is your father
missing since then?

186
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,037
No' he was walking after us.

187
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,441
It was a dark night.
Brother' it was a terror night.

188
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:19,554
I have never witnessed
such a night' brother.

189
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:25,056
I still shiver when
I recall that night.

190
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,326
It was a night of
Amavasya (No moon night )...

191
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,066
Take your clothes. Hurry up!

192
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,602
In this storm I don"t
know what will happen.

193
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,575
How did this door open?

194
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:51,387
Help! Help!

195
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,686
Hold this. Tie them together.

196
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,328
There"s so much water!

197
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,665
Do you realize how foolish
your son is?

198
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,470
Don"t know where he has gone
on this stormy night.

199
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,572
Give me. Don"t know where he is.

200
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,517
Hold it or it will flow away!
- Sita! Are you ready?

201
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,051
Where had you been?
- Hurry up!

202
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,621
The water of the dam
is coming this way.

203
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,358
It"s water everywhere.
- Where shall we go?

204
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,564
How can we take all these things?
- Leave them.

205
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,541
Hold the bag properly.
- Hurry up' child.

206
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,416
I have forgotten our God"s idol
inside.

207
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,486
Forget it.
- C"mon' hurry up.

208
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,725
It is our family"s accomplished
God"s idol. How can we leave it?

209
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,051
Stop!
- Be careful! - Come this way.

210
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,261
C"mon' move. Come.

211
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,509
Did you see..

212
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,668
..my elder brother'
Ramjan' anywhere?

213
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,077
I don"t even know where my
father is' forget your bro.

214
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,682
Really?
- Yes. - O Allah!

215
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:07,521
Hold this.
- Give that. Give that' too.

216
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,424
Stay here: I"ll go and look
for father. - Be careful.

217
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,036
Father! Father!

218
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,495
Father!

219
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:25,041
How long will it rain? - Everything
of ours is carried away.

220
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,400
Nothing is left.

221
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,042
O God! What is happening?

222
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,289
Dear Lord! The water
level is rising.

223
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,526
Thakur ( chief)! Open the gates!

224
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,101
Open the gates!

225
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,578
Thakur! Thakur!

226
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,382
The flood has come when the
government has built that dam.

227
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,184
This is the only permanent
thing about the government.

228
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,457
Just watch now: the leader'
the party' the minister..

229
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,034
..they all must be busy with
some other work. - Rascals!

230
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,037
Father! Father!

231
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,709
Father! Father!

232
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:52,254
Open the gates! Thakur!

233
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:02,164
Thakur! Thakur! Open the gates!

234
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,641
Open the gates!
- Please' open the gates!

235
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,474
Open the gates!

236
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:15,245
Scoundrel! Open the gates!

237
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,355
Please' open' Thakur!

238
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:30,257
Please' help us!

239
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,479
Father!

240
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,714
Father!

241
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,622
Father!

242
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,555
Father!

243
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,472
Father!

244
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,374
How far is it? - Don"t lose heart.
It"s only a little far now.

245
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:24,123
Did you look for him then?
- We already looked a lot.

246
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,059
Is the water level still the same?

247
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,739
If the water receded'
why would we come here?

248
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,176
Don"t talk about it right now. Eat!

249
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,073
It is very late in the night.

250
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,258
How long will they stay here?

251
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,332
They will go back as soon
as the water recedes.

252
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,537
And what if the water does not
retreat for a month? - No.

253
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:18,046
Look' I can"t bear your "demon
party" for so long.

254
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,217
Got it?

255
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,689
You"ve got your sister married
to a very good man!

256
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,318
Couldn"t you find
someone better off?

257
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:44,731
I say' who will turn this lamp off?
- Yes.. yes..

258
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,618
Are you asleep?

259
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,427
Did you see how brother
behaved with us?

260
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,168
Would anyone believe that
we are real siblings?

261
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,541
He is arrogant about
his wife"s wealth.

262
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,579
Wealth is not everything in life.

263
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,247
So what if she"s rich? She"s
a barren woman after all.

264
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,215
Her first husband kicked
her out in just a year.

265
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,553
What is he so proud of now?

266
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,189
Well' the house' the land' the wife.

267
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,262
And also the job: he got all
this from his wife"s family.

268
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,067
It won"t do if he..

269
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,401
..doesn"t obey his wife"s
order after all this.

270
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,504
I"d spit on such a wealth.

271
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,288
C"mon' stand before me now.

272
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,786
Come here. Scrub here.

273
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,465
You eat so much: where do
you waste all the energy?

274
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:54,739
Scrub properly!

275
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,631
Did you sell the villagers
the milk right?

276
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,028
Have you eaten anything?

277
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,176
You will have to go to the market.

278
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,278
Go and buy 5 kg wheat. The expenses
have increased now.

279
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,323
We need 1.5 kg flour every day.

280
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,385
And don"t take long.

281
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,050
If your brother doesn"t get food..

282
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,162
..when he returns' he gets angry.

283
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,300
The household items
have become so dear.

284
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,569
It"s difficult to support
even a 2 member family.

285
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,463
And to top that..

286
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,741
I wonder at your intelligence' Sita!

287
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,412
You should have abstained..

288
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,572
..from having children
in this poverty.

289
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:31,144
Instead' you have given birth
to so many children.

290
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,381
One should be more sensible
these days.

291
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,759
In such a little amount I don"t
know how to run the household.

292
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,164
This is why I haven"t given
birth to any children.

293
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,572
Actually' this is due to
the lack of education.

294
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,407
Women know nothing. They only
eat' sleep and give birth.

295
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,111
As if it were her own
wish. Barren woman!

296
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,516
What did you say?
- Nothing.

297
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,551
I just wondered you have many..

298
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,622
..brothers and sisters despite
all the knowledge.

299
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,555
Yes' yes' my father could afford'
so he had children.

300
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:14,492
Yes' you are right. - Why would
I bother myself with you?

301
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,294
It"s said on the radio'
cinema and even in homes.

302
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,465
Have only 2 or 3 children.
Have you ever heard of it?

303
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,567
We have only 2 children.

304
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,074
You can"t even support
yourself' dear.

305
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,269
We have only 2 kids!

306
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,157
Listen' brother!

307
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,465
Where are all these people going?

308
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,601
To pay homage to Dev Shishu.

309
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,266
Dev Shishu?
- Yes. - Does he perform miracles?

310
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,469
My dear' the deity will
fulfill your wish..

311
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,240
..within two hours if he is pleased.

312
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,407
Really?
- Yes. - How?

313
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,619
You know that Jitanmat"s
pregnant wife?

314
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,086
She prayed to God to give
him a son this year..

315
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:51,490
..and that she would offer a
silver necklace in return.

316
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,596
She suffered from
a very bad disease.

317
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,566
By the morning the child
was down on the ground.

318
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,264
Really? - Yes' that is why
the public is going crazy.

319
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,111
I am also going there for
the cure of my broken leg.

320
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,747
Listen' brother! What is his fee?
- What fee?

321
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,344
You have to buy only a
ticket worth 19 paisa.

322
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,513
Then you can offer what you
want as per your wish.

323
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,626
19 paisa.

324
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,795
Raghu?

325
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:34,631
Rama!

326
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,331
Where are you headed to?
- To the market.

327
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:45,205
I heard that.. you are
very much in trouble.

328
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,078
Who told you?
- I attended the Bhajan that night.

329
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,247
Your brother-in-law said.

330
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,245
Yes' brother' we are
in serious trouble.

331
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,485
It never rains: it pours.

332
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,623
It"s my bad luck. God knows
what might happen now.

333
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,434
I think you are affected
by Shani (Saturn ).

334
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,774
Shani?!
- Yes' Shani.

335
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,102
Do this: if you"re going to
the market' visit him' too.

336
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,149
A child deity has arrived
here. He is great.

337
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,176
Someone"s dying son survived.

338
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:35,457
Someone won the case.
Someone gained money.

339
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,123
Hindu' Muslim' communist' congress..

340
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,262
..everyone is bowing to him.

341
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,564
Then what should I do' tell me?
- What should you do?

342
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,169
Queue up for the ticket. Tell
your worries to the child god.

343
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,335
Then watch the magic of Dev Shishu.

344
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,644
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

345
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,115
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

346
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,153
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

347
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,417
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

348

..to bring anyone back
to life or kill anyone.

430

Look at its magic.

433
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,295

440
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,218
..Allah sighs and Jesus worries.

441
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,356
But look at the magic

peoples in politics..

The magic of Langti..

448

..is the only remedy in this sorrow.

449
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,772
It is like a shot of penicillin.

450

In short' Langti does not
lie. He does not joke.

453
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,230
Look at the first wonder of Langti.

454
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,029
A poor man of this village..

455
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,364
..came to watch the magic
show with his wife.

456
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,432
With so much difficulty and love..

457
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,044
..he bought a pair of
earrings for his wife.

458
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,543
But look at the fate' the bad luck.

459
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,115
The earring got lost.

460
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:25,048
It got lost in this same
village' not Barely.

461
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,365
Don"t look for it there.
Tell me on the stage.

462
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,336
There are thieves and
goons over there.

463
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,236
Whereas Langti is the magician here.

464

00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,441
You will get whatever you ask for.

473
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,272
Langti!
- Yes' sir?

474
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,310

this madam"s earring?

475

Go and get the earring.

I am a slave of your command.

483
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:03,319
Everyone will clap
honestly and hard.

484
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:09,020
Sir! - Got it? - Got it' sir.

485
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,189
The skull? The burning skull.
The flying graveyard.

00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,022
It can scare anyone. The
magic of Calcutta.

487
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,431
Bottle Baba tells everyone
not to move..

488
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:24,597
..or stand' or scream or scratch.

489

00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,187
Hurry up! We don"t have much time.

507
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,199

O mother!

O God!

512
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,138
Mother!

513
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,671
O mother!

What happened?

515
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,315
Go and send for the
village witch doctor.

516
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,708
The witch doctor? Why?

517
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,858
Is something wrong?
- No.

518
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,094
But he doesn"t look
like a human being.

519
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,822
Doesn"t look human?

520
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:48,101
Hey' wait! Men are not
allowed to go inside.

521
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,172
Some evil spirit has
influenced the child.

522
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,037
It has gone three heads
and four hands.

523
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:57,814
Sita is unconscious.

524
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:03,314
Why are you standing
here? Go quickly.

525
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,913
If dawn comes up' there
will be danger.

526
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,169
Look' I"ve never scolded you..

527
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,742
..because of my daughter.

528
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,613
I have advised you many a times.

529
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,110
Keep this circus business
as an extra business..

530
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,184
..and find a permanent job.

531
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,782
But you turn a deaf ear.

532
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,285
One doesn"t get a job
easily these days.

533
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,358
I worked hard' but that
doesn"t help either.

534
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:49,832
It might be useful in your region.

535
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,627
The situation is different
there in Bengal.

536
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,959
The party politics is so bullish..

537
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,230
..that anyone on their
target is done for.

538
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,167
Don"t talk nonsense.
So what if it is so?

539
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,778
Don"t I have clients in Bengal' too?

540
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,569
Why don"t you join a party?

541
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:08,041
One doesn"t gain anything without
party politics these days.

542
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,584
You cannot understand our situation
there sitting here.

543
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,147
Over there..
- My dear magician!

544
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:17,321
I am no fool.

545
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,823
Do you think I don"t follow
the party politics?

546
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,766
Do you belong to a party?

547
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,832
Have I influenced all these
villages and towns just like that?

548
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,970
Which party?
- I don"t belong to any party.

549
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,137
Hindu' Muslims' Sikhs' Christians..

550
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,746
..all are my brothers.

551
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:43,281
Congress' public' socialists..

552
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:47,082
..BJP' Jan Sangh' communists'
all listen to me.

553
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,988
Got it? No? Try and understand.

554
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:59,802
I am neutral. I don"t
belong to any party.

555
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,667
That"s my party. I have
a say in all parties.

556
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:08,574
But I play party politics
so discreetly..

557
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,839
..that even my son-in-law
doesn"t understand.

558
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,071
Got it?

559
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,919
Look' I have the minister'
the officers..

560
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,955
..and all others as my disciples.

561
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,319
So do what I tell you.

562
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,022
That will be better and financially
beneficial for you.

563
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,995
Shall I join politics?
- Sure.

564
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,207
The slogan of 1942 was "do or die".

565
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,901
Today"s slogan is "do or pay".

566
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,075
I say the truth as
I have taken hemp.

567
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,919
There are many sorts of sages..

568
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:56,024
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

569
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:02,058
Who is it?
- It"s me' Raghu.

570
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,791
So late in the night?
- I am in a horrible situation.

571
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,161
You know me very well.

572
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,107
Don"t know what ill luck has
struck me. It"s terrible.

573
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,644
Go and get him.

574
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,278
This is no time to disturb someone.

575
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,609
You are from Gopalpur' right?
- Yes' yes.

576
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,771
The earring case' right?
- Yes' sir.

577
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,812
Come on in. Don"t be scared.

578
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:58,754
Come.

579
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,562
Priest' something terrible
has happened.

580
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:09,824
Save me' please. What should I do?

581
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,968
What happened' idiot? Will
you tell me or not?

582
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,234
My wife' Sita.
- Yes? - She"s given birth to a son.

583
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:23,040
So what?
- Something terrible has happened.

584
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,116
He.. he doesn"t look
like a human being.

585
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:35,656
Then how does he look?
- That.. I don"t know.

586
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,185
He has 3 heads and 4 hands.

587
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,200
The case seems interesting.

588
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,933
How can I come so late in
the night? - Help me!

589
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,273
My wife is unconscious.

590
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,147
Come and see the bad luck.

591
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,543
As per the Shastras..

592
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,545
..the birth of such a
child means a big sin.

593
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,156
That is as per the scriptures.

594
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,629
It is also illegal as per
the government rules.

595
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:20,897
What will happen now' priest?

596
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,699
Listen: whether the child
lives or dies is the same.

597
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,070
This child is unlucky
for the village.

598
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:34,578
If you still keep the child and the
villagers find out about him..

599
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:39,950
..they will call your wife
a witch and kill her.

600
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:44,983
No' please' don"t say so.
- What is there to say?

601
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:50,930
It"s a game of the planets.
Right' priest?

602
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,213
Tell me something.

603
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,552
Did you or your wife..

604
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:27,890
..see a black cat while
sleeping together?

605
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,088
You mean?

606
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,162
I don"t remember any such thing.

607
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,070
How would you remember?

608
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,906
And why would anyone remember?

609
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,047
Ok' tell me this.

610
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:47,983
Which direction..

611
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,120
..was your wife facing
while conceiving?

612
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,155
East or west?

613
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,793
What can I say' priest?
I don"t know.

614
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:19,276
Get rid of this child
as soon as possible.

615
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,018
If that child lives' something
terrible will happen.

616
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,294
And till he is alive' it will
be illegal to kill him.

617
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,634
The police will arrest you.

618
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,137
Then give me a solution'
sir. I beg of you.

619
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,777
That"s ok.

620
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,345
Now do this: bring him to us.

621
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:56,885
We will take care of everything.

622
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,042
What will you do?

623
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,850
We will deposit him with the
government. - Why' sir?

624
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,188
What crime have I done?
- No crime' dear.

625
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,596
But no one will suspect
if we deposit him.

626
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,132
If you deposit him'
you will be arrested.

627
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:19,266
What is he saying?
- Idiot! The magician is right.

628
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,674
A demon birth is not allowed
as per government rules.

629
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,942
There"s no other way out.

630
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,283
Leave everything to me' priest.
First save his wife.

631
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,016
Save my wife' doctor.

632
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,733
Take it.

633
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,602
At dawn' turn your wife"s
face to the east..

634
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:25,764
..and tie this on her right
arm with a clear heart.

635
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,603
Go.
- Thank you' doctor.

636
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:39,219
What"s this? - Go back. No
one should know about it.

637
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,022
C"mon' move. Why are
you staring at me?

638
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,231
Guruji' talk to him. He"s been
making a traffic jam here.

639
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,268
Father"s name?
- Khadiram.

640
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,740
What"s the matter? Don"t
you want to do the Pooja?

641
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,585
Who have you decorated as
the deity? - Move on.

642
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,091
Didn"t you recognize me?
- Are you a VIP or what?

643
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,059
No' sir. I am Raghu from Gopalpur.

644
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,598
Don"t you remember' sir?
That night when my wife..

645
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:29,295
..had given birth to
an unusual child.

646
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:33,672
I don"t need to remember.
Get out quietly.

647
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:36,769
How can I get out?

648
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,005
That child deity is not
God: he is my son.

649
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:44,645
I will kick you and break
your bones. Run away!

650
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:50,122
Get out! - I swear on God
I am in serious trouble.

651
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:51,260
What can I do if you are?

652
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,021
Everything of mine is
ruined in the floods.

653
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:56,626
You must give me a share..

654
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,165
..from the money you"ve earned.

655
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,566
What?!
- He is my son after all. - Bastard!

656
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:07,903
You"re trying to blackmail me' eh?

657
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,238
Did you give me the child for free?

658
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,109
You took 30 rupees cash from me.

659
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,580
I didn"t know then that
you would make my son..

660
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,584
..a child god and
make so much money.

661
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,255
Will you go or not' you scoundrel?

662
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,188
You must give me half the money.

663
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,935
Who is he?
- No one. Do what I say.

664
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,615
You must give me half the
money from this plate.

665
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:52,220
I won"t give you a penny.
- You won"t? - No.

666
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,321
It"s my son"s earnings:
how can you not give me?

667
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,621
I told you I won"t give you.
What will you do?

668
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,626
How will you not give me?

669
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,230
Thief! Thief!
- Catch him! - Hit him!

670
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,907
He is my son! It"s
my son"s earnings.

671
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,908
He is my son! Don"t hit
me! This is not fair.

672
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,045
He is my son. I am telling the truth.

673
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,578
Don"t hit me.

674
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,725
I am not a thief' brother.

675
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:41,200
This.. this boy is my son. He is
not Child God. He is not God.

676
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,898
That man is lying. He
is fooling everyone.

677
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,807
Listen to me' please. Listen..

678
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,968
Hit him! Hit him!

679
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,194
Let go of him! It"s ok. Leave him!

680
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:54,834
Leave him. Let us go.

681
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,222
Is this your blessing?

682
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:39,962
A normal human being goes
hungry and gets kicked out.

683
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:47,097
And the one who looks like
a devil becomes God!

684
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,306
Is this fair' Mother?

685
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,600
""God is incarnated.""

686
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:19,263
""God is incarnated.""

687
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:23,775
""God is incarnated.""

688
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:28,007
""God is incarnated.""

689
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:32,882
""Everyone is eager to
pay homage to him.""

690
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:37,685
""Everyone is eager to
pay homage to him.""

691
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,225
People' take care..

692
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:47,029
No need to hurry. Everyone
will get a chance.

693
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,938
Please' take care of other
visitors behind you.

694
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:55,635
Come in a queue. Don"t
disorganize everything.

695
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,108
Go in one by one.

696
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:50,292
Leela! Hey Leela!
- Coming. Just a minute.

697
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:10,115
Sita! Sita!

698
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:20,890
Where is she? Sita!
Hey deaf woman! Sita!

699
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,679
Why hasn"t your husband
returned yet?

700
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:38,813
He left long back.

701
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,111
Give me some water to wash hands.

702
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,085
Being silly does not
help these days.

703
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,621
If one"s husband is not clever..

704
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,322
..the family will be in trouble.
- You are right.

705
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,331
She is stupid.

706
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,564
Tell your husband as
soon as he returns..

707
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,106
..to get the wheat grounded.

708
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,243
And you make the Roti' ok?

709
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,903
And if your brother returns..

710
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,240
..tell him we"ve gone to the market.

711
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,780
To pay homage to the Child God.

712
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,616
Khedu! Stand up' Khedu.

713
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,276
Stand outside: tell me if
someone is coming' ok? Go.

714
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:31,978
Sweetmeat! Sweetmeat!

715
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:37,588
Sweetmeat! Sweetmeat!

716
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:42,053
Sweetmeat! Sweetmeat!

717
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,095
Is your mother home? Will
you buy sweetmeat?

718
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:52,935
No? Sweetmeat! Sweetmeat!

719
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,630
Here.

720
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:19,968
Khedu!

721
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,070
Khedu! Khedu! Come.

722
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:27,642
Sit down.

723
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:32,981
Here' take this.

724
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:35,650
Drink it.

725
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:40,855
My child! Drink.

726
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,652
Don"t tell anyone' Khedu. Drink.

727
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,934
Go and see if your father is coming.

728
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:04,612
Drink.

729
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,260
Come here.

730
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:57,164
Khedu! Come here.

731
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,298
Come here!

732
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:05,867
Like father like son.

733
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,740
Where had you been? Did
you see your father?

734
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:14,147
Both of you are giving
us a hard time.

735
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,876
What are you staring
at? Come inside.

736
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,120
Sita! Sita!

737
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:08,666
Sita! Look! How is it?

738
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:13,608
I had gone to the market:
I saw some good fish there.

739
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:17,940
I haven"t had it for many days.
Then I thought about you.

740
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,613
Can you guess how much I got it for?

741
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:23,115
Have you seen your brother-in-law
anywhere?

742
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:27,619
No. Why?
- He left since the dawn.

743
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,620
He hasn"t even eaten anything.

744
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,625
Bhabhi had sent him
to get the wheat..

745
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:34,762
..and he hasn"t returned yet.

746
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,091
Then where has he stayed back?
- God knows.

747
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,230
I am destined to face only sorrow.

748
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,362
For my husband..

749
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,377
Why are you crying?

750
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:54,781
Ok' wait. I"ll go and look for him.

751
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,187
Does he suffer from epilepsy
or something?

752
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:08,729
No. But after the floods'
he screams in his sleep.

753
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,592
He only screams: nothing else.

754
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,862
Ok' don"t be scared.
I"ll go and check.

755
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:05,570
He hasn"t returned yet' has he?

756
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,575
It"s not something
unusual for me now.

757
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,987
It"s my destiny. Don"t worry.

758
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:23,990
How wouldn"t I worry?
- Go in and go to sleep.

759
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,259
If Bhabhi sees you here' she
will quarrel with you.

760
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,136
Go.

761
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,110
What.. what state you are..
was there any problem?

762
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,296
Why are you so quiet?

763
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,102
How did this happen?

764
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:11,762
Say something.

765
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:19,040
You went to the market' but
didn"t bring the wheat.

766
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,046
Bhabhi (Sister-in-law ) scolded me so
much because of you.

767
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:31,252
Won"t you say anything?

768
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,253
Did you fall down somewhere?

769
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,336
Speak!

770
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:49,871
You had been hungry since morning:
did you feel giddy?

771
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:53,871
Something has happened.

772
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,617
What has happened that
you"re not telling me?

773
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:05,821
Tell me.
- What would I tell you?

774
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:08,629
How did your shirt tear?

775
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:13,834
People thrashed me in the market.
- Why?

776
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,237
What did you do?

777
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:22,166
I.. I had gone to pay homage
to the Child God.

778
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:28,581
For the vow.
- The vow?

779
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:39,051
Do you know who the Child God is?
- Who is he?

780
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:45,323
Don"t ask. He is our
son with the 3 heads.

781
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,004
What are you saying?!

782
01:26:56,778 --> 01:27:01,545
Did you see closely?
- Do you think I am lying?

783
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,543
Can anyone forget his own child?

784
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:13,150
But today everyone
considers him God.

785
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:18,093
I said a dozen times that
I am his father..

786
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,699
..but no one listened.

787
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,103
Is.. is he still alive?

788
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:30,707
He"s not only alive' but
also earns thousands.

789
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,248
He earns and that scoundrel
enjoys the money.

790
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,581
Did he recognise you?

791
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:46,785
Does God child ever recognises a man?

792
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:50,323
Why do you say so?

793
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:56,801
After all' he was born to me.

794
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,140
Take me to him once.

795
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:10,282
He will surely come to me. He will.

796
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:15,285
Please' take me.. - Shut up! Do
you want to get beaten now?

797
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,559
I don"t care if people
hit me or kill me.

798
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:30,568
I will go and see him.
I am his mother.

799
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:38,177
I will go.
- Why do you bother me?

800
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,972
Take off! Take off your clothes!

801
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,781
What are you doing? Let go!

802
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:50,590
Give birth to one more child
like him. Take off!

803
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:53,320
Let go or you will see me dead.

804
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,330
Will you take off or not?

805
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,060
You"re behaving like an animal.

806
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:02,865
Me' an animal? And those
who came to pay homage..

807
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:04,732
..to him are humans' aren"t they?

808
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:09,209
What does it matter to you?
Aren"t you his father?

809
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,212
You aren"t ashamed.
- Bastard!

810
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:15,015
Why should I be ashamed?

811
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:17,814
They are our children' but
of what use are they?

812
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,018
They have one head and two legs.

813
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:21,618
What will they earn and
what will they eat?

814
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,824
I want another child like him.
- Shameless!

815
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:30,292
If you don"t earn' am
I to give birth..

816
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:32,092
..to another child for money?

817
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:34,698
What"s wrong with you?

818
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:37,962
Look at our children.

819
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,704
Don"t you have any sense
despite being a father?

820
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,302
Have you gone crazy?
- Never mind me.

821
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,644
The whole world has gone crazy.

822
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:50,909
That"s why people queue
up for miles to see him.

823
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:55,787
Such children are of
no use these days.

824
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,588
One needs a child with
10 heads' a Ravan.

825
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,597
A son of a devil will
earn thousands.

826
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:09,260
And a son of a human will only beg!
- Let them beg!

827
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:11,868
I don"t want such a child.

828
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:20,077
What"s wrong with you?
You were never so.

829
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,142
Who taught you all this?

830
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,354
Did that magician teach
you some mantra?

831
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:33,760
If you are a man' go and beat him.

832
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,359
What a pitiable fate!

833
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:46,295
All the sorrow and troubles
are written in my fate.

834
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,638
What inspired us to come here?

835
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:51,912
O God!

836
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:18,668
C"mon' go to sleep now.

837
01:31:20,374 --> 01:31:24,674
It"s better to sleep than
having bad thoughts.

838
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:31,676
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

839
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:34,747
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

840
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,351
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

841
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:41,010
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

842
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,094
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

843
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:53,028
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

844
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:56,361
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

845
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:59,097
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

846
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,300
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

847
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:05,309
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

848
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,577
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

849
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,309
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

850
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:24,593
""Krishna dances through
all the ages.""

851
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:28,733
""Krishna dances through
all the ages.""

852
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:33,333
""Krishna dances through
all the ages.""

853
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:37,670
""Krishna dances through
all the ages.""

854
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:41,946
""Come and pay homage to Lord.""

855
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,944
""Come and pay homage to Lord.""

856
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:48,287
Stop!

857
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,327
""Look' our dream is fulfilled.""

858
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:51,198
""O Ram! Our dream is fulfilled.""

859
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:56,002
Come! Come quickly' to the
temple of Dev Shishu.

860
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:57,801
There is a temple nearby.

861
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:02,739
And the name of this
God is Child God.
