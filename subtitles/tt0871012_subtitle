1
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,303
Rama.

2
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,273
Shama.

3
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,574
Bhama.

4
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,522
Peddus! Peddus!

5
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,458
Did you call me?
- Where's the cartoon that I drew?

6
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,962
It must be there. Does it have
legs to run away? Search it.

7
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,555
It isn't here. That is the reason,
lam asking you.

8
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,100
Where did it go? Hello karant,
give me 1O minutes.

9
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,261
I'll call you back again. I had
kept it here, it is missing now.

10
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,032
Where did the cartoon disappear?

11
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,163
Why do you have to shout for it?

12
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,298
You can draw one more, can't you?

13
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,239
It is easy for you to
say to draw one.

14
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,971
Move aside. I Know how
tough it is to draw one.

15
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,014
Jamuna, give
something to La><mi to drink.

16
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,278
Why don't you feed her Bournvita?

17
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,180
What's wrong if I do so? Doesn't
it give 1O liters of milk everyday?

18
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,343
Dear, have this.

19
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,581
Tell the cow to go to the office
because it gives 1O liters of milk.

20
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,214
Tie me in the shed.
This is too much.

21
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,195
They irritate me
while I am meditating.

22
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,321
What's your problem?

23
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,092
I had drawn a cartoon for
tomorrow's special edition.

24
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:08,395
Editor is calling me since morning;
I am not able to find that cartoon.

25
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,003
I can't find anything
in place in this house.

26
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,265
You have to do office
work at the office..

27
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,464
Good morning, daddy.
- ..why do you do it at home?

28
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,131
Hey.. - Don't you know that
children live in this house?

29
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,267
Did you see the
cartoon that I had drawn?

30
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,401
Which one, daddy?

31
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,945
How will that poor kid know?

32
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,071
Father-in-lavm.

33
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,948
Put sugar at least
once in a week, dear.

34
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,041
I'll not do it once in a year too.

35
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,948
His papers are lying
all over the house..

36
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,282
...whether it be kitchen or bathroom.

37
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,013
I_ool<.. - I know.. I know.. it is
an art, I don't Know about it..

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,991
Because I am a village girl, dumb.

39
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,152
How would I know about it?
- Darling.

40
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,695
You scolded me till now and now
you're addressing me as 'darling.'

41
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,555
I didn't call you, but the dog.

42
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,964
I have named it as Sannaki.
It is a wonderful name.

43
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:43,161
Why do you address it as 'darling?

44
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,363
You treat wife as a dog
and a dog as your wife.

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,305
La><mi.. lam coming. Coming.

46
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,139
Oh, this is too much.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,672
This is not a house, but
has become Mysore zoo.

48
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,472
Get two monkeys and two pigs more.

49
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,511
Early morning the fight
between the dog and cow begins.

50
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,648
Mow and bow wow.

51
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,483
This is not a house,
but a fish market.

52
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,529
Everything disappears.
Where the hell is my cartoon?

53
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,125
Look, whatever
mistake you do, we all..

54
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,318
Look, were you
searching for this cartoon?

55
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,553
What? How did it go in the dustbin?

56
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,684
You put it inside.
- What?

57
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,962
When I offered you hot coffee,
you were talking on phone.

58
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,090
...and spilt all the coffee. You
scold me if the table is not clean.

59
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,635
So, I cleaned it up with the
paper and put it in a bin.

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,636
Why worry, you found
it now, didn't you?

61
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,505
You wiped it from this cartoon?

62
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,540
My God. I can't believe this.

63
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,538
Oh, I can't believe this.

64
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,447
The handwriting is beautiful.

65
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,908
I can't believe if these
guys write love letter in this..

66
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,477
...era of SIVIS and e-mails.

67
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,255
I am surprised, Raja.

68
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,923
We've been working in the
same office since one and..

69
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,326
...a half years and we
sit beside each other.

70
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,296
Couldn't you propose me?

71
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,358
I love you, Priya.

72
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,939
Raja, I know that you're honest,
good looking..

73
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,306
...and a very cultured guy.

74
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,072
But my desires are different, Raja.

75
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,640
I have to live like a queen.
My house should be like a palace.

76
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,009
Servants to serve me and
20-25 cars for me to roam about.

77
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:43,283
Hi, early birds. What
are you discussing about?

78
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,657
You can carry on. I will
not hear a thing. Okay?

79
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:54,258
Priya, shall we go on site?
It is getting late. - Okay.

80
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:03,164
Priya, money is not
important in life.

81
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,901
For me money matters a lot.

82
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,947
I Know it is important. I'll fax
it to you as soon as possible.

83
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,015
There will be coffee
stains on it. Kindly adjust.

84
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,208
The auto is here. Come on, leave.

85
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,340
Thank you.

86
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,249
There are two cars in our house.

87
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,514
Why are you sending
the kids in an auto?

88
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,919
If you send these kids to the
school in the car in primary.

89
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,423
...standard, they'll demand for a
helicopter when they go to college.

90
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,356
They'll learn only when they
work hard. Hurry up. Hurry.

91
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,088
Mr. Rangaswamy.. why did
you get me married to her'?

92
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,927
You got this illiterate girl
married to me and ruined..

93
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,093
...my whole life.

94
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:31,134
Take care, you might shave off
your moustache in anger. Careful.

95
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,172
Okay. Okay. - Father-in-lavv..
come with me.. - Take this along.

96
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,932
It doesn't matter if I make
my children have bath or not.

97
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,066
...but I have to give
bath to this daily.

98
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,200
So much of shaving cream.

99
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,677
Dear, lam not finding
my snuff bo><.. - I threw it.

100
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,538
Why? - Father-in-lavv, you'll suffer
from cancer if you take the snuff.

101
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,942
Drunkards don't die
besides drinking so much..

102
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,977
...how would a little
snuff lead to cancer?

103
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,147
What's for breakfast?

104
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,952
What do you expect? The
same steamed pancakes.

105
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,390
...and doughnuts. There's
no variety in my life.

106
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,688
Is there a feast for
me to make variety food?

107
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,959
Early morning I make
children brush their teeth..

108
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,965
...have bath, make them wear uniform,
make them do homework.

109
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,432
You want variety of food daily.

110
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,228
Oh, did you hear that?

111
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,363
You be careful about your moustache.

112
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:09,566
By the way, who saw our
horoscopes and got us married'?

113
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,035
Not I, dear.

114
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,443
Whoever it is, horrible couple.
It is a wrong pair.

115
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,038
It is a wrong pair, Raja.

116
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:20,242
Our ambitions and goal in
life doesn't match each others.

117
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:23,585
But. - If you have money, you can
fall in love with Shakespeare too.

118
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,385
Don't underestimate money.

119
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,516
But Priya.

120
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,423
Please Raja, try to understand.

121
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:34,990
I lost my parents in childhood
and I am brought up by my uncle.

122
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:41,997
I had to wash vessels and loads
of clothes early in the morning.

123
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,600
I had to sweep and
mop the whole house.

124
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,506
The verandah and the main hall.

125
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,178
After joining college, I had to
share the room with many girls.

126
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:59,250
Raja, I hate the word 'poverty.'

127
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,253
Do you Know how my life should be'?

128
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,555
I shouldn't do window
shopping in the mall.

129
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,557
I have to shop there.

130
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,630
I have to buy the watch which
Shah Rukh Khan shows in the TV.

131
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:16,966
I have to buy the necklace which
Aaishvvarya Rai wears in the TV.

132
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,307
You Know how my
dream husband should be'?

133
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,906
Beautiful car, big house,
big bank balance..

134
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,944
...foreign vacations.
I am sorry, Raja.

135
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,648
I will marry a rich guy only.

136
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,501
So sad, he resigned.

137
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,198
Raja is not to be
seen from past two days.

138
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,529
Sir, I don't know.

139
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,664
Is he sick or something?

140
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,271
Yes, love sick.

141
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,968
You show a lot of attitude.
Raja is a very handsome guy.

142
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,276
You should've accepted
his proposaL.

143
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,250
Shut up. There are too
many fish in the sea.

144
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,488
Hello.

00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:18,552
"I can't forget you at all."

172
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:23,027
"I think about you all the time."

173
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,155
Hi..

174
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,692
Hi, hovv are you?

175
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,033
Flat. How about payment?
Full cash or..

176
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,097
Your wish, my boss will
be happy if he gets money.

177
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,512
So? Did you have your food?

178
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,575
Not yet.

179
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,312
Shall we have dinner together?

180
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,718
If you don't mind.
- Okay.

181
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,052
Something?

182
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,320
Nothing. Nothing.

183
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:07,665
"Slowly and stealthily
you've entered into my heart."

184
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:15,574
"You're submerged into my eyes."

185
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,640
"I dream about you all the time."

186
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:24,456
"You're the love of my life."

187
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:30,018
"I remember you every moment."

188
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,964
"The same am bience."

189
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:38,026
"I can't forget you at all."

190
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:42,302
"I think about you all the time."

191
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:50,312
See. girls.. there's one more here.

192
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,678
One man is suffering
from throat infection.

193
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,611
He is unable to speak.

194
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,112
Whatever he talks
sounds like whisper..

195
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,281
He used to say..
Hello, hovv are you?

196
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:02,225
He went to a doctor's house.
He knocked the door.

197
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,095
Doctor's wife opened the door.

198
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,655
He asked her: is doctor inside?

199
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,665
So, doctor's wife
said: No, please come in.

200
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,644
Who sends you all these?
- Someone or other..

201
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,278
Please, forward them to me.

202
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:35,453
"There's shower of
love everywhere."

203
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:43,230
"Here, there, and everywhere.
Love is all around us."

204
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,170
"This is a story of love."

205
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:51,403
"This is the story of our life."

206
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,180
"I remember you every moment."

207
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,980
"The same am bience."

208
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,314
"I can't forget you at all."

209
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,350
"I think about you all the time."

210
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:17,233
"Don't know in which birth we
will come close to each other."

211
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,568
"I remember you every moment."

212
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:28,174
"The same am bience."

213
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,079
This is a very good property.
Don't let this go.

214
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,951
There's a railway
station nearby, a supermarket.

215
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,957
...registration charges, my
commission, altogether.

216
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,356
...it is 5.3 million.

217
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,417
There's a little bit of work left.

218
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,693
I'll finish that and
give the keys in your hand.

219
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,593
Ram, the flat is superb.
It is very nice.

220
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,568
But it is rupees 300
thousand more than our budget.

221
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,971
What do we do? Thank you!

222
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,346

What do we do?

226
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,050
What do we do?

227
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,317

What's this? You're
leaving to Delhi all of a sudden?

232
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,580
There's an All-India
cartoonist conference.

233
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,175
I am representing Karnataka.

234
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,310
Isn't it a matter of pride to you?

235
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,521
You have the steamed
pancakes and leave.

236
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,554
It is a flight and
not your village bus.

237
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,422
They'll take care of everything.
Dear, I shall leave now.

238
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,551

get for me from Delhi?

00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,157
I want a doll, daddy.

244
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,902
Bye, dear. Hello darling, bye.

245
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,440
Don't eat anything outside.
Eat only steamed pancakes.

246
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,566
Bye. Bye.

247
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,008
Departures.

248
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,247

00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,614
Ram, relax.
- Yes. Yes.

252
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,632
Ram, this is really too much.
Remove your goggles.

253
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,938
This is a public place, if
anyone sees us and tells it..

254
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,442
...to my wife.. I mean, parents.

255
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,479
Do you have parents?

256
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,146
If I didn't have,
where did I come from?

257
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,151
Nothing like that. I
thought you were orphan like me.

258
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,009
Tell me, who all are
in your family?

259
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,680
Family?

260
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,418
Family means, father, mother,
brother, sister.. who else?

261
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,586
That family?

262
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,288
Which family did you
think I was talking about?

263
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,422
No, I thought.

264
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,028
Priya, I've not told
you certain things.

265
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,494
Do you think I don't understand
anything until you tell me?

266
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,631
Shall I guess?

267
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,973
You're the only son to your parents.

268
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,271
You must be having three sisters.

269

You'll marry only after they
are married. ls it correct?

Correct. Exactly, correct.
Well done. You guessed it right!

Excuse me, someone is coming here.

If you don't mind, please.

Don't worry. You'll be here
for 5-10 minutes, won't you?

282
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,162
<i>Why?</i>

283
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,298
To take care of my luggage.
- I'll take care of it.

284
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,432
You can leave.

285
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,901
That's my destiny. If I turn
on the light of the hall..

286
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,640
...the bathroom bulb turns on.

287
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,206
You take care of it yourself.

288
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,318
I like that. - You liked it?
That means, you'll take care of it.

289
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,083
Don't worry. I'll hold on to it.

290

00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,299
He is an irritating guy. If he sees
you with me, then.. Escape from here.

344
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,930
Someone has kept his
luggage here for me to take care.

345
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,065
To hell with the luggage.

346
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,936
You go there and
take the boarding pass.

347
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,068
...l'll finish the
security check and..

348
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,939
Hey, you made me order
coffee for you and came.

00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:10,039
...here as if
I was a stranger to you.

350
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:11,343
Oh sorry. Did I waste it?

351
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,944
No, it didn't. I first
drank tea and then coffee.

352
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,316
The coffee is sleeping
over tea now.

353
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,684
She likes jokes very much.

354
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,549
So, do you know her?
- No.

355
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,086
She is related with the luggage.

356
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,221
He is my old friend, Ram.

357

00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,364
You didn't tell me your name.

How do you know?

360
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,094
It is written on the luggage.

361
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,539
It is written as VIP sky bag.

362
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:37,665
That's the name of the bag. Here
it is written on the tag. Priya.

363
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,505

Did I force her? I knovv..

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,484
Why did you chase her from here?

382
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,012
You sent her because you
wanted us to be together.

383
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:30,958
Isn't it? Remove your goggles.
- Why?

384
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,022

Don't worry.

Alright, you leave. I'll come.

389
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,973
Come and sit on the
Y-16th seat in the plane.

390
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,101

391
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,104

This is really silly.
Why are you getting so scared?

You don't know about him.
He is a very dangerous fellow.

00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,999
If he sees you with me, then..

00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,941
You sit straight, please.

00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:35,009
Luck. I am very lucky.

515
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,155
She is coming this way.
Don't see there.

516
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:42,190
My wife hasn't come yet.
She is coming nearer.

517
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,318
Why don't you tell me what it is?

518
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:49,398
Keep it as a secret. She is the
beautiful girl who came with us.

519
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,027
Hold this. Now, wait and watch.

520
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,369
Shyam surgeon in action.

521
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,176
Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,952
The world is round and small.
What do you have to say?

523
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,346
Small world.

524
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,552
You're just translating it.
Tell me the answer.

525
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,956
Oh.. what happened to you?

526
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,662
Spring door, it swung
and got stuck in it.

527
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,399
What was I telling you?
- I don't know.

528
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,028
Not you.
- Sorry. Sorry.

529
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:31,405
Small world. Isn't it?

530
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,634
How?

531
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,076
We met in Bangalore airport.

532
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,976
Then we met in the
plane flying in the sky.

533
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,078
Now.. lam in front of you..
you're in front of me..

534
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,487
It is a spring door. It
might swing. Come, this side.

535
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,719
Come. Come. Always,
center is the safe place.

536
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,500
Your name is Priya, isn't it?

537
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,163
Oh, Sharda, Ivlookambika, Ivlandodri?

538
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:01,563
Kali? Ivlahakali?

539
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,969
It is Priya.

540
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:05,939
Have you booked a room here?

541
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,545
Room is there, but
you're going this way..

542
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,446
That means are you going outside?

543
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,608
Ladies restroom.

544
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:18,312
Oh, even I am going there.
Same pinch.

545
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,421
I mean. gents.
It is just besides it.

546
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,617
Come, I'll accompany
you till there.

547
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,655
Highway.

548
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:30,963
This.

549
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,199
One lady coming.

550
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,600
Why did you come here?

551
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,974
Toilet.

552
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,976
This is ladies. where did she go?

553
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,073
She went in that.

554
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,352
That's gents.
Madam. madam don't start.

555
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,319
She isn't here. Ram?

556

Ram! Ram!

557
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,940
How was your journey by flight?

558
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,642
I swear nothing happened.
I met my old friend, Ram.

559
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,041
Did he come along with his family?

560
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,948
He isn't a fool like me.
He's come with his family.

561
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,679
It was just a joke.

562
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,148
I don't feel like laughing.

563
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,316
You'll feel it now.
- Still.

564
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,089
Thanks.

565
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,993
Wow! Wow! Priya, I
love you. I love you.

566
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,598
I am just waiting for the night.

567
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,433
Shut up.

568
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,478
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

569
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,680
"lt is time for the
thieves to start their work."

570
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,712
"Keep all your things carefully."

571
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,118
"Once you lose it,
you'll not find it again."

572
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,984
"Beware, the nightfall is here.
- Oh God."

573
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:34,285
"It is time for us to be awake
the whole night. - Be careful."

574
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,586
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

575
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,686
"It is time for us to be
awake the whole night."

576
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:43,093
"My heart. My heart
doesn't let me sleep..

577
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,294
...l am quiet, but
the heart is restless."

578
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:49,567
"Beware! Beware, the
nightfall is here."

579
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:56,204
"It is time for us to be
awake the whole night."

580
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,331
"Why? What does it do?"

581
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,926
"It catches your waist stealthily."

582
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:22,063
"It makes you dance on its tunes."

583
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,965
"Is it so'? TO hell With it."

584
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:28,471
"It doesn't get warm
even if you wear a blanket."

585
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,548
"It doesn't get wet
even if it rains."

586
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,947
"So, it means it is topsy-turvy?"

587
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,417
"It gives you an itching."

588
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,213
"It gives you an itching,
it makes you restless."

589
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,347
"Without the fire
the body becomes warm."

590
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:43,690
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

591
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:48,962
"It is time for us to be
awake the whole night."

592
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,091
"Look there!"

593
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:10,520
"Why does it act like this even
after so many years of marriage?"

594
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,919
"Who is the thief?"

595
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:16,222
"That thief is none other
than our love and affection."

596
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:19,195
"It is a real player."

597
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,525
"No matter if the house is small."

598
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,590
"There should be a
beautiful wife in it."

599
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,933
"So? What would've happened?"

600
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:28,666
"Heaven above."

601
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,267
"Heaven above would've
felt jealous about us."

602
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,469
"It doesn't have any desires."

603
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:36,480
"Catch, catch! Oh, drop."

604
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,073
"Beware, why are you shouting?"

605
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,350
"Why are you waking
him up? He's sleeping."

606
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:15,180
"Hey, he is very naughty."

607
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,921
"My body is yearning for you."

608
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:21,117
"Please, extinguish the fire in me."

609
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,485
"Do you know what happened here?"

610
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:29,399
"Don't tell me all these
things now. Even I am yearning."

611
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,196
"ls it so? It is good."

612
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,168
"If this Kind Of thief."

613
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:37,503
"lf this kind of thief is within us,
it doesn't leave husband and wife."

614
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,940
"Beware."

615
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,037
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

616
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,957
"Come to me. Come to me."

617
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:12,168
"Your face is like the flower
and your lips are like petals."

618
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,006
"Your face is like the flower.."
- Don't do that.

619
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,513
Don't do that. You can't do it.

620
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,246
I can't?
- I am telling you.

621
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,114
I can't? You're telling me?
- You can't do it. - I can't? - No.

622
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:30,552
What happened?

623
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,156
I have a sprain in my waist.

624
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,299
Don't do that. Let go off me.

625
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,935
What happened to you?

626
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,499
I sprained my waist.
Hey, don't touch me. Don't.

627
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:50,172
Sorry. Sorry. Be careful. Careful.

628
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:52,341
'Lord Shiva.'

629
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,142
Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

630
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:58,383
My husband has sprained his waist.
He is not able to move.

631
00:37:58,511 --> 00:37:59,683
Can you please send a doctor,
immediately?

632
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,626
Sorry, madam. The hotel
doctor has an off today.

633
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,323
Is there any doctor
amongst the guests in the hotel?

634
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,331
Just say 'Please' to him.

635
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,628
Please. can you please
check and let me know.

636
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:12,061
Okay. Anyway, I'll try.

637
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:14,332
Oh God.

638
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,975
Calling from reception.
Dr. Sajjans?

639
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:20,237
You were trying to be
a hero unnecessarily.

640
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,313
Hey, don't touch me.
- I am sorry. Sorry.

641
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:24,313
Have patience for some time.
The doctor will come.

642
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:27,907
When? Will he join the
college now and become a doctor?

643
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,246
By the time he comes, I'll
massage you with hot water.

644
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,913
Okay? You'll get some
relief with it.

645
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,301
Come, it is open.

646
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,335
The door is open. Please, come in.

647
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,066
Hello..

648
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:00,110
...show me your tongue. Please.

649
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:04,953
Hey Ram.
- Shyam, what are you doing here?

650
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:08,255
I got a call that they
need doctor in this room.

651
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,185
You're a doctor? How?

652
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,390
Hey fool, I studied for five years.

653
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,429
Seeing you, no one will
take you to be a doctor.

654
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,092
Do you expect me to hang
the certificate around my neck..

655
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:17,225
...and roam about?

656
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,968
Don't touch me. I've
sprained my waist.

657
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,300
Warrior, what great feat did you
do that your waist got sprained?

658
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,201
Nothing, pal.

659
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,471
Then why are you
acting as BKS lyengar?

660
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:31,208
I tried lifting the bed.

661
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,143
Didn't you have any
other better work to do?

662
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,709
One sleeps on the bed at midnight.

663
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:38,179
One shouldn't lift it.

664
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:40,548
Does it pain here?
- No, not there.

665
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,993
Does it pain here?
- No, not much.

666
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,186
Not here, right?
- No, not there.

667
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,192
Very good. Now, I
understand your problem.

668
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,400
The pain is here, isn't it? - Why
do you have to press it so hard?

669
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:54,069
That's the point. Lumbosacral area.

670
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,605
God should save you now.

671
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,107
Turn this side.
- No, I can't.

672
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,404
You can..

673
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,068
Best position for a
gynecologist like me.

674
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,244
What are you doing?

675
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,052
Do you have pain here?
ls it still there?

676
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:11,412
It'll vanish soon.

677
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:17,120
Typical. Relax. Relax.
Fetal position. Fetal.

678
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,254
Best position.

679
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:24,029
Be in the same position.
Tell me how it feels.

680
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,665
I feel that you're not a doctor.

681
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,063
Why not?

682
00:40:29,562 --> 00:40:30,973
Let me give you a hot water
massage and will show you..

683
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,668
...what kind of a doctor I am.

684
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,375
How will hot water help me?

685
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,672
With a little bit of hot water,
I can even deliver babies.

686
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,278
You want me to deliver one for you?

687
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:41,508
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Nothing to worry.

688
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,710
Where's the bathroom?

689
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:45,455
Don't go there. Don't
go there, Shyam! Shyam!

690
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:50,353
Oh sorry. I didn't know
it was occupied. Continue.

691
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,530
Hey, the same beautiful girl
who we met in the flight.

692
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:56,691
Bathroom.

693
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:02,005
You sinner, you
brought her from Bangalore.

694
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,474
Now I know why
you've sprained your back.

695
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,600
Shut up.

696
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,375
I will, but you've kept
everything secret till now.

697
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,174
In the bathroom.
please, come. Come.

698
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:11,439
We were talking about you.

699
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:12,948
Ram.. how are you feeling now'?

700
00:41:14,073 --> 00:41:16,019
Hello.
- Hello.

701
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,013
Small world.
- Yes, small world.

702
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:22,548
Too small for three people.
- Sorry. Sorry.

703
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:23,958
What is it?
- It is hot water for massage.

704
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:27,288
For him.. if you give
me some place. I will..

705
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,964
Wait, if you give him
such boiling water massage..

706
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:31,160
...his waist will melt
like the butter.

707
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:33,365
You move, I'll take care of him.

708
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,300
I am a doctor.
- Really?

709
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:40,977
Why don't you tell her?
- He calls himself as one.

710
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,381
I don't call myself as one.
I've studied for five years.

711
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,248
Fine, move. And..
you're allergic to?

712
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,511
You..

713
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,422
I understand, hero..
because I am a man.

714
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,152
I'll give him Diclofenac injection.

715
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:57,688
Nothing to worry, isn't it?

716
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,293
You've come here with him.
Why should I fear?

717
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:02,491
No.. his condition.
Nothing to worry, right?

718
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:04,924
He'll be fine with this injection.

719
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:06,128
No. no..

720
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,261
It is for the pain.

721
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:10,307
Hey, don't inject me there.
Inject me on my hand.

722
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,000
Are you feeling shy?

723
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,072
Are you feeling shy?
- No.

724
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:17,043
She is not shying, why are
you then? Show it to her.

725
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,344
Doctor, you injected him so hard.

726
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,152
What's the use if I inject
him in the superficial layer?

727
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,582
An injection has to be
pierced inside.

728
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,617
Are you done with it?
- Yes, almost done.

729
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:33,960
Rub it. Rub it.

730
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,692
You leave him.
He'll rub it himself.

731
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:43,039
Hey, three days.
You shouldn't move.

732
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:46,076
Iam telling you.
Be in the fetal position.

733
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:50,413
Not you, for him. Good night.

734
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,672
Good night. Good night.

735
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:54,649
Ram, is it hurting?

736
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,315
No problem. Please, be seated.

737
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:03,525
I'll tell you. Meet me in
the restaurant tomorrow.

738
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,929
Alone.. I'll give you one more shot.

739
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,292
Good night, I shall leave now.

740
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:24,971
She is beautiful.

741
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:27,482
She's not only beautiful,
but smart too.

742
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:30,149
I could understand that when
I knew that she fell for you.

743
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:31,312
Don't feel jealous.

744
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,081
Why should I feel jealous?

745
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:36,991
She is very, very intelligent. So,
I like her company a lot.

746
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,392
Yes, you're a big scientist.

747
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:40,964
You both are going to
research on something.

748
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,125
I saw the result of
your research last night.

749
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,430
Hey, why are you doing
like this in the public?

750
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:47,628
Behave yourself.

751
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:52,371
Okay, does she know that
you're married and have children?

752
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,201
She thinks that I am
not a married man.

753
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:56,302
Then you have to make
it clear to her.

754
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:57,672
You should've told her that
you're a father of two children.

755
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,016
You're talking as though,
you'll reveal everything to her.

756
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:04,145
Look, you shouldn't hide
anything from your lover and doctor.

757
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,287
It is okay if you hide
things from your wife.

758
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:10,659
But, tell it to her.

759
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,527
What do you expect me to tell her?

760
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:14,190
That you're father of two children.

761
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:16,459
You've already sprained your waist.

762
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:17,992
Don't know what else
will get sprained.

763
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,361
She caught you.

764
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,398
Cheers.

765
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:30,045
You're drinking her left over.
ls this permanent?

766
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,447
Nothing like that, pal.
- Then, will you leave her?

767
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:36,281
Hey, no. Let it continue as it is.

768
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:40,651
One thing. Don't
tell anyone about this.

769
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,083
Mainly to your wife.

770
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,022
I am different.
- What ways?

771
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:46,294
I always maintain a
distance in these matters.

772
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:48,695
I am different. I can't
tell you more than this.

773
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:50,968
Have you met my wife?
- No.

774
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,466
Come in the afternoon.
We'll have lunch together.

775
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,368
Okay. We'll go to Chinese.
Priya loves Chinese.

776
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:59,200
Then why is she flirting
with an Indian guy like you?

777
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:00,639
I am talking about Chinese food.

778
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:03,941
But one thing, don't come with her.

779
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:05,514
What if she accompanies me?

780
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,984
Even I'll be trashed along with you.

781
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:10,144
My wife knows all the
details about your wedding.

782
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,050
Very good.
- I am full.

783
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:13,652
Don't waste. Drink it.

784
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,421
Don't drink that.
That's her left over.

785
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:27,927
Hey.. look what is
he doing. Greet him.

786
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:30,164
Hi.

787
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:32,470
Hi? Hey son, he's my friend.

788
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,238
So, he is your uncle Ram.
Click our snap. - Click it.

789
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:36,371
One minute.

790
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,549
Do you think I am
taking a still photograph?

791
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,949
Walk around talking something.

792
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,680
Say something. Friend, you were
delivering dialogues till now.

793
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,216
Your father was a famous actor.

794
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,990
I was hero in all the
plays of my college. - Yes.

795
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,059
He used to create a
chaos in the whole college.

796
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:52,186
Who'?
- You.

797
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:53,421
Hey, come on. Start.

798
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:55,960
Can I tell a famous dialogue,
which is..

799
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,501
...love is greater than everything.
- Yes, come on.

800
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,292
Make it fast.

801
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,895
You are the one who
thought me to love.

802
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:04,173
Fool, love is priceless.

803
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,236
This love is from many eras.
People loved each other very much.

804
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,642
You're very fortunate. - Uncle Ram,
you're going out of the frame.

805
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:10,937
Left.
- Their..

806
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,107
Left. Left.

807
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:14,475
Left? This way?
- Left.

808
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:15,643
Should I come into the left?

809
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:17,415
You couldn't complete
the dialogue on stage.

810
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:18,546
Why do you strain yourself now?

811
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:19,987
Take, okay.

812
00:46:20,412 --> 00:46:22,050
Have you recorded that?
- Yes. - Cool, cool.

813
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,924
Didn't I tell you, your father used
to create a chaos in the college?

814
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,020
Hey, the camera is on.
Don't talk rubbish. Come on.

815
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:31,029
Wow. Sania Ivlirza, English remake.

816
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:34,162
It is so nice.

817
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:38,097
Purse? It is nice.

818
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:39,433
How much for this?

819
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:40,568
1200 rupees.

820
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,168
How much is he saying?

821
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:43,337
Rupees 1200, mother.

822
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,339
Is it made up of cow skin'?

823
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,608
Is it made of cow skin'?
- Yes. Yes.

824
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:50,950
To hell with you. If you give
rupees 1200 in our village.

825
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,488
...you can buy a pair of cows.

826
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,420
Ask him whether he'll give it to
me for rupees 400? - Rupees 400?

827
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,119
600? - Hey, no 6 or 4.
I'll give you rupees 400.

828
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,289
Will you give it to me? Yes or no?
- Okay.

829
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:03,897
Look at his style. He
thought I am a village woman.

830
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:05,333
“So, he wanted to fool me.

831
00:47:05,424 --> 00:47:07,028
Take. Enjoy.

832
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:09,367
Bhanu, how did you
tell all that in phone'?

833
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:10,965
Keep the phone. Bye.

834
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,903
Kannada?
- Yes.

835
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:14,902
Even I am a Kannadiga.

836
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,044
My name is Shanti and he's my son.

837
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:19,104
My husband and we have
come to Goa for holiday.

838
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,408
Very cute.
- Thanks.

839
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,209
What about you?
- I'm from Bangalore.

840
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:23,578
I guessed it right.

841
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:25,146
What are you doing in Goa?

842
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:30,653
I know.. you would've come
here with your boyfriend. Jolly..

843
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:33,190
No, lam here for my training.

844
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,596
Which train? - Not train, but
training. Airhostess training.

845
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:41,200
I know. You're an airhostess,
aren't you? - Yes.

846
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,036
She gives chocolates in the flight.
She is an airhostess. Got it?

847
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:45,333
Don't you have your train today?

848
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:47,570
Oh, today is an off.

849
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:51,172
Then why don't you
join for lunch today?

850
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,440
Even we are in the same hotel.

851
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:53,642
No, I have some work..

852
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:56,112
Don't refuse. It is very
difficult to find Kannadigas here.

853
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,120
Please.
- Okay.

854
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:00,922
Thank you. Don't forget.

00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,566
Sit quietly.
- Do you work?

857
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,899
Sorry, sir.

858
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,031
Enough.

859
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,908
Where is our lovely son?

860
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,536
He must be shooting in the vicinity.

861
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,005
He'll be here in any moment.

862
00:48:25,938 --> 00:48:29,078
I don't know if he was a
sculpture in his previous birth.

863
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,579
He only shoots beautiful girls.

864
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:39,053
Hi.

865
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,656
Come. Come. Airhostess.

866
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,201
Listen, she is an airhostess.
My friend, Priya.

867
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,436
Her job is to distribute
chocolates in the flight.

868
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,204
Greet her.
- Hello.

869
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:54,572
Not me, to her.

870
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:55,974
Hello.
- Hello.

871
00:48:56,168 --> 00:48:57,238
Please, have a seat.

872
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,481
He is my husband, Dr. Shyam Sajjan.

873
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,610
Hello.
- Hello.

874
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:05,018
He gets angry when I
address him as a doctor.

875
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:07,480
He helps females delivering babies.

876
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,558
You call such people as. dinosaur.

877
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,555
It is gynecologist.
- Yes, he is a very good dinosaur.

878
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,423
Hey, look at my friend. She
is here on the correct time.

879
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,628
Where is your friend,
not to be seen?

880
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,169
Go, there's a phone in the room.

881
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,298
Yes, I'll call him.

882
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,580
My husband is such.
He panics when he sees girls.

883
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,485
Yes?
- I have to make a call.

884
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,611
Yes, sure sir.

885
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:41,548
Connection? Wireless.

886
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:46,529
He is well educated, but I've
studied only till fifth standard.

887
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,061
Is yours a love marriage?

888
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,266
Sort of.. I went to him as
a patient, but he made me a parent.

889
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:56,606
Hello. Message.

890
00:49:57,729 --> 00:49:59,538
Hey.
- Hi. - I was trying to call you.

891
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:01,669
I am here.
- You shouldn't have come.

892
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:03,273
Uncle, come on. Let's go.

893
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:04,939
Hey, no. no.

894
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,212
Mother, this is uncle Ram.

895
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:09,679
Hello.
- Hello.

896
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:12,679
She is my friend, Priya.

897
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:14,684
Hello.
- Hello.

898
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:20,027
Please, have a seat. Have a seat.

899
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:22,558
Sorry. Please, move.

900
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,968
Hey, you told me about some
man who sprained his waist.

901
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,630
...tell that to them. Let
them have a good laugh.

902
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:32,233
Hey, what are you doing?

903
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:33,707
My son. Do you remember him?

904
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,103
Why are you sweating so much?

905
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:38,974
The AC isn't working, so we
both are sweating profusely.

906
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:40,141
Do you have a headache?

907
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,377
No, not I, he has.

908
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,044
I mean. I'll tell you.

909
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:44,985
Order whatever you want.

910
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:46,649
Tea or coffee.

911
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,213
Hey, we've invited them for lunch.

912
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,189
Yes. Yes. Give me the menu.

913
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:52,386
It was here. Get up. Get up.

914
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,520
Where?

915
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:59,001
You're sitting on it. Hey brother,
give me another menu.

916
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,228
Thanks. Thanks.

917
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,230
This is so small.

918
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,967
All are North Indian dishes.
She likes only Chinese.

919
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,236
How do you know?

920
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:10,369
He..

921
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:14,279
Do you know her?

922
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:19,612
No.. - No, he doesn't know.
Do you know him?

923
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:21,516
No..
- No.

924
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,954
Then, how did you know'?

925
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:29,361
Yes, menu.. her eyes are round..

926
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:33,297
Round eyed people usually
have a liking for Chinese.

927
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:34,962
Chinese.
- Chinese food.

928
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,130
It was there in the newspaper.

929
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:38,238
Yes, it is a Chinese fact.
- Yes, it is.

930
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:39,969
Whatever. I've studied only
till fifth standard and you..

931
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:41,306
...are a dinosaur.

932
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:45,106
Hey, what? Go from here.

933
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,353
Shall I order?
- Yes, take this. Order it.

934
00:51:53,412 --> 00:51:55,016
Do you want water?
- No.

935
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,432
I don't want to return
to Bangalore tomorrow.

936
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:09,333
Don't worry. Till we return,
we'll have our flat ready.

937
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:11,465
You can become naughty there.

938
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:32,118
Peddusn
- You returned?

939
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,622
Why are you doing all this?
Are servants dead?

940
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,296
I thought if I work, it
will be like exercising.

941
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,426
No need to do all this.
Get up. Get up. Get up.

942
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,996
Why do you want to e><ercise and all?

943
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,969
My should be chubby
and sweet like you.

944
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:49,470
It doesn't look good
if you become slim.

945
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,406
Did you finish your work?

946
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,243
Why do you ask? I had
a lot of work to do.

947
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:56,149
I had to work for all the 24 hours.

948
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:59,552
Some client, meeting
with him, with him..

949
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:00,988
By the time I finished all that.

950
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,116
Did you sprain your waist?

951
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,256
No, lam very tired. It
was a very tiring trip.

952
00:53:05,317 --> 00:53:06,387
Go and get freshen up.

953
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,521
I've prepared hot
steamed pancakes for you.

954
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:10,031
You would've lost your appetite
by eating out from three days.

955
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:12,227
Yes.. what? Coming.

956
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,214
How did it come in this suitcase?

957
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:41,495
This.. this.. there were many
monkeys in the hotel I stayed.

958
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,964
These monkeys used to take
their luggage and put it..

959
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:47,265
...in our room and our
luggage into somebody else's room.

960
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,570
It took my pants and put
it in the swimming pool.

961
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:56,677
So sad, someone's nighty.
They've put it in my suitcase.

962
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:59,676
It doesn't belong to anyone. I bought
this from the national market.

963
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:01,006
How is it?

964
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:06,087
Oh, you bought it? It is very nice.

965
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:10,920
Buy more nighties,
sleevless, full sleeve, full neck..

966
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:13,155
...full embroidery, buy everything.

967
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:15,626
Thank God, I thought something else.

968
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,526
If I knew, I would've
bought 4-5 nighties from Goa.

969
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,102
Goa? You said you went to Delhi?

970
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:23,373
Delhi.
- But you said Goa just now.

971
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,236
The city was Delhi, but
the hotel's name was Goa.

972
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,470
How is it possible?

973
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:30,945
Why not? If you say
Ivlysorepak (Sweet).

974
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,346
...do you expect Mysore
to be inside'?

975
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,281
They say Udupi Hotel, but it
is in every city. The same way.

976
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,116
It was hotel Goa International.
It can be anywhere.

977
00:54:38,176 --> 00:54:41,623
London, Germany, Bombay, it
will be everywhere except Goa.

978
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,221
I just asked you about the nighty.

979
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,619
It is not nice. It is dirty.

980
00:54:46,151 --> 00:54:47,960
I am returning very
tired after three days.

981
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,692
...how dare you ask
me about the nighty?

982
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,632
How much did you pay for this?
- Rupees 250.

983
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,170
Rupees 250? Return this
nighty and buy me a loin cloth.

984
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,362
Come and lay the food for me.

985
00:54:57,062 --> 00:54:58,336
Oh God.

986
00:55:05,904 --> 00:55:07,941
Hello.
- Hi, what are you doing?

987
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,515
Hello, Ms. World.

988
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:14,482
What?
- I said; you're my world.

989
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,257
Goa trip has made you a poet.

990
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,191
What else? - You have to
have dinner with me tonight.

991
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:23,991
Anything special?
- Yes.

992
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:25,967
Ms. World's birthday today.

993
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:28,595
Hey, many many happy
returns of the day.

994
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,331
I'll give you thousand
kisses as gift.

995
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,667
Is it a personal delivery or
send it through the courier boy?

996
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:36,445
Very, very personal delivery.

997
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:38,572
How about some advance?

998
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,174
Oh sure.

999
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,487
Okay. See you, date. Bye.

1000
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:03,164
Hey, stop there. Take this.
- What is it, father?

1001
00:56:03,495 --> 00:56:05,168
What is it?
- Your darling.

1002
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,400
Why are you giving it to me?

1003
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:09,536
I think it is sick. It
didn't have food since morning.

1004
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:11,608
You're going out. Why don't
you take it out for a stroll?

1005
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:13,246
It might feel a little better.

1006
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,443
Father, I am going
out for office work.

1007
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,043
It won't disturb you at all.
You can do the work.

1008
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:19,520
It will sit quiet somewhere.

1009
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:22,124
But.
- Take it!

1010
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,020
Grandpa, shall
I go along with daddy?

1011
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:27,154
Yes, leave.

1012
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,288
He has exams. Let him study.

1013
00:56:28,353 --> 00:56:29,423
Even he'll feel fresh.
- No, let him stay here.

1014
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,591
Grandpa, I want to go with him.

1015
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,559
Let him leave, dear.

1016
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,573
Hi, Ms. World.
- Wow!

1017
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:40,434
Happy birthday.

1018
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:41,967
So sweet.

1019
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,335
I've brought a friend
along with me. Greet her.

1020
00:56:45,537 --> 00:56:47,380
"Who let the dogs out?"

1021
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,143
"Who let the dogs out?"

1022
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,278
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

1023
00:56:51,343 --> 00:56:53,084
Please, tie the dog somewhere.

1024
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:54,680
"Who let the dogs out?"

1025
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,023
Please, tie the dog somewhere.
I am scared. Please!

1026
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:59,187
"Who let the dogs out?"
- Hey, okay. No problem.

1027
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,165
Hey, many many happy
returns of the day.

1028
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,298
Yes. Yes.

1029
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:13,936
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1030
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:18,036
Thank you.

1031
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,109
So'?
- So'?

1032
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:23,210
What next?
- What next?

1033
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:38,393
Hello. - It is me. Accounts
manager Shrikhant Ivlurthy speaking.

1034
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:40,600
Give the phone to your husband.

1035
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,199
Sir, he went to your house.

1036
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,673
I had told him that I am leaving
to Thirupati with my family.

1037
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:48,972
Sir, try on his mobile.

1038
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:51,946
I tried to call on his
mobile many times, but couldn't..

1039
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,040
...get him, so I called at home.

1040
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,112
Fine, tell him to call
me as soon as he returns.

1041
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:58,245
Okay, I'll tell him, sir.

1042
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,887
Who is it, mother?
- No one, go to sleep.

1043
00:58:22,534 --> 00:58:25,208
What happened?
- I have to reach home immediately.

1044
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:28,382
At such late hour?
- Father is a diabetic.

1045
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:29,509
I have to give him
an insulin injection.

1046
00:58:30,141 --> 00:58:32,246
Sorry. Bye. Bye.

1047
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,238
Who is it?
- It is me. Hurry up.

1048
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,071
Darling.
- Yes.

1049
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:59,647
Not you.. darling. One minute.

1050
00:59:00,672 --> 00:59:05,018
Come, darling. You
should've reminded me at least.

1051
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,013
Good night.

1052
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:18,225
Come. Come.

1053
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,363
Hey Bhama. How are you?
ls everything fine?

1054
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,494
Did you have your food?

1055
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,402
Yes. Where did you
both go for a stroll?

1056
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:25,499
Where had you been?

1057
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,200
Didn't I tell you, I had
been to Shrikhanta's house?

1058
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:28,709
Okay. ls your work done?

1059
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,310
Shrikhanta is genius in accounts.
- Yes, genius.

1060
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:32,574
Is everyone fine at home?

1061
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:33,980
Yes, absolutely fine.

1062
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,312
Everyone at his
house asked me about you.

1063
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:38,582
They gave me sweets to eat.
It was wonderful.

1064
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:40,456
Did they throw the
sweet from Thirupati?

1065
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:44,721
What? - Don't lie, he called me
Thirupati. Did you go to his house?

1066
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:47,996
Did he call you'? I told him to
call Bhama and let her know..

1067
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:50,555
...that I'll be coming late.
Very good. Very good.

1068
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:57,501
Listen. Listen. Tell me,
where had you been?

1069
00:59:58,396 --> 01:00:01,377
Where else can I go? I went out,
father handed over the dog to me.

1070
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:03,034
On the third cross
was Shrikhanta's house.

1071
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,541
What is it?
- I just told you.

1072
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:09,409
I couldn't hear it clearly.

1073
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,551
I went out from here.
- Okay.

1074
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,111
Father handed over the dog to me.
- Okay.

1075
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,020
On the third cross was
Shrikhanta's house. - Okay.

1076
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,227
You said everything correctly,
but main..

1077
01:00:19,317 --> 01:00:20,387
Serve me food.

1078
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,294
You're missing the main point.

1079
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,693
Which main point?

1080
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:25,298
Tell me correctly.

1081
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,460
Okay, I'll tell you. Serve
me some curry. - Yes, curry.

1082
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,662
Tell me.
- The curry is delicious.

1083
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,998
Not that, you had been somewhere..

1084
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:33,999
I went out from here.
- Okay.

1085
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:35,406
Father handed over the dog to me.
- Okay.

1086
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,979
On the third cross was
Shrikhanta's house. - Okay.

1087
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,478
I went there and..

1088
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:42,143
You said everything correctly.

1089
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,610
Serve me some vegetables.

1090
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:49,151
You said everything correctly,
but main point is missing.

1091
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,385
Do you want me to have
dinner or not?

1092
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:52,325
Yes, please. You can talk
as well as eat, can't you?

1093
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,620
What do you want to hear?

1094
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:55,255
I went out from here. Father
handed over the dog to me.

1095
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,389
On the third cross
was Shrikhanta's house.

1096
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:57,557
By the time I went there.

1097
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,364
You're making a mistake again.

1098
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,597
The main point is missing.
Don't have food now.

1099
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:04,338
Tell me.
- What do you want to know?

1100
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:05,668
What happened, where did you go?

1101
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,170
I went out from here.
- Okay.

1102
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:09,038
Father handed over the dog to me.
- Okay.

1103
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,478
On the third cross was
Shrikhanta's house. - Okay.

1104
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:13,472
Have some water.

1105
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:19,546
Enough, I don't want to eat now.
I've told you many times.

1106
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,453
I heard everything,
but the main point.

1107
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,616
That's not my problem.

1108
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,191
The main point is getting missed.

1109
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:28,021
Listen to me.

1110
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:40,166
What is it?

1111
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,506
You haven't told me the truth yet.

1112
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,480
I've already told you that I
went out from here. - Okay.

1113
01:01:44,669 --> 01:01:46,012
And..
- Father handed over the dog to you.

1114
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:48,575
On the third cross
was Shrikhanta's house.

1115
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:50,210
Tell me what happened next?

1116
01:01:50,308 --> 01:01:51,378
Then..

1117
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:55,649
Hey, what are you doing?

1118
01:01:56,314 --> 01:01:57,987
When you have to tell the truth,
you were eating..

1119
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:00,290
...you were hiding
your face in the shirt.

1120
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,589
Now let me see how you
hide your face. Tell me.

1121
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:04,928
Tell me what happened next?

1122
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:08,266
Actually, I went from here..
- Okay.

1123
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:10,600
Father handed over the dog to me.
- Okay.

1124
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:12,599
On the third cross
was Shrikhanta's house.

1125
01:02:13,364 --> 01:02:16,072
I don't want to hear all that.
Tell me what happened next.

1126
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:18,945
From there.
- From there?

1127
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:35,061
Listen.. listen..

1128
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:38,591
What happened?
- Where had you been?

1129
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:40,093
Is this a question to
ask at such late hour?

1130
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,330
I'll tell you later.
- Tell me now.

1131
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,303
I am a man. I can go anywhere.

1132
01:02:44,362 --> 01:02:45,432
Do I have to tell you
each and every thing?

1133
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,510
Shaman. Shaman. shut up.

1134
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:51,503
Where had you been?

1135
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:55,711
I went out from here.
- Okay.

1136
01:02:57,008 --> 01:03:00,649
Father handed over the dog to me.
- I don't want to hear that.

1137
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,048
Tell me what happened next.

1138
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,956
I am coming to the point.

1139
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:10,229
Actually. I told you that I
have a friend.. Shyam Sajjan.

1140
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:11,931
The gynecologist?
- Yes.

1141
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:16,065
He acts weird since college days.
- Like'?

1142
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,935
He wants to watch cabaret,
blue films, and wants to..

1143
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,941
...go to the live bands.
It is his weakness.

1144
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:24,237
Darn. - I know.
He called me in the evening.

1145
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:28,610
He said, there's a new cabaret
in town, let's go and watch it.

1146
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,078
What? - Even I hadn't
seen all this in life..

1147
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:37,421
So, I felt like seeing it. It is
12 years since we are marrieci.

1148
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:39,587
If I tell you to do cabaret.
- Oh Lord.

1149
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,459
I am not telling you to do cabaret.

1150
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:43,963
Do you expect me to tell you
that I am going to cabaret.

1151
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,193
...take care of the
children and yourself?

1152
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:49,402
So, I lied to you that I am
going to meet accounts officer.

1153
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,702
Shame on you. You had been
to watch cabaret? - Yes.

1154
01:03:53,064 --> 01:03:54,475
Listen, I am sorry. - Come on,
get up. go and have bath.

1155
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:56,602
Hey, don't touch me.
Go and have bath first.

1156
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,112
Who'll have bath at such late hour?

1157
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:59,580
I don't care. Go and
have bath. Come on.

1158
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:02,342
That's all.

1159
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,653
Fold your hands in front of God.

1160
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:21,937
Welcome. You've come
along with your family..

1161
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,130
...what's special occasion today'?

1162
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:24,264
Today is our wedding anniversary.

1163
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:25,432
Okay, how long are you married'?

1164
01:04:25,496 --> 01:04:26,566
Priest, we've been
married for 12 years.

1165
01:04:26,664 --> 01:04:27,938
Perform veneration on behalf of us.

1166
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:29,269
What's your name?

1167
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,368
<i>Gaurl.
- Raw.</i>

1168
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:31,538
Very good.

1169
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,619
May you prosper in life.

1170
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:46,519
Daddy, do you Know how
to enact like an elephant?

1171
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:47,654
Yes.

1172
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:02,133
I never thought that you
would cheat me this way.

1173
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:04,913
You're not only married,
but have two children too.

1174
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:07,474
Priya. actually.

1175
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:08,608
Shut up, Ram!

1176
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:15,421
I had many desires.
Do you know that?

1177
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:18,587
Please, don't cry priya. Don't cry.

1178
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:23,496
What do I do? I've been
married for 12 years now.

1179
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:27,195
Not even one day I lived happily.

1180
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,670
The first day of my wedding I came
to know that my wife was insane.

1181
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:36,944
"She fell."

1182
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:39,038
She fights with me
for every small reason.

1183
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:40,444
She hits me with
anything she gets in hand.

1184
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:42,548
Priya, she is suffering
from hysteria.

1185
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:49,215
So, I had a hope that she
would become all right someday.

1186
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:51,949
Twelve years. I
thought I would leave her..

1187
01:05:52,016 --> 01:05:57,193
...but those two kids. Poor children,
what wrong have they done?

1188
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,463
I thought why I should orphan them.

1189
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:02,534
So, I continued to live with it.

1190
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:07,034
One fine day I found you.

1191
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,900
You came into my life
like happiness.

1192
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:14,909
And when I saw you I fell in
love with you. I am sorry.

1193
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:19,385
I misused you for my own purpose.

1194
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:21,114
I am really sorry.

1195
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,220
Tell me what should I do now?

1196
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:26,019
I will not talk to you
if you want to.

1197
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:29,092
I will even not see
you if you want to.

1198
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,935
But don't ask me to
forget you, Priya.

1199
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:35,565
It is not possible by me, Priya.

1200
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,035
I cannot live without you, Priya.

1201
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,234
I will die rather.

1202
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,577
I Will die.

1203
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,544
Come on.
- Whose house is it?

1204
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:54,681
It belongs to one of
my family friend.

1205
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,249
They are very good people.

1206
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,093
He's my friend's son.
He's very naughty.

1207
01:07:01,886 --> 01:07:02,956
Sister Jyoti.

1208
01:07:03,554 --> 01:07:05,363
Who is she?
- She's Bhamamani.

1209
01:07:05,423 --> 01:07:06,561
She is a close friend of mine.

1210
01:07:06,624 --> 01:07:08,103
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Come in.

1211
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:12,898
He desires to make a film like
'Titanic'. Come in. Have a seat.

1212
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:14,341
Hey. Where are you going?

1213
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,341
I want to check the video I shot.

1214
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,942
Today he talked about 'Titanic'.

1215
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:22,143
Yesterday he was
talking about 'Aptamitra'.

1216
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:27,118
With the zest he lifted his father's
bed and his father slipped down.

1217
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:28,956
Oh God. - Tell me, what about you?

1218
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,916
So, what is your husband doing?
- He..

1219
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:32,927
He just keeps
pampering her all the time.

1220
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:36,931
She and her husband are
like made for each other.

1221
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:39,092
You are too much. "Thunderstorm! "

1222
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:40,226
"Thunderstorm!"

1223
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:44,929
Stop that! Stop that!
- Let they all see.

1224
01:07:44,996 --> 01:07:46,066
Let it be. It is nice.
- Oh God..

1225
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,440
"Thunderstorm! Thunderstorm!"

1226
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:49,569
Stop that. Forward that.

1227
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,136
Didn't I tell you, forward it.
- Okay.

1228
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:56,544
We had been to Goa, he
shot all that there.

1229
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:57,677
It is nice.

1230
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:03,153
Hey, everything in
Goa has been recorded.

1231
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:07,090
Wow, Sania. English remake.

1232
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:10,195
This is the hotel we
stayed in. it is a 7 star hotel.

1233
01:08:14,225 --> 01:08:16,501
Hey, your husband.
- Yes.

1234
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,972
Is he your husband?
- Yes.

1235
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,509
He is my husband's best friend.
- ls it so?

1236
01:08:22,032 --> 01:08:23,409
Hi.
- Hi.

1237
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:28,510
Bhama.

1238
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:29,642
Dinosaur, Shaman.

1239
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:30,977
Who is she?

1240
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,981
'A good news early in the morning.'

1241
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:39,519
Hey, what's this?

1242
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:48,062
These both stayed in our hotel.

1243
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,562
I introduced them both.

1244
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:53,465
Look, how they've
mingled with each other.

1245
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:55,976
These men are like this.

1246
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:12,958
Hey!
- Who was that beautiful girl?

1247
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:17,125
She isn't a beautiful girl,
but an insane girl.

1248
01:09:17,288 --> 01:09:19,962
She is half mad. We both
traveled in the same plane.

1249
01:09:20,024 --> 01:09:21,094
Same plane?

1250
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:23,964
Same plane, but she is an
airhostess and she was in..

1251
01:09:24,028 --> 01:09:26,702
...the front with the pilot and
I was in the last row behind.

1252
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:30,070
An old lady next to me was
chewing tobacco. That old lady.

1253
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,204
Forget that old lady
and come to the point.

1254
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:36,985
I'll tell you. We both
were in the same hotel.

1255
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,111
Same hotel?

1256
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,452
Same hotel, but not the same room.

1257
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:44,251
I was at the 21st floor
and she was at the 1st floor.

1258
01:09:44,315 --> 01:09:46,295
There was a difference
of 2O floors in between.

1259
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,229
The hotel didn't even have a lift,
how will I meet her, tell me'?

1260
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:52,165
I saw she putting hand on you.

1261
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:55,997
That's the point. You saw
she putting hand on me..

1262
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,404
...but did you see I
putting hand on her?

1263
01:09:58,596 --> 01:10:00,940
Actually. - Did you see
me putting hand on her?

1264
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:04,174
I am remembering.. - Did you see
me putting hand on her'?

1265
01:10:04,235 --> 01:10:05,942
No, it is impossible.

1266
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:09,944
How is it possible? I
haven't seen anyone besides you.

1267
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:11,247
You both were embracing each other.

1268
01:10:11,309 --> 01:10:13,448
I saw it with my own
eyes in the video. - Video.

1269
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,357
It is all graphics.
- Who is she now?

1270
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:22,021
Graphics. we had been to
a movie where the hero..

1271
01:10:22,086 --> 01:10:25,295
...was flying in the song.
- Yes, he was.

1272
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:27,969
Do you think those birds
were from the bird sanctuary?

1273
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:31,529
It is a computer bird. They've
used graphic in it. - ls it?

1274
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:32,665
You can do many things
in a computer.

1275
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,171
The short guy has done
the same thing.

1276
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,270
I was here and she was there.

1277
01:10:37,368 --> 01:10:38,403
He has brought both of us together.

1278
01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:39,971
That shorty is a sinner.

1279
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:42,408
You know what happened one day?

1280
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:45,486
He placed a gorilla's head
in place of his father's.

1281
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,250
Oh God.
- He had fi><ed a tail to his mother.

1282
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,650
Look, what he has done
to me through graphics.

1283
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:55,395
So, it means you
didn't see her at all.

1284
01:10:55,453 --> 01:10:59,663
I did see. I will tell you the truth.

1285
01:11:00,024 --> 01:11:03,528
Bhama, I promise.. I saw her
and said hello, how are you'?

1286
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:05,938
She just greeted me in return.
That's it. - Is it?

1287
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:08,943
That's it! Not even an
inch more than that.

1288
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:12,946
It was like going into the bar
and drinking water. - ls it?

1289
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,313
I swear on God, I didn't
do anything other than that.

1290
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,180
If you think this is wrong, I'll fall
on your feet and ask for apology.

1291
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,682
I told you to accompany me, but
you said it would be expensive.

1292
01:11:18,943 --> 01:11:20,013
From now on I'll accompany you.

1293
01:11:20,211 --> 01:11:21,451
Forget it, it will be expensive.

1294
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:27,051
But. to tell you the fact.
I missed you in Goa.

1295
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:28,454
Goa?

1296
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:32,425
Hotel Goa, in Delhi..
- Like the mysorepak.

1297
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,199
I missed you very, very much.

1298
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:38,062
I love you so much, but
you always doubt on me.

1299
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:41,200
I am very sorry, dear.
Forgive me. I made a mistake.

1300
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:43,673
Oh Lord Thimappa, forgive me.

1301
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:57,615
Hello. - Aunt, Bhama's
husband is having an affair.

1302
01:11:57,681 --> 01:12:00,252
I saw it with my own
eyes in the video.

1303
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:03,193
Jyothi, don't you
have better work to do.

1304
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:06,134
Every family faces
some or other problem.

1305
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,931
You are telling it
in the whole village.

1306
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:09,596
...are you out of your mind?

1307
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:13,632
It is a very bad habit
to talk about others.

1308
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:14,966
Disconnect the phone now.

1309
01:12:19,136 --> 01:12:22,140
Bhama, this is not
only your problem.

1310
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,351
Every house has the
same story to tell.

1311
01:12:24,942 --> 01:12:26,580
This is the fact of life.

1312
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:30,282
He told her it was graphic,
she agreed to it.

1313
01:12:30,481 --> 01:12:33,018
He has given you a
good name 'Peddus' (fool)

1314
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,619
I thought it wasn't true.

1315
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:35,959
But still you believed him.

1316
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:39,027
Because you don't have
the guts to face the truth.

1317
01:12:39,957 --> 01:12:41,300
You thought his lie to be the truth.

1318
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,404
Aunt, why is he
doing all these things?

1319
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,962
What do I lack?

1320
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:48,505
Your brains, dressing sense..

1321
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:51,268
You wear all shabby clothes.

1322
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:54,977
We women before marriage
stand hours together.

1323
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,609
...in front of the mirror.

1324
01:12:57,374 --> 01:13:03,916
As soon as we cross 3O or 35 years,
we start neglecting ourselves.

1325
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:05,392
This is the mistake we do.

1326
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:11,529
Men start their life only after 40.

1327
01:13:11,989 --> 01:13:13,297
Like they say: Naughty at forty.

1328
01:13:13,357 --> 01:13:16,463
Have you seen my husband?
- Yes, uncle.

1329
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:18,234
He is 7O years old now.

1330
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:21,933
Even now if he sees any
college girl who has worn a..

1331
01:13:21,966 --> 01:13:23,138
...tight T-shirt, he
starts staring at her.

1332
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,374
Oh God.
- This is a man's nature.

1333
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,472
We shouldn't sit quietly.

1334
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:31,450
There's gas, oven, and
fridge for the kitchen.

1335
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,954
For bathroom it is
geyser and washing machine.

1336
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:37,021
For hall it is TV and DVD.

1337
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:41,587
In bedroom? There isn't any
sort of machine in bedroom.

1338
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:45,631
We should know our strength.

1339
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:50,970
It is a woman's duty to do
something new and see to..

1340
01:13:51,028 --> 01:13:53,702
...that husband doesn't
go on the wrong path.

1341
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:57,477
You should take more care.

1342
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:21,129
Listen.. look here.

1343
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:23,393
What is it?
- Have change?

1344
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:26,098
I have change of rupees 500.

1345
01:14:26,163 --> 01:14:28,165
Not that. I was
talking about the dress.

1346
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:29,335
Oh, sorry.

1347
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:30,436
You've worn salwar suit today.
(Indian ethnic dress)

1348
01:14:31,168 --> 01:14:32,238
I hope you don't mind.

1349
01:14:32,336 --> 01:14:33,371
Why should I?

1350
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:35,417
I don't mind even if you
wear half pants and roam about.

1351
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:39,948
The people who came to
the beauty parlor asked.

1352
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,250
...whether I was a cinema artist.

1353
01:14:41,345 --> 01:14:42,415
I felt.

1354
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:44,624
Even I feel like
listening to all these things.

1355
01:14:45,015 --> 01:14:47,017
If I tell you something,
you'll misunderstand me..

1356
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:49,256
You'll say: what
wrong have I done to you?

1357
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,560
You'll start fighting with me.

1358
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:55,032
You haven't told
anything about my hairstyle yet.

1359
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:56,262
What do you expect me to say?

1360
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:57,396
Just tell me if it is good or bad?

1361
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:01,600
Look, shall I tell you something?

1362
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:07,906
I haven't changed, so I expect
no one should change for me.

1363
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:10,643
Do you get it?

1364
01:15:31,428 --> 01:15:37,379
Shaman. You are looking
so beautiful.

1365
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:40,675
You don't worry at all.
Everything is going to be fine.

1366
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:44,311
No, father-in-law. I think
he's going on the wrong path.

1367
01:15:46,677 --> 01:15:51,626
Even I feel the same now.
I'll do something now.

1368
01:16:42,466 --> 01:16:45,447
"Charlie Chaplin went to the town."

1369
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:49,008
"To meet the girls
with color, color gown."

1370
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:52,618
"And we all.. around we go."

1371
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:56,319
"Salute to the king
and bow to the queen."

1372
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:59,687
"Kick to the horse and jump to
the sky." - Father, account.

1373
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,428
Father. - "S T O P. comma,
comma, full stop."

1374
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:04,898
"Charlie Chaplin."

1375
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:07,367
Hey, why is father
sitting like this?

1376
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,096
We don't know.

1377
01:17:09,326 --> 01:17:10,396
Where's your mother.

1378
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:15,342
"Charlie Chaplin went to the town."

1379
01:17:15,532 --> 01:17:18,206
"To meet the girls
with color, color gown."

1380
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:21,179
"And we all.. around we go."

1381
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:24,013
"Salute to the king
and bow to the queen."

1382
01:17:24,174 --> 01:17:29,123
Shaman. Shaman.

1383
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:33,986
Why are you sitting here?

1384
01:17:34,585 --> 01:17:36,087
Anyway, I will be on
streets very soon.

1385
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,630
So, I am sitting
here and practicing it.

1386
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:42,028
What's wrong with you? Why
are you acting like this?

1387
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:43,162
What's left to be happened?

1388
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:49,274
Whatever it is, let's go
inside and talk about it.

1389
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:51,435
The people are watching us.

1390
01:17:51,535 --> 01:17:52,946
Let them see. Till now
they've seen Ram's good nature.

1391
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,007
...now let them
witness his bad nature too.

1392
01:17:55,072 --> 01:17:56,551
Hey, don't be stubborn.
Listen to me.

1393
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:00,547
I've always listened to
you from past twelve years.

1394
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:05,088
You lied to me from the very
first day and ruined my life.

1395
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:08,562
Don't act like this.
I'll tell you everything.

1396
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:11,126
This is not the time to hear
anything, but to take decision.

1397
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,496
Enough! Go inside!

1398
01:18:12,556 --> 01:18:13,626
How will you come inside?

1399
01:18:13,891 --> 01:18:15,962
Only my husband is
allowed in this house.

1400
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:18,370
So, am I not your husband?

1401
01:18:18,428 --> 01:18:23,502
You were. One can share their sari,
but not their husband.

1402
01:18:23,534 --> 01:18:25,605
Do you expect me to
watch you roaming with her?

1403
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:28,906
Why do you need wife and children?
- Peddus.

1404
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:30,042
Don't address me by that name.

1405
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:32,913
Whenever you used to
address me as Peddus..

1406
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:35,513
...l thought you were
calling me outwith love.

1407
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,924
But now I realize, you
used to taunt me because.

1408
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,120
...l am a village girl and a fool.

1409
01:18:40,184 --> 01:18:42,562
You used to tell me that I
am not worth to be your wife.

1410
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,059
You always
misunderstood my good qualities.

1411
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,191
Isn't it?

1412
01:18:47,524 --> 01:18:49,026
Bhama, go inside.

1413
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:50,938
If I knew that you
wanted show off and attitude.

1414
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:52,940
...l would've shown it to you.

1415
01:18:53,163 --> 01:18:55,575
When I married you,
I was thin and fair.

1416
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:57,942
Working hard in the house,
taking care of your house..

1417
01:18:57,968 --> 01:19:00,346
...and your children,
I've come to this state.

1418
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,948
If I were to stand in the
front of the mirror for 24 hours..

1419
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:06,613
...l would've showed it to you that
I'm no less than your girlfriend.

1420
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:10,958
Iam asking you.. if I
do the same mistake and..

1421
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:12,960
...roam about with anyone.

1422
01:19:13,016 --> 01:19:14,086
Hey!

1423
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,427
Hit me, why did you stop? You
can't even hear it, isn't it?

1424
01:19:17,955 --> 01:19:20,561
Today, you have to take a
decision whether it is me or her?

1425
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,966
By body, mind, and soul if
you think you are my husband.

1426
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,564
...then come inside.

1427
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,075
If not, you can
leave from here itself.

1428
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:49,054
Hi.

1429
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:55,601
Ram? What happened, Ram?

1430
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:58,631
I had a fight at home.

1431
01:19:59,997 --> 01:20:04,446
Priya, can I stay here, with you?

1432
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,010
I love you.

1433
01:20:18,148 --> 01:20:22,426
Hey.. keep that down.

1434
01:20:22,953 --> 01:20:24,660
Look at her. She's crying so much.

1435
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:29,204
Don't cry. Please, don't cry.

1436
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:30,462
I can't see you in this state.

1437
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,006
He left the house in anger,
lam sure he'll return.

1438
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:34,098
What do you have to say?

1439
01:20:34,965 --> 01:20:39,380
What wrong have I done? Can't
a wife question her husband?

1440
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:42,709
Yes, you can.. but
there is way to do so.

1441
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,413
You made him stand
outside and shoot at sight.

1442
01:20:47,044 --> 01:20:49,149
These women are such.
There's one in my house too.

1443
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:52,193
Forget that. Tell her whether
your friend did right thing or not.

1444
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:57,722
It is a mistake, Shanti. A
man should never fall sick.

1445
01:20:58,088 --> 01:20:59,624
Don't tell this to me, tell her.

1446
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:04,569
Sister Bhama, a man
should never fall sick.

1447
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:06,965
If you have this intention, do
you think you won't fall sick?

1448
01:21:07,064 --> 01:21:09,340
One has to be treated
with the right medicine.

1449
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:11,537
Tell her clearly which
medicine are you talking about.

1450
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:15,947
You should've have planned
everything and would've..

1451
01:21:16,006 --> 01:21:17,679
...vvaited for him to return.

1452
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,121
Instead of that you gave him option,
either this or that.

1453
01:21:21,178 --> 01:21:23,954
You are right. If you
give options to men..

1454
01:21:24,014 --> 01:21:27,086
...they say that they
want that as well as this.

1455
01:21:27,317 --> 01:21:28,387
Betrayers.

1456
01:21:28,452 --> 01:21:33,128
I've visited so many temples and
vowed so that he has a good life.

1457
01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:34,561
He surely has a good life.

1458
01:21:35,192 --> 01:21:36,262
A good pain.

1459
01:21:36,493 --> 01:21:41,101
You.. - You should've been
clear to God about which pair.

1460
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:43,310
Which God do you worship?

1461
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:44,968
ThirupatFs Lord Thimappa.

1462
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,242
Good. He himself has two wives.

1463
01:21:47,304 --> 01:21:48,647
- What? - I am right.

1464
01:21:48,705 --> 01:21:50,981
Lord Thimappa, you
shouldn't have done such thing.

1465
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:52,511
Oh..

1466
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:55,656
Hey, go out and play.

1467
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,589
What do we play?
- What do they play?

1468
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:59,388
Monkey dance. Go and
play something, dear.

1469
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:02,463
Monkey dance. Go..
I was just joking.

1470
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:09,130
Don't worry..
everything will be alright.

1471
01:22:09,526 --> 01:22:14,635
Diwali is nearing. If not you, he'll
surely come here to meet the kids.

1472
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,569
If he doesn't come on Diwali?
- Yes.

1473
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:19,272
He'll surely come in
the ne><t festival.

1474
01:22:19,336 --> 01:22:21,680
Oh God.
- Very well said.

1475
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:23,377
Fine, he'll surely come on Diwali.

1476
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,510
Sister Bhama. Sister Shaman.

1477
01:22:24,574 --> 01:22:25,951
You keep quiet.

1478
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,960
God knows at what time
someone named you as Ram.

1479
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:37,089
...you're acting like Krishna.

1480
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:39,258
And don't know at what time
someone named me as Shyam.

1481
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,664
Be clear what do you want to say.

1482
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,132
You are Ram at heart.
- Talk about me.

1483
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:45,502
You've done a big mistake. Mistake.

1484
01:22:45,562 --> 01:22:47,974
What wrong did I do? She
stood outside and was.

1485
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:49,102
...shouting on the top of her voice.

1486
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,576
You shouldn't be
shouting inside the bar.

1487
01:22:53,203 --> 01:22:54,511
Reduce your volume.

1488
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:56,108
Actually.

1489
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:57,652
Don't reduce so much,
I cant hear you.

1490
01:22:57,707 --> 01:22:58,981
She shouted on me in
front of so many people..

1491
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:01,648
...do you expect me to
still go behind her quietly?

1492
01:23:02,245 --> 01:23:04,919
I've already done wrong.
I don't go to the place.

1493
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:07,222
...where I don't get respect.
I'll not put my head there now.

1494
01:23:07,284 --> 01:23:08,354
Don't put your head,
put your leg there.

1495
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:09,988
Do you expect me to go so low?

1496
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,656
Have you come here for a
serious talk or to talk rubbish?

1497
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:16,134
"Will you keep your voice as low.."

1498
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:18,069
I am talking
seriously and you are joking.

1499
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:23,536
"Thank you." - Let's go home
and peacefully sort this out.

1500
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:27,105
This is like you are
sitting in the lndo-Pak bus..

1501
01:23:27,937 --> 01:23:29,211
Nothing will work out.
- No?

1502
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:30,410
Nothing will work out.

1503
01:23:30,607 --> 01:23:33,213
It would be as if I am
inviting trouble for myself.

1504
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:36,217
Don't address your wife as trouble.

1505
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,553
I am not addressing her, but you.

1506
01:23:37,614 --> 01:23:38,684
Some napkins, please.

1507
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:40,253
Say whatever you want to.

1508
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:45,964
You can call me
anything as you wish.

1509
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:49,703
That reminds me of something.

1510
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:54,099
What did your wife lack?

1511
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:58,010
She lacks nothing, but
she has loads of anger.

1512
01:23:58,068 --> 01:23:59,479
Especially, attitude.

1513
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:01,140
It can be reduced by aerobics.

1514
01:24:02,172 --> 01:24:04,914
Diwali is nearing.
Everyone would feel happy if you..

1515
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:08,320
...go home for five
minutes and talk to the kids.

1516
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:10,648
What say?
- Don't want.

1517
01:24:10,914 --> 01:24:12,188
Don't want? Forget it.

1518
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:16,259
I'll stay away. Let she
know life without husband.

1519
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,227
You'll know life without a wife.

1520
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:20,393
What?
- Nothing.

1521
01:24:20,924 --> 01:24:22,198
I thought you're smart enough..

1522
01:24:22,992 --> 01:24:24,130
What do you have to say, finally?

1523
01:24:24,194 --> 01:24:25,264
Will you listen to what I say?

1524
01:24:25,929 --> 01:24:28,375
You advised me for free,
at least pay for the beer.

1525
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:32,135
I ordered for one more beer..
I don't want that.

1526
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:33,407
Cancel that and give me the bill.

1527
01:24:51,955 --> 01:24:58,270
Hey..
- Listen..

1528
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:06,311
It is since my childhood. All
these crackers are after me.

1529
01:25:06,336 --> 01:25:09,647
Don't stand here come inside.

1530
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:12,077
Hi Ravi. Happy Diwali.

1531
01:25:12,142 --> 01:25:16,591
The house is so dark on Diwali.
Switch on the light.

1532
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:18,523
Remove your goggles.

1533
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:23,393
Gauri.. look what
I've bought for you.

1534
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:25,057
Hey, that's sister Bhama.

1535
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,191
Put on your numbered goggles.

1536
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:30,401
Oh, You were looking slim,
so I mistook you as Gauri.

1537
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,303
Mother and daughter
has the same face cut.

1538
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,134
Sister Bhama, you're sitting
like this on the day of Diwali.

1539
01:25:37,634 --> 01:25:39,170
You have to be well dressed.

1540
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:42,015
Why should I be well dressed?
Have a seat, sister you too.

1541
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:44,349
You said he'll come to
see the kids on Diwali.

1542
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:45,477
He didn't turn up.

1543
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:47,488
Didn't I tell you, he'll come on
the ne><t festival if not this?

1544
01:25:47,544 --> 01:25:50,650
Is he husband or bonus which
comes only on festival time?

1545
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:53,219
Can I say something?

1546
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,960
You threw him out of the house,
if he returns..

1547
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,090
...it is like bonus to you.

1548
01:25:58,154 --> 01:25:59,360
Shut up.
- Shut up.

1549
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:00,423
I am getting angry now.

1550
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,901
Hey, put your glasses properly.

1551
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:03,301
You're telling everything wrong.

1552
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,337
The glasses were upside down,
so I told you everything wrong.

1553
01:26:13,236 --> 01:26:14,340
Front?

1554
01:26:17,307 --> 01:26:19,014
What?
- You said something.

1555
01:26:19,075 --> 01:26:20,213
I didn't say anything. They
are bursting crackers outside.

1556
01:26:21,645 --> 01:26:23,955
Come on, let's burn crackers.
Come on.

1557
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:25,925
I am in such a state and you're
talking about burning crackers.

1558
01:26:25,982 --> 01:26:27,655
Sister, what's he doing?
- You shut up.

1559
01:26:28,451 --> 01:26:31,591
In this situation you have to
let loose the string and then pull.

1560
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,329
If you pull it, it can't fly high.

1561
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,460
Who said so?

1562
01:26:35,925 --> 01:26:36,995
The experienced people said so.

1563
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,539
You're not experienced
in this matter, but I am.

1564
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,930
I've been letting loose
the string and my husband.

1565
01:26:40,964 --> 01:26:42,671
...is going far and
far away from me.

1566
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:44,274
Sister Bhama,
I'll tell you something.

1567
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:46,940
Please, don't. I had faith in
you and I am waiting for my..

1568
01:26:47,003 --> 01:26:48,482
...husband to return.

1569
01:26:48,538 --> 01:26:50,074
Did I get anything in return?

1570
01:26:51,274 --> 01:26:55,552
Sister Shaman. you crossed
your limits and fought with him.

1571
01:26:55,612 --> 01:26:58,684
Now, do you expect him to
forget everything and return'?

1572
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:00,919
Men has ego.

1573
01:27:01,351 --> 01:27:04,628
What? - I was talking
about him.. ShantL. ShantL.

1574
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:09,297
What do I do? I am
like a frog in the well.

1575
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:10,630
She is a beauty queen.

1576
01:27:11,094 --> 01:27:14,234
She wears colorful
clothes and talks nice English.

1577
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:15,899
She has bath in the
middle of the road.

1578
01:27:16,032 --> 01:27:18,103
Men like you desire to
see the same, don't you?

1579
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:22,508
He didn't like me. Forget it.

1580
01:27:22,972 --> 01:27:26,920
Wherever my husband is
let him stay happily.

1581
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,580
...don't think that I would say this.

1582
01:27:28,645 --> 01:27:33,594
I khow.. I Know how to pull my
husband from wherever he is.

1583
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:38,923
Sister Bhama, what are you up to?

1584
01:27:38,988 --> 01:27:40,661
Wait and watch. What I do.

1585
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:43,264
Wherever he is, he
should come running to me.

1586
01:27:43,326 --> 01:27:46,205
Sister Bhama, you
might mess up things.

1587
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:51,041
No matter what, sister Bhama
do whatever you feel like.

1588
01:27:51,067 --> 01:27:52,137
Is it so?
- Yes.

1589
01:27:52,235 --> 01:27:53,305
Go ahead.

1590
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,950
Enough of my good behavior with him.

1591
01:27:57,006 --> 01:28:01,011
Now I am going to revolt. See
what the sweet wife does to him.

1592
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:12,624
Who is it?

1593
01:28:16,126 --> 01:28:17,196
Who is it!

1594
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:21,600
Who are you?

1595
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:23,234
Spiderman.
- Power puff girl.

1596
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:24,369
Why did you ring the bell?

1597
01:28:24,434 --> 01:28:25,606
The bell is to ring, isn't it?

1598
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:33,218
Hey, stop there. Stop there.
I'll tell you.

1599
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,747
Who are you both?

1600
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:37,182
We are ourselves.

1601
01:28:37,247 --> 01:28:38,692
What are you doing in my house?

1602
01:28:39,082 --> 01:28:40,459
Somebody is at the door. No.
The phone is ringing.

1603
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:46,225
Hello.

1604
01:28:48,358 --> 01:28:51,134
Hey beautiful girl, where
is your prince charming?

1605
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:54,368
Who is it? - The one
you've kept it in your house.

1606
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,171
Hello, wrong number.

1607
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:58,607
I am not the wrong number, but you.

1608
01:28:59,135 --> 01:29:00,205
Call him.

1609
01:29:01,805 --> 01:29:03,113
Ram!

1610
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:07,181
What is it!
- Daddy!

1611
01:29:07,243 --> 01:29:09,018
Hey, Ravi, Gauri.
When did you both come?

1612
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,148
Just now.

1613
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:13,422
Mummy has called up.

1614
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,621
Is it? What is she telling?

1615
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:16,722
Talk to her yourself.

1616
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:23,261
Hello.

1617
01:29:23,326 --> 01:29:25,772
Hello, Mr. Ram. Mrs. Ram speaking.

1618
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:27,165
Peddus. Peddus.

1619
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:31,542
Hello, Peddus.. Bhama, why
did you send the kids here?

1620
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:33,581
Where else do I send them?
You're their father.

1621
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:34,706
So, take care of them from now on.

1622
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:36,182
Look.. you can't do this.

1623
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:39,316
I've seen everything,
dear. I am tired.

1624
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:40,547
You take care of them from now on.

1625
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:47,252
Daddy.
- Daddy.

1626
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,385
What did she say?

1627
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:54,466
The children will
stay here from now on.

1628
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:58,237
Very sweet kids. He is a gem.

1629
01:30:02,799 --> 01:30:05,336
Daddy.. daddy.

1630
01:30:05,468 --> 01:30:07,106
Nice to see you man.

1631
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,640
You have to light the gas like this.

1632
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,610
Next?

1633
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:13,449
Where is the puffed rice?

1634
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:15,216
Yes, it is there. Climb on me.

1635
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,190
Yes, the same.

1636
01:30:37,133 --> 01:30:39,170
Oh, what are you both doing?

1637
01:30:39,502 --> 01:30:41,106
You can't keep quiet
even for a minute.

1638
01:30:41,404 --> 01:30:43,247
You keep doing some
or other mischief.

1639
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,310
You've even turned on the gas stove.

1640
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:47,514
Where's your father. - He's gone
to the hotel to get lunch.

1641
01:30:47,577 --> 01:30:48,715
Couldn't you wait till he returns?

1642
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:50,155
I am famished.

1643
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:51,385
So, do you have to
do all these things?

1644
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:52,585
Don't know what your
mother taught you.

1645
01:30:52,682 --> 01:30:55,060
Don't talk about my mother.
- What will you do?

1646
01:30:55,084 --> 01:30:56,256
I told you not to talk about her.

1647
01:30:56,419 --> 01:30:57,727
What will you do?

1648
01:30:57,787 --> 01:30:59,232
What I Will do'?

1649
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,663
How dare you break the plate?
- Mother!

1650
01:31:07,063 --> 01:31:08,337
Is this your mother taught you?

1651
01:31:08,398 --> 01:31:09,502
Mother!
- You naughty girl..

1652
01:31:09,565 --> 01:31:11,101
Daddy!
- Don't you have brains?

1653
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:12,373
Hey..
- Daddy!

1654
01:31:13,002 --> 01:31:14,140
Why are you hitting the kids?

1655
01:31:14,203 --> 01:31:16,080
Look, what they've
done in the kitchen.

1656
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:19,552
Children are a bit naughty. So,
do you have to hit them?

1657
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:21,589
Not only hitting them, I feel
like trashing them properly.

1658
01:31:21,678 --> 01:31:22,748
Hey!

1659
01:31:25,048 --> 01:31:27,028
If you weren't an
orphan you would've knovvn..

1660
01:31:27,049 --> 01:31:29,051
...the value of family and children.

1661
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:30,290
What are you watching?
Get lost from here!

1662
01:31:34,257 --> 01:31:35,327
I am sorry.

1663
01:31:40,596 --> 01:31:42,200
Oh, Lord Thimappa.

1664
01:31:42,265 --> 01:31:43,335
What did father say?

1665
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:46,107
He said: Shut up! Are
you out of your mind!

1666
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:47,671
He scolded her nicely.

1667
01:31:48,638 --> 01:31:49,708
What else did he say?

1668
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:52,048
He said: You don't know the
value of family and children.

1669
01:31:52,108 --> 01:31:53,610
...as you're an orphan.

1670
01:31:55,778 --> 01:31:57,451
I am feeling so happy.

1671
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:01,286
Why did she hit you?

1672
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:03,657
You told us to do mischief,
so we did.

1673
01:32:03,987 --> 01:32:05,091
So, she hit us.

1674
01:32:05,254 --> 01:32:08,724
Mother, what do we do when she
hits us when father isn't around?

1675
01:32:11,494 --> 01:32:13,565
I'll surely do something.

1676
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:21,441
You brat.

1677
01:32:22,505 --> 01:32:24,178
You and your father are brats.

1678
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:25,677
Excuse me.

1679
01:32:26,075 --> 01:32:28,077
What is it?
- Somebody is here to see you.

1680
01:32:28,144 --> 01:32:30,624
Who is it? - He says that he
knows father from childhood.

1681
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:32,117
Who is it?

1682
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,693
What kind of commode is this?
It is such wide and lengthy.

1683
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:39,562
I am unable to sit in it.

1684
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:41,598
Even my stomach is
aching since morning.

1685
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:46,495
Grandpa, that's a bathtub.
Did you dirty that?

1686
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:48,633
Ram!

1687
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:51,107
"Rama Rama."
- What's the problem?

1688
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:52,237
Look there.

1689
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:54,577
Father. when did he come?
- "Rama Rama."

1690
01:32:55,104 --> 01:32:56,276
Father, what are you doing here?

1691
01:32:57,206 --> 01:32:59,243
Is this the girl you're living with?

1692
01:33:00,443 --> 01:33:03,049
She is so slim like a stick.

1693
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:05,592
You left Bhama for her sake?

1694
01:33:05,615 --> 01:33:07,492
Wear your clothes.
I'll drop you home.

1695
01:33:08,184 --> 01:33:11,131
Home? This is my house..
- Father, what are you saying?

1696
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:13,990
If you're living with your children,
why shouldn't l..

1697
01:33:14,056 --> 01:33:15,126
...live with my son, tell me?

1698
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:16,670
Father, you'll have
problem with food.

1699
01:33:16,726 --> 01:33:19,605
You'll get only hotel food here.
- Will she die if she cooks?

1700
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:21,141
Don't say that.
- Ram!

1701
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,571
"Rama Rama."
- Yes.

1702
01:33:23,733 --> 01:33:25,337
This is too much. I can't bear it.
- I know. I know.

1703
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:27,438
Send him out first.
- Just give me two minutes.

1704
01:33:28,004 --> 01:33:30,211
Father, why did you come here.

1705
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,151
"Who let the dogs out!"

1706
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,521
"Who let the dogs out!"

1707
01:33:36,545 --> 01:33:38,547
Why did this come here?

1708
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:40,423
To accompany grandpa.

1709
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:44,629
"Who let the dogs out!"
- Ram, this is really too much.

1710
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:46,530
No, this is four much.

1711
01:33:46,589 --> 01:33:49,502
L.. sister. grandpa. and darling.

1712
01:33:50,226 --> 01:33:53,400
Hell.. my life has
become hell. Bloody hell.

1713
01:33:53,462 --> 01:33:54,532
Priya.

1714
01:34:07,143 --> 01:34:10,317
Does anyone put their
clothes to dry in the hall?

1715
01:34:10,379 --> 01:34:11,414
What is all this?

1716
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:14,391
These are kids' underwear,
this is mine.

1717
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:16,520
This is wear and tear
and this is tear and wear.

1718
01:34:16,686 --> 01:34:19,599
This you wear till it tears and
this you have to tear and wear it.

1719
01:34:20,189 --> 01:34:23,466
Ram! Ram!

1720
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,334
"Rama, Rama."

1721
01:34:25,394 --> 01:34:27,067
What?
- What, what?

1722
01:34:27,163 --> 01:34:28,233
What scene this is?

1723
01:34:28,564 --> 01:34:30,237
Father.
- What?

1724
01:34:30,299 --> 01:34:32,404
What, what? You're
standing without clothes.

1725
01:34:32,602 --> 01:34:35,344
Where? I've wrapped a towel around.

1726
01:34:35,738 --> 01:34:37,217
Couldn't you wear the
loin cloth at least?

1727
01:34:37,273 --> 01:34:39,753
Is it possible to have bath
in a loin cloth? You tell me.

1728
01:34:40,142 --> 01:34:41,678
Oh God..
- Just a second.

1729
01:34:42,011 --> 01:34:43,149
Hey, my undergarment.

1730
01:34:43,246 --> 01:34:45,248
Is this is a BDA plot?
I'll put it outside to dry.

1731
01:34:47,116 --> 01:34:48,459
My life has become hell.

1732
01:34:53,456 --> 01:34:55,026
There's no
independence in this house.

1733
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:56,331
...even to put my
undergarment for dry.

1734
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:12,243
"Who let the dogs out!"

1735
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:15,655
"Who let the dogs out!"

1736
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,517
"Who let the dogs out!"

1737
01:35:19,682 --> 01:35:21,093
Ram!

1738
01:35:21,384 --> 01:35:22,590
"Rama, Rama."
- Ram.

1739
01:35:22,685 --> 01:35:26,326
What is it? What is it? What is it?

1740
01:35:29,358 --> 01:35:30,428
What's your problem?

1741
01:35:30,493 --> 01:35:31,563
Can't you see the problem?

1742
01:35:31,627 --> 01:35:33,664
Your darling is
having bath in my bathtub.

1743
01:35:35,064 --> 01:35:41,743
There's no one here.
Look.. there's nothing here.

1744
01:35:43,472 --> 01:35:44,610
Darling was here.

1745
01:35:45,107 --> 01:35:46,677
Oh..
- I saw it with my own eyes.

1746
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:48,653
No darling, it must be your illusion.

1747
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:51,418
Okay, have bath.
- I'll not have bath here.

1748
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:53,059
Okay, go and have bath in
the bathroom downstairs.

1749
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:02,763
Hey, what are you doing?

1750
01:36:03,492 --> 01:36:05,972
I told him thousand times
not to put my undergarments.

1751
01:36:06,028 --> 01:36:07,302
...on the terrace. It fell down.

1752
01:36:07,597 --> 01:36:09,406
For God sake, don't put it here.

1753
01:36:09,665 --> 01:36:11,508
Okay, fine. I'll put it on the TV.

1754
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:12,705
On the TV'?
- Ram.

1755
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:15,649
Somebody is calling out for Ram.
- Mr. Ram!

1756
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,314
Mr.
Ram!

1757
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:20,445
Mr.
Ram!

1758
01:36:20,543 --> 01:36:21,613
Mr.
Ram!

1759
01:36:21,677 --> 01:36:23,486
"Rama, Rama."

1760
01:36:23,613 --> 01:36:25,388
Come here. Come here.

1761
01:36:25,414 --> 01:36:27,621
What is it? - Why have you
tied the covv to the gate?

1762
01:36:27,683 --> 01:36:30,220
Look at the traffic jam.
- It isn't our cow.

1763
01:36:30,352 --> 01:36:33,697
Then whose? It has come with a
visiting card around its neck.

1764
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:42,066
I am Ram's cow. Oh darn.

1765
01:36:43,599 --> 01:36:44,669
Excuse me, one minute.

1766
01:36:47,203 --> 01:36:51,549
Oh God.. Ram!

1767
01:36:51,607 --> 01:36:53,177
"Rama, Rama."

1768
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,615
What? What happened?

1769
01:36:55,077 --> 01:36:57,250
Father, you and your undergarment.

1770
01:36:57,346 --> 01:36:58,416
That's not the problem.
- Give that to me.

1771
01:36:58,447 --> 01:37:01,621
Ram, let go off it! Your cow has
created a chaos near the gate.

1772
01:37:02,051 --> 01:37:03,155
Laxmi?

1773
01:37:03,586 --> 01:37:05,031
Why did La><mi come here?

1774
01:37:05,087 --> 01:37:07,089
La><mi and darling can't
stay without each other..

1775
01:37:07,156 --> 01:37:09,363
So, I think it has
come in search of darling.

1776
01:37:09,425 --> 01:37:10,665
"Who let the dogs out!"

1777
01:37:12,128 --> 01:37:13,198
"Who let the dogs out!"
- See there..

1778
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:14,332
Didn't I tell you?

1779
01:37:14,463 --> 01:37:17,137
I am so sorry. I am really sorry.
I'll go and have a look there.

1780
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,110
Please, go and solve the problem.
- Daddy! - What is it?

1781
01:37:19,168 --> 01:37:21,444
I finished brushing. Make me
wear my uniform. - I am coming.

1782
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:23,647
Ram, first go and solve this problem.

1783
01:37:23,706 --> 01:37:25,447
Hey, go there, he is waiting for you.

1784
01:37:25,508 --> 01:37:27,510
Ram, wont you listen
to me? Go there first.

1785
01:37:27,677 --> 01:37:30,783
Hey, go there first. Go!

1786
01:37:31,447 --> 01:37:32,482
Hey, come with me.

1787
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:35,253
I have to help you in
doing homework, make you wean.

1788
01:37:35,284 --> 01:37:36,354
...the uniforms. I
have to do everything.

1789
01:37:36,419 --> 01:37:37,523
Can't you do it yourself?

1790
01:37:37,786 --> 01:37:40,630
Daddy, this is not my uniform.
This is sister's.

1791
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:42,566
Oh God. Where is his uniform?

1792
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:47,235
Daddy, today is Monday. It is
not white uniform, but brown.

1793
01:37:47,296 --> 01:37:48,775
The white uniform is here.

1794
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:50,401
Brown?

1795
01:37:51,233 --> 01:37:53,440
Daddy, you haven't
made me wear my underwear.

1796
01:37:55,304 --> 01:37:56,374
Where is his underwear!

1797
01:37:56,438 --> 01:37:58,418
Ram! Mr. Ram!

1798
01:37:58,474 --> 01:38:03,082
La><mi.. La><mi.. - Please,
move aside, sir.

1799
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:06,217
I didn't build the apartment so
that you can tie your cow here.

1800
01:38:06,549 --> 01:38:08,028
According to the rules of
the apartment you can't keep..

1801
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,553
...any other animal
other than the dog.

1802
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:11,757
Sir, this is a cow.

1803
01:38:12,021 --> 01:38:13,227
Did I tell it is a lion'?

1804
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:15,735
You'll keep the cow, they'll keep
gorilla, and they'll keep elephant.

1805
01:38:16,025 --> 01:38:17,629
Is it an apartment or Gemini circus?

1806
01:38:17,693 --> 01:38:19,570
Sir.. - See there. There
is a traffic jam here.

1807
01:38:19,628 --> 01:38:20,766
Come on, move it aside.

1808
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,438
Sir, I'll keep it in our garage.

1809
01:38:22,498 --> 01:38:24,705
Don't you dare do that. Come on,
take it out from here.

1810
01:38:24,767 --> 01:38:26,041
Sir, where do I take this now?
- Tie it behind your car..

1811
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:28,707
...and roam about the whole city.
It shouldn't be here. That's it!

1812
01:38:29,305 --> 01:38:31,683
Take it out from here.
- Okay. Okay!

1813
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:36,646
There was a happy family.

1814
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:40,591
<i>Daddy, mummy, Gaufl, and Raw.</i>

1815
01:38:45,654 --> 01:38:48,134
Then came an airhostess.

1816
01:38:49,058 --> 01:38:50,298
What did she do?

1817
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,696
She ruined our house.

1818
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:57,334
What do we do to the airhostess?

1819
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,144
You have to throw a bomb on her head.

1820
01:39:00,202 --> 01:39:02,739
What do we do?
- Throw a bomb on her head.

1821
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:05,174
You've kept my snuff box here.

1822
01:39:05,241 --> 01:39:07,619
Come on, give it to me. - No,
I won't. - Please, give it, dear.

1823
01:39:07,676 --> 01:39:09,087
I'll give you only when
you give us ice-cream.

1824
01:39:09,145 --> 01:39:10,215
Okay, <i>l'll.</i>

1825
01:39:10,245 --> 01:39:11,622
You have to give it now.
- Okay, fine.

1826
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:14,527
Yeah! - Where is it?

1827
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:19,691
Come.

1828
01:39:34,403 --> 01:39:35,473
Oh no!

1829
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:06,741
You torched my house
and are having ice-cream.

1830
01:40:07,002 --> 01:40:08,072
Don't you feel ashamed?

1831
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:13,579
Sorry, dear. Children were
playing with the candle.

1832
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,351
I think the curtain fell on it.

1833
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:20,016
They are children. But
you're old enough to know..

1834
01:40:20,048 --> 01:40:21,220
...what were you doing'?

1835
01:40:22,718 --> 01:40:25,255
Were you guiding them
hovv to torch the house?

1836
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:28,097
That is a candle and
not an incense stick.

1837
01:40:28,157 --> 01:40:29,397
Shut up, you naughty.

1838
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:32,629
I was quiet till now thinking
you're small kids. - Grandpa!

1839
01:40:33,095 --> 01:40:34,369
Leave them, dear.
Children did that unknowingly.

1840
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:37,104
Even I thought the same that
children are doing it unknowingly.

1841
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:39,203
But these brats are
doing it intentionally.

1842
01:40:39,468 --> 01:40:41,141
Get out of this house! Out!

1843
01:40:41,303 --> 01:40:42,373
Let Ram return.

1844
01:40:42,438 --> 01:40:44,543
Why? Did you come with
Ram's permission here?

1845
01:40:44,607 --> 01:40:47,645
Actually.
- Out! Shut up! Get out! Out!

1846
01:40:50,546 --> 01:40:56,758
Get out! Out! Get out!

1847
01:41:10,165 --> 01:41:14,739
Father. father. what
are you doing on the road?

1848
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:17,016
Where do we go if she
throws us out of the house?

1849
01:41:17,072 --> 01:41:19,382
Whatever it is, let's go
home and talk about it.

1850
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:21,478
That house? Get lost, you idiot.

1851
01:41:22,244 --> 01:41:24,019
Your girlfriend has warned
that if I step in that house..

1852
01:41:24,046 --> 01:41:25,252
...she'll break my legs.

1853
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:29,022
I thought I would make
you see some sense..

1854
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:31,531
...but you've crossed all the limits.

1855
01:41:31,587 --> 01:41:34,693
Father.. - I feel ashamed
to address you as my son.

1856
01:41:35,657 --> 01:41:38,035
What are you gaping at? If
you really are a human being..

1857
01:41:38,094 --> 01:41:40,096
...return to that house respectfully.

1858
01:41:40,329 --> 01:41:41,433
We all will be waiting for you.

1859
01:41:41,663 --> 01:41:43,370
Sit inside the car,
I'll drop you home.

1860
01:41:43,432 --> 01:41:46,709
If you just want to drop us and
return, I'll not come with you.

1861
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:50,342
If you tell me that you'll
return home, I'll sit inside the car.

1862
01:42:06,155 --> 01:42:08,465
Priya, why did you throw father
and children out of the house?

1863
01:42:08,523 --> 01:42:10,002
Yes, I did. They had
already torched our lives..

1864
01:42:10,059 --> 01:42:12,335
...now they tried
torching our house too.

1865
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,407
Do you Know how much he has
sacrificed in life for me'?

1866
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:17,069
Does he know I've
sacrificed so much in life for you?

1867
01:42:17,232 --> 01:42:19,075
You should've at least
respected him for his age.

1868
01:42:19,134 --> 01:42:21,011
If he had respected
our relationship.

1869
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,140
...even I would've respected him.

1870
01:42:22,204 --> 01:42:23,444
Look, don't argue with me.

1871
01:42:23,505 --> 01:42:28,011
I don't want to argue. but that
witch is playing with my life..

1872
01:42:28,076 --> 01:42:29,350
...your wife..
- Hey!

1873
01:42:30,212 --> 01:42:31,555
Dare you talk anything about Bhama.

1874
01:42:31,647 --> 01:42:33,217
You're not worth of her.

1875
01:42:38,086 --> 01:42:39,463
Priya, look..
- Don't touch me.

1876
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:43,228
Don't touch me!

1877
01:42:47,529 --> 01:42:48,667
Oh no..

1878
01:43:00,776 --> 01:43:03,120
What are you doing here?
What happened?

1879
01:43:04,313 --> 01:43:09,092
We did a mistake, dear.
That girl chased us out.

1880
01:43:09,117 --> 01:43:10,721
He is dancing on her tunes.

1881
01:43:11,153 --> 01:43:16,501
Is it? Enough of melodrama now.
We have to be real now.

1882
01:43:18,126 --> 01:43:19,196
I will be.

1883
01:43:45,688 --> 01:43:46,758
Get up.

1884
01:43:49,158 --> 01:43:51,468
Come on, let's go upstairs and play.
- Come on, let's go.

1885
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:53,597
Who are you?
- Hello, lam Bhanu..

1886
01:43:54,129 --> 01:43:56,370
I and Ram.
- You're having an affair?

1887
01:43:56,498 --> 01:43:57,568
I thought she was the only one.

1888
01:43:57,633 --> 01:44:00,239
I don't Know how many
more girlfriends he has.

1889
01:44:00,302 --> 01:44:03,044
No, madam. I just came here
to tell that Ram is common..

1890
01:44:05,207 --> 01:44:06,277
So what?

1891
01:44:07,076 --> 01:44:08,521
Can I talk to you for two minutes?

1892
01:44:09,044 --> 01:44:10,216
I came here looking at the ad
in the paper that you had given.

1893
01:44:10,312 --> 01:44:11,382
Come in.

1894
01:44:13,582 --> 01:44:17,086
This is Raja. He
loves Priya very much.

1895
01:44:18,053 --> 01:44:19,999
Just because he isn't rich,
she left him..

1896
01:44:20,055 --> 01:44:22,365
...and is behind your husband now..

1897
01:44:22,657 --> 01:44:23,727
But.

1898
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:27,164
Where's he now?

1899
01:44:28,597 --> 01:44:30,634
Doctor, where are you?

1900
01:44:31,733 --> 01:44:34,111
Come, sister Bhama.

1901
01:44:34,436 --> 01:44:37,474
Hey, sit straight. Go.

1902
01:44:38,406 --> 01:44:39,510
Hey!

1903
01:44:39,575 --> 01:44:41,111
They don't allow me to
shoot anything independently.

1904
01:44:41,176 --> 01:44:42,246
What happened?

1905
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:44,052
The curry fell in my eyes.

1906
01:44:44,146 --> 01:44:45,557
Why are you holding this?
Throw that.

1907
01:44:46,248 --> 01:44:47,318
Why didn't you go
to the clinic today?

1908
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:51,031
I didn't go to the clinic, lam
not tensed about it, why are you?

1909
01:44:51,086 --> 01:44:52,156
There's a strike.

1910
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:54,394
Nurse strike?
- Shanti strike.

1911
01:44:55,023 --> 01:44:58,368
Morning Shanti puked and told
me that she's not feeling well.

1912
01:44:58,593 --> 01:45:01,199
She put the responsibility
of cooking on me and went out.

1913
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,741
Very good. Come with me.

1914
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:05,372
Why are you going there?
- To take the spoon.

1915
01:45:05,434 --> 01:45:07,141
To hell with the spoon!
Come here. Sit here.

1916
01:45:08,203 --> 01:45:09,546
Somebody loves Priya very much.

1917
01:45:09,604 --> 01:45:11,140
I know.. your husband.

1918
01:45:11,273 --> 01:45:12,581
No, someone else.

1919
01:45:13,408 --> 01:45:16,617
Someone else? She might
be cheating Ram as well.

1920
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:19,289
No, he is an old boyfriend of hers.

1921
01:45:19,414 --> 01:45:22,020
Oh, flashback hero?

1922
01:45:22,084 --> 01:45:23,495
Yes, Raja.

1923
01:45:23,552 --> 01:45:25,463
Okay, fine.
- No, it isn't.

1924
01:45:25,988 --> 01:45:29,492
This is Priya. This is Raja.
And this is my husband.

1925
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:32,329
Raja and Priya don't see each other.

1926
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:35,471
My husband and Priya are
fighting with each other.

1927
01:45:36,632 --> 01:45:38,202
Raja and Priya should come closer.

1928
01:45:38,266 --> 01:45:40,007
Now, we have to do an act
and do something by which.

1929
01:45:40,068 --> 01:45:41,638
...my husband leaves Priya.

1930
01:45:42,337 --> 01:45:43,577
An act. do you get it?

1931
01:45:44,406 --> 01:45:47,546
Where do I stand in this?

1932
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:49,520
What is this?
- Salt.

1933
01:45:49,744 --> 01:45:51,314
Wrong. This is you.

1934
01:45:53,015 --> 01:45:54,358
You've put me in the center, why?

1935
01:45:56,251 --> 01:45:57,559
How do you know all this?

1936
01:45:57,619 --> 01:46:02,159
Bhanu told me.
- Okay. I see. Who is Bhanu?

1937
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:04,134
She is Priya's roommate.
All live together.

1938
01:46:04,292 --> 01:46:05,464
Everyone lives together.
- Yes.

1939
01:46:06,228 --> 01:46:09,437
First you, then Priya,
and now Bhanu..

1940
01:46:09,498 --> 01:46:11,102
What about Ram's health?

1941
01:46:11,233 --> 01:46:12,974
You heard the whole story
till now and now you're asking.

1942
01:46:13,035 --> 01:46:15,208
...how is Bhama related to Ram.

1943
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:17,045
This is different. This is different.

1944
01:46:17,105 --> 01:46:19,608
Everyone is separated.
All this is a drama. That's it.

1945
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:22,647
Calm down.

1946
01:46:22,977 --> 01:46:26,015
Where will this drama take place?

1947
01:46:26,114 --> 01:46:28,594
Ravindra Kalakshetra. where else,
it will be done here..

1948
01:46:29,084 --> 01:46:30,324
Here? In my house?
- Yes.

1949
01:46:31,152 --> 01:46:33,132
Where is your house?
- It is in the same place.

1950
01:46:33,188 --> 01:46:34,394
But my husband will not come there.

1951
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:36,594
Yes, you're right.
- What right.

1952
01:46:37,259 --> 01:46:39,170
I take the
responsibility of getting Raja here.

1953
01:46:39,461 --> 01:46:41,338
Your responsibility is to
get my husband and Priya here.

1954
01:46:42,197 --> 01:46:43,608
Husband means. Ram, isn't it?

1955
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:45,235
How many husbands do I have?

1956
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,606
Only one.

1957
01:46:47,302 --> 01:46:53,378
I'll get Ram here. But getting
Priya here in Shanti's absence.

1958
01:46:54,076 --> 01:46:55,419
Getting her here..
- What?

1959
01:46:57,112 --> 01:46:59,251
Listen to me carefully.
Priya is heartbroken now.

1960
01:46:59,448 --> 01:47:01,155
She wants someone to console her.

1961
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:03,092
She wants somebody
to share her sorrows.

1962
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:04,562
She needs a shoulder to cry on.

1963
01:47:04,686 --> 01:47:08,259
I am ready to give all that,
but Shanti will kill me.

1964
01:47:08,323 --> 01:47:10,564
You want to support her? Raja
will support her. - Okay, fine.

1965
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:13,162
We have to keep Raja in
between and get my husband back.

1966
01:47:13,461 --> 01:47:16,032
If my husband sees
her and Raja together.

1967
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,338
...he won't see her again in his life.

1968
01:47:18,633 --> 01:47:19,703
How do you know that?

1969
01:47:19,768 --> 01:47:22,044
Husbands are betrayers.
They can see anywhere.

1970
01:47:22,104 --> 01:47:25,449
...but they can't see their
woman with someone else.

1971
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:27,645
No matter if it is
his wife or girlfriend.

1972
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:29,780
Am I right or wrong?
- I don't understand anything.

1973
01:47:30,145 --> 01:47:32,056
That's not a problem. Just
recite the dialogues that l..

1974
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,582
...give you and enact it.
That would be enough.

1975
01:47:34,283 --> 01:47:39,062
Yes, I can.. but I am a
professional doctor and..

1976
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,190
...a very poor actor.

1977
01:47:40,355 --> 01:47:43,063
I can deliver babies perfectly..
but dialogue clelivery..

1978
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:45,435
...there are chances of abortion.

1979
01:47:45,527 --> 01:47:48,064
You don't get tensed at all.
I've written everything that.

1980
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,507
...you have to say.

1981
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:56,749
Then easy.. IVIBBS. it would be
difficult if my son hears this.

1982
01:47:57,139 --> 01:47:59,380
I passed my IVIBBS the same way.

1983
01:48:10,085 --> 01:48:11,393
You said you want to say something?

1984
01:48:15,757 --> 01:48:20,263
I'll tell you everything,
but you have to decide.

1985
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:21,399
Tell me.

1986
01:48:24,633 --> 01:48:29,207
Have you thought
anything about your future?

1987
01:48:30,572 --> 01:48:34,418
Without thinking about the
future does a woman live with a man?

1988
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:36,248
You said the same answer.

1989
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:41,755
Fine.. what is that?

1990
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:45,222
This? Ram presented this to me.

1991
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:47,322
What did he give you?
- A chain.

1992
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:52,399
Oh, only chain.. I
thought it was a nuptial chain.

1993
01:49:02,737 --> 01:49:05,013
As you're a woman, lam asking you..

1994
01:49:05,073 --> 01:49:07,280
...don't you feel like having kids?

1995
01:49:09,478 --> 01:49:10,548
Yes.

1996
01:49:10,612 --> 01:49:11,647
How many children do you want?
- What?

1997
01:49:11,746 --> 01:49:13,350
Oh, forget it. That's your wish.

1998
01:49:14,015 --> 01:49:17,485
You would've surely spoken
about this with ram, isn't it?

1999
01:49:18,153 --> 01:49:24,536
Yes.. he said, there's no hurry.
We'll have it later.

2000
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,433
Does he take you out for a movie?

2001
01:49:27,095 --> 01:49:28,540
Yes. PVR.

2002
01:49:28,597 --> 01:49:30,668
Night show, isn't it?
- How do you know?

2003
01:49:30,732 --> 01:49:33,770
I know. Morning walk?
- Everyday.

2004
01:49:34,102 --> 01:49:35,308
Very early morning, right?

2005
01:49:37,606 --> 01:49:40,052
So, it means that you both
roam about before sunrise.

2006
01:49:40,108 --> 01:49:42,782
...and after sunset.

2007
01:49:44,779 --> 01:49:48,750
So, don't you think you're
living your life in dark?

2008
01:49:50,218 --> 01:49:53,461
Don't you feel your life is
constricted till the bedroom?

2009
01:49:54,756 --> 01:50:00,798
Forget it? Does he take
you to someone's wedding?

2010
01:50:06,168 --> 01:50:07,374
It hit in the center, isn't it?

2011
01:50:13,742 --> 01:50:17,019
Look here.. after some
days if he returns home..

2012
01:50:17,045 --> 01:50:20,618
...and he falls sick,
hovv will you meet him?

2013
01:50:21,016 --> 01:50:22,552
I'll go and meet him wherever he is.

2014
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:27,029
That house? Very good. Will
sister Bhama greet you and..

2015
01:50:27,088 --> 01:50:31,468
...make you meet her
husband as he is not well?

2016
01:50:33,528 --> 01:50:36,668
If he is not well,
they'll call a doctor like me.

2017
01:50:37,099 --> 01:50:38,578
Not a woman like you.

2018
01:50:39,167 --> 01:50:41,773
Sorry. Rights of admission reserved.

2019
01:50:49,778 --> 01:50:52,554
I'll tell you something,
don't feel bad.

2020
01:50:52,681 --> 01:50:53,751
Please, go ahead.

2021
01:50:54,349 --> 01:50:56,056
This society will
address you as something else..

2022
01:50:56,084 --> 01:50:59,725
...if they know that
you're with him for money.

2023
01:50:59,787 --> 01:51:01,164
This dirty society.

2024
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:05,327
Even a woman can earn lot of money.

2025
01:51:06,094 --> 01:51:10,270
But earning dignity in the
society is a difficult thing.

2026
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,739
You're very beautiful,
educated as well.

2027
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:19,746
Please, think it over again.
He is a man. He can do anything.

2028
01:51:20,609 --> 01:51:21,679
But you..

2029
01:51:29,518 --> 01:51:31,657
All fell.. all out.

2030
01:51:33,154 --> 01:51:34,224
What next?

2031
01:51:34,556 --> 01:51:36,229
Anyways, an important thing.

2032
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:38,498
There's a function in my house.
You have to come.

2033
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,640
Shanti told me to tell you.
Wednesday at 4.

2034
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:48,409
You have to come. This
is my card. My name.

2035
01:51:48,469 --> 01:51:51,109
No. 66, there's a swimming
pool in front of my house.

2036
01:51:51,172 --> 01:51:52,549
You have to come at 4.

2037
01:51:52,607 --> 01:51:54,780
Actually..
- Don't tell me that you can't come.

2038
01:51:55,777 --> 01:52:00,192
You'll get a good news there.
- Okay.

2039
01:52:00,248 --> 01:52:01,659
Thank you. Thank you.

2040
01:52:02,084 --> 01:52:04,587
Your glasses.
- Thank you. Thank you again.

2041
01:52:04,652 --> 01:52:05,722
I shall leave now.

2042
01:52:28,576 --> 01:52:31,022
I am ready to accept her, but
will she leave your husband.

2043
01:52:31,046 --> 01:52:33,322
...and come to me?

2044
01:52:33,414 --> 01:52:37,089
If suppose she comes to you by
herself, will you accept her?

2045
01:52:40,154 --> 01:52:43,624
I know it will be very difficult
for you to decide as you're a man.

2046
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:48,541
But what to do? Some people
get everything they ask for.

2047
01:52:49,297 --> 01:52:55,475
Like my husband. He got everything
that he wished for in life.

2048
01:52:56,204 --> 01:52:59,048
Instead of thinking to
buy a thing or not..

2049
01:52:59,107 --> 01:53:02,350
...one has to think that
does he really needs it.

2050
01:53:03,378 --> 01:53:04,413
You're right.

2051
01:53:05,714 --> 01:53:10,129
If she comes to me by herself,
I'll surely accept her.

2052
01:53:11,987 --> 01:53:13,057
I can understand.

2053
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:15,734
Since childhood, she's
been brought up in poverty.

2054
01:53:16,725 --> 01:53:19,638
She has done this
mistake to become rich.

2055
01:53:20,595 --> 01:53:23,667
There's a meaning to love
only when you forgive mistakes.

2056
01:53:24,065 --> 01:53:25,135
Am I right?

2057
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,744
You're ready to accept your
husband who left you for her.

2058
01:53:30,605 --> 01:53:32,585
Mine is not a big problem.

2059
01:53:33,141 --> 01:53:35,712
Raja, you're a very good man.

2060
01:53:38,046 --> 01:53:39,252
Just tell me what I have to do?

2061
01:53:39,714 --> 01:53:41,523
You have to come on
Wednesday on this address.

2062
01:53:42,217 --> 01:53:43,287
There?

2063
01:53:43,618 --> 01:53:46,622
One drinks tea in the afternoon,
who drinks whiskey at 4 o'clock?

2064
01:53:46,688 --> 01:53:48,292
Yes, they drink. In Australia.

2065
01:53:48,556 --> 01:53:50,695
Here if it is 4 o'clock. It
is nightfall in Australia.

2066
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:54,306
Why this party? - For some
reason I am calling you. Come.

2067
01:53:54,629 --> 01:53:57,166
You had been to Australia.
- I didn't go.

2068
01:53:57,232 --> 01:53:58,575
Okay, I went. You please come.

2069
01:53:59,233 --> 01:54:01,770
If you drink whiskey at home,
won't Shanti feel bad?

2070
01:54:02,037 --> 01:54:03,243
She's gone out of town.

2071
01:54:04,573 --> 01:54:06,985
You're giving a party as
your wife isn't in the town.

2072
01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:10,588
But you're enjoying daily even
though your wife is at home.

2073
01:54:10,612 --> 01:54:14,685
Be quiet.
- Strange. you're blushing.

2074
01:54:15,283 --> 01:54:19,993
Don't forget. Wednesday at 4. no.
66. There's a beautifuL.

2075
01:54:20,054 --> 01:54:21,465
I know,
there's a swimming pool there.

2076
01:54:21,523 --> 01:54:27,997
Yes. A married couple means.

2077
01:54:29,197 --> 01:54:31,074
How many times will
you read it? Enough now.

2078
01:54:31,133 --> 01:54:33,010
I remember everything here.
Just for warm up..

2079
01:54:33,067 --> 01:54:34,137
Do something else.

2080
01:54:35,002 --> 01:54:36,345
Something else..

2081
01:54:36,404 --> 01:54:40,011
Oh brother, friendship is
greater than everything..

2082
01:54:40,075 --> 01:54:41,748
Can I say that dialogue?
- What is it?

2083
01:54:42,077 --> 01:54:43,454
That's my college dialogue.

2084
01:54:44,011 --> 01:54:45,149
Oh God.

2085
01:54:45,614 --> 01:54:50,495
The next line is even better.
You take friendship to be..

2086
01:54:50,552 --> 01:54:53,032
Don't say anything. Just read this.
That would be enough.

2087
01:54:55,623 --> 01:54:57,762
I am not able to see
anything in tension.

2088
01:55:09,704 --> 01:55:11,047
Did you finish reading?
- Yes.

2089
01:55:11,506 --> 01:55:14,043
Hide it somewhere inside.
No one should see.

2090
01:55:14,576 --> 01:55:17,113
Oh God.
- No one can see.

2091
01:55:19,113 --> 01:55:22,094
It is 4.
- Yes, it has to.

2092
01:55:24,052 --> 01:55:25,998
Did you hear it too?
- Yes, it is ringing.

2093
01:55:26,054 --> 01:55:27,124
I am talking about my heartbeat.

2094
01:55:27,389 --> 01:55:29,130
I feel like it may burst anytime.

2095
01:55:30,191 --> 01:55:31,261
What happened?

2096
01:55:31,326 --> 01:55:32,396
Forget that.

2097
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,667
Some or other will come..
you go to that room..

2098
01:55:35,063 --> 01:55:36,133
Why are you going there?

2099
01:55:36,197 --> 01:55:37,267
You told me to..

2100
01:55:37,332 --> 01:55:38,675
Come here, sit here.

2101
01:55:43,404 --> 01:55:45,281
Don't act like this.

2102
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:49,345
You'll lock Priya
and Raja in that room.

2103
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:51,219
Okay, fine.

2104
01:55:51,613 --> 01:55:55,026
I'll be there upstairs.
You and my husband should..

2105
01:55:55,049 --> 01:55:57,290
...have drinks in that room.

2106
01:55:57,552 --> 01:55:59,088
This is what the main problem is.

2107
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,290
What's the problem?

2108
01:56:00,355 --> 01:56:03,234
Drinking. lam a diabetic.
I don't want to drink.

2109
01:56:03,558 --> 01:56:05,629
You have to drink at least
to get back my husband to me.

2110
01:56:05,693 --> 01:56:06,967
Please.

2111
01:56:07,562 --> 01:56:09,974
The government has put a
board all over the city..

2112
01:56:10,031 --> 01:56:11,510
...stating booze ruins houses.

2113
01:56:11,566 --> 01:56:15,309
But here, the booze is
going to save a house.

2114
01:56:16,104 --> 01:56:20,177
Give me a plastic bag for safety.
- Why?

2115
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:28,586
Hey! What are you doing?
- Father, where's no. 9 spanner?

2116
01:56:28,616 --> 01:56:29,993
You were repairing the handicam now..

2117
01:56:30,051 --> 01:56:32,258
...why do you need a spanner?
- I got it.

2118
01:56:33,521 --> 01:56:35,467
Go out! Go out!

2119
01:56:37,325 --> 01:56:43,332
He'll either become a
sportsman or a mechanic.

2120
01:56:43,398 --> 01:56:45,071
It will take minimum
ten years for both.

2121
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:46,271
Can we finish this work now?

2122
01:56:47,401 --> 01:56:50,007
Doctor, don't worry. If
everything goes fine..

2123
01:56:50,071 --> 01:56:53,746
...you and sister Shanti go to
Thirupati and give your hair.

2124
01:56:54,275 --> 01:56:55,345
Lord Thimappa.

2125
01:56:55,743 --> 01:56:59,418
Do you expect us to go to
Thirupati and become bald?

2126
01:57:00,214 --> 01:57:02,125
Don't go there, if you
find Thirupati is far.

2127
01:57:02,217 --> 01:57:03,287
Go to Nanjangudi.

2128
01:57:03,418 --> 01:57:05,762
Whatever it is, why
should I become bald?

2129
01:57:06,087 --> 01:57:08,033
People sacrifice their
head for friendship.

2130
01:57:08,089 --> 01:57:09,159
...cant you sacrifice
your little hair?

2131
01:57:09,223 --> 01:57:12,033
Yes, I could've plucked it
right now if it was one or tvvo..

2132
01:57:12,093 --> 01:57:14,505
But why do you have to ask
in wholesale? - Doctor..

2133
01:57:18,165 --> 01:57:19,508
Somebody's come. I'll go upstairs.

2134
01:57:19,768 --> 01:57:22,044
Where are you going?
Who'll open the door?

2135
01:57:22,103 --> 01:57:23,776
L..
- Yes, leave.

2136
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:25,581
If I get some doubt?

2137
01:57:25,707 --> 01:57:27,243
Call me, I'll be there.

2138
01:57:27,709 --> 01:57:29,518
What if you get a doubt?

2139
01:57:29,577 --> 01:57:30,647
No, I wont have any doubt.

2140
01:57:30,678 --> 01:57:31,782
If you have?

2141
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,286
I'll call you.

2142
01:57:33,348 --> 01:57:34,452
They can hear you then.

2143
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:36,153
Yes.

2144
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:38,787
Think of some signal. Signal! Coming!

2145
01:57:39,054 --> 01:57:40,124
SignaL.

2146
01:57:41,322 --> 01:57:42,596
I'll bark like a clog. Come to me.

2147
01:57:42,657 --> 01:57:46,195
Fantastic. Excuse me. Bark once.

2148
01:57:49,264 --> 01:57:51,335
You bark same like a dog. Very good.

2149
01:57:58,273 --> 01:57:59,809
Hello.
- Hello.

2150
01:58:00,809 --> 01:58:03,415
Hello, sir. - This is a
house and not phone, tell me.

2151
01:58:04,045 --> 01:58:07,219
Raja.
- No, I am Shyam Sajjan. Doctor.

2152
01:58:07,415 --> 01:58:10,362
Sir.. sir.. lam Raja.

2153
01:58:11,486 --> 01:58:14,626
No. 66.. Swimming pool,
Bhama's house..

2154
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:17,226
Oh, you're flash back Raja.
Please, come in.

2155
01:58:17,425 --> 01:58:18,495
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2156
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:25,510
Sorry, welcome.

2157
01:58:25,567 --> 01:58:27,308
I have to welcome you in my house,
instead you're welcoming me.

2158
01:58:27,368 --> 01:58:28,642
No problem. Same to you.

2159
01:58:30,505 --> 01:58:31,643
Sir, Mrs. BhamamanL.

2160
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,583
She's gone to the neighbor's house.

2161
01:58:33,641 --> 01:58:35,052
Fine, I'll come later then.

2162
01:58:35,777 --> 01:58:37,085
You've come to the right house.

2163
01:58:37,278 --> 01:58:38,689
Bhamamani is my sister.

2164
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,559
Ram is my childhood friend.

2165
01:58:40,648 --> 01:58:43,254
ShantL. my dog is calling me.

2166
01:58:45,386 --> 01:58:46,797
Is your dog's name Shanti?

2167
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,532
Yes. Yes.

2168
01:58:49,057 --> 01:58:50,195
Where is it? -Here, down.

2169
01:58:54,529 --> 01:58:58,739
Not here. Just because the dog is
here, we'll go to the other room.

2170
01:59:02,069 --> 01:59:03,742
Hey, Shanti, keep quiet.

2171
01:59:04,472 --> 01:59:05,746
I could hear it from here.

2172
01:59:06,474 --> 01:59:09,546
That is another dog. Kanti.
Only two..

2173
01:59:09,744 --> 01:59:12,054
I've decided that
I shouldn't have more than two.

2174
01:59:12,147 --> 01:59:13,217
Dogly planning. Please, come.

2175
01:59:13,247 --> 01:59:18,697
This?
- This is Chitti, my neighbor's dog.

2176
01:59:19,421 --> 01:59:20,559
What is it doing here?

2177
01:59:22,357 --> 01:59:24,030
When Bhamamani goes
to neighbor's house..

2178
01:59:24,092 --> 01:59:27,232
...Chintamani comes to our house.
Come in. Come in.

2179
01:59:28,095 --> 01:59:33,101
Chinti, go. Sit here.
Okay, you're sitting there.

2180
01:59:33,167 --> 01:59:34,703
Sir..
- Nothing, be seated.

2181
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,190
Did you say something?

2182
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:55,394
Sir, your dog is barking.

2183
01:59:57,325 --> 01:59:58,804
Couldn't you say it before?
It is a signal.

2184
01:59:59,127 --> 02:00:01,403
Tea, coffee, or something.
Don't want. - Sir..

2185
02:00:03,064 --> 02:00:04,543
Read this. I'll be right back.

2186
02:00:19,647 --> 02:00:21,024
Why are you whistling at me?

2187
02:00:21,048 --> 02:00:22,118
You were barking, so I called you.

2188
02:00:22,217 --> 02:00:24,356
Barking is the only signal.
Only I'll bark.

2189
02:00:40,234 --> 02:00:42,646
What special, you're
drinking in the afternoon?

2190
02:00:43,104 --> 02:00:45,175
It is a bit risky, but in
flight they serve you all the time.

2191
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,119
Sir, it is telephone directory.
-So what?

2192
02:00:48,376 --> 02:00:51,084
Read yellow pages,
it is good. Go inside.

2193
02:00:51,379 --> 02:00:52,449
Get inside!

2194
02:00:54,448 --> 02:00:57,122
Who is it?
- He is old boyfriend. - Whose?

2195
02:00:57,585 --> 02:01:01,590
Mine.. he is whiskey supplier.

2196
02:01:02,123 --> 02:01:05,070
Come. Come. Let's party.

2197
02:01:05,126 --> 02:01:07,003
You've kept only one
bottle here and were speaking.

2198
02:01:07,061 --> 02:01:08,131
...like a bar owner.

2199
02:01:08,196 --> 02:01:10,142
You have even a supplier for it.
- Which supplier?

2200
02:01:10,197 --> 02:01:11,267
The one we just met downstairs.

2201
02:01:11,332 --> 02:01:12,538
Yes, whiskey supplier.

2202
02:01:20,741 --> 02:01:23,551
What next?
- Nothing, I'll be right back.

2203
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:25,649
Where are you going?
- The dog is barking.

2204
02:01:25,747 --> 02:01:28,227
Am I important or the dog?
- It is yours.

2205
02:01:28,249 --> 02:01:30,024
Which one?
- That one..

2206
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:32,355
Coming!

2207
02:01:34,355 --> 02:01:37,700
You're drinking.
Priya is here. Go down.

2208
02:01:40,628 --> 02:01:41,766
Mr. Priyen.
- Yes.

2209
02:01:43,164 --> 02:01:45,041
Please, come in.
- Hello. - Hello, welcome.

2210
02:01:46,234 --> 02:01:47,645
You said you want to talk to me.

2211
02:01:47,701 --> 02:01:49,374
Come inside.
I'll tell you everything.

2212
02:01:49,437 --> 02:01:51,781
There's a good news waiting for you.

2213
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:03,451
Priya.

2214
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:08,463
What is it? Keep quiet.

2215
02:02:11,192 --> 02:02:12,262
Shall we start?

2216
02:02:12,326 --> 02:02:14,067
I've already started. Here, have it.

2217
02:02:14,662 --> 02:02:15,732
Cheers.

2218
02:02:16,597 --> 02:02:18,736
What next?
- Nothing. Cheers.

2219
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,079
We did, didn't we?
- Let's cheer for the second time.

2220
02:02:23,071 --> 02:02:24,277
Hey, you drank it ravv.

2221
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,613
Couldn't you tell me earlier?

2222
02:02:31,145 --> 02:02:33,125
What next?
- Nothing.

2223
02:02:43,357 --> 02:02:47,237
Priya, wipe your tears.
lam here for you.

2224
02:02:49,697 --> 02:02:51,040
Forget everything that happened.

2225
02:02:52,433 --> 02:02:57,041
You know that money is not
everything in life, isn't it?

2226
02:02:58,506 --> 02:03:02,249
We both united finally.
That's more than enough for me.

2227
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:04,380
That's more than enough for me.

2228
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:09,428
Super drink! I enjoyed your party.

2229
02:03:09,483 --> 02:03:12,259
Enjoyed. -V\/hat next?
- Nothing.

2230
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:16,461
We'll have one more drink.
What a lovely party, pal.

2231
02:03:16,523 --> 02:03:23,737
Super. There was a soda
bottle here. Where did it go?

2232
02:03:23,998 --> 02:03:28,140
No, it wasn't there. - ls it
downstairs? - How did you know?

2233
02:03:28,403 --> 02:03:30,212
I know you would've
kept it in the fridge.

2234
02:03:30,738 --> 02:03:33,014
Go and get it.
- You go and get it.

2235
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:35,015
You're too much.

2236
02:03:35,076 --> 02:03:40,025
You'll find a chilled soda bottle in
the fridge. Hey, last room. - Okay.

2237
02:03:52,693 --> 02:03:54,297
Oops, sorry.

2238
02:03:58,499 --> 02:04:01,776
Hey, hovv dare you!
- Who are you! - Ram!

2239
02:04:02,103 --> 02:04:04,174
Ram, let go off him!
- You get lost from here!

2240
02:04:04,371 --> 02:04:05,441
Why are you hitting me?

2241
02:04:14,015 --> 02:04:15,085
Coming.

2242
02:04:15,182 --> 02:04:17,128
Lord Thimappa. See,
what's going on there.

2243
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:20,728
Not there, go there.
- Oh Lord Thimappa.

2244
02:04:21,989 --> 02:04:24,993
Hey, let go off him. Ram!
- Lord Thimappa.

2245
02:04:25,059 --> 02:04:28,063
Raja, let go off him. Stop it.

2246
02:04:30,531 --> 02:04:32,272
Put me down. Put me down.

2247
02:04:32,333 --> 02:04:36,076
I am a doctor. Don't fight like kids.

2248
02:04:37,204 --> 02:04:41,414
Bhama. -Hey, look there. Look there.

2249
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:43,614
Hey, she is sleeping
with a whiskey supplier.

2250
02:04:43,644 --> 02:04:45,214
Who's a whiskey supplier? - You!

2251
02:04:45,345 --> 02:04:46,415
Who said so?
- He.

2252
02:04:46,447 --> 02:04:47,517
Let go off me.

2253
02:04:50,084 --> 02:04:57,024
Look there. Do you think it is good?

2254
02:04:57,091 --> 02:04:58,229
They must be liking it.

2255
02:04:58,292 --> 02:05:01,364
Hey, you're a betrayer.

2256
02:05:01,429 --> 02:05:03,568
I bought fridge for you,
plasma TV for you..

2257
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:06,237
Plasma TV?
- I bought her a flat.

2258
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,371
Flat plasma TV?
- Original flat.

2259
02:05:08,569 --> 02:05:09,980
Three bedroom flat.

2260
02:05:10,037 --> 02:05:11,380
Look at her. How she is behaving.

2261
02:05:11,438 --> 02:05:14,044
She is having fun with
the whiskey supplier.

2262
02:05:14,508 --> 02:05:15,578
Shame on her! - What?

2263
02:05:15,642 --> 02:05:17,019
Who whiskey supplier?
- You!

2264
02:05:17,077 --> 02:05:18,988
Who? - Raja! - You called me
home and are humiliating me.

2265
02:05:19,013 --> 02:05:20,185
Who called you home?

2266
02:05:20,214 --> 02:05:21,591
He called me home.
- Why did you do so?

2267
02:05:21,615 --> 02:05:24,994
Shut up! Let me talk.
- Go ahead!

2268
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,990
If you shout, I'll forget everything.

2269
02:05:31,225 --> 02:05:33,000
What do you think a married life is?

2270
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,130
What?

2271
02:05:35,596 --> 02:05:40,670
Married life means. I had
written it in this. that two..

2272
02:05:40,735 --> 02:05:43,181
...that is two hearts
filled with love..

2273
02:05:43,237 --> 02:05:44,409
Listen to me, first.

2274
02:05:45,306 --> 02:05:48,412
If you go this way and she that way,
the life will get ruined.

2275
02:05:48,476 --> 02:05:50,649
When the hen named wife
is at home, this crow..

2276
02:05:50,744 --> 02:05:52,348
...this shouldn't be said now..

2277
02:05:52,413 --> 02:05:54,222
Are you mad?

2278
02:05:54,248 --> 02:05:56,023
Hey, what are you talking?

2279
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:57,495
I said it extra. Come with me.

2280
02:05:57,551 --> 02:06:00,259
Where? Her wish.. you come with me.

2281
02:06:00,321 --> 02:06:02,699
Do you expect me to leave her alone'?
- The supplier is with her.

2282
02:06:02,756 --> 02:06:03,996
I'll teach you a lesson.

2283
02:06:04,959 --> 02:06:06,961
She forgot everything that
I gave her and she is enjoying..

2284
02:06:07,027 --> 02:06:08,233
...with the supplier there.

2285
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:13,440
Peddusn
- Oh great.

2286
02:06:14,268 --> 02:06:15,576
You recognized her.

2287
02:06:16,336 --> 02:06:18,976
She's here.. - If I get angry,
I'll break your teeth.

2288
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:21,979
Life is like a..
- Boat.

2289
02:06:22,042 --> 02:06:23,112
Yes, I've written everything.

2290
02:06:23,177 --> 02:06:24,986
If the boat of the life should sail..

2291
02:06:25,012 --> 02:06:26,582
...you should use love as row..

2292
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:28,616
Sister Bhama.

2293
02:06:29,283 --> 02:06:32,492
Shall I tell you something? This
looks like old cinema dialogues.

2294
02:06:32,653 --> 02:06:34,064
Shall I say some other dialogues?

2295
02:06:35,289 --> 02:06:38,202
You're here? To above all is..

2296
02:06:38,259 --> 02:06:39,329
I know.. friendship.

2297
02:06:39,393 --> 02:06:40,736
No, I've changed the sentence.

2298
02:06:41,195 --> 02:06:43,197
To above all is married life.

2299
02:06:43,531 --> 02:06:47,604
You crazy guy, you're asking
about the value of good life.

2300
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:50,437
Many people sacrificed
their lives for love.

2301
02:06:50,537 --> 02:06:53,609
That is married life.
What did you say there?

2302
02:06:54,275 --> 02:06:56,551
You were calling her betrayer,
but you're betrayer.

2303
02:06:57,011 --> 02:06:59,617
You were telling her that you bought
a fridge, TV, and flat for her..

2304
02:07:00,114 --> 02:07:01,149
What did you give her?

2305
02:07:01,615 --> 02:07:04,619
You gave two children to her.
What did you give those kids?

2306
02:07:05,353 --> 02:07:06,423
A tag of orphan.

2307
02:07:07,621 --> 02:07:08,691
Isn't it right?

2308
02:07:10,357 --> 02:07:11,427
Everything is alright now.

2309
02:07:11,492 --> 02:07:13,096
Everything is alright now.
- Good, you taught him a lesson.

2310
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,332
Hey, shut up! Don't talk.

2311
02:07:14,394 --> 02:07:16,635
Fine, you talk to her.
- I finished.

2312
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:20,773
You talk.
- What do I say? I am sorry.

2313
02:07:21,268 --> 02:07:23,305
Don't ask sorry from me,
apologize to her.

2314
02:07:23,571 --> 02:07:26,415
I have to fall on her
feet for the mistake I did.

2315
02:07:26,473 --> 02:07:27,543
Yes, fall on her feet.

2316
02:07:28,542 --> 02:07:29,714
No. no..

2317
02:07:30,644 --> 02:07:33,056
Look, that's a woman.
- Who'?

2318
02:07:33,647 --> 02:07:37,060
It is you.
- Peddus.

2319
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:41,258
Embrace. Embrace. Not me, to her.

2320
02:07:43,657 --> 02:07:44,727
How can we do it in your presence?

2321
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:49,539
You both united, let me
go and have a look there.

2322
02:07:53,567 --> 02:07:56,104
I am so sorry. Forgive me, Peddus.

2323
02:07:57,671 --> 02:08:01,585
I am sorry. Continue, continue.
Young age.

2324
02:08:02,076 --> 02:08:05,546
But be careful, my son
would've kept the handicam on.

2325
02:08:09,516 --> 02:08:15,364
Brother.. thank you very much.
You opened my eyes.

2326
02:08:16,323 --> 02:08:17,700
Did you close your eyes till now?

2327
02:08:18,025 --> 02:08:19,095
Thank Raja.

2328
02:08:23,664 --> 02:08:26,167
I'll never forget in my life.

2329
02:08:28,268 --> 02:08:29,338
Even, I'll not forget you.

2330
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:33,143
Thanks.
- Don't mention.

2331
02:08:37,277 --> 02:08:40,486
If my wife would've seen
this good deed that I did..

2332
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:44,790
I wanted to tell that
Bhama would've felt happy.

2333
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,260
Oh God.
- Hello.

2334
02:08:49,056 --> 02:08:52,128
You're holding someone
in front of me?

2335
02:08:52,259 --> 02:08:54,170
You know who she is, don't you?

2336
02:08:54,228 --> 02:08:56,071
Yes, I know. She is an airhostess.

2337
02:08:56,129 --> 02:08:58,109
...who gives chocolate in the plane.

2338
02:08:58,598 --> 02:09:01,078
Seeing that I am not at home,
you both got united and..

2339
02:09:01,134 --> 02:09:04,274
...have opened a
chocolate shop in my house.

2340
02:09:05,306 --> 02:09:07,445
Sorry. Don't say
whatever you feel like.

2341
02:09:07,508 --> 02:09:08,612
Think before you talk.

2342
02:09:09,476 --> 02:09:10,546
The one who don't have respect.

2343
02:09:10,611 --> 02:09:12,056
...why do I need to think
before speaking about them.

2344
02:09:13,013 --> 02:09:14,617
I am ruined.
- Correct

2345
02:09:14,648 --> 02:09:16,321
You ruined my life.
- We'll go inside and..

2346
02:09:16,383 --> 02:09:18,693
I shouldn't have come to this house.
- Okay, we'll sit here.

2347
02:09:18,752 --> 02:09:21,494
Get up!

2348
02:09:21,555 --> 02:09:25,697
You've done such a cheap deed.
My stomach is burning.

2349
02:09:25,759 --> 02:09:27,705
You can have gelusil
and milk of magnesia.

2350
02:09:27,761 --> 02:09:29,331
Yes, you'll make me drink that.

2351
02:09:29,396 --> 02:09:31,273
If you wish, you'll give me poison.

2352
02:09:31,632 --> 02:09:35,045
What are you up to? To be
with her, you took me to Goa.

2353
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:39,380
...you even sang a song with me.

2354
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:42,785
You cheated me and made me pregnant.

2355
02:09:43,043 --> 02:09:45,649
Pregnant? Hey, you didn't tell me.

2356
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:52,358
Get lost. - Hey Kumar! A new
baby is coming in our house.

2357
02:09:54,054 --> 02:09:56,125
ShantL.
- What is it?

2358
02:09:56,390 --> 02:09:58,666
There was a tiffin box inside it.

2359
02:09:59,126 --> 02:10:02,596
If I knew you would do like this
to me, I would've brought a stone.

2360
02:10:03,064 --> 02:10:06,534
Listen, you have to decide today.
This house or that house?

2361
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,670
What do you mean?

2362
02:10:08,402 --> 02:10:11,008
I was asking whether you'll
stay with your wife or girlfriend.

2363
02:10:11,071 --> 02:10:13,677
Oh, I just now solved one case.

2364
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,185
I would've left it unsolved.

2365
02:10:16,009 --> 02:10:21,322
What? Oh God, did she
do something with you?

2366
02:10:22,249 --> 02:10:23,489
You misunderstand everything.

2367
02:10:23,551 --> 02:10:28,125
You're an illiterate.
You are a fool. Sorry.

2368
02:10:33,294 --> 02:10:37,242
Shanti, ShantL. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

2369
02:10:37,297 --> 02:10:39,777
To hell with your sorry.
get lost from here.

2370
02:10:40,033 --> 02:10:44,072
My father warned me not to get
married to highly educated man.

2371
02:10:44,137 --> 02:10:46,310
Don't say that. I'll
teach you everything.

2372
02:10:46,373 --> 02:10:47,443
Get lost from here.

2373
02:10:47,574 --> 02:10:48,780
Sister Shanti, when did you return?

2374
02:10:49,242 --> 02:10:51,654
Sister Bhama, I came
on the right time.

2375
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,149
I caught this man red-handed. Oh God.

2376
02:10:55,248 --> 02:10:56,454
No, I still have more to tell.

2377
02:10:56,516 --> 02:10:57,688
Hey, move your hand from there.

2378
02:10:58,419 --> 02:11:02,663
Sister Bhama, if you hear what
this man did, you'll commit suicide.

2379
02:11:02,723 --> 02:11:04,999
Oh, doctor. What did you do?

2380
02:11:06,059 --> 02:11:07,129
Sister Shaman.

2381
02:11:07,261 --> 02:11:09,366
Why are you staring at her?
- What did you do?

2382
02:11:12,099 --> 02:11:13,442
Did you call me?
- That's barking.

2383
02:11:15,002 --> 02:11:16,675
Shut up!
- Hey Shanti, don't bark!

2384
02:11:17,271 --> 02:11:19,046
What did you say?
- I just told the dog not to bark.

2385
02:11:19,105 --> 02:11:21,016
You said, Shanti.
- Yes, the dog's name is Shanti.

2386
02:11:21,075 --> 02:11:22,179
Who said so?
- He told me.

2387
02:11:22,609 --> 02:11:26,250
Oh husband. did you say so?

2388
02:11:28,115 --> 02:11:30,026
As soon as you met
the chocolate seller..

2389
02:11:30,084 --> 02:11:31,620
...you named your wife as dog.

2390
02:11:31,685 --> 02:11:34,632
Doctor! - I told this
to bring everyone together.

2391
02:11:34,688 --> 02:11:36,634
But everyone is hitting me now.

2392
02:11:36,757 --> 02:11:40,466
Excuse me. Any problem?

2393
02:11:40,627 --> 02:11:43,039
Hey, don't pretend.
Everything happened because of you..

2394
02:11:43,096 --> 02:11:45,440
...and now you're asking
if there's any problem.

2395
02:11:45,566 --> 02:11:49,309
You all are pretending as
though nothing happened.

2396
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:50,440
I know everything.

2397
02:11:50,504 --> 02:11:53,041
You shut up! In Goa
you pretended as though.

2398
02:11:53,107 --> 02:11:54,313
...you don't know each other.

2399
02:11:54,574 --> 02:11:58,750
I introduced you and
you greeted each other.

2400
02:12:00,381 --> 02:12:07,321
Oh, I know.. my husband
had brought her to Goa.

2401
02:12:07,387 --> 02:12:09,993
Tell her..
- What do I say?

2402
02:12:10,057 --> 02:12:12,003
Say something.
- Why did you take her to Goa.

2403
02:12:12,058 --> 02:12:14,231
...leaving your beautiful wife behind.

2404
02:12:14,595 --> 02:12:16,165
You sinner!

2405
02:12:17,064 --> 02:12:19,010
Come here! Why are you
addressing him as sinner?

2406
02:12:19,166 --> 02:12:23,512
You did all the wrong things.
and you're calling him as sinner.

2407
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:24,641
Madam, you're getting it wrong.

2408
02:12:24,705 --> 02:12:26,378
Shut up! Who called you here?
- He.

2409
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:29,284
Oh God, sister Bhama.
You're like my sister..

2410
02:12:29,343 --> 02:12:30,651
Help me out. What do I say now?

2411
02:12:30,744 --> 02:12:33,725
Don't say anything and
be quiet. Sister ShantL.

2412
02:12:34,014 --> 02:12:36,016
Sister Bhama,
you don't know anything.

2413
02:12:36,049 --> 02:12:37,153
So, please be quiet.

2414

She knows everything.
You Know how all this started?

2415
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:45,698
Paper? ls it published in the
paper that you're living with her?

2416
02:12:45,759 --> 02:12:50,299
Oh God. I don't want
to live. I want to die.

2417
02:12:50,364 --> 02:12:51,434
Oh ho.

2418
02:12:52,099 --> 02:12:55,569
You're standing quietly.
Now you sat down.

2419
02:12:55,635 --> 02:12:56,705
Go and stop her.

2420
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:59,307
Everyone is giving me
so much trouble.

2421
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:03,046

02:13:22,529 --> 02:13:25,635
Oh God.

2433
02:13:39,346 --> 02:13:43,294
ShantL. listen..
- Hey, move aside. - Who are you?

2434

02:13:45,352 --> 02:13:47,423
Get lost. Go and die!

2436
02:13:47,487 --> 02:13:49,194
Oh God, he doesn't know to swim.

2437
02:13:49,289 --> 02:13:53,533
Oh, Bhama fell in the water.
She doesn't know to swim.

2438
02:13:53,694 --> 02:13:56,334
Hey, go and save her.

2439
02:13:56,396 --> 02:13:58,069
She is your wife,

2440
02:13:58,265 --> 02:13:59,335
Even I don't know to swim.

2441

Do you know to swim?
- Yes.

2443
02:14:05,973 --> 02:14:07,145
But I have some other work to do.

Wait, lam coming with you.

2449
02:14:24,491 --> 02:14:25,561
Hey, what are you doing here?

2450
02:14:25,626 --> 02:14:27,606
Forget that. Who took the car?

2451
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:29,404
Your mother, she's angry.

2452
02:14:29,663 --> 02:14:31,734
She'll return in half an hour now.

2453
02:14:32,232 --> 02:14:33,643
The car can't stop.

2454
02:14:34,067 --> 02:14:36,343
Vvhy?
- The break is in my hand.

2455
02:14:37,638 --> 02:14:39,015
Your mother doesn't have a break.

2456
02:14:39,105 --> 02:14:40,448
Not mother, but the
car doesn't have break.

2457
02:14:40,507 --> 02:14:45,149
Shanti! Where's the handle in this?

2458
02:14:45,445 --> 02:14:46,515
It is here.

2459
02:14:47,147 --> 02:14:50,685
You've fixed it this side.
Sit behind.

2460
02:14:51,084 --> 02:14:52,154
Come on, hurry up.

2461
02:14:52,218 --> 02:14:53,288
Somebody save me.

2462
02:14:59,626 --> 02:15:02,334
Shanti!
- Mother! - Shanti!

2463
02:15:02,763 --> 02:15:05,972
This car will not go to your village,
but will go to Ivlangalore.

2464
02:15:06,133 --> 02:15:08,977
I'll drown myself in the sea there.

2465
02:15:09,236 --> 02:15:10,476
Father, tell her that
there's no break in it.

2466
02:15:10,537 --> 02:15:14,349
She'll get a shock. I'll tell
it later. I am a doctor, I know.

2467
02:15:14,608 --> 02:15:16,417
After she dies?

2468
02:15:24,718 --> 02:15:29,531
Shanti, I'll tell you something.
Don't get shocked.

2469
02:15:29,723 --> 02:15:33,261
I am not shocked, but ruined.
You've kept that girl with you.

2470
02:15:34,227 --> 02:15:38,266
Son, you tell me..
you want mother or father?

2471
02:15:38,365 --> 02:15:39,537
I want both of them, mother.

2472
02:15:40,334 --> 02:15:41,404
Did you hear that?

2473
02:15:41,468 --> 02:15:44,415
Yes, he wants both of them.
He is same like his father.

2474
02:15:45,005 --> 02:15:47,246
Don't. there's no break in the car.

2475
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,717
Truck!
- Let it be!

2476
02:15:56,716 --> 02:15:59,458
Don't go to her again. I bind
you with the oath of Thimappa.

2477
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,700
Father, bring the bike near
to the car.

2478
02:16:02,756 --> 02:16:05,703
Yes, I'll. But son tell
me before you do anything.

2479
02:16:07,527 --> 02:16:12,977
Shanti, forget about us,
at least think about our son..

2480
02:16:13,066 --> 02:16:15,478
Kumar Kanteerva! Did you fall down?

2481
02:16:16,102 --> 02:16:18,275
You killed my son.

2482
02:16:18,438 --> 02:16:21,510
I lose my son.
- Mother.

2483
02:16:21,574 --> 02:16:24,214
Mother, I am here.
- Oh my child.

2484
02:16:30,217 --> 02:16:32,390
Shanti!

2485
02:16:35,322 --> 02:16:36,426
Priya.

2486
02:17:15,028 --> 02:17:16,632
Father, be careful. Don't fall.

2487
02:17:16,696 --> 02:17:19,267
Hey, keep quiet.
Let him fall and die.

2488
02:17:24,404 --> 02:17:26,645
Hey doctor, get down!

2489
02:17:26,707 --> 02:17:31,178
Get down? I came inside
with great difficulty.

2490
02:17:31,578 --> 02:17:32,682
How do I get down now?

2491
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,390
<i>Shank.
- Hey, move your hand.</i>

2492
02:17:37,784 --> 02:17:40,594
Go left.
- No, I'll go right.

2493
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:48,205
Now right. - No, why should I
listen to you? I'll go left.

2494
02:17:49,663 --> 02:17:51,734
Your mother is doing
opposite of whatever I say.

2495
02:17:52,332 --> 02:17:54,573
Tell her not to go home.
She'll return.

2496
02:17:54,734 --> 02:17:56,145
Okay. Fine.

2497
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:59,310
Don't take a U-turn.
You'll get our house.

2498
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:00,710
Yes, I'll.

2499
02:18:07,614 --> 02:18:10,117
Oh, Lord Thimappa.

2500
02:18:11,751 --> 02:18:14,698
Our house. Don't go to our house.
Go to neighbor's house.

2501
02:18:15,555 --> 02:18:17,091
Do you want to go
to neighbor's house?

2502
02:18:17,157 --> 02:18:18,363
I'll take you to my house.
- Okay.

2503
02:18:21,494 --> 02:18:22,564
Go inside the gate.

2504
02:18:23,096 --> 02:18:26,305
I'll go inside the compound.
- Compound!

2505
02:18:29,035 --> 02:18:30,173
Mother!

2506
02:18:41,548 --> 02:18:43,118
Doctor, what happened to you?

2507
02:18:43,183 --> 02:18:44,253
What happened to me?

2508
02:18:44,317 --> 02:18:46,627
I am very sorry. Forgive me, please.

2509
02:18:46,686 --> 02:18:48,393
Mother. Mother.

2510
02:18:48,454 --> 02:18:49,694
What is it?
- Mother, this is my hand.

2511
02:18:51,191 --> 02:18:52,261
Where's your leg?

2512
02:18:52,759 --> 02:18:55,740
I am very sorry.

2513
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:58,536
That's not my leg.
I have my leg with me.

2514
02:18:58,598 --> 02:19:03,172
Doctor, I made a mistake.

2515
02:19:06,473 --> 02:19:09,079
I shouldn't have done this to you.
I am sorry.

2516
02:19:09,509 --> 02:19:10,544
I am sorry.

2517
02:19:12,612 --> 02:19:14,421
Peddus.

2518
02:19:18,151 --> 02:19:20,597
Oh dear. Don't overload it.

2519
02:19:21,454 --> 02:19:24,435
What are you watching?
Go to your house.

2520
02:19:25,759 --> 02:19:28,467
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

2521
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:32,640
"lt is time for the thieves
to start their work."

2522
02:19:34,567 --> 02:19:36,706

02:19:36,769 --> 02:19:39,045
"lt is time for the thieves

2524
02:19:39,105 --> 02:19:43,281
"Keep all your things carefully."

2525
02:19:43,343 --> 02:19:45,448
"Once you lose it,
you'll not find it again."

2526
02:19:45,478 --> 02:19:50,120
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

2527
02:19:51,451 --> 02:19:53,658
"lt is time for the
thieves to start their work."

2528
02:20:14,541 --> 02:20:17,044
"Why? What does it do?"

2529
02:20:17,310 --> 02:20:19,449
"It catches your waist stealthily."

2530
02:20:19,512 --> 02:20:21,719
"It makes you dance on its tunes."

2531
02:20:22,148 --> 02:20:25,391
"Is it so'? TO hell With it."

2532
02:20:26,086 --> 02:20:28,157
"It doesn't get warm
even if you wear a blanket."

2533
02:20:28,221 --> 02:20:30,201
"It doesn't get wet
even if it rains."

2534
02:20:30,256 --> 02:20:32,429
"So, it means it is topsy-turvy?"

2535
02:20:32,492 --> 02:20:34,130
"It gives you an itching."

2536
02:20:34,527 --> 02:20:36,700
"It gives you an itching,
it makes you restless."

2537
02:20:36,763 --> 02:20:38,709
"Without the fire
the body becomes warm."

2538
02:20:38,765 --> 02:20:43,441
"Beware, the nightfall is here."

2539
02:20:45,372 --> 02:20:48,285
"It is time for us to be
awake the whole night."

2540
02:20:48,341 --> 02:20:49,411
"Look there!"
