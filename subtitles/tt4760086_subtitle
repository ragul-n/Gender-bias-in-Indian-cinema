'Hide and seek'

2
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,164
- Have you got my stuff ready?
- Sure...long back

3
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:45,509
2 snake gourds
Some curry leaves

4
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,336
Is it enough?

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,505
1/2 kilo
Rs 10

6
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,307
Take this money

7
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,317
Don't you want
the balance?

8
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,293
(raised voices of vendors)

9
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,752
- Howmuch is this?
- Rs 350

10
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,611
- Must grind some more
- Can't we just grind it in a mixie?

11
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,414
Girl, curry tastes better when spices
are ground on stone the traditional way

12
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,455
Ask your mother
She'll vouch for it

13
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,423
I've heard spicy tales of how
you and mother 'cooked' together

14
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,858
- What?
- Nothing

15
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,975
What?

16
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,247
There's neither rice
nor vegetables here

17
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,720
Will you come home early today?

18
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,585
I'm driving
I'll call you back later

What's up?

21
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,361
Did you stop my auto
just to enquire about me?

22
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,030
Alavi'kka appears to be out of town
I had gone there

23
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,595
There's a courier for him

24
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,302
He must have stepped out
to buy some river fish

25
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,605
Courier?

26
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,010
Leave it in my auto
I'll deliver it

27
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,881
- But it needs his signature
-I can sign, man

28
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,613
- Isn't that good enough?
- Sure

29
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,523
Give it to me

30
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,558
Why are you stinking
like this from every pore?

31
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,899
Don't forget
Or I'll lose my job

32
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,739
Alcohol improves memory power

33
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,003
- Haven't you heard that?
-Sure, I have

34
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:06,873
This one also

35
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,139
Leave it inside the auto

36
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,817
Heard they were having a party,
a get-together or some such thing

37
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,374
So you are in for
a blast today, eh?

38
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,750
Me having a blast?
I'm just a gone case

39
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,948
- Hey! I need to see you later
-Sure, we can meet up

were you, man?

42
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,871
I had to buy all
that you needed, right?

43
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,681
This isn't a Benz car
Lend me a hand, dude

44
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,518
You have to pay extra
for porter service

45

You and your lousy English!

46
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,958
You are eating your heart out
for some booze today?

47
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,462
Later this booze will
eat out your heart for good!

Alavi'kka?

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,057
I'll be back this evening

50
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,535
If you can manage,
I want just 1 peg

51
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,665
Forget that dream

52
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,108
Siddhanh has arranged this
get-together after so many years

53
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,577
Don't you dare
hang around here

54
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,844
That isn't the point
Ages since I had foreign liquor

55
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,678
Just a peg of Scotland

56
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,532
Siddhu's house...?

57
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,540
Please help me
bundle myself in?

58
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,744
Park this car
out of the way?

59
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,784
- Is he at home?
- He'll be back soon

60
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:13,691
- Dude...? Can you buy me a bottle?
- Dry day today, sir

61
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,824
'Moonshine' will do

62
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,926
You know... 'battery water'?
That will do

63
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,867
Let me try, sir

64
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,631
Hey! My sandals
Must be left outside

65
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,285
Can I get you
something to drink?

ls Annie really a fashion designer?

tolerate him I wonder

I have work to do

Now tell me

120
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,437
Where is your mobile?

121
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,203
In the toilet

122
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,408
I've been trying to
reach you whole of last year

123
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,178
And it's always switched off
Where did you lose it?

124
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,512
- I dropped it into the closet
-What?

125
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,489
- Put it into the toilet
- Toilet?

126
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,153
Yes, it would have
gone deep into the earth

127
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,489
And disappeared by now

128
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,529
You just haven't
changed one bit

129
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,424
I did it deliberately

130
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:56,930
Ad-agencies hire talented people
for their creative department

131
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,101
And then ask them to
create utter nonsense

132
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,578
Why do you agree to
write all that nonsense?

133
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,614
You are capable of
earning in millions

134
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,171
Just focus on that

135
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,046
Don't go back
to your old ways

136
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,608
So nowl must earn millions

137
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:09,882
What else?

138
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:14,254
Car, house and wife, don't excite me.

139
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,452
And go in search of myself

140
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,492
At least that way
I don't lose myself

141
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,461
Stop all this existentialism stuff

142
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,430
This was your problem
all along in life

143
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,559
lam going in search of myself

144
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:30,031
What else?
Where is Annie?

145
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,632
Rafique says you are
always stone drunk

146
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,076
He says that's why
she hardly comes home

147
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,045
You've been fiddling
with it for a while

148
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,581
Is it an extra marital...?

149
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,048
I already have issues
Be quiet, please!

150
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,313
She will be mad at me

151
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,451
Annie...!

152
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,159
I'll tell you when
the time comes

153
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,126
About what?

154
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,694
- Can't get along
-Whaaat?

155
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,261
- Not working out
-What?

156
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,472
- Not compatible
-Who?

157
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,073
Your stupid head!

158
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,442
Come with me
We'll talk

159
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,573
Get up
Let's talk

160
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,345
Let's have a drink

161
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,742
That gives you a pep, eh?

162
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,350
Look at that sudden
spun of energy

163
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,153
The way you came in I thought
you'll just sleep through the night

164
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,955
That was just
to fool that old man

165
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,497
Where is the ash-tray?

166
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,193
No need for ash tray.

167
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,698
Tell me, what's the problem?

168
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,606
- No problem at all
- Do you know?

169
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:42,439
I've watched you and Annie
so often green with envy

170
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,777
Behind the commerce block
under the gulmohar tree

171
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,583
Didn't you write a script...a story?
Wanting hero Mohanlal to act?

172
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,621
Didn't you write
impressive dialogs?

173
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,420
Annie and me
under the gulmohar tree...?

174
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,552
If Lal had done that role
he would be out of films now

175
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,134
Now there is neither
the gulmohar nor the rain

176
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,001
There never was anything
that connected us then

177
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,802
Even back then, we used
to be at loggerheads

178
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,777
Radhika was the one who
sorted out your squabbles

179
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:20,683
Mention her name and look
at the rapid blood circulation!

180
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,579
Rad hika

181
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,560
In Mumbai I have seen
all the top models you can find

182
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,455
But no one can
hold a candle to her

183
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,763
Did you know?

184
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,807
One day in 1997 just after
the summer holidays

185
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,712
I was getting off a bus
at our college bus stop

186
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,549
I just stepped out and a sudden
shower of rain from nowhere

187
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,183
As I look at the opposite road
I see her walk towards me

188
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:04,321
- Radhika
-And the way she looked

189
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,663
With rain drops
clinging to her hair

190
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,461
And streaming down her face

191
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,432
Clara

192
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,165
It trickled down as
I watched stunned

193
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,609
By stunned I mean
I was lost in that moment

194
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,340
I just stood staring
as she walked towards me

195
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,180
When I regained consciousness

196
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,221
After a long time,
I simply ran to that-

197
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,279
Remember that
old man's small eatery?

198
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,724
I ran, got an old umbrella
from him and went back

199
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,230
I drew her under the umbrella

200
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,424
Just she and I under the umbrella
with the rain lashing around us

201
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,804
In that rain, she and I
under the umbrella

202
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,168
Do you know
jasmine flowers?

203
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,740
She had jasmine
on her hair

204
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,851
Fragrance from that jasmine
The smell of rain

205
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,221
And fresh moist earth
Her special scent

206
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,924
It will be ecstatic

207
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,896
I'm reminded of a poem
by Ayyappa Panniker

208
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,898
Kurukkuthi mulla
[Jasmine flowers]

209
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,601
Youth belongs to me
whispered the flower

210
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,865
Jasmine close to the bosom
are buds clasped to blossom

211
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:28,401
Pronounced 'njha'
Jha, dha or whatever

212
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,707
My neighbor's surname
sounds like that

213
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,407
He committed suicide
Neck deep in loans

214
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,615
How you say it
is no big deal

215
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,221
Come on
Continue your Radhika story

216
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:43,488
And when I got off the bus-
What's your wife's name?

217
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,390
That was a nasty
mood killer, right?

218
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,936
What's the joke?

219
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,466
He was talking
about his fans

220
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,702
Aa-radhika
He meant fans!

221
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,943
Tea?

222
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,182
Shall we mix it in this?
No! It will curdle

223
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,410
I'll tell you later

224
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,520
Does she know?
Shall I tell her?

225
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,416
Come

226
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,431
Alavi'kka! Just get me
an ashtray and my phone

227
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,264
How long have you
been living here?

228
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,003
No, dude
I come once in a while

229
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,605
Listen
What's your issue with Annie?

230
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,806
Sit here
and tell me

231
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,614
No issue

232
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,614
Leave it there

233
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,986
She isn't adjusting
with your life style?

234
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,428
Is that the issue?

235
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,021
Or is it because you
don't have kids?

236
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,558
How can being
childless be a hassle?

237
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,264
Then what?

238
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,671
She deserves
a better life

239
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,334
That's it

240
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,450
Rafique
Ask him to come in

241
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,488
<i>Hey'. Bucket</i>

242
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,055
You fatso!

243
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,058
Return my 150 bucks

244
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,532
Mr Poet!

245
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,804
Here
Let's begin auspiciously

246
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,537
Hey no!
Meet Suhra

247
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,805
Suhra Rafique

248
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,638
Isn't he Rafique?
Then why the emphasis?

249
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,382
Meet my greatest wealth
Hannah

250
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,455
Hannah?

251
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,381
He is Rafique
She's Suhra

252
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,018
Hey! She's Suhra Rafique

253
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,452
I'm meeting Suhra
for the 1st time

254
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,863
That isn't surprising?!
Keeps me like a caged bird

255
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,665
Isn't Annie coming?

256
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,602
She will

257
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,672
Hey! Radhi...

258
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,947
All of you have
changed so much

259
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,881
Suhra come, we'll sit inside

260
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,077
I knowyou
You write songs, right?

261
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,580
Not songs
Poems

262
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,022
What's the difference! Do you
booze so you can write?

263
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,996
I write to earn booze

264
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,662
Drink within limits
Don't ruin your health

265
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,923
<i>tiff </i>

266
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,047
Is this how you talk
to someone you just met?

267
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,743
Drunkards deserve...
...only such words

268
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,780
- Is he married?
- Love marriage

269
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,513
Was she blind?!

270
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,720
Do you have any idea who he is??

271
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,020
He's not an ordinary
contractor like your father

272
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,958
He holds a top post in
an advertisement agency

273
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,495
Earns 150 million per annum

274
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,758
This unkempt fellow
who reeks of alcohol?!

275
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,858
Your acid tongue is the reason
I don't take you out anywhere

276
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,027
I know that only too well

277
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,935
You had no option this time, right?
Just to show your friends I exist

278
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,873
Only 2 p995

279
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,674
If you drink more
I'll tell my father

280
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,020
What the...!

281
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,026
Rafiquem!

282
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,898
What was all that for?!

283
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,703
Life is such a drag these days

284
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,772
Earlier Suhra used to wait up till
I came back from hospital at night

285
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,477
After some time
it was the maid

286
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,879
Nowadays she also is fast asleep

287
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,012
I eat whatever I can find
and hit the sack

288
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,113
Same story
Last 5 years

289
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,681
What about other 'activities'?

290
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,125
How long will you 'plough'
your own 'field'?!

291
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,725
It is fun to trespass
in someone else's field

292
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,927
Generally Malayali's start
losing their prowess by 40

293
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,164
This lag begins
when a man is 35 years

294
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,204
In my opinion the Kerala Govt
should bring a rule

295
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,077
After 5 years of marriage, a wife
must be declared as a man's sister

296
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,615
Then she should get
married to someone else

297
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,914
Why do you smoke
like a steam engine?

298
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,513
Rejuvenating, no?
Then pass it to me also

299
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,814
Sidhu
This is fantastic

300
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,451
I vote for this

301
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,220
Is it?

302
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,093
Just a minute

303
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,629
You've really changed a lot

304
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,109
Listen to him
speak English!

305
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,081
What is he up to?

306
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,281
Come

307
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:21,226
<i>tiff </i>

308
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,497
I can prescribe tablets
for blood pressure

309
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,228
I already gulp them
like a 3 course meal

310
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,672
Get me my drink

311
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,546
Move that away

312
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,813
It's unnerving
how stress piles up

313
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:58,028
College was such fun, flirting,
rowdyism, playing peeping Tom

314
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,899
What a blast it was!

315
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,599
She occupied all my thoughts
Radhika

316
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,573
Remember our library?

317
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,575
The pages of old books
had a peculiar smell

318
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,578
My mind is full of that

319
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,349
He used to bring beef
with Chinese potatoes

320
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,990
Wow! Delicious

321
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,622
I often went hungry in hostel

322
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,597
To eat the beef-potato he brought

323
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:34,030
After I became a doctor
people asked me why I was so fat

324
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,630
Guys, from the day I got married
I became a glutton with a capital G

325
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,040
I compensated for all
those days of starvation

326
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,272
But I'd always wanted...

327
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,309
...a contented family life
I often dreamed of it

328
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:55,016
But when I never
got the girl I loved

329
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,854
I just gave uP

330
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,053
You loved a girl?
Who is that now?

331
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,060
Who was it?

332
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,388
If you had just told us
we would have got her for you

333
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,259
Sure

334
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,261
That was just a comedy

335
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,199
Love? Love is a joke?
Love is not a comedy

336
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,234
It's an emotion that stealthily
creeps into your nerves

337
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,142
Shut up!

338
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,244
What?

339
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,809
Cynical about love

340
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,113
What about you and Annie?

341
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,984
You just said something
about smell, pages, library

342
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,318
You guys simply sizzled

343
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,725
Blunders born
out of immaturity

344
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,720
It's because you don't realize
the value of what you've got

345
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,294
When I lost the one I loved
I just sold my soul

346
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,669
lam now a slave
to Suhara's father

347
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,674
If he asked me to go
on my bended knees...

348
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,209
...I'll happily crawl to him

349
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,006
You think I am being funny?

350
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,418
He's absolutely nasty

351
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,750
He takes off to Bangalore
every now and then

352
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,450
But before that a session
of massages at Kotakkal

353
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,687
That pig ought to be shot!

354
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:09,927
Old man! His worn out pans
may need a little massage

355
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,933
My fate is sealed
I'll be back

356
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,006
You want to shoot
my father, right?

357
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,205
When your house
was confiscated legally...

358
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,373
...you wanted my father
as well as his money

359
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,819
Shall I call him now?

360
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,056
Drunk and deriding my father
I will call him now

361
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,825
That woman will break
this house into two

362
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,486
Mind your own
business, will you?

363
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,289
Now that you are stable
you want to shoot my dad

364
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,265
Don't you have any shame?

365
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,825
He is getting abused

366
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,337
I'll stop with this now
Your friends may overhear

367
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,238
I told you not to drink
more than 2 pegs

368
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,300
Getting drunk and
finding fault with my dad

369
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,073
When we get back
you'll get it from me!

370
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:02,202
<i>Tiff </i>

371
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,524
Son, be careful
and don't lose it

372
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,855
It's an expensive gadget

373
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,523
Don't worry, sonny
Your dad has plenty of money

374
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:23,373
What's up?
What is this, dude?

375
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,103
Why don't you try
something you are good at?

376
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,478
Uncle, are there any
fishes in this river?

377
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,981
Of course

378
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,917
- Crocodiles too?
- One is sitting inside the house

379
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,448
Did you bring it here?
The crocodile brought me here

380
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,491
You just wait
I'll tell all this verbatim to my dad

381
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,031
Alavi'kka, need any help?
I'll call if I want help

382
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,938
Women should be
more docile and gentle

383
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,031
Just mind your own business

384
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,505
I employ only women
in my kitchen

385
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,016
My father won't allow men

386
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,953
This house generally is left locked

387
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,356
Sidhu comes once in a while
and stays here alone

388
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,792
I've come here
Maybe just once

389
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,592
Not a good decision

390
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,495
Sell this house and deposit
the money in the bank

391
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,331
That is more profitable

392
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,269
Sohra, you are
so business minded

393
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,274
I belong to Maliakkal family
My family is full of traders

394
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,332
My father deals in real estate

395
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,572
The biggest building
in Kozhikode belongs to him

396
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,580
Haven't you heard
of Shalimar buildings?

397
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,616
Yes...Shalimar

398
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,079
I have, yes

399
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,849
- Alavi'kka?
- Coming

400
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,952
Yes, Narayan'etta
I am here

401
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,058
Will you come?
Yes, sure I'm here Yes, sure I'm here

402
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,529
Dude, remember
our Narayan'etta?

403
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,265
Narayan who made those
yummy 'unniappams'?

404
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,271
He'll be here in half an hour

405
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,139
Narayan rescued him once

406
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,178
Rescued him?
What is that story?

407
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,942
Don't you know?
Farewell day

408
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,350
After college hours he and Chacko
went to the ladies' hostel

409
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:21,151
- To meet Radhika?
- To meet Radhika

410
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,152
Fix one for me, dude

411
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,991
Alavi'kka, you can go in now

412
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,555
Chicken is roasting now, bro

413
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,227
Enough
That will do

414
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,637
Okay! go

415
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,197
- Listen to this
- insensitive idiot!

416
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,699
We were fully sloshed
when we jumped over the wall

417
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,476
We sawa guy sliding down
from the 2nd floor window

418
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,574
None other than 'hunter' Xavier
Father Xavier?

419
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,486
Father Xavier

420
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:56,649
Sidhu just pushed us away and
went towards Radhika's room

421
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,953
Remember that lotus pond?

422
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,226
He sat there and looking up
at Radhika's room and sang

423
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,561
What was that song, dude?

424
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,231
"Sumangali, do you rememb-"

425
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,526
Yes, that's the song

426
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,475
Before he could finish his song
that guy looking like Seen Connery

427
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,944
- Sean Connery
- That Connery guy came and caught us

428
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:22,952
Finally Chacko got him a full bottle
of rum and squared it up

429
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,577
What a pity!
Why didn't I hear of this?

430
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,485
If we told you,
then Annie will also know

431
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,150
And then Radhika will also know
So we hushed it up

432
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,318
You were not destined, dude
Some other lucky guy got her

433
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,600
A lover boy whose love
remained untold

434
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,437
Will Narayanan bring
the 'unni appams'?

435
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,969
He will

436
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,268
That reminds me

437
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,004
You wrote a poem on these
steamed fritters, remember?

438
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,968
Want to see?

439
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,576
Bring it
Let's see

440
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,386
I'll be right back

441
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,658
I have been watching you
ever since we came here

442
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,627
The very name 'Radhika'
makes your adrenalin rush

443
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,760
Everyone who walks
into your life will leave

444
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,500
I'll be the only one
to stick on with you

445
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,710
- Who else is coming?
- Our Annie

446
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,110
- Move aside Manu, my dear
- Manu, come here

447
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:29,435

448
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:46,064
- There comes your 'unni appam'
- Show it to me

00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,998
Let me see if it tastes
as good as it once did

450
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:51,698
Leave it

451
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,144
Did you think I saved this
for your blessed fritters poem?

452
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:55,768
Then why?

453
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,780
Really want to know?

00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:05,745
Rad hika

455
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,717
Did she write stories too?
I never knew

456
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,558
You had eyes only for Annie

457
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,262
Both of them will write stuff
no one could ever decipher

458
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,097
By evening they
will begin to fight

459
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,399
Who will fritter away time
writing poems on fritters?!

460
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,038
Don't make it
a big issue

461
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,408
Read this
Read it

<i>MBRHDRG</i>

463
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,302
Instead of introducing me
as his neighbor casually

464
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,738
Couldn't he have said
I was his best friend?

465
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:04,509
I was slig hted
A guest insulted

466
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,641
I no longer
wanted to linger there

467
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,250
I was in a hurry
I turned and walked away

468
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,647
While my heart murmured

469
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,190
I should've never come

470
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,427
Never come
when not welcome

471
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,692
Words on paper hurt
like needles in my heart

472
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,195
It was that hurt
which took me closer to her

473
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,107
Whenever I come here
I sit and read that story

474
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,273
Just for the wonderful world
she creates with her words

475
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,877
To be immersed in it
is sheer bliss!

476
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,552
Some rascal run
Creative Associates

477
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,318
Should make them read this
to know how refined Malayalam is

478
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,659
Does Annie know you resigned?

479
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,269
Why should she when
we are about to separate?

480
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:10,368
What did you say?
I want to live in total freedom

481
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,505
Hence this separation

482
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,372
But if you talk it over
won't she understand?

483
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,445
Why do you want to-
What's left to talk?

484
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:23,214
She should have married a good
Christian, a rubber estate owner

485
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,318
Why should she ruin
her life being with me?

486
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,659
All this is because
of your dirty behavior

487
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,927
- How is she responsible?
- So what is your problem?

488
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,299
What's my problem?

489
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,304
Do you know Xavier and I
got beaten up for your sake?

490
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,600
You can take the blows

491
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,403
But I won't let you
pan ways with her

492
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:45,431
- Who wants your permission?
- Do you know?

493
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,447
She's a simple soul
I liked her very much

494
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,543
I even wrote her a letter
without him knowing

495
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,780
This vagabond charmed her
and took her away from me

496
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,720
Now he wants to-

497
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,255
You son of a-

498
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,300
You want to
ditch her, right?

499
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,412
- Annie?
-What is all this, Sidhu?

500
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,423
He is just showing off
like old times after drinks

501
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,686
Showing his affection
like old times

502
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,955
Is this how
you show affection?

503
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,360
Stinks like hell

504
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,489
- How many rounds over?
- We've just begun

505
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,862

- That was just...nothing

-Yes

- Meet Suhra

and got married

Whatever, love or otherwise
Don't bug us now

Go in and relax

513
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,784
Go in

00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,332
Did you know, Sidhu?

515
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,665
It's been a year since he and I spoke

516
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,770
He doesn't even have a phone
Do you know what he's doing?

517
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,434
It's true
We'll set it rig ht

518
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,411

It will all be fine

00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,992
Also I am giving him
a free rein only for today

530
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,828
But from tomorrow his booze
and cigarettes will be rationed

531
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:18,866
Very good

532
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,561
Otherwise his insides
will rot to pieces

533
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,139
Hey! Does this get together
mean only booze and gossip?

534
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,368
Sidhu, sing a song

535
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,509
Add some life into this party
No other work!

536
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,648
Song?

537
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:38,852
Sidhu will sing?

538
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:45,589
He was the star singer
of our college

539
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:47,952
Go ahead
Sing, dude

540
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,932
His golden voice

541
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:59,772
An entire campus used to get
intoxicated hearing his voice

542
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,142
Look at him fiddling
with that key pad?

543
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,652
His fingers flew 10 times
faster over his guitar

544
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,179
You've been married so long
Don't you know this?

545
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,391
Haven't you told her?

546
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,991
My head is full of debit,
credit and consignments

547
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,393
Sing in this chaos, huh?

548

We have no better work now

Tonight we are students
back to our campus days

Retarded fellows
with varied stubbles

552
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,810
Sing
Sing, dude

553
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,777
Sing, man

Did you lose interest in music
only after you married me?

I am no Yesudas to
choose it as my career

they asked me

That's all

00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,968
I really don't know if Radhika
was in your thoughts

But you sang beautifully

None of them ever knew
thatl once liked Radhika

These guys, Rag hu,
Rafique liked her too

596
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,886
I liked her a little bit more

597
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,088
That's all it was

598
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,852
Look, we are meeting
after 14 years

599
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,294
The gap is 14 long years

600
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,890
Spare me for this one day

601
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,263
Is that too much to ask?

602
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,967
I am really stressed out
Okay?

603
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,201
Ease up

604
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,041
If my husband had said this
I wouldn't have taken it so lightly

605
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,416
If you're lenient with your men
they will dance on your head

606
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,076
My dear Suhra

607
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,079
Don't comment
and make it worse

608
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,756
Sidhu was the 5th guy
who 'saw' me as a bride

609
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,059
Some of the men before him
had liked me and so did I

610
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,828
But it was Sidhu
I finally married

611
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,393
One day my father told me
a groom was coming to 'see' me

612
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,133
It was only then I realized
I was 'ready' to get married

613
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,210
Father told me a lot about
the prospective bridegroom

614
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,111
That he was a good man,
very rich with a big house

615
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:17,885
I went through the ritual of meeting
the boy, talked to him, serving tea

616
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,421
After they left
I started dreaming

617
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:26,155
About my honeymoon,
my house, the kids I would have

618
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,787
Actually don't we all go
through this dream-phase?

619
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,799
But next day the marriage mediator
said the groom's family had rejected me

620
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:32,321
Why?

621
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,498
Because the groom's aunt didn't find
a western closet in the bathroom

622
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,003
So?

623
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,007
I swear I was dumped

624
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,170
Many more proposals
petered out for vague reasons

625
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,969
Rafique's proposal was
the last one in the list

626
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,544
I shouldn't have agreed to
a man with a 24x7job

627
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:55,078
If he had been a farmer,
I would at least see him daily

628
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,126
Nowadays I must also fix
an appointment to see him

629
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,526
I have always wondered

630
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,997
Why don't they have
anything to discuss with us?

631
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,091
When they meet friends
they talk nineteen to a dozen

632
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,797
At home, they clutch the TV remote
and sit sulking, staring at the screen

633
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,067
We are all almost
sailing in the same boat

634
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,837
And those who look
a picture of contentment...

635
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,377
...lead the most pathetic lives

636
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:20,939
Wonder why we marry 1 particular guy
among 100 others in the world

637
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:27,445
Marriage in our society is based on
matching financial and social status

638
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,014
No one bothers whether
our thoughts or feelings match

639
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,193
We bear their kids
and live with the belief..

640
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,594
...we are the sole love of their life

641
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,222
We are left with
nothing else to do

642
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,234
No man can be trusted
when he goes past 35

643
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,429
They all go in search
of other nests to roost

644
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:46,030
There used to be a nurse and
a Dr Nadiya at Rafique's hospital

645
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:50,238
God! I was most worried
till that doctor got married

646
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,311
I got my father to dismiss
that nurse from there

647
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,852
What are you saying, Suhra?
It is like that

648
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,479
Can't trust them at all

649
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,121

She's in America, right?

652
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,660
Must have got married
at least a couple of times, no?

653
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,388
- I don't know
- Is she pretty?

654
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,560
I have seen her
in their college albums

655
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,194
Frankly she is really beautiful

656
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,671
She was the dream girl
of our college

657
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,438
Was she?

658
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:26,613
What was it between
Sid hu and Rad hika?

659
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,011
My dear Revathi
Just an infatuation

660
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:36,151
if he meets her now, he'll realize,
he's gotten over all that

661
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,693
She would have become
a fatso by now in USA

662
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,194
Did my hubby have a crush
on someone in college?

Oh! No

in gold like this, Suhra?

665
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:53,074
If I were you, I'd have sold
the lot and gone for a world tour

666
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,368
Allah! Sell gold
to go on a tour?!

667
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,714
If all the gold of women
in Kerala are sold...

668
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,247
3 generations can easily
eat and live without working

669

00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,406
Benny!

702
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:52,711
You son of a mongrel! Sidhu!
Come quickly Look...Benny is here

703
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,545
Benny?

704
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,191
Get up

705
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,459
Benny?
Why this scruffy look?

706
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:11,297
Rafique?!
Benny is here Benny Chacko

707
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,641
Benny!
Dude, watch out Pool

708
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,537
Fully fuddled!

709
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,606
Did you have to dig a pond
in the middle of your garden?

710
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,247
Idiot! That's not a pond
It's a pool

711
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,914
Get up

712
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:33,111
<i>tiff </i>

713
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,608
Howdid you guys recognize me?

714
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:00,583
When I look at the mirror,
even I don't recognize myself

715
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,852
How did you know it was me?

716
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,190
Do you know how hard
I tried tracing you?

717
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,489
Where were you?

718
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,693
Tried to trace me?

719
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,290
You never even bothered
to come for my wedding

720
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,698
You got married?

721
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,870
Was it after marriage
your life turned haywire?

722
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,334
I got married too

723
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,310
And that too to a TV actress

724
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,507
Remember the TV serial
'She was a goddess'

725
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,850
I married that goddess
Sophia Menon

726
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:33,683
And...?

727
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,785
And...l don't intend to narrate
my sob story for you to savor

728
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,658
If she had asked
I would have told

729
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,699
Radhika! She was the only one
who came for my wedding

730
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,860
Radhika came for your wedding?
Sure, she did

731
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,665
All the way from Paris

732
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,570
She waited for a long time
thinking you guys would come too

733
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,912
Dude, it was the day
Revathi's uncle died

734
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,639
So I couldn't come

735
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,972
What a day
he picked to conk off

736
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:02,812
00!

737
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,512
I tried calling him
But never got through

738
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,855
My house was legally
confiscated then

739
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,948
How can I come in
when I was so 'happy'?!

740
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,985
So Benny, what do you do now?

741
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,394
I drive an auto rickshaw

742
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,591
- Auto rickshaw?
- Yes

743
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,535
Do you guys often
get together like this?

744
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,505
This is the 1st time, dude
Although Sidhu and I often 'chat'

745
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,897
Xavier is not in
whatsApp or FB

746
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,742
He needs permission
from the Vatican for that

747
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,245
That's good

748
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:39,312
Or a single post will be enough
for all sins to pile up on him

749
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:43,756
Who?!
You mean our 'hunter' Xavier?

750
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,794
Is he a priest? My God!

751
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,591
Vicar of an entire Parish

752
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,697
Our Old Vicar

753
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,600
All he needed to do was look
at a girl and she will conceive!

754
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:58,470
I was the one who helped
his maid abort her baby!

755
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,733
Be quiet

756
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,746
Remember Mary Varghese?

757
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,371
You mean our 'disaster lady'?

758
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,476
Her love and passion
drove him to distraction

759
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,919
She then eloped
with someone else

760
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,685
Unable to bear his sorrow
he chose the path of the Lord

761
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,817
'Dukhkham'
You pronounce it as 'Kha'

762
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:22,859
Are you a Malayalam teacher?
I'll kick you!

763
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,556
You're at it from
the time I came

764
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,658
- Didn't you get me?
-I didn't

765
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:27,565
You...!

766
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,770
This is like being
bitten by a viper

767
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,469
Expensive stuff usually is

768
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,637
Let's go

769
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,615
Let's move from vices
to virtues and eat

770
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,344
You mean what they feed horses?

771
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,545
Horses or even donkeys
Come

772
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,551
You've all changed so much
You're almost bald now

773
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,019
Who is this new entrant?

774
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,826
Suhra, he's Benny,
our classmate

775
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,331
We were together

776
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,393
He is not at all
what he looks like now

777
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:06,437
He is a 1st rank holder
Science graduate Benny Chacko

778
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,806
Science graduate?
What do you do?

779
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,469
I drive an auto

780
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,675
Science graduate
driving an auto?

781
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,944
Why not?
Won't the auto run?

782
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:19,878
My wife, dude

783
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,556
- Sit here
- No, I'll sit here

784
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,785
This is more comfortable
Where do you live, Benny?

785
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,688
Here, quite nearby

786
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,867
Allah! This is the first time
I'm seeing a woman drink

787
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,163
if my father ever sees-

788
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,563
Dam n the 'father' word!

789
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:40,437
Do you know for how long
I've put up with this 'father'?

790
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,009
Just stop it,
will you, Suhra?!

791
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,374
Come back home
I'll deal with you then

792
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,674
You are to blame for all this

793
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,619
You and your blasted poems
that made me lose her forever

794
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,452
Otherwise I would have married her

795
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,455
Go ahead and take her now

796
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,860
Don't tempt me now, okay?
Behave yourself

797
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,400
High time you stopped
What the heck?!

798
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,000
My dear Rafique I did not
fall in love with his poems

799
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,665
If that was the case, I'd have
fallen for poet Chullikkad

800
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,938
I fell in love with
Raghu the person

801
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,710
I was just...making fun

802
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,677
Just a minute

803
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,183
One minute
I'll be back

804
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,602
Hey Sidhu...go

805
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:52,931
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

806
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,855
It's been so long since
we were together like this?

807
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,796
Annie?

808
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,668
I want to...tell you something

809
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,854
That must be Xavier

810
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,156
Rafique?
I think Xavier is here

811
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:44,992
Hey hunter!

812
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,650
Rad hika

813
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,025
What's up?

814
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:17,682
<i>Tiff </i>

815
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,106
Where is Sidhu?

816
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:39,497
<i>Tiff </i>

817
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,255
First time I'm seeing
such implicit obedience

818
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,921
No, thanks

819
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,329
I'll happily
have your share

820
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,438
Do I look like someone
who does not drink?

821
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,675
What is it?

822
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:59,317
To the...
...red angel

823
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:22,475
Even if we were out of touch
I get to know all the latest news

824
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,041
Our Xavier must be her informer

825
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,444
How was your journey?

826
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,788
Don't flirt

827
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,257
So boring

828
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,817
Talcum powder on your neck

829
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,420
Hey Mr Poet! Why are you
looking like a gypsy?

830
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,488
- What's up?
-Yes, I am

831
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,963
Annie looks just the same

832
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,062
Because she never had babies

833
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,134
You must share a bed
to have babies!

834
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,142
These 2 live in
different cities

835
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,905
It's better mad chaps
like me don't father kids

836
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,880
- Can be free
-Very true

837
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,353
Where is Xavier?
Let me call him

838
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,925
- Beautiful saree, no?
- Not so good

839
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,087
I haven't heard you
compliment my red saree!

840
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,130
This isn't the same red, Suhra

841
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,425
Not able to reach him

842
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,558
He must be after some woman

843
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,773
Dark women is his weakness

844
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,809
Surya, Ranjini, Bhanupriya

845
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,144
Why not?
Shouldn't dark people fall in love?

846
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,442
Of course they can
But not priests of a church

847
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,180
Frankly I envy him a lot

848
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,545
No worries or tensions

849
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:37,216
Listen to women confessing their sins
and float in a Heaven of his own

850
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:46,163
What news of Malayalees
in the land of Obama?

851
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,196
Less said the better

852
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,036
They are trying to build
another Kerala in the U.S

853
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,969
They watch live telecasts
of all major festivals of Kerala

854
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:03,006
Their kids learn Bharathanatyam
and even perform at the opera house

855
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,612
Onam is celebrated by every one
That's true

856
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,380
It's the Malayalees living outside
Kerala who celebrate Onam grandly

857
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,357
I was in Bombay
for some time

858
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,158
Onam that's celebrated in August is
extended till New year in mid April

859
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,398
Show me a Malayali who
doesn't grab a chance to drink?

860
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,834
On Buddha's Enlightenment day too
they will open a bottle or two

861
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,231
Rad hika?

862
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,536
Don't you practice
Bharatanatyam these days

863
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:38,313
Nowl practice tango, salsa
I even teach fitness oriented zumba

864
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,049
I have some students

865
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:47,989
Remember once in a students' fest
What was the name?

866
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,998
Talent Time
Remember you performed a dance?

867
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:54,862
Which one?

868
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:59,669
I know nothing about dance
But that day you were too-

869
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,337
I was so impressed

870
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,901
You performed
a flame formation

871
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,539
It was mind blowing

872
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,975
Thank you

873
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:18,353
She's gone
Your wife just left

874
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,555
No wife will tolerate her husband
going gaga over another woman

875
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,479
What will they think
if you stay away like this?

876
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,081
Are you sick?

877
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,990
Head ache?
Feeling feverish?

878
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:58,089
Mom, give me this charger
Give it to me now

879
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:03,399
Will you go away? Go, Manu
Don't pester me

880
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,460
Go

882
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,580
This guy is such a pest!

883
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,400
You'll fall sick
if you get wet like this

884
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,764
Get out of that water now

885
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,594
Suhra, let him
enjoy for one day

886
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,264
He'll make a habit of this

887
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,138
Want to tie me
to your apron strings?

888
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,268
Just be quiet, Suhra

889
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:54,650
Do you also
want to join us?

890
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,686
Give it to me

891
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,793
This is absolutely volatile

892
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,462
Then why don't you
set it ablaze?!

893
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,096
- I too want it
- Give it to me

894
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,105
This is not for you

895
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,303
I'll deal with this one!

896
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:22,012
Please come out of there
You'll die of suffocation

897
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,414
lam just playing, Suhra

898
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,009
Playing?
My foot!

899
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,090
I tried this once
and blacked out

900
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,457
Today we'll also black out

901
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,825
What a beautiful
shade of green

902
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,107
Now blow

903
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:56,445
Allah! Fire gorging drunkards!

904
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,349
I've been guzzling fire
from the day I married you

905
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,528
Come on, man

906
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:13,529
That which burns must be
sipped in waist deep water

907
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:14,623
No, thanks

908
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,839
Com e, sit here

909
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,550
Annie, both of you jump in

They tried
Lo ng ag o

Aren't you a doctor? You want
people to gossip? Come out now

912
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,492
What gossip?

913
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,828
Which 'people'
are here to gossip?

914
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:53,491
<i>Tiff </i>

915
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,614
This is our wedding album

916
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,282
How is this saree?

917
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,487
This is my family
My dad is a school teacher

918
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:18,896
Mom, housewife

919
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,365
Your wedding album?

920
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,335
Walk down memory lane
and see how we looked then

921
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,275
You sit there

922
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,222
This is what happens
if you drink too much

923
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,490
Beautiful album
He puked all over it

924
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,896
He threw up, that's all
One can't control that

925
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,230
Couldn't he have held back?

926
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,697
Com e, sit here

927
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,500
Love and vomit are alike

928
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:03,738
An overdose will
make you gag, right?

929
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,710
Sit there

930
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:12,684
My friend, do you realize
the worth in dollars...

931
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,982
...you threw up and wasted?

932
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,854
I'm so sorry

933
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:33,637
Hey!

934
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:35,937
- Look who's here
- Sidhu!

935
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,471
Who's this?
Narayan'etta?

Let this boost up your party

944
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,427
Take it

945
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:07,302
Delicious!

946
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,841
Remembering old bonds

947
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,712
A gift from old students
to the 'unniappam' expert

948
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,038
I don't want it

949
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,415
- I can't handle it
- Drink, Narayanan bro

950
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:18,411
Small one

951
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:19,282
No

952
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,786
Doesn't matter

953
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:24,290
Small drink
Sit down

954
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,718
Tastes just like old times, Narayan'etta

955
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,253
Forgotten college days?

956
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,389
Have this

957
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,964
Where is your better half?
What?

958
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,699
Where is the lady
of the house?

959
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,069
Revathi

960
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,068
Go and call her

961
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:47,006
Your fritters are
famous even in America

962
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,710
Do children these days
like to eat 'unniappam'?

963
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,552
My daughter is
a nurse in Australia

964
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:57,048
She feels it beneath her dignity
to see me do this job

965
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,285
So I stay at home

966
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:00,818
What a pity!

967
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,758
Remember the poem
you wrote about my 'unniappam'?

968
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,493
I had framed it and
hung on a wall at home

969
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,536
She removed it

970
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:12,998
What a weird world!

971
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,306
Narayan'etta, can you
tell me the recipe?

972
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,541
I'll go back and
become a star in America

973
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,381
I will tell only you, my dear

974
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,754
- Shall I?
- Of course

975
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,921
Rice powder

976
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:33,047
That too raw rice
Must not be fried

977
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,961
But powdered finely

978
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:41,089
Then you must meltjaggery
and bring it to a boil

979
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,133
After it bubbles and boils
it has to be sieved

980
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,499
It will become like honey

981
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:51,511
You have to mix powdered rice
and this jaggery into a fine batter

982
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:56,846
Then you must use a mature
coconut cut into tiny bits

983
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:01,479
Add some finely chopped
cashew and fry it in ghee

984
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,418
It will get fried and come nicely

985
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,620
Fry it to a golden hue
with a heavenly flavor

986
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,357
To this add sesame seeds
and mix the batter well

987
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,393
Then it must marinate for 4 hours

988
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,490
It takes 4 hours

989
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,370
Only then the 'marriage' of
all the ingredients will stabilize

990
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,964
Deep fry in the 'appam' pan

991
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,030
'Unniappam' ready

992
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,411
But this is the ordinary recipe

993
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,076
I will tell you the secret
of my special recipe

994
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:34,653
I add a few teaspoons of
raisin juice to the boiling jaggery

995
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,621
That lends a flavor
to the taste buds

996
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,692
And eases the tummy

997
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,152
Thank you, Narayan'etta

998
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,023
Cooking is an an by itself

999
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,090
You should not have
given it up for your daughter

1000
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,938
Hey! Look who's this?!

1001
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,411
- Here!
- Smart girl

1002
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,404
Annie, I saw your
photo in a magazine

1003
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,607
Now let me leave
It's quite late

1004
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:10,980
I came all the way here only
to see you enjoy my 'unniappams'

1005
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,954
I feel so happy
Now let me take leave

1006
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,460
Have a couple of drinks

1007
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,120
Not only that
Have dinner with us

1008
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:19,064
My daughter will call
Checking up on me

1009
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,794
Sol had better leave

1010
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:22,633
Do you have to go?

1011
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,227
I must
Why displease anyone?

1012
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,803
I will go eat at home

1013
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,065
1 minute

1014
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,845
- Put it back, Sidhu
- Brother, this is-

1015
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,073
Put it right back

1016
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,777
I worked for a salary and
served food to many children

1017
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,016
I always felt you were children
who belonged under one roof

1018
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,748
I was not wrong!
You are all still together

1019
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,954
No one realizes the value
of bonds like you do

1020
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,461
I am very happy today

1021
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,002
As if I was back in college

1022
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,895
Let me leave?

1023
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:01,037
Poor man!

1024
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,810
He came and left so quickly

1025
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:21,784
Where are you?
I've been waiting for you

1026
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,160
- I will be a little late
-I thought you'll come early

1027
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,495
You go to bed
I'll call you later

1028
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,570
Hey! Our Father Xavier

1029
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,165
Ask him to bring some wine

1030
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,834
- I will
- Put it on speaker

1031
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,540
Speak on

1032
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,738
Praise be to the Lord

1033
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,644
Leave that alone
Where are you now?

1034
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,239
Sorry, friends
lam going back

1035
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,307
Attend a Holy mass whichl can't avoid

1036
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,521
If you don't come, we will
perform your final mass

1037
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,715
Radhika came all the way
from America to see you

1038
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,189
Are you a cross
on the church wall?

1039
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,782
I have to attend it

1040
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,287
The Lord won't forgive me

1041
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,090
Neither will we, you-

1042
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,721
I will pray that
only good befalls you

1043
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,329
I'll have you in my prayers

1044
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:01,600
He hung up on us

1045
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:04,934
What does he do?
Murder God with his jokes?

1046
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,267
Will he come?

1047
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:10,141
Let him be content
with his Holy mass

1048
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:11,970
Let us celebrate

1049
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,042
As long as you don't
make a mess of it

1050
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:20,571
<i>tiff </i>

1051
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,300
So...?
Happy?

1052
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,773
You mean my married life?

1053
01:16:55,010 --> 01:17:00,255
Happy married life

1054
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,328
All those are dreams

1055
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,256
They never materialize into reality

1056
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,926
if they do then they
cease to be dreams

1057
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,738
That is absolute truth
Shake hands on that

1058
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:17,800
Years ago I met her on
the road from the airport

1059
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:18,776
Sophia

1060
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:19,335
And?

1061
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:23,306
Her car had broken down
and she signaled my auto

1062
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,942
I kept asking her questions
all the way from the airport

1063
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,180
But she never replied
to a single question

1064
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:32,086
When I dropped her at her place
she gave me a 1000 rupee note

1065
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,820
I refused and
she threw it at my face

1066
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,254
I said I did not have
enough change

1067
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,093
She said keep the change

1068
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,068
I went back thrice to
return the change to her

1069
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,033
She is in Canada now

1070
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,773
What was the need to go
after a wife who left you?

1071
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,345
Suhra, it wasn't you
who went to her, right?

1072
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,113
Why did you go?

1073
01:17:56,772 --> 01:18:00,914
Don't ask me why
I have no answer

1074
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,389
This is the problem
with Malayali boys

1075
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,114
They never come out
in the open with their love

1076
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,361
Sometimes I wonder why...

1077
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,891
...not one of you
fell in love with me

1078
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,992
We thought why lose
the friendship we shared

1079
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:16,967
Right, dude?

1080
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,794
Why were you so afraid?

1081
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,736
Afraid of you?

1082
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:25,310
If I had declared my love
would you have accepted?

1083
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,472
I can't even tolerate you

1084
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,910
I bow to Annie

1085
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,414
lfSidhu had... maybe life
would have been different

1086
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,045
Thank God
I escaped

1087
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,963
Hey! I was kidding

1088
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,436
Shall I serve dinner?

1089
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,702
Yes
Let's have dinner

1090
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,846
Manu, go wash your hand

1091
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,248
Let's eat

1092
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,213
Come, Sidhu

1093
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,155
Dude, ask her to come

1094
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,925
Sit down, dude
Where are you going?

1095
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,432
Bring those left over fritters

1096
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:25,956
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1097
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,485
Alavi'kka, see if
you can find that bottle

1098
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:51,129
- Rafique?
-Are you in Facebook?

1099
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,027
Yes

1100
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:57,230
You have time for Facebook
But you can't talk to Suhra, right?

1101
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:02,169
I've told you 100 times
not to log into that site

1102
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,572
Why don't just you eat, Suhra?

1103
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,049
Call everyone for dinner

1104
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,383
You can do that yourself

1105
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,067
How can you
mix up everything?

1106
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,061
You don't talk
Think you are a saint?!

1107
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,567
Many a mickle makes a muckle

1108
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,164
That's what it is

1109
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,039
I want to pee

1110
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,204
The loo is over there

1111
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:46,184
I want to look
at the stars and pee

1112
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,287
He's totally tipsy

1113
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,557
Is it a crime even to pee?

1114
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,443
- What is this, Raghu?
- Hey! What is it?

1115
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:16,141
Nothing, he just wants
to pee gazing at the stars

1116
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,647
Haven't you seen people pee?

1117
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,353
Come here if you haven't

1118
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,421
He wants to divorce Annie

1119
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:26,548
What?

1120
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,961
Poor thing!
She doesn't know as yet

1121
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:36,286
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1122
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:59,317
Master chef Alavi'kka

1123
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,290
Very true

1124
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,987
Though he looks
rough and tough

1125
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:04,496
He's #1 in cooking

1126
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,265
Fish curry is yummy
Where's he?

1127
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,962
- Yummy fish curry
- Thank you

1128
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,532
After the lunch
at Benny's wedding...

1129
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,604
...I'm enjoying authentic
Kerala cuisine only today

1130
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:24,342
Why did you and Sophie split?

1131
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,644
I'll tell only if Radhika asks me

1132
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,480
Okay, then take it I asked

1133
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,388
Okay, I'll tell you
because Radhika asked

1134
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,950
Also Malayalees love to hear
someone else's sob story

1135
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,954
I was sitting in a restaurant
and enjoying a 'masala dosa'

1136
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,227
I happened to see a TV show

1137
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,394
Sophia was yelling at
her mother-in-law in it

1138
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,496
I tracked her down
and proposed to her

1139
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,507
I was a 1st rank holder
with a lucrative job

1140
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,133
Car, bungalow, the whole works

1141
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,235
- No hitches whatsoever
-And?

1142
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,507
We had a grand wedding

1143
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:58,550
But on our wedding night,
just for fun and my misfortune...

1144
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,142
...I asked her a question

1145
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,484
Whether I was
the 1st man in her life

1146
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:06,648
What did she say?

1147
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,722
She said only if the light
was switched on...

1148
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,195
...she will know for sure

1149
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,461
Smart girl!

1150
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,663
But wondering if she was
kidding or being serious...

1151
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,296
...I broke into cold sweat

1152
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,735
From that day
I became suspicious

1153
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,300
I started watching her secretly

1154
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:29,203
This led to anger, hatred,
fights, arguments

1155
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,777
And not silly fights
Violent quarrels

1156
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,989
One day she said something
and I kicked her on her butt

1157
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,055
Great!

1158
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,619
Then things moved
in lightning speed

1159
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:43,218
She was admitted in hospital

1160
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:45,525
And a complaint filed through
the women's commission

1161
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,327
The case drained me
of all my assets

1162
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,460
My house and car were in her name

1163
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,264
She just walked off with both

1164
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,806
I got fed up with life
I started drinking

1165
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,474
And became a total wreck

1166
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,204
- Now I drive that auto
- Hey you!

1167
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,074
While our child and I
are starving at home...

1168
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:03,344
...you are busy buttering up
these gentlemen and hogging

1169
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:06,682
When I called Prasad
I realized you were here

1170
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,345
How much did you earn today?

1171
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,323
Nothing, Renu

1172
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,655
It probably went
down the drain in some bar

1173
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,252
Don't think we will
starve to death

1174
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,388
Hereafter I will drive the auto

1175
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:26,433
Just 40 bucks after
a whole day's work, eh?

1176
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,838
Did you send the rest of
the money to your ex-wife?

1177
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,066
Come home
I'll deal with you there

1178
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,042
I won't-

1179
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,172
- Who was that?
- That is my kid

1180
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,382
Renu, she's the mother

1181
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,752
When I became a drunkard...

1182
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,458
...my brother drove me
out of my own home

1183
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,558
Aimless and loitering
I landed up in her house

1184
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:59,298
She helped me
buy the auto

1185
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:03,871
She's a simple soul, dude
Hunger drives her to this state

1186
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,806
Hey! Call her back
Ask her to eat here

1187
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:10,212
Call her back

1188
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:16,112
She's a simple woman
I'll bring her back

1189
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,258
Lost the mood to eat

1190
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,460
Benny?

1191
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,361
- What...?
- Take this

1192
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:32,268
Hey! No need
This is not for you

1193
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:33,772
- For Renu
- Don't do this

1194
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:36,468
If Renu refuses it
I'll take it back

1195
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:39,808
No, no need
Keep it

1196
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,505
No need, let it be

1197
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,344
Listen to me
Take it

1198

1199
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,600
He's lucky
being an auto driver

1200
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,230
At least he enjoys freedom

1201
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,542
He is free to drive
or decide not to drive

1202
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:13,545
It's not money but freedom
that is most important in life

1203
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:15,909
I have to move

1204
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,538
What you say is right

1205
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,951
The minute you get money
you lose your peace of mind

1206
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,348
And marriage
makes it worse

1207
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,218
Why?

1208
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,521
We lose peace of mind

1209
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,519
Would you have been better off,
if you had married her?

1210
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,790
Suhra, you do know, don't you?

1211
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,702
He was deeply
in love with her

1212
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,396
Isn't it true?

1213
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,342
He has written her
many love letters

1214
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:45,709
But she didn't budge

1215
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:49,743
Haven't you
told her all this?

1216
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,446
Suhra!

1217
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,820
Did she get angry
and walk out?

1218
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,552
Don't blurt out stuff
in such an insensitive way

1219
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,328
I thought she knew

1220
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:24,243
So I'm not the only one
in my husband's heart

1221
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:26,012
Annie occupies it too

1222
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,857
I studied in
St Josephs school

1223
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,622
I was a bright student
I even got distinction in 10th grade

1224
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:40,966
Father said, girls need not study
This was more than enough

1225
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,897
I tried to tell him
I want to study further

1226
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,393
And become a doctor

1227
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:50,001
Father promised to get me
married to a doctor

1228
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,508
I'm so unlucky

1229
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:57,044
No one listened to my wish
to stand on my own feet

1230
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:02,347
Don't feel so unhappy
Annie has no interest in Rafiq ue

1231
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:05,719
When in college
I too had my crushes

1232
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,590
But I never told anyone

1233
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:12,462
It isn't possible to see
into another's heart, can we?

1234
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:22,340
Just think about it
Try to love Rafiq ue

1235
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:25,867
Even today you are more
your father's daughter

1236
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,039
You must understand
you are Rafique's wife also

1237
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:32,981
Everything will be alright

1238
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:51,331
I really thought
you would've told Suhra

1239
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:54,400
You should have
After all she's your wife

1240
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:57,476
Only now she knows
who my parents are!

1241
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:58,704
Imagine confiding to her?

1242
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:02,044
Radhika
Any problem?

1243
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,539
I've somehow comforted her
Now just be quiet

1244
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:06,484
Won't you understand?

1245
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:09,920
Pour me a drink

1246
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,985
Sing a song, Sidhu

1247
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:15,924
Sing, dude

1248
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:18,486
I sang once
That is enough

1249
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:21,757
- I am okay with this
-You sing

1250
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,865
Sing Sidhu

1251
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,031
It's been so long
since I heard you sing

1252
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:30,875
Revathi is so lucky
Sidhu has such a sweet voice

1253
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,378
Do you know how many
girls lost sleep over it?

1254
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,812
Which song do
you want, Radhika?

Whichever
Up to you

1256
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,792
Ladies and gentleman
Sidhu will now sing

1257
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:06,837
I'll start?

1258
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:22,688
- Such a great feeling
-What...?

1259
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:32,131
- The earth, these rivers, this night
-And...?

1261
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:47,848
"Such a lovely feeling too"

"This world, these rivers
and this night with you"

1263
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:04,554
"We are so close to each other
Moon and stars are far out there"

01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:19,241
...you forgot me and our son

1275
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:23,204
Go live with her if you want

Don't sing in front of me
I can't bear it

Shut up
Keep your voice down

What flower did you say?
Yes! Jasmine

1279
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:38,557
That fragrance is still there
in your heart, right?

1280
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,790
I am going away
with my son

You can sing, smell jasmine
and do whatever you want

- Enough!
-Why should I?

1283

It's enough

1284

I can't live a life
of indignity like this

1285
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:53,801
There's a limit to
what I can tolerate

1286
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:55,313
I have only that to say

1287

Is it Radhika or me?

-Why?

Is it a crime to sing?

You behaved horribly
towards Revathi

Is there any family

Look at us
We fight everyday

01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,384
We can never be
without quarreling

we patch up, that's all

Ask Sidhu

He must be the one who is
most miserable amongst us

all women are the same

1406
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:17,298
Maybe he is into
another relationship

1407
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,669
Last week I called him
because she asked me to

1408
01:43:21,728 --> 01:43:23,207
I reprimanded him

1409
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:27,174
He listened to me
without saying a single word

1410
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:28,746
And then hung up on me

1411
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:32,511
Radhika can't even
imagine a life without him

1412
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:33,975
Poor thing!

1413
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:38,384
She came here
to get some relief

1414
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:39,886
But here-

1415
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:41,791
It's her birthday today

1416
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,486
I did not mean to hurt Radhi-

1417
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,587
Revathi, understand this

1418
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:50,334
Radhika's heart belongs
completely to John

1419
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,392
There is no place
in it for Sidhu

1420
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,269
Benny, can you get a cake?
She'll come if I call her

1421
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:04,214
I can easily arrange a cake
Our Prasad can do it

1422
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:05,306
Just a minute

1423
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:12,481
His mobile is switched off

1424
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:17,389
Prasad gave me
a box this morning

1425
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:19,556
Alavi'kka

1426
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,525
Where is the box I kept here?

1427
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:24,694
You leave it lying around
Someone will walk away with it

1428
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:26,237
I've kept it inside

1429
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:39,550
Xavier!

1430
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,451
- What is it?
- Look at this

1431
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:45,389
Rad hika

1432
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,786
Try calling that number

1433
01:44:58,425 --> 01:44:59,631
Switched off

1434
01:45:30,657 --> 01:45:33,467
- Happy Birthday, my love
-John

1435
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:58,359
Can you give me your phone?

1436
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:04,052
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1437
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:06,061
'Dear Radhika
I am Revathi'

1438
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,724
'Amisunderstanding
which lasted only for a minute'

1439
01:47:09,823 --> 01:47:12,099
'I couldn't control myself'

1440
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:16,571
'Only now we found
the gift John sent you'

1441
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:19,906
'Your beloved John is
waiting for you in Paris'

1442
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:22,112
'Will you please forgive me?'

1443
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,708
'Happy birthday, Radhika'
