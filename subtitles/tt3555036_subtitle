1
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,160
The man who spread fame of Telugu
people all over the world,

2
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,330
the one and only real 'Legend',

3
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,150
Visakhapatnam Earlier Days...

4
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,580
I like her.

5
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,880
Fix the marriage and inform us.
- Okay.

6
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,550
What's this while coming to meet bride?

7
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,250
People vote for good man
in your region,

8
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,830
people in my region vote
for tough man!

9
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,900
Brother, sister-in-law is very beautiful.

10
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,240
But your father-in-law appears
little soft, brother.

11
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,900
Why would everyone be like us?

12
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,510
Grandpa...get up!

13
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,750
Subba Rao! Don't worry!

14
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,580
Get some water.

15
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,250
Grandpa, get up!

16
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,390
You get down!
- Get down...get down from car.

17
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,490
Get down from car.

18
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,790
Is this the way to drive a car?
Look at him!

19
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,430
If people get injustice,
there's one family here to protect them.

20
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,790
Milk...take it.

21
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,620
Son!
- Mother!

22
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,630
Give the bigger glass to him, please.

23
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,730
I know what to give to my son,
you take this glass, daughter-in-law.

24
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,070
Let anything happen anywhere,
it comes to our door step.

25
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,740
I don't know what to do!

26
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll give milk to my younger child,
mother-in-law.

27
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,680
Which place do you belong to?

28
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,880
Kurnool!
- Why did you come here?

29
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,880
What?

30
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,990
Sir...they came to see my daughter
as bride.

31
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,420
Stop! What's this inquiry?
How dare you make us stand here?

32
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,720
I don't care who you are!

33
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,100
Do you who am I in my region?
25 MLA's win or lose with my support.

34
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,830
I've been MP for 4 terms.

35
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,870
Twice I was made cabinet Minister.

36
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,080
We never ask for anything,
whether it is votes or seats.

37
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,780
Do you know who he is?

38
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,520
He's not just leader of Rayalaseems region
but to the entire state.

39
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,620
You say future leader, he must know
how to behave with people, right?

40
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,620
Okay, let bygones be bygones.

41
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,460
Pay compensation to the victim,

42
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,530
people are angry about the incident,

43
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,040
please ask forgiveness and go.

44
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:36,960
What?

45
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,100
Thousands die for me there.

46
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,880
We put a garland to the body
and Rs.100 to his wife.

47
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,780
Do you want me to ask forgiveness
from these poor people?

48
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,790
Leave him !

49
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,790
How dare you touch him !

50
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,730
Leave..leave...

51
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,140
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

52
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,510
This campus is run with an aim.

53
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,080
They're the future!

54
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,180
Everything will be fine
only they're fine.

55
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,690
Our results must improve further.
- Yes, madam.

56
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,860
Ask me anything for that.
- Okay, madam.

57
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,460
Mother!
- Come, son.

58
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,690
Greetings, sir.

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,690
Bye.

60
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,450
Your husband knows that!
I know this!

61
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,050
Uncle has turned the heat on them,
you got bail, brother-in-law.

62
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,480
Uncle...uncle...

63
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,090
Brother...brother...

64
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,920
What?

65
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,820
We kidnapped mother and son, brother.

66
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,900
If he gets beaten up with slipper by
my son before your own people,

67
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,940
and if he falls at his feet
seeking forgiveness,

68
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,870
I'll leave you!

69
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,840
Tell your husband to come.

70
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,840
If you cross swords with us,
your fate will change.

71
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,780
If you take on them,
your heads will roll down!

72
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,520
You're new to this place
and that family!

73
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,190
They've a madness!

74
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,120
When they hear about people,
they forget about themselves.

75
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,130
He's not just heir to the property
but to the principles of the family also.

76
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,710
He'll melt for tears but
he's not scared of weapons.

77
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,980
If you ask will you die for people
or live for 100 years?

78
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,050
My son will choose the first!

79
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,280
You can't scare him.

80
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,730
I don't know what flows in his body,
is it blood or acid?

81
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,700
He killed before he could
utter a word, brother.

82
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,130
Brother-in-law, father is dead.
Why are you like that?

83
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,870
I'll cry for an hour,
will he come back alive?

84
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,370
I'll cry for a day,
will he come back alive?

85
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,650
Brother, it is not safe to stay
here anymore.

86
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,720
Let's go back to our place
with the bodies.

87
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,300
I came here to become son-in-law
of this place,

88
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,300
I've understood I must become
their tormentor!

89
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,030
Hereafter this place is ours!
Cremate them here.

90
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,650
What's this? What's this, son?

91
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,650
Where are we going?

92
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,820
What have you left for us
fighting for people?

93
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,930
Your grandfather, your father,
your elder brother!

94
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,720
Today your wife!

95
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,090
How many more deaths this
home must witness?

96
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,170
If you don't change,
our progeny will not survive.

97
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,830
Your sisters won't survive.

98
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,350
Every time there's a death in this home,
I thought you'd change,

99
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,340
you'll never change!
Look at him!

100
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,790
He killed so many people at this age
and taken your path!

101
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,760
Not a drop of water in his eyes
though his mother is dead.

102
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,800
At least please stop him from
taking your path, son.

103
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,370
Mother, he looks like a question to you,
but he appears like an answer to me.

104
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,870
When people face any problem,
they come to us, mother.

105
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,910
Till now this home saw leaders, rulers!

106
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,720
First time someone is born here
to create new history!

107
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,320
A legend is born!

108
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,730
He must grow like that!

109
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,720
He must always be like that!

110
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,100
Jeetender is furious for the insults
heaped on him.

111
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,070
He unleashed money and
muscle power!

112
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,740
He didn't leave any stone unturned
to capture Visakhapatnam.

113
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,920
Look, he's going the wrong route.

114
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,890
I've warned him many times,
but he doesn't care it.

115
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,760
Get him to reform.

116
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,300
Son-in-law, I think you're not doing
the right thing.

117
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,970
He didn't spare even his father-in-law
for trying to stop him.

118
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,270
The next moment after this
incident happened,

119
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,970
elderly woman fearing situation
would go out of control,

120
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,270
making her son to accept,

121
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,380
she sent grandson to London
in the name of education.

122
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,800
People thought that was an accident.

123
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,190
But she knew it was a murder.

124
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,240
That's why she decided grandson mustn't
come to India even on father's death.

125
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,310
Jeetender who grew up with money
and muscle power,

126
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,810
his father's political legacy too helped
him grow more powerful,

127
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,480
as he wished Jeetender became
the ruler of Visakhapatnam.

128
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,420
Few years later...

129
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,150
Dubai...

130
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,510
Sharjah Border...

131
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,030
What was our mistake, sir?

132
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,630
You've come to foreign country,
you've a good job,

133
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,090
but leaving that,

134
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,210
Telugu people's passports are missing,
they're going to jail,

135
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,370
how dare you lodge a complaint with
Embassy on me saying I'm responsible for it?

136
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,550
That's our responsibility, sir.

137
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,980
Why did you respond for someone else?

138
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,550
If you face the same situation,
let me see who will come to save you!

139
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,260
Bury all of them here, boys!

140
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,900
Salal bhai! Escape!

141
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,330
Bhai, run away!

142
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,260
What happened?
What happened?

143
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,630
Run away!
- Run away?

144
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,400
Who dared to beat you?
- It's not hand but paw!

145
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,320
How dare you enter my area
and beat me!

146
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,520
If you change place, your food and
place of bed will change,

147
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,720
how can blood change,
 bloody fool!

148
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,410
You show them colourful world baiting
them with good jobs in Dubai,

149
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,410
they trust and come here,
you make them servant maids.

150
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,760
If they question, you confiscate their
passports and throw them on streets.

151
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,650
Because of you without food and
unable to go back to home,

152
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,490
3000 Telugu people are
rotting in jail.

153
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,560
When they die, nobody is there to
send back their body also.

154
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,770
By evening passports must
reach Indian Embassy,

155
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,600
pay their balance salary and
arrange to send them back to India.

156
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,500
If not...

157
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,770
I like your attitude of fighting
for others.

158
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,280
Come.

159
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,690
I've been trying since morning to wish
you on your birthday, where were you?

160
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,190
Got late offering prayers, uncle.

161
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,290
Give that laptop to me.

162
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,600
Your fiances' phone!
- Fiances' phone?

163
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,790
It seems he's offering prayers, mother-in-law.

164
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,970
Wait a minute, talk to everyone here.

165
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,540
Happy birthday, Krishna.
- Thank you, grandma.

166
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,820
Will you marry at least this year?

167
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,210
I want to tell you, grandma.

168
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,920
A girl here loved me very much.

169
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,920
I too have good opinion about her.

170
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,820
But you must approve her, right?

171
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,360
Is she Telugu girl?
- 100% Telugu!

172
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,800
How about our style of dressing,
customs and traditions?

173
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,130
She's perfect.

174
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,770
But little adulterated with local culture.

175
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,820
How about prayers and devotion?

176
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,260
She spend entire weekend in
devotion and prayers.

177
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,600
What are you waiting for?
Bring her here.

178
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,270
We're living here peacefully away
from that place and fights.

179
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,610
No dear, we're coming there,
book tickets.

180
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,870
Okay, grandma.

181
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,940
Your journey will be
in a week, grandma.

182
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,280
We can't wait till then.
Please send her photo.

183
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,890
Don't mind how it may be!
- Please send immediately.

184
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,020
Look there!

185
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,840
What sexy?
She's 100% traditional.

186
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,440
What traditional? She appears like this
but when they both meet...

187
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,810
I think they'll be rocking!

188
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't kill me sexily like a bathing beauty
in soap advertisement...

189
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,860
Don't pound me with beauty
and youth...

190
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,200
Your body is sweet,
I'm like an ant following it...

191
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:13,360
Hey lady, your hot body is
attacking me...

192
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Time bomb blew up in
my heart, O girl...

193
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,820
A cyclone has hit my heart, O girl...

194
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,160
You filled me with bullets from
your stengun like eyes...

195
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:50,260
You doused me in colors
engulfing me like rainbow...

196
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,640
You've brightened my eyes
like headlights, O boy...

197
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,580
Come on, switch off light in
my bedroom, O boy...

198
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:33,180
There are so many angles of your beauty
to shake up mass and class...

199
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:39,160
Shall I go on jolly journey
 of love with you?

200
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,280
You're like a champagne of fragrance...
Let open to celebrate with kiss...

201
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,600
You're a speedometer
without kilometer...

202
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,800
Everything I have is all yours...

203
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,060
Your mini shorts are making me
go insane...

204
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,120
You're devouring me with looks...

205
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,320
A speeding lorry has hit
my heart, O girl...

206
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,780
Marry and have me, O boy...

207
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,860
You're an alluring apple
which I desire to bite...

208
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,700
My mind is jammed 
with your thoughts...

209
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,740
I'm getting crumpled
 with your dreams...

210
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,880
Okay, I'm giving green
 signal to you...

211
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,080
O girl, you're a cricket ball and
you've clean bowled me...

212
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,140
In the ground of life and
in the game of love...

213
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,220
I'll make you hit a
 six on every ball...

214
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:02,780
Watching you like this...
Fire of desire and passion is burning me...

215
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,740
The rain dance has been
 completed in my heart, O girl...

216
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:15,120
I'll serve you hot tea, O boy...

217
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,550
Where are we now?
- In Dubai!

218
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,110
I'm not asking about the location.

219
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm asking about the
 situation we are in.

220
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,550
In running your business profitably,
I didn't think about my losing hair.

221
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,450
Do you know why?
Because I liked your family culture.

222
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,390
In such a family,
a marriage without any thrill.

223
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,570
I can live without food
but not without thrill.

224
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,070
Marriage is same
whether it is here or there.

225
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
How can it be same?

226
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,980
There, it is turmeric, vermillion,
canopies and festoons!

227
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,310
Here, it is sand, date palms,
minced meat and dates!

228
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,250
You've holy cow there to offer prayers.

229
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,150
What will you pray here?
- Holy Camel...

230
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,890
We must honor the
 local traditions, right?

231
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,290
Like they said be a Roman while in Rome...
- I'll lose thrill with silly philosophy.

232
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,160
Since the girl doesn't belong
to our culture.

233
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,890
At least arrange marriage
in our tradition.

234
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,350
I've arranged a grand party
spending Rs.1 crore.

235
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,850
I've booked rooms for aunt in Atlantis.

236
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,040
When are they coming?

237
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,190
They're not coming.
We're going there.

238
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,220
Isn't the marriage here?
In India?

239
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,290
I fixed it.

240
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,860
Are you mad?
Crazy?

241
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,800
Monkey faced! You bald head!

242
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,870
Over acting boredom!
- Don't take it serious.

243
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,130
She's abusing me and without
stopping her, why do you like that?

244
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,540
Can you abuse him?
- To hell with him !

245
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,540
I think you taught her to abuse
more than language.

246
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,210
If priest asks her to say yes in marriage,
she may say go to hell.

247
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,410
Just a girl!
- What are you talking?

248
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,320
In fact girls mustn't talk
like this, Krishna.

249
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,430
What did you tell my friends?

250
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,650
Why did you shift the
 marriage to India?

251
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,070
Here, next minute after marriage
you'll be in beach wearing bikini.

252
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,570
At least you'll stay in a 
sari till evening there.

253
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,630
Just after signing register,
you'll hit the bar with friends.

254
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,100
You'll eat traditionally with
other guests after marriage there.

255
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,970
I took this decision to save
our culture.

256
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,240
What he says is for our good, right?

257
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,120
Why didn't you tell that before
she abused me?

258
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,350
She was in flow,
I didn't know where to cut it.

259
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,290
Then, let's go as you say.

260
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,260
Okay.

261
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,330
How are you, Simhachalam?

262
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,230
Are you doing fine, Pydithalli?

263
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,500
What a good catch of fish!

264
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,080
It seems sea is on high tide!

265
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,640
You go into sea at odd hours,
be careful!

266
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,570
That's routine to us,
what brings you here, MP?

267
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,720
Ameer, Central Minister who works
for you in Delhi is here to meet you.

268
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,550
Greetings, Simhachalam!
- Greetings.

269
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:26,600
After years of struggle your leader Jeetender
has got a chance to lead your state.

270
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,530
You're happy, right?

271
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,100
There's only one hurdle, that old and
pending case between you and him,

272
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:43,010
if you tell court that Jeetender has
no connection to this case,

273
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,620
he'll become CM, look his children
too are here to request.

274
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,690
Why don't you answer me?

275
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,330
You too were MLA for a term.

276
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,730
You too know how difficult it is
to grow in politics.

277
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm asking you ignorantly,

278
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,530
if he becomes CM,
isn't it like you becoming CM?

279
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,050
A VIP is standing there and
you spat here!

280
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,110
Shouldn't you've spat on his face?

281
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,450
We'll not withdraw the case.

282
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,380
Stop, sir!

283
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,730
Go back to your work!

284
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,060
He came from Delhi,
what the hell will he do?

285
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,500
Kill them !

286
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,670
Why this haste?

287
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,670
What could be done with words,
why weapons?

288
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,840
They didn't listen, did they?

289
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,540
He came from Delhi.

290
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,280
You came to broker a compromise.

291
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,780
That's why I gave you a chance.

292
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,620
But I knew this would be the result.

293
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,880
Look there!

294
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,160
This is common in politics.

295
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,340
I'll take care of it, sir.

296
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,430
I'll dump the bodies in sea.

297
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,610
Fishes will eat the evidence.

298
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,910
Finished everyone!
No evidence at all.

299
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,850
What about him then?

300
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,850
Go fast!

301
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,920
Finish him !

302
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,870
If you didn't fix program of buying gifts,
we'd have reached Annavaram.

303
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,970
You're home grown birds!
You're like silver plate.

304
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,540
After eating you'll clean and
keep it safely in bureau.

305
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,510
We're guests,
we're like banana leaves.

306
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,410
After eating,
they'll roll and put in dust bin.

307
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm buying gifts to make a place
in your people's hearts.

308
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,880
Why did you buy here instead of Dubai?
- With respect?

309
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,420
Krishna, she's addressing me
with respect.

310
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,920
Did you the change in her
after reaching India?

311
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,820
The girl who used only wild abuses
is addressing with respect.

312
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,630
Respect was born in India, right?

313
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,740
They said be Indian buy Indian,
so I bought gifts here.

314
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,000
Why do you then earn there
and send money here?

315
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,240
Just because working with NASA,
did Abdul Kalam bring a rocket with him?

316
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,510
He came back with knowledge.
I'm also like that.

317
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,910
You fool! Bloody bastard!

318
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,850
How dare you compare
yourself with Kalam?

319
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,850
Unintelligent dog!
 Thief of Teynampet!

320
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,680
Rogue of Pondy Bazaar!
 Donkey!

321
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,430
Does respect has so short life?

322
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,930
Can you abuse him like that?

323
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,800
Krishna, you react very slow.

324
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,530
Why do you stop after
 she said everything?

325
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,800
We can only watch the lightning,
can we dare stop it?

326
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,610
Abuse is also like that,
we can't cut the flow.

327
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,340
You're right,
how many languages she knows?

328
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,450
She's an Air Hostess, she knows the
language every seat speaks.

329
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,680
So, other languages are
dominating mother tongue.

330
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,420
Let's do one thing, she abuses me,
I get abused, your stopping isn't good.

331
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,790
I've cotton, I'll close my ears with it
and sleep peacefully.

332
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,630
He's just a burden to earth,
how could he become your Guru?

333
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,830
Useless Guru!

334
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,400
Not only you, even the cotton is unable
to control her abuses.

335
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,670
You put the cotton
 stubs in my ears.

336
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,090
I'm confused with her abuses and
don't know what I'm doing also.

337
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,920
This time I'll use cotton to
close my ears and sleep.

338
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,790
Where will you run away from me?

339
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,470
Where ever you may go,
you've to come around us!

340
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,570
This Vizag is totally dependent on us!

341
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,170
Just place will change.
Death will not!

342
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,760
Take him to the hospital!

343
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,630
Come.

344
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,610
You sit in the car!

345
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,010
Move away, boys!

346
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,150
Who are you?

347
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,510
Reverse the jeep!

348
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,110
How dare you hit me in centre!

349
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,360
Give me your address,
I'll come and beat you in your house.

350
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,550
I've a bad habit!

351
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,520
I'll fix in my mind not to see few things
and hear few things.

352
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,320
By mistake if I see or hear,
my temper will raise!

353
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,550
Sir....
- Yadav?

354
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,760
Bhaskar Goud?

355
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,460
Yes, sir!

356
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,750
Sir, it's not safe for you to be here.
Please go....please go, sir.

357
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,160
What will happen if I stay?
How is Raghavaiah?

358
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,560
Are Krishna Rao and
 Anand doing fine?

359
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,130
All are fine, sir. Rahgavaiah's daughter
is getting married day after tomorrow.

360
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,770
They'll be very happy to know
you're here.

361
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,840
Know I'm here?
Tell him I'll attend the marriage.

362
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,940
Okay, sir.

363
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,950
Sir, please wait, we'll fix the flat tyre.

364
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,320
Okay.

365
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,780
Where's Guru?

366
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,110
He fell there in the jerk you gave him.

367
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,830
Do we need extra luggage?

368
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,800
Let's throw him on road,
some lorry would run over him.

369
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,800
Poor elderly man, may not take it.
Give me another option.

370
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,710
Shall I mix nail polish with coke
and give him?

371
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,080
He's old, will it work on him?
 Tell me another option.

372
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,740
You both are discussing
about options on me.

373
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,400
You hold him tightly,
I'll stab him to death.

374
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,300
Fingerprints may get you caught.

375
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,480
Tell her to wear gloves
to stab comfortably.

376
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:32,240
This idea is very good.
Guru, you...

377
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,220
What's happening here?

378
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,760
The girl wants to kill you,
I was trying to stop her.

379
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,340
It doesn't look like stopping her
but helping her.

380
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,080
You've closed your ears with cotton...

381
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,340
Do you want to close my nose
with cotton and give me a funeral?

382
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,120
What a good timing sense
you've developed, Krishna?

383
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,220
Sir, your car is ready.

384
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,890
Bye.
- Okay, sir.

385
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,730
About meeting us, the fight here or
attending Raghavaiah's daughter's marriage,

386
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,700
don't tell anything to grandma.
- Why?

387
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,870
They're living somewhere peacefully
leaving this town.

388
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,870
No need to hurt the old woman
at this age.

389
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,160
Who is he?

390
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,290
Who will dare go against you in Vizag?
I'm sure he's an outsider.

391
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,160
I'll not leave him.
I'll take care.

392
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,270
He got severely injured... but
refusing to get treated, sir.

393
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,440
BP is also on raise.

394
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,830
It's not wrong.

395
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,240
Once we get beaten up in Vizag.

396
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,740
If BP is under control,
how can he be my son?

397
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:03,120
Can you remain like this for 2 days?
Is that enough for you?

398
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,350
Enough, sir.

399
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,780
What happened to that ex-MLA?
- Didn't yet find him, sir.

400
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,180
He mustn't leave Vizag at any cost.

401
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,980
The man who beat my son mustn't live.

402
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,460
Why did you come here?
- Certainly not to hurt you, grandma.

403
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,170
Marriage isn't just our family affair,
she too has a family.

404
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,900
I thought I should talk to them and
marry her before both families.

405
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,840
We rushed in, mother-in-law,
what he says is also right.

406
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:13,430
Okay, you're here for marriage,
don't do anything without my knowledge.

407
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,830
You both look like Lord Rama and Sita.

408
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,030
Though dialogue is old,
it matches the culture perfectly.

409
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,340
Who is he?
- He's...

410
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,270
He's hardly a meter tall,
how can he be Guru?

411
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,950
Guru must have matter not meters.

412
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,420
They're ready in this dress
to go to Dubai, right?

413
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,890
How it would be if they come wearing
traditional dresses...

414
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,860
Like the couple Rama and Sita....
Like the love of Radha and Krishna...

415
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,200
You must unite as one like
Gowri and Shankar...

416
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,270
Like sky and blue colour...
Like light and lamp...

417
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,880
You must live together as man
 and wife like milk and honey...

418
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,560
Your silk sari is beautiful...
Your way of dress and make up is beautiful...

419
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,560
The magic of Telugu beauty
is pulling me towards you...

420
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:36,410
Your sari end is beautiful....
Your thin waist is beautiful...

421
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:41,070
My heart skipped a beat seeing
your sensational sari pleats...

422
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,920
I was born beautiful for you,
it must become yours...

423
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,320
Garland made for you
must reach only you...

424
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,190
If you're giving yourself to me,
what else can I ask?

425
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,670
Your delicious smelling beauty
is making my mouth water...

426
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,480
You make me remember the
dancing doll of Thanjavur...

427
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:10,030
You've enchanted me with your magic...

428
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:18,320
I'm spreading fragrance with your love...
My youth blazing sun and here I'm...

429
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:52,420
My desires are moving towards you
like a paper boat floating in water...

430
00:46:52,620 --> 00:47:01,650
You've settled like a pot on my waist
before I could call you...

431
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,660
My desires are galloping on you
like horses...

432
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,990
I purposefully freed the leash...

433
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,340
Run and break the bunds like
wild sea...

434
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,480
Go wild and flood over me...

435
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,940
You make me remember the
dancing doll of Thanjavur...

436
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,490
You've enchanted me with your magic...

437
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:34,790
I'm spreading fragrance with your love...
My youth blazing sun and here I'm...

438
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:13,430
Don't walk in mid noon sun
to hurt your feet...

439
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:21,470
When I'm under you shadow,
why should I be afraid of anything?

440
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:30,850
I'll apply kohl on your eyes
with the dark night...

441
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,250
I'll cover the sun with my sari and
prolong the night with you...

442
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,690
You make me remember the
dancing doll of Thanjavur...

443
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,240
You've enchanted me with your magic...

444
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:55,530
I'm spreading fragrance with your love...
My youth blazing sun and here I'm...

445
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,970
Every meeting must become memorable.

446
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,620
Mustn't think Manikyam attended
this marriage and went away.

447
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,530
Though I'm gone, the thrill of
my attendance must remain with you.

448
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,640
Hey elder one!
- Me?

449
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,460
Yes, take this.

450
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,220
What's this?
- Nighty!

451
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,150
For me to wear?
- No, to keep it.

452
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,760
What?

453
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,760
Didn't get me, right?

454
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,320
If I give you wine bottle or shaving kit,
you'll drink and use it.

455
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,900
But you'll keep this safely in shelf.

456
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,330
Every time you see this,
you'll remember me.

457
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,570
What am I to do with it?
- Keep it safely as my memorabilia.

458
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,440
If I give lip stick or nail polish,
you'll use it.

459
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,420
but neither you can 
smoke nor drink.

460
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,160
They spoil your health and
make you remember me.

461
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,720
What's this?

462
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,610
T-shirt! Can't you see it?
- How it will fit me?

463
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,860
If I give ice cream or chocolate,
you'll grow fatter eating it.

464
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:30,360
Not just TV and books,
everything I give also motivates people.

465
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,800
With determination to wear this T-shirt
someday, you're fat like a wild boar,

466
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,380
you must get thin like a calf!

467
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,720
Girls falls for boys only
not for wild boars!

468
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,550
If you feel the thrill once, 500 
nerves in your body will respond!

469
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Though not tall
you've developed taller culturally.

470
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,980
What's that?
- Left over food, uncle.

471
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,650
Left overs? You serve coffee, right?

472
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,460
Generally everyone takes coffee but
you like thrill, so leftover food drink.

473
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,030
Did you give it for that?

474
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,710
What have you made for breakfast?

475
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,560
Idly and dosa!

476
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,890
Instead of telling,
why did you burn my hand?

477
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,790
Thrill! You need the thrill of
eating it hot, right?

478
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,290
Looks like they've understood
my concept very well.

479
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,670
Do you've a swimming pool here?
- No, we've a big well.

480
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,470
Come, let's go.

481
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:14,840
Draw water.

482
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,910
If you've work with CM, will you 
go to CM or will he come to you?

483
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,310
This is why they say people
with brawn have no brain.

484
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,820
You silly boy, we must go to the CM.
- Then, you must go to the water.

485
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,660
Why did you push me into well?

486
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,400
What happened?

487
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,120
Uncle is enjoying thrill inside.
- Thrill?

488
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,500
What's this, Guru?
There's no end to your thrills.

489
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,370
You must draw water to take bath,
would anyone jump into well?

490
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,450
Did I jump?
That bull dozer pushed me into well.

491
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,080
I beg you, please get me out.

492
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,570
Is your Guru still alive after
falling into well?

493
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,690
I think she's feeling sad
that I survived the fall.

494
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,400
Are you feeling hurt?

495
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,970
I think uncle's 500 nerves
are thrilled.

496
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,570
He's doing yoga.

497
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:25,800
Add another 1,000 with that 500,
all the nerves are shivering in fear.

498
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,120
What do you think of him?
Who do you think he is?

499
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,980
He's Bendu Manikyam who once
broke the back of Bombay mafia.

500
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,730
He was an auto driver Manikyam
in Chennai for his family!

501
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,900
Now he has changed his style with trend
and become Gundu Manikyam.

502
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,840
Me?

503
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,150
Please don't play with his patience.

504
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,080
If he gets furious...

505
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,800
We insulted you without knowing
your dangerous flashback.

506
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,940
But surely we'll use your heroism.

507
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,940
Why did you colour my character
with that paint?

508
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,440
Just give you some lift.
- They say they'll use it.

509
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,540
You make this gesture.

510
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,780
I don't know how
 they will use me.

511
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,950
Your uncle saved him by saying
he's Basha.

512
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,550
He's not Basha?

513
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,790
Is he Basha?
He's hardly a foot tall.

514
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,960
Can he survive if 
hit with iron rods?

515
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,000
He was struggling in well,
he's not that worth.

516
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,230
Let's test him once.
- How do we test him?

517
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,540
Let's stab with this.
- Basha if he survives or else corpse.

518
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,900
I'll stab him.

519
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:06,170
Always you? I'll do it this time.
- I will also stab.

520
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,810
This time I'll stab him.

521
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,210
I'll also stab him.
- I'll also stab him.

522
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,590
He's male, right?

523
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,810
After he stabs him,
rest all stab him once.

524
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,160
Why are you distributing
to stab me like sweets?

525
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,500
What's this?
- Hey you...

526
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:27,000
What's this planning?
Can marriage happen if anyone dies here?

527
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,170
What ever it is,
elder one is really elder one!

528
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,700
Epitome of peace!

529
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,170
Kill him when he goes
 for morning walk.

530
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,230
Are you epitome of peace?

531
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,670
Cover it up so that the message
doesn't reach home.

532
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,770
Sprinkle chilly powder
to keep police dogs out.

533
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,210
That's all!

534
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:50,680
This family looks like a big mafia family.

535
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,860
He makes a gesture like this
for everything.

536
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,190
What would happen to me now?

537
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,630
Please come, let's have breakfast.

538
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,730
I'm having breakfast.

539
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,630
Where?

540
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,140
Don't search there,
on the flight to Dubai.

541
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,640
What happened, Guru?

542
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,900
Thrill given by your family has
reached the peak.

543
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,080
I can't bear it.

544
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,610
Without attending my marriage...?

545
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,980
Send a link, I'll bless you online.

546
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,560
My mother-in-law.
- Greetings, madam.

547
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,160
Please be seated, madam.
- Greetings.

548
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,060
She's everything to us.
They're our family members.

549
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,560
Greetings.

550
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,960
My name is Gajapathy Rao,
I'm Visakha district Collector.

551
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,160
I didn't know my daughter is becoming
your daughter-in-law till you told me.

552
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,000
You wait, dear.

553
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,900
They did this with great confidence
on us, right?

554
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:49,350
This is my family,
there's no one else.

555
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,920
I wish to make Sneha also
a member of my family.

556
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,960
I'm pleased.
- If you don't have any objection.

557
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,100
If they like each other,
can we have any objections?

558
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,560
Then, marriage is fixed after a week.
I'll conduct it myself.

559
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,600
As you wish.

560
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,100
Our family deity is
Lord Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy.

561
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,870
It's our tradition to write the marriage
agreement in Simhachalam temple.

562
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,370
Let's visit the temple tomorrow.
- Okay.

563
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,770
I'll come to the temple with my people.
Come.

564
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:23,610
Why are you leaving without talking
to your future son-in-law?

565
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,620
Son-in-law, please call Krishna.
- Okay.

566
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,060
Greetings, sir.
Are you fine, sir?

567
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,030
You talk to each other.

568
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,200
Why did you beat Jeetender's son?

569
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,380
I beat him for while committing
a mistake.

570
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,740
That's what they
 do while awake.

571
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,020
They killed 43 fishermen and dumped bodies
in sea for giving evidence against them.

572
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,180
They've done it, nobody will dare
open against them.

573
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,860
Not only that as Collector
my situation is no different.

574
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,390
Did he kill 43 people?

575
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,430
Yes, the man you saved now,
he won't let him alive.

576
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,080
Uncle...uncle...sir is here!

577
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,680
How are you, Anand?
- Fine, sir.

578
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,690
He's Raghavaiah...

579
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,020
Sir, I'm very happy you're here.

580
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,130
My daughter, sir.
- Greetings, brother.

581
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,900
It seems you bashed
 up Jeetender's son.

582
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,700
He's running mad without
knowing who did it.

583
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,310
Is it necessary now?

584
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,820
Who is this girl, sir?

585
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,150
We're getting married in near future.

586
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,880
Tonight we're having a great party,
you must dance along with her, sir.

587
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,380
Sugar cane is sweet like honey,
take a bite, beau...

588
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,200
You'll go crazy...

589
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:58,530
I'm a piece of joy, enjoy me,
you'll go mad...

590
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,320
You get shot of injection
if you get fever...

591
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,140
I'm an injection that
 gives you fever...

592
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,740
If you ask, I'll give you
 my cell phone number...

593
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,900
Just a whistle and I'm ready
to come with you...

594
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,740
My native is Guntur...

595
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,820
Temperature will raise to 106 °C
on seeing my goods...

596
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,960
My name...

597
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,220
Local brew is waste, looking 
at your eyes are enough...

598
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,880
Anyone would get attracted to it...

599
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,700
Rum and gin are waste,
your lips are enough...

600
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,510
I'll take you in merry-go-round...

601
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:33,040
God made me special...
He hid two daggers in my eyes...

602
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:38,700
He made my cheeks with cherries...
He hung a welcome board on my waist...

603
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:47,480
Your mother gave birth to a live bomb
made of flowers for us...

604
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,200
If I give you sweet kisses,
your sugar level will shoot up...

605
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,990
That's not my mistake...

606
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,760
If I hug you tightly,
your BP will shoot up...

607
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,600
I'm not responsible for it...

608
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,980
Hey girl, you're a danger signal
of beauty and youth...

609
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,900
There's no power cut wherever you are...

610
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,600
But still heat and beat
 are increasing...

611
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,780
Install an AC in my body with
your cool looks...

612
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,500
Shall give up everything and make
my room AC and take you to bliss?

613
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,240
Throwing away my sari end...

614
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,530
Brother...brother...
Simhachalam is in the next room.

615
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,810
What?

616
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,790
I found a letter under your son's bed.

617
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,160
What does it say?

618
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,050
It says he killed the 43 fishermen.

619
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,560
And says he's committing suicide
as repentance.

620
01:04:56,770 --> 01:05:00,500
Repentance in my home?

621
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,800
Then, the man who beat him
has killed him, sir.

622
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:13,840
Video footage of that signal and
hospital footage today are missing.

623
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,190
I'm sure the man who beat has kill him.

624
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,110
Uncle, please see my hand.

625
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,540
Go, uncle!

626
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:49,850
Madam, there's an auspicious time
on the day you mentioned.

627
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,560
I'll fix that.

628
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:52,890
I'm glad.

629
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,490
What brings you here?
You said you'll come to the temple directly.

630
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:01,570
I did but my family thinks it's customary
to take the bride from my house.

631
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,470
If you permit us,
we'll come to the temple directly.

632
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,300
Why should I deny 
them their happiness?

633
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,140
Please take her with you.

634
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,760
CM is here!

635
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,660
Please come, sir.

636
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,350
What's this Jeetender?

637
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,940
High Command is okaying your
name to lead, it happened now...

638
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,550
Your hand isn't behind this, right?
- My hand in your matter?

639
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:59,930
I know nobody in my
generation would survive.

640
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,460
Sir, I got information about the
man who killed your son.

641
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,310
You stay here only!

642
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,810
You stay! You're a kid!

643
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,650
Why are you dull, daddy?

644
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,480
This marriage won't happen, dear.

645
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,230
Why?

646
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,290
Krishna has picked up fight
with Jeetender.

647
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,990
That's a small fight, right?

648
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,990
Last night he killed him in hospital.

649
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:53,740
No chance, daddy.

650
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,750
This marriage will not happen.

651
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:42,450
Yesterday he sent him in the car.

652
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,300
He came to attend his daughter's marriage.

653
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,460
He was here till he killed your son, sir.

654
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,580
Who is he?

655
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,480
Who is he?

656
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,820
Who is he?

657
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,410
Who is he?

658
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,770
Yadav!

659
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,440
What's this?
- Who is she?

660
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,510
Madam, please go away.

661
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,620
Who is she?

662
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,350
Please go away!

663
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,520
Who is he?

664
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,060
I...I approached her first.

665
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,760
Please leave me.

666
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,030
I thought something else,
you're really very fast.

667
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:00,700
If not? What actually...

668
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:01,640
Yes, grandma.

669
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,780
They must reach before auspicious time,
check if they've left home.

670
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,480
Who is he?

671
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:15,730
What happened?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

672
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,900
You killed him, right? It's over!

673
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:22,230
You're going to be the next CM,
it's not good for you to be here.

674
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,340
I'll take care of it.
You go.

675
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,600
Kill him.

676
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,180
No one must be alive.

677
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:31,210
Drag their bodies on road.

678
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:39,030
I'll not cremate your brother's body
with firewood but with their bodies.

679
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,700
God!

680
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:31,670
Here comes the roaring lion...

681
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,310
Like a protective circle of the good...

682
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,210
Justice to destroy the evil...

683
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:44,020
Striking like a cyclone against the bad...

684
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,840
Here comes the roaring lion...

685
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,510
Like a protective circle of the good...

686
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:03,390
Justice to destroy the evil...

687
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,190
Striking like a cyclone against the bad...

688
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:32,770
Take him ! Walk bravely!

689
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,700
Not even a fly will dare to touch you!

690
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:10,460
Hail Lord Narasimha!

691
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:32,680
Courage because I'm not there
or belief that I will never come?

692
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,560
Wherever I may be,
my people are always here.

693
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:42,260
If you dare touch them, you should've
understood with his son's death.

694
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,430
Didn't understand!

695
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:51,010
If anyone takes a step towards us with good
intention, we'll take 10 steps towards him.

696
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:54,270
If you take a step towards with bad intention,
we'll face you 100 steap earlier.

697
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,280
When I take that step,
I don't have any emotions.

698
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,950
No feelings!

699
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,450
No calculations!

700
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,150
No manipulations!

701
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,590
Tell him!

702
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:10,390
Center or state,
position or opposition,

703
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,960
pride or power,

704
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,260
only till I stay out of it!

705
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:14,190
Carrying a pot like started for your father
in this place with your grandpa's death.

706
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:25,200
Every time I thought he has gained balance,
another hole is made to the pot.

707
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,200
Made a small mistake.

708
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,440
When your brother was
killed in hospital,

709
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:41,380
we couldn't judge that lion is on prowl.

710
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:43,610
Had we judged it situation wouldn't
have come to this!

711
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,390
It's not our mistake to judge,
it's our mistake not to kill them till now.

712
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,620
Nobody in his family see
tomorrow's dawn.

713
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,430
What do you want to do?
Do you know who that man is?

714
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,570
Do you know how he is?
Do you know how he comes?

715
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:02,630
He killed all your men and
your grandpa as young boy.

716
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:09,580
Your father was a terror yet
he could make him stand before him.

717
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,510
It was your grandpa's dream to see
your father as state's leader.

718
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,020
As a sample of that ambition,
to show his power,

719
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,990
your father thought of making
your paternal uncle an MLA.

720
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:34,730
I won as MLA all these years
with your support, sir.

721
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:39,170
It is not right to ask me to give up
the seat in favour of your brother.

722
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,550
This time high command has
confirmed the seat to me, sir.

723
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,080
I can't withdraw my nomination.

724
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:53,520
Surveys are in my favour,
I too can't withdraw, sir.

725
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,200
Okay, have it.

726
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:08,370
I think I was 20 then,
faced same problem.

727
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:12,210
3 people challenged my father for the seat.

728
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,440
One wanted to call and discuss.

729
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,050
Father said we'll become cheap.

730
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,790
Wanted to buy another with money.

731
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,050
He said no kick.

732
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,380
He asked, what about the other?

733
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,560
Father said,
my son will take care of him.

734
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,460
What do you think I would've done?

735
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,730
I'll get irritated if anyone
disturbs me.

736
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,670
Watching me kill that day, nobody dares
to compete with me till date.

737
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,840
We'll not contest,
we'll support your brother, sir.

738
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,740
Please spare us, sir.

739
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,490
These people have surrendered,
what about that Simhachalam?

740
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,250
You know who is behind him, right?

741
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,360
Tell me if there's anyone
who won't die if I kill!

742
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,260
Your win is unanimous!

743
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,280
Stop...stop...

744
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:22,110
Though Goddess Gangamma
gives food and protects us,

745
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,780
but it was our sir who changed
our lives.

746
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,450
If he wanted such positions,
won't they walk up to him?

747
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:33,750
Trusting only a worker knows
the difficulty of another worker,

748
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:37,120
you were all just fishermen,
he funded your education,

749
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:41,320
he turned into good men and
gave you this opportunity,

750
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,630
you must keep up his faith!

751
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,570
Hail Goddess Gangamma!

752
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:20,570
Justice to destroy the evil... 
Striking like a cyclone against the bad...

753
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,650
What's this?

754
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:04,380
We'll behave like this only,
will your father come to stop us?

755
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,510
Kill him, boys!

756
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:20,480
Here comes the roaring lion...

757
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:24,150
Like a protective circle of the good...

758
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:28,030
Justice to destroy the evil...

759
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,960
Play the band, boys!

760
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,600
Turn back...turn back the vehicle!

761
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,050
Go fast!

762
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:04,220
We came to his crime,
we'll take him into our custody.

763
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,780
Not him !

764
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:55,000
Stop, sir...please stop, sir.

765
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,670
Stop, sir.

766
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,780
How dare you touch me!

767
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,780
Play flute before deer
 not before lion!

768
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:18,590
Will you try to scare people?
- I will scare them! That's how we do politics!

769
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,200
If you've guts, take on me directly.

770
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:28,800
Hey, politics may be part of your life,
but it is in my blood, bloody fool!

771
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:32,170
State politics was born in my home.

772
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:35,270
If I get into politics
who will dare take on me?

773
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,050
You're unnecessarily inviting
trouble from me.

774
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,150
If my eccentricity increases...

775
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,660
May be you need to increase your
 eccentricity! Mine is on 24 hours.

776
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:52,160
If you cross your limits,
I'll enter your home.

777
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:57,330
You can't bear that output!
- You can't scare me!

778
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:03,300
Food is good for your health.
 Good advice is good for your progress.

779
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,520
Fear of death is good for your lifespan.
Fear!

780
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,580
What's that?
Will you kill me?

781
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:14,780
If anyone tells me what I do,
it'll hurt me. I'll kill you right now.

782
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:20,250
Come...come...kill me!
- Come...come...

783
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,760
Please stop, sir...I beg you, sir.

784
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,590
Stop, please!

785
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,600
SP, I have very
 little patience.

786
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,260
I'm holding myself because
I've faith in this system.

787
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,760
Will you use it or
shall I use it myself?

788
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,370
Sir, we've evidence of your crime.

789
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,610
Whatever it is, prove it in court.

790
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:50,280
Jaidev, the moment I'm out jail,
you'll die the next moment.

791
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,320
Am I a voter to scare me away?

792
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:57,720
I'm a shooter,
I'll shoot you down, bloody!

793
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:45,440
He is a blend of sun, moon, Rama, 
Bheema, Krishna and Vishnu...

794
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:50,240
He doesn't speak,
 his silence is an explosion...

795
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,950
He settles things everywhere...

796
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:57,880
He says he is the people
 and vice versa...

797
01:31:57,890 --> 01:32:01,830
He believes in Bloodshed
 for protecting people...

798
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:08,520
Like he has battlefield in his breath, 
he roars and suppresses his enemies...

799
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:24,040
He is a legend...

800
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:06,080
If you want to be good,
society must be good.

801
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,160
If generations have to be good,
system must be good.

802
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,760
If anyone becomes hurdle to it...

803
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:24,270
He regulates all the laws, capable of doing everything...
He is a Che Guevara in slashing out the darkness...

804
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:31,880
He is sea of energy, he defeats his enemies...
He is Gandhiji's non violence, when fired from a gun...

805
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:36,820
He is moving justice...

806
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:40,420
He reaches faster than light...

807
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:47,460
Though he is leader, he would become a fellow worker
 to make us devoid of worries and will make history...

808
01:33:47,460 --> 01:34:02,980
He is a legend...

809
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,120
Brother!

810
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:44,080
Brother...brother...

811
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:48,060
Day after tomorrow is parents day in school
they told me to come with parents, brother.

812
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,290
You must come, brother.

813
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,430
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
You go, I told you, right?

814
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,930
Please brother.
You must come.

815
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:00,040
Son-in-law! What is he doing there?

816
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,970
That is...

817
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:04,970
No need to purposefully greet death.
Bring him.

818
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:13,410
Go!

819
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:20,960
Both are brothers, right?
Why are you using harsh words for it?

820
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:25,060
You can see only my harshness
but can't see my pain, right?

821
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,630
His mother died,
he didn't change,

822
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:31,070
his father died,
he didn't change,

823
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,570
I though if we raise him away,
he'll change,

824
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,500
he came but no change,

825
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,970
when I asked will you be head of this family
or leader of the people?

826
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:43,980
He left the family for people.

827
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:48,580
Relationship between this family and
him got snapped that day itself.

828
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:00,420
He'll be fine, it's we who die.
That's what I fear!

829
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:04,590
If it's flowers on that house,
we get stoned here.

830
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:10,270
I'm telling you my last word, Raghavaiah!

831
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,270
If anyone in this family gets
affected because of him,

832
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,710
he'll see me dead.

833
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:22,550
Sir, old woman...

834
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:50,500
Sir!

835
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,980
Did you have dinner?
- Not yet, sir.

836
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,520
Have dinner and go to sleep.

837
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:57,420
What about you, sir?

838
01:37:52,850 --> 01:38:13,330
Greetings Goddess...

839
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,590
You're epitome of good deeds...
You wash away sins...

840
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,640
May your mercy be showered on us...

841
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,330
You're the mother of this earth...

842
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,170
You're the creator 
of all 3 worlds...

843
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:34,180
Bless my little dream to come true...

844
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:43,780
You're the omnipotent Goddess...
May your blessing help us achieve our goals...

845
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:50,190
Hail Goddess Mother...

846
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,240
Come, beau!

847
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,420
May God bless with long life!

848
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:58,770
What's this?
- Today is your birthday.

849
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,850
Happy birthday, uncle!

850
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,910
Did everyone have breakfast?

851
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:27,600
Don't ever come here again.
- Why?

852
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,370
Distance between our homes
has increased!

853
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:34,970
If they come to know you come here,
it'll snap forever.

854
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,480
I've studied in Oxford,

855
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:42,870
don't I know how to come
and how not to come to you?

856
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,890
Today is your birthday,
please leave this topic.

857
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,830
Sir, Central Minister is here.

858
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:00,390
Our MP too wants to meet you.

859
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,320
Shall I let them in?

860
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,240
Let's go to them.

861
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:14,900
Here he comes!
I'll get him, you go inside.

862
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,650
Come on, raise slogans!

863
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:20,250
Long live MP!

864
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:29,730
It's politics!

865
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,660
What can we do?

866
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:35,260
We must use people,
we mustn't fight for people.

867
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:38,660
Amir from Delhi is here to talk
about Jeetender.

868
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,360
If you support him...

869
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:43,700
Your future will always be bright!

870
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,940
What are you?
- MP!

871
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,370
What's an MP's duty?
- Public service.

872
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,380
What's this job of broker?

873
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,450
Come on raise slogans!

874
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,020
He's bashing him there.

875
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:57,790
Our slogans are weak before
those strong slaps!

876
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,730
It seems you want support!
What should I support?

877
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:13,400
Why did you slap MP?
 Do you think he's your servant?

878
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,740
Bloody bore!
Come to the point!

879
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,980
Jeetu must come out.

880
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,310
He'll not come and
I'll not allow him to come out.

881
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:25,570
I think you don't 
know about us.

882
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:29,080
I don't give much thought about that,
if I do I'll not allow anyone to be there.

883
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,750
Think, it could be risky to you.
- Risk? For me?

884
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,050
I'll tell you a short story, listen!

885
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,760
A man is running towards a train
coming opposite side,

886
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,830
train is coming fast,
man is running towards it,

887
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:45,590
train hit him and went away.

888
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:47,940
What do you call it?
- Taking risk!

889
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,340
I'll narrate the same
 story differently. Listen!

890
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:54,500
A man is running between railway
 tracks. A train is coming behind him.

891
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:55,840
He's running fast!

892
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,880
Train hits him and went away!

893
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:01,110
What do you call this?
- Taking risk!

894
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,790
Do you know who the train is
in this story? It's me!

895
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:11,450
If anyone faces me or if I go at anyone,
his life is at risk.

896
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,520
I'll run over him!

897
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:19,060
You're talking without knowing our power.

898
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,770
Power?
Yours?

899
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:25,540
Your fate is decided by the
high command's cover.

900
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,810
My fate is decided by the power
in my body.

901
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,110
Yours is lottery, mine is history!

902
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:36,050
Your history is waste paper to us.

903
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,120
If we switch on there,
you'll fly away in the power of fan!

904
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:46,830
Thinking us as waste paper someone
dared to switch on the fan!

905
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:51,660
If lion crossed the threshold
and roars in public!

906
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:55,070
Your fan went shapeless
with our roar!

907
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,740
The inspiration is still fresh
in the minds of people.

908
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:02,480
It is in every man's
 heart! It will be there!

909
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,840
The group that wets beds
on hearing his name,

910
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,020
how dare you pass comment
on my history!

911
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,420
History will repeat!

912
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:17,530
The state about which you said,
in the same state,

913
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:20,960
the seat about which you said,
in the same seat,

914
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:24,930
I'll see Jeetender wins from that seat.

915
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,940
Forget about seat, I'll not let him
reach Assembly gate also.

916
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:36,880
If you get BP, your PA may shiver.

917
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,820
If I get BP, entire AP will shiver.

918
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:06,480
Beau!

919
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:14,250
Why did you come at this hour?
- I couldn't get sleep.

920
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:17,650
I want to go to beach now, beau.
- At this hour?

921
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:22,820
I get you at this hour only.
Please, beau!

922
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:26,750
No...
- Beau!

923
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:27,930
At this hour?

924
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:42,780
Come, beau!

925
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:51,950
Why is he going out with her?
- Shut and go to sleep.

926
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:57,250
Beau! Father!

927
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,800
What's this?

928
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,700
Beau, lift me.

929
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,890
You made also jump the wall!

930
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:32,060
You don't remember how many
people you bashed up!

931
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:37,300
I can never forget that you jumped
the wall for me.

932
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:12,030
Baby shower?
- Yes.

933
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,700
I want her to abort it.

934
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:19,940
Abort it?

935
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:23,270
It seems its again a baby girl.
Doctor told me.

936
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:26,780
So I want it to be aborted.
- What's wrong if it's a girl?

937
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:30,980
Give birth, raise, protect her,
and then marry her off!

938
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:33,990
But if it is a boy, we can live freely.

939
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:36,890
Only we receive, we don't give anything.

940
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,030
Hubby! Doing it at seventh month
can danger mother's life also.

941
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,140
My wife got aborted 3 times,
before he was born as 4th child.

942
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:49,700
Did she die?

943
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,080
You want your family name
to shine with sons!

944
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:58,410
Should our family go to streets
with daughters?

945
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:01,150
Is this right?

946
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,190
No, please...
- Let's do something.

947
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:05,310
Will you please leave now?

948
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,150
No...
- Going direct to Vizag or stopping over?

949
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:32,070
How could you leave her alone
in such a home?

950
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,420
I'll talk to them, please come.

951
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,420
They're talking without any
respect, mother-in-law.

952
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,200
Raju, get the luggage.

953
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,720
Come slowly!
You're pregnant, you may slip!

954
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:46,020
Greetings, grandma.

955
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:49,090
Are you keeping good health?
 Are you taking medicines on time?

956
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,130
Why are you all watching me?

957
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:55,140
Get red water and
ward off evil eye cast on my wife.

958
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:59,870
Uncle, I just said that for fun,
why did you leave in a bad mood?

959
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:07,040
My father is sitting on fast till he hears
the news of an angel's birth.

960
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:12,720
My sweet darling, go and play.
 My room is in upstairs, right?

961
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,720
I'll take bath, soap and shampoo
are in bathroom, right?

962
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:15,720
I've towel with me.

963
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:18,720
Why did you tell me
differently, son-in-law?

964
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:21,230
I mean...I...

965
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,300
Okay, some God changed their
 mind. That's what we want, right?

966
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,840
I'll light a lamp to God.

967
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,740
What happened there?

968
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:42,820
Uncle came there!

969
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,990
Call me uncle once, dear!

970
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:56,260
Uncle!

971
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:02,830
Go and play, dear.
- Okay, uncle.

972
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,170
Why are you beating me?

973
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:08,940
Is your health fine, dear?

974
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,220
Why are you beating without
talking to me?

975
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:17,980
Never get tensed for anything,
especially during pregnancy.

976
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:22,790
You've your brother with you!
Would I let even a fly to disturb you?

977
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,470
Sir!

978
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:41,540
It seems he wanted to abort
because it's a girl.

979
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:43,550
Okay, let's get it aborted!

980
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:46,970
Tell him to give in writing that
the next child will be a boy.

981
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:52,020
How can I decide that?
- Who decides it then?

982
01:50:52,190 --> 01:50:52,990
God decides.

983
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:55,890
Then, why are you changing
his decision?

984
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:58,030
Why are you changing it?

985
01:50:58,230 --> 01:50:59,320
Why are you changing it?

986
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:00,520
He may kill my son!

987
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,830
Why are you changing it?

988
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:06,940
All of you come here,
he's killing my son.

989
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:11,830
How dare you beat him !

990
01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:27,960
You came to our place and
dared to beat him !

991
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,520
Can you cross our boundary?

992
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:32,020
How many daughters will he give birth to?
He has the right to abort it.

993
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:34,600
His wife and his wish.
So what?

994
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,270
It's not wrong to protect the village.

995
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,070
That's your duty!

996
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:47,870
But he's trying to kill an unborn child,
and you've come in support of him,

997
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,310
that is big mistake!

998
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:51,480
That's why I beat him !

999
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,950
You need mother to give birth to you!

1000
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,280
You need wife to take care you!

1001
01:51:58,190 --> 01:51:59,660
You need a sister to teach you to walk!

1002
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:01,550
You need girl friend to date!

1003
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,490
But you don't want a daughter!
Why?

1004
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,290
Live with him !

1005
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:12,560
Woman is not necessity!
 Woman means courage!

1006
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:21,070
Even God must be born
 from mother's womb!

1007
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:25,140
To give birth to such a daughter,
you make calculations,

1008
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,610
you make calculations to raise them,

1009
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:28,920
you make calculations
to marry them off.

1010
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:35,490
If this carries on, in future not in
any house or in city centre,

1011
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:37,590
you've to go to museum
to see a girl!

1012
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:44,940
Without women, no birth!

1013
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,200
Without women, no progression!

1014
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:49,200
Without woman, there's no life in nature!

1015
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:51,470
Without women, there's no nature!

1016
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:56,450
Without women, no birth!
Without women, no progression!

1017
01:52:56,750 --> 01:53:02,020
Without woman, there's no life in nature!
Without women, there's no nature!

1018
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:09,450
If my people are in trouble,
I may come half hour late.

1019
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,390
If any girl is in trouble,
I'll not wait for a moment also.

1020
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:48,520
What?

1021
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:51,000
They're not allowing any lawyer
to bail you out.

1022
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,260
They're not allowing me also
to bail you out.

1023
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:55,340
They say they'll not allow you
to come out of jail.

1024
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:59,330
He didn't care MP also,
he made him run in fear.

1025
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,010
Central Minister too went away
to Delhi unable to do anything.

1026
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,440
What are you doing then?
- You'll get bail tomorrow.

1027
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:17,020
I don't mind rate but see that
it's weightless.

1028
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:18,390
My wife can't carry it.

1029
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,530
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

1030
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,660
Uncle, open the door!

1031
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:30,100
Grandma...grandma...

1032
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:31,770
He's taking away the child!

1033
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:43,510
Oh God!

1034
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:05,640
He said I can never get bail!

1035
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:12,140
Inform him Jeetender is out on bail,
tell him to do whatsoever he can do.

1036
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:14,740
Sir, he got you out on bail.

1037
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:23,250
He arranged the welcome band,
his people gave you the welcome.

1038
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:30,890
How dare you stay with me, eat from
my hands and hide facts from me!

1039
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:35,890
He insulted me so much,
I'll kill him in his own home.

1040
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:38,590
Come on, start the vehicles, boys!

1041
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,330
All are his men, sir.

1042
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:59,620
Where's my brother?

1043
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:41,380
Glory to Lord Narasimha!

1044
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:55,500
I killed your father,
you didn't change!

1045
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:59,840
I killed your men,
you didn't change!

1046
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:05,250
I sent you to jail expecting
you'll change but you didn't!

1047
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:09,850
That's why I killed your brother!

1048
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,850
Only you are remaining!
Waiting!

1049
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:18,670
You can kill my people
but you can't kill my ego!

1050
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:25,000
You may get tired killing people,
but I get excited!

1051
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:29,940
Sir!

1052
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,150
Don't be afraid, dear!

1053
01:58:49,670 --> 01:58:51,660
I'll not kill him now.
Leave.

1054
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:58,470
Though years passed by,
your attitude didn't change!

1055
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:03,370
If you leave your ego, you can live
with respect among people.

1056
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:05,910
If you live by rules,
you've a life of 10 years.

1057
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,540
If you wish to grow aimlessly
 and say I'll stamp out people,

1058
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:14,580
go after the town and go
 overboard with your ego,

1059
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,830
I'll behead you!

1060
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:28,610
If I see you here again, you'll not 
be seen in this world anymore.

1061
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,030
Move...move...

1062
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,860
Brother-in-law!

1063
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,730
What are you doing
 here, brother-in-law?

1064
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:04,440
Why the tears in your 
eyes, brother-in-law?

1065
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:07,780
Come, let's go home and
discuss, brother-in-law.

1066
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,800
I'll behead you!

1067
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,990
Did you get scared, Krishna?

1068
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,890
I knew brother will come.
Why should I get scared?

1069
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:34,000
Son-in-law, send him to London.

1070
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:37,900
He must study there
 and live there only.

1071
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,910
He mustn't come to India
even on my death.

1072
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:48,080
Not only that I'm fixing your
daughter's marriage.

1073
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:51,910
Inform Venkatarayudu 
to meet the bride.

1074
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:01,600
Grandma, tell a girl to wear sari,
they'll wear even if they dislike it.

1075
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:07,640
Insist on eating this tiffin, we'll eat. 
You ask us to pray to God, we'll do it.

1076
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:11,770
But please don't insist to marry
this man, grandma.

1077
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:16,870
It is concerned about my heart. 
I'll marry my beau only.

1078
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,210
Impossible!
- Why?

1079
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:26,680
He's lazy, don't marry him,
he's arrogant, don't marry him,

1080
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:30,190
he's a cheat, don't marry him,
I'll listen to you.

1081
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:41,880
But if you say he feeds many people, he protects people,
 he solves people's problems, he does good to people,

1082
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:44,070
if you tell me not to marry such a man,
how can I listen to you, grandma?

1083
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:45,200
Shut up!

1084
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:49,910
He talks about people and society,
how is he connected to it?

1085
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:52,980
Does anyone orders lion
to protect the forest?

1086
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:54,910
It's lion's duty.

1087
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:59,020
People who can't understand
this call is as cruel animal.

1088
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,090
People who understand this call it
as King of Animals.

1089
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:04,090
He's also like that!

1090
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:07,820
He's lion of this society
that's taken over by evil!

1091
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,830
He's a dictator to the corrupt!

1092
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,660
He's a ruler to the law breakers!

1093
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:24,550
There are so many Gods, people 
in problems pray with devotion,

1094
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:28,180
if Gods respond, there won't 
be any problem, right?

1095
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:34,020
but Gods are sending people like
my beau to solve people's problems.

1096
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:36,280
He's greater than God!

1097
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:40,730
God lives before our home and
you offer prayers in temple.

1098
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:48,530
He's your blood,
how can you not believe it?

1099
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:54,970
He fasts if you fast. If we smile,
 he smiles. If we cry, he stops.

1100
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:57,880
If we face trouble, he'll stand
 like a protecting wall.

1101
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:02,710
His body is there but his heart
is always here, grandma.

1102
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,810
Such a man...

1103
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:10,620
Have I stooped so low level
to take advice from you?

1104
02:03:12,030 --> 02:03:12,960
Enough!

1105
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:18,960
Decide who stays here, you or me?
- I'll tell, mother-in-law!

1106
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:27,210
You don't have place in this house 
after opposing the head of the family.

1107
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:28,910
Leave, dear!

1108
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:36,650
Leave, dear!

1109
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:04,960
What's this?

1110
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:06,950
They fixed my marriage
 with another man.

1111
02:04:07,150 --> 02:04:11,010
I said I'll marry only you.
 They said impossible.

1112
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:13,820
I tried to convince them.
 They threw me out of home.

1113
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:15,050
I arrived.

1114
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:19,060
Already relationships
 are very weak.

1115
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:23,790
It's not right to hurt an old woman
who raised this entire family.

1116
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,300
Tell me, what is right then?

1117
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:29,970
If anything happens to mother,
father is there for her.

1118
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:32,300
If anything happens to grandma,
entire family is there for her.

1119
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:34,970
You're there to protect anyone in trouble.

1120
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:38,110
If anything happens to you,
who is there for you?

1121
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:39,710
That's why I say no!

1122
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:43,320
If I go out, I don't know myself
how would I return home!

1123
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:46,750
Do you need this life 
of no guarantee?

1124
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:50,320
This is not business to see
warranty and guarantee.

1125
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,760
It is life!

1126
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:57,660
I like you. I like to be with
 you. I like to walk with you.

1127
02:04:57,870 --> 02:05:00,430
I like to share your sorrows
and responsibilities.

1128
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:09,100
But still if you feel I'm wrong, you've
 given shelter to many orphans,

1129
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:14,440
you feed poor and needy, you
 give shelter to homeless people,

1130
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:20,360
consider me as one of them and
give me little place in your home.

1131
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:57,620
My life has entered your heart,
what magic have you weaved...

1132
02:05:57,790 --> 02:06:04,600
My heart skipped a beat in your presence,
what holy hymn have you cast on me...

1133
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:11,600
Hearts have united to lose
the sense of time...

1134
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:18,680
You've opened doors to
a new dream world...

1135
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:25,480
My life has entered your heart,
what magic have you weaved...

1136
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:32,620
My heart skipped a beat in your presence,
what holy hymn have you cast on me...

1137
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:07,120
You've arrested my eyes to look
at you only nothing else...

1138
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:14,800
I've tied myself with you
giving myself to you...

1139
02:07:15,410 --> 02:07:22,450
My lonely world is filled with you...

1140
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:28,680
This is the best time
which never came in my life...

1141
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:35,820
I'm there for you as your heart beat...
I'm giving you the world of my love...

1142
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:42,620
My life has entered your heart,
what magic have you weaved...

1143
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:49,600
My heart skipped a beat in your presence,
what holy hymn have you cast on me...

1144
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:27,640
There's something in you
which is mesmerizing me...

1145
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:35,550
You're my start and you're my end...

1146
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:42,650
You've lit fire to my passions...

1147
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:49,090
You've built a nest of desires in me..

1148
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:56,240
Let my mornings dawn with you...
Let my life become your right...

1149
02:08:56,240 --> 02:09:03,040
My life has entered your heart,
what magic have you weaved...

1150
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:10,020
My heart skipped a beat in your presence,
what holy hymn have you cast on me...

1151
02:09:45,190 --> 02:09:47,950
Come.
Get in quickly...quick!

1152
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:05,400
I never attack women!

1153
02:10:07,710 --> 02:10:11,040
But he made me leave this city.

1154
02:10:12,350 --> 02:10:16,410
He hit me as a man 
as well as husband!

1155
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:23,150
We don't eat food without chilly and
we can't live without our ego!

1156
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:29,600
Either I'll kill him or die!

1157
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:43,670
Elephant has bloated ego!
Lion has great appetite for food!

1158
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:46,340
Look, the lion is here!

1159
02:11:58,860 --> 02:12:00,190
2 minutes!

1160
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:34,510
Beau!
- It's almost over!

1161
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:52,200
Beau!

1162
02:14:10,450 --> 02:14:11,940
Beau!

1163
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:22,080
Dear, your beau is here!

1164
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:27,020
Your beau is here...beau...

1165
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:30,950
Start the vehicle,
we've to rush to the hospital.

1166
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:37,430
Take me to home, beau...
take me to home!

1167
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:51,170
I like you. I like to be with
 you. I like to walk with you.

1168
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:53,910
I like to share your sorrows
and responsibilities.

1169
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:56,440
I like to be with you all my life.

1170
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:01,850
Are you happy now?

1171
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:13,220
How many more in the family
have to die for you?

1172
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:19,860
No relation with you...
no connection with your principles.

1173
02:18:20,170 --> 02:18:25,810
Though we're living away from
 you, you're not sparing us!

1174
02:18:29,210 --> 02:18:36,020
You're filling others' homes with light
but putting it off in our home.

1175
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:39,550
Answer to the sorrow of these
grieving parents.

1176
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,590
One who lives by weapons
will not anyone with him!

1177
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:54,800
Except the weapon in hand!

1178
02:18:55,100 --> 02:19:00,170
We can't live anymore
with death facing us!

1179
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:01,700
Can't live!

1180
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:07,680
You say a sinner must be punished.

1181
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:13,910
Though I warned her, she walked
out of home to be marry you.

1182
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:19,630
Now, you're burying her!
 What punishment you deserve!

1183
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,930
Tell me!

1184
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:56,460
Bye!

1185
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:09,900
You're the sky gives shade
like umbrella...

1186
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:19,640
You've become nobody
to yourself like void...

1187
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:29,690
God himself is sending into exile
accusing you of being merciless...

1188
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:39,760
Hearts are shedding tears to stop
with the shackles of justice...

1189
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:48,720
You're the sky gives shade
like umbrella...

1190
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:58,460
You've become nobody
to yourself like void...

1191
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:02,120
Him going into oblivion turned
a boon to your husband.

1192
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:08,960
4 countries and 5 years it took
to make your father get up from bed.

1193
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:14,320
In a way your father's life is
not life at all!

1194
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,970
Lease of life given by 3 women!

1195
02:22:17,910 --> 02:22:22,040
Your mother stopped him seconds
before his head was to roll down.

1196
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:26,300
That girl's love stopped him
from killing your father clearly.

1197
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:31,620
That old woman's sorrow
stopped him for 20 years

1198
02:22:32,150 --> 02:22:35,920
As far as I know nobody
 can stop him now.

1199
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:46,000
To be practical,
what you said is right!

1200
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,900
Anyone has to blabber behind
his back only!

1201
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:53,800
Who has the courage
 to speak before him?

1202
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:58,110
There's power in his eyes, body
and in his house!

1203
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:02,110
It's very difficult to survive
touching him!

1204
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:07,280
But I've survived so many times from him
on the verge of death, what does it mean?

1205
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:10,760
It means there's something
I need to do!

1206
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:14,260
It could be his death!

1207
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:27,270
I'll announce your 
name as CM in 4 days.

1208
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:34,280
I know your mood now.
 I know your task also.

1209
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:37,280
Jeetu, don't leave the opportunity.

1210
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:42,190
He challenged to not let you take that seat,
take the seat that he challenged.

1211
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,550
Next minute, finish him!

1212
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:53,330
Meanwhile what we've to do is, we've to go to 
Hyderabad, pacify few MLA, get them into our grip.

1213
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:57,530
Should I go and pacify them?

1214
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:02,310
Invite the MLA's to a meeting
tomorrow in Vizag.

1215
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:05,310
Arrange a grand party!

1216
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,970
Gift an Audi car to every visitor.

1217
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:12,820
Entire state must talk
 about our party!

1218
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:25,330
Nothing to worry anymore,
you can take him home in a week.

1219
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:28,830
God saved him!

1220
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:50,120
Forgive me, grandma! Though
 I gave up, my enemy didn't stop!

1221
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:54,460
I had to come, one last pending job.

1222
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:58,360
Once done, I'll never come before
you again in this life.

1223
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:04,270
How could you be so patient
like mother earth?

1224
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:08,530
Though she was young,
what she said that day was true!

1225
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:16,040
God lives before your home and
you're offering prayers in temple,

1226
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:19,410
I failed to understand that.

1227
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:24,660
I thought our lives would be peaceful
if you stay away from us.

1228
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:29,500
Now I've understood,
there's no life for us without you.

1229
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:37,340
Not living as one among society but living for
 society, what you believed is true and right!

1230
02:25:38,610 --> 02:25:43,910
Failing to understand this I denied you
everything from your childhood.

1231
02:25:44,450 --> 02:25:53,020
Lastly your people too! Please forgive me!
- Grandma! 

1232
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:08,270
MLA's did come to Vizag
but didn't come here.

1233
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:09,300
Why?

1234
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:12,200
Simhadrigiri, right?
- What?

1235
02:26:12,410 --> 02:26:13,380
Jaidev!

1236
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:24,240
You say you'll never defect to other party
or change the flag! Are you also here?

1237
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:28,110
We're in politics, truths don't gel well
with our profession.

1238
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:29,660
Yes.

1239
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:34,460
Subba Rao! You too defected?
You're too fast!

1240
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:36,320
You're the first to jump!

1241
02:26:36,530 --> 02:26:40,470
If some unknown face like Jeetender
is made CM, how will it help me?

1242
02:26:40,670 --> 02:26:44,630
They promise heavy cash
and good post here.

1243
02:26:45,010 --> 02:26:51,440
You criticize us from morning to evening,
have you also joined the bandwagon?

1244
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:54,010
Just because we had breakfast,
can we skip lunch?

1245
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:58,840
Hello, you brought all the MLA's here!

1246
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:01,900
Where's the leader?

1247
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:13,590
Cutout is sensational!

1248
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:16,440
If we follow him, we'll...

1249
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:39,460
What is your name?
- Muthyala Rao!

1250
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:44,060
I struggled a lot 
and served the party!

1251
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:54,110
But they denied me seat this time
saying I've very bad name in public.

1252
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:56,710
What exactly had happened was...

1253
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:02,480
I occupied 100 acres of land.
 I killed few people who opposed it.

1254
02:28:02,690 --> 02:28:06,380
If we don't occupy lands or kill few,
what are we in politics for then?

1255
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,310
What's your answer to the people?

1256
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:13,460
I asked for a ring road,
Govt. said no!

1257
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:17,460
I asked for metro railway,
govt. said no!

1258
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:21,660
I asked for a Charminar to this city,
govt. said no!

1259
02:28:23,110 --> 02:28:27,670
Foolish society,
it'll believe whatever we say!

1260
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,240
What do you say?

1261
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:31,740
Why should we answer to the
useless society?

1262
02:28:32,110 --> 02:28:34,210
Their calculation is
how much they get for a vote,

1263
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:36,750
how much we can make after
winning seat is our calculation.

1264
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:39,780
Anyone who followed this calculation
never failed in politics.

1265
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:46,190
If I fail, 80% of people in my constituency
belong to my caste.

1266
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:49,760
I'll tell them they're
 insulting our caste.

1267
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:54,690
There's no one in this country
who will not fall for caste and cash!

1268
02:28:57,870 --> 02:29:03,110
Generally only I apply for tenders in
my area, I've earned Rs.50 crores.

1269
02:29:03,310 --> 02:29:04,510
Why are they asking
 accounts for that?

1270
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:08,270
If I don't have the freedom to earn
Rs.50 crores, why do I need this position?

1271
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:13,550
Moreover 10 years in one party
under one flag is boring.

1272
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:18,390
It seems even wind is offering beds.
 So, I came here just for change.

1273
02:29:20,230 --> 02:29:23,220
What will you tell your people then?
- They'll not ask anything, sir.

1274
02:29:23,430 --> 02:29:29,170
With the money I earned, I've already spent
a crore to supply cricket kits and laptops.

1275
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:31,860
Do you know what's the latest
punch dialogue?

1276
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:35,180
Who is not corrupt now?
What's wrong if he too is corrupt?

1277
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:41,180
They say he has already made Rs.50,
they're taking me as role model.

1278
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:43,650
Nobody cares I'm looting them, sir.

1279
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:47,650
It's Sachin if he hits a century,
it's a politician if he makes 100 crores.

1280
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:50,420
This is present theory of people,
fix yourself for it,

1281
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:52,150
don't ask me about people.

1282
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:56,000
Isn't there anyone here to say
there's problem in my region,

1283
02:29:56,040 --> 02:30:01,260
since it is not being solved,
I'm changing the party?

1284
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,500
Did you see how these leaders are?

1285
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:06,330
People won't get benefits till leaders
like you come into politics?

1286
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:09,510
What's this lousy talk about people
without deciding rates?

1287
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:16,720
Where am I?
- For now, you're here only.

1288
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:18,580
Don't know where will you be
after some time.

1289
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:22,850
How dare you beat him!
We'll walk out in protest!

1290
02:30:25,330 --> 02:30:27,390
He talked about walk out but
got knocked-out!

1291
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,620
Hey, come here.

1292
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:31,200
Come!

1293
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,370
What's your mother's age?
- 70 years!

1294
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:37,160
Why didn't you change her feeling bored?
- How can I change mother?

1295
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:39,540
How can you defect from a party
that's like mother?

1296
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:46,120
So many great people occupied that seat, I don't want a 
criminal like Jeetender on it, so I called you to this meeting.

1297
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:49,580
I've understood nobody in you cares
about people and their welfare.

1298
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:56,220
Your tongues which sing
we are the people, people are we,

1299
02:30:56,590 --> 02:31:00,220
on assuming power,
you change your slogan,

1300
02:31:00,430 --> 02:31:03,400
we're different, people are different,
there are no people at all.

1301
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,230
This will not happen anymore!

1302
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:10,180
You must go to every house to find
their problem and solve it henceforth.

1303
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:13,570
If not take it as your life time
has expired.

1304
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:19,740
You heard him, right?

1305
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,750
At least now let's change, come!

1306
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:31,430
Petrol!

1307
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:18,630
Come!

1308
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:42,050
A wave of fire has leapt...

1309
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:45,620
To wipe out the evil...

1310
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:49,390
The angry man is
 the protective shield...

1311
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:53,470
To save the honest...

1312
02:33:55,100 --> 02:34:10,530
Glory to Lord Narasimha!

1313
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:29,540
Beau...

1314
02:34:37,050 --> 02:34:44,110
That's the end of the evil...
The world is saved...

1315
02:34:44,490 --> 02:34:52,190
That's ends the history of blood...
New dawn of peace ushered in...

1316
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:06,040
Brother! Please don't go away
leaving us!

1317
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:09,140
Be with us always, sir!

1318
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:14,680
Like that great man said,
society is temple and people are Gods.

1319
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:19,550
I believe this principle. I'll be 
with you till my last breath!

1320
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:23,990
If you bow your heads
anyone is your leader.

1321
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:27,120
If you lift head and go against,
any leader would be your servant.

1322
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,000
You're the ones to decide
and winners too!

1323
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:40,610
Where there is truth, victory is there!

1324
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:43,100
I'm with you!

1325
02:35:57,300 --> 02:36:06,220
He is a legend...
