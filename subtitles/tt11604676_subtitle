<i>Fourteen champion players</i>

19
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,000
<i>Come on, clap for them!</i>

20
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,583
The score is 1-1.

21
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,750
President.

22
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,958
Come on, write it in
the police team's name.

23
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,250
Yeah. The second prize, right?

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,625
Do you want to bet?

25
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,875
Let those boys win the cup, man.

26
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,958
Which boys?

27
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,416
Aren't you ashamed
to support Praveen's team?

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,541
Why should I be ashamed?

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,791
He's a policeman.
Ask him to play for the police team.

30
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,583
It's been only two years since
he joined the police force.

31
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,833
He's been playing for Kings
since he was really young.

32
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,166
Okay, stop it. That's enough. Come on.

33
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,250
-How do you feel?
-Better.

34
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,625
Hey, move.

35
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,958
If anyone from our team gets
hurt, we will take care of him.

36
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,666
-You needn't intervene!
-Calm down.

37
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,416
-Move!
-But I didn't see anyone here.

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,791
What are you mumbling?

39
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,458
-What did I do, sir?
-You're not a physiotherapist.

40
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,791
Let it go. Don't mind him.

41
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,916
He's creating a scene for no reason.

42
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,208
Don't bother about him.

43
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,791
<i>Sports lovers,</i>

44
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,708

46
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,333
<i>We need your applause</i>
<i>and cheers for this battle.</i>

47
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,708
<i>On one side, we have</i>
<i>Ernakulam District Police Rural,</i>

48
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,250

well-equipped opponents…

49
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,416
with their brains and brawn,

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,833
and won the cup for the last two years.

51
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,708
And on the other side…

52
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,083
Why did you do that?

53
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:43,625
{\an8}<i>…shocking those who</i>
<i>had written them off,</i>

54

<i>the dark horses of this</i>

55
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:50,208
<i>After the final battle, who will kiss</i>
<i>the cup? Who will embrace the cup?</i>

56
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,750
<i>We will find out in a few minutes.</i>
<i>Come on, clap for them!</i>

57
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,208
<i>A warm welcome to our dear</i>
<i>Superintendent of Police, Mr. Rajendran,</i>

58
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,708
<i>who has come here to hand</i>
<i>over the prizes to the winners.</i>

59
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,000
<i>Will he be able to present</i>
<i>the cup to his own team?</i>

60
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,083
<i>Let's wait and watch!</i>
<i>Keep cheering for the teams!</i>

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,750
{\an8}<i>The playground is full of</i>
<i>excitement and fervor.</i>

62
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,458
{\an8}<i>Fourteen champion players…</i>

Team, ready?

65
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,083
Ready?

66
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,125
Start!

67
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,250
<i>Come on, clap for them.</i>

68
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:36,333
<i>The battleground is about</i>
<i>to witness some tense moments.</i>

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,166
{\an8}<i>Who will cross the centerline first?</i>

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,333
<i>Searching for the answer,</i>
<i>here are Praveen Michael and team!</i>

71
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,583
<i>Come on, clap for them!</i>

72
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:51,583
{\an8}<i>The rope is swaying. With the fervor</i>
<i>of applause from the sports lovers,</i>

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,208
<i>without any intention to lose,</i>
<i>and with the speed of a cheetah,</i>

74
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,875
<i>fourteen champion players</i>
<i>are battling it out.</i>

75
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,750
<i>Praveen Michael and team…</i>

76
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,333
<i>are inching towards victory.</i>

77
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,791
-Pull it!
-<i>Come on, clap for them!</i>

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,750
Pull it!

79
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,833
<i>With the speed of a cheetah</i>
<i>and the precision of a vulture,</i>

80
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,833
both the teams are
building a strong defense.

81
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,333
{\an8}<i>By understanding the opponents' skills…</i>

82
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:23,416
{\an8}<i>and exploiting their weaknesses,</i>
<i>who will march towards victory?</i>

83
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,208
{\an8}<i>Seems like it's going to be Praveen</i>
<i>Michael and team! Clap for them!</i>

84
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,625
{\an8}<i>Will Kings Piravom cross the final</i>
<i>ten feet and emerge victorious?</i>

85
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>Come on, cheer for them!</i>

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,625
<i>With thunderous applause</i>
<i>from their supporters,</i>

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,625
<i>Praveen Michael and team</i>

88
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,833
<i>Clap for them!</i>

89
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,333
{\an8}<i>And Kings Piravom has won the game!</i>

90
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,250
<i>Defeating the mighty Kerala Police…</i>

91
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,541
<i>the dark horses of this</i>
<i>year, Kings Piravom!</i>

92
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,083
<i>Kings Piravom!</i>

93
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,291
<i>Clap for them!</i>

94
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,041
<i>They've offered a memorable</i>
<i>game for the audience out here.</i>

95
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,541
<i>A battle that has rewritten history.</i>

96
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,416
<i>This amazing performance</i>
<i>was displayed by…</i>

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,916
<i>Kings Piravom!</i>

98
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,333
Around 68 champion teams…

99
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,375
from 14 districts had
participated in this competition

100
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:24,500
conducted by the Areekkara Club,
Areekkara.

101
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,958
Defeating those 67 teams,

102
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,125
the warriors of Kings Piravom
have won the first prize.

103
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,833
And they have become the champions
of this competition.

104
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,500
Mr. Praveen!

105
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,208
You know the drill.
I don't have to explain, do I?

106
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,541
It's a postal vote.
Here's your mother's election slip.

107
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,333
I know you'll vote for us,
but I'm just reminding you again.

108
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,958
Just give us the postal ballot.
We'll do it.

109
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,083
I haven't got it yet.

110
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,458
-Oh.
-How is your mother doing?

111
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,791
She's fine. She's resting inside.

112
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,583
Do you need a car to bring your
mother to vote on election day?

113
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,125
-No, I'll manage. Thanks.
-Okay, then.

114
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,958
Bye.

115
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,666
Hey, Praveen!

116
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,208
Why aren't you dressed yet?

117
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,541
How can you be so lazy when you
have to go meet a prospective bride?

118
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,666
I have had enough of it.

119
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,291
You're getting late!

120
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,291
Go and get ready!
I'll do the rest!

121
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,458
-I--
-Go!

122
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,416
I'm going!

123
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,875
Auntie, look!

124
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,416
She posted this photo yesterday.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,166
And this one, in the morning.

126
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,916
Look. She posted this one
just five minutes back.

127
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,291
-She is having a blast there.
-Dad, look at this.

128
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,125
Why does he have to get
depressed thinking about her?

129
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,458
What can I do, dear?

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,625
-He doesn't listen to me.
-Dad, hold this.

131
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,000
Hey! Come here!

132
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,333
What are you doing?

133
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,250
-Hey--
-Please don't play with it!

134
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,291
I can barely handle your
dad playing with it!

135
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,708
-Come here.
-Why are you scolding the child?

136
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,000
Our husbands won't come home
until we marry off Praveen.

137
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,583
That's why I'm taking all this trouble.

138
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,750
-Hey, see you at the club in the evening.
-Okay.

139
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,750
Are you going to meet
the girl dressed like this?

140
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,708
Praveen! Hey!

141
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
Where are you going now?

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,625
They are waiting for you!

143
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,708
DySP has summoned me.

144
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,666
I'll lose my job if I don't go.

145
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,000
Ask them if they'd get their
daughter married to a jobless guy.

146
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,791
If they are okay with that,

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,916
then it's alright.

148
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, dude.

149
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,375
I'd told you, right?

150
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,666
How are we supposed to go
to that girl's house now?

151
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,000
Enough.

152
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:19,916
Prepare tea for me.

153
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,250
Which doctor are you consulting now?

154
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,333
How did you land up in front of the SP

155
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,375
when you were on medical
leave for your back pain?

156
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,458
He gave us the trophy yesterday.

157
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,708
Do you know what he said to me?

158
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,375
He asked me to refer you to the
medical board and get you fired.

159
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,583
I have gotten you exempted from that.

160
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,666
For your father's sake.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,250
Your local station duty is due, right?

162
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,375
Go get your passport from
the camp and join there.

163
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,916
Can you operate a computer?

164
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,333
-No, sir.
-No one admits it even if they can.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,583
We've exhausted the
additional quota for diesel.

166
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,583
If we've caught some tipper motortruck
without a pass, get them to fill it.

167
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,458
He's new. Tell him about his duties.

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,583
Okay, sir.

169
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,666
-Sir, will you be going out?
-No.

170
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,875
Then, may I take the jeep?

171
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,166
I've got information about an LP
case accused. I'll go and check.

172
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,083
The driver is out on
permission until noon.

173
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,791
Do you at least know how to drive?

174
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,375
Yes, sir. I have the authorization.

175
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,458
Charge a couple of suo motu
cases on the way.

176
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,416
Okay, sir.

177
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,083
Who all are there in your family?

178
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,916
Just my mother.

179
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,375
You might have known my father, sir.
He was an ASI.

180
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,791
He died eight years ago in an accident
while he was posted at Ramapuram Station.

181
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,458
Oh, yes! Mr. R. K. Michael!

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,875
Oh! You are Mr. R. K. Michael's son!

183
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,916
His initials were not R. K.
but his last name was Michael. Yes.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
Yes, right!

185
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,791
He had a paunch, a bald head…

186
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,500
and eyes that almost popped out.

187
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,708
His eyes were full of rage.

188
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,416
Mr. Michael!

189
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
We used to call him "R. K."

190
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,875
Your father was the one who trained us.

191
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,416
-Time flies so quickly, right?
<i>-33 mobile, respond!</i>

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,083
33 mobile answering.

193
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,125
Location, Panambukad!

194
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,833
Remember, you have to pay
attention to this set.

195
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,500
Stop here.

196
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,375
You can go.

197
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,458
Don't go alone, sir. I'll come with you.

198
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,208
I haven't come here to catch a culprit.

199
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,833
I forgot my bike here
last night as I was drunk.

200
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,958
Don't tell this to anyone.

201
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,708
Get going. I'll see you later.

202
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,250
Okay, sir.

203
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,500
Stop!

204
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,958
<i>Please register your valuable</i>
<i>votes for Betty Jose here.</i>

205
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,875
Mom!

206
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,708
I'm okay. I just got into the car.

207
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,666
I'm coming to the station.

208
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,833
If you want to file a complaint, you'll--

209
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,583
No, sir. I'm a policewoman.

210
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,208
You're late today, Sunitha.

211
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,333
Namaste, sir. I was on outdoor duty today.

212
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,791
She's our girl.

213
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,250
See you at the station.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Ask them to come to the station.

215
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,625
I'll give them the money.

216
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,916
And ask the workers to keep
the cement sacks covered.

217
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,375
I had sent it.

218
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,125
Got it?

219
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,208
Okay.

220
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,625
-Mom, I've arrived at the station.
-Plant those properly.

221
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,333
See if you can get
some cow dung for this.

222
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,250
Apply cow dung all around it
once you finish planting them.

223
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,208
Yes, sir.

224
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,708
Hey!

225
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,291
This isn't the police camp.

226
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,750
You don't have to salute
me every time you see me.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,875
Sir!

228
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,583
Sir, the writer is calling you.

229
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,500
Newcomers have to give
the seniors a treat.

230
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,916
Next Friday, the breakfast
after the parade will be on you.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
-Okay. We'll make it grand.
-Platoon, attention!

232
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,958
Platoon, stand at ease!

233
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,041
Father, has your assault
case been compromised?

234
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,833
Don't hit people so roughly or
else, they'd die.

235
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,625
-What grade are you studying in?
-Eleventh.

236
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,250
Does your family know about this?

237
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,750
-What's your name?
-Albert.

238
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,291
How can you trust guys like him?

239
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,041
You're not even an adult yet.

240
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,458
-Where does your dad work?
-He works abroad.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,541
What were you both doing in the car?

242
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,541
Do your parents spend money
on your education for this?

243
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,625
Look at her face!

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,833
What happened?

245
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,500
She was roaming around with
this guy during her free period.

246
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,083
One of the members informed me.

247
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,208
-What's your name?
-Albert.

248
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,750
-Where do you stay?
-Pala.

249
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,250
-Louder!
-Pala!

250
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
-Is there any case in your name?
-No, sir.

251
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,666
What's your name?

252
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,000
Krishnapriya.

253
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,625
Inform their families.

254
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,791
-Give me your parents' number.
-It's 97…

255
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,625
-97?
-466…

256
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,750
I will be late.

257
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,541
Go to the clinic, Mom.

258
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll join you there.

259
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,791
<i>The number you're calling…</i>

260
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,791
Mr. Maniyan… we're collecting
money for Mr. Babu's son's wedding.

261
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,208
The Director General has
issued a new order…

262
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,583
that says we should go on
a trip to reduce our stress.

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,083
They won't make us do yoga, right?

264
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,708
I hope we get the day off.

265
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,500
Maniyan, DySP has said that no one can go
home until the pending files are closed.

266
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,125
If you have too many of
those, you're doomed!

267
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,458
Get lost, you idiot!

268
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,666
What is this?

269
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,916
POLICE

270
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,708
Take that girl to the women's cell.

271
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,708
Get away from her!

272
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:25,916
Step aside, girl.

273
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,750
If you're on driver duty,
you should be near the car.

274
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,041
I had gone to the toilet, sir.

275
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,208
Is this the time to shit?

276
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,291
Stop near that black gate.

277
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,500
What are you doing? Only three
days are left for the competition.

278
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,708
Is this how you're going to dance?
Show it to her.

279
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
Do you remember the first step?

280
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,625
One…

281
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,958
She must win this time.
I have spent a lot of money.

282
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,375
I can get her three A grades.

283
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,375
But the first, second, and third
prizes are decided by the judges.

284
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
You're a cop.
Come on, use your influence.

285
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,833
Start from where you went wrong.

286
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,458
I don't think it's possible.

287
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,000
-Where is your phone?
-I am leaving.

288
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,541
-I've been calling you for so long.
-It must be lying there somewhere.

289
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,333
I must know my daughter's whereabouts!

290
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,500
I'd told you yesterday that she has
a holiday today. You must have forgotten.

291
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,625
Haven't I told you not to leave
her alone with her teacher?

292
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,458
You don't know the kinds of things
that are happening out there.

293
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
Half your problems would be solved
if you get rid of this uniform.

294
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,625
Do you want some?

295
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,625
How many times do I have to tell you?
Raise your elbow!

296
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,541
Praveen!

297
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,000
Come here!

298
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,500
It's okay. I'll wait here.

299
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,791
Come. Have some jackfruit.

300
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,500
She's won all these prizes.
This one at the district level.

301
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,291
This one is for the <i>Atham</i> competition.

302
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,958
It's the State Youth Festival
day after tomorrow. Have a seat.

303
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,625
She's competing in three categories.

304
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,333
Story narration, folk
dance, and monodrama.

305
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,666
She will win this time.

306
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,125
The election's also around the corner.

307
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,416
If my leave is not sanctioned,
I'll take medical leave.

308
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,458
Hey!

309
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,458
Come here.

310
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,750
This is our artist.

311
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,833
Perform your monodrama for Uncle.

312
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,041
-Now?
-Yes.

313
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,083
"Grandma!

314
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,500
Grandma!

315
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,541
Why do we have to sell our
ancestral house, temple, and farms

316
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,500
to buy a new apartment?

317
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:21,250
Grandma, can't you tell my
father not to sell all this?"

318
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,666
"Oh! My dear!

319
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,625
My children don't obey me anymore.

320
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,416
-On the contrary,
-Hello, sir!

321
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,166
-I have to obey all of you.
-I'll be there right away.

322
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,166
I'm left with no other option.
I can't advise…"

323
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,625
<i>33 mobile, please respond.</i>

324
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,916

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,291
We're waiting at the boundary.

326
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,625
<i>It's clear.</i>

327
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,083
Roger.

328
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,625
Sir, mic one will be here soon.
Get in quickly.

329
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,583
Hey! Don't assign me any
duties for the next two days!

330
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:55,958
Got it?

331
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,000
I have to attend
the association's meeting.

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,291
If the government falls
after this by-election,

333
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,791
it'll be a hell lot of work for us.

334
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
It won't fall, sir.

335
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,791
The Chief Minister is
running the campaign, right?

336
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,416
Too bad that the CM didn't
give a seat to Joshy Mathew.

337
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,791
He was always with him
working really hard.

338
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,541
How can the CM take any risk
when the seats are at 69-70?

339
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,458
Instead, if he gives that chance
to a dead person's daughter,

340
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,750
he will get sympathy!

341
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,250
Praveen, yours is a postal vote, right?

342
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,250
Praveen, last time when
he went with my ballot,

343
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,875
he promised to get me
transferred to vigilance.

344
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
I'm having a great time
in vigilance now, aren't I?

345
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:50,166
<i>Don't forget the name,</i>
<i>Advocate G. Raveendranath.</i>

346
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,416
Why did you go to their house at night?

347
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,041
It was her birthday, sir.

348
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,916
I'd gone to give her a gift.

349
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,583
You could've done that during the day.

350
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm sorry, sir.

351
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,250
Praveen.

352
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,375
What's the issue, sir?

353
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,250
We've got an order from the authorities
to kill that boy we met at the station.

354
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,208
He'd gone to his girlfriend's house
last night to give her a gift.

355
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,583
And that girl is related to a minister.

356
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,500
I've been asked to book him
with a non-bailable offense.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,541
Even goons have the freedom
to accept or reject such orders…

358
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,666
but we don't.

359
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,625
-I just talked to your superintendent.
-Oh.

360
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,958
First room from here.

361
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,333
Let the bottle remain here.

362
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,541
<i>John M. Thomas, son of Thomas,</i>
<i>of Palaykkal House…</i>

363
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,375
<i>situated in Piravom of Arakkunnam village</i>

364
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,375
<i>has given this statement</i>
<i>on 19th November 2019</i>

365
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,208
<i>to Maniyan KP of Piravom Police Station.</i>

366
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>"As part of a property dispute,</i>

367
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,708
<i>22-year-old Arun, son of Shekharan,</i>
<i>of Attumangalath House,</i>

368
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,416

369
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,000
<i>Last night, i.e.</i>
<i>on the night of 18th November 2019,</i>

370
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,500
<i>after all of us went to sleep,</i>

371
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,791
<i>he broke into our house…</i>

372
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,125
<i>poured petrol all over</i>

373
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,791
<i>Had we not extinguished the fire quickly,</i>
<i>we would have been dead by now.</i>

374
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,833
<i>He's still sending us such death threats,</i>

375
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,458
<i>so I humbly request you to take</i>
<i>strict actions against him."</i>

376
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,166
<i>I have read the statement and signed it.</i>

377
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,750
Okay.

378
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,333
Your mother is inside.

379
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,000
Her creatinine level has increased
quite a bit. I think it's because…

380
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,250
she has been taking medicines
for arthritis for years.

381
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,583
I'll give a reference letter to
a nephrologist at Amritha Hospital.

382
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,208
I have also booked an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.

383
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,250
You must go there without fail and
start the treatment immediately.

384
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,916
-She has suffered so much.
-You should make her understand.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,583
She's coming. Talk to her directly.

386
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:16,791
Okay, then.

387
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,791
-Bye.
-Bye.

388
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,958
They're here to talk about Biju.

389
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,125
Go inside, Mom.

390
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,708
What is it, brother?

391
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,125
Why did you report this
at the station, dear?

392
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,416
What other option did I have?

393
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,125
You're doing all this
because I am helpless, right?

394
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,416
I'm struggling so much to complete
the construction of this house.

395
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,583
Please don't trouble me.

396
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,041
You know how he is, right?

397
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,291
He's crazy. Later don't say
that we didn't warn you.

398
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,500
I'll handle it, brother.

399
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:51,958
Go inside, Mom!

400
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,416
I've told you not to talk to
these people unnecessarily.

401
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,708
Don't worry about that, sir.

402
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,625
She liked it, right? Then, buy that one.

403
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,583
Don't worry about the price.

404
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,791
We can do that.

405
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,458
Yes.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,875
Okay.

407
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,875
Yes.

408
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:16,916
-Sir!
-Wait a second.

409
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,625
The CI has asked us to issue
a memo to latecomers.

410
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,333
There'd been an accident in front of
the hospital and he's really angry.

411
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,291
Go quickly.

412
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,416
-I was going to ask him for leave.
-Go. You'll get it right away.

413
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,666
Yes, sir.

414
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:30,833
Okay, then.

415
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,625
Don't look at them, Mom!

416
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,791
You should go home, Mom.
There are workers at home, right?

417
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,041
-I will talk to the CI. Don't worry.
-Okay.

418
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,000
Go.

419
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,166
Yeah, I'll be there.

420
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,125
Hey!

421
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,583
How dare you spit on that wall!

422
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,000
This is a police station!

423
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,458
Why are you getting angry, sir?

424
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,000
-Let it go, sir.
-Should I wipe it?

425
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,458
-Wipe it.
-Alright.

426
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,500
Just wipe it!

427
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,583
-You're messing with me?
-Sir! Leave it, sir!

428
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,208
-Let it go, sir.
-Come, sir.

429
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,791
Don't you dare leave without wiping it!

430
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,625
-Let it go, sir.
-Just wipe it.

431
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,458
-I'll make him do it, sir.
-Come, sir.

432
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,833
-Wipe it!
-Come, sir.

433
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,458
-Wipe it!
-I'll make him do it.

434
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,375
-I'll make him wipe it.
-You won't leave without wiping it!

435
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,583
Let it go, sir.

436
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,625
-Come, sir.
-Move!

437
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,750
Please, sir.

438
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,708
-You won't leave without wiping it!
-I will do it.

439
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,375
I will do it. Please, sir.

440
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,541
What happened, sir?

441
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,250
He's my relative, sir.
He keeps harassing me.

442
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,541
I'd asked the Circle
Inspector to talk to him.

443
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,458
Tomorrow onward,
all those who are on traffic duty

444
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,000
must get to the duty point on time!

445
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,458
Or else I'll get you all fired!

446
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm the one who has to suffer
because of your damn mistakes!

447
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,666
-Where are you going?
-Hello!

448
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,458
-You'll be called.
-I said I can't do it!

449
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,875
-What?
-I need leave for three days.

450
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,125
It's the election.
I can't grant you leave.

451
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,333
I have to take my mother
to the hospital tomorrow.

452
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,541
All the ministers are holding conventions
here from today, including the CM.

453
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,000
I need to provide force for all that
and you want me to grant you leave!

454
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,166
Sir, there's no one else
at home to take her there.

455
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,041
Don't trouble me now! Get lost, idiot!

456
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,958
If you can't grant me leave, say that.

457
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,291
You don't have to abuse me.

458
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,125
Anyway, it's urgent.

459
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,750
-So, I'll take medical leave.
-I'll see how you take medical leave!

460
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,708
I'll get you fired!

461
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:39,791
Get lost!

462
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,166
Sir, give me that phone.

463
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,583
Bow down and get it.

464
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,958
We don't bow down anymore, sir.
It's a thing of the past.

465
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,583
You won't leave until I get my phone.

466
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,000
What is this, sir?

467
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,958
-Let him go, sir.
-I'll punch your face, you idiot!

468
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,000
If you touch me, you'll lose your job!

469
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,083
-What about me?
-Stop it!

470
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,000
You…

471
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,083
come here! I'll not spare you!

472
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,541
-Lock him inside!
-Let go of me!

473
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,666
Let go of him!

474
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,625
Let go of him, sir!
You'll have to pay for it!

475
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,458
Let go of him!

476
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,000
-Move!
-We won't spare you!

477
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,958
-What's happening here?
-Sir, he hit me! He's drunk as well!

478
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,583
Take him for a medical checkup
and book him under PDPP!

479
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,625
Where's the paper?

480
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,666
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!

481
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,666
-If you hurt our boy,
-If you hurt our boy,

482
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,791
we will barge into your
house and kill you!

483
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,958
-Scram, all of you!
-Hey!

484
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,625
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Move the gun away!

485
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,583
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!

486
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,625
What's your name?

487
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,208
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!

488
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,416
I'll fill in the details, sir.

489
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,666
Getting back at me, are you?

490
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,500
He'll learn once he goes
to jail for six months.

491
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,750
Why wait for six months, sir?

492
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,333
Let's settle this right here! Come!

493
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,875
Let's do it!

494
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,041
Please get here quickly, brother!

495
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,166
Biju is getting beaten
up at the police station!

496
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,958
But I wasn't the one who started it.

497
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,458
Whatever it is, the situation
in here has become chaotic now.

498
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,208
What have you done, sir?

499
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:06,125
If you were the GD,
would you have let this happen?

500
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,791
If the public comes to know about
this, I'll lose my job!

501
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,083
The CI said he'll charge a case!
What's your problem?

502
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,791
You arrested that guy just based
on Sunitha's oral complaint!

503
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,625
What else was I supposed to do?
Quietly let him hit our officer?

504
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,416
Chacko, release him!

505
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,958
Sir!

506
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,625
Sir, he's drunk and we have beaten him.

507
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:29,916
If we release him without a medical
checkup, we'll be in trouble.

508
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,750
What can I do?
The SP asked me to release him!

509
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:35,458
He's saying that it's a caste vote issue
or some damn thing like that!

510
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,333
Why did I have to quit
my job at the school!

511
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,166
Hey! You are free to go.

512
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,291
What did Rameshettan say?

513
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,375
Let him come first.
We'll decide after that.

514
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:02,250
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!

515
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,208
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!

516
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,375
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!

517
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,333
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!

518
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:17,625
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!

519
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,541
Okay.

520
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,541
Let me see if something can be done.

521
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,250
I'll try to figure something out.

522
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,166
Okay.

523
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,791
Okay, thanks.

524
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,166
I'll call you later. Bye.

525
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,791
They've got themselves
admitted to a hospital.

526
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,666
I hope they don't gather people
and start a police station siege.

527
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,208
He has joined just now.

528
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,208
But you've been in service for 20 years,
right? Can't you show some maturity?

529
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,750
-Apologize to them and sort it out!
-It wasn't a deliberate action, sir.

530
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,083
Our biggest problem is that we
released him without a medical checkup.

531
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,041
That's true.

532
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,541
If we lose our jobs because of
this, no one will help us.

533
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,125
I have talked to Mr. Mathew.
It'll be taken care of, sir.

534
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,291
He is your relative, right?

535
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,375
Capitalize on that.

536
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,250
Let's go.

537
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:17,500
<i>Vote for Betty Jose!</i>

538
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,208
Yeah.

539
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,208
I'll be there after attending
the program in Attingal.

540
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,333
We'll decide once I am back.

541
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,291
Yeah.

542
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,916
-Switch off your phone.
-Yeah.

543
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,916
I already told you, right?

544
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,791
That's enough!

545
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,416
As far as I know,

546
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,250
this election is very crucial.

547
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,916
Ask your boys not to host a protest
march or a police station siege for this.

548
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,583
But the boys have taken
this issue very seriously.

549
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,708
So?

550
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,125
Well, in the current situation…

551
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,833
we should promise something good for
our community just to pacify them.

552
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,000
That engineering college in Attachira…

553
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,375
we've been asking for it
for so many years, sir.

554
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,625
If you could do something…

555
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,000
then I would think about
it after the election.

556
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,000
Alright.

557
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,166
I trust you, sir.

558
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,291
And sir…

559
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:22,958
once the election is over,

560
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:26,166
please get those troublesome
police officers suspended.

561
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:28,958
Bye, sir.

562
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,875
I am here at the hospital.

563
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,041
No, it's alright. I'll deal with it, sir.

564
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,125
I'll call you later. Bye.

565
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,833
Sir is here.

566
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,833
-What is it?
-This is the video I shot.

567
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,625
Send it to me.

568
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,041
This shouldn't be leaked at any cost.

569
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,291
Once the police record your statements
tomorrow, all of you leave from here.

570
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,333
-Got it?
-Okay.

571
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,708
I just met the Chief Minister.

572
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,291
If we don't create any problem

573
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,833
until the election is over,
we'll get the college and the land.

574
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,291
We don't need the college
or any damn thing!

575
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,208
Hey!

576
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,375
-Keep quiet.
-What?

577
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,791
Don't create a scene here!

578
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,708
When I was beaten like a dog at
the police station, no one did anything!

579
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,250
I will get back at all of them!

580
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,458
The association won't be responsible
for your drunk or stoned debauchery!

581
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,875
-He's just agitated--
-Got it?

582
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,875
-Let it go, man.
-Let it go.

583
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,250
Hey, we'll go together to the wedding.

584
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,541
I'm not coming, sir.

585
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,458
Fine.

586
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,125
Bye. See you tomorrow.

587
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,000
Are you still thinking
about that incident?

588
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,333
Cops who do their job honestly
always end up getting in trouble.

589
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,125
Others are awarded the Good Service Entry.

590
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,750
I have talked to Mr. Mathew.

591
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:45,541
He will sort it out.

592
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,208
You don't need to worry.

593
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:48,958
But sir, I'm not invited.

594
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:51,958
What?

595
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,083
There's only one invitation
for the entire police station.

596
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,500
You don't know who it is, right?

597
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,583
It's Mr. Babu.

598
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,125
He used to be very close to your dad.

599
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,625
He'll be very happy to see you.

600
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,333
Let's go have a couple of drinks. Come.

601
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,750
You don't need to drive today.

602
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:04,916
Come!

603
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:18,041
<i>The story of an octopus</i>

604
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,000
<i>Slashed by the knife of envy</i>

605
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,791
<i>It turns like toddy</i>

606
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,750
-It seems like a grand function.
<i>-Hey, you eight-legged…</i>

607
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,041
Come, let's have food.

608
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,500
No, I have to call the travel agents.

609
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,416
Don't worry about the ticket. Come.

610
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,250
No, I have to call my
friends before I leave.

611
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,458
Okay, come once you're done.

612
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,583
He's going to the Middle East tomorrow.

613
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,291
-Where in the Middle East?
-Saudi Arabia.

614
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,333
By the way, I don't drive after drinking.

615
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,208
-He'll drive then.
<i>-His wife stole the sweet toddy</i>

616
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,833
<i>And the backwaters turned red</i>

617
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:49,000
<i>-Hey, you eight-legged drunk octopus</i>
-We're leaving. I've got the pilot duty.

618
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,375
Drop Sunitha off at the
station when you leave.

619
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,041
-Okay, sir.
-She's having food.

620
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,250
Hey!

621
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,791
Take your mother to the hospital
and get back to work at night.

622
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,708
Thank you, sir.

623
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,625
This is Mr. R. K. Michael's son.

624
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,708
I used to visit your
house when you were young.

625
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,875
Nice to meet you.

626
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:16,541
<i>While climbing up the coconut palm</i>

627
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:21,875
<i>The knife glitters</i>
<i>And his wife grins in his dreams</i>

628
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,166
Come on! Have a drink!

629
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,625
<i>He doesn't give two hoots about her</i>

630
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,916
<i>He chops her into pieces</i>

631
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,291
<i>Until the knife's sharpness wanes</i>

632
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,125
<i>-Oh, my dear octopus</i>
<i>-Oh, my dear octopus</i>

633
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,208
<i>-Watch your step, you're drunk</i>
<i>-Watch your step, you're drunk</i>

634
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,958
Sunitha… we'll go together!

635
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,000
<i>-Drink up!</i>
<i>-Laugh all you want!</i>

636
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,666
<i>-Until you have an upset stomach</i>
<i>-And your head spins</i>

637
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,583
<i>-Pour yourself…</i>
<i>-A lot of toddies</i>

638
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,625
<i>-A jar full of toddy</i>
<i>-My dearest</i>

639
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:12,333
<i>The toddy of moonshine</i>

640
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:19,208
<i>The knife glitters</i>
<i>And his wife grins in his dreams</i>

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,791
<i>The way he chopped her into pieces</i>

642
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>May I chop you into pieces?</i>

643
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,708
<i>-Crawling</i>
<i>-Slipping and swaying</i>

644
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,458
<i>-Along the pavement</i>
<i>-Before the idol</i>

645
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,250
<i>-Throw up</i>
<i>-If you want to</i>

646
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,500
<i>-Drink up!</i>
<i>-The sour buttermilk</i>

647
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:57,041

<i>Hey, you eight-legged drunk octopus</i>

649
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:08,125
<i>You, who stole the toddy of the moonshine</i>

<i>-Hey, do you know?</i>
<i>-Hey, do you know?</i>

651
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,791
<i>Once he chopped her into pieces</i>
<i>Using his knife</i>

<i>The knife glitters</i>
<i>And his wife grins in his dreams</i>

655
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,583
Get me one more drink.

656
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,708
It was Mr. Babu's longtime
wish to get his son married.

657
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,916
When he was in service,
he used to talk only about that.

658
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,875
Today, his wish finally came true.

659
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,666
Sunitha…

660
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,458
you should also get married as
soon as your house is built.

661
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,625
Don't delay it.

662
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,625
And you as well.

663
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,583
I'll get married after
I get back from the Middle East.

664
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:00,500
What?

665
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,541
I'll get married only after
I'm back from the Middle East.

666
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:03,958
I wasn't talking to you.

667
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,291
I meant you, Praveen.

668
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,416
Don't grow old like this.

669
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,833
-You heard me, right?
-Yes.

670
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,500
Your mother will be really happy.

671
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,666
Even you should have a family.

672
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,291
You still have a lot of time, boy!

673
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,708
We'd have a grand wedding
once you get back from there.

674
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,125
There's nothing like
having our own family.

675
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,250
Hey! Stop near that ATM!

676
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,041
Withdraw Rs. 20,000 and keep it with you.

677
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,041
-There's no need, Uncle.
-Come on!

678
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,541
You have to buy the ticket, right?

679
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,083
It's a gift from me! Take it!

680
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,208
The pin is 5858.

681
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,500
Go.

682
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,541
I couldn't refuse when he compelled me.

683
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,041
Yeah… I'll be there in half an hour.

684
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,875
Okay. I'll call you later. Bye.

685
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,708
When are you leaving?

686
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,875
I've got the visa.

687
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,250
If I pay the money tomorrow,

688
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,208
I can vote on Saturday
and fly after that.

689
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,250
Yeah, go! There's no point
in staying here anyway!

690
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,291
Hey!

691
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,916
Sir!

692
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,166
-He is alive.
-Hey!

693
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,666
-Hey!
-Hey!

694
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,083
-Hey!
-Hey!

695
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,166
Sir, this is Jayan.

696
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,583
Which Jayan?

697
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,250
Biju, who caused a commotion at
the station, it's his friend.

698
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,083
Praveen, let's go.

699
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,416
-This will get us in trouble! Come!
-Sir, he's alive!

700
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,166
-Lift him, sir!
-Come on!

701
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,125
Lift him!

702
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,875
Dude, it's Maniyan! Let's go!

703
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:25,833
We'll get in trouble!

704
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,708
Lift him!

705
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,250
Open it. Quickly.

706
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,083
Open it! Hey, come and help us!

707
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,708
He is throwing up.

708
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,916
Hey!

709
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,625
Praveen, start the car.

710
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,583
Sir.

711
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,500
Hold him.

712
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,125
Suresh, get the stretcher!

713
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,208
-Hold him.
-Hey!

714
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,833
Come on.

715
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,541
Is it an accident case?

716
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,458
Yes.

717
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,291
-Sister, connect the monitor.
-Yes, doctor.

718
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,625
It was our car.

719
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,958
When did this happen?

720
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,125
About half an hour back.

721
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,375
Have you boozed?

722
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,125
I have to inform the police.
It's a medicolegal case.

723
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,875
We're the local police officers.

724
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,333
We've informed our station.

725
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,083
You can inform his relatives then.

726
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,375
The patient was brought dead.

727
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,458
What is this?

728
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,708
What happened? What is this, doctor?

729
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:48,791
Hey, Biju!

730
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,916
Come here quickly!

731
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,125
It's Jayan! Those idiots dumped him here!

732
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,958
Run quickly!

733
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,791
Catch them!

734
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,583
Open the door!

735
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,791
Sujith, go through the other side!
Quickly!

736
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,291
Hello! Sir, it's me, Praveen!

737
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,666
<i>-What is it?</i>
-We--

738
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,750
There is one problem.

739
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,000
Are you at the station?

740
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:51,958
We're coming there.

741
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,458
<i>-Yes, I am at the station.</i>
-Okay.

742
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,666
<i>-Get here quickly.</i>
-Okay, sir.

743
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:03,875
Is she asleep?

744
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,625
I'll be there in half an hour.

745
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:10,208
Sir, he was alive when
we took him to the car.

746
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,000
I get that… but would
anyone else believe you?

747
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,458
Moreover, you had consumed alcohol.

748
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,875
Sir, my nephew was driving.

749
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:17,875
He hadn't boozed.

750
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,000
Where is he then?

751
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,250
No one has seen him.

752
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:23,416
Even if we charge a case against him,
people will say that we fabricated it.

753
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,125
Don't worry.

754
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,375
We'll figure something out.

755
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,541
Sir!

756
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,416
All three of them are here, sir.

757
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,041
None of them were driving, sir.

758
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,458
Sir.

759
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,250
-Hello?
<i>-Mr. Maniyan.</i>

760
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,833
<i>This is Joshy Mathew.</i>

761
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,458
<i>Leave from there immediately.</i>

762
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,166
<i>The Chief Minister…</i>

763
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,000
What is it, sir?

764
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:10,750
<i>Hello?</i>

765
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>Mr. Maniyan, this is Joshy Mathew.</i>

766
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,875
<i>Leave from there immediately.</i>

767
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,833
<i>The CM has asked the superintendent</i>
<i>to charge a case against you all.</i>

768
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,625
DALIT YOUTH DIES IN A CAR ACCIDENT

769
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,708
THE CAR WAS DRIVEN BY
DRUNK POLICE OFFICERS

770
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,333
Maniyan, do you have a cigarette?

771
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,375
-Don't you want to light it?
-Yes.

772
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:15,833
-Sir!
-Come here!

773
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,708
Sir, what are you doing?

774
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,666
Come on!

775
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:19,875
-Come!
-Sir!

776
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:20,958
Come here quickly!

777
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,500
-Let go of me!
-Don't do this, sir! Let go of him!

778
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,000
Close it.

779
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,250
-Start the car!
-Sir, come here quickly!

780
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,250
Maniyan!

781
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:33,250
Hey!

782
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,041
Maniyan, stop!

783
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,916
-Sir!
-What happened?

784
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,375
They have escaped, sir!

785
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,250
<i>The number you're calling</i>
<i>is either switched off or--</i>

786
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,333
Who is it?

787
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:56,416
It's uncle, Mom.

788
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Get me some water.

789
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,375
I'll make tea for you.

790
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:00,916
-Who is it?
-It's me.

791
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,166
I was in this area for work.

792
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,750
Is your daughter's
dance competition over?

793
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:06,791
It's tomorrow.

794
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,000
It's in Thrissur, right?

795
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,416
Yes.

796
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:12,916
Where is Rahul?

797
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,208
He'd gone out with you, right?

798
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,333
He came back after that,
took his bag, and left.

799
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,458
What happened?

800
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:22,375
What is it?

801
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,083
Is there a problem?

802
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,666
What is it?

803
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,000
<i>The number you're calling is either</i>
<i>switched off or not reachable.</i>

804
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,041
What happened, sir?

805
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:41,875
<i>The number you're calling is either</i>
<i>switched off or not reachable.</i>

806
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,583
<i>Please try again later.</i>

807
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,958
Start the car!

808
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,750
<i>The number you're calling</i>
<i>is either switched off or…</i>

809
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,833
<i>The number you're calling</i>
<i>is either switched off or--</i>

810
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,333
Sir!

811
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,333
Where are we going, sir?

812
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:24,083
<i>The number you're calling is either--</i>

813
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,333
If we don't find Rahul,
we'll get trapped, sir.

814
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:31,458
He's not at home and his phone is
switched off! What should I do?

815
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:34,166
Even if we find him, what if he
doesn't admit that he was driving?

816
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,458
Can't we tell the superintendent
that he was driving?

817
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,791
Yeah, right! Go, tell him that!

818
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:42,916
You'll learn your lesson
when you're remanded!

819
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:48,208
But sir, how can they book
us without any evidence?

820
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,291
Just shut up!

821
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,166
We're in this mess because of you!

822
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,541
This is not the time to play
the blame game, sir.

823
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,791
What's wrong with what I said?
What do you even know?

824
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,375
What are you going to do then?

825
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,375
Nonsense!

826
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,833
I've been doing this
for about 20 years now.

827
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,708
Let me tell you what's
going to happen now!

828
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,541
An accused was harassed at
the police station for a personal grudge

829
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,958
upon a policewoman's complaint!

830
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:20,166
All of this was filmed by a person
whom we killed in a car accident.

831
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,708
Then we took him to the hospital
to frame it as an accidental death.

832
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,125
Isn't this enough for them
to book us for a homicide?

833
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,333
Sir, we are police officers.
Why would we be held as the culprits?

834
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,458
Police, my foot!

835
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:32,250
The guy who died was a Dalit, like me.

836
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:33,958
The by-election is
just around the corner.

837
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,125
This government can win only
if they get those votes.

838
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,750
So, they will definitely
declare us as the culprits.

839
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,208
Got it?

840
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,750
Please drop me off at home, sir.

841
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,583
We need to get away from here
until the election is over.

842
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:50,375
And we should disprove the case
framed against us at the High Court

843
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,875
with the evidence we have with us.

844
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,791
We'll only be acquitted if
the CBI investigates this case.

845
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,458
I want to go home, sir.

846
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,583
Yeah, alright!

847
00:47:58,666 --> 00:47:59,708
Drop her off at home!

848
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,125
What? Start the car!

849
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,000
Hey!

850
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,041
-Hey, stop!
-Sir!

851
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,041
Sir!

852
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:01,916
Get in!

853
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,833
Get the car!

854
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,208
Quickly!

855
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,875
Hey! Everything's alright!

856
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,458
No! I am fine!

857
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,583
There has been a small problem!

858
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,416
I'll solve it and come home!
Go to sleep, okay?

859
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:30,541
No!

860
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,833
Don't cry! You'll scare our child!

861
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,041
Hang up!

862
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:37,500
<i>Three police officers, ASI Maniyan KP,</i>
<i>WCPO Sunitha Krishnan,</i>

863
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:41,166
<i>and CPO Praveen Michael, who are</i>
<i>the culprits in a murder case…</i>

864
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,083
<i>have escaped in a mobile unit</i>
<i>vehicle from the Piravom Station.</i>

865
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,333
<i>It's a white Bolero.</i>
<i>Its number is KL01AQ1233.</i>

866
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,125
<i>There's a special</i>
<i>instruction from Tiger…</i>

867
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,083
<i>to take this vehicle and the culprits</i>
<i>into custody immediately.</i>

868
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:54,916
<i>Note the names of the culprits once again.</i>

869
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,708
<i>ASI Maniyan KP, WCPO Sunitha Krishnan,</i>
<i>and CPO Praveen Michael.</i>

870
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,458
<i>If you feel this message is not</i>
<i>clear, contact Tiger.</i>

871
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,000
Throw away your SIM cards!

872
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,125
I lost my phone at the hospital, sir.

873
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,000
From what we know so far,
the culprits are police officers.

874
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,625
A murder case has been
charged against them.

875
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,666
The government will always stand
by the departed young man's family.

876
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,208
During this election,
what's the government--

877
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,375
The Election Model Code
of Conduct is in force,

878
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,875
so I can't say anything further.

879
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,125
We've got to know that
the culprits escaped

880
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,083
with the help from the local police,

881
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,916
so the investigation has been
handed over to the crime branch.

882
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,583
Ma'am, I was in the toilet
when they escaped.

883
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,333
Only an aged ASI and a lady constable
were present at the station then.

884
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,583
Look, they are police officers.

885
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,583
Stop waiting for them
to switch on their phones

886
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,666
and try to locate the station
mobile unit they took.

887
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,166
They must have left it somewhere.

888
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,041
As soon as you find the vehicle,
do a tower dump of the nearest tower

889
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,625
and get me all the details. Got it?

890
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,083
Okay.

891
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,666
Ma'am, none of them were driving
when the accident happened.

892
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,250
Then, why did you charge them with 302?

893
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,000
The superintendent asked me to do that.

894
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,708
Why are you useless people
roaming around in this uniform?

895
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,666
-You are the reason why--
-Stop it!

896
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,583
You're going to see
a bishop tomorrow, right?

897
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,708
-Yes.
-You may leave now.

898
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,041
You can go on leave for six months.

899
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,291
Sir.

900
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,833
Sir, those three police
officers escaped because

901
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,958
of the call ASI Maniyan
received on his phone.

902
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,291
It was from Mr. Joshy Mathew.

903
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,833
He had called him from
a migrant worker's phone.

904
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:22,875
Joshy Mathew?

905
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,208
He's the youth wing
president of your party, sir.

906
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,833
-Why had he called him?
-It could be personal or political.

907
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,583
We can find out only if we question him.

908
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,833
I will handle him.

909
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,416
No one else needs to know about this.

910
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,208
The media, to be more specific.

911
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:42,000
Also, show this smartness only
while catching the culprits. Got it?

912
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,208
Sir.

913
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,416
Come on!

914
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:12,791
Hey!

915
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,333
-What are you doing here?
-I'd stopped to pee, sir.

916
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,208
In the middle of the road?

917
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,041
What's in the vehicle?

918
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,958
I'm on my way to get it loaded, sir.

919
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,666
Get going!

920
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,333
Was he hiding anything, sir?

921
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,166
No, there were just empty sacks.

922
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,833
Come on, let's go.

923
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:32,791
Sir…

924
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:07,291
Yes, sir.
We are checking all the vehicles.

925
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,958
Stop!

926
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,375
Pull over.

927
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,875
I have a friend in Udumalpet.

928
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,500
We cannot take that route.

929
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,333
There will be strict checking
at all the checkpoints.

930
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,208
What happened?

931
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,625
It's the police.

932
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,750
Hey! Why did you stop here?

933
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:15,708
-Sorry?
-What?

934
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,166
Turn it off!

935
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,208
-What's in the vehicle?
-Nothing, sir. I'm going to get it loaded.

936
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,541
-Hey!
-What?

937
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:33,166
Pull over…
and show me the vehicle's documents!

938
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,416
Go!

939
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:05,500
Why did you stop there?

940
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,416
For no particular reason, sir.

941
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:10,375
-What's in the vehicle?
-It's empty, sir.

942
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,250
-I've checked it.
-It's empty.

943
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:15,125
Go!

944
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:18,458
You may go!

945
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:19,500
Get going!

946
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,375
Go!

947
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,125
Hey… go!

948
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,750
Pull over!

949
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,958
Proper checking is happening
on all the routes, right?

950
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,250
Inform us immediately if
you get any information.

951
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,250
Wait a second.

952
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:22,208
Ma'am, the service history details of
those officers and the other details…

953
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,583
of their friends and relatives have
been collected from the SP office.

954
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:27,958
Okay, that's great.

955
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,583
Ma'am, we've asked the cyber
cell to monitor the numbers

956
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,458
of people who have frequently called them.

957
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,250
-What about the vehicle?
-The local police are looking for it.

958
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,291
As soon as they get any
information, they'll contact you.

959
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,291
Okay.

960
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,125
The last information we got about them

961
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,041
was that they were seen at Sunitha's
house at 11:30 p.m. right?

962
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,916
What's the maximum distance they
can cover in two and a half hours?

963
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,750
-About 150 kilometers, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

964
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,750
Strict checking is taking place on

965
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,875
the Kottayam, Ernakulam, and Moovattupuzha
routes. So, they won't take those routes.

966
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,583
But they might go to Idukki.

967
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,791
Checking is not that
strict there at night.

968
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,583
Or they might just be here… right?

969
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:09,333
<i>-Hello!</i>
-Yes?

970
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,541
Ma'am, we've found the vehicle.

971
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,375
When we did a nearby tower dump,

972
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,916
it showed that Praveen made
a call from someone's phone here.

973
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,041
<i>They left with Praveen's friend Hakkim.</i>

974
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,708
<i>-Hakkim's phone is switched off now.</i>
-Okay.

975
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:24,291
Get the details of the vehicle
that was used to escape.

976
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:27,625
Check all the CCTV footage to
find out about the route.

977
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:28,750
-Okay, ma'am.
-Got it?

978
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:29,666
Yes.

979
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,416
Mom has to be taken
to the hospital tomorrow.

980
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,666
-Make some arrangement--
-Hey!

981
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,375
-I'll get it done.
-Get going!

982
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:49,791
Whom will you send?

983
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,625
-Either Sudhi or I will go.
-Hey!

984
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,500
Just go!

985
01:00:58,291 --> 01:00:59,708
Why were you stopping him?

986
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:02,458
The police must have identified
him and his vehicle by now!

987
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,833
They will be here any moment!

988
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,250
Are you both here to attend a wedding?

989
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,083
Sir…

990
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:02,833
what's the plan now?

991
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:05,041
What plan? Do you have a plan?

992
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,166
Tell me!

993
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,125
I'd warned you not to
take him to the hospital!

994
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,166
Now don't do anything stupid!
Just do as I say!

995
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,166
-What stupidity are you talking about?
-Sir!

996
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:13,708
-What do you--
-Sir!

997
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:14,833
-Don't fight, sir--
-Move!

998
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,750
We are in this mess because of you!

999
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,541
I got trapped in this while helping you!

1000
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,000
What nonsense!

1001
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,875
You hit him because you were pissed
at him. Did I ask you to help me?

1002
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:24,916
Of course, you'll say this!

1003
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,458
-You are just like your father!
-Sir!

1004
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,416
If you curse my father,
I won't consider your age, mind you!

1005
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,708
What will you do?

1006
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,791
-What will you do?
-You idiot…

1007
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,166
Hey! Sir, please don't fight!

1008
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,166
-Move!
-Sir!

1009
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,458
What's your problem?

1010
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:58,708
Hey! You imbecile!

1011
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,333
Are you blind?

1012
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,083
You had to jump in front of my vehicle?

1013
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,000
Hey! You idiot!

1014
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,125
Brother, three cups of tea, please.

1015
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,833
I've just opened the shop.
It will take five minutes.

1016
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,333
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

1017
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,416
Okay.

1018
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,375
Brother, do you have a phone?

1019
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,000
My calls are not going through.

1020
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,875
Hello, sister. It's me, Sunitha.

1021
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,041
Auntie!

1022
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,000
Your daughter had called.

1023
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,500
She is fine.

1024
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,708
She's told me to tell you not to worry.

1025
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,125
Don't be upset.

1026
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,291
Whatever information you
get, let me know.

1027
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,916
Could you track the number?

1028
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,250
Okay.

1029
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,125
Upon arriving in Munnar,
I want to meet the van's driver

1030
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:36,916
and the person from whose phone
they made the call. Got it?

1031
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,375
Call Munnar Station
and ask them to be alert.

1032
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:41,708
Okay?

1033
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,041

-Hello?
<i>-Is this mobile located in Munnar?</i>

1037
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:55,833
Okay, sir.

1038

<i>12 mobile control.</i>

1039
01:05:58,958 --> 01:05:59,833
12 mobile answering.

1040
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,875
<i>There's urgent instruction.</i>

1041
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,583
<i>Three police officers who are the culprits</i>
<i>in a 302 case have arrived in Munnar.</i>

1042
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,875
<i>Do a thorough check</i>
<i>of the town and surroundings.</i>

1043
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:08,833
The message is clear.

1044
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:10,916
Sir!

1045
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:11,958
Wake up, sir!

1046
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,833
Sir, we've got a message
that the police officers

1047
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,583
who escaped from Piravom
have arrived in Munnar.

1048
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:17,833
We shall go there and check.

1049
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,625
-Or else we'll be in trouble.
-Okay.

1050
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:37,958
<i>The sea of life</i>

1051
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:44,958
<i>Is searching for another shore</i>

1052
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:51,541
<i>Destiny is far away</i>

1053
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:59,791

1058
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:39,166

<i>Searching for the prey</i>

01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,041
Hey, what is this?

1063
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:56,208
Why didn't you wash the vessels?

1064
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,875
I am paying you! What more do you want?

1065
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,791
Oh, really?

1066
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:05,541
Two cups of tea.

1067
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,625
<i>Didn't you wear it today?</i>

1068
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,458
<i>This one!</i>

1069
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:22,208
<i>Here. Go and wear it.</i>

1070
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,375
Chenduvarai, anyone?

1071
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,000
-The vehicle is here. Let's go.
-Coming!

1072
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:30,125
Come quickly!

1073
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,500
-Wait, I am coming!
-Hurry up!

1074
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,333
Hey, old man! Come!

1075
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,333
-Coming!
-Come quickly!

1076
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,458
-Hey!
-Let's go!

1077
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:42,833
<i>The State School Youth Festival</i>
<i>had a colorful start in Thrissur.</i>

1078
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:45,791
<i>The festival began with</i>
<i>a grand procession--</i>

1079
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,583
{\an8}<i>Violence erupted during</i>
<i>the protest against</i>

1080
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:52,541
{\an8}<i>Jayan's murder in Ernakulam district.</i>

1081
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,083
{\an8}<i>There's no information</i>
<i>so far about the three</i>

1082
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:58,083
<i>accused police officers, Maniyan</i>
<i>KP, Praveen Michael, and Sunitha.</i>

1083
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,500
<i>Those who helped them escape--</i>

1084
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,750
-How much for one cup of tea?
-Ten rupees.

1085
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,916
-How much for two?
-Twenty rupees.

1086
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:20,666
Give us water!

1087
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,208
Come on!

1088
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,583
Come!

1089
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,875
Come on!

1090
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,916
Who are you?

1091
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,791
Sir!

1092
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,125
It's you!

1093
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:56,250
How are you?

1094
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:58,708
Who are they?

1095
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,708
Hey, these are our people! Shut up!

1096
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,666
I need help, Moorthy.

1097
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,166
What happened, sir?
Tell me! I'll do anything for you!

1098
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,166
This is the SP's daughter.

1099
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,208
He has eloped with her.

1100
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:10,833
I had to intervene in this issue.

1101
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,500
Police are looking for us.
We need to stay here for two days.

1102
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,166
Two days?
You can stay here for two years!

1103
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,208
But we don't have many facilities here.
There are sacks lying inside.

1104
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,416
That's the only problem.

1105
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,291
Today is the last day of the festival.

1106
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,625
So, we can get them married tomorrow.

1107
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:27,125
That's not necessary. Police are looking
for us 'cause she's the SP's daughter.

1108
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:28,750
We just need to stay here for two days.

1109
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:29,791
As you wish.

1110
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:36,916
Brother.

1111
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,500
What's all that commotion about?

1112
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,666
That's just… our lifelong crisis.
An argument over water distribution.

1113
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,500
Police might come here.

1114
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,333
Police? What can they do?

1115
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,375
If we go to the police or the court…

1116
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,958
they would ask for the documents,
witnesses, and evidence.

1117
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:54,583
All we need is some water.
We'll figure it out somehow.

1118
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,375
Hello?

1119
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:20,291
Hello!

1120
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:39,416
{\an8}<i>Youth wings and associations</i>
<i>of the opposition party</i>

1121

{\an8}<i>are leading large-scale</i>
<i>protests all over Kerala.</i>

1122
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,916
{\an8}<i>Twelve hours have passed</i>
<i>since Jayan left us.</i>

1123
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,625
{\an8}<i>The state has never witnessed the kinds</i>
<i>of incidents that are happening now.</i>

1124
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:54,416
{\an8}<i>The accused police officers have managed</i>
<i>to escape from the police station.</i>

1125
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,125
{\an8}<i>The Kerala Police haven't</i>
<i>succeeded in finding</i>

1126
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,791
{\an8}<i>the culprits even after several hours.</i>

1127
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:02,625
{\an8}<i>Questioning the police is</i>
<i>not going to work here.</i>

1128
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,125
{\an8}<i>Because the accused are</i>
<i>also the police officers.</i>

1129
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:07,666
{\an8}<i>It was the police who helped</i>
<i>the culprits to escape as well.</i>

1130
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,166
{\an8}<i>I have only one thing to say.</i>
<i>As long as this government is ruling,</i>

1131
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:13,125
{\an8}<i>I have no hope that the backward</i>
<i>classes or the Dalit people of Kerala</i>

1132
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:16,250
{\an8}<i>would ever get any kind of justice.</i>

1133
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:19,125
{\an8}<i>This incident is very inhuman!</i>

1134
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,916
{\an8}<i>Our society will definitely respond</i>
<i>to this through the ballot papers.</i>

1135
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,958
{\an8}<i>Mr. George…</i>

1136
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,125
{\an8}<i>the upcoming by-election</i>
<i>is extremely crucial.</i>

1137
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,000
{\an8}<i>Are you sure your party will be</i>
<i>able to win this by-election?</i>

1138
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:32,416
{\an8}<i>Aparna, you need to understand one thing.</i>

1139
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:35,666
{\an8}<i>The government which is ruling</i>
<i>now is committed to its people.</i>

1140
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,625
{\an8}<i>Just because some criminal</i>
<i>police officers did some atrocity,</i>

1141
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,791
{\an8}<i>they are trying to play caste</i>
<i>politics to gain political mileage!</i>

1142
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,125
{\an8}<i>That won't work here!</i>

1143
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,125
{\an8}<i>This is Kerala!</i>

1144
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:46,666
{\an8}<i>Remember this!</i>

1145
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,000
{\an8}<i>Our government registered</i>
<i>this murder case…</i>

1146
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:53,458
{\an8}<i>and transferred it to the crime branch</i>
<i>within 24 hours of the incident.</i>

1147
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:58,125
{\an8}<i>So, I am 100% sure that we will win</i>
<i>this by-election, and along with that,</i>

1148
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:01,875
{\an8}<i>all the culprits in this case will be</i>
<i>taken into custody before the election!</i>

1149
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,333
{\an8}<i>Mark my words!</i>

1150
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:07,958
{\an8}<i>Mr. George, one night has passed</i>
<i>since this incident happened.</i>

1151
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:12,000
{\an8}<i>And you are still repeating whatever</i>
<i>the Chief Minister said last night!</i>

1152
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,541
<i>Within these 12 hours,</i>

1153
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:16,375
<i>what action has the police</i>
<i>taken on this issue?</i>

1154
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:25,500
Excuse me, sir.

1155
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,166
Hello.

1156
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,083
<i>-Sir!</i>
-Yes?

1157
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:31,208
Sir, we've arrested the driver
who helped the culprits escape

1158
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:32,958
and the Tamilian who gave them his phone.

1159
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,166
-Good. I am with the CM.
<i>-And--</i>

1160
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,666
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Sir, we have an update.

1161
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,083
With your permission.

1162
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:42,000
<i>Sir, we've arrested the driver</i>
<i>who helped the culprits escape</i>

1163
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:44,333
<i>and the Tamilian who gave them his phone.</i>

1164
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:48,583
We've got visuals of them traveling on
a tractor around the Top Station area.

1165
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,250
<i>They've gone to Vattavada, sir.</i>

1166
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:53,041
About 10-15 years back,

1167
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,583
ASI Maniyan had gone there on duty.

1168
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:58,000
So, he has contacts there.

1169
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:01,750
We are heading to Vattavada now, sir.

1170
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,250
I must know whatever action
you are going to take.

1171
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,625
Sir.

1172
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,083
Hold a press conference…

1173
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,166
and declare that we've arrested
those, who helped the culprits escape.

1174
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,125
Yes, sir.

1175
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,458
Raid the culprits' relatives'
and friends' houses and arrest them

1176
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:21,125
in the presence of the media.

1177
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,416
-They shouldn't question us hereafter.
-Yes, sir!

1178
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,333
Ask the makeup man to come on stage.

1179
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,666
Okay.

1180
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,208
We're here at the club, sir.

1181
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:47,541
Sir!

1182
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,208
Sir!

1183
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,875
Sir!

1184
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:57,541
We'll do that, sir.

1185
01:18:58,666 --> 01:18:59,625
Sit there.

1186
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,250
No, sir. There aren't any
other law and order problems.

1187
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:19,708
Hello!

1188
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,458
I am near the Mariyamman Temple.

1189
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:23,375
Where are you?

1190
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:25,833
Okay! I can see you!

1191
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,166
Ma'am, I am Jayaprasad.

1192
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:39,625
Any information?

1193
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,291
We've got the information that

1194
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,666
three new people have been
spotted in Kottakamboor.

1195
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:44,916
-Kottakamboor?
-Yes, ma'am.

1196
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,500
This is our border, ma'am.
There is a forest beyond this point.

1197
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,458
There were many cannabis
farms over there earlier.

1198
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:52,416
About 500 Tamil families stay here.
All are farmers.

1199
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,958
Does that route lead to any other place?

1200
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,625
If we go by car,
it'll take us back to Munnar.

1201
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:02,000
The other one is the forest route that
leads either to Kodaikanal or Palani.

1202
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,000
Only those who are familiar
with that route can go that way.

1203
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:07,416
-Okay. When will we get there?
-It will definitely be past 5:00 p.m.

1204
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,666
But it wouldn't be possible
tonight because of the fog.

1205
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,958
We have a couple of informers.

1206
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,541
We haven't been able to communicate with
them because of the network issue.

1207
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,500
Okay.

1208
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:16,916
It's hot.

1209
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,375
Arrange the dog squad…

1210
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,375
and get the clothes of the accused so
that the dogs could trace their location.

1211
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,208
Mr. Praveen!

1212
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,541
Mr. Maniyan and I have had
several escapades here.

1213
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,541
Fifteen years ago…

1214
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,750
there had been a cannabis
raid in this forest.

1215
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,166
I was also with them.

1216
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,833
You can't imagine what all we had done!

1217
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,041
It's funny to think about it even now.

1218
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,583
Sir.

1219
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:45,833
Have some coffee.

1220
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:51,250
Here you go, sir.

1221
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,291
Brother.

1222
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,083
Can we reach Tamil Nadu if
we take the forest route?

1223
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:05,250
If you take the forest route,
you'll reach Palani after two days.

1224
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:08,375
But the problem is that there would be
wild elephants and tigers on the way.

1225
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,166
You'll have to be careful.

1226
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:17,083
Dear… what happened?

1227
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:18,708
Are you not feeling well?

1228
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,083
I have a headache.

1229
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:33,416
Apply this to your forehead.
You'll feel better in no time.

1230
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,791
Sir, stop drinking alcohol.
Have some coffee instead.

1231
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,458
Today is the last day of the festival.
I'll be back.

1232
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,333
Brother… your <i>mundu</i> is torn.

1233
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,166
A dog must have torn it.

1234
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:15,625
It doesn't look like a dog's doing.

1235
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,208
That's the police in you talking!

1236
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,625
What else can we expect from you!

1237
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,416
Keep this.

1238
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,458
-Mr. Mani, I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

1239
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,833
We need details of all
the homestays here.

1240
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:04,208
Check whether Maniyan has
contacted anyone here.

1241
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:05,291
-Okay?
-Ma'am!

1242
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,708
There are about three homestays here.

1243
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,500
Only North Indians and
foreigners are staying there.

1244
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,458
There are a couple more
in the interior areas.

1245
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,166
We'll contact them as soon as possible.

1246
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,541
How many days does this
festival go on for?

1247
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,875
Today is the last day, ma'am.

1248
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,708
-Hello?
-Sir, we have arrived in Kottakamboor.

1249
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,125
We are collecting information
about them from the locals.

1250
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:28,916
Now we are going to check
the homestays, sir.

1251
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:31,708
The primary information is
that there are no Malayalis there.

1252
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:43,833
One pack of cigarettes, please.

1253
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,541
And one pack of sanitary pads.

1254
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:54,083
-How much?
-That'd be Rs. 130.

1255
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,875
Sir… wear a jacket.

1256
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,083
It's really cold.

1257
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:22,833
Here.

1258
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,500
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

1259
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:36,625
Okay?

1260
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:01,833
Groundnuts taste the same no
matter where they are from.

1261
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:10,541
I'm not lying.

1262
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:11,958
They're nice.

1263
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,041
Sir!

1264
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,416
Come, let's eat something.

1265
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:31,916
Do you hear that song?

1266
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:33,958
It's nice, right?

1267
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,958
My father wanted me to be a singer.

1268
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,833
My daughter was born when
I was in this forest back then.

1269
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:45,708
For the cannabis hunt.

1270
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:52,875
I saw my daughter's face
15 days after she was born.

1271
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,375
I had promised her…

1272
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:00,083
that I'd go with her to her competition.
It's tomorrow.

1273
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:02,916
And even now, I am here.

1274
01:27:06,916 --> 01:27:07,791
I'm starving.

1275
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,125
Porridge?

1276
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:13,375
Sir.

1277
01:27:24,083 --> 01:27:25,625
Didn't you add salt to this, Sunitha?

1278
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:26,916
I did, sir.

1279
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:28,833
It doesn't have salt.

1280
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,291
It doesn't have salt at all.

1281
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:40,166
Why are you complaining, sir?

1282
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,541
It's not like we're really hungry!

1283
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:47,375
If we suddenly have to escape from here,
we might not get to eat anything!

1284
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:49,958
We're also worried!

1285
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:56,750
What are you worried about?

1286
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:04,250
Ever since my daughter was born, I haven't
been able to go with her anywhere…

1287
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:05,541
as her father, even once.

1288
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:10,833
I have a headache!

1289
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:12,875
I don't even have my medicine.

1290
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:37,083
It's them.

1291
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:50,750
Hey!

1292
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:52,708
Move, dear!

1293
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,291
Apart from Kottakamboor,
what other villages are nearby?

1294
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,375
If we go through the forest,

1295
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,750
then there are small villages like
Kilavarai, Kadavari, etc.

1296
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,791
As they're under the forest department's
observation, they can't stay there.

1297
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,708
If they go northwest from here,

1298
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:23,208
then they can go to Kanthalloor
via Pazhathottam-Chenduvarai.

1299
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,958
From there,
they might go to Tamil Nadu by car.

1300
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,541
They are here.

1301
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:34,541
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
taken this route from Munnar.

1302
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,583
Someone is helping them here.

1303
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:44,875
The farmers are bursting crackers
to chase the pigs away, ma'am.

1304
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:15,333
Shobi, come here!

1305
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:16,791
Hey, Moorthy!

1306
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:19,291
Is it our man at the court?

1307
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:22,041
-Why? What happened?
-He's lying there drunk.

1308
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:24,250
Shobi, come on!

1309
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,250
Maari, put this in
the temple donation box.

1310
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,250
They are going to Palani.

1311
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:31,000
Shobi!

1312
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:32,416
Shobi, come on!

1313
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,083
Mr. Mani!

1314
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,208
You started drinking early today!

1315
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,500
Sir, this used to be a court long back.

1316
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,416
It's a perfect place to booze.

1317
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:48,916
Sir!

1318
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,166
Can you please stop boozing?

1319
01:31:52,416 --> 01:31:54,958
We're trying our best to escape
from this problem.

1320
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:56,916
And you're boozing all the time!

1321
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,291
Going to jail is better than this!

1322
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,166
If you keep doing this,
we won't be able to escape from here!

1323
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:42,041
DALIT YOUNGSTER'S DEATH: STUDENT'S
YOUTH FESTIVAL DREAM SHATTERED

1324
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,000
Brother…

1325
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:00,000
can we go to Palani with the people
who went this way earlier?

1326
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:01,125
You can't go now, sir.

1327
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,083
They would have entered
the forest by now.

1328
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:06,166
You won't be able to take Mr. Maniyan
along in his present condition.

1329
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,666
Another group is going there tomorrow.

1330
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:12,125
If you want to go with them, you'll
need to pack some food for the journey.

1331
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:32,833
-He had come here yesterday.
-At what time?

1332
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:34,875
-Just before I closed the shop.
-What did he buy?

1333
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:36,250
Cigarettes and sanitary pads.

1334
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:40,375
<i>What's the update?</i>

1335
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:42,958
Sir, they're here. They'd been
to one of the shops last night.

1336
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:44,333
Don't you have the dog squad with you?

1337
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,458
<i>Sir, the street is covered with</i>
<i>turmeric because of the festival.</i>

1338
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:47,625
<i>Dogs are unable to trace them.</i>

1339
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:49,875
Then, find them with the
help of the military!

1340
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,666
This is not the time for a one-man show!

1341
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,000
<i>Sir, it's not practical.</i>

1342
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:55,208
<i>You don't know the</i>
<i>geography of this place.</i>

1343
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:57,166
<i>This village is surrounded by a forest.</i>

1344
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:00,083
Many people here are into
the cannabis business.

1345
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,083
<i>If we send the force,</i>
<i>the culprits will find out immediately.</i>

1346
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,500
<i>They might escape into the forest.</i>

1347
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:05,875
<i>-It's risky, sir.</i>
-What risk?

1348
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,416
Do you have any bloody idea
of the situation I'm in?

1349
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,333
And the pressure from
the CM to solve the case?

1350
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:13,333
You haven't found the culprits even
after two days! Now call off your search!

1351
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,000
<i>I'm sending the force.</i>

1352
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,583
Where is today's newspaper?

1353
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:28,708
Moorthy took it with him.

1354
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,083
Who is Moorthy?

1355
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,208
He does farming on the other
side of that hill, ma'am.

1356
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:40,291
Didn't you say that there
are no Malayalis here?

1357
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:42,041
Yeah. There are no Malayalis here.

1358
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,125
Whose phone has a signal?

1359
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,083
Ma'am.

1360
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,166
Sir, Anuradha here!

1361
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:04,333
Sir, please give me two more hours!

1362
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:06,083
Please, sir!

1363
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:07,291
Sir, we're almost there!

1364
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,166
Please, sir!

1365
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:12,250
Thank you, sir.

1366
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,333
Sir, the situation is quite critical.

1367
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,250
All the survey reports are against us.

1368
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:20,375
Sir, this incident has strongly
influenced the neutral votes.

1369
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,125
As per the intelligence
report I received,

1370
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:26,416
Dalit associations have called for a press
conference at seven o'clock tonight.

1371
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:29,000
If we don't arrest the culprits by then,

1372
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,250
they'd boycott tomorrow's election.

1373
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:35,000
Sir, they have about 50,000 votes.

1374
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:38,458
We've been getting about
90% of those votes for ages.

1375
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:39,583
So, it's crucial.

1376
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:42,166
Sir, Anuradha had called now.

1377
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:44,041
They've got information
on the culprits now.

1378
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:45,750
We're very close to nabbing them, sir.

1379
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,833
I need a solution before seven o'clock.

1380
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:50,541
Come here only when you have that.

1381
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:14,541
Ma'am, it's the DGP.

1382
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:19,583
<i>Hello!</i>

1383
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:21,208
We've located the culprits, sir.

1384
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,125
Arrest them!

1385
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:24,250
They are not in a position
where we can arrest them.

1386
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,416
What is stopping you?

1387
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:29,500
They are at a place from where they can
easily spot us, no matter where we go.

1388
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,708
The forest is right behind them.

1389
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,333
<i>They have a dog with them.</i>

1390
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:36,333
<i>Moreover, one of those three</i>
<i>people is not with them now.</i>

1391
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,666
<i>We have to wait, sir.</i>

1392
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,083
We cannot wait in such
a crucial situation!

1393
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:41,375
I need action immediately!

1394
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:43,416
Sir, their local supporter is with us.

1395
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,125
We've arrested him.

1396
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:48,208
They plan to leave for
Palani tomorrow morning.

1397
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:50,583
<i>No… I don't want to hear any excuse!</i>
<i>Enough!</i>

1398
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:52,333
Sir, we can try going in disguise.

1399
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:54,666
But if something happens,
you have to take the risk.

1400
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,000
Hello!

1401
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:57,625
Hello!

1402
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:09,500
Sir, we've located the culprits.

1403
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:12,375
-They are under our surveillance.
-Then, why don't you arrest them?

1404
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:15,583
Sir, we need some additional force there.
That's what they are waiting for.

1405
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,250
Sir, it's risky to delay it until then.

1406
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,625
It'll be late by the time they're
arrested and brought here.

1407
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,500
There won't even be a news
article in tomorrow's papers.

1408
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:22,625
That will affect
the polling in the morning.

1409
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:25,166
Sir, they will decide to boycott
the election at 7:00 p.m.

1410
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,125
We must find a solution before that.

1411
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,916
Sir, we can try going in disguise.

1412
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,916
But they are police
officers, so that's risky.

1413
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,666
They also have a dog with them.

1414
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:35,750
If they feel the presence of the police,
they will enter the forest.

1415
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:36,833
Once they enter the forest,

1416
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:39,500
we won't be able to trace
them or meet our deadline.

1417
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:41,625
What if they escape before the evening?

1418
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:44,083
Sir, the man who helped
them is in our custody.

1419
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:46,166
They plan to leave for
Palani tomorrow morning.

1420
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,375
Are you 100% sure you'll be
able to arrest them today?

1421
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:55,791
Yes, sir.

1422
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:08,791
{\an8}<i>The three police officers who are</i>
<i>the culprits in the Jayan Murder Case</i>

1423
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:12,041
{\an8}<i>have been arrested. They've been</i>
<i>brought to the Aluva Police Club.</i>

1424
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,583
{\an8}<i>You can see those visuals now.</i>

1425
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:15,833
{\an8}<i>The three of them will be</i>
<i>thoroughly interrogated here.</i>

1426
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:18,750
{\an8}<i>Following which, they might be</i>
<i>presented in court tomorrow.</i>

1427
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,041
<i>This Jayan Murder Case</i>

1428
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:23,375
<i>was a strong weapon that the opposition</i>
<i>had found against the ruling government</i>

1429
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:24,916
<i>just before the election.</i>

1430
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,875
<i>As the election is scheduled</i>
<i>to happen tomorrow,</i>

1431
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:30,041
{\an8}<i>this arrest will be a huge</i>
<i>relief for the government.</i>

1432
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,166
{\an8}<i>No doubt about that!</i>

1433
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,708
The third one is here.

1434
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:02,500
Forget it, man.

1435
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:04,166
I will be okay.

1436
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,000
I never expected that
they'll go to my house…

1437
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:12,291
and do this atrocity.

1438
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:19,250
I've been running around as their
hunting dog for about 20 years!

1439
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:22,166
I never committed any
atrocity for my own sake.

1440
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:25,875
Anyway, I will be okay.

1441
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:27,708
You should also forget about it.

1442
01:39:32,916 --> 01:39:35,000
We should find some other
job when we go back home.

1443
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:37,791
This is not meant for people like us.

1444
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,458
Where are you going now, sir?

1445
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:41,583
To crap.

1446
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,041
Move!

1447
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:21,083
Will we be acquitted
if we go to court, sir?

1448
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:27,958
Mr. Maniyan will figure something out.

1449
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,791
I will quit this job once I get back.

1450
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,166
Sir!

1451
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:54,083
Sir!

1452
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:55,791
Mr. Maniyan!

1453
01:41:58,708 --> 01:41:59,583
Sir!

1454
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:02,666
Sir!

1455
01:42:06,541 --> 01:42:07,458
Sir!

1456
01:42:08,416 --> 01:42:09,250
Sir!

1457
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:11,500
Sir!

1458
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:56,041
Hello.

1459
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:57,500
Hello!

1460
01:42:58,416 --> 01:42:59,291
Sir…

1461
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:00,416
we've got the culprits.

1462
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:02,458
But one of them hung himself, sir.

1463
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:03,500
What?

1464
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:06,750
Two of them moved unexpectedly.
By the time…

1465
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:08,541
we chased them and got here,

1466
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:11,041
the third one was hanging
dead at an old building.

1467
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:13,791
The remaining two are
in our custody, sir.

1468
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:16,291
Sir?

1469
01:43:16,666 --> 01:43:17,583
Hello?

1470
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:19,250
Hello!

1471
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,375
Hello!

1472
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:32,208
Sir…

1473
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:35,375
one of the culprits hung
himself to death in Munnar.

1474
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:51,916
I will tell the media that the police
gave me distorted information.

1475
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:54,791
Then, you'll have to answer them.

1476
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:57,708
Call Rajan.

1477
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:04,500
Hello! Who all are there with you?

1478
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,666
Only my team, sir.

1479
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:07,041
Listen!

1480
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:10,583
Because you'd promised that you'd arrest
them today, we made a dummy arrest here.

1481
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,666
The CM had asked me to do it,
but he's washed his hands of it now.

1482
01:44:14,625 --> 01:44:15,458
Look!

1483
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:19,291
Both the culprits and the corpse should
reach the police club at the earliest.

1484
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:22,041
If the case gets complicated,
it'll be transferred to another agency!

1485
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:23,833
You'll be held responsible for the death!

1486
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:25,875
What the fuck!

1487
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:27,166
Shut up, you stupid!

1488
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:29,333
I won't take the responsibility!

1489
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,416
I know what to do!

1490
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,041
Fuck you!

1491
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:46,583
Pull it down slowly.

1492
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,458
Hold the leg carefully.

1493
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:52,250
I'll hold it from behind.

1494
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,625
-Hey!
-Find something to cover it.

1495
01:44:55,708 --> 01:44:57,041
What the hell is happening?

1496
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:01,833
Who asked you to untie the body
before the inquest procedures?

1497
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:03,625
Ma'am, what was our fault?

1498
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:04,666
-We weren't even--
-Hey!

1499
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:07,708
If you blabber over here,
I'll kill both of you!

1500
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:10,291
Take the body!

1501
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:11,833
Ma'am, please come.

1502
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:26,833
The order is to take the body to the
club, come what may. I will do it.

1503
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:28,750
Will it be the end of this?

1504
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:30,875
No.

1505
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,208
What can you do, ma'am?

1506
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:34,541
You might say all this
to the media or the court.

1507
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:39,083
Earlier, an IPS officer spoke against
the state on humanitarian grounds.

1508
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,958
He has been in jail for two years now.
He didn't even get out on bail.

1509
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:47,541
I've been in service
longer than you, ma'am.

1510
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,750
Our fate is not far from that dead man's.

1511
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:05,833
Take the body.

1512
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:36,833
Catch him!

1513
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:30,166
<i>This is my dying declaration.</i>

1514
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,333
<i>That car was mine…</i>

1515
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:34,291
<i>but I wasn't driving it that day.</i>

1516
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,458
<i>My sister's son was driving it.</i>

1517
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:39,250
<i>Those innocents were</i>
<i>just traveling with me.</i>

1518
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:43,875
<i>My daughter shouldn't live</i>
<i>as a murderer's daughter.</i>

1519
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:48,083
<i>The court should consider</i>
<i>this as my dying declaration</i>

1520
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:49,666
<i>and investigate this case truthfully.</i>

1521
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,208
<i>Those innocents should be acquitted.</i>

1522
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:53,833
<i>I'm ending this.</i>

1523
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:03,750
-Is there another copy of this?
-No, sir.

1524
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,375
Sir…

1525
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:43,291
it was Rahul who drove the car
when the accident happened.

1526
01:51:44,125 --> 01:51:46,666
We realized it was Jayan only
when we carried him to the car.

1527
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,791
Just before the accident happened,

1528
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:50,541
Rahul had withdrawn money from an ATM.

1529
01:51:51,083 --> 01:51:53,458
If you check its security
camera, you'd spot Rahul in it.

1530
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:55,916
Or if you locate his
and our mobile towers,

1531
01:51:56,083 --> 01:51:58,500
you'd find out that
we were together, sir.

1532
01:51:58,583 --> 01:51:59,458
Praveen…

1533
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:02,583
from what you're saying, we can prove
that there was someone else in the car.

1534
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:05,500
But the fingerprints on the car's
steering wheel are yours.

1535
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,000
This argument won't stand in court.

1536
01:52:09,291 --> 01:52:10,166
Sir…

1537
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,833
our department will be able
to prove the truth, right?

1538
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:15,291
Praveen…

1539
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:18,916
you know that the department cannot do
anything against the government, right?

1540
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:19,916
Especially in this situation,

1541
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,083
because the media has created such
a negative image of your case.

1542
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:25,083
As the election is happening today,

1543
01:52:25,416 --> 01:52:27,500
we cannot expect anything
else from the government.

1544
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:33,166
Just like you, the DGP and the entire
police system are locked in this case.

1545
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:35,333
We must solve this at any cost.

1546
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:38,291
Give it to me.

1547
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:52,416
This is your statement which says that…

1548
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:56,375
Maniyan committed suicide after he got
here. Both of you will have to sign it.

1549
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:06,250
We can prepare Maniyan's suicide note
with the help of a handwriting expert.

1550
01:53:07,291 --> 01:53:08,583
Maniyan will be declared guilty.

1551
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:10,875
All of us will be safe.

1552
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:14,666
We don't have any other option now.

1553
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:23,333
I won't do it, sir.

1554
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:27,333
Even if I'm hung to death for
this, I won't do it.

1555
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:35,375
Just before he died…

1556
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,625
he was talking about his daughter.

1557
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:40,166
He lived his whole life for his daughter.

1558
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:47,750
That girl shouldn't have to live
as a murderer's daughter.

1559
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:53,875
I can't do this.

1560
01:53:57,625 --> 01:53:59,916
This has Maniyan's declaration
video, right?

1561
01:54:08,916 --> 01:54:10,916
The outside world is
never going to see this.

1562
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:19,125
And you said you can prove scientifically
that Rahul was driving, right?

1563
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,333
Give that to me.

1564
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:29,125
<i>My name is Rahul.</i>

1565
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:30,666
<i>Sir, I was driving the car that day.</i>

1566
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:32,333
<i>All of them had consumed alcohol.</i>

1567
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:36,791
<i>When Mr. Praveen saw Jayan,</i>
<i>he started the steering car.</i>

1568
01:54:36,875 --> 01:54:39,458
<i>When the accident took place,</i>
<i>I got scared and ran away.</i>

1569
01:54:47,458 --> 01:54:48,833
If this goes to court,

1570
01:54:49,541 --> 01:54:51,458
you'll get nothing short
of life imprisonment.

1571
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,916
Both of you are young.

1572
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,541
Give it another thought.

1573
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,083
We have time until we have to go to court.

1574
01:55:17,166 --> 01:55:19,333
-Sir, the forensic team is here.
-Okay. Call them.

1575
01:56:03,041 --> 01:56:05,958
This is a huge relief for
the state government…

1576
01:56:06,041 --> 01:56:10,041
as they were able to catch all three
culprits of the Jayan Murder Case.

1577
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:13,416
They were brought last night to the
Aluva Police Club, which you can see here.

1578
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,958
One of those police officers committed
suicide earlier this morning.

1579
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:20,666
The inquest procedures of the dead
policeman are happening right now.

1580
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:24,916
The remaining two police officers
will be taken to court shortly.

1581
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,750
The police have arranged tight
security here prior to that.

1582
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:31,166
Because chances are that
large-scale protests might happen.

1583
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:33,833
Anyway, the crowd has
gathered here already.

1584
01:56:33,916 --> 01:56:38,541
Like I mentioned earlier, this is
a huge relief for the state government

1585
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:41,583
because a very crucial
election is happening today.

1586
01:56:41,666 --> 01:56:45,625
So, capturing these three culprits is
quite beneficial for the government.

1587
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:48,250
That's what we can say right now.

1588
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:51,083
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1589
01:56:51,166 --> 01:56:54,625
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1590
01:56:54,833 --> 01:56:58,083
-Go to hell, police!
-Go to hell, police!

1591
01:56:58,166 --> 01:57:01,083
-We will teach you a lesson!
-We will teach you a lesson!

1592
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:04,208
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1593
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:07,708
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1594
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:11,083
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1595
01:57:11,166 --> 01:57:14,416
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!

1596
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:38,125
VOTE FOR THE CDF CANDIDATE,
G. RAVEENDRANATH

1597
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:12,541
Do you have trouble seeing clearly, ma'am?

1598
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,625
-She is blind.
-I can't see anything, son.

1599
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:16,291
Okay. You may accompany her.

1600
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:17,541
Thank you.

1601
01:58:20,083 --> 01:58:22,625
Number 72, Vinod KT.
