1
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:28,874
Coorg, Karnataka

2
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
Why fix marriage in
this hilly region?

3
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,833
Had you okayed my brother
Jagannadham's daughter,

4
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,958
engagement would be in Jaipur palace
and marriage in Buckingham Palace.

5
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,041
You still have time,
shall l call him?

6
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,499
Welcome, brother-in-law!
- Welcome please!

7
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,374
Greetings.
- Welcome, son-in-law.

8
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,666
Had a safe journey, right?
Please come in.

9
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,958
What? ls bride missing?

10
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,791
Brother-in-law, bride has ran away.

11
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,624
Check if there are any saris
hanging out from window.

12
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:17,583
According to our tradition, l told you
bride won't be here for engagement.

13
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,999
lf you want l'll let son-in-law
talk on phone after engagement.

14
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,958
Don't bother about him, you carry on.

15
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,041
What tradition?

16
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,708
Had it been my brother Jagannadham's daughter,
she would be in the groom's lap by now.

17
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,874
l rejected the proposal
for that reason only.

18
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,249
Oh my God!

19
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,083
What's all this?

20
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,208
l'll tell...l said l'll tell...

21
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,749
Brother-in-law!
He's talking in different tone.

22
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,083
Groom's friends are getting drunk there.

23
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,208
Did you really inquire
to okay this proposal?

24
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,833
Everyone will have bad habits.
Only few have bank balance.

25
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,833
lnquire their favourite brand
and send bottles.

26
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,249
Brother, you don't answer phone call
and they're fixing marriage here.

27
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,749
This is what you call catching leaves
after hands are burnt.

28
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,499
Just a minute.

29
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,541
Tell me, sister-in-law.
Have you all left?

30
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,583
lt's not marriage that's going to happen
in your house but your obsequies.

31
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,958
Are you happy about getting
your daughter engaged?

32
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,541
We'll kill you in another hour.

33
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,291
Who are you?

34
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,041
Your death!

35
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,416
Brother-in-law!
- l'll meet lG of police.

36
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,583
Stay here and look after the arrangements.
- Okay, brother-in-law.

37
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,208
Are you in guest house?
l'm coming.

38
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,291
Can't you manage it without me?

39
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,416
l'm getting threats on phone.
This is third time.

40
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
Fire at him!

41
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,874
Gun is jammed! Escape!

42
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:58,666
How did it happen?
Who did it?

43
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,583
You must answer the questions.

44
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:04,208
Along with yourjammers, his gun too got
jammed, that saved my brother-in-law.

45
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,333
How can people who world for salary
save peoples' lives?

46
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,708
lt was our mistake to have
sought security from you.

47
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,208
Don't get angry, sir.
We'll tighten the security further, sir.

48
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,499
No need to tighten or loosen the security.
No need to do anything.

49
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,791
l'm sending back your staff.

50
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:21,583
No need of this security, brother-in-law.
l'll get men from our place.

51
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,666
They'll not hesitate to protect or kill.

52
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,916
Who has the courage to kill me
and who would benefit if l die,

53
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,083
l don't get it.

54
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:33,874
God! What sins have we done?

55
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,749
Who would save us from this danger?

56
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,083
Who?

57
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,666
Guru!

58
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,958
lt's just rehearsal!
Why are you scaring me?

59
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,083
What did you say? Can't a low caste man
compete with high caste man?

60
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,958
What an absurd idea!

61
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,749
This is a test of valour
not of social status.

62
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,708
lt's not and it shouldn't be.
Do you say this is test of caste?

63
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,624
By the way think about your
father Bharadwaja's birth!

64
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,999
Your coming into this world
is more absurd than that!

65
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,916
You were born in a pot!

66
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,958
Which caste do you belong to?

67
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,249
Vada and NTR's dialogues
are unbeatable!

68
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,208
What about our great ancestor Shantanu,

69
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,374
wasn't he son of Ganga, wife of Shiva?

70
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,416
What was his caste?
What did you tell me?

71
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:05,874
Didn't our race begin with Sage Vasishta,
who was son of celestial prostitute Urvashi?

72
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,541
Didn't he marry a low caste Arundhati?

73
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,708
Didn't she give birth
to Parasura, a low caste?

74
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,291
Didn't Parasura father my grandfather Vyasa
with a village belle Mathsyagandhi?

75
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,541
Didn't his widows give birth to my father,

76
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,208
with my grand aunt my paternal uncle Pandu,

77
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:26,791
and didn't a maid of our palace give birth
to Vidhura whom you respect so much?

78
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,124
Which caste does he belong to?

79
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:35,208
This Kuru clan lost its caste many generations
ago if we consider these precedents.

80
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,708
So, it's unnecessary to
talk about caste.

81
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,124
Buddy, our Anji went after a girl,
somebody beat him badly.

82
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,124
Slaves!

83
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,249
Have slaves become so arrogant?

84
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:14,624
Hey! Do you know who we are?
- l know, womanizers!

85
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,958
How dare you go after a girl
my boss loves?

86
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,833
How dare!
How dare you go after her?

87
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,041
Brother!

88
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,999
Don't get angry, tell him fondly.

89
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,791
Please leave brother's girl friend.
- No, l'll not.

90
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,374
My sweet little boy!
- No way, l'll not give her up.

91
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,374
He and his get up!

92
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,958
Hey, leave him.

93
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,874
l'll leave him,
will you leave my girl then?

94
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,333
What if he refuses?
What would you do?

95
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:57,124
Only l'm romantic,
all my boys very violent!

96
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,958
What to do now?
- Shall we run away?

97
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,166
l'll beat them black and blue!
l said what would become of them?

98
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,291
Will you beat us black and blue?

99
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,583
Brother!
- lt seems he'll beat us black and blue.

100
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,874
lf he does it,
l'll pay you Rs.1000.

101
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,124
lf not, you must pay me,
l'm betting on him.

102
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,083
Okay, brother.

103
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:33,583
Come on, beat us black and blue!

104
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,333
Come on do it, we'll get Rs.1000!

105
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:38,499
Come on, beat us!

106
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,166
Hey, leave me...

107
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,791
Do you've to beg to beaten up?

108
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,666
Come on beat us...
come, l'll thrash you boys!

109
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:17,249
Will you come to college with
guitar, jeep and posters?

110
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,583
Take out Rs.1000!

111
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:22,916
Give it to him.

112
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,374
Take it.
- No, please.- Take it l say!

113
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:29,208
Bet on horses not on lions!

114
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,833
l got it, brother.

115
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,666
Why did you bring the original, brother?

116
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,041
Whether it is mace or guts,
using original is my habit!

117
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,499
l didn't do it with bad intention.

118
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,749
She smiled at me once.
Made gestures too!

119
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,124
Hello Padma!

120
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,791
What's happening?

121
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:50,499
l don't know if there's a woman
behind a man's success or not,

122
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,291
but l'm sure there would be a girl
like her in a fight between two men.

123
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,499
l'll set it right now.

124
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,291
Padma, tell me clearly.
This guy or that guy?

125
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,749
Oh my damn girl!

126
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:06,541
lt's clear now!
This is for you and she's his.

127
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,624
Had she told me this clearly?

128
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:12,958
l wouldn't have bought this
guitar, coat and poster!

129
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,291
Whatever said and
done Alwal Raju
is Alwal Raju!

130
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,958
Yash Raj is Yash Raj!

131
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,374
lf people have this philosophy
and clarity in life,

132
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,374
every moment in life would
be a celebration!

133
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,541
For the present, he's enjoying it!

134
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,124
My darling!

135
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:07,666
Salute this guy with attitude...

136
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:16,291
Anyone dare to taken on me,
show power and enslave him...

137
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:20,916
Surge ahead mercurially
in the race of life...

138
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,583
lf you face trouble, go abscond...

139
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,208
Show your adventurous character...

140
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,833
Teenage is too short
to make it a battlefield...

141
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:39,583
Channelize your anger and temper
into enthusiasm...

142
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,958
Youth will never come back,
go full throttle...

143
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:48,374
Play mischief and
have a blast of this short life...

144
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:53,333
Change your step for rhythm
and have a ball in life...

145
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,458
Make your own rules...
live as you like...

146
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:53,124
lf life gets rusted,
even if it fire, clean it...

147
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,874
Body is full of energy...
lts thunders in blood...

148
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:00,208
Fire like character...

149
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,916
Whoever robs your freedom,
take on and pin him down...

150
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,291
Whoever crosses your path,
thrash him down...

151
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:04,916
Fly your collar like a flag...
make your own path with your guts...

152
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:09,333
lf anyone dares talk tough,
silence him forever...

153
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:13,958
You're a hunter of cheetahs...
History needs you...

154
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,333
Victory is yours as grant...

155
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:21,041
Bulldoze your way out of any danger...

156
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,958
Who can match your speed?
Have a blast!

157
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:49,249
lt seems a man will lose 5 minutes
of life if he smokes a cigarette.

158
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,374
Did you hear that?
- l must quit immediately.

159
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,374
l must quit reading such
magazines immediately.

160
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,333
You do that but won't quit
smoking, right?

161
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,916
Come, my dear.
New tenant in the downstairs portion.

162
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,208
Very good in studies!
She tops the class always.

163
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:09,999
lsn't it, dear?
- Yes, it's too competitive world, right?

164
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,458
lfwe don't get first rank,
we can't survive.

165
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,583
Brother has brought a car in America,
take sweets.

166
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,708
Where in America?
- Chicago.

167
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:22,041
lf he buys car Chicago,
why are you distributing sweets here?

168
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,999
lf you stop roaming with useless guys,
you too can go to America.

169
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,666
Our parents too say the same dialogue.

170
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,958
lt seems ifwe don't roam with him,
we would become Collectors.

171
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,208
You?

172
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,541
What would l do in America, mother?

173
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,166
You can buy a car like her brother
within a year.

174
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,874
We can buy a car there but
can't engage a driver.

175
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,041
But here l've a driver
for my bike too!

176
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:41,999
l said it affectionately
not to belittle you.

177
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,749
You add little curry leaf
and chilly powder.

178
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,958
lf he eats so much spicy,
he'll start burning.

179
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,458
What do you say, Saraswathi?

180
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:52,333
Oh no! Not Saraswathi but Jyothi!
Asha Jyothi!

181
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,208
That's okay!
How much did you score in Maths?

182
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,041
99 out of 100, l'm writing exam
for betterment.

183
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,749
This time l'll get that one mark too.

184
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,458
That's what you call education!
How many marks did you get?

185
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,791
Who is better student?
- l!

186
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,791
She prepared for 100 and
got paltry 99 only!

187
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,958
l tried for 36 and got 37!

188
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,708
How much she's feeling
for losing one mark,

189
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,208
l'm also feeling as much for
getting one mark more, father!

190
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,708
l'm ready to sacrifice my mark,
let her take if she wants.

191
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,916
Come on buddies!
He took away one l had!

192
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,166
He charms people with his logic!

193
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,291
ln this rain, in a hotel in
my place Antharvedi,

194
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,958
watching sizzling Nagamani,
eating hot biryani,

195
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,666
it would be great!
- ln between you must have drinks too.

196
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:44,458
Hi useless guys!

197
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,541
Tell me what the best we do
in such rain?

198
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,166
What l say is, when we're sitting
without any work like this,

199
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,874
an expensive car must come
and stop here!

200
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,624
lt did stop, buddy!

201
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,291
Anyway car has stopped, right?

202
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:03,708
A stunning beautiful girl must
get down from the car!

203
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:17,749
She did get down, buddy!

204
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,541
Open your eyes and see!

205
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:26,416
ls it dream or real?

206
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,499
ls it the magic of new day?

207
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,166
ls it new happiness?

208
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:38,166
ls it possible to stop you?

209
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:42,083
Encapsulated womanhood...

210
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:46,458
At least now wake up...

211
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,666
Time is great!
Make a wish, buddy!

212
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:04,416
lf rain stops now,
l'll hug the girl passionately.

213
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,916
Thank God, you didn't want to carry her.

214
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:12,583
Nature is also on my side.
No need to wait anymore, Ranjith.

215
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,583
Round her up to make an impact.

216
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:37,416
What's this? Who are you?

217
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,916
Few goons are after my life.
Please don't talk for few minutes.

218
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,666
Where's he?
- Where's he?

219
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,208
He came this side only.

220
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,041
You were right.
They're here only.

221
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,708
No way are we going to spare him today!

222
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,916
Did you hear that?
Please don't leave me.

223
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:51,958
He came this side only.

224
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,833
Buddy, that's our boy only!

225
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,458
Don't get up now!
They're here only.

226
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,958
How can l get up?

227
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,041
Thank you very much.

228
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,291
You saved my life with
oxygen like hug.

229
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:07,791
l feel contented.

230
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,249
l'm also contented for saving a life.

231
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,124
Move, boys!

232
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,083
What an act!
- Wait, boys!

233
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,916
What's this?

234
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,041
Just now you were fighting, right?

235
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,249
We've become friends.
Friends now.

236
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:38,083
How?

237
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:41,041
lfwe kill each other,
there won't be anyone left,

238
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,083
Lord Brahma gave life,
mother gave birth and raised us,

239
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,874
life is very short,
why should we kill each other?

240
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,833
Acclaimed film director
Boyapati Seenu said this!

241
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,583
l didn't want to disappoint him.
So, we compromised.

242
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:53,958
lsn't it boys?
- Yes.

243
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,833
Cheating me with film dialogues, right?

244
00:26:57,042 --> 00:27:00,541
l'll see.
- See! When? Where?

245
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:32,458
Hello Secretary! l'm not grandma!

246
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:42,499
Why not go to gym in your free time
and get your body into shape?

247
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:43,958
Be up to date, girls!

248
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:47,958
No use in admiring yourself
in mirror.

249
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,833
Get in shape so that others
watch you.

250
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,124
ls she our caretaker or
are we her caretakers, sister?

251
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,291
Once again, please!

252
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,374
What happened to him?
Why is he licking the phone?

253
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,708
He's playing ring a phone and
kiss game with his girl friend.

254
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,708
What's his score?
- He's about to hit a century.

255
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,416
lf l get the girl l met yesterday,

256
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,749
l'll play a new game known as
cut the call and hug the girl!

257
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:23,708
lf your girl friend has to come, either
it must rain or llayaraja's song must play.

258
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,458
lf the girl comes as easily
as the song is played...

259
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,916
Bunty! Start the bike!

260
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,166
Madam, this is no parking zone.

261
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,333
Stop...stop...

262
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,458
Young Tendulkar, come here.

263
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,583
You don't use phone,
tell me whose number you gave!

264
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,416
We're holding it in hand
with tension!

265
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,416
lt was a fancy number!

266
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,666
Was it 6666?
- Yes.- lt's mine.

267
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,083
He came with you,
you broke the window pane.

268
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,541
Car belongs to the girl,
why did you give my number?

269
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,083
Madam! Expensive window pane is broken!

270
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,541
Hello! ls your car window pane broken?
- Yes.

271
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,458
Buddy, the girl's phone.

272
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,583
My car window pane is broken,
this phone number was pasted on it.

273
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,541
lt didn't break, l broke it.

274
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:50,708
Why?
- Why did you park car in no parking zone?

275
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,249
What bothers you if l park it there?

276
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:54,833
Your car became a hurdle in
the movement of my life.

277
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,041
That's why l broke it.

278
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,249
Why did you leave a phone number?

279
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,791
lf you park like this again, to warn
l'll break another window pane too.

280
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,916
l don't have your number, right?
That's why l left my number there.

281
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,208
ls Switzerland better or Bangkok?

282
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,624
lf you're single Bangkok is right place,
for honeymoon, it's Switzerland.

283
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,416
Then, we'll go to Switzerland.

284
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:23,499
ls that Jubilee school better?

285
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,416
l think they won't admit you
at this age.

286
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,541
Not for me but for my forthcoming son!

287
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,666
Without confusing us with words
and dreams, come out with truth.

288
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,666
You saw the girl, right?

289
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,958
She's class like heroine of
Gowtham Menon's film,

290
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:38,666
and l'm a mass hero of Rajamouli
and VV Vinayak films.

291
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,124
By now, so many would be after her.

292
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,499
You didn't pocket the ball
but my heart.

293
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,999
lf you say yes..

294
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:51,749
One side credit cards and
other side debit cards!

295
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,874
Pay slip is in my pocket,
balance in my bank account,

296
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:57,124
l've a policy and
there's privacy in my flat!

297
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,333
l've plenty of hope in life.

298
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,374
You're there...

299
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,583
When l saw you
l realised this, my dear...

300
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,583
Love is sheer madness, my dear...

301
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,874
lf you refuse lell drown myself
in Hussain Sagar...

302
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,124
Do that first!

303
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,833
Now, you're...

304
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:14,249
Can l talk to you for two minutes?

305
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,041
Day before yesterday...

306
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,833
Why don't you accept?
Please accept me.

307
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:22,124
l'm elder to you.
- So what? Jessie too was elder to Karthik.

308
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,083
Will you come with me to Khandala?

309
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,124
At least to Gandipet?

310
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:39,541
Since we don't have the tradition
of being one among many!

311
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:43,499
What should l do to make her
register my face well?

312
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,541
Hereafter she'll have it...

313
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,624
We're visiting temple,
look after home carefully.

314
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,958
Oh no! She's here again with sweets!

315
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,833
What's this time, dear?

316
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,291
Offer them also,
they may get some sense.

317
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,624
Come, Asha!

318
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,583
We'll have, please sit down.

319
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,874
What sort of a husband do you prefer?
Please tell me.

320
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:16,249
Husband?

321
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,541
This subject isn't there
in my time table.

322
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,541
He mustn't smoke!

323
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,749
He mustn't drink!

324
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,499
Early morning he must kiss on
my forehead and wake me up.

325
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,749
Where?
- Forehead!

326
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:39,541
He must come home from office early,
cook food and feed me with his hands.

327
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,624
She wants him to cook too!

328
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,583
At night...
- Night?

329
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:49,833
He must hug me like a baby
and put me to sleep.

330
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,541
That's all!

331
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:55,041
lf so all his life he must...
- Buddy!

332
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,624
He'll have to hit his head!

333
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,874
ls it brain or bad word?

334
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,708
Can l leave now?
- You can go later.

335
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:07,291
lf you come here again with sweets
for getting 100 out of 100,

336
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:11,083
this time l'll write your exam too.

337
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,958
Our results would get withheld.

338
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,624
Your brother would wait for you
in America bus stand.

339
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,291
l'm in trouble now.

340
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:33,249
Who is she? Your friend?
Which college are you studying?

341
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,333
l'll not tell you.

342
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:36,749
You said you'll steal my hall ticket,
why should l tell you?

343
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,624
You mad girl! Whether you tell
or not, l'll do it.

344
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,958
No please!
l'll tell you.

345
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,958
Bunty, note down the name of college.

346
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:46,999
Okay.

347
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:05,999
Jesus, l must top college, this state...
l must get 100% marks.

348
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,874
Nobody else must come.
All others must fail.

349
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,749
There must be zero competition.

350
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,374
Why did you come here?

351
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,666
To hug your friend tightly.

352
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,249
l'll complain.
- l'll use your hall ticket number.

353
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,749
Take her place and
ask her to come back.

354
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,041
Very difficult, please.

355
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,749
Mad girl! Abdul Kalam said nothing is
impossible for a man if he decides.

356
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,124
When a man can walk on moon,
can't l put my hand her waist from here?

357
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,916
Let me try it.

358
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:13,874
Lord, forgive this sinner!

359
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,874
l broke your car window pane.

360
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,166
What should we do to make you
leave her alone? We'll do it.

361
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,041
lf you give a photo,
you'll not see me again.

362
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,624
Photo? Why my photo?

363
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,291
Let's give it,
we can study happily.

364
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,291
Come here.
- Me sir?

365
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,374
You're here with a photographer.
- For my family.

366
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,374
You mean should l put my hand
on her shoulder?

367
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,708
When did l say that?
Okay, you do it.

368
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:41,916
This is for him.

369
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,958
Let him do it,
after that good riddance.

370
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:44,958
Okay!

371
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,208
My parents saw this photo and said
why girl like her, she's great!

372
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,416
How about meeting your parents?

373
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:05,958
l'm not like other girls.
- l'm also not like other boys.

374
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:09,583
l'm high end model in men,
one of a kind. Hug me!

375
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:14,083
Tell me this clearly,
is love physical or psychological?

376
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,958
l'm asking you.
- Why did she corner me like this?

377
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:20,124
Tell me! Physical or psychological?

378
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:24,333
Physical gives psychological happiness.

379
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,416
Hey girl, that's law of nature!

380
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:59,958
O Laila, today l must make an
ever lasting impact on you...

381
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:07,583
O girl, we must pain the town red
with our love...

382
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:08,749
What l say is...

383
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,458
Don't ever say that l can't get
or have you...

384
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,916
My heart would burst
like cracker, babe...

385
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,416
Don't make faces like that, girl...

386
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:23,624
lf you do like that would
infuriate me...

387
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,166
Come, my life is with you only...

388
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,749
My heart is vacant for you only...

389
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:57,791
lf l blow whistle,
you're finished...

390
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:04,874
if l tie the knot,
it's bliss all the way...

391
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,333
l'll make you scream for
more love...

392
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:15,124
l'll rock you with pleasure...

393
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,208
What l say is...

394
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,833
lf you cook,
l'll cut onions for you...

395
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:23,416
l'll not let a tear drop
from your eyes...

396
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,999
l'll not see your messages
or missed calls...

397
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,749
l'll let you use FB or
Twitter accounts freely...

398
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:10,749
Your naughty waist is arresting men...

399
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:17,791
Don't challenge me,
l'm a stubborn man...

400
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,166
l'll be your pillow for the
nights you're sleepless...

401
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,208
lf you're angry, l'll say sorry
to become yor friend...

402
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:43,333
What l say is...

403
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:46,999
Don't prolong it like long
and winding TV soaps...

404
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,499
Don't change quite often
like Apple lphones...

405
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,999
l'm like land litigation,
can't do away so easily...

406
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,791
You can't find a better choice
than me even in Google search...

407
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:14,333
Please sit down.

408
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:18,208
Brother-in-law, we must be
very careful about security.

409
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,624
Send every person in after
a thorough check.

410
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,208
Give this access card to guests
along with marriage invitations.

411
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,958
Don't allow anyone without this card.

412
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:29,041
Even groom will not be allowed
inside without this card.

413
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,666
Great build up again!

414
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:31,791
Why all this, brother-in-law?

415
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,083
l've too many enemies in my business.

416
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:36,041
Bad people may also have money.

417
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,708
But all rich are not bad people, right?

418
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,958
Your younger daughter-in-law.

419
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:44,708
Tell me, dear.

420
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,416
l'm facing a lot of problem
from a boy here, father.

421
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,416
He's chasing and teasing me madly.

422
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:52,208
l'm confused and calling you, father.

423
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:55,166
Okay dear, l'll take care of it.

424
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,499
ls your sister there?
- Just a minute.

425
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,499
Hello bride! How are you dear?
- l'm fine, father.

426
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,208
Marriage is fast approaching,
be here as soon as possible.

427
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,749
Okay, father.

428
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:13,083
lt seems some boy is teasing
the younger one.

429
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,958
Tell our people in Hyderabad...
- Shall l bump him off?

430
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,541
This is common in a girl's life.

431
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,124
College boy, just cut his leg or hand.

432
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,208
What? Will you cut leg or hand
for teasing your daughter?

433
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,791
Had it been my brother Jagannadham,
he would've got him lynched.

434
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:32,208
lf l kill people for trivial issues,

435
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,833
l would've cut your head
on the day of engagement.

436
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,041
Give lights.
- Take it.

437
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,749
l asked lights.
- Smoke that lightly.

438
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,958
You're getting too leisure
to mouth punch dialogues.

439
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,208
You're cool today!

440
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:05,083
Why have you come like a family girl?
Changed your heart?

441
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,874
lt's your hobby to chase and
tease girls, right?

442
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:11,499
Not tease, my dear.
These are our sweet memories.

443
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:15,041
After we marry and have children
and they too have children,

444
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,666
when we reach the age of watching
Devotional channels instead of FTV,

445
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,499
when a grandson or
granddaughter comes to you,

446
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,499
and says grandma, please tell me
about your love story with grandpa.

447
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,083
There must be few sweet memories
to tell them, right? That's why!

448
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,791
Sweet memories, concept is good.

449
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,791
ln future if your son or grandson
chases a girl,

450
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,791
you would call him and say
this is wrong, sunny!

451
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,958
And if you do people will
break your limbs,

452
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,833
to tell this you too need
a sweet memory, right?

453
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:54,749
Uncle? Why do you call me uncle?

454
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,999
l'm here for settlement,
why do you call me uncle?

455
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,166
Can't you see my guts?

456
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:03,166
What's the matter, boy?
l'm getting too many complaints on you.

457
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:04,499
l'll stab you.

458
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,458
He looks like a pirated DVD seller.
Who is he?

459
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,166
Are you asking who am l?

460
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:14,166
Am l here for a settlement
without knowing about me?

461
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:21,291
What's this settlement without
both of the parties knowing each other?

462
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,708
Your balance is very low,
please recharge immediately.

463
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:29,416
l'll do it. We settle so many things,
can't l do this?

464
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,708
You cut the call.

465
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,999
Why not? My uncle's name in Guntur
will ensure 104, you know that?

466
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,083
What's this 104?

467
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:38,999
Fever...104 fever on hearing my name.

468
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,791
l'll stab you!

469
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,916
Why are you talking to this kid?
Kill him!

470
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:54,916
lf anyone dares call me kid,
l'll strip them and beat!

471
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:59,916
You should've the right to call me
like that or should be my fan.

472
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,999
Did you see his arrogance?
l don't know what you do,

473
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,124
He mustn't come after me again.

474
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,124
Do you know to fight?
ls the matter so serious?

475
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:07,791
Buddy!

476
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:14,208
Whether its song or fight for this girl,
it's my prerogative.

477
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,749
You stay out of it, boys.

478
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:32,749
Twist...twist it like that!
His nerves must break.

479
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,416
Poor man may die.
Please leave him.

480
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,499
Madam told you, right?
Take your leg off me.

481
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,749
l was after you for many days,

482
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,999
just to check if you've any
sympathy for me or not,

483
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,249
l let these jokers to beat me
for a while.

484
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,416
Poor man may die, please leave him,
how cutely you said this!

485
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:59,208
This teaser is enough!

486
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,833
l'll show them the full film!

487
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:39,958
To hell with your individuality!

488
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:43,374
Attack him united, boys!

489
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,166
Not yet been hit!
- Yes, brother.

490
00:46:58,417 --> 00:46:59,416
lt'll hit you now.

491
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,374
Who are you, kiddo?
- Student...student...

492
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,291
Which college?
- EAMCET college.

493
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,833
Eamcet is not a college.
- Please don't beat me, brother.

494
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,083
What about you, man?

495
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:57,958
What's this nasty fight?
Why are you hitting so harshly?

496
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,583
Don't beat them!

497
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:02,874
lf you hit sensitive part,
how can they marry?

498
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:05,458
Who would answer their parents?

499
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:07,291
Your name raises temperature
to 104, right?

500
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:09,624
Who said that?
He said that.

501
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,791
How can anyone get fever on watching
another man, very strange!

502
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,458
One must get love and affection.

503
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,208
Why did you call me for a settlement
with a man who can fight?

504
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:23,291
lf you go overboard
this will be the result.

505
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:27,083
l'll answer like this to
hundred goons also,

506
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:29,624
but l don't know
how to express my love.

507
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,791
What?
- Start the bike.

508
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:55,374
Today's girl is like a wild stream,

509
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:58,166
any man would get carried away
in that flow,

510
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,666
but l didn't want to get drowned
and to tie the knot with you,

511
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:03,124
and to catch your attention,
l did all this,

512
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,958
certainly not to tease you.

513
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,791
Buddy! That's way l wanted to impress her.
What do you say?

514
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,458
Aren't you doing this sincerely, buddy?

515
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:13,749
Mad boy, knowing her likes
and get into her...

516
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,208
Buddy!

517
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:18,333
l mean her heart not her bedroom!

518
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:21,083
ls that brain or bad word?

519
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,249
To know what she likes,
we must steal her diary.

520
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,541
Asha Jyothi told she has
the habit ofwriting diary.

521
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,458
May you get blessed with
a chilled beer!

522
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:33,499
What great news!
You're bore at times.

523
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,666
Other times?
- lrritating!

524
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,833
No need to wait anymore, Ranjith.

525
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,374
Round up the girl,
get that diary...

526
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:20,249
Chinna, get my phone.

527
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,666
l gave the complaint.

528
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:34,416
Why don't you increase the
speed of internet?

529
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:36,083
Be update!

530
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,999
ls that internet boy here?

531
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,874
He's here, Baby.
Are you done?

532
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,291
Excuse me, please lock the door,
people are entering at will.

533
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:51,458
Okay, you go.

534
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,833
Buddy!

535
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,541
My thoughts!

536
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,458
Title is great.
- Super!

537
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:01,333
Luck will knock our door.
But we bring the bad luck by choice.

538
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:03,041
Buddy, this diary...

539
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:07,458
There's a woman behind every man's success.

540
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:10,166
Yes, girls go after successful men only.

541
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,999
Well said, son!

542
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,958
My prince charming must ride a horse!

543
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,291
He must rebel against law!
He mustjump on clouds!

544
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:20,041
Must take me around stars!

545
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:22,041
ln moonlight...Oh my God!

546
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,624
Her wishes have no end.

547
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:27,374
l can't do all this but l'll do few
l can do and make her fall for me.

548
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:28,958
You do it.

549
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:31,749
Who took it?
Where is it?

550
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,499
Nobody has discipline here.

551
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,999
What's this Baby?
Why are you shouting?

552
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:36,499
You don't update and
let me update myself.

553
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,999
What happened, Baby?

554
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,958
Gone...my life!
My everything!

555
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,791
My life!
Everything is gone.

556
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,666
What exactly that is?

557
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,749
Diary!

558
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,458
Quarry of my dreams.

559
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,208
Where did l keep that diary?

560
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:25,166
Prince who rides horse!

561
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,791
Why did you get down, grandma?

562
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,958
Come, Prince!
Get down!

563
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:37,958
We've been waiting for clients
since morning.

564
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,458
You're here at right time.

565
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,374
Where's your license?
Where's the RC book of horse?

566
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:45,208
Where's the chassis number?
There are many issues like this.

567
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:50,166
You're asking chassis number of
a horse, are you humans?

568
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,583
Do you think isn't there anyone
to go against your law?

569
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,291
l'm there!

570
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:59,624
l'll ride the horse,
l'll go against you.

571
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:00,958
What the hell are you saying?

572
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,083
Man who rebels against law!

573
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,958
l've my horse!
Horses have my support.

574
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:14,791
He looks like a man on mission.
l must meet him.

575
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:18,083
No grandma, he's not a good man.
l know him very well.

576
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:21,333
You know him?
Then, l want him.

577
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:22,666
Grandma?

578
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,458
He's getting glamorous with
every passing day!

579
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:43,374
Buddy, Akarsha is here.

580
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,291
l think my plan is working.
You keep silent.

581
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:47,624
When she nears, you start it.

582
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,499
Why did you ride the horse
and sing old songs?

583
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:52,999
Why are you getting into
black and white days?

584
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,041
What has happened to you?

585
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,791
Would life be colourful without Akarsha?
lt'll be black and white.

586
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,249
Anyway who bothers what we do!
That's why l rode a horse.

587
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:04,624
Don't know what life is!

588
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,458
See, someone is calling.

589
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:07,374
You...

590
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:16,958
Music is lilting in heart
raking up myriad ofwishes...

591
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,208
Hey, stop the radio.
l'm getting unwanted feelings.

592
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,749
Why did you come back?
l'm staying away from you, right?

593
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:36,208
Please don't say like that,
you must come to dine in my home.

594
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,708
Are you planning to kill me
by poisoning my food?

595
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,374
Again...
- l mean goon attack failed.

596
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,749
Please forget about that incident.

597
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,374
Watching you ride horse...
- watching it?

598
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:54,708
Watching you ride horse and
take on traffic police...

599
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:56,041
lt has worked out.

600
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,708
l mean l got it.

601
00:55:57,917 --> 00:55:59,708
You're inviting for a dinner
at home, right?

602
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:01,624
Actually my grandma...

603
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,624
Whether you cook or your grandma cooks,
l'm coming for the dinner.

604
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,041
No...

605
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,583
Let's discuss other things over dinner.

606
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:16,833
You'll definitely come, right?
- Yes.

607
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,249
lf you don't come,
it's a promise on my grandma.

608
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,041
Why is she talking about grandma?

609
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:32,041
Those who are away from mothers
get attached to grandmas.

610
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,749
Don't we watch in films?

611
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,083
Ajasmine twig in the
courtyard of Seethamma...

612
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:41,124
Tomorrow l'll step into their home...

613
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,166
Are you sure he would make it?

614
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:53,249
l said it's promise on my grandma
if he fails to turn up.

615
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:56,624
lf he comes it means
he loves me, right?

616
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,041
He'll definitely come, grandma.

617
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,583
Do you think that's him?

618
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:21,999
Come in.

619
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:23,624
Please sit down.

620
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:26,541
She's getting ready,
will be here in 2 minutes.

621
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,708
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

622
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,458
Would you like to have soft drinks?

623
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,416
My grandma!

624
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,083
Look, how she got ready for you.
- For me? Why?

625
00:57:48,709 --> 00:57:51,208
l must match your dress, right?

626
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:54,999
Match with my dress?
Why?

627
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,666
My grandma is writing a love story
since 1942,

628
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,916
she lost her diary recently.

629
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:06,833
Yes, she titles it as My thoughts!
Poor woman!

630
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:12,958
Was that grandma's diary?

631
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,541
Will you tell everything yourself?

632
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:21,541
Forget about losing my diary,
l found my dream boy in you, right?

633
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,874
Yes, l did get caught.

634
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:32,749
l wanted her diary,
will you bring her grandma's diary?

635
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,708
Are you also lost in past?

636
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:37,624
No, into the future.

637
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,499
A drink with you.

638
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:47,791
Have it.

639
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,666
lf you don't mind,
just once with you...

640
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,916
What?
- Just one dance!

641
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,708
For grandma's sake, please.

642
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:18,041
One flight is in air, you've to
adjust, you can'tjump down.

643
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:42,749
Come, let me see your love...

644
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,708
Oh God, your rejection...

645
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:56,916
Come...come...come...

646
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:03,833
Come, l'm your love...

647
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:09,666
Oh God, your rejection...

648
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:17,666
Come...come...come...

649
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:40,333
Grandma!

650
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,208
What happened?

651
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,708
You get some water.

652
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,916
Careful, grandma.

653
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,583
Dancing with me isn't as easy as
having a drink with me.

654
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:03,208
Same eyes!

655
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,249
Same neck!

656
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:22,291
Same face!

657
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:35,416
ln my black and white days,
l loved a great man who looked like you.

658
01:01:36,084 --> 01:01:40,833
But l came to know he was
already married,

659
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:45,291
so l remained a spinster.

660
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:51,416
Had l married, l would be having
a grandson like you.

661
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:52,916
Grandma!

662
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,583
l don't like anyone calling me grandma.

663
01:01:57,542 --> 01:02:00,666
When you call me,
l feel very happy, grandson.

664
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:05,624
Will you come at times to meet
this old woman, right?

665
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:11,124
l mean l won't live long.
- Why, grandma?

666
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:13,416
l'll go to bed now.

667
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,666
You have dinner and go.

668
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:30,458
l always thought grandma was u[dating,
l didn't know she was adjusting.

669
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:35,208
She always changed according to time
but never insisted us to change.

670
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,124
She never forced us to take her path.

671
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,666
You're the first man to go in
her way and understand her.

672
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:47,708
Let's have dinner.

673
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,958
No, please.
l feel content.

674
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,416
What's this grandma?

675
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,416
When you said meet in the evening,
l expected disco or dinner.

676
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,249
Why did you bring me to
a temple, grandma?

677
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:22,958
lsn't it? l told them many times but
they never update themselves.

678
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:24,124
What can l do?

679
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,166
Can't you take me also to
the marriage, grandma?

680
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:27,958
Why? What will you do there?

681
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:32,541
Once you marry and go away,
l can't spend time with you, right?

682
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:36,166
Will you miss me?
Are you joking?

683
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,666
Grandma, please come here.

684
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:41,958
Grandma!
- Grandma!

685
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,791
lt's over...over...

686
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,416
Did you see how you got saved
from a danger?

687
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,083
l can't let you go alone
to marriage without me.

688
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,499
What will they look after you?
l'll take care of you, grandma.

689
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,541
Okay, don't cry! As the bride,
l'm inviting you. Come.

690
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:07,791
Yadagiri, see what he wants.

691
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:12,958
You place the order,
l'll come back in a minute.

692
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,249
How hot the Sun is!

693
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,666
Leave her!

694
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,291
Check everyone.
- Yes sir.

695
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:30,749
You go, l'll park the car
and follow you.

696
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,958
Okay, Nandu!

697
01:06:32,709 --> 01:06:36,083
Pigeon is married to cage...

698
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:40,541
Do you know who am l?

699
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,874
lt's an order not to allow anyone
without access card, sir.

700
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,916
What a great build up!

701
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:45,791
Go, sir.

702
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,624
What's this access cards
for kinsmen too?

703
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:52,791
Thank God, they didn't ask ration card
for feast and Aadhar card for gifts.

704
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:58,666
lt's an order not to allow anyone
without access card, sir.

705
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,041
Nandu, stop!

706
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:05,999
Please come sir.

707
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:22,041
Your son is very handsome.
Why not fix up a good match?

708
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,499
We must get a good proposal, right?

709
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,708
Ain't l here for that?
l've a brother Jagannadham...

710
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:31,958
You've done a good job,
l don't know how to thank you.

711
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:33,749
Please don't use such big words, sir.

712
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,583
You didn't save my daughter,
you saved my life.

713
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:41,416
lf anyone teases girls, you must kill him,
why did you leave them easily?

714
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:44,083
You told me now, right?
Next time, l'll kill him.

715
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:47,166
Leave him, you get freshen up.

716
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:07,291
Young man wouldn't leave me alone,
he bit me like an ant...

717
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:21,541
Buddha like boy wants kisses,
he went bonkers around my cheeks...

718
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:29,999
You're a sandalwood doll...
why are you feeling so shy?

719
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:34,874
You're a beautiful girl,
don't slip away like soap from hands...

720
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:37,208
You're captivating sweet
and arrows of flowers...

721
01:08:37,459 --> 01:08:40,749
Don't prick my heart with
your dart like eyes...

722
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,124
lf you rein in the youthful zest,
won't desires start to beg...

723
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,208
Just with one look you flattened
this 25 years old moustache...

724
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,666
l'll hug you for 15 minutes...

725
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,416
Even a measure of honey won't
be that sweet...

726
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:27,041
lt disturbs me somewhere...
- When while marble dove like you smiles...

727
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:31,958
l'm a doe-eyed tender beauty,
your laser like eyes are pricking me...

728
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,416
l'm a glass doll and you've trapped me
with bait not letting me fall down...

729
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:40,791
Don't feel shy, you've won...

730
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,291
Mischievous girl...beautiful girl...

731
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,124
Don't wish for the slipping
heart of the man...

732
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,958
ls the moon in skrt wishing
for marriage?

733
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:39,124
ls the damsel wishing for
a beauty spot on cheek?

734
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,541
Milk is boiling and
spilling on stove...

735
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,958
ls it the expectation of
festivities ahead?

736
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:48,291
The bed is spread with flowers...
expecting something to happen...

737
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:52,874
Don't arrest me with the
shackles of your beauty...

738
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:58,749
Your thin waist is raising heat...
Don't add fuel to it by winking...

739
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:06,916
Who is it?

740
01:12:08,334 --> 01:12:09,458
Your death!

741
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:10,874
What the hell are you saying?

742
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:14,083
We attacked your daughter in
the roadside eatery.

743
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,166
Some guy saved her life.

744
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,958
This time nobody can save you.

745
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:24,166
we'll kill you exactly in one hour.

746
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:30,708
What happened, uncle?

747
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:35,124
Nothing, elder daughter has
just left home.

748
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,874
When daughter leaves home after marriage,
there must be tears in eyes,

749
01:12:38,084 --> 01:12:40,124
one mustn't sweat in tension!
Please tell me, what has happened?

750
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,541
A small disturbance in business.

751
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,124
Small disturbance!

752
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:47,416
Attack on Akarsha in the eatery
isn't a small disturbance.

753
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:50,458
Marriage must happen amidst relatives
not among bodyguards,

754
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:51,958
this is not a small disturbance,

755
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,624
if one phone call can shake you up,
it isn't a small disturbance, uncle.

756
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,083
Please tell me, uncle.

757
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:10,916
Forget about them,
just forget about them.

758
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:15,291
Whether you like it or not,
l love Akarsha.

759
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:20,624
l'm ready to give or sacrifice
my life for her and her family.

760
01:13:22,334 --> 01:13:24,249
Uncle, l've never taken life seriously.

761
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:27,958
l want to see how would it
be if do take it.

762
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:30,416
They gave you an hour, right?

763
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:34,666
lf l don't show their place
within this hour...

764
01:13:36,209 --> 01:13:38,083
There's no doubt of doing it.

765
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,041
Why did you call here, brother-in-law?

766
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:03,749
lf some man calls on phone,
should we change place like cowards?

767
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,541
This is not cowardice
but taking precautions.

768
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:10,333
Since groom's people have left,
they wouldn't expect us here.

769
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:11,791
What about the women there?

770
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,666
lf they were after women,

771
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,166
they wouldn't have attacked uncle
after engagement,

772
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:17,916
and call him after the
marriage is over.

773
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:22,666
Since they've warned before striking,
it means they know the place very well.

774
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,916
This is new place and
they'll think twice to come here.

775
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:29,083
lf they take risk and come here...

776
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:32,291
Not one man would go alive from here.

777
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,791
Why do you take him seriously,
brother-in-law?

778
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,916
Aren't we here for you?
What the hell can he do alone?

779
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:37,874
Didn't you study as kids?

780
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:42,208
A spoonful of cow is better than
a pot full of donkey's milk.

781
01:14:42,459 --> 01:14:45,499
You mean?
- l expected you wouldn't have studied.

782
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:48,458
Though there are umpteen donkeys here,

783
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:52,999
they can't match for horse
to run or attack.

784
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,583
lfwe kill you directly,
you'll die peacefully.

785
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,458
You must die a death every moment
till you die really.

786
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:27,999
That's why we're warning
before killing you.

787
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,916
Who are you guys?
Who are you?

788
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:50,249
Who are you threatening?

789
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,583
A real killer won't threaten
so many times.

790
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:57,166
He would see angrily into his eyes
and unsheathes a sword,

791
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:58,541
and kills him!

792
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,833
Who are you guys?

793
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,499
Try to remember...recollect!

794
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:57,958
Are you from the family of lAS officer
l killed for power project?

795
01:18:58,209 --> 01:18:59,166
More please.

796
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,583
More...

797
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,958
Wiped out entire family of MRO
for a road project.

798
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,583
Are you from his family?

799
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:10,708
You've done countless mistakes
and murders you can't remember!

800
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:12,833
lt's not a mistake to kill you.

801
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:15,541
Do you remember Adityapuram?

802
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,999
Do you remember the people of that place?

803
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,833
Do you remember Ammulu?

804
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:42,583
Ammulu?

805
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:48,499
l beg at your feet!

806
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,541
l accept what l did in that
matter is wrong,

807
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,124
not wrong but a dastardly act,

808
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:54,958
l agree what l did is wrong,

809
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:58,249
please forgive me,

810
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,416
please forgive me!

811
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:04,041
Only God can forgive humans!

812
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:07,791
l'm not God and
l don't know to forgive!

813
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,708
Meet your parents once...

814
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:49,916
Why not take me also with you
to the marriage?

815
01:21:59,084 --> 01:22:00,833
Murdered man isn't an ordinary man.

816
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,499
Musallapadu Nagabhushanam.
- A contractor and an industrialist.

817
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:05,874
This is official.

818
01:22:06,084 --> 01:22:09,458
unofficially he's a proxy
to many a politicians.

819
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,666
Whatever it is, we must do our duty.

820
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:14,583
This time sincerely.

821
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,166
He was attacked despite tight security,
the attacker is not an ordinary man.

822
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:27,499
Ever since l remember l spent most of
my time away from father for studies.

823
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:32,166
l completed my studies now
but father is no more.

824
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:37,749
My father used to say as property grows
enemies too grow with it.

825
01:22:40,334 --> 01:22:42,833
l tried a lot to save uncle but...

826
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:47,208
l'll not spare...
l'll not spare anyone.

827
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,666
No Nandu! Whatever you may do,
you can't bring back my dead father.

828
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,374
lf l lose you also in this effort,

829
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,041
l can't bear it.

830
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,583
Three months later...

831
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,041
Theirs is Adityapuram, my native place.

832
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:13,583
You're worrying about other's welfare.

833
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,541
Just do what l say!

834
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,041
Adityapuram means...

835
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,166
This marriage won't happen.

836
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:24,333
They both are made for each other.

837
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:25,749
Grandpa!

838
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:33,083
Why did you come to college on Sunday too?

839
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:35,041
Grandma is making desperate calls.

840
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:37,541
You're not seen,
where am l to search for you?

841
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,583
Grandma, found him.
Take it, talk to her.

842
01:23:41,834 --> 01:23:45,291
Where did you go away, grandson?
ls this the way to love?

843
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:49,541
Will you leave her alone in
this situation too?

844
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,083
l'm unable to forget the
incident so easily.

845
01:23:52,334 --> 01:23:56,541
Today is her birthday, she hasn't
eaten anything since morning.

846
01:23:56,875 --> 01:24:00,958
lf not to wish her,
come at least to comfort her.

847
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:07,541
How long will you sit like that?
No need of any party.

848
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,374
Just cut the cake, that's all.

849
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:12,124
Please, l'm hungry too.

850
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:14,083
Please leave me alone.

851
01:24:14,334 --> 01:24:15,958
Can't you understand if she says
to leave her alone?

852
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:31,333
lf not for your sake,
at least for your friends...

853
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,624
Try to understand.

854
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,791
l must understand everyone.
Nobody will understand me.

855
01:24:37,334 --> 01:24:39,124
Today is my dad's birthday too.

856
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:41,583
We both share the same birthday!

857
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:08,124
O Moon, you tell her...tell her..

858
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:12,083
She's not listening to us...

859
01:25:12,334 --> 01:25:16,249
O star, look at her once...

860
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,749
Make your sister to talk...

861
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,791
Will you come down from the clouds?

862
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,791
Singing sweet tunes...

863
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,749
The would become cool breeze...

864
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,416
This night should sing lullaby
to put her to sleep...

865
01:26:35,084 --> 01:26:42,833
ln the world of dark clouds,
a hope of lightning is hidden somewhere...

866
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:50,166
ln the cauldron of long hot summer,
a hope of cool drizzle falls some day...

867
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:54,708
There are people who love you
more than their life...

868
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:58,958
Be happy and spread cheer...

869
01:26:59,209 --> 01:27:07,166
People up there, your near and
dear ones want your to smile...

870
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:44,833
Who says smiling is wrong?
How can you say no to smile?

871
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:49,416
Who says it is wrong to
spend some time happily?

872
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:52,208
Will you please give me
their details?

873
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:56,749
Won't branches and
stalks come if you call?

874
01:27:56,959 --> 01:28:00,958
Won't it give whatever you ask fondly?

875
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:05,041
People who are not with you
are all around you...

876
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:09,374
See them with your heart once...

877
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:40,166
l'm ACP from Crime branch.

878
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,083
Please tell me.

879
01:28:41,334 --> 01:28:43,833
l want to discuss with you
about your father's murder.

880
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,249
Can you please come to my office tomorrow?
- Okay, sir.

881
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:20,249
Why are you scaring him?

882
01:29:21,042 --> 01:29:25,833
He's our family friend,
he's investigating dad's murder case.

883
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:29,124
He wanted to meet the main witness,
so l brought him here.

884
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,374
He threatened me yesterday
just like this.

885
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:36,041
Boys, leave us alone for few minutes.

886
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,541
ln our training,

887
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,458
they ask us to start the investigation
from why shouldn't the witness be culprit angle?

888
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:44,791
l tried to see your reaction.
l don't see any reaction, why?

889
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,749
l don't react unless something
happens of my range.

890
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,208
Your number?

891
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:52,499
He never uses phone.
He won't listen to anyone.

892
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:57,124
lt's almost 200 years since
telephone was invented.

893
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,249
But still you...

894
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,499
l hate talking in air and
telling lies!

895
01:30:02,834 --> 01:30:05,166
lf l want to meet anyone,
l'll meet at any cost.

896
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:07,791
Anyone who wants to meet me
can meet me.

897
01:30:08,334 --> 01:30:11,708
You don't get so easily.
- What's the use to get?

898
01:30:11,959 --> 01:30:14,458
l mean l'm not running away, right?
- l'll get you.

899
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,291
You need to keep this for me
to disturb you at any time.

900
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:20,333
l said l don't need it.
- But it is necessary to me.

901
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:21,416
Keep it.

902
01:30:36,209 --> 01:30:40,124
Nagabhushanam was already attacked once.

903
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:43,208
Yes sir, while coming from
his daughter' s engagement.

904
01:30:43,459 --> 01:30:47,124
Find immediately those who witnessed it
or got wounded in the incident.

905
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,583
l must meet them.

906
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:51,374
Every minute clue must come
to my notice.

907
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,249
Why did you call me here?

908
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,749
l don't know, Avinash wanted me
to bring you here urgently.

909
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,458
lt seems he has found
some clue in dad's case.

910
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,208
Do you recognise them?

911
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,416
What? Look at them closely.

912
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,208
They were the guys who first
attacked uncle.

913
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,958
They missed him,
so they made a second attempt.

914
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,583
l'm sure they did it.
What do you say?

915
01:31:51,292 --> 01:31:53,958
First time they missed him,
fearing people would recognise them,

916
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:55,791
they may have sent others, right?

917
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,583
Think over it.

918
01:32:04,459 --> 01:32:09,291
l'm thinking like a police man.
You're thinking like a criminal.

919
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:11,499
Criminal?
- Not that Nandu...

920
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,166
What?

921
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:16,624
You call me here as you wish.
You say investigation!

922
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,916
You thrust phone on us without bothering
about our likes and dislikes.

923
01:32:19,084 --> 01:32:21,833
What do you think of me?

924
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,999
No, they hacked uncle with swords
right before my eyes...

925
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,583
l was a mere spectator
without helping him.

926
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:34,333
His death is still happening before
my eyes and these police too...

927
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:36,874
l'm dazed.

928
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:43,999
You too are a member of my family.

929
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:51,166
Keeping this case aside,
shall we all go out for lunch?

930
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:52,583
For my sake.

931
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:56,041
l'll not in your police jeep
like an accused.

932
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:58,958
l'll come in your car.
Please take me.

933
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,208
Greetings, sir.

934
01:33:19,459 --> 01:33:20,249
Do you know him?

935
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:22,416
How can l not know him, sir?

936
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:29,374
l'm coming.

937
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:32,249
Our families want me and
Akarsha to marry.

938
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,583
There's age gap

939
01:33:33,834 --> 01:33:37,499
But any girl would wish for
a well settled husband, right?

940
01:33:37,709 --> 01:33:38,624
l must think.

941
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,708
Congrats? Aren't you feeling bad?

942
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:46,874
You and Akarsha are...
- Not so much to feel bad.

943
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:52,958
How do you know Akarsha then?
You're not from same college too.

944
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,624
There's a girl Asha Jyothi
who resides in my building,

945
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,708
she's Akarsha's college mate,
l became friend like that.

946
01:33:57,917 --> 01:34:01,791
Did Asha introduce you
or got introduced yourself?

947
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:04,541
She introduced me.
- ls it?

948
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:06,291
lf she refuses to give
Akarsha's details.

949
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:10,291
Why did you threaten Asha with
changing hall ticket number?

950
01:34:15,459 --> 01:34:18,958
l didn't say it seriously.
lt was a casual joke.

951
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,249
You joke casually but fight seriously.

952
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:25,208
Well built strong body guards
and security men died,

953
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:27,999
but you were left alive, right?

954
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,416
Beating is different from killing.

955
01:34:30,584 --> 01:34:33,499
One who beats is angry,
one who kills is with vengeance.

956
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,166
we can stop even 100 angry men,

957
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:40,999
we can't stop even one man
who is seeking vengeance.0

958
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:43,624
But you're not alone but three people.

959
01:34:46,334 --> 01:34:48,749
Once your people's sketches were ready,
we sent it to neighouring states,

960
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,124
we came to know a lot about you
and your family.

961
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:56,958
Wow! What a great act
you just put up!

962
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:01,416
l agree, you're a great actor!

963
01:35:04,084 --> 01:35:05,249
You planned it so well,

964
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,958
how could you believe the lie
about my marriage with Akarsha?

965
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:10,041
You dodged questions
and got caught with me.

966
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:13,958
lf you surrender before Akarsha comes,
l'll take you respectfully.

967
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,374
lf not l'll drag you.

968
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:47,166
Akarsha! Don't trust him,
he killed your father.

969
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:51,333
lf you act smart,
l'll kill her also.

970
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:55,499
You can't catch me,
l'll meet you when time comes.

971
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,374
Don't commit another crime.

972
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:21,916
l went mad and got closer to you.

973
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:25,166
l personally took you to the marriage.
l killed my father.

974
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:27,833
l'm responsible for
everything that happened.

975
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,458
You took me?

976
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,583
l got closer to you myself.
l gained your trust.

977
01:37:32,834 --> 01:37:36,166
l killed your father with
a well laid out plan.

978
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:39,249
l should've killed your father
in your sister's engagement.

979
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,041
Missed the bastard.
Moreover he saw my men.

980
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:44,041
That's why l had to come personally.

981
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:46,208
How could you kill such a good man?

982
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:48,458
How would you know about
what my father did to so many people?

983
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:51,958
You don't know what your father
did with so many people!

984
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,083
But l know.

985
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:58,249
Your father is so great to forget his
own son's death for the sake of money.

986
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:07,499
To know about what goodness is,
you must know about Adityapuram.

987
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:14,499
You must know about its people's
happiness and their innocence.

988
01:38:21,959 --> 01:38:24,583
You must know about great Ammulu.

989
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,791
Bangalore - Though we're Telugu people,
we settled in Bangalore.

990
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,583
Elder brothers used to look
after business,

991
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:43,499
l was studying in Hyderabad.

992
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,708
We lost our parents as children,
our grandpa raised us.

993
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:49,666
Don't stop with pudding,
there are sweets too.

994
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:50,666
What's this, sister-in-law?

995
01:38:50,917 --> 01:38:52,499
lt's grandpa's birthday,
why are you forcing me to eat sweets?

996
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:53,541
What's this, grandpa?

997
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:56,833
You come here once a year,
that too on my birthday.

998
01:38:57,042 --> 01:39:00,083
We wait all through the year
for this day.

999
01:39:01,084 --> 01:39:03,208
Will you please emotions and
step into entertainment?

1000
01:39:03,459 --> 01:39:05,166
Let's take a group photo.

1001
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:11,583
Got a phone call from your mother's
native place Adityapuram.

1002
01:39:11,792 --> 01:39:18,124
Your mother used to organise
Rama Navami festival grandly there.

1003
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:22,749
That tradition and honour
went away with her.

1004
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,333
Then, l'll go this time, grandpa.

1005
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,499
Will you go?

1006
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,583
Yes, you said seeing Adityapuram
is like seeing my mother.

1007
01:39:31,834 --> 01:39:32,916
That's why l'll go.

1008
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,791
l left to Adityapuram with my friends.

1009
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,124
lt'll be great walking in slow motion...

1010
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,499
Buddy, ifwe don't board the train
at right time,

1011
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,958
they say we miss a life time, right?

1012
01:40:35,209 --> 01:40:36,958
They do but we got into the train, right?
What's in it for us?

1013
01:40:37,209 --> 01:40:41,041
Likewise if we don't get down from train
at right time, we'll miss life itself.

1014
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:43,874
Did you see any girl?
- She wasn't an ordinary girl.

1015
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:47,416
As soon as l saw her, entire world
came to a standstill.

1016
01:40:56,667 --> 01:41:00,333
You finish rest of the journey
carefully with my memories.

1017
01:41:00,709 --> 01:41:05,583
Wave of beauty...my dream girl...

1018
01:41:19,417 --> 01:41:23,708
How can you say no to priority RAC
numbers and allot berths to them.

1019
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:27,333
Their father is richest in district
and with political power too.

1020
01:41:27,584 --> 01:41:28,999
l can't go against them.

1021
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:31,958
You don't so anything.
Only rich rule this land!

1022
01:41:32,167 --> 01:41:35,208
Arrogance of money power!

1023
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,708
You take my berth.

1024
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:40,666
Thank you.
- No problem. You sit there.

1025
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:42,374
l'll adjust here.

1026
01:41:42,584 --> 01:41:43,458
She's dynamic!

1027
01:41:43,709 --> 01:41:45,458
Not she's dynamite,
go near and she'll go off.

1028
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:48,124
Whatever it may be,
no need to wait anymore, Ranjith.

1029
01:41:48,334 --> 01:41:50,291
We must round her up and trap her.

1030
01:41:57,959 --> 01:42:00,749
Buddy, you'll rock with our act, right?
- Rock it.

1031
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,374
You're going to see NTR and SVR in me.

1032
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:06,874
No need of multi star films,
fix to one star.

1033
01:42:07,084 --> 01:42:09,208
l've already fixed.

1034
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:13,583
What's this?
Come out...come out...

1035
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:15,749
Come out l say!
- Sir!

1036
01:42:16,167 --> 01:42:19,708
Why are you not afraid or
respect me anymore?

1037
01:42:19,959 --> 01:42:22,958
l told you to get bottle at Ankannapalem,
will you get it from Venkayyapalem?

1038
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:25,791
Some Palem l did get the
bottle, right sir?

1039
01:42:26,334 --> 01:42:30,166
l told you to get cool bottle,
are you arguing with me?

1040
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:31,458
Come closer, my neck is hurting.

1041
01:42:31,709 --> 01:42:35,291
l thought you're a good boy and
my grandson and would be useful...

1042
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:37,916
You're going overboard, fool.
- Ain't l?

1043
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:41,874
You don't have berth in this train
and you're not worth to work for me.

1044
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:43,958
This is unjust!
Gross injustice, sir.

1045
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:46,666
Please don't throw me out, sir. Sir!

1046
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:00,666
l'm in no way related to you, get out!

1047
01:43:17,459 --> 01:43:20,541
What happened?
- Please leave me alone for some time.

1048
01:43:24,042 --> 01:43:26,374
Leave me doesn't mean completely leave me.

1049
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:29,041
Did you see how angry he got for
not getting chilled water?

1050
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:30,041
Who is he?

1051
01:43:30,292 --> 01:43:33,291
He's grandson of Raja Rao Bahadur
Ramachandra Naidu.

1052
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:36,749
That means he's from Adityapuram,
my native place.

1053
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:38,041
ls it?

1054
01:43:38,292 --> 01:43:41,083
lt's been years since they left the place.

1055
01:43:41,709 --> 01:43:42,916
Who are you?

1056
01:43:44,292 --> 01:43:47,833
Whether my boss wants water bottle
or liquor bottle,

1057
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:50,666
whether he wants breakfast
or bed spreads,

1058
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:52,416
l've to take care of all his needs.

1059
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:56,874
They say l'm a servant.
l say l'm a worker.

1060
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,874
Arrogance...arrogance of money.

1061
01:43:59,084 --> 01:44:01,999
They need servants even to travel
in train for few hours.

1062
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:07,916
l came to get water bottle and
while coming, l saw and fell for you.

1063
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:09,624
What?

1064
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,791
l mean l got attracted
by your fight with TC.

1065
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:15,124
Okay, please sit here.

1066
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:19,708
Why do you worry about others so much?

1067
01:44:19,959 --> 01:44:23,208
You want to take the path of
Mother Teresa, right?

1068
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:26,499
When hurt, even animals cry.

1069
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,374
One who cries for other man's hurt
is human.

1070
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,666
l've been watching them for long time.

1071
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:38,958
Where are you going?
Please stop.

1072
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:43,291
What's this nuisance?
People are sleeping.

1073
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:46,666
What should we do for it?

1074
01:44:47,292 --> 01:44:48,499
Should we sing lullabies?

1075
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,291
You calm down.
l mean it'll be good if you also sleep.

1076
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,083
Good for whom?

1077
01:44:53,417 --> 01:44:54,124
For you?

1078
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,833
lfwe all sleep what would you both do?

1079
01:44:58,167 --> 01:44:59,708
What's that nonsense?

1080
01:44:59,959 --> 01:45:01,208
How dare!

1081
01:45:05,334 --> 01:45:08,124
Please don't raise hand on a girl, sir.
You please go, l'll manage.

1082
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:09,291
Please go.
- No...

1083
01:45:09,542 --> 01:45:11,833
Go, l'll tell them.
Go...come sir.

1084
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:12,749
Actually...

1085
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,083
Please give me an opportunity,
please go...go...

1086
01:45:16,334 --> 01:45:20,416
Come, let's do as we please.
Come sir...come.

1087
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:26,124
So, that's it.

1088
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:28,708
Please sleep...sleep well.

1089
01:45:31,834 --> 01:45:34,374
They went silent,
what did you do with them?

1090
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:37,124
l told them about me in detail.

1091
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:39,708
Did you tell them about working
with Raja Ramachandra Naidu?

1092
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:41,083
That's it.

1093
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:16,333
Adityapuram

1094
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:22,083
Ammulu? She's daughter of
our school teacher.

1095
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:24,999
She fought with Collector and
got roads to this place.

1096
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,166
She raises a hell.

1097
01:46:28,834 --> 01:46:29,958
lnstead of going to town
for higher education,

1098
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:31,874
children here are stopping
education here with 10th class.

1099
01:46:33,084 --> 01:46:33,708
Why?

1100
01:46:33,959 --> 01:46:36,999
Hospital and water tank
are standing unfinished.

1101
01:46:37,209 --> 01:46:37,916
Why?

1102
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:41,458
Because we don't have proper roads
to get sand and cement.

1103
01:46:42,292 --> 01:46:45,874
Why did l have a quarter because
l don't have money for half bottle?

1104
01:46:46,084 --> 01:46:47,208
lndeed!

1105
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:51,249
lf you disturb Ammulu,
l'll stop your Aadhar card.

1106
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,874
Bloody idiot.

1107
01:46:53,084 --> 01:46:56,041
As soon as she gets up,
she looks around for problem.

1108
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:58,291
lf there isn't any?
- She creates one on her own.

1109
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,124
Won't her family stop her?
- What will he say?

1110
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:01,416
He's a school teacher, right?

1111
01:47:01,667 --> 01:47:03,583
She has been pampered by mother
and raised with father's ideals.

1112
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,124
Why do you worry about others?

1113
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,874
Why not marry and become a wife
like all other girls?

1114
01:47:10,084 --> 01:47:13,916
Ammulu isn't like all other girls.
My father didn't raise me like that.

1115
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:16,583
lsn't it, father?
- Yes, dear.

1116
01:47:16,834 --> 01:47:21,291
People are talking bad about
not marrying of our daughter.

1117
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:25,416
Let it turn worse, l don't care.
l'm living for myself.

1118
01:47:25,667 --> 01:47:28,208
Aren't they seeing any proposals?
- That too happened.

1119
01:47:28,459 --> 01:47:30,291
The girls is very beautiful, right?

1120
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:33,749
She got a rich proposal
from neighbouring village.

1121
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:35,749
l'm feeling shy.

1122
01:47:36,334 --> 01:47:40,249
Why do you want to marry?
- What's that question?

1123
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,208
A man must have a woman and
a woman must have a man.

1124
01:47:43,459 --> 01:47:47,124
Their relationship is inseparable
like whisky and soda.

1125
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,833
What are your qualifications
to marry me?

1126
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:52,749
l own 500 acres of land.

1127
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,999
Did you earn it?

1128
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,708
l never got that chance,
my ancestors earned it.

1129
01:47:57,917 --> 01:48:00,624
l've 300 acres of coconut farm too.

1130
01:48:00,834 --> 01:48:03,333
Do you do coconut business too?

1131
01:48:03,584 --> 01:48:05,416
How many coconuts do you get
in a season?

1132
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,541
Would l get that opportunity?

1133
01:48:07,792 --> 01:48:09,583
My father and elder brother
look after business.

1134
01:48:09,834 --> 01:48:10,749
What do you do?

1135
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,791
l keep worrying about
how to spend so much money!

1136
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,083
Day time l spend time on playing cards,
at nights...

1137
01:48:17,334 --> 01:48:17,999
Sir!

1138
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:18,958
You say like that?

1139
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,333
So, you don't work hard.

1140
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:22,833
Oh my God! Why should l work?

1141
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,166
Get up!

1142
01:48:24,459 --> 01:48:27,833
l hate men who boast about
ancestors' property.

1143
01:48:28,042 --> 01:48:28,791
Get up!

1144
01:48:30,959 --> 01:48:32,499
lf l marry her,
l've to work every day.

1145
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:35,374
To all fans of Adityapuram...

1146
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:39,958
Ammulu baby has come to our place
after finishing her studies.

1147
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:43,416
So, we got a road to our place today.

1148
01:48:46,834 --> 01:48:49,249
When they asked about which place
do l belong to in my college?

1149
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,874
l said Adityapuram.

1150
01:48:51,084 --> 01:48:54,958
Where is it? They cracked jokes
if such a place existed.

1151
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:59,708
l decided that day itself to make
our Adityapuram a role model.

1152
01:49:02,167 --> 01:49:07,083
Not only that l'll ensure
Ammulu is Adityapuram and vice versa.

1153
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:13,166
Adityapuram means Annapoorna
and vice versa.

1154
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:15,333
l liked Ammulu very much, mother.

1155
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:18,874
How she is...just like you, mother.

1156
01:49:19,084 --> 01:49:21,124
lsn't it luck to get a girl like mother?

1157
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:28,916
lt means journey.

1158
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:32,999
lt's an hour ofjourney
from here to Ravulapalem.

1159
01:49:33,334 --> 01:49:34,291
Mr. President, you please tell.

1160
01:49:34,542 --> 01:49:36,874
lt's an hour's jabany
to our place from Ravulapalem.

1161
01:49:37,084 --> 01:49:38,208
Sir!

1162
01:49:38,459 --> 01:49:39,749
No sir...

1163
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,541
Please don't beat me.
- What happened, Ramu?

1164
01:49:41,792 --> 01:49:44,291
Where are you running away
when boss is calling?

1165
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:49,416
How dare you servant!

1166
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:51,124
Come out...come out...
Come out l say!

1167
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:52,291
Do you need English for your cheap life?

1168
01:49:52,542 --> 01:49:54,291
Shouldn't our people speak
in English, sir?

1169
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,458
lf l know English, you fear
l would know your secrets, right?

1170
01:49:58,709 --> 01:50:00,958
How dare you argue with me?

1171
01:50:01,167 --> 01:50:03,083
Sir...sir...
- Stop it!

1172
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:04,958
Education is basic right of every citizen.

1173
01:50:05,209 --> 01:50:08,833
When l see people like you,
l feel ifwe're really a free country.

1174
01:50:09,042 --> 01:50:11,541
l'll teach him to speak better
than you in English.

1175
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:12,708
Go away.

1176
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:16,958
You'll face music in the bungalow.

1177
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:21,166
l thought you're a good boy and grandson
and would come good in life...

1178
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,874
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1179
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:28,041
lntroduce yourself, Ramu.

1180
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:31,749
Super!

1181
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,999
Not l, say my name is...

1182
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,958
l told you l don't know to
speak in English.

1183
01:50:37,209 --> 01:50:39,958
l know a lot of songs and
poems in Telugu.

1184
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:42,416
Okay, sing what you know.

1185
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:48,374
Like refined Telugu...

1186
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,583
Like day's first rays of light...

1187
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:53,833
Like a river...

1188
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,124
Like flowing river...

1189
01:50:56,917 --> 01:51:00,374
Here comes an angel...

1190
01:51:00,709 --> 01:51:04,041
She's standing right before me...

1191
01:51:10,834 --> 01:51:13,041
Nothing dear, it's over...

1192
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,708
Never again sing like that, Ramu.

1193
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,208
Children may get fever in fear.

1194
01:51:52,834 --> 01:51:55,791
What's this, Ramu?
Have you gone mad?

1195
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,958
They...

1196
01:51:58,875 --> 01:51:59,833
Why is he pointing at us?

1197
01:52:00,042 --> 01:52:00,958
What could he have done there?

1198
01:52:01,209 --> 01:52:03,999
lf l hug you like this,
you would scold and send me away,

1199
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,583
and l would stop learning
English from you,

1200
01:52:06,834 --> 01:52:08,166
they say something in
college for it...

1201
01:52:08,417 --> 01:52:10,541
Jogging...they're jogging me.

1202
01:52:11,042 --> 01:52:14,708
Oh, it's ragging notjogging.
Come, l'll talk to them.

1203
01:52:16,834 --> 01:52:17,708
Are you humans?

1204
01:52:17,959 --> 01:52:20,958
You think l would scold and beat him
if he touches me, right?

1205
01:52:21,209 --> 01:52:22,249
Watch now.

1206
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:23,874
Oh God!

1207
01:52:25,084 --> 01:52:26,541
ls it enough?
- Enough!

1208
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,208
He says enough, please leave him.

1209
01:52:29,417 --> 01:52:31,416
l'm Ammulu, be careful.

1210
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,458
From today you've special classes
in my home.

1211
01:52:34,709 --> 01:52:36,333
Come home.
- Yes.

1212
01:52:40,167 --> 01:52:42,624
Ammulu, tell me the spelling of elephant.

1213
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,624
You remember well if l tell you once.

1214
01:52:56,667 --> 01:52:57,958
What's the meaning of it?

1215
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,083
l love you.

1216
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,999
What did you say now?

1217
01:53:02,209 --> 01:53:05,458
l mean meaning of that is l love you.

1218
01:53:05,709 --> 01:53:09,749
Everyone says l love you,
no discipline at all.

1219
01:53:09,959 --> 01:53:11,791
Boys passing tenth start
falling in love.

1220
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,916
What happened?
Why did you come with a crowd?

1221
01:53:14,125 --> 01:53:15,833
My daughter passed MA with distinction.

1222
01:53:16,042 --> 01:53:19,499
He struggled to get through lntermediate
and runs a telephone booth here.

1223
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,791
You taught her since school days, right?

1224
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,249
l brought her to put some sense in her.

1225
01:53:26,417 --> 01:53:29,874
There's no rule that wife must cook
and husband must work.

1226
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:33,083
To marry it's enough if their
hearts unite.

1227
01:53:33,334 --> 01:53:35,791
No need of castes and education.

1228
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:43,291
Yes, l love you, Ammulu.

1229
01:53:45,417 --> 01:53:48,958
This is the twist,
first solve your problem.

1230
01:53:49,209 --> 01:53:50,999
We'll wait here till then.

1231
01:53:51,209 --> 01:53:52,374
Yourjudgement is good for us too.

1232
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:55,958
What are you blabbering?
Ammulu is teaching you English.

1233
01:53:56,167 --> 01:53:57,874
Are you teaching her love lessons?

1234
01:53:58,084 --> 01:53:59,958
Hey you...
- Stop!

1235
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:03,916
lt's not his mistake.
l gave him that freedom.

1236
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:06,874
l know he likes me.

1237
01:54:07,084 --> 01:54:09,583
What's this, dear?
- Yes, father.

1238
01:54:09,834 --> 01:54:11,291
l too love Ramu, father.

1239
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:14,791
He kept quiet and loved me silently
till l came out.

1240
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,083
He never expressed it.

1241
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:18,416
He never misbehaved with me.

1242
01:54:19,334 --> 01:54:22,374
lf he hadn't expressed it now,
l would've done it.

1243
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:29,083
Where can l get a better husband than a man
who understands a woman so well?

1244
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:31,541
l'm very happy.

1245
01:54:32,792 --> 01:54:34,624
l'm very proud of you, dear.

1246
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:36,374
Her wish is our wish.

1247
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:39,749
lf teacher says so, we're nothing,
l'll talk to your father, come.

1248
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,791
That's it.
- Good.

1249
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:45,291
Ramu has become a groom...

1250
01:55:09,209 --> 01:55:11,791
Did l ever think about it?

1251
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,333
Did l ever dream about it?

1252
01:55:14,584 --> 01:55:19,291
That love would deluge my heart...

1253
01:55:19,834 --> 01:55:25,458
Never my heart skipped a beat
for anyone till now...

1254
01:55:25,709 --> 01:55:29,874
Why is it ringing like anklets now?

1255
01:55:33,625 --> 01:55:38,666
Eyes have joined eyes and
dreams are leaping into sky...

1256
01:55:38,917 --> 01:55:44,083
Heart is uniting with heart,
lips are getting wet with love honey...

1257
01:55:44,334 --> 01:55:50,124
Beauty has been uncovered...
Love is blossoming...

1258
01:56:21,959 --> 01:56:27,874
Shall l turn myself into
fairest of fairies?

1259
01:56:28,084 --> 01:56:32,541
Shall l share warmth of
Kashmir with you?

1260
01:56:32,792 --> 01:56:38,041
You're so beautiful,
you won't let me bat my eye too...

1261
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:44,208
May l arrest you in my eyes
and arms for the life?

1262
01:57:30,375 --> 01:57:35,999
You're the fragrance ofjasmine,
l'm the scented water...

1263
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:40,916
Won't the spring move to
the season of happiness?

1264
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:46,333
l'm the twin evening...
You're the mischief of youth...

1265
01:57:46,584 --> 01:57:52,749
You're my world and l'm your
intoxication, let's unite as one...

1266
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:27,583
What's it, Ammulu?

1267
01:58:28,709 --> 01:58:29,541
Nothing.

1268
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,416
l didn't feel when you were here,
but l feel terrible when you leave.

1269
01:58:35,792 --> 01:58:36,791
What happened, dear?

1270
01:58:39,167 --> 01:58:41,916
Mad girl, l'll be back
as soon as possible.

1271
01:58:42,084 --> 01:58:43,916
l'll come with unexpected good news.

1272
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:45,333
Stop crying.

1273
01:58:46,542 --> 01:58:47,541
Stop l say!

1274
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:26,791
The place is very green!

1275
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,583
My body is warm.

1276
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,083
That's why, did you bring me here?

1277
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:38,416
You're not in this scene,
your scene is over with flight.

1278
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,416
l'll have country chicken here.

1279
01:59:41,792 --> 01:59:44,624
Boys, send her back to Delhi.

1280
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:47,916
Congratulations, owner!

1281
01:59:48,125 --> 01:59:49,833
Welcome brother...welcome.

1282
01:59:52,542 --> 01:59:54,416
Vaidehi Steels, brother.

1283
01:59:54,709 --> 01:59:59,791
You say Vaidehi, won't she come for
the ground breaking ceremony?

1284
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,041
No, she can't. My grandma!
She died before l was born.

1285
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,124
Come.
- Let's go.

1286
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,749
Your name, sir?
- Musallapadu Vikas.

1287
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,958
Just say Vicky.

1288
02:00:52,292 --> 02:00:54,124
Who are you?
What's this nuisance?

1289
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:57,124
Farmers who were living on
these lands for 25 years.

1290
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:58,999
Stop this foundation laying.

1291
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:01,624
We've paid advance and
signed agreement with land owner.

1292
02:01:01,875 --> 02:01:04,124
You've only signed the agreement,
it hasn't yet been registered.

1293
02:01:04,375 --> 02:01:05,999
lt'll not happen.
- Who are you to say that?

1294
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:08,958
l'm the land owner and
Ramachandra Naidu's grandson.

1295
02:01:09,209 --> 02:01:11,791
What's the problem there?

1296
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:36,958
l must run the show here!

1297
02:01:41,834 --> 02:01:46,291
The lightning isn't it sky
but in that girl!

1298
02:01:59,709 --> 02:02:02,583
What's it, dear? What happened?

1299
02:02:02,792 --> 02:02:05,208
These farmers have the rights
on these lands.

1300
02:02:05,459 --> 02:02:08,124
They're still talking to the owners,

1301
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:10,166
but without even registering
the agreement,

1302
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:13,208
they arranged the ground
breaking ceremony and invited you.

1303
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:15,833
Whose lands are this, Vicky?
- Let's finish the ceremony.

1304
02:02:16,042 --> 02:02:18,999
First people, ceremonies are second.

1305
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:20,749
Registration is scheduled for today,

1306
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:23,249
we arranged this ceremony earlier
because we can't get your appointment.

1307
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,666
Farmers are not interested
in building factory here, sir.

1308
02:02:29,209 --> 02:02:32,083
You want us to stop this
ground breaking ceremony, right?

1309
02:02:32,334 --> 02:02:32,958
Yes.

1310
02:02:33,292 --> 02:02:36,249
Vicky, stop the ceremony.

1311
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,708
Why brother?
- Just do what l say!

1312
02:02:41,125 --> 02:02:42,958
We're indebted to you for life.

1313
02:02:43,209 --> 02:02:48,083
Nobody must be indebted to anyone.
You must settle it.

1314
02:02:49,417 --> 02:02:51,958
l mean by voting in favour of my father.

1315
02:02:52,167 --> 02:02:53,208
Okay.

1316
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:58,333
You're making me sweat even in rain,
l mean determination in your eyes.

1317
02:02:58,584 --> 02:02:59,916
l like it.

1318
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:02,958
l like the courage of your heart.

1319
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:05,916
Taking the cudgels for farmers.

1320
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:07,708
lt's fantastic!

1321
02:03:07,959 --> 02:03:10,458
Overall you've impressed me a lot.

1322
02:03:10,709 --> 02:03:12,166
l've become your great fan.

1323
02:03:16,459 --> 02:03:17,416
Bye sir.

1324
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:34,708
Long live Ammulu Baby!

1325
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:38,958
What great news!

1326
02:03:39,167 --> 02:03:43,499
What more can l expect than another girl
from Adityapuram as my daughter-in-law.

1327
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:46,666
lt means your mother's place is
your mother-in-law's place.

1328
02:03:46,917 --> 02:03:48,166
Then, l'll go tomorrow, grandpa.

1329
02:03:48,375 --> 02:03:50,166
l can conduct Lord Rama's marriage too.

1330
02:03:50,417 --> 02:03:53,041
Then, marry tomorrow, bridegroom!

1331
02:04:13,959 --> 02:04:17,999
Great man who said man's wish is
the root cause for the problems.

1332
02:04:18,459 --> 02:04:22,124
But wishing to see a wish less
society is also a wish, right?

1333
02:04:22,792 --> 02:04:26,749
When God has so many wishes,
we're just ordinary humans!

1334
02:04:33,084 --> 02:04:36,249
Sir, my name is Billa Bhikshapathi,
my father is Billa Umapathy.

1335
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:39,416
He's central Minister of Women's welfare.

1336
02:04:42,084 --> 02:04:46,583
To tell you directly,
l love your daughter.

1337
02:04:48,834 --> 02:04:50,958
You're her parents,
so l'm here to inform you.

1338
02:04:51,209 --> 02:04:53,374
Excuse me, my daughter's marriage is fixed.

1339
02:04:53,584 --> 02:04:56,874
No problem, l've a scheme.

1340
02:04:57,084 --> 02:05:04,499
A great scheme for girls to earn
money to pay for their dowry.

1341
02:05:10,834 --> 02:05:12,416
What's this?
- Money!

1342
02:05:12,667 --> 02:05:15,333
A thing which is necessary for any man!

1343
02:05:15,584 --> 02:05:18,499
l'll not love your daughter all the life!

1344
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,583
Just for one night only!

1345
02:05:23,917 --> 02:05:26,124
That's why l'm offering a crore!

1346
02:05:27,167 --> 02:05:30,416
You can conduct your marriage
grandly with this money.

1347
02:05:30,667 --> 02:05:31,624
Get up l say!

1348
02:05:31,875 --> 02:05:35,083
ls it the way you speak about a girl
of marriageable age?

1349
02:05:35,334 --> 02:05:36,791
What sort of a man are you?

1350
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,583
You too have fire in you.

1351
02:05:40,834 --> 02:05:43,541
You're married, right?
l don't mind you also.

1352
02:05:44,959 --> 02:05:47,541
But l'll offer 50 lakhs only!

1353
02:05:47,792 --> 02:05:49,291
Used piece, right?

1354
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:58,249
Carnal desire has no shyness or shame
or sari orjeans.

1355
02:05:59,875 --> 02:06:06,166
When you offer a crore for a night,
l can judge how you earned this.

1356
02:06:06,417 --> 02:06:10,541
May be you were the pimp of
your mother and sisters.

1357
02:06:10,792 --> 02:06:11,499
lt's wrong, son!

1358
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:14,874
Pay this for your mother or sister
and bring them back to home.

1359
02:06:15,084 --> 02:06:16,124
What the hell are you blabbering?

1360
02:06:16,375 --> 02:06:22,458
One more bad word against my daughter,
l'll beat you with slippers, bastard!

1361
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:27,666
lf you want that factory to come up,
l need her in my bed.

1362
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:29,541
Bring her, boys.

1363
02:06:31,334 --> 02:06:32,124
Hubby!

1364
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,083
This country is not ruining because
of draught or famine,

1365
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:08,208
but for the curse ofwomen
who are mercilessly exploited.

1366
02:07:12,042 --> 02:07:14,416
You'll get ruined!

1367
02:08:47,125 --> 02:08:49,166
l've drawn the line, entered the
arena to challenge you,

1368
02:08:49,375 --> 02:08:54,041
any man worth his moustache or his
manliness dare cross this line with her.

1369
02:08:56,084 --> 02:08:56,999
Try taking her!

1370
02:08:57,292 --> 02:08:58,416
Run over him, boys!

1371
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:13,458
Who are you?

1372
02:09:15,375 --> 02:09:17,416
Ammulu's future husband.

1373
02:09:17,625 --> 02:09:20,499
A man who is here to take her home.

1374
02:09:27,084 --> 02:09:29,916
They said about fixing her marriage,
is it with you?

1375
02:09:30,292 --> 02:09:32,958
l gave an excellent offer
to your ln-laws.

1376
02:09:33,209 --> 02:09:34,666
They rejected with orthodox beliefs.

1377
02:09:34,917 --> 02:09:37,749
l'm offering you the
same offer and same money.

1378
02:09:37,959 --> 02:09:41,291
One crore! You marry her.

1379
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:43,791
l'll go to honeymoon with her.

1380
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,833
l'll offer you ten times of your offer,
Rs.10 crores.

1381
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:54,958
Call a press meet and tell that you're
no more a man after visiting Adityapuram.

1382
02:09:55,584 --> 02:09:58,291
Women in large would know about you.

1383
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:02,791
Will you offer Rs.10 crores? Who are you?

1384
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,791
Annapoornamma's youngest son!

1385
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,999
Raja Ramachandra Naidu's grandson!

1386
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:10,416
Real heir ofAdityapuram property!

1387
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:15,666
Brother, if you kill him,
the girl is yours and land is mine.

1388
02:10:15,917 --> 02:10:18,999
l'll kill you in as many ways as l can.

1389
02:10:19,209 --> 02:10:21,374
My father says l own the record
of killing in this state.

1390
02:10:21,625 --> 02:10:25,541
What bloody records
are you talking about?

1391
02:10:25,792 --> 02:10:29,208
l created records as a kid.

1392
02:10:29,459 --> 02:10:33,999
lf you've state record for killing,
l've the world record in hacking.

1393
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,916
Mother promise...

1394
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:40,916
Don't take the situation to that level.

1395
02:10:41,292 --> 02:10:42,041
Go away!

1396
02:11:29,292 --> 02:11:30,749
Take your slipper, Ammulu!

1397
02:11:32,167 --> 02:11:33,291
Your slipper please!

1398
02:12:11,584 --> 02:12:12,291
Father!

1399
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:14,874
Are you really my son?

1400
02:12:15,042 --> 02:12:17,874
200 acres of land!
Rs.2000 crores worth factory

1401
02:12:18,084 --> 02:12:20,583
l put it in your hands
like a chocolate.

1402
02:12:20,834 --> 02:12:23,416
You couldn't bring a girl
for a night's stand.

1403
02:12:23,667 --> 02:12:27,458
l'll bring and confine her
to your Delhi guest house.

1404
02:12:27,875 --> 02:12:31,249
Notjust for a night,
enjoy her till you're fed up.

1405
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:35,249
After this, l don't want her now.

1406
02:12:36,334 --> 02:12:37,083
l want her life.

1407
02:12:37,292 --> 02:12:39,416
That's like a real man!

1408
02:12:39,792 --> 02:12:41,083
Who is he?

1409
02:12:41,292 --> 02:12:42,874
Raja Ramachandra Naidu's grandson.

1410
02:12:43,042 --> 02:12:44,749
They own the lands where
we're building our factory.

1411
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,124
lt's not safe for you to stay here,
go to Delhi immediately.

1412
02:12:47,375 --> 02:12:49,333
Already your father has
called ten times.

1413
02:12:50,042 --> 02:12:55,583
Any woman who spurns me or
any man who challenges me mustn't live.

1414
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,041
They mustn't live, that's it!

1415
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,874
With his just one lie, we've reconnected
to Adityapuram after 25 years.

1416
02:13:07,042 --> 02:13:12,041
He loves this place and people here
as much as he loves you.

1417
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:16,624
That's why considering farmer's
difficulties as his own, he came to us.

1418
02:13:16,834 --> 02:13:19,083
We've come after cancelling
Vaidehi steels contract.

1419
02:13:19,792 --> 02:13:24,291
l lied to get closer to you,
not to cheat and marry you.

1420
02:13:25,042 --> 02:13:26,958
Whether you agree to
this marriage or not,

1421
02:13:27,209 --> 02:13:29,708
we've decided to give the
lands to farmers.

1422
02:13:30,917 --> 02:13:35,124
l'm saying this as Annapoornamma's son
not as the land lord ofAdityapuram.

1423
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:37,916
Ammulu dear!

1424
02:13:38,125 --> 02:13:42,999
Annapoornamma's son is ready to marry you,
why are you still hesitating?

1425
02:13:45,459 --> 02:13:48,291
But you must always be
the Ramu l know.

1426
02:13:48,625 --> 02:13:50,458
Don't ever speak in English.

1427
02:13:51,125 --> 02:13:55,083
Okay, l'll be Ramayya as you and
this Adityapuram wants me to be.

1428
02:13:55,334 --> 02:14:00,124
Tomorrow is Lord Rama's marriage
and next day Ramu's engagement.

1429
02:14:00,375 --> 02:14:02,208
What do you say? Fixed!

1430
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:25,083
Where's Hari?
- Still not out of that character, buddy.

1431
02:14:25,334 --> 02:14:28,958
My foot! Hees not acting but
planning to usurp your property.

1432
02:14:43,667 --> 02:14:44,374
Grandpa!

1433
02:14:47,875 --> 02:14:50,499
Grandpa...grandpa...

1434
02:14:50,917 --> 02:14:51,999
Grandpa!

1435
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:54,208
Mother, pick up the phone.

1436
02:14:57,459 --> 02:14:58,166
Sister-in-law!

1437
02:15:25,375 --> 02:15:28,708
What happened?
Who did this? Who?

1438
02:15:28,959 --> 02:15:30,874
Musallapadu...Musallapadu...

1439
02:15:31,042 --> 02:15:34,458
Musallapadu Nagabhushanam greets you.

1440
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:38,166
The decision taken in anger is
making me lose crores.

1441
02:15:38,417 --> 02:15:39,874
Think again.

1442
02:15:40,084 --> 02:15:42,333
My son and your grandsons
did it in haste.

1443
02:15:42,584 --> 02:15:43,666
We didn't do anything in haste,

1444
02:15:43,917 --> 02:15:47,708
After doing all this,
how dare you come to my grandfather.

1445
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:53,791
They killed grandpa gorily.

1446
02:16:02,542 --> 02:16:05,291
They didn't show mercy on women too!
- Grandpa!

1447
02:16:12,334 --> 02:16:18,833
Buddy, l couldn't live the character
as Ramachandra Naidu's grandson.

1448
02:16:19,125 --> 02:16:20,458
Please forgive me.

1449
02:16:22,334 --> 02:16:24,166
My character ends...

1450
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:38,958
Hey, grandfather and grandsons are dead.

1451
02:16:39,167 --> 02:16:40,916
You start the pogrom there.

1452
02:16:51,084 --> 02:16:53,833
They're killing, Ammulu...

1453
02:16:54,375 --> 02:16:57,208
Boys, kill her first!
Don't leave her.

1454
02:16:59,209 --> 02:16:59,958
Hubby!

1455
02:17:05,042 --> 02:17:07,041
You go dear...go dear...

1456
02:17:09,625 --> 02:17:10,458
Hubby!

1457
02:17:25,459 --> 02:17:27,416
Brother, you leave the place immediately.

1458
02:17:27,667 --> 02:17:29,458
What about you?
- Go!

1459
02:17:30,084 --> 02:17:31,583
Go...go from here.

1460
02:19:46,792 --> 02:19:50,833
Noting will happen to you...
l'm here, you'll be fine.

1461
02:19:51,042 --> 02:19:54,874
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you...

1462
02:19:55,042 --> 02:19:56,041
l'll kill them.

1463
02:19:57,334 --> 02:20:01,333
Ammulu, listen to me.
- They stabbed me.

1464
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:15,958
Look at me, Ammulu,
l'll kill them...

1465
02:20:16,167 --> 02:20:18,041
Please open your eyes...
open your eyes...

1466
02:21:07,917 --> 02:21:10,666
They're made for each other!

1467
02:21:10,917 --> 02:21:14,416
They can't live without another.
Send him also with her.

1468
02:21:20,917 --> 02:21:23,374
l swear on my mother!

1469
02:21:24,542 --> 02:21:26,874
l swear on my love Ammulu!

1470
02:21:28,334 --> 02:21:32,458
lf anyone who is responsible
for this pogrom is alive,

1471
02:21:33,542 --> 02:21:36,166
l don't consider to have
been born to my mother.

1472
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:32,041
No...no...no...

1473
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,416
l can understand your
cause for vengeance.

1474
02:23:23,625 --> 02:23:25,416
l can understand your pain too.

1475
02:23:27,167 --> 02:23:29,666
But avenging will not end your pain.

1476
02:23:31,042 --> 02:23:34,249
Think once again peacefully,
leave this path.

1477
02:23:35,459 --> 02:23:38,083
My mind too says no.

1478
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:42,458
But my heart says don't spare them.

1479
02:23:43,709 --> 02:23:46,291
l trust my heart more than my mind.

1480
02:23:47,542 --> 02:23:48,291
Come.

1481
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,958
What's this, buddy?

1482
02:23:52,209 --> 02:23:54,624
Why didn't you tell us Akarsha
is Nagabhushanam's daughter?

1483
02:23:54,875 --> 02:23:58,874
l've lost so much in life,
l don't want other to lose anything.

1484
02:23:59,042 --> 02:24:01,249
Drop her in home carefully.

1485
02:24:08,917 --> 02:24:11,374
Bhikshapathi is coming to Hyderabad
tomorrow along with his father.

1486
02:24:11,667 --> 02:24:13,874
He lands in airport as usual in
his chartered flight at 1 1 am.

1487
02:24:14,084 --> 02:24:17,083
Press meet in party office
from 1 1 .15 am to 12.00 noon.

1488
02:24:19,417 --> 02:24:21,499
He's going back to Delhi by 4.30 pm.

1489
02:24:22,084 --> 02:24:25,374
He must attend my college function
before going back to Delhi.- How?

1490
02:24:25,625 --> 02:24:28,333
lt's not in his day plan, right?
- lt's in my plan.

1491
02:24:28,709 --> 02:24:31,208
He has to come, he will come.

1492
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:44,541
Hail central Minister Umapathy!

1493
02:24:44,792 --> 02:24:45,374
Stop!

1494
02:24:45,625 --> 02:24:48,541
Are you here to garland me
or attack me?

1495
02:24:48,792 --> 02:24:49,749
Come in a line.

1496
02:24:49,959 --> 02:24:52,541
Yes, recently he had a heart surgery.

1497
02:24:52,875 --> 02:24:56,833
Mosquito! lt must be same, would l
keep quiet it bites my secretary?

1498
02:24:59,417 --> 02:25:02,249
Be nice at least till you get the ticket.

1499
02:25:02,459 --> 02:25:04,583
l've to spend over Rs.80 crores.

1500
02:25:04,834 --> 02:25:09,083
Till then stay out of women and
mingle with party high command.

1501
02:25:09,834 --> 02:25:12,374
You can't control yourself even if
an electric pole is draped in sari.

1502
02:25:13,667 --> 02:25:17,041
You mean someone is at large
to kill my son, right?

1503
02:25:17,292 --> 02:25:21,208
Are you a police officer
or postman?

1504
02:25:21,459 --> 02:25:24,124
Aren't you ashamed of coming
with such news?

1505
02:25:24,375 --> 02:25:27,958
lf l see him this time,
l'll hack him myself.

1506
02:25:28,209 --> 02:25:31,166
l'm not a coward like you
to increase the girth.

1507
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:33,083
l'm the one who scares people!

1508
02:25:33,292 --> 02:25:34,666
You keep quiet, son.

1509
02:25:35,042 --> 02:25:38,916
Protecting me and my son is your duty!

1510
02:25:39,125 --> 02:25:42,583
Though l said about threat...
- Yes, my life is under threat.

1511
02:25:42,792 --> 02:25:44,624
But l've good hold on the party.

1512
02:25:50,292 --> 02:25:51,666
Why are you rushing like that?

1513
02:25:51,917 --> 02:25:53,749
Can't you follow procedures?

1514
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:55,374
Greetings to press people!

1515
02:25:55,625 --> 02:25:57,749
Reason for your sudden visit
to Hyderabad?

1516
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,083
For the past 3 days Charminar is
coming in my dream.

1517
02:26:02,334 --> 02:26:05,999
l came to see it.
Are you a journalist?

1518
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:08,874
State level Kabadi championship
is about to begin.

1519
02:26:09,084 --> 02:26:12,374
Would your brother-in-law come
instead of Sports Minister?

1520
02:26:12,625 --> 02:26:14,958
You're trying to cover up the issue
of getting a ticket for your son.

1521
02:26:15,167 --> 02:26:19,999
Last time l saw you in a
sweater in Delhi, why not now?

1522
02:26:20,459 --> 02:26:23,083
l changed the channel for getting
separated from family, sir.

1523
02:26:23,334 --> 02:26:26,791
You can change the channel but
l can't even change my word, right?

1524
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,374
Are you supporting family politics?

1525
02:26:30,625 --> 02:26:35,166
This press meet ends,
say loudly hail Mother lndia!

1526
02:26:35,417 --> 02:26:38,374
No sir...
- Hail Mother lndia!

1527
02:26:53,792 --> 02:26:55,499
l love you so much!

1528
02:26:55,959 --> 02:26:58,791
l can't bear to hear a no from you.

1529
02:27:01,084 --> 02:27:02,041
What do you want?

1530
02:27:02,292 --> 02:27:08,041
How can we middle class politicians live
on 1000 or 2000 crores, sir?

1531
02:27:08,292 --> 02:27:10,249
That's why l'm introducing my son.

1532
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:13,041
He can garner at least 50000
or 1 lakh!

1533
02:27:13,292 --> 02:27:15,499
Sir, youth hero dumped us in
the last moment.

1534
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:17,416
We may lose our respect in college.

1535
02:27:17,667 --> 02:27:21,208
How can l replace a film hero?

1536
02:27:21,459 --> 02:27:25,208
He's just a youth hero.
But you're a hero of youth!

1537
02:27:33,792 --> 02:27:37,541
Whatever it is, one must be good
in tongue and plans in politics.

1538
02:27:37,792 --> 02:27:40,666
Just 5 minutes can make our day, sir.

1539
02:27:41,667 --> 02:27:44,833
Your day will be done,
what about me then?

1540
02:27:45,042 --> 02:27:48,499
There's a private party exclusively
for only you after the function.

1541
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:50,249
Then, l'll come only for you.

1542
02:27:56,084 --> 02:27:57,916
He has agreed to be the chief guest.

1543
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,833
This is a battlefield...
it's a war of chess moves...

1544
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,291
Destruction has to happen...

1545
02:28:28,292 --> 02:28:30,208
This is revenge...
thirsting for blood...

1546
02:28:30,459 --> 02:28:33,083
Getting ready for a long
drawn battle...

1547
02:28:33,417 --> 02:28:36,749
Battle plan ofArjuna...
War cries of thunder...

1548
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,874
Swords are unsheathed...
enemy is ready...

1549
02:28:39,084 --> 02:28:40,916
This is a dance of death...

1550
02:28:41,125 --> 02:28:43,166
lt's cremation of demon...

1551
02:28:43,417 --> 02:28:45,291
lt's the burial of devil...

1552
02:28:45,542 --> 02:28:49,333
He's the hero who showers
thunders on enemies...

1553
02:28:49,584 --> 02:28:58,374
He's the warrior who wins
waging against cyclones....

1554
02:29:19,584 --> 02:29:23,583
Unless you give up patience,
war will not turn bloody...

1555
02:29:23,834 --> 02:29:27,833
Without hunting tiger won't have
any strength...

1556
02:29:28,042 --> 02:29:32,541
To prove your prowess,
go for the kill...

1557
02:29:32,792 --> 02:29:36,083
Enemity is tempting...
blow the war bugle...

1558
02:29:36,334 --> 02:29:41,166
Without backing off, march ahead
with single minded devotion...

1559
02:30:18,667 --> 02:30:20,791
Come like a hungry tiger...

1560
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,499
Bite the lips...

1561
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:24,791
Rake up desires...
make me squeal in pleasure...

1562
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,041
Open up the screen of pleasure...

1563
02:30:27,292 --> 02:30:31,666
Take on me and
give me a glimpse of bliss...

1564
02:30:31,917 --> 02:30:39,958
l'm Rama, who is here to destroy evil
Ravana and consign him to flames...

1565
02:31:16,459 --> 02:31:17,583
Hey Bhikshapathi!

1566
02:31:18,375 --> 02:31:21,583
l know you'll fall for the
bait of woman, bloody womanizer!

1567
02:31:21,834 --> 02:31:25,041
That's why l hit at your weakest spot.

1568
02:31:25,459 --> 02:31:28,916
Thanks for coming without
giving me much trouble.

1569
02:31:30,334 --> 02:31:34,124
The moment a girl in search of me,
l got suspicious.

1570
02:31:34,375 --> 02:31:37,583
l'm not here with weakness!

1571
02:31:37,834 --> 02:31:40,333
l'm here with power and men!

1572
02:31:47,542 --> 02:31:49,874
He'll be on the stage, get him.

1573
02:32:09,417 --> 02:32:10,541
What happened, sir?

1574
02:32:11,542 --> 02:32:13,624
He has kidnapped my father!

1575
02:32:18,250 --> 02:32:19,791
What were you doing?

1576
02:32:20,292 --> 02:32:21,541
Shepherding donkeys?

1577
02:32:21,834 --> 02:32:25,541
We kept our focus on you but
he kept his focus on your father.

1578
02:32:25,792 --> 02:32:27,708
Shut your gob,
leave everything behind,

1579
02:32:27,959 --> 02:32:30,374
come alone to Adityapuram.

1580
02:32:30,625 --> 02:32:31,666
lf not...?

1581
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,916
l'm coming...coming alone!

1582
02:33:35,709 --> 02:33:39,124
For a year now l've been
waiting for you,

1583
02:33:39,375 --> 02:33:44,416
these people have been
waiting for me,

1584
02:33:47,209 --> 02:33:50,833
l thought you're a hero for
killing Nagabhushanam.

1585
02:33:51,042 --> 02:33:54,874
l thought you're a man for cheating me
and kidnapping my father.

1586
02:33:55,209 --> 02:33:59,666
You called me alone but
have come with entire village.

1587
02:33:59,917 --> 02:34:01,749
Think l'm alone.

1588
02:34:03,792 --> 02:34:08,541
l swear on my mother, other than me
no one else will touch you.

1589
02:35:36,084 --> 02:35:38,791
Any son would wish to see his
father for the last time.

1590
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,166
But your father would see you die.

1591
02:35:41,417 --> 02:35:42,208
Brother!

1592
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:13,416
Attack now!

1593
02:36:14,292 --> 02:36:20,208
Will you create so much havoc for
touching one girl in Adityapuram?

1594
02:36:20,875 --> 02:36:25,333
l'll rape a girl from every house
as police watch it.

1595
02:36:25,584 --> 02:36:27,458
Do whatever you can do!

1596
02:36:34,209 --> 02:36:36,958
People are not scared of law
in this country doing crime.

1597
02:36:37,209 --> 02:36:40,166
They're committing crime
with the support of law.

1598
02:36:49,084 --> 02:36:55,541
ln Adityapuram clashes,
Minister Umapathy and his son were killed.

1599
02:36:59,417 --> 02:37:02,458
l'll complete the formalities
and meet you personally.

1600
02:37:19,625 --> 02:37:22,999
Though prices have sky rocketed
or scams are dozen a dime,

1601
02:37:23,250 --> 02:37:23,916
though crime rates have shot up,

1602
02:37:24,125 --> 02:37:27,666
just because common people are
living unmindful of this,

1603
02:37:28,334 --> 02:37:32,291
if you dare to barge into our homes
and desire our women,

1604
02:37:32,542 --> 02:37:35,083
we won't keep quiet!

1605
02:37:35,917 --> 02:37:37,666
l'll cut you up!

1606
02:37:47,334 --> 02:37:52,291
Carnal desire has no place or life!

1607
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:05,291
Mrs.Annapoornamma Adult Education Centre

1608
