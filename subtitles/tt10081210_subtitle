1
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,125
Munni, come out. It's enough.

2
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:03,667
Shreya.

3
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,125
Shreya, it's enough.

4
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,500
Munni, remove those goggles.

5
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,208
Raj...

6
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,292
Get Shreya out of it.

7
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,958
What is the problem?
Microchip or software?

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,333
<i>The shipment from Chennai</i>
<i>is full of damaged chips.</i>

9
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,208
Mom, I want ice cream.

10
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,625
You just got out of the pool.
You'll catch a cold if you have ice cream.

11
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,625
-Have it tomorrow.
-I want ice cream now.

12
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,333
With these defective chips...

13
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,167
How many units were manufactured
with these defective chips?

14
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,542
-Remove that costume and wear this dress.
-I won't. I want ice cream.

15
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,458
Get the microchips replaced
in all the units.

16
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:01,833
Change the Chinese supplier too.
See to it that he bears the cost.

17
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,208
I want ice cream now!

18
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:48,875
Naidu...

19
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,458
-Naidu.
-Sir?

20
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,750
-Check why the generator is not on.
-Yes, sir.

21
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,458
Shreya...

22
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,833
Shreya...

23
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,792
Shreya...
Shreya!

24
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,042
Shreya, dear.

25
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,875
-Shreya...
-Raj...

26
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,208
Raj...

27
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,458
Shreya...
Shreya, my dear...

28
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,000
-Shreya.
-Shreya.

29
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,500
-Shreya!
-Shreya...

30
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,042
-My dear... Shreya.
-Shreya.

31
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,542
-Raj.
-Shreya, my darling.

32
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,917
-Shreya, what happened to you?
-What happened, Raj?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,917
-Shreya. What happened, my dear?
-Shreya...

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,250
-Shreya...
-Come on, get up... Hey!

35
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
Call an ambulance.

36
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,208
-Shreya...
-Shreya...

37
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,750
-Shreya, what happened to you?
-Shreya, get up.

38
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,375
What happened to you?
Open your eyes.

39
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,917
-What happened?
-I told you,

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,542
to get her out of the water, Raj.

41
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,625
Hey, Shreya...

42
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,875
-Shreya...
-I am sorry, dear.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,125
Get up, Shreya...

44
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,667
Why did they let her swim
when she has asthma?

45
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,458
The doctor told them
that swimming was good for the lungs.

46
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,417
They are hushing it up,

47
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,750
but the word is that they had forgotten
to refill the inhaler.

48
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,042
It's sad that even the younger one
is suffering from asthma.

49
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,375
Little one.
Come here, dear.

50
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:31,833
Jhanvi, Munni has removed the inhaler
from her neck. Put it back.

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,792
-What's your name?
-Munni.

52
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,667
Which school do you attend?

53
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,000
-Johnson Grammar School.
-Munni.

54
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,375
Yes.

55
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,667
You forgot this.

56
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,000
The reports have come in.

57
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,417
The chlorine pump in the swimming pool
failed due to power fluctuation.

58
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,875
A heavy amount of chlorine
flowed into the water.

59
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,958
That triggered Shreya's asthma attack.

60
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,833
Anyway, they are treating it
as an accident.

61
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,292
There will be no post-mortem.

62
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,875
No hurdles for the cremation.

63
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,333
How many times have I told you
not to touch your sister's phone?

64
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,167
-Why shouldn't I?
-Because Shreya wouldn't have liked it.

65
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,708
-She said that I could have her phone.
-Munni, you shouldn't lie.

66
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,292
I want it.
She said that she'd give it to me.

67
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,792
When did she tell you?

68
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,458
Well, come on.
I've cooked noodles for you.

69
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,875
I don't want any noodles.

70
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,208
Munni... Munni, come back.

71
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,292
<i>Sister...</i>

72
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,667
<i>Put both the legs on it, Munni.</i>

73
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,667
<i>Come on, Munni.</i>
<i>Put your legs on it.</i>

74
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't live here.

75
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,750
I am getting reminded of her all the time.

76
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,667
Let's go somewhere far, please.

77
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,250
I can't live here.

78
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,500
I can't live here.

79
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,458
<i>A to Z Realtors...</i>

80
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>Hi. Are there any independent houses</i>
<i>for sale?</i>

81
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,917
<i>Hello. Yeah, right.</i>

82
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:17,083
<i>The house is not bad,</i>
<i>but I don't like the locality.</i>

83
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,000
<i>I saw the house yesterday.</i>
<i>It has to be demolished and rebuilt.</i>

84
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

85
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,167
<i>Rexton Property Consultants.</i>

86
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:28,292
<i>Not in the outskirts.</i>
<i>Show us a property within the city.</i>

87
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,375
<i>Sorry. We don't want</i>
<i>a property which is under litigation.</i>

88
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,542
<i>I like the property,</i>
<i>but there are no hospitals nearby.</i>

89
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,333
<i>Sorry. I saw the house.</i>

90
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,917
<i>I'm not particular about the house design,</i>
<i>but there should be good hospitals nearby.</i>

91
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,000
<i>-Is there such a big house there?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

92
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,417
<i>I'll check it out tomorrow.</i>

93
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,292
<i>Please mail me a picture of the house.</i>

94
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,917
Okay, one last time.
How many people have come from Japan?

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,375
12 of them, including those from
administration and finance divisions.

96
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,417
-Did their chairman like it at Falaknuma?
-We put him in the Nizam suite.

97
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,167
Others have been accommodated
in high-end suites.

98
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,375
Are these the agreement folders?

99
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,000
I asked for leather folders.

100
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,750
I want Montblanc, not Rollerballs.

101
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,125
-What about the media coverage?
-Yes, sir.

102
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,000
The national and local media
will be present.

103
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,667
I'm talking to the channel heads.

104
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,417
Instruct the protocol team

105
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,458
to assign two people to each member
of their delegation.

106
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,667
I'll take care of their chairman.

107
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,250
And by the way,
regarding tomorrow's lunch...

108
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,167
I hope you remember that their chairman
is a vegetarian.

109
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,500
Relax, Raj.

110
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,417
This is the 14th meeting about this
in the last three days.

111
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,708
Everything will be fine.

112
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,792
Yet, we don't have the right folders
and pens that I have asked for.

113
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:03,417
Sometimes, even the smallest mistake
can result in humongous loss.

114
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,292
You know how hard we have worked
for this merger.

115
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,458
The Japanese are very sensitive.

116
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,292
They look at everything
through a magnifying glass.

117
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,625
-Jhanvi, please email me the speech.
-Okay, sir.

118
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,917
<i>With the talks between both companies</i>
<i>ending on a positive note,</i>

119
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,708
<i>Rajkumar Rao's company, Technical,</i>
<i>and Japan's Matsumoto Corporation</i>

120
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,208
<i>have reached an agreement...</i>

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,542
Congrats. Are you done with it?

122
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,667
Okay, I've sent you the location.
Come quickly.

123
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,792
So, this is your secret.

124
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,458
But it looks like a very old one, Leena.

125
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,833
It's been 90 years.

126
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,458
But why such an old house?

127
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,208
We can buy land in the suburbs
and build a nice house.

128
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,000
6,000 square yards in the city.

129
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,958
You won't believe
how cheap we got it.

130
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,083
They sold it as they needed money.

131
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,292
But seriously, Leena,
this house is too old.

132
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,750
There are three hospitals
within half a kilometer.

133
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,292
With Munni's condition,
we can't stay far away and take a chance.

134
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,750
-Where's my office?
-At HITEC city.

135
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,625
There's no office here.
By the way, there is no TV too.

136
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,250
Come on.

137
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,458
This is Munni's schoolroom.

138
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,000
Munni, your schoolroom is very nice.

139
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,792
See, I have a laptop too.

140
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,792
Wow, Munni.
Your laptop is much better than mine.

141
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,042
Please, can I have it?

142
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,833
-I want a phone too.
-Why do you need a phone?

143
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,125
You don't need a phone.

144
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,708
You can have this. Take it.

145
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,625
It's a walkie-talkie.
Both of us will have this device.

146
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,583
-We can talk to each other.
-Wow.

147
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,292
If you switch this on,
we can hear each other.

148
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,458
Okay, stay here.
I'll go downstairs and talk to you.

149
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,958
This is not a walkie-talkie.
It's a baby monitor.

150
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,500
If she makes a sound at night,
we can hear her.

151
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,083
Are you sure homeschooling her
is a good idea?

152
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,500
Think again, Leena.

153
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,958
I need to be with Munni
till her lungs get better.

154
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:09,167
I have to keep myself busy. Otherwise
I won't be able to forget Shreya.

155
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,833
That's why I need no servants.

156
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,750
I want to do everything myself.

157
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,917
Thank you very much.
You didn't say "no husband."

158
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,125
Munni can have steam sessions here.

159
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,292
The doctor says
it will be good for her lungs.

160
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,625
-There is little more work to be done.
-<i>Hello...</i>

161
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,667
Hi, Mommy, where are you?

162
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,083
I'm downstairs.
Come, let's set the table for dinner.

163
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,833
You have forgotten something.

164
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,708
Put the plate in the sink.

165
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,833
Hey... You're breaking the rules.
No using of gadgets before bedtime.

166
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,417
Give it to me.

167
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,542
This walkie-talkie should be here
when you sleep.

168
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,042
Get some sleep.

169
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,167
Is she asleep?

170
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,708
She's trying.

171
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,125
-Why don't you tell her a story?
-I'm too tired.

172
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,583
Do you like the house?

173
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,833
I like it.

174
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,083
Did you really like it
or are you trying to please me?

175
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,833
I'm just trying to please you.

176
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,833
Do you think Shreya would have liked it?

177
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,292
Munni, keep that aside and sleep.

178
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,250
Hi, Sister.

179
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,833
How come you are here?

180
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,708
You came to see me! Why?

181
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,417
If we go out now, Mom will get angry.

182
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,708
Mom doesn't sleep so soon.
Wait, let me check.

183
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,958
Munni, why are you out of bed?

184
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,167
Will you come to play tomorrow?

185
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,417
I'll keep it a secret.
I won't let anyone know about you.

186
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,458
Get in here.

187
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,917
-What are you eating, dear?
-Cereal, Dad.

188
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,917
-What did you prepare?
-Broken-wheat <i>upma.</i>

189
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,458
Yuck! I'll eat cereal too.

190
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,542
Leena, why did you buy this cereal?
It contains almonds.

191
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,208
Oh, God. It's not mentioned on the pack.

192
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,542
You should be careful while buying.

193
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,042
The packaging is wrong.

194
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,333
-We should sue these guys.
-Give it to me, Dad.

195
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,208
You shouldn't eat this, dear.
It contains nuts.

196
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,792
Leena, make French toast for Munni.
She likes it.

197
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,667
I don't want French toast. I want cereal.

198
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,042
-Is there any other cereal?
-No.

199
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,917
Okay, then make pancakes.
Munni and I will eat pancakes.

200
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,958
I don't want pancakes.
I want only cereal.

201
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,375
Stop it. You shouldn't eat this.

202
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,292
I want only cereal.
I want cereal...

203
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,417
Then no breakfast for you today.

204
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,667
What happened?

205
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,333
She threw these things at me
as I took her cereal away.

206
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,583
-Munni...
-I'll deal with you in the evening.

207
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,208
Come, let's clean this mess.

208
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,417
What you did is wrong, dear.
Daddy could have been hurt.

209
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,042
What made you so angry
that you hurled plates and glasses?

210
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,125
I didn't do it, Mom.

211
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,792
-Hey, if it isn't you, then who was it?
-I didn't do it.

212
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,625
I'll slap you. Don't you dare lie to me.

213
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,833
I didn't do it...

214
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,250
Munni, come here..

215
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,875
You threw the stuff
and they are blaming me.

216
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,792
Why can't they see you?

217
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,625
Where shall we go?

218
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,375
No, Sis. Mommy will scold me again
if we go out.

219
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,417
Hey...

220
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,042
I've told you to clean it up. Come on.

221
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,333
What are you looking at?
Come downstairs.

222
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,750
-I won't go.
-You won't go?

223
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,458
I wasn't talking to you.

224
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,667
Hey. Don't be stupid.
Who else is here other than me?

225
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,875
Let's go.

226
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,333
You have to clean up your mess.
That's your lesson for today.

227
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,042
Dump it in the trash can
and wash your hands.

228
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,792
Then I'll teach you the alphabet.

229
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,042
Mom always makes me do all the work.

230
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,792
Run away from home? Where to?

231
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,000
No one would scold me at this nice place?

232
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,958
Dad sometimes hits me, Sister.

233
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,542
Yes, you are right.

234
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,208
Mom and Dad will learn to behave
if I go missing.

235
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,000
They'll stop hitting and yelling at me.

236
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,125
When will we come back?

237
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,375
If it's going to be that long,
I need to pack my stuff.

238
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,250
-Kid, where are you going?
-Open the gate.

239
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,875
-Why? Where's your mom?
-Open the gate.

240
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:13,250
Ma'am, Munni is asking me
to open the gate to go out.

241
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,125
-Let me go.
-Listen to me. You shouldn't go out.

242
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,458
-Let go.
-She'll be angry.

243
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,917
-Let go of me...
-Munni, what's the matter?

244
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,167
She wants me to open the gate, ma'am.

245
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,458
Where are you going?

246
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,833
I'm leaving home.
I won't stay here.

247
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,875
-Why, dear?
-I'll leave...

248
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:45,083
Make sure the delegates have a good time.
Did you plan any sight-seeing?

249
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,208
Yes, sir.
Film City, Chowmahalla Palace...

250
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,083
-Yes, Leena.
-Are you busy?

251
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:56,958
-No, what is it?
-Munni tried to leave home today.

252
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:58,417
What? Where to?

253
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't know.

254
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,333
The guard stopped her
when she was leaving with a suitcase.

255
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,625
I think you need to spend some time
with her, Raj.

256
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,458
Come home if you aren't busy.

257
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,083
These Japanese want the estimates
for the advertising budgets.

258
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,083
Jhanvi is on leave.
We need the figures urgently, sir.

259
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,583
Contact her wherever she is
or do something else.

260
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,750
-Where is she?
-She's outside.

261
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,250
I spoke to her.
Don't bring up that topic.

262
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,375
-Why did she try to leave home?
-She is angry with us.

263
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,708
Did you get her anything?

264
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:39,792
You didn't tell me to.

265
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,667
You are so dumb, Raj.
Couldn't you think of it yourself?

266
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,292
-Hi, dear. What are you doing?
-We started with alphabet today.

267
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,833
Wow. How many letters did you learn?

268
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,625
Just one. "A."

269
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,000
What is "A" for?

270
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,917
Tell me, dear.

271
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,167
Munni, "A" for?

272
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,583
Munni, "A" for?

273
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,875
<i>Akka.</i>

274
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,375
Hey... Why do you say that?

275
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,458
You named fruits starting with "A."

276
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,792
<i>Akka</i> is a Telugu word,
not an English word.

277
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,000
Munni, I want to show you
a funny alphabet song.

278
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,917
You will laugh out loud.

279
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,583
Watch.

00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,708

00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,875

<i>Zooperman</i>!

306
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,250
Play it again, Dad.

307
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:35,583
I'll play it,
but you have to promise me something.

308
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,708
You shouldn't eat anything that has nuts.

309
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,375
If Mommy and Daddy tell you
not to eat cereals or chocolates

310
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,625
you shouldn't eat it.

311
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,583
Promise me.

312
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,917
You're a good girl, sweetheart.

313
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,292
Hello. I'm coming.

314
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,292
-What's the progress?
-We have installed steam nozzles.

315
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:09,708
We've brought glass and acrylic
for the door and windows.

316
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,250
Which one do you want?

317
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,708
Which one will prevent heat from escaping?

318
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,875
Glass has higher heat reflectance.

319
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,042
Whereas acrylic needs to be replaced.

320
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:21,792
If we double panel this unbreakable glass,
it will be stronger.

321
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,875
<i>A for ANDAR-WARE</i>

322
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,833

<i>F for FOLICE</i>

327
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,875
Is that the alphabet song, dear?
My daughter loves it too.

328
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,458
When it goes <i>U for Umtabh Bachchan</i>,
it'd leave her in splits.

329
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,792
How long will it take to fit the glass?
We are expecting guests.

330
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:48,292
The glass is cut and ready.
It takes a couple of hours to fix it.

331
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,667
Bring the glass inside.

332
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,000
Daddy... Daddy, see this.

333
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,042
Which hotel has a Japanese restaurant?

334
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,167
-No, that's a Chinese restaurant.
-Dad...

335
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,250
-Look at me!
-Japanese food is different from Chinese.

336
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,458
Daddy, look.

337
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,125
Check if it's available at the ITC.

338
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,958
Daddy... See this.

339
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes, for lunch.

340
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,333
Their top management and our staff.

341
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,375
Daddy, look at me.

342
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,792
A single table for all.

343
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,875
-Dad, I've got both my legs on it.
-Japanese wine too.

344
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,083
Japanese wine, not Indian wine.

345
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:24,375
Daddy, I have got both my legs on it.

346
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,542
We need not import it from Japan.
We can get it locally.

347
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,208
-Raj, Munni is trying to talk to you.
-Daddy...

348
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,333
One second.

349
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,833
Stop it, Munni. I am on the phone.
Be quiet, okay?

350
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:43,208
If they don't have enough tables,
book the whole restaurant for three hours.

351
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,125
Raj...

352
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,708
Have you gone mad?

353
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,417
She knocked me down with her scooter.

354
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,583
Leena, we need to take her
to a child psychiatrist.

355
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,583
I'll talk to her. You carry on.

356
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:50,542
Why are you getting so angry these days,
particularly with your dad?

357
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,958
Did he scold you?

358
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,917
Dad suffered a terrible fall.
Why did you thrust the scooter on him?

359
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,667
I didn't do it, Mommy.

360
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,583
Then did the scooter hit your dad
of its own accord?

361
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,917
Munni, if we do bad things
to other people,

362
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:09,250
worse things will happen to us.

363
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:12,333
We like Daddy a lot, don't we?
Yes or no?

364
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:14,417
Yes.

365
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,167
Will you say sorry to him
when he comes home?

366
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,333
But I didn't push the scooter, Mom.

367
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,292
Well, let's think it was an accident.

368
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,583
You should apologize for the accident.
Okay?

369
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:28,708
Okay.

370
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,375
Get dressed
and come to the steam room.

371
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,208
Come inside.

372
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,208
Shall we switch on the steam?

373
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,875
Breathe in through the nose,
breathe out through the mouth.

374
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,083
Breath in through the nose,
breath out through the mouth.

375
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,208
Your asthma will be cured
if you do this every day.

376
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,750
-Will you do it?
-Yes, Mommy.

377
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:21,417
If you want to talk to me
when you are inside,

378
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
press this button to talk.

379
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,167
I can hear you from
anywhere in the house. Okay?

380
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,667
Go upstairs and learn the names of fruits
beginning with A.

381
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:34,250
I will finish up the work here
and we will start with the letter B.

382
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,250
Okay?

383
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,250
Yes, let's leave.
Mom is busy.

384
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,708
-<i>Munni is trying to get out, ma'am.</i>
-What?

385
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,208
-Please come down, dear.
-Hey, let go of me.

386
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,750
Let go of my hand.

387
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:22,708
Let go.

388
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:46,000
Smells good. What's for dinner?

389
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,583
-Prawns curry.
-Oh.

390
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,583
-Where's the little imp?
-In her room. She's grounded.

391
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,500
What did she do?

392
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,083
She tried to leave the house again.

393
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,458
She did it again?

394
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,083
I tried to talk to her.
She wouldn't tell me anything.

395
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:07,042
Should we take her to a doctor,
like a child psychologist,

396
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,333
to find out the problem?

397
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,958
Not yet.
Let's hire a full-time babysitter.

398
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,458
Let's wait for some time.

399
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,875
The babysitter is confirmed.
We got the details.

400
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:26,958
Nutella.

401
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:29,875
-There is no Nutella in the house.
-I want Nutella.

402
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,292
Dear, you shouldn't have Nutella.
It is made with nuts.

403
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,458
You have made a promise
that you wouldn't eat anything

404
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:38,833
that we don't approve of.

405
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:43,750
You've forgotten your promise.
Make a promise again.

406
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,542
You're a good girl.

407
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,333
-Vinod.
-Your babysitter has been vetted.

408
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,583
She is a widow from Vizag.
She has a brother who lives there.

409
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,333
Okay. Thanks, man.

410
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,583
It's Vinod.
He says the babysitter is good to hire.

411
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,500
Well, where are we
with the alphabet classes?

412
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,583
We are still stuck at "A."

413
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,083
She is very busy.
We can go further if she gets free.

414
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,833
I'm not busy. It's you who has been busy.

415
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,208
Oh!

416
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,792
You shouldn't talk like that to your mom.

417
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,042
Ma'am, a woman named Kamala is here.

418
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,458
Send her in.

419
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,875
Come in, Ms. Kamala.

420
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,333
Mommy made a <i>dosa</i> for me this morning.
It was delicious.

421
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,833
Do you want to eat a <i>dosa</i>?

422
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,375
Raj, this is Ms. Kamala.

423
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,750
-She's our little girl, Munni.
-Hello, dear.

424
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,583
Ms. Jyothi has told me everything.

425
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:50,583
Ms. Kamala, you have to keep
an eye on Munni all the time.

426
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,000
Never leave her alone.

427
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,750
-Leena, tell her about Munni's allergies.
-Okay.

428
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,000
-Bye, dear.
-Bye, Leena.

429
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,708
Munni shouldn't eat anything made
with nuts

430
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,833
like almonds, pistachios and peanuts.

431
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,458
She is allergic to them
and her lungs get blocked.

432
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:09,458
It can be very dangerous.
Be careful with her.

433
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,208
She should always wear this inhaler.
If she removes it, please put it back.

434
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:16,875
If she makes a fuss, call me.

435
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,583
You shouldn't annoy her.

436
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,958
Show her your schoolroom.
I'll call you once breakfast is ready.

437
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,625
You can keep your bag in the room
beside the stairs.

438
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,333
This way.

439
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,000
Wow! Your schoolroom is very nice, Munni.

440
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,542
What shall we do now?

441
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:04,167
We can do anything you want.
What do you want to do?

442
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:09,625
Let's play.

443
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,125
You want to play.
What kind of game?

444
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,500
Hide and seek.

445
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,083
-Hide and seek?
-Yes.

446
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,125
You role-play as a cop
and I, a robber.

447
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,208
Close your eyes and count to ten.

448
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:38,958
I am going to hide.
You shall come and catch me.

449
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:16,708
Where are you going?

450
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,125
Put it inside and come for breakfast.

451
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,750
I don't want breakfast.

452
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,500
Ms. Kamala, don't let her
out of your sight even for a second.

453
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:35,792
Take her inside.

454
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,333
Give it to me.

455
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:54,250
Hey, Munni, you have a lot of board games.

456
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,375
Hey, Monopoly! I love Monopoly.
Let's play.

457
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:05,583
If I had so many board-games,
I would never leave this room.

458
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,167
Hey... I saw it.

459
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,292
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

460
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,250
Ms. Kamala...

461
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:14,875
Ms. Kamala...

462
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:20,000
-Ms. Kamala... Wait.
-Oh, no! I can't stay here.

463
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:46,208
Munni, do you know what this is?
Come, I'll show you.

464
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:40,458
Munni, Mom and I want to ask you
something. Can we ask?

465
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,583
-Do you like Mommy and Daddy?
-Yes.

466
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,708
Do you like us a lot?

467
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:53,000
If you like us so much,
why are you trying to go away from us?

468
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,875
I'm asking you,
why are you trying to leave the house?

469
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,292
Okay, leave it.

470
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,250
-Why did you scare Ms. Kamala away?
-I didn't do it, Daddy.

471
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,708
Mom was downstairs, and I wasn't home.

472
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,875
You were the only one with her.
You must have done something.

473
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,167
I didn't do it, Daddy.

474
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:22,708
Who else could it have been
if it weren't you?

475
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:23,792
Sister did it.

476
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,500
Your sister couldn't have done it.
She is dead.

477
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,125
-She wouldn't do such things.
-Yes, it was her.

478
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,042
Did she throw crockery at me
and hit me with the scooter?

479
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,750
She died because of you.
That's why she attacked you.

480
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,125
You'll kill me too.
That's why I want to go away from you.

481
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,500
The house is fully secure.

482
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,292
Is it done, Kiran?

483
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:16,833
Yes, sir.

484
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,083
Even if Munni opens a window,
the alarm will go off.

485
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,625
If you don't enter the code
within 30 seconds

486
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,917
the police station would receive a signal.

487
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And they'll be here within five minutes.

488
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,708
Enter a code that you can remember, Leena.

489
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,833
Got you, little thief! Caught you!

490
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:45,917
Munni, do you know what I do
when I catch thieves?

491
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,750
I put them in jail.

492
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,583
-Shall I put you in jail too?
-No, sir.

493
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:56,208
You are very naughty.
We have a jail for mischievous kids too.

494
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,333
-I'll lock you up there.
-I'm not mischievous.

495
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,542
But your mom and dad say
that you're full of mischief.

496
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:02,667
They are lying.

497
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,417
Then, we have a jail for liars too.

498
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,167
-Shall we lock up your mom and dad there?
-Yes.

499
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,667
You're a good girl, sweetheart!

500
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,500
Leena, don't worry if you forget the code.

501
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,083
The alarm can be disabled
from the police station.

502
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:21,625
Thanks, buddy.

503
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:25,958
I think I should resign from my job
and become his personal security officer.

504
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,250
-You guys always keep me busy.
-Sorry, man.

505
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,208
See you later.
I need to get to the office.

506
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,125
That's it. We can't go out now.

507
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:48,250
How can we go out?
The alarm will go off if we open any door.

508
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,292
What's your idea?

509
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,333
-Mommy.
-What?

510
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:09,167
-Where is Dad?
-He went to work.

511
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,667
I'm hungry.

512
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,458
-Lunch is ready.
-What did you cook?

513
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>-Dal Rasam</i> and potato fry.
-I don't want it. I want a pizza.

514
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,833
Place an order.

515
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,333
-What kind of pizza?
-Cheese pizza.

516
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,583
The delivery guy is here, ma'am.

517
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:55,917
Hey...

518
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,250
-Ma'am.
-Where's the delivery guy?

519
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,708
-He is at the door.
-<i>I don't see him.</i>

520
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,250
-Hey, what are you doing?
-The box just flew out of my hand.

521
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:11,250
-Shut up! Is that our pizza?
-No, I'll cancel the order.

522
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,625
Hey, stop!

523
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,083
Hey...

524
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,458
Stop...

525
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:31,667
Hey... Stop.

526
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:33,125
Stop...

527
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,417
Stop...
Stop...

528
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,208
Stop...

529
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,167
Munni...

530
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,417
-Munni...
-Stop there. Stop there, man.

531
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,750
Hold on...

532
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,583
Stop...

533
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:57,292
Why did you come out of the house?
Why did you get on to that scooter?

534
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,167
You won't listen to me, will you?

535
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,708
You're going to continue with this.

536
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,583
-I'll tell your Dad.
-Please, Mom, don't tell Daddy.

537
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:11,000
No, I'll tell him what you did.
He'll know what to do with you.

538
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,917
Please, Mom. Don't tell Daddy.
He will beat me.

539
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,875
If you don't want me to tell him,

540
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,833
you should stop behaving like this.

541
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,042
What do you say?

542
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:49,333
Mommy, am I a bad girl?

543
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,500
Not at all, sweetheart.

544
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,042
Inhale this.

545
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:08,375
Give it here.

546
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,875
It's empty. The medicine is over.

547
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,833
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay, Mommy.

548
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:16,500
Okay, go to sleep.

549
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,292
I'll go and get the refills.

550
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:43,958
Raj...

551
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:45,500
Raj...

552
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:47,542
Raj...

553
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,042
-Raj.
-What is it?

554
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:51,333
-Munni is missing.
-What!

555
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,417
I put her to bed right here.
She is not there now.

556
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,542
Where might she be?

557
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,750
Stop crying.
She must be around here.

558
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,625
Raj...

559
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:17,708
Munni...

560
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,000
Munni...

561
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,208
Munni!

562
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,875
Munni...

563
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,250
Munni...

564
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,958
Munni...

565
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:31,875
Munni...

566
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,167
Munni...

567
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,167
Munni...

568
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,667
Munni...

569
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,875
Munni...

570
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:03,375
Munni...

571
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,250
-Come to the main door.
-Okay, sir. I'm coming.

572
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,708
-Who was on duty last night?
-I was.

573
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:30,875
-Did you see Munni go out?
-No, sir.

574
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,625
-Were you awake?
-Yes, sir.

575
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,167
Where is Munni?

576
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,458
Where is Munni, Raj?

577
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:42,667
What happened to her?

578
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,458
She left this behind.

579
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,125
What will she do
if she suffers an asthma attack?

580
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,708
I was planning to pay you a visit.
What's the matter?

581
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,125
Let's go inside.

582
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,208
What happened?

583
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,792
Yes.
We put her to bed last night.

584
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:30,250
She was missing in the morning.

585
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:33,708
-Did you search the whole house?
-We did, she is nowhere to be seen.

586
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:34,875
Didn't the alarm go off?

587
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,292
-No.
-Did you check the CCTV footage?

588
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,542
We did. There was nothing.

589
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,042
It's like she just disappeared.

590
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,833
Let me see the footage once.

591
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,792
This is last night's footage.

592
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,542
That's Leena coming back
from the supermarket.

593
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,708
She checked on Munni before going to bed.

594
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:25,375
What's this?
Play it again.

595
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,375
Leena, see this.

596
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,708
Let's go back a little more.

597
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,833
Raj. What's happening here?

598
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,625
She said that she didn't do it.

599
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,458
I didn't believe her.

600
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:05,208
This is no ordinary missing case.
I hope you understand that.

601
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:11,708
There is an unwanted guest in this house.

602
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,750
Unwanted guest? What does that mean?

603
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,958
What do we do now? Please help us.

604
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:19,708
Where is Munni, Vinod?

605
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:23,042
Leena, you both need to calm down.

606
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,792
-Let me make a phone call first.
-Please handle this delicately.

607
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,458
First, it was Shreya, and now Munni.

608
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,917
I have a merger going on.
The media will make me their target.

609
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,792
Don't you think I understand that?

610
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:40,542
This guy isn't answering the call.
Sit tight. I'll go and get him.

611
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:42,292
-Who is he?
-Spirits.

612
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:47,542
There isn't much difference
between spirits and animals.

613
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,667
Take dogs for example.

614
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:53,125
If you approach them with fear,
they try to scare you more.

615
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:55,625
But when you put up a brave face
and ignore them,

616
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:57,125
they leave you alone.

617
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,167
It's the same with spirits.

618
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,500
They scare only those
who are already scared.

619
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:05,667
They possess cowardly
and psychologically weak people.

620
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,125
<i>Oh, God...</i>

621
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,875
This guy's name is Yadayya.
He habitually slept outside his house.

622
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,250
Wicked spirits used to trouble him
every night.

623
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,042
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

624
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,333
Your seniors learned about this case
and gave Yadayya an idea.

625
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:47,542
<i>Come on, you stupid spirits.</i>
<i>I am going to burn all of you today.</i>

626
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:48,625
<i>I dare you.</i>

627
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:58,917
That's it.
The spirits stopped troubling Yadayya.

628
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,042
Her name is Lalitha.

629
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:05,792
Her husband was having an affair
with her sister.

630
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,333
She was devastated
when she came to know about it.

631
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,875
Moreover, her husband used to abuse
and assault her.

632
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:16,083
She became a mental wreck
and attempted suicide.

633
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,000
As Lalitha was psychologically disturbed,

634
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,958
a spirit considered her a good host.

635
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,542
The spirit possessed Lalitha.

636
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,250
And she tried to kill
her sister and husband.

637
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,625
What happened to Lalitha after that?

638
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:58,500
With that, the spirit left Lalitha's body.

639
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,250
Scared of Lalitha,
her husband mended his ways.

640
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,458
They are happy now.

641
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,167
There is one common factor
in both these examples.

642
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,625
Can you tell me what that is?

643
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,917
Heat.

644
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,292
When Yadayya threatened the spirits
with fire, they left him alone.

645
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,083
When I burnt Lalitha with a cigar,
the spirit left her.

646
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,417
Spirits are afraid of heat.

647
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,750
You would have seen a lot of people

648
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,917
with scars on their foreheads,
about the size of a coin.

649
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,333
This is an old technique
passed down by our ancestors.

650
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,333
In olden days,
in order to drive out spirits,

651
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:31,208
they used to burn people with cigars.

652
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:35,333
So you say that if we smoke
cigarettes and cigars regularly,

653
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,167
the spirits would leave us alone.

654
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,208
What brings Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?

655
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,792
Sherlock Holmes needs Dr. Watson's help.

656
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:51,542
A close friend of mine is in big trouble.

657
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,208
This is not something the cops can handle.

658
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,625
Hello. I am Pavan Sharma.

659
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,833
I'm Raj. This is my wife, Leena.

660
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:20,542
Vinod has briefed me.

661
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:34,333
-When did you move in here?
-About four to five days ago.

662
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,292
Raj, I can't take it
if something happens to Munni.

663
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:21,375
Nothing will happen to Munni.
She'll be safe.

664
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,208
Where did you see the child last?

665
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,500
Right here. I put her to sleep.

666
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:46,708
Generally, kids like to hide themselves.

667
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,625
Did she do stuff like that?

668
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,458
No, sir.

669
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,667
But after we moved here,
she tried to get out of here many times.

670
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,417
What do you mean?

671
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,750
She tried to run away from home
a few times.

672
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,750
We were able to stop her luckily.

673
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:07,000
There are cameras all over the house.
Can I check the footage?

674
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,917
This is definitely
the work of a wicked spirit.

675
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,833
Munni is with the evil entity.

676
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But, Mr. Sharma...

677
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,542
why would a spirit
want to take Munni away?

678
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:35,000
And where would it take her?

679
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,875
If we can find out why it took her,
we can track where it took her.

680
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,833
Anyway, I have to check something.

681
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,500
I'll go upstairs and be back.
Watch my movements.

682
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,708
How did you get out?
You evaded the camera.

683
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:55,167
There are a lot of blind spots
not covered by the cameras.

684
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,500
If you follow them,
you can avoid the cameras.

685
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:00,750
How did you get past the security alarm?

686
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:03,250
Through the exit at the rear of the house.

687
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,083
Why is that door not connected
to the alarm?

688
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,250
Rear exit is not secured?

689
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,458
We don't use that exit
as we don't have servants.

690
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:14,625
The security guys must have missed it.
We didn't notice it too.

691
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,042
The spirit took note of this mistake.

692
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:21,708
This spirit has a purpose and plan,
and the intelligence to execute it.

693
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,875
Anyway, have you noticed any change
in the kid's behavior

694
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:26,458
after moving into this house?

695
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,958
I mean, other than trying to run away
from home.

696
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:35,833
Other than that,
anything strange in the child's behavior?

697
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,875
Munni has always been a moody child.

698
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,875
Thought she'd get better with time.

699
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:46,500
But I felt her behavior had gotten worse
after coming to this house

700
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,083
and scolded her a few times.

701
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,833
But now I know
that it wasn't her fault at all.

702
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,958
She thinks I'm responsible
for the death of our elder daughter.

703
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:01,292
-Maybe that's why she is angry with me.
-How did she die?

704
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,125
She suffered an asthma attack
while swimming, and we lost her.

705
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,333
Munni too suffers from asthma.

706
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,750
Sugar clock. I have to eat something.

707
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,083
Are there any biscuits or cookies at home?

708
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:20,708
I'll check.

709
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:08,917
Snicker bar. Nowadays these things
come loaded with nuts.

710
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:11,667
Can you eat chocolates
if you're a diabetic?

711
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,042
Borderline.

712
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,833
Chocolates are fine sometimes
if there's nothing else.

713
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:18,083
Nuts in this provide a little energy.

714
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,833
Munni should not eat nuts.

715
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,583
If she does, it triggers an asthma attack.

716
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,917
Then why do you have these?
Is it for you?

717
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:31,250
No, no. Leena and I don't eat chocolates.

718
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,042
We don't even buy them.

719
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:36,458
Then where did this come from?
There is a whole box of them.

720
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:05,708
We don't bring chocolates home,
and definitely not the ones with nuts.

721
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,667
Someone bought these yesterday.

722
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:44,792
Leena went to the supermarket last night
to buy inhaler refills.

723
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:48,708
-Why would she buy chocolates?
-Maybe she felt like eating one.

724
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:51,958
Someone opened it
and took a couple of chocolate bars.

725
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:56,208
Let me check with her.

726
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,333
She's not answering.
Leena...

727
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:12,042
Leena...

728
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:16,042
Leena...

729
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:21,250
Leena...

730
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,500
Leena...

731
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:40,625
Leena...

732
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:45,917
Leena...

733
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:53,042
Why did you buy those chocolates
last night?

734
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,542
I'm asking you.

735
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:58,458
Leena...

736
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:16,875
Leena!

737
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,417
Leena...

738
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,083
Leena...
Leena...

739
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,542
-Hey, Leena!
-Hey...

740
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,208
Raj...

741
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,458
Raj...

742
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:54,750
Raj...

743
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:55,792
Raj...

744
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,250
What is that?

745
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:06,375
A woman possessed by a spirit
or a spirit possessing a woman.

746
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:12,292
I weigh 95 kilos. She easily lifted me
into the air and threw me down.

747
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,000
A spirit is like steam.

748
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,792
Without boundaries to define it,
it's powerless.

749
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,250
The steam that's generated while cooking
can only shake the lid of the vessel.

750
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,958
But the steam inside a pressure cooker
or a steam engine has tremendous power.

751
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:27,750
She can do anything
with such power.

752
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:31,500
The human body is like a pressure chamber
for a spirit.

753
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,875
The pressure of the spirit inside the body
can make a person do anything.

754
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,292
A powerful spirit has possessed your wife.

755
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,542
How can Leena be possessed by a spirit?

756
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,417
What spirit? Whose spirit?

757
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,042
I can't answer
all your questions, Mr. Raj.

758
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:51,458
But I'm sure that this spirit
has done something to your child.

759
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:52,917
It has taken her somewhere.

760
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:55,042
When did your elder child pass away?

761
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,417
Are you saying that Shreya's spirit
possessed my wife

762
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,917
and took Munni away?

763
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,542
Our entire focus should be
on finding Munni.

764
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,542
After watching the CCTV footage,
locating the blind spots

765
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:14,000
and seeing Leena's condition now,
I am able to connect some dots.

766
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:16,917
This spirit failed to take Munni away
on its own,

767
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,583
so it possessed your wife
and made her do it.

768
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,333
You mean, Leena has taken Munni...

769
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,958
Taking aid of the blind spots,
your wife took Munni somewhere last night.

770
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,833
Where could she have taken Munni?

771
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:12,667
-Vinod.
-Did you get any leads?

772
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:16,792
It's Leena.
She's possessed by a spirit.

773
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,833
She took Munni out in her car last night.

774
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,917
She told Raj
that she was going to a supermarket

775
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,167
to buy inhaler refills.

776
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:59,208
Did you find anything
on Munni's whereabouts?

777
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:10,542
Yes. Soon we'll find out everything.

778
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:35,667
Kiran, I've sent you a photo
and an address on WhatsApp.

779
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,000
Just visit the supermarkets
near that address

780
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:41,250
and check if the lady in the photo
visited any of them recently.

781
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,250
God knows where and how the poor girl is.

782
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,500
I can't bear this.

783
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:03,458
-What is this?
-Don't ask me what this is.

784
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,500
The spirit is not in her now.

785
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,833
She doesn't remember what she did
when she was possessed.

786
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,583
So she doesn't remember where Munni is?

787
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:13,292
I've told you that she doesn't remember
what she did.

788
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,792
-How can that be?
-Why don't you try finding out?

789
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,083
Go ask her why she bought the chocolates.

790
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:19,875
No, I won't. You ask her.

791
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,458
Why should I? She is your wife.
You ask her.

792
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,625
But you are the expert in these matters.

793
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,833
I sure am the expert, but she's your wife.

794
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,000
And you sport a huge physique.

795
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,333
-Please.
-Damn.

796
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,958
Want to have a word with you.

797
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:54,417
Can you tell me why you have chocolates
in your house?

798
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:01,750
Our daughter is missing.
It's heart-rending.

799
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,667
Please tell us what happened
to our daughter.

800
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,208
We can talk about chocolates
and biscuits later.

801
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:11,417
We want our daughter back.

802
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,000
Please bring her back.

803
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:29,708
What did I tell you?
She doesn't remember anything.

804
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,375
This is stupid. I'll ask her myself.

805
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:41,333
Leena, where did you
take Munni last night?

806
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:44,208
Answer me.

807
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:51,625
Mr. Sharma...

808
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,417
Only the spirit can tell us
where Munni is.

809
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,750
The spirit must possess Leena
to provide us answers.

810
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:05,375
If the spirit leaves Leena,
Leena won't remember anything.

811
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:56,625
Leena, where did you
take Munni last night?

812
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:58,417
Please tell me, Leena.

813
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,917
Rajkumar Rao!

814
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:37,917
You coward!

815
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,125
Where are you hiding?

816
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,042
Show yourself.

817
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,125
Leena, please tell us where Munni is.

818
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:05,792
Does the lady in this photo
come here to shop?

819
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,083
Bring Leena to the steam room somehow.

820
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:32,792
Yes, Kiran.

821
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:35,500
That lady is a regular shopper
at the store near her house.

822
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:37,417
But she hasn't been there the last week.

823
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,958
Rajkumar Rao!

824
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,292
Where the hell are you?

825
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,167
Today you are done for.

826
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:57,875
Hey, show yourself!

827
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:03,333
Leena...

828
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:12,833
Where is Munni?

829
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,167
I've sent you a mobile number.

830
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,125
Track the number's locations
during the last week.

831
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:34,292
Coerce the mobile operator for details.

832
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:46,333
If there is one thing spirits can't take,
it's heat.

833
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:24,875
-Yes?
-I've tracked that number.

834
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:26,667
<i>I've sent you the final location.</i>

835
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:31,583
But there was another mobile number
along with the one we have been tracking.

836
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:34,167
-Whose number is it?
-<i>It's Rajkumar Rao's.</i>

837
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:39,250
Tell me. Where is Munni?

838
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,167
What did you do to Munni?

839
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:46,833
Ask him.
Tell him to say what he did to me.

840
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:50,750
Who the hell are you?

841
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:52,792
He knows me very well.

842
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,833
Tell him what you did to me.

843
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:58,333
Please tell us where Munni is.

844
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,000
Munni is all that we have.

845
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,917
We can't afford to lose her.

846
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,875
Do you feel it?
Are you feeling the pain now?

847
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:09,542
My parents too are searching for me.

848
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,667
They are devastated
not knowing what happened to me.

849
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,792
I don't understand what you are saying.

850
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:17,958
Munni is a little girl.
Please tell us where she is.

851
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,000
Munni is going to die.

852
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,458
She will wake up from sleep.

853
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:23,708
She will be hungry.

854
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:27,042
She will find chocolates in her hand.

855
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,875
She will eat them.

856
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,375
She will die unable to breathe.

857
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:33,958
She will die.

858
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,750
Please don't talk like that, Leena.

859
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:40,208
She is our kid, Leena.

860
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:42,750
Where is Munni? Please tell me.

861
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,292
Speak up! Where did you hide Munni?

862
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:45,292
Raj...

863
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,667
Leena...

864
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,125
Leena is in pain.

865
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:56,833
Temperature has hit danger levels.

866
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:01,708
If we maintain this heat,
her flesh will fall off her bones.

867
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:05,458
If she doesn't tell us,
we'll have to let her out.

868
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:07,750
Or Leena would be in danger.

869
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,542
What is this, sir?

870
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,833
We have lost Shreya, Leena.

871
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:16,125
We can't lose Munni too.
Please tell me where she is.

872
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:17,333
Where is Munni?

873
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,708
My parents too have lost me.

874
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,208
You made sure
that they can't even find my body.

875
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,500
What did you do to my dead body?

876
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:30,125
What dead body? I don't understand.

877
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,750
Tell me!

878
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:34,167
Reveal the whereabouts of my dead body!

879
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,833
Please answer her if you know.
Leena is in grave danger.

880
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,333
If the spirit leaves Leena,
we would never know where Munni is.

881
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:49,333
Come on, tell me!

882
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:52,875
Who are you?
What is your name?

883
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,833
Tell me.

884
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:56,500
Tell me!

885
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,917
Will you reveal it or not?

886
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,417
Tell me.

887
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,958
Where did you hide Munni?

888
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,417
What is your name?

889
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,000
Tell me!

890
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:07,500
Tell me!

891
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,583
Tell me now!

892
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:53,708
Jhanvi.

893
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:57,625
My name is Jhanvi.

894
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:05,708
<i>Jhanvi, Munni has removed the inhaler.</i>
<i>Put it back.</i>

895
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:07,417
<i>-Johnson Grammar school.</i>
<i>-Munni.</i>

896
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:09,750
<i>Yes?</i>

897
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,167
Mommy, I'm hungry.

898
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:48,000
Raj.

899
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
What's the matter?

900
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,958
Disable Rajkumar Rao's security system.

901
01:33:06,917 --> 01:33:09,042
Answer me.
We can't keep Leena inside for long.

902
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,208
Who is Jhanvi?

903
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,542
Jhanvi has been missing
since the night before the merger.

904
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:37,958
Her parents have filed a complaint.

905
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:41,417
You were the only person with her
before she went missing, Raj.

906
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,917
My executive assistant.

907
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,292
My employee.

908
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,417
She is dead...

909
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,500
...because of me.

910
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,375
Because of you? How?

911
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:01,167
She came to my office
to join as a management trainee.

912
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:09,333
<i>Your professor has written</i>
<i>in this recommendation letter</i>

913
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:14,333
<i>that one must be totally stupid</i>
<i>to not hire you.</i>

914
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:19,417
<i>Do I look stupid to you?</i>

915
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:29,417
<i>It would be really stupid not to hire you.</i>

916
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,417
The next day was the merger.

917
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,292
My life's biggest achievement.

918
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:04,917
<i>All of you know how hard we worked</i>
<i>for this merger.</i>

919
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,917
<i>Sometimes, even the smallest mistake</i>
<i>can result in humongous loss.</i>

920
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:17,083
<i>Jhanvi, email me my speech before you go.</i>

921
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:25,000
<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

922
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:26,583
<i>Are you back home, dear?</i>

923
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,542
<i>No, Mom. I'm still at work.</i>

924
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,458
<i>Did you have dinner?</i>

925
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:34,167
<i>Not yet. I'll get something</i>
<i>from the supermarket on the way back.</i>

926
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,958
<i>I'll call you once I reach home.</i>

927
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,042
<i>Why are you ignoring me of late?</i>

928
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:42,917
<i>Don't put on an act.</i>
<i>Don't you know that I like you?</i>

929
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,583
<i>Sir, please leave me alone.</i>

930
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:48,542
<i>People in the office are gossiping about</i>
<i>your special care towards me.</i>

931
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,125
<i>I've emailed you your speech.</i>

932
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:52,750
<i>Jhanvi.</i>

933
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:54,708
<i>Jhanvi.</i>

934
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,875
<i>What's the problem?</i>
<i>Am I too old for you?</i>

935
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:22,250
<i>Just feel this once,</i>
<i>these youngsters are no match for me.</i>

936
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:24,625
<i>Is it because I'm a married guy?</i>

937
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:27,583
<i>This is different.</i>
<i>Don't worry about what people say.</i>

938
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:31,250
<i>I've planned something for us</i>
<i>to be together after this merger.</i>

939
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:34,750
<i>Once you hear my plan,</i>
<i>you will know how much I like you.</i>

940
01:37:38,292 --> 01:37:39,792
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

941
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,375
<i>Jhanvi...</i>

942
01:37:43,542 --> 01:37:44,875
<i>Jhanvi...</i>

943
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:00,875
<i>Jhanvi...</i>
<i>Jhanvi...</i>

944
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,708
My world just collapsed around me.

945
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:19,750
The next day
was the multi-million dollar merger.

946
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,958
I was scared that Leena,
my family and my whole life

947
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:25,500
would slip away from my hands.

948
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,000
I didn't know what to do.

949
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:32,958
Come on.

950
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:44,583
Tell me! Where is my body?

951
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,500
Tell her, Raj.

952
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:54,833
St. Joseph's cemetery.

953
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:57,958
It's at St. Joseph's cemetery.

954
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:07,375
Now tell me where Munni is.

955
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:08,875
Where is Munni?

956
01:40:26,458 --> 01:40:27,292
Leena...

957
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,125
Leena.

958
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:32,000
Leena.

959
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,000
Leena...
Leena.

960
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,958
Where is Munni, Leena?

961
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:46,167
Where is Munni, Leena?

962
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,583
Please wake up, Leena.
Where is Munni?

963
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,000
Call an ambulance now.

964
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,542
-Munni...
-Daddy.

965
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:41,667
Did you eat the chocolates? Did you?

966
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,917
I promised you
that I wouldn't eat anything with nuts.

967
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,667
You are a good girl, sweetheart.

968
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,333
You are a good girl.

969
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:53,042
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

970
01:41:57,292 --> 01:41:59,083
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

971
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:07,958
I'm sorry, my darling.

972
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:20,208
Why did Jhanvi's spirit possess Leena
and torment Raj?

973
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:22,417
After the life exhausted from her body,

974
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,875
the spirit must have thought
that it was still alive

975
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:29,083
<i>and would have escaped from the car.</i>

976
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,000
When it returned to the car,

977
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,542
<i>her body wasn't there.</i>

978
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,583
More than her death,

979
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:08,125
<i>Jhanvi couldn't bear</i>
<i>the pain her parents went through</i>

980
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:09,583
<i>not knowing her whereabouts.</i>

981
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:13,917
Where is our daughter, Jhanvi? Tell me.

982
01:43:15,625 --> 01:43:18,833
Besides wanting to let her parents know
where her body was,

983
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:23,375
she wanted Raj to feel the pain
of missing his daughter.

984
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:26,792
Only then would Raj admit to the truth.

985
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:32,458
Only Raj knew the whereabouts of her body.

986
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:36,417
As Raj naturally wouldn't admit his crime,
she tortured him till he admitted it.

987
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:41,292
With her parents finding her body,
Jhanvi's spirit must have found peace.

988
01:43:45,208 --> 01:43:47,917
That's why I come to you
for cases like this.

989
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:51,667
Don't be so modest.
You have just closed two cases.

990
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:54,917
How did you learn that Raj
was behind Jhanvi's disappearance?

991
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,917
I came to see Raj
as Jhanvi was his employee.

992
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,083
But he said Munni was missing,
so I couldn't ask him anything.

993
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:04,667
Being the intelligent man that he is,

994
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:08,750
he had hid the body at a place
we would never look for a dead body.

995
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:40,000
He deleted all the CCTV footage
at his office that would incriminate him.

996
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:02,042
He sent Jhanvi's leave application
from her own phone.

997
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:14,917
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

998
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:20,333
<i>But...</i>

999
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:24,792
his phone was right next to Jhanvi's phone
until it went dead.

1000
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:25,958
So we were able to nab him.

1001
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:34,417
-Leena?
-<i>You said you'd come for dinner?</i>

1002
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,625
<i>I am waiting for you.</i>

1003
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:36,792
I am coming.

1004
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:50,583
Sometimes the smallest mistakes
made by criminals

1005
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:52,667
help us solve
some of the biggest cases.

1006
01:45:53,667 --> 01:45:57,333
-Oh, no...
-Look at my Jhanvi...

1007
01:45:57,875 --> 01:46:00,458
-Oh, God! Look at my little girl...
-Oh, God...

1008
01:46:00,875 --> 01:46:03,167
-Oh, no...
-My dear...

1009
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,958
But this is a case of a freak accident.
It's not a murder case.

1010
01:46:07,167 --> 01:46:08,417
What are you going to do?

1011
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:10,833
Court will decide that, Mr. Sharma.

1012
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:13,875
Are you going to leave
the fate of your friend to court?

1013
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,083
I've done what I have to as a cop.

1014
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:17,375
Now I'll do what I need to do
as a friend.

1015
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:31,083
Inspector...
