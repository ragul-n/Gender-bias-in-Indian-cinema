1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,167
I am sorry that I didn't
get my education here.

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,171
But when given the chance to be
Vice Chancellor of the University...

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:51,176
I felt I had truly achieved a lot.

5
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,512
The family gives birth to a child.

6
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,183
The school turns him
into a human being.

7
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,519
With mercy.
- Salutations sire.

8
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,149
Servant of the University.
I'm student leader.

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,861
Final year student of law.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,201
Please sit down. Sit!

11
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,161
So as I was saying...

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,164
But when the institute
turns into an arena...

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,919
where violence and politics are
given more importance than education...

14
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,590
they stop churning out humans.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,680
This has been happening in
my country for quite some years.

16
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,772
Check the back...

17
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:05,310
I'll check who is creating the
ruckus. Let the program continue.

18
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,674
Just a minute.

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,762
This...

20
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,821
Stop right there.

21
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,082
Upstairs.

22
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:17,757
Running like blind men!

23
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,406
Don't kill him.
I'm on my way.

24
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,410
We've got him surrounded.
Today we'll finish him.

25
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,416
"He said not to shoot.
Okay, we won't shoot."

26
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,798
I'm dead!
- Catch the rascal!

27
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,437
Hit harder.
- We'll kill you!

28
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,025
Don't waste time.

29
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,448
Hit harder. Don't you
have strength in your arms?

30
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,954
Swing him hard.

31
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,799
You're asking for it!

32
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,177
Shall I shoot?

33
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,472
Listen to me...

34
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:34,519
You can't shoot.
Just chant some mantras.

35
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,484
Why are you yelling?

36
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,864
Just shoot the daylights out of him!

37
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,996
Your story ends here.

38
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,833
Shoot the shoulder
lest we land up in trouble.

39
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,463
I am here.

40
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:06,509
Your Pop.
- Now I'm in trouble.

41
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,516
Good day brother.

42
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,525
Get out of here.

43
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,538
Now you too must stand up.

44
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:40,835
Don't lie down like a guest.
Get up now.

45
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,594
That's better.

46
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,892
You'd have lost your life
I saved you.

47
00:07:55,892 --> 00:08:00,522
"I said, let him live a little
Thank me for it."

48
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:05,151
"Ranvijay Singh, take your
politics to another area."

49
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,572
You have my blessings.
You'll progress far.

50
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,495
But henceforth if you wave
your flag in the university...

51
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,587
What will happen?
- You'll be reduced.

52
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,923
There'll be a 2 minute
silence in your memory.

53
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,219
Some of your boys may
sing to bid you farewell.

54
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,390
What else can happen?

55
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,644
Will they declare a national
holiday in your memory?

56
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,652
Go on.

57
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,033
And listen...

58
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,954
I don't want to see you
here till the elections.

59
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,583
I know the village you come from.

60
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,086
Now goon.

61
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,592
Everything is fine. Sit down.

62
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,054
"Sit down, you nut!"

63
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,602
"What was wrong?
- Nothing, sir."

64
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,147
Everything is fine.
Watch the show.

65
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,656
Why don't the girls stay
this way all the time?

66
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,660
I tell you the problems
of the world will be solved.

67
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,330
America will never drop the bomb.

68
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,667
What are you doing?
The play is to start.

69
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,669
Move aside! One second...

70
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,715
Why are we committing this sin?
- Take a look!

71
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,971
Because it's our share.

72
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,687
Open your eyes. Learn something.

73
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,650
You're all grown now.
- I've really grown big.

74
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,702
She's terrific.

75
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:23,415
Why did you shut it?
- That's enough.

76
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,045
Memorise your lines.
It's show time

77
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,716
Come on.

78
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,762
Why did you shut the window
on Niharika? - Who is that?

79
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,182
Babul's sisters were
there. Have some shame.

80
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,395
Where were his sisters?
I didn't see a thing!

81
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,738
"The clouds of love blow"

82
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:03,079
"A wave rises in the desert"

83
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:10,795
"In the dying eyes of the night..."

84
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,718
"...you can see the morning"

85
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,853
"Your eyes can drive anyone nuts"

86
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:35,236
"Life isn't worth living without you"

87
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,784
"Your eyes can drive anyone nuts"

88
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,829
"Life isn't worth living without you"

89
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:50,210
"Life is meaningless unless
you are in my arms, in my life"

90
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,131
"Come close to me
don't feel shy"

91
00:11:55,131 --> 00:12:00,303
"Oh my beloved"

92
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:06,184
"You have the most exquisite eyes"

93
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,855
"Life isn't worth living without you"

94
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:40,802
"My dreams have come to life
since I set eyes on you"

95
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:47,809
"Nothing excites me
unless you are around"

96
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,897
"Come close so we can be one"

97
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,900
"Like fragrance"

98
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,823
"You've ousted God to
make place in my heart"

99
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:18,942
Stop chattering in Bengali.
Aren't we your friends?

100
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:23,238
My heart is beating hard.
I wish she would be mine.

101
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,282
I'll turn over a new leaf.

102
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,577
Let's talk to them.
- Enough of song and dance.

103
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,122
Now I want the main lead role.
- Cut it out.

104
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,290
If I don't get the main lead...

105
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,379
Monali and Sonali won't come to
the theatre. - Listen...

106
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,759
Why don't you throw him out?

107
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,805
Are we short of girls?

108
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,063
What is it?
- Let's go this way.

109
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,992
That's it. Stop here.

110
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,998
It's quite dark. Can you manage alone?
- Don't worry.

111
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,420
Just a minute.

112
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,008
Listen...

113
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:29,012
I live close by.
It's quite dark.

114
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,557
Will you please ride with my rickshaw?

115
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,019
I live in the left so I can't...

116
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,066
Hush. Follow me.

117
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,071
Follow him.

118
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,633
Have fun.

119
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,313
You'll fall down.
Your lace is undone.

120
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,067
It stays that way.
- Why?

121
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,696
I find tying laces very boring.

122
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,120
Turn here.

123
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,083
How much?
- Finished the program?

124
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,086
Or is something new
starting tomorrow?

125
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,382
"I'm late today, not everyday."

126
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,844
"And who is this?
- Good day uncle, aunt."

127
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:55,056
He studies with me in the
University. It was quite dark.

128
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,601
So I asked him to drive along.

129
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,397
And he did. He's quite free.

130
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,650
No... I live here.
In the railway colony.

131
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,114
I take the same path...
- What's your name?

132
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,123
Are you waiting for tea?

133
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:24,127
No thanks. See you.
Good day uncle... aunt.

134
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,468
Why did you have to
talk to him like this?

135
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,137
He loves to throw his weight around.

136
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:38,141
He scared the child.
- He's no child.

137
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,144
You'll see from tomorrow
he'll start coming here.

138
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,147
Your daughter encouraged him.

139
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:49,069
This is his way home.
- Let me see him do only that.

140
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,656
I mustn't see him
leaning against my gate!

141
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,133
Going out?

142
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:17,138
No.
- Then wear an ironed shirt?

143
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,184
I mean you could've
worn something else?

144
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,946
Happy?

145
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,877
Why is Papa like this?

146
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,173
What's wrong? - He makes
the house seem like a police station.

147
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,220
It's an issue of age. That's all.

148
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,181
Meaning?

149
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,519
You're doing what you
should do at this age.

150
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:10,483
And your father is doing
what he should at his age.

151
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,904
You're both good kids.

152
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,199
How was your show?

153
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,536
The show went off well.
It was great.

154
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:25,206
Has any of you seen Ani's show?

155
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,252
Whatever plays he does...

156
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:34,841
I've seen them all.
- I liked him best as Salim.

157
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:43,683
Do girls flock around him?

158
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:50,065
Your train. When will you return?

159
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:54,319
The morning day after.
By the Prayagraj Express.

160
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,291
Yes?
- Wear something.

161
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,294
You'll catch a cold.

162
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:16,383
Wear that same shirt.

163
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,303
Throw him down!

164
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:24,099
That's damn good!

165
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:58,425
I hear target practice was on.
- We fired just one shot.

166
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,680
What did I say over the
phone? Not to shoot!

167
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,891
He rushed into the University.
What could we do? Leave him?

168
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:11,021
Yes! You could've killed
him today or tomorrow!

169
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,774
No scene would've been created!

170
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:19,696
Excuse me but we don't
need hoodlums like you.

171
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,365
We're sorry...
- I am sorry!

172
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,367
Don't make us commit sin!

173
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,369
To blazes with you!

174
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:30,832
What will I answer if
a question is raised?

175
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,337
Don't you understand? There's a
Lower and Upper house where I'll go.

176
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,798
But you want to go...
- No! I can't!

177
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,884
Hold me here!

178
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,428
You must go there.
- Keep me here.

179
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:47,849
Build me a temple and pray to me!

180
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,437
He hurt his ear that day.
- You're both alike.

181
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,440
He has no brains
and he's missing a ear!

182
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,944
But I won't spare him!

183
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,907
I'll destroy him.

184
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:10,413
I didn't say we'll spare him.
We will kill him.

185
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:16,336
But in another city. Okay?
And you'll fire the shot.

186
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:25,762
Youth is that which can't be tied.

187
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,433
Turn the words to form air.

188
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:35,230
"Air flows. Gently, it's best."

189
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,776
"When it picks up strength,
it wrecks havoc."

190
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:45,115
So far a gentle breeze
is blowing in our campus.

191
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,451
But hot winds are blowing now.

192
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:53,790
Why are you burning blood?
- Lost blood and it's continuing.

193
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,463
Youth won't be split. He'll be cut...
- Come on.

194
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:06,469
They think their actions
will break our spirit.

195
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:13,268
Don't' go for a walk.
This has only 2 bullets.

196
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:18,481
"When we boil, a storm rises."

197
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,484
"When we're excited, storms rise."

198
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:25,488
"Man, don't try to change us."

199
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,534
History changes when we do.

200
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,501
"Good day. Sir, I flunked
English for 4 marks."

201
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,504
I can't get married
till I clear it.

202
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,132
Who asked you to learn English?
- Why shouldn't he?

203
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,510
It's nobody's Pop's
- Beg at his feet.

204
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,513
My father will beat me up.

205
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:54,351
Move aside.
- Listen...

206
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:02,192
Cover me.

207
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,783
I told you that day
don't spare me alive.

208
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,161
I wont' take long to kill you.

209
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,835
Stay within limits.

210
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,596
Meet in the night.

211
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,601
"I said...
- I said, go on."

212
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,950
What is god? Bearing
the wounds of destiny...

213
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,578
Or lifting arms?

214
00:24:55,578 --> 00:25:00,500
Alas that we could sleep
and say there's no pain...

215
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:14,597
Did anyone come here?
- No.

216
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:19,602
Goodbye studies. Acting here.

217
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,606
"Leave us alone.
- Okay, we're leaving."

218
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:27,652
Please don't' yell.

219
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,662
We'll cut this scene here.

220
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,626
God has given you
a special face.

221
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,629
And you transform it.

222
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:51,426
And camouflage your blush.

223
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:59,434
But that's enough.

224
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:06,149
She has driven me nuts!

225
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:32,592
You act very well.
- Thanks.

226
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,681
Know me?
- Yes.

227
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:42,185
"Now on, I also know you."

228
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:52,654
I too wanted to act.
Do you have a name or is it hero?

229
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:04,708
There's a door behind the
make up room. Get away.

230
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,379
I'll remember you.

231
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:38,742
Take a good look.
This is Bombay.

232
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:43,747
They have English guns
that blow up cars...

233
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:47,751
Will our cars fly like this?

234
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,756
That society is different.
Everyone is modern.

235
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,760
The hoods there go to Dubai
and England and Bombay.

236
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,722
Watch the film.

237
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,974
There it's pay up or die.

238
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,726
Here it's give the
chair or we kill.

239
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,063
Lot of difference.
- That's a small industry.

240
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:11,775
We run the nation.

241
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:18,782
"Yes, we're here."

242
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:33,421
What news?
- Gaurishankar making rounds.

243
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,802
Must be 500 boys.
- Can't go home.

244
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,805
We'll have to go elsewhere.

245
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,808
Gauri looked upset.
- Were you feeling sorry?

246
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,812
"No, not at all.
- You did the right thing."

247
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,816
What we mean is he'll do
anything. He has more force.

248
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:57,821
Go to the village for awhile.
- Meaning...

249
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:01,783
One slap will knock out your brains.

250
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,286
Run away because the army is larger?

251
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,792
You are the guerrilla
that has to make war

252
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:14,796
Read about them?
- Yes.

253
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:18,800
Attacks and vanishes.
- That's him.

254
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,804
Enough. That's it.

255
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,807
They are hoodlums and
we are revolutionaries.

256
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:29,853
You are the guerrilla.
Guerrilla war in the nation.

257
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,565
What?
- Yes.

258
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:43,158
Who is the heroine?
- Some new face.

259
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,876
Show us that one.

260
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:57,339
No... the checked one.

261
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,887
This is expensive.
Rs. 450 a meter.

262
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,890
Cut out 2. One for me
and another for him.

263
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,893
"Short sleeves for me,
long ones for him."

264
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,396
"Take it, I'll buy something tomorrow.
- Why?"

265
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:17,859
What's wrong with this?
Such a sober colour.

266
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:23,907
How will we look if
we wear the same shirt?

267
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,911
We'll look good. Cut it out.
- No.

268
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,914
You've been called for 2 minutes.
- Me?

269
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:34,501
I'll just get back.

270
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,506
Cut the piece.

271
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,513
"Welcome, artist."

272
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,974
How's your acting?
- First class.

273
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:56,940
Do you guys know him?
He is Anirudh.

274
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,944
Who?

275
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:05,949
You'll be spellbound by his acting

276
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,327
He acts very well.

277
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:12,956
He's always in the field.
Teach him a little.

278
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,960
See his cap. My prince.

279
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,963
Wearing a cap and reading a
magazine won't make you an actor.

280
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,967
Learn something. Teach him.

281
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,971
Come on. Want a cold drink?

282
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,975
No. - Beer?
- I don't drink liquor.

283
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:36,980
"Have it, keep you cool.
- My father is with me."

284
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,067
Another time.
- My son is in...

285
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,363
I tried to stop him...
- Why?

286
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:48,033
Who are they? - Stopping uncle.
- Are they your friends?

287
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,036
Yes. I mean we're
in the same University.

288
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:55,040
"I am Ranvijay Singh.
Law, final year."

289
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,043
"He's not in your class.
- No, they are."

290
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:02,005
Taufeeq studies in B. Com.

291
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,383
He's doing B. Sc.

292
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,345
He's doing BA.

293
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,388
He's like my younger brother.

294
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:14,351
Don't worry about rates.
- Do you live here?

295
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:19,022
I'm talking to them.
- I'll tell you.

296
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:24,069
So you've come here earlier?

297
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,997
Such boys will ruin you.
They neither study in your class...

298
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,541
Nor are they your age.

299
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,670
They look like criminals.
They'll trap you.

300
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,048
What can they do?

301
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:49,719
They're not my friends.
Mere acquaintance.

302
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,433
The pressure will ruin the engine.

303
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:59,104
Stay under 30!

304
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,485
They're back early.

305
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:13,827
Shall I take the scooter?
- No. Take the cycle.

306
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:20,083
Get back fast.
- I'll be late on the cycle

307
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,628
It doesn't go that fast.

308
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:32,512
Why did you put so many bells.
Everyone is watching us.

309
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:36,725
It's young. To look good.
- Stop here.

310
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:44,190
How much?
- Rs. 5

311
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:02,208
I'll see you guys later.
- Where are you going?

312
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:37,118
"The eyes speak the
words of the heart"

313
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:44,125
"The eyes speak the
words of the heart"

314
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:54,135
"In a flash, it gives
away what's in the heart"

315
00:34:56,513 --> 00:35:02,102
"The eyes speak the
words of the heart"

316
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:47,605
"Silence has a
meaningful effect on romance"

317
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:54,863
"If you fall in love..."

318
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:59,576
"The heart never realises"

319
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:06,958
"The bonding of the
hearts can never be hidden"

320
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:14,674
"The eyes speak the
language of the heart"

321
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,681
"The eyes speak the
language of the heart"

322
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,658
Good day to you.
- You too.

323
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:25,328
Know Ranvijay Singh?
- Yes.

324
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:29,708
Yes. This is his village but
he studies in the University.

325
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:53,356
Everyone was sleeping
Suddenly shots were heard.

326
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:56,359
As if crackers were being lit
They didn't stay long.

327
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,361
They'd finished the job
in 7 to 8 minutes.

328
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:02,323
Was it a family feud?
- They're from the same caste.

329
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,493
"If it were a feud, it'd
be about a cow or little land."

330
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,329
But this seems like an army attack.

331
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:12,375
Move aside...
- What do you think...?

332
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:21,843
"Very harrowing? Uncle, you
seem to have taken it to heart."

333
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:26,389
Change yourself. If you can't
break relations with me.

334
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:30,769
Else... someday I'll get you killed.

335
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:35,398
Don't make that mistake.
Ruins the party balance.

336
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:39,402
The High Command asked me to work
amongst people at grassroot level.

337
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:43,406
Is killing unarmed
villagers grassroot politics?

338
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:46,910
High Command told me to be alert
and to keep an eye on the enemy.

339
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,412
Attack before they attack.

340
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,832
"I'd warned Ranvijay,
I know your village."

341
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:56,419
But he didn't pay any heed.
Shot Gopal in broad daylight!

342
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,422
"If I don't pay back, the
public will think I don't care."

343
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,759
"This is grassroot level
politics, dear uncle."

344
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:07,389
"You look after the Assembly, enjoy
with reporters. Leave the rest to me."

345
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,767
Let me do the job the
High Command wants me to do.

346
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,770
What High Command
are you talking about?

347
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,398
That's enough.

348
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:22,112
Stop the car a little ahead.
Now step out.

349
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:37,460
Why is he stopping here?

350
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,464
"He wants to relieve himself.
Stay put, don't get excited."

351
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:44,884
"If you wish, you too may go."

352
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,483
Good day uncle.

353
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:05,530
Walk back.

354
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:10,118
He's giving a lift to
some villagers. What...

355
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:14,164
Let's move on.

356
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,500
Stay cool. Don't
try to act like Phantom.

357
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,504
Crib and you'll get a mouthful.

358
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,507
Just do as you're told.

359
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:29,512
Where will you get off?
- Get off? I'm staying with you.

360
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:35,268
We've been together since last
night. We had dinner together.

361
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:45,236
Stopping me!
- Nobody is stopping you.

362
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:50,617
Sit down. Tie him up!

363
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:57,082
I'll see...

364
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,544
Are you saving me from
Gaurishankar's fury?

365
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:06,341
He's a woman!
The whore of the government!

366
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,887
Come in front! Stealthily
goes in the night...

367
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,975
"And killed everyone.
Cows, goats, women and kids!"

368
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:19,562
Calm down. I'm elder to you.

369
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:24,025
"Ranvijay Singh swears,
the people who died..."

370
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:28,571
I'll kill Gaurishankar on
the 13th day of their death!

371
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:32,575
Memorise the date.
Write it down!

372
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:36,663
Tell him to enjoy his last days.

373
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:50,635
Untie me.

374
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,519
Come and shoot me in the chest!

375
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:45,357
"I said, there not here."

376
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:54,699
"Welcome, son. Hello."

377
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:59,329
He's my young friend.
He acts very well.

378
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:04,668
"Really well. Son,
give them a demonstration."

379
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:10,090
A little... don't feel shy.

380
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:41,287
See you.

381
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:54,718
When did you come?
- 10 minutes back.

382
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:58,388
Maybe 15 minutes.

383
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:03,018
You came alone?
- Papa came to drop me.

384
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:08,732
But he's gone.
- Gone...

385
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:12,527
He'll come back to pick me up.

386
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:17,782
Your lace...

387
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:24,789
Listen...

388
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:34,507
You... I... we...
when next?

389
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,805
Next year same time.

390
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:05,163
"Niharika, father is here!"

391
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:09,709
Your father is here.
- We'll build 2 rooms to rent out.

392
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:13,797
Building rooms takes a lot of effort.

393
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:16,800
Maintaining a house is tough.

394
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,803
Hello aunt...
- I didn't know you'd come.

395
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,807
Just a while ago.
- Shall we leave?

396
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:27,185
Next year I'll get the wife.

397
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:32,857
You must. - Before the prayers end.
May we take leave? - Yes.

398
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:39,864
You should've offered them sweets.

399
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:44,285
What the...?

400
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,838
"Dear friend, why is
my heart so anxious?"

401
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,092
"Nothing excites me"

402
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:05,557
"Shedding tears all night long"

403
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:09,310
This is waste of time.
Being ruined in youth.

404
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,188
Keep quiet man.
- We should take his picture.

405
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:15,525
To hang in the hospital.

406
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:23,867
You introduced us.
- Don't involve me.

407
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:26,870
This is your private matter.
Settle it yourselves.

408
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,875
Some issues are very
personal and sensitive.

409
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,878
It's best you don't get involved
- You're involving us!

410
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,882
Making us sit here while the
Economics class is about to end.

411
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:43,887
Why don't you send a letter?
- What letter?

412
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:47,891
Yes but I don't know
anyone close to her.

413
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:52,187
Careful...
- Why don't you help him?

414
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:57,567
He is infamous in my family.
I'm not allowed to meet him.

415
00:46:57,567 --> 00:47:00,862
Something special will happen tomorrow.
- What?

416
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:05,325
Tomorrow is Tuesday.
Everything good will occur.

417
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:10,622
Does the local news delivery
boy wash the papers first?

418
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:15,919
He's somewhere around.

419
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,973
Which house is it?

420
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:34,646
Who are they?
- God knows.

421
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,279
"Yes, it is I.
What do you want?"

422
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:47,325
Nothing. Just talk
to you in private.

423
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:49,953
Why in private.
Speak right here.

424
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:55,792
I haven't come to fight.
- Stay here.

425
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:04,926
"You deliver papers?
- Yes, why do you ask?"

426
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:08,972
I had a little job.
- What?

427
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:18,940
I won't forget this favour.
- No problem.

428
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,444
I'll enjoy doing this.

429
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:26,489
You've given me Hanuman's job
and today is Tuesday.

430
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:56,019
"When sleep eludes the eyes..."

431
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:00,648
"Excitement is augmented"

432
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:08,615
"The touch of a dewdrop
feels like an ember"

433
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:14,954
"why does it feel..."

434
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:20,335
"The earth is the sky"

435
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:25,465
"The eyes speak the
language of the heart"

436
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:32,972
"The eyes speak the
language of the heart"

437
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:43,024
"Without a word the eyes
express its' feelings"

438
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:52,992
"Without a word the eyes
express their feelings"

439
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:33,658
The rascals!
- Mother...!

440
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,082
I'm planning on selling
the land to come here.

441
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,670
What do you think?

442
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:53,470
This late... he got up so
swiftly. Must be his friends.

443
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:59,726
Then you check it.

444
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:04,189
I'll scold them if
they are your friends.

445
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:18,161
I'll kill the rascals!
- You didn't do it then.

446
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:22,165
Hold on. Can you identify them?

447
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:25,168
Of course.

448
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:30,131
We'll thrash them so hard
they won't look in a mirror.

449
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:36,262
I'll be back soon.
Babul's mother isn't well.

450
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:44,979
One day his friends will ruin him.

451
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,242
I'm coming.

452
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:13,258
Anyone in?

453
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,221
Anyone in?

454
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:20,223
Open!

455
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:23,226
Who is it?
- I'm Anirudh.

456
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:27,772
I want to meet Ranvijay.
- There is no Ranvijay here.

457
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:30,734
They are my friends.

458
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,861
Ranvijay knows me.
I met him here the last time.

459
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:36,239
"Oh, the artist?
- Yes."

460
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,242
Why have you brought
this troupe here?

461
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:41,244
No one knows
Boss is staying here.

462
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:42,412
But this...

463
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,248
"This is not an act,
it's dangerous."

464
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:47,250
Why don't you understand?

465
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,797
Come... come!
- Yes.

466
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:58,303
He made a mistake. He doesn't
know this is dangerous.

467
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:03,767
Want to meet Ranvijay?
The whole gang comes along!

468
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:08,271
I'm not going to die at
the hands of my own men.

469
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:12,275
Only a bigger
crook can finish me.

470
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,277
Do the introductions.

471
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:18,782
"Yes. He's Shailu,
and he's Babul."

472
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:22,327
And he's Javed.

473
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:28,208
"Whose mother was teased?
- Babul, tell him."

474
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,294
My mother was teased.

475
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:34,339
How?

476
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:39,803
I am asking because
I want to study the case.

477
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:44,307
The judgment will
be made accordingly.

478
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:49,312
Boss is studying law.
He knows everything.

479
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:51,314
What exactly happened?

480
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:56,277
"They picked my mother from
behind, and then ran away."

481
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,863
You didn't do anything?

482
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:04,244
"I helped mother up. By that
time, they had run away."

483
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:12,252
"Ani, you come tomorrow and
take Ganga and Taufeeq along."

484
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:15,338
His job will be done tomorrow.

485
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:21,261
"All right? All right?
- Yes, Boss."

486
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:29,352
This case file is closed.
All of you leave.

487
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:34,357
"Don't stay out of the house
so late in the night, kids."

488
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:39,904
"Ani, you stay."

489
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:47,370
"Yes, Boss?
- You'll leave."

490
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,373
"Escort them out, Ganga."

491
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:53,376
That...

492
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:56,921
"I'm coming, you'll move."

493
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:03,803
No one must know
that we are staying here.

494
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:06,890
What if we are killed
in a police encounter?

495
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,393
They are my friends.
I trust them.

496
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:15,899
"A boy who could not protect his
mother, you are trusting him?"

497
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:19,402
"All right, forget that."

498
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:22,906
The University
elections are nearing.

499
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:28,328
"All these friends of yours,
put them into gear."

500
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:31,414
Mobilize them.

501
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:34,459
"All right, Boss."

502
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:39,422
"Now leave, or your father
will come here. It's late."

503
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:43,468
- Be here in time in the morning.
- Yes.

504
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:09,911
"Acting smart, eh?
Trying to be tough?"

505
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:15,458
Come here!
Was it him?

506
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:28,638
How should our leader be?
- Like Satish Pandey!

507
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:39,482
What do you think? Will our boy
be able to win the election?

508
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:42,068
"Ye... yes, he'll win."

509
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:46,531
"Yes, why won't he win?"

510
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,492
He's going to
file his nomination.

511
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,995
Let's go and
give him our blessings.

512
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,997
"Greetings, Minister."

513
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:58,543
The girl!
- Shut-up!

514
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:36,498
What were you
saying to the girl?

515
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:41,503
I was asking for support.
Even girls vote.

516
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,507
You don't seem to be interested
in winning the election.

517
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:49,969
It seems the vote of just
one girl is enough for you.

518
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:57,519
Assume you meet Ranvijay in
the street. What will you do?

519
00:57:57,727 --> 00:58:00,063
I'll kill him
if I come across him.

520
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:05,568
And he knows that.
That is why he's in hiding.

521
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,533
Careful.

522
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,536
"Careful, young man!"

523
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:19,040
Go. Say Hail India'.
- Hail India!

524
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,544
Now move!

525
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:23,670
"Yes, Chief?"

526
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:28,591
It's time to take the lamp
around in the hostel. Get going!

527
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:51,156
Here. The next door.

528
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:06,588
Promise that you will
vote only for Badri Pandey.

529
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,593
Promise that you will
vote only for Badri Pandey.

530
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:16,139
We promise to vote
for Badri Pandey.

531
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,782
"Jashan, why are you crying?"

532
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:42,786
Crying wastes feelings.
Understand?

533
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:46,831
Badri here.
Give the phone to uncle.

534
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:50,335
"Shut him up!
- Jashan, stop crying!"

535
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:55,340
Hello... he's gone to Delhi?
When will he return?

536
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,887
Can't you control yourself?

537
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:06,226
Gauri-bhai was
like my elder brother.

538
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:08,770
They killed him.

539
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:14,734
I'll kill that Ranvijay!

540
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:19,447
After the elections.
First get me votes.

541
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:20,615
All right.

542
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:24,786
"And cry as much as you like,
but I will kill Ranvijay."

543
01:02:25,328 --> 01:02:28,873
I'll give him a wonderful death!

544
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,296
He's coming. The rascal
is coming in here proudly.

545
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,841
Stop the others outside.

546
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,845
Planning to kill me?

547
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:44,848
That's what I think.

548
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:49,853
I have come to say that
my revenge is taken.

549
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:54,816
"And Badri,
you are still a kid."

550
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,903
I have come to advise you.

551
01:02:58,903 --> 01:03:02,866
The story is over from my side.

552
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:06,911
The elections will be
conducted honestly now.

553
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:13,918
Victory to Ranvijay!

554
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:30,518
Why have you come here?
The girls will beat you.

555
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:34,939
I won't speak.
- Let's go!

556
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,403
Shall we begin?

557
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:44,866
"Today, I haven't come to
invite you for my show..."

558
01:03:45,408 --> 01:03:48,912
...but to introduce you
to someone.

559
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:52,916
He's Ranvijay Singh.

560
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:57,962
He is contesting the elections
for Presidentship this year.

561
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,893
I have
complete faith in him.

562
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:16,356
I know that whatever
problems we students have...

563
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:19,901
...only he can understand them.

564
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:22,987
Only he.

565
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:35,959
"Do you think I'm a bad guy?
- No, Boss."

566
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:40,463
Some people think
I am a little...

567
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:42,465
"I am, a little, but..."

568
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:47,012
You cannot please everyone.

569
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,473
Why are girls afraid of me?

570
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:55,020
They must be seeing
something bad in me.

571
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:59,983
Will I win the election?
- Of course you will.

572
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:04,904
But why are you talking like
that today? What happened?

573
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,952
That girl left the meeting...

574
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:14,956
It really upset me.

575
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:19,961
"She didn't leave because of you,
but because of me."

576
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,966
We know each other.
- How?

577
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:28,511
"It's not been
very long, but she..."

578
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,972
She's your girlfriend?

579
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:36,978
"Yes, we love each other."

580
01:05:36,978 --> 01:05:42,525
This girl... who left?
- Yes.

581
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:49,991
Do you'll meet?

582
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:58,083
We cannot meet. We just
write letters to each other.

583
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:02,962
You write letters.
Have you slept with her?

584
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,014
I truly love her.

585
01:06:13,014 --> 01:06:15,016
I don't see her
with that intention.

586
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:17,519
That's the point!
It's all in the look.

587
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,022
Or even I am clean-hearted.

588
01:06:21,022 --> 01:06:25,485
"God has given me such eyes,
what do I do?"

589
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:32,033
I'll set your place of meeting.

590
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:36,996
Then you two can
write letters together.

591
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,128
Write many letters.

592
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:03,023
"O friend,
my heart shivers"

593
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:08,069
"I've lost
interest in everything"

594
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:12,532
"My eyes keep waiting"

595
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:21,082
Excuse me. Manoj Jaiswal?
- He's inside.

596
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:26,129
Go... go.

597
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:49,652
How did you find this place?

598
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:53,156
It belongs to my friend's uncle.

599
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:57,702
Ranvijay got you this place?

600
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:00,622
Why Ranvijay?
What has...

601
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:02,707
Only he can get you
this kind of place.

602
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:05,251
What kind of place?
It's a picture hall.

603
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,295
"Movies were screened here
before, now it is closed down."

604
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,631
And what problem do you
have with Ranvijay Singh?

605
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:14,135
Not just problem. You only
mention him in your every letter.

606
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:18,181
"More than me,
you think about him."

607
01:08:21,142 --> 01:08:24,145
"I'd got this place with
great difficulty, but you..."

608
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,774
"Look, I am just
scared that Ranvijay..."

609
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:32,153
You are scared?
Then leave me.

610
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:34,656
I keep bad company.
I am a bad guy.

611
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:38,410
Just leave me.
Then you won't feel scared.

612
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,247
Go find someone
else for yourself.

613
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:16,156
"My life got..."

614
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:23,163
"...a new life"

615
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:32,172
"It only desired a small lamp"

616
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:37,677
"But got the moonlight!"

617
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:44,684
"My life got..."

618
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:21,262
"I had desired a companion"

619
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:27,769
"Just like you, I swear"

620
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:36,778
"Clearing all the dark clouds,
I found my spring!"

621
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:43,785
"I have found my destination"

622
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:50,834
"The music that can
pull my heartstrings"

623
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:56,339
"I found that note!"

624
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:03,805
"My life got..."

625
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:10,812
"...a new life"

626
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:19,320
"The one who I thought of
in my dreams"

627
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:25,326
"I found that love"

628
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:32,834
"My life got..."

629
01:11:56,941 --> 01:12:01,363
"My heart is in turmoil"

630
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:08,328
"Yet you are unaware"

631
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:17,837
"Let's love more than
we desire"

632
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:24,344
"Let's promise
to forget the world"

633
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:31,893
"Let us have a home
we have dreamt of"

634
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:37,399
"We've even found
the ideal place"

635
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:44,406
"Having got you"

636
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:51,413
"I've found all the
happiness in the world"

637
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:57,502
"A star filled night"

638
01:12:57,502 --> 01:13:00,422
"And even the evening..."

639
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:06,386
"I found, was enchanting!"

640
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:37,042
Please forgive me.

641
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,545
You're forgiven.

642
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:58,021
Mohan Anand - 120.

643
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:01,107
Badri Shankar Pandey - 2611.

644
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:06,571
Ranvijay Singh - 3250!

645
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,493
"Minister, your candidate's
defeat was definite."

646
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:13,995
Keep Ranvijay in check.

647
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:16,998
Or he could make trouble
for us in the future.

648
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:19,876
Put me on to the CM.

649
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:22,712
"Tell him it's Badri
on the line, his nephew."

650
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:25,507
Tell him I'm going to die.

651
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:29,969
"If he's busy, make him busy
with me too for two minutes."

652
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,103
You don't understand
the situation.

653
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:43,525
"Look, it's important. I haven't
called to recite him a poetry."

654
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:54,536
"Call him in the morning at 7,
when he takes a massage."

655
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:58,581
What will he gain by a massage?
We've lost the election.

656
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:00,208
That we have.

657
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:05,547
"He couldn't send me Rs 200,000.
Or we'd have won the election."

658
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:08,049
Calm down.

659
01:15:08,049 --> 01:15:11,094
Calm down.

660
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:16,558
"Brother is no more,
that's why."

661
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:21,062
Or he himself used
to call twice everyday.

662
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:25,525
Make a strong one.
I'll relieve myself and come.

663
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:36,119
Ranvijay Singh must be
very happy today. - Yes.

664
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:45,628
We didn't have the support
of the educated guys.

665
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:49,632
"Ranvijay had it,
so he won the election."

666
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:54,095
"Jashan, of what use was
your English education?"

667
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:56,848
You couldn't get us
a single vote.

668
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,767
He's no more educated.

669
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:03,646
"Can't you see, he's
started chewing betel leaves."

670
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:09,194
"Lakhan, sing an English song."

671
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:14,074
There is not the time to sing
songs. We have lost the election.

672
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:17,243
It's a sad situation.

673
01:16:17,243 --> 01:16:21,706
Then sing a sad song.

674
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:34,719
He's singing?

675
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:45,165
"You were singing, or I'd
have killed you too, I swear."

676
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:59,721
Badri has been orphaned.
How will you survive?

677
01:18:04,225 --> 01:18:07,729
Can I join you?
- What?

678
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,731
Can I join you?

679
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,776
What?

680
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:20,784
"Oh yes, you people eat bread.
- Yes, we eat bread."

681
01:18:21,242 --> 01:18:28,208
Stay with Badri. Go with
him when he goes to meet Singh.

682
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:35,256
You will have to act a little.
Can you act?

683
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:38,760
"Can you act? Singing
is okay, but can you act?"

684
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,763
I'll do it.

685
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:44,849
Good.

686
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:49,270
What will you tell Badri?

687
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,358
"So many shots were fired,
but not even one hit you?"

688
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:58,863
What will you tell him?

689
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:11,751
"All right... Relax, it's nothing."

690
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,796
You eat your daily bread
with your right hand.

691
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:17,841
Yes.

692
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:22,387
Who are you?
Who do you want to meet?

693
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:25,807
"I've come to meet the CM,
he's related to me."

694
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:28,309
My name is Badri Shankar.
- Who?

695
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:30,311
I was sorry to hear
about Gaurishankar.

696
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:33,857
I couldn't come
to offer condolence.

697
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:40,864
"Uncle, I have something
serious to discuss."

698
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:52,834
"Since Gauri expired,
you have withdrawn your support."

699
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:54,836
We lost the election.

700
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:59,424
Ranvijay killed four of
our men at point blank range.

701
01:20:00,842 --> 01:20:03,345
I'm speaking to him.
- Let me speak to him.

702
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:06,890
My life is in danger.

703
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,893
The people you killed
in Ranvijay's village...

704
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:13,897
Wait a minute! Who is he?
- He's crazy.

705
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:16,900
He is taking revenge
for that. Believe me.

706
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,445
Don't you
understand the situation?

707
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:24,532
"My life is in danger, sir."

708
01:20:24,532 --> 01:20:27,535
"And I'm warning you sir,
he's dangerous for you too."

709
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:30,038
He won't spare you.
He won't spare anybody.

710
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:31,539
He cannot touch me.

711
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:34,918
He's very...
- He's very what?

712
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:37,545
You couldn't handle
a street side goon.

713
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:39,130
"And today,
he is bullying you."

714
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:43,968
"Your brother,
Gaurishankar was an ass!"

715
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,484
There is no need
to fear Ranvijay Singh.

716
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:01,903
He's a small timer.

717
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:05,907
A small mistake
will be his nemesis.

718
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:09,077
Then why did Ramchander
kill Captain Mohan Verma?

719
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,079
I don't know.
I said what I saw.

720
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:14,958
"Monali, what your eyes see
is not always the whole truth."

721
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:19,963
"Tell me, the place you are
standing on, is it moving? - No."

722
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:22,465
Then what your eyes see
is absolutely wrong.

723
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:27,012
You must be aware that
the earth is always moving.

724
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,602
"Look, if you cannot do it,
just don't. Just quit."

725
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:36,187
What can't I do?

726
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:39,983
You cannot concentrate.
What's the problem?

727
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:41,609
"Shailu, don't be rude with me."

728
01:21:41,609 --> 01:21:44,988
Come on! There are just
15 days left to our show.

729
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:48,158
"You make the mistake,
and we should talk politely?"

730
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,535
Why?
That means we all are fools?

731
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:53,538
"Javed, put sense into him,
he's gone crazy."

732
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:55,540
"Ani, shall I
tell you something?"

733
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,625
"Don't feel offended,
but you have changed."

734
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,544
You just cannot concentrate.

735
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:01,963
Since he's got in with
Ranvijay and that girl...

736
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:04,591
Shailu! Don't you dare
say anything wrong...

737
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:05,967
...or I will do
something terribly wrong!

738
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:12,015
What will you do?
Get me killed by Ranvijay?

739
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:15,977
Where are you going?

740
01:22:15,977 --> 01:22:21,066
Where my presence
doesn't bother anybody.

741
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:26,237
Shailu should not have said
what he did about Niharika.

742
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,156
What nonsense!
- That's your personal matter.

743
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:30,533
"Even Ranvijay is my
personal matter, Javed."

744
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:33,536
"He is my friend,
like my elder brother."

745
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:38,041
He even helped you all.
Remember?

746
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:42,045
"The fact is that he's not bad,
you all are two-faced."

747
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:45,048
You all are cowards.
You are scared like kids.

748
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:50,095
And I cannot live in
the company of kids. No.

749
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:45,108
One coffee!

750
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:48,111
Make one paan' for me.

751
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:53,575
Your stars are ideal for
marriage right now.

752
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:57,120
Distribute sweets.

753
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,582
"That's okay,
but where is the girl?"

754
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,584
A village belle won't do.

755
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,086
It is better if
she is a little modern.

756
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:08,089
She should at least be
able to receive phone calls.

757
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:11,092
We are receiving calls
from important people nowadays.

758
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:14,095
Someone else will have
to find a girl for him.

759
01:24:14,095 --> 01:24:15,722
Boss is a little weak
where girls are concerned.

760
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:20,101
How?
How am I weak?

761
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:22,729
"Because you are not
interested in girls, that's why."

762
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:25,106
Who said so?

763
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:28,109
I mean...
- What?

764
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:31,321
I cannot find a girl for
myself so I am weak?

765
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:34,282
"That means, I am ugly.
I am not handsome."

766
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:35,784
Isn't that what you want to say?

767
01:24:35,784 --> 01:24:39,162
"No, I...
- Priest, leave the room."

768
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:41,790
That's not what I meant.
What I was only saying...

769
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,169
You were saying girls take an
interest only in guys like you.

770
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:50,173
They won't be interested
in guys like Ranvijay Singh.

771
01:24:50,173 --> 01:24:53,176
Isn't that what you want to say?

772
01:24:53,176 --> 01:24:58,723
"Boss, I was just joking.
You took it seriously."

773
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:28,169
"Come with me to my village,
it will be fun."

774
01:25:28,169 --> 01:25:30,797
I want to meet
Niharika tomorrow.

775
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,799
She'll be able to get out of
the house with great difficulty.

776
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:37,262
This babe bit of yours...

777
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,849
Don't waste so much time
in preliminary.

778
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:44,269
You won't gain anything.

779
01:25:49,357 --> 01:25:52,861
The answer is either A or C.

780
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:54,863
No! It's B.

781
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:57,365
"It's D, idiot!"

782
01:25:57,365 --> 01:26:02,328
Amitabh has worn
that suit many times.

783
01:26:02,328 --> 01:26:05,832
You are back? And what is
all this you have picked up?

784
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,835
"I haven't picked it up,
I've purchased it."

785
01:26:08,835 --> 01:26:13,798
"I got a raise, and father, I
even got my salary on time."

786
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:15,425
"Father, this is for you."

787
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:18,887
"The elections are nearing,
that's why."

788
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:23,892
Everything will happen
on time now.

789
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:27,395
You are back early today.

790
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:32,901
See! I cannot even talk to
my son for two minutes.

791
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:37,405
Where do you talk to him?
You only ask questions.

792
01:26:37,405 --> 01:26:41,910
Where had you gone? Why?
You are back early today?

793
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:46,373
He is a big boy now. It is not
right to scold him like that.

794
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:52,962
Am I a big boy yet or not?
When will you stop scolding me?

795
01:27:11,898 --> 01:27:16,027
"Whenever I come to you,
why do you avoid me?"

796
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:19,948
Sit down.

797
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:25,453
How are your studies going?

798
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:29,958
And your acting?
- I quit that.

799
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,960
Why?
- It's all a waste of time.

800
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,965
I wanted to see you on stage.

801
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:40,468
"Fought with your friends?
- No, it's nothing like that."

802
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:45,974
They are your childhood friends.
They are all nice.

803
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:50,437
"Look son, friendship is the
only relationship..."

804
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:52,981
...which one makes himself.

805
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:57,485
All the other relationships
are ready-made for us.

806
01:27:57,485 --> 01:28:01,865
And you are now big enough
to recognise your true friends.

807
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,453
Yes.

808
01:28:08,955 --> 01:28:15,003
I'd bought this for you.

809
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:21,426
Like it?
- Yes... it's very nice.

810
01:28:22,969 --> 01:28:27,515
I have begun to
understand your taste now.

811
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:52,582
"Yes, speaking.
Who's calling?"

812
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:59,047
"And if you do that again,
I'll have your bones broken!"

813
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,966
What happened?
Who were you shouting at?

814
01:29:01,966 --> 01:29:05,220
Some bloody scoundrel.
He was talking nonsense.

815
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:08,014
But what was he saying?

816
01:29:08,014 --> 01:29:11,017
He was saying that
I should mind my girl.

817
01:29:11,017 --> 01:29:13,019
That she's involved
with some guy.

818
01:29:13,019 --> 01:29:16,231
Must have been some prankster.
Why are you getting upset?

819
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:21,027
You look more upset than me.
Do you trust your daughter?

820
01:29:21,027 --> 01:29:24,572
Now go and cook dinner.

821
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:42,090
Who is Anirudh?

822
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:49,597
"I don't know which Anirudh
he was talking about, papa."

823
01:29:49,597 --> 01:29:53,101
I know two of them.

824
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,604
"One is in my class, and..."

825
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:59,107
"You have met my uncle,
haven't you?"

826
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:02,610
Yes.
- Dhirendra Singh?

827
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:06,114
He had a sister.

828
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:11,077
She got involved with
a guy from the lower caste.

829
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,584
"Uncle shot that guy,
and also his sister."

830
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:25,216
"Neither did the police come,
now was any case filed."

831
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:29,137
"That was in the village,
and this is the city."

832
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:33,641
"But even here, we haven't
forgotten our values."

833
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:39,105
"Even today, such acts will
not be tolerated in our family."

834
01:30:55,705 --> 01:30:59,250
What do you think?

835
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:05,131
I realise why people who
have daughters are so scared.

836
01:31:15,183 --> 01:31:18,186
Where are you? I've been
waiting for you since an hour.

837
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:21,189
I've been able to get
out with great difficulty.

838
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:25,652
"Last night, someone
called up at home..."

839
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:29,197
...and told papa about us.

840
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:34,202
Then?
- I didn't say anything.

841
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:39,708
I'm sure it was Shailu.
He has some problem with me.

842
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:43,211
"Shibu, call uncle."

843
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:46,715
Don't let him go.

844
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:47,841
"Brother, please!"

845
01:31:47,841 --> 01:31:49,426
Don't use your hands!
Speak to me.

846
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:52,262
"-Brother, you don't interfere...
- Don't talk to him, talk to me."

847
01:31:52,262 --> 01:31:55,765
Don't argue with me!
You are a kid before me.

848
01:31:55,765 --> 01:31:58,810
You shut-up!

849
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:07,235
Enough!

850
01:32:07,235 --> 01:32:10,780
"Uncle, what you think..."

851
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:31,760
That one!
- There!

852
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,305
I couldn't even pull.

853
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:43,772
Pull!

854
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:49,319
Why hero!
You look a disaster.

855
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:57,869
What happened?

856
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:02,290
I was involved in a tiff.

857
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:06,711
Where?
- In that picture hall.

858
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:14,803
I was meeting Niharika there.
She came...

859
01:33:14,803 --> 01:33:19,307
"She came, and her father
came there after some time."

860
01:33:19,307 --> 01:33:23,353
He'd brought along two men.

861
01:33:28,316 --> 01:33:32,362
You were hit?

862
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:37,325
Even I hit them some.

863
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:40,328
"Her father was present,
or I'd have..."

864
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:45,291
Damn! Sit here.

865
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:49,963
"Look, a girl loves a man."

866
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:54,342
"And if the man is not brave,
he is not a man."

867
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:56,845
Those guys hit you in
the girl's presence...

868
01:33:56,845 --> 01:33:58,847
...and if you don't
do anything about it...

869
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:01,891
...the girl will think that
the boy does love her...

870
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:06,354
...but he cannot protect her.
You understand?

871
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:11,359
Do one thing.
Don't touch the girl's father.

872
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,363
But take revenge
from those two men.

873
01:34:15,363 --> 01:34:19,492
Let Niharika realise
that her Ani is a man...

874
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:22,370
...not some nincompoop.

875
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:26,374
What will you do?
- What else?

876
01:34:26,374 --> 01:34:29,919
I'll beat the rascals.

877
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:36,384
Keep this.

878
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:41,389
Just scare them with it.
Make them run.

879
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:45,852
"And listen, artist,
don't kill them."

880
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:53,860
But beat them so much that your
girl knows you have courage.

881
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,991
Am I right?

882
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:04,371
Stop the car!

883
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:08,416
You!
- Come out!

884
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:20,929
Let me go!

885
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:25,433
You were enjoying it?
You were enjoying it very much?

886
01:35:25,433 --> 01:35:27,018
"I was alone that
day, that's why?"

887
01:35:27,018 --> 01:35:30,438
We won't spare you even now!
Nor that bitch!

888
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:33,441
What did you say!
Who did you call a bitch?

889
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:37,987
Who will you beat up?

890
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:43,493
"Ani, run!
Just run!"

891
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:52,460
He comes so late in the night.

892
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:58,508
And then bangs the door like as
if it's our fault it's so late.

893
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:06,016
Where is Ani?
- Why? He's not home.

894
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:09,019
What's the matter?
- Go inside and check.

895
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:12,480
The police won't go inside.

896
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:17,444
"Look, don't stretch matters."

897
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:19,487
Just tell me
what the problem is.

898
01:36:19,487 --> 01:36:24,993
Your son is a fugitive. He's
charged with attempt to murder.

899
01:36:35,503 --> 01:36:38,631
"Boss, that man did not die,
the bullet hit his shoulder."

900
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:41,509
The police has taken his
father to the police station.

901
01:36:41,509 --> 01:36:44,512
- I'm going to the police station.
- Making a mistake again?

902
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:48,516
You'll be sentenced for life.
You'll come out an old man.

903
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:53,521
Leave the city.
- But where will I go?

904
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:57,067
"Munna, leave us alone."

905
01:36:58,526 --> 01:37:02,072
Do you know anyone in Bombay?

906
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:07,035
The police will reach there too.

907
01:37:07,994 --> 01:37:12,457
I have an idea.
But leave tonight itself.

908
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:15,085
But...
- Jaggu is my man.

909
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:17,504
Stay with him for some time.

910
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:20,507
I'll try to cover up
matters here until then.

911
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:22,509
Come back after that.

912
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:25,553
And your life will
be back to normal again.

913
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:29,557
I'd told you not to shoot.

914
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:35,480
How did you feel after shooting?
...You must have felt flushed.

915
01:37:38,066 --> 01:37:41,611
Going to Bombay
for the first time?

916
01:37:49,077 --> 01:37:52,622
Take care.

917
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:05,051
Ranvijay had said...

918
01:38:05,051 --> 01:38:08,054
Look straight.

919
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:27,115
Does it work?
- Yes.

920
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:36,624
Don't talk to anyone.

921
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:39,127
"If you feel hungry,
there are biscuits."

922
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:42,130
"Don't leave this
place, understand?"

923
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:44,132
I want to make a call.

924
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:47,135
I'll tell Ranvijay that
you have reached here safely.

925
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:51,681
I want to call someone else.
- You won't call anyone!

926
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:58,605
"You are a fugitive,
not a tourist, understand!"

927
01:39:07,113 --> 01:39:10,617
I'll be back.

928
01:39:47,195 --> 01:39:51,199
"My darling, my love!"

929
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:55,745
Don't you want to make a call?
Aren't you missing home?

930
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:59,749
Come.

931
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:05,672
This is my personal taxi.
A moving drawing room.

932
01:40:06,715 --> 01:40:11,720
The curtains are for
the couples who board it.

933
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:17,726
There is no prohibition
on loving in this city.

934
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:20,729
The people here
are very advanced.

935
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:26,192
You were so serious during day.
But now you seem to be in a mood.

936
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:28,737
This city is such.

937
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:33,241
The people here don't wait
for day break but nightfall.

938
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:36,327
Honestly.

939
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:42,834
Stop.

940
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:15,283
It was Boss.

941
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:17,786
Why didn't you
give me the line?

942
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:20,413
He said let Ani
speak to Niharika first.

943
01:41:20,413 --> 01:41:23,291
But no one should
know you are in Bombay.

944
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:26,294
Who is Niharika?
Your babe?

945
01:41:26,294 --> 01:41:29,339
Stay in your limits!

946
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:08,837
"Niharika, it's me."

947
01:42:08,837 --> 01:42:12,841
Where are you calling from?

948
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:16,845
I'm fine wherever I am.
How are you?

949
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:19,848
How do you expect me to be?

950
01:42:19,848 --> 01:42:21,850
"Why did you shoot, Ani?"

951
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:25,854
I made a mistake.
I was helpless.

952
01:42:25,854 --> 01:42:27,856
It's just a matter of a few
days. Everything will be all right.

953
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:31,359
And you ran away?
Why did you run away?

954
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:35,405
I didn't run away.

955
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:39,951
Let me speak!

956
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:47,334
"I am very far away,
and not in a very good state."

957
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:50,378
I made a mistake.
What else could I do?

958
01:42:50,378 --> 01:42:55,467
Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.

959
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:05,894
I'm only saying that
everything will be all right.

960
01:43:05,894 --> 01:43:08,897
Ranvijay will set
everything right.

961
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:11,024
"And listen, tell someone..."

962
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:15,862
Tell Suggi to
tell my family I'm fine.

963
01:43:16,905 --> 01:43:19,949
And Niharika...

964
01:43:34,422 --> 01:43:37,425
It was him.

965
01:43:37,425 --> 01:43:40,428
Your daughter
knows where Ani is now.

966
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:43,932
Start sending her to
college from tomorrow.

967
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:46,935
We will ask her Ani's
whereabouts over there.

968
01:43:46,935 --> 01:43:51,439
Even the boy's relatives
must be worried about him.

969
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:54,442
The whole city knows about it.

970
01:43:54,442 --> 01:43:57,946
It's become difficult for us
to step out of the house.

971
01:43:57,946 --> 01:44:01,908
"Not just the family, your girl
has earned a bad reputation."

972
01:44:01,908 --> 01:44:05,912
It will be difficult to
get an alliance for her.

973
01:44:05,912 --> 01:44:08,957
And you know how
the Thakurs (clan) are.

974
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:12,961
Even Lord Ram had
banished his wife Sita.

975
01:44:12,961 --> 01:44:17,465
There is still time.
- What do I do?

976
01:44:17,465 --> 01:44:20,468
Should I kill myself?
There is nothing more I can do.

977
01:44:20,468 --> 01:44:23,471
You are thinking negative again.

978
01:44:23,471 --> 01:44:26,558
I'm there for you.
I am a devotee of Lord Shiva.

979
01:44:26,558 --> 01:44:29,477
I'll have to
drink all the poison.

980
01:44:29,477 --> 01:44:31,980
Just don't tell
your daughter anything.

981
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,482
Now your case is in my hands.

982
01:44:34,482 --> 01:44:36,568
The judgement
will be in our favour.

983
01:44:36,568 --> 01:44:41,489
Please get me out of this.
I'll forever be grateful to you.

984
01:44:43,992 --> 01:44:47,037
Stop

985
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:55,295
Look... it's a routine.
What's the date today?

986
01:44:55,754 --> 01:45:00,884
15th January.
- Memorise it. You've seen heaven

987
01:45:20,737 --> 01:45:24,199
Is he dead?
- Nope. Still breathing

988
01:45:24,199 --> 01:45:30,246
"Brother only asked to fix him for
a few days, he's an innocent guy"

989
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,128
Take the hint.
Let's go guys

990
01:45:42,217 --> 01:45:46,304
Excuse me... one minute

991
01:45:47,555 --> 01:45:51,351
Let's go to the shade

992
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:54,896
Please

993
01:45:57,107 --> 01:46:00,944
Like some cardamom?

994
01:46:01,027 --> 01:46:03,822
Did you speak to Ani?

995
01:46:03,822 --> 01:46:07,992
I was there when you were talking
to Ani. I held back your father...

996
01:46:08,368 --> 01:46:13,081
because I wanted you to
talk and satisfy yourself

997
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:19,004
"I hear you've not been eating.
It's not fair, you might fall sick"

998
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:25,427
May I leave?
- Wait... what's the hurry?

999
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:31,224
"Don't be so timid when you walk,
you will find only the road..."

1000
01:46:31,224 --> 01:46:35,145
and timid people on the way

1001
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:42,902
This is the first time
I see you from so close

1002
01:46:42,902 --> 01:46:47,157
You badly need bodyguards

1003
01:46:47,532 --> 01:46:51,578
I got to attend class.
- Listen...

1004
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:55,832
"Look, Ani is..."

1005
01:46:55,832 --> 01:47:02,130
"his life is screwed up, anyway.
We will take care of him, but..."

1006
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:07,135
it's the thought of you that...

1007
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:14,059
"Look, I have people to take care
of me. I don't want your help"

1008
01:47:48,176 --> 01:47:52,806
"Fall in line, kids.
No one breaks the line"

1009
01:48:05,151 --> 01:48:07,487
What's the date today?
- 15th January

1010
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:11,157
Memorize it. You've seen heaven

1011
01:48:11,157 --> 01:48:14,786
It's 26th January

1012
01:48:16,204 --> 01:48:18,164
Got up?

1013
01:48:18,164 --> 01:48:21,209
Great

1014
01:48:23,211 --> 01:48:28,675
When did I come here?
- Someone hit you on the head

1015
01:48:29,050 --> 01:48:33,221
He held a knife at me
and made off with the money...

1016
01:48:33,221 --> 01:48:37,225
that I got after selling your watch

1017
01:48:38,935 --> 01:48:42,230
When?
- Day before yesterday

1018
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:46,276
And I brought you here

1019
01:48:53,408 --> 01:48:56,161
Do something

1020
01:48:56,161 --> 01:48:59,581
I'm hungry

1021
01:49:00,165 --> 01:49:03,543
I'll do something

1022
01:49:03,918 --> 01:49:07,380
"Liar! Someone else hit me, eh?"

1023
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:11,217
"Somebody hit me, eh? Bloody pimp!
You call yourself a man, eh?"

1024
01:49:11,217 --> 01:49:15,805
Where's my watch?
Out with it!

1025
01:49:20,602 --> 01:49:23,229
"Brawling all the time!
Monali, answer the phone"

1026
01:49:23,229 --> 01:49:27,692
Why me?
Why don't you tell the others?

1027
01:49:27,942 --> 01:49:30,236
I'm Monali.
- I'm Ani here

1028
01:49:30,236 --> 01:49:34,449
Ani! Where are you? On the 29th...
- Who is it? Hang up... do it!

1029
01:49:34,449 --> 01:49:38,244
On the 29th...?

1030
01:49:38,244 --> 01:49:42,290
What's on the 29th?

1031
01:49:42,999 --> 01:49:44,626
Give me.
- No...

1032
01:49:44,626 --> 01:49:47,629
Leave it

1033
01:49:53,301 --> 01:49:56,012
Blank calls again

1034
01:49:56,012 --> 01:50:00,517
There are no blank callers anymore

1035
01:50:01,184 --> 01:50:06,356
"If you are harried, I'll take
the phone with me if you want"

1036
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:14,155
What does it come to?
- 115

1037
01:50:18,243 --> 01:50:22,038
Real hot-tempered she is

1038
01:50:22,038 --> 01:50:27,335
"A Thakur descent, after all.
Anger speaks well of the Thakurs"

1039
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:32,340
Want to invite anyone else?
- Yes. Mr Singh

1040
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:35,760
Will he come?

1041
01:50:45,353 --> 01:50:48,106
Excuse me... where is the station?

1042
01:50:48,106 --> 01:50:51,192
Where do you want to go?
- Home

1043
01:50:51,192 --> 01:50:56,364
"Return to me..."

1044
01:50:57,407 --> 01:51:02,037
"my beloved"

1045
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:05,081
"Who else but..."

1046
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:10,337
"you know my pain"

1047
01:51:14,299 --> 01:51:20,096
"Return to me now"

1048
01:51:36,738 --> 01:51:43,078
"Why have you become so cruel?
Tell me"

1049
01:51:45,121 --> 01:51:49,542
"Without you..."

1050
01:51:50,251 --> 01:51:54,547
"even the showers don't amuse"

1051
01:51:56,466 --> 01:52:01,513
"Return to me now"

1052
01:52:20,865 --> 01:52:24,994
"Don't deceive me..."

1053
01:52:25,453 --> 01:52:29,874
"my love"

1054
01:52:29,874 --> 01:52:35,255
"Love for me..."

1055
01:52:35,255 --> 01:52:39,426
"is worshiping you"

1056
01:52:40,468 --> 01:52:45,640
"Love for me..."

1057
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:51,563
"is worshiping you"

1058
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,816
"Return to me now"

1059
01:52:54,816 --> 01:53:00,363
"Return to me"

1060
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:39,361
Where have you been?

1061
01:53:39,361 --> 01:53:43,823
"How come you look sick?
- What's on the 29th, Shailu? Tell me"

1062
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:50,538
Niharika is marrying... Ranvijay

1063
01:53:50,538 --> 01:53:53,583
But you won't do anything

1064
01:53:53,583 --> 01:53:58,296
I got to... Ranvijay Singh...
- Go home... go to the police station

1065
01:53:58,672 --> 01:54:03,259
"No. I want to talk to him.
- There's a whole life ahead, Ani"

1066
01:54:03,635 --> 01:54:08,348
I want Niharika...

1067
01:54:08,348 --> 01:54:12,519
"With Niharika...
- Ranvijay will kill you, moron!"

1068
01:54:13,561 --> 01:54:17,399
I don't care!

1069
01:54:17,565 --> 01:54:22,320
What will I do with this life
if Niharika is...?

1070
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:26,866
"I'm sure she must be in tears,
she must be waiting for me"

1071
01:54:28,326 --> 01:54:32,372
At least I must tell her
I'm alive

1072
01:54:33,581 --> 01:54:39,295
Come my brother... let's go
before it is too late

1073
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:44,509
The house is being decorated.
Looks like they have many relatives

1074
01:54:44,509 --> 01:54:48,513
Mr Singh is marrying
with great pomp and show

1075
01:54:48,513 --> 01:54:52,350
Different types of lights

1076
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:56,604
And there comes the chef. He was the
one who cooked for my sister's wedding

1077
01:54:56,604 --> 01:55:00,316
"Ani, look ahead. Interesting.
- Who is it?"

1078
01:55:00,316 --> 01:55:04,612
Eunuchs.
- Would you do something?

1079
01:55:05,447 --> 01:55:11,369
I had the place cleaned up just now.
Why don't you go and play inside?

1080
01:55:11,578 --> 01:55:15,623
"Welcome, doctor.
Please go in"

1081
01:55:15,623 --> 01:55:18,293
Don't touch me

1082
01:55:18,293 --> 01:55:22,422
Take them inside someone!

1083
01:55:26,426 --> 01:55:29,471
Come on

1084
01:55:31,806 --> 01:55:37,854
"How are you, buddy?
- I'm fine. How are you?"

1085
01:55:50,575 --> 01:55:54,329
"Ani, get over Niharika.
- Look, I agree..."

1086
01:55:54,329 --> 01:55:58,541
I never listened to you guys everytime
you tried to give me right advice

1087
01:55:58,541 --> 01:56:02,337
"But now that I want to heed,
what are you telling me?"

1088
01:56:02,337 --> 01:56:04,631
"If you guys are scared, get lost.
- Not that we are scared..."

1089
01:56:04,631 --> 01:56:07,634
Then what it is?
- What you are doing is wrong

1090
01:56:07,634 --> 01:56:11,638
I'm doing the right thing.
I'm not kidnapping Niharika

1091
01:56:11,638 --> 01:56:15,684
"I'm going to save her from
Ranvijay Singh, which I have to"

1092
01:56:15,684 --> 01:56:19,646
"I love Niharika. For her sake,
if I don't do this one thing..."

1093
01:56:19,646 --> 01:56:22,482
"people will talk..."Look, there
he is! He had a girlfriend"

1094
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:26,695
"Someone else took her away,
and this coward stood watching"

1095
01:56:26,695 --> 01:56:30,699
I'll fall in my own esteem

1096
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:35,120
I'll fall in everyone's esteem

1097
01:56:36,955 --> 01:56:41,751
Take these dresses and get lost

1098
01:56:53,722 --> 01:56:56,057
"For you.
- Bless you, child"

1099
01:56:56,057 --> 01:57:00,103
May every wish of yours
be fulfilled

1100
01:57:02,397 --> 01:57:05,358
"All that she writes is,
she'll go to the parlour at 5"

1101
01:57:05,358 --> 01:57:09,029
She doesn't write if she's
coming alone or with someone in tow

1102
01:57:09,029 --> 01:57:12,699
What we'll do is make Suggi
wait outside the parlour

1103
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:15,035
He'll give Niharika the message
if she sees him

1104
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:18,538
"What more would Shailu need
apart from a vehicle, Javed?"

1105
01:57:18,538 --> 01:57:22,876
"Nothing. Once Niharika comes there,
I'll take care of the rest"

1106
01:57:22,876 --> 01:57:27,547
"Nothing to worry, okay?
- Javed..."

1107
01:57:27,547 --> 01:57:31,676
even if she comes...
will she agree to elope with me?

1108
01:57:33,553 --> 01:57:36,431
I don't know how deep the love runs
between the two of you

1109
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:40,810
"But once she sees your state,
she will certainly agree"

1110
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:46,316
"Babul, let's go.
There's lots to do"

1111
01:57:51,571 --> 01:57:56,576
"Ani, take some rest"

1112
01:57:56,576 --> 01:58:02,290
No knowing when the run
that begins tomorrow will end

1113
01:58:33,655 --> 01:58:39,494
Go inside. I'll go and get
myself a shave. I'll see you here

1114
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:50,630
Got an imported foam?
- Yes sir

1115
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:54,342
There's a wedding

1116
01:59:39,721 --> 01:59:44,726
Where's Niharika?
- Hi Ranvijay-bhai. In the parlour

1117
01:59:51,983 --> 01:59:55,278
Look...

1118
01:59:55,779 --> 02:00:00,867
"whatever is happening,
is all a result of my doings"

1119
02:00:04,829 --> 02:00:10,210
"But, all those promises I made to you
...I shall keep each one of them"

1120
02:00:12,629 --> 02:00:17,092
"And, where we make a home, a river
shall certainly flow near it"

1121
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:25,350
Put it on

1122
02:00:26,935 --> 02:00:28,937
Sit

1123
02:00:28,937 --> 02:00:32,941
Be there on time.
- We'll meet there

1124
02:00:32,941 --> 02:00:36,027
Move

1125
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:45,286
"The girl had a bad name. But for the
sake of our clan, I agreed to marry"

1126
02:00:45,704 --> 02:00:50,792
But I'm betrayed. The girl vanished.
- Ranvijay Singh...

1127
02:00:50,792 --> 02:00:56,047
"Sisters, I need to talk him
in private, just for a minute"

1128
02:00:58,049 --> 02:01:01,678
"What are you talking, Ranvijay?
- What kind of a family is this?"

1129
02:01:01,678 --> 02:01:03,972
How could you treat
your son-in-law to-be like this?

1130
02:01:03,972 --> 02:01:07,976
I was supposed to marry her tonight.
My entourage is all set to arrive

1131
02:01:07,976 --> 02:01:11,896
I'm wearing a new dress. What do
I tell them? That the girl eloped?

1132
02:01:11,896 --> 02:01:16,693
"Ranvijay, the matter is not out of...
- I suspect this lady"

1133
02:01:16,901 --> 02:01:19,863
"Well, I'll find the spoilt girl"

1134
02:01:19,863 --> 02:01:23,658
But I can't be respectful to her.
I've done that enough

1135
02:01:23,658 --> 02:01:25,994
I'm going to play with her!
- You...

1136
02:01:25,994 --> 02:01:30,415
"No to be so excited.
Else, I'll marry you"

1137
02:01:30,832 --> 02:01:34,002
"And none can stop me, I bet.
- What are you raving?"

1138
02:01:34,002 --> 02:01:38,131
Don't get worked up.
Save the enthusiasm

1139
02:01:38,506 --> 02:01:42,802
"Use it to find the girl.
As it is, I'm coming to marry her"

1140
02:01:43,219 --> 02:01:47,474
"On time, that is. And I'm going to
take a bride away. It could be anyone"

1141
02:01:48,016 --> 02:01:51,102
Let's go

1142
02:02:28,056 --> 02:02:31,810
I fear the police. We'll be charged
with forcing the girl to marry

1143
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:35,063
It's a hassle.
- If it sets off a riot...

1144
02:02:35,063 --> 02:02:38,900
it would be even worse

1145
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:43,029
In Allah's court
one comes seeking relief

1146
02:02:46,908 --> 02:02:51,079
"Give these children courage, my Lord"

1147
02:02:51,079 --> 02:02:55,083
Put them to test if You want

1148
02:02:55,083 --> 02:03:00,422
"But if they are true,
show them a miracle"

1149
02:03:05,802 --> 02:03:10,140
"Only You"

1150
02:03:10,932 --> 02:03:15,145
"Only You"

1151
02:04:17,082 --> 02:04:22,337
"Only You"

1152
02:04:22,337 --> 02:04:26,716
"In the lovely rosary beads,
in the flight of birds..."

1153
02:04:27,175 --> 02:04:31,596
"in dust and cliff..."

1154
02:04:31,971 --> 02:04:37,477
"in every language,
in every soul..."

1155
02:04:40,188 --> 02:04:43,692
"in every soul..."

1156
02:04:43,692 --> 02:04:49,072
"there's only You"

1157
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:53,410
"Only You"

1158
02:05:36,953 --> 02:05:41,666
"I see beautiful blossoms
in a string of desires..."

1159
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:46,921
"ever since
I've come to Your court"

1160
02:05:48,173 --> 02:05:50,759
"Yes, I see"

1161
02:05:50,759 --> 02:05:55,388
"Yes I see, my Lord"

1162
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:01,603
"We don't see You,
but we feel You"

1163
02:06:01,978 --> 02:06:06,775
"To see You
is my desire"

1164
02:06:07,233 --> 02:06:11,738
"Yes, I desire"

1165
02:06:18,036 --> 02:06:22,290
"Allah..."

1166
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:27,420
"O great Wizard"

1167
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:32,425
"Though You are so far away..."

1168
02:06:42,686 --> 02:06:48,108
"You are so near"

1169
02:06:48,108 --> 02:06:53,571
"Only You"

1170
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:36,656
"A prayer that comes from the heart,
is not left unanswered"

1171
02:07:37,073 --> 02:07:41,703
"It is Thy promise
that it is never unanswered"

1172
02:07:42,203 --> 02:07:44,372
"Thy miracle...
- is the stars"

1173
02:07:44,372 --> 02:07:47,167
"Thy miracle...
- Is the Spring"

1174
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:49,377
"Lord...
- The creation..."

1175
02:07:49,377 --> 02:07:52,130
"is Thy miracle"

1176
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:56,801
"In every soul
You love..."

1177
02:07:57,177 --> 02:08:01,890
"why won't the soul
find his desires fulfilled?"

1178
02:08:02,349 --> 02:08:07,270
"Why won't his desires be fulfilled?"

1179
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:16,404
"My Lord..."

1180
02:08:17,405 --> 02:08:22,494
"mercy"

1181
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:27,499
"My heart..."

1182
02:08:38,051 --> 02:08:42,514
"seeks only You"

1183
02:08:42,514 --> 02:08:47,185
"Only You"

1184
02:09:37,444 --> 02:09:40,280
Don't you find it interesting?

1185
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:45,118
"That's what men do all day, moreover
they keep chuckling. He's watching you"

1186
02:09:46,244 --> 02:09:50,665
Niharika looks happy.
- Until yesterday she was tense

1187
02:09:50,665 --> 02:09:54,294
At least she's happy now

1188
02:09:54,294 --> 02:09:58,506
I don't find this place safe.
We must get out of here

1189
02:09:58,506 --> 02:10:02,218
What's wrong here? Niharika is happy
and everything is fine here

1190
02:10:02,218 --> 02:10:05,972
What else do you need? Do you
want us to make a Taj Mahal here?

1191
02:10:05,972 --> 02:10:09,559
Who's that?

1192
02:10:22,697 --> 02:10:27,660
I appreciate your sentiments.
What you did was good enough

1193
02:10:29,371 --> 02:10:34,042
"However, let them be in my care now"

1194
02:10:34,668 --> 02:10:38,588
Their safety is my responsibility now.
Both belong to the Hindu religion

1195
02:10:38,588 --> 02:10:42,550
"If Ranvijay gets a wind, he might
give this matter a communal shade..."

1196
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:46,221
and kick off a riot. You know
what state the country is in

1197
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:49,599
"All they need is an issue,
be it a stone, or be it love"

1198
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,728
You're smart enough to understand.
Don't blame us if a riot takes place

1199
02:10:53,728 --> 02:10:58,358
"Badri! You will protect us, eh?
You could lose your life anytime"

1200
02:10:59,526 --> 02:11:03,905
You guys take pleasure
in living off others

1201
02:11:03,905 --> 02:11:07,575
"This guy is Ranvijay Singh's man, and
he was talking to him over the phone"

1202
02:11:07,575 --> 02:11:10,578
Bastard! I'll put a bullet
through you right here!

1203
02:11:10,578 --> 02:11:13,915
"That will end all problems.
Trying to play politics with us, eh?"

1204
02:11:13,915 --> 02:11:16,376
"Get lost!
- Kisan, you've no idea..."

1205
02:11:16,376 --> 02:11:20,755
where you are right now. You don't
gauge the delicacy of the situation

1206
02:11:33,601 --> 02:11:38,690
Stay back. Think again

1207
02:11:40,567 --> 02:11:46,364
I'll leave now.
What you have done for us...

1208
02:11:46,406 --> 02:11:51,161
shows clearly the lie
that's spread in the world

1209
02:11:53,788 --> 02:11:59,794
"Here, you need some tobacco.
- Tobacco?"

1210
02:12:05,383 --> 02:12:08,470
Looks so innocent

1211
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:12,307
He tried to create a rift between us.
- I'll go and take a pee

1212
02:12:12,307 --> 02:12:16,936
Go on. Badri and I have
been friends since childhood

1213
02:12:17,312 --> 02:12:21,733
"Gauri and played marbles together,
fired the first bullet together too..."

1214
02:12:33,995 --> 02:12:39,668
Inexperienced journalists!
What do they think of themselves?

1215
02:12:39,668 --> 02:12:43,922
"Greetings, uncle.
I'm about to do a good deed"

1216
02:12:43,922 --> 02:12:46,383
Thought you'd want to
get the blessings too

1217
02:12:46,383 --> 02:12:51,346
You know Ranvijay? He was forcing
a girl to marry him

1218
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:56,059
The girl loves someone else.
The couple is with us now

1219
02:12:56,476 --> 02:13:01,356
Give us instructions.
It concerns love

1220
02:13:01,356 --> 02:13:05,735
"Helps our revenge, helps your
government's cause. Profitable indeed"

1221
02:13:06,152 --> 02:13:08,697
"I'm coming over tomorrow, to take
a bath in the Ganges the day after"

1222
02:13:08,697 --> 02:13:12,075
See you there

1223
02:13:14,786 --> 02:13:18,915
Contact the superintendent of police.
It's urgent

1224
02:13:27,549 --> 02:13:30,635
Greetings

1225
02:13:39,686 --> 02:13:44,858
Invites have been distributed. Guests
will be coming from Mumbai and Delhi

1226
02:13:48,737 --> 02:13:51,781
It's messed up

1227
02:13:51,781 --> 02:13:55,744
I can't imagine what went wrong

1228
02:13:55,744 --> 02:14:00,165
Is Ani is in town?

1229
02:14:00,707 --> 02:14:05,462
I don't know.
We last met a month back

1230
02:14:08,757 --> 02:14:13,470
"I mean, all that's happening...
I heard it from others"

1231
02:14:14,929 --> 02:14:20,185
"Messenger, I know how deeply
you are involved in this love story"

1232
02:14:29,778 --> 02:14:33,823
Suggi! What are you doing?

1233
02:14:34,115 --> 02:14:39,079
You pissed! Out of weakness?
Or did it betray you?

1234
02:14:40,955 --> 02:14:45,627
"Are you going to kill me?
- If I want, I can kill you all"

1235
02:14:45,627 --> 02:14:48,838
But you guys are not worth
wasting bullets on

1236
02:14:48,838 --> 02:14:52,926
You guys are little kids.
Just a scream will kill you

1237
02:14:52,926 --> 02:14:55,720
Shall I...?
- No

1238
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:59,974
Then why don't you tell me?
Where's the couple?

1239
02:14:59,974 --> 02:15:04,145
"I don't know, really.
- Shoot the bastard"

1240
02:15:04,145 --> 02:15:06,773
"No, don't shoot me.
- Shoot him"

1241
02:15:06,773 --> 02:15:09,651
Let me go!
- Shoot him

1242
02:15:09,651 --> 02:15:15,115
The police got a warrant to arrest
Vijay. Want me to tear up the warrant?

1243
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:29,838
Why did you come here?
- Someone is taking his revenge on me

1244
02:15:29,838 --> 02:15:32,841
And he sent me to arrest you.
- Who sent you?

1245
02:15:32,841 --> 02:15:37,679
I'm helpless...
- What do you want? Get out of here!

1246
02:15:38,847 --> 02:15:44,477
"Ranvijay, would I stoop so low?
Never"

1247
02:15:44,853 --> 02:15:49,149
Who sent you?
- Minister Kabbanlal Tiwari

1248
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:56,322
"Under what sections?
- 363, 366, 368, 503 and 504"

1249
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:02,412
"You are charged for trying to
marry a girl per force, Ranvijay-bhai"

1250
02:16:02,829 --> 02:16:08,293
But where is the girl?
- With the minister

1251
02:16:08,585 --> 02:16:14,174
One more hassle.
- I got direct orders from him

1252
02:16:14,549 --> 02:16:20,805
"Else, you tell me, would
I ever do something so lowly?"

1253
02:16:21,348 --> 02:16:25,810
"Let's go, sonny.
- I..."

1254
02:16:26,895 --> 02:16:29,439
Give him some tea

1255
02:16:36,696 --> 02:16:43,870
How should we treat you?
- I have to obey the orders

1256
02:16:44,913 --> 02:16:48,083
I can't help it

1257
02:16:48,083 --> 02:16:50,627
"Where are we, Ranvijay-bhai?
This is wrong"

1258
02:16:56,424 --> 02:16:59,678
"Ranvijay-bhai, God has
been kind to me"

1259
02:16:59,678 --> 02:17:02,013
Please don't mess things up for me.
I have little kids...

1260
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:06,559
You will soon be promoted.
I'm going to topple the government

1261
02:17:06,559 --> 02:17:07,894
Who do you want?
- Chief Minister

1262
02:17:07,894 --> 02:17:11,648
Not possible now. Come tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1263
02:17:11,648 --> 02:17:15,777
"Now that I'm here, I'll meet him.
Sir, glory be to India"

1264
02:17:15,777 --> 02:17:18,655
Chief Minister doesn't
want to meet you

1265
02:17:18,655 --> 02:17:21,074
Go and check

1266
02:17:21,074 --> 02:17:25,286
The Minister doesn't want to meet you.
- Why? Am I a gangster?

1267
02:17:25,912 --> 02:17:29,082
"I know a party is going on,
I'm not a cheapskate either"

1268
02:17:29,082 --> 02:17:33,169
"A whistle from me, and my men
would surround this place"

1269
02:17:33,878 --> 02:17:36,965
Ask him why he stops me

1270
02:17:36,965 --> 02:17:40,343
Let him in

1271
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:48,852
What are you doing here?
You ought to be in jail

1272
02:17:48,852 --> 02:17:53,606
Return my bride to me

1273
02:17:54,858 --> 02:18:00,447
"Look Ranvijay, I hear
you are studying law"

1274
02:18:00,697 --> 02:18:06,202
"Good. Start practicing law, because
politics is behind your reach now"

1275
02:18:07,662 --> 02:18:11,666
"As for the bride to-be,
get over her"

1276
02:18:11,666 --> 02:18:17,339
I won't tolerate any kind of force
as long as I am in power

1277
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:20,967
I got a song taped.
Please hear it

1278
02:18:20,967 --> 02:18:25,930
"Not a bomb, it's only a song.
Let the minister hear it. Check it"

1279
02:18:28,975 --> 02:18:32,979
"Hear it, please"

1280
02:18:32,979 --> 02:18:37,025
Put this on too

1281
02:18:39,069 --> 02:18:42,197
Your brother
Gaurishankar was an ass!

1282
02:18:42,197 --> 02:18:45,033
He couldn't kill Ranvijay.
In a fit of frenzy...

1283
02:18:45,033 --> 02:18:47,702
he killed people
from Ranvijay's village

1284
02:18:47,702 --> 02:18:52,665
Ranvijay could've killed him long back
had I not hid him for a week at home

1285
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:57,504
No need to be scared of Ranvijay.
He's a nobody

1286
02:18:58,046 --> 02:19:02,217
A small mistake will kill him

1287
02:19:09,224 --> 02:19:13,895
He came to me for protection.
You were forcing her to marry

1288
02:19:13,895 --> 02:19:17,732
"I'm going to marry,
I'm not going to kill..."

1289
02:19:17,732 --> 02:19:22,278
"like your men did,
and you knew that"

1290
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:29,619
What can you do anyway?

1291
02:19:29,703 --> 02:19:33,998
It's like this. I feel like
toppling your government

1292
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:40,755
It's a little difficult.
Not your cup of tea though

1293
02:19:40,755 --> 02:19:44,259
Now hurry up and do what you want.
I have no time

1294
02:19:44,259 --> 02:19:48,596
Why are you so annoyed?

1295
02:19:54,853 --> 02:19:59,107
"Shut up. Your honour is
still intact, bastard"

1296
02:19:59,107 --> 02:20:03,862
"If I don't get my bride before dawn,
I'll play this tape in the fair"

1297
02:20:04,279 --> 02:20:08,491
In front of millions. Then you will
have neither respect nor power

1298
02:20:08,867 --> 02:20:12,120
Then what will you do?
You will have to shift profession

1299
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:15,623
Politics will go beyond your reach

1300
02:20:15,623 --> 02:20:19,169
Tomorrow morning

1301
02:20:19,961 --> 02:20:25,717
Tomorrow evening is our wedding.
You are invited

1302
02:20:37,312 --> 02:20:42,359
"Enjoying the game, eh?
- Sit"

1303
02:20:42,901 --> 02:20:46,696
"Have it, I'm through"

1304
02:20:46,988 --> 02:20:51,493
A handsome chap in love
looks even more handsome

1305
02:20:51,493 --> 02:20:54,996
"I was in love once, for two days.
- Then?"

1306
02:20:54,996 --> 02:20:57,957
I killed her the third day

1307
02:20:57,957 --> 02:21:00,251
Had enough of the circus?

1308
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:05,048
Will you leave us alone for sometime
now? Or d'you want to keep staring?

1309
02:21:05,048 --> 02:21:09,135
You're flaring up over every
little thing. We've been helping you

1310
02:21:09,636 --> 02:21:14,307
"And you've been indifferent. Strange.
- Call for you, Badri"

1311
02:21:14,307 --> 02:21:17,185
Strange

1312
02:21:17,185 --> 02:21:19,979
"Greetings, uncle.
- Where is the couple?"

1313
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:24,359
Safe and fine. They are eating.
Has Ranvijay been arrested?

1314
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:27,362
Ranvijay will meet you
in the fair tomorrow

1315
02:21:27,362 --> 02:21:31,199
Hand the couple over to him.
- You defected finally!

1316
02:21:31,199 --> 02:21:35,829
What all I imagined
for the two of them

1317
02:21:36,204 --> 02:21:39,207
I thought of getting them married
in public

1318
02:21:39,207 --> 02:21:42,961
I wanted their wedding to set
an example. Now who'll write history?

1319
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:48,091
I? And you want...
- Don't be a philanthropist

1320
02:21:48,216 --> 02:21:51,219
I'll get you a ticket to
the next elections

1321
02:21:51,219 --> 02:21:54,514
"What your brother couldn't,
you will achieve"

1322
02:21:54,514 --> 02:21:58,059
Ranvijay wants the girl.
Give him

1323
02:21:58,059 --> 02:22:02,105
And I'll give you what you want

1324
02:22:24,252 --> 02:22:27,297
Move

1325
02:22:28,131 --> 02:22:32,260
"What's the problem?
- Nothing, just a change in programme"

1326
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:38,308
A bath in the Ganges tomorrow
will wash away everyone's sins

1327
02:22:40,018 --> 02:22:43,313
Keep this

1328
02:22:44,272 --> 02:22:48,360
For the safety of your bride

1329
02:23:21,017 --> 02:23:25,146
What are we supposed to do?
- Take the girl

1330
02:23:25,146 --> 02:23:28,191
And kill the rest on the spot

1331
02:23:28,191 --> 02:23:31,236
Get in

1332
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:40,370
Be seated

1333
02:23:48,503 --> 02:23:52,716
Be brave. Everything is fine.
Stay inside

1334
02:23:53,341 --> 02:23:57,178
Don't venture out.
Ranvijay's men are everywhere

1335
02:23:57,178 --> 02:24:02,017
"In the night we travel to Kanpur,
Kanpur to Delhi"

1336
02:24:02,017 --> 02:24:05,311
And then the world is yours.
All right?

1337
02:24:05,311 --> 02:24:09,733
Don't go anywhere. I'll get food
for you. Stay right here. All right?

1338
02:24:25,373 --> 02:24:28,376
What happened?

1339
02:24:28,376 --> 02:24:31,713
Scared?

1340
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:37,218
No. What about you?

1341
02:24:43,224 --> 02:24:47,520
Today I feel more love for you

1342
02:25:47,330 --> 02:25:52,168
"This is where Badri came out from.
Go, check there"

1343
02:26:01,177 --> 02:26:04,931
Let's check elsewhere?

1344
02:26:05,473 --> 02:26:09,477
He came out of this tent

1345
02:26:10,437 --> 02:26:14,607
Where is the couple? Where is Badri?
- Pin him down!

1346
02:26:14,607 --> 02:26:17,652
Talk!

1347
02:26:24,325 --> 02:26:26,619
What happened?
- Ranvijay killed Arun

1348
02:26:26,619 --> 02:26:29,831
Come with me

1349
02:26:30,373 --> 02:26:31,499
Watch it

1350
02:26:31,499 --> 02:26:36,421
"Watch it, eh? I'll kill you
right here! Get him out of my sight"

1351
02:26:56,066 --> 02:26:59,819
We are almost there

1352
02:27:11,539 --> 02:27:16,544
"Sit here.
One cold drink, please hurry"

1353
02:27:24,386 --> 02:27:28,765
Tie your laces this time...
you might fall

1354
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:41,027
Over there!

1355
02:28:21,276 --> 02:28:24,946
Get her here

1356
02:28:41,504 --> 02:28:45,550
Shoot the boy!

1357
02:28:47,427 --> 02:28:48,636
Run Niharika!

1358
02:28:48,636 --> 02:28:52,682
Don't let the girl escape!

1359
02:29:15,205 --> 02:29:19,459
"Move! Munna, move it"

1360
02:29:30,387 --> 02:29:33,973
Over there

1361
02:30:28,445 --> 02:30:31,781
Munna!

1362
02:31:18,828 --> 02:31:20,789
Enough!

1363
02:31:20,789 --> 02:31:24,542
No more running!
- Why Ani?

1364
02:31:24,542 --> 02:31:28,546
We'll tire ourselves running
only to end up dead right here

1365
02:31:28,546 --> 02:31:33,468
And I won't be able to ask
Ranvijay Singh why he did all this

1366
02:32:19,014 --> 02:32:20,515
Enough!

1367
02:32:20,515 --> 02:32:24,477
Don't move! Or I'll shoot!

1368
02:32:26,730 --> 02:32:30,608
"Drop it! I say, drop it.
- Want me to drop it?"

1369
02:32:30,608 --> 02:32:34,696
Drop it!
- Here goes. What will you do?

1370
02:32:48,376 --> 02:32:53,840
"I considered you an elder brother.
- That isn't my fault, is it?"

1371
02:33:01,848 --> 02:33:07,312
You tried to achieve something
that you are not worthy of. You get?

1372
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:15,904
I considered you an elder brother
and gave you respect

1373
02:33:15,904 --> 02:33:19,949
And you took me for a coward?

1374
02:33:26,664 --> 02:33:31,503
Want me to tell you what I am?
- Tell me

1375
02:33:31,586 --> 02:33:34,089
I can give my life for her.
Can you?

1376
02:33:34,089 --> 02:33:37,634
I can give my life for your sake

1377
02:33:37,634 --> 02:33:40,679
"Ani, don't shoot him.
- No, I'll die for you today"

1378
02:33:40,679 --> 02:33:42,430
"Shoot me.
- Ani, don't shoot"

1379
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:46,935
"I swear on God, I won't resist.
Shoot me. Shoot me!"

1380
02:33:46,935 --> 02:33:50,271
Shoot me!

1381
02:33:51,648 --> 02:33:54,693
"Shoot.
Sonny, shoot"

1382
02:33:54,693 --> 02:33:58,947
"Shoot, sonny.
Let's see who loves her more"

1383
02:33:58,947 --> 02:34:02,659
"Ani! They are here!
- Shoot me, kid!"

1384
02:34:02,659 --> 02:34:06,579
"Else, you will regret.
Shoot, kid"

1385
02:34:06,579 --> 02:34:08,623
Shoot! See? He didn't

1386
02:34:08,623 --> 02:34:12,502
"Ani, they are here! Run"

1387
02:35:11,978 --> 02:35:15,148
Come out

1388
02:35:17,025 --> 02:35:19,736
Who are you?

1389
02:35:19,736 --> 02:35:23,782
Where is Niharika?
- What are you doing?

1390
02:35:26,034 --> 02:35:30,246
Stop... stop it!

1391
02:35:45,053 --> 02:35:49,099
Killed Ranvijay Singh?

1392
02:35:49,849 --> 02:35:53,770
"Yes, I killed him"

1393
02:35:53,978 --> 02:35:57,232
Now what?
- What else?

1394
02:35:57,232 --> 02:36:01,903
I'll go to the police station
and surrender

1395
02:36:01,903 --> 02:36:07,367
"I'll get a lifer, I'll be released
after thirty years or so. What else?"

1396
02:36:07,659 --> 02:36:10,787
After that?
- I'll find another Ranvijay Singh

1397
02:36:10,787 --> 02:36:15,250
"And I'll kill him too.
- Very hot-tempered, eh"

1398
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:19,921
It's like this. People like us
will have to rely on our temper alone

1399
02:36:19,921 --> 02:36:24,092
Gangsters and politicians have been
robbing the coffers and the country

1400
02:36:24,092 --> 02:36:26,761
But now they have
ventured into our houses

1401
02:36:26,761 --> 02:36:29,889
Which makes it difficult
to control our temper

1402
02:36:29,889 --> 02:36:33,101
"Look, there are ministers who are...
- You must've been a gangster too"

1403
02:36:33,101 --> 02:36:35,895
"Don't interfere, Niharika.
- One moment, let me talk. Look sir..."

1404
02:36:35,895 --> 02:36:40,275
"I might be wrong, but I've heard and
seen that gangsters make ministers"

1405
02:36:40,275 --> 02:36:44,320
Maybe that's the rule

1406
02:36:47,782 --> 02:36:50,910
She's like that

1407
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:52,871
Then?

1408
02:36:52,871 --> 02:36:56,458
"Now that you've brought us this far,
drop us a little further..."

1409
02:36:56,458 --> 02:37:02,047
"at the police station. By the way,
why have we been brought here?"

1410
02:37:03,089 --> 02:37:06,092
I can't take you any further

1411
02:37:06,092 --> 02:37:09,095
You will have to get off here

1412
02:37:09,095 --> 02:37:11,139
And...

1413
02:37:11,139 --> 02:37:15,143
you did not kill Ranvijay Singh

1414
02:37:15,143 --> 02:37:19,272
My men killed him

1415
02:37:19,856 --> 02:37:23,902
You are free of all charges

1416
02:37:25,987 --> 02:37:28,823
But you... why?

1417
02:37:28,823 --> 02:37:31,910
I was...

1418
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:35,872
not a gangster before.
I was the headmaster of a school

1419
02:37:43,171 --> 02:37:47,175
Take care of each other.
Both of you are hot-tempered

1420
02:37:47,175 --> 02:37:51,221
And do invite me for your wedding

1421
02:37:55,183 --> 02:37:59,187
"And yes, I hear you
are a stage artist"

1422
02:37:59,187 --> 02:38:04,567
Good. Stay in touch.
I like artists
