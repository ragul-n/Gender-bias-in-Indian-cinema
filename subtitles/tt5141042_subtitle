1
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:44,000
Adi...
Where are you?

2
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,167
Hey Adi!
Where did he-

3
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,000
Told him to lay off it today.
I'll need to carry him...

4
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,250
That's from last night.
Let's go.

5
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,750
How are you?
- I'm fine.

6
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,750
I'm coming.

7
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,917
Thank you, thank you.

8
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:19,917
Slow down!

9
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,083
What are you doing?

10
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,333
Siraj!

11
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,750
Dad!

12
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,917
Sorry, I didn't want to say it.

13
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,583
Get some water please...

14
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:01,292
ONLY FOR YOU

15
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,583
The city scape does
not compare to her lips,

16
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:15,583
I don't know her name,
But she's on my mind,

17
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:20,583
And now it's raining
at the oddest hour,

18
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:25,583
God you have left me in a fix,

19
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:31,250
She doesn't kiss, or hug,
She just hits!

20
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:07,208
She looks like a Bul Bul bird,
And she has soared to me,

21
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:13,958
She looks like a Bul Bul bird,
And her cunning has trapped me,

22
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,125
She thinks she's Queen Victoria,
So what am I to do?

23
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:29,042
She has spun me like a top,
She is a strange little bird.

24
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:50,208
He looks like a boar,
And he has walked to me,

25
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:56,792
He is handsome, but
isn't that smart, and now I'm stuck.

26
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:04,125
I have fallen in to a coffin,
I have been burnt to ashes,

27
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:11,458
But he still hasn't left,
It is very strange.

28
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,583
What happened?
Howcome you've rejoined so soon?

29
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:22,667
My friends first ever wedding night!

30
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,458
We've been planning
this since class 5-

31
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,499
Nothing happened.

32
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,542
What? Didn't you try first base?

33
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,792
Where's your sindoor?
- Washed it off while bathing.

34
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,208
Tell me how it was?

35
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,083
How was what?
- Did nothing happen?

36
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:48,292
I have such dreams about
that night... A full moon...

37
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:53,958
Shut up! Yesterday was a new moon.
- Let's see what happens next full moon.

38
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:03,333
Chandu, please promise me
that you'll never get married.

39
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,125
Shut up! That's what they all say.
- Listen up...

40
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,042
People!

41
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,708
Priests and those who
are their wives cattle...

42
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,917
Those who have been
oppressed by their wives...

43
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,542
Tortured, insulted and humiliated,

44
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,500
Even thrown out of
their own houses!

45
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,625
How many of you have
come here to find shelter?

46
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,708
We have!

47
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,750
If you are by my side!

48
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,833
If you are by my side,
I am happy!

49
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,792
And I am forgetting myself!

50
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,000
When you look at me, I bounce,

51
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,917
I am dancing all about the town!

52
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,333
I don't want this day to end,
Or this night aswell,

53
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,250
I want you to wrap
me like an envelope,

54
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,708
I am drowning in your trance...

55
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,792
When you are by my side,
I am happy!

56
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,833
And I forget myself!

57
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,000
Who is the superstar?
Which prince of Ghatal?

58
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,833
Is he a Member of Parliament?
Who can do what he wishes?

59
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,958
Let's see his guts!
And his tail!

60
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,250
If in 5 minutes the lights don't
go off and the sound does not reduce...

61
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,458
One of us is going to be gone!

62
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,667
Sleep!

63
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,458
He isn't ready to
understand me...

64
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm stubborn, I won't let go...

65
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,292
He just doesn't listen...

66
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,250
Hi. Good morning.

67
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,708
Hello!

68
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,875
Hey! Nayan, what's the matter?

69
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:01,000
Why did you call last
night and keep screaming?

70
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:08,667
If you have to spend the night
with an angry drunk...

71
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,375
But, he's your husband.

72
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,000
Thanks for reminding me.

73
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,833
Nayan, you are overreacting.

74
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:24,250
Marriage is about give
and take... Adjusting...

75
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,833
This isn't a marriage.

76
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,083
This is Hell!

77
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,667
Hell!

78
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Nayan, what are you saying?
You've just got married.

79
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,708
How will you live
together your entire life?

80
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,875
Thinking about
getting a divorce?

81
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:52,167
No Reesree, this marriage
is for my father. So I won't end it.

82
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:57,958
He's had a heart attack once
before, if he has another...

83
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,667
Sree, please help me.

84
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,250
Yes, Sree?

85
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,917
Just spoke to boss
about your transfer.

86
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,667
I can't stay here anymore.
Please talk to him.

87
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:20,417
I'll go anywhere. U.S,
U.P., Uganda... I will go!

88
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:26,583
She looks like a Bul Bul bird,
And she has soared to me,

89
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:33,708
She looks like a Bul Bul bird,
And her cunning has trapped me,

90
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:40,625
She thinks she's Queen Victoria,
So what am I to do?

91
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:48,875
She has spun me like a top,
She is a strange little bird.

92
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:09,958
He looks like a boar,
And he has walked to me,

93
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,500
Walking is good for health.

94
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:21,667
If you are in the dark
you shall never fear death.

95
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,250
Watchman!

96
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He isn't ready to
understand me...

97
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,292
He isn't ready to
understand me...

98
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,417
I'm stubborn, I won't let go...

99
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,417
He just doesn't listen...

100
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,625
She thinks she's Queen Victoria,
So what am I to do?

101
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:25,542
She has spun me like a top,
She is a strange little bird.

102
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,917
Mrs. Sen there have been many
complaints about your husband.

103
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:50,417
I have nothing to say.
Talk to her.

104
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:56,042
Where are you going?
See what your husband is doing...

105
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,083
Shut up!

106
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,083
What does he think of himself?

107
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:12,250
My dog shits on the road.

108
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:17,042
Your husband puked on my doorstep.
I am calling the cops!

109
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,667
Enough is enough!

110
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,958
Your husband asked me for
milk in the middle of the night!

111
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,917
He wanted to drink some of mine.

112
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:32,083
He asked me if he could
play cricket on my pitch.

113
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,500
I swear, I'll kill him!

114
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,792
He said I don't look like a virgin.

115
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:48,042
He asked me how I had
my baby! Imagine!

116
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,458
Excuse me? I am talking to you.

117
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,292
Are you a dream?
- No, a nightmare!

118
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:32,083
Aren't you ashamed
of your drunkenness?

119
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,749
It's an acquired taste.

120
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,083
Aren't you
ashamed of staying at a strangers house?

121
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,750
You are being terrible to Nayantara.
You're torturing her.

122
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,542
What do you want?
- What do I want?

123
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't want anything.
Yes! I have food. Want some?

124
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,417
One minute.

125
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,583
Know him?
This is Mr.Acid.

126
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,083
Just eat and then drink
water. Instant acidity.

127
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:16,417
You've come for the first
time, so I'm offering.

128
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,792
I don't want it!

129
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,958
She doesn't want me!

130
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,417
No one is responsible
for my death.

131
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:30,375
What did you do?
You made Mr.Acid commit suicide!

132
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,750
You are mad!
Should be put in an asyllum!

133
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,667
I know what you need.
One minute.

134
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh no!

135
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:49,042
Kick all the doors on the 4th floor.
The one which won't open is your flat.

136
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,667
I am in front of my house!

137
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:55,917
Do you want to get married?
- Yes, do you have a girl?

138
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,167
Yes, a half-cute girl.

139
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:04,083
Caucasian?
- At night, without your specs she is.

140
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,208
Then the morning
shall reveal the light.

141
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:12,167
Give her a lot of cake.
After all she is a Brit.

142
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,750
I had told you not to
come! Why did you?

143
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,542
Bye!

144
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,750
Take this and leave!
Get out!

145
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,042
Out!

146
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
Out!

147
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,208
I have loved and so I shall,

148
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,250
I have loved and so I shall,

149
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,000
As our eyes meet...

150
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,667
Hello? Did I disturb you?
- No, no. Please come in.

151
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,583
Thanks.

152
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Would you like something?
I can't make cold coffee?

153
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,542
Nothing. Thanks.
I came to invite you to my birthday.

154
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:19,125
You're looking good. When is it?
- Next week.

155
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,625
Ok. My advance wishes.

156
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,958
There is a fielder there...

157
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:20,333
Ok. Get in.
- Do I have to go?

158
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,708
You have to. This is an
emergency case.

159
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,708
Tell her to get the injection.
Any family members?

160
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,958
What's her name?
- Her name...

161
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,292
Mrs.Sen.
- Age?

162
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,167
Age...

163
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,000
She is this tall.
- Who are you?

164
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,875
Her husband.

165
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,333
Hopeless! No point
in talking to him.

166
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:10,833
He is dead drunk!

167
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,667
Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

168
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,708
Her name is Nayantara.
Age 26.

169
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:31,000
You are her husband and I
don't know about your relationship,

170
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:37,958
But if you're living together,
you should be aware of her medical history.

171
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:46,583
Merely for the sake of humanity.
I've medicated her, please feed her.

172
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:49,583
Thank you.
- Welcome.

173
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,792
How can he neglect
his wife like that?

174
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:26,625
First eat this, then that,
followed by the tablet and capsule.

175
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,083
I'm not saying it.
The doctor did.

176
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:48,042
I'll take time to eat.
Go home.

177
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,125
You don't need to stay.

178
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:57,875
I'm not going anywhere.
The doctor told me to stay.

179
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:02,375
Can I ask you something,
if you don't mind?

180
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:11,125
Has this happened before? The doctor
wanted to know your medical history.

181
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:22,417
Yes. It had
happened once before.

182
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,708
When?

183
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,000
Siraj...

184
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,000
Look where you're going!
Want to get me jailed or what?

185
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,542
Hey! Won't you apologize?
Uncouth!

186
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,667
I won't!
- Pig!

187
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,958
Nayan, calm down.

188
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,958
Would the public have
spared us if you died?

189
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,917
Blind or what?

190
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:34,833
Has she bought me or the car?

191
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,042
Here we go.
Yes!

192
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:45,500
Siraj Chowdhury. You're
a topper?

193
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:48,708
Yes, sir.
- You're admission is 100% guaranteed.

194
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,500
Fees are Rs.3,40,000

195
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,458
One minute, sir.

196
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,750
Next!

197
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,708
Tell me, son.

198
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:27,583
Dad, I'll get admission for sure.
- God is Gracious. This is his blessing.

199
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:32,917
But... I need some money.

200
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,333
How much?
- Rs.3,40,000

201
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:45,875
I know that everything has
been mortgaged since Sister's wedding.

202
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:51,875
And you had said that you can't afford my
education. But I've worked hard!

203
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:57,833
I've worked as labour,
as a tutor... I want to study.

204
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:05,875
I'll get a good job and earn money.
Please let me study here. Please...

205
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:24,625
Sorry, I overheard
your conversation.

206
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:29,542
My father is the president
of the college. I could help you.

207
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,833
Don't mistake my
tears for weakness.

208
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:41,375
You may have a big car and a president as a
father, but though I'm poor I have something.

209
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:45,708
My marks and my self-respect.

210
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:51,750
If I needed pity I would have
stopped studying long back.

211
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:59,875
So please don't pity me.
Only one being may do that - The Holy One.

212
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,833
A fancy car doesn't
allow you to play God.

213
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,417
Showing me pity...

214
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,125
Hey! Nayan!

215
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,500
What are you doing here?

216
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:25,875
Your admission is fixed.
- Dad!

217
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,375
What?
- Give me a moment.

218
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:46,458
You need to do something. Our entrance
topper doesn't have money for fees.

219
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,875
But we don't provide scholarships.

220
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,583
You can start from today.

221
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,417
Siraj Chowdhury!
Who is Siraj Chowdhury?

222
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,500
Who is Siraj Chowdhury?
- I am.

223
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,708
The principal is calling you
to talk about admission.

224
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,417
Thank you God!

225
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,542
Next class is Economics.

226
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,542
What are you doing?

227
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,000
You?
- You?

228
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:25,250
Oh! Forgot this was
your father's college.

229
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:30,500
I got in on merit! I
don't take pity. And you?

230
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,375
I was the topper. So
I got a scholarship.

231
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,500
We don't have scholarships.

232
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:40,458
I'm a special case. The college
didn't want to lose me.

233
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,750
I am the beacon of the institution.

234
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:49,250
Such pride! If this is what a few marks does,
then you can't be the pride of the college.

235
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:54,958
Atleast I don't think that money
and power makes me God...

236
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,708
Let's go.

237
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,250
Excuse me. You will know the true
dispenser of your destiny soon enough.

238
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:04,083
Then you will eat
your words. Let's go!

239
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,542
Bye!

240
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,083
What news?
Why is your mood off?

241
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,333
Dad, have we started a scholarship?

242
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:21,583
I know why you're asking.
So let me tell you...

243
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,417
I was the board exam topper,
and had gone for admission.

244
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:29,708
I had no money.
So I couldn't get in.

245
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:38,417
Then a girl as pretty as you told
me that she'd arrange the money.

246
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:46,083
I vented my frustration on the girl!

247
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:50,417
She cried all the way home.

248
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:56,208
The day after that I
got a scholarship letter.

249
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,167
Later I found out that
she had arranged it all.

250
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,208
Dad?
- Yes, dear.

251
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,042
You never met her after that?

252
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,792
That girl was your mother.

253
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:23,167
There's a saying which goes
"History repeats itself."

254
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:26,333
"History repeats itself."

255
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:31,250
The same... Hello! Wake up!

256
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,542
Siraj, get up...

257
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:40,083
Sir is calling you.
- Give me some tea with extra sugar.

258
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,500
Hey! Listen!

259
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,542
Give me Siraj's number.

260
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:50,083
8796205301

261
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,958
Can I go?
- Don't you dare tell Siraj.

262
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,208
I forget everything. But call him at night.
He gets lonely at the station.

263
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:04,625
Station?
- He has no money to rent a house.

264
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,083
Let's not talk today,

265
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:32,417
Let's hide our pain in
the flickering flame,

266
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,708
Today tell me,

267
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:41,542
For I cannot close my eyes.

268
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,792
My heart tells me to
reach out to you...

269
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,833
As these heart wrenching
evenings engulf me.

270
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:08,833
All that separates us,
Is our pride.

271
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:18,292
All that separates us,
Is our pride.

272
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,583
Listen up!
Come here.

273
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh my!
Tell me.

274
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:35,583
I have found a place for Siraj.
Take him there.

275
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,792
But if he finds out, he'll
be furious.

276
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:46,333
Do you want him to die on the road?
- No, I want him to live in a house.

277
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:52,042
I want him to settle down...
He has refused to stay at my place!

278
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,625
He has a shop full of pride!
- I'll shoot his pride!

279
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,917
I'll get him!
- Good boy!

280
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,583
Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere nice.

281
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,292
Be careful.
- Is it raining?

282
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,833
This house?
- Ya.

283
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,625
Are you mad?
- Where are you going?

284
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:19,208
Know how much it'll cost!

285
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,917
My baby!

286
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,292
He's looking for a place to stay.
- Of course.

287
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,792
Just like my baby!

288
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:38,375
Please come in...
- Ok, ok...

289
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,375
You can come too.

290
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,667
Please come in.

291
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:51,875
My son Kurtush. Went to study
abroad and stayed there.

292
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,667
Hasn't come back. He never will.

293
00:35:55,708 --> 00:36:00,875
This room and
everything in it is yours.

294
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:06,750
And in this cupboard...
- There's something strange... Let's go!

295
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,083
Shut up!
- Let's see this shirt on you.

296
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:15,125
Perfect! Exactly
Kurthush's size.

297
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:19,917
Everything in the cupboard
is yours. All the clothes.

298
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:25,542
And tell me what you'd
like to eat. I'll cook it.

299
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:32,250
Will you stay?
- Yes, but... the rent?

300
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,792
Can't ask my son for rent.

301
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,792
Please do come.
I'll be waiting.

302
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:48,542
You're very lucky.
God has given you a mother too.

303
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,875
Aunty, you were amazing!
- Be careful. I may fall!

304
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:57,583
Your performance brought
tears to my eyes.

305
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,750
You'll know when you're a mother,
that none of it was an act.

306
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,458
But are you in love with him?

307
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,042
Of course. Because
"History repeats itself."

308
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:15,417
The probability of an event is determined
by studying the sample space...

309
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,625
The 4 Vedas: Rig Veda...

310
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,583
Today we will try to find out
the mean, median and mode...

311
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,792
And Athurva Veda.
Whose phone is that?

312
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,542
Who is it?
A phone call in class!

313
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,667
Mean as we all know...

314
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,458
Get out!
- Sorry ma'am.

315
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:35,542
Get out!

316
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:38,542
Is x1 + x2 + x3...

317
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:45,000
Phone in class? Out!
Been seeing this for 10 years!

318
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,458
Hey! Silence!

319
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,542
Hello?
- I got a call from this number.

320
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,167
You've called me.
- But you called first.

321
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:59,333
But you've called.
- But you called first!

322
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,875
I got kicked out of class
because of your call.

323
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:06,583
Class? Do you study in school?

324
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:12,250
Do all kids have phones nowadays?
- Have you called to kid around?

325
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:19,417
Don't get angry! Do you wear
shorts or trousers to school?

326
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:24,542
Don't joke! I got kicked out
of class because of you!

327
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:29,375
But you only sleep in class.
Give me a cup of tea!

328
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,333
Hey! Who are you?

329
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:38,250
You've called, so who are you?

330
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,750
No! You called first!

331
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:45,083
Tell me your name!
- You first!

332
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,750
You first!
- No, you...

333
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,958
You...
- No, you...

334
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,375
You?
- You?

335
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,708
So, this was your doing?
Giving me missed calls!

336
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:03,458
This is too much!
You called first.

337
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,333
Just tell me that you like me.
No need for missed calls!

338
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,333
Am I that bad looking?
- You...

339
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:17,208
You like someone else?
- I don't like anyone!

340
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,833
Not even me?
- Never thought about it.

341
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:26,500
Think about it. I'll be waiting for
you at the church nearby at 4PM.

342
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:34,292
Think. Coz I want an answer. Or else I
will tell the principal about the call.

343
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,292
Close your eyes and think.
- I will!

344
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,125
Should I open my eyes now?

345
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:57,167
On that side is heart ache,

346
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:01,042
And that's what pushes me to you,

347
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:09,917
So come and visit me in
the corners of this town,

348
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:18,667
Your lonely heart should
search for another,

349
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:27,625
I am sliding into darkness,
Please light the way...

350
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:36,625
All that separates us,
Is our pride...

351
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:45,958
All that separates us,
Is our pride...

352
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,583
A big car doesn't make you God.

353
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,750
You'll find out who God is later...

354
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,708
And then you'll regret it!

355
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:37,458
I told you that Siraj
would find out!

356
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,417
He's going home.

357
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,458
You told him?
- Why should I?

358
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:54,333
I had warned you...

359
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,333
Siraj, are you leaving?

360
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:18,292
You proved that you are the
Dispenser of my Destiny.

361
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:26,333
You've proved that the president's daughter
with her big car is the real God.

362
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,958
Did you do all of
this to demean me?

363
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:35,208
You've won...
So I'm leaving.

364
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:41,167
I didn't do anything!
I want you be the topper in college.

365
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,833
I'm ready to do anything for that.

366
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:51,708
I want you to make it so big
that my assistance is overlooked.

367
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:56,375
And only your success is seen.

368
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:03,583
I love you Siraj.
I love you...

369
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:12,125
All that separates us,
Is our pride.

370
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:21,625
All that separates us,
Is our pride.

371
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:27,000
Do you believe that I never
wanted to demean you?

372
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:33,792
You have taken over the
landscape of my heart.

373
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,583
So you know everything...

374
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,792
What now? Will you marry me?

375
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:49,125
I will. But the situation at home isn't
good. Abbu can't work and I'm studying.

376
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:54,375
I've got to get my sister's
married and get Dad treated.

377
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:59,667
I'm getting a job.
- Won't you study anymore?

378
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,958
An oil company in Kuwait
said that they will pay me well.

379
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,333
They'll train me for 2 months.

380
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,958
And then?

381
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:17,167
What else? I'll have to work there.

382
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:25,167
Please hide me in
the land of clouds...

383
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:34,458
Please fix my broken heart...

384
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:41,583
Tell your Dad about our wedding and-
- Nayan, you're a Hindu and I'm a Muslim.

385
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:46,625
Oh really? Thanks for the info.
- It's not a joke.

386
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:52,292
You don't know my father.
He'll never accept us.

387
00:44:52,625 --> 00:45:00,458
Please hide me in
the land of clouds...

388
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:06,375
If no one agrees to our marriage,

389
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,750
If no one accepts us...

390
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Please fix my broken heart...

391
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:28,125
Your lonely heart should
search for another,

392
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:37,083
I am sliding into darkness,
Please light the way...

393
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:46,208
All that separates us,
Is our pride...

394
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:55,667
All that separates us,
Is our pride...

395
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:06,625
Here you go.

396
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:10,500
Got married yet?
- Dad!

397
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,708
The beer means that you have some news.
- Tell me?

398
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:18,250
You've found a groom. Correct?

399
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:22,542
He's very nice. Our class topper.
He's got a job in Kuwait.

400
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:25,250
Ok!
- And I like him.

401
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,417
Like him or love him?
- Love him.

402
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:32,833
Then it's done! If
you love him then so do I.

403
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,625
Dad, we're very serious!

404
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,208
So am I!

405
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,292
But...
- But what?

406
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,083
His name is Siraj.

407
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,708
I see. Where does he live?
- In Farakka.

408
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,417
Which planet? - Siraj is a human
who lives on this planet.

409
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,583
Then it's settled. You were
talking as if he was from another planet.

410
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,208
Tell me what I have to do.

411
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:02,083
You have to explain to his
father that I am a human too.

412
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:06,542
Done. Since you have already
bribed me, I must deliver.

413
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:10,250
Now, take a sip and don't worry.
- Dad!

414
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:13,500
Take it, otherwise...

415
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,625
How do you drink it! This is
better. Cheers! - Cheers!

416
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:37,208
Since a rich man like you has come to
a poor man like me, it must be important.

417
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:42,042
It's a question of my daughter's life...
- Your daughter?

418
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,625
My daughter Nayantara
and your son Siraj.

419
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:49,917
They study in the same college.
That's how they became friends.

420
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,083
College friends?
- Yes.

421
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,417
I thought people study there?

422
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,500
They both love each other.
They are very serious.

423
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:03,042
They want to get married.

424
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,167
Married?
- Yes.

425
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:12,792
Ok. If you are ready to leave your daughter
to us beggars, why should I have a problem?

426
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,208
So they've decided...
Good.

427
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,792
But I have a condition.
- Tell me.

428
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,917
Your daughter will
have to take up Islam.

429
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,333
Her name will be Jahanara.

430
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:35,125
In this house we read
Namaz 5 times a day.

431
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,583
Will Jahanara manage?

432
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:45,792
Or else she can wait till I die.

433
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,917
It's time for my Namaz.
Salaam.

434
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,917
God speed.

435
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:03,000
What'll happen now?
- What will?

436
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:06,875
I knew he'd never agree.
- Oh God!

437
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:11,667
Why did you do this?
- I'm ready to be Jahanara for you.

438
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:16,625
I love Nayantara. Not Jahanara.
- What's there in a name?

439
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:23,833
I'm ready to read the Namaz 5 times for
you. For me all Gods are the same.

440
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:30,750
The One. - My father is doing
this to avoid the subject.

441
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,917
If you change religion then
he will create an issue out of it.

442
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,250
Nayan. Want to get
a registry done?

443
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:45,417
Did you meet my Dad on the way?
- No.

444
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,833
This is your idea?
- Yes, it came spontaneously!

445
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,167
Are you that brave?

446
00:49:55,458 --> 00:50:00,458
Yes, I know you think I'm a coward...

447
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,208
Not anymore...

448
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,833
Let's go.

449
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:12,542
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

450
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:18,250
Take me with you today...

451
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:23,458
Take me forward,
A step or two...

452
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:30,583
I want to walk along with you...

453
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:39,042
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

454
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:44,708
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

455
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:50,500
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

456
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:56,333
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

457
00:50:57,083 --> 00:51:02,542
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

458
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:07,917
Take me with you today...

459
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:13,792
Take me forward,
A step or two...

460
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:19,292
I want to walk along with you...

461
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:24,708
Why so early? The
registrar will come at 10. It's only 7.

462
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:31,625
There's a slot from 10
to 12 then from 2 to 4.

463
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:36,542
Are you alone?
- No, he'll be here any moment.

464
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:44,667
Don't stand. Sit on
the bench on that side.

465
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:52,750
In my ups and downs,
All I do is look for you...

466
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:59,042
In stormy weather,
If you find the time,

467
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:06,250
I want to tell you how I feel...

468
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:12,542
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

469
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:18,250
Take me with you today...

470
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:24,083
Take me forward,
A step or two...

471
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,917
I want to walk along with you...

472
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:36,333
Oh my! I completely
forgot about you.

473
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,375
Has your husband not arrived?

474
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:47,708
Oh my! This does happen. I've seen it
many a time. Does your family know?

475
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,958
Don't worry. This
is not the end of life.

476
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:02,542
No one keeps their
word any longer.

477
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:09,708
Let your parents decide who
you should marry. You'll be happy.

478
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,667
For today, get home early.

479
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,625
What's the matter, darling?

480
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:51,083
Amit told me that my daughter was
standing in front of the registry office.

481
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:57,958
And I was waiting for my daughter
to come home with her husband.

482
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:01,542
Let's go...

483
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,458
What happened?
- Sorry, Dad.

484
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:17,542
Sorry. For what?
- You gave me the idea and I didn't tell...

485
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,958
What would be
the fun if you told me?

486
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,208
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

487
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:38,500
Let's go on a long drive.

488
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,417
Who do you want?
- Where's Siraj?

489
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:54,375
Who are you?
- Where is Siraj? Siraj!

490
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:59,000
Shouting won't bring
him back here. He left.

491
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:04,958
Don't play tricks with me.
I'm not in the mood.

492
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:09,792
What's the point in tricking you.
I have an early day. Please leave.

493
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:14,500
Siraj!
- Taking advantage of an old man?

494
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:21,917
Enquire at the airport as to whether Siraj
Chowdhury has boarded a plane to Kuwait.

495
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:30,000
If not, you can search. But please let
me sleep now. Can't miss the first Azaan.

496
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:38,542
Siraj has fallen in love with a
Hindu girl so I must pray for him.

497
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:43,458
He is the only hope. As he
has now gone abroad. God speed!

498
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,250
Siraj!

499
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:15,500
Get up...
What happened?

500
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:23,625
Kuwait is on this planet.
I shall go to find your boyfriend.

501
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:31,042
Why are you crying?
Don't cry...

502
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:36,250
Dad, that man is lying.
- Yes, he is.

503
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:40,250
He knows where Siraj is...

504
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:48,250
Siraj would never abandon me...
That man is lying...

505
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,083
Ok, let me see...

506
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:58,875
Dad...

507
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,833
Hello, Chatterjee?
Are you at the airport?

508
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:09,583
I need some help.
Some information.

509
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:16,125
Could you tell me if Siraj Chowdhury
has caught a flight to Kuwait today?

510
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:20,958
It's a little urgent...
Thank you.

511
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,167
What did he say?
- What else?

512
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:32,250
I know he hasn't left.
- Siraj will never leave me...

513
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:38,458
I'm just afraid of one thing.
His father.

514
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:44,667
What do you mean? Is he a child?
Stop crying right now!

515
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,125
Nayan, stop it.

516
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:55,167
When your mother left, I held
back my tears but your tears...

517
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:58,667
Please stop...

518
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:06,208
Hello! Yes, yes.

519
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,917
Dad?

520
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,667
Siraj hasn't gone...
- Thank you.

521
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:18,917
What did he say? Please tell
me that Siraj hasn't left...

522
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:23,542
Siraj has gone to Kuwait.

523
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,333
He has left you.

524
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:31,458
Forget him. Erase him from your life.

525
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:48,625
Dad?

526
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:53,000
What's wrong?

527
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,625
Is anyone there?
Please help!

528
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:12,042
He is out of danger.

529
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:17,458
But you must be careful. A cardiac
attack takes 5 days to stabilise.

530
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:21,167
Please don't stress yourself.

531
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:27,375
Receive the phone outside.
He needs rest. Peace of mind.

532
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,292
Peace of mind and ear.

533
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,667
I'm so sorry.
- It's ok.

534
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:37,917
Hello?
- Nayantara? It's me, Bhaba.

535
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:43,667
Any news on Siraj.
- I got a call form Kuwait.

536
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:47,917
There was an accident
at the petroleum plant.

537
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,375
Siraj is no more.
Hello?

538
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:53,917
Please repeat what you said.

539
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:59,083
There was an accident
at the petroleum plant. Siraj is gone.

540
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,458
Siraj is gone.

541
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,500
Dad?

542
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:51,042
You're totally unkempt.
I don't like it.

543
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:58,042
I don't like seeing you sad either.

544
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:02,542
Have you seen yourself?
Have I said anything?

545
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,750
I'm going to my room.
- Listen!

546
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,458
Speak clearly.

547
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:17,042
The same old thing that all
fathers tell their daughters.

548
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,292
See you.

549
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I need to talk to you.
Sit down.

550
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:30,375
Now, tell me.

551
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,458
I want you to get married.

552
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:37,875
Start a family.
Live happily.

553
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,958
That's all.

554
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:49,083
Ok. I agree.
I'll get married.

555
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:55,458
Now please shave. Please.

556
01:01:56,125 --> 01:02:00,125
My darling doesn't
look nice like this.

557
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:46,625
Is it possible for a girl
to love a boy that much?

558
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:49,875
That's true love.

559
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:59,292
I need to leave.
I have office.

560
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,500
I'll come back soon.
- No!

561
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:09,042
No need. I'll call a friend.

562
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:15,208
So then I'll call.
In case you need something.

563
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,500
Ok? You take care of yourself.

564
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,875
Bye.

565
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:37,167
I... don't have your number.
Could you give it to me?

566
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:46,958
9830087710

567
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:18,167
Hello?
- How are you?

568
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,958
Who is this?
- Adi...

569
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:26,125
What happened?
- Nothing... Have you had your medicine?

570
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:30,958
Yes, I have.
- Ok. Had called to find out. Take care

571
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,917
Let's go.

572
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:51,083
Wow! You look...
Have you got rid of your wife?

573
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:56,375
Don't talk shit. - Where are you
going? This isn't the way to office.

574
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:00,750
Today's a holiday for me and you.
I've told boss.

575
01:05:00,917 --> 01:05:04,917
Are you serious?

576
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,958
Let's get some juice.
- Juice?

577
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,208
Thank you, Chandu.

578
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,875
Hello?
- Have they given you juice?

579
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,875
No.
- Should I get some?

580
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,625
No need. They will give me some.
- Ok. Take care.

581
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,917
Tell me what's happening.

582
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:43,667
It's a jaundice case.
- She has jaundice?

583
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,250
No!
- Then?

584
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,875
Heartbreak.
- Heartbreak?

585
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,583
I hate hospitals -

586
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,875
What's this? I would have
come if you had called.

587
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:07,333
What's the bill?
- Rs.80,650

588
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:08,333
Card or cash?

589
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,500
Cash.
- Card.

590
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,250
Card.

591
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:16,458
Please stop it!
Cash.

592
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,625
You'll just swipe a strangers card?
- No, I mean...

593
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:25,500
Cash!
- I thought he was your husband...

594
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:31,000
You thinking it, doesn't make it real.
- But he signed all...

595
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:34,417
Signing makes one a husband?
- Sorry.

596
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,667
Couldn't I have paid?

597
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,125
Why should you?
You can't!

598
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:50,375
Why did you keep calling.
Why the sudden care?

599
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,292
Trying to be responsible?
Who asked you to call?

600
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,292
You gave me your number.
- So?

601
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:03,208
I was depressed. So I gave it to you.
Why do you have to call?

602
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,625
Don't try to make it mean something.

603
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:11,250
Even my watchman has my number.
Should he pay the bill?

604
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,083
Am I the same as the watchman?
The watchman is better.

605
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:19,167
He understands his job well.
Now listen carefully...

606
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:26,208
From now on if you try to
show me care or pity, I will finish you!

607
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:31,042
Don't forget it!
Sree, pay the bill.

608
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:02,792
Do you remember
when you first cried?

609
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,208
Why are you talking rubbish?

610
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,625
Don't piss me off.

611
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:21,083
Do you remember
when you first cried?

612
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:25,583
Don't irritate me.
Let me drink in peace.

613
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,083
Drink.

614
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,875
Drink up!

615
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,167
Cheers!

616
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:59,917
She has a lot
of pain inside her.

617
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:07,542
No one knows what she's
going through, except me.

618
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,833
Will you take me to her?

619
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,917
I really...
- What?

620
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,833
Tell me.

621
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,750
Say?

622
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:26,125
I really...

623
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,333
Adi... Hey Adi!

624
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:35,917
The first day you cried, I could
do nothing. But today I can.

625
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:38,833
And I will! Get up Adi!

626
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,375
Get up!

627
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:49,042
Do you know about
the first time Adi cried?

628
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,542
Shut up! This is a respectable place.
- I know!

629
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:56,625
I know it is. But do you know
where your husband is?

630
01:09:56,917 --> 01:10:02,708
You don't care coz you don't
know when he first cried.

631
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:06,333
Cut the drama and say it fast.

632
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,542
He cried when he first fell in love.
- What?

633
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,958
2006...

634
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:32,875
Little Monta, did you hit Chandan?

635
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:36,083
He called the girls in
my locality frogs.

636
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,833
Girls and boys will play games.
It keeps them fit in body and mind.

637
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:48,458
Swami Vivekananda said this.
Do you know that?

638
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:52,000
No. If you have it on
your phone, then play it.

639
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:56,250
But we should keep the games
confined to our own localities.

640
01:10:56,375 --> 01:11:00,042
Today both localities will play.
Just try and stop it.

641
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:08,792
Need to 'Bang Cock' Small
Monta's locality today. So start!

642
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,250
Quack! Quack!

643
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:26,667
Shouldn't we play a match?

644
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:30,625
Small Monta, let's play.
- Quack!

645
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,750
Never fight for yourself.
Only fight for friends.

646
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:48,917
And if you get hit,
do it only for yourself.

647
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:52,500
Keep that in mind.

648
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:58,875
Hey!

649
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:38,833
Giri go and find Gauri,

650
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:42,207
She must be a very...

651
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:44,667
Stop singing! Give me
money for groceries.

652
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:49,625
Money? Get a money plant.
Tear the leaves and spend.

653
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:53,000
When you come to eat, I'll
shove salt down your throat!

654
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:56,083
Who's eating your food.
Nothing but boiled beans!

655
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:56,917
That's what you'll get!

656
01:12:57,042 --> 01:13:00,292
Give it tome, Oh Kali...

657
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,625
Please do give.
- Who's that?

658
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:05,708
Oh Kali!

659
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:10,208
Why are you standing like a pillar?
You want money, don't you?

660
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:13,292
Need to donate to the temple
for blessings to pass my exam.

661
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:16,250
Exam! You'll never pass!

662
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,143
Uncle, give me money.
- I'll give you a slap!

663
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,125
Don't get angry.
- Acting smart with me?

664
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,833
Haven't brushed, so a
lot of rubbish is coming out.

665
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:31,292
Here. Wait! You have to
do something important!

666
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:34,750
Tell me.
- You need to pick up a cheque for me.

667
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:39,167
It's a very large amount.
So be careful.

668
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:45,583
It is my capital. Go to
Chapal Babu at 10:30AM and-

669
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:48,208
I'll remember.
- That's your commission.

670
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,958
Oh yes! Do you know where he lives? - Of course
there is only one Chapal in the locality.

671
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,083
Move!

672
01:13:56,667 --> 01:14:00,625
I'm leaving! Need to
meet Ma Lakshmi!

673
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,333
See you...

674
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,833
Good morning, Uncle Kongsho.

675
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:10,792
Oh there he is!
My Nimai of the seas!

676
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,292
Nimai, I've given my useless
nephew an important responsibility.

677
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:19,625
Please go with him.
It'll give me confidence.

678
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:24,292
Oh! This love!

679
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,375
Am I useless.
- No, you're invisible!

680
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:31,375
Thank you.
- Just shut up and help me push this thing.

681
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,083
Let's do some social service.

682
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:35,708
Sit.

683
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,792
It's a lot of money!

684
01:14:46,292 --> 01:14:50,333
First day, first show for Phatakeshto.
- But first Uncle's cheque.

685
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,042
Is Chapal here?
- Who are you?

686
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,000
Kongsho is my uncle.

687
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:08,417
Don't laugh. Who knew that my uncle would
have a nephew when they named him?

688
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,167
Sir!
- What happened?

689
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:17,083
Krishna is here!
- Tell him to play his flute while I bathe.

690
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,875
If it gets late, I'll leave.
It's my Guru's film. Can't miss it.

691
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:23,292
You must be sensitive to other's pain.

692
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:30,500
If he doesn't clear his stomach in the
morning, he'll feel terrible all day.

693
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:36,500
It's horrible! Let's pray
for the success of his dump!

694
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,917
Come!

695
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:52,125
My heart shakes and jiggles,

696
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,667
It beats so fast!

697
01:15:56,333 --> 01:16:01,958
We have started losing our way...

698
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:06,708
Ooh La La! I love you my dear!

699
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,458
Ooh La La! I My dear!

700
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,750
Where's my tea-

701
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,458
Where are you going?
- Tea...

702
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:33,125
To make tea.
- There are people for that.

703
01:16:34,292 --> 01:16:36,542
Did it happen?
- Yes, peace at last!

704
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:40,292
So tell me Keshta. - Am not Keshta,
I'm Chandan, Kongsho's nephew.

705
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,958
The cheque?
- Here you go.

706
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:47,792
Don't eat it up!
- Things people say...

707
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,542
2 Lakhs!

708
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:56,083
Smiling liking a goat!
Let's go the movie's started.

709
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:59,667
The movie started
a long time back.

710
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,833
It's going to be a superhit!

711
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,083
Hey! Mithun Da!

712
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:13,417
Mithun Da is killing it!
What are you doing?

713
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,167
Get him! Kill him!

714
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:20,083
Never let me watch
a movie in peace!

715
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:48,250
I won't sit!
Any longer!

716
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:51,208
Sit down! Or I'll pound you!

717
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,792
What did you say?
Insulting my husband!

718
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:13,667
All of you come and
see what has happened!

719
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,500
What will I do now?

720
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:20,792
What happened?
Is your uncle dead?

721
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,083
He left the house like a prince!

722
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,292
Aunt...

723
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,500
Oh it's you!

724
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,167
What happened?

725
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,917
Go up and see!

726
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:43,792
It's a disaster!

727
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Oh my!
- Uncle! Let me see.

728
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:52,708
You look like Harbhajan Singh-
- Bloody swine!

729
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:54,375
Just one hit?

730
01:18:54,417 --> 01:19:00,542
Of course. My name is Kongsho.
So my nephew is fated to vanquish me.

731
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:03,291
Does anyone sit in the
front row with their second wife?

732
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:06,208
The point is-
- Who was sitting in the front row?

733
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:09,792
Don't be shy. Tell her.

734
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:14,583
Me? I was sitting in
the first row of the bus.

735
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:22,708
Then there was a bump, and the bus
shook and my head hit the roof.

736
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:27,042
You got on to a
bus with your scooter?

737
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:31,958
Shut up! Can't you see I'm in pain?

738
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,958
Shut up! You can't hide from me!

739
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:40,833
Won't even let me cry in peace!
- I'll cut you-

740
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:44,708
Uncle!
- Oh my...

741
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:53,375
Goes straight to my head. - It's difficult
for an old model to hold 2 sim cards.

742
01:19:53,667 --> 01:20:00,667
Don't let her know.
Otherwise she'll kill herself.

743
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,958
What'll I do then?

744
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:08,667
I have only one wife!

745
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:15,833
You're making me cry!
- Bloody swine!

746
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:19,458
If you do not give
me money to spend...

747
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:24,542
How shall I keep my mouth shut?

748
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:29,125
Of course. That I know.

749
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:34,083
Here you go Chandu.
Spend it all.

750
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,833
What are you doing?
Am I a freebie?

751
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,875
This is my age to spend.
And I have to keep my mouth shut too.

752
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,458
Of course. You are like my nephew.

753
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:51,667
Spend it all. My money
is like bird seed!

754
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:53,750
Just given away!

755
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,333
Chandu?
- Yes, uncle?

756
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:59,125
My cheque.
- Checked the cas. It's fine.

757
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:03,792
Bloody swine! I'm talking
about my cheque!

758
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:10,167
You can't expect me to pick up your cheques
when you go out on a date!

759
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,458
Go and get it yourself!

760
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:15,292
Don't you know how to talk to elders?
- Tell me?

761
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:19,500
You should be ashamed!
What an amazing uncle!

762
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:24,167
You called him a dog?
Uncle, don't worry.

763
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,583
I'll pick Chandu up at 7AM.

764
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,792
And I will get the
cheque myself!

765
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,958
Yes, Uncle Kongsho.

766
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:44,250
What's this? I told you I'd be here at 7.
Why aren't you ready?

767
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,917
I mean... - A promise to Kongsho and
Adi's time can never be denied.

768
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:51,042
Let's go!
- I'm not wearing underwear.

769
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,917
We're going on a bike,
not a bus.

770
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,708
Ready?
- Please be careful.

771
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,625
Anybody there?
- I'm off for now-

772
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:09,667
Oh wow! A new janitor!
Have been waiting for a week!

773
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:11,292
Did you get him?

774
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,792
Is he a hard worker?
- Totally!

775
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:16,708
They pay well!

776
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,250
Take off the lungi
and come with me.

777
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:20,667
I told you to let me
wear underwear!

778
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,875
What will happen?
Hold this!

779
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,833
Clean up on that side!

780
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,208
He is Kongsho's nephew.

781
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:32,750
Krishna?

782
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:35,708
He's not a janitor.
- Oh my!

783
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,042
Doesn't look like a
gentleman for sure.

784
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,750
It's coz he's wearing his uncle's lungi. If
he takes it off he'll look like a prince.

785
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:47,167
Hey janitor!

786
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:49,458
Shut up!
- You shut up!

787
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:55,917
Oh my! You finished
brushing so early?

788
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,958
Did you come to see her Colgate smile?
- Idiot!

789
01:22:59,125 --> 01:22:59,958
Thank you.

790
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:02,750
This is your fault! I told you
to be ready by 7! - Sorry.

791
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:04,458
Who are you?

792
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,542
Who are we?

793
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:10,292
Don't you recognize us?
We came to collect the cheque yesterday.

794
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:13,292
And you were dancing. Remember?

795
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:15,167
What's his name?
- Chapal

796
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:17,958
Chapal. We met Chapal.

797
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:21,708
I don't know how to dance and
Chapal Babu will be back next week.

798
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,125
I'm getting late.

799
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,875
Cockroach!

800
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:29,958
Hey! Listen!

801
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,625
Let it be.

802
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:39,625
I'd like your name and phone number.
Just to check up on you, once in a while.

803
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:42,375
Brother,

804
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,958
I have a boyfriend.
Fit and fine.

805
01:23:46,917 --> 01:23:49,667
I know you're trying.
But it's useless.

806
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:54,750
But is that reason enough
to call me brother?

807
01:23:55,125 --> 01:24:00,250
Don't be sad, brother. Siblilings
should never lie to each other.

808
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,542
Excuse me Brother 3.

809
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,542
Please take Brother 2 and leave.

810
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,667
Brother 2, it's time to go!

811
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,833
Anyway, your name and number-
- Leave!

812
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,458
Only the name?
- Please go.

813
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,292
Just the number?
- Get out!

814
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,250
Let's go!
- Shut up!

815
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:35,292
Trust me, it was torture.
And I'm late for office...

816
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,833
Look at that!

817
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:42,833
Wow! How handsome!
Hi!

818
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,208
Why are you waving?
Are you following me?

819
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,583
What's your name?
- What?

820
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:52,583
Name! Your name?

821
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,583
Get lost!

822
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:57,125
He's mad!

823
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,375
Let's go. We're late.

824
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,583
Hello, madam.

825
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:24,708
Why are you here?
- Could I know your name?

826
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:28,708
My-
No need for a name. Where's the cheque?

827
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,375
First, get dressed. This
is an office area.

828
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,958
You'll get the cheque
when Chapal Babu returns.

829
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:38,333
Hey Rohan!

830
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:41,833
She called me naked!

831
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,485
What's up, we're getting late...
- Good morning, so sorry...

832
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,333
She'll look back.

833
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,042
She will!

834
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:55,333
She-

835
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:57,958
What happened?

836
01:25:58,042 --> 01:26:02,167
She didn't turn. - Please take
me home. I'm highly ventilated.

837
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,958
Hello, Bozo!

838
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:18,708
Give your hand.
Handshake?

839
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:22,458
Bozo the vagrant boys
are after me.

840
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:26,000
Will you protect me?
Thank you.

841
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:30,833
And don't let those
boys in to the house.

842
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,208
Can I come?

843
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:48,958
I need to win the dogs heart
in order to win hers.

844
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,292
Want a milk biscuit?

845
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,917
Please get me in to her heart.

846
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,667
Who's there?

847
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:16,042
Bozo!
Bozo!

848
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,417
Bozo...
Tandoori chicken.

849
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:22,708
Want some?

850
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:25,042
Are you vegetarian?

851
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,542
Paneer...

852
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:32,667
No problem. Want a hot dog?

853
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,458
Hot dog!

854
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:39,917
Bozo!

855
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:43,958
Hot dog! Very hot!

856
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,250
You like?

857
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:04,083
Cheque?
- Chapal Babu will return next week. Leave!

858
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,875
Phone number?

859
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,625
What are you doing here?

860
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:18,583
Cheque.
- So that's your excuse for following me...

861
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,167
I'll follow you all your life.

862
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:32,792
What do you want?

863
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:34,167
My cheque!
- What?

864
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:36,792
My cheque!
- It's lost! Leave me alone!

865
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,292
Ok.

866
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:47,542
My cheque?

867
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:50,208
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

868
01:28:52,375 --> 01:29:00,375
You are waiting on the
other side of my song

869
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,833
My cheque?

870
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,500
Were you a street
hawker in your last life?

871
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,125
Grovelling for a
cheque like this?

872
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,167
I won't eat it up!
I'll give it to you! Now go!

873
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,875
Did you get it?
- Should get it by next week.

874
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:35,167
You're on a different agenda.
- No, I can see...

875
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,417
The day is nearing.

876
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:46,333
The day has come, my brother.

877
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,542
Hello? Hello?

878
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,417
Hi!
- Hello?

879
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:54,458
Hi!

880
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:57,042
You're always flirting!

881
01:29:58,083 --> 01:29:59,500
Hi!

882
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:02,958
What do you want?
You've been chasing me like a dog!

883
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,917
Why are you here?
- Came to eat.

884
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:10,083
Don't play games.
Think I don't know you?

885
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:12,458
Brother!
- Broth...

886
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:17,667
Please don't call me that.
It gives me nightmares.

887
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:22,208
Siblings always tell the truth.

888
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,625
And I have a boyfriend, brother.

889
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,958
Are you tricking me?
- Me!

890
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:29,500
Playing tricks?
- Yes!

891
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:32,708
With you? Wait I'll fix it.

892
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,708
See that handsome
man wearing a coat?

893
01:30:43,542 --> 01:30:46,333
Rohan, my boyfriend.

894
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,083
What?

895
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:51,083
Are you joking?
- Me. With you?

896
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:53,500
Yes!
- Don't believe me?

897
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:55,833
One minute.

898
01:30:56,625 --> 01:31:00,042
Rohan! Hi!

899
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,167
What's your name?

900
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,750
Adi...

901
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,083
Rohan!
- Hold for a sec. What?

902
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:11,667
He's Adi, my brother.
- Hi Adi.

903
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,792
He's Rohan, my boyfriend.

904
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:22,042
Wait, wait. You shouted
out the word brother.

905
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:25,625
But why did you whisper
the word boyfriend?

906
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:35,375
Culture. Cultured women don't exclaim
their boyfriend's name in public.

907
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:39,042
You have no chance.
- What if he says no?

908
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:44,500
Koli come fast! We have
a meeting in my cabin.

909
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,750
One minute.

910
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:49,083
How is he?

911
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,958
He's calling me to his cabin.

912
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:54,750
I'll see you later, brother.

913
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,708
Koli!

914
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:08,083
Could you give me your number, Koli?
I've lost it, Koli.

915
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,625
Can I text it to you.
- No, you don't have my new number.

916
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:19,042
Please give me your number.
- Let's not waste time. Lots of work...

917
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,333
Koli, your number please.
- Koli's number?

918
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:27,708
Yes, Rohan.
- It is 9867476664

919
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:31,958
I know it by heart.
- Thank you, Rohan.

920
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:36,000
Bye. Let's go.
- I'll call you at night, Koli.

921
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:38,458
Do receive.

922
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,823
What are you thinking about?
- I want to start a business.

923
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,917
Chandan business?

924
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:48,083
Salt water. When you sweat I'll
collect it and transport it via tram.

925
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:50,792
Yes!
- What happened?

926
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,875
Where were you?
- She gave me her number.

927
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,167
What? Then why the wait?
Time to call!

928
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:01,083
She introduced me
to her boyfriend.

929
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:04,458
Rohan.
- Family album.

930
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:10,833
But you're a part of the family.
You're the sweet brother!

931
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:16,750
Why are you hitting me?
Hit Rohan if you have the guts!

932
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:21,792
Oh my friend! My elephant!...

933
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:26,083
Boyfriend. Rohan.
- Looks like a thermometer.

934
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:29,167
Come.

935
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:49,375
Oh my Elephant...

936
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,750
Adi, he called you an elephant.

937
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,333
Elephant?
- Yes.

938
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:55,666
What should I do?

939
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:58,625
Turn around and hit him!

940
01:33:58,917 --> 01:34:00,125
Hey!

941
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:08,042
What?

942
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,417
Did you call me an elephant?
- Can't hear you. What?

943
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,333
Called me an elephant?
- Ha? (yes)

944
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,042
Oh my!

945
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:17,875
Touch us and you're dead!

946
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,708
Oh my!

947
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,375
Get lost!

948
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,000
Get lost!

949
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:29,917
Bloody traitors!
- You Koli's boy?

950
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:33,708
Calling her to your cabin...
Honeymooning early...

951
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,792
Such a big job and only
20 rupees in hand?

952
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:45,625
Look at that! He's got another girl's
picture. This is his one on the side.

953
01:34:46,167 --> 01:34:47,917
Cheating?

954
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:51,458
Wait! He wants to say something.

955
01:34:56,917 --> 01:35:00,167
That's better! This is
my pregnant wife!

956
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,792
Koli is my wife's best friend.

957
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:08,417
She is my sister. My
much loved sister.

958
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:12,958
My little sister...

959
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,125
Shut up!
- He's scary...

960
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,333
Nice one! Come on!

961
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,292
She's coming.

962
01:35:39,792 --> 01:35:42,958
Uncouth barbarian! Beating
people up in my name?

963
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:45,625
You idiot! He's my boss!

964
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:49,542
I hate you!

965
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:53,167
I lied coz I don't like you!

966
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,792
Before I forget...

967
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:06,375
This is the cheque you wanted?
Here you go!

968
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:18,708
If you look at me again
I'll gouge your eyes out!

969
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:45,458
What are you doing?

970
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:51,083
This is yours!

971
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:59,167
Uncle!

972
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:12,374
Ever wondered why she
carried the cheque around?

973
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:13,083
Why?

974
01:37:13,084 --> 01:37:19,292
If she didn't like you she could
have given you the cheque long back.

975
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:25,333
Use your head for more than
colouring your hair.

976
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:29,208
Use your brains... Listen to the bottle.

977
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:32,375
The bottle...

978
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:41,958
Don't let her go.
Ask her all your questions.

979
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,458
If you don't get answers, create a
ruckus in front of her hosue.

980
01:37:50,167 --> 01:37:56,542
Chandu, the bottle is telling
me to create a ruckus!

981
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:58,083
Go!

982
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,292
Big Fight!
- Big Fight!

983
01:38:14,667 --> 01:38:20,917
Bozo, tell me something...

984
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:27,208
Why are girls born?
To give pain.

985
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,708
Bozo!

986
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:46,500
Will you come with me or
stay with this drunkard?

987
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:51,500
Come! He has some
guts! Bloody monkey!

988
01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:54,583
But you 2 are just about the same!

989
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:56,625
The boy who came in the morning lost
the cheque. Please give this to him,.

990
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,292
And listen, I'll be back
in a week. Keep well.

991
01:40:55,667 --> 01:40:57,583
Lying lifeless on the floor!

992
01:40:58,917 --> 01:41:00,333
Let's go.

993
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:07,708
He drank too much,
so he ended up here.

994
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:11,417
Can I take him?
Let's go...

995
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:18,333
Listen. tell him to
meet me at 5PM.

996
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:22,083
Where?
- He knows.

997
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:25,208
Your dog is very sweet...

998
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:35,417
Your willful breeze is a delight...

999
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:43,583
I am now in pieces,
And am ready to drown...

1000
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:46,958
She seems to be in
brother mode today.

1001
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:50,208
Maybe even in father mode!

1002
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:55,750
I don't want to be an
accomplice. I want freedom!

1003
01:41:57,292 --> 01:41:59,667
I'll be back in a minute.

1004
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:08,750
Hey-
- Sorry sister.

1005
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:14,125
I should have never pursued you, once you
said you had a boyfriend.

1006
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,250
My mistake...

1007
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,750
I am very sad, sister.

1008
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,167
Hey!

1009
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:28,833
Why are you calling me sister?

1010
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:33,083
Why the extra respect?

1011
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:37,208
You've been following me
around like a watchdog.

1012
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,833
You beat up an innocent man coz
you thought he was my boyfriend!

1013
01:42:41,417 --> 01:42:45,208
You smile whenever you see
me and now I'm a sister!

1014
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,875
You're no less!

1015
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:51,417
You kept the cheque in your
bag and spun me like a top.

1016
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:57,375
You conned me in to mistaking a
friend for your boyfriend.

1017
01:42:57,542 --> 01:43:00,708
And I'm your brother...

1018
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:07,917
If I'm your brother,
then you are...

1019
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,083
I'm Koli.

1020
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:23,625
I am your Koli.

1021
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,708
I bought it myself.
- Beer?

1022
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,458
Your favourite.
- Thank you.

1023
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,417
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1024
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,208
Adi, my granny used to say...

1025
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:55,000
That if I lay down on my mother's lap and
looked at the sky, my wishes would come true.

1026
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:58,042
Have you heard this saying?

1027
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,625
No.

1028
01:44:01,667 --> 01:44:03,417
You don't know anything.

1029
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:08,208
Adi, if you marry me,
who do you need to tell?

1030
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:12,958
Dad, Mom and... Chandan.

1031
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:19,375
I have no one to call.

1032
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:22,125
Because I am the
master of my own will.

1033
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:26,167
Why? Your mother, father...

1034
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:31,125
That would happen
if they were there.

1035
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,667
I'm-
- No sympathy please.

1036
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:43,500
They died when I was a child.

1037
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:47,167
I grew up in an orphanage.

1038
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,833
Then I moved to
my uncle's house.

1039
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:52,958
School, college,
scholarship... A job.

1040
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:55,375
That's how my life has been.

1041
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:57,750
I don't think about
these things...

1042
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:03,042
But I felt like saying
them to you today...

1043
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:11,792
When those closest to
you, leave you alone...

1044
01:45:14,292 --> 01:45:17,333
The whole world loses colour.

1045
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:22,750
It feels like life has stopped...

1046
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:32,833
But out of the ashes of life,
a ray of hope appears.

1047
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,125
Then life starts anew.

1048
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:43,500
I have said my peace.

1049
01:45:44,042 --> 01:45:46,250
Have anything to say?

1050
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:58,958
I have never slept
on my mother's lap.

1051
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:02,541
Can I rest on your lap?

1052
01:46:02,542 --> 01:46:07,875
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1053
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:13,458
Take me with you today...

1054
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:19,000
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1055
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,083
Why here?
- Today's your birthday.

1056
01:46:27,292 --> 01:46:30,625
How did you...
- Go and take your blessings.

1057
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:34,000
God's name on the Devil's lips!

1058
01:46:34,292 --> 01:46:37,292
Ok. You come along.
- No, I won't.

1059
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,250
Go yourself.

1060
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:43,083
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1061
01:46:43,208 --> 01:46:48,375
I want to walk along with you...

1062
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,917
I'm asking for the last time.
Will you come?

1063
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:06,667
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1064
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:12,500
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

1065
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:18,250
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1066
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:24,083
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

1067
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:29,750
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1068
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:35,333
Take me with you today...

1069
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:40,875
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1070
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:46,875
I want to walk along with you...

1071
01:47:56,458 --> 01:48:03,792
Brother, today is
our wedding night.

1072
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:09,875
I could have slept with you
before we were married.

1073
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:12,417
Couldn't I?

1074
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:18,333
Today we are married. And with
it comes great responsibility.

1075
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,083
Tonight I shall have
a peaceful sleep.

1076
01:48:23,417 --> 01:48:26,208
My nights were sleepless before.

1077
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:30,375
I used to feel that I
had no one to love.

1078
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:34,208
Is there anyone...
- Me!

1079
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:53,625
Brother, take your wife on
a bike ride tomorrow.

1080
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:58,750
She will take care of you.
But the new bride must sleep tonight.

1081
01:49:01,042 --> 01:49:02,292
Good night.

1082
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:05,083
Koli!

1083
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:09,250
Love you
- Love you too.

1084
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,542
We shall walk the path today,
In front of all who stare.

1085
01:49:23,792 --> 01:49:27,792
And all I feel is you...

1086
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:32,542
If the weather turns grey,

1087
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:36,750
Adi, ice-cream!

1088
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:42,917
What do you want?
- Beer.

1089
01:49:43,042 --> 01:49:46,042
You'll get drunk and ride!
I'll give you one slap!

1090
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:53,542
Namaste. Remember me?
The name's Chandan.

1091
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:56,750
This line is busy.
Please call later.

1092
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:59,958
Are you busy with Koli?

1093
01:50:00,167 --> 01:50:02,708
Will you shut up!
- This must be Chandan! Give the phone!

1094
01:50:02,917 --> 01:50:06,250
Hello! Brother 3!
- What news?

1095
01:50:06,375 --> 01:50:08,958
We're on the highway.
- This early?

1096
01:50:09,042 --> 01:50:11,708
Today's our mini honeymoon.
- Oh no!

1097
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:14,167
Saying it's their honeymoon.
- Shit!

1098
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:17,250
You're married?
Got hitched at the temple yesterday.

1099
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:21,250
Really?
- Adi said I wasn't supposed to tell.

1100
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:23,458
Just forget it...

1101
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:26,708
Adi told you not to tell?

1102
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:29,000
Hello!
- You have to eat whatever I get.

1103
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:34,292
Tell me.
- Are you a human?

1104
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:36,667
How could you do this?

1105
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:39,958
She was joking.
She's mad.

1106
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:43,417
You swear?
- Brother!

1107
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:45,708
Careful!

1108
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:47,833
Money?
- Coming.

1109
01:50:48,167 --> 01:50:51,583
Haven't paid for ice-cream.
- Ok, wait.

1110
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:55,583
Crazy girl!
- The money...

1111
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,583
You can't turn back time.

1112
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:52,000
You come here every
year, at this time.

1113
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:55,292
What's the point?

1114
01:53:57,167 --> 01:53:59,375
Start afresh.

1115
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:03,333
This is your marriage!

1116
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:06,542
Go and fix it!
Tell her everything!

1117
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:12,458
You want to live in your past.
And die in it too.

1118
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,708
Say it!
You can't!

1119
01:54:16,125 --> 01:54:20,375
Why are you making their lives Hell!
What have they done to you?

1120
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:23,083
Selfish!

1121
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,667
Only you and I know that
you guys were married.

1122
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:39,125
There are so many people who can't
marry the person of their choice.

1123
01:54:39,333 --> 01:54:42,500
But do they not survive?

1124
01:54:44,917 --> 01:54:47,917
Try again. Once more.

1125
01:54:51,708 --> 01:54:54,750
Adi, you can do it...

1126
01:54:55,458 --> 01:55:03,458
I can be the rain
or the road for you...

1127
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:13,583
If you'd like, I could paint a river,

1128
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:24,458
I have travelled beyond reason...

1129
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:28,667
Can a boy love a girl that much?

1130
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:33,958
Chandan please don't
tell Adi anything.

1131
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:37,375
Don't tell him I know.
- Don't worry about that.

1132
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:42,625
I'm too sozzled to
remember a thing.

1133
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:45,750
I might even forget you.

1134
01:55:45,875 --> 01:55:50,292
I'll be off now.
But before I go, let me tell you...

1135
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:55,583
When someone who's in love gets drunk,
he may have a heart failure.

1136
01:55:56,292 --> 01:55:59,750
And if a married man drinks,

1137
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:03,042
Then his whole life is a failure.

1138
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:07,542
But today he's alone.
Let me get him.

1139
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:10,625
Sorry!

1140
01:56:19,167 --> 01:56:22,875
Come on... Careful...

1141
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:29,750
Ok?

1142
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:31,833
Good night.

1143
01:56:55,042 --> 01:56:58,125
Sorry Nayantara...

1144
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:03,042
When those closest to
you, leave you alone...

1145
01:57:03,792 --> 01:57:10,333
The whole world loses colour.

1146
01:57:10,417 --> 01:57:17,792
It feels like life has stopped...

1147
01:57:18,042 --> 01:57:26,042
But out of the ashes of life,
a ray of hope appears.

1148
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,750
Then life starts anew.

1149
01:57:39,875 --> 01:57:44,583
It has happened to me.
It'll happen to you too.

1150
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:47,708
I'll be waiting.

1151
01:57:48,208 --> 01:57:51,125
Life is not over, Nayantara.

1152
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:54,833
It will start again.

1153
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:59,042
It feels like life has stopped...

1154
01:58:19,875 --> 01:58:22,625
We've walked a 1000 paths,

1155
01:58:22,917 --> 01:58:25,625
And in the ups and downs,

1156
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:29,625
I hold close to you.

1157
01:58:31,625 --> 01:58:34,333
When the weather is grey,

1158
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:37,458
If I get a little time,

1159
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:42,083
I want to tell you how I feel.

1160
01:58:42,792 --> 01:58:48,125
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1161
01:58:48,583 --> 01:58:53,708
Take me with you today...

1162
01:58:54,083 --> 01:58:59,250
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1163
01:59:00,083 --> 01:59:05,250
I want to walk along with you...

1164
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:10,875
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1165
01:59:11,583 --> 01:59:16,875
I want to walk along with you...

1166
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:22,958
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1167
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:28,958
I want to walk along with you...

1168
01:59:29,292 --> 01:59:34,458
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1169
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:40,458
I want to walk along with you...

1170
01:59:46,667 --> 01:59:48,500
Adi?

1171
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:50,167
Get up.

1172
01:59:56,083 --> 01:59:59,333
You look like an
angel when you sleep.

1173
01:59:59,458 --> 02:00:02,917
And in real life you
look like a ghost.

1174
02:00:03,542 --> 02:00:06,625
Not a ghost but a banshee!
Now get up.

1175
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:12,500
I've made you tea.

1176
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:28,583
Good morning young man.
You're quite a late riser.

1177
02:00:28,708 --> 02:00:30,250
Are you always this late?

1178
02:00:30,458 --> 02:00:33,125
Waking Adi up is a real task.
- Really?

1179
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:38,542
Getting him ready
for office is a war!

1180
02:00:39,042 --> 02:00:42,833
Only I know what it takes
to get him to office on time.

1181
02:00:43,375 --> 02:00:47,083
You've completely transformed
my daughter's life.

1182
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:52,667
Go and get fresh. Dad has been
waiting for quite a while.

1183
02:00:53,083 --> 02:00:55,500
We'll have breakfast together.

1184
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:03,250
Drama queen!

1185
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:06,042
So this is what she's
been planning...

1186
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:11,417
You haven't taken
your towel as usual.

1187
02:01:11,667 --> 02:01:14,375
When will you grow up?
Take this.

1188
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:32,417
Your friends and the tenants
are all here. Please hurry up!

1189
02:01:32,625 --> 02:01:34,167
What?
- Come fast.

1190
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,583
Ch-

1191
02:01:37,875 --> 02:01:39,042
Chandan?

1192
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:44,667
She's done something!

1193
02:01:45,167 --> 02:01:49,167
Adi! Be careful! Ok?

1194
02:01:59,625 --> 02:02:02,917
Happy Birthday!

1195
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:05,625
Thank you.

1196
02:02:06,708 --> 02:02:08,625
Why are you flustered?
Cut the cake!

1197
02:02:08,708 --> 02:02:11,083
Surprsise!
- Thank you!

1198
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:13,125
Cut it...

1199
02:02:14,417 --> 02:02:18,625
Happy Birthday to you...

1200
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,208
What's wrong with you? Looks like
you've been brought to the slaughter.

1201
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:34,792
Cut it...
- I was saying...

1202
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:38,333
Can't there be a birthday without cake?
- Never!

1203
02:02:38,583 --> 02:02:40,667
Can't have a Puja
without sacrifice!

1204
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:43,500
Adi please...

1205
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:52,625
There we go...
Happy Birthday to you...

1206
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:04,792
Adi, you're really something.
- Happy Birthday...

1207
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:15,792
Happy Birthday. This
is your gift. Take it.

1208
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:19,083
Take it...

1209
02:03:19,542 --> 02:03:22,667
Don't open it in front of people.
It's special.

1210
02:03:22,917 --> 02:03:25,333
I've specially selected it for you.

1211
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,583
Only for you.

1212
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:30,583
So you'll see it alone.

1213
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,875
Hey! You forgot me...

1214
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,500
Picture...

1215
02:03:52,708 --> 02:03:53,708
No, no.
- Just come.

1216
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:59,583
Come!
Take it.

1217
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:05,625
Your wife?
Nice one!

1218
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:14,000
Here.
- Who will eat so much?

1219
02:04:14,042 --> 02:04:15,875
You all will.

1220
02:04:17,125 --> 02:04:20,333
Waking up late is a sign
of a happy married life.

1221
02:04:21,167 --> 02:04:26,875
Has Nayan ever got you beer?

1222
02:04:27,625 --> 02:04:29,833
Nayan, drinks beer?

1223
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:34,292
If she drank vodka,
he'd join her.

1224
02:04:34,792 --> 02:04:36,875
No, no, it's not that.

1225
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:43,833
When Nayan wants something from me,
she bribes me with a beer.

1226
02:04:43,917 --> 02:04:46,583
Wanted to know if
she's started it with you.

1227
02:04:46,833 --> 02:04:52,000
She'll need to get
a crate for him.

1228
02:04:52,375 --> 02:04:55,167
What are you saying?

1229
02:04:55,542 --> 02:05:00,833
So she has never got you a beer?

1230
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:02,917
No, uncle.

1231
02:05:04,292 --> 02:05:09,083
He wants to kno
if you have beer here?

1232
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:13,375
You still haven't
opened your gift.

1233
02:05:13,708 --> 02:05:15,792
Open it
- See it.

1234
02:05:18,542 --> 02:05:26,542
Wait! Remember, your wife
told you to open it alone.

1235
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:51,583
Get out!

1236
02:05:58,625 --> 02:06:01,583
1911 can never be repeated.
- That's history!

1237
02:06:14,083 --> 02:06:15,958
Did you see it?

1238
02:06:20,042 --> 02:06:23,792
Yes I did.
- Yes, I saw you.

1239
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:33,125
Chandan...
Excuse me.

1240
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,583
Nayan?

1241
02:06:51,292 --> 02:06:53,375
Are you living well?

1242
02:06:53,875 --> 02:06:57,292
I'm fine. You saw it for yourself.

1243
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:00,458
Do you think I'm not ok?

1244
02:07:07,625 --> 02:07:14,208
Dad!
- I know you act to make me feel at ease.

1245
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:17,375
But Adi. Why does he act?

1246
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:20,917
Dad, you don't understand.
- That's all Nayan.

1247
02:07:21,917 --> 02:07:25,333
No need to explain.
Just be careful.

1248
02:07:26,875 --> 02:07:30,875
I'm going to Germany
for 3 months.

1249
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:33,750
See you when I get back.
- Yes.

1250
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:36,167
Take care.

1251
02:07:42,083 --> 02:07:45,750
Why are you so tense?
- Saw how she acted in front of her Dad?

1252
02:07:46,167 --> 02:07:49,833
Total drama queen!
- Have you ever told her that you love her?

1253
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:53,833
Have you ever told her
the things, you tell me?

1254
02:07:54,292 --> 02:08:01,375
Then how do you expect her to cuddle
you and say she loves you?

1255
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:05,792
Don't you get it?
She wants a divorce!

1256
02:08:06,042 --> 02:08:10,417
Why are you sitting alone?

1257
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,917
Oye!

1258
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:16,750
What's wrong?

1259
02:08:17,292 --> 02:08:20,958
Confusion...

1260
02:08:28,417 --> 02:08:34,708
The things we don't accept,
the things we tolerate...

1261
02:08:35,042 --> 02:08:39,667
Are difficult to disclose.

1262
02:08:40,042 --> 02:08:41,917
How will you disclose?

1263
02:08:42,167 --> 02:08:44,125
Didn't understand a thing.

1264
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:48,125
Have you tried explaining it?
- I did.

1265
02:08:48,458 --> 02:08:52,333
I just heard about it.
He's seen it himself.

1266
02:08:53,667 --> 02:08:57,292
Adi, there's still time.
Tell her.

1267
02:08:57,917 --> 02:09:00,750
I love you.

1268
02:09:01,208 --> 02:09:02,083
Are you mad?

1269
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:08,542
If he can change and start anew,
then why can't I?

1270
02:09:08,708 --> 02:09:09,875
Correct!

1271
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:12,167
Let's get a beer.

1272
02:09:13,208 --> 02:09:20,375
But your Australian transfer is
confirmed. For 2 years.

1273
02:09:21,125 --> 02:09:24,208
The decision is obviously yours.
So think about it.

1274
02:09:24,292 --> 02:09:29,625
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1275
02:09:30,083 --> 02:09:35,208
Take me with you today...

1276
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:40,750
Take me forward,
A step or two...

1277
02:09:41,583 --> 02:09:46,750
I want to walk along with you...

1278
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:53,333
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1279
02:09:55,417 --> 02:10:00,375
What have you done for her?
If you think...

1280
02:10:00,625 --> 02:10:06,000
that taking her to the hospital and calling
her twice is enough then you're mistaken.

1281
02:10:06,167 --> 02:10:09,958
You'd do much more for
any of your neighbours.

1282
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:17,292
What have you done to
prove that you love her?

1283
02:10:17,917 --> 02:10:21,042
Why should she stay with you?

1284
02:10:21,083 --> 02:10:26,542
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1285
02:10:26,833 --> 02:10:32,417
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

1286
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:38,083
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1287
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,958
My wife doesn't like it.

1288
02:10:44,125 --> 02:10:46,583
She doesn't like a drunkard.

1289
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:54,875
I want to walk along with you...

1290
02:10:56,792 --> 02:11:02,333
Wow! Breaking news!
Go hom today and now!

1291
02:11:02,667 --> 02:11:03,958
See you.

1292
02:11:08,292 --> 02:11:12,458
Hey Adi! Chocolates and flowers.

1293
02:11:18,208 --> 02:11:20,208
Cheers!

1294
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:25,874
We've walked a 1000 paths,

1295
02:11:25,875 --> 02:11:26,167
I just heard about it.
He's seen it himself.

1296
02:11:26,168 --> 02:11:28,875
And in the ups and downs,

1297
02:11:29,042 --> 02:11:32,875
I hold close to you.

1298
02:11:34,875 --> 02:11:37,583
When the weather is grey,

1299
02:11:37,833 --> 02:11:40,708
If I get a little time,

1300
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:45,333
I want to tell you how I feel.

1301
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:55,083
What happened?
- There's a letter from Nayantara's office.

1302
02:11:55,458 --> 02:11:58,125
I'll give it to her.
- Who are you?

1303
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:00,625
I'm her husband.
- Ok, sir.

1304
02:12:27,042 --> 02:12:30,250
Hello Adi Uncle!
- Hello!

1305
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:53,583
You didn't drink today?

1306
02:12:53,875 --> 02:12:57,625
I know you don't like it, so...

1307
02:12:59,792 --> 02:13:02,417
Want a beer? One beer?

1308
02:13:14,042 --> 02:13:16,042
Thank you.

1309
02:13:18,667 --> 02:13:24,250
The beer is basically a bribe.

1310
02:13:30,333 --> 02:13:32,917
She wants a divorce!

1311
02:13:43,083 --> 02:13:47,083
Adi... I don't know where to start?

1312
02:13:48,208 --> 02:13:50,875
I was saying-
- That you want a divorce.

1313
02:13:53,167 --> 02:13:55,167
Isn't it so?

1314
02:13:55,708 --> 02:13:58,250
You don't like me.

1315
02:14:00,042 --> 02:14:02,667
You want to be freed.

1316
02:14:05,167 --> 02:14:10,625
I approve. You are free
for the rest of your life.

1317
02:14:11,333 --> 02:14:13,333
Take care.

1318
02:14:20,333 --> 02:14:22,333
No.

1319
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:26,583
That's not it... Actually...

1320
02:14:26,792 --> 02:14:30,750
I'm going to Australia tomorrow.

1321
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,333
So I was thinking about how I
should say this to you.

1322
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I got this beer for you myself.

1323
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:43,833
That's all.

1324
02:14:45,583 --> 02:14:47,583
Nothing else.

1325
02:14:48,708 --> 02:14:50,708
Drink your beer.

1326
02:14:50,917 --> 02:14:55,958
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1327
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

1328
02:15:01,417 --> 02:15:06,667
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1329
02:15:06,875 --> 02:15:11,625
Take me with you today...

1330
02:15:11,875 --> 02:15:16,875
Take me a few steps forward...

1331
02:15:17,083 --> 02:15:22,500
I want to walk along with you...

1332
02:15:22,708 --> 02:15:27,708
Take me a few steps forward...

1333
02:15:27,917 --> 02:15:33,333
I want to walk along with you...

1334
02:15:58,292 --> 02:16:03,458
Did I misunderstand you?

1335
02:16:03,708 --> 02:16:08,042
You're correct. I was wrong.

1336
02:16:12,333 --> 02:16:14,583
Adi?
- Yes.

1337
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:17,667
Could you drop me to
the airport tomorrow?

1338
02:16:18,167 --> 02:16:20,667
I'll drop you tomorrow.

1339
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:23,917
Go to sleep.
Good night.

1340
02:16:24,583 --> 02:16:29,625
Whose story is this,
Who is reading it?

1341
02:16:29,667 --> 02:16:34,667
Who is living in a fairytale?

1342
02:16:34,958 --> 02:16:40,000
Whose story is this,
Who is reading it?

1343
02:16:40,042 --> 02:16:45,042
Who is living in a fairytale?

1344
02:16:45,208 --> 02:16:50,667
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1345
02:16:50,708 --> 02:16:55,167
Take me with you today...

1346
02:16:55,458 --> 02:17:00,582
Take me a few steps forward...

1347
02:17:00,583 --> 02:17:06,000
I want to walk along with you...

1348
02:17:06,208 --> 02:17:11,208
It's time.

1349
02:17:11,417 --> 02:17:16,833
I want to walk along with you...

1350
02:17:28,458 --> 02:17:31,958
Did you tell her?
- I'm dropping Nayantara to the airpot.

1351
02:17:32,625 --> 02:17:34,708
Talk to you later.

1352
02:17:40,042 --> 02:17:42,792
We've walked a 1000 paths,

1353
02:17:43,083 --> 02:17:45,375
And in the ups and downs,

1354
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:49,167
I hold close to you.

1355
02:17:50,875 --> 02:17:53,333
When the weather is grey,

1356
02:17:53,625 --> 02:17:56,083
If I get a little time,

1357
02:17:56,125 --> 02:18:00,250
I want to tell you how I feel.

1358
02:18:00,792 --> 02:18:05,833
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1359
02:18:05,875 --> 02:18:09,583
Let it be.
I can carry my own luggage.

1360
02:18:14,583 --> 02:18:16,375
Thanks.

1361
02:18:26,792 --> 02:18:28,333
Nayan!

1362
02:18:32,333 --> 02:18:36,583
Have you taken your medicine?

1363
02:18:44,208 --> 02:18:47,000
Nayan!

1364
02:18:59,125 --> 02:19:00,875
Bye.

1365
02:19:44,292 --> 02:19:47,292
Why aren't you picking up?
- She's gone.

1366
02:19:47,958 --> 02:19:50,583
I couldn't tell her.
- Where has she gone?

1367
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:54,000
There's no breaking news.
- Hell with breaking news!

1368
02:19:55,208 --> 02:19:59,083
Hello, Adi...

1369
02:20:07,167 --> 02:20:10,000
Hello? I told you-
- Where are you Adi?

1370
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:13,333
Please come to the entrance.
- I'm coming.

1371
02:20:13,875 --> 02:20:15,417
Right now!

1372
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:38,792
Adi...
- What's wrong?

1373
02:20:39,333 --> 02:20:43,208
At the immigration counter...

1374
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,000
Siraj!

1375
02:20:53,458 --> 02:20:54,958
Siraj!

1376
02:20:55,667 --> 02:20:59,708
Madam, you're done.
Please let the others through.

1377
02:21:01,625 --> 02:21:03,625
Next, please!

1378
02:21:04,333 --> 02:21:06,625
Calm down.

1379
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,750
Stay right here.
- Where are you going?

1380
02:21:39,458 --> 02:21:40,958
Yes?

1381
02:21:41,750 --> 02:21:45,250
Do you know Nayantara?

1382
02:21:46,333 --> 02:21:47,833
Who are you?

1383
02:21:48,125 --> 02:21:50,500
I'm Adi.
- Who are you to Nayan?

1384
02:21:51,583 --> 02:21:53,875
I'm her husband.

1385
02:21:57,042 --> 02:22:02,250
I am married. I could not face
my father on taht day.

1386
02:22:03,417 --> 02:22:07,125
That's why I left my own country.

1387
02:22:07,875 --> 02:22:10,167
I'm from a low income family.

1388
02:22:10,417 --> 02:22:14,875
What am I to say to Nayan now?
Let's get married?

1389
02:22:15,042 --> 02:22:17,792
You could have said,
Nayan I am sorry.

1390
02:22:18,167 --> 02:22:20,333
You could have said that
you haven't forgotten her.

1391
02:22:20,917 --> 02:22:22,958
I haven't forgotten Nayan.

1392
02:22:23,667 --> 02:22:26,250
And I know that she
can't forget me either.

1393
02:22:26,667 --> 02:22:31,000
That's why I sent
fake news of my death.

1394
02:22:32,458 --> 02:22:37,958
I was helpless.
- You could have asked how she was?

1395
02:22:39,208 --> 02:22:44,875
Very few people are lucky enough
to marry the ones they love.

1396
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:53,625
But it is possible to fall
in love after marriage.

1397
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,333
Isn't that so?

1398
02:23:02,375 --> 02:23:06,417
You'll keep her well.
See you.

1399
02:23:27,417 --> 02:23:31,792
I tried to explain things.
Trust me.

1400
02:23:32,417 --> 02:23:34,542
But he didn't listen.

1401
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:39,708
Who do you think you are?

1402
02:23:40,292 --> 02:23:43,250
Hero! Trying to play God?

1403
02:23:43,792 --> 02:23:47,833
Listen! He is dead to me.
You are alive!

1404
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:52,292
But you don't have the
patience to listen to me.

1405
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:59,458
Always in a hurry!
Critical and pessimistic.

1406
02:24:01,292 --> 02:24:09,292
When I wanted to open up to you,
you thought I wanted a divorce.

1407
02:24:10,792 --> 02:24:15,125
When I told you that I saw Siraj,
you ran to him!

1408
02:24:15,542 --> 02:24:17,583
Aren't you ashamed!?

1409
02:24:17,833 --> 02:24:23,625
You are intolerable and impossible!

1410
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:28,000
We can never be together.

1411
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:45,750
If you had opened this,
then we wouldn't be in this situation.

1412
02:25:03,833 --> 02:25:08,958
Open it alone. It's special.
I selected it for you.

1413
02:25:12,792 --> 02:25:16,833
Nayan!
- I won't wait for you.

1414
02:25:17,417 --> 02:25:21,458
Go back to your alcohol!
That is your life!

1415
02:25:21,625 --> 02:25:23,125
Stop!

1416
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:39,375
I am not afraid of my Dad.
And I don't think I'm God.

1417
02:25:42,292 --> 02:25:45,000
I love you.

1418
02:25:48,833 --> 02:25:53,875
Sorry brother. I
already have a boyfriend.

1419
02:25:54,958 --> 02:25:57,167
Fit and fine!

1420
02:26:24,458 --> 02:26:29,917
Whose story is this,
Who is writing it?

1421
02:26:30,208 --> 02:26:35,042
Who is moving out of
the dark in to the light?

1422
02:26:35,208 --> 02:26:39,833
Some are just wishes,
That shall never be fulfilled,

1423
02:26:40,458 --> 02:26:45,083
Take me with you today...

1424
02:26:53,083 --> 02:26:58,250
I want to walk along with you...

1425
02:27:00,167 --> 02:27:05,708
Wow! Breaking news!
Go hom today and now!

1426
02:28:25,833 --> 02:28:26,833
IF
