How long will you spend
time alone in the house?

5
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,500
One fine day you have to go out.

6
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,250
Why are you ignoring it by spending time in home?

7
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:30,083
Naina, now-a-days
customers are complaining about late delivery.

8
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,166
You have settled your business.

9
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,541
Why are you ignoring it by spending time in home?

10
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:41,125

He is not here.

50
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791

51
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,708

53
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,500
Do you expect me to wait for Mr. Sharma and my cheque too?

54
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,958
Its been three months, he didnt give me my cheque.

55
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
Wait for some more days.

56
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it?

57
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,583
You dont resist having Parathe!

58
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,416
That time you are in a hurry!

59
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:32,833
Why should I wait now?

60
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,750
You and Mr. Sharma have good health because of my Parathe

61
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,250
Did you get that!

62
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,458
You dont make so good Parathe.

63
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,083
You charge high.

64
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:41,916
What!

65
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,250
What did you say?

66
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:44,541
What did you say?

67
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,166
You commented on my Parathe?

68
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:47,750
Yes, so?

69
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,500
You meant they arent tasty?

70
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,291
Do you know the effort that takes to make Parathe?

71
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,958
What kind of efforts?

72
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,041
What do you mean?

73
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,291
To get up early in the morning, boil potatoes.  Boil potatoes!

74
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,666
Chop the onions.  Chop the onions!

75
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,250
Add salt.  Add salt!

76
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:00,875
Why are you repeating my words?

77
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,000
Is this an acting class?

78
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,875
Chop onions, add turmeric powder, salt, chili powder.

79
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,083
It needs concentration.

80
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,291
Keep this here and listen to me

81
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,416
What work you do?

82
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,375
I always see you applying you make-up

83
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,916
Should I expose you?

84
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,875
Sure, expose me.

85
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,416
I dont fear you either.

86
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,708
There is no use applying make-up.

87
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,875
How dare you calling me a fool?

88
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,875
Look at yourself.

89
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,125
You are a fool and you will look the same

90
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,291
Dont shout.

91
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:27,833

What will you do?
Who are you to ask me this?

95
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,583
Call Mr. Sharma, and ask him to give me my cheque.

96
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,583
You wont get your cheque.

97
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,416

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:39,875
Tamannaah!

135
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,541
Whoever she is!

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,250
I dont get furious easily.

137
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,875
She unnecessarily poked me.

138
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,958
Im sorry for that day.

139
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:47,666

What should I do?

147
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,041
You have to be disciplined.

148
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,875
We need your commitment.

149
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:13,125

It will be done today.

200
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:01,958
Why is it taking so much time?

201
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,000
Is this the way to make it?

202
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,458
Im an actor.

203
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,958
What are you making me do?

204
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,750

Thats okay.

212
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,916
What should I do?

213
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,625
Do one thing, join Tamannaah

214
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,458
Many masks have to be made.

215
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,625
Tamannaah!

216
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,041

00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,333
Tamannaah, if Naina helps you the work will be easier

Okay. She has to follow my orders.

222
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,708
Please have Parathe made by me.

00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,416
Excuse me, Maulik.  Yes

224
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,000
I need your help.

225
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,541
I will come.

226
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,458
Distribute these Parathe to all.

227
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,541
Faraz, Parathe

228
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,375
Tell me, what should I do?

229
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:05,916
He Parathe.....

230
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,333
Did you get the date?

231
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:15,875
What happened?

232
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,916
Auditorium is occupied for one year.

233
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:20,416
What?

234
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,208
This is the situation in Delhi.

235
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,916
Auditorium authorities had taken the place from government..

236
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
Assuring that they would promote performing arts.

237
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,125
But here, everything other than performing arts is telecasted.

238
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:34,916
I didnt get you.

239
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,041
Seminars of big companies take place here.

240
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,375
CA classes too are conducted here.

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,666
What are you saying?

242
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,583
Come here in the morning, you will understand.

243
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,083
The time that theatre artist need for
rehearsals are occupied by them

244
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,000
Why dont we try somewhere else?

245
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,500
This is the story in all auditoriums

246
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,958
There should be some place at least.

247
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,041
Lodhi road!

248
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:03,916
We may try.

249
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,416
Shall we go there?

250
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:06,791
Okay.

251
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:07,875
Come, lets go.

252
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,916
Check and mate!

253
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,666
Check and mate!

254
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,416
Shit!

255
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,416
Your game is over.

256
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:16,916
Shall we discuss?

257
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,208
Sorry, Naina.

258
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,708
Say

259
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,750
I checked your balance sheet of your theatre company.

260
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,250
You have done so many shows in these two years..

261
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,666
But the account is so weak.

262
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:33,375
Naina, I know the situation at present is not the good.

263
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,125
But Im sure everything will be fine.

264
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,083
just one thinks...

265
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,250
Will we do just one day show at Lodhi road auditorium?

266
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,875
We will do rehearsals for four months for that play..

267
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,416
And perform for just one day?

268
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,583
Naina, I have taken many efforts for that play.

269
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,000
Im happy even if there is one show at least

270
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,208
Maulik, I have gone through your script.

271
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,666
It is wonderful.

272
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,125
It should at least have 6 to 7 shows.

273
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,583
Its not that easy.

274
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,541
It requires huge budget

275
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,458
Should I speak to few organizers?

276
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,166
Which organizer?

277
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,875
Mr. Saloja.

278
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:16,250
Is he the one who conducts the theatre festival every year?

279
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,541
Yes. He is the one.

280
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,000
What if there is your show in that festival?

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,875
Is that possible?

282
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,375
Lets give it a try.

283
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,500
What if we get a chance!

284
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,375
Lets try.

285
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,750
Alright. Okay.

286
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,875
I will try to arrange a meeting.

287
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,250
Day after tomorrow will do?

288
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,125
Thanks, Naina.

289
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,541
Wait.

290
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,500
For god sake wait!

291
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,125
What are you playing?

292
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,291
Are you palying for a funeral?

293
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,625
Its Surelis wedding.

294
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,916
She is my daughter.

295
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,958
Will you play this tune for her wedding?

296
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,333
Dont stare at me.

297
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,041
Play some good tune.

298
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,333
Why are you standing dull?

299
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,250
Im hungry.

300
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,708
Are you hungry?

301
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,958
Didnt you have breakfast since morning?

302
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,458
You called us early morning.

303
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,166
Thats not done!

304
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,333
They are too lethargic.

305
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,583
Whats wrong with everybody?

306
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,791
Nobody had breakfast.

307
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,625
Oh god!

308
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,500
Are you all hungry since morning?

309
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,791
Why didnt you inform me before?

310
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,625
Since morning we are making tunes.

311
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,666
Its Surelis wedding.

312
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,791
I know that.

313
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,458
How can you play the instrument empty stomach?

314
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,666
Go to the Parathe lane behind and get few Parathe

315
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,000

Rabadi Parathe

319
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:46,875
Rabadi Parathe! Nonsense.

320
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,541
Isnt it too much to ask for?

321
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,833
Play some good music.

322
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:53,833
Okay

323
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,250

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,666
Mother, stop it.

00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,833
Brother, stop it.Stop it.

326

Mother, please listen to me.

329
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,791
Wait for a moment.

330
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,000
What happened?

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,625

00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,916
Come soon.

337
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,041
Rim Jim Kaur, is your shopping done?

338
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,333
What have you got?

339
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,833
Where were you?

340
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,708
Im searching for you since morning.

341
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,666
Where were you?

342
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,166
I have joined a theatre group.

343
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,958
Theatre group

344
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:18,791
Where?

345
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,666
Here, I our next lane.

346
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,583
The rehearsals are conducted in an orphanage.

347
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,750
Naina.

348
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:25,291
Yes.

349
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,208
How many people are there in that group?

350
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,375
There are many people in that group.

351
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,083
It might include all age groups.

352
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,666
Majority is young.

353
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,375
Im too young.

354
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,708
Yes, you are right.

355
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,041
I have done many theatre plays during college days.

356
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,791
So?

357
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,708
Father got to know this and he compelled me
to drop college and theatre group.

358
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,583
My God!

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Since 40 years Im haunting an opportunity to join a
theatre group.

360
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,125
Why dont you join this theatre group?

361
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,083
Your idea is not bad.

362
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,583
Are you serious?

363
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,291
Im not kidding.

364
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,041
She will marry and settle down.

365
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,083
You will be busy in your business.

366
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,416
Let me fulfill my wishes and dreams

367
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,291
Get her engaged first

368
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,291
Her wedding is just round the corner.

369
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,000
We are done with shopping.

370
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,416
You be chill.

371
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,625
Im chilled.

372
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:30,000
Come what may, I have decided to join theatre tomorrow itself.

373
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,166
What did you get it for me?

374
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,583
Go and check the musicians and see what they are doing.

375
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,166
They might be fooling around.

376
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,500
I have to go to market in evening.

377
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,541
Viven

378
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,125
we might need Dhanesh for rehearsals next week.

379
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,791
Inform him to take leave from office.

380
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,458
It would be good if everybody attend the rehearsals.

381
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:07,583
viven.

382
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,541
what if we prepare such a set for our next play?

383
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,000
Come sit.

384
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,791
You wish to leave this theatre group?

385
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,375
I dont wish to leave. but...

386
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,125
Your family is against it. Is it?

387
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,791
They consider this as my hobby.

388
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,625
They think Im wasting my time.

389
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,875
They want me back home.

390
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,833
I have few college friends who stay in Delhi.

391
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,000
They prank me for my passion whenever I meet them.

392
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,916
Its a discouraging environment.

393
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,791
The people who cant do anything by themselves,

394
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,333
They discourage others

395
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,416
They might criticize you.

396
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:16,958
You have to decide.

397
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:22,250
You have to decide your career according
to your wish or peoples wish.

398
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,041
Im tired.

399
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:34,833
Its too early to say this.

400
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:37,750
The problem has just started.

401
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,500
You have to go a long way.

402
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,041
The theatre rule is too simple.

403
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:46,958
The show must go on.

404
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,000
Come.

405
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:57,291
Tomorrow I need Viven, our stage manager backstage
with full of energy.

406
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,291
We have to finalize the auditorium too.

407
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,708
I guess, this is the one.

408
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,208
Maulik, someone is in.

409
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,416
Check out who they are.

410
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,375
Is Maulik available?

411
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,875
Meeting is on.

412
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,750
Please wait for some time.

413
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,958
Okay, I shall wait.

414
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,083
Maulik, I guess north campus is better option.

415
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,125
There should be maximum publicity in this area.

416
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,250
We will speak to the drama president of various colleges.

417
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,333
Okay.

418
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,250
We should display our posters too in college.

419
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,041
I shall display posters in 5 to 6 colleges

420
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,833
Which all?

421
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:48,416
GNC, Miranda house, Kamla Nehru and LSR.

422
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,041
All are girls colleges.

423
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:50,916
So?

424
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,458
Im doing my work.

425
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,416
Too smart!

426
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,541
Dont start it again.

427
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,833
Sorry.

428
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,250
Faraz, you will look after the north campus.

429
00:26:58,875 --> 00:26:59,583
Entire north campus!

430
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes.

431
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:01,833
How many days will you take to cover it?

432
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:03,833
Four days.

433
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,500
What are they doing?
Why four days?

434
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,875
Do it in two days.
Alright?

435
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,166
Okay, fine.

436
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:08,708
Dhanesh.

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,083
I will try to display posters in the companies.

438
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,666
In fact I guess there are people who will
take interest in this work.

439
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,291
We should gain good publicity

440
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:17,666
Okay.

441
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:19,791
Stop playing games.

442
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,083
Start calling the colleges.

443
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:21,916
Okay.

444
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,166
Faraz.

445
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,000
Hello.

446
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,333
Come on. Start.

447
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,333
Enough.

448
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:48,166
You should do publicity along with music.

449
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,666
When you start new work, it has to be larger than life.

450
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,833
Twitter is a good medium.

451
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,500
Why dont you use twitter?

452
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,208
You will gain good publicity.

453
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,875
You can open facebook account too.
Make a facebook account.

454
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,833
People will follow you and like your play.

455
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,375
You are smart people.

456
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,375
Open your linked in account.

457
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,583
Look at me.

458
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,333
Im wedding planner.

459
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,666
I advertise my business completely on facebook.

460
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,625
The work is quick and easy.

461
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,125
There is no problem.

462
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,541
Keep yourself updated.

463
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,875
I will go mad seeing your condition.

464
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:26,833
Mad people!

465
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,583
Get me water.

466
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,375
Water!

467
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,250
I asked for water.

468
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,583
One minute, I will get it.

469
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,791
Who is Maulik?

470
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:40,666
He is Maulik.

471
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,875
I am Maulik.

472
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,833
Are you Maulik!

473
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,625
I have heard a lot about you from Naina.

474
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,958
She told me that you run a theatre group.

475
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:50,375
Yes

476
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,000
I wish to join your group too.

477
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,750
Do you have theatre experience?

478
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,791
I have done many plays during my college days.

479
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,125
If you wish to take my auditions then you can do so.

480
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,416
If you wish to take my auditions then you can do so.

481
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,000
No problem.

482
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,375
No. No need to give an audition.

483
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,583
Your audition is done.

484
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,916
You are quite energetic.

485
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,416
Yes.
I handle my business efficiently.

486
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,625
I have got plenty of ideas for theatres.

487
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,583
You can join our group form tomorrow.

488
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,208
Really!

489
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:28,291
Play some good music. Its fun time.

490
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,250
I dont think so.

491
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,166
I have told you.

492
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,541
Do as per my orders

493
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,916
But, sir.

494
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,708
Dont interrupt me, when Im speaking.

495
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:49,041
Say.

496
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,666
This is show business.

497
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,541
Sir breakfast.

498
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:53,916
What is this?

499
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,708
I had told you to get Kachori!

500
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,625
Why did you get Samosa?

501
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:58,833
Sorry, sir.

502
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,333
Its been four days for him in this job.

503
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,875
He is speaking to me in English!

504
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:05,000
Get lost.

505
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:12,833
Unless you call heroines and have item numbers in your show..

506
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,000
Your show wont click the audience.

507
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,500
There is no profit in this.

508
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,666
We will conduct shows in Delhi, Up, Bihar and MP.

509
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,458
We will fit item numbers.

510
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,041
We will earn lot of money.

511
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,500
Do you think so?

512
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,458
Yes. Im sure.

513
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,583
Dont take tension.

514
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,208
You will get success.

515
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,916
Have faith in me.

516
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,250
Yes.

517
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:31,875
Did you get the list?

518
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:32,750
Which list?

519
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,625
Who will inform the details of heroines, their item numbers?

520
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:37,625
Okay.

521
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,458
Get going.

522
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,125

527
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:44,375

528
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,541
Come.

529
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:46,916
Yes.

530
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,208
Naina, how are you?

531
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,041

532
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,458

Now-a-days your mother is so famous in Chandni chowk.

535
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,041
Thank you.

536
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,375
Inform your mother to conduct one of our
festival in Chandni chowk.

537
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,375
Yes. Sure. I will inform her

538
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,583
Who is he?

539
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:17,791
Yes

540
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:18,791
He is Maulik.

541
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,333
I had discussed about him over the phone

542
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:23,041
Hello, sir

543
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:24,916
Your name is too good.

544
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,916
What is the meaning of Maulik?

545
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:29,375
Yes.

546
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:30,416
Maulik means priceless

547
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:32,666
Priceless!

548
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,875
What can I do for you?

549
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,333
Mr. Saloja, Maulik is a theatre artist.

550
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,125
He has done many plays.

551
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:42,916
Sir..

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,250
Im doing theatre in Delhi since past 6 years.

553
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,041
And what before that?

554
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,875
I have done theatre in Alwar too.
Sir..

555
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,291
I have had the sweets of Alwar long back.

556
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,166
It was too good.

557
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,166
Kachori of Alwar is famous too

558
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,375
Yes, it seems you have good knowledge about food.

559
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,291
Mr. Saloja, we have heard a lot about your festival.

560
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,583
Can you help Maulik?

561
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:07,416
What kind of help?

562
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,250
Sir, your festival is too huge.

563
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,833
I have heard a lot about it

564
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,208
Its a crowd puller.

565
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:21,416
If you slot my play in your festival, it will get me profits.

566
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,250
What about my profit?

567
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:32,916
I have my mother who will conduct your show in Chandni Chowk.

568
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,625
What else?

569
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,416
Yes, this is right.

570
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,791
I will get his play done.

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,125
Mr. Saloja, Mauliks play are always appreciated by audience.

572
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,291
You will find a status in Delhis theatre group.

573
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,041
The fact is..

574
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:52,166
I already have status in Delhi, Sonipat, Panipat, Gudgaon and many
other places.

575
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,958
Sale of tickets is must.

576
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,500
We should earn good money

577
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,833
Of course, yes.

578
00:32:58,833 --> 00:32:59,958
I take the guarantee of tickets.

579
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,083
Are you sure?

580
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,333
Madam is talking your guarantee.

581
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,333
Will you do something or else?

582
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,166
Sir....

583
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,416
Give me one chance in your festival.

584
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,333
Will you have Samosa or Jalebi?

585
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,291
No, thank you.

586
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,125
It gives acidity.

587
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,041
Naina. Ji

588
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,625
I wanted to speak to you separately.

589
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:31,875
Thank you, sir.

590
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,875
Boy Will he work or not?

591
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,458
He works great.

592
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,166
But you have to place a program in Chandni chowk festival.

593
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,500
Sure, definitely. Dont take tension.

594
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:49,250
Okay.

595
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,208
Will you have Samosa?

596
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,833
No, thank you.

597
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:53,625
I will take a leave.

598
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:54,458
Greetings!  Greetings!

599
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Thank you.

600
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,375
Naina, what happened?

601
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,208
Kitchen work is pending

602
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,083
I have left it half way.

603
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,791
Cloths are lying as it is.

604
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,083
You didnt dry them.

605
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,625
What happened?

606
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,708
I am talking to you.

607
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,041
He is stupid, nonsense and cheap!

608
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,583
What happened?

609
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,333
Mr. Khanna!

610
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,250
He took my contract away and duped my money

611
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,333
Let him go.

612
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:34,291
What have you got to do with it?

613
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,333
His Parathe arent tasty and neither does
he give delivery on time

614
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,500
That is his problem, if his Parathe arent tasty.

615
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,875
I have done many plays during my college days.Its his problem if
he doesnt give delivery on time.

616
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,375
What have you go to do with it?

617
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,250
Your business is running fine.

618
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,791
You are always involved in Parathe, business, masalas and
pickle.

619
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,750
You have messed up your life.

620
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,250
Go for rehearsals.

621
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,458
I need not go for the rehearsals.

622
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,250
They went and didnt take me with them.

623
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:57,625
Im left all alone here

624
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:02,083
Its been just 4 days since you have joined this group.

625
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,000
It is necessary to escort you where ever they go?

626
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,208
What does this mean?

627
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,833
He has to do his work.

628
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,083
You have to do yours

629
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,041
You are always furious.

630
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,250
Go for rehearsals.

631
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,791
Okay. I will go.

632
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,125
You are talking or blasting?

633
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,375
I said, I will go.

634
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,208
Im hungry.

635
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,666
I will go and have something.

636
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:27,291
Come down and reduce your temper.

637
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,708
You are looking like a balloon.

638
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:30,916
What?

639
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,416
You are looking like a balloon.

640
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:31,916
Ballon?

641
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:32,625
You mean I look fat?

642
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,250
Am I looking fat?

643
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:39,750
I dont want to speak to you.

644
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,916
Leave me. I dont want to speak to you.

645
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:43,541
I dont want to go for rehearsals.

646
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,125
I dont want to work.

647
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,375
I wont do.

648
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,583
I wont talk to them.

649
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:50,958

00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,250
I wont go for rehearsals.

655
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,750
I m too fed up with this work.

656
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,416
Im pissed off.

657
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:15,916
I wont speak to Maulik.

658
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,500
I wont go for the rehearsals.

659
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,083
I wont speak to anybody.

660
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,791
Naina.

661
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:33,875
Ranjan Kaur, what happened?

662
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,333
Why are you tensed?

663
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,958
Naina, Im too tensed.

664
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:38,958
What happened?

665
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,291
Work is pending.

666
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,500
Dont take tension. Everything will be done.

667
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,000
Dont take tension. Everything will be done.

668
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,208
Is it a magic?

669
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,541
We need manpower to get the work done.

670
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,291
We need to distribute these cards and sweets.

671
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:58,375
I had invited few people to assist me,
but they didnt turn up yet.

672
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,333
Wedding shopping is pending.

673
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,666
We need a person who assists us in managing
sweets during marriage.

674
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,583
Oh god! What should I do?

675
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,666
Should I call the people of theatre group?

676
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,791
You think they will agree?

677
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,666
Maulik, Dhanesh, Vivien and Faraz will surely come.

678
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,250
Its good if this is possible.

679
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,250
Call them.

680
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:20,291
Do it correctly.

681
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,125
What are you doing?

682
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,791
Get few Kalonji from kitchen.

683
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:28,291
Yes.

684
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,166
Mango pickle!

685
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,250
Maulik, pass me the oil.

686
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,916
Am I invited here to make mango pickle?

687
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,250
Help me out.

688
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,000
What should I do?

689
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:51,208
Please sit.

690
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:52,625
Okay.

691
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:53,500
I am here.

692
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:54,458
Open this.

693
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,833
Salt is less I guess.

694
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:16,666
You are smart.

695
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,208
Do it correctly.

696
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:26,750
Thank you.

697
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:32,166
Apart from theatre you have knowledge of other things too.

698
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,125
Yes, I know few.

699
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,458
Tell me, do you have a girlfriend?

700
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,791
Or still single?

701
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,458
I will make girlfriend if I have time apart from theatre activity.

702
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,666
I have always seen you among men.

703
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,708
Are you?

704
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,166
No.

705
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:49,916
I am perfectly normal.

706
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,875
Do you have a boyfriend?

707
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,083
I had many boyfriends, but they werent loyal.

708
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,000
None was perfect.

709
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:58,791
Is it?

710
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,833
What are your demands for a boyfriend?

711
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,750
He should be special

712
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,458
A man full of sparks.

713
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:06,500
I didnt get you.

714
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:08,416
You wont understand.

715
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,375
What about you?

716
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,166
What are your demands for girlfriend?

717
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,750
She should have sparks.

718
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:19,125
You are too smart.

719
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,125
Place it.

720
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,916
Maulik, you will blast me.

721
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:24,458
Why?

722
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:28,041
I invited you to give the wedding invitation card of Sureli.

723
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,666
I should have come personally but I had so much work here.

724
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,875
What should I do?

725
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,500
You may feel cheated.

726
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,208
You are a cheater.

727
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,833
You are a cheater.

728
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:41,791
What?

729
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:42,500
Nothing.

730
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:43,500
What did you say?

731
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,666
Nothing. Place the pickle.

732
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:45,750
Come on.

733
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,125
Maulik!

734
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:47,375
Pickle please.!

735
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,375
There is lot of work.

736
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:48,625
You have to give me the card too.

737
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:49,958
Fill it.

738
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:14,541
Oh god!

739
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,333
These green peas are so expensive.

740
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,125
In spite of ordering it, its quality is too low.

741
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,458
Look at her.

742
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,583
It feels she is making sweets in her dreams.

743
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,416
I have made it so nicely.

744
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,541
Brother, why are you listening to transistor?

745
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,166
Concentrate in making Puri

746
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,000
Puri has become so crispy.

747
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,125
Make it softer.

748
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:36,875
Oil is less.

749
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,166
Add ghee to it.

750
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:39,916

Do you know the intensity of commitment for theatre?

875

We need to portray each and every character with conviction.

876
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,083

00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:56,875
Guard.  Yes, sir.

942
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:57,833
Listen to me.

943
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,125
Send a plumber as soon as possible in room number 104.

944
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,333
Im too pissed off.

945
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,000
Be quick.

946
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,958
Firstly get this work done.

947
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,750
Okay, sir.

948
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:22,458
Sorry.

949
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,666
Maulik, you have made this house a hell!

950
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
Sir, please have a seat.

951
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:31,666
Im not here to sit.

952
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,958
Father has ordered to vacate this place.

953
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,541
Sir, I will pay your rent as soon as possible.

954
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,833
Its been four months since you didnt pay the rent bill.

955
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:39,750
How will you pay me now?

956
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,041
Vacate this place. Thats it.

957
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,875
We have a very big play thats pending.

958
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,916
Post that play, everything will be fine.

959
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:46,958
What should I do?

960
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,333
Hollywood!

961
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:28,416
Whats that?

962
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,166
English films.

963
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,708
Okay, like the Sunny Leone one?

964
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:34,750
Yes, I have seen many.

965
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,833
You are too naughty.

966
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:38,708
Mention not.

967
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,125
Whats that!

968
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,333
French look!

969
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,833
Show me your side face.

970
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:52,625
You look Italian by side face.

971
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,250
Isnt it?

972
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:55,208
Which side?

973
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,666
Both the sides.

974
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:59,916
Maulik, didnt we need a person similar
to this look in our play?

975
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,708
A guy having French look!

976
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:04,916
Yes.

977
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,833
Why arent you saying yes?

978
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:15,208
He cant believe that he has found the right character.

979
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,208
If you perform this main role in our play..

980
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,041
It would be so much fun!

981
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,125
Trust me!

982
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,500
What is the date of the play?

983
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,833
27th March.

984
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,083
I want this place to be vacated.

985
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,791
I want this place vacated post 28th March.

986
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,041
Yes, sure.

987
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:39,458
You need to settle your beauty parlor
business here!

988
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,333
When should I join you all for rehearsals?

989
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,625
Come after 15 days.

990
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,458
So late?

991
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,833
You are such a main stream star,

992
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,666
we need to make few arrangements for your rehearsals.

993
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,291
Isnt it, Maulik?

994
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,583
When will I get my dialogues?

995
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
Do you know?

996
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,166
A good actor is the one who expresses his
feelings without using words.

997
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,416
Vivian, say something.

998
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,041
Yes.

999
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:06,500
The main hero doesnt have any dialogues.

1000
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,958
He will express it all without words.

1001
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,625
It will be a solid performance.

1002
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,125
I will inform my mother about this progress.

1003
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,958
I will inform her that I have become an actor.

1004
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,708
Yes, go.

1005
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:19,250
Wow!

1006
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,833
How foolish of him to disclose about Sunny Leone!

1007
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,375
I should have slapped him.

1008
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,958
What when he returns after 15 days?

1009
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,083
Dont take tension, when Naina Kaur is here.

1010
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,625
I will manage everything.

1011
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,416
You make preparations for rehearsals.

1012
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:49,041
Maulik, Im too sleepy.

1013
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,125
What it should be?

1014
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,250
I have already suggested 8 names.

1015
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,708
Please let me sleep.

1016
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,500
Think about 8 more.

1017
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,416
Come on.

1018
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,083
Its been three hours.

1019
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,500
We have suggested 36 titles for the play.

1020
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,541
Guys, plays name should be different.

1021
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,375
It should suit the story too.

1022
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,333
Its not that easy to freeze a name.

1023
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,166
Stop sleeping.

1024
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,250
And think something.

1025
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:27,791
Im thinking.

1026
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,708
Keep sleeping and thinking.

1027
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,041
Maulik, I will come in some time.

1028
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,125
Where are you going?

1029
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,625
I will eat something and return.

1030
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:36,458
So late in the night!

1031
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,750
Im too hungry.

1032
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,041
You wont get anything.

1033
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,333
I will get Parathe in the next lane.

1034
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:41,958
Okay.

1035
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,291
Be quick and come soon.

1036
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,500
Gali me Parathe!

1037
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:49,583
Gali me Parathe!

1038
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,416
What happened?

1039
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,125
Parathe wali gali!

1040
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,416
I didnt get you.

1041
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,333
Your plays name, Parathe wali gali!

1042
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,708
All characters in your play are from Parathe wali gali

1043
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,583
So what should be the name of the play?

1044
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,166
Parathe wali gali!

1045
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:08,166
Your play starts and ends at Parathe wali gali

1046
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,041
Name is good.

1047
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,000
But..

1048
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,041
Its too good.

1049
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:15,958
I made your life easy.

1050
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,041
Im too smart.

1051
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:18,500
Isnt it?

1052
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,000
What say guys?

1053
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:21,958
Okay.

1054
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:25,958
I think its done.

1055
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:36,458
There is no rain and there is no mood to wait near the window.

1056
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,250
You stay happy.

1057
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,083
Im happy.

1058
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,208
Im very happy.

1059
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:45,166
Yes, we can see that.

1060
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,708
I said, dont take tension.

1061
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,541
Im fine.

1062
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,916
Your smile is missing.

1063
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,083
No, Dhanesh.

1064
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:59,083
Your relation with the
character in this scene is not at all established.

1065
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:02,250
Is she your mother, or any other relative?

1066
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,791
Did you meet her somewhere?

1067
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,833
Every line has a hidden emotion.

1068
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,625
Its not clear at all.

1069
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:13,500
And yes, understanding the sub text is very important.

1070
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:14,750
Whats that?

1071
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,291
Every line has a hidden meaning.

1072
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,250
You have to understand that.

1073
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,541
Try to take pauses at the right place.

1074
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:26,666
Understanding the time line and time period
is very important.

1075
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,208
Okay?

1076
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:31,416
If I knew this since childhood,
I would have become a superstar by now.

1077
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,041
Superstar Anarkali!

1078
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:36,250
Whats wrong with him?

1079
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:38,166
I am Anarkali from Nagpur.

1080
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,500
I sell flowers.

1081
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,916
But, you all dont deserve it.

1082
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,875
So I wont sell it to you.

1083
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:48,416
Hows it?

1084
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,375
Make up is fine.

1085
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,166
There is improvement in the performance.

1086
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,166
There is problem in the basics!

1087
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,291
Is it? What?

1088
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:05,875
If your character is inspired by Maharashtrian,
then why did you drape saree like Gujrati?

1089
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,666
I didnt notice it.

1090
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,083
Understand the background of the character.

1091
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,833
Understand its likes and dislikes.

1092
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,958
In short to create a character, study its..

1093
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:19,833
Physiology details, Sociology details, Psychology details.

1094
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,208
Yes, I will do that.

1095
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,291
I understand these things slowly.

1096
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:30,875
Maulik, he is too lazy to understand these things quickly.

1097
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:33,708
Why did you poke in?

1098
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:34,291
Okay.

1099
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:35,916
I will go to the market.

1100
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,833
You two continue your rehearsals.

1101
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,833
Vivian, lets go.

1102
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,083
Okay.

1103
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,166
Why did you get upset, my dear love!

1104
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,166
I will hit you!

1105
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:46,750
Dont start it again.

1106
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:51,625
Hi, Naina.

1107
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:52,750
Hi, Maulik.

1108
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,166
Not bad, the place is good.

1109
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,791
After all the credit goes to me.

1110
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,708
Yesterday, Jaswinder had called.

1111
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,666
We need to vacate that place too.

1112
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,041
Dont take tension.

1113
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,666
Where are others?

1114
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,541
Maulik, Faraz had called.

1115
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,791
He said he is not feeling well.

1116
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:17,541
What about Dhanesh and Vivien?

1117
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Dhanesh is stuck in Gudgaon.

1118
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,041
It will take him 2 to 3 hours to reach.

1119
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:23,166
He is stuck in traffic.

1120
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,291
Im unable to contact Vivien.

1121
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,208
Whats the use of calling me, when they all are missing?

1122
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,708
Im here.

1123
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,041
Listen.

1124
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:38,041
Sorry.

1125
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:41,250
Say.

1126
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,125
You say.

1127
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:50,333
Maulik, I wished to say sorry to you.

1128
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:51,500
Why?

1129
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:57,333
I didnt join your theatre group to participate in the play.

1130
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,041
Then?

1131
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:04,541
I thought since you have theatre group
you will perform plays.

1132
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:07,250
Your shows are crowd puller.

1133
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,916
I thought to feed audience, my hand made Parathe

1134
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:11,750
So as to grow my Parathe business.

1135
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,833
Are you from Amritsar?

1136
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:18,208
....

1137
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,666
Amritsar people have this characteristic.

1138
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:24,833
Hello, Im not like that.

1139
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,291
I have done theatre in Khalsa College.

1140
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:34,750
Theatre was a jus a reason to escape lectures
and go for movies.

1141
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,708
We use to have so much fun.

1142
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,416
Now-a-days, I like theatre.

1143
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,958
I just like to work backstage.

1144
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:42,500
Is it?

1145
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,958
When you do rehearsals..

1146
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:46,541
Then?

1147
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,083
Then?

1148
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:54,666
When you do rehearsals.. and..

1149
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:58,958
When you blast actors, it looks awesome.

1150
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,875
When I get furious, do I look good?

1151
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,666
Yes, you do.

1152
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,708
The way you are passionate for theatre..

1153
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:10,541
I have the passion to make and feed Parathe.

1154
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:16,541
When I will owe a shop at Parathe wali Gali,
you can do your rehearsals there.

1155
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,041
Thank you.

1156
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,750
But conditions applied.

1157
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,208
What conditions?

1158
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:25,708
If Im sick or if I go out of town..

1159
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,833
I wont shut my shop.

1160
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:32,708
In such case, you have to come to my shop
and feed Parathe to public.

1161
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,375
You will do your rehearsals and
people will have Parathe too.

1162
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:39,125
The way you believe show must go on.

1163
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,375
Shop should also be on.

1164
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:42,541
Isnt it a good idea?

1165
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:46,625
That means, if my theatre doesnt go well..

1166
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,791
I have a fixed job in your shop.

1167
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,833
Why will you do a job in my shop?

1168
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,291
My shop is your shop.

1169
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:54,500
Is it?

1170
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,083
Naina Kaur is like this.

1171
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,000
Tell me something,

1172
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:04,791
Did you deny Dhanesh and Vivien to approach us here?

1173
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:09,291
Yes, so?

1174
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:17,375
Maulik, I wish to speak to you.

1175
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,625
I find it tough to keep my mind stable.

1176
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:27,000
I think about you, throughout night and day.

1177
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,791
You have become my facebook page.

1178
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:34,750
I feel like logging you every morning.

1179
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,416
I dont intend to logout later.

1180
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,666
I heart always have just one tweet for us.

1181
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,250
We live like Romeo and Juliet.

1182
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,875
What the hell!

1183
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,833
No, thats not right.

1184
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,750
Maulik, you know..

1185
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:56,583
We both should..

1186
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,208
Naina, what are you doing?

1187
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:08,333
Maulik, do you know the fact that there are
many things common between us.

1188
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:19,958
Maulik..

1189
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,333
I love you, Maulik.

1190
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:29,416
Come.

1191
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:33,250
Will you become Amitabh Bachchan or something else?

1192
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,166
Where are we?

1193
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:35,208
This is a right place.

1194
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,708
This is a right place.

1195
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:38,666
Come, lets sit here.

1196
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,291
Please, excuse me.

1197
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,375
Make three Parathe

1198
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,083
Get us Lassi

1199
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:46,625
Okay.

1200
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,708
Be quick.

1201
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:50,458
I got to tell you something.

1202
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:55,875
My colleagues are asking me, weather
Im portraying goat or monkey in the play.

1203
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,750
You are already a monkey.

1204
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,666
Didnt they recognize you yet?

1205
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,583
I shall hit you.

1206
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:07,541
Post this main show and few other
shows I shall drop this job.

1207
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,666
I am bored with this job.

1208
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:13,000
I will join Mauliks theatre group full time.

1209
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:14,083
100 percent.

1210
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:14,708
Hey guys.

1211
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,291
Hi Maulik.  Hi.

1212
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,833
Dhanesh, you have a lot of work
pending in the plays last scene.

1213
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,000
I have made various plans for the play.

1214
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:27,458
I will portray my character in an organized way.

1215
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:28,458
This is my first show.

1216
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:30,833
When did you start understanding such things?

1217
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,291
Im more matured than you.

1218
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,166
Oh!

1219
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:37,750
We can see how matured are you.

1220
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,125
Oh!

1221
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:43,750
Vivien, we need huge manpower
backstage on our play day.

1222
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,083
It will be done.

1223
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,666
Post one or two shows and later with two to four shows..

1224
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,208
Im planning to call my parents from Alwar.

1225
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:55,833
They can catch one or two shows of us.

1226
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,958
I will give my best to this show.

1227
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,500
I have so much pressure on me.

1228
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,333
You will have pressure on you.

1229
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,250
You anyways resemble a pressure cooker.

1230
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,125
Dhanesh, dont poke him.

1231
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:10,833
Continue to have your food.

1232
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,958
You are my facebook page.

1233
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,708
You are my facebook page.

1234
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:20,750

I feel like logging you every morning.

This is going right.

1240
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,625
This is going right.

1241
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,375

My heart..

1246
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,500
My heart..

1247
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,375
Always tweets about you!

1248
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:49,208
What are you saying!

1249
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,625
My heart always tweets about you.

1250
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,416
You and I live like Romeo and Juliet.

1251
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:59,875
Yes, its done.

1252
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:12,083
Maulik, I love you.

1253
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:12,958
I love you, Maulik.

1254
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,208
Love you.

1255
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,125
I love you.

1256
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:16,583
Yes!

1257
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,916
I love you too, my dear.

1258
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,166
Did you start your drama?

1259
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,500
Im not doing drama.

1260
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,791
You are making a scene.

1261
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,958
I am observing you since many days.

1262
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:43,416
Why do you speak to yourself?

1263
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,500
Why dont you speak to Maulik?

1264
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:48,791
No, mother.

1265
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:49,500
Why?

1266
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:51,458
What if he is hurt?

1267
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,208
What is there to get hurt?

1268
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,666
He too likes you.

1269
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,291
Make a note of it.

1270
01:08:58,916 --> 01:08:59,666
Its nothing like that.

1271
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:02,500
I dont blabber things.

1272
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,958
I know I am right.

1273
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:06,291
You are confessing your feelings. Thats it.

1274
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,250
Mother, he has his show today.

1275
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,291
He will be busy with his play.

1276
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,416
Confess your feelings post the play is finished.

1277
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,208
Okay. I will think about it.

1278
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,208
Dont think. Just go for it.

1279
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,041
Say yes.

1280
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:26,958
Yes!

1281
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:28,166
Yes!

1282
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,708
Thats like it!

1283
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:32,375
Its done.

1284
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:36,083
You will confess your feeling to Maulik today in the evening.

1285
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,458
You will confess that you are queen in his heart.

1286
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,625
You may leave.

1287
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:43,041
Im going.

1288
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,375
Listen to me.

1289
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:50,208
In evening, wear the suit that you had stitched.

1290
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,208
You look cute in that attire.

1291
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,958
You look sweet, my child.

1292
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,125
Take these grapes.

1293
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Buy these grapes.

1294
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,875
Oh god!

1295
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:06,875
Shit!

1296
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,708
What the hell!

1297
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,583
Its nonsense!

1298
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:15,833
What should I do now?

1299
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,375
This is utter shit!

1300
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,333
What are you starring at me?

1301
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:35,625
Faraz, get me water.

1302
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:41,375
Take this.

1303
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:42,458
Go far and clean it.

1304
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,291
Vivien, see this.

1305
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:07,333
Maulik.

1306
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:11,125
Hi.

1307
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:15,708
How am I looking?

1308
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,125
Remove the tag at least.

1309
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,250
This was hilarious!

1310
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,708
This was hilarious!

1311
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,958
I have a strong feeling that your show will be a hit.

1312
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:33,166
Thanks, Naina.

1313
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:34,833
You have helped me a lot.

1314
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,375
Maulik, we shall load this luggage in the truck.

1315
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:39,708
Rajesh is waiting for us.

1316
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:40,583
Okay.

1317
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,208
Be careful.

1318
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:48,375
Did you take everything?

1319
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:48,791
Yes.

1320
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:57,416
Maulik, I need to speak to you.

1321
01:11:58,416 --> 01:11:59,083
Tell me.

1322
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,500
We will speak after the show.

1323
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,041
If its important we can speak now.

1324
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,375
No. We will speak after the show.

1325
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:18,833
Okay.

1326
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:26,291
Okay.
Listen, you are looking pretty.

1327
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:33,250
Maulik, there is huge traffic jam.

1328
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:34,125
What should we do?

1329
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:35,791
I will come.

1330
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:38,458
I will come in some time.

1331
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,916
Mother, Maulik had put in lot of efforts for that show.

1332
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:52,375
Yes.

1333
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:56,000
We all were very excited for that show.

1334
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:58,500
But..

1335
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:08,666
That day the show didnt take place and
neither did Maulik speak to anyone since then.

1336
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,041
Mother, I didnt expect this.

1337
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:19,250
Naina, many times things are out of control.

1338
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,750
They are destined to happen.

1339
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:26,750
If something goes wrong that doesnt
mean you get emotional and sit at home.

1340
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,333
I have to do something.

1341
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:30,583
Do one thing.

1342
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,875
Call Vivien, Dhanesh and Faraz.

1343
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,166
I will speak to them.

1344
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:40,208
Maulik has so much talent in him.

1345
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,083
We cant let it go in vain!

1346
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:43,833
We are there to support him.

1347
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,916
We will support him.

1348
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:49,041
We will make him famous in the theatre group.

1349
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,416
Yes, believe me.

1350
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:52,666
Mother!

1351
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,166
Come, my child.

1352
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:00,208
Okay.

1353
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,500
I didnt speak to him since many days.

1354
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,291
Lets see what happens.

1355
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:10,875
I went to meet him.

1356
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,125
He went away.

1357
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,541
Kundan, sing your favorite song.

1358
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:15,833
Yes, okay madam.

1359
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:38,583
Your condition is similar to this song.

1360
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:39,875
Why are you upset?

1361
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:45,875
We will advertise our show so much to the extent that..

1362
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,625
It has to go houseful with 10 shows in the row.

1363
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:51,583
I will unite the entire Chandni Chowk.

1364
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:54,000
Audience will find it tough to get our show tickets.

1365
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:55,666
It feels good to hear this.

1366
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,000
How is it possible?

1367
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:00,416
Whats wrong with you?

1368
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,458
Its too early to comment on it.

1369
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,750
I have made you understand many times.

1370
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,708
But you are not ready to follow my orders.

1371
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,166
I have heard so many time from you all that..

1372
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:13,125
Maulik is suffering from depression.

1373
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:18,833
Theatre plays the role of romance in Mauliks life.

1374
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,291
We have to bring this romance back in his life.

1375
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,250
If romance returns in his life it means..

1376
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,291
Romance has entered our life too.

1377
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,833
Its not that easy.

1378
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:30,833
What? Romance?

1379
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,416
To bring Maulik, back to theatre.

1380
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:36,583
I am kidding.

1381
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,958
Tell me, what should we do?

1382
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:41,666
Maulik is not ready to stand anybody.

1383
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:45,291
We went to meet him.

1384
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:58,625
Come.

1385
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:21,208
What did you do?

1386
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,000
Books are pending. Tear them too.

1387
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,416
Tear these posters too.

1388
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,375
What else can be expected from you?

1389
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,708
You are too weak.

1390
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,250
Its our mistake to have joined your theatre group.

1391
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,333
You had made so many plans.

1392
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:47,875
You were supposed to do shows in
Jaipur, Ahemdabad and Kanpur.

1393
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,875
What about those shows?

1394
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:52,291
What about the planning?

1395
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,375
Our theatre group is vanishing.

1396
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:02,333
We dont feel like doing anything else
other than theatre, if we are here.

1397
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:08,000
Sighting your energy I fell everything is finished.

1398
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,291
Maulik, do you remember what you had assured me?

1399
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:14,833
The show must go on.

1400
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:17,416
What about this fact?
What about the plan?

1401
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,666
Im tired.

1402
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,333
Please go from here.

1403
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,625
You cant get tired.

1404
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,291
I know you well.

1405
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,166
You are our inspiration.

1406
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,125
You brought us to theatre.

1407
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:37,416
You have to come back to theatre.

1408
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,083
Maulik, we are performing that play again.

1409
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,666
At IT auditorium.

1410
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,166
This time the play will be conducted.

1411
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,208
I have left theatre.

1412
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:50,916
You have to come, Maulik.

1413
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,000
You have to come for theatre.

1414
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,041
I said, Im not coming.

1415
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:07,458
We cant force him.

1416
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:15,708
We have to make him realize the dreams of his life.

1417
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:19,916
Its important that he come for rehearsals in theatre.

1418
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:21,416
Who will get him?

1419
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,333
I will get Maulik back in rehearsals.

1420
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:29,625
Thats like it.

1421
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:34,166
If he come for rehearsals,
its possible that Viviens plan works.

1422
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,291
It will work.

1423
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,166
The idea has to work.

1424
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,875
This is done.

1425
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,083
We will meet Maulik the day after tomorrow.

1426
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:48,458
This is right.
Faraz, stop reading that book.

1427
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,458
100 ways to impress a girl.

1428
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,291
When did I read such books?

1429
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,208
Then which book o you read?

1430
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:57,791
The book to impress boys?

1431
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,208
What do you read?

1432
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,583
Maulik.

1433
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,208
How are you?

1434
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:44,583
You disregard me.

1435
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,166
Can I take your two minutes?

1436
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,250
Some books have arrived on stands.

1437
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,250
I had been to NST.

1438
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,458
I have got it from there.

1439
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:20,708
Amongst these, this book is on theatre culture.

1440
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,333
Maulik, Im sorry.

1441
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,000
Im responsible for this.

1442
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,041
I shouldnt have introduced you to Saloja.

1443
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:51,875
Naina, its not your mistake.

1444
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:57,250
My theatre is of no use.

1445
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,500
I got emotional.

1446
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,375
We have to practical.

1447
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:12,750
Now-a-days,

1448
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:18,208
who writes drama on serious and social issues?

1449
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:21,916
No, Maulik.

1450
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,625
Its not like that.

1451
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,083
We all like your theatre.

1452
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:31,958
There are many people who like watching theatre like yours.

1453
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,000
You all are too nice.

1454
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,625
One fine day we have to accept the reality.

1455
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,833
I will go back to Alwar.

1456
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:06,458
No, Maulik.

1457
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,333
Not now.

1458
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,125
You have to prove yourself.

1459
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:13,541
Or else people like Saloja will go ahead in the race.

1460
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,458
You told to be practical in life.

1461
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:20,708
Why dont you be practical?

1462
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:22,458
Prove yourself.

1463
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,583
The show will happen again.

1464
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:31,000
The audience who will attend the show
will be the people who like Mauliks theatre.

1465
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,666
We need not depend on anybody.

1466
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:37,250
We will do this show in unity.

1467
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,291
Please come for rehearsals.

1468
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,833
I dont like to deny again and again.

1469
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,333
I have said this before.

1470
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,000
I dont wish to do theatre.

1471
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:07,541
Maulik, we miss you.

1472
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:12,958
We discuss about you whenever we meet.

1473
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:31,375
Maulik, we will wait for you.

1474
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:02,375
Maulik, just 15 minutes remains for the show to start.

1475
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:04,041
The audience crowd is in good numbers.

1476
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,208
I will get your costumes.

1477
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,208
Okay.

1478
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,750
Okay.

1479
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:41,791
A day will come when you need to close
this theatre business.

1480
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,583
Sir, please.

1481
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:46,916
I have put in a lot of efforts.

1482
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:51,041
Please give me one chance.

1483
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,166
How can you expect this?

1484
01:28:54,666 --> 01:28:57,875
I have many hopes.

1485
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,708
I have many hopes.

1486
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:06,125
Once this festival is done,
I would like to go to Vaishno devi temple.

1487
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,958
Where is Vaishno devi?

1488
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:11,250
Its a goddess temple.

1489
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,916
You mean the temple on the hills!

1490
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:16,000
Absolutely correct.
I so wish to go there.

1491
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,750
Sir.

1492
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,833
Who is he?

1493
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,125
say.

1494
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,250
Hello, sir.

1495
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,375
How are you?

1496
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,291
Im fine.
Say!

1497
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:28,791
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

1498
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,750
Which opportunity?

1499
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:33,833
To allow my play in this festival.

1500
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:35,458
Excuse me.

1501
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:37,333
Who said you are performing a play?

1502
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,458
To allow my play in this festival.

1503
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:41,625
I didnt get you.

1504
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:44,125
Its been two months,
since the tickets of your play were out.

1505
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:45,291
But it didnt sell.

1506
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,708
Public rejected it.

1507
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:49,125
Nobody watch such plays.

1508
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:52,291
Sir, I didnt understand.

1509
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,875
Play is cancelled.
It stands cancelled.

1510
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:57,375
Meet him.
Do you know him?

1511
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,416
Hi.

1512
01:30:58,791 --> 01:30:59,708
He is from Mumbai.

1513
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,458
He does sex comedy.

1514
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,583
He had called four days back.

1515
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:07,250
He wished to perform play in this festival.

1516
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,750
I called him to check the response.

1517
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,958
Within four days, the show is houseful.

1518
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:18,041
Sir, only two hours is remaining.

1519
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:20,500
My team is ready.

1520
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,916
We practiced a lot since six months.

1521
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,041
So? Should I feed you?

1522
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,250
Dont you understand?

1523
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:31,833
Sir, my play is on a social issue.

1524
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,291
Its a good play.

1525
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:36,125
Do some socializing.

1526
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,083
You will understand the expenses.

1527
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:43,583
Theatre is a good medium to bring social awareness.

1528
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:46,875
This is a good platform to discuss social issues.

1529
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:50,083
Do one thing, add some sex comedy in your play.

1530
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:53,500
I shall discuss all your social issues.

1531
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:54,416
Are you ready to do it?

1532
01:31:56,208 --> 01:32:00,541
Theatre is not an item number
to place business angle and sell it.

1533
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,666
Are you a joker?

1534
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:08,000
If so, then it doesnt suits in real life.

1535
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,750
Sir, please.

1536
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,791
My entire team is ready.

1537
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:14,375
Give me one chance.

1538
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:15,291
He started it again.

1539
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:16,708
Listen to me.

1540
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:21,291
The theatre that you are performing
will trap you in few newspaper articles.

1541
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,458
One newspaper shall cover your photo.

1542
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:25,750
Few people might discuss your good omen.

1543
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:29,583
And in future you will get an award by name of felicitation.

1544
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:34,333
In an award ceremony, you will be honored and bid goodbye.

1545
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:38,291
Dont you have any value for that award?

1546
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:41,500
Where are the people who have received such awards?

1547
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:43,041
Who knows them?

1548
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:48,625
A lay man too is earning good
sum in theatre due to such hit stuff.

1549
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:50,416
Being technically strong is good.

1550
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,375
But improve your management.

1551
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:57,875
Or else one find day you have to shut this business of yours.

1552
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,708
Sir, water.

1553
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:02,833
Sir, what happened?
Jairam has arrived.

1554
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,666
Attend him and inform him that I will come in some time.

1555
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:05,541
Sir, please.

1556
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:07,458
Listen to me carefully.

1557
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,875
Commercial angle is important.

1558
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:13,583
Such social issues and awareness doesnt work.

1559
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,125
Audience needs laughter.

1560
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,166
Laughter comes from here.

1561
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,916
Read my old reviews.

1562
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:23,750
Read my old play reviews.

1563
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,500
Press has always appreciated it.

1564
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,083
Please, give me one chance.

1565
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:29,458
Why do you consider yourself as hero?

1566
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,833
Anybody can bribe the press to appreciate their work.

1567
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,166
Anybody can do that.

1568
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,000
Please, sir. One chance.

1569
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,541
Sir, please give me one chance.

1570
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:38,916
Get out from here.

1571
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:40,500
Sir, please give me one chance.

1572
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,541
Do you need a chance?

1573
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,333
Sir, please.

1574
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,291
Sir, please give me one chance.

1575
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:57,833
Do you need a chance?

1576
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,708
Do you need a chance?

1577
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:03,375
Sir, please.

1578
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:09,333
Get lost.
Sir, please.

1579
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:32,291
Maunik.

1580
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:41,458
For whom am I doing this show?

1581
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,083
The audience who are waiting out..

1582
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:57,625
They need item number like cinema.

1583
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,208
I cant meet their demands.

1584
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,541
Everybody is like Saloja.

1585
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:16,791
They dont like to see my theatre.

1586
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,416
If there are 100 Saloja then there are 40 Maulik too.

1587
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,625
They like your theatre.

1588
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:33,750
Maulik, people like you are very few.

1589
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:40,041
There are many people who wish to fulfill their dreams.

1590
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:44,708
Maulik.

1591
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:47,666
If you dont prove yourself today..

1592
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:54,083
Then it may discourage others who have suffered like you.

1593
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:58,500
People like Saloja will win.

1594
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:04,916
Maulik, you have to go on stage today.

1595
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,583
I love you, Maulik.
