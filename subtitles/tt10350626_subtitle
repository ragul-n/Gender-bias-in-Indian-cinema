1
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,625
We've been patrolling for ages.

2
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,125
Are these guns just for show,
or are we ever going to actually use them?

3
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,375
That's what Dayal Sir's wife says, too.

4
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,416
Is the gun just for show,
or will you actually use it?

5
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,125
-What was that, Biswa?
-We're just kidding, sir.

6
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,166
Don't get cheeky with me.

7
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,291
Sorry, sir.

8
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,958
Section, take cover!

9
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,083
-Fire ahead! Two o'clock!
-They're firing from the front!

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,750
-Take your positions!
-Take cover!

11
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,708
Biswa! Take positions!

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,041
Take cover!

13
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:53,958
Sir, we've got you!

14
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,250
Get the first aid kit!

15
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,083
One for 15, come in!

16
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,750
15 for 1. Pass message. Over.

17
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,791
Enemy fire at check-post two
and three! Over!

18
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,958
Confirm enemy fire. Over.

19
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,666
Heavy fire! There are enemy soldiers
hiding in the valley ahead!

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,583
We'll handle them,
but Subedar Dayal is badly wounded.

21
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,416
He can't go any further.
We need emergency evacuation. Over.

22
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,750
Roger that!

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,333
Wing Commander Singh,
there's an emergency evacuation.

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,791
We have 30 minutes.

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,541
-Prepare your chopper. Over.
-Pick-up coordinates?

26
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,458
Kilo valley. South of Tololing.

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,416
Closest helipad at GR12344323.
Over.

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,333
Copied.

29
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,916
Chopper for CASEVAC
will be airborne in seven minutes.

30
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,750
It's an emergency CASEVAC.
Get two choppers ready.

31
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,375
All the pilots are out on their missions.
Who's going to go?

32
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,208
Gunju!

33
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,833
Dada, let me look.

34
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,250
Gunju, let me sleep.

35
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,541
-Dada, please let me look!
-Gunju, please let me sleep!

36
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,625
Juice?

37
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,375
Come.

38
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,041
Come!

39
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
Do you want to fly the plane?

40
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,208
Okay. Hold this.

41
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,958
When I say left, you steer left.
Slowly. Okay?

42
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,125
Ready?

43
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,041
One, two…

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
three…

45
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,583
left.

46
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,041
Can I sit there?

47
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,416
To sit here, you need to be a pilot.

48
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,708
Pilot.

49
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,125
Gunju! You look blind in these goggles!

50
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,041
-Dada, I want to be a pilot.
-And I want to be Kapil Dev.

51
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,541
I'm serious. I want to be a pilot.

52
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,041
Girls don't become pilots.
You know what girls can be?

53
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,750
Here. Hold this and ask,

54
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,166
"Sir, veg or non-veg?"

55
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,458
Come on.

56
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,958
"This aircraft has four emergency exits.
Two in the front and two in the back."

57
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,666
And from which exit
would you like to be thrown out?

58
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,625
-Papa, she wants to be a pilot.
-So?

59
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,875
-As if girls can be pilots.
-Really?

60
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
Which buffoon has taught you this?

61
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,208
Don't pay attention to him, love.

62
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,333
Whether it's a man
or a woman flying the plane,

63
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,583
they're both called pilots.

64
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,333
And if the plane doesn't care
who's flying it,

65
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,250
why should you?

66
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,125
You can be anything you like.

67
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,416
-But first, complete…
-My education!

68
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,333
Yes.

69
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,458
And, you… 20 squats.

70
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,541
Why?

71
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,541
From the moment I saw you

72
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,666
I just can't get you out of my head

73
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,708
I lost my head
And now I just keep following you around

74
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Gunju!

75
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,041
How can you be a pilot
if you're scared of heights?

76
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,458
Come on! Fly!

77
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,750
Jump!

78
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,875
Wherever you are
There I'll be

79
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,166
Excellent!

80
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,916
I can't help it

81
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Now and forever

82
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:36,250
I'm tied to you

83
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:41,708
I'm tied to you

84
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,083
Who wears goggles at night?

85
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,875
Pilots can't risk damage to their eyes.

86
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,666
Gone case.

87
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,541
Push and pull

88
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,875
Cut and tear

89
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,125
This bond we share

90
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:13,000
Can't be broken

91
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,833
From sunny days

92
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,958
To misty nights

93
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:24,041
This bond we share is forever

94
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,375
Wherever you are
There I'll be

95
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,416
All my roads lead me to you

96
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,333
I can't help it

97
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,250
Now and forever

98
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:41,041
I'm tied to you

99
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:45,208
I'm tied to you

100
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,750
I'm tied to you

101
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:56,208
I'm tied to you

102
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,416
Gunjan, I passed!

103
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,208
With 42 percent. Can you believe it?

104
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,833
What's wrong?

105
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,125
Did you fail?

106
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,541
Ninety-four percent.

107
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,250
So, why are you sad?

108
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
-What's this?
-Have a look.

109
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,125
What do I say at home
after getting 94 percent?

110
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,375
That I don't want to study,
I want to be a pilot?

111
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,708
Okay, do one thing.

112
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't be scared, just go to your dad.

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,416
Just be like, "Papa, girls my age
are only chasing boys,

114
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,625
but I just want to chase my dreams.

115
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,291
Am I not the best daughter in the world?"

116
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,458
And Papa will agree?

117
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,250
-No! He's going to lose it!
-This is no time for jokes, Mannu!

118
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,166
Look, Gunju.

119
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,958
If you speak up,
you're going to get some flak.

120
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,875
But if you don't, you'll always regret it.

121
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,541
Let's go. You owe me a treat.

122
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,666
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations, my dear!

123
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,375
-Very well done, dear!
-Great work!

124
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,916
Gunjan, congratulations!

125
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,250
Very well done!

126
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,666
Ma!

127
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,541
My sweetheart,
my darling, my topper is here!

128
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,583
What is all this?

129
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,833
Your dad decided to celebrate your result.

130
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,416
-Why?
-Go and change your clothes.

131
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,833
-Quickly!
-But where is Papa?

132
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:53,791
Cheers!

133
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
-Gunjan is the pride of Lucknow.
-She's brilliant.

134
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,916
She loves studying.

135
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,250
She's never without a book.

136
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,541
She's made us proud.

137
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,750
-Cheers!
-Congratulations!

138
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,416
Ma!

139
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,583
-Ma!
-Kirti!

140
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,541
-Kirti, listen!
-Hold on.

141
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,458
Can you take Dabboo to the bathroom?
He's about to wet himself!

142
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,666
-I need to speak to you.
-Come, baby, let's go.

143
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,041
Keep it in!

144
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,125
Congrats.

145
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,416
Gunju! Look, it's Topper Gunju!

146
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,416
-What is it?
-I have to tell you something important.

147
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,625
Gunju, it's our song. We'll talk later.

148
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,875
Come on.

149
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,250
Give it up for Topper Gunju!

150
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,041
Gunju!

151
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
She's going to dance to our favorite song.

152
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,000
This is her favorite song.

153
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,041
Gunju!

154
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,791
Where are you going?

155
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,166
Dada, I…

156
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,291
Dada, I don't want to go to college.

157
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,916
Dada, I don't want to go to college.

158
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:20,791
Pilot…

159
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,000
Pilot…

160
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,166
Dada, I want to leave school
and go to Delhi to be a pilot!

161
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,291
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,166
Grow up, Gunju.

163
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,208
Focus on college now.
We'll figure it out later.

164
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,791
But I don't need
to go to college to be a pilot.

165
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,333
You don't?
Do you know the hardships we've faced?

166
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,875
I know! You were extremely poor.

167
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,583
-I've heard it 100 times.
-You learned nothing from it.

168
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,583
My family was too poor
to send me to college.

169
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,791
And this one is rejecting
the opportunity! Wonderful!

170
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,708
-Ma, relax. She isn't going anywhere.
-Why not?

171
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,500
I want to do this.
Why are you guys being so--

172
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,333
You're going to live in Delhi by yourself?

173
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,416
Dada, you joined the Army.
Why can't I be a pilot?

174
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,125
Fine, be a pilot. Go away.
Do what you want.

175
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
Maybe I should leave and go away.

176
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,958
What's all this drama?

177
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,583
She's going to fly a plane,
and I'm going to my mother's house.

178
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,416
For now, maybe you should handle
the guests. Let me handle her.

179
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,916
Go.

180
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,208
Go on.

181
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,333
Children shouldn't
be allowed such freedom.

182
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,583
-No one understands that anymore.
-What's all the murmuring about?

183
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,083
Go. Go join your friends.

184
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,041
Very good.

185
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,208
They're kids. All kids have fights.

186
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,500
The good news is
that everything is under control…

187
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,458
except Mr. Khanna.

188
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,000
Come now, let's get the music back on.

189
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank God, Gunju agreed.

190
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,833
She agreed, right?

191
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,875
No.

192
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,500
I agreed.

193
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
Mr. Saxena, drink?

194
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,041
Tenth grade… 94 percent.

195
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,333
Twelfth grade…

196
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,791
-Where's your 12th grade report card?
-I don't have it.

197
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,958
So, get it.

198
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,083
-But I haven't done 12th grade.
-So, do it.

199
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,000
Isn't passing 10th grade
the minimum requirement?

200
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,041
It was. Now, it's 12th grade.

201
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,333
You should've done your homework
before coming here and wasting my time.

202
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,833
Come on. Next!

203
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,625
Everything happens for the best.

204
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,916
The astrologer said that Gunju
will forget all this in two years.

205
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,833
She'll even finish college.

206
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,208
She's going to be a pilot, no matter what.

207
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
Whose side are you on?

208
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,166
I'm just on this side.

209
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,541
Twelfth grade… 87 percent.

210
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,250
Very good. And…

211
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,500
Where's your college diploma?

212
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,416
I don't have it.

213
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,166
So, do it.

214
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
But the minimum requirement
was to pass 12th grade, right?

215
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,708
It was. Now it's college diploma.

216
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,625
Come on. Next!

217
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,708
The astrologer said it's very simple.

218
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,583
We go to the temple every Monday,
offer two coconuts,

219
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,833
and in three years,
she'll get over this pilot nonsense.

220
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,791
Listen…

221
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,666
When will you get over
this astrologer nonsense?

222
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,416
I'm--

223
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,833
I'm on this side.

224
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,083
Good night.

225
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:13,000
Here's 10th, 12th, and college diploma.
All done.

226
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,125
Thank you so much.
We're filled with gratitude.

227
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,791
Take this to Mr. Shrivastava
at the admissions counter.

228
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,708
Fill out the admission form,
and deposit ten lakh rupees.

229
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,083
Why ten? The course fee is five lakhs.

230
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,333
That was five years ago.

231
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,958
With petrol prices doubling,
how can the course fees remain the same?

232
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,041
Come on. Next!

233
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,166
Just a second, sir.

234
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,500
Why ten lakhs for a three-year course?

235
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,458
The course is three years, but it takes
six or seven years to finish it.

236
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,666
Are you just going to sit here asking
questions or will you apply for admission?

237
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,041
I've been saying it from the start,
everything happens for the best.

238
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,125
Where would we get ten lakh rupees from?
Even if we had managed,

239
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,166
she'd be in training for six years,
then get a job.

240
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
When would she get married? It's good.

241
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,625
I won't get married.

242
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,000
Until I become a pilot,
I won't do anything.

243
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,166
What nonsense is she saying?

244
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,208
Papa, is there really
no way to arrange the money?

245
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,875
Of course there is!

246
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
I have an idea, Mr. Saxena.

247
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,291
Sell this house. Okay?

248
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,750
The madam can fly planes,
while we sleep on the street.

249
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,916
Hey…

250
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,375
-Good morning, Gunjan!
-What is this Sugar Scandal?

251
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,750
Sit.

252
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,750
Look.

253
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,375
Is Gunju up?

254
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,666
Yes.

255
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,458
Here, have some rice.

256
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,416
Ma…

257
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,208
-Could you pass the dal?
-Of course.

258
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,666
Here you go.

259
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,958
-You aren't eating anything.
-I wanted to eat a little light today.

260
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,541
-Ma…
-Yes, dear?

261
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
Ma, I don't want to be a pilot.

262
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,791
You see?

263
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,791
The astrologer was right.

264
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,125
-Thank the Lord.
-I'm joining the Air Force.

265
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,125
What?

266
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,375
Look at this, Ma.

267
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,833
What is this?

268
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,166
I see.

269
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,458
Join the Indian Air Force,
apply for the first ever batch of…

270
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,291
Yes. Girls are allowed for the first time.

271
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,333
Wonderful.

272
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,458
Patriotism is in your blood.

273
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,458
I'm proud of you… both.

274
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,625
She's not a patriot.
She just wants to fly planes.

275
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,250
Gunju, grow up!

276
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
The form's been filled.

277
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,083
-And you said nothing.
-He's the one who filled it.

278
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,000
Huh?

279
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes.

280
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,250
Incredible. If she can't be a pilot,
then Air Force.

281
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,875
If not the Air Force, maybe an astronaut?

282
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,041
And if NASA doesn't take her,
maybe she can be Superman.

283
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,916
If even that fails, Gunju,

284
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,458
why don't you inflate yourself
like a balloon and float away.

285
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,000
Do whatever you like.

286
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,625
Because there's no one here
who'll stop you, right?

287
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,875
-I'm done.
-Don't leave your food like that.

288
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,708
No. I told you I'm eating light today.

289
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,958
Done packing?

290
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,250
Sit.

291
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,250
-What time is your train?
-Tomorrow morning, 4:45 a.m.

292
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,125
Here.

293
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,000
If I can drink with you, I should
be able to talk freely with you.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,916
Go ahead.

295
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,583
Papa, ever since Gunju was born,
you've indulged her every whim.

296
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,250
When we were kids, we didn't let
anyone's sister play cricket with us.

297
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,500
But you made us include Gunju
with the boys.

298
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,083
You let her go to the cinemas
late at night.

299
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,291
You never limited her in any way.

300
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,458
And now, you're letting her
join the Air Force?

301
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,458
You were in the Army.
You know how tough it is there.

302
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,041
Papa, I love her,
and I do want to see her happy.

303
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:12,916
But right now, her happiness
is not as important as her safety.

304
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:18,458
It seems like you're not
considering her safety.

305
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,875
Don't you think

306
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:25,625
you're putting her in harm's way,
in the pursuit of happiness?

307
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,583
I think…

308
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,041
you shouldn't drink.

309
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,541
Good night.

310
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,125
Thank you, sir.

311
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,041
Next!

312
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,916
Go!

313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,833
Listen up!

314
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,583
If you want to join the Air Force,
you have to be a soldier first,

315
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,791
or else, go sit in the kitchen.

316
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,458
Understood?

317
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,875
Next.

318
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,625
Yes! Next!

319
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,041
Go!

320
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:50,083
Who can tell me
the color of the Ashoka Chakra?

321
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,333
Sir!

322
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,500
Number 96.

323
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,125
Stand up.

324
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,125
What is the color of the Ashoka Chakra?

325
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,041
Sir, blue.

326
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,958
The Ashoka Chakra is black.

327
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,625
What is it? Black.

328
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,791
Yes, sir. The Ashoka Chakra is black.

329
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,208
Sit down.

330
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,500
Sir?

331
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,625
Yes?

332
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,375
The Ashoka Chakra is blue.

333
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,416
So you're going to teach me
about the Ashoka Chakra?

334
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,833
Yes, sir.

335
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,875
Fear makes you make mistakes.

336
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,500
The Ashoka Chakra is…

337
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,166
blue, of course. How can it be black?

338
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,166
Sit down.

339
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,833
Climb up.

340
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,333
Look outside.

341
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,791
Jump.

342
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,500
-Jump!
-Sir?

343
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,625
Please, it's too high.

344
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,375
Sir, I'm scared of heights.

345
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,166
-I said, jump!
-Sir, I won't jump!

346
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,583
-Sir, I'll do anything else.
-Stop!

347
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,916
Jump!

348
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,250
Jump!

349
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,750
Next!

350
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,041
Discuss two Indian major
current affairs topics.

351
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,250
Two lakh people have been evacuated
from Surat

352
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,291
because of the pneumonic plague…

353
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,541
…which is the worst plague
in the last ten years.

354
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,500
Already…

355
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,708
…25 people have died…

356
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,041
…and 150 are sick.

357
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,500
That…

358
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,291
According to unofficial sources…

359
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,166
…100 people have lost their lives.

360
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,333
Sir, Sugar Scandal?

361
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,500
What do you have to say
about the Sugar Scandal?

362
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,500
The Sugar Scandal
is known as a huge scandal…

363
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,541
The country has suffered huge losses.

364
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,875
Because of this, our country's…

365
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,291
It is…

366
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,916
Do you know anything about our country?

367
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,375
Anything, sir?

368
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,750
Anything is better than nothing.

369
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,875
The hit song from this year…

370
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,083
"Baby, it's Cold Outside,
But Warm in Here"

371
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,833
is attracting a lot of controversy.

372
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:32,708
Many of India's intellectuals
have taken issue with the lyrics.

373
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,958
After the success
of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,

374
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,833
there's been a 250% rise
in the sale of Pomeranian dogs,

375
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,708
and Tuffy the dog has
reportedly signed three more films.

376
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:44,208
-Enough.
-As the lead.

377
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,166
Thank you.

378
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,541
-You can leave.
-Thank you, sir.

379
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,541
So, Mr. Mishra… What do you think?

380
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,458
Sir, Tuffy gave a great performance
in that film.

381
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:05,833
Hello, everyone.

382
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,125
Please settle down.

383
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,666
So, the results of this SSB
were quite poor.

384
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,250
The performances are not up to the mark.

385
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,958
Unfortunately, this means
we can't select many candidates.

386
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,500
Number four.

387
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,166
Chest Number 4?

388
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,125
Number 4!

389
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,458
-Is there Chest Number 4 here?
-Yes, sir.

390
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,625
You may go for your medicals.

391
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,625
The rest of you…

392
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,583
Next time, work harder.

393
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,166
Thank you.

394
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,708
Congratulations.

395
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,583
Congratulations.

396
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,208
Morning, sir.

397
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,041
I, X, U, Y, T, H, Y, M, X, V.

398
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,208
One-sixty-four.

399
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,958
Take a deep breath.

400
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,166
How do you feel?

401
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,458
I can't believe it, ma'am.

402
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,666
I swung from a rope,
Papa, just like Tarzan!

403
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,083
Wonderful! And the medical?

404
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,958
Medicals are done.
There's just some formalities left.

405
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,375
Okay, come home soon, my Tarzan.

406
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,791
I'm going to get a truck
full of ice cream for you.

407
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,166
Chest Number 4!

408
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,958
Okay, Papa, I have to go.
I'll see you at home.

409
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,125
Okay, go.

410
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,041
Bye!

411
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,250
Come in.

412
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,416
Please have a seat.

413
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,083
Your medical test results are in.

414
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,916
You have a…
temporary and a permanent disability.

415
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,375
You're 7 kg overweight.

416
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,416
And your height is
1 cm below the requirement.

417
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,125
So we can't select you.

418
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:02,291
You can appeal in two weeks,
but I don't want to give you false hope.

419
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:07,375
I've never seen anyone win
an appeal for a permanent disability.

420
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,708
So…

421
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,208
You could have waited a little
and eaten with her.

422
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,208
She's here.

423
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:50,083
Great! Come, your ice cream
is waiting for you.

424
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,583
Gunju?

425
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,666
What's wrong?

426
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,416
What are you doing?

427
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:36,708
Yoga.

428
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,583
Go back to sleep.

429
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,375
Good morning, Gunju!

430
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,833
Good morning, Gunjan.

431
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,750
-Good morning, dear.
-Papa, please let me sleep.

432
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,500
I've brought you something.
See what it is. Come on, get up.

433
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,625
-Papa, I don't want to.
-Come on, take a look.

434
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,875
-What is this?
-Your future.

435
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't have one.

436
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,250
Come on, just read it. Get up! Up!

437
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,666
Read this. Get up.

438
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,333
Read.

439
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,375
Read.

440
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,875
Go on.

441
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:23,666
"Superstar actress Rekha
lost 15 kgs in a month."

442
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,250
-Sixteen.
-Fifteen.

443
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,375
Sixteen… Page sixteen. Inside.

444
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,416
Read.

445
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,000
"Rekha gave up fried food and desserts."

446
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,041
Yes.

447
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,541
"She drank pumpkin and gourd juice.

448
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,958
With exercise and hard work,
she got her dream role."

449
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,083
Incredible!

450
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,708
Here.

451
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,291
Papa, I can drink all the juice
in the world to lose weight,

452
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,666
but how will I become taller?
That's the real problem, right?

453
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,875
Let's work on what we can control,

454
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,041
and leave the rest to God.

455
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,500
Those who work hard
and never give up in life…

456
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,125
are always rewarded with success
in the end.

457
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,083
Instead of shedding tears,

458
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,250
just sweat it out for two weeks.

459
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,166
Gunjan…

460
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,875
Get up.

461
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,083
Get up.

462
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,458
How can we do this "Rekha Diet"?

463
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,791
Why not?

464
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,916
If Ms. Rekha can do it,
what's stopping Ms. Gunjan?

465
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,541
-Rekha, O Rekha!
-Let's go!

466
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,916
From the moment I set my eyes on you
My destiny's been changing, too

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,041
I'm in big trouble

468
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,416
Rekha, O Rekha!

469
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,083
From the moment I set my eyes on you
I've gone off the deep end

470
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,250
I'm in big trouble

471
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:28,500
Feels like I'm stuck in a nightmare

472
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:36,291
Feels like I'm stuck in a nightmare

473
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,958
Day and night
You're all that's on my mind

474
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,375
You've even robbed my sleep!

475
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,666
Rekha, O Rekha!

476
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,875
You're taking me down a bumpy road

477
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,541
But, girl, you're my only hope!

478
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,625
Rekha, O Rekha!

479
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:05,250
Girl, you drive me crazy

480
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,541
I have no peace of mind

481
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:15,416
But please, oh please
Tell me we're in this together!

482
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,750
Rekha, O Rekha!

483
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,875
From the moment I set my eyes on you
All my dreams are coming true!

484
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:34,125
I think I'm gonna make it
Thank you!

485
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,583
Rekha, O Rekha!

486
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,416
From the moment I set my eyes on you
I see myself in you, too

487
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,583
I think I'm gonna make it
Thank you!

488
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:49,166
Feels like all my dreams are coming true!

489
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:55,541
Feels like all my dreams are coming true!

490
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,833
I leave these streets behind

491
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,875
Strewing them with my goodbyes

492
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,375
I'm finally leaving the world behind

493
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,333
So I can fly, fly, fly!

494
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:19,458
My train is leaving the station

495
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,625
Full steam ahead it goes

496
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:27,291
I won't be looking back again

497
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:30,958
To the skies, I go!

498
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,083
Rekha, O Rekha!

499
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:36,458
From the moment I set my eyes on you
I see myself in you, too

500
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,958
I think I'm gonna make it
Thank you!

501
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:47,000
Feels like all my dreams are coming true!

502
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,000
Hmm.

503
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,625
Okay.

504
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,458
Well, your weight's come down.

505
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,583
But… how will you increase your height?

506
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,750
Sir, it's just one centimeter.

507
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,166
Just one centimeter?

508
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,250
The pilot sits here.

509
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,708
Sit.

510
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,000
Height is directly proportional to reach.

511
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,000
Hold this.

512
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,458
Sit back.

513
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,958
Straight.

514
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,250
Hmm…

515
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,666
Now hold it.

516
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,291
Hmm…

517
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,916
Okay. Put your feet on the pedals.

518
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,541
Okay.

519
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,458
Please get down.

520
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,958
Don't worry, darling.

521
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,000
You tried your best.

522
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,000
Gunjan is below the required height.

523
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,625
-Yes.
-But…

524
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
her arm and leg reach is above
the requirement by 1.5 centimeters.

525
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,000
Colonel…

526
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,833
When God selects someone to fly a plane,

527
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,083
who are we to reject her?

528
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,000
So… congratulations.

529
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,375
Your daughter has been selected.

530
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:00,291
Best of luck.

531
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,333
Thank you.

532
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,083
Papa?

533
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,791
-Yes?
-I have to talk to you about something.

534
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,833
Papa, please come.

535
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,458
Okay, come.

536
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,458
Yes, tell me.

537
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,166
Papa…

538
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,916
The Air Force needs pilots
who are patriots.

539
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,833
Hmm…

540
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,625
I just want to fly planes.

541
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,250
I'm not being a traitor
to the country for my dream, am I?

542
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,041
What's the opposite of treachery?

543
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:45,500
Sincerity?

544
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:50,208
If you do your work with sincerity,

545
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:53,333
you cannot be a traitor to the country.

546
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:59,708
You think the Air Force wants people
who chant, "All hail Mother India"?

547
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:07,375
No, they want cadets
with goals, with passion,

548
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,500
who are sincere and work hard
at their training.

549
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,416
Those are the cadets

550
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,958
that make the best officers,
who give their country their best.

551
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:25,791
Be a strong, hard-working,
and sincere pilot,

552
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,666
and you'll automatically be a patriot.

553
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,458
Come on.

554
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,750
You've spent enough time on the runway,
now fasten your seat belt.

555
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,166
It's time to take off.

556
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,000
Woke me up for such a silly thing.

557
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:49,208
You know, cadets need
at least eight hours of sleep. Go to sleep.

558
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,166
Come on.

559
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,541
The Air Force has only one goal:
protecting the nation.

560
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,666
For that, you all must become soldiers.

561
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,625
That's when you'll be worthy
of entering the cockpit.

562
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,583
You start your training tomorrow.

563
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,250
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

564
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,291
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

565
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,833
You gotta fly, fly, fly

566
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:21,583
Don't be scared
Don't you worry

567
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:25,541
Grab a piece of ground
And just go, go, go

568
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,416
You gotta soar, soar, soar

569
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,250
Don't you slow down
Don't you stop

570
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:39,250
Tell your life you make the rules

571
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,041
Take a leap!

572
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,125
Touch the moon!

573
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:48,583
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

574
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:56,416
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird

575
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,416
Collective, fully down.
Cyclic, fully back.

576
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,750
Now, level the disc…
now, helipad appears.

577
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,500
Flare. Cyclic, back.

578
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,541
Let your light shine so bright
That before your fate is sealed

579
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:12,000
The Lord himself stops and asks…
"What is it you want, child?"

580
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,416
Burst through those barriers!

581
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,958
Don't let your doubts hold you back!

582
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:40,458
-Burst through those barriers!
-Proceed with the attack!

583
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:42,916
-Don't let your doubts hold you back!
-Tackle!

584
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,666
Stab! Remove!

585
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,666
Fire!

586
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,583
Let go of the old!

587
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:51,875
What's wrong?

588
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:52,958
Sorry, sir.

589
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,375
Only bullets work in battle,
not your sorries. Go again.

590
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:59,958
The moon is no limit for you

591
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:07,500
You gotta fly, fly, fly
Don't you stop, don't give up

592
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:11,875
You were made for the skies
Not the earth!

593
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:20,166
You gotta fly, fly, fly
Don't you stop, don't you look back!

594
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,041
Just follow your heart

595
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,083
Take a leap!

596
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,583
Touch the moon!

597
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:34,083
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

598
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:41,625
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

599
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:46,083
Just fly, fly, fly

600
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:55,541
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

601
00:44:56,708 --> 00:45:00,500
Like a free bird!

602
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:08,250
Let your light shine so bright
That before your fate is sealed

603
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,958
The Lord himself stops and asks…
"What is it you want, child?"

604
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:15,416
Let your light shine so bright
That before your fate is sealed

605
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,750
The Lord himself stops and asks…
"What is it you want, child?"

606
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,416
Ma, where's my blue T-shirt?

607
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,291
-In the cupboard.
-I can't find it.

608
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:30,000
Gunju… here you go.

609
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:39,125
-You're really a pilot, Gunju.
-Not a pilot, dada, an Air Force officer.

610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,875
-So you're definitely going?
-Of course I'm going, dada.

611
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,958
Ma, where have you kept my shoes?

612
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,666
They're in your room.

613
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,416
Where in the room, Ma?
They're not even under the bed.

614
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,458
Maybe they're outside, Gunju.

615
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,000
Where do you leave my stuff?

616
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:11,250
Gunju, the world Papa's shown you
is very different from the real world.

617
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,375
Come here.

618
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,041
Come.

619
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:26,291
-What is this?
-A picture from my passing out parade.

620
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,041
What do you see here?

621
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,166
I see Air Force officers, dada.
Why are you--

622
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,500
How many? Count them.

623
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,041
Eleven.

624
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:39,625
Ten.

625
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,958
Ten Air Force officers and one girl.

626
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:45,750
That's how the world thinks, Gunju.

627
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:50,333
I can't change the way the world thinks,
but I can tell you.

628
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,291
Please try and understand.

629
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,125
Here we see Shekhar sir
not in the mood to lose,

630
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,875
but Monty sir is in the mood
to defeat him for the third time!

631
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,666
The smile on his face
says he will succeed,

632
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,625
but Shekhar sir won't lose so easily!

633
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,416
And Shekhar sir is about to win,
but Monty sir…

634
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,125
Shekhar sir wins!
Monty sir was not good enough today!

635
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,833
Hey! What are you doing, man?

636
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:39,458
-What's going on here?
-Why are you ruining our life, bro?

637
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,000
-Ask the Flight Commander.
-Where is he?

638
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:45,041
If you peel your eyes away for a sec,
you'll see.

639
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,083
Jai Hind, sir!

640
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,750
What's… going on?

641
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,833
Relax.

642
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,666
Get ready, officers.

643
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,791
Udhampur is about to see a big change.

644
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,250
A change unlike any you have seen before.

645
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,416
All dirty talk stops now.

646
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,583
Overalls to be zipped up
at all times. Harry.

647
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,416
The bar shuts at 9:00 p.m. And, yeah…

648
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,083
No more posters of women on the walls.

649
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:13,000
Sir…

650
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,125
Why are you punishing Ms. Pamela?

651
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,833
What's she done wrong?

652
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,291
I'll let you know once I've spoken to her.

653
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,958
What's this now?

654
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,083
This is it.

655
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,458
Ms. Change.

656
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:57,875
The first female officer at Udhampur base.
Gunjan Saxena.

657
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,375
Keys for Pilot Officer
Saxena's room, please.

658
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,750
Sure, call him.

659
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,916
I'm Pilot Officer Saxena.

660
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,333
But you're a woman…

661
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,375
-Madam! Flight Commander is calling you.
-Okay.

662
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,833
Keys?

663
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,208
Jai Hind, sir!

664
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,250
Come in.

665
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,333
What an explosive entry.

666
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,833
You created quite a storm
in the gent's toilet.

667
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,125
What medal should you get
for this show of courage?

668
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,000
Sorry, sir.

669
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:47,083
I didn't want to go to the gent's toilet,
but it was an emergency.

670
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,375
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find a ladies' toilet--

671
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:51,416
Because there is no ladies' toilet.

672
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,083
Why is that, sir?

673
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,625
Because this place isn't made for women.
Any other questions?

674
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,833
-No, sir.
-You may go.

675
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:05,791
Sir.

676
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,500
-Jai Hind, sir.
-Jai Hind, sir.

677
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:14,958
-Jai Hind, sir.
-Jai Hind.

678
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,458
Jai Hind, sir.

679
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,000
Pilot Officer Gunjan Saxena?

680
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:20,958
Sir.

681
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,333
Today's your first sortie.
See you on the tarmac in 10.

682
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,958
-Yes, sir.
-Jai Hind.

683
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:26,500
Jai Hind, sir.

684
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,958
-Without this--
-Sorry, sir.

685
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,208
Jai Hind, sir.

686
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,000
Sorry?

687
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,750
This is the Air Force, not your house.

688
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,666
I'm sorry, sir.

689
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,250
Sorry doesn’t change anything.

690
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,458
The Commanding Officer was on time,
but you were late.

691
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,708
-Sir, there's no place for me to change--
-Then change on the tarmac!

692
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,708
Stop making excuses.

693
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:12,833
I'm sorry, sir.

694
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,166
Again sorry?

695
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,416
All your flights are canceled today.

696
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,291
Crew room excused.

697
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:19,958
Stay on the tarmac all day!

698
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,000
Out!

699
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,625
Joker!

700
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,083
Once, Viru… Viru, shut up.

701
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:44,916
Sunaina told him--

702
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
-No, sir.
-Shut up, man.

703
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,541
Sunaina said, "No one's home, come over."

704
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,166
Then what happened?

705
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,625
Viru went and no one was home!

706
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,666
He's always teasing you.

707
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,958
Well, he's my senior.
You're welcome to it, too.

708
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,250
Poor Viru!

709
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,208
All alone…

710
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,666
I'll be right back.

711
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,583
Sir…

712
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:14,333
-Sundar. Drink…
-Sir, what were you saying in the evening?

713
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:15,875
Yeah, come, let's discuss it.

714
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,083
Sir!

715
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,083
What's wrong?

716
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,083
Sir, can you stop these sorties?

717
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,541
I'm terrified. I mean…

718
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:55,416
What if she starts crying in an emergency?
What will I handle, her or the chopper?

719
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,250
-Gunjan.
-Sir!

720
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:08,000
Your sortie is canceled.
The captain is not well.

721
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,000
Go back.

722
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,375
Sir, I was in a boys' school.

723
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:52,916
I've never even spoken to a girl on land.
What will I do in the air?

724
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,833
Save me, sir. Please.

725
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:55,875
Gunjan.

726
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:59,916
The captain's wife is sick.
Your sortie is canceled.

727
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,500
Sir, please understand.

728
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,000
I don't want to die while training
because of a girl.

729
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,708
-Sandhu…
-Sir, please have it canceled.

730
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,583
The chopper's engine is leaking oil.
You can take a break today.

731
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,375
I've been on a break
since I got here, sir.

732
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,541
How's training going, love?

733
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,041
Everyone's training but me, Papa.

734
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:14,500
Sir, it'll be a problem.
Try and understand.

735
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,083
Girls can't even drive cars.
How will she fly a chopper?

736
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,500
So you're also scared?

737
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,875
Should I take the controls?

738
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,500
No. I can manage. You relax.

739
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,125
Jai Hind, sir.

740
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,916
Quick, turn or we have to salute her, too.

741
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:57,666
Your sortie is canceled.

742
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,541
-But, sir, every day--
-But, what?

743
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:00,500
Hmm?

744
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:03,333
You know tonight's
an overnight sortie, right?

745
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,875
Do you want to share
a room with the male pilots?

746
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,625
Or should we build you a special room?

747
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:27,708
The top performing pilot
of this quarter is Shekhar.

748
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,375
Airborne for 120 hours.

749
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:33,291
He has upgraded his category
from C-White to C-Green.

750
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,125
From the next quarter, Shekhar will
lead formation flying sorties

751
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,916
and high-altitude flying briefings.

752
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,583
Shekhar, you may sit.

753
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:41,541
Sir!

754
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:43,625
Next in the rankings is Montu.

755
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,916
Airborne for 105 hours.

756
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,250
Then Harry, 98 hours.

757
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,291
And Sandhu, 92 hours.

758
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:53,375
Sir, these are
our top pilots this quarter.

759
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:55,541
Last in the ranks is Gunjan.

760
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,458
Airborne for 11 hours.

761
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,708
-Eleven hours.
-Yes, sir.

762
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,625
Pilot Officer Gunjan?

763
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,750
-Yes, sir?
-Were you ill?

764
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,750
-No, sir.
-Were you on leave?

765
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,583
No, sir.

766
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,208
Then why aren’t you in the air, Gunjan?

767
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:21,291
Today will decide whether
you stay or leave.

768
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,708
See me at the tarmac in 10 minutes.

769
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:29,958
We are done, boys.

770
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:36,416
There is no place for bad pilots
in the Air Force or in my unit.

771
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:37,958
But, sir, I'm--

772
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,458
If you want to make excuses,
you can go home now.

773
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,458
No more excuses, please.

774
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,791
Sir, I'm not a bad pilot.

775
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:52,291
Right!

776
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:53,791
Let's see.

777
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,833
Gunjan! Engine failure!

778
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,375
Recover the chopper
and go for emergency landing!

779
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:07,041
Collective fully down,
speed 60 knots.

780
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,125
Select and turn towards
the force landing field.

781
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,375
Going towards the force landing field,
12 o’clock.

782
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,416
That's too easy.

783
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,875
Go for 8 o’clock.

784
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,833
Go for 8!

785
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:26,708
Fast!

786
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,666
Eagle 271 simulating engine failure.

787
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,833
Sector West.

788
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,583
You fly fairly well.
Why are your flying hours so low?

789
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:39,416
Sir…

790
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,958
If I tell you,
it'll seem like I'm making excuses.

791
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,625
Tomorrow onwards,
you won't miss a single sortie.

792
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,250
You’ll fly with me.

793
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,041
Don't celebrate just yet.

794
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,166
Why, sir?

795
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:01,125
You'll know tomorrow.

796
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,208
What are you staring at?

797
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,416
Give me the air-speed reading!

798
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Quick! ASI!

799
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,291
-100, sir.
-100-what, you duffer!

800
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,666
100 knots, sir.

801
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:13,291
-What’s the ground speed?
-110, sir.

802
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,958
-Lower the collective!
-Yes, sir.

803
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,166
-Bank to right!
-Yes, sir.

804
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:18,958
What about the rudder?

805
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,625
-Yes, sorry, sir.
-Raise the collective!

806
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,583
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

807
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,041
-Again, sorry!
-Sorry, sir.

808
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,375
Joker!

809
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:31,375
If you take care of the chopper,
the chopper will take care of you.

810
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:37,250
How do we land in a place
without a landing spot?

811
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,125
We don't land.

812
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,291
We hover.

813
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,250
-Take control.
-Yes, sir.

814
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:47,708
Focus, Gunjan.

815
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,291
Hold steady.

816
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:51,666
Maintain position.

817
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,041
Focus!

818
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,541
Focus. Right.

819
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,333
Maintain direction.

820
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,375
Focus, Gunjan!

821
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,083
Good.

822
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,333
Hold steady.

823
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,333
Hold steady.

824
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,083
Hold steady.

825
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:12,708
ASI.

826
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,250
Genny switch.

827
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,750
Fuel Shut Off Lever.
VSI.

828
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,833
Rotor brakes.

829
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,166
Altimeter.

830
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,333
Casualty evacuation in the Dras sector.
I'm sending Shekhar and Sandhu.

831
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:32,166
Instead of Sandhu, send Gunjan.

832
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,916
She knows this area better.

833
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,291
Nap of the earth flying.

834
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,791
Fly close to the ground.
Fly at high speed.

835
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:49,833
When the enemy is aiming at the sky…

836
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,083
Simple.

837
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,833
Stay on the ground,
and make him your target.

838
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:55,208
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

839
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,625
Gunjan, follow the river.

840
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,166
-Take control.
-Sir.

841
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,375
Focus, Gunjan.

842
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,291
Yes. Hold steady.

843
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,208
Hold.

844
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,541
Hold.

845
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,083
Focus.

846
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,791
Focus. Right, good.

847
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,166
Yeah, too good.

848
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:43,708
Madam approaching. Turn quickly.

849
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,833
Could you pass the vegetables?

850
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:13,291
This quarter's top performing pilot
is Gunjan.

851
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,333
Airborne for 127 hours.

852
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,875
She has earned a double promotion
to category C-White…

853
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:29,291
and has been cleared for all landings
at helipads above 15,000 feet.

854
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,125
In the next quarter,

855
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,875
Gunjan will lead formation flying sorties,
high-altitude flying briefings. Sit down.

856
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,791
Next in ranking is Shekhar.

857
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,875
119 hours.

858
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,750
Mohit, 102 hours.

859
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,166
How's training going, love?

860
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,541
-It's not going, Papa, it's soaring.
-Soar.

861
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,208
Papa, tomorrow's the first time
I'll lead a briefing.

862
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,208
Wow.

863
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,333
Well done, love.

864
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,375
All the best.

865
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:05,791
Where's Mohit?

866
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,541
-Sir, he's gone to the doctor.
-Why?

867
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,833
He's injured his knee.

868
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:11,375
-He was crying like a baby.
-Look over there.

869
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,458
CO sir's indulgence
is making "Madam" a "Sir."

870
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,375
If it keeps going this way,
we'll be taking orders from Madam soon.

871
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,791
Take my order for now.

872
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:27,541
Go get some nuggets. Hot and fresh.

873
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:30,666
If they're cold, you'll do
your sortie with Madam tomorrow.

874
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,958
-Sir…
-Don't forget the sauce.

875
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,583
-Green?
-Red.

876
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,125
I was banking a little to the right…

877
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,375
Told you.

878
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,791
Good morning, everyone.

879
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:10,375
I will be covering the briefing
for today's formation flying sortie

880
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,208
with the aim of taking off at 0900 hours.

881
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:16,250
We will walk towards the aircraft
at 0845 hours

882
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,500
and start up by 0855 hours.

883
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,833
Gunjan. Stop.

884
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:20,750
Shekhar.

885
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:21,750
Sir!

886
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,208
Excuse me.

887
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,541
Good morning.

888
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,583
The aircrafts allotted 
for today's formation: Hercules,

889
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,166
Zulu 1845,

890
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,291
and Zulu 2004.

891
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,916
Sir, is there a problem?

892
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,791
No. Shekhar, continue.

893
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,833
As I was saying,
crew composition for Hercules 1

894
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,125
-are Captain Monty, and co-pilot--
-Did I do something wrong?

895
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,791
Take your seat.
Sit down.

896
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,125
-Crew composition--
-Sir, it's my briefing.

897
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,250
Why is Shekhar doing it?

898
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,916
Don't disturb the briefing, Gunjan.

899
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,000
Shekhar, continue!

900
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:00,375
What's your problem with me, sir?

901
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,916
My sorties were canceled
and now my briefing.

902
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,083
-Officer!
-I'm just asking, sir.

903
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,125
If you have an answer, please tell me.

904
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,250
You want an answer?
Want to know what the problem is?

905
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,625
Shekhar! Come here!

906
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,375
Sit down.

907
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,375
Sit down!

908
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,458
Shekhar…

909
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,125
Start!

910
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,833
Go.

911
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,125
Again.

912
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:41,125
Go.

913
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:42,708
Again.

914
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,666
Go.

915
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,583
Again!

916
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,083
Again!

917
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:56,750
Go.

918
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,625
Again!

919
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,250
Again.

920
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,208
Again.

921
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:23,250
You're weak, Gunjan.
There's no place for weakness in Defense.

922
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:26,791
We want people who will shed blood,
not tears.

923
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:30,458
An innocent face and big eyes
do not change the enemy's mind.

924
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,666
You have to fight.

925
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,583
Our duty is to protect the country,

926
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:36,916
not to give you equal opportunity.
Understand?

927
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,583
Remember that the next time
you have a question.

928
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,416
Shekhar! Continue!

929
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,000
She wants answers!

930
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,250
Gunjan!

931
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,666
What the hell are you doing?

932
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:50,083
Have you gone mad?

933
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,083
Yes, I've gone mad.

934
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,875
In fact, I've been mad from the start.

935
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:01,541
I'm mad to think that if I work hard
and become a good pilot,

936
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,458
I can be a part of this unit.

937
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,666
It's not just me, my father's mad, too!

938
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,833
He always said gender doesn't matter
in a cockpit,

939
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:13,625
that men and women are both called pilots.
It's a lie! Papa's mad!

940
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:18,416
He didn't know I'd have to
arm-wrestle to prove my worth here.

941
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,541
I don't want to be a wrestler, sir.
I want to fly planes, not carry them.

942
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:23,791
Gunjan. Enough.

943
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,916
No, sir, today you listen.
I finally understand the problem.

944
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,375
The problem isn't my weakness,
it's your fear.

945
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,750
You are scared that
if this "Madam" becomes a "Sir,"

946
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,416
we'll have to salute her.

947
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,666
Right? And that'll be the end
of your masculinity.

948
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,625
Sir, respecting me will not mean
any less respect for you.

949
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:42,666
I promise!

950
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,666
Forget it, sir.

951
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,375
Congratulations on
your narrow-mindedness, your fear,

952
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,750
this party,

953
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:54,125
and your hollow male pride.

954
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,166
Jai Hind, sir.

955
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:36,500
I won't say another word…

956
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:40,041
To you

957
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:43,208
I'll let my heart break

958
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:47,666
And I still won't say a word

959
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:56,000
I won't say another word…

960
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,791
To you

961
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,458
I'll let my heart break

962
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,375
And I still won't say a word

963
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:09,416
Those bonds we tied together…

964
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,500
My love

965
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:29,666
Those bonds are now broken, broken, broken

966
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:35,166
Those bonds are now broken

967
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:42,458
Our ties are broken, broken, broken

968
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:47,875
These bonds are broken

969
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:08,791
These bonds are broken

970
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:19,208
Our ties are broken

971
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:25,916
These bonds are broken

972
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:27,708
Gunju…

973
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,541
You can't keep sitting around like this.

974
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:33,208
Go out. Meet your friends.

975
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,583
You're attending Mannu's wedding?

976
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:37,833
Come on.

977
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:43,375
I'm… taking this one out.

978
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,416
Quickly, get ready and come. Hmm?

979
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,208
Gunju, get ready.
It's a celebration, it'll be fun.

980
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:08,458
Gunju! Hi!

981
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:09,583
Aunty!

982
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,416
Gunju!

983
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:16,208
When did you come? How are you?
Are you on leave for my wedding?

984
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:22,583
That's why I left and came home.

985
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,833
Same story with me.

986
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:29,333
I went to Mumbai with my makeup kit
and my dreams to be a lead actress.

987
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:33,250
For six months, I danced
behind the actresses as an extra.

988
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:37,291
Thousands of auditions.
Mother, sister, aunt, daughter.

989
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,250
I auditioned for them all.
But what came of it?

990
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:43,291
I left with a bundle of hope,
came back with a truckload of tears.

991
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,833
So, I closed the chapter.

992
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:49,083
How long could I keep chasing dreams?

993
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:55,208
But now, I'm starting a new chapter.
Maybe I'll find happiness in this one.

994
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:59,250
So what if I couldn't be Madhuri?
At least I look like her.

995
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,708
Forget about this.
Let's dance. I'll play your favorite song.

996
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,625
-Come on.
-Go ahead, I'll follow.

997
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:53,791
This letter came for you.

998
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:24,708
I'm thinking of quitting the Air Force…

999
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:26,625
and settling down.

1000
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:31,000
Settle?

1001
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Marriage.

1002
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:39,000
Mannu looked so happy today.

1003
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,750
Maybe I should get married, too.

1004
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:49,833
Yes, love.

1005
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,083
You must get married.

1006
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:55,458
My clothes are ready.

1007
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:58,791
Just tell me when, and I'll be there
to give you away.

1008
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,375
-Why are you saying such things?
-No, I'm happy.

1009
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:07,750
My daughter wants to give up her career
and make parathas.

1010
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,750
Come, love… let's go make parathas.

1011
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,000
Come.

1012
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,666
Come. Come on.

1013
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:22,791
Come.

1014
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:28,166
These are potatoes.

1015
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:30,708
This is flour.

1016
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,625
Come on. Boil the potatoes.

1017
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,166
Don't you know how to?

1018
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,041
How will my daughter manage?

1019
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,541
Wait, let me show you the spices.
This is cumin.

1020
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,833
This is turmeric.

1021
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,625
What is this?

1022
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Don't you know?

1023
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,875
My daughter hasn't heard
of cilantro powder?

1024
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:57,291
-I'll show you the asafetida.
-Papa, what are you saying?

1025
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,333
You didn't understand?

1026
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:06,083
You're about to do exactly
what this world expects from girls.

1027
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,416
Give up your dreams and settle down.

1028
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,625
I wanted your mother to…

1029
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,541
but she did exactly what
she's always seen and learned.

1030
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:23,250
That's why we never taught you anything
that would hamper your progress.

1031
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:27,375
What does your brother think?
That I don't know…

1032
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:30,375
how difficult the world is for women?

1033
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:36,458
The solution isn't to
shut yourself in a cage,

1034
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:39,416
but to break free of the cage and fly.

1035
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,333
I always had faith…

1036
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,916
that no one can stop
my daughter from flying.

1037
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:51,125
But now she's asking me to clip her wings.

1038
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,500
She wants the ring and the white dress.

1039
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:56,791
You wanting to get married…

1040
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:01,583
is not just you…
but both of us losing.

1041
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:55,208
Jai Hind, sir.

1042
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:06,916
I'm sorry, sir.

1043
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,250
-I shouldn't have left like that.
-You're going to Kargil.

1044
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:15,750
We are at war.

1045
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:17,500
The Air Force has been activated.

1046
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,125
Tomorrow onwards, you'll be
operating out of the Srinagar base.

1047
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:27,625
The country needs
its best pilots right now.

1048
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:31,333
Jai Hind.

1049
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,125
Jai Hind, sir.

1050
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:49,250
Papa?

1051
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,875
I have to go somewhere for a few days.

1052
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:55,458
I can't tell you where I'm going.

1053
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,583
I just wanted to say one thing, Papa.

1054
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:07,208
I'll never let you lose.

1055
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:19,208
Jai Hind.

1056
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:20,958
Jai Hind.

1057
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,916
-Good morning, sir.
-Jai Hind, sir.

1058
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,125
Good morning, sir.

1059
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:50,458
Thank you, sir.

1060
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,000
-Morning, everyone!
-Morning, sir!

1061
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,625
We already know the enemy
has infiltrated through the LOC

1062
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,625
and entered Kargil.
Their location is impossible to tell

1063
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:01,666
because of the altitude
at which they are hiding.

1064
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,625
That's why we are here.

1065
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,541
We have two duties in this war.

1066
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,583
First: recce sorties.

1067
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:11,375
We have to fly over Kargil Valley
and identify the locations of the enemy,

1068
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,791
so our fighter pilots can terminate them.

1069
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,791
Our second duty: rescue missions.

1070
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,458
Whenever, wherever we are required,

1071
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:22,541
we will have to carry out
casualty evacuations.

1072
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,250
All of you must be ready.

1073
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,666
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir!

1074
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,125
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir!

1075
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,916
-Jai Hind!
-Jai Hind, sir!

1076
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:40,000
Hello?

1077
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:47,250
Twenty-eight years later,
we are back at war with Pakistan.

1078
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:51,291
This time, the war is being fought
above Srinagar in the Kargil Valley,

1079
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:55,708
where several Pakistani infiltrators
are hiding.

1080
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,875
The Prime Minister has
ensured total vigilance

1081
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,541
in the security of the nation.

1082
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:02,250
The world knows we want peace.

1083
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:09,416
Now the world will see our strength
in maintaining that peace.

1084
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,833
The Army has incorporated
the help of the Air Force.

1085
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:13,750
Gunju?

1086
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:17,916
Anshu, as well?

1087
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:23,208
Gunju, why can't you understand?

1088
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,333
This is a bloody war zone.

1089
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,208
Bullets everywhere, people are dying.

1090
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:28,500
One sure shot on your chopper and…

1091
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:34,000
-Dada, I'm just doing my duty.
-What about Mummy and Papa?

1092
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:37,791
I have a sortie, dada. I have to go.

1093
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:39,416
Gunju, I'm talking to you.

1094
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:44,708
Gunjan!

1095
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:10,791
I won't always be there to save you.

1096
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:23,083
The war between the two countries
is becoming more tense.

1097
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:27,166
We are hearing reports from Mushkoh Valley
of attacks on the Indian forward post.

1098
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,583
Many soldiers are feared to be injured.

1099
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:32,958
Hawk-2, Hawk-1.

1100
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:36,541
Eagle, look out for Pakistani camps
and report back to base.

1101
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:37,500
Copied, sir.

1102
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,791
I can see a small enemy camp.

1103
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,750
Inform base immediately.

1104
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,166
Flash!

1105
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:18,625
Eagle, Hawk-2!

1106
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:19,541
Eagle, Hawk-2!

1107
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,458
Hawk-2, Eagle. Go ahead.

1108
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:22,750
Hawk-1, down, Kilo Valley!

1109
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:26,083
Coordinates are 345681 and 716373!

1110
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,833
Descending in the valley
to look for pilots!

1111
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,958
Hawk-2, abort mission
and return back to base at once!

1112
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,666
-But, sir…
-Very high risk!

1113
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,750
I repeat, very high risk!

1114
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,708
Abort and return!

1115
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,000
Copied, sir.

1116
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:48,791
The first chopper went down
in this attack,

1117
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:51,666
and both pilots were taken hostage.

1118
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:54,750
However, the second chopper
managed to escape.

1119
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:57,958
This chopper was being flown
by a lady pilot.

1120
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:02,541
Along with the Army, the enemy has set
their sights on the Air Force, as well.

1121
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,375
The missile attack
on the Indian chopper…

1122
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:05,958
Anup, are you listening to this?

1123
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,666
How could you send both your kids
out to fight the war?

1124
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:16,166
If everyone starts thinking like you,
who will protect the country?

1125
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:19,458
What if the lady pilot
had not evaded the missile?

1126
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:23,375
What if the lady pilot
was taken prisoner of war?

1127
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:27,375
We all know how the enemy
treats their prisoners of war,

1128
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:31,500
and we don't want a daughter of India
to be tortured.

1129
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:34,166
Are we running short of men
that we need to call upon women?

1130
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,541
Does Indian Defense want
to make the country proud or…

1131
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,958
The issue of your safety
has become national news.

1132
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:43,583
Our priority is to protect the country,
not you.

1133
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:48,375
We don't need the added pressure, Gunjan.
You're going back to Udhampur.

1134
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,000
-But sir--
-Dileep is right.

1135
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,916
Get ready to leave. Dileep.

1136
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:53,958
Yes, sir.

1137
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:06,000
I know you're not happy, Gunju,

1138
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:09,166
but everyone here is under pressure.
Try and understand.

1139
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,958
What should I understand, dada?

1140
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:14,791
All I know is
I'm here because of my ability.

1141
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,916
Shouldn't my ability decide if I can stay?

1142
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,208
That's how you think, Gunju,
not the world.

1143
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:25,125
The world won't change how it thinks.

1144
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,583
Forget the world, dada.

1145
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:32,875
Change yourself.
Maybe you'll inspire the world to change.

1146
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,250
I'm going to go.

1147
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:43,333
Take care of yourself.

1148
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:10,958
Section, take cover!

1149
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:15,083
-Fire ahead! Two o'clock!
-They're firing from the front!

1150
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:16,750
-Take your positions.
-Take cover.

1151
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,708
Biswa, take positions.

1152
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:30,708
Sir, we've got you.

1153
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:33,000
Get the first aid kit.

1154
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,833
Wing Commander Singh,
there's an emergency evacuation.

1155
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:40,708
We have 30 minutes.
Prepare your chopper. Over.

1156
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,041
Pick-up coordinates?

1157
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,833
Kilo valley. South of Tololing.

1158
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:48,125
Closest helipad at GR12344323.
Over.

1159
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:52,041
Copied. Chopper for CASEVAC
will be airborne in seven minutes.

1160
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,250
It's an emergency CASEVAC.
Get two choppers ready.

1161
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:57,041
All the pilots are out on their missions.
Who's going to go?

1162
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:03,166
The battalion is ready to back down,
but a soldier is badly injured.

1163
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,708
-We have 30 minutes to save him.
-What's the plan?

1164
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:06,833
We'll send two choppers.

1165
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,708
I'll be in the lead chopper
for the CASEVAC.

1166
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,083
Signal is poor in the valley,

1167
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,583
so we'll use the follow chopper
to communicate with base.

1168
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,958
-Location of the casualty?
-Sir, it's here.

1169
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Kilo valley. South of Tololing.

1170
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:20,250
The area is no longer hostile, sir…

1171
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:22,041
-But there's a problem.
-Which is?

1172
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:25,791
All our pilots are on sorties,
far away from the casualty.

1173
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:27,625
There's no pilot
for the follow chopper.

1174
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,791
Sir… I have only one option.

1175
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:18,416
-Have you seen Gunjan?
-She's gone.

1176
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,583
-Udhampur?
-No, she's on a mission.

1177
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,791
Hawk-2 from 1.
Five kilometers from landing zone.

1178
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:27,000
Heading northeast.

1179
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:28,250
Copied, sir.

1180
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,583
Hawk-2 from 1.
Approaching extraction point.

1181
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:53,083
Sir, they're not on the radar anymore.

1182
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:55,041
Hawk-2 from 1.
Looking for casualty.

1183
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,041
Confirmed.

1184
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,375
Hawk-2 from 1.

1185
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:09,833
Spotted casualty.

1186
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,583
-Going for pick-up.
-Copied, sir.

1187
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,208
Go to the ridge at 12 o'clock.

1188
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,583
Maintain height and continue orbiting
till further instructions.

1189
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:17,916
Copied, sir.

1190
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:28,875
Landing zone clear.

1191
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,250
Hawk-2 in position behind the ridge.

1192
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,625
The valley is clear.

1193
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:48,041
Going in to land.

1194
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:50,333
Will be airborne with casualty
in next 01 minute.

1195
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:01,083
Hawk-1, enemy movement in the valley.

1196
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,291
Hawk-1, come in!

1197
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,875
Hawk-1, come in!

1198
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:14,333
Hawk-1, you are in line of fire!

1199
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,625
Hawk-1, you are in line of fire!

1200
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:21,500
Hawk-1, come in!

1201
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,666
-Hawk-2? Eagle!
-Crossing over for visual contact!

1202
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:41,083
Hawk-2, come in!

1203
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:42,875
Do you read me, Hawk-2?

1204
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,875
Hawk-2, do you read me? Come in!

1205
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,333
Hawk-2?

1206
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:55,625
Do you read me, Hawk-2?

1207
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,375
-Hawk-2?
-Eagle? Hawk-2!

1208
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,750
-Go ahead!
-Hawk-1 down! Hawk-1 down!

1209
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,083
Hawk-2, what is your location?

1210
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:05,041
Sir, we are behind the ridge.
Going in for the pick-up.

1211
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:06,166
Hawk-2, retreat!

1212
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,708
Negative, sir. There are three officers.
We can help them.

1213
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:11,166
Very high risk!
Abort, and return back to base!

1214
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,375
-Sir, but--
-No, Gunjan!

1215
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:14,541
Return back to base at once.
It's very risky!

1216
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,458
You won't be able to do it, Gunjan.

1217
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:24,000
You're weak, Gunjan.
There's no place for weakness in Defense.

1218
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:27,583
I can't change the way
the world thinks, but I can tell you.

1219
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:29,916
Come in, Hawk-2! Do you read me?

1220
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,708
The solution isn't to
shut yourself in a cage,

1221
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:37,500
but to break free of the cage and fly.

1222
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,333
Come in, Hawk-2!

1223
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:41,500
Come in, Hawk-2!

1224
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:47,000
Come in, Hawk-2!
Do you read me?

1225
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:50,000
Sir, I think the signal is lost.

1226
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:52,083
-Keep trying.
-Yes, sir.

1227
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,166
Hawk-2?

1228
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:56,291
Do you read me?

1229
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,625
Pick up your gun.

1230
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:23,875
Fire!

1231
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,916
Hawk-2! Do you read me?

1232
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:50,625
Do you read me, Hawk-2?

1233
01:35:51,916 --> 01:35:53,000
Sir, no response.

1234
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,458
Are they on the radar?

1235
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:56,875
No, sir.

1236
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,041
Keep trying.

1237
01:35:58,125 --> 01:35:58,958
Yes, sir.

1238
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,416
Hawk-2! Do you read me?

1239
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:16,750
Flash! 7 o'clock!

1240
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,791
Do you read me, Hawk-2?

1241
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:29,833
Sir, it's been 20 minutes.

1242
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:31,041
No response.

1243
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,375
Keep trying.

1244
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,291
Yes, sir.

1245
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:36,916
Hawk-2?

1246
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,083
Come in, Hawk-2.

1247
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:42,958
Come in, Hawk-2.

1248
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,708
Give me the injections.

1249
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:39,125
Gunjan.

1250
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:03,750
Again.

1251
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,125
Ma'am, wait outside, please.

1252
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:33,083
Didn't I tell you
I won't always be there to save you?

1253
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,666
But I know that whenever I need it,

1254
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:41,166
you'll always save me.

1255
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,458
Jai Hind, Officer Saxena.

1256
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:52,541
Gunjan!

1257
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,583
I will lay my heart down for you

1258
01:41:59,666 --> 01:42:03,083
My dearest one

1259
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:05,916
I bow before only you

1260
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,958
My dearest one

1261
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:16,041
Nothing I can offer you
Could ever be enough

1262
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:20,750
You're the best in all the lands

1263
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:23,750
The daughter of India

1264
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:26,583
Your light shines in all the lands

1265
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:29,416

May you shine forever

1270
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:56,958
We share every tear

1271
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:59,375
That you've ever shed

1272
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,125
Our anthem will always be

1273
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:06,708
Any song you sing

1274
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:11,916
You do us proud every day

1275
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:14,416
When you fearlessly forge ahead

1276
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,583
Make your rules, live your life

1277
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:20,958
We're always by your side

1278
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:23,958
Your every hope and dream

1279
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:27,250
We will make our own

1280
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:34,250
It's your turn…
Make your dreams come true

1281
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:38,916
You're the best in all the lands

1282
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,041

May you shine… forever

1307
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:54,666
Boys! Are you ready?

1308
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:57,458
Boys! A storm is coming!

1309
01:45:57,541 --> 01:46:01,833
Don't waste your ego on her
She'll walk all over it!

1310
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:04,250
Boys! Don't mess with her

1311
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:07,083
Stay out of her way

1312
01:46:07,166 --> 01:46:09,166
Don't waste time
Showing her your manliness

1313
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,416
She'll walk all over it

1314
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:17,000
Boom!
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1315
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:21,416
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1316
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:26,583
She stole my heart
In the blink of an eye

1317
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:31,166
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1318
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:52,666
Let the mountains shake

1319
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:55,041
Let the sky fall down

1320
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:59,833
These girls are never backing down!

1321
01:46:59,916 --> 01:47:02,250
Quietly, she'll come

1322
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:04,625
And create magic!

1323
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:09,083
She breathes the magic of tomorrow
Into today!

1324
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:11,458
Oh, India
Rejoice, revel!

1325
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:14,208
Our girls are the best of the best!

1326
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:18,666
On their shoulders
Our flag flies high and mighty!

1327
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,041
Oh, India
Let's paint the town red…

1328
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:23,875
And light the sky with fireworks!

1329
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:28,166
Because these girls will fly our flag
High and mighty!

1330
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:33,791
Boom!
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1331
01:47:33,875 --> 01:47:38,583
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1332
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:43,041
She stole my heart
In the blink of an eye

1333
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:47,833
She stole my heart
In the blink of an eye

1334
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:10,750
Boom!
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1335
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,166
She's a firecracker!

1336
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:16,666
Watch out! She's a firecracker!

1337
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:19,208
She stole my heart
In the blink of an eye

1338
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:21,791
She stole my heart

1339
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:24,666
Watch out!

1340
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,125
She's a firecracker!

1341
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:31,458
Boom!

1342
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,625
You gotta fly, fly, fly

1343
01:48:58,708 --> 01:49:02,208
Don't be scared, don't you worry

1344
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:06,041
Grab a piece of ground
And just go, go, go

1345
01:49:09,625 --> 01:49:11,333
You gotta soar, soar, soar

1346
01:49:11,416 --> 01:49:14,916
Don't you slow down
Don't you stop

1347
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,291
Tell your life
You make the rules

1348
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:22,125
Take a leap!

1349
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:23,750
Touch the moon!

1350
01:49:23,833 --> 01:49:29,125
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

1351
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:36,583
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

1352
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:40,041
Let your light shine so bright

1353
01:49:40,125 --> 01:49:41,750
That before your fate is sealed

1354
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:43,208
The Lord himself stops and asks…

1355
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:45,375
"What is it you want, child?"

1356
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:47,291
Let your light shine so bright

1357
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:49,000
That before your fate is sealed

1358
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:50,625
The Lord himself stops and asks…

1359
01:49:50,708 --> 01:49:52,791
"What is it you want, child?"

1360
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:13,041
Burst through those barriers!

1361
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:16,583
Don't let your doubts hold you back!

1362
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,458
Burst through those barriers!

1363
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:21,041
Don't let your doubts hold you back!

1364
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh, stand, fight
And don't back down!

1365
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,666
Let go of the old!

1366
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,208
Just let go of the old!

1367
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:40,458
Oh, stand, fight
And don't back down!

1368
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:44,416
You gotta fly, fly, fly

1369
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,125
Don't you stop, don't give up

1370
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:52,583
You were made for the skies
Not the earth!

1371
01:50:55,041 --> 01:50:56,791
You gotta fly, fly, fly

1372
01:50:56,875 --> 01:51:00,625
Don't you stop, don't you look back!

1373
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:04,500
Just follow your heart

1374
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:07,583
Take a leap!

1375
01:51:07,666 --> 01:51:09,375
Touch the moon!

1376
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:14,833
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

1377
01:51:16,666 --> 01:51:22,083
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

1378
01:51:23,541 --> 01:51:26,500
Just fly, fly, fly

1379
01:51:30,625 --> 01:51:36,291
Just fly, fly, fly
Like a free bird!

1380
01:51:37,208 --> 01:51:41,083
Like a free bird!

1381
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:47,208
Let your light shine so bright

1382
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,833
That before your fate is sealed

1383
01:51:48,916 --> 01:51:50,791
The Lord himself stops and asks…

1384
01:51:50,875 --> 01:51:52,416
"What is it you want, child?"

1385
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,291
Let your light shine so bright

1386
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:56,000
That before your fate is sealed

1387
01:51:56,083 --> 01:51:57,916
The Lord himself stops and asks…

1388
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
"What is it you want, child?"
