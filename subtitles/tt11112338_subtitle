1
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,662
In America's colonial history,

2
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:14,501
9/11 is a day that can never be forgotten.

3
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,503
We realize that this historic day

4
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,872
depicts more than the fall  
 of the World Trade Center.

5
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,874
It was a trigger

6
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,412
for America's neo-invasionist policy.

7
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:31,485
The dance of neo-imperialism  
 has displayed its evil fangs.

8
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,620
As I speak,

9
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,957
statistics make it evident  
 that 75 countries

10
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:42,496
are clearly being subject  
 to various forms of imperialism.

11
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:48,235
From South Dakota in 1890 to Iraq in 2003,

12
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,871
one hundred and thirty-five countries  
 have been invaded

13
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,372
-by America and exploitation...  
-Stop right there.

14
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,374
Over here,

15
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,912
insert photos of America bombing 
some places.

16
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:06,253
Let's go eat some mutta bomb  
and continue after?

17
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:08,789
Raheem Sahib...

18
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,892
shouldn't we be editing a movie?

19
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,627
How long will we keep editing speeches?

20
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,832
Don't you know 
how we pushed things this far?

21
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,168
As we belong 
to a progressive social organization,

22
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,402
shouldn't we naturally flourish?

23
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,005
Shaheel,

24
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,708
let me tell you...

25
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,411
Our social organization is like a bus 
on a downhill drive.

26
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,349
We can't maneuver 
the hairpin bends hastily.

27
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,584
One may have to stop,

28
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,453
maybe back up a little,

29
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,290
and carefully turn it around 
to reach the bottom of the hill.

30
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,292
I hope we reach downhill.

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,163
Shaheel, do you have any good movie 
that kids can watch?

32
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,833
Not cartoons, but a real movie.

33
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,204
I believe you must have already watchedMessage and Lion of the desert?

34
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,372
Yeah! Several times.

35
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,874
Not those type of movies. 
I want an entertaining movie.

36
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,877
Beyond the usual songs, dance and fights.

37
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,946
Not lovers running around trees, 
not men beating each other up.

38
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,282
Then I think you must watch 
this Iranian movie.

39
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,417
Children of Heaven.  
You must watch it.

40
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,919
Will you copy it for me on a disk?

41
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,130
"The most beautiful one!"

42
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:28,168
"Glory and praise be yours, Allah!"

43
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,710

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,586

47
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,788
"Logos of our ears"

48
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,290
"Perfection of this world"

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,695
"The sweet fragrance of a flower 
Swaying in breeze"

50
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,131
"The most beautiful one!"

51
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:03,203

00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,709
Where can I get some water to drink?

67
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,913
Who dried my undying well?

68
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,084
Where can I get some water to drink?"

69
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,289
If you are going to ask 
for water in this manner,

70
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,291
the village folk 
will throw you into a well.

71
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,626
And you will end up drinking water there.

72
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,164
Our message should penetrate the hearts 
of people like resounding thunder.

We perform on the streets.

74
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,203
Here's your drinking water, drink up, 
and then go to sleep.

75
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,371
Don't you have to leave tomorrow?

76
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,664
HAVE YOU BEEN GOOD TO YOUR PARENTS?

77
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,599
HAVE YOU BEEN KIND TO YOUR NEIGHBORS?

78
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,668
HAVE YOU BEEN FAIR IN YOUR BUSINESS TODAY?

79
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,503
HAVE YOU FULFILLED YOUR DUTIES 
TOWARDS YOUR WIFE?

80
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,672
HAVE YOU BEEN JUST TO YOUR CHILDREN?

81
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,307
Did the children perform Isha prayers?

82
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,541
Yes.

83
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,249
I have to reach there 
in time for morning prayer.

84
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,917
Will you wake me up?

85
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,119
Shall I blast a loud cracker?

86
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,955
Might need it.

93
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,957
Are you okay?

94
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,792
No, I am alright!

95
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,161
-Can I get some white flour? 
-Flour?

96
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,831
-Do you want some water to drink? 
-Uh, no.

97
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,667
[hisses] Bring me some hot water too.

98
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,169
Sure!

99
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,746
You know, I have done a good deed today.

100
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,748
Gratitude to Almighty Allah.

101
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,683
Now I am wondering if it's a bad deed.

102
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,484
PREETHI CINEMAS  
 "DARLING"

103
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,919
Oh, Lord, forgive me!

104
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:16,123
Can't believe our people have 
to keep looking at this haraam poster.

105
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,625
There's nothing halal  
in this town to watch.

106
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,994
Even you tried so hard 
to make a halal movie.

107
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,663
Nothing ever worked out.

108
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:23,830
You know...

109
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,667
Our organization 
and our religious community...

110
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,836
You keep saying 
it's a downhill bus ride.

111
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,039
Why don't you get off that bus 
and try walking?

112
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,042
If the bus passes by again,

113
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,044
wave and get back in.

114
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,081
History shows that a sheep 
out of the flock will be hunted first.

115
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,119
Yes... There are people 
suitable for this job in my bus itself.

116
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,288
Let me try again.

117
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,623
-Inshallah.  
-Inshallah.

118
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,959
I am with this! Are you?

119
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,661
[all singing]Who are we going to stand with?

120
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,631
Who are you going to stand with?

121
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:02,669
Who are we going to stand with?  
 Who are you going to stand with?

122
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:07,875
Who are we going to stand with?  
 Who are you going to stand with?

123
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:13,380
Who are we going to stand with?  
 Who are you going to stand with?

124
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,251
Dear people, Kerala is rich  
 in its water sources,

125
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,919
its water reservoirs...

126
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,254
Our very renowned--

127
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,089
I often think...

128
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,124
...God's own country.

129
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:29,329
Our talent is whiling away 
in street plays and theater.

130
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,498
We can't act in movies

131
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,901
because we don't have movies 
that suit our beliefs.

132
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,871
Raheem Sahib, you will answer 
to Allah one day

133
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,373
for letting my talent go to waste.

134
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,241
-Me? 
-Yes, you!

135
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,411
Competent people like you 
are not giving us opportunities.

136
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,747
How can I bring change alone?

137
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,916
Shereef, how many people

138
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,752
in our art committee 
will be ready to make a movie?

139
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,120
Hmm...

140
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,822
We need righteous and talentedMu'min artists and performers.

141
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,792
Talent alone will not do.

142
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,994
He has to be efficient.

143
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,996
Someone that our organization can trust.

144
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,031
You and I don't enjoy that trust.

145
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,366
You are right. We do not.

146
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,872
[both] Thoufeeq!

147
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,709
Orator, author, prolific organizer.

148
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,245
Scholar, young, trustworthy.

149
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,580
A promising person.

150
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,349
Pious Muslim man,

151
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,153
twenty-eight-years-old,  
 5 feet 8 inch tall,

152
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,656
pleasing and good looking.

153
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,492
Postgraduate in Malayalam language.

154
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,363
Postgraduate in Malayalam language.

155
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,498
Soliciting marriage proposals

156
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,370
from artistic and pious 
young Muslim girls.

157
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,375
[vocalizing]

158
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,079
I heard this on the bus. 
Can't get it out of my head.

159
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,414
Are you sure you heard 
the song in the bus?

160
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,616
You have to wait a bit longer.

161
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,085
He says he will come after 
the 59th minute.

162
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,821
Why the 59th minute? 
Why not the entire 60 minutes?

163
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,456
He is playing a movie in class.

164
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,391
A movie?

165
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,621
Thoufeeq Sahib!

166
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,163
[children laughing]

167
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,041
Raheem Sahib, I can't believe 
we are discussing this again.

168
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,543
How much did I chase you 
to do a movie project?

169
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,245
Remember what you told me then?

170
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,948
"We are not yet ready 
and our organization have limitations."

171
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,417
Thoufeeq, now we are ready.

172
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,085
However, we have certain constraints.

173
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,120
There is no lack of constraints.

174
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,088
Thoufeeq Sahib,

175
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,123
this may not be an easy job,

176
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,792
but neither is it impossible.

177
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,163
We will do it.

178
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,298
Surely!

179
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,334
Am I the problem?

180
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,836
You have to remove the thought

181
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,238
that this is not possible 
within our organization.

182
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,039
Okay, done. Now what?

183
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,141
-Now... 
-Now we move on to the next step.

184
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,877
Thoufeeq, you come with your best script

185
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,913
and let's call an emergency meeting 
of the arts wing.

186
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,281
Then let's get the approval.

187
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,417
We will write a heart-wrenching 
recommendation to our leadership.

188
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:41,154
To lead this project, we need a smart, 
trustworthy and efficient person.

189
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,489
Thoufeeq, you are that person.

190
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,796
Here is the concise form of the script.

191
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,833
Many here have already read this.

192
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,334
Here is the thing,

193
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,703
we can't make a big budget movie.

194
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,040
Let's make a one hour-long tele-cinema.

195
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,044
The producers at Malayalam Channel  
have agreed to telecast it on Eid al-Adha.

196
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:08,081
We have found an apt director also.

197
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,917
By the way, 
all these are open for discussion.

198
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,453
What I want to share is, 
that we are ready with everything.

199
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,124
Sahib, on agendas like this,

200
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,127
our committee here does not have 
the power to make final decisions.

201
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:25,332
A project like this 
needs money and people.

202
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,735
Therefore, we need complete support 
from our parent organization,

203
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,704
without that it would be difficult 
to move forward.

204
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,541
Why not send a recommendation letter 
to the leadership?

205
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,211
Well, yeah, we can do that, however, 
this committee needs to approve first.

206
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,080
Let's discuss. 
What is your opinion about this idea?

207
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,915
-Yes. 
-We are open to it.

208
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,285
-Who will direct this movie? 
-Thoufeeq knows a person.

209
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,487
If we approve the proposal today,

210
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,956
our next step will be 
to meet the director.

211
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,791
-Does he have experience? 
-He does.

212
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:54,328
He has worked as associate director 
in the industry for more than 15 years.

213
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,495
What's his name?

214
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,331
Siraj. He is from Thriprayar.

215
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,532
Wouldn't it be better to get a director

216
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,834
"'acceptable for entire public?"

217
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:05,038
Siraj is a mainstream movie maker. 
He has worked with renowned directors.

218
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,141
-That's not what he meant. 
-I will explain.

219
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,611
Thoufeeq Sahib, for example,

220
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,745
Sashi,

221
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,614
Shaji, Joshy,

222
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,615
Satyan,

223
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:18,418
Fazil... No, not Fazil. 
I meant, Thampi Annanthanam.

224
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,455
Likewise, somebody who has 
wide "acceptance in public."

225
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:26,827
Although his name is Siraj, 
he is "acceptable for public"

226
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,195
Thoufeeq, what we mean is,

227
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,830
as members of a plural society,

228
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,366
the intentions of this project 
would be...ideal

229
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,667
if the director 
is "acceptable for the public."

230
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:37,171
Siraj does not offer namaz.  
That itself is semi-acceptable.

231
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:41,475
Also, he sufficiently smokes and drinks.

232
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,377
In entirety, 
he is "acceptable for the public"

233
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,747
Let's momentarily pause this discussion.

234
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:51,618
If all of us are ready to go ahead 
with this idea,

235
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,120
as the first step,

236
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,423
to prepare the recommendation 
and take this project forward

237
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,792
let's appoint Thoufeeq

238
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,029
and Raheem Sahib to assist him.

239
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,497
What is your opinion?

240
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,965
-It's a good idea. 
-We agree!

241
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:05,999
[all] Allahu Akbar!

242
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:10,037
Since we have arrived at a decision, 
let's conclude this meeting.

243
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,207
I hereby invite Nuaiman Sahib 
to deliver the official vote of thanks.

244
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,043
-You do it. 
-No, you have to do it!

245
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,652
[speaking in Urdu]

246
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,622
What is permissible is very clear,

247
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,458
and what is forbidden, too, is very clear.

248
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,494
Between the two, is an ambiguous area,

249
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,164
albeit a risky area.

250
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,167
What allows us to enter this gray area 
is our intention towards God.

251
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,502
As you already know,

252
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,706
every action is accepted by God 
based on our intention.

253
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,209
Ya Allah, please guide our intentions 
in the right direction.

254
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,210
Ameen!

255
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,715
May He reunite us all 
in Jannat Ul-Firdaus.

256
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,416
-and bless us all.-Ameen!

257
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,288
[upbeat music playing]

258
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,656
-My dear, Thoufeeq. 
-Yes

259
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,326
-What if we end up dying in this bar! 
-Raheem Sahib!

260
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,329
Look for him.

261
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:17,905
Hello?

262
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:19,740
Is anyone around?

263
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,209
Come here.

264
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,284
Where the hell were you?

265
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,453
One beer, right? 
I need one beer and one small.

266
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,155
Dear, Lord!

267
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,291
Biju asked us to come see you.

268
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,659
Ah!

269
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,994
I am sorry. Please sit.

270
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,865
What would you like to drink?

271
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,901
-They also serve juice or cola here. 
-Nothing.

272
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,570
One beer and one small.

273
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,540
Now tell me, what's your movie about?

274
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,943
The movie is titled 
"Moonamathum Umma."

275
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,112
Is it a romantic movie?

276
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,114
No.

277
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,082
"Umma" as in "mother".

278
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,585
Let me explain the context.

279
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,787
Once a follower 
of the Prophet Muhammed...

280
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,155
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.

281
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:11,992
...approached him.

282
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:17,331
He asked, "Dear, Prophet, 
to whom do I owe the best deeds to?"

283
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,499
The Prophet answered, "Your mother".

284
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,336
He asked again, 
still the answer was "Your mother."

285
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,071
And the third time,

286
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,907
again Prophet answered, "Your mother."

287
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,879
It is only the fourth time 
that the Prophet answered, "Your father."

288
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,914
This is the message of our movie.

289
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,952
Nice message.

290
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,490
It might however be good 
to change the title of the movie.

291
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,326
Sure, we can think about it.

292
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,495
Mister, what would it cost 
to make this movie?

293
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,168
How can we estimate the budget 
without looking at the script?

294
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,038
But could you tell us 
an approximate cost?

295
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,339
Brother!

296
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,242
We can't estimate the cost 
without reading the script.

297
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:07,748
We can't just weigh the script 
and tell you the budget.

298
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,951
In times like these when Islam and Muslims 
are being misunderstood across the globe,

299
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,486
this movie is important.

300
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,289
Yes, I understand that it is relevant.

301
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,125
Let's see.

302
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,860
Allow us to go over it once,

303
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,996
-and then we will let you know. 
-Okay.

304
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,500
Inshallah.

305
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,168
-Inshallah.  
 -Okay, see you.

306
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,538
Okay, see you.

307
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,373
See you.

308
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,415
Sounds like a joke.

309
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,750
They're nice folks.

310
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,419
"Moonamathum Umma."

311
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,455
Let's give them a high budget 
and get rid of them.

312
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,457
Don't just get rid of them like that.

313
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,792
Let's take whatever is on offer.

314
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,661
These religious guys 
have tons of Gulf money.

315
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,864
What about my movie? 
When will we do it?

316
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,833
It's been eight months now 
talking about your movie.

317
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,568
No work, no money...

318
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,537
Here, hand me the script.

319
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,541
Looks like this will be 
a ten days shoot.

320
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,910
I will chart this for you for eight days.

321
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,283
In that case, let's read it once.

322
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,157
[man speaking over speakers]

323
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,027
The vultures who trade in arms 
for the total destruction of the world,

324
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:33,066
together we pledge for the children 
of Iraq shattered by war.

325
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,837
Let us boycott the products 
of the monopoly empire.

"In a stream of blood..."

329
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:48,582
Thoufeeq, we have received a circular.

330
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,918
However, there is a condition.

331
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,252
What condition?

332
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,287
"This is Baghdad"

333
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:58,959
"The same Baghdad from an old tale 
That my mother once told me"

334
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,295
"This is Baghdad"

with our movie?

00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:46,540
the Arts Committee has to raise the funds 
for this project independently."

351
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,410
"A recommendation letter to aid 
with the fund-raising

352
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,112
is attached herewith."

353
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,750
"May God help us realize all our dreams. 
Our prayers are with you."

354
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,951
Ameen!

355
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,487
"Yours sincerely, Secretary."

356
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:03,724
That means all we have is this letter 
and their moral support.

357
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,526
We have to get this going on our own.

358
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,160
How the hell is this gonna work?

359
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:12,432
Do you know what is more difficult 
to obtain than money?

360
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,202
Permission! We now have that in our hands.

361
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,539
Money, we will raise no matter what.

362
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,873
-Inshallah.  
-Inshallah.

363
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,708
That's why we have you.

364
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,377
How come all of you are still here?

365
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:26,280
We are about to burn George Bush's effigy. 
We should go now.

366
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,183
Shereef Sahib, 
I suggest you change this attire.

367
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,919
What if they mistake you for Mr. Bush 
and burn you.

368
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,121
Inquilab Zindabad.

369
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:35,789
[crowd] Inquilab Zindabad.

370
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,791
You who quench your hunger with bullets.

371
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,826
[crowd] You who quench 
your hunger with bullet's.

372
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,662
We salute the children of Iraq!

373
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,497
[crowd] We salute the children of Iraq!

374
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,666
You who face American missiles.

375
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,668
[crowd] You who face American missiles.

376
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,536
We salute the mothers of Iraq, 
you who face American missiles.

377
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,672
[crowd] We salute the mothers of Iraq.

378
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,917
-Will you please sound the horn? 
-[horn honks]

379
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,661
Brother-in-law, hi.

380
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,330
Your daughter has a slight fever.

381
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,699
Your wife has asked not to bring her out.

382
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,002
I promise to leave 
after I give her this cycle.

383
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,006
Not right now. Listen to me, please. 
Now is not a good time.

384
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,182
-Will you give this money to her? 
-No, no!

385
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:38,085
-Come on! Please. 
-There's no need for this, I am around.

386
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,319
No, please.

387
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:43,323
Are you working 
on any project at the moment?

388
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:47,628
Let's take my kid to a doctor. 
We will drop her after the consultation.

389
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,296
It is not that bad.

390
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,071
-I guess, I'll leave then. 
-Okay.

391
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,548
[telephone keys clicking]

392
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,124
[mobile ringing]

393
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,098
-Hello. 
-Hello.

394
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,001
Assalamualaikum. This is Thoufeeq.

395
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:30,070
Yes, Thoufeeq.

396
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:32,706
How are you? Hope you are well.

397
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,945
God willing, all will be well.

398
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:43,417
I wanted to discuss 
about our movie budget with you.

399
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,620
People are saying 
it's a bit too high.

400
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,122
We are not shooting a movie right...

401
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,792
It's just a TV cinema.

402
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:56,363
Exactly. That's why I have 
given you this budget.

403
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,533
This budget is based on the script.

404
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,036
I am only discussing the fee  
 for my assistant and I.

405
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,539
You may pay the rest of the workers 
as you please.

406
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,041
You may figure out food  
 and all other arrangements yourself,

407
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,710
based on your budget.

408
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,613
We are not going to interfere.

409
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:13,914
Inshallah.

410
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,116
-Let's do it that way then. 
-Alright, then.

411
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,117
Okay.

412
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,955
You seem to be extra kind today.

413
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,993
After many years, 
somebody cared to ask me how I am doing.

414
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:27,327
I am returning the kindness.

415
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,502
If we pay what we have now as advance,

416
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:36,837
we can shoot for two days.

417
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,840
Once we raise money 
for a total of five days,

418
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,708
we can commence shooting.

419
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,377
How much money 
do we need for that?

420
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,411
Fifty thousand.

421
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,413
In that case,

422
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,415
let's start door-to-door collection 
tomorrow onwards.

423
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:49,917
We will surely raise the money.

424
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:53,787
-My dear, Thoufeeq. 
-Yes.

425
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,623
Why don't we say it's a documentary 
instead of movie to the donors?

426
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,225
That's not necessary.

427
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,861
We will convey the truth. 
If he wants to give, he will.

428
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,829
Alright, Inshallah.

429
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,832
I have some interest money 
lying in my bank account.

430
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,836
How about using that money 
to make this movie?

431
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,373
Would you give that money 
if it's for the mosque fund?

432
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:16,376
-No. I wouldn't. 
-How about for an Islamic school?

433
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,579
Of course... not!

434
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,414
If that's the case, 
we don't want it either.

435
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,548
Our intentions are pure.

436
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,985
We do not want money 
that you consider haraam.

437
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,121
Maybe you should donate it 
to poor people with heavy debts.

438
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,657
Well, then, Kunjaputtika.Assalamualaikum.

439
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:37,331
"Therefore...

440
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:42,002
people who have understood 
the needs of this project,

441
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:46,874
and interested people are encouraged 
to contribute for this movie."

442
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,943
Non-interested people 
need not contribute, right?

443
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:54,715
We are here particularly 
to get non-interested people interested.

444
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,917
You mean, get me interested 
and get money out of me?

445
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,486
It's heavy weights like you 
that we seek refuge in.

446
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,122
Since when do you like 
heavy weight business owners?

447
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,625
Don't you always say that 
capitalism must be destroyed?

448
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,493
Capitalism needs to be destroyed, 
not entrepreneurs.

449
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,494
Oh, the difference!

450
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:09,830
Capitalism means America.

451
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,099
-Entrepreneur means, you, Abukka! 
-Oh, like that!

452
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,667
How much money do you guys need?

453
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,569
-Twenty thousand. 
-That means half of twenty.

454
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,070
Jazakallah Khair.

455
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:18,372
Do give us the cheque.

456
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:21,975
[indistinct]

457
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:27,381
-Astaghfirulla!  
 -Return the photographs.

458
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:31,251
These are photographs 
of famous Malayalam serial actors.

459
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:34,121
If we cast professionals like them, 
we can shoot as per schedule.

460
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:35,455
That is a guarantee.

461
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:36,657
Oh, hey...

462
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,161
Will you guys be joining us for lunch?

463
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,197
Yes, of course. Most definitely.

464
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,331
Oh...

465
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:50,904
Director sir,

466
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:54,374
the hero-heroine in our movie 
are a married couple.

467
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,542
Yes.

468
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:58,912
Won't it be better if we cast 
a real life married couple?

469
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:02,583
Why would we do that?

470
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,286
To avoid the discomfort 
between two strangers

471
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,156
that they might have 
while acting as a couple.

472
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,793
These are professional actors.

473
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:14,328
They will do it effortlessly.

474
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,867
A real life couple 
will make it look more realistic.

475
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,703
It will enhance 
their chemistry in our movie.

476
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,539
Not just that, we have 
a few recommendations for these roles.

477
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,242
Let me tell you 
the real reason, director sir.

478
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,078
We have pushed very hard 
to get this movie this far.

479
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:35,082
Not everyone in our organization agrees 
with our plan to make this movie.

480
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:40,254
On top of that, 
if two strangers act as husband and wife,

481
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,122
our people won't appreciate it.

482
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,629
And this will cut down the costs as well.

483
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:51,932
Here's my deal,

484
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,368
we have to start shoot on the 10th 
and finish on the 22nd.

485
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:58,705
The location is not ready yet. 
I don't have time to waste over casting.

486
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:03,076
The actors we are suggesting are good. 
They have street theater experience.

487
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,248
-Are you absolutely sure? 
-We guarantee.

488
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,120
Okay, we'll give it a shot.

489
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,489
But the risk won't be mine.

490
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:16,623
Sure.

491
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:38,579
Assalamualaikum.

492
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,913
Walaikum Assalam.

493
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:45,619
Suhra...

494
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,958
What should a wife do 
for her husband to fulfill his duties?

495
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,527
Shouldn't the husband 
be fulfilling his duties himself?

496
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,295
What has the wife got to do with it?

497
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,130
That is not what I meant.

498
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:59,933
When a husband attempts 
to fulfill his duties,

499
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,836
what support 
would the wife ideally give?

500
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,072
Good support.

501
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,642
I am going to give you 
a terrific opportunity.

502
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:11,411
Mmm.

503
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,248
Hold this.

504
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:19,953
Pull.

505
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,724
-Shake it... 
-I am doing it.

506
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:29,663
I may have to oblige

507
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:34,334
to play the lead role of our movie.

508
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:36,870
So your duty is...

509
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,874
Only if you act as my wife in the movie,

510
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,043
I will be allowed to do the role.

511
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,380
Tell me, Suhra,

512
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,916
if I become the hero, 
will you be my heroine?

513
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:55,956
God almighty says he does not burden 
any soul beyond the limit it can bear,

514
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,958
chapter two, Holy Quran.

515
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:00,661
Please fold this garment.

516
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,838
No way! Impossible!

517
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,239
Her and I? 
As husband and wife?

518
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,442
Impossible!

519
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,125
So is this what you are up to these days?

520
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:11,665
We are respectable people.

521
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,100
Quran class, conferences...

522
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:17,037
These were just excuses 
to legitimize your vagrant behavior.

523
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,079
Sorry. Please don't be offended.

524
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,348
Primarily, she is not 
a member of our organization.

525
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,750
Let me try and speak to her once more.

526
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,285
Don't. First and foremost,

527
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,453
introduce our organization properly 
to your wife.

528
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,988
We'll think about acting after that.

529
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,324
Why did you even call us 
if she isn't a member?

530
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,659
I thought we could experiment...

531
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,295
Oh... Some experiment that was!

532
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,432
Assalam...

533
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,874
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam

534
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,411
What's up?

535
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,414
We have exhausted 
our list of potential actors.

536
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,616
What about me?

537
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,251
You are a cop.

538
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,586
Is the hero a cop?

539
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,956
The hero is not a cop, 
but you are acting as a cop.

540
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,629
Will Suhra act?

541
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,499
You are the only one 
who can convince Suhra.

542
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,536
Can you ask the State President 
of our organization to call Suhra?

543
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:24,037
She will definitely listen 
to the leadership.

544
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:39,953
The thing is, we want you to act 
as your husband's wife.

545
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,327
That is what I do every day.

546
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,099
[chuckles]

547
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,835
See. This is the exact talent 
we are seeking.

548
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,372
Come, Suhra, someone important wants 
to speak with you.

549
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,043
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

550
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,078
-This is Raheem.-Is the matter resolved?

551
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,047
-We have discussed the matter.-Okay.

552
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,916
-Now you too speak with her.-Okay. Is she there?

553
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,285
-Here she is. I'll give her the phone.-Okay.

554
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,953
[whispering] State President.

555
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:19,626
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

556
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,328
How are you, Suhra?

557
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:22,629
Alhamdulillah.

558
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:24,498
I'll come straight to the point.

559
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:27,901
This is regarding the discussion  
 Raheem and Thoufeeq had with you.

560
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,037
I want you to consider  
 their proposal in all seriousness.

561
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,872
None of us are cinema experts.

562
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:35,309
When a need arises, we have to step in.  
 It's simply just another activity

563
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,877
like you chanting slogans  
 in our organized protests.

564
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:40,914
So, think and decide accordingly.

565
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:41,915
Inshallah.

566
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,951
-Inshallah.  
-Inshallah.

567
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,419
Inshallah.

568
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:52,125
[reciting Quran]

569
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:09,910
Finish this tea and then go.

570
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:11,745
You are always busy.

571
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:18,785
Mom...

572
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,623
I am starting a new venture.

573
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:25,959
I know you are always praying for me,

574
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,629
but this time I want you to pray 
a little more than usual

575
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,330
I am a bit scared...

576
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,666
You don't worry, my dear, 
I will tell Allah.

577
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,169
-Okay. Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

583
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,098

00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,945
"Bismillah, Bismillah"

587
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:22,683
"Bismillah, Bismillah"

588
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,287
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

589
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,155
Beautiful house.

590
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,790
This is not the pattern I am looking for.

591
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,794
We need a different set up. 
Thoufeeq, I am not happy with this.

592
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:35,829
Thoufeeq.

593
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,131
Why don't we look at my house?

594
00:36:38,165 --> 00:36:39,199
What about your mom?

595
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,168
Mom is in Dubai with my brother.

596
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,236
I will convince her.

597
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,371
Let's give it a shot.

598
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,374
-Suhra! 
-[knocking on window]

599
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,077
Suhra!

600
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,081
I'll be right back.

601
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:10,998
I had gone to the library.

602
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:13,867
Sundaran sir had asked me 
to read this book.

603
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:18,705
Show me the book.

604
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:21,742
Tea.

Things just got easy.

608
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,326
You two can shoot here 
and thereafter sleep here itself.

"Bismillah"

629
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,786
Raheem Sahib, is this ritual necessary?

630
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:17,124
It is their reverence towards their craft.

631
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,361
Our director is definitely syncretic.

632
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,163
Thoufeeq, who will inaugurate?

633
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:25,999
Raheem Sahib?

634
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,871

00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:45,419
Stay calm.

639
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,335
Your first shot is ready. 
Shall we start?

640
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,870
Ready. Bismillah.

641
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,371
Not you, just her.

642
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:06,874
Yeah. Bismillah.

643
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,209
No, we don't need Bismillah, only Suhra.

644
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,285
When the light isn't so harsh, 
we'll step out,

645
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,587
-and you plan it accordingly. Alright? 
-Okay.

646
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:22,923
Hello.

647
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,291
Your shot is very simple.

648
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:25,626
Postman arrives,

649
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,127
gives you a letter,

650
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,162
you receive the letter happily,

651
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:30,964
it's your job appointment letter.

652
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,599
Shall we start?

653
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,335
This is not a tense scene.

654
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:38,038
You must receive the letter happily.

655
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:39,706
And then you go back into the house.

656
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,043
[mumbles] I want to talk 
to my husband once.

657
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,380
Abhi...

658
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,215
-Yeah, okay. I will call him. 
-Let's hurry then.

659
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,250
Why don't you wait outside. 
I will call him.

660
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:53,453
Sir, please come.

661
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,794
She wants to talk to you.

662
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,502
-What happened? 
-I am scared.

663
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:12,072
You don't need to worry 
just because I'm not there in this scene.

664
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:14,474
How can I be there 
in all the scenes with you?

665
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,710
It is good that you are alone 
in the first scene.

666
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,245
You need to get used to this as well.

667
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:21,682
No! Do not do that. 
That will make a sound.

668
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:25,118
And when you hand it over, quietly...

669
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,422
-Can't allow the sound of your footsteps. 
-Okay, sir.

670
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:29,456
Okay?

671
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,458
Are you okay?

672
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,330
Abhi, go call her. That's enough.

673
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:37,865
That too will make a sound.

674
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,167
Artist ready? Let's begin!

675
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,669
[in Hindi] Don't yell, watch the sound.

676
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,537
Suhra.

677
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:45,172
Abhi!

678
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:46,373
Are we ready?

679
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,408
Yes, sir, getting ready. One minute.

680
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,543
Ready.

681
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:52,412
-Sound! 
-[loudly] Silence!

682
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:58,418
Ready! Sound rolling.

683
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,454
-Camera. 
-Rolling.

684
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,756
And action!

685
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,664
Cut, cut.

686
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,833
You don't stay there, 
give the letter and go.

687
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,335
But... where do I go?

688
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,739
-Abhi! 
-Sir...

689
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,542
Give the letter and go that way.

690
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:22,776
-Ready? 
-Yes.

691
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:23,877
Okay, sir, ready.

692
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:26,914
Sound.

693
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:31,585
-Ready. Ready for take. Stand by. 
-Ready, sir.

694
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:33,453
[loudly] Silence!

695
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:35,989
-Camera. 
-Rolling.

696
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:37,624
And action!

697
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:44,164
Cut, cut, cut! [groans]

698
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,167
You have to take the cycle with you!

699
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:49,236
You get it?

00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:51,538
Abhi!

701
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,442
Thoufeeq, these actors 
are members of our organization.

702
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,411
Ask the director to be polite.

703
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,113
Their families are watching.

704
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:04,251
Could be because this is our first day. 
I will talk to him.

705
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:05,485
Ready?

706
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:09,790
-Excuse me... 
-Get out of here!

707
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:15,362
Can you all please move away.

708
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:18,665
Director is getting tensed.

709
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:22,369
-When did you arrive, Thoufeeq? 
-I have been here since morning.

710
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,037
Ready for take. Stand by.

711
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:27,574
Ready. Ready, ready.

712
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,742
Camera.

713
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:31,912
And action!

714
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:40,120
Cut, cut, cut.

715
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:43,257
-What happened? 
-Sorry, sir...

716
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,791
-A thud sound... 
-[clothes sloshing in distant]

717
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,460
What is it?

718
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,498
-Washing sound... Laundry... 
-Someone please go and stop them!

719
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:53,000
-Thoufeeq! 
-Yes!

720
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:55,335
-Aslam, go check it out! 
-Yes.

721
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:23,163
What is wrong 
if this sound is in the movie, my dear?

722
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,499
Director asked me to stop you.

723
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,335
But this sound 
is the sound of our village life.

724
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,370
What is wrong 
if they hear it in the movie?

725
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:33,640
My dear son, my children 
are going to reach home after school.

726
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,375
I have to first finish this 
and then make lunch.

727
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:38,412
I can't stop this midway. 
Get out of here!

728
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,413
As you say.

729
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,287
-[clothes sloshing in distant] 
-Our dialogues are drowning

730
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:48,488
in the loud laundry sounds,

731
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,657
audience won't be able to hear 
the movie dialogues.

732
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,293
I will take the laundry sounds separately.

733
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,663
As of now, please ask them to stop. 
Got it?

734
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,334
Silence!

735
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:10,577
Sister, please!

736
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:16,950
Action!

737
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:25,158
Cut.

738
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,161
Ambience. Don't move.

739
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:29,663
Two minutes.

740
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:31,832
Stand by.

741
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:34,868
Ready for take. Silence!

742
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:38,872
Sound rolling!

743
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,377
[birds chirping]

744
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:59,126
[chirping continues]

745
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:08,001
Why is everyone standing so still?

746
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:10,204
I think they are playing 
the national anthem.

747
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,339
Maybe today's work is over.

748
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,041
-I guess. 
-Yeah.

749
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,709
National anthem right, 
let's stand in attendance.

750
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:18,412
Can't hear anything though.

751
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,081
Right. I am sure they can hear it.

752
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,417
If they can hear it, 
we should also be able to hear it.

753
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,451
That's right.

754
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,120
Have we gone deaf?

755
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,156
We are not deaf!

756
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,959
-Can you hear what I am saying? 
-Yes, I can.

757
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:34,695
Who is it? Who's talking there?

758
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,432
-You remember the dialogues, right? 
-I am ready.

759
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:39,766
Are you ready?

760
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,704
Let's pan slowly.

761
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:45,205
The artists are ready.

762
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:47,040
Ready. Ready. Ready for take.

763
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,076
[loudly] Silence!

764
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:50,878
Ready, sir.

765
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:52,412
[rooster crowing]

766
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:53,413
Sound.

767
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,548
[rooster clucking]

768
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,183
Sound!

769
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:58,452
-Sound. 
-[In Hindi] Murga...

770
00:46:58,585 --> 00:46:59,953
Murga...

771
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:02,589
-"Muruga"! 
-Not that "Muruga"

772
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:04,458
Hen...

773
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,826
Someone take care of the hen!

774
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,128
In the yard. 
Right side of the house.

775
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,797
[rooster crowing]

776
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,166
[clucking]

777
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,208
That's it... That's the hen!

778
00:47:32,786 --> 00:47:33,487
[cooker hissing]

779
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,622
Cooker! Cooker... Pressure cooker!

780
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:37,958
[hissing stops]

781
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,528
[blender whirring]

782
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:42,863
Blender!

783
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:44,131
[whirring stops]

784
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:44,831
[baby crying]

785
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,667
Aw, baby crying.

786
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,335
I hear a baby crying.

787
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:49,336
[crying stops]

788
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,444
[man reciting praying over speakers]

789
00:47:57,578 --> 00:47:59,446
Silence... silence... Silence, please!

790
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,949
-Sound. 
-Not ready, sir. Sound not ready, sir.

791
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:03,917
Call for prayers. 
There are a lot of mosques here.

792
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,619
Six minutes, sir.

793
00:48:06,787 --> 00:48:09,957
"Congratulations! A government job!"

794
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,459
-What? 
-Make up.

795
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:13,293
Ah!

796
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:16,997
-Sound! 
-Stand by.

797
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:20,501
Sound rolling, sir!

798
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,070
-Camera. 
-Rolling, sir.

799
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:24,071
And action!

800
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:30,577
There is something special 
inside this pot.

801
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:31,578
Open the lid.

802
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,583
Oh, boiled paper!

803
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,317
Cut, cut, cut.

804
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,487
Shereef, be at ease. Act naturally.

805
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:41,622
You are supposed to joke.

806
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:42,956
Alright, sir. Got it.

807
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:43,790
Okay, one more.

808
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:45,325
-Stand by. 
-[laughter]

809
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,527
Who is that laughing? Silence!

810
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:47,995
[exhales deeply] Ready, sir.

811
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:49,663
Ready, sir.

812
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,765
And action.

813
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,168
-There is a letter in this dish. 
-Cut!

814
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:56,503
And action!

815
00:48:56,537 --> 00:48:59,206
There is something special in this pot. 
Open the lid.

816
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:04,044
-[chuckles] Boiled chickpeas... 
-Cut, cut.

817
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,213
And action!

818
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:10,083
There is something special in this pot. 
Open the lid.

819
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,288
[chuckles] Boiled paper!

820
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,423
My favorite dish!

821
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:17,791
Try it.

822
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,459
I mean, open it.

823
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:22,996
Cut, cut.

824
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,667
I guess, that'll do. 
Let's go for the next shot.

825
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:27,668
Was that shot okay?

826
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:30,037
-Yes, I'm okay with it. 
-I am not okay with the sound.

827
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,371
We can't keep shooting forever.

828
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:33,207
How can it be okay 
unless the sound is okay?

829
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,542
Will the shot be okay 
just with the right sound?

830
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,412
-But... 
-You will get it on the close-up shot.

831
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:40,747
-But the sound... 
-Abhi, set up the close shot!

832
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:42,416
Let's go for 
the close shot, Jaggu brother.

833
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:45,786
-Why am I even here! 
-You will get it in the close shot, sir.

834
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:47,621
Setup the close up shot.

835
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:48,989
[loudly] Silence!

836
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,460
Ready for take!

837
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:55,963
[distant laughter]

838
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,998
Who the hell is laughing 
in the background?

839
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,501
Ah, ready, sir.

840
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:02,536
Camera.

841
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:04,671
-[bike starting] 
-Rolling, sir.

842
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,573
There is a motorbike. 
Someone started a bike.

843
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,542
A bike.

844
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:13,247
[inaudible]

845
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:15,415
Ready, ready.

846
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,284
Sound.

847
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:19,453
[softly] Rolling.

848
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:21,488
-Camera. 
-Not ready.

849
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:25,659
-Ready, sir. Rolling! 
-And action!

850
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,999
Congratulations! You are now 
a government employee!

851
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:35,869
Cut, cut.

852
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:42,209
-Abhi. 
-Sir?

853
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:47,581
Can we shoot someone else?

854
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,083
-What? 
-Looks like there is a problem.

855
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,618
What problem?

856
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:53,420
We have scheduled 
only their scenes.

857
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:54,821
A different scene, other actors.

858
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,957
Want to watch a different performance 
for a change.

859
00:50:57,624 --> 00:50:59,459
Let's take the dining table scene then.

860
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:01,962
-There are more people in that scene. 
-Okay, let's do that.

861
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:03,130
-Sure? 
-Yes.

862
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:07,000
Brother, come, let's do your scene.

863
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,168
All of you.

864
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:10,704
All the best.

865
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:13,207
-Hey... All the best 
-Pray for us!

866
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,912
Everything is in your hands.

867
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,548
Do your best.

868
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,985
-Save the day. Please! 
-You don't worry.

869
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,086
Right?

870
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,122
And action!

871
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,959
Shouldn't we conclude on the land matter?

872
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:35,662
In my opinion, 
let Shuaib buy that piece of land.

873
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,965
What's your opinion?

874
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:39,833
I have no objections.

875
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,503
Shuaib's wife is a government official.

876
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,872
She can take a bank loan.

877
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:47,307
At least, let them be salvaged.

878
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:50,210
If they take a bank loan, 
it's the bank who will be salvaged.

879
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,043
Phew! [sighs]

880
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:26,580
Let's pack up!

881
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:29,082
We need to discuss 
whether to move forward with this.

882
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:31,919
Don't pack up yet. 
I have to record ambience sound,

883
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:33,954
room sounds... 
People, don't move for two minutes.

884
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:36,723
Don't move. Everyone... Ambience

885
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,792
Going for take. [loudly] Silence!

886
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,283
ABODE OF PEACE

887
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:05,152
Some of you wait here.

888
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:07,120
Rest of us can go and speak with them.

889
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,822
Usman brother, let's go.

890
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:19,333
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

891
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,668
Shereef, these people have something 
to say to you.

892
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:24,071
They have a slight discomfort 
to convey this to you.

893
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,206
However, I took the lead

894
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,208
and that is why I am here now.

895
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,244
What is it, sister? Go on.

896
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,579
Don't we all have a right to live here 
and do our daily chores.

897
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,882
When you ask us to stay silent, 
we have to stay silent,

898
00:53:34,915 --> 00:53:35,916
isn't that so?

899
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:41,655
But asking us to put our chores on hold 
for your production,

900
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:44,324
what type of deal is that?

901
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,828
I am aware that our shoot 
is causing you inconvenience.

902
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:50,497
So you are doing this deliberately.

903
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:51,832
It's not like that...

904
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:52,666
Let's talk.

905
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:55,569
-We'll figure out a way. 
-Yes.

906
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:58,539
You guys over there, please come.

907
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,209
Kunjappa, get some tea for everyone.

908
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,077
Please sit.

909
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:07,881
Shereef, please call Raheem Sahib.

910
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:09,583
We need to find a solution for this.

911
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:16,957
Sorry.

912
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:20,127
Alcohol, tension and a blazing headache.

913
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,995
No worries, rest for some time.

914
00:54:22,129 --> 00:54:24,998
I don't want to rest. 
Find a solution for this mess.

915
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,167
Director sir, please sit.

916
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:28,402
I don't want to sit!

917
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:32,906
What the hell is all this? 
Who are all these people?

918
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,042
Are you people serious about this film?

919
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,279
There is a phone call 
for one of you Sahib.

920
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:41,081
-Who is it? 
-Some other Sahib.

921
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,750
There is some problem at the shooting set. 
Village folk have assembled.

922
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:47,120
I'll go and have a look.

923
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,361
It's over there.

924
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:01,068
Our actors are ready 
to do anything for us.

925
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:04,872
That is not what I need. 
I want people who can act.

926
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:07,207
Shouldn't a good director 
be able to make them act?

927
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:08,542
Then go find a good director.

928
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:10,377
No, you are good.

929
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,748
You have no idea what I am going through.

930
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:16,683
My movie... It's exasperating.

931
00:55:18,252 --> 00:55:19,786
Even I'm at fault here.

932
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:22,289
Siraj brother...

933
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,892
Our actors are innocent people.

934
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,628
Please don't fire them. 
They will get hurt.

935
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:30,831
What about my pain?

936
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:37,704
Can we find a way 
that won't cause pain to either party?

937
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,043
I will bring an acting trainer.

938
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:46,246
We will include 
whoever the trainer selects,

939
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,081
the rest will be hurt.

940
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:50,951
For the remaining roles, 
I will find other actors.

941
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:53,987
-I agree. 
-You have to.

942
00:55:54,621 --> 00:55:56,456
That's the only solution.

943
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,500
You are not firing me, I am quitting.

944
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,069
Your movie does not deserve sync sound.

945
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,038
You guys are just... Well, whatever...

946
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:12,039
Give me my money.

947
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,374
Why are your hands trembling?

948
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,911
Looks like 
there's an extra 50 rupees in here.

949
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,368
[howls]

950
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,706
My father was a fish seller.

951
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,207
I learnt this howl from him.

952
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:50,377
Let's all try and howl once, 
from our heart.

953
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:51,578
Go for it!

954
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,247
[all howling]

955
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:03,557
You guys must have heard 
much about the process of acting.

956
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:06,293
It's a journey of discovering 
the self and stuff like that.

957
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:07,628
Acting is not just all that.

958
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:09,997
Acting is like...

959
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:13,000
Like a...

960
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:16,170
A mutiny with the self.

961
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:19,673
Meaning, we all have certain assumptions 
about ourselves.

962
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:23,877
We can't become characters 
without fighting these assumptions.

963
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:26,246
Are you guys ready for this mutiny? 
Shall we start?

964
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,682
Shake your hands and legs.

965
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,084
And relax.

966
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,654
Take a deep breath.

967
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:34,788
[grunting]

968
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:35,789
Inhale...

969
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:37,558
[all exhale gruntingly]

970
00:57:38,325 --> 00:57:40,460
Release your body down.

971
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:46,700
Raheem Sahib,

972
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:49,536
if the leaders of our organization 
see this, will we be in trouble?

973
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,506
We don't answer to these leaders, 
we answer to Allah.

974
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,474
I am not afraid in Allah's matter.

975
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,543
Allah will understand our situation.

976
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:58,111
That's all that matters.

977
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:01,081
Our next exercise is a surprise.

978
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:03,083
I won't tell you how to enact it.

979
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:04,418
I am going to give you a word.

980
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:07,788
You have to enact it

981
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:11,625
in the manner you perceive it.

982
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,826
Waterfall.

983
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,863
Is that a waterfall?

984
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:19,166
Now storm! 
Transform yourselves into a storm.

985
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,667
A storm is blowing!

986
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:23,403
It is knocking down 
everything in its way!

987
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:25,038
A light breeze.

988
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:30,878
Fire.

989
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:34,748
Peace.

990
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:36,416
An earthquake!

991
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:41,455
Earthquake, massive earthquake...

992
00:58:42,122 --> 00:58:45,792
Okay, okay, okay! 
Clap! Clap! Clap!

993
00:58:55,502 --> 00:59:01,208
You need to perform in tandem  
 with my action and emotion.

994
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:05,412
I will transition from one emotion 
to another without telling you.

995
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:07,414
Let's start.

996
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,621
[breathing heavily]

997
00:59:19,026 --> 00:59:20,294
[exclaiming]

998
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:23,163
[screams]

999
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,332
[laughing]

1000
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,411
[crying]

1001
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,249
[sobbing]

1002
00:59:57,664 --> 00:59:59,333
Okay, stop.

1003
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,401
Stop! Wow!

1004
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:03,704
Your performances were effortless.

1005
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:05,205
Excellent! Very good!

1006
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,907
That was smooth.

1007
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,308
Well done!

1008
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,743
[woman sobbing]

1009
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,625
Suhra.

1010
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,327
[sobbing]

1011
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,746
I am tying your eyes,

1012
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:49,583
however, to not see anything  
 you need to keep your eyes closed.

1013
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:52,152
See all you can in your mind.

1014
01:00:52,252 --> 01:00:55,289
Lead your mind to become 
who you really want to be,

1015
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:58,625
to the sights you really want to see.

1016
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:06,500
Sights that are there 
only in your memories,

1017
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,037
sights that may occur 
only in your dreams,

1018
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,473
happy sights that can overwhelm 
you with tears.

1019
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,120
All of a sudden...

1020
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:29,456
Just like that 
change the pace of your vision!

1021
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:32,993
Throw your most painful memory 
before yourself!

1022
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,372
Now you may all open your eyes.

1023
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,577
I am going to change 
all of your seating locations.

1024
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:52,412
Volunteers...

1025
01:02:01,622 --> 01:02:02,623
Come.

1026
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:13,700
Now...

1027
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,870
You guys need to sit where you are 
and talk freely.

1028
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:21,975
There may be someone 
sitting next to you and listening,

1029
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,410
or maybe not.

1030
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:27,381
But you need to talk with the belief 
that someone's listening to you.

1031
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:29,416
You could talk about anything.

1032
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:32,753
It could be about a pain lingering 
from the past in your memories.

1033
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:34,121
It could be anything.

1034
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:35,656
[exhales deeply]

1035
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:40,861
I know a story.

1036
01:02:42,996 --> 01:02:44,331
The story of a girl.

1037
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:48,335
There's a question in her story...

1038
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:51,038
that still troubles me.

1039
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:54,875
The girl has two sisters.

1040
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:59,746
Their darling father...

1041
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:02,850
passed away.

1042
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:06,954
That night,

1043
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,457
the three sisters and their husbands

1044
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:14,127
got together to talk about father's debts.

1045
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:16,196
Everyone knows that Dad has debts.

1046
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,832
As his eldest daughter,

1047
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:23,904
I take responsibility for his debts.

1048
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:25,873
Well...

1049
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,377
I pardon him for all the debts he owes me.

1050
01:03:30,577 --> 01:03:34,748
Dad had borrowed much  
 from both sisters and their husbands.

1051
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:37,117
Both said they don't want the money back.

1052
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,786
I pardon him too 
for all the debts he owes me.

1053
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,456
Dad had requested  
 the third son-in-law also for a loan.

1054
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:44,625
Not only did he not give him any loan,

1055
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:47,995
he spoke inappropriately  
 about the dead man.

1056
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:52,332
I also pardon him 
for all the debts he owes me.

1057
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:59,072
What he said was not true.

1058
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:05,412
She couldn't understand why he lied  
 about the dead man.

1059
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,582
This question still bothers her.

1060
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,789
Everybody, untie your eye-bands.

1061
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,457
-Inhale! 
-[all inhale]

1062
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:51,725
[all exhale gruntingly]

1063
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,627
-Inhale! 
-[all inhale]

1064
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:54,995
[all exhale gruntingly]

1065
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,130
-Inhale! 
-[all inhale]

1066
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:57,998
[all exhale gruntingly]

1067
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:02,002
We had a wonderful training session 
over the past two days.

1068
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:04,371
Let's give our trainer a loud applause.

1069
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:12,913
Our trainer Haseena 
will now announce the names

1070
01:05:12,946 --> 01:05:15,249
of the actors selected for our movie.

1071
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:17,417
Rest of you,

1072
01:05:17,451 --> 01:05:22,256
please look at it as learning curve 
and a chance to correct your mistakes.

1073
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,123
Thank you.

1074
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,326
Let's announce the list.

1075
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:30,464
I am going to do a very tough job now.

1076
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:31,832
This can be cruel,

1077
01:05:31,832 --> 01:05:34,168
but this is my job.

1078
01:05:34,201 --> 01:05:36,537
And then, this is what I get paid for.

1079
01:05:36,537 --> 01:05:37,871
Give me the list.

1080
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:42,209
We have selected six people out of you.

1081
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:45,245
When your name is announced, 
please come forward and line up.

1082
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:46,547
I am sorry to the rest of you

1083
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,249
and I wish you all the best 
for your future.

1084
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:55,489
Suhra.

1085
01:05:57,491 --> 01:05:58,625
[all applauding]

1086
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:02,996
Samad.

1087
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,000
Ubaid.

1088
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:09,369
Sumayya.

1089
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,207
Muhsina.

1090
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,210
[scattered applause]

1091
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,081
Salim.

1092
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,318
[scattered applause]

1093
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,458
This is the list of people 
who are not selected.

1094
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,574
What about Shereef?

1095
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,409
Suhra's husband?

1096
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:52,412
Isn't it decided 
that Suhra's real life husband

1097
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:54,414
will only act as her husband?

1098
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:56,917
-Isn't that so, Siraj sir? 
-What?

1099
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:59,953
-Suhra's husband... 
-Yeah.

1100
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,126
Shereef, you may also come. It's alright.

1101
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:29,082
Congratulations to all! Thank you.

1102
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,654
Thoufeeq Sahib,

1103
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:36,123
when we had set forth on this journey,

1104
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:39,293
we came ready to sacrifice our body, 
money, pride and what not.

1105
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,128
Our rewards are not in this world,

1106
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:42,863
it is in the hereafter.

1107
01:07:42,996 --> 01:07:44,831
Our prayers are with you.

1108
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:46,200
I'll leave then.

1109
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:49,536
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

1110
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:10,624
Debt is not just a loan...

1111
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,293
there are other aspects also.

1112
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,528
Like...

1113
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:17,664
During the wedding, 
I did not ask for any dowry,

1114
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:20,834
neither did I accept dowry, 
although, that is the convention.

1115
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:22,703
Those are debts as well.

1116
01:08:23,537 --> 01:08:25,372
I did not accept the offerings

1117
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,242
her brothers-in-law accepted 
from her father.

1118
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,443
Those are debts as well.

1119
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:32,946
Those are the debts 
that I pardoned her father for.

1120
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:46,126
Why have you stopped talking to me?

1121
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,328
I have to learn my dialogues.

1122
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:51,999
But you don't have a dialogue 
in the upcoming scene.

1123
01:08:52,099 --> 01:08:54,501
Acting is not just 
about dialogue delivery.

1124
01:09:00,874 --> 01:09:02,409
Add some smoke, please.

1125
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:12,619
Liked it?

1126
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,121
Ready. Ready.

1127
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,289
Good to go, sir.

1128
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:17,791
-Camera. 
-Running.

1129
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:19,459
And action!

1130
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:34,208
Leave it in the bathroom, 
I will call mom.

1131
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:46,119
Mom, I have kept hot water 
in the bathroom.

1132
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:49,256
-Go take a bath. It's late. 
-Okay.

1133
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,225
What if she is employed,

1134
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:54,161
she attends to this household perfectly.

1135
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,129
May God bless her!

1136
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:57,331
Ameen!

1137
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:01,201
Girls have to do all household chores.

1138
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:03,904
When I got married, your mother...

1139
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,573
Don't repeat it like a tape. 
I said nothing.

1140
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:07,574
Cut!

1141
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,243
Was the focus alright?

1142
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:15,115
Suhra was brilliant!

1143
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:17,618
Her chemistry with others 
is working out well.

1144
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:20,454
Did you burn your hands?

1145
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:22,789
-Abhi! 
-Yes.

1146
01:10:22,923 --> 01:10:24,658
-What's next? 
-The song cut.

1147
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:29,663
Eat!

1148
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,332
Do you want 
some more chammanthi?

1149
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:34,668
Suhra, the shot is ready. 
Hurry up, please.

1150
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:29,289
Ready, sir.

1151
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,161
Have a drink.

1152
01:11:34,194 --> 01:11:35,996
Thoufeeq, come here for a moment.

1153
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:38,999
Can we really drink this?

1154
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:41,835
When circumstantially obliged, we can.

1155
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:43,070
What is the problem?

1156
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:46,206
There is no problem, 
we are just clarifying a concern.

1157
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:49,209
This is not alcohol, 
it's an aerated beverage. You can drink.

1158
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:52,279
We know this is not alcohol, 
and alcohol is haraam.

1159
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:54,281
We don't drink cola.

1160
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:55,415
No, we don't.

1161
01:11:55,415 --> 01:11:58,285
-Why is that? 
-That is a political stance.

1162
01:11:58,418 --> 01:11:59,786
What politics is that?

1163
01:12:00,287 --> 01:12:02,289
How about black tea?

1164
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:05,692
-We can give it to you without sugar. 
-We are fine with sugar too.

1165
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:06,627
I'll be back in a minute.

1166
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:08,662
Three black tea, please.

1167
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:09,830
Ready, sir.

1168
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,668
[inaudible]

1169
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:21,708
[inaudible]

1170
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:38,792
[inaudible]

1171
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:46,834
[inaudible]

1172
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:50,204
-Hello.-Hello, yes.

1173
01:12:50,237 --> 01:12:51,371
Is Bilal available?

1174
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:53,473
Uh, he is not home.

1175
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,708
Oh, is it?

1176
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,944
Who is it speaking?  
 Would you like to leave a message?

1177
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:58,245
No, I am his friend.

1178
01:12:58,278 --> 01:12:59,746
Shall I ask him to call back?

1179
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,950
-That's alright, I will call tomorrow. 
-Okay.

1180
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,585
Alright then.

1181
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:06,620
What is it?

1182
01:13:06,753 --> 01:13:08,956
Your brother-in-law is not at home.

1183
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:13,694
Shall we leave?

1184
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:15,963
Okay.

1185
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,873
-Daddy. 
-Pathoos!

1186
01:13:26,373 --> 01:13:27,975
My darling!

1187
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,713
You have become lean, my dear!

1188
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,548
Where have you been, Dad?

1189
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:36,250
I was at work, honey.

1190
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:38,619
You have become weak, my darling.

1191
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:39,620
Look!

1192
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:42,623
Isn't this the cycle you wanted?

1193
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:44,224
-Isn't it? 
-Yes.

1194
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,793
Come, let's ride.

1195
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:48,862
-Do you like it? 
-Yes.

1196
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:50,664
Take it for a spin!

1197
01:13:56,537 --> 01:13:58,338
-Honey... come here... 
-[clicks tongue]

1198
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:06,413
Come inside, Siraj.

1199
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:10,751
Are you kidding me?

1200
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,419
Or are you serious?

1201
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:15,622
Don't you know the answer already.

1202
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,333
I am leaving, darling.

1203
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:27,668
When will you come back?

1204
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:29,002
Soon, my dear.

1205
01:14:38,745 --> 01:14:41,248
-When are you getting married? 
-April 18th.

1206
01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:42,916
Why?

1207
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:03,203
Will you please tell me 
what is going on in your mind?

1208
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:08,876
What you said at the training 
was not appropriate.

1209
01:15:09,409 --> 01:15:11,612
When that trainer asked us 
to reveal our hearts,

1210
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:12,946
I spoke unintentionally.

1211
01:15:14,748 --> 01:15:17,251
Had someone overheard, 
what would they think about me?

1212
01:15:17,317 --> 01:15:20,153
No one else heard anything, 
you are the only one who heard.

1213
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:21,622
That's my good fortune.

1214
01:15:22,122 --> 01:15:25,626
But how could you decide 
to speak about it?

1215
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:34,067
I realized only during the training 
that this incident is still burdening me.

1216
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:46,947
Is it my mistake that I can't forget?

1217
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,416
Or is it your mistake that you said 
such awful things about me?

1218
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:50,918
I didn't say such a thing.

1219
01:15:50,984 --> 01:15:52,953
Do you mean I'm a liar?

1220
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,088
No,

1221
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,790
that's not what I mean.

1222
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,792
I meant you misunderstood me.

1223
01:15:58,825 --> 01:15:59,960
Cut, cut, cut.

1224
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,665
Uh...

1225
01:16:04,798 --> 01:16:06,867
Shereef, relax a little bit.

1226
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:10,204
-Did you forget your dialogue? 
-The scene was sudden...

1227
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:11,672
Were you not briefed about the scene?

1228
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:12,873
-Sahib...  
-Yes.

1229
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:15,042
-Have you not briefed Shereef? 
-Yes.

1230
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,279
The two of you are arguing

1231
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:22,950
about what the husband told his mother 
about his wife.

1232
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:27,955
In order to please your mother, 
you spoke ill about your wife on purpose.

1233
01:16:28,622 --> 01:16:29,923
What we mean is,

1234
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:31,658
in order to appease your mother,

1235
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,961
you spoke ill about your wife. 
That's all there is.

1236
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:36,496
-One could put it that way. 
-Let's just put it that way.

1237
01:16:36,663 --> 01:16:37,664
So...

1238
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:39,666
You guys are a real life couple,

1239
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:42,169
enact the way you naturally fight at home.

1240
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:46,206
Such a thing never happens between us, 
that's why this scene is difficult.

1241
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:55,749
Okay.

1242
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,584
Cool. Hmm.

1243
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,420
Let's do it again. Okay.

1244
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:05,959
And action!

1245
01:17:05,993 --> 01:17:07,628
Is it my mistake that I can't forget?

1246
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,997
Or is it your mistake that you said 
such awful things about me?

1247
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:10,998
I didn't say such a thing!

1248
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:13,333
Do you mean I'm a liar?

1249
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,669
No, that's not what I meant, 
you misunderstood me!

1250
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:18,338
Am I the only one who makes mistakes, 
don't you make mistakes?

1251
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:20,641
Don't exaggerate! 
What do you lack in this home?

1252
01:17:20,707 --> 01:17:23,243
I don't lack anything here! 
But your behavior breaks my heart!

1253
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:24,711
What behavior? What did I do?

1254
01:17:24,745 --> 01:17:26,914
Why are you talking nonsense about me?

1255
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:29,583
I remember each and everything you said!

1256
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:35,789
Cut, cut.

1257
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:44,498
-Thoufeeq Sahib. 
-Yes.

1258
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,367
I think there's some problem 
between those two.

1259
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,569
Who?

1260
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:50,571
Look...

1261
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,077
That... No, thanks.

1262
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:01,048
The problem is between 
the two movie characters. Not them.

1263
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:03,750
Brilliant acting. 
This is all because of the training.

1264
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:05,252
This is not the characters...

1265
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:07,788
Looks like those two have some problem.

1266
01:18:07,788 --> 01:18:09,289
What problem?

1267
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:11,058
How could you figure this out?

1268
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,627
That's because you have 
never been married.

1269
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:14,995
Look through the camera lens.

1270
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:16,163
Show him.

1271
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:28,242
Can you zoom in?

1272
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,161
-You are right. There is some problem. 
-Solve it then.

1273
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:51,164
It's their personal issue, 
how can I get involved?

1274
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:53,534
If I get involved,

1275
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:56,703
it will affect their acting and the movie.

1276
01:18:56,703 --> 01:18:58,872
-Won't it affect the movie if I intervene? 
-It won't.

1277
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:01,208
No, it will only affect you, 
not the movie.

1278
01:19:01,308 --> 01:19:04,044
-Siraj brother... 
-You, the movie writer, is long dead,

1279
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,246
you need to understand that.

1280
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,950
You are playing with this dead writer?

1281
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:13,453
-Lord!-Assalamualaikum.

1282
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,788
Walaikum Assalam.

1283
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:17,658
Ah, go.

1284
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:23,297
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam.

1285
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,098
-Thoufeeq! 
-Come, come.

1286
01:19:25,165 --> 01:19:27,167
-You well? 
-Good, good!

1287
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,070
Here is the problem.

1288
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:34,041
If we were raising funds 
for a Madrasa or an orphanage,

1289
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:36,376
we can physically show the Madrasa  
or the orphanage once it's built.

1290
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:38,278
Had it been a school, 
we could show the school.

1291
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,280
Had it been a mosque, 
we could show the mosque.

1292
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,115
Even conferences can be shown 
to the funders.

1293
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:43,250
However, this is a movie.

1294
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:44,751
If the shoot abruptly stops,

1295
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:46,453
we are accountable to our funders.

1296
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:51,792
Thoufeeq, what are the financials 
of this movie?

1297
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,162
How do you know how much 
will this telemovie cost?

1298
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:59,366
We calculate the daily expenses.

1299
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:04,738
And we raise that money on a daily basis.

1300
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:06,039
Thoufeeq,

1301
01:20:06,173 --> 01:20:08,876
we have to be extra cautious 
while dealing with money.

1302
01:20:08,876 --> 01:20:12,412
Do you think our funders

1303
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:15,582
have clarity about this project?

1304
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:18,085
That's right.

1305
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:21,255
Do you think 
it's because of their blind faith in you?

1306
01:20:23,624 --> 01:20:26,293
No. It's also because of their 
absolute faith in the organization.

1307
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:30,163
Make sure you don't break that trust.

1308
01:20:30,297 --> 01:20:32,833
You must always remember that.

1309
01:20:40,707 --> 01:20:43,877
"The husband helps 
his busy wife with the laundry."

1310
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,913
-Yes. 
-Thoufeeq Sahib...

1311
01:20:45,913 --> 01:20:48,048
did you not write this scene for a song.

1312
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:50,417
What do you want me to shoot? 
What is the content?

1313
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:54,288
Shoot this idea in a manner you like.

1314
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:58,125
When you say they are doing laundry, 
what do you mean?

1315
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:01,461
Is she scrubbing, or is she ironing, 
or is she using a laundry machine?

1316
01:21:01,495 --> 01:21:04,498
If the wife is doing laundry, 
is the husband just watching and smiling?

1317
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,334
Is he helping? How is he helping?

1318
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:09,169
We can only shoot 
if you spell out the actions.

1319
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:12,673
Let's do it this way then...

1320
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:15,042
The wife starts to do laundry,

1321
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:17,744
the husband follows,

1322
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,949
and then he says,  
 "I will do my own laundry."

1323
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,119
I will wash my own clothes.

1324
01:21:31,491 --> 01:21:34,027
What a scene! Filled with righteousness!

1325
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:37,164
Give me more stuff like this, 
scenes filled with righteous deeds.

1326
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:39,166
To begin with, 
help while washing clothes.

1327
01:21:44,538 --> 01:21:48,642
HAVE YOU BEEN GOOD TO YOUR PARENTS? 
HAVE YOU BEEN KIND TO YOUR NEIGHBORS?

1328
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:52,412
HAVE YOU FULFILLED YOUR DUTIES 
TOWARDS YOUR WIFE?

1329
01:21:53,046 --> 01:21:54,581
HAVE YOU BEEN JUST TO YOUR CHILDREN?

1330
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:25,579
And action!

1331
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:30,651
Give those to me, 
you don't need to wash those.

1332
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:31,418
Cut.

1333
01:22:32,085 --> 01:22:34,821
Shereef, speak to her with love.

1334
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:36,123
Okay?

1335
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:37,457
Let's try it again.

1336
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:41,195
Ready. Just the portion here, 
next to the machine.

1337
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:44,164
-Ready? Camera. 
-Rolling, sir.

1338
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,734
Sir.

1339
01:22:50,037 --> 01:22:50,904
What happened?

1340
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:53,807
Can we shoot this scene later?

1341
01:22:54,575 --> 01:22:56,610
I have a headache.

1342
01:23:05,752 --> 01:23:07,654
Let's take the scene in Suhra's office.

1343
01:23:07,788 --> 01:23:08,989
Shift the scene.

1344
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:10,123
Shift to school.

1345
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:14,494
If I am going to lose this job  
 for standing with justice,

1346
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:16,330
I am more than happy to lose this job.

1347
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,464
Oh!

1348
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:18,832
Consider it gone then!

1349
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,534
-I'll see to it. 
-Sure, we'll see.

1350
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,870
You don't know the power 
of my political party.

1351
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:27,374
Cut it.

1352
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:29,376
Okay.

1353
01:23:29,877 --> 01:23:30,911
Nice.

1354
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:32,779
This scene needs additional set up.

1355
01:23:32,913 --> 01:23:34,581
Suhra, you go rest meanwhile.

1356
01:23:35,582 --> 01:23:36,617
What setup?

1357
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:39,620
Just a minute.

1358
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,659
What's he talking about?

1359
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,749
Assalamualaikum.

1360
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:10,083
Walaikum Assalam.

1361
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:15,322
Suhra, I hope you are not facing 
any problems here.

1362
01:24:16,123 --> 01:24:18,125
I have no problem that I have no problems.

1363
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:20,327
Suhra,

1364
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:23,830
are you part of this movie wholeheartedly?

1365
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:26,834
I hope it's not because our organization 
compelled you.

1366
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:29,736
Whatever the organization 
has asked me to do,

1367
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:31,371
I am doing it wholeheartedly.

1368
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:32,573
Mashallah!

1369
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:39,746
Any personal issues because of this movie?

1370
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:45,452
Raheem Sahib...

1371
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:49,623
Please don't ask me to open up.

1372
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,960
I have this disease 
of spilling my pain out.

1373
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,965
If I unintentionally 
speak out uncomfortable truths,

1374
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,367
that will be trouble.

1375
01:25:11,912 --> 01:25:14,381
Sir, your wife's lawyer says 
she will sue you,

1376
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:16,283
not that she has already sued you.

1377
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,417
I mean,

1378
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:20,287
don't go to her house again, 
even if it is to give gifts.

1379
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:21,455
If you go there,

1380
01:25:21,488 --> 01:25:25,125
they will sue you 
for unauthorized entry and kidnapping.

1381
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,627
Is this a threat?

1382
01:25:26,693 --> 01:25:28,829
Are they threatening 
to trap me in a false case?

1383
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:30,964
They are not threatening, 
they are warning you.

1384
01:25:30,998 --> 01:25:32,499
Court cases are like that.

1385
01:25:32,499 --> 01:25:34,201
There will be lies and false accusations.

1386
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:36,703
Do you think anyone can win a case 
just by telling the truth?

1387
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,871
What?

1388
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,206
What?

1389
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:42,209
It seems, 
you are clueless about your life.

1390
01:25:42,242 --> 01:25:44,211
Do you think with your lifestyle,

1391
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:46,079
you will get custody of your child?

1392
01:25:46,246 --> 01:25:49,583
Only a terrific liar lawyer 
can help you win this case.

1393
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:52,252
Do whatever the hell you want 
and get me out of this.

1394
01:25:52,252 --> 01:25:57,457
Then, no unauthorized visits, 
no kidnapping attempts. Strictly.

1395
01:25:57,624 --> 01:25:58,559
But...

1396
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:00,694
Don't give them a chance to accuse you.

1397
01:26:11,538 --> 01:26:15,542
Oil is one of mankind's 
greatest discovery, isn't it?

1398
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:18,078
Do you have any doubts? 
People have fought wars over oil.

1399
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:22,416
Shereef Sahib, in reality,

1400
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:25,085
shouldn't oil be stopping mankind 
from fighting wars?

1401
01:26:25,786 --> 01:26:29,122
For example, when two objects get rusty, 
to ease out the movement,

1402
01:26:29,156 --> 01:26:31,291
we grease them.

1403
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:35,495
Door hinges, cycle chains, cycle pedals...

1404
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:37,331
So...

1405
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:40,501
It's such a paradox 
that we fight over oil,

1406
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:42,703
when oil should cease the fight.

1407
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:43,704
Of course it is.

1408
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:47,040
How much oil do you want?

1409
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,877
Ten to fifteen liters.

1410
01:26:55,249 --> 01:26:56,750
Will the war finish with ten liters?

1411
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:59,119
This is for cooking.

1412
01:27:02,122 --> 01:27:04,625
What I am trying to say to you is...

1413
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:08,328
Sometimes it is important 
to grease human relationships

1414
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:11,164
with some oil, right?

1415
01:27:12,165 --> 01:27:14,168
-What do you say? 
-Thoufeeq Sahib,

1416
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:18,205
we are not West Asia, 
so we don't want America to interfere.

1417
01:27:18,672 --> 01:27:19,873
I can handle this on my own.

1418
01:27:34,488 --> 01:27:36,490
[indistinct chattering]

1419
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:45,666
Why are we worrying 
so much about these guys?

1420
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:49,503
I would like us to improvise 
tomorrow's scenes.

1421
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:54,208
I am confident 
that it will influence Shereef.

1422
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,210
Brilliant!

1423
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:57,544
Thank you.

1424
01:27:57,578 --> 01:28:00,747
To influence the actor's heart 
through his character.

1425
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:01,582
Yes.

1426
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:03,450
This is a potent subject 
for yet another film.

1427
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,785
We can do that film later.

1428
01:28:04,918 --> 01:28:06,653
-Inshallah!  
-Inshallah!

1429
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:09,790
-[knocking on door] 
-Siraj Sahib!

1430
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,901
[mobile ringing]

1431
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:24,404
-Hello! 
-Where are you guys?

1432
01:28:24,538 --> 01:28:26,373
We are ready with the next scene.

1433
01:28:26,507 --> 01:28:29,877
We are stuck in an odd place, 
and we're unable to get out.

1434
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:32,079
But where are you?

1435
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,780
Uh, one moment.

1436
01:28:33,914 --> 01:28:34,748
Sir.

1437
01:28:35,415 --> 01:28:36,416
Sir.

1438
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,620
-What is this place called? 
-This is Kunnamangalam.

1439
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:42,589
We are at Kunnamangalam police station.

1440
01:28:42,623 --> 01:28:44,291
Pol... Police station?

1441
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,003
Raheem Sahib, what if we die here?

1442
01:28:56,036 --> 01:28:58,372
Thoufeeq, why do we imagine 
dying every now and then?

1443
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,581
What happened?

1444
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,083
Sir.

1445
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:17,791
-Filthy old man! Did I kidnap my daughter? 
-Sir, please!

1446
01:29:17,891 --> 01:29:20,527
You bloody, tell me, 
would I kidnap my own daughter!

1447
01:29:20,627 --> 01:29:23,163
You... Have you stayed 
away from your daughter?

1448
01:29:23,297 --> 01:29:26,333
-Bloody, I married your daughter! 
-Dad, ask him to leave.

1449
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:28,168
I am going to burn this house down!

1450
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:30,737
-No, don't say that. 
-I am a decent man!

1451
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:33,207
-You scoundrel, show some decency! 
-Come, sir!

1452
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,276
That's my daughter 
you are holding in your house!

1453
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,911
-Sir! 
-Leave me alone!

1454
01:29:37,911 --> 01:29:38,745
Tell me!

1455
01:29:40,914 --> 01:29:44,084
I don't know anything about the kidnapping 
and unauthorized entry,

1456
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,787
that was done by the lawyers.

1457
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:49,089
I don't have to think in this manner.

1458
01:29:49,656 --> 01:29:51,625
I don't want to trouble him,

1459
01:29:52,459 --> 01:29:55,495
I don't want to be troubled either.

1460
01:29:57,497 --> 01:30:01,502
If this becomes a case, 
he will be disturbed.

1461
01:30:01,502 --> 01:30:03,704
And that is painful for us.

1462
01:30:04,371 --> 01:30:08,208
We have taken up this project 
through crowd funding.

1463
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:14,081
A person gets drunk, 
enters the house and starts abusing.

1464
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:17,084
What is your opinion about this behavior?

1465
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:20,487
That of course is unacceptable. 
Definitely unacceptable.

1466
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:22,155
If it were you, wouldn't you sue?

1467
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,459
If someone behaves in this manner, 
my husband or not,

1468
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:27,127
I will take legal action.

1469
01:30:29,363 --> 01:30:31,632
He should not come here 
looking for my daughter.

1470
01:30:31,665 --> 01:30:32,866
That's all I want.

1471
01:30:35,335 --> 01:30:37,571
If he assures me that much, 
I will withdraw the case.

1472
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,196
Sir, shot?

1473
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:05,499
Set it up by the pond.

1474
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:14,308
Sir,

1475
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:18,579
I am somebody who handles 
human relationships with extreme caution.

1476
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:20,781
Whether it's my parents,

1477
01:31:20,914 --> 01:31:24,484
friends, relatives, children, 
my wife, colleagues...

1478
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:26,787
whoever is around me.

1479
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,123
I read books on human psychology.

1480
01:31:30,224 --> 01:31:33,293
I have even compiled a chart 
to assess my own behavior.

1481
01:31:33,827 --> 01:31:35,996
Until yesterday, I scored 100% 
according to that chart.

1482
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:38,031
Mashallah.

1483
01:31:40,734 --> 01:31:42,369
What is your problem then?

1484
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:46,039
My family and the village folk 
are all fond of me.

1485
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:50,744
That definitely is a problem.

1486
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:52,913
Right now that is not my problem.

1487
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,083
These days, my wife's face 
is sorrow ridden.

1488
01:31:56,750 --> 01:32:00,954
When I ask her, she says she is happy, 
but I know she is sad.

1489
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:05,292
Brother...

1490
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:07,494
You may be a terrific husband,

1491
01:32:08,328 --> 01:32:09,329
but...

1492
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,998
I forgot my dialogue.

1493
01:32:16,336 --> 01:32:20,874
"You may be an ideal husband, 
theoretically,

1494
01:32:20,908 --> 01:32:23,877
but if it does not reflect 
in your wife's happiness,

1495
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,746
what meaning does your perfection hold?"

1496
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:28,415
Shereef Sahib, you tell me what meaning 
does your ideal husband image hold?

1497
01:32:28,448 --> 01:32:29,750
It's simple.

1498
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:32,753
Thoufeeq, hold it. 
Just explain the dialogues, nothing more.

1499
01:32:32,786 --> 01:32:34,922
I will fix this in a few seconds.

1500
01:32:34,955 --> 01:32:35,622
Thoufeeq!

1501
01:32:37,124 --> 01:32:38,125
You think you know better?

1502
01:32:40,494 --> 01:32:42,496
Husband, wife... Nonsense!

1503
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,331
This is not going to work.

1504
01:32:45,866 --> 01:32:47,668
I need to talk to you. Shereef, come!

1505
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:49,536
Call Suhra also. Abhi.

1506
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:18,665
Siraj Sahib.

1507
01:33:22,836 --> 01:33:24,505
What I want to say to you is...

1508
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,710
When I thought 
I was going to lose my daughter,

1509
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,378
I behaved recklessly.

1510
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,381
I just had one desire.

1511
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:36,750
I wanted to see my daughter 
for a short while.

1512
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,418
I can't lose her.

1513
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:42,489
What did I gain?

1514
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,658
She went away with her mother.

1515
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,129
My pain... What I am going through

1516
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:52,833
is irrelevant for them. 
Their concerns are different.

1517
01:33:58,572 --> 01:33:59,740
Oh...

1518
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,210
Sorry, I drifted away from the topic.

1519
01:34:07,114 --> 01:34:08,415
Between you two...

1520
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:11,652
Forget it.

1521
01:34:12,085 --> 01:34:13,587
Please rehearse your scenes.

1522
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:17,991
Suhra, first, your scene.

1523
01:34:20,527 --> 01:34:22,829
This is your movie. I hope you get it!

1524
01:34:24,831 --> 01:34:25,866
Alright.

1525
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,918
They will join us after rehearsing.

1526
01:34:45,586 --> 01:34:47,321
Jaya, light up the kitchen.

1527
01:34:47,454 --> 01:34:49,456
Abhi, let's set up the kitchen scene.

1528
01:34:50,123 --> 01:34:52,693
Come on guys, 
let's get the kitchen scene ready.

1529
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:05,873
Debt does not comprise 
solely of money loans.

1530
01:35:05,906 --> 01:35:08,475
There are several things 
that may be construed as debt.

1531
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:13,080
Though it's conventional to do so, 
I have not asked for any dowry,

1532
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,748
I have not accepted it either.

1533
01:35:14,882 --> 01:35:16,183
Those are also debts.

1534
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:20,487
I have not accepted 
any of the gifts and offerings

1535
01:35:20,621 --> 01:35:22,122
your brothers-in-law received.

1536
01:35:22,589 --> 01:35:23,724
That should also be considered.

1537
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,326
I have pardoned your father 
for all those debts

1538
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,794
is what I had meant to say.

1539
01:35:29,296 --> 01:35:32,199
Please don't fall so low.

1540
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:36,069
You are the father of my children.

1541
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:39,706
What do you lack here?

1542
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,042
I have no bad habits.

1543
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:44,244
I am religious and helpful.

1544
01:35:44,278 --> 01:35:46,079
You and your family 
were convinced of my virtues

1545
01:35:46,113 --> 01:35:47,748
at the time of our wedding.

1546
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:52,452
But I did not marry you solely 
because I am a helpful person.

1547
01:35:52,486 --> 01:35:54,955
I was certain 
that you are a good match for me.

1548
01:35:54,988 --> 01:35:56,790
It was not just an act of kindness.

1549
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,526
If you were so sure I was the one,

1550
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:01,495
why did you have to see me twice 
before agreeing to the marriage?

1551
01:36:01,528 --> 01:36:02,863
That's because, 
when I met you the first time,

1552
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:04,665
I felt you were a bit short.

1553
01:36:04,798 --> 01:36:06,834
I believe that 
one should not marry someone

1554
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:08,235
merely as an act of kindness.

1555
01:36:09,536 --> 01:36:12,072
You tell me what's lacking for you here. 
I will fix it.

1556
01:36:13,473 --> 01:36:15,209
I lack nothing here.

1557
01:36:15,309 --> 01:36:16,710
Everything is a bit too much!

1558
01:36:17,044 --> 01:36:19,046
Could you lessen that a bit?

1559
01:36:22,749 --> 01:36:24,585
Just because your name means "decent,"

1560
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:26,653
it doesn't mean you are always right.

1561
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:29,957
Only when you are willing 
to admit your mistakes,

1562
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:31,625
you can talk to me.

1563
01:36:50,777 --> 01:36:55,349
"For the first time that day"

1564
01:36:55,415 --> 01:36:59,620
"A jasmine bloomed in my garden"

1565
01:37:01,088 --> 01:37:05,292
"A man wrote on a woman"

1566
01:37:05,325 --> 01:37:10,297
"His first word of love"

1567
01:37:10,697 --> 01:37:15,068
"The fragrance of love embraces me"

1568
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:18,505
"Flapping its wings like a butterfly"

1569
01:37:57,578 --> 01:38:01,081
"For the first time, I see"

1570
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:07,154
"My heart flower like a forest"

1571
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:13,493
"For the first time, my memories bleed"

1572
01:38:13,627 --> 01:38:17,331
"Into a song of despair, 
Like a cuckoo's song"

1573
01:38:17,464 --> 01:38:20,000
"A few untouched rays of sun, 
Finally touch me"

1574
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,402
"A few drops of tears, finally drench me"

1575
01:38:22,536 --> 01:38:26,373
"Unseen, I sob, 
Like gasps of an afternoon breeze"

1576
01:38:26,373 --> 01:38:28,876
-Shall we rehearse? 
-What?

1577
01:38:30,444 --> 01:38:31,912
Let's rehearse our scenes.

1578
01:38:41,989 --> 01:38:46,793
"Night after night"

1579
01:38:46,827 --> 01:38:51,298
"And then, this day 
A jasmine blooms in my garden"

1580
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:56,737
"Petal by petal"

1581
01:38:56,870 --> 01:39:01,041
"My garden is in full bloom"

1582
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:04,745
"Like nature"

1583
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:06,747
"Cosmically"

1584
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,451
"Our love evolves"

1585
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:21,161
What you just told me 
is not in the script, right?

1586
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:22,329
Yes.

1587
01:39:22,329 --> 01:39:23,864
But it's really good.

1588
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:26,166
You must share it with Thoufeeq Sahib.

1589
01:39:26,266 --> 01:39:28,502
Not yet, I will give him 
a surprise during the shoot.

1590
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:32,573
Surprise him only after you improve 
your acting skills.

1591
01:39:37,044 --> 01:39:38,912
Is my acting that poor?

1592
01:39:41,615 --> 01:39:43,584
You have talent,

1593
01:39:43,584 --> 01:39:45,953
but sometimes you overact.

1594
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,789
Like that day?

1595
01:39:48,922 --> 01:39:52,125
When I said I condone your father's debts.

1596
01:39:57,331 --> 01:39:58,498
You know what?

1597
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:02,002
That day, you acted with your head,

1598
01:40:02,703 --> 01:40:03,737
not with your feelings.

1599
01:40:12,379 --> 01:40:14,248
How on earth are you so bright?

1600
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:17,584
This is not exceptional brilliance,

1601
01:40:17,618 --> 01:40:18,752
this is available in that book.

1602
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,869
Raheem Sahib, I am fearful of the outcome.

1603
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:39,206
To realize our crazy passionate dream, 
we raised money from so many people.

1604
01:40:39,339 --> 01:40:41,375
What if it does not 
turn out the way we expect?

1605
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:44,578
Thoufeeq, such thoughts have no relevance. 
We will complete shoot today.

1606
01:40:46,413 --> 01:40:47,915
We have not seen the film yet.

1607
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:50,751
We will only know what we have made 
after the final edits.

1608
01:40:51,618 --> 01:40:53,287
We should not face embarrassment 
because of this movie.

1609
01:40:54,922 --> 01:40:56,723
Thoufeeq, don't lose hope.

1610
01:40:57,224 --> 01:40:58,458
You are my anchor.

1611
01:41:04,631 --> 01:41:08,735
We should just have served biriyani, 
the chicken fry was extravagant.

1612
01:41:10,704 --> 01:41:12,873
Are you looking 
for reasons to get stressed?

1613
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,209
Let people eat happily, Thoufeeq.

1614
01:41:15,209 --> 01:41:18,745
True! Let them eat, happily!

1615
01:41:21,682 --> 01:41:23,417
-Thoufeeq Sahib? 
-Yes.

1616
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:25,986
-They are asking for you. 
-Okay, I'm coming.

1617
01:41:26,587 --> 01:41:28,322
Guys, come closer. Try it once.

1618
01:41:29,256 --> 01:41:30,390
Hug.

1619
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:32,860
Hug, you guys!

1620
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,994
Like that.

1621
01:41:34,127 --> 01:41:35,495
This will be the final position.

1622
01:41:35,629 --> 01:41:36,797
Okay, enough.

1623
01:41:37,497 --> 01:41:39,333
Yeah, this will be nice. 
It will work out.

1624
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:41,502
-Enough, leave him now. 
-Siraj brother?

1625
01:41:41,502 --> 01:41:42,569
Yes.

1626
01:41:43,337 --> 01:41:44,371
I heard you were asking for me.

1627
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:48,041
I have changed the script a little, 
please have a look.

1628
01:42:00,254 --> 01:42:02,256
What happened? You don't like it?

1629
01:42:02,623 --> 01:42:04,324
We will have to avoid the hugging scene.

1630
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:06,126
Why?

1631
01:42:11,498 --> 01:42:13,200
We can't have a hugging scene 
in this movie.

1632
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:15,002
That's cruel, brother!

1633
01:42:15,002 --> 01:42:17,204
Husband and wife are meeting 
after such a long gap,

1634
01:42:17,237 --> 01:42:18,405
why can't they hug?

1635
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:19,706
I am not being cruel,

1636
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,209
I deliberately want to avoid scenes 
that involves touching.

1637
01:42:22,209 --> 01:42:25,412
But they are a real life couple! 
What's wrong if they hug each other?

1638
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:28,215
This is what you wrote in the script too.

1639
01:42:30,017 --> 01:42:31,985
What did I write?

1640
01:42:32,786 --> 01:42:35,923
Abhi, please read out 
what I have corrected in the script.

1641
01:42:35,956 --> 01:42:39,459
My problem is not with 
you rewriting the scene...

1642
01:42:39,526 --> 01:42:41,795
Read it aloud, Abhi.

1643
01:42:42,296 --> 01:42:46,166
"The couple meet after several days 
and look at each other with longing."

1644
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,669
And then they hug,

1645
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:49,903
that's all I added.

1646
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:52,239
Does anybody here have any reservations?

1647
01:42:52,372 --> 01:42:54,141
Is there anything wrong with it?

1648
01:42:56,043 --> 01:42:59,079
In this movie, we can't have scenes 
displaying sexual connotation.

1649
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:00,914
Hello, mister,

1650
01:43:00,914 --> 01:43:03,750
you must not assume 
that people hug only to have sex.

1651
01:43:05,152 --> 01:43:06,954
No point talking to you about this.

1652
01:43:06,954 --> 01:43:08,121
Shereef, Suhra,

1653
01:43:08,155 --> 01:43:10,057
is every hug meant to end up in sex?

1654
01:43:10,123 --> 01:43:10,791
Uh...

1655
01:43:11,725 --> 01:43:12,693
Siraj brother...

1656
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,829
Keep quiet for a bit. 
Let me discuss this with them.

1657
01:43:16,296 --> 01:43:19,666
Usually, I would not have such discussions 
with professional actors.

1658
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,735
You guys are husband and wife 
in real life.

1659
01:43:22,503 --> 01:43:24,505
Do you guys need time to think?

1660
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,541
Give us some time.

1661
01:43:29,276 --> 01:43:30,711
Then, think.

1662
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:33,413
Raheem Sahib!

1663
01:43:44,124 --> 01:43:48,829
Haven't we ever hugged other than for sex?

1664
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:54,668
We usually hug and then have sex.

1665
01:43:55,736 --> 01:43:59,406
Well, I don't consider hugging for sex 
as a bad thing.

1666
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,707
However...

1667
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:03,544
what about our desire to hug 
when we are happy or sad,

1668
01:44:03,577 --> 01:44:06,079
for an affectionate casual hug?

1669
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:07,748
Hmm.

1670
01:44:09,283 --> 01:44:11,752
We have lived here five-six years

1671
01:44:12,252 --> 01:44:14,955
in the company of my parents and siblings.

1672
01:44:14,955 --> 01:44:15,923
Yes.

1673
01:44:16,423 --> 01:44:18,125
Somehow, even after it became just us,

1674
01:44:18,225 --> 01:44:21,128
I ended up continuing the manners 
we followed in front of them.

1675
01:44:22,796 --> 01:44:28,001
I have pondered several times 
whether to hug you, like we see in films.

1676
01:44:28,669 --> 01:44:30,671
And I have desired it too.

1677
01:44:36,877 --> 01:44:38,879
What should we do with this scene?

1678
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:40,214
Should we hug?

1679
01:44:40,914 --> 01:44:43,083
I don't have a problem hugging you.

1680
01:44:44,484 --> 01:44:47,487
But if you hug another woman 
in any other movie,

1681
01:44:47,754 --> 01:44:49,156
I won't accept it.

1682
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:50,457
Even I won't accept it.

1683
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:54,862
Are we ready to do the hugging scene?

1684
01:44:56,797 --> 01:45:00,167
Will it be an embarrassment 
for our organization?

1685
01:45:03,003 --> 01:45:04,738
When we consider that aspect,

1686
01:45:04,872 --> 01:45:06,006
let's not do it.

1687
01:45:17,251 --> 01:45:18,585
What is the problem?

1688
01:45:18,752 --> 01:45:20,754
-He wants to add a hugging scene.-Allah!

1689
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:23,323
We can't do that!

1690
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,293
In that case, it's not possible to shoot.

1691
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,629
Don't take such a strict stand.

1692
01:45:29,463 --> 01:45:31,999
How can you walk out 
in the middle of a discussion?

1693
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:35,068
Especially when this discussion is meant 
to contribute meaningfully to art.

1694
01:45:35,169 --> 01:45:36,036
Art?

1695
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,672
This is not art, 
this is destruction of art!

1696
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:44,912
You had problem 
with strangers acting together

1697
01:45:45,045 --> 01:45:48,081
and opted for a real life couple.

1698
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:49,850
Now you have a problem 
with them embracing as well.

1699
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,251
Do you want a real life couple 
to act like strangers

1700
01:45:51,318 --> 01:45:52,953
I don't get this at all!

1701
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,589
Abhi, this does not suit us.

1702
01:45:57,624 --> 01:45:59,960
Art is not unidimensional.

1703
01:45:59,993 --> 01:46:03,197
Art is not a path set in one direction.

1704
01:46:03,797 --> 01:46:06,500
We need to understand that 
there is something called imagination,

1705
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,203
and that imagination has power. 
You claim to be an artist,

1706
01:46:09,203 --> 01:46:11,572
you need to understand this 
more than anyone.

1707
01:46:11,705 --> 01:46:13,207
This is not bloody imagination.

1708
01:46:13,307 --> 01:46:16,043
What imagination? 
What you are saying is not cinema.

1709
01:46:16,109 --> 01:46:18,579
It is not cinema! 
It is nothing, it is nonsense!

1710
01:46:19,746 --> 01:46:22,115
You are just deceiving people.

1711
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:25,586
I can't do this...

1712
01:46:27,988 --> 01:46:29,156
Siraj brother,

1713
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:30,791
if we had to shoot 
what you are now wanting,

1714
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:32,626
why did I have to struggle so much?

1715
01:46:32,659 --> 01:46:34,828
I would have made a regular movie.

1716
01:46:34,828 --> 01:46:36,630
There are some people here who believe

1717
01:46:36,663 --> 01:46:39,600
that somethings shouldn't be seen 
or heard.

1718
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,870
The purpose of this movie 
is to fulfill their aspirations.

1719
01:46:43,003 --> 01:46:45,205
Don't people like us 
deserve to watch films?

1720
01:46:45,205 --> 01:46:46,740
Don't we deserve to make films?

1721
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:49,576
This is beyond my comprehension.

1722
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,378
I don't believe in such things.

1723
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:53,614
It's difficult to do 
what I don't understand.

1724
01:46:53,747 --> 01:46:54,915
I don't know how to do it.

1725
01:46:55,349 --> 01:46:57,150
Please try to understand us as well.

1726
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:03,891
I will give you what you need.

1727
01:47:04,892 --> 01:47:06,460
Also, I will give you what you need.

1728
01:47:07,327 --> 01:47:09,363
And what I want, I will take.

1729
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:10,831
Bring it.

1730
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:15,169
What is it that you are going to take?

1731
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:18,839
See.

1732
01:47:19,406 --> 01:47:20,641
They can hug...

1733
01:47:21,642 --> 01:47:23,877
They can also hug 
without hugging...

1734
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:25,746
They can hug...

1735
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:27,614
or not hug.

1736
01:47:36,323 --> 01:47:38,458
They can hug without hugging.

1737
01:47:39,026 --> 01:47:41,662
We need not hug and yet hug.

1738
01:47:42,963 --> 01:47:44,298
Okay, so let's embrace that idea.

1739
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,200
How will we shoot this?

1740
01:47:50,704 --> 01:47:51,572
I will shoot it.

1741
01:47:54,074 --> 01:47:55,409
Jaggu, come on, brother.

1742
01:47:59,913 --> 01:48:01,248
Sir, this guy is tripping.

1743
01:48:01,381 --> 01:48:03,917
Let it be whatever...

1744
01:49:17,824 --> 01:49:19,793
-Ready, sir! 
-First frame.

1745
01:49:31,839 --> 01:49:33,040
Sir, orders!

1746
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:34,141
Lights off!

1747
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:37,411
-Camera. 
-Rolling, sir.

1748
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:39,279
And action!

1749
01:50:00,667 --> 01:50:02,002
Where were you?

1750
01:50:04,705 --> 01:50:05,739
Very far.

1751
01:50:07,307 --> 01:50:08,542
Why did you go so far away?

1752
01:50:10,878 --> 01:50:13,046
I was always far, 
even when I was near you

1753
01:50:16,517 --> 01:50:19,586
Its only when I went this far, 
I knew how close I was to you.

1754
01:50:22,456 --> 01:50:23,991
How far are you now?

1755
01:50:32,866 --> 01:50:34,334
Closer than the closest.

1756
01:50:35,235 --> 01:50:36,904
Can you get even closer?

1757
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,776
Yes, we can.

1758
01:50:44,044 --> 01:50:45,245
How much closer?

1759
01:50:49,183 --> 01:50:51,418
Until there is no distance left 
between us?

1760
01:51:08,902 --> 01:51:10,704
Hey! Cut, cut, cut!

1761
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:12,873
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

1762
01:51:14,074 --> 01:51:15,309
Cut! Cut!

1763
01:51:15,375 --> 01:51:16,109
Cut!

1764
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:18,612
Cut!

1765
01:51:19,613 --> 01:51:20,547
Lights on.

1766
01:51:22,683 --> 01:51:24,084
-Thoufeeq Sahib. 
-Yes.

1767
01:51:24,084 --> 01:51:26,587
I placed the first cut 
before they hugged each other.

1768
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:27,988
Halal cut done!

1769
01:51:28,589 --> 01:51:30,224
Alhamdulillah!

1770
01:51:31,225 --> 01:51:32,125
Pack up!

1771
01:51:32,626 --> 01:51:33,861
Tell them also, it's over.

1772
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:36,663
Thoufeeq, we are finally done filming!

1773
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:38,432
Brilliant! Superb!

1774
01:52:21,308 --> 01:52:22,276
-Cut! 
-Cut!

1775
01:52:22,943 --> 01:52:24,778
Fantastic! Super!

1776
01:52:28,415 --> 01:52:30,784
-Assalamualaikum.  
 -Walaikum Assalam Rahmatullah.

1777
01:52:30,918 --> 01:52:32,753
Raheem, I called to ask you for a fatwa.

1778
01:52:32,786 --> 01:52:33,487
Yes.

1779
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:35,622
They are going to show  
 our movie shortly.

1780
01:52:35,656 --> 01:52:37,157
That was the call for Maghrib.

1781
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:40,327
Can I combine Maghrib with Isha?

1782
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:43,163
My dearest, Shaheel, 
as long as you pray, all is good.

1783
01:52:43,297 --> 01:52:44,331
Alright then, bye!

1784
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:47,167
Dad, can we pray after the movie?

1785
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:52,039
Farooq, recite Iqamat.

1786
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:53,473
[reciting "Iqamat"]

1787
01:53:01,615 --> 01:53:03,250
Shall we switch off the TV?

1788
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:05,586
Let it play. It's on mute.

1789
01:53:09,957 --> 01:53:11,458
Allahu Akbar!
