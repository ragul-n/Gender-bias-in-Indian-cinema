1
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,395
This is the worst time of
the modern generation.

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,874
Crime has now become
like a fashion.

3
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,474
Now a days everybody..

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,282
...are dreaming to become..

5
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,122
...the most wanted criminal
or a don.

6
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,259
Whereas sitting in a don's chair..

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,265
...is like riding on a tiger.

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,567
There is danger in riding a tiger.

9
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,511
And if you ride on one..

10
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:24,081
...it takes you to a very
dense forests of crimes.

11
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,284
And to return from it..

12
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,045
...is impossible.

13
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,617
If one wants to get down
from the ride..

14
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,087
...the same tiger..

15
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,122
...will eat him up.

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,969
The top most criminal
of this town..

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,138
...or the don..

18
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,033
...is called..

19
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,373
...the Yamraaj.

20
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,618
Greetings Yamraaj.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,287
We got a lot of money from
the film industry.

22
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,226
But I swear those who didn't
give me the money..

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,820
...I killed them all.

24
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,002
After doing bomb-blasts around
the whole country..

25
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,263
...I have also started riots
at different places.

26
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,041
Weapons have been distributed
all across India.

27
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,906
But our drug's consignment have
been caught by the police.

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,554
The Yamraaj above..

29
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,159
...has to give orders.

30
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,529
So that he can turn
anyone's life..

31
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,466
...to death.

32
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,195
But Yamraaj present down here..

33
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,864
...doesn't wait for anybody's
permission.

34
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,499
He himself..

35
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,143
...makes the decision.

36
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,513
Shouts in pain.

37
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,966
Everybody has the right to dream.

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,874
But you don't run behind
those dreams..

39
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,476
...which will lead
you to a suicide.

40
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,345
Yamraaj.l didn't get your point.

41
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,008
He was a very valuable man for us.

42
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,212
Yamraaj.Today was his birthday.

43
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,987
If he a had a dream
to become Yamraaj..

44
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,926
...then I wouldn't have
did this to him.

45
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,087
He tried to become the Yamraaj.

46
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,034
This is a good thing
that his birthday..

47
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,099
...and the day he died...

48
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,933
...will be remembered
at the same day.

49
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,477
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,450
Happy birthday to you.

What happened? -Place your bets..

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,548
...Hey little master,

69
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,516

70
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,280
Such a small guy playing big!

00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,911
Show the card!

72
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,005
Oh, Great!

73
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,507
You guys have cheated!
You've changed the card!

74
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,017
Give me my money back or I'll call
all my 4 younger brothers!

75
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,020
Have your brothers come
in laps or cradles?

76
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,955
I'll show you how they'll come!

77
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:50,040
Hey Krishna,
where have these giants come from?

78
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,121
Me? -Nothing to worry!

79
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,861
Get that idiot down!

80
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,145
Hail Yamraaj, hail Yamraaj!

81
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,083
Among all gods!

82
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:26,381
Yamraaj is the only god who
doesn't have a second name!

83
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,227
Nor Ji, neither Batu.

84
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,656
& not even in the beginning..

85
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,893
...Shree is being used
because Yamraaj!

86
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,063
Itself is the full name!

87
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,898
Yamraaj, is only..

88
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:51,016
...Yamraaj!
- Hail Yamraaj, hail Yamraaj!

89
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,312
What style, what reputation!

90
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,687
My friend,
he's the boss of the city!

91
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,053
What do we have?

92
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,195
Nothing!
We grew up in the orphanage..

93
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,232
...No mother,no father,no money
& no relatives! Nothing!

94
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,471
Friend, lets do one thing!

95
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,837
Lets pursue a dream!

96
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,577
One day,
we'll be the kings of the city!

97
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:31,049
Yeah! Hail Yamraaj, hail Yamraaj..

98
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,941
Bharti! Inspector Bharti!

99
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:58,584
This silly inspector
is always behind us!

100
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,009
Stupid guy! He's coming here!

101
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,086
Let him come,
he's not going to eat us!

102
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,017
I am know as Inspector
Dharamveer Bharti!

103
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,921
Hello!

104
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,293
I'm an Inspector by profession
but a poet by heart!

105
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,466
Here's a poem!

106
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,261
The weather of your
city is beautiful!

107
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,597
May I have your little time,
if you don't mind!

108
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,867
Very good, very good!

109
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,036
What are you guys doing here?

110
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,305
We were dreaming!

111
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,347
Of being a Yamraaj!

112
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,886
How did he know about our dream!
Wow!

113
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,916
The most powerful criminal of this
city is known as Yamraaj!

114
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,084
Every kid knows this!

115
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,889
But,
I have an opinion for you guys!

116
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,161
Do not dream of being a Yamraaj!

117
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,599
Its like riding a tiger!

118
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,267
Every step is dangerous!

119
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,140
Yes, maybe you are right!

120
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,409
But, how does it matter,
riding it for once?

121
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,048
What do you say? -Yes,
we'll get off, when we feel like!

122
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:11,346
The most dagerous thing about
riding a tiger is..

123
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:18,158
...whenever someone tries to get
off, the tiger kills him!

124
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,301
So I want you to be good citizens!

125
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,967
Hearts are being broken away!

126
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,637
The one's that cannot be broken
are being rejected!

127
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,012
No matter how deep the roots are..

128
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,105
...it is difficult
to stand upright!

129
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,144
The trees which don't grow..

130
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,112
...Are chopped down!

131
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,020
I'm sick of his poems!

132
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,287
He could've hit us a little!
- He's crazy!

133
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,221
He's providing mirrors
in the city of blinds!

134
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,021
Krishna!

135
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,558
Hey brother, your lover is here!

136
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,363
See you later!
- You go on, I'll leave!

137
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,261
What is it? -What!

138
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,338
You're being egotistic!
Why don't you meet me these days?

139
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,107
What are you saying,
I meet you everyday!

140
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,436
How can you understand!

141
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,982
Without you every second
is like a day!

142
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,609
Don't bother me with those
filmy dialogues! -Darn it!

143
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,188
Is there anything called romance
or love in your life?

144
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,553
A beautiful damsel is
standing before you..

145
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,385
...& your playing with this stick!

146
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,055
What's the use of such a damsel,
who I can't even touch?

147
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,600
At least, I can touch this stick!

148
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,929
The Romeo & Juliet style
of yours is outdated!

149
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,869
I don't like this style!

150
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,033
What style do you like?

151
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,135
I like it hardcore style!

152
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,372
You like hardcore style? -Yes

153
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,179
Do you actually mean it?
- Absolutely!

154
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,983
Oh, really!
- Not hear, people are watching..

155
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,216
...Not here, what are you doing?
- Let them see!

156
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,893
Now you watch my style!

157
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,965
What are you doing?
Aren't you ashamed?

158
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:42,202
Hey my sweetheart
you're so pretty!

159
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:47,109
Hey my sweetheart

160
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,308

00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:11,297
Hey my sweetheart you're so cute!

165
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,431
Such a cute boy that

166
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,308
You make me crazy,crazy!

167
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:26,249
You make me crazy,crazy!
You make me crazy,crazy!

168
00:16:54,947 --> 00:17:00,010
You're so cute that I can't
take my eyes off you!

169
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,456
You're so cute that I can't
take my eyes off you!

170
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:14,522
You're so pretty that I can't
take my eyes off you!

171
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,594
What are you thinking,
come be my sweetheart!

172
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:23,137
You make me crazy,crazy!
You make me crazy,crazy!

173
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:28,510
You make me crazy,crazy!
You make me crazy,crazy!

174
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:58,143
I'm scared of pretty
girls likes you!

175
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:07,447
I'm scared of pretty

Oh my god, Kishan!
You've killed my friend!

186
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,591
Now,
who's going to see me get married!

187
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,993
Can't you see & walk?

188
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,002
You've killed my friend!

189
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,571
He's not dead yet!
- What if he was dead?

190
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,434
Hey, listen to me! -Oh, my bone!

191
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,978
My friend has broken a bone!

192
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,171
Its not yet broken!
- What if, it was?

193
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,819
OK listen, I'll give you 2
thousand rupees! -2 thousand!

194
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,619
L'll_file a complai_n yvith the

195
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,327
Listen, I'll give you 5 thousand
rupees for this jerk!

196
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,093
No, give me 10 thousand rupees,
I'll settle it down!

197
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,335
10 thousand for this jerk!
- Police! -1 minute!

198
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,366
You come with me, I'll give you
the money! -You get well!

199
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,497
OK! -I don't know where do
such jerks come from!

200
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,832
Take this 10 thousand rupees
& leave me alone!

201
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,590
Are you giving me alms?
- Don't call the police!

202
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,557
OK, leave it!

203
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,662
Where do such jerks come from!

204
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,465
Let me count it!

205
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,105
We screwed him for Rs 10,000!
- Actuallt we robbed him totally!

206
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,198
Here, open this!

207
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,040
This bag is heavy!

208
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:52,414
What is it? -Its cocaine!

209
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,383
Cocaine, what can we get for this?

210
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,056
Our dreams are about to fulfill!

211
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,215
How is that going to happen,
who will we sell this?

212
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you remember Banwari!

213
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,858
Hello sister-in-law!

214
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,934
How are you Banwari?
How are you dear?

215
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,198
You guys sit,
I'll leave them & come!

216
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,543
Its so boring to wait like this!
- You're right!

217
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,044
When will he come?

218
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,917
What is it? -What's your name?

219
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:44,595
I'm the one you'll
love to be with!

220
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,939
I guess she's spell bounded you!

221
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:54,674
& if I don't charm her
than I'm not a man!

222
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,916
If your interested in such stuff..

223
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,350
...I'm here for you!

224
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,622
You talk good!

225
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,395
I can be a good lover too!

226
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,830
You're too confident but you are
yet to have your success!

227
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,899
You cannot touch the moon yet!

228
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,073
I spend more than you earn
in years together..

229
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,907
...in just one night!

230
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,006
You're confident but you should
earn your success first!

231
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,915
& than talk to me, jerk!

232
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:43,088
Now that you've talked
about success!

233
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,159
Then I'll tell you one thing!

234
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,494
I'm from Bihar!

235
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,260
I look like a jerk to you!

236
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,600
You say you're a moon &
I can't even touch you!

237
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,976
Yo_u haven't seen this
jerk's power yet!

238
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,015
One clay,
I'll come with lots money!

239
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,944
Than I won't touch you
as if you're a moon!

240
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,578
I'll squeeze you like a lemon!

241
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,114
Good luck!

242
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,152
Birju, lets go!

243
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,057
She call me a jerk!

244
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,324
Come lets go,
he's seems to be angry!

245
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,331
She call me a jerk! OK!

246
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,576
Your first mistake is that
you stole our stuff!

247
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:44,489
& the second mistake is that
you're here to sell it to us!

248
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:50,286
The punishment for which is death!

249
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,888
Oh my god, I'm scared!

250
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,556
What do you think?

251
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:02,068
Hearing to the word death,
we'll be scared!

252
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,567
Its a mistake!

253
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,572
What will you do?

254
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,384
We're here with the stuff
& we'll leave with it!

255
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,315
Change your decision, look around!

256
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,356
Death is all around you!

257
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:26,897
I don't care for death,
eventually its going to come!

258
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,525
If its coming for once,
let it come!

259
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,104
Death scares the one's,
who have families!

260
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,168
Shall we leave!

261
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,278
Leave the bag there
or we'll shoot you!

262
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:49,479
You can shoot us but is it
necessary that we'll be hurt?

263
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:56,325
The way this bag has reached you,
I hope not the bullets do!

264
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:02,565
Use you're brains,
if that's possible, why not this?

265
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,004
They're wasting our time,
I think we should kill them!

266
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,935
You'll work for our boss!

267
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,806
First, decide for this stuff!

268
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,609
You'll get the money for
it but answer me first!

269
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,577
We're ready!

270
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,516
I couldn't return you're
money on time!

271
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,855
Forgive me, give me sometime!

272
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,564
I'll return all your money back!

273
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,967
Forgive me Mr.Yamraaj,
for god sake, forgive me!

274
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,543
Forgive me Mr.Yamraaj!

275
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,224
Relax!

276
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,134
Sir, there the one's,
I was talking about!

277
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,802
Si"

278
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,144
You are best at this game!

279
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,295
Tell me, where's the queen?

280
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,095
In the middle!

281
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,338
You're right!

282
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,317
This is Anthony Dicosta's address.

283
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,452
Get his stuff to me
by tomorrow night!

284
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,123
Wen do <i>m</i> -Go!

285
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,430
I cannot understand this,
How could you give them the job!

286
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,850
Such tigers..

287
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,846
...shouldn't be left alone!

288
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:41,217
Either, they should be killed
or they should be chained!

289
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,392
I gave the work because..

290
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,625
...if they're not powerful than
Anthony would kill them!

291
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,602
& if they are powerful then
we'll gain profits!

292
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,344
Then we'll trap them
in a golden cage!

293
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,508
Tonight is the decisions
of they're life!

294
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,222
From today onwards, I'm not
working for Raghuraj Singh!

295
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:17,919
From today, I'm the Yamraaj of
this city, Anthony Dicosta!

296
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,422
Great!

297
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,595
Very good boys,good!

298
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:11,573
Anthony Dicosta had been
cheating on us!

299
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,279
You've done a good work
teaching him a lesson!

300
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:22,644
From today,
you're into Yamraaj's gang!

301
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,117
Sir, you should be thankful to me!

302
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,052
I was the one,
who brought them to you!

303
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,323
What does a pimp do?

304
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,294
Sir, they make betels!

305
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,395
You do the same!
On this ocassion..

306
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,933
...I give you 5 lac as a reward!

307
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,355
Come, lets go!

308
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,955
We're dead! -Hey Birju, Krishna!

309
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,299
Hey sky,
I'm not afraid of you're god!

310
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,372
Hey earth,
I'm afraid of you're humans!

311
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,604
Finally,
you choose not to listen to me!

312
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,242
& went on to ride the tiger!

313
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,149
You're mitaken!

314
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,087
Yes we're leaving a
very siple life!

315
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,589
What is in this bag?

316
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,924
We've seen after a long time!

317
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,021
Lets have a chat,
this bag is not going anywhere!

318
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,659
Absolutely right!
We've been taking you're favors!

319
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,495
We may even need it in the future,
try to understand!

320
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,598
The problem is, for how long
should we work for free?

321
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,907
We should talk of some
give & take business!

322
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,144
I bring a smile on the
face of the poor!

323
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,376
I'm not salable!

324
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,351
Tell me what is in the bag?

325
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,957
There's nothing in this bag,that
you'd like to know, sir!

326
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,391
I say, open up the bag!

327
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,189
Open it, you open it!

328
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,230
You open it, you open it..

329
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,858
Shut up!
& now open the bag,come on!

330
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,598
I said there was nothing
in this bag!

331
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,208
If you think this interests
you than take it!

332
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,078
This won't work for long enough!

333
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,015
Someday you'll have to come
for my forgivness!

334
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,049
Will such a day come, Krishna?

335
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,024
It'll come, for sure!

336
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,622
You both will come
for my forgivness!

337
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:51,935
You won't bow before anyone!

338
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,132
But not me!

339
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,569
& there are those who
bow before everyone!

340
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,405
But not us!

341
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,410
Great!

342
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,083
He was left behind saying poems!

343
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,092
& we fooled him!

344
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,830
Hey Krishna!

345
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,824
<i>L</i> am going to pay back!

346
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,028
The one we call revenge!

Hello Hamid!-Hello dear!
- How are you?

408
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,282
Hello!

409
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,257
Hello mother!

410
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,487
God bless you, son!

411
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,824
Shama! -Yes?

412
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,422
Make some tea for me,
meanwhile, I'll change my clothes!

413
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,134
Hey!

414
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,173
Why are you late today?

415
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,412
Yes, I'm late today.

416
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,841
Today I raided Yamraaj's
indrapuri godown!

417
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,614
It took me long in confiscating
the illegal stuff!

418
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,011
Anyways,
did you take mother to the doctor?

419
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,983
Yes! -What did he say?

420
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,618
Don't bother about me,
take care of his illness!

421
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,989
Its better to look after
the young than the old!

422
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,064
Mother, please don't talk like
this! God is with us!

423
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,172
I hope you remember,tomorrow is
the first clay of the festival!

424
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,574
Yes, I remember it properly!

425
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,643
I can never forget this festival!

426
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,316
Father,
what is this festival about?

427
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,319
Son,
this festival is about fasting.

428
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,384
But, why does one fast?

429
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,115
If you fast for 30 days..

430
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,118
...Then whatever you ask for,
god will give it to you!

431
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,853
But how will he give? He never
comes down from the heaven!

432
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,261
God will send an angel to you!

433
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,862
& the angel will fulfill
all your wishes!

434
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,500
How would the angel be?

435
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,429
He'll be like a human, son!

436
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,904
But better than any human!

437
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,477
Than this festival is very nice.
- Yes, my son!

438
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,208
Other than this there are many
other good things about it!

439
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,044
Tell me what are they, father?

440
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:11,562
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

441
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,463
I'll tell you a story!

442
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:20,573
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

443
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:25,206
This is the..

444
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,981
...This is the most wonderful
festival!

445
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:34,320
This is the most wonderful
festival!

446
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:41,229
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

447
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:48,363
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

448
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:02,009
Honesty is the best policy!

449
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,818
Honesty is the best policy!

450
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:11,361
Such people are closer to god!

451
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:16,059
Such people are closer to god!

452
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,626
He takes..

453
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:25,240
...He takes care of such people!

454
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:29,939
He takes care of such people!

455
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:34,609
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

456
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,979
I'll tell you a story!

457
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:44,323
Listen to me my dear,
I'll tell you a story!

458
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,328
Today again inspector Hamid
has confiscated our stuff!

459
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,631
Sir,ever since he's been here,it
is difficult for us to work!

460
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,201
Neither does he accept bribe..

461
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,670
...Nor does he fear intimidation!

462
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,501
Now,
you tell us, what should we do!

463
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,516
Sir, we should remember that he..

464
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,478
...is a very honest police officer!

465
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,082
Which is why the whole department
is behind him.

466
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,858
That is why this chore is
very dangerous & risky!

467
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,620
So the one who does this chore!

468
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,027
I'll give him the whole
idrapuri area!

469
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,103
Sir, that area is mine!

470
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:31,635
If you take it away from
me than I'll be hurt!

471
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,384
Have you ever seen
the chair keenly!

472
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,146
A chair has..

473
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,152
"Hands"

474
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,086
...legs..

475
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,957
...a back..

476
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,425
...but a chair does
not have a heart!

477
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,893
This chair..

478
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,470
...Is not for the one's with heart!

479
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,835
Its only for the one's
with determination!

480
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,908
Who among you will do this chore?

481
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,206
I'll do it!

482
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,604
Great!

483
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,182
I'll do this chore!

484
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,054
You'll play with danger
& I'll watch..

485
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,818
...I can't do that!

486
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,882
I'll play with danger, first!

487
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,329
Hey, Salim dear, how are you,son?

488
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,125
Are you having fun
keeping the fasts?

489
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,896
Yes, I'm having fun but
I'm a little hungry!

490
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,403
The sun is about to set,
I'll get you some delicacies!

491
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,269
Why have you not got
the delicacies yet?

492
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,434
I'll get it soon! Here take him.

493
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,439
It would've been good if you
could've got it with you!

494
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,881
You wouldn't had to go twice!

495
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,041
Mother!

496
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,445
If I go out & buy things
wearing this uniform!

497
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,018
Then people might take
less money from me!

498
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,185
Or maybe being scared
of this uniform..

499
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,851
...They give me more than required!

500
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,291
This would be as taking a bribe!

501
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:58,984
God bless you, son!

502
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,527
I'll go change my clothes.

503
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,370
Hello! -How are you?

504
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,064
Hello brother Hamid! -Hello!

505
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,076
Hello -Hello!

506
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,278
How are you? -All good!

507
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,848
Yes brother!

508
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,488
How much for these bananas?

509
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,960
1 more kg!

510
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,477
Hello! -Hello, Hello!

511
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,980
Yes brother!

512
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,381
Give me some of those.
- Hello Mr.Hamid!

513
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,115
<i>Hello,hello!</i>

514
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,195
Why did you kill me?

515
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,539
Why did you kill me?

516
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:26,281
He's dying,
than too he's so strong!

517
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:32,014
He's dying,
than too he's so strong!

518
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:37,219
He's leaving this festival!

519
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:42,629
He's leaving this festival!

520
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,929
How could he..

521
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:53,135
...How could he even take a sip!

522
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:58,306
How could he even take a sip!

523
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,582
Mummy, when will father come?

524
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,820
Daughter-in-law I think
he is onto his duty!

525
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,589
He'll get late!

526
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,520
To break his fast..

527
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,290
...Get some dates out!

528
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,104
Let him come!
Today, I'll confront him!

529
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,339
He doesn't have to trouble
you people for me!

530
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,333
Mother, he's not home yet!

531
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:03,042
Daughter-in-law, he'll be into
getting medicines for me!

532
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,449
My cancer is never
going to recover!

533
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,524
Than too he spends half
of his salary..

534
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,525
...into my recovery!

535
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,022
& my Salim!

536
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,794
Doctor has already said that
the hole in his heart..

537
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,068
...needs to be operated!

538
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,367
But its been lying in wait!

539
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:30,864
Daughter-in-law

540
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,604
I think of commiting suicide!

541
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,943
Why are you saying this,
mother-in-law?

542
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,339
Then he might..

543
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,812
...Look after Salim, dear!

544
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,250
Don't say this mother-in-law!

545
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,322
Did anybody come here?
- Here, no nobody!

546
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,518
But the door is open!

547
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,357
Anybody could come inside!

548
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,359
Close it!

549
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,522
Come on!

550
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,870
I think that police
officer was right!

551
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,403
Maybe someone must have
got in to hide!

552
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,968
If someone looking for shelter..

553
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,904
...comes in here!

554
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,813
Then remember he's
under our shelter!

555
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,511
He's our guest then!

556
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,285
We would've never handed
him over to the police!

557
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,517
This duo of friends..

558
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,024
...have handled all the dangerous
chores easily!

559
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,594
I believe!

560
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,299
That you will reach great heights
in the underworld!

561
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,911
From today,
you both are my close associates!

562
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,071
Sir! -Get away!

563
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,912
This is your bunglow's key..

564
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,613
...car's key..

565
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,245
...& cash!

566
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,015
Other than this!

567
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,283
Indrapuri's area!

568
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,622
You'll handle!

569
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,927
Poor, brother Raja!

570
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,135
What can he do other
than clapping!

571
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,305
These snakes have bit you down!

572
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,165
Its sad!

573
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,238
But I'm happy that these snakes..

574
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,948
...have left scorpio's
like you behind!

575
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,184
In the happiness of their success!

576
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,256
We'll party, we'll have fun!

577
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,165
Cheer! Cheer!

578
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,603

We know our destiny!

606
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:38,237
We're the Kings!

607
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:47,041
We know our destiny!

608
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,917
We're the Kings!

609
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:56,186
We love our power!

610
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,526
We can die for it!

611
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:05,000
We're the Kings!

612
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:09,231
Cheer,cheer,come lets cheencheer!

00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:13,238

Cheer,cheer,come lets cheencheer!

620
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:49,239
I had fun today!

621
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,243
Do you remember, Krishna?

622
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,110
What were we?

623
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,985
Worms, crawling worms!

624
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:59,989
Yes, we crawled like this!

625
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:06,823
The world has troubled
us for such little!

626
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,421
They amde us cry!

627
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,296
Than too, we..

628
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,028
...Used to call them!

629
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:20,565
Come here friends & neighbors!
PLace your bets!

630
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,936
The Queen!

631
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,570
3for1!

632
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:27,943
Hey, I got it!

633
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,385
That is why!

634
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,558
We have owe nothing
from the world!

635
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,123
Any way!

636
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,122
Any how!

637
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,091
Our dream has to come true!

638
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,200
Why did you kill me?

639
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,943
Hey Krishna, have tea!

640
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,248
Did you enjoy?

641
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:04,147
No my friend, I could've slept
easily without food, before!

642
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:08,083
This night,
I couldn't sleep properly!

643
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,855
People sleeping on the pavements..

644
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,458
...cannot sleep on this
bed properly!

645
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,397
It'll take time to adjust!

646
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,328
We should've thought
about this before!

647
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,028
What do you want to
think about now?

648
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,364
When we never thought about
this before, why think now?

649
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,340
We saw a dream,
we're working for it!

650
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,335
We'll stop when we fulfill
our dreams!

651
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,073
It'll be difficult
to get back later!

652
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,576
Who wants to come back? Do you?

653
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,284
At the moment, I want to stop!

654
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,548
Why?

655
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,913
I want to think about the things
that we're getting!

656
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,151
& the things that we're
doing for it!

657
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,356
Isn't it too much?

658
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,261
Why are you talking
like a literate?

659
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,263
What did we have to repay?

660
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,028
A set of cards..

661
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,903
"Hunger, poverty..

662
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,274
...other than this,
did we have anything to repay?

663
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,169
Humanity!

664
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,083
If there's a marriage or an
incident in this city!

665
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,220
The windows never open
for any of these!

666
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,385
But, open it!

667
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,326
Open up a talk!

668
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:21,826
Don't worry!

669
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,891
Don't worry & tell me who saw..

670
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,027
...Hamid Khan's killer!

671
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,263
I've seen him!

672
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,068
Me!

673
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,335
Who are you?

674
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,406
I'm the witness!

675
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,140
What's your name?

676
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,079
Master Dinanath!

677
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,150
Master Dinanath!

678
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:51,525
Certainly the criminals will
get behind a witness!

679
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,132
They pressurize them & force them!

680
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,496
That they do not recognize them!

681
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,829
& usually they..

682
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,104
"Get back!

683
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,403
I'm not among those!

684
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,468
I've retired!

685
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,414
& someday I'll retire
from this life!

686
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,411
But the values of truth & honesty!

687
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,482
That I've been teaching the kids!

688
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,358
I'll never retire from that!

689
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,988
Then the criminals would
want to kill you!

690
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,963
Or they will!

691
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,992
If I'm dead then its fine!

692
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,533
I don't care about it!

693
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,096
If I'll die..

694
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,204
...then I'm ready!

695
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,400
Great!

696
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,238
Great!

697
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:46,281
Often,
people study & teach in school!

698
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,217
But there are very few people!

699
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,316
Who are schools' themselves!

700
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:03,822
Everyone has faith on god!

701
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:09,094
Everyone has faith on god!

702
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:14,470
God cares for all!

703
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:19,515
God cares for all!

704
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:24,945
This person was..

705
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:30,217
...This person was a gentleman!

706
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:35,560
This person was a gentleman!

707
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,560
Don't bury my father,don't
bury my father!

708
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,989
I won't let my father get burried!

709
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,854
Don't do this,
dear, we have to bury him!

710
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,927
Come out, son! -I won't come out!

711
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,291
I won't come out!

712
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,261
I won't let my father get burried!

713
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,628
Come out, son! Come out, son!

714
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:24,540
Come out, son!
- Leave me, leave me!

715
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,142
Why did you kill me?

716
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,932
You're sitting so silent!

717
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,273
You don't even get blessings!

718
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,385
People come to bury the
dead under the soil!

719
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,517
But you're here to take
away the soil!

720
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,882
What do I think of you?

721
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,656
This is not what you think!

722
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:47,557
This is a memorial park!

723
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,896
People are here to offer flowers!

724
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,561
& even to choose flowers!

725
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,328
But why are you here?

726
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,004
Even thieves come to
the memorial park!

727
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,599
They come to rob & l..

728
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,871
...want to know the truth!

729
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,505
I hope you're not here
for any wrong reasons!

730
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,040
No!

731
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,541
I'm not here for what you think!

732
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,245
You don't talk about it!

733
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,882
You are immoral!

734
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:17,391
You will always stay in the dark!

735
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,896
You can never be good!

736
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,091
Nor will you try!

737
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,439
Tell me which color should
I choose for the bunglow?

738
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,568
How do I know?

739
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,470
OK! I'll ask Krishna!

740
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,475
Come Krishna!

741
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,018
Where have you been?

742
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,150
Look, you should not stay low!

743
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,091
If you feel like fighting,you
should, you're like my brother!

744
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,221
Give me five!

745
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,964
What's in your hands?

746
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:00,995
It is a question!

747
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,494
What question?

748
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,338
Do the question & answer
thing later, Birju!

749
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,967
Its time, you have to go!

750
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,175
Oh, yes, its late!

751
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,406
Lets go to Yamraaj's
place for sometime!

752
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,573
Take this Aisha!

753
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,576
Discuss the painting with brother,
Raja!

754
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,399
Birju, who are we waiting for?

755
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,904
You'll know with time!

756
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,970
I've set it upin Dubai!

757
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,068
Its our Banwari!

758
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,447
Yes Banwari, poor Banwari!

759
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,839
Bifju!

760
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,342
Why did you kill Banwari?

761
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:25,019
That jerk was escaping with
bosses 10 lac rupees!

762
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,014
Did you want me to kiss him
instead of killing him?

763
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,620
Do you know the consequences his
family will have to face?

764
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,955
Its his family,
he has to think about it!

765
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,231
He betrayed us, he had to die!

766
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,638
If he doesn't care about his
family than why should I care?

767
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,565
Have I taken the responsibility
of..

768
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,200
...all the families in the world!

769
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,102
Listen to me!

770
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:56,079
When we walk,
many ants die under our foot!

771
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,984
Do we cry for them?

772
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,380
Ants are not our friends!

773
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,824
But Banwari was our friend Birju!

774
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,156
A traitor..

775
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,928
...can never be a friend
to anybody!

776
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,540
Any evidence?

777
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,381
I never leave any evidence!

778
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,117
Usually,
the minds of the criminals..

779
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,383
...are heated!

780
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,289
You are intelligent!

781
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,893
Sir betel!

782
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,560
If you stay in this line!

783
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,304
You'll gain a lot of success!

784
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:56,069
I don't want it!

785
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:06,453
Now you're only going to
see the back of him!

786
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:07,947
What do you mean?

787
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,525
You're friend Krishna!

788
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:16,989
Is drifting away from you!

789
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,593
This cannot be a fact!

790
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,368
Thiss is your illusion, a doubt!

791
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,103
<i>UK'.!</i>

792
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,006
We'll see to it!

793
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,515
If its your trust or
my doubt that wins!

794
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,217
My trust can never fail!

795
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,248
Leave it!

796
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,983
Lets drink!

797
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,925
Today master must have
got his pension!

798
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:47,592
That he's here to buy sweets!

799
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,355
Yes, brother!

800
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,132
This is the only day in the month!

801
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,038
When I can offer sweets
to my kids!

802
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,806
Hey master!

803
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,303
Won't you give us the
money to have sweets?

804
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,146
Give us your money!

805
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:10,183
Get off my way!

806
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,388
Give us the money,
we'll let you go!!

807
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,520
Or it'll get bad!

808
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,589
I'm not going to fear
your threats!

809
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,295
Really, you won't give?

810
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,056
Tell me, are you giving it or not?

811
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,501
If I give this money to you!

812
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,470
Than what will my family eat?

813
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,129
I won't give you the
money at any cost!

814
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,504
If you don't give the money!

815
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,343
Then I'll hit you so
bad that you'll..

816
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,402
...give me the money yourself!

817
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,053
Jerks, couldn't you think of this!

818
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,089
That the money you're stealing!

819
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,490
Its not money!

820
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,301
Its his family's bread!

821
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,559
You wo'nt have alcohol
from this money!

822
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,768
You're going to have his
childrens' blood!

823
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,271
Because of you're stupidity!

824
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:07,967
Many lives!

825
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,543
Many houses would ruin!

826
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:13,073
If your a man?

827
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,280
Than steal from those..

828
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,979
...who steal from others!

829
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,352
Considering someone weak!

830
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:23,291
Laughing & clapping like eunuchs!

831
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,988
After this day, they won't keep
they're money under your feet!

832
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,498
But you will lick their feet!

833
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,394
& I'll make you do that!

834
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:39,662
Lick it, do it!

835
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,394
Forgive him son!

836
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,370
Forgive me, forgive me!

837
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,635
Get lost, get lost!

838
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,037
Listen!

839
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,122
What do I think of you?

840
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,357
What do I say to you?

841
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,035
I cannot understand anything!

842
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:15,628
I'll leave!

843
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,468
No, I don't believe it!

844
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,241
The things that are together..

845
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,245
...Can be separated!

846
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:31,316
& this applies to your friendship!

847
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,965
This is page #1.

848
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,528
& this is page #2.

849
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,159
They' retogether!

850
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,229
Separate them!

851
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,579
You can tear the page!

852
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,578
But you cannot separate them!

853
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,392
This is how our friendship
is Mr.Yamraaj!

854
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,155
OK! Birju!

855
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,530
Do you know where is Krishna?

856
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,530
Yes, he'll be with his girlfriend!

857
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,031
No!

858
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,609
He's in the police station!

859
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,277
Inspector Hamid Khan's
murders' witness..

860
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,207
...Mater Dinanath..

861
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,118
...Is going to identify
the killer today!

862
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,251
Master, identify the person who..

863
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,392
...shoot Hamid Khan!

864
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,242
No! None of them!

865
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,406
Master!

866
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,215
You look at them carefully!

867
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,312
I've seen it!

868
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,883
None of them!

869
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,256
OK, take them away!

870
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,826
I regret of not getting
the killer!

871
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,198
But, I'm unhappy for..

872
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,099
...The one who was lightening
up the surrounding!

873
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,233
Is suddenly asking
for the darkness!

874
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,909
Its you're mistake!

875
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,573
I want to give you an advise!

876
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:44,282
Make you're eyes such eminent!

877
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,320
That if you see a drop,
you feel its the whole sea!

878
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,658
You can go now!

879
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,894
You wait here!

880
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,292
Look!

881
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,569
You've been telling me poems!

882
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,305
Listen to mine today!

883
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,938
What happens when an enemy
wants your bad!

884
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,404
It happens however god
wants it to happen!

885
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,943
The older guy was at it!

886
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,581
& now the younger one!

887
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,548
Whoever comes, recites a poem!

888
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,979
The poem was wrong but..

889
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,049
...it was good!

890
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:27,954
Listen!

891
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,203
Did you repay me for that help?

892
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,167
Hamid Khan's kill is much more
heavier than your help!

893
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:46,212
So there's no way I'm forgiving
you for his murder!

894
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,147
Then why did you save me
from being punished!

895
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,642
Look,son!

896
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:53,950
Everyone has a good side
& a bad side in them!

897
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,625
The criminal is the
bad side of you!

898
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,928
If he was punished!

899
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:04,457
Then along with him, the good side
in you would have to die!

900
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:09,436
Injustice is given in
the name of justice!

901
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:11,931
30!

902
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,599
What do you want?

903
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,037
I want..

904
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,606
...That the bad side of
you should be hanged!

905
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,172
But you have to hang him yourself!

906
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,547
& the good side of you..

907
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,382
...Brings back Hamid Khan's
family's happiness back!

908
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:33,053
I've choosen the punishment
& the repentance for you!

909
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,392
I trust you to imply on them!

910
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:38,829
Live long!

911
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,378
Bifju!

912
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,479
Come, come, sit!

913
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,040
Why did you kill the master!

914
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,285
Come sit, have a cup of tea!

915
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,481
Go Aisha, make some tea!

916
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,858
I'm asking you,
why did you kill the master!

917
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,389
What could I do?

918
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,220
The moment I knew..

919
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,631
...That because of him you're
going to get into trouble!

920
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,130
I was heated up!

921
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,862
I killed him!

922
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,098
You did very bad, Birju!

923
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,567
I was not going to get into
trouble because of that master!

924
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,108
He evep saved_me from
getting punished!

925
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:58,171
He wasn't a man,
he was god, Birju!

926
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,009
Is it so?

927
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,117
Than OK, we'll send some
money to his family!

928
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,821
I believe they'll be happy!

929
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,482
If someone kills me!

930
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,321
What will it take
to calm you down!

931
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,861
You're my life,you're precious!

932
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,602
In the same way someone is
precious to the other!

933
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,361
Have you ever thought about this?

934
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,599
OK, I'm sorry!

935
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:30,044
Now tell me,
how do I repent for it?

936
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,041
Leave this field!

937
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:37,818
What if I don't?

938
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,151
Than I'll leave you!

939
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:49,093
Is there someone else in you're
life other than me?

940
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,328
For whom you want to leaving me!

941
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,129
Remember one thing, Krishna!

942
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,471
The person you leave me for!

943
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,806
I won't let that person live!

944
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:08,440
I'll pull his life out of him!

945
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,043
Can you do that?

946
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,112
Can you do that?

947
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:15,989
Then come, I'll show you!

948
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,252
Come with me!

949
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,584
He is the one for whom
I want to leave you!

950
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,794
This, look at this!

951
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,189
Look at him!

952
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,162
Here is inspector Hamid
Khan's corpse burried!

953
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:29,996
Go, kill him, go!

954
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:33,408
Go pull his life out of him!

955
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,134
Why did you stop?

956
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,571
If its a complex situation,
that you can't kill the dead!

957
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,073
Then go to his house!

958
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:43,243
There's a small kid & an old
mother, go kill them!

959
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,052
Why do I kill them?

960
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,453
What wrong have they done to me?

961
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,418
Great!

962
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,851
You're heart still cares a little!

963
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,452
But look at me!

964
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,459
What had he done wrong to me?

965
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:00,357
By killing inspector Hamid Khan,
I've killed his whole family!

966
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,130
What did I get?

967
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,966
The soil in here always asks
me the same question, Birju!

968
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,436
Now I ask you the same thing!

969
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,006
If we have to go from this
world the way we came!

970
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,913
Then why should we kill people,
my friend?

971
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,311
Yes, everyone knows this!

972
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,980
That we all have to die someday!

973
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,217
What does it mean?

974
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,325
Should we sit doing nothing?

975
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:27,293
Stop leaving? -Or if one wants
to die, should he die now?

976
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,421
Go live, live my life!

977
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,302
But don't make your life
miserable by killing!

978
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,832
If I make my life miserable..

979
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,562
...or never stop killing!

980
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,608
We'll think about it later!

981
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,542
After completing our dream!

982
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,504
I believe that there are
differences between us!

983
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,177
The bridge that got us together..

984
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,815
...Has broken!

985
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,124
Now, we'll only meet when..

986
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,915
...you'll leave this field..

987
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,027
...& come to me!

988
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,062
Without fulfilling my dreams..

989
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,532
...I won't come back, Krishna!

990
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,470
Why don't you come to me!

991
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,547
Till I repay the favor of this
soil I'm not moving ahead!

992
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:22,140
OK, then!

993
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,077
We both..

994
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,517
...Will go on our own paths!

995
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:28,919
Bifju!

996
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,550
The path that you're taking..

997
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,452
...Seems to be wonderful but..

998
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,055
...You won't be able to sleep!

999
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,525
& the path that you're taking..

1000
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,304
...There you'll feel sleepy..

1001
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:46,374
...But the people won't
let you sleep!

1002
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,968
Let the time decide this!

1003
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,604
That who's wrong & who's
right among us!

1004
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:53,672
And who loses!

1005
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,076
And who wins!

1006
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,641
What happened?
Whay are you so tensed?

1007
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,646
Today, Krishna has left me!

1008
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,482
Someday death would come!

1009
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,611
I knew that!

1010
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,350
But death before actually dying!

1011
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:41,420
I never thought of that!

1012
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:46,122
Hey postman sir.Any
special letter?

1013
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:48,895
Yes,did you know that inspector
Hameed khan?

1014
01:21:49,269 --> 01:21:50,532
He has a son Salim.

1015
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:53,506
Almost everyday he writes
letters to his Allah.

1016
01:21:54,108 --> 01:21:55,473
I don't know what to do with it?

1017
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:57,135
What does he write in the letter?

1018
01:21:58,245 --> 01:21:59,508
You read it.

1019
01:22:01,915 --> 01:22:04,009
Dear god.
- Dad used to tell me that..

1020
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:05,483
...those who fast regularly..

1021
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:07,418
...you make his wishes come true.

1022
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:09,148
I am going to fast
for whole Ramzan.

1023
01:22:09,256 --> 01:22:11,486
You bring my dad back to me.

1024
01:22:11,592 --> 01:22:14,562
Orelse who will buy us
new clothes for Eid?

1025
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:15,924
Please don't forget.

1026
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,896
Please bring him back.

1027
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:19,997
You have tears after reading this.

1028
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:22,665
Everybody cries after looking
at his condition.

1029
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:24,332
He is very weak now.

1030
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:26,366
And he is not ready
to break his roza.

1031
01:22:26,573 --> 01:22:30,441
He is so stubburn that now-a-days
even fakir baba praises him.

1032
01:22:35,215 --> 01:22:40,483
Everybody listen to this
story of a little child.

1033
01:22:40,587 --> 01:22:45,024
I'll tell you about
some stories of him

1034
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:51,156
He thought that if we follow
roza during ramzan

1035
01:22:51,265 --> 01:22:56,362
Everybody follows him
completing their roza

1036
01:22:56,470 --> 01:23:01,271
He followed roza to
get his dad back

1037
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:06,978
Then after some days

1038
01:23:07,081 --> 01:23:11,951
He became very thirsty
and hungry

1039
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:17,556
After a few days he
became very weak.

1040
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:22,596
He was been then told
to not be so stubborn

1041
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:28,229
You are very hungry dear.Cancel
out your roza.

1042
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:30,938
If I stopped continuing my roza?

1043
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:33,200
God will not satisfiy my wishes.

1044
01:23:33,307 --> 01:23:35,173
I won't discontinue my roza.

1045
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:46,085
His words were magic
and hairs curly.

1046
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:51,181
He was willing to sacrifice
his life for his father.

1047
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:56,491
Then there was some lightning
in the clouds.

1048
01:23:56,597 --> 01:24:01,967
Everybody felt pity for him.

1049
01:24:07,274 --> 01:24:12,041
God then sent him an angel

1050
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:16,106
'God will send some angel to you.'

1051
01:24:16,216 --> 01:24:18,184
'And that angel will
help you every time.'

1052
01:24:19,153 --> 01:24:20,177
Angel!

1053
01:24:24,358 --> 01:24:26,588
Why didn't you bring
back my father?

1054
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:30,292
Son.He is a special guest of god
and will take time t come.

1055
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:33,526
So he has sent me with
presents for eid.

1056
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:34,999
This is for sister.

1057
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:36,297
This is for mother.

1058
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:38,337
And for you some new clothes..

1059
01:24:38,438 --> 01:24:40,429
...and this beautiful cap.

1060
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:55,514
Then he offered him some food.

1061
01:24:55,622 --> 01:25:01,026
He then discontinued his
fasting for roza.

1062
01:25:01,128 --> 01:25:06,191
He then discontinued his
fasting for roza.

1063
01:25:21,248 --> 01:25:24,946
Eid has finally arrived.

1064
01:25:25,052 --> 01:25:28,852
Everybody is taking god's name.

1065
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:32,551
Eid has finally arrived.

1066
01:25:32,659 --> 01:25:36,562
Everybody is taking god's name.

1067
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:40,531
Eid is one's way of living.

1068
01:25:40,934 --> 01:25:44,461
This is the price of
the whole month.

1069
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:48,269
Different people in
different clothes.

1070
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:52,278
How sweet is that.

1071
01:25:52,379 --> 01:25:55,906
Different people in
different clothes.

1072
01:25:56,016 --> 01:26:00,180
How sweet is that.

1073
01:26:00,287 --> 01:26:04,053
Eid has brought us
all happiness.

1074
01:26:04,157 --> 01:26:07,525
Eid has brought us
all happiness.

1075
01:26:07,628 --> 01:26:11,826
Loved ones and hate ones
everybody is feeling close.

1076
01:26:11,932 --> 01:26:15,334
Loved ones and hate ones
everybody is feeling close.

1077
01:26:15,435 --> 01:26:19,303
Loved ones and hate ones
everybody is feeling close.

1078
01:26:19,406 --> 01:26:24,276
Loved ones and hate ones
everybody is feeling close.

1079
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:29,443
One.
- Two. -Three. -Four. -Five. -Six.

1080
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:30,540
Seven.

1081
01:26:32,552 --> 01:26:35,317
I haven't meet Krishna
since last ten days.

1082
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:39,018
But I feel that is has
been such along time.

1083
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:44,959
When I think about him this
alcohol doesn't have an impact.

1084
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:46,964
Then what are you thinking?

1085
01:26:48,268 --> 01:26:49,929
About Krishna.

1086
01:26:51,138 --> 01:26:52,902
I don't know where he is?

1087
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:54,235
Where he is staying?

1088
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:55,467
How is he?

1089
01:27:00,947 --> 01:27:02,108
You said that..

1090
01:27:02,482 --> 01:27:04,177
...That you are Hameed's friend..

1091
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:06,247
...and you stay in South Africa.

1092
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:08,011
Yes mother.

1093
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:10,283
I went to South Africa because
Hameed gave me some money.

1094
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:12,389
And because of his money..

1095
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:15,357
...I exploited in my business.
- Whatever I am now..

1096
01:27:16,096 --> 01:27:19,066
...it's all because of him.
- No man makes anybody's life.

1097
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:23,335
Everything happens due to god.
-sister.

1098
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,031
I have one request.

1099
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,337
For happiness of this house..

1100
01:27:28,642 --> 01:27:30,041
...whatever I have to do..

1101
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:32,103
...give me permissions for it.

1102
01:27:32,446 --> 01:27:33,538
Please don't stop me.

1103
01:27:34,314 --> 01:27:35,611
Or else I wont forgive myself.

1104
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:38,245
Forgive is if you do any mistake.

1105
01:27:38,885 --> 01:27:39,943
You are right.

1106
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,549
When Hameed was alive..

1107
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:44,820
...I didn't meet him and have
the chance to thank him.

1108
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,286
Is this not a mistake?

1109
01:27:46,993 --> 01:27:48,017
Anyways.

1110
01:27:48,428 --> 01:27:51,363
If you give the prescription
of medicines..

1111
01:27:51,598 --> 01:27:53,293
...then ill bring her
all the medicines.

1112
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:56,596
And Give Salim's X-ray
report to me.

1113
01:27:57,137 --> 01:27:58,161
Don't worry.

1114
01:27:58,372 --> 01:28:00,033
I wont let anythin
happen to anybody.

1115
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:01,600
And about..

1116
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:02,899
...Salim..

1117
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:04,475
...his hole in his chest..

1118
01:28:04,878 --> 01:28:06,312
...can be treated.

1119
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,211
Mother.

1120
01:28:08,315 --> 01:28:11,444
He knows everything about
our situations. -Mom.

1121
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:14,954
Grandma told that angel
knows everything.

1122
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:24,590
Sir.it is not my fault.Leave me.

1123
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:26,330
Our drugs has been caught.

1124
01:28:26,566 --> 01:28:28,193
And you couldn't do anything.

1125
01:28:28,502 --> 01:28:30,129
Why didn't you inform us.

1126
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:31,966
I told everything to Raja.

1127
01:28:35,475 --> 01:28:37,500
It is not my fault boss.Leave me.

1128
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:46,780
Sir.

1129
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,183
I was about to tell you sir.

1130
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:50,147
Sir.

1131
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:52,117
Sir.You.

1132
01:28:59,966 --> 01:29:01,525
Why is there a need to slap?

1133
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:07,571
If you had just told me.l
would have killed him.

1134
01:29:10,444 --> 01:29:13,277
We would have felt bad that
was our useful man.

1135
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,940
Now-a-days we get a
lot of useful men.

1136
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:19,576
No we don't get.

1137
01:29:20,554 --> 01:29:21,817
In this generation..

1138
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:24,623
...we can get a lot of men..

1139
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:27,823
...but not anybody trust worthy.

1140
01:29:29,362 --> 01:29:31,558
And this is a different
thing that..

1141
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:34,226
...between Raavan and
Lakshman's fight..

1142
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:36,530
...if Lakshman loses than
what should we do?

1143
01:29:38,271 --> 01:29:41,104
Should we slap this Laksman
in his face..

1144
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:43,006
...or should we..

1145
01:29:43,477 --> 01:29:45,571
Put fire in Raavan's Lanka.

1146
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,241
Cheers1

1147
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,095
Sons of Raavan.

1148
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:12,895
I am going to burn
down your Lanka.

1149
01:32:09,923 --> 01:32:11,413
I'll tell you one thing boss.

1150
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:13,891
This Birju can be
dangerous to you.

1151
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:17,086
I have danger to many people.

1152
01:32:18,531 --> 01:32:20,898
Those who enter this underworld..

1153
01:32:22,168 --> 01:32:24,227
...has only one dream.

1154
01:32:25,438 --> 01:32:27,497
One day I'll kill my boss..

1155
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:29,471
...and I'll become the boss.

1156
01:32:35,248 --> 01:32:36,647
I said the truth..

1157
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:39,278
...so everybody is silent.

1158
01:32:39,486 --> 01:32:40,510
Chin up.

1159
01:32:42,055 --> 01:32:44,456
Every thing except the
dream was true.

1160
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:46,282
But boss.

1161
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,125
Don't take this Birju so lightly.

1162
01:32:50,563 --> 01:32:52,964
He's becoming stronger day by day.

1163
01:32:56,936 --> 01:32:57,960
Rampal.

1164
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:00,897
But the drink is not full now.

1165
01:33:02,842 --> 01:33:04,469
If the drink is full..

1166
01:33:05,578 --> 01:33:07,137
...it is drunk.

1167
01:33:07,647 --> 01:33:09,274
Or dropped a bit.

1168
01:33:12,986 --> 01:33:15,250
But if it feels like danger.

1169
01:33:16,523 --> 01:33:18,992
Then it has to be broken.

1170
01:33:49,089 --> 01:33:53,390
You have red lips due
to eating pan.

1171
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:59,120
You have red lips
due to eating pan

1172
01:33:59,232 --> 01:34:03,362
God knows how many
men fell for you.

1173
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:07,270
God knows how many
men fell for you.

1174
01:34:11,244 --> 01:34:15,238
You have red lips
due to eating pan

1175
01:34:15,915 --> 01:34:17,576
Ohhh.

You have red lips
due to eating pan

1177
01:34:21,488 --> 01:34:25,186
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1178
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:29,057
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1179
01:34:41,374 --> 01:34:45,277
Our darling has a
lot of attitude.

1180
01:34:45,378 --> 01:34:49,315
I cut your wings for
flying so high.

1181
01:34:49,415 --> 01:34:53,511
I am a scissor.I'll
cut your tongue.

1182
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:57,454
Take care of your heart,I
may break it.

1183
01:34:57,557 --> 01:35:01,425
Take care of your heart,I
may break it.

1184
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:05,897
I have broken many hearts

1185
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:11,235
I have broken many hearts

1186
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:15,433
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1187
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:19,501
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1188
01:35:31,457 --> 01:35:35,360
I have flirted with many women.

1189
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:39,364
I have forgiven you.

1190
01:35:39,465 --> 01:35:43,402
You will suffer if you
come in my way.

1191
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:47,201
You cant be able to forget it

1192
01:35:47,307 --> 01:35:51,437
You cant be able to forget it

1193
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:55,174
I have done it with many
people like you.

1194
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:57,483
Ohhh.

1195
01:35:57,584 --> 01:36:01,111
I have done it with many
people like you.

1196
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:05,351
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1197
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:09,156
Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1198
01:36:21,407 --> 01:36:25,241
I will remove your attitude.

1199
01:36:25,478 --> 01:36:29,244
I'll bear all the wrong thing
you'll do with me.

1200
01:36:29,515 --> 01:36:33,577
My head is hot now and
I am a bit crazy.

1201
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:37,556
I'll remove all your crazyness.

1202
01:36:37,657 --> 01:36:41,525
I will steal the smile
on your cheek.

1203

I'll carry you through
your dreams.

01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:49,126
I'll slap you if I get angry.

01:36:49,235 --> 01:36:53,331
I'll make you fall
in love with me.

1206
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:57,307

Whatever I have done I
have been great in it.

1212
01:37:25,505 --> 01:37:27,564
You are stubborn.

1213
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,267
The matter is big now.

1214
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:31,104
Be careful now.

1215
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:33,178
You get ready.

Don't come near me.

1218
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,541
Go you butterfly.Fly away.

1219
01:37:39,652 --> 01:37:41,484
I am a lightning.

1220
01:37:41,587 --> 01:37:43,487
I am fire.

1221
01:37:43,589 --> 01:37:45,489
My body is like the volcano.

1222
01:37:45,591 --> 01:37:47,355
I don't give a damn.

1223
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,360
I'll blow your mind

1224
01:37:49,462 --> 01:37:51,260
I am very dangerous.

1225
01:37:51,497 --> 01:37:53,295

I have done this many times.

1229
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:12,181
I have done this many times.

1230
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:16,119
You have red lips due
to eating pan.

1231
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:20,293
You have red lips due
to eating pan.

1232
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:35,373
Lalala.

1233
01:38:40,413 --> 01:38:41,847
Oh!You?

1234
01:38:42,582 --> 01:38:44,311
What's the hurry?

1235
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:45,780
Where are you going?

1236
01:38:46,886 --> 01:38:48,081
No mothers lap..

1237
01:38:48,187 --> 01:38:50,178
...not even love of a sister.

1238
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:53,787
Who is waiting for
you in this town?

1239
01:38:54,994 --> 01:38:56,359
Look inspector.

1240
01:38:58,064 --> 01:39:00,192
Now-a-days I sit with..

1241
01:39:00,299 --> 01:39:02,427
...bar dancers.

1242
01:39:03,503 --> 01:39:05,369
Now I'll answer your question..

1243
01:39:05,571 --> 01:39:07,061
...in rhymes.

1244
01:39:08,274 --> 01:39:11,107
Everybody is having eye on
me for a long time now.

1245
01:39:12,178 --> 01:39:14,875
Does someone even
look at his face?

1246
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:16,205
No.

1247
01:39:16,616 --> 01:39:18,345
Where you are..

1248
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:21,879
...there are murders
and controvercies.

1249
01:39:23,022 --> 01:39:25,548
But there never is any
blood in your uniform.

1250
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,289
No. -Shut up.

1251
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,623
No shut up.

1252
01:39:29,629 --> 01:39:30,926
I am a mirror..

1253
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:32,998
...i'll show your own face.

1254
01:39:33,633 --> 01:39:37,570
Those who don't like their faces
move aside. -Look Birju.

1255
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:39,628
There is some time to
improve or else..

1256
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:44,342
...your attitude will blow
you away oneday.

1257
01:39:45,445 --> 01:39:48,779
Your name will be then
erased in the sea.

1258
01:39:48,881 --> 01:39:50,406
You go away.

1259
01:39:51,217 --> 01:39:55,176
You in the world has the
guts to take me..

1260
01:39:55,855 --> 01:39:56,981
...to the danger.

1261
01:39:57,490 --> 01:40:00,357
I go there myself..

1262
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:04,286
I always play with danger.

1263
01:40:05,298 --> 01:40:06,459
You are the one..

1264
01:40:06,566 --> 01:40:08,591
...who gets eaten by a fish.

1265
01:40:09,435 --> 01:40:11,062
And I am..

1266
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:13,002
...who drinks the whole sea.

1267
01:40:14,073 --> 01:40:16,599
Remember that I believe
in lord Siva.

1268
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:19,375
Hail lord Shiva.

1269
01:40:20,246 --> 01:40:24,183
You have red lips
due to eating pan

1270
01:40:25,251 --> 01:40:28,983
God knows how many
men fell for you.

1271
01:40:29,088 --> 01:40:30,112
Look.

1272
01:40:30,356 --> 01:40:32,415
Salim should be operated
as soon as possilble.

1273
01:40:32,959 --> 01:40:35,155
How much would the operation cost?

1274
01:40:35,928 --> 01:40:38,056
May be around 1 lake rupees.

1275
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:39,488
Okay doctor.

1276
01:40:39,599 --> 01:40:41,089
You make all the arrangements.

1277
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,526
I'll bring the money.

1278
01:40:43,002 --> 01:40:44,094
Thank you. -Okay.

1279
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:45,428
Thank you -Welcome.

1280
01:40:48,174 --> 01:40:50,370
How will you arrange 1 lake?

1281
01:40:51,577 --> 01:40:53,067
I have to do from somewhere.

1282
01:40:53,479 --> 01:40:54,878
If hameed khan was alive..

1283
01:40:55,948 --> 01:40:57,882
...then he would have operated
his son at any cost.

1284
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:00,847
But how will we arrange
so much of money?

1285
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,787
It is a very difficult task.

1286
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,214
I know.

1287
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:08,025
There is no value for tears..

1288
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:11,125
...nor sweat and neither blood.

1289
01:41:12,331 --> 01:41:13,457
All these things are..

1290
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,161
...very cheap here.

1291
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:16,527
So what will you do?

1292
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:18,593
I'll do anything for Salim.

1293
01:41:19,205 --> 01:41:22,140
What happened?Are you
here to confess?

1294
01:41:22,441 --> 01:41:25,103
No.l just want to give
you an information.

1295
01:41:25,611 --> 01:41:27,204
If I tell you about smuggling of..

1296
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,414
...drugs,then what will
you give me reward?

1297
01:41:30,983 --> 01:41:33,111
Can I ask why are you helping..

1298
01:41:33,486 --> 01:41:34,885
...the police?

1299
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:37,346
Do you want this answer or..

1300
01:41:37,456 --> 01:41:40,619
...you want my help all the time.

1301
01:41:41,627 --> 01:41:43,254
Okay.But..

1302
01:41:43,362 --> 01:41:45,456
...Take care of one thing.

1303
01:41:46,098 --> 01:41:48,192
It is easy to get out of control
after you have a drink.

1304
01:41:48,634 --> 01:41:50,261
If you control after
having a drink..

1305
01:41:50,603 --> 01:41:52,071
...then you can walk.

1306
01:41:52,305 --> 01:41:53,329
Or?

1307
01:41:54,106 --> 01:41:56,973
Or you wont be able to
walk.You will be lost.

1308
01:41:57,076 --> 01:42:00,341
I know my strength.

1309
01:42:01,013 --> 01:42:03,573
Wherever I'll go there
would exist a path.

1310
01:42:05,518 --> 01:42:08,317
You can walk with me or leave me.

1311
01:42:09,121 --> 01:42:11,317
If not you,somebody else surely
will walk with me.

1312
01:42:12,124 --> 01:42:13,148
Wait.

1313
01:42:20,166 --> 01:42:21,361
What have you made sister?

1314
01:42:21,601 --> 01:42:22,625
Vermicilli?

1315
01:42:23,202 --> 01:42:24,363
Come on eat it.

1316
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:27,264
Vermicilli is very tasty -Is it?

1317
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:28,904
Sit dear -Yes.

1318
01:42:29,175 --> 01:42:30,199
Sit.

1319
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:32,305
Take this.Eat it.

1320
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,946
I'll eat it myself.

1321
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:38,344
You will eat it.

1322
01:42:38,551 --> 01:42:40,212
I am just giving you
mother's love.

1323
01:42:40,686 --> 01:42:41,812
Enough.

1324
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:43,580
You are like..

1325
01:42:44,457 --> 01:42:45,549
...A god to this house.

1326
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:49,119
You all don't respect me so much.

1327
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:52,521
If you accept me as your mother.
- Listen.

1328
01:42:52,598 --> 01:42:55,829
You will stay in this house now.
- Wow.Thats great.

1329
01:43:00,306 --> 01:43:02,070
There's heaven down a mothers leg.

1330
01:43:03,276 --> 01:43:04,368
You want heaven..

1331
01:43:04,477 --> 01:43:05,501
...or mothers love?

1332
01:43:06,445 --> 01:43:07,469
Mother's love.

1333
01:43:07,546 --> 01:43:09,105
So come here my son.

1334
01:43:10,049 --> 01:43:11,073
Mom.

1335
01:43:17,356 --> 01:43:18,482
Aisha.

1336
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:20,559
I am very happy. -What happened?

1337
01:43:21,661 --> 01:43:23,459
I am very happy.
- Have you got any treasure?

1338
01:43:23,562 --> 01:43:25,587
No.it's bigger than a treasure.

1339
01:43:25,665 --> 01:43:27,133
Is it? -ya. -What?

1340
01:43:27,233 --> 01:43:28,428
Mothers love.

1341
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:30,966
Do you know?
- Hameed khan's mother today..

1342
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,560
...gave food to me with
her own hands.

1343
01:43:32,672 --> 01:43:34,970
I have got mother,sister
and a nephew now.

1344
01:43:35,274 --> 01:43:37,242
I have only heard bout
these relations.

1345
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:39,578
But today I know their meanings.

1346
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:40,874
I can feel this.

1347
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,141
I am very happy today.

1348
01:43:42,214 --> 01:43:43,238
Very haPPV-

01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:46,550
...but also a home.

1351
01:43:46,919 --> 01:43:48,045
A family.

1352
01:43:48,254 --> 01:43:49,881
I haven't even dream about this.

1353
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,614
What happened?

1354
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:54,522
Why are you suddenly silent?

1355
01:43:57,463 --> 01:43:59,488
I just remembered about Birju.

1356
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,195
He should have been here.

1357
01:44:03,202 --> 01:44:04,465
I would have got everything.

1358
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,569
Aisha! -Will you..

1359
01:44:10,142 --> 01:44:11,507
...become a part of my family?

1360
01:44:13,012 --> 01:44:14,036
What do you mean?

1361
01:44:14,347 --> 01:44:15,940
Will you..

1362
01:44:16,148 --> 01:44:17,172

01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:19,942
What happened?

1364
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:21,144
What are you silent?

1365
01:44:22,421 --> 01:44:23,616

1366
01:44:24,123 --> 01:44:25,488

1420
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,599
When a girl laughs.

1421
01:49:05,871 --> 01:49:07,930
And falls in the trap.

1422
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:13,570
I am thinking it from
a long time.

1423
01:49:15,581 --> 01:49:19,540
My mind is flattered.

1424
01:49:19,818 --> 01:49:21,616
Flattered.

1425
01:49:23,055 --> 01:49:26,252
My mind is flattered.

1426
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:29,055
Flattered

1427
01:49:47,579 --> 01:49:51,311
The police has busted everything.

1428
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,245
Krishna is the spy.

1429
01:49:53,852 --> 01:49:55,479
He knows all our places.

1430
01:49:55,988 --> 01:49:57,114
But..

1431
01:49:58,123 --> 01:49:59,249
...he doesn't know..

1432
01:49:59,825 --> 01:50:02,157
...one thing.

1433
01:50:02,895 --> 01:50:04,226
When and how..

1434
01:50:04,863 --> 01:50:06,558
...he is going to die.

1435
01:50:07,533 --> 01:50:08,932
I'll decide that.

1436
01:50:09,201 --> 01:50:11,033
Sir. -If we..

1437
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:12,934
...ask Birju for once. -Shut up.

1438
01:50:14,339 --> 01:50:16,398
Please don't be angry on me sir.
- I mean..

1439
01:50:16,508 --> 01:50:19,341
...if Birju came to rescue Krishna.

1440
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:22,437
Khaini sir.

1441
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,995
Like we add tobacco in Khaini..

1442
01:50:39,498 --> 01:50:40,988
...similarly..

1443
01:50:42,267 --> 01:50:45,100
...Add some terror in..

1444
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:47,565
...both of their lives.

1445
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:52,510
For now only..

1446
01:50:52,778 --> 01:50:54,007
...Krishna.

1447
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:18,496
Thank god Krishna is safe.

1448
01:52:19,898 --> 01:52:22,162
Birju do you know that
Krishna was attacked..

1449
01:52:22,568 --> 01:52:24,559
...because of Yamraaj's orders?

1450
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:26,497
What do you want to say?

1451
01:52:27,306 --> 01:52:29,968
You know the punishment
if one betrays us.

1452
01:52:30,475 --> 01:52:32,341
Even honesty has punishments
some times.

1453
01:52:33,178 --> 01:52:34,202
Birju.

1454
01:52:34,446 --> 01:52:36,437
You saved me that day.

1455
01:52:37,983 --> 01:52:39,007
At this time..

1456
01:52:39,451 --> 01:52:40,680
...Where will I get him?

1457
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:43,088
Circuit house.

1458
01:53:06,011 --> 01:53:07,501
Yam raaj.

1459
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,845
I also dreamt about this.

1460
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:15,443
I will sit in your chair oneday.

1461
01:53:16,989 --> 01:53:18,548
That is why..

1462
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:21,350
...I became one of your dogs.

1463
01:53:22,628 --> 01:53:24,289
That is why I choose Birju..

1464
01:53:24,663 --> 01:53:26,427
...and Krishna.

1465
01:53:27,332 --> 01:53:28,993
Because I saw..

1466
01:53:29,534 --> 01:53:31,059
...fire in them.

1467
01:53:36,475 --> 01:53:38,500
The stain in my hands.

1468
01:53:41,213 --> 01:53:43,375
The stain in my hands
are the proof..

1469
01:53:45,117 --> 01:53:46,346
...that in front of all..

1470
01:53:46,852 --> 01:53:49,321
...you told me to make khaini
so as to embarass me.

1471
01:53:51,924 --> 01:53:53,483
I realised that time.

1472
01:53:55,027 --> 01:53:56,222
That instead of khaini..

1473
01:53:57,529 --> 01:54:00,464
...I was changing my future.

1474
01:54:02,401 --> 01:54:04,199
A very bad..

1475
01:54:04,503 --> 01:54:05,629
...useless..

1476
01:54:06,104 --> 01:54:08,402
...and a waste life I have spent..

1477
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:10,439
...because of you.

1478
01:54:11,276 --> 01:54:13,176
There is no need for..

1479
01:54:13,278 --> 01:54:15,645
...putting any mask.

1480
01:54:16,315 --> 01:54:18,579
Neither is the need to be a slave.

1481
01:54:20,519 --> 01:54:22,214
The Yamraaj of this town is..

1482
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:24,384
...not Raghuraj.

1483
01:54:25,891 --> 01:54:27,381
It's Raja bhaiya.

1484
01:57:29,141 --> 01:57:30,905
I am the Yamraaj from now.

1485
01:57:31,977 --> 01:57:33,001
Yam raaj.

1486
01:57:34,146 --> 01:57:36,513
I was dreaming it for
ten long years.

1487
01:57:37,315 --> 01:57:38,908
Today it became true.

1488
01:57:40,285 --> 01:57:42,014
Raghuraj singh who
was the Yamraaj..

1489
01:57:42,254 --> 01:57:43,881
...was killed by Birju.

1490
01:57:44,322 --> 01:57:45,380
Now his chair..

1491
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:46,785
...is mine.

1492
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:48,388
And now the Yamraaj..

1493
01:57:48,894 --> 01:57:49,918
...is me.

1494
01:57:50,095 --> 01:57:51,119
Me.

1495
01:57:52,464 --> 01:57:54,091
But it being followed that..

1496
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:56,528
...the person who killed Yamraaj
will become the Yamraaj.

1497
01:57:57,235 --> 01:57:59,431
So Birju will be the Yamraaj.

1498
01:57:59,838 --> 01:58:00,896
Only the brave one..

1499
01:58:01,072 --> 01:58:02,198
...will become Yamraaj.

1500
01:58:04,543 --> 01:58:05,942
What do you think?

1501
01:58:06,945 --> 01:58:08,003
For 10 years..

1502
01:58:08,079 --> 01:58:09,604
...I served him..

1503
01:58:11,583 --> 01:58:13,108
...so I have lost power?

1504
01:58:13,985 --> 01:58:15,419
Have I forgotten to
fire a revolver?

1505
01:58:16,054 --> 01:58:17,954
Or my aim will not be perfect?

1506
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:33,396
Did you all see?

1507
01:58:33,505 --> 01:58:34,904
My aim is still perfect.

1508
01:58:35,173 --> 01:58:36,902
Dead in just one bullet.

1509
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:40,478
So do you agree..

1510
01:58:40,912 --> 01:58:42,107
...that I am the Yamraaj?

1511
01:58:59,297 --> 01:59:01,322
He was very late.

1512
01:59:02,434 --> 01:59:03,492
He didn't"

1513
01:59:04,236 --> 01:59:05,965
...like me.

1514
01:59:06,905 --> 01:59:09,135
I will kill all such people..

1515
01:59:10,141 --> 01:59:11,165
...who doesn't..

1516
01:59:11,576 --> 01:59:13,169
...like me.

1517
01:59:24,322 --> 01:59:26,450
I am not the Yamraaj
from the above.

1518
01:59:27,192 --> 01:59:30,389
To let live or kill somebody..

1519
01:59:30,562 --> 01:59:32,553
...he needs permissions.

1520
01:59:33,498 --> 01:59:34,522
<i>E..</i>

1521
01:59:34,899 --> 01:59:36,367
...am the Yamraaj of this earth.

1522
01:59:37,335 --> 01:59:38,359
Whenever I want..

1523
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:41,232
...I can kill anybody at anytime.

1524
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:44,841
And my first decision is..

1525
01:59:45,343 --> 01:59:46,538
...that I want Birju die.

1526
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:57,045
Hey dear.

1527
02:00:05,096 --> 02:00:07,030
Krishna.

1528
02:00:07,932 --> 02:00:09,024
Krishna.

1529
02:00:11,136 --> 02:00:12,433
Hey Krishna.

1530
02:00:12,904 --> 02:00:14,497
I was looking for you.

1531
02:00:14,939 --> 02:00:16,998
Look. -I am back.

1532
02:00:17,475 --> 02:00:18,874
But not empty handed.

1533
02:00:19,044 --> 02:00:20,273
But by fulfilling my dream.

1534
02:00:21,846 --> 02:00:23,610
By becoming Yamraaj.

1535
02:00:24,916 --> 02:00:27,146
Today I have everything.

1536
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:28,980
But I don't have one thing.

1537
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,245
You. -Without you..

1538
02:00:31,323 --> 02:00:33,189
...this life is incomplete.

1539
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:35,153
Complete me brother.

1540
02:00:35,293 --> 02:00:36,988
Come.Come with me.

1541
02:00:37,095 --> 02:00:38,119
No Birju.

1542
02:00:40,632 --> 02:00:41,758
Hey.

1543
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:44,992
What special do you have..

1544
02:00:45,236 --> 02:00:46,761
...that you are..

1545
02:00:46,971 --> 02:00:48,496
...leaving me?

1546
02:00:48,573 --> 02:00:50,063
What did you get?

1547
02:00:50,942 --> 02:00:52,171
I have a house.

1548
02:00:52,277 --> 02:00:53,972
Even I have that.

1549
02:00:54,946 --> 02:00:57,176
With furnitures worth lakhs.

1550
02:00:57,282 --> 02:00:58,306
Go on.

1551
02:00:58,917 --> 02:01:00,942
I have a home. -Even I have that.

1552
02:01:01,052 --> 02:01:03,214
Its a bungalow.Tell more.

1553
02:01:03,455 --> 02:01:05,048
I have a mother. -That..

1554
02:01:08,927 --> 02:01:10,122
You aren't with me now.

1555
02:01:11,029 --> 02:01:13,521
But now-a-days everything
can be buyed with money.

1556
02:01:14,499 --> 02:01:16,866
We can buy relationsJelatives.

1557
02:01:17,235 --> 02:01:19,795
With money you can even buy
mother,brother sister..

1558
02:01:19,971 --> 02:01:21,302
...anything you want.

1559
02:01:21,473 --> 02:01:22,497
Tell.

1560
02:01:24,342 --> 02:01:26,310
I have changed a lot friend.

1561
02:01:27,579 --> 02:01:29,411
Not so much change Krishna.

1562
02:01:30,148 --> 02:01:31,843
Difference is of only a lie.

1563
02:01:33,418 --> 02:01:35,853
The people I stay with..

1564
02:01:36,454 --> 02:01:38,616
...know that I am a criminal.

1565
02:01:39,891 --> 02:01:41,916
And the people you stay with..

1566
02:01:42,293 --> 02:01:44,921
...don't know that even
you are a criminal.

1567
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:49,959
The day when they come to know..

1568
02:01:50,068 --> 02:01:52,469
...that you killed
inspector Hameed.

1569
02:01:52,937 --> 02:01:54,632
You fired at him.

1570
02:01:55,039 --> 02:01:56,063
Then tell me..

1571
02:01:56,141 --> 02:01:58,075
...are they going to
accept you again?

1572
02:01:59,411 --> 02:02:00,435
Tell.

1573
02:02:00,645 --> 02:02:02,306
You call her mom.

1574
02:02:02,514 --> 02:02:04,881
Will she again call you a son?

1575
02:02:05,383 --> 02:02:06,407
Answer me.

1576
02:02:07,519 --> 02:02:09,214
You are like god to them now.

1577
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:12,490
But when they come to
know the truth..

1578
02:02:12,991 --> 02:02:14,049
...won't they..

1579
02:02:14,192 --> 02:02:15,455
...think you as a Yamraaj?

1580
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:19,655
That is why I am telling
you Krishna.

1581
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:22,390
There is no need to regret.

1582
02:02:22,967 --> 02:02:24,526
It's better that..

1583
02:02:25,136 --> 02:02:26,604
...for the blood lost
by their son..

1584
02:02:27,505 --> 02:02:29,564
...we will pay them some money.

1585
02:02:30,141 --> 02:02:31,165
Whatever she asks.

1586
02:02:32,043 --> 02:02:33,272
I am with you.

1587
02:02:35,447 --> 02:02:36,471
Look at this.

1588
02:02:37,682 --> 02:02:39,650
With so much money..

1589
02:02:40,018 --> 02:02:41,918
...I can even buy a person.

1590
02:02:42,454 --> 02:02:44,354
If money had so much power..

1591
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:48,958
...then Yamraaj could have
bought Hameed Khan.

1592
02:02:49,093 --> 02:02:50,993
<i>He won't have shouted at him.</i>

1593
02:02:52,497 --> 02:02:54,124
Those who always think
about money..

1594
02:02:54,566 --> 02:02:56,591
...only they could be buyed.

1595
02:02:57,836 --> 02:02:59,361
But those who are loyal..

1596
02:03:00,071 --> 02:03:01,539
...they sacrifice themselves.

1597
02:03:02,507 --> 02:03:04,305
They don't bargain for money.

1598
02:03:04,876 --> 02:03:05,900
Who are you?

1599
02:03:06,144 --> 02:03:08,078
I am late Hameed khan's wife.

1600
02:03:09,647 --> 02:03:10,842
She is his mother.

1601
02:03:14,085 --> 02:03:16,383
Roses can grow all the time..

1602
02:03:18,256 --> 02:03:20,520
...but lotus should be praised.

1603
02:03:21,025 --> 02:03:22,356
As it grows in dirty areas.

1604
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:24,385
Let's go son.

1605
02:03:24,562 --> 02:03:25,654
You are my son.

1606
02:03:26,064 --> 02:03:27,088
Mom.

1607
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:31,494
Come son. -Lets go home.Come.

1608
02:03:41,346 --> 02:03:42,871
I'll wait for you Birju.

1609
02:04:10,174 --> 02:04:12,370
This Krishna.

1610
02:04:12,977 --> 02:04:14,843
I explained a lot.

1611
02:04:17,148 --> 02:04:19,207
He is not ready to come with me.

1612
02:04:19,984 --> 02:04:21,418
He thinks..

1613
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:24,011
...that he has got something
very precious.

1614
02:04:24,122 --> 02:04:27,183
He's very proud of that mother.

1615
02:04:28,259 --> 02:04:30,091
Stupid.

1616
02:04:30,628 --> 02:04:32,323
If you have the money..

1617
02:04:32,564 --> 02:04:35,659
...i'll get a lot of women
who will call me son.

1618
02:04:36,067 --> 02:04:38,434
Yes.You will get a lot of women.

1619
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:40,069
But you won't get a mother.

1620
02:04:40,204 --> 02:04:41,797
I'll get a mother too.

1621
02:04:43,374 --> 02:04:45,138
Hey Rag. -Yes master.

1622
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:46,434
Come here.

1623
02:04:48,179 --> 02:04:49,943
Your mother is your place right?

1624
02:04:51,149 --> 02:04:52,412
Call her here.

1625
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:54,582
And tell her..

1626
02:04:55,486 --> 02:04:58,581
...to forget about you
and call me her son.

1627
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:01,119
You too forget her.

1628
02:05:02,527 --> 02:05:05,360
How much money do you
want for this?

1629
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:08,497
Sir. No matter how much
money you give me..

1630
02:05:09,133 --> 02:05:10,362
I can't forget my mother.

1631
02:05:10,635 --> 02:05:12,103
Neither can she leave me.

1632
02:05:13,037 --> 02:05:15,369
Even if you a mahal made of gold.

1633
02:05:16,174 --> 02:05:17,198
Shut up.

1634
02:05:17,575 --> 02:05:19,543
Why are you beating him?Leave
him alone.

1635
02:05:20,211 --> 02:05:21,303
You tell me.

1636
02:05:21,479 --> 02:05:25,006
Could you bring Krishna by
showing him some money?

1637
02:05:25,116 --> 02:05:26,311
Who is Krishna?

1638
02:05:26,951 --> 02:05:27,975
Whos is the friend?

1639
02:05:28,419 --> 02:05:29,853
I don't have anybody.

1640
02:05:30,388 --> 02:05:31,878
I don't know anybody.

1641
02:05:32,657 --> 02:05:33,852
Birju is dead.

1642
02:05:34,559 --> 02:05:36,027
I know that..

1643
02:05:36,861 --> 02:05:38,955
...I am the Yamraaj.

1644
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:40,859
Yam raaj.

1645
02:05:40,932 --> 02:05:43,026
Yamraaj takes life.

1646
02:05:43,301 --> 02:05:45,133
How can he give life?

1647
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:48,002
What do you mean? -I am..

1648
02:05:48,606 --> 02:05:50,040
...Pregnant.

1649
02:05:53,611 --> 02:05:55,272
I thought I'll raise him.

1650
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:57,004
But no.

1651
02:05:57,382 --> 02:05:59,874
What do I know you will
say someday that..

1652
02:05:59,951 --> 02:06:01,612
...it's not mine.

1653
02:06:08,493 --> 02:06:10,086
What are you talking?

1654
02:06:10,495 --> 02:06:11,985
It's my child.

1655
02:06:12,830 --> 02:06:14,889
It's my blood.it's my love.

1656
02:06:15,299 --> 02:06:16,323
Hey.

1657
02:06:17,301 --> 02:06:18,325
Aisha.

1658
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:21,464
Wait Aisha. -Listen to me Aisha.

1659
02:06:21,572 --> 02:06:24,303
If everybody leaves me
then what will I do?

1660
02:06:24,542 --> 02:06:25,907
How will I live?

1661
02:06:26,444 --> 02:06:27,502
Tell me. -Why?

1662
02:06:27,612 --> 02:06:30,309
You are the Yamraaj.What
don't you have?

1663
02:06:30,415 --> 02:06:32,076
I don't have something Aisha.

1664
02:06:32,183 --> 02:06:34,481
If you go then I'll be lonely.

1665
02:06:34,919 --> 02:06:36,353
Please don't leave me Aisha.

1666
02:06:36,454 --> 02:06:38,479
I won't come back again.

1667
02:06:38,589 --> 02:06:39,920
Not at any cost.

1668
02:06:40,491 --> 02:06:43,552
Dont leave me Aisha.
- Get out of my way.

1669
02:06:44,228 --> 02:06:46,458
I promise..
- I wont come back again.

1670
02:06:46,564 --> 02:06:47,963
Don't leave me Aisha.

1671
02:06:48,066 --> 02:06:49,556
I'll also come with you.

1672
02:06:50,168 --> 02:06:53,194
I promise Aisha.l am telling
you the truth.

1673
02:06:53,304 --> 02:06:54,533
I am telling you the truth.

1674
02:06:54,939 --> 02:06:56,566
If you don't believe me..

1675
02:06:57,208 --> 02:06:59,233
...then come and let's get married.

1676
02:07:07,018 --> 02:07:08,315
Now you believe me.

1677
02:07:08,553 --> 02:07:09,884
Remember one thing.

1678
02:07:10,288 --> 02:07:11,847
I'll marry the Birju..

1679
02:07:12,323 --> 02:07:13,984
...that I used to love.

1680
02:07:14,325 --> 02:07:15,588
I don't want Yamraaj.

1681
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:17,152
I want Birju.

1682
02:07:17,528 --> 02:07:18,552
Understood?

1683
02:07:19,864 --> 02:07:20,888
Okay.

1684
02:07:21,365 --> 02:07:22,389
Now onwards..

1685
02:07:22,867 --> 02:07:24,130
...you will have your Birju.

1686
02:07:24,569 --> 02:07:25,900
Give me 5 min.

1687
02:07:28,005 --> 02:07:29,495
Only 5 min.

1688
02:07:49,093 --> 02:07:50,117
Look Aisha.

1689
02:07:50,495 --> 02:07:52,964
Like everybody removes
their clothes..

1690
02:07:53,197 --> 02:07:55,529
...I quit Yamraaj.

1691
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,795
Look.

1692
02:07:57,869 --> 02:07:58,893
Aisha!

1693
02:07:59,570 --> 02:08:01,004
Aisha!

1694
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,498
Aisha!

1695
02:08:04,108 --> 02:08:05,132
Aisha!

1696
02:08:05,243 --> 02:08:06,472
Aisha!

1697
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,204
Aisha!

1698
02:08:16,587 --> 02:08:17,611
Aisha!

1699
02:08:19,323 --> 02:08:20,347
Aisha!

1700
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,584
Aisha!

1701
02:08:28,032 --> 02:08:29,329
Aisha!

1702
02:09:09,907 --> 02:09:11,341
I have lost more while fighting.

1703
02:09:12,243 --> 02:09:13,540
And haven't achieved anything.

1704
02:09:15,213 --> 02:09:18,114
Inspector was right that becoming
Yamraaj is like..

1705
02:09:18,616 --> 02:09:20,448
...riding a tiger.

1706
02:09:22,453 --> 02:09:24,182
I am fed up..

1707
02:09:24,989 --> 02:09:26,320
...fighting like this Krishna.

1708
02:09:27,458 --> 02:09:28,482
I am fed up.

1709
02:17:07,318 --> 02:17:09,184
Lets go to the hospital.

1710
02:17:10,354 --> 02:17:11,446
Hey inspector.

1711
02:17:12,156 --> 02:17:14,215
I dreamt about the wrong thing.

1712
02:17:14,458 --> 02:17:16,153
I have paid for it now.

1713
02:17:17,127 --> 02:17:19,459
If there is still something..

1714
02:17:20,030 --> 02:17:21,225
...then you can punish me.

1715
02:17:21,298 --> 02:17:23,392
We will accept any punishment sir.

1716
02:17:23,867 --> 02:17:25,562
Punishment will be decided
by the law.

1717
02:17:25,636 --> 02:17:29,971
Because of you there are no
Yamraaj in the city anymore.

1718
02:17:30,407 --> 02:17:32,375
So I don't think you as
criminals anymore.

1719
02:17:32,976 --> 02:17:34,967
What could you do?

1720
02:17:35,312 --> 02:17:38,373
Life was counting the flowers.

1721
02:17:39,650 --> 02:17:41,914
As it became not enough..

1722
02:17:42,586 --> 02:17:44,145
...we adjusted with its thorns.
