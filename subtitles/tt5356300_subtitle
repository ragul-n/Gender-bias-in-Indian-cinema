1
00:01:54,647 --> 00:02:08,550
'James and Alice'

2
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,997
My Lord Bali, give me all strength

3
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,530
Protect and save only me

4
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,805
Gikku Mon!
Yeah, K.T Annan (brother) has come

5
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,908
My dear K.T Annan, the
first shoot is not yet over

6
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,148
And that second
company people are waiting-

7
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,718
- that Straight Line company men

8
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,547
Has he not finished it yet?

9
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,880
What's he doing? For one minute
ad, how much time is he taking?

10
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,084
That's because the director was late
to start, that's why its not over yet

11
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,698
Fellow stop that Trivandrum slang,
that calling 'Annan' and all

12
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,129
As l'm trying my
best to change my tone

13
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,561
Even otherwise the people out here
are scared of people from South

14
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,660
ls it so?

15
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,837
The saying is when Cobra and
people from South are seen together

16
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,068
Flog the compatriots
from South at first

17
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,838
Even otherwise when a guy from
South is present, Cobra doesn't come

18
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,239
Just go nearthe Cobra
saying that you hail from South

19
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,240
Then you'll know!

20
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,508
Bloody fool, this is a garden
created by human beings

21
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,886
The fruits and vegetables
not to get rotten for days

22
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,923
Hazardous pesticides like
'Endosulfan' is sprayed

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,052
You just tell me

24
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,257
After eating all this do we
have to destroy our generation?

25
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,932
James, the person can be changed
On changing?

26
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,172
Fellow, what kind of
a concept is this?

27
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,706
How to approach 'Dhathri' with this?

28
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,942
Nandhu!
Just throw that guy!

29
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,910
Fellow?
That's not meant for boss!

30
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,576
Just one more chance
Get out now!

31
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,017
Didn't l prompt?
Sorry madam, please -Okay, okay

32
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,316
Will give one more chance

33
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,226
Swamy, just tight
that fine once more

34
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,196
Just keep aside the second
take, that is bit more better

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,099
Saw this?
You saw this?

36
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,178
Look, l'm not running an
eatery over here!

37
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,634
Just move back, let me just
cross check this account balance

38
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,860
Just a second, okay

39
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,206
Can you help me?

40
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,149
Hello, madams, have been
waiting for one and a half hour

41
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,187
Sir, please five minutes
Five minutes!

42
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,655
Shahi! -Yeah
Could you check this sir's F.D renewal?

43
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:26,855
Sir, please sit

44
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,369
Didn't l say?

45
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,876
Shankaretta..!
What's it madam?

46
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,102
Phone for Shahina

47
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,772
Anwar Ekka

48
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,746
''Ekka's soul
mother's beloved..''

49
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,420
Shahina madam phone

50
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,624
Hello, what is it Ekka?

Okay, l'll be late today, over
here today auditing is going on

52
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,291
Give it to son
My dear!

53
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:13,030
Hey fellow, mummy will come
fast, there's juice inside the fridge

54
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,400
Take and drink it

55
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,030
Okay

56
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,745
So, one tension is over

57
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,071
lt was husband, picked
up son from the school

58
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,254
Johnson!

59
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,365
Sir, put a sign over here

60
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,750

61
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,117
Yeah, should require lD proof

62
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:20,101
Team DrC

63
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,011
Alice madam, sir is calling

64
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,016
Swamy, what is the solution?
Dhathri eat pure

65
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,188
There is a humour on this
which is not intended by us

66
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,197
lt might survive on that sometimes

67
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,494
Not that James actually it has got
a recall value, you wait and see

68
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,044
Look, just take a wave
file of audio separately

69
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,306
James, pack up?
Yeah its over

70
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,340
That's that one,
what about this one?

71
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,923
This concept? Which l should
do on this disgusting set up!

72
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,521
My dear K.T-

73
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,525
-at least now can't you stop
this gimmick of cheating clients?

74
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,358
You may leave now! Nandhu,
transfer a copy to my hard disk

75
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,527
lf delayed..
Hey fellow!

76
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,567
Okay, now itself l'll..
You are only James..ls it?

77
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,842
You aren't James
Cameron, are you?

78
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:34,902
ls it? After working on disgusting set
up, people reach high set up

79
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,949
Then what? -By dear brother
do it with the existing set up

80
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,584
Can't you understand on saying?

81
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,581
Am l yours..?
James! No - No, leave it

82
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,522
Fellow, leave me

83
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,853
Wrap up fast, won't be
good if l stay here now

84
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,257
So, today this James
shouldn't do this

85
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,895
But saying to repay the house loan

86
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,230
There is one James who has
collected this work's money as advance!

87
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,196
That James will do this work!

88
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,571
Shall l go?

89
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,540
Come sir
Saw this? That's K.T

90
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,824
Will go?
Yeah

91
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,561
Daughter's mother not come?
No, aunty

92
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,426
ls it, then shall aunty wait?
No, no need

93
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,968
Mother will come

94
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,455
Shucks!

95
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,591
Hey Alice, please!

96
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,252
Hello, hello, move what's the delay?

97
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,052
Where are the receipts of this?

98
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,452
That is..Sir its in the next page

99
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,617
Yeah, this one is it?
Let me note this

100
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,903
Saw 12, 13
That's okay

101
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,437
With that will the
next year be correct?

102
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,009
Just see the figure is different

103
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,335
Nandhu!

104
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,017
One minute okay, child
why sitting there?

105
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,053
So far no one has come
to pick you up? -No

106
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,554
Teacher, that's what
l'm also thinking-

107
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,454
- the second trip
school bus is also gone

108
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,094
Usually this child's mother
comes and picks her early

109
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,023
ls it so?

110
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,430
Child, do you
know mother's number?

111
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,402
lts on this

112
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,199
All this should be kept by heart, no?

113
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,681
My goodness, your mother
is not picking up the phone

114
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,716
ls this father's number?
Yeah

115
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,499
James!
Phone

116
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,241
l'll tell

117
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,215
Okay
That's okay, no?

118
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,748
Can match that
No problem

119
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,246
Just see the end of previous shot
What happened?

120
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,220
Whether the continuity is matching
James it was from daughter's school

121
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,381
No one has picked daughter

122
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,260
Has she not left, yet?
Shucks!

123
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,429
Fellow, you don'tjust
have to get tensed

124
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,464
Then who is going to do this?

125
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,101
lts only four or five shots, no?

126
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,196
More than that Swamy is here, no?

127
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,696
Don't cry child
Don't cry

128
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,635
Daughter's father and
mother will come now

129
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,138
Till that time can sit
inside watcher uncle's cabin

130
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,470
Don't cry daughter

131
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,504
Why not uncle buy
you an ice cream?

132
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,519
Hello?
Where are you man?

133
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,317
l've started from there
Then who is shooting this?

134
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,758
l've told everything to
Nandhu, she will take care of it

135
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,255
Hang the phone and go man

136
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,442
Hello!

137
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,614
Chetto! (Brother)

138
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,577
What is it sir?

139
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,087
Teacher had called saying
my daughter is waiting here

140
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,420
lzabell
lzabell Soosan James

141
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,493
She was picked up by her mother,
sir its only 15 minutes back

142
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:32,932
Team DrC

143
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,340
Hey girl, pick up the phone, how
many times is the call coming?

144
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,636
Pick up and talk

145
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,439
For what? -Rohini, why aren't you
understanding the things that l say?

146
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,873
What if your son was standing
there, alone? -That 'll never happen

147
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:50,251
My father does that duty promptly,
even if when struck with Tsunami

148
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,425
Family is sort of an adjustment..
Enough, enough!

149
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,566
Over here the adjustment
happens only from my side

150
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,868
Each time will say each excuse

151
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,567
All sorts of crap like that!

152
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,369
Why, only does he have a job?
Am l not working?

153
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,638
Then l'm not forgetting
my responsibilities?

154
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,780
My dearAlice, that's
because these guys are..

155
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,279
You don't say anything

156
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,443
Today when l went there, daughter
and that watcher was alone

157
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,712
There is no other
person in that vicinity

158
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,650
How to trust people?

159
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,459
Now a days, even three
year old kids aren't spared

160
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,789
Hey girl, don't exaggerate this issue

161
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,559
Sorry!
Whatever excuse you say, l..

162
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,294
James is irresponsible,
is that the issue?

163
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,843
By the way when did
the monkey girl come?

164
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,943
l'm not monkey, l'm Pinky

165
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,280
My goodness don't be upset okay

166
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:53,943
Here

167
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,319
Here boy, one for you

168
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,591
This Seer Fish how expensive it is?

169
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,591
Rs. 850 per kilo, l didn't buy

170
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,629
My father, l've told you many times-

171
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,993
- not to bargain with female
fish vendors on the street

172
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,836
Was a big criminal lawyer

173
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:16,236
To have some good food, there's
no point in saying lPC and CRPC

174
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,672
Then?
Should go to market

175
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,472
Yeah, at this old age..
Roaming around the evening market

176
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,306
That's a pleasure, is it not child?

177
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,379
On saying all this
she won't understand

178
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,552
Rohini, then shall l leave? -Okay
Daughter, come

179
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,548
Child, have tea and go
Enough uncle

180
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:32,880
Govind!

181
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,982
Put this inside

182
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,355
Okay then daughter
Put the bag properly

183
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,461
Come

184
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:40,730
Okay then

185
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,271
Boy did you take bath
after coming from school -No

186
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,431
Go and take bath
Did mothertake bath?

187
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,404
Hey fellow

188
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,905
Today what was her problem?
Father, nothing more to say

189
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,538
Their problems, they
should speak and solve it

190
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,411
There is no point in saying

191
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,811
Any house should
have an elderly person

192
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,082
While living excluding them
What did l do?

193
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,469
How many did you have?

194
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,533
Gone well

195
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,078
Swamy!

196
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,640
lts a compliment, buddy

197
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,452
Just a minute okay

198
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,468
Where were you man?

199
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,476
How many years it has
been since met?

200
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,975
Man, where did that old James go?

201
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,920
At the fine arts college one
who broke all the text book norms

202
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,651
He was a rebel

203
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,158
The out put will
come out really good

204
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,556
That will happen only like that, no?

205
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,363
lts a contra
scene, which are the guys?

206
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,834
An old company of mine

207
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,496
A visiting professor of
Fine Arts College, artist

208
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,835
For some time was in Paris

209
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,050
What's up?
Did you pick up daughter?

210
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,917
Picked up
Not me, Alice

211
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,751
Goodness, will it be a problem?

212
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,601
Should do something like this

213
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,998
Over here this K.T and crap!
Simply to waste time

214
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,674
Then you create a
concept we'll forward it

215
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,912
A company that has got second
biggest marketing budget

216
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,743
To do their ad, will delegate us, no?

217
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,077
lts not the company that
delegates, its the agency, no?

218
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,414
l was the one who did
the last work of that team

219
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,046
That's why saying, create a concept

220
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,455
Come on man, give a try

221
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,654
After all aren't you
Prahlad Kakkar of poor people?

222
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,162
Don't con, girl

223
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,594
lf such an opportunity is obtained

224
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,243
Mother, l had my bath

225
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,676
Go and take one dress

226
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,963
Daughter, go and read
that nursery rhymes

227
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,632
Why mother has not
changed the dress and all?

228
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,166
Daughter, severe head ache-

229
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,862
-mother will come now,
you go and read

230
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,905
This one?
Okay remove it

231
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,739
Hey girl, close it and go

232
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,743
My god!

233
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,515
Mother, Papa has come

234
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,498
What?
Listen K.T

235
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,534
l've told hundred times
again l'll never work for you

236
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,003
This time only because of one person
Nandhu, l agreed it again

237
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:46,634
What is that? The concept is
created by yourfoul agency is it?

238
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,580
Move back

239
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,013
Hey fellow, should
like own profession

240
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,154
Must love the work that you do

241
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,258
At least should have
some commitment-

242
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,527
- towards the money you collect

243
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,199
Now are you saying like that?
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

244
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,996
No, K.T its not possible
Very difficult

245
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:16,034
The dealings between us is finished
today don't call me here after

246
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,074
lf at all you call, l won't react
in a decent language like this

247
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,115
Come here!

248
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:37,795
Yeah, Nandhu K.T had
called so that matter is resolved

249
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,992
You take the charge
of post production-

250
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,631
- from now on l'm not coming there

251
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,294
Shucks! You don't talk as
if you don't know the things

252
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,834
This professional ethics,
is it confirmed only to me?

253
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,610
Nandhu, l'm totally stressed out
You call tomorrow

254
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,171
Told to read those rhymes
why aren't you obeying?

255
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,610
Why aren't you obeying?

256
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,947
What is this Alice? Are you showing
the angertowards me to her?

257
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,691
Reading loud, l should
hear over there

258
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,693
Then what? ls she
studying for lAS exam?

259
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,363
Hey girl, when dealing with
kids, you should know their age

260
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,067
That's only a small child
ls it so?

261
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,864
Then how come she
was alone there till 5:30?

262
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,631
Alice, don't simply
pretend that you are a fool

263
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,207
Didn't you that l was
busy with the shoot today?

264
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,742
And l won't be able to spare a
minute, from there didn't you know that?

265
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,642
Like you, morning 10 o'clock
signing in a register and by evening-

266
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,706
-5 o'clock,coming back
saying see you tomorrow

267
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,784
My profession is not like that

268
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,909
Whatever profession it may
be, its not in Uganda is it?

269
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,681
Don't you have half an hour
to spare for the daughter?.

270
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,754
This is only a question
of one day, today

271
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,057
ln stead of half an hour-

272
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,255
- today my situation was
not able to spare half a minute

273
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:36,136
Team DrC

274
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,175
l'll come
You go

275
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,080
Does he lose anything on smiling?

276
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,984
What was up with K.T?

277
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,985
He was lamenting on
yesterday's issue

278
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,750
Just tell him to get lost!

279
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,230
Look, Swamy had called

280
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,866
Then?
We'll sit at the upstairs

281
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,225
Next week, on any day

282
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,395
Asked whether could do a
presentation for that agency

283
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:07,038
Saying great? By wearing coat not
telling to perform cinematic dance

284
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,440
At least we should
complete a concept

285
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,510
That can be done
You don't take it cool, okay

286
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,456
lt might be Alice
Yeah

287
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,329
How was it yesterday?
Really got pissed off!

288
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,007
Fellow, did you get any whacks?
That was more better

289
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,880
Come on man, pick up
the phone or else l'll attend

290
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,520
Hello?
Mother had called from native

291
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:56,358
Really? Mother? A phone call that
never took place since 7 to 8 years?

292
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,430
All of a sudden
Father wants to meet us

293
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:00,990
Anything in particular?

294
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,962
All these years we
weren't informed

295
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,131
Father had two attacks

296
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,871
Today he is brought to home

297
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,235
Father said he wants
to see our daughter

298
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,536
Why don't we visit?
Why not?

299
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,879
You may go
Then what about James?

300
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,275
You..You may go
along with daughter

301
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,869
What man?
Anything serious?

302
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,131
Her father, aftertwo attacks-

303
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,209
- suddenly a wish to see
granddaughter raptures

304
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,005
Take her and show
what is there on that?

305
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,907
Yeah, what is there on that?
Let them go

306
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,618
l'm not going, if he sees me
perhaps he may have a third attack

307
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,321
Man, that will be a change
Hey girl, who'll make the concept?

308
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,427
Really getting tensed for
not getting any idea

309
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,065
Come on, all this ideas will come

310
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,092
This ads concept is
within you, man

311
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,936
lf anything is wished to
the fullest, we'll get that-

312
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,836
- that's what our Paulochan has told

313
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,841
Who?
Our Paulo Coelho

314
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,041
Yeah, that Paulochan is it?

315
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,563
Honestly isn't he
bit of over rated?

316
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,002
l too had the same humbug
till l started reading it

317
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:27,277
You know..lts the simplicity of his
books that made him so popular

318
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,481
So, you are aware of that is it?
Yeah, why not?

319
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,417
l agree with him, cent
percent on that what he told

320
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,284
Then how can a person
like you, get me?

321
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,428
lndeed, morning itself
Achayan is in a humour mood

322
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:51,291
Comedy?
After purchasing this

323
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,529
What came out from ATM
machine my account balance slip

324
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,934
That was comedy

325
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,344
James?
What's the price of this?

326
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,679
Not that much expensive

327
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,718
From your father's
acres of rubber estate

328
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,052
Probably one to one and a
half cent, in some corner of it

329
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,094
Only that much
Have you gone mad?

330
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,326
Madness is present since
long ago but sure on one thing

331
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,064
What? - lf you don't pass in
the next week's bank test

332
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,969
ln the life of James and Alice
poverty and hardships will be-

333
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,770
'-a life long companion'

334
00:28:46,958 --> 00:29:13,911

why did you shake off swiftly?''

345
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:05,557
''Hey drizzle, drizzle pours like
an ink that colours the soul''

346
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,828
''As if someone has
splashed the colours''

347
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:43,760
''Didn't you spread on my page?''

348
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:49,563
''At night when the rivers
converges with the sea''

349
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:55,345
''From your wide-eye
haven't l read this?''

350
00:31:55,947 --> 00:32:06,619
''Hey drizzle, drizzle pours like
an ink that colours the soul''

351
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:18,632
''lnside the life's pen,
its filled with colour of female''

352
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:24,674
''You sing like a white dove,
that symbolises the colour''

353
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:30,379
''You are the colour that
soothes smouldering pain''

354
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:48,922
''Hey drizzle, drizzle pours like
an ink that colours the soul''

355
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,352
James, have it

356
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,690
This is Mercy, younger
sister of Alice

357
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,789
That's their mother Soosan

358
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,394
James you may have tea

359
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,867
Shall we not come to the topic?

360
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,673
Look James, l'm a NRl

361
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,508
On seeing the set up over
here will know-

362
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,741
-its more or less rich

363
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,519
That belongs to both
of my daughters

364
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,483
My approach is
an open perspective

365
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,715
Just because of that-

366
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,555
- l'm not interested to play
a villain in your love story

367
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,663
l know its not going
to work out also

368
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,723
lts not a problem for me that
you don't have kith and kin

369
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:00,894
The problem is you don't have a
job which fetches a regular income

370
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,997
Saying that you an
artist, assistant director-

371
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,939
- that's all a kind of an obtuse

372
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,738
Won't get much of an income
because of that reason

373
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,542
lts inconvenient to marry
off my daughter to James

374
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,626
Father, its not like that
we've got some exact plans

375
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,921
Haven't l written two
or three bank test?

376
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,723
Sure to find a job somewhere

377
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,094
By that time, James will
posses an own ad agency

378
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,935
Only an expectation that
tomorrow will get that and this

379
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,037
What is owned today
That's the reality

380
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,373
lf it is decided to live with
your income from yourjob

381
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,813
l'll only call him
'an employed husband!'

382
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,415
Love is only an infatuation

383
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,557
The truth is reality, will understand
that when you start to live

384
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:59,156
Over here, like any father l also wish
for the good future of my daughter

385
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,959
For Alice l've found a MBA
bridegroom hailing from a good family

386
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,997
l'm doing the duty of a father

387
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,633
On the contrary

388
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,367
lf you intend to marry
disdaining my words

389
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,873
That can be decided today

390
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,006
Later don't come to
this house again-

391
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,644
- saying kids education,
car, house loan and all

392
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,146
Wonderful tea!

393
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,210
For the first time l'm drinking
this tea mixed with cardamom

394
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,714
But more than this tea
what l liked is sir's presentation

395
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,765
My love, for me its
not a mere infatuation

396
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,033
Perhaps Davis Thekkeparambil
may not know that but you know it

397
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,841
Alice, the decision is yours

398
00:36:27,151 --> 00:37:05,619
Team DrC

399
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,305
Daughter, you may get down

400
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:42,690
Daughter!

401
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,697
lt was okay

402
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,645
Little one!

403
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,347
Why is mother like this?
What is daughter's name?

404
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,050
Pinky
That's a good name

405
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,317
l'm your Mercy aunty, do you
know this grandmother's name?

406
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,684
l know that
Soosan

407
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:23,228
My name in the school
is lzabell Soosan James

408
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,131
Father?
He is inside

409
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,636
The doctor sir's
order is not to get up

410
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,933
l'm Alexander, Mercy's..
Yeah, l knew

411
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,235
Come, come
All come in -Come daughter

412
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,271
l've booked a room
in a near by resort

413
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,010
Long back l've promised
to Davis sir-

414
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,621
- that l'll never step
inside this threshold

415
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,915
lts not fair that l violate that

416
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,786
Aunty, that tea with cardamom smell-

417
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,623
-its taste is still there on the tongue

418
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,393
Papa, are you going?
Daughter, Papa has got some work

419
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,271
Daughter, you stay here
talking to grandma and grandpa

420
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,738
After two days Papa will
come and pick you up

421
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:05,705
Okay?

422
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,109
Should draw a good painting
to grandpa and give, okay

423
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,743
Alice, there is range for mobile..

424
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,254
Bye!

425
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,717
Papa, bye!

426
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,002
Daughter, you come

427
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,240
Dear one, don't you
want to see grandpa?

428
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,254
Look, just see who this is
Come, come

429
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,395
Grandpa's, dear one is beautiful

430
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,799
Our Alice was also just like this
when she was young isn't it?

431
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:14,873
Come

432
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:24,914
Sit

433
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,785
Girl, are you fine?

434
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:40,971
James?

435
00:40:50,014 --> 00:41:16,000
Team DrC

436
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,238
Yeah, keep it there

437
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,143
Brought the ice cubes, no?
l forgot to tell

438
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,844
Sir, l'm in this profession
for the last 18 years

439
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,277
On seeing the person, l know

440
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,181

00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,226
Was running distillery at Ponkunnam

442
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,157
Right from there, on seeing
the person, its decided

443
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,389
What to be added into
the frying pan

444
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,163
Since we came to know,
sir you may wish in your mind

445
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,863
This Zavior will bring it here

446
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,539
Wants to have a drink?
All this won't suit my taste

447
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,074
For us..

448
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,569
Okay then

00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,222
Sir, you wish in your mind, this
Zavior will bring it here on the spot

451
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:51,561
My brother Zavior, where
were you all these years?

452
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,071
Yeah, Alice

453
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,252
Are you busy?
Wanted to discuss a matter

454
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,555
Busy..A bit
Come on tell

455
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,652
Father wants to meet James

456
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,585
What? Davis Thekkeparambil
sir wants to meet me?

457
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,097
What happened?

458
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,629
Hey James? -Okay, okay
Where is the daughter, Pinky?

459
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,998
She is all very much here

460
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,476
Pinky wait there

461
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,136
Why l called is James
should come and meet father

462
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,642
Not only father, everyone here
is expecting arrival of James

463
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,418
After coming to this threshold and
going back its something like..

464
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,217
Keep out all the personal
issues with me

465
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,288
James why can't you
come here and go?

466
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,656
Alice, there is an urgent
call waiting for me

467
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,155
But James..
l'll call you back

468
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,297
So, James is going to come here
ls it sure?

469
00:43:59,036 --> 00:43:59,502
Swamy?

470
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,335
Nandhu, for both of
us for Tuesday morning

471
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,032
Book tickets to Bombay

472
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,167
To Bombay?
What is that for?

473
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,210
We are going to meet
our new client

474
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,679
On saying a client,
you say it clearly

475
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,166
l've told check out is the bill ready?

476
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,258
Father, slowly

477
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,102
What brings sir to here?
Shouldn't travel

478
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,232
Being adamant to meet,then
there is no other way

479
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,263
Please come

480
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:50,609
l liked your obstinacy, should need
a bit as you are a male

481
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,305
No sir, its not out of obstinacy
l was..

482
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,015
Yeah, understood

483
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,281
Son, you may forget what
l've told during that time

484
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,451
After all father of two girls, no?
Also insolence of money

485
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,184
Just take it as a
mistake by tongue

486
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,529
Today l feel sorry for that

487
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:11,199
Pardon, you must come
home along with father

488
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,432
My goodness, such an
explanation was not required

489
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:17,131
l'll come but not now

490
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,843
Actually l was about to start an
urgentjourney pertaining to work

491
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,739
Will be back within two days,
l'll come as soon as l return

492
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,810
Will you come?
Or is it to avoid me?

493
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,176
No sir, l'll come
Sir, you may go

494
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,348
Not sir, l like to hear
you calling father

495
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,172
He'll come

496
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:22,671
Team DrC

497
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,469
You play that once again

498
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,142
This transition is the problem
We've reached, okay

499
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,108
Where is he?
Hi girl

500
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,241
On calling why can't
you pick up the phone?

501
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:47,892
Porotta!

502
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,457
Porotta!

503
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,885
So, we'll fix this one

504
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,652
Again if we sit here,
will keep working on it

505
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:14,484
Yeah -We'll have each tea from that
Tamil guy's shop and disperse

506
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,955
ls Porotta available?
Porotta?

507
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,660
Yesterday the way you ate it,
Porotta will come after a month

508
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:20,854
But l didn't eat anything
First go and take bath

509
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,431
Really stinks
Will you bathe me?

510
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,329
Go man, what a thing
to give a bath?

511
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,595
Not necessary
Only if you want

512
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,271
Man, have you met K.T?
Why should l meet him?

513
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,897
lts not any sort of favour, we
work in his building by paying rent

514
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,879
Those people are from
Straight Line group, isn't it?

515
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,782
They are here since few days

516
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,916
So, that's it some big corporate
deal is going to crack

517
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,286
James, there's nothing of that sort-

518
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,753
-l'll tell correctly what's the screen
play which is going to happen overthere

519
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,556
Okay tell, let me hear

521
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,467
Scene number 2, nothing to worry-

522
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,469
- everything will be
cared by Lord Bali

523
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,808
Nothing to worry, everything
will be cared by Lord Bali

524
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,778
Scene number 3, l'll do
it cheaper than anyone else

525
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,644
Yeah, l'll do it cheaper
than anyone else

526
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,547
Yeah, in this field
boss is the cheapest!

527
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:18,685
Shucks!

528
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,889
No, l mean doing at a lower price
Yes, that's it

529
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,218
Okay then you may have
the tea and come, bye

530
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,965
Come and go buddy, its a
tea break, no? -l haven't packed

531
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,494
Shall we push off?.
James, don't be late

532
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,701
Then, l'm also going
No, l want to have tea

533
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,931
Okay you have it
No, money? - Pay it!

534
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,675
Where is the purse?
l haven't taken the purse

535
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,803
You tramp! Actually do you
have a purse like that?

536
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,314
Knows it!

537
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,618
Should wait
Okay mam

538
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,460
Among the internationally
reputed artists my works

539
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,028
l won't compel, its up to
you that's all

540
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,730
As l've told..For me

541
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,458
Yeah, have you reached?
Has the time approached?

542
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,470
No, l just came bit early
You are the guy, no?

543
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,573
Hi -We had..
At the pub

544
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,046
One of the belief is, life is
nothing but chasing dreams

545
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,481
An in born artist must
come back to his dreams

546
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,556
Hey buddy, exhibition
starts by next month

547
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,380
What was that
secret conversation going on?

548
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,949
Simply advising, there is
no cost incurred to advise

549
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:57,915
You may sit, l'll get ready
and come

550
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,923
Don't be late okay
Ten minutes

551
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,331
Hello
Hello, Papa its me

552
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,738
Hey Pinky daughter,
what are you doing there?

553
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:25,812
l was watching cartoon here and
then Papa -ls it water colours?

554
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:26,983
Done!

555
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:28,909
Papa will buy it and come

556
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,754
What l had with me is
completely finished, that's why

557
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,687
When will Papa come?
Two days

558
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:39,162
How is your Grandpa?
Grandpa..!

559
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:44,156
Mother, mother
Ask to mother, l'll give

560
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,502
Daughter..!
Papa, waiting, mother talk

561
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,437
Hello

562
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,194
Trespassing is a punishable offense
James!

563
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,132
As you had passed out
from fine arts college-

564
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,501
- and on saying you
know to sketch some what

565
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,700
l never expected that will
be such a under statement

566
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,010
Look, don't feel bad on saying

567
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,711
There isn't much to
categorise and call as a painter

568
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,982
Feeds a family by doing a
work which is not of big interest

569
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,228
The biggest interest in life-

570
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,463
- spends time on it when free
time is obtained once in a while

571
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,896
This isn't my story alone, l know

572
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,797
Truly..This is more like
a stress release now

573
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,203
While spending some time
over here at night

574
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,239
Realises the life has
got a form and structure

575
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,015
Does all this have any meaning?

576
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,079
Memories, images, moments

577
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,086
Like that, many are these

578
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,653
When brush touches the
canvas, what had inspired us?

579
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:56,960
Very often we realise that,
when that painting is completed

580
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,597
How many colours does
each one has on it

581
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,146
You know..l was
originally a charcoal artist

582
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,076
On the white canvas
there were only dark lines

583
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:18,953
The James as an artist

584
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:20,987
Till..!

585
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,791
Till l discovered my first colour

586
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,890
Alice?
Yeah!

587
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,159
The first colour that
l discovered is Alice

588
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,270
She is my muse

589
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,668
Her love is my inspiration

590
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,675
Our happiness is the
art of mine that you see here

591
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,747
Later after it was lost

592
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,647
Do you know on how many
nights, l had sat idly-?

593
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,552
-in front of a blank canvas

594
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,830
l know another James very close
who is disgusting to the core

595
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,337
lf not..l would have loved you

596
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,301
Go..Get ready fast

597
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,181
'Straight Line!'

598
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,705
You stinking rascal!

599
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,902
This is created by using
brain day and night!

600
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:34,142
When you sold this, how much
money you got,should flee with that

601
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,087
Go and..
Go and eat it fellow!

602
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,963
Don't hurt me, l'm a sick person

603
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,202
l expected James to do it!

604
00:58:07,917 --> 00:59:19,119
Team DrC

605
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,226
l had tried several times..But!

606
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,195
Phone was switch off

607
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,212
Papa!

608
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,400
Papa, hills should be
given green colour, no?

609
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,512
Come on tell Papa

610
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,646
Hills should be painted green, no?

611
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,241
Yeah

612
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,120
Then the sky is blue, no?

613
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,546
Yeah

614
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,290
The heaven is next to sky is it?

615
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,826
What's the colour of heaven?

616
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,328
For heaven..For heaven, white
Why is that?

617
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:33,165
The colour of the paper on which
we draw is white in colour, no?

618
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,736
On the white paper, using
the colours which we like

619
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,546
Can draw the pictures what we like

620
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,713
The heaven is like that

621
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,086
While going to heaven, we
can do whatever we like

622
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:48,781
That's is the reason -Grandma,
has told grandpa went to heaven

623
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,620
And from now on he'll live there

624
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,824
Do you know why Alex uncle had
put the spectacles for grandpa?

625
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,528
That's to read paper from heaven

626
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:58,859
lsn't it mummy?

627
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,762
lf you want anything,
why can't you tell me?

628
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,295
Alice, are you mad?

629
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,164
Leave it, never mind

630
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:39,563
Okay never mind, leave it

631
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,517
Alice!

632
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:37,952
Alice!

633
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:10,023
'For me, its really suffocating
in here, l'm leaving'

634
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,958
'Also taking Pinky along with me'

635
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,573
You really need a strong tea

636
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,713
l'll make it
You people may sit

637
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,083
Hey girl!
Come on, look here!

638
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,989
Are you serious?
Please don't cross me

639
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,090
The peon at the bank
will find a flat

640
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,595
Only till that time

641
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,969
Show it

642
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:12,984
Give

643
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,522
ls Alice inside?
Yeah she's there

644
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,958
James, are you intending
for a quarrel?

645
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,467
This is a flat where
families stay near by

646
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,636
Sir, you may just give this to Alice

647
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,576
lts the spare key of our house

648
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,614
lf the present atmosphere out
there is discomfort for her

649
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,913
But whenever she
feels to come back

650
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:50,651
Should tell her, there is no
need to ask anyone's permission

651
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,028
Shall l take leave?

652
01:08:53,028 --> 01:09:04,963
Team DrC

653
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,208
''Did it broke..?''

654
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:18,177
''Life, like one among
those statues of glass''

655
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:24,048
''Separated..?''
Papa, Papa!

656
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:32,592
''Which one among these paths..?''

657
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:47,076
''Yet again here..Both souls are
ready to smoulder in grief''

658
01:09:47,216 --> 01:10:00,220
''Each and every minute..Both
melted..ln the same way

659
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:05,063
''Did they wriggle?''

660
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,190
Hello, who is it?
Sir, its James

661
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,489
Yeah, James

662
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:39,634
l..l like to see the daughter

663
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:53,147
''Bygone days..ls it
covered by breeze?''

664
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:59,982
''ls the shadow of moonlight at the
backdrop fading to somewhere?''

665
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:06,822
''We both had completely
forgotten to see within ourselves''

666
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:12,798
''Have we got accustomed
to become strangers?

667
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:19,838
''As if we were like dusk''

668
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:25,914
''You vanished after
splashing some colours''

669
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:33,847
''l wandered in the woods of grief'

670
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:39,256
''Like a termite struck
page which fell down''

671
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,823
''Did it broke..?''

672
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:53,669
''Life, like one among
those statues of glass''

673
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,942
''Separated..?''

674
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,742
''Did it broke..?''

675
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:38,385
''A smile..Like a petal
of flower at dawn''

676
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:51,697
''Did it got cut..?
''Words..ln the half way''

677
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:58,730
''Today, where is it..?
Where are the desires?

678
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:05,109
Where is it..?
That love forgotten to caress''

679
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:12,417
''My love..Where are you?''

680
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:18,225
''Where is it..?
That nest weaved with dreams''

681
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,130
''ls it drained out?''

682
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:32,666
''Eyes like rain clouds..
Are they wet again?''

683
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:38,035
Hey girl, what are you doing?
Spoiling the wall? Give it

684
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,438
Throw that
Hey Alice!

685
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,952
lsn't she a kid? Are you
beating her for a small thing

686
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,280
A kid! She isjust like father!

687
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:54,457
''Did it broke..?''

688
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:39,506

months, on October 27th

01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,030
Alice
Alice James

693
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,129
James?

694
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,161
Was it a love marriage?
ls it?

695
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:18,069
How many years after the marriage?
Seven years

696
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,976
Seven years?

697
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,247
And only now have
you reached here?

698
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,588
Good, actually what's
the problem between you?

699
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,225
Small?

700
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,793
Then what..?
Dowry related..

701
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,229
Sir, domestic violence

702
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,029
Thank you
ls it that one?

703
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,371
Yeah understood
So its immoral

704
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:48,570
ls it?

705
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,544
Not that one also

706
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,315
Generally people come here
with such kind of problems

707
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,245
So, this is something above that

708
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:02,548
Then Alice you may
open your mind, l'll listen

709
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,817
Open it

710
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:17,062
Sir, there are lot of problems,
don't know it'll be over-

711
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:20,264
-on saying it before sir within a day

712
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,907
But l know one thing

713
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,142
For me and James
can't live together again

714
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:37,015
Thinking to live happily
through out the life

715
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,891
l came with James

716
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,593
Father, mother and sister
who loved me a lot

717
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,133
Above their happiness

718
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,360
l liked James

719
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,435
Had the trust

720
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,167
But after some time

721
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:56,002
My likes and dislikes was
not important for James

722
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:58,569
James had a world of his own

723
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,608
Friends, discussion,
shooting, painting

724
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:04,918
Had no time to spend with us

725
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,556
To me and daughter didn't even
have time to look at face and talk

726
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,562
l'm working in a bank, till this
moment hadn't come there

727
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,561
Nor had met my friends

728
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:21,361
During certain functions at the
bank, all comes with the family

729
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,935
But only me, alone

730
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,430
Along with daughter

731
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,434
Really loves the daughter-

732
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,012
-but sir you just ask in which
class she is studying?

733
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,545
Just ask what is the fees there?

734
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:40,483
What more? Tomorrow its a
special day in our life

735
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:43,956
For the last so many years, James
had not even thought of it

736
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,199
Tomorrow, what is it?
What is it, tomorrow?

737
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:58,065
Sir, won't remember
No time for that

738
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,202
Tomorrow is daughter's birth day

739
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:06,213
ln his mind, there is only ad, models,
big position, money and all

740
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,574
ln between that where is time to
attend minorthings of ours?

741
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,043
What l want is my
husband's presence, care

742
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,953
Towards my minor complaints,
his considerations

743
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,757
How is that?
lf wanting to talk something

744
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:23,258
Full time he is on the phone

745
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,332
Everything is delegated to me, no?

746
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,667
l should attend to the
daughter's matters at school

747
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,100
l should pay the insurance

748
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,000
l should attend the
residents association meeting

749
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,333
l should bring the gas

750
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,272
l should purchase house hold
items, rice, vegetables and all

751
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,309
All these doesn't affect him at all

752
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,014
While coming at night he sits at the
Ashram, next door saying painting

753
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,011
l even don't know what
time he comes and sleeps

754
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,080
Now sir, you may tell
how can l live with him?

755
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:59,827
Team DrC

756
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,701
Now, James you may say

757
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:05,363
Go on tell

758
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,248
Alice, you may drink some water

759
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:31,064
Alice, aren't these issues
happening in all families?

760
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,266
ls it required to blow up these
silly matters and make it big?

761
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:38,731
True, for sir and those who
hear this, may sound this silly

762
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,774
But for me its not like that

763
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,509
My father called me back
to the house after 8 years

764
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,616
That sick person pleaded with him

765
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,618
Just come home and go

766
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,080
On that day also James was busy

767
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,359
When own wife's
father was about to die

768
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,222
What busy schedule that
can't be postponed-

769
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,193
- which husband will have that sir?

770
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:16,705
Good morning James
Not really!

771
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:19,680
Was not a good morning

772
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,408
Why daughter hasn't come?
No, went to school

773
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,243
Anyway congrats!

774
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:28,450
lnside, lawyer's client
really shook me!

775
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:32,793
Honestly, today only l realised
that l'm such an agitator!

776
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,359
Sir, one minute

777
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,201
Sir, you should do a help for me

778
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,797
Tomorrow its the birth
day of my daughter-

779
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:47,670
- that too l recollected that
when Alice told that now

780
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,844
l've a wish that she should
celebrate that-

781
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:53,176
- with her Papa and Mom together

782
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,113
Perhaps again won't
get a chance forthat

783
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:59,615
Can sirtalk this to
Alice and make her agree?

784
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,187
Done!

785
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,190
lts my word

786
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:26,237
On taking DTP on a medium
font, it'll come to four full pages

787
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,905
The list of complaints on me
which you told from inside

788
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:32,783
At least two sentences in that
which you should have told me-

789
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,649
- openly while living together

790
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,179
Yeah!

791
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:03,885
How is this one?

792
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,980
This one? For your
daughter who is six years old?

793
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:33,338
Team DrC

794
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,809
Hey man, how many of this kind?
Has shopped the entire shop!

795
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:41,285
Let it be, sometimes such a birth day
celebration might not happen again

796
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:46,653
Man, what is this?

797
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,295
Through an open
talk can be solved-

798
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:50,989
- only such problems exist
in the live of you and Alice

799
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:56,367
Yeah, yesterday before the
councillor she spoke very well!

800
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:00,372
And has told very clearly all the
problems have ended with this

801
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:07,041
Nandhu, don't know whether
there is a life ahead as a husband

802
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,817
But l'm also a father!

803
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,690
lf my daughter is lost..

804
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,530
Pal, l won't be able to hold on..!

805
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,606
Man, if l'm late still more
l may miss the Bangalore flight

806
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,873
Okay you push off

Of James?

Doctor is there

834
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:53,363
Outside there isn't much injury but
there is internal injury and bleeding

835
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:55,203
And there is one fracture in the ribs

836
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:59,007
Yeah Alex - Sir
Come in

837
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,205
For sometime, we were together

838
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:05,215
Doctor, anything serious?

839
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,782
Can't say under
temporary observation

840
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:13,823
Then, we are all present

01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,927
Thank you doctor
Okay then

842
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,934
Alex, haemorrhage is quite bad
A clot is formed

843
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:33,205
No other option,
other than a surgery

844
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,314
l'm sure, you know the risk

845
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,216
Alice
No need uncle

01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,324

Please sit
Doctor, anything..?

849
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,237
No, problem but
still under observation

850
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:01,131
Then, Dr.Mohan Menon
he is one of the best doctors

851
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:03,140
Because of that, there
is nothing to worry

852
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,401
ForAlice there is room
facility over here-

853
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,604

854
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:13,077
Anyway l'll be here if anything
is required l'll call, okay

855
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,144
Yes, mother -Daughter,

856
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,381
Are you fine? Where is the child?
She is here

857
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:52,993
Good, is there any
major injury for James?

858
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:55,226
Alex, had mentioned it

859
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:59,332
Heard only this and
there but still really tensed

860
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:01,492
And you aren't picking
up the phone on calling

861
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:04,400
Are you at the hospital?
Mother l'll call you back

you consult a doctor there itself?.

01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,471
Hello?
Hello?

Has made bread and jam

866
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:36,996
ln most of the accident cases, the
worst scenario is brain haemorrhage

867
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:46,233
Removing such clots through surgery,
there are risks involved

868
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,205
Especially when the
patient is not conscious

869
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,005
To anaesthetise the patient
and conduct the operation

870
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:52,577
l had spoken to Alex

871
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:56,512
Time required to wear
off anaesthesia -

872
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,618
- its been already close
to eleven hours now

873
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:01,379
Which means in
the usual procedure-

874
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:03,217
- the patient should have
woken up by now

875
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:08,457
But James is still now..

876
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,588
James!

877
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:46,658
Come on!

878
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:48,192
Wake up!

879
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:02,178
What a repose is this?

880
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:07,851
Wake up!
James!

881
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:16,158
Yeah, like that
Yes, like that

882
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:39,716
Who are you?
lf its the designation? Auditor

883
01:37:41,455 --> 01:37:44,618
An auditor who has come
to take the arithmetic of your life

884
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:54,526
Am l dead?

885
01:37:58,172 --> 01:37:59,139
Do you want to die?

886
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,205
James haven't you heard?

887
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,936
ln the moments just before death

888
01:38:06,313 --> 01:38:09,339
Human beings watch their
past just as a movie

889
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:14,181
l've come with two balcony
tickets for that movie

890
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:22,693
Who are you?

891
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,196
When human beings
die and goes up

892
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,766
Takes the account
of sins and virtues

893
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,629
Takes the decision whether
the doors of heaven-

894
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:31,737
-should be opened
or not, Saint Chitragupta

895
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:33,735
Can say like that
in a figurative way

896
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:40,704
Come on shake hand
with Pathrose

897
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:46,781
Still now not cleared
off from the doubt, is it?

898
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:52,490
At first there will be some confusion,
later on everything will be clear

899
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:59,694
James, on diving into
the depths of death

900
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,664
Before you end up into
the cold silence of darkness

901
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:07,735
We have time left
fortaking the account

902
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,276
Well, you are a handsome guy

903
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:24,718
Come man

904
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,806
Come don't be scared James

905
01:39:45,446 --> 01:40:33,289
Team DrC

906
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:38,556
Looks like someone
has driven it after booze

907
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:39,596
Not on alcohol

908
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:40,893
lts a cool mobile phone, no?

909
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,003
Wants what's up and
face book while driving

910
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:45,401
Anyway one guy might have died

911
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:47,005
lf the vehicle has got insurance

912
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:49,666
Family will get some money
That's all

913
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,936
lf ten die like this, others will learn

914
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,044
To this side

915
01:40:57,918 --> 01:41:01,046
This is..
Yeah, that's it..Your car, your place

916
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:09,588
Poor fellow, not even
one minute left

917
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,363
What?
Life!

918
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:15,833
What, life?

919
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:17,765
Yeah, finished!

920
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,472
Hey man accident
Not finished saying it

921
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:22,074
Come running

922
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:22,909
Take!

923
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,568
By the way brother, just think

924
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:26,973
ln an year 365 days

925
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:32,551
What an average 60 year old
person gets is 21 ,900 days

926
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:35,746
ln that half of the time, is night
Will be sleeping

927
01:41:36,156 --> 01:41:38,818
And the balance is 10,950

928
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:43,789
Within these few days each
one does their nonsense

929
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:48,066
What to do?

930
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:52,929
lts not a joke, those people
who sleep at noon-

931
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,405
- life expectancy will be
still more reduced

932
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,568
Up to 15 years of age
must live obeying the parents

933
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:01,175
After 55 years of age must
live obeying the children

934
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:04,541
ln between that some
where around 30 to 35 years

935
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,985
ln short, 11 ,280 day time

936
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,151
Only that much left in
this pocket of human beings

937
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:17,621
Which means, in short the human
being aren't that much a big affair!

938
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:19,756
Look, only this much

939
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:24,430
Just look at that person
12, 730

940
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:27,104
Then did you see that
person with 'kakki' shirt

941
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,505
He is 4030

942
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:33,639
Did you see that family overthere?
For the lady life expectancy is less

943
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:35,139
706

944
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:38,042
Husband is 4012

945
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:43,116
Each one's expiry date is
stamped and send to here

946
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:08,703
Why are we here?

947
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:14,747
While taking the account statement,
auditor first notices the last figure

948
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:16,756
The grand total

949
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:19,984
After splitting from there,
thought of coming to first part

950
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:23,893
ln your case, finishing the arithmetic
and it was closed, over here

951
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:26,062
Your grand total

952
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:28,466
The end!

953
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:23,705
Now did you understand?

954
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:26,711
Yesterday about this spot
where you fell and wriggled

955
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:28,753
Today no one is bothered about it

956
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:33,187
With the passing of a day,
over here some dried marks only

957
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:37,724
With the evening shower,
that will also vanish

958
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,862
No body cares, the
life is only that much

959
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:57,383
But any death will
leave some memories

960
01:45:58,151 --> 01:46:01,211
ln the minds of few,
at least for some time

961
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:03,278
You should know what it is

962
01:46:16,703 --> 01:46:20,696
By all medical parameters
James is in coma at present

963
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:29,875
Team DrC

964
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:32,878
l didn't mean to say
you should leave the hope

965
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:58,937
Aunty, when will he wake up?
Daughter don't make the sound

966
01:47:01,982 --> 01:47:03,950
Daughter, what did the doctor say?

967
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:06,947
Mother when is Papa discharged?

968
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,785
What is it daughter? Come on
tell is there any problem?

969
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,024
Mother..That is..

970
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:18,128
Just landed, came to know right
now, came here right now

971
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:20,697
Yeah, let me see whether
l can see James

972
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:22,027
l'll call you after seeing

973
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,968
Shall we not return
after seeing James?

974
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:31,869
Anyone of James? -Yeah l'm
Godwin, Godwin Narendran

975
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:34,810
Krishna, today morning only
l came to know about the news

976
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:37,281
l was on a tour Berlin Biennale
is going on is it?

977
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:40,215
Was just roaming through
Berlin and Paris

978
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:42,520
Can't say anything at this moment

979
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:45,257
Nancy, in between l had tried
to call him two or three times

980
01:47:45,392 --> 01:47:46,723
But he skipped off

981
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:52,197
l also like him very much

982
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:57,326
Ahh! Now what's the use of saying?

983
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,301
James is not dead!

984
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:30,197
Not bad, man!

985
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:44,044
The person who has got the
God's presence on the fingertips

986
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:48,277
James, your paintings
talk by its own, brother

987
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,531
But James, this is incomplete

988
01:49:06,072 --> 01:49:08,131
ln this there is only
Alice and daughter

989
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,866
When you are also on
this, only then it becomes a family

990
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:19,281
lt has been few years,
l being a misfit in that frame

991
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:25,815
On her complaint list

992
01:49:25,992 --> 01:49:27,960
There isn't one right thing about me

993
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:36,431
Right now she must be
thinking marrying such-

994
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,435
-a person like me is a blunder!

995
01:49:39,606 --> 01:49:41,073
So, you know that!

996
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:53,612
Hey fellow, can ask an immature
question? lts bit of personal

997
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,619
When did you last
say to Alice, l love you?

998
01:50:03,096 --> 01:50:04,120
What?

999
01:50:04,631 --> 01:50:07,191
One year, two year back?

1000
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,867
Might not remember

1001
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:16,876
During the time of love everyday at
least once you used to say l love you

1002
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:20,477
When not seen for an hour
immediately will message

1003
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:25,344
l miss you, l miss you fellow
miss you dear, sweet one..

1004
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:27,110
All kinds of crap like that!

1005
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:31,085
Rice pastel!
What all sweet dialogues

1006
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:34,886
Didn't you marry
Alice who was your lover?

1007
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:42,325
ln front of a gathering to hold close
your lover, how bold you were?

1008
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:45,333
Same girl when she
became your wife

1009
01:50:45,538 --> 01:50:48,200
Why did that boldness
become a shame?

1010
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:51,336
Leave all that-

1011
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:53,535
- how many years it has been-

1012
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,046
- since you looked at the face
of Alice and smiled with love?

1013
01:50:58,351 --> 01:50:59,648
Peter, are you married?

1014
01:51:00,286 --> 01:51:02,550
All that is not meant for us!

1015
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:05,321
Just marry and see then you'll know

1016
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:10,225
Husband is not a lover, he
has got his own responsibilities

1017
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:14,192
Not that, like you say on sitting
looking at the face with a smile!

1018
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:17,667
Daughter's school
fees, car loan, house loan

1019
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:19,534
Professional loan, personal loan

1020
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:22,197
ln the mist of all this
have to create a life

1021
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:25,071
So, everything is running
on loan is it? -Yeah

1022
01:51:25,211 --> 01:51:28,044
lts on loan from the milk boy
who comes home to deliver-

1023
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:30,512
-milk to Ambani, everyone
is on loan

1024
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:34,085
Without knowing all this auditor
Peter has started from there

1025
01:51:34,254 --> 01:51:38,520
Buddy James, l have not come to
take the details of your bank loan

1026
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:42,053
To make you recollect
certain calculations in life-

1027
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:43,388
- where you made mistakes

1028
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,721
Even if it is arithmetic or science
the exam is over, isn't it?

1029
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:50,261
Received the marks
and also 'a red line!'

1030
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:53,666
Failed!
Now can't correct it

1031
01:51:54,407 --> 01:51:58,036
James its possible to
correct for everyone

1032
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:01,238
But before red line falls!

1033
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:08,752
ln your life itself there
are many examples of that

1034
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:13,587
Mummy Papa has come

1035
01:52:15,428 --> 01:52:18,727
What? Listen K.T
l've told a hundred times

1036
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:21,465
From now on l'll never work for you

1037
01:52:21,601 --> 01:52:25,196
This time only because of one
person Nandhu, l took up the project

1038
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:28,771
Hey man, should like
your own profession

1039
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:30,770
Must love the work which you do

1040
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:34,473
Like wife

1041
01:52:36,516 --> 01:52:38,575
Shucks!
You call tomorrow

1042
01:52:39,185 --> 01:52:41,415
Papa!
My sweet one!

1043
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,782
Come here, did Papa's beloved
one wait for a long time at school?

1044
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,091
What to do?

1045
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:50,424
Today Papa finished the shooting
early and came there fast

1046
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,691
Then what happened? By the time
your mom came and picked you up

1047
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:55,266
Did Papa come to school?
Then what?

1048
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:59,464
Today Papa reached there
by driving in a risky manner

1049
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:02,331
On the way, there was a quarrel
with the lady who rides a scooter

1050
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:04,340
But during all that time
what l had in mind was

1051
01:53:04,477 --> 01:53:06,843
lf l'm late to come, your mom
will come and pick you up

1052
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:09,342
Your mom is smart, no?

1053
01:53:11,217 --> 01:53:14,482
By the way where
is my welcome home kiss

1054
01:53:15,688 --> 01:53:17,622
Hey girl
Get down -My goodness!

1055
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:20,259
Didn't l say to learn
rhymes? Go and read it

1056
01:53:22,328 --> 01:53:23,192
Pinky!

1057
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:40,674
Today is it chicken?

1058
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:45,674
Was your phone
switched off today?

1059
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:48,286
Do you know how
many time l called?

1060
01:53:48,421 --> 01:53:50,582
The last call l did
was from the school gate

1061
01:53:50,723 --> 01:53:52,850
On coming to know you had
left from there with the child

1062
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:55,757
Here, did you see?
l don't want to see

1063
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58,830
Alice, if you start like this..

1064
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:04,168
My goodness! When did you tell
me to pick up child from school?

1065
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:07,433
Today afternoon don't you
know that l've shooting today?

1066
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,608
The same thing if you
had told me before-

1067
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:11,505
-l would have canceled
the shooting today

1068
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,907
Which means..
ln between the shooting

1069
01:54:16,282 --> 01:54:18,682
l would have arranged some means
to pick up daughter from school

1070
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:27,922
Dear, with your scorn face-

1071
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:31,128
-again and again if you make me
an offender, that's not fair at all

1072
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:34,128
Even otherwise today whole
day for me was a big head ache

1073
01:54:34,334 --> 01:54:36,268
That stupid fellow K.T

1074
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:39,132
Dumped an international
waste concept on the head

1075
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:42,400
Had a quarrel to shoot that and
at last out of no way l whacked

1076
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:43,873
Did you whack?

1077
01:54:44,944 --> 01:54:47,936
Did the ad but could
have whacked

1078
01:54:48,481 --> 01:54:51,143
Since that Nandhu and camera man
came in between he was unhurt

1079
01:54:51,284 --> 01:54:53,252
Anyway by today
l've come to a decision

1080
01:54:53,353 --> 01:54:56,880
l'm not for any job which
disturbs the homely matters

1081
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:58,952
Tomorrow after getting
a promotion or transfer-

1082
01:54:59,225 --> 01:54:59,919
-when you shift the place and go

1083
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,727
l've to take care of daughter's
matters all alone, isn't it?

1084
01:55:02,328 --> 01:55:04,353
So, you are concerned about it

1085
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:11,326
Dear, is it because l'm not
concerned,situation is like that, no?

1086
01:55:11,804 --> 01:55:13,829
You understand
this Achayan (Husband)

1087
01:55:14,674 --> 01:55:16,801
Not because l don't understand it

1088
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:19,741
Daughter was alone, there
l know

1089
01:55:19,846 --> 01:55:23,441
l know its a big mistake
and l'm sorry and -

1090
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:25,982
- never again l'll repeat a
situation like this from my side

1091
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:29,949
Promise?
Yeah, promise

1092
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:32,219
Then promise me by
touching on the head

1093
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,394
True!

1094
01:55:37,897 --> 01:55:39,262
Hey you!
My God!

1095
01:55:39,966 --> 01:55:41,695
No need
Stop there you fellow

1096
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:45,595
My God
Stop

1097
01:55:59,052 --> 01:56:00,815
Papa leave

1098
01:56:00,987 --> 01:56:03,421
Leave l say
Leave

1099
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:04,988
Come here you fellow

1100
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:16,358
ln the world is there more
beautiful sight than this?

1101
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:18,667
Happy family

1102
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:22,372
This is what is called''Kudumbam''
harmony when united

1103
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:26,806
Good, seems like third rate
insurance company's ad

1104
01:56:27,013 --> 01:56:29,948
You could have
introduced to that K.T

1105
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:32,813
When the head is on
fire, my dear brother-

1106
01:56:32,952 --> 01:56:35,853
- we ordinary people find it
bit difficult to act as you say

1107
01:56:36,055 --> 01:56:38,353
l'm a person who speaks
as it is what is in the mind

1108
01:56:38,524 --> 01:56:40,685
This is almost like saying
neitherthis way or that way

1109
01:56:40,893 --> 01:56:43,521
This fellow is..Fellow in a
family life should act a bit

1110
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:44,391
ls it so?
Yeah

1111
01:56:44,564 --> 01:56:46,725
Then after reaching on
top will there be a award night?

1112
01:56:46,866 --> 01:56:48,527
Best actor, best actress

1113
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:52,899
This thing called life, its not a
movie to act from the start to end

1114
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:55,769
To understand that, in a birth
should be born as a human being

1115
01:56:56,542 --> 01:56:58,305
Certain incarnations simply comes!

1116
01:56:59,045 --> 01:57:02,310
My goodness, even if he
dies he won't be good!

1117
01:57:03,016 --> 01:57:06,679
Thought all should come but at the
bank someone should be there, no?

1118
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,847
By the way mother and
sister hadn't they come?

1119
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,389
Were here just now only left
Will come tomorrow

1120
01:57:18,364 --> 01:57:21,822
Alice shall l leave? When husband
is free will come along with him

1121
01:57:29,609 --> 01:57:34,308
Okay then Alice
Call, if you need anything

1122
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:46,755
Did you see?

1123
01:57:51,798 --> 01:57:53,789
Come fast
Come, come

1124
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:55,828
Careful!

1125
01:57:56,469 --> 01:57:57,959
Okay go, go

1126
01:58:00,473 --> 01:58:01,633
One minute

1127
01:58:12,385 --> 01:58:16,412
Alice, l'm Nandhu
Along with James

1128
01:58:17,056 --> 01:58:18,648
Yeah, l know

1129
01:58:24,964 --> 01:58:27,797
James had a small world

1130
01:58:28,167 --> 01:58:32,126
A world of his own where
there was Alice and daughter

1131
01:58:32,538 --> 01:58:34,472
ln the column of surname

1132
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,040
Forced to write the
name of orphanage

1133
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:38,973
A person's insecurities

1134
01:58:40,012 --> 01:58:42,071
A major portion of life

1135
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:46,145
Without having anyone as own
had to live on, complexes of that

1136
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:51,151
From his life, it was you
Alice who expunged all that

1137
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,986
You and your love

1138
01:58:58,097 --> 01:59:02,500
James loved a lot,
Alice and daughter

1139
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:07,834
Your separation was
his biggest failure

1140
01:59:16,115 --> 01:59:19,050
Knowingly James has
never hurt you Alice

1141
01:59:24,924 --> 02:00:24,975
Team DrC

1142
02:00:29,855 --> 02:00:34,656
Several lives wriggling in
hardships,problems, grief

1143
02:00:36,095 --> 02:00:38,188
When watching aloof from here

1144
02:00:46,138 --> 02:00:48,663
James this beauty is permanent

1145
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:54,644
All though everyone sees
it many doesn't realise that

1146
02:00:56,015 --> 02:00:56,913
Like you

1147
02:00:58,784 --> 02:01:03,153
Your Alice, your life, the marriage
which suffocated you -

1148
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:05,018
- had the same beauty

1149
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:14,223
l knew that God may not
be a ''male chauvinist''

1150
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:19,234
But this ''feminist voice'' talking
on her behalf for everything

1151
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:21,763
l never expected that

1152
02:01:28,147 --> 02:01:31,014
But on what you said,
there are two mistakes

1153
02:01:31,684 --> 02:01:33,845
One is God
That is not me

1154
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:37,984
Two, today if l'm
talking on behalf of Alice

1155
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:41,582
Like this l'll talk to her on your
behalf, an auditing day-

1156
02:01:41,727 --> 02:01:42,819
-she'll also have

1157
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:44,819
But still at that time also

1158
02:01:44,997 --> 02:01:45,964
ln your life-

1159
02:01:46,065 --> 02:01:48,659
-degree of obstinacy shown by you
she has never shown that much

1160
02:01:48,768 --> 02:01:51,100
That truth, l can't forget it

1161
02:01:54,206 --> 02:01:58,142
Do you remember?. That day when
an entire family was waiting for you

1162
02:01:59,378 --> 02:02:02,279
Not as a son in law but as a son-

1163
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:04,315
- that person had
expected you, on that day

1164
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:16,288
What is daughter's name?
Pinky

1165
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:22,863
My name at the school is
lzabell Soosan James

1166
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:27,264
Dr. Alex is it? -Yeah
Hi, l'm James

1167
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:30,902
Will go and see grandpa?

1168
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:47,757
Come, come
Look who has come

1169
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:49,690
Grandpa's daughter is beautiful

1170
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:53,060
Yeah come
My goodness no need sir may sit

1171
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:55,099
Never mind, you may sit

1172
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:59,962
Son, do you have any ill-feeling on
me? -Sir, what are you saying?

1173
02:03:00,139 --> 02:03:03,438
Honestly, we were
waiting for a call from here

1174
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:04,698
lsn't it Alice?

1175
02:03:06,145 --> 02:03:10,980
So, that's it! All these years she
was too stern to come here

1176
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:13,675
And finally when she was
brought, look she is crying

1177
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:18,981
You come here,
come, come on dear

1178
02:03:22,128 --> 02:03:23,186
Daughter you sit

1179
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:27,256
How you were during childhood,
your daughter looks the same

1180
02:03:28,267 --> 02:03:30,667
There is no change isn't it Soosan?
True

1181
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,397
l was also saying the
same to daughter

1182
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:35,901
So, when the family
members united, l'm out

1183
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:37,075
Okay carry on
No James, l didn't say..

1184
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:38,471
My goodness, James don't
include me in this group

1185
02:03:38,778 --> 02:03:39,972
l'm also an outside person

1186
02:03:40,179 --> 02:03:42,170
Yeah, l know aren't
you beloved son for him?

1187
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:45,408
Honestly l doubt Davis sir was
enticed by giving medicine

1188
02:03:46,318 --> 02:03:49,378
My Mercy did you check Alex
doctor's degree is fake or not?

1189
02:03:49,789 --> 02:03:52,417
My dear don't nail me, let me live

1190
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:54,888
My God, what is it
Echaya?(husband)

1191
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,461
No nothing it has been few years
since laughed with peace of mind

1192
02:03:58,798 --> 02:04:00,925
l never expected that
James will come

1193
02:04:02,201 --> 02:04:03,691
By saddening my daughter-

1194
02:04:03,836 --> 02:04:04,825
- and without seeing face
of my grand daughter

1195
02:04:04,937 --> 02:04:06,268
l thought l would go like that

1196
02:04:06,372 --> 02:04:08,465
Sir, that is all old chapters, isn't it?
Truly, even at that time

1197
02:04:08,808 --> 02:04:10,708
l didn't have any
ill-feel towards sir

1198
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:12,207
On the contrary l had only respect

1199
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:13,811
With her birth only l realised -

1200
02:04:13,979 --> 02:04:16,345
- what's the mind of a
female child's father

1201
02:04:16,482 --> 02:04:19,781
Sir, reacted like that only, if l were
the one could have whacked

1202
02:04:20,853 --> 02:04:22,514
Son, we are so happy

1203
02:04:23,122 --> 02:04:26,114
Soosan l want to
celebrate with your son in laws

1204
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:27,156
No, that is..

1205
02:04:27,326 --> 02:04:29,487
Why doctor won't you give
permission to drink two pegs?

1206
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:32,094
Will give the permission
but should stop with two

1207
02:04:32,198 --> 02:04:35,497
Okay agreed, what is the
opinion of elder son in law?

1208
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:37,166
l don't have any dissension
at all sir, on the contrary-

1209
02:04:37,269 --> 02:04:38,736
- if you don't drink only
then l'll have dissension

1210
02:04:39,071 --> 02:04:41,335
Should change this
calling sir and call father

1211
02:04:41,507 --> 02:04:43,873
My god, sorry
So father

1212
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:45,201
When to start?

1213
02:04:51,016 --> 02:04:54,008
Father, to tell the truth on knowing
there is a set up like this, here

1214
02:04:54,186 --> 02:04:56,746
This journey to here with her, it
wouldn't have delayed for 8 years

1215
02:04:57,389 --> 02:04:59,949
What is it from now on you can
come here whenever you like

1216
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:00,990
Okay that's done

1217
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:02,526
Can come any time you like
but it shouldn't be a task for me

1218
02:05:02,795 --> 02:05:04,558
Then what? On drinking two
pegs will we just die like that?

1219
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,956
Then what?
Now did you understand?

1220
02:05:06,098 --> 02:05:07,463
Usefulness of at least one son
in law who has gone weird

1221
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,563
Even after drinking
6 pegs will sit like this

1222
02:06:17,036 --> 02:06:19,937
On realising the mistake by
oneself, was ready to say sorry

1223
02:06:20,139 --> 02:06:21,970
From the perspective of that dad

1224
02:06:22,141 --> 02:06:24,302
lf you could have
thought for a second

1225
02:06:24,476 --> 02:06:27,240
One who disdained own house,
own family, to live along with you

1226
02:06:27,346 --> 02:06:29,371
Forthe sake of Alice
forthat one day-

1227
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:31,108
- if you had postponed of your ego

1228
02:06:31,216 --> 02:06:35,983
Before death to gift an evening like
this to Davis, you could do it

1229
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:47,960
Out of the thousand
mistakes committed

1230
02:06:48,634 --> 02:06:52,297
This memory would be enough
forAlice to pardon you

1231
02:06:59,645 --> 02:07:02,113
That can be never
corrected and written

1232
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:06,149
A big erratum in the life of James

1233
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:14,276
Madam!
Madam

1234
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:17,316
Mohan doctor is calling

1235
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:23,256
Alice has legally moved
for divorce, no?

1236
02:08:24,063 --> 02:08:29,660
Not only that she is an educated girl
no? l don't think this will be a shock

1237
02:08:31,403 --> 02:08:35,703
Don't know doctor, all though
l've slightly detailed all this

1238
02:08:36,275 --> 02:08:38,072
Nothing is told clearly

1239
02:08:38,644 --> 02:08:43,104
On this topic, l can't
talk just like a doctor

1240
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:48,577
Yeah Alice come in

1241
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:57,422
Look Alice things are not happening
in a way what we wished

1242
02:08:57,629 --> 02:08:59,790
Not only that for James

1243
02:09:00,165 --> 02:09:03,362
Nothing at all as a sign of
returning back to life

1244
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:05,696
Since all these days
nothing has taken place

1245
02:09:08,107 --> 02:09:14,012
Alice, only because of life supporting
system attached to the body

1246
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:16,181
Today life remains within James

1247
02:09:37,836 --> 02:09:39,633
That is the reason why
you were called by me

1248
02:09:40,539 --> 02:09:43,633
None of us knows what is
the pain he undergoes now-

1249
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:46,176
- or his present mental condition

1250
02:09:46,879 --> 02:09:50,508
For us, the only help
we can do to James is

1251
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:53,381
That is to remove the ventilator

1252
02:10:02,361 --> 02:10:07,321
To take such a decision over
James now Alice only has the rights

1253
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:12,564
Because still now Alice
is the wife of James

1254
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,243
Not saying should
do it immediately

1255
02:10:28,353 --> 02:11:12,293
Team DrC

1256
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:13,617
Father, tea is here

1257
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:17,225
Daughter can't you talk?

1258
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:33,302
Here, tea

1259
02:12:36,815 --> 02:12:38,214
Come on drink it girl

1260
02:12:49,328 --> 02:12:50,693
Did you see that one?

1261
02:12:54,366 --> 02:12:57,733
Still now that smiling face is
not vanished from the mind

1262
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:00,529
When son was one and a
half years old-

1263
02:13:00,672 --> 02:13:02,037
-came to native on leave and left

1264
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:06,709
Country has got soldier
who adorned a brave death

1265
02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:08,707
What is lost is for me, no?

1266
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:22,759
Alice, certain truths
we should accept

1267
02:13:26,431 --> 02:13:30,834
My consciousness says
what Alex says is true

1268
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:40,043
l must go home
What?

1269
02:13:44,116 --> 02:13:45,606
l must go home

1270
02:14:20,786 --> 02:14:21,753
Yeah, come

1271
02:14:32,697 --> 02:14:35,825
Sorry Alice due to busy schedule
couldn't come to hospital

1272
02:14:36,034 --> 02:14:37,126
How is he?

1273
02:15:08,867 --> 02:15:10,164
Papa!

1274
02:15:11,169 --> 02:15:14,502
Where have you kept the crayons?

1275
02:15:19,811 --> 02:15:21,642
We'll find it, okay

1282

..To return back''

1283
02:17:46,891 --> 02:17:49,155
''Which could have never
happened..Where is he?''

1284
02:17:49,361 --> 02:17:56,665
''Vanishing memories
could you come near?.''

1285
02:18:56,394 --> 02:18:58,692
There was a debt to repay

1286
02:19:00,031 --> 02:19:01,794
To call, father!

1287
02:19:03,868 --> 02:19:06,029
l know it'll remain as a debt

1288
02:19:06,204 --> 02:19:09,867
But still, after coming here and
calling like that wholeheartedly

1289
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:13,702
Don't know, a sort of relief!

1290
02:19:15,647 --> 02:19:19,014
James, there is no one who departs
without leaving behind a debt

1291
02:19:19,317 --> 02:19:22,286
lf it were there, it would have
been meaning less-

1292
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:24,081
- on this account tallying and for me

1293
02:19:24,289 --> 02:19:27,053
But there is a debt pending
which you can repay

1294
02:19:42,073 --> 02:19:45,702
Mother, today l'm
going to wear this dress

1295
02:19:45,877 --> 02:19:47,708
Papa's birthday gift

1296
02:19:59,391 --> 02:20:04,090
Tomorrow on wards we
may have to live without Papa

1297
02:20:05,663 --> 02:20:40,854
Team DrC

1298
02:20:43,268 --> 02:20:46,203
Daughter, get down will pray
and go - Let me complete this

1299
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:48,771
l've promised to Papa

1300
02:20:56,247 --> 02:20:57,714
Mother will come now

1301
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:15,591
Do you know Alice?
For this day

1302
02:22:16,094 --> 02:22:20,053
ln front of this alter,
how much l've prayed

1303
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:22,423
Honestly!

1304
02:22:23,201 --> 02:22:24,600
Above these candles

1305
02:22:25,036 --> 02:22:27,061
By stretching the hands
and praying by closing the eyes

1306
02:22:27,238 --> 02:22:31,299
Through out, it was this
moment in my mind

1307
02:22:36,281 --> 02:22:38,875
So, won't your hand get burned?
No

1308
02:22:39,584 --> 02:22:42,075
lts an age old belief in this church

1309
02:22:42,287 --> 02:22:44,278
By stretching the hands
above these candles

1310
02:22:44,389 --> 02:22:48,416
And if anything is prayed
sincerely by closing the eyes

1311
02:22:49,027 --> 02:22:53,930
And if you really, really want it,
the hand won't get burned!

1312
02:23:35,406 --> 02:23:39,467
Hey donkey! Other than you will
anyone believe this stupidity?

1313
02:23:39,644 --> 02:23:42,306
On placing the hand above the
flame, won't it get burned, girl?

1314
02:23:43,047 --> 02:23:45,481
Hey you!
No! -Stop there!

1315
02:23:45,583 --> 02:23:46,982
Stop there, l say!

1316
02:24:33,398 --> 02:24:36,231
James, prayer is her hope

1317
02:24:37,068 --> 02:24:39,696
A repentance for hurting you-

1318
02:24:40,004 --> 02:24:41,665
- and for separating from you
knowingly or unknowingly

1319
02:24:42,674 --> 02:24:45,507
To realise the extent of
love towards you

1320
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:48,670
Her last hope whether
you can be gained back

1321
02:24:52,016 --> 02:24:54,382
James, she had loved you a lot

1322
02:24:54,752 --> 02:24:58,244
ln this world, more than
anyone else

1323
02:24:58,623 --> 02:25:01,285
More than anything else
she had loved you

1324
02:25:11,302 --> 02:25:15,238
Today she very well knows will get
burned if hand is placed overflame

1325
02:25:15,606 --> 02:25:16,664
But still..

1326
02:26:58,910 --> 02:26:59,842
James!

1327
02:27:01,712 --> 02:27:03,202
Perhaps if looked back-

1328
02:27:03,381 --> 02:27:06,350
- there are yet more mistakes in your
life that could have been corrected

1329
02:27:06,517 --> 02:27:07,506
A lot!

1330
02:27:08,286 --> 02:27:12,689
But..Your auditing comes
to an end, over here

1331
02:27:41,953 --> 02:27:42,715
