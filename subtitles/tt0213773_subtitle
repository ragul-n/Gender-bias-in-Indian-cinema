1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,042
"Father, is Mumbai
a very big city?"

3
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,792
"Yes, my son.
It's a very big city"

4
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,625
So how will we see all of it
in just four days?

5
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,875
"We will, my son.
I'll take you around the city"

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,583
I want to see the sea and also
have a photograph taken on the beach

7
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,000
"Sure, son. We'll have
your photo taken"

8
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,125
I also want to be photographed
with Amitabh Bachchan

9
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,334
"All right, son.
That will be done too. Okay?"

10
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:57,084
Your son is very talkative.
And I must say...

11
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:02,334
you sure are a very patient man.
You're answering every question of his

12
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,334
Looks like he's your only son

13
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,334
"Actually, he's my brother's son"

14
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,792
My brother and sister-in-law
are no more

15
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,375
So the two of us are bringing him up

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,375
We're taking him on a tour of Mumbai.
- Wow!

17
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,750
"Unless you said it, no one could ever
have guessed that he's not your son"

18
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,375
You sure love him very much.
As if he were your own son

19
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,416
Uncle...?

20
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,416
Aunt...?

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,875
"Goli, have you seen
the movie "Deewar"?"

22
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,458
"Yes, and guess which line
I liked the best?"

23
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,750
"I still don't pick up
fallen money"

24
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,625
I loved that line Amitabh
Bachchan delivers...

25
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,708
You must be very happy today

26
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,833
"Let's go and see that movie again.
- Oh yes, let's do that"

27
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,708
Who are you...?
Why're you crying?

28
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,084
My uncle and aunt
have lost their way

29
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,500
"Not your uncle and aunt,
you've lost your way in this city"

30
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,917
I'm terribly hungry. I haven't had
anything to eat since yesterday

31
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:46,291
You get nothing by asking.
You got to snatch it. You get that...?

32
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,542
Goli! Get him!
Don't let him escape!

33
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:36,375
The Paschim Express has arrived
at platform number four

34
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,583
You are requested to look
after your luggage

35
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:49,208
"In case of any suspicious activity,
contact the police immediately"

36
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,208
I'll be there in about an hour.
Tell Patel...

37
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,625
Thief! Thief!

38
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,667
Thief!

39
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,500
Who are you?

40
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,041
"Where did you pick him up?
- Near the Navrang Cinema, sir"

41
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:12,625
Stand up!

42
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,083
Pick that up and get going

43
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:36,709
"Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me"

44
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,333
"I was a soldier, I lost my eye-sight
in the service of the country..."

45
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:46,750
and I'm forced to beg. Please
give me whatever you can...

46
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,542
What are you doing...?
You're robbing a beggar?

47
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,542
Look! He's robbing a beggar!

48
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,750
Where have we stolen it?
We've only collected our fee

49
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,417
"You were blind earlier.
But you can see now, right?"

50
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,083
So then...?
Sit down there. Go on

51
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
Strange guys!
They rob a beggar!

52
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,750
The worms will get you!
Just you see!

53
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,125
What is your name?
- Tony

54
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,542
Your father's name?
- Pony

55
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:19,083
"I want a straight answer, okay?
- It is a straight answer"

56
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,750
You call me to the police station so
often and ask me the same questions

57
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,041
"My name, my father's name..."

58
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,458
my father died when I was
still a child

59
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,792
"I don't even remember how he looked,
so how will I remember his name?"

60
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,667
"You do believe in God, do you?"

61
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,792
He's the one who did me the favour
of sending me into this world

62
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,125
I have so many questions to ask Him.
- Where were you at eight last night?

63
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:54,166
"Last night, I...
- Hurry up and recall it"

64
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,792
Speak up.
- I do remember

65
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,834
But this is a police station. One has
to be careful about what one says

66
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:09,166
"And last night, I... yes!
I was at my aunt's in Colaba"

67
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,000
I go to her place for food
once in a while

68
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,834
She makes excellent fish.
You can call her over...

69
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,166
she could come here too.
As well as to the court

70
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,834
He's lying!
- So all right. I'm lying

71
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,875
Because there's no point in telling
you the truth right in the beginning

72
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,834
"Because you think whatever is
told to you first, is a lie"

73
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:35,208
But I will speak the truth now.
So what's the question?

74
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,875
You snatched a bag from a jeweller
at Zaveri Bazar last night

75
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,458
It contained some cash
and jewellery

76
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,542
"Where is it?
- Amazing story, sir"

77
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,875
Why're you pinning someone
else's crime on me?

78
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,041
I've given up all this

79
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,667
Nowadays I'm working as an apprentice
at an automobile garage

80
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:57,208
Hey sir... no raising your hand.
No violence

81
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,542
"I told you, I haven't done it.
So that's it"

82
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,208
Do you have a witness who can say
that I was the one who stole the bag?

83
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,417
No

84
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,375
"If you beat me up now,
I'll own up"

85
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,625
But I'll reverse my stand in court.
And I'll tell the judge...

86
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,292
that I owned up because
you guys tortured me

87
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,875
What good is that to you and me?

88
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,875
May I go now?

89
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,500
"Let's go, Goli.
- Everything okay, Tony?"

90
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,542
Munna told me the cops had
picked you up. But what for?

91
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,333
They wanted to kill time.
- Damn it!

92
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,916
"I told you about Mr Patil, remember?"

93
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,250
"I've taken an appointment,
we've got to meet him"

94
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:45,916
He keeps needing guys like us.
- When are we meeting him?

95
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,916
I've heard so much about you.
You've made life miserable for the cops

96
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,125
I've heard things
about you too

97
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:58,916
Goli's been pestering me that
I must meet up with Mr Patil

98
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,584
"So I said, "Let's meet him today"
"- Right!"

99
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,916
"How about talking business, Mr Patil.
- Oh yes..."

100
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,375
that's what I've called you here for.
Not for a chat surely

101
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
"You see, some guys are
fond of driving cars"

102
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,542
"For that, they raise
loans from the banks"

103
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,958
But they forget to repay the loan

104
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,625
I've got five such cases presently.
You've got to pay them a visit...

105
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,625
collect the money and bring it here.
If they don't pay up...

106
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,958
bring the car-keys. I'll pay you
2000 rupees for every car you bring

107
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,292
Does the bank intend to sell
the cars in scrap?

108
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,083
"Scrap? What do you mean?
- The metal, the engine, the tyres"

109
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:43,667
This guy talks any nonsense!

110
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:49,000
"Mr Patil, I know what price
the cars fetch in the market"

111
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,667
All right.
- I'll charge 10000 for every car

112
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,667
Now look. I've got boys
to do the job for me

113
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,667
But I called you here because
Chandu-bhai said you're a nice guy...

114
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,584
Chandu-bhai is wrong!
I'm not a nice guy

115
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,000
Let me know if you can
take up my offer

116
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,791
"Else, I'm leaving.
- Hold on... why're you in a hurry?"

117
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,500
I'll pay you what you're asking for

118
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,791
This file has the names and
addresses of all the debtors

119
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,000
"Hey Goli, take good care of this one.
Bring the car-keys to me..."

120
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,708
and collect your share of money.
Every time

121
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,708
"Mr Patil, you shouldn't have taken up
his offer in the very first meeting"

122
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:35,042
Moron! The money's too little
for what he's doing

123
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,042
"Vikas Patil isn't called the
Smart Patil for nothing, okay?"

124
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,708
"Give me two days more, please.
I'll repay the car-Ioan"

125
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,375
Please listen to me...
don't take the car away

126
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,708
Haul it up... go on

127
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,083
I'm giving you a post-dated cheque!
Please don't take the car away

128
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,625
You can have the whole
cheque-book if you wish...

129
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,791
"What are you doing, mister?
- Who's going to pay the car-Ioan?"

130
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,791
If you wish to drive a car...

131
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,125
you got to pay up...

132
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,916
honour your commitments

133
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,167
"Enough, pull up at the side"

134
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:36,167
You stay here. Come inside if
we don't return in ten minutes

135
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,958
Stay here. I'll go
and check with Anna

136
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,875
"No, Anna... don't!"

137
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,083
I've been in the business
for twenty bleeding years

138
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:06,000
And it's always your accounts
that are crooked!

139
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,583
"Anna, there's a guy
from the bank out there"

140
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,708
"He says if you don't repay the loan,
he'll take the car away"

141
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,209
Really...? Bring him in. Go on

142
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,791
Well smart-ass? You've come
to collect for the bank?

143
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,209
"If I don't pay up,
you'll take the car away?"

144
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:42,250
All right. Pick up the key
if you have the courage

145
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,209
Goli! Pick up the key

146
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,084
Well smart-ass...?
You thought you could get away?

147
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,541
Move it

148
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,750
What you did was right too.
Shetty had come to be terribly arrogant

149
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,375
He needed to be given a dose.
And I've taken care of everything...

150
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,875
you will face no problems.
And he's not dead in any case!

151
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,708
"If he had to die so easily,
why'd he be a Shetty?"

152
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,375
Sit down here... c'mon.
And give me the keys

153
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,209
"One, two, three, four...?
Where's the fifth?"

154
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,000
Here's the fifth key

155
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,000
Give it to me.
- I'll collect 20 grand for this

156
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,958
You're talking about money! I've
saved you from serious trouble

157
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,042
"For your sake, I spoke to Shetty's
contacts, the cops..."

158
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,167
who haven't I spoken to?

159
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,042
Did I ask you to talk
to Shetty's contacts?

160
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,416
To talk to the cops?

161
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,416
No?

162
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,084
"Even if Shetty had died, it
wouldn't make any difference to me"

163
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:04,084
"I'm collecting 20 grand for this key.
20, okay?"

164
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,042
"I'll pay you 20 grand!
I'm paying you 20,000!"

165
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,416
Why create tension...?
Here's the money

166
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,209
"One, two, three... and four"

167
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,792
I'll let you know if there's another
job coming up. Take care

168
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,042
"Mr Patil, you shouldn't be giving him
so much of money"

169
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,084
It'll drive him out of his mind.
- Chandya...

170
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:39,125
he's already out of his mind. And crazy
guys like him are very useful to us

171
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,458
"I'm not called "Smart Patil"
"for nothing!"

172
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,875
"Here you are, Goli.
Distribute the money"

173
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,458
Wow! Smile across the face!

174
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,458
Here you are guys.
Make merry

175
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,042
Let me count it

176
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,458
"One, two, three, four..."

177
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,500
"What've you planned, Goli?
- I'm going to see Sapna perform"

178
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,291
I've got a ticket for you too.
So don't refuse me

179
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,042
I'm going to sleep at home.
- So you can sleep

180
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,500
"In the air-conditioned hall.
I'll watch the show, what say?"

181
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,500
All right

182
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,959
You think the price is high...?
You have no idea of Madam's price

183
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,084
I quoted a low price because you
said it's a charity show

184
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,500
"And I'm just her secretary,
I'm not her father to decide"

185
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,167
Look at the craze for Madam!
Look at the demand

186
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,500
Look at the queue. No singer has
been able to stand up to her

187
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,208
Because the magic she wields
goes to your head

188
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,375
And you're haggling over the price?
How is it possible?

189
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,208
"Hey mister, this is my seat.
- Let me see"

190
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,291
"Oh yes, it is.
But can't you see us resting?"

191
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,583
Go and sit elsewhere. Go on.
- Strange guy

192
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:49,917
What did you say...?
Come here

193
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,834
My crazed heart...

194
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,166
wouldn't heed any reason

195
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:30,042
"It was so difficult
to reason with it"

196
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,542
I had to go and see my beloved

197
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,084
My crazed heart...

198
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,583
wouldn't heed any reason

199
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:04,084
Chham-chhama chham...

200
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:08,917
my anklets had to chime

201
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,583
I had to go and see my beloved

202
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,667
"Modesty holds me back,
and love draws me out..."

203
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,333
I now walk...

204
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,667
with my eyes closed

205
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,166
I have loved...

206
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,500
"so what have I to be
shy about?"

207
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,375
"At last, I had to take
the veil off my face"

208
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:32,041
I had to go and see my beloved

209
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,375
"My Lord is angry with me.
He won't be placated"

210
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:11,375
"I have set out
to bring my love around"

211
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:21,250
"It's so difficult for me
to return..."

212
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,208
"I had to bow my head
in reverence"

213
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,750
I had to go and see my beloved

214
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,417
"My crazed heart
wouldn't heed any reason"

215
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,750
"It was so difficult
to reason with it"

216
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,625
Chham-chhama chham...

217
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:45,417
my anklets had to chime

218
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:50,583
I had to go and see my beloved

219
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,125
Out of the way...
please clear out

220
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,792
Get in

221
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:20,458
Step back... back off!

222
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:25,458
Why're you pushing everyone?
Why?

223
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,208
They're only asking madam
for an autograph

224
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,458
She's what she is because of them!
You get that...?

225
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
I am giving the autographs.
Who wants one now?

226
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:36,542
"Me, me!"

227
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,208
Don't be hasty

228
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,250
"If you keep signing autographs here,
the recording will get cancelled!"

229
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,667
Burnt me! Burnt me!

230
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,292
Don't set me on fire... don't!
I'm still alive!

231
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:16,875
What happened?

232
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,667
How did I get a burn?

233
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,875
Was it the cigarette?

234
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,542
I had a dream. That you're
lighting my funeral pyre

235
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,542
Why do I always have such dreams
about you?

236
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,500
"At times, I dream of you
throwing me in a well..."

237
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,208
then there's the dream of you
chasing me with a revolver...

238
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:45,542
of throwing me before
a railway engine

239
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,208
Are you a friend
or are you an enemy?

240
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,709
Tell me.
- Go to sleep

241
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,625
Go to sleep!

242
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,916
Why're you smoking so much
at this hour of the night?

243
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:10,625
"I see, I see!"

244
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,709
Looks like you've been
dreaming of Sapna

245
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,584
"You know, it's all about
what you are"

246
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:28,292
Man must even dream according
to what he is in life

247
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,916
She's far beyond your reach

248
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,375
She sings and dances out of
her love for the arts

249
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,709
"She's a big man's daughter,
you know?"

250
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,542
What do you mean by big...?
Am I a small man?

251
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,916
I've made so much in this city too!

252
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,916
You see the stuff here...?
It all belongs to me

253
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:53,542
Wow! You've made so much!

254
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,208
Every police station has
your photo in their rogues gallery

255
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,417
They're so respectful to you

256
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,625
"Now listen, stop using your brains
on the wrong things, my friend..."

257
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,667
and go to sleep.
- You go to sleep!

258
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,750
You!

259
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,958
"Go to sleep, because your
destiny has gone to sleep"

260
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,625
And I'm going to keep awake.
Because my destiny has awakened

261
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,791
Get back... get back...

262
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,000
What sort of production is this?
The crowds are harassing us!

263
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,375
Drive them away!
Madam will be angry

264
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:35,000
Please get back and let us
get on with our shoot

265
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,584
"Natu, you will charge
the zoom from here and..."

266
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:40,791
there's so much of a problem here!

267
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,000
Tell the lady the shot is ready.
Go and call her

268
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,584
What shot is ready?
Clear the crowd first!

269
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,375
The heroine's not to be seen

270
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,708
"Please move back, our shot is held up.
The lady will go back home"

271
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,000
But I have moved back.
How much more will I go?

272
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,791
Back off!

273
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,292
Back off!

274
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,000
So? Where do you want
these guys to go?

275
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:09,375
Back there... go!

276
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:16,000
"Get back there, I said!
Behind that car"

277
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,042
Get back!

278
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:23,042
"Till now, it's a song being shot.
Soon it'll be action, you dig?"

279
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,042
Get back! Go!

280
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,625
What are you doing there?
Come here

281
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,042
Get back!

282
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,875
"You were amazing! In just a slap,
you cleared out the whole field!"

283
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,083
You see Sapna Madam there...?

284
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm her secretary. Pankaj-bhai

285
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,708
Tony-bhai! What a pleasure
to meet you! I'm delighted!

286
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,375
Will you have something to drink?
Please sit down

287
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,083
Hey feller... get a chair!
Where are you?

288
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,375
Hurry

289
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,708
"Sit down, Tony-bhai"

290
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,083
My name is Goli (bullet).
- And I was scared

291
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,417
Hey feller... get another chair

292
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,083
"Now look at this,
boys and girls"

293
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,875
"With the whole of your body,
you go on-two..."

294
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,417
Like this?
- Use the whole body. One-two...

295
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,875
"He just can't get it right.
- Raju, what are you doing? What?"

296
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,750
"Move your feet...
Santosh, show him the step"

297
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,791
"Look, it's so simple.
- Like this?"

298
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,542
You got two left feet...?
Move your feet! Go on!

299
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,125
Show him again!
- Like this... and like this

300
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:48,459
He's just not being able to do it.
- Really? Can you do it?

301
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,208
Of course

302
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:55,250
"Don't laugh. Want me to show you?
- No, forget it"

303
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,334
Whatever for...? Sit here

304
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,459
"Listen, Tony... don't..."

305
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,292
"Mister, can I perform it?"

306
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,708
"It's not about flexing muscles, okay?
It's a dance. Have you been trained?"

307
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,125
No.
- So how will you do it?

308
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,958
I wasn't trained in
muscle-flexing either

309
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,542
"Master, why don't you try him out
if he's so confident?"

310
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,666
This fair maiden...

311
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,167
has stolen my heart

312
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:11,209
"Morning or night,
or a bright afternoon..."

313
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:15,541
"she says she prays
for my well-being"

314
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,708
This handsome boy...

315
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,042
Iooks like a thug

316
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:28,209
"Morning or night,
or a bright afternoon..."

317
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,541
"he says he prays
for my well-being"

318
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,209
This fair maiden...

319
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:21,500
"I really do think
you are a fortunate girl..."

320
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:25,875
"for the line on my palm says
you are the one who'll be mine"

321
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:29,875
"At what you say,
with my hand in yours..."

322
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,958
"you sure have sent
my heart pounding"

323
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:38,292
"In every lane...
- There's a hue and cry"

324
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:42,625
You are the fair maiden...

325
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,708
"Morning or night,
or a bright afternoon..."

326
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:50,958
"he says he prays
for my well-being"

327
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,625
You are the fair maiden

328
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:39,958
"It isn't a good thing to
tease me every day..."

329
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:44,042
"to appear in my dreams
all through the nights"

330
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,625
"By God, that's my state too"

331
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:52,792
"All day and night, you are
the only one I think about"

332
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,167
The whole world...

333
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,167
appears to be round

334
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:01,084
You are the handsome lad

335
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,375
"Morning or night,
or a bright afternoon..."

336
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:09,750
"she says she prays
for my well-being"

337
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,917
You are the fair maiden

338
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:18,250
You are the handsome lad

339
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:22,375
"Morning or night,
or a bright afternoon..."

340
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:26,750
"he says he prays
for my well-being"

341
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,708
"That was excellent, madam.
- Thank you, master"

342
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:39,416
I've composed the other song too.
Please attend the rehearsal tomorrow

343
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,416
We can decide about
the shoot there

344
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,000
"Well, well...?"

345
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,416
She gives you a finger and
you grab the whole hand?

346
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,750
What do you mean?
- What do I mean!

347
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,750
"You were running your
hand over her, what?"

348
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,250
Your hands just wouldn't
leave her cheeks

349
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,708
"Oh, get lost!"

350
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:07,625
That...

351
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,458
Tony-bhai! We forgot

352
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,250
You dance very nicely

353
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,458
Great dance!

354
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,125
"It's all over, okay?
Now get her out of your mind"

355
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,500
"You two just aren't equals,
let me tell you"

356
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:49,833
I want to be an equal in love.
No matter what I have to do

357
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,500
When does Arvind-bhai's
gambling money go out?

358
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,917
On Friday

359
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,291
What's today?
- Friday

360
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:14,500
There's a car coming this way.
- Relax. Nothing will happen

361
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,167
He's going to ram into us!

362
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,542
That's all?

363
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,333
Everything is perfect.
What say?

364
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:17,208
"Well buddy, the money is being
put to good use, isn't it?"

365
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:18,875
Perfect use

366
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,667
Damn

367
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:54,250
"If you want to be my lover,
take me away with you"

368
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,291
"My love, put a ring on my finger"

369
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,375
The lady is in demand

370
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,750
She cancelled a confirmed recording
just to record for you

371
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,750
But you're still the same old scrooge.
- I'll raise the packet a bit

372
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,375
I want the figure I told you.
Confirm it with Mr Bhakti

373
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,208
"Tony bhai!
Move it, man"

374
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,417
What brings you here?

375
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:19,625
"I get it. Glamour has
enamoured you too, right?"

376
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,250
Are you recording a song?
- Well... yes

377
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,291
Who is the music director?

378
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,417
Myself

379
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:32,291
"You must. If you have a duet
in the album, tell me"

380
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,625
I'll get the lady to sing

381
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,667
"Well, if you have finalised someone,
no problem. Madam is too busy anyway"

382
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,667
"Oh no, Pankaj bhai.
This particular song is different"

383
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,333
"Only Ms Sapna can sing it,
no one else"

384
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,750
Thank you

385
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:55,667
"I must leave. Call me up,
I'll get your work done"

386
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,083
"Hurry up, feller"

387
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,000
Don't forget to call!

388
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:09,959
"This way, madam"

389
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,667
"Your pendant, sir"

390
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,875
I think I must talk to him today

391
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,875
Are you a regular here?
- To be honest...

392
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,375
this is the first time.
I came here only to see you

393
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:17,041
"Actually, I've fallen in love with you
and I want to marry you"

394
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:19,083
What do you think?

395
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,750
I got this made for you

396
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,417
I'm all alone

397
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,542
"If you want me to meet someone
from your family, I'm game"

398
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:43,750
Come on

399
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,792
Am I dressed properly?
- Perfect. Shall we?

400
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,958
"Well, it's all set for me"

401
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,792
Hats off to You!
You are really there

402
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,792
You run the world

403
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:07,292
"Now that You have done so much for me,
let me take over from You now"

404
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,333
No more shady businesses

405
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:14,000
My life is all set

406
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,500
The bus will be here any moment.
What will you have during the break?

407
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,500
I have packed some wafers.
Don't misbehave in class

408
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,625
"Concentrate on your studies, okay?"

409
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,083
The bus is here. Come on

410
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,834
Hang on

411
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,208
Shall we...?
- Come on

412
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,041
You forgot his tiffin?

413
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,834
You always forgot
to give him his tiffin

414
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,417
He's going to starve the whole day

415
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,542
You'd better have it. Take it

416
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,375
You'd better eat it now

417
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,000
What tiffin?

418
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,000
Nothing

419
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:20,208
"Look Tony, you are wise, no doubt"

420
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:24,542
Golden opportunities rarely knock.
Don't goof up

421
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:27,709
"Oh no, I'll drop everything.
No more fracas, honestly"

422
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,417
What?

423
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,292
"Nothing, really"

424
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,000
Come

425
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:48,500
This way

426
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:07,625
It's Sapna!
Come on in

427
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,000
"Would you study the report later, sir?
- Prepare the file, I'll be there"

428
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,500
"What a surprise.
- Doctor, this is Tony"

429
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,916
"And Tony, this is doctor Ajay Saxena"

430
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:19,916
Greetings.
- Greetings

431
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:22,667
"Sapna, I have an urgent report
to prepare"

432
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,625
"Be comfortable, I'll be back soon"

433
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:34,750
"Know who this doctor is, Tony?"

434
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:38,958
My fiance

435
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,208
I'm going to marry him. We've known
each other since childhood

436
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,000
"Get up, Tony"

437
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:30,542
Listen to me... get up

438
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,708
"Does it look good, Tony?
You have caused a traffic jam..."

439
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,375
and the people are stressed out.
You are dead drunk

440
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,542
"Damn, I'm ashamed"

441
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,750
"My friend, come here... come to me"

442
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,167
Come here.
- What the...?

443
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,208
Tell me... what's my mistake?

444
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:58,208
Did I abuse them? Did I?
- No... not at all

445
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,042
Did I hit someone?
- Listen...

446
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,375
listen to me.
- I didn't hit anyone

447
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,459
Listen to me...
- I didn't hit anyone

448
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,208
Listen to me. You are right now
lying on the road...

449
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:12,042
and this traffic snarl is because
of you. So don't ask me your mistake

450
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,791
"Come on, get up.
Everyone is honking away"

451
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,708
"Why are they honking?
- Listen, Tony..."

452
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,208
I'm marrying this pretty lady

453
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,459
Why are you honking? You should be
playing the wedding music

454
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,958
"Let's go.
- Come on, dance"

455
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:34,208
"All right, I'll dance.
Here you are"

456
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:35,916
Watch it

457
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:38,500
"Watch it, watch it"

458
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,042
Bloody drunkards!

459
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,584
"I'm a reveller, I make merry"

460
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:25,125
"I'm the King of Hearts,
yet Ionely in my kingdom"

461
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,666
"Get off my back, O Love!
You are dubious"

462
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:32,916
"Whoever knows when you
will show your true colours"

463
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:37,125
"Cast a glance at me, too...
sweetheart, love me"

464
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,292
"I have given you my heart,
trust me"

465
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,958
Tony...

466
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,500
this reminds me of a couplet.
My own creation

467
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,750
Wanna hear?
- Let's hear

468
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,167
Hear

469
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,334
"Those eyes have said something
for sure"

470
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:17,583
"Do not blame me
if I'm carried away"

471
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:21,541
"Wonderful!
- Goli, don't try to con me"

472
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,375
What?
- You took that out of a movie

473
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,541
Hear an original couplet from me.
- Shoot

474
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:36,625
"You act so vain
because you are drunk"

475
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:43,209
"Look at me! I'm not drunk,
yet I'm intoxicated"

476
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:45,875
I could die for it!

477
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,042
Am I drunk on your eyes...?

478
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:08,625
Or is it the booze?

479
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:13,167
Why do I have a feeling...

480
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,500
"that you love me madly, too?"

481
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:21,167
Let me confess tonight

482
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:25,209
"I've been pining for you,
but I never found you"

483
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:37,500
"I'm a reveller, I make merry"

484
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:41,250
"I'm King of Hearts,
yet Ionely in my kingdom"

485
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,083
"Here's a fresh couplet, Tony.
It's about booze"

486
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,583
Let's hear.
- My creation

487
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:18,458
"I barely visit the bar,
and I hardly drink"

488
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:25,917
"But when tresses create magic,
I drink hard even off season"

489
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:29,625
"Applause!
- Goli, you are conning me again"

490
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,292
What?
- It's Pankaj Udhas' ghazal

491
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:37,958
"Man, you catch me every time.
- Hear mine. Absolutely original"

492
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,292
All right

493
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:42,666
They visit Aunty's bar

494
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,084
"Yet, why do they drink less?"

495
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:48,334
"Amazing.
- "They are not real drunkards..."

496
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,084
who count every swill

497
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,708
Amazing! Hats off to you

498
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,167
I can't live without you

499
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:16,500
"It's true, believe me"

500
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:21,167
"I'm helpless, believe me"

501
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:24,500
You can even kill me

502
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:29,084
"What makes you helpless?
Why do you grieve?"

503
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:33,375
"I belong to you,
so does my heart, my love"

504
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:45,292
"I'm a reveller, I make merry"

505
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:48,958
"I'm King of Hearts,
yet Ionely in my kingdom"

506
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:53,125
"Get off my back, O Love!
You are dubious"

507
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,084
"Whoever knows when you show
will your true colours"

508
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,000
"Cast a glance at me, too...
sweetheart, love me"

509
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:05,209
"I have given you my heart,
trust me"

510
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,084
"Sapna was singing very well,
wasn't she?"

511
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,500
"Listen to me, Tony.
- Okay"

512
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:38,042
Stop dreaming about Sapna

513
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:42,708
"It's not going to come true.
- No way, Goli"

514
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,500
"It will come true, really.
- Damn"

515
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:48,084
I'm going to make it big.
- Well!

516
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,250
Do you remember what I said?
- What?

517
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:55,583
Sapna doesn't love the doctor

518
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,792
Her parents have chosen him for her

519
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,042
Sapna is in love with me

520
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,708
"For her sake,
I want to become a rich man"

521
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:08,250
What are you raving?

522
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,792
You think you can become rich
and challenge that doctor?

523
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,708
I will!

524
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:20,875
"When you become rich, you think
her parents will marry her off to you?"

525
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,792
Exactly.
- You are silly

526
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:29,125
"Hey Goli, I'm not silly.
That doctor is silly"

527
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,500
"Yes, the doctor is silly, I'm silly...
- No, no"

528
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,375
You are my friend.
The doctor is mad

529
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,959
"I'm your friend, right?
So listen to this"

530
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:45,000
"Education, job, business, fame,
identity... they all matter in life"

531
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:49,208
No way! I don't want to study
and become a doctor

532
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:52,042
I just want to mint money

533
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:56,500
"Once I have money,
Sapna will belong to me"

534
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,084
You emptied it!

535
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,792
The one I was talking about...

536
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,542
it's him. Tony

537
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:22,208
A real daredevil

538
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:26,792
"Mr Mallya, if you need him any time,
do tell me"

539
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:37,000
You stole it from me
when we were kids

540
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:38,542
Where's my burger?
- At home

541
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:53,959
Where the hell did he transpire from?
- Who is he?

542
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,708
A very strict officer.
He has got many licences cancelled

543
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,042
I hope he doesn't spell trouble

544
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,416
"Hello, sir.
- Hello"

545
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,500
"Do you keep Bengrix?
- Yes, sir"

546
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:06,208
How much do you have? Where is it?
- Here it is

547
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,084
"How much you have in stock?
- Lots, sir"

548
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,042
New stocks arrived
only the day before

549
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,333
"Officers, confiscate
the entire stuff"

550
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:32,583
Mr Sinha

551
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,333
"Hello, Mr Gosai.
- Hello, Mr Sinha"

552
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,625
What are these?
- Vaccines

553
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,917
Prescribed for?
- For saving infants from hepatitis

554
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:54,208
Which company imported it?
- Our company

555
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,417
Can you tell me its' expiry date?

556
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,166
August 2004

557
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,417
August 2003

558
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,667
"Which means, this medicine
has already expired"

559
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,458
"It was funny, dad. I had to
tell them that I'm your youngest son"

560
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,333
"Yes Sinha?
- Dr Gosai from the FDA is here, sir"

561
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:36,667
He wants the entire stock of vaccines
to be destroyed

562
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,333
Give him the phone.
- One moment

563
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,208
He wants to talk to you

564
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:47,792
"Why did you take the trouble, doctor?"

565
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:50,500
I was planning
to meet you in person

566
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,500
"Mr Mallya, you will have to destroy the
entire stock of this particular vaccine"

567
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,291
"What are you saying, doctor?"

568
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,375
The stock costs millions.
I can't bear such a heavy loss

569
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,000
"You are talking about
profits and losses, are you?"

570
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,250
This concerns the lives of children

571
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:11,375
"Nothing untoward will happen, doctor"

572
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:15,417
This thing can be used for a year
or two more after the expiry date

573
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:19,500
"Thing, Mr Mallya?
What are you talking? It's a vaccine"

574
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:22,208
"I understand your point, Dr Gosai"

575
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:29,125
I had even asked my elder son to test
the vaccines and take your approval

576
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,875
I'm sending him over
to your office today itself...

577
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,709
with a letter and a packet

578
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:37,208
"No Mr Mallya,
I don't want any packet"

579
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,875
I'm not giving my approval.
Just do what I've told you to

580
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,875
"Else, I'll have to take
an action against the company"

581
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,458
This man is responsible
for the problem

582
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,417
We had very little time
for the despatch

583
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:13,208
"In a hurry, our labelling staff must
not have removed the old labels"

584
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,375
What were you doing there?

585
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:21,417
Why weren't the old labels removed when
the orders to change them were clear?

586
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:25,500
I'll think about your fate later

587
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:29,041
I must fix Dr Gosai first

588
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,542
"Wonderful, Tony. Only you
could get this file endorsed"

589
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:31,375
"If you need more money, do tell me.
You and I can go a long way"

590
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:35,000
Because there's one great thing
about you... You never ask questions

591
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:38,375
You accept a contract
and complete it in no time

592
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,709
"Anyway, why are you going to Delhi?"

593
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:43,167
There's one bad thing about you

594
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,208
"You have too many questions, and you
always leave your task undone"

595
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:49,333
"Just give me my money, Mr Patil.
- Here you are"

596
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:50,916
And...

597
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,125
A ring

598
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,250
"Put a ring on me, my love"

599
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:40,417
Sweetheart...

600
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,958
put a ring on my finger

601
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,584
"My love,
put a ring on my finger"

602
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,667
Take my pictures...

603
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,542
and keep one in your wallet

604
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:58,500
"My love,
put a ring on my finger"

605
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,875
"In my fantasies,
in my books, I search for you"

606
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:07,875
"On those colourful nights,
in my dreams, I probe"

607
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,875
Where have you hidden yourself?

608
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:15,791
"Come, make me your bride
and take me away"

609
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:23,375
"My love,
put a ring on my finger"

610
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,584
Take my pictures...

611
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:27,584
and keep one in your wallet

612
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:53,083
O my love

613
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,542
O my sweetheart

614
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,542
My darling

615
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,125
"Just tell me this much...
when will you come to me?"

616
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,917
"Either call me over,
or tell me your whereabouts"

617
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:36,625
I wait for you in anticipation

618
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,958
"Come to me,
sweep me off my feet"

619
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:48,500
Come and sweep me off my feet

620
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:52,459
"My love,
put a ring on my finger"

621
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:56,375
"Take my pictures
and keep one in your wallet"

622
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,666
There's a hell of a problem.
We have to move right now to Mumbai

623
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:06,500
Forget the show and come with me

624
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,209
"Attention, please. I'm sorry,
we have to end this show here"

625
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,000
Please cooperate

626
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:15,292
"Silence, please"

627
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:16,334
Please cooperate

628
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,875
"Madam, I need to reach Mumbai
at the earliest"

629
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:25,042
"Just get me one ticket, please"

630
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,875
The flight is full. I'll certainly
confirm you in the next flight

631
01:06:32,209 --> 01:06:34,958
"I tried all other airlines too,
but they are also going full"

632
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:39,209
"One of my friends, a duty manager,
is also off duty"

633
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,583
"I have a confirmed ticket,
if you want..."

634
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,042
It's Tony bhai!
The problem is solved

635
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,666
"Madam, don't think too much,
just get the boarding pass"

636
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:50,000
"Thank you, Tony bhai.
Let's go, madam"

637
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:54,042
"Madam, here's a confirmed ticket"

638
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:57,042
What the hell!
Aren't you going to Mumbai?

639
01:06:57,459 --> 01:06:59,875
"Not me, you are not going.
I gave her your ticket"

640
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:02,042
I see... what the hell!

641
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,917
You are always upto some tricks.
Not happening! I'm going to Mumbai

642
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:07,875
"Try to understand, Goli.
- To hell with Goli! Understand what?"

643
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:11,708
"I'm going, and that's final"

644
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,666
"Try to understand, Goli.
- Why do you always have to trap me?"

645
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,042
Why don't you understand?
- Am I your friend or not?

646
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:24,500
You have solved a grave problem.
She had to leave on an urgent matter

647
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,917
Yes?
- Thank me. I have to take a train now

648
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:31,625
Is that so?
Why do you need to take a train?

649
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,958
"You are flying with me.
- Yes, Mr Pankaj is with you"

650
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:37,917
"Nothing to worry, okay?
- I'll fix you later"

651
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:42,792
"Mr Goli, calm down.
I'm buying you a flight ticket"

652
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,000
"Will you buy me snacks first?
- Sure, come with me"

653
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:51,541
Welcome back to Zee News

654
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:55,417
The police today presented
Dr Hargobind Gosai in court

655
01:07:55,875 --> 01:08:00,334
Dr Gosai had approved an expired
vaccine of Surya Pharma

656
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:04,625
So far the vaccine has killed
three infants

657
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,792
"Call the doctor quickly, please.
Oh, my baby!"

658
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:15,167
"Please let us go in.
- Move back, please"

659
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,541
Don't crowd around here.
Back off

660
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,458
Bring it down!

661
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:40,125
Break it!

662
01:09:55,209 --> 01:09:57,375
Down with Food and Drug
Administration department!

663
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,792
This way?
- Yes

664
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,333
Where?
- Right ahead

665
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,333
Papa!

666
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:19,500
"Are you all right, papa?"

667
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:23,084
"What happened to him, mama?
- Not to worry, dear"

668
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,708
Everything will be fine

669
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,583
But how did this happen?
What have the doctors to say?

670
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,875
So then...?
Are you married to Sapna?

671
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:25,042
Now buy a ticket and leave for
Switzerland. For your honeymoon

672
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:34,375
"I always told you that the line you
were thinking along, was wrong"

673
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:37,708
And you see what a huge fuss
it has created?

674
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:45,000
Now when Sapna gets to know that you
are the cause of her father's ruin...

675
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,917
"she's going to garland you and
take you as a husband, isn't she?"

676
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:57,875
Can you dig a void in a girl's life
and yet win over her heart? Tell me

677
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,959
I'm the one who has done a wrong.
And I will correct it

678
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,208
Where's Patil?
- I don't know

679
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,959
You don't know?
- No

680
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,416
What's going on here?
- I'll show you

681
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:32,042
"I ask, where is Patil?
- Have you gone mad...?"

682
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,042
Get him!

683
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:46,083
There's a football match being
played in my office!

684
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:48,875
That bloody Tony's scoring
goal after goal!

685
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:53,458
He wrecked my guys and my furniture
and now he's looking for me

686
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,917
You can understand why he's
looking for me... right?

687
01:13:57,959 --> 01:14:00,166
"Forget about me, he's not going
to spare you either, Mr Mallya"

688
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,500
He's one dangerous guy...
- So what are you trying to say?

689
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,875
We ought to be scared of him
and hide in our houses?

690
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:10,208
"Now look, Patil. What and how you
deal with that boy, I don't know"

691
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,166
Because he's your responsibility
and your man

692
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:17,500
But I want news of his death
at the earliest possible

693
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,875
"What are you saying, Mr Srivastav...?
One minute. Talk to Madam"

694
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:27,667
"We have telephoned you with
great hopes, Mr Srivastav"

695
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:30,291
If a capable lawyer like you refuses
to handle this case...

696
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:33,500
No lawyer is going to
accept this case

697
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:36,125
Yes...
- It'll ruin his career

698
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:38,917
No one can save Dr Gosai
in this case

699
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,333
But...
- I'm sorry

700
01:14:45,542 --> 01:14:49,500
"My Lord, a doctor is someone..."

701
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:54,208
who is directly connected with a
man's life and his suffering

702
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:58,542
This profession has been given
an exalted status...

703
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,041
that is close to God's

704
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:04,542
When a doctor sits at a
government undertaking...

705
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,542
his responsibilities increase
even more

706
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:13,542
There was this poison being sold
in the market as a drug...

707
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,750
which claimed the lives
of several children

708
01:15:19,542 --> 01:15:23,208
"And all this happened because of one
signature, the one he had approved"

709
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:32,542
Dr Gosai's crime has not just cast
a slur on the doctors' profession...

710
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,583
it has also raised a question-mark
over humanity

711
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:41,583
Such is the gravity of his crime
that no lawyer accepted his brief

712
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:48,583
"I have produced enough evidence in
court to prove his guilt, sir"

713
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,750
I now appeal to the court...

714
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:53,583
to pronounce the severest
of punishments to Dr Gosai

715
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:06,917
"Having heard the whole case,
the court agrees..."

716
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:10,208
"that whatever Dr Gosai did,
was a grave crime"

717
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:14,292
"However, as per the traditions
of the law..."

718
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:18,958
an accused has the right
to present his defence

719
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:24,041
This court therefore directs Dr Gosai
to appoint a lawyer...

720
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:28,875
and remands him to police custody
till the next hearing

721
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,667
You bastard!

722
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:54,166
You've killed our children!

723
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,667
Kill him! Kill!

724
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,667
Let me go! He has
killed our children!

725
01:17:01,709 --> 01:17:04,000
Beat him up! Thrash him!

726
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,250
Thrash him!

727
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:18,041
Leave me alone! He has
taken our children's lives!

728
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,166
Thrash him!

729
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:34,041
"As you can see, people are
very angry with Dr Gosai"

730
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:37,958
They are getting violent and the police
is finding it difficult to control them

731
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:42,500
"Obviously, people harbour great
resentment against Dr Gosai"

732
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:46,667
The death of three children has
created tension in the whole city

733
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:50,667
People are trying to break the
police cordon and reach Dr Gosai

734
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,375
To bring the situation
under control...

735
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,542
the police had to resort to
tear-gas shells at several places

736
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,333
"At some places, the police even
had to cane the public"

737
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:04,041
"However, the people's resentment is
overwhelming the might of the police"

738
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:07,542
Anything untoward could happen
in a situation like this

739
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:10,709
It remains to be seen is what step
the police take to ensure...

740
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,916
Dr Gosai's security and
control over the public

741
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,709
The lives of several children
were saved...

742
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,333
because of the presence of mind
and hard work of other doctors

743
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:25,083
The doctors have severely criticised
Dr Gosai's doings

744
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,208
"In the court, the lawyer
for the state..."

745
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,750
appealed for a severe punishment
for Dr Gosai

746
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:36,167
"However, the Judge J.R. Dixit asked
for a lawyer to be appointed for Gosai"

747
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:39,083
He also sent Gosai
to police remand

748
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:41,542
According to latest information...

749
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:45,333
a Committee is being formed to
enquire into the matter

750
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:49,125
It remains to be seen
how the police...

751
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:51,333
gain control over
the public ire

752
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,292
This is Radhika Sen
for Zee News

753
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,292
I'll see that he brushes his teeth.
You can go ahead and eat

754
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:36,292
"Quickly brush your teeth, son.
I'll tell you about a new case then"

755
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:38,333
"Very well, grandpa"

756
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,500
See? Doesn't it feel fresh?

757
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:46,833
You must brush your teeth
after dinner every night

758
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:49,167
"Indeed, grandpa.
- Like a good boy"

759
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,208
Who are you?
And how did you get here?

760
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,500
I've locked up your family
and the securitymen

761
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:06,875
I want to stop you from
taking a wrong decision

762
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:08,208
What wrong decision?

763
01:20:08,459 --> 01:20:12,667
"Dr Gosai is innocent, sir.
- How can he be innocent?"

764
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,459
He has given approval
to a harmful vaccine

765
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,667
He has even signed
the test-reports

766
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:21,667
I forced him to put his signature
on them. I was paid to do it

767
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:25,500
And how much have you been paid now by
Dr Hargobind to come and tell me this?

768
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:30,000
Dr Hargobind is not a child anyone
can get to sign something

769
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:33,208
I had threatened him.
- What threats?

770
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,625
And how could he give in?

771
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:39,875
He ought to have thought of the
power and position he holds

772
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:44,708
"For fear of death, he gave the nod
for poison to be sold as medicine"

773
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,542
Was the fear of death more
powerful than his duties...?

774
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,875
The law's the same
for everyone

775
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:59,375
What are you doing...? What?

776
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:03,875
Please don't kill him!
He's my only heir!

777
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:07,208
Please don't kill him! Please!

778
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,875
Don't kill him! Please!

779
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,250
That's how Dr Hargobind
was scared too

780
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:41,375
Get the bastard!

781
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:19,292
Get the car back! Hurry

782
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,000
Step on it!

783
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,375
Where has the bastard gone?

784
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,042
"Get down and take a look, Chandu.
- Why must I?"

785
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,833
You get down and take a look

786
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:51,042
Help! Help!

787
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:55,083
Help!

788
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,750
You sit cozily in your house
after killing our children?

789
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:06,417
We'll drag you out of your house
and kill you! Come on out!

790
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:13,541
"Whoever dies, they're only
bothered about the money!"

791
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:19,417
They won't come down like this!
They'll have to be dragged here!

792
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,750
"Stay away, Mother!"

793
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:31,125
Are you listening?

794
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,792
Will you come down on your own
or must we come up there?

795
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:35,458
Kill them!

796
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,292
Why are you throwing
the stones?

797
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,375
"Because of this doctor, three
children have lost their lives!"

798
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,458
Have you lost a child?

799
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,833
Have you?

800
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:26,833
Get the hell out of here!

801
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,917
Mr Saxena...

802
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:48,750
do not break the alliance
at a time like this

803
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:51,250
Please accept my daughter

804
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,250
"Once she's married,
her life..."

805
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:57,250
Must we make our lives hell
for the sake of her life?

806
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,708
The whole of the city
is spitting at you folks

807
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,042
But we must get our
son married to your daughter...

808
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:04,833
so that we get a bad name
in society?

809
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:08,667
Isn't that what you want?
- My husband is not that kind of a man

810
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:11,833
He has surely been victimised.
I know it deep down in my heart

811
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:14,250
But the world doesn't go by
what your heart says

812
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:17,416
The whole world knows what
Dr Gosai has done

813
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,500
"Brother, we're already
very depressed"

814
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:24,084
"By breaking this alliance,
please don't..."

815
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,084
You are wasting your time

816
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:28,875
What you think is not
going to happen

817
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,000
A killer's daughter can never
become my daughter-in-law

818
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,291
"Say something, son"

819
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,084
You have approved of Sapna too

820
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,833
I think daddy's right

821
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:46,291
Hear that?
You may leave now

822
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,750
"And yes, make sure you hide
your face when you're going out"

823
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,333
We mustn't be put
to any inconvenience

824
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,416
We're a respectable family

825
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:13,500
You are wasting your time

826
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:16,333
What you think is not
going to happen

827
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,333
A killer's daughter can never
become my daughter-in-law

828
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,792
I think daddy's right

829
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:27,875
Hear that?
You may leave now

830
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:31,833
"And yes, make sure you hide
your face when you're going out"

831
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,833
We mustn't be put
to any inconvenience

832
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,167
We're a respectable family

833
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:53,375
Lay off!

834
01:28:57,084 --> 01:29:00,375
I've killed!
I've killed children!

835
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,542
I've killed children!

836
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:06,042
I'm a murderer!

837
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:09,375
Don't get close to me!

838
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:13,375
Don't get close to me!

839
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:19,375
"What did you say? If you've killed
three guys, it's your profession"

840
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:24,000
"But I'm a doctor!
And yet, I've killed children!"

841
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,208
I've murdered small children!

842
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,416
I ought to be given the
most severe punishment!

843
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:32,084
The most severe punishment!

844
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,208
No... don't touch me!

845
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,458
You found the right time
to desert me!

846
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:12,458
"You promised to stand by me
through out my life, didn't you?"

847
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,250
And you couldn't share a few
difficult days with me?

848
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:20,042
"I'm glad, I've at least got to
know the sort of guy you are"

849
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:25,125
"Before saying anything to me,
look at your own family..."

850
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:28,042
the things the whole city
is saying about your father

851
01:30:28,542 --> 01:30:30,250
"But you're not the rest
of the city, are you?"

852
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:33,500
You were so dear to me.
You also knew Papa would never...

853
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,792
I was wrong. The truth about him
has been exposed now

854
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:41,291
I can't ruin my career
by marrying you

855
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:45,208
I won't beg you to marry me either.
- Now look...

856
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:50,166
"Dr Ajay Saxena, the future and
the career you're talking about..."

857
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,583
has been given to you by my Papa

858
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:55,125
Who got you an admission
in the medical college?

859
01:30:55,792 --> 01:30:57,375
It was my Papa!
- You're talking too much

860
01:30:57,542 --> 01:31:00,875
Remember how you stood before him?
And this hospital...

861
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:05,166
in which you make a living?
Who got you the land to build it?

862
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,625
It was my Papa!

863
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:27,166
The family respect and honour you and
your father are talking about...

864
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:29,542
is all thanks to the favours
my father did to you

865
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:40,083
And I'm glad you have
rejected this alliance

866
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,709
Listen!

867
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,166
Listen!

868
01:32:08,917 --> 01:32:11,875
A woman has fallen off that building!
- Where?

869
01:32:12,625 --> 01:32:14,375
Watchman!

870
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,250
You found the right time
to desert me!

871
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,208
"You promised to stand by me
through out my life, didn't you?"

872
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:25,542
And you couldn't share a few
difficult days with me?

873
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,500
Let go of my hand

874
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:31,083
Let go of my hand

875
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,167
Let go!

876
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:36,625
Your father is innocent

877
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:42,208
Can you tell them that
my father is innocent?

878
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:44,542
Will you go with me
and tell them?

879
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:48,083
Please come with me! Tell them
that my father is innocent!

880
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:03,667
Faster please

881
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:08,666
"Faster, please.
We're in a hurry"

882
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,542
"Why don't you understand, madam?
Visiting hours are over"

883
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,875
You will have to take special
permission from the jailor...

884
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:34,875
Where is the jailor?
I'll have a word with him

885
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,958
Come to him.
He'll deal with you

886
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,708
"Sir, this woman won't understand"

887
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,958
"Sir, I'm Dr Hargobind
Gosai's daughter"

888
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,875
I must see him immediately.
Please do something

889
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:48,334
"What did the constable
say to you, madam?"

890
01:37:49,042 --> 01:37:52,584
The visiting hours are over.
We can't let you see him now

891
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:55,584
"You better come on Monday.
- Monday will be too late, sir"

892
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:57,500
I must see him immediately

893
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:01,500
I must tell him that the charges
against him are false. He's innocent!

894
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:04,584
"Sir, my father has lost
the will to live"

895
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,542
"When he meets this man,
it'll give him a new hope"

896
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:10,250
"Please let me see him for
2 minutes, sir. Just 2 minutes"

897
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:14,584
"Look, Miss. I've told you that
I can't bend the laws"

898
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,916
Strange man!
Can't you understand?

899
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,916
It has to do with
my father's life and death!

900
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:20,708
Anything could happen to him

901
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,916
I want to tell him that there is
someone who can prove his innocence

902
01:38:24,334 --> 01:38:27,542
That he'll be released from prison!
- So what's the problem?

903
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:30,167
You can tell him all this on Monday.
I can't do anything for you

904
01:38:30,542 --> 01:38:34,167
Why don't you understand?
- Sapna...

905
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:38,542
let's come and see him later.
It's a matter of only 2 days

906
01:38:39,459 --> 01:38:41,417
Nothing's going to
happen to him

907
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:02,791
What are you looking at?

908
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:06,083
I'm seeing the strange twist
my life has taken

909
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:10,000
The man I was supposed to marry...

910
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:14,791
the one who promised to stand by me
all my life...

911
01:39:16,042 --> 01:39:18,334
the one I shared
so many dreams with...

912
01:39:20,042 --> 01:39:23,666
has today deserted me
at a time...

913
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,334
when I need him the most

914
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:30,666
And you...

915
01:39:32,042 --> 01:39:33,833
a total stranger...

916
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:37,375
whose love I could
never understand...

917
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,541
you are the one who breathes
life into me today

918
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:49,042
Where is the gift you
wanted to give me?

919
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:13,541
Put it around my neck

920
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:31,042
"My heart is lost
in your obsession..."

921
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:49,417
"My heart is lost
in your obsession..."

922
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:56,417
"My heart is lost
in your obsession..."

923
01:40:56,875 --> 01:41:02,083
"you are the one
I have fallen in love with"

924
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:24,292
"In you, I have found godliness"

925
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:30,125
I have found every happiness

926
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:36,583
"In you, I have found godliness"

927
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:42,583
I have found every happiness

928
01:41:43,334 --> 01:41:48,708
"God has begun to be
kind to me"

929
01:41:49,209 --> 01:41:54,334
"God has begun to be
kind to me"

930
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:59,875
"My heart is lost
in your obsession..."

931
01:42:00,334 --> 01:42:05,833
"you are the one
I have fallen in love with"

932
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:48,209
"Love has finally been
merciful to me"

933
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:54,167
"I find myself
in my beloved's arms"

934
01:42:55,375 --> 01:43:00,333
"Love has finally been
merciful to me"

935
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:06,209
"I find myself
in my beloved's arms"

936
01:43:07,042 --> 01:43:12,209
"The dream I had,
is now fulfilled"

937
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:23,209
"My heart is lost
in your obsession..."

938
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:49,333
No...

939
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:52,333
no...

940
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:35,959
For how long shall
the goat be safe?

941
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,875
"One day, it has to be sacrificed"

942
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:51,834
"Fortunately for you, the visiting
hours were over, my friend"

943
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,708
But there is going to be
an explosion for sure

944
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,834
God must show a miracle now and that
old man must have a bout of amnesia

945
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:07,375
There's another way too

946
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:10,375
Let the two of us
run away to Dubai

947
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:15,000
"Forget about the girl, okay?"

948
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,416
"Hurry up, madam. We can meet
the doctor today"

949
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:27,750
The visiting hours are from 11 to 2.
- But I've got to take Tony along

950
01:46:28,084 --> 01:46:30,208
Because today is Independence Day...

951
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:33,416
"they have relaxed the
visiting hours today, madam"

952
01:46:33,834 --> 01:46:35,583
We have very little time.
We must leave immediately

953
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,084
But where will I look for Tony?

954
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:39,708
You can take Tony along some other day.
You won't get a chance like this

955
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:45,250
"Let's go. It's late already.
C'mon, get up"

956
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:12,834
Papa... how have you been?

957
01:47:16,542 --> 01:47:20,291
"Papa, you will be
released very soon"

958
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:27,500
"Stop having this dream, my child.
That's not possible anymore"

959
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,708
"No, Papa. It's not a dream.
It's the truth"

960
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:33,834
It'll be proved in court that the
charges against you are false

961
01:47:34,542 --> 01:47:39,500
My child... only you can think
like that and say such things

962
01:47:40,542 --> 01:47:44,500
"There's no one else in the city.
- There is, Papa"

963
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,208
There is someone who will say
that you are innocent

964
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:26,875
"Yes, she was here"

965
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:35,959
She has got to know everything.
She was terribly angry

966
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:34,792
"Is Ms Sapna in?
- Yes, she is"

967
01:49:40,792 --> 01:49:44,417
Why are you here?
Go away from here. Go away

968
01:49:46,292 --> 01:49:47,333
"Listen to me, Sapna"

969
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:49,125
Not a word!

970
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,208
What's left with me now
that you want to snatch?

971
01:49:51,458 --> 01:49:55,083
You destroyed my family.
You ruined my father's life

972
01:49:55,417 --> 01:49:58,375
He is charged with murder
and he is behind bars now

973
01:49:58,834 --> 01:50:02,000
And my mother... she was so
traumatised that she embraced death

974
01:50:02,417 --> 01:50:04,667
Death! Know what death means?
She is dead

975
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:05,667
Dead

976
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:08,292
What else can I offer you?
Want to kill me?

977
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:11,166
"Here, kill me!
Go on, just kill me!"

978
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,458
"If you can't do that,
get out of here"

979
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:18,667
"Get out! I hate
your very sight, Tony"

980
01:50:22,709 --> 01:50:25,208
"Go on, hate me"

981
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:28,166
I'm destined to be hated

982
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:31,208
My life is nothing
but contempt and hatred

983
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:36,500
I agree that I'm responsible
for whatever's happened to you

984
01:50:37,709 --> 01:50:41,041
But I did all that
because I wanted you

985
01:50:41,709 --> 01:50:43,709
I wanted to raise my status
to be level with you

986
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:48,166
"The doctor whom I forced upon,
was your father... how was I to know?"

987
01:50:48,834 --> 01:50:51,333
"Let alone your father, had I known
it would take children's lives..."

988
01:50:51,709 --> 01:50:53,417
I wouldn't ever let
this thing happen

989
01:50:53,709 --> 01:50:56,875
"But at that moment, I was
just obsessed... I wanted you"

990
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:05,333
Destiny hurled me into darkness
as soon as I was born

991
01:51:06,709 --> 01:51:10,333
"I was seven, when my uncle left me
sleeping in a train"

992
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,333
"I grew up in squalor. At the age
of seven, I worked in a liquor shop"

993
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,375
"Hunger taught me to steal,
to snatch"

994
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:23,375
I chose the path
that I happened to tread on

995
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:28,167
"Sapna, I had no one to tell me
what's good and what's bad"

996
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:34,709
"For all my agonies,
I wiped my own tears"

997
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:42,208
"For the love, the hopes
and the resolves in my life..."

998
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:45,500
I have only you

999
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:48,833
But today...?

1000
01:52:09,833 --> 01:52:11,167
Where?
- Over there

1001
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,292
Where's Tony?

1002
01:52:27,709 --> 01:52:30,041
Where's your lover Tony?

1003
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:32,791
He's not here

1004
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:37,375
Where is he?
Where's Tony? Tell me

1005
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:41,083
Where? Speak up!
- He was here... he's gone

1006
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:46,542
"He was here, but he's gone?
Where did he go?"

1007
01:52:46,916 --> 01:52:49,459
I don't know.
- Where did he go? Tell me

1008
01:52:49,875 --> 01:52:52,916
"Or, I'll smash you.
Where did he go?"

1009
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:54,375
I don't know

1010
01:52:54,875 --> 01:52:56,375
"You don't understand, eh?
- I don't know"

1011
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:02,333
Do you recall?

1012
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:07,000
"When it comes to romance, you are game,
but you won't tell me his whereabouts"

1013
01:53:07,542 --> 01:53:09,250
The name is Patil. Vikas Patil

1014
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:12,292
If you don't tell me his whereabouts
I'll drag you outside

1015
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:16,542
"Don't mess with me. Pakya,
tell her what I did last time..."

1016
01:53:22,417 --> 01:53:24,083
Pakya! Take care of her

1017
01:53:40,875 --> 01:53:45,125
Hi Tony. Where were you?
I came here looking for you

1018
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:46,875
Ask her

1019
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,542
"I was looking for you, I swear"

1020
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:01,500
"Well Patil, did you hit the girl?"

1021
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:03,375
I was mistaken...

1022
01:54:24,542 --> 01:54:25,459
"No, Tony..."

1023
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:48,000
"Tony, don't hit me... stop"

1024
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:50,584
I've had enough.
What are you upto?

1025
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:55,666
"You smashed my office first,
now you've smashed me"

1026
01:54:56,958 --> 01:55:00,708
What do you want from me? Tell me

1027
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:03,125
Please don't hit me

1028
01:55:04,542 --> 01:55:07,417
Who gave us the contract for taking
signatures from Dr Hargobind?

1029
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,708
Who is he?

1030
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,083
"Oh no, don't mess with him..."

1031
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,292
Raj Mallya!

1032
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:20,833
Relief Pharma's owner. Raj Mallya

1033
01:55:26,542 --> 01:55:29,375
"Tony, I have
told you everything, okay?"

1034
01:55:31,042 --> 01:55:33,958
Let me take a breather.
I want to chew a betel leaf

1035
01:55:36,917 --> 01:55:38,334
"Damn, there's none"

1036
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,542
"Let me have a cigarette, please"

1037
01:55:54,833 --> 01:55:59,750
Listen... don't mess with Raj Mallya

1038
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:02,417
He's a very dangerous man

1039
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,500
Would you give me matches?

1040
01:56:07,917 --> 01:56:10,583
You riddled me!
But I'll put that behind me

1041
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,833
"I'll forgive you,
just spare me..."

1042
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:29,334
"On my way out,
I saw Patil's man"

1043
01:56:30,666 --> 01:56:34,125
This place isn't safe for you.
Come with me

1044
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:14,167
"Hurry up, Goli"

1045
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:27,917
How did they restore the phone line?
Did you pay the bill?

1046
01:57:28,292 --> 01:57:30,875
"No, I didn't pay the bill"

1047
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:35,500
When did you arrive?
- Just two minutes before you did

1048
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,167
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

1049
01:58:45,917 --> 01:58:48,250
I think you dialled the wrong number.
Try again

1050
01:58:53,708 --> 01:58:55,375
He's standing right behind us!

1051
01:59:51,375 --> 01:59:52,333
Hands up

1052
01:59:57,333 --> 01:59:58,541
All right... this way

1053
02:00:27,291 --> 02:00:29,042
Want to speak to Mallya

1054
02:00:29,416 --> 02:00:32,708
Regarding?
- Regarding Dr Hargobind Gosai

1055
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:36,583
"At the moment, he is...
- I have knocked out Patil"

1056
02:00:37,333 --> 02:00:40,458
If you delay putting me on
to Mallya...

1057
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:42,875
"I'll shoot you, too"

1058
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,458
Sinha here.
Put me through to the boss

1059
02:01:03,209 --> 02:01:05,541
"Go on, Sinha.
- A boy is here"

1060
02:01:05,917 --> 02:01:08,291
"He says...
- Hang on, Sinha"

1061
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:12,458
"Welcome Vijay, my son.
Happy birthday"

1062
02:01:15,375 --> 02:01:18,167
"Where's my gift, dad?
Is it a surprise this time, too?"

1063
02:01:18,541 --> 02:01:22,125
I'm not telling you.
You can check it out when you get it

1064
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:26,542
"Where're you celebrating your birthday?
- I'm not telling you, dad"

1065
02:01:26,917 --> 02:01:30,000
"Find out, if you can.
- I found out last time"

1066
02:01:30,375 --> 02:01:33,000
"But you can't catch me this time, dad.
- Wanna bet?"

1067
02:01:33,375 --> 02:01:37,333
"Done. If I win,
the gift will be of my choice"

1068
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:48,000
"Go on, Sinha"

1069
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:50,750
"Sir, we have a problem
in the office"

1070
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:54,375
The chap here has a gun

1071
02:01:55,167 --> 02:01:58,833
He wants to meet you.
Wants to talk to you about Dr Gosai

1072
02:02:00,208 --> 02:02:03,667
"He says, he'll shoot me
if I don't fix a meeting with you"

1073
02:02:08,166 --> 02:02:10,166
Who? Which doctor?

1074
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:15,000
"Mallya, after meeting me
you will remember the doctor"

1075
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,750
Are you threatening me?
- I'm not threatening you

1076
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,166
I'm threatening Sinha

1077
02:02:23,208 --> 02:02:26,792
"If he doesn't fix my meeting
with you, I'll shoot him"

1078
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:31,708
"Do you want to meet him or not, sir?
- No"

1079
02:02:42,416 --> 02:02:43,333
"What happened, Sinha?"

1080
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:47,375
Shot me

1081
02:03:18,042 --> 02:03:19,042
Who?

1082
02:04:06,125 --> 02:04:08,834
Love lies strewn...

1083
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:11,542
at your feet

1084
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:26,041
Love lies strewn...

1085
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:28,500
at your feet

1086
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:32,166
"Radiance!
There's only radiance..."

1087
02:04:32,542 --> 02:04:34,667
in those eyes

1088
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:22,542
"Intoxication
worships beauty tonight"

1089
02:05:25,625 --> 02:05:30,542
Life appears to be helpless

1090
02:06:11,667 --> 02:06:15,583
Marvellous is your beauty

1091
02:06:19,958 --> 02:06:25,333
"Let me commit a crime! For,
the night itself is transgressing"

1092
02:06:57,333 --> 02:06:59,250
Vijay! Come out!

1093
02:07:27,584 --> 02:07:28,542
Let go!

1094
02:07:29,709 --> 02:07:30,709
Let me go!

1095
02:07:33,709 --> 02:07:35,000
Overtake him!

1096
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:13,000
"Tony, this guy is..."

1097
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:23,791
Do you see the outcome of being sired
by a scoundrel of a father?

1098
02:09:25,709 --> 02:09:30,000
"Tell me something. On your car
worth 6 million, you move around..."

1099
02:09:31,875 --> 02:09:33,208
smooching girls...

1100
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:35,125
dancing in pubs...

1101
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:43,500
blowing up your father's money...

1102
02:09:43,875 --> 02:09:47,000
did you ever bother to know
how he earned the money?

1103
02:09:47,667 --> 02:09:48,625
"Speak, jerk"

1104
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,958
Your father is a punk

1105
02:09:52,375 --> 02:09:55,208
Really. He slits people's throats

1106
02:09:55,584 --> 02:09:58,500
He sells poison for medicines.
But you don't need to worry

1107
02:09:58,875 --> 02:10:02,500
His matter is going to be settled.
He has entered Tony's mind...

1108
02:10:02,875 --> 02:10:04,833
so he is dead

1109
02:10:08,083 --> 02:10:09,542
Want to say something?

1110
02:10:09,875 --> 02:10:12,167
"So say it, man.
Why must you bother? Allow me"

1111
02:10:16,375 --> 02:10:18,584
He will die.
He will die for no reason

1112
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:21,708
"He doesn't know my father.
- Oh no, don't worry"

1113
02:10:22,584 --> 02:10:25,666
"He'll surely get to know your father.
After all, you've set him on this task"

1114
02:10:42,125 --> 02:10:43,167
Tony here

1115
02:10:44,666 --> 02:10:47,500
Your son is with me.
He is alive

1116
02:10:59,916 --> 02:11:05,875
Trace the number

1117
02:11:20,958 --> 02:11:23,916
You have to reach the court
by eleven tomorrow

1118
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:26,708
And you got to confess that...

1119
02:11:26,958 --> 02:11:30,500
"you are responsible for the
children's death, not Dr Gosai"

1120
02:11:31,042 --> 02:11:34,708
"Are you threatening me?
- No, I'm only telling you"

1121
02:11:35,167 --> 02:11:37,916
You have to reach the court
by eleven tomorrow

1122
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:04,625
Taking me on will
prove you very costly

1123
02:12:05,292 --> 02:12:11,292
"If you want to live,
drop my son home, safe and sound"

1124
02:12:13,334 --> 02:12:16,750
I will. I will surely
drop him home

1125
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:23,083
"He will be your son, no doubt,
but he won't be breathing"

1126
02:12:32,042 --> 02:12:33,666
Do as I tell you

1127
02:12:34,042 --> 02:12:36,292
"Tony, listen to me"

1128
02:12:37,125 --> 02:12:39,541
What will you gain
from Dr Gosai's release?

1129
02:12:40,708 --> 02:12:45,334
Join hands with me.
You will get the price you name

1130
02:12:50,125 --> 02:12:54,625
"If you still fail to realise,
you will be in real trouble"

1131
02:12:55,042 --> 02:12:57,334
Enmity with me
will prove you costly

1132
02:13:03,666 --> 02:13:06,666
I have shown many Tonys
the way to heaven

1133
02:13:07,209 --> 02:13:10,334
Looks like you don't want
your son alive

1134
02:13:10,708 --> 02:13:15,042
You will soon know
how much I love my son

1135
02:13:15,417 --> 02:13:19,167
Don't forget that
I am Raj Mallya

1136
02:13:56,875 --> 02:13:58,458
"Vicky, tell him..."

1137
02:13:59,125 --> 02:14:03,334
"if he wants to live,
give us Vijay's whereabouts"

1138
02:14:04,125 --> 02:14:05,083
Else...

1139
02:14:28,125 --> 02:14:29,875
Where's my brother? Speak!

1140
02:14:34,875 --> 02:14:36,416
Where's my brother? Tell me

1141
02:14:37,167 --> 02:14:38,084
Speak up!

1142
02:14:39,084 --> 02:14:40,042
Speak!

1143
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,958
I don't think he's going
to give in so easily

1144
02:15:14,958 --> 02:15:15,875
Do something

1145
02:17:22,042 --> 02:17:23,042
Mr Mallya...

1146
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:43,458
Get him!

1147
02:17:52,375 --> 02:17:54,333
We will never find Vijay
if he's dead

1148
02:19:30,208 --> 02:19:31,875
"Ask him for the last time, Vicky"

1149
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:37,208
Tell me. Where's my brother?

1150
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,208
Speak!

1151
02:19:45,208 --> 02:19:46,917
"Mustn't trust him, dad"

1152
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:48,875
Take him along

1153
02:20:19,834 --> 02:20:21,458
Is this the building?

1154
02:20:24,458 --> 02:20:26,542
"Yes, this is the one"

1155
02:22:56,166 --> 02:22:58,000
"You were right, Vicky"

1156
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:01,958
You guys mustn't trust me

1157
02:23:26,667 --> 02:23:27,584
No!

1158
02:23:30,958 --> 02:23:33,000
"Vicky, my son!"

1159
02:23:34,709 --> 02:23:36,000
Son...!

1160
02:23:38,792 --> 02:23:39,709
Open it!

1161
02:23:54,709 --> 02:23:58,000
Hey Mallya! How did you
like my game?

1162
02:23:59,625 --> 02:24:01,500
I set him up

1163
02:24:04,958 --> 02:24:09,709
You held me on the phone.
I knew your men would reach me

1164
02:24:10,709 --> 02:24:14,667
"From the torture to this explosion,
I had planned it all"

1165
02:24:17,542 --> 02:24:19,500
One of your sons is out

1166
02:24:20,709 --> 02:24:23,000
If you don't reach court tomorrow...

1167
02:24:23,584 --> 02:24:26,000
Vijay is going to suffer
the same fate

1168
02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:52,459
"At eleven tomorrow, in court!"

1169
02:25:52,833 --> 02:25:55,791
"Else, you will find Vijay's corpse
in your house at twelve tomorrow"

1170
02:26:13,875 --> 02:26:16,292
All the evidences
and testimonies...

1171
02:26:16,667 --> 02:26:19,542
prove the charges levelled
on Dr Gosai

1172
02:26:19,958 --> 02:26:22,500
"Dr Gosai, for selfish reasons..."

1173
02:26:22,875 --> 02:26:25,167
took undue advantage
of his status

1174
02:26:25,875 --> 02:26:30,333
The court holds Dr Gosai responsible
for the death of the children

1175
02:26:30,875 --> 02:26:34,542
"And for this heinous crime,
the court convicts him..."

1176
02:26:37,708 --> 02:26:40,459
"Not Dr Gosai,
I committed this crime"

1177
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,417
I'm responsible for
the children's death

1178
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:51,500
I had floated a proxy company
and marketed those vaccines

1179
02:26:54,042 --> 02:26:57,875
Raj Mallya confessed
to his crimes in court

1180
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:02,000
"He admitted that,
to avoid losses in millions..."

1181
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:05,292
he put the spurious vaccines
up on sale

1182
02:27:06,042 --> 02:27:10,167
He connived with Patil to put
the honest Dr Gosai to shame

1183
02:27:10,666 --> 02:27:13,167
"Patil, in turn,
entrusted the task to Tony"

1184
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:17,791
"For this entire incident,
the court termed Raj Mallya..."

1185
02:27:18,208 --> 02:27:20,791
as the prime accused
and sentenced him to life

1186
02:27:21,167 --> 02:27:24,542
For desecrating his position...

1187
02:27:24,916 --> 02:27:27,875
and misusing his rights
under pressure...

1188
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:30,708
the court sentenced Dr Gosai
to five years imprisonment

1189
02:27:31,042 --> 02:27:34,875
For threatening Dr Gosai and for
forcing him to do a barbaric act...

1190
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:38,208
the court sentenced Tony
to three years imprisonment

1191
02:27:39,666 --> 02:27:42,584
"Later on, yielding to the requests
of social organisations..."

1192
02:27:42,916 --> 02:27:45,292
and considering
Dr Gosai's services...

1193
02:27:45,666 --> 02:27:47,958
he got a pardon of two years

1194
02:27:48,916 --> 02:27:52,958
"Even today, Raj Mallya is spending
his time in jail for his crimes"

1195
02:27:53,459 --> 02:27:54,708
Dr Gosai is running a school
for mentally disabled children

1196
02:27:57,875 --> 02:28:02,584
As for Tony... he married Sapna
and is leading a common man's life
