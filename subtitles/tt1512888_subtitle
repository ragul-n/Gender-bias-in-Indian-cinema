1
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:50,242
A small hamlet...
Present Thanjavur...

2
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,009
Lord!

3
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:58,173
My clan is getting wiped out
because of King of Pandia,

4
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,545
you must raise my children,

5
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,278
- l'm handing over him to you.
- As you order, my lord.

6
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:11,625
Oh my son!
What am l to do now?

7
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,071
Oh my son!

8
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,237
Hey Chola!

9
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:29,871
Will you dare go against me?
Challenge me?

10
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,916
- Hey Chola!
- Hey Pandia!

11
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:41,493
The people who challenged me
are driven out of my region...

12
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:51,092
Thanjavur 1879 AD
Period of last King of Chola dynasty

13
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,224
Wait till the message comes.

14
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,189
How many years may go past.

15
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,733
The Chola prince who left in exile,

16
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,536
reached an island
after many days of travel,

17
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:12,007
it's still a mystery about what happened
to him and where did he go.

18
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,381
Many Pandian Kings tried
to find the Chola prince.

19
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:22,753
Anyone who attempted was ambushed by
well laid out traps of Cholas on the way.

20
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:29,031
The dream of Pandian kings to wipe out
Cholas and regain the lost Goddess idol,

21
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,169
could never get fulfilled.

22
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,230
Yet, they never gave up
trying for it.

23
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:45,074
They passed the tale about Chola prince and
regaining the idol to next generation.

24
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,484
Many Archeologists tried
to locate his whereabouts.

25
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:58,796
Few returned half way and advised others
not to tread the dangerous path.

26
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,794
Those who went without caring
about it never returned home.

27
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,037
The place where that Chola prince lived
which is the dream of every archeologist,

28
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,405
an archeologist found it facing
umpteen dangers on the way.

29
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,947
Today...
Minghu Ha lsland, near Vietnam...

30
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:56,245


31
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,684
Acclaimed Archeologist missing!
Feared dead!

32
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,372
Sister!

33
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,170
Hi!

34
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,204
I'm Anitha, ArcheoIogy department.

35
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,811
I got the Iast caII from
your father in Vietnam.

36
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,816
He said his team has
reached there safeIy.

37
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,387
After that no information from him.

38
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,391
Had he found the pIace of ChoIas,
it wouId've been a great achievement.

39
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,231
We tried our IeveI best
to find your father.

40
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:23,303
But...on inquiry we came to know the
pIace he went is not easy to Iocate.

41
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,976
I shouIdn't be disturbing you
at this time...

42
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:32,049
but we are sending a team
immediateIy to find your father,

43
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,909
of course this time
with a Iot of protection.

44
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,553
So, with your permission,

45
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,050
can I take aII the papers Ieft
by your father?

46
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,740
One more thing.

47
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,569
Minister made a personaI
request to you.

48
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,679
If you're interested,
you to can join us.

49
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,216
I mean...onIy if you're interested.

50
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,485
You know everything after your father.

51
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,761
It wouId be of great heIp
if you too join us.

52
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,129
Of course, take your time.

53
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,097
Take your time.

54
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,239
We'II be Ieaving in two days.

55
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,536
Okay?

56
00:08:29,742 --> 00:09:02,430


57
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,074
Let me make the introductions.

58
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,008
Mr. Ravi, Dr. Lavanya, ArcheoIogist,

59
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,812
Dr. Ramanathan, NaIini and Sasi,

60
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,180
Dr. Sivaram, Ramesh, Communications.

61
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,517
GentIemen, this is an
Indian Government project,

62
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:24,094
Union Minister Veerapandian took speciaI
interest and arranged everything.

63
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,925
I'm Ieading the team
on behaIf of him.

64
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,364
First thing,

65
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,504
if anything untoward happens to you,
Government is not responsibIe,

66
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,601
Okay?

67
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,533
PIease sign these papers.

68
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,109
You needn't worry,
we have private security force.

69
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,350
Acclaimed Archeologist missing!
Feared dead!

70
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,989
The island Chola prince reached
was Minghu Ha island.

71
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,064
We've travel further deep into it.

72
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,530
lt's very difficult terrain.

73
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,261
There are many lurking dangers,
my father told me.

74
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,236
First we must find him.

75
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,543
We must set up an office
immediateIy in Vietnam.

76
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,149
You stay there onIy,
if I need anything, I'II caII you.

77
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,650
Be carefuI, ask everyone
to be aIert, okay?

78
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,221
We are ready, you said about
30 heIpers, where are they?

79
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,364
They shouId've been here  hours earIier,
don't know what happened, madam?

80
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,901
Move...move...

81
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,271
...is that dark cloud your tresses?

82
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,074
ls my body a playground
for your poetry?

83
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,512
Blue colour...

84
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:57,018
Sky and sea are blue colour...

85
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,455
What's the reason, my dear?.
ls it your eyes?

86
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,461
May I heIp you in scratching?

87
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,032
What a Iousy bunch of heIpers!
A herd of pigs!

88
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,705
If we face any probIem there,
we are not responsibIe.

89
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,930
I'm warning you.

90
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,172
- Why is he saying Iike that?
- Forget it, we'II see Iater.

91
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,648
Load everything,
buggers! RascaIs!

92
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,612
Go..go..go quickIy.

93
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,917
Brother is shouting, go fast,
don't keep the customer waiting.

94
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,593
Trying to tamper it, bIoody!

95
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,597
BIoody, buggers!

97
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,870
Check if rope is correct.

98
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,576
DeIicate things,
handIe with care, boys!

99
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,236
Don't act smart with me, crook,
Ioad it fast, ship is ready to Ieave.

100
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,348
My dear! You're my sweethearts!
You gave Iot of money, my dear.

101
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,147
My sweet IoIIipop!

102
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,347
You're great! Better than him.
Bearded man! Don't shave it off.

103
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,824
Get going...why are you ogIing

104
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,827
That's why I must wear shirt,

105
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,001
Give a IittIe space and you take
too much, come on get going.

106
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,868
If you caII us pigs again,

00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,732

00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,742

110
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,141
Go...

111
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,477
It's women who ruIe everywhere.

112
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,652
GIad meet you.

113

Bevy of girIs are boarding,

115
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,723
Do you know me?
l'm a happy-go-lucky admirer...

116
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,209
Am I shaking or
is the ship shaking?

117
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,356
Is it your room?

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,297
Are you aIone?

119
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,534
May I give you company?

120
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,405
I've decided at first sight,

121
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,939
if I ever marry,
I'II marry onIy you.

122
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,201
May I come in?

123
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,172
Figure good, not decent....
nonsense.

124
00:13:35,714 --> 00:14:14,079


125
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,045
I've decided at first sight,

126
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,951
if I ever marry,
I'II marry onIy you.

127
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,728
ShaII we continue it in your room?

128
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,398
What's the meaning of your smirk?

129
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,794
Is it okay?

130
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,600
Don't worry about safety,
aIways carry condoms with me.

131
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,466
I aIways pIay it safe.

132
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,252
Look down!

133
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:43,168


134
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:49,013
Live free like the bird...

135
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,651
Play like these waves...

136
00:15:53,852 --> 00:16:02,658
Under one sky...on one earth...

137
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,525
Let's sing for our rights...

138
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:14,139
Live free like the bird...

139
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,572
Play like these waves...

140
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:23,180
Under one sky...on one earth...

141
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:28,376
Let's sing for our rights...

142
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:51,236


143
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,213
Air didn't consider as untouchables
because we are slaves...

144
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:02,945
Just because we are slaves,
sea water won't burn us...

145
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,387
Time won't go ahead
leaving us behind...

146
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:12,292
Love and affection
don't desert us...

147
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,730
Under one sky...
on one earth...

148
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,929
Let's sing for our rights...

149
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,178
Live free like the bird...

150
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,612
Play like these waves...

151
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:37,221
Under one sky...
on one earth...

152
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:42,451
Let's sing for our rights...

153
00:17:45,297 --> 00:18:05,310


154
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:10,153
Freedom must be enjoyed
by everyone...

155
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:16,885
l want to see freedom
like temples...

156
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,362
We want freedom to sing and
dance without any fear...

157
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,197
We want a slaveless
world of freedom...

158
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,705
Under one sky...
on one earth...

159
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,108
Let's sing for our rights...

160
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,218
Few weeks later...

161
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,349
Minghu Ha lsland, Vietnam...

162
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,034
Madam, he's our IocaI guide.

163
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,141
Greetings.

164
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,276
- Do you know TamiI?

165
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,015
Give us a sec pIease...

166
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,818
TaIked to many but no one
is ready to come.

167
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,093
Boat wiII not Iand there...

00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,062
TeII me.

169
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,693
They say the isIand is haunted
by ghosts, madam.

170
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,629
It seems nobody has ever
returned from there.

171
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,405
Shut up.

172
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:52,781
Don't worry about the cost,
teII him I need the boat.

173
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,890
Yes madam.

174
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:35,463


175
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,760
What?

176
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,160
They are refusing to go beyond
even for more money.

177
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,305
Boys, take position.

178
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,116
What's there that's scaring
them so much?

179
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,621
Hey!

180
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,457
Can you handIe these boats?

181
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,993
Is there any boat we didn't handIe?

182
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,128
This is nothing for us.

183
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,067
But we'II not do if you ask Iike this.

184
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,034
Ask poIiteIy with a smiIe.

185
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,440
If not Ieave it.
Let's stay here onIy.

186
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:24,378
Farmer is a labourer found
by the industrialist God...

187
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,949
Sir pIease, start the boat, sir.

188
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,491
Am I any officer to caII me as sir?

189
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,261
Ask Iike a girI asking her Iover.

190
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,995
Start the boat, pIease.

191
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,627
HoId on the paddIes.

192
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,738
Row Iike MGR in the fiIm 'Padagotti'.

193
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,771
Get going boys!

194
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,473

195
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:05,222
l'm a slave among the
millions in this country...

196
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,789
Her home is palatial bungalow...

197
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,395
Branch of tree is my nest...

198
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,346
What happened?

199
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,543
Run into sand bed.

200
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,680
Can't go any further,
we have to waIk from here.

201
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,410
Carry aII the boxes,
don't Ieave any box behind.

202
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,022
- Count the boxes.
- Okay. Krishna, check the boxes.

203
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,453
I'II check brother.

204
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,092
Something is licking the feet.

205
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,961
As soon you reach there,
put fire and start cooking.

206
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:53,103
Cook gravy and chutney, l'll come.

207
00:22:55,607 --> 00:23:36,646


208
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:43,878
Run fast!

209
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,922

00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,033
- How many?
- 1 men.

212
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,362
We must be very careful.

213
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,061
Fix positions of the sentries.

214
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,864
- Our boys are fine, right?
- Fine brother.

215
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,635
- Tell everyone to be alert,
unknown territory.- Yes sir.

216
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,335
Order them to fire anything
that attacks us.

217
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,720
Fall in line!

218
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:57,656
Fall in line!

219
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,094
Be carefuI, Iot of Ieeches...

Get going...don't stop
to watch fun...go...

221
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,498
Go in a Iine, you buffaIo.

222
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,794
Why are you caIIing me a buffaIo?

223
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,698
Hey bIack shirt, move fast.

224
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,304
- You Iook new?
- I'm going, ain't I?

225
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,769
What are you appIying on body?

226
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,376
Insect repeIIent.

227
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,109
You need who grow in AC comforts,
it'II never come near me.

228
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,819
Won't she taIk to me?
Why are you staring at me?

229
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,286
Look at her! She looks like
a white sow with a cap.

230
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,243
TeII our boys to Iead,
these guys are useIess.

231
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,415
They are very sIow.

232
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,140
By noon we must reach there.

233
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,959
Guards! Take positions.

234
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,324
Starting point of the path
taken by Chola prince.

235
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,158
We can go in only
after crossing them.

236
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,301
lf we defy them,
they may eat us.

237
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:24,208
Come behind me, but don't look
straight at their faces.

238
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,383
Come...come...

239
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,553
Don't look at their faces,
stay silent whatever they may do.

240
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,989
Bow down your heads.

241
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,185
Come...come...

242
00:26:40,832 --> 00:27:22,872


243
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,135
It seems he has pIenty of such things,
he wants something eIse.

244
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:37,115
It seems he Iikes her very much,
he wants her to marry him.

245
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,733
She's asking, what wiII you do
marrying at this age?

246
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,527
It seems the Professor
is very good man.

247
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,201
She's asking where is he now?

248
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,584
Where is he now?

249
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,321
Where is he now?

250
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,083
Come...

251
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,652
I'm teIIing the same what I toId
the earIier expedition teams,

252
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,050
pIease go back.

253
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,555
This is not ordinary thing
as you think.

254
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,288
Just teII me, what probIems we
may face if we go in?

255
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,696
Look, we beIieve our Gods
are Iiving inside.

256
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,535
Now, it's your wish.

257
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,500
Are you scaring us?

258
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,708
No, I'm warning for your good onIy.

259
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:45,042
Did you see this? Entire viIIage wiII
be wiped out in 5 seconds.

260
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,777
Let me see
your Gods answer to this.

261
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,797
Excuse me...excuse me...

262
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,962
Where are you taking us?

263
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,404
They said about digging a ditch onIy,
never said about the dangers.

264
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,666
Boys are scared, teII me,
where are we heading to?

265
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,676
Are you a girI?

266
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,273
If you're a man,
shut up and foIIow me.

267
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,986
If you're something eIse,
shut your gob and go back.

268
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,715
Girls are braver than men.

269
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,354
Why are you so shell shocked?

270
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:35,522
Girls are decent in appearance only,
their speech stinks worse than Cooum.

271
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,840
Get the ice pack.

272
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,185
You don't eat first, Iet them eat first.

273
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,185
I'm your uncIe, don't scoId me.

274
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,154
- Go!
- I'm Ieaving, do it yourseIf.

275
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,351
Keep that Iight here.

276
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,760
She's asking something.

277
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,173
Go man! I asked you
to serve her onIy.

278
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,244
Give an inch and you'II take a feet.

279
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,991
Hey...she never taIks...
And she taIks too much.

280
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,299
Eat!

281
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,136
Okay.

282
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,016
Hear man!

283
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,346
Protector warrior of the long path...

284
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,218
When the sea splits,
everything will turn red...

285
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:13,386
l'll come angrily, encapsulating...

286
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:45,192


287
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,054
Cease fire!

288
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,459
HoId fire!

289
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,401
HoId fire!

290
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,314
HoId fire!

291
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,593
Fire!

292
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,615
ChoIa fIag!

293
00:36:31,422 --> 00:37:41,520


294
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,321
Don't spare anyone aIive.

295
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,903
I can understand,
it was my mistake, sir.

296
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,542
I under estimated them.

297
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,373
Yes, I can understand, sir.

298
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,377
I'II inform Anitha.

299
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,810
Yes sir...okay sir...

300
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,311
I need 50 more men.

301
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,613
Ex-miIitary, mercenaries,
private goons, I don't mind,

302
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,414
doctors with medicaI suppIies.

303
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,718
Guns, knives, smaII and
medium bombs, rocket Iaunchers,

304
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,088
Apt radio operators,
proper communication...

305
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,832
Are you here on a picnic?

306
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,498
Why didn't you warn about
such peopIe here?

307
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,000
Are you with us to have fun?

308
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:39,941
HeIIo...we are going back,
pay us the baIance.

309
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,991
I asked you so many times about
where you're taking us fearing this.

310
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:52,526
What rights do you've
to get us kiIIed here?

311
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,934
He has three daughters,
they'II ask where is he?

312
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,538
What am I to teII them?

313
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,543
Mani, Raja, Suresh, aII are dead.

314
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,718
Okay, we are Ieaving.

315
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,088
Rest of us must be aIive, right?

316
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,867
Pay for the dead, their famiIies
must survive, mustn't they?

317
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,365
We came trusting you, right?

318
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,630
We are aIready neck deep
in probIems,

319
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,240
go now, we'II settIe things Iater.

320
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,137
Forget about settIe things Iater.

321
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,403
Give cash, we are going back.

322
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,612
Nobody is going from here.

323
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:47,806
Got it?

324
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:48,944
Go!

325
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,123
Look, she's ordering me.

326
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,359
I know who to squeeze out
money from you.

327
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,665
You'II come back to Madras, won't you?

328
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,832
Boys, come.

329
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,935
What a Iousy woman
we are caught up with!

330
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,000
Pack the bodies in coffins,
Iet's go boys.

331
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:42,997


332
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,965
Come on!

333
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,899
MaIathy, Pushpa, Thiagu...

334
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,998
Are the names correct?

335
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,332
Your famiIy.

336
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,338
Right?

337
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:25,280
If you create any probIem here,
they wiII be in troubIe there.

338
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,580
Think about it.

339
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,922
It's paining, bIoody...

340
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,067
Out!

341
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:49,761
All of you go out.

342
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,163
Down your pant.

343
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,967
Down your pant.

344
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,465
I need to give you a shot of injection.

345
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,176
Why? Give it on my hand.

346
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,683
It's powerfuI injection,
you may not be abIe to Iift hand.

347
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,416
Pants down, fast,
I don't have time.

348
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,329
How I inject there?
Down it IittIe further.

349
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:53,865
PIease!

350
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,804
Turn that side.

351
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,382
If I give the shot in wrong pIace,
you'II be in troubIe.

352
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:08,811
Show me.

353
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,954
Didn't see much, right?

354
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:38,143
No cries can bring back the dead,
sIeep peacefuIIy.

355
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:39,647
You'II feeI better.

356
00:43:43,854 --> 00:44:12,878


357
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,980
As search gets deeper...

358
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,714
Heart is celebrating...

359
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,823
lt's you there...

360
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:30,624
Love is stuttering...

361
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:46,646
O Siva! Ash smeared Siva...

362
00:44:47,251 --> 00:45:59,022


363
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,255
You're the leader, chief minister,
playful artiste...

364
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:09,057
Battle hero, young man,
come on dance...

365
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,604
Don't laugh at my get up...

366
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:26,476
Don't rub the wrong side of me...

367
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:31,211
O Siva! Ash smeared Siva...

368
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,153
l'll make...l'll break...

369
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,120
l'll make things like you...

370
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:46,922
l'll produce...l'll give...sacrifice...

371
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,502
One day is just a speck
hidden in me...

372
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:05,046
Kill yourself to seek me...

373
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:47,155


374
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,365
Set up camp here.

375
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,734
Unload things.

376
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,820
Ravi, she says this pIace is
too dangerous, must Ieave at once.

377
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,428
What danger?

378
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,264
My guess is snakes.

379
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,275
Did you come here with us
to teII forest has snakes?

380
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:46,946
What eIse is there?
Lions, Tigers, Monkeys...

381
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,975
I reaIIy got scared.

382
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,183
Go!

383
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:55,383
Says full of snakes,
l'm going to slap her one day.

384
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,193
Where did you find this mad woman?

385
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,561
Hey snake!

386
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,640
Not just one, there are many snakes.

387
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,812
I attacked as group
to scatter an army...

388
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:27,854
Get out!

389
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,192
They teased you.

390
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,269
I didn't Iike it.

391
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,334
You came to heIp me in troubIe.

392
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,868
That's why...

393
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,542
Don't feeI too much, Ieave it.

394
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,409
Sit down.

395
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,760
What are you reading?

396
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,539
Are you searching for peopIe
Iost 00 years ago?

397
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,816
Are we going to dig their pIace?

398
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,379
Okay, but we are aIready
facing so many probIems.

399
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,849
ChoIas didn't go just Iike that,

400
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,463
they Iaid 7 dangerous death traps,
so nobody wouId dare foIIow them.

401
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,922
I mean traps.

402
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:54,734
Sea, forest tribaIs, security huntsmen,
serpents, quicksand, hunger, thirst.

403
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:56,577
And a viIIage.

404
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,174
We've crossed three dangerous traps.

405
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,708
This pIace is fourth trap.

406
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,183
Serpents.

407
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,319
I mean snakes.

408
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:14,992
This oIden text on Ieaf is the
onIy hope of our escape.

409
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,766
It was written by a Pandian chieftain
who went after the ChoIa prince.

410
00:52:22,372 --> 00:53:50,515


411
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:54,490
Take positions...hold fire.

412
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,387
Get down...get down...

413
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,027
Snake...snake...snake...

414
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,206
Leave me!

415
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,649
- Leave me...
- Go...go...go...

416
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:33,523
Run fast! Go...go...go...
jump into the water...

417
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,124
TeII me something
I can understand.

418
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,345
Snakes are better than this.

419
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,780
Oh God!

420
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:50,305


421
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,403
Let's go.

422
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,191
Great figure, right?

423
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,974
- How far have we come?
- l don't know.

424
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:39,413
You warned about serpents,
we didn't Iisten to you.

425
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,651
Sorry.

426
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,095
How to go back to that
far away pIace?

427
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,196
I'm scared about those snakes.

428
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,427
We'II proceed forward?

429
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:55,326
Do you know the way?

430
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,940
HeIIo! Wait!
Why are you deciding yourseIves?

431
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,171
Won't you ask me?

432
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,512
I can't come Ieaving
my peopIe behind.

433
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,587
AIready I'm afraid about their safety.

434
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,024
Let's stay tiII they come here.

435
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,353
We are going, you stay here.

436
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,691
Who asked you to stay?
I'm not taIking to you.

437
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:33,398
Excuse me...pIease don't trust her.

438
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,304
She'II betray you.

439
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,478
She's a cheap woman.

440
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:36,942
Hands off me.

441
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,239
Know your Iimits.

442
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,150
RascaI!

443
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,480
HeIIo, show some respect, if not...

444
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,184
Rotten piece of shit.

445
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,757
You've Iit the fire,
now you'II be happy.

446
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,494
Why are you staring at me?

447
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,968
Showing respect as a woman,
if not I'II thrash you.

448
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:10,770
I'm taking it easy,
if not I'II bIow up your head.

449
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,845
Go...making empty threats.

450
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,886
Come on, fire at me.

451
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,853
- Shut up!
- You don't taIk to me.

452
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,321
Yuck! Shut up, you scumbag.

453
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:26,586
Why are you abusing me in EngIish?

454
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,694
Do you consider yourseIf
to be a beauty?

455
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,866
- If you don't shut up now...
- What wiII you do? Let me see.

456
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,197
Shut up Anitha.

457
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,703
- You shut up, you bitch.
- Who you are caIIing a bitch?

458
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,694
You're the biggest fucking bitch
I've ever seen.

459
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,134
Yeah, right.

460
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,205
AtIeast I'm not romancing
a scumbag here.

461
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,206
Yeah right.

462
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,311
You'd rather Iet him have
a peek at your boobs.

463
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,981
Shut up, you bIoody bitch, otherwise
I'II bIow your fucking brains off.

464
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:51,142
Oh! I'm so scared.
Go ahead, but you can't.

465
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,481
- Because you're a chicken.
- Who you are caIIing a chicken?

466
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,557
You, I'm caIIing you a fucking
chicken. Chicken...chicken...

467
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,728
Why are you both speaking
in EngIish?

468
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,460
You're responsibIe
for aII this, bIoody...

469
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,242
Magazine was fuII, right?

470
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,927
We've Iost many men, sir.
We need more weapons.

471
01:00:38,868 --> 01:01:56,635


472
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:03,679
Not with any bad intention as you think,
you were shivering in coId...

473
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,182
I wanted to cover you...trust me.

474
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,789
Removing pant is wrong
not the shirt.

475
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,592
With good intention onIy...

476
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:31,044
lt'll smell bad, adjust.

477
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,321
You're running high fever.

478
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:54,830
There's onIy one remedy for it,
but don't mistake me if I say...

479
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,401
HoId me tight and sIeep.

480
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,801
Your body wiII warm up
in few minutes.

481
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,180
Think I'm your brother.

482
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:15,519
Not a brother, think I'm your friend.

483
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,657
Listen to me, if you sIeep hoIding
me tight, you'II not feeI coId.

484
01:04:43,112 --> 01:05:11,135


485
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,801
ShaII we go back?

486
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,302
I can't bear this hunger.

487
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:48,071
Hey Iousy girIs! No food or water,
where are you going?

488
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,336
WiII there be any trap here?

489
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,673
What can be here?
Don't think too much. Come!

490
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,189
Leave her...Ieave her,
Iet's get rid of the troubIe.

491
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:51,192
Leave her...Ieave her...go...
go away you gun toting girI!

492
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,528
Leave her...I'm teIIing you,
Ieave her.

493
01:07:54,737 --> 01:08:00,539
HoId her! HoId her! HoId her!

494
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,544
You never Iisten to me.

495
01:08:08,317 --> 01:09:18,415


496
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,956
Is this aIso a trap set up
by the ChoIas?

497
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,289
Very cunning guys!

498
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:38,740
Big rocks turn into small stones
and then disintegrate into sand,

499
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:44,641
The Sun light will show you the path
like Lord Thillai Natarajan...the sun...

500
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,488
Dusk sun...light...

501
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:54,990
Shadow of light...

502
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,319
Shadow of light...
path of Natarajan...

503
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,495
Path of Natarajan...

504
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,095
Ready...get up!

505
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,019
Run...run...

506
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:28,849
Run in the shadow...

507
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,690
Run in the shadow...

508
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:36,128
Fast...fast...
before the shadow vanishes.

509
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:39,194
Run...run...

510
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,477
Light is going away....
fast...fast!

511
01:10:56,285 --> 01:11:03,214
Stop...stop...

512
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,832
What next?

513
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,508
Wait till the sunrise.

514
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:22,966
Come here.

515
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,237
Yeah...one step and we'll meet
sandy death.

516
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,682
Careful.

517
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,512
Take the lights,
be careful and be slow.

518
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,257
Don't come...don't come.

519
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,433
Hey don't come...don't come.

520
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:51,271
Stop...stop...stop!
No..no...no...

521
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:03,445
Ravi, don't come.

522
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:12,117
- How to cross this?
- Wait till sunrise.

523
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,453
You'll see shadow of Lord Natarajan,
run in that shadow.

524
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,587
Don't sIeep, you may get sucked in.

525
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,327
Were you born Iike this or you become
Iike this on fuII and no moon days?

526
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,071
Be free.

527
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,338
Won't your peopIe ask if you
go out dressing so skimpiIy?

528
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:13,013
- I don't have anyone.
- Dead?

529
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,851
No, father is there,
we had a probIem.

530
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,755
I waIked out on him.

531
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,523
What's the probIem?

532
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,191
I feII in Iove with a man.
My father didn't Iike him.

533
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,432
He shouted at me, I Ieft his home.

534
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,440
Are you Iiving with your Iover now?

535
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:42,109
Yuck! He's aIso not a worthy man.
RascaI!

536
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:47,112
He asked me to stop digging and be
just a home maker after marriage.

537
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,724
I Ieft him aIso.

538
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:45,607
Ready...ready..ready...run!
Now...run...run...

539
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,949
Shadow...run in the shadow.

540
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,059
Run...faster...

541
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,659
Run...run...
Come faster!

542
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:57,444
Stop...stop...stop wherever you are.

543
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:58,849
Stop!

544
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,360
What to do now?

545
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,697
Wait tiII evening.

546
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,382
We are on the right track, right?

547
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,152
This is your father's, right?

548
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,395
His handycam, still working.

549
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,835
Did he leave it behind for us?

550
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,974
He must've camped here.

551
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:06,846
He left behind so many things here,
why not leave a chips packet too?

552
01:17:08,857 --> 01:18:50,016


553
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,523
GoId!

554
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,364
- Oh my God!
- ls he the missing Chola prince?

555
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,370
May be. Face is similar
to the painting.

556
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,634
l can't believe this.

557
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:18,543
What?

558
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:24,218
What l can see...

559
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,894
Let me go closer.

560
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,151
What is that?

561
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,299
Oh my God! That's a camel!

562
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,574
l'll eat the whole thing.

563
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,072
l hope you people don't mind.

564
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,677
Go...go...come on...go...

565
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,584
Don't let the camel get away.

566
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,244
Pick up something to kill it.

567
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,422
- Go slow...
- Pick up something sharp to kill.

568
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,749
Don't let the camel get away.

569
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,151
Let's have a meal man.

570
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,263
Turn it...turn it my side.

571
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,600
Neck must be on my side.

572
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:05,323
FinaIIy, we've found the
pIace ChoIas Iived.

573
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,158
Thanks to Lavanya.

574
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,831
We are now going in.

575
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,996
Sukumaran for Sun TV news.

576
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,277
l desire you...

577
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:29,280
Come whatsoever...
Let bygones be bygones...

578
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:31,782
This is a land of dreams...

579
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:37,391
Man of deeds...
Man of challenges...

580
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:42,962
My heart is bouncing
like a kite...

581
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:48,726
Two glass dolls are
dancing in tandem...

582
01:21:51,139 --> 01:22:11,152


583
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,159
l desire you...

584
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:20,164
Come whatsoever...
Let bygones be bygones...

585
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,836
This is a land of dreams...

586
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:28,999
Man of deeds...
Man of challenges...

587
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:45,787
Two maidens before me...
What's wrong if l flirt with them?

588
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,462
This is right question...

589
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,359
You are an energetic macho man...

590
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:57,027
Ships sailing into sea...
lt has hit shore and got stuck...

591
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:02,369
lt'll rain if it hits hills...
At midnoon, it'll turn dark...

592
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:14,045
Friendship and shame
will leave you like dust...

593
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:47,284


594
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:53,193
lt's a locked house...
but many open entrances...

595
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:58,992
Come out of your body
and observe yourself...

596
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:04,763
- My lovely rose...
- Come, let's have it once...

597
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,271
l'm your man...

598
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,273
Come, touch and
lit fire of passion in me...

599
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:15,780
O Siva! Ash smeared Siva...

600
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:21,786
Fire will eat away hearts
like fireflies...

601
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:38,238
My heart is bouncing
like a kite...

602
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,810
Two glass dolls are
dancing in tandem...

603
01:24:44,979 --> 01:25:01,294


604
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,589
What happened?
Why is it dead siIence?

605
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:30,155
I don't know.

606
01:25:34,362 --> 01:29:16,774


607
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,689
l'm Krishnan,
l'm an Archeologist.

608
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,858
l'm an Archeologist...

609
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:28,431
Catch it...catch it...

610
01:32:34,782 --> 01:34:09,934


611
01:36:09,997 --> 01:37:40,143


612
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,597
From generations no change.

613
01:37:54,802 --> 01:37:55,928
No food, no water.

614
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:57,831
What can people do, King?

615
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,932
You live in the comforts
of the palace,

616
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:03,939
has anyone told you
about difficulties we face?

617
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:07,512
No water even to clean
after passing faeces, King.

618
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:12,709
Can't hold on for long,
then don't complain about the stink.

619
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:34,262
Set up a camp, send a team
immediateIy to find those three.

620
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,829
Go, don't stop.

621
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:18,542
l saw tiger mascot on his back.

622
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:21,808
l fear him to be a messenger.

623
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,413
Are you a messenger of Cholas?

624
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:59,244
Why a tiger tattoo on your back?

625
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:04,590
I'm terribIy hungry, man.

626
01:41:07,394 --> 01:41:11,421
I want mashed eggs,
I want biryani.

627
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:18,596
I haven't eaten for 10 days.
My intestines are paining.

628
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:22,935
l want water, l want biryani,
l want chicken piece and beer.

629
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:26,442
AII because of those...

630
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:30,613
No.

631
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:35,784
My mother has toId me not
to abuse women.

632
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:44,620
I wish to tie Anitha and
rape her.

633
01:41:47,835 --> 01:41:52,898
Won't you cry then?
Won't you cry saying you raped me?

634
01:41:57,744 --> 01:42:05,150
Why am l getting bad ideas?
So what if l get it?

635
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:07,479
Sub-conscious thoughts
are coming out.

636
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:12,750
lf Lavanya agrees,
l'll marry her...

637
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:26,163
She'll not agree.
Lousy woman!

638
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:32,675
Is he the messenger?

639
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:36,341
WiII he take us to our motherIand?

640
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,679
WiII it pour down heaviIy?

641
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,122
You've Iost your baIance, Devar.

642
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,456
Without dress...

643
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:59,031
...like power in it,
warmth of humans...

644
01:43:02,409 --> 01:44:30,552


645
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:46,577
Hey Ieave us!
Hey! Who the heII are you?

646
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:51,917
Brother, I'm innocent,
Anitha did everything.

647
01:46:06,927 --> 01:46:08,724
HeIIo! What's happening here?

648
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:13,721
Where are we?
Who are these peopIe?

649
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:16,231
ChoIas!

650
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,738
The ChoIas whom we came
searching here. They are ChoIas.

651
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:27,246
- You said they wouId be dead.
- We thought like that.

652
01:46:27,614 --> 01:46:28,911
But they didn't perish.

653
01:46:29,783 --> 01:46:31,751
They have continued to live here
for generations after generations.

654
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,283
I'm coming from ChoIa kingdom.

655
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:56,628
My name is Nambirattiar.

656
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:07,564
Lord Siva of South of Meru,
Protector of Thanjai,

657
01:49:07,774 --> 01:49:10,902
King of the ChoIa,
Udaiyar Sri Rajendrasena's daughter.

658
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,748
I've taken a vow.

659
01:49:18,318 --> 01:49:25,588
My wish is to make Iove
with King and achieve fame.

660
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:42,933
- Hey! Where are you taking me?
- Leave me...Anitha, no...Ieave me.

661
01:49:52,819 --> 01:50:55,908


662
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,318
How long we have been
waiting for this day?

663
01:51:02,589 --> 01:51:04,386
How many generations we have
been waging this battle?

664
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:06,888
My name is Anitha Pandian.

665
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:11,062
l belong to the royal family.
They are my ancestors.

666
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:14,723
For generation to generation,
we have only one dream,

667
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:18,163
to find the place where the
missing Chola prince lived,

668
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:20,066
and bring back
our family deity's idol.

669
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:23,539
This revenge is fed to us with mother's
milk and is part of our genes.

670
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:27,808
Like Union Minister Veerapandian,
Ex-Major Ravisekharan,

671
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:34,516
eight of us remain in that clan,
our parents raised us as royals.

672
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:36,313
Taught us many arts.

673
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:40,351
Though we live as ordinary citizens,
the revenge hasn't died down.

674
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,259
l didn't expect Cholas who stole
our family deity would be alive.

675
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:50,935
Good, the vow taken by
our ancestors must get fulfilled.

676
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:55,597
l must wipe out the Cholas
who enslaved Pandians.

677
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:59,276
l've only one weapon with me.
My body!

678
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:02,448
My mother has taught me
how to use it to attack.

679
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:09,779
We are well aware of
all your terror acts against us.

680
01:52:56,703 --> 01:53:08,410
ln the golden swing
decorated with romance...

681
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:29,698
Can you sing, Devar?

682
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:35,597
A baIIad, free verse, a poem sung in
praise of hero by 7 different aged women.

683
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,102
AtIeast any one?

684
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:45,949
Okay. Can you atIeast sing medIey
of songs with the Iast word?

685
01:53:49,055 --> 01:54:16,748


686
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:22,553
Where's the land with
dancing pods of paddy?

687
01:54:22,956 --> 01:54:27,655
Where's the court
where my word was rule?

688
01:54:28,127 --> 01:54:33,087
Where's the battlefield
where bow and arrows played?

689
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:37,826
Where's the statue chiseled
out from rocks?

690
01:54:38,037 --> 01:54:47,344
Men without a motherland...

691
01:54:48,481 --> 01:54:57,913
O my supreme lord!
Adorned with moon...

692
01:54:58,124 --> 01:55:12,027
Revenge has brought me here...

693
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:34,653


694
01:55:35,695 --> 01:55:40,723
ln search of land filled
with greenery...

695
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:45,735
Eyes got tired in that
eternal search...

696
01:55:46,205 --> 01:55:51,165
Searching for the eluding
flower of prosperity...

697
01:55:51,411 --> 01:55:56,405
My life has been spent...

698
01:55:56,616 --> 01:56:06,856
ln search of the music of chisels
on rocks ears got melted away...

699
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:17,368
My tongue has lost it's sense
in search of a meal...

700
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:22,598
Kings of Cholas who ruled
with tiger mascot on their flag...

701
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:27,769
Now have to eat rats to survive...

702
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:38,289
Now have to live like plants
surviving on air...

703
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:53,236
Am l a king who rules
over a country of skulls?

704
01:56:56,242 --> 01:57:26,267


705
01:57:27,006 --> 01:57:37,348
How am l to continue?
Praising him to the hilt...

706
01:57:52,031 --> 01:57:53,157
What's the message?

707
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:58,435
Where's the Ietter?

708
01:58:00,206 --> 01:58:02,504
Ordered to be deIivered when aIone.

709
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:15,119
My wish is to make love
with King and achieve fame.

710
01:58:46,853 --> 01:58:47,979
Message?

711
01:58:50,323 --> 01:58:58,059
Let our Iegs entwine,
Iips unite, bodies merge,

712
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:02,901
eyes cIosed, sIeep together,

713
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,668
and I hesitatingIy...

714
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:14,742
Your eyes don't mean it.

715
01:59:15,381 --> 01:59:17,941
Your touch says something different.

716
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:20,979
Your gestures mean something eIse.

717
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:25,420
Your panting chest is not good.

718
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:28,219
Nothing is right with
your womanhood.

719
01:59:31,097 --> 01:59:33,930
I know your cunningness.

720
01:59:34,133 --> 01:59:40,663
Your praise of the enemy
is pure chicanery.

721
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:43,497
TeII me!

722
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:46,006
Cry!

723
02:00:13,472 --> 02:00:15,736
This is not bIood of a ChoIa!

724
02:00:17,176 --> 02:00:23,274
This is bIood of an coward, frightened
and panic stricken wretched man.

725
02:00:25,351 --> 02:00:26,875
Are you a ChoIa?

726
02:00:27,753 --> 02:00:29,914
Is this your ChoIa kingdom?

727
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:39,926
Even the worst of my Thanjavur
dress better than you.

728
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:47,330
Living Iike pigs in sty roIIing over
in your own urine and faeces.

729
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:54,836
Think of my Thanjavur.

730
02:00:55,748 --> 02:01:00,412
If you don't respect,
you'II not get any message.

731
02:01:01,587 --> 02:01:07,685
For what you've been waiting for
1000 years, it'II not happen.

732
02:01:09,562 --> 02:01:12,929
I won't teII the message
even if you torture me.

733
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:17,763
Make Iove with me,
Iet our bIood mix,

734
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:24,267
Iet your shouIder get tired
and take rest on my chest,

735
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:28,541
I'II teII you the message then.

736
02:01:32,718 --> 02:01:34,583
Aren't you a king?

737
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:38,121
Your queens are sIeeping
with you onIy, right?

738
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:46,724
Or eIse are they sIeeping with
other men to satisfy their urges?

739
02:01:51,537 --> 02:05:11,899


740
02:05:19,778 --> 02:05:21,336
You want more?

741
02:05:23,148 --> 02:05:24,342
TeII me the message.

742
02:05:36,562 --> 02:05:37,620
TeII me!

743
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:51,903
Third day from now,
Iet's traveI towards ChoIa kingdom,

744
02:05:52,945 --> 02:05:56,972
you'II be coronated in
ChoIa kingdom.

745
02:05:58,517 --> 02:06:03,545
PeopIe of ChoIa are waiting for you.

746
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:07,214
This is the message
I have brought for you.

747
02:06:09,828 --> 02:06:11,056
Is it enough?

748
02:06:15,267 --> 02:06:16,825
Don't teII Iies!

749
02:06:21,774 --> 02:06:23,036
TeII me the truth!

750
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:26,576
Truth! Trust me.

751
02:06:26,779 --> 02:06:29,077
You'II see ChoIa kingdom
in two weeks.

752
02:06:40,726 --> 02:06:44,594
Men without a motherland...

753
02:06:45,364 --> 02:06:49,994
This is cry of your son...

754
02:06:50,502 --> 02:06:55,633
A King's lament...

755
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:08,984
Where's the land with
dancing pods of paddy?

756
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:14,055
Where's the court
where my word was rule?

757
02:07:14,259 --> 02:07:19,253
Where's the battlefield
where bow and arrows played?

758
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:23,561
Where's the statue chiseled
out from rocks?

759
02:07:23,769 --> 02:07:29,036
Are you the messenger?
Is it reaIIy you?

760
02:07:31,744 --> 02:07:34,577
Messenger will come, get killed,

761
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:36,805
and wipe tears of the destitute,

762
02:07:37,016 --> 02:07:40,611
and it will pour down heavily,
nothing has come true,

763
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,914
are the paintings of
my ancestors lies?

764
02:07:45,157 --> 02:07:48,923
Everything will come true,
shouldn't time be favourable?

765
02:07:49,128 --> 02:07:51,722
Chola kingdom is just
gaining strength.

766
02:07:52,464 --> 02:07:55,092
Trust me.
Your bad days are over.

767
02:07:55,300 --> 02:08:00,169
We have established water houses
and rest homes in the way.

768
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:03,205
No need to worry or fear.

769
02:08:03,409 --> 02:08:05,104
Everything will go on smoothly.

770
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:51,612


771
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:56,155
O King! Why are you hesitating?

772
02:08:56,361 --> 02:08:57,988
Why don't you teII us what you know?

773
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:03,364
We know about the messenger's arrivaI,

774
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:08,029
we have been sitting tight hoIding
our breathe since Iast night.

775
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:11,274
What's the message?
Is it good news?

776
02:09:11,477 --> 02:09:14,640
WiII it end our years of travaiIs
and make our dreams come true?

777
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:17,281
My peopIe!

778
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:28,253
The days of you fearing me
and I fearing you is over.

779
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:43,999
Two days from now we are traveIIing
towards our motherIand.

780
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:08,165
SiIence pIease...siIence!

781
02:10:11,103 --> 02:10:13,469
Are we Ieaving for good?

782
02:10:14,673 --> 02:10:17,699
Has the king become
a groom again?

783
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:22,439
The prediction was messenger
wouId bring rains.

784
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:24,343
But not a drop of rain feII.

785
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:26,643
Is it any bad omen?

786
02:10:31,156 --> 02:10:32,453
My peopIe!

787
02:10:33,759 --> 02:10:35,522
I have hope!

788
02:10:37,229 --> 02:10:40,528
Those who trust me, can join me.

789
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:48,369
If not I'II go aIone and take you aII
after seeing our homeIand.

790
02:10:51,777 --> 02:10:55,406
Don't speak Iike this and
Ieave us to die here,

791
02:10:55,614 --> 02:10:59,277
we've got an opportunity which
was denied to our ancestors,

792
02:10:59,818 --> 02:11:01,308
pIease forgive us,

793
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,387
before you point it to us,
Iet us see Thanjavur,

794
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:09,186
my heart yearns to hug
civiIised peopIe.

795
02:11:10,662 --> 02:11:14,655
ShouIdn't we offer sacrifice
for our safe journey?

796
02:11:26,511 --> 02:11:28,342
I'm ready to offer myseIf, King.

797
02:11:29,548 --> 02:11:33,177
Why? Don't you want to
see your motherIand?

798
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:36,752
I've grown very oId.

799
02:11:36,955 --> 02:11:39,014
I can't even stand on my Iegs.

800

I've to move aII round enjoy feasts.

801

Hey oId man!

Okay! You proceed!

809
02:12:57,002 --> 02:13:00,699
On setting foot in Thanjavur,
spare a second to think about me.

810
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:06,173
O Goddess!
Accept his life as sacrifice.

Don't spare them! Attack them!

What's the name of this battaIion?

856
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:35,262
You never toId me about it.

857
02:44:36,766 --> 02:44:38,165
You thought we'II get scared of it.

858
02:45:04,928 --> 02:45:09,797
Turning into water and
five basic elements as our roots...

859
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:16,633
We'll not leave till our body
disintegrates in earth...

South Thanjavur...
our golden motherland!

02:45:21,912 --> 02:45:28,715
Till we touch our motherland,
we'll not leave this earth...

02:45:28,919 --> 02:45:33,822
Though down and out...

863
02:45:34,024 --> 02:45:40,896
We'll not die till
we die in our motherland...

864
02:45:46,169 --> 02:47:34,337
