1
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,956
My name is Gas-bag.
I release laughing gas

2
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,956
This gas is Nitrous Oxide. It was
discovered by Joseph Eastley in 1752

3
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:07,360
This gas makes weeping faces
laugh and laugh...

4
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,370
till they drop unconscious.
So get ready to laugh

5
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:47,157
My sympathies, man. Every teacher
who comes here, ends up like this

6
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,432
You are the twenty-first one
I,m throwing out. Don,t come back

7
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:05,543
I'Ve heard all that. Just give me
the final report, Murty

8
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,148
Sir, it,s proved that the dam
is cracking up

9
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:13,145
Reason could be water pressure,
or even adulterated cement

10
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:18,556
Can,t say for sure, but unless
the dam is repaired, it will burst

11
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:22,559
More than 80,000 people in
about 300 villages are endangered

12
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:26,561
Has the ministry been informed?
- They faxed. Engineers are coming

13
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,567
When do they arrive? When do they
give a report? When does work start?

14
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,570
No. Our firm does the job.
- Yes, we did build this dam

15
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:35,197
But now it belongs to the government.
It,s their responsibility

16
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:39,610
Also the humanitarian onus, Murty.
It,s a question of 80,000 lives

17
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,164
All right, I,m coming

18
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:05,167
There,s a limit! To everything!
But no limit to your pranks!

19
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:09,200
You have always had your way.
You get whatever you want!

20
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,611
But this doesn,t mean that you
can do whatever you want!

21
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:22,619
I bring you the best of teachers,
and you chase them away on day one!

22
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:26,192
Papa, we,re grown ups now.
We don,t need anyone

23
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:32,626
You do! Listen! I'Ve decided to send
all three of you to boarding school

24
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:45,678
See that V.P. Singh? They'Ve become
so insolent! No one even says sorry!

25
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,281
Off they go to boarding school!
Once they,re away from home...

26
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,447
they will mend their ways.
- Sir, what are you doing?

27
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,586
I,m doing the right thing.
Our indulgence has spoilt them

28
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,516
Don,t forget, sir. Over
something similar...

29
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,189
you once threatened to throw
someone out. And what did it end in?

30
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,635
Raju left home. Till today,
he hasn,t returned

31
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,228
Sir, God forbid...

32
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,275
What,s going on?

33
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:02,688
Don,t disturb us.
- Can,t you see, we,re packing?

34
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,689
Casper, hold your ball

35
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,298
Stop being cross.
Now it happens sometimes

36
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,694
If you guys leave,
how will I live all alone?

37
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,699
You won,t send us to boarding school?
- Not at all

38
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:25,301
You won,t get another teacher?
- Never! No teacher for you!

39
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,748
One who repents is not a sinner

40
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:35,749
Rohit, help me. Rahul,s tongue
is wagging a bit too much

41
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,354
You imp! So what were you saying?

42
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:50,360
Have your laughs, you Satans!
At least admit that you were wrong

43
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,170
Not a nice thing to do, kids

44
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:58,805
Now that we,re friends again,
don,t I deserve something?

45
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,375
No one can ever take us apart

46
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,876
I want no complaints.
Where,s your inhaler?

47
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,986
I don,t know, Papa

48
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:44,990
Where is her spray?

49
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,494
How many times have I told you that
she is susceptible to asthma attacks?

50
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,129
She must always carry her spray.
- Sorry sir, I forgot

51
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,829
Keep this

52
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,435
Uncle... you...?

53
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,868
So how have you been?
- After my sister died...

54
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,446
the way you brought up the children
is exemplary

55
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,879
Bread is meant to be buttered.
Uncle uses it to wax his tongue

56
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:20,481
My nephews are so witty!
- So witty!

57
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,891
So what brings the partners here
so early up?

58
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,940
You are doing millions of people
a good turn by repairing the dam

59
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:42,537
But why? It,s the government,s job.
The dam is built, our job is over

60
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:46,545
Is it our responsibility if the dam
bursts, or even if a few people die?

61
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:50,951
Sure! People die every day! Bhopal or
Orissa what difference does it make?

62
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:55,891
You mean, let the dam go bust?
- That,s not what I mean to say

63
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:01,163
I mean, we shouldn,t block our money.
- No harm thinking it over once again

64
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,903
Our engineers estimate a cost
of 290 million. Large amount

65
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,943
What if I were to foot the entire bill
of 290 million? Not the company

66
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,942
How can that be?
- Maybe you take it otherwise

67
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:19,950
Not at all. You,re thinking
like businessmen. I,m pedestrian

68
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:24,955
Besides, why not pay back a little
to the country where I earned it all?

69
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:33,964
I wish there were more businessmen
like you. We,re with you, Siddhant

70
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,011
Your phone

71
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:55,951
When is she arriving?
My car will pick her up

72
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,559
Who,s arriving, Papa?
- Your governess

73
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,961
But you promised...
- I promised you "no teacher"

74
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,231
I didn,t say "no governess"

75
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,897
Get the car

76
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,064
What,s going to happen now, Rohit?

77
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,006
We,re being cheated.
We,ll change the pitch

78
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:24,014
Now hear this. An elephant and an ant
were taking a ride on a scooter

79
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,016
Suddenly, a truck speeded in from
the opposite direction, and crash!

80
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,022
The scooter and the truck crashed.
Elephant and ant are tossed out!

81
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:37,027
Poor elephant was badly injured.
His head cracked up. He was bleeding

82
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,026
The ant just got up.
Nothing had happened to it

83
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:45,035
Nothing at all?
- Nothing. You know why?

84
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:51,071
I,ll say! The ant was riding pillion.
- Wrong. The ant was driving

85
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,011
Then why wasn,t it hurt?
- It was wearing a helmet

86
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:57,612
The elephant wasn,t

87
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:04,022
It,s very important to wear helmets
while riding a scooter. Else...

88
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:07,024
you might get hurt, whether
you,re an ant or an elephant

89
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:26,076
Why are you weeping?
- Why haven,t I a Mummy and Daddy?

90
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:31,074
Because you,re the most special kid

91
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:39,687
Let me tell you. When God created
this world, He made lots of babies

92
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,092
Lovely little babies!

93
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,694
Then He made people to look after
the babies. Mummies and Papas

94
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:59,076
Among the kids, there were some
who were God,s dearest. Just like you

95
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:08,078
So God decided, "I,ll look after them
Myself. They,re My special babies"

96
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,089
So He called back their
Mummies and their Papas

97
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:20,689
Kids who don,t have Mummies and Papas
are God,s most special babies. Get it?

98
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,100
Aren,t you too one of
God,s special babies?

99
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:30,733
That,s why we live in this orphanage.
So near Mister God! Before Him

100
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,245
Mother is calling you

101
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,162
There,s a very good job for you

102
00:15:56,235 --> 00:16:00,103
But I,m doing this job, teaching
the children in this orphanage

103
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:09,146
Time, tide and life wait for no one.
You too have to move ahead

104
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:13,150
The beautiful world outside
this orphanage, you must see

105
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,152
Not a good thing to do, Mister God!
I was two months old...

106
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,159
when You brought me here. All these
years You kept me with You

107
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:25,162
Why are You sending me away?
- God is never far away from anyone

108
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:31,760
Your friend Mister God is the One who
told me, "Anna must venture forth"

109
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:35,206
"Let her see the world.
Let her make a world for herself',

110
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,209
If my friend Mister God said that,
what can I do?

111
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,219
If you ever want to return,
come directly

112
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,823
This is your friend,s house

113
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,421
So where do I go?

114
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:02,166
Didn,t you say that people go to
The Heavens and become stars?

115
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:09,305
Yes, they become stars.
- Has our Mummy become a star too?

116
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,809
Tell me Papa

117
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:24,489
Look, the brightest star up there
...that,s Mummy

118
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:32,820
Where does Mummy go in daytimes?
Why can,t we see her?

119
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:39,502
In daytimes, she hides in our hearts.
- Can she talk to me?

120
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:43,837
What do you want to talk about?
- I,ll ask her to tell me a story

121
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:48,873
Story? Even I can tell you stories.
Which story do you want to hear?

122
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:53,775
The one that Raju Chacha told you.
- The one about the lion!

123
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:03,226
"Listen to this story
about times long ago..."

124
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:08,800
"I heard this story
from your Raju Chacha"

125
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:15,233
"There was a lion and a lioness.
And they had three cubs"

126
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:19,271
"They were naughty like you. But..."

127
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:23,849
But? What Papa?
- "Everyone loved them"

128
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:34,287
"There was a little house
inside a little cave"

129
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:39,296
"They had no fear,
they had no sorrows"

130
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:47,300
"They were Mummy,s darlings.
They were Daddy,s pets"

131
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,342
"They laughed, they sang,
they were always having fun"

132
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,275
"And they lived together"

133
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,296
What happened Papa? Tell us

134
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,303
"Fate laid a trap"

135
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,341
"There came a hunter"

136
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,349
"The lioness faced him.
The hunter fired his gun"

137
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:37,312
"The lioness was wounded.
She screamed, she writhed"

138
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,958
"Then she lay down"

139
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:50,368
"She never opened her eyes again
She had been shot in the heart"

140
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:01,012
Don,t cry. This is a story

141
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:13,021
"But before dying..."

142
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:20,421
"she spoke her dying words"

143
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:27,004
"My mate, my love..."

144
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:34,074
"love my babies"

145
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:47,492
"Don,t forget, you,re their father.
Be a mother to them too"

146
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,091
Papa, this is just a story!

147
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:58,434
"How can a father ever know
what a Mummy means?"

148
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:03,464
"He didn,t know how Mummy plays
with her babies"

149
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:08,474
"But he learnt how to laugh,
and how to cry"

150
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:13,483
"He learnt how to wake with the cubs,
how to sleep with them"

151
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:22,485
"Time stopped for a while,
and then trudged on slowly"

152
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,098
"The wounded hearts
began healing slowly"

153
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,499
"Daddy taught the cubs how
to take their first steps"

154
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:34,097
"They played on Daddy,s lap
instead of Mummy,s"

155
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:38,143
"Months, seasons, years,
came and went by"

156
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:41,546
"The lion cubs started smiling,
they began singing again"

157
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,546
The rest of the story tomorrow.
Now go to bed

158
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:50,554
No Papa! Please!
- Tell us the story now!

159
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,555
All right. Listen

160
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,099
"Rahul, Rohit and Rani..."

161
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,501
"now listen to the
rest of the story"

162
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:08,529
"The shadow of sorrows were cast
on them again"

163
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,533
"A black lion came by"

164
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,544
"He growled, he roared!"

165
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,553
"As if he was about
to eat up everyone!"

166
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,559
"The cubs were so scared, they ran"

167
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:31,563
"But their father held the ground"

168
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,832
"A fight began"

169
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,570
"The whole forest began trembling"

170
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,473
"The monkeys sat high up on trees"

171
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,843
"The snakes hid in their pits"

172
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,207
"The doves flew away"

173
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,615
"The bear ran up a hill"

174
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,414
"The elephants ran out of fright"

175
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,653
"Our lion had no friends left"

176
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:03,161
"It was a tremendous fight"

177
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:10,167
"The black lion took a beating"

178
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:15,202
"Then all the cubs applauded"

179
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,636
You,re thinking of Mummy, aren,t you?

180
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:58,181
Mummy, yes. And Raju too.
- If you love Raju Chacha so much...

181
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,213
that it moves you to tears,
then why did you hit him?

182
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:08,621
Because he had started smoking.
One can,t forgive a 12-year old...

183
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:16,190
when he starts aping elders.
- Forget it. What use thinking...

184
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:22,271
of the ones who have departed?
- Two kinds of parting, Rohit

185
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:29,679
Ones who leave never to return,
like Mummy. And ones who leave us...

186
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:33,273
with hopes that someday they
will return. Like Raju

187
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:55,272
Everyone all right?

188
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:05,682
Then you hold my cigar.
Hold it for me, son

189
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:12,679
I,m here to collect my pension, and
cigars are expensive. Hold it, son

190
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,622
Why doesn,t anyone understand
when I say it with love?

191
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,631
Manager, step out

192
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,701
Guard, shut the door. Quick!

193
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:34,303
I knew it! The astrologer told me
I,ll die after my wedding!

194
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:40,752
Shut up! My hands shake, my heart
sinks, when I hear someone wailing

195
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,326
Why are you shooting all the time?
I,m just married!

196
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:54,294
I,m drawing money for my honeymoon!
Don,t shoot! I,m like your son!

197
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,659
Tell him! Why don,t you tell him
he,s like your father? Say it!

198
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:02,740
Clam up. Don,t drive me crazy

199
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:11,748
Put the wads in a sturdy bag.
I have to carry it far. Hurry!

200
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:18,751
My father-in-law isn,t rich! I,m poor!
- Shut up! Everyone in the vault

201
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:24,761
Move it. To the vault.
- In the vault? Why?

202
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:27,765
I suffer from asthma!

203
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,766
No!
- Cool down!

204
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:33,804
I have asthma! No!
Let me have my money!

205
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:38,808
God! Do something, please!
- Manager, come here

206
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:43,403
Tell him to stop screaming.
Else, I,ll start killing. Get it?

207
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,801
Why don,t you speak?

208
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:50,473
What was that sound?
- I,m playing video games

209
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:54,813
You don,t recognise gunshots?
- Do you realise the consequences?

210
00:27:55,454 --> 00:28:00,414
What use thinking of outcomes, son?
I,m nearly in my grave

211
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:04,789
There,s only one way out.
You can,t get out

212
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:06,830
You,ll get me out

213
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:11,835
If I don,t get out,
the body-bags will

214
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:15,433
What do you want?
- Security for my old age, son

215
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:19,641
Some money, and say a vehicle.
- What kind of vehicle?

216
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:28,886
A bulletproof jeep. A Harley Davidson
and a military truck. Nothing more

217
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:36,821
You need so many to make a getaway?
- I,m moody! No knowing my mood!

218
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:41,291
If all your demands are met,
will you let the people off?

219
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,938
Of course. I,m a man of my word.
For every demand, I let one off

220
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:52,532
Not one. Ten.
- Who,s demanding, son? You or me?

221
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:57,875
Not ten. I,ll let two out.
- Fine. I,ll talk to the Home Minister

222
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,278
But this will take some time

223
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:12,488
Listen, as soon as my first demand
is met, I will release one of you

224
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:15,456
Say, who goes?
- He!

225
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,213
Your first demand has been met

226
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,616
How many hijackers in there?
- Only one

227
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,011
He,s as good as a hundred
put together!

228
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:14,592
What weapons does he have?
- Lots! Guns! Revolvers! Explosives!

229
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,025
The ones in there are in danger!
Save them!

230
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:28,629
He,s in a state of shock.
- Leave your names and addresses

231
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:34,076
Take him to a doctor right away.
- Yes sir

232
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:48,090
Shekhar! My brother! My friend!
A killing! After so long!

233
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:55,029
Our woes will vanish,
like we vanish from the police!

234
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,035
How much did we take?
- Lots. We could count all night

235
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,662
Let,s read about it tomorrow
in the newspapers

236
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:05,643
It,s been months since I last saw
a large currency note. Show me one!

237
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:08,675
Go on. The bag is with you.
- With me? Where?

238
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,077
I gave you the bag.
- I don,t have it!

239
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:13,081
I gave it to you when
I was removing my make-up

240
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,683
I don,t have the bag!
- I gave it to you!

241
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,687
The bag?
- Yes! The bag!

242
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:21,085
I don,t have it!
- You have it!

243
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:22,090
Where?

244
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,194
No...?
- No!

245
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:27,092
You haven,t?
- No! What are you saying?

246
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,100
Jadu! You screwed up!
After all this effort!

247
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:32,100
Car!

248
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,240
You ruined it!
- You did it!

249
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:40,142
You took me along for nothing!
- It was your idea!

250
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:09,139
What a piece of creation!
- What a body!

251
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:13,142
I can,t take my eyes off her!
- I,d love to watch her in the act!

252
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:18,147
She,d make hearts skip a beat!
- I wish I could have her!

253
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,147
What a smile!
- Does a car smile?

254
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:28,125
I,m talking of the lady in the car.
- Comedy of errors

255
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:33,155
With that car on our hands, we won,t
be paupers for 6 months to come

256
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:38,167
If I get my hands on the lady, it,d
be an end of a lifetime of penury

257
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,795
I,m talking coal.
You,re gunning for mines!

258
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,167
We were supposed to rob a till.
You drag me all the way to a bank!

259
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,209
And then you forget the booty!
Stay within your limits!

260
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,209
There,s a landslide. The road
won,t open up before daybreak

261
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,718
Why are you cross, lady?
So what if the road is closed?

262
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,112
Open up your hearts!

263
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:05,730
We have passion! We have our dreams!
We are young! What more do we want?

264
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,768
Let,s celebrate Valentine,s Day
right here!

265
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:16,763
Come over, ladies! What are you
doing? Let,s have some music!

266
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:21,101
Now watch me work a spell

267
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,593
"Your lips say no,
my lips say yes"

268
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,635
"Yes, these are the signs"

269
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,534
"This is called love"

270
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:10,226
"Haven,t you recognised me?"

271
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:17,234
"My love, I,m no stranger"

272
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:25,274
"I adore your very name"

273
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:30,272
"I,m not mad. I,m madly
in love with you"

274
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:30,339
"You'Ve told me who you are.
But you tell me you aren,t the one"

275
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:41,351
"This is the ring you gave me.
It proves you are wrong"

276
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:38,407
"It wasn,t a thorn taken out"

277
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:43,412
"There was no paper I'Ve lost"

278
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:50,420
"It,s written all over your heart.
You,re mine, I,m yours"

279
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:23,009
Are you still cross with me, Sanjna?
- Who,s Sanjna? I,m Anna

280
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:28,423
How long will you be cross with me?
If my love is true...

281
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:32,428
someday you,ll surely forgive me.
- But I,m not...

282
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,033
You,ll surely forgive me

283
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:44,030
Drop it. Why are you so cross?
Today is Valentine,s Day

284
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:47,071
A day to love, not a day
to slap someone

285
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:54,415
Shekhar is innocent. On his behalf,
I apologise to you

286
00:37:55,453 --> 00:38:03,019
Actually, you resemble his girlfriend.
Poor girl, she,s dead!

287
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:06,428
This hapless fellow isn,t ready
to believe it

288
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:12,432
Everywhere he goes, he,s looking
for his lover. Forgive him

289
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,430
Strike him not, for
he,s madly in love!

290
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,498
And this is is Casper

291
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,591
They,re a bunch of imps!

292
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:13,556
Handling children isn,t tough.
After all, they,re children

293
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,499
I'Ve taken care of forty at a time.
They are only a threesome

294
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,148
Show the lady her room

295
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,519
I am a bit apprehensive.
- Apprehensive?

296
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:48,563
Why?
- The trio seem too well-behaved

297
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,164
That,s a good sign.
- Bad sign

298
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:57,873
A lull in the sea precedes a storm.
- Yes

299
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:01,605
I,m going to the site.
I,ll be back tomorrow

300
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:06,615
Keep an eye on the kids.
Don,t let them rile Anna

301
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:19,997
Storm? Cyclone?

302
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:58,902
Come hither

303
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,368
Be not afraid, Anna

304
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:06,363
She ran!
- She,s gone!

305
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:18,401
Come on kids. How about a hot cuppa?

306
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,474
She has cut my head off!
What next?

307
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,938
What did Gandhiji say?
- Never to lie

308
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,942
What did Lord Buddha say?
- Respect your elders

309
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:38,514
What did Lord Krishna tell Arjun?
- Perform, without expectations

310
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,950
What did Uncle Nehru say?
- Children are divine

311
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:06,537
So you,re back!
- Sanjna, till you forgive me...

312
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:09,546
I,ll keep coming back to you

313
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:14,950
This the only purpose left in my life.
You are my life

314
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:19,552
Why are you after me? I told you.
I,m not Sanjna. I am Anna

315
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:21,554
Your Sanjna...
- No!

316
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:27,530
You have taken another name. Agreed.
You have forgotten me. Conceded

317
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,003
How can you forget your love? How
can you forget the beautiful days?

318
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:40,008
The days when we met. Remember?
The sky was overcast

319
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:46,014
It was drizzling lightly.
I was running after the bus

320
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,017
I tripped and I fell in the muck.

321
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:57,959
I was writhing in pain when I heard
the laughter. Tingling, as if...

322
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:03,965
the wind had struck a guitar chord.
I turned around, and there you stood

323
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:09,004
With a smile in your eyes,
your hair flowing in the wind

324
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,968
I forgot my pain, and I walked up
to you and I said...

325
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:19,582
"lf you keep smiling like that,
I,m willing to trip again and again"

326
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:24,587
You smiled again, and then you tied
your scarf around my ankle

327
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:27,617
Do you remember the days, Sanjna?

328
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,596
Remember this ring? You took it off
your finger, and you put it on mine

329
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:39,034
Have you even forgotten this memento
of our love? Have you broken all ties?

330
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:45,074
Soni embraced me just to make you
feel jealous. And you were so furious

331
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,074
So furious that you slapped me!

332
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:55,015
I kept calling out to you!
But you were in such a rage

333
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:59,589
You wouldn,t even look at me.
You didn,t even see that car!

334
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:03,957
It was hurtling straight down.
Then you and the car... no!

335
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,634
You,re all right!

336
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,034
How did this happen?

337
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,070
Don,t worry! Everything
will be all right

338
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:18,675
God!

339
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,678
Listen...

340
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,080
Stop the car! Please!

341
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:26,683
Help me! Someone help me!

342
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:30,084
Is he mad?
- Somebody! Help me!

343
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:33,690
My Sanjna is injured! I have
to take her to the hospital!

344
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:39,095
Please come with me!
Somebody! Come with me!

345
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,701
Oh, how did all this happen?

346
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,676
But why am I crying?

347
00:48:58,015 --> 00:48:59,676
My Sanjna is right in front of me!

348
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:04,344
God is so kind!

349
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:12,696
He has answered my prayers!
You are safe!

350
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,097
But why be so angry over
something so trivial?

351
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:21,093
You even refuse to recognise me?
Not the right thing to do, Sanjna

352
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:24,139
Yes. Very wrong.
- Wrong thing to do

353
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:26,140
Go to your classes

354
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:46,763
I,ll come again, Sanjna

355
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:58,166
Here you are Inspector. 200,000.
- For two corpses

356
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:02,210
Prince shouldn,t be suspected.
- No one will be suspected, sir

357
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:16,224
Prince, make sure you drive carefully.
You ran over two people

358
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,229
What a waste of money.
- How much have I wasted? 200,000?

359
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:24,231
And you blew up 290 million
on Siddhant Rai,s say-so

360
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:30,829
Use your brains.
I accepted Siddhant Rai,s decision...

361
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,876
because we are the ones responsible
for the cracks in the dam

362
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:37,838
If there,s an enquiry,
we might end up in jail

363
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,883
And we don,t want to go to jail.
- How can we be jailed?

364
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:45,286
We,re only 30 percent partners now

365
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:52,287
If we want 100 percent of his empire,
it will be necessary...

366
00:50:53,263 --> 00:51:00,226
not to offend Mr Siddhant Rai
for some more time to come

367
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:05,273
I don,t understand.
- I won,t explain

368
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,876
Madam, telegram for you

369
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:23,290
She,s leaving!
- She packing!

370
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:40,340
Madam, are you going somewhere?

371
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:49,351
She has to! Her Mummy and Daddy
have met with an accident

372
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:57,291
My parents died 20 years ago

373
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:04,299
If anyone, mourn your mother.
You have hurt her soul deeply

374
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:09,338
She would never have imagined that
those who have lost their mother...

375
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:12,339
could pull a prank over the death
of someone else,s parents

376
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,941
You did this so that
I,d go away, didn,t you?

377
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:24,352
I,d rather work with those kids
at the orphanage

378
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:29,925
They never break anyone,s heart.
Because their hearts are broken

379
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:41,995
I won,t forget this favour. Thanks to
you, I,m going back to my friends

380
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,412
Please get me a car

381
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:56,349
"We,re devils"

382
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:59,353
"But now we,re perplexed"

383
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:06,919
"We bugged you. But you embraced us"

384
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:11,968
"Madam, you win. We lose"

385
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:16,801
"Look, we,re holding our ears"

386
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:23,010
"Forgive us.
Smile, don,t be angry"

387
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:27,015
"Don,t break our little hearts"

388
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:32,015
"Sister, we love you"

389
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:37,020
"You,re like a mother to us"

390
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,076
"Here comes the Queen.
Here comes the King"

391
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,469
"Strike up the fanfare"

392
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:08,078
"Where did the Queen come in from?
How did The King come in?

393
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,478
"There are no doors, no windows"

394
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:18,060
"From somewhere comes the Queen.
From somewhere comes the King"

395
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:22,089
"Strike up the fanfare"

396
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:26,100
"You are the Queen of the palaces.
I am the King of the streets"

397
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:29,538
"Let,s play Kings-and-Queens"

398
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:33,133
Get lost!

399
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:26,560
"Who is the wizard
who works this magic?"

400
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:30,564
"Who makes nature bloom?
Who makes the flowers smile?"

401
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:33,567
"They call it Spring"

402
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:38,605
"Lovers call it love"

403
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:50,612
"New friends, upon new paths.
Come on, let,s all hold hands"

404
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:54,516
"Arm in arm, the flowers will bloom"

405
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:59,160
"When the flower has blossomed,
hearts will meet"

406
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:05,166
"From somewhere comes the Queen.
From somewhere comes the King"

407
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:09,163
"Strike up the fanfare"

408
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:29,617
"A little bird stole a grain"

409
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,627
"Your crow! Don,t you scream!"

410
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:37,632
"Let,s play hide-n-seek
in the cornfield!"

411
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:41,563
"Wait Princess!
Don,t come seeking yet"

412
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:53,681
"I,ll say I love you
You say, I love you"

413
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:57,615
"Let,s go where the
magic of love works"

414
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:08,197
"From somewhere comes the Queen.
From somewhere comes the King"

415
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:11,628
"Strike up the fanfare"

416
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:15,670
"Where did the Queen come in from?
How did The King come in?

417
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:19,673
"There are no doors, no windows"

418
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:43,697
Sir, Murty speaking.
The dam has burst

419
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:03,275
Cheapskates! You call yourself humans?
Is this your ethic?

420
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,685
Look at that footage!
Drown yourselves!

421
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:11,286
Thousands are homeless because of us!
80 corpses have been recovered

422
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,654
There are countless
buried under the debris

423
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:16,299
Thousands of acres of crop
has been destroyed

424
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:20,733
There,s no water, no electricity!
Such is the devastation!

425
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:24,296
And none of you is willing
to accept the responsibility!

426
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:29,743
When the cracks in the dam
were first reported...

427
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,348
why wasn,t action taken
immediately, despite my say-so?

428
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:35,348
Who is responsible for this delay?

429
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:40,751
I have ordered an enquiry, Siddhant.
- I don,t trust you at all

430
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,758
Select your team. If you want,
call in independent engineers

431
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:46,722
I want the report on Sunday

432
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:20,827
Hide me somewhere!

433
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:45,854
Are you here to apologise again?
- Until she forgives me...

434
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:49,890
I will go on asking for pardon.
- Confucius says, ask for God,s mercy

435
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:51,891
You should go for a confession

436
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:53,826
Go and make a confession

437
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:10,871
For all the laws in the world,
why does none apply to love?

438
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:14,881
Why is one punished
more than one,s crime?

439
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:22,890
Sanjna knows how much I love her!
Yet, for something so trivial...

440
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:27,895
Sanjna refuses to recognise me!
I haven,t come to ask for anything

441
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:34,937
I just want to say that unless
Sanjna forgives me today...

442
01:01:35,572 --> 01:01:41,943
I will have to commit a sin.
But this crime I am going to commit

443
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,949
Yes, I am going to commit suicide.
Maybe this is the only way...

444
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:55,456
to prove my innocence,
to immortalise my love

445
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:04,461
Maybe we will never meet again

446
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:27,914
Look! A gift voucher!
- Give it to me!

447
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:30,516
Come on Rani

448
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,008
Thank You, God!

449
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:56,517
You know once every 24 hours,
God grants a wish immediately!

450
01:02:57,987 --> 01:03:02,947
You know what I just asked of God?
"lf there,s an iota of truth...

451
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:09,965
in my love for Sanjna, I should
see her." And here you are!

452
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:12,962
Without you, I,m going to die!

453
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,962
Please forgive me!
Please forgive me Sanjna!

454
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:27,016
Enough! Enough of your madness!

455
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,017
Now,s the time to put an end to this!
- What rot! Are you out of your mind?

456
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:35,022
You'Ve gone out of your mind! You'Ve
every right to torture yourself...

457
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:38,594
even to irk me. You have no right
to harass an innocent girl!

458
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:45,601
Harass? How can I harass my Sanjna?
- Enough! Now accept the truth

459
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:47,036
Accept...?

460
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:52,840
The truth! Know the truth!
- Truth? What truth?

461
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:55,009
That she isn,t...
- Listen, no!

462
01:03:55,145 --> 01:04:00,014
Damn him! How long will he
go on harassing you?

463
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,619
It,s very important that he comes
to terms with the truth!

464
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:10,024
This isn,t your Sanjna. She is Anna!
Sanjna is dead! She,s dead!

465
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:17,999
Jadu! No!
- Yes. She was run over by a car

466
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,073
No!
- I performed her last rites!

467
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,672
This is a lie! A lie!
- True! True! True!

468
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:39,086
No!

469
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,054
Forgive me. I had to tell the truth!

470
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:52,101
Listen, can I be...?
- In the fire of love...

471
01:04:52,235 --> 01:05:02,076
Iovers will burn! He died long ago.
He,s just pulling along. He,ll live

472
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:06,081
Can I do...?
- Go. I,ll take care of him

473
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,684
Come on

474
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:15,657
Thank you very much. Go on.
I,ll take care of him

475
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:20,696
Go on

476
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:28,132
Moron! You hit me so hard!
- I,m a method actor!

477
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:31,707
And I had a score to settle with you.
- You!

478
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,375
Want me to call her back?

479
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:17,709
Welcome lady, welcome! You bring us
such joy! How many I be of service?

480
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:23,149
How is Shekhar?
- True lovers don,t die so easily

481
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:29,163
Majnu, the legendary lover roams
the desert for years, asking for death

482
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:33,167
And where does he die?
At the doorstep of his beloved Laila

483
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:38,204
Where is he?

484
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:44,170
Surely in the boudoir of his dreams,
with Sanjna. Sanjna everywhere

485
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:50,217
Tell me Jadu, where is he?
- If you are so anxious to know...

486
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:57,555
how he pines, I,ll tell you where.
The hapless lover is at Sunset Point

487
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,215
You...?

488
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:32,217
I,m ashamed about yesterday.
Please forgive me

489
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:40,202
I'Ve harassed you a lot.
If you ask me the truth...

490
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:48,835
it isn,t my fault. Nor yours.
God has played a cruel joke on me

491
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:53,777
He takes Sanjna away from me,
and He sends me a look-alike...

492
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:55,775
to make me suffer

493
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:06,159
Sanjna was lucky to have had someone
as madly in love with her as you!

494
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:10,230
Don,t call it love.
Love is too small a word

495
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:23,276
Why doesn,t death erase memories?

496
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:38,251
Can I do anything to help you
to tide over Sanjna?

497
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:55,234
This is my tragedy.
I always lost my loved ones

498
01:08:55,912 --> 01:09:05,844
My mother, my father, my brother,
and even... Sanjna!

499
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:15,857
You,re lucky Shekhar, to have possessed
something you could lose

500
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:22,337
There are those who never
had anything to lose

501
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:29,902
You have seen your parents,
you can dream of them

502
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,308
There are those
who don,t even get dreams

503
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:38,954
Look into my eyes, Shekhar

504
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:45,358
I am afraid... I might
fall in love again

505
01:09:45,995 --> 01:09:48,361
And I haven,t the courage
to suffer again

506
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:54,401
I promise you Shekhar

507
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,407
Never again will you have
a heartbreak

508
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,391
"Promise"

509
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:05,039
"This is my promise of love"

510
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:14,481
"This I promise. Love is my promise"

511
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,488
"Never let the promise be broken"

512
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:27,456
"Let us never part till we live"

513
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:37,497
"Unfaithful is the one
who is vexed with her lover"

514
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:40,542
Say it

515
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:47,506
"This I promise. Love is my promise"

516
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:56,056
"Never let the promise be broken"

517
01:11:57,793 --> 01:12:01,490
"Let us never part till we live"

518
01:12:05,468 --> 01:12:12,533
"Unfaithful is the one...
- Who is vexed with her lover"

519
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:12,562
"We are two, but at heart we,re one
This I know"

520
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:16,603
"I hold you in my eyes"

521
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:24,611
"Let this bond never break
even in death"

522
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:35,582
"Unfaithful is the one...
- Who is vexed with her lover"

523
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,229
Caught you!

524
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:26,634
Who is this?
- Papa, he has just come.

525
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:29,675
So I see. But why is he here?

526
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:33,646
Papa... the tv.
He,s here to fix the tv

527
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:37,684
Which tv needs repair?
- Not the tv. The programme

528
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:45,650
The Cartoon Network isn,t showing
- Sir, BBC! Not I, that is...

529
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:54,668
BBC, NBC, CNN, nothing,s showing, sir!
- I think you,re trying to tell lies

530
01:14:57,306 --> 01:14:58,671
They are lying

531
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,675
The truth is...
- Bye!

532
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:08,279
Wait! If the truth has anything to do
with you, you aren,t going anywhere

533
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:26,659
Sir, this is Shekhar.
We love each other very much

534
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:36,701
Shekhar, what do you do?
- A car broker

535
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:40,747
If someone likes a car, I deliver.
I also help you out with bank loans

536
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:44,753
How much do you make?
- No fixed income, sir

537
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,750
Sometimes, I rake in six figures.
At times, I have even sold my house

538
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:50,449
You love Anna?

539
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:59,700
To get a mate like Anna,
one has to be very lucky

540
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,337
Will you marry her?

541
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,741
I,m free this Sunday! Are you?

542
01:16:08,377 --> 01:16:11,346
Anna, are you free this Sunday?

543
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:22,755
Congratulations!
Congratulations to you too!

544
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:28,729
No time to mourn!
It,s over a month!

545
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:32,367
We came looking for the pot of gold!
Now we,re eating crow!

546
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:40,809
For your kind information, she isn,t
even distantly related to Siddhant Rai

547
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:45,812
She,s a governess to his kids.
Just a maid! You understand?

548
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:55,355
Jadu! I,m getting married!

549
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:59,759
50 samosas.
- Sweet? Potato? Meat?

550
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:03,729
50, stuffed with potatoes.
Pack it nicely

551
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:05,727
Keep this money. I,ll be back

552
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:11,404
This is worth 52,000.
- Nice

553
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:20,815
Keep this 2,000. Send your man with me.
I,ll give him the rest

554
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:25,387
Go with the sahib, and collect 50,000

555
01:17:26,455 --> 01:17:29,822
Is my 50s packet ready?
- Ready

556
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,426
Go, take it

557
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:34,827
Give the packet

558
01:17:35,798 --> 01:17:40,428
Hot samosas. All of 50.
- Samosas? Fifty?

559
01:17:41,003 --> 01:17:45,872
Not samosas! I want 50,000 Rupees!
- Are you doped?

560
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:50,444
You expect 50,000 bucks out of a deal
worth a hundred? Get lost!

561
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:51,646
I,m ruined!

562
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:55,383
Jadu, tomorrow I marry

563
01:17:57,453 --> 01:17:58,818
Why are you laughing?

564
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:06,395
Strange are our laws. Steal and you
are punished. Not for stealing hearts

565
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:09,428
Wreck property and you,re punished.
Not for breaking a confidence

566
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:15,431
The laws need an overhaul, say what?
- What kind of a melodrama is this?

567
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:20,841
Not I. You,re the one who,s playing
with that innocent girl

568
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:24,913
You profess true love?
With a stolen ring?

569
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:27,882
True love? Based on lies?

570
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:32,878
The wedding done, do you know what
will happen once the truth outs?

571
01:18:33,022 --> 01:18:35,889
She,s a proud girl.
She will kill herself

572
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:39,893
After all that wailing over Sanjna,
you,ll end up mourning Anna. For real!

573
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:48,492
Listen, never lie to God.
Never lie to the woman you love

574
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:54,432
If you love her truly, make a clean
breast of it. She will forgive you

575
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:11,459
You? Here? Couldn,t wait it out
for another three hours?

576
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:18,467
I want to talk to Anna. It,s urgent.
- Tell me. I,ll tell her

577
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:21,935
I can,t tell you.
- Then tell us

578
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:26,541
Can,t tell you either.
- How about telling me, Shekhar?

579
01:19:27,576 --> 01:19:34,948
If I could have two minutes
with Anna...

580
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:45,959
Hurry! She,s going to be late
for the wedding!

581
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:57,005
Say it

582
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:08,014
I have something important to tell you.
- Whatever it is, say it in front of us

583
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:12,015
If it,s private,
do it after the wedding

584
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,634
Step back, children

585
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:52,687
Rohit, let,s have a wedding like this
for my doll

586
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:48,883
Stop!

587
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:26,111
You should'Ve understood
why I slapped you

588
01:22:37,099 --> 01:22:41,160
Sir, I want to say something.
- I don,t want to hear anything!

589
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:44,169
For those who need to know,
I,ll do the telling

590
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:53,213
Anna, this man is a liar, a thief,
a conman. Here to deceive us

591
01:22:54,783 --> 01:23:00,153
Even the ring he has given you
is stolen. Yes, or no?

592
01:23:15,637 --> 01:23:20,165
If I,m not wrong, you deceived Anna.
For the sake of my money

593
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:24,778
Because you thought that Anna
is related to me. Right, or wrong?

594
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:37,825
Had you stolen all my money,
I wouldn,t be as hurt...

595
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:43,223
as I am to see this innocent girl
deceived. What did you want to steal?

596
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:49,269
What does this poor girl have?
What she had, fate has already taken

597
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,271
You should be ashamed

598
01:23:53,842 --> 01:24:01,214
Yes sir. Whatever you said is true.
I am a liar. I am a fraud

599
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:05,479
But I am not deceiving Anna.
I love her truly!

600
01:24:07,255 --> 01:24:10,224
From men like you,
not a word can be trusted

601
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:29,277
"You promised..."

602
01:24:30,412 --> 01:24:35,281
"your love was your promise"

603
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:43,854
"False promises"

604
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:52,298
"You swore never to part"

605
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:03,276
"To be vexed with my lover
would be unfaithful of me"

606
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:41,306
I am responsible
for the state Anna is in

607
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:45,950
I should'Ve inquired about
the scoundrel before saying yes

608
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:51,357
Were Destiny in our hands, everyone
would'Ve changed his own fate

609
01:25:51,993 --> 01:25:56,293
May I take Ann Anna away with me
for a while? A change might work

610
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:48,982
What are you doing here on a Sunday?
- We,d like to see the reason...

611
01:26:49,217 --> 01:26:52,812
for the collapse of the dam
cited in your report

612
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:04,326
The cement was adulterated.
And inferior quality of steel

613
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,960
And who is responsible?
- Not to be afraid, Murty

614
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:13,398
Tell us, who,s named in the report?

615
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:18,412
All three of you.
- This gives us a bad name

616
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:30,019
Possibly the names can be changed?
- No. Thousands died because of you

617
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:35,395
You deserve to be punished.
- Will you change it for a million?

618
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:39,431
No.
- Two million?

619
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:43,468
Not at all. Never!

620
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,474
Which leaves only one way
to change your statement

621
01:28:07,062 --> 01:28:09,030
The report has been sent!

622
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:13,429
Call Inspector Saxena.
He,ll take care of the corpse

623
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:16,468
Dial a number

624
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:20,474
Babu

625
01:28:35,123 --> 01:28:37,489
What happened to Rani?
- She,s going to be all right

626
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:45,498
I want to go to Anna
- For something so trivial?

627
01:28:46,134 --> 01:28:47,499
All of us are going to see her!

628
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:50,535
We,re going!

629
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:55,031
This attack was a ruse!
You fooled me!

630
01:28:55,276 --> 01:28:57,073
Even you fooled me!
- They fooled me too!

631
01:28:57,278 --> 01:29:00,076
This joke is no good!
I don,t like this at all!

632
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:03,484
Papa, you promised you,d take us!
- You,re always saying "Sorry Papa"!

633
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:06,087
You always take advantage of me!

634
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:34,639
Job done

635
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,764
Climb out of the car.
One by one

636
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:51,810
Careful

637
01:33:13,134 --> 01:33:14,761
Go on, Rahul.
- No Papa!

638
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:17,802
Rohit, help Rahul up

639
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:19,804
Rahul, give me your hand

640
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:21,408
Careful!

641
01:33:24,612 --> 01:33:25,772
Come on Rani

642
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:29,541
Rani, give me your hand

643
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:43,831
Rahul, Rohit, help Rani up

644
01:33:44,465 --> 01:33:46,433
Don,t be afraid.
Nothing will happen

645
01:33:46,634 --> 01:33:48,465
Come on, Rani

646
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:43,854
Papa, give me your hand!
- Your hand, Papa!

647
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:01,765
Don,t try to climb down!

648
01:35:05,146 --> 01:35:08,877
No Papa! Give me your hand!
- No Rohit! Not for me!

649
01:35:09,517 --> 01:35:15,888
Go back! For Rahul! For Rani!
- Papa! Give me your hand!

650
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:17,519
Go back, Rohit!

651
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:40,905
From now on, you look after
of Rahul and Rani. Take care

652
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:42,944
Come up, Papa!

653
01:35:48,489 --> 01:35:51,720
But who looks after of me?
Come up, Papa!

654
01:35:55,029 --> 01:36:00,934
I,ll look after you.
Just like Mummy. Forever

655
01:36:04,572 --> 01:36:09,942
Rahul and Rani, promise me you,ll
always listen to your big brother

656
01:36:10,578 --> 01:36:11,636
You will, won,t you?

657
01:36:17,585 --> 01:36:20,554
Papa, give us your hand!

658
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,665
BBC! Come fast!

659
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:46,340
Coming!

660
01:37:50,878 --> 01:37:52,345
Here I am!

661
01:37:52,547 --> 01:37:54,447
You,ll be all right

662
01:37:55,983 --> 01:37:57,951
Open your mouth

663
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:16,330
Any news of Anna?
- Nothing

664
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:24,144
Bad news. Siddhant Rai has
died in an accident

665
01:38:27,048 --> 01:38:29,016
Some people are occupying
his house forcibly

666
01:38:29,984 --> 01:38:32,179
The kids are in dire straits

667
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:38,021
Jadu, bail me out quickly

668
01:38:41,562 --> 01:38:42,529
Fine

669
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:47,861
So children, it,s decided that
Rohit goes with Mr Vikram

670
01:38:48,603 --> 01:38:52,039
Rahul goes with Mr Prabhakar
and Rani goes with Prince

671
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:58,174
Till you have become adults,
these people will be your guardians

672
01:38:58,713 --> 01:39:03,514
You have no other close relatives.
- We can take care of ourselves, sir

673
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:08,314
Who are you to decide our futures?
- I,m sorry, son. The law doesn,t...

674
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:11,356
accept what children have to say.
- Nobody can take us apart

675
01:39:11,726 --> 01:39:14,695
Lawyer, just draw up the papers.
Once the magistrate signs it...

676
01:39:15,129 --> 01:39:18,030
no one can change anything.
Not even their father!

677
01:39:18,566 --> 01:39:20,329
As of now, their father
can,t do a thing

678
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:23,070
Let,s hit the bottle!

679
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:30,070
Look at that little devil
staring at us!

680
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:59,439
If your father didn,t teach you
to respect your elders, I,ll teach you

681
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:03,974
Till they learn manners,
no food for the three of them

682
01:40:13,688 --> 01:40:17,124
Don,t worry. I,m with you

683
01:40:18,859 --> 01:40:20,827
From now on, this room is mine

684
01:40:26,367 --> 01:40:28,494
Throw the kids out

685
01:40:45,419 --> 01:40:46,886
Will you please put Anna on the line

686
01:40:47,755 --> 01:40:49,723
Anna, your phone

687
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:56,489
Don,t you call anyone
without permission. Else...

688
01:41:07,074 --> 01:41:10,510
Let the kids be. Where can they go?
We need servants too, don,t we?

689
01:41:30,598 --> 01:41:32,566
Come here

690
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:35,602
Come on

691
01:41:40,808 --> 01:41:44,403
The poor things have been working
so hard. They,re looking so hungry

692
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:47,944
Come, sit
Sit down to eat with us

693
01:41:49,817 --> 01:41:53,617
Don,t be afraid, son. Sit.
- Don,t feel shy

694
01:41:57,258 --> 01:42:00,022
Help yourself. Go on

695
01:42:23,884 --> 01:42:28,412
Anna, come to us as soon as you can.
Ever since Papa died...

696
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:31,080
Grandpa and Uncle have been
torturing us

697
01:42:51,378 --> 01:42:53,505
What happened, Rani?
- What,s happening?

698
01:42:53,714 --> 01:42:54,908
Look at her!
- My God! Attack!

699
01:42:55,082 --> 01:42:57,050
I,ll get the inhaler

700
01:43:00,654 --> 01:43:02,622
Grandpa, Rani...

701
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:06,126
What is it?
- Asthma attack!

702
01:43:13,334 --> 01:43:15,325
So you want this?
- Yes!

703
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:21,902
Drink this

704
01:43:24,879 --> 01:43:27,643
You don,t want this?
You want it? Drink

705
01:43:29,049 --> 01:43:31,017
Drink!

706
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,812
What are you doing, sir? What are
you punishing the children for?

707
01:43:36,056 --> 01:43:39,856
Have pity on them, sir! She,s going
to die! Let her have the inhaler!

708
01:43:40,394 --> 01:43:43,693
Punish me if you want.
But please spare the kids!

709
01:43:43,898 --> 01:43:48,198
You want me to punish you?
- For her sake!

710
01:43:48,936 --> 01:43:51,564
Don,t hit him! Please!

711
01:43:55,142 --> 01:43:58,634
Will you drink? Speak!

712
01:44:01,782 --> 01:44:05,684
Tell me!
- Yes. You,ll give me the inhaler?

713
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,688
Sure. You,ll drink, won,t you?

714
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:17,861
He,s hitting him.
- Drink up. He,ll stop

715
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,791
No...
- No?

716
01:44:24,605 --> 01:44:26,573
You want this?
Drink it

717
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:31,077
Drink... drink

718
01:44:54,935 --> 01:44:57,529
Papa, where are you gone?

719
01:45:00,107 --> 01:45:02,075
Look, what,s going on here!

720
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:07,372
Grandpa gave Rahul a beating.

721
01:45:09,617 --> 01:45:13,383
Aunt made Rohit clean up

722
01:45:13,621 --> 01:45:19,059
And she even kicked poor Casper

723
01:45:20,794 --> 01:45:24,230
Uncle talks of taking
me away to Delhi...

724
01:45:26,967 --> 01:45:29,765
...and sending my brothers
away to Bombay

725
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,604
Duddu is very bad.

726
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:41,106
He went to my room and
he tore up my doll,s dress!

727
01:45:46,687 --> 01:45:48,780
I,m not hungry at all, Papa!

728
01:45:49,857 --> 01:45:54,055
But Rahul, Rohit and Casper
are very hungry!

729
01:45:55,129 --> 01:45:59,725
BBC doesn,t give us anything to eat.
He just sits in his room and cries!

730
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:31,161
I promised to take care of everything!
But I couldn,t do anything!

731
01:46:45,913 --> 01:46:47,881
Hush, Rani!

732
01:46:48,916 --> 01:46:55,947
God! I can,t bear to see
the children in this state!

733
01:47:00,527 --> 01:47:05,123
I wish their father was here.
Or Raju...

734
01:47:33,761 --> 01:47:36,753
This affidavit states that...

735
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:41,560
except for Vikram Sinha, Prabhakar
and Ranjit Kumar, there,s no one...

736
01:47:42,136 --> 01:47:46,232
who is a close relative
of the deceased Siddhant Rai

737
01:47:46,974 --> 01:47:51,274
So my clients have decided to adopt
the orphans, to give them...

738
01:47:51,578 --> 01:47:55,878
a good education, so that once
they have come of age...

739
01:47:56,917 --> 01:48:02,219
they can take care of their
estates and their businesses

740
01:48:02,823 --> 01:48:04,848
The details of the properties
are in this document

741
01:48:09,096 --> 01:48:11,064
Children, come here

742
01:48:17,304 --> 01:48:22,571
Your Daddy was a fine man.
He was a dear friend too

743
01:48:23,477 --> 01:48:27,777
I,m sorry. After his untimely death,
you will now have to live apart

744
01:48:27,981 --> 01:48:30,779
They aren,t going to be apart.
In these times...

745
01:48:31,318 --> 01:48:33,582
Delhi, Mumbai and Shimla
aren,t very distant

746
01:48:34,321 --> 01:48:36,289
I,ll love them even more
than my own Duddu

747
01:50:22,029 --> 01:50:22,996
Who are you, sir?

748
01:50:24,798 --> 01:50:29,098
I hear Siddhant Rai,s estates and
his children are being palmed off

749
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:35,107
So here I am. To ask for my share.
- Share?

750
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:40,602
Who are you?
- Have times changed so much...

751
01:50:41,515 --> 01:50:47,112
that you don,t recognise
your nephew, dear Uncle?

752
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:50,112
Uncle? What do you mean?
- I am Rajit Rai

753
01:50:56,129 --> 01:50:58,757
Alias Raju

754
01:51:03,937 --> 01:51:08,806
What drivel is this? You can,t be Raju.
I know Raju very well

755
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:14,604
You don,t know Raju at all.
Because when I left home...

756
01:51:15,349 --> 01:51:19,115
you were in Shimla. Not here.
- I have seen his photos!

757
01:51:21,188 --> 01:51:24,624
I was 12 when I went away.
Now I,m 30.

758
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,328
You can,t make me out by photos

759
01:51:28,462 --> 01:51:30,453
This must be an impostor!

760
01:51:30,697 --> 01:51:35,498
My wise friend seems to be a lawyer

761
01:51:35,736 --> 01:51:39,866
He should know that
he can be sued...

762
01:51:40,007 --> 01:51:45,001
and sentenced for defamation

763
01:51:45,512 --> 01:51:48,174
Are you a lawyer?
- I nearly became one!

764
01:51:48,582 --> 01:51:53,519
But I can prompt you about the law.
- Let me take of them later

765
01:51:54,521 --> 01:51:58,116
Please sign these papers.
- I don,t think we should act in haste

766
01:51:59,192 --> 01:52:02,992
If this gentleman can prove that
he is Siddhant Rai,s brother...

767
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:07,864
then the partition is unnecessary.
- Can you prove that you,re Raju?

768
01:52:09,236 --> 01:52:11,534
Evidence is what you use
to prove a lie true.

769
01:52:12,572 --> 01:52:14,540
The truth is always evident

770
01:52:16,576 --> 01:52:19,670
You will have to prove
that you are Raju

771
01:52:21,748 --> 01:52:26,515
I cannot. But you can disprove me

772
01:52:30,090 --> 01:52:31,557
I,m coming!

773
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:34,182
I,ll set wheat and chaff apart!

774
01:52:35,095 --> 01:52:38,690
Ask him which vegetables
he liked most!

775
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:46,266
Yes, ask him about the ones
he didn,t like

776
01:52:48,642 --> 01:52:53,238
BBC, are you asking me this?
I,ll tell you

777
01:52:55,749 --> 01:52:57,717
I hate bell plant

778
01:52:58,919 --> 01:53:05,848
I hate potato. I hate ladyfinger,
cauliflower. I hate all vegetables

779
01:53:07,594 --> 01:53:09,562
Except one.
- Which?

780
01:53:14,801 --> 01:53:16,769
Round and small...

781
01:53:19,473 --> 01:53:21,441
little pearl-like things

782
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:26,779
- Peas
- Absolutely correct!

783
01:53:36,656 --> 01:53:40,092
If you are Raju, you surely remember
that once you fell down

784
01:53:41,495 --> 01:53:44,589
You were injured badly.
Where did you fall from?

785
01:53:45,999 --> 01:53:51,665
From a cycle? From a horse?
Down the stairs? Or from a tree?

786
01:53:52,873 --> 01:53:54,773
Step back!

787
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,778
Not cycle, not horse,
not tree, not stairs

788
01:54:03,817 --> 01:54:06,285
I was standing on BBC,s shoulders
and I was showing off a stunt

789
01:54:08,922 --> 01:54:12,619
That,s where I fell from
- He,s absolutely right!

790
01:54:13,326 --> 01:54:16,420
The injury left a mark. Show us

791
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:22,666
What are you staring at? Show us!
- Such times!

792
01:54:23,203 --> 01:54:29,005
The naked truth has to be paraded
in public! Okay, we,ll show you

793
01:54:29,876 --> 01:54:31,844
Show them, Raju.
- Show us!

794
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:39,644
In front of everyone?
- Yes! In front of everyone!

795
01:54:43,723 --> 01:54:50,151
Will you please go inside?
- Why are you shy? I,m your Aunt

796
01:54:50,397 --> 01:54:54,800
What?! Face away!
- Turned around, kids

797
01:54:55,035 --> 01:54:57,503
Striptease isn,t a magic show!

798
01:55:19,392 --> 01:55:21,360
He,s the one!

799
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:35,704
Sorry to be late, kids

800
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:50,754
From what has been heard and seen,
you seem to be Raju

801
01:55:52,459 --> 01:55:58,329
But you must prove it in court.
The hearing will be on the 10th

802
01:56:06,106 --> 01:56:09,701
Raju! You,re back!
Now everything will be all right!

803
01:56:21,454 --> 01:56:25,720
Your melodrama won,t last long.
- 10 days are enough for me

804
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:54,718
You can,t be Raju Chacha!
- You deceived Anna!

805
01:56:55,121 --> 01:56:57,385
Our Raju Chacha can,t be a thief!

806
01:57:04,964 --> 01:57:06,898
True, I,m not your Raju Chacha

807
01:57:10,303 --> 01:57:12,294
I,m not remotely related to you.

808
01:57:15,842 --> 01:57:18,140
But as of now you better
accept a falsehood as true.

809
01:57:19,512 --> 01:57:21,480
Because you have no other way out

810
01:57:22,182 --> 01:57:24,150
If you don,t want to be separated...

811
01:57:25,185 --> 01:57:27,653
if you don,t want them
to grab your money...

812
01:57:29,022 --> 01:57:31,115
you will have to take
a fraud for an uncle

813
01:57:32,525 --> 01:57:34,288
Use a nail to draw a nail

814
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:40,864
What he,s saying is true. With Jadu,s
help, I got him released on bail

815
01:57:41,735 --> 01:57:45,831
I gave him Raju,s secrets. As of now,
he,s the only one who can help us

816
01:57:54,514 --> 01:58:00,453
I didn,t intend to deceive Anna.
I wanted to tell her all about me

817
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:06,488
But I never had a chance

818
01:58:20,673 --> 01:58:24,439
Hey, I,m famished! Come on,
aren,t we hungry children?

819
01:58:24,577 --> 01:58:27,842
They haven,t eaten in days!
Get on with it!

820
01:58:28,081 --> 01:58:33,178
My tummy is aching!

821
01:58:35,922 --> 01:58:40,018
Peas! Cooked the way Raju liked it?
Rather, as I liked it 18 years ago!

822
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,250
Come on, kids!

823
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:06,218
Taste a bit
It,s very tasty

824
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:12,558
You try it

825
01:59:19,265 --> 01:59:20,527
Casper will have it!

826
01:59:25,805 --> 01:59:27,773
Even he won,t eat

827
01:59:30,143 --> 01:59:32,236
If not for my sake,
then for Anna,s sake?

828
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:09,680
What,s going on?
You can,t barge into my bedroom!

829
02:00:10,517 --> 02:00:13,645
I,m throwing out the intruders

830
02:00:15,054 --> 02:00:18,353
What do you mean?
- Why come sneaking in?

831
02:00:18,892 --> 02:00:20,985
Find yourselves a place
you won,t be thrown out of

832
02:00:21,728 --> 02:00:24,993
This is our house!
Who are you to throw us out?

833
02:00:25,164 --> 02:00:29,191
Stop eating so much. You,re bloated.
- At the seams!

834
02:00:29,435 --> 02:00:31,699
About to burst!
- And Mummy can,t even sew you up!

835
02:00:31,871 --> 02:00:34,237
Mummy can,t sew!
What will happen to him?

836
02:00:35,275 --> 02:00:40,076
You hear what rot they,re talking?
- I,ll call the police!

837
02:00:50,189 --> 02:00:55,320
Look pal, with the police, in courts,
you,ll tire yourself out!

838
02:01:00,233 --> 02:01:04,533
This is illegal occupancy!
- It,s illegal

839
02:01:05,104 --> 02:01:06,571
You could do three and a half years

840
02:01:08,107 --> 02:01:13,044
I,ll see you!
- Use mascara

841
02:01:14,113 --> 02:01:16,240
That,ll make you look sharper!

842
02:02:14,674 --> 02:02:16,642
Uncle, please get up

843
02:02:19,345 --> 02:02:21,313
Get up, please

844
02:02:22,015 --> 02:02:23,983
What is the matter?
- Will you please? For a minute

845
02:02:28,021 --> 02:02:29,989
Yes?

846
02:02:30,523 --> 02:02:34,960
Did you take the chair at the head of
the table by mistake? It,s mine now

847
02:02:35,862 --> 02:02:39,093
If you want to eat breakfast,
sit over there

848
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:46,830
You say you,re Raju,
and we agree

849
02:02:49,075 --> 02:02:55,605
You say I,m not Raju? I agree.
But how will you prove it?

850
02:03:03,189 --> 02:03:07,785
We,re enquiring into it.
- Keep enquiring. We,re breakfasting

851
02:03:08,027 --> 02:03:10,120
Will you get up, please?
- How dare you?

852
02:03:20,406 --> 02:03:24,172
If you won,t I,ll have you picked up.
- Move it!

853
02:03:24,343 --> 02:03:27,210
If I touch you, you,re dead!
- You too!

854
02:03:47,166 --> 02:03:50,897
Raju Chacha, over here.
- Let me do this first

855
02:03:51,137 --> 02:03:55,005
Here goes... gone!
- That,s what happens...

856
02:03:55,241 --> 02:03:56,708
when a man does a woman,s job

857
02:04:02,081 --> 02:04:03,048
Yes Raju Chacha

858
02:04:06,586 --> 02:04:10,352
Had Anna been here,
it,d be sewn up in a minute!

859
02:04:15,261 --> 02:04:19,561
Where do I find her?
I don,t even know where she is

860
02:04:20,099 --> 02:04:24,229
I wrote her a letter. If she has
received it, she,ll surely come

861
02:04:56,636 --> 02:04:59,230
I,d never have known had I not
received Rohit,s letter

862
02:05:15,655 --> 02:05:20,922
What are you doing here? Are you
planning to rob the kids now?

863
02:05:22,995 --> 02:05:26,260
I came here to save them
from being robbed

864
02:05:26,666 --> 02:05:29,794
So the thief now plays policeman?

865
02:05:33,206 --> 02:05:36,004
A thief could give up thieving.

866
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:41,312
Who are you fooling, Shekhar?
Me, yourself, or the kids?

867
02:05:43,049 --> 02:05:46,485
You can con the whole world.
Not me.

868
02:05:49,722 --> 02:05:52,691
I'Ve come to know who you are
I know what you are

869
02:05:53,059 --> 02:05:55,459
Don,t scold Raju Chacha

870
02:05:55,828 --> 02:06:00,094
He,s very nice.
- Yes, were it not for Raju Chacha...

871
02:06:00,499 --> 02:06:07,132
Grandpa would'Ve starved us to death!
- So this is your new game?

872
02:06:08,541 --> 02:06:12,341
But you won,t win at this game.
Because I,m here

873
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,178
If you try to hurt these kids...

874
02:06:17,383 --> 02:06:21,319
The accused should be allowed
a hearing before sentencing

875
02:06:22,655 --> 02:06:24,020
You don,t know this man!

876
02:06:25,725 --> 02:06:28,489
After he has won your hearts,
he strikes

877
02:06:47,446 --> 02:06:51,542
Before going to the church,
I came here to tell you the truth

878
02:06:52,451 --> 02:06:54,316
But for a chance...
- I wish to hear nothing

879
02:06:56,389 --> 02:07:00,985
No excuses, no apologies...
- I said I wish to hear nothing

880
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:32,050
What,s this new dish?
- No dish! She,s Anna

881
02:07:32,625 --> 02:07:35,093
The children,s old governess.
She arrived last night

882
02:07:38,464 --> 02:07:41,092
Tonight, she,s coming to me

883
02:07:58,451 --> 02:08:03,047
The next time...
- Speak and I,ll rip your tongue out!

884
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:10,429
Get lost.
My right fist is stronger

885
02:08:13,899 --> 02:08:15,127
Did he say something about Anna?

886
02:08:19,505 --> 02:08:25,808
Leave our uncle to us. He,ll end up...
- Just like Lucifer!

887
02:08:35,187 --> 02:08:39,817
What an ass you are, Prince!

888
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:44,629
Why did you start romancing in public?
You,re no less. You,re handsome!

889
02:08:45,698 --> 02:08:50,658
Inside stuff is, she likes you too.
But she won,t say. Try to understand

890
02:08:51,737 --> 02:08:56,436
Really Rohit?
- Raju Chacha wants to talk to you

891
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:00,108
But he,s a bit shy.
- A bit shy?

892
02:09:02,181 --> 02:09:05,947
Likes me?
- No one else around!

893
02:09:06,185 --> 02:09:09,484
She likes you! You!
She,s crazy about you!

894
02:09:10,856 --> 02:09:12,824
You want to talk?

895
02:09:21,901 --> 02:09:24,870
Hear that? Ringing!
Pick it up! Talk!

896
02:09:30,543 --> 02:09:36,504
Why this distance between us?
Let,s meet downstairs. Say what?

897
02:09:38,584 --> 02:09:40,552
She laughed!
- She,s in!

898
02:10:51,056 --> 02:10:54,583
You,re hiding here? I'Ve been
looking for you all over!

899
02:11:02,535 --> 02:11:05,971
Why do you stay so far away from me?
- Because of him...

900
02:11:06,705 --> 02:11:08,673
Who?
- He

901
02:11:24,056 --> 02:11:29,323
There,s no one here!
Just you and me!

902
02:11:35,434 --> 02:11:40,371
Bastard! Aren,t you ashamed of doing
this with your sister-in-law?

903
02:11:44,777 --> 02:11:48,372
They,ll end up killing each other!

904
02:11:49,448 --> 02:11:53,714
What,s this? Where are you taking me?
- To show you magic

905
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:57,314
Magic?
- I,ll use magic to open the handcuffs

906
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:00,358
Really? Can you do that?
- Just wait and watch

907
02:12:03,862 --> 02:12:08,026
Raju Chacha, we'Ve handcuffed Anna.
Now she can,t run anywhere

908
02:12:08,267 --> 02:12:11,862
You go and talk her up.
We,re taking uncle to the hospital

909
02:12:25,618 --> 02:12:30,885
I have always taken
by force, by deceit

910
02:12:33,425 --> 02:12:37,225
I have never asked.
I never begged

911
02:12:39,798 --> 02:12:44,428
But today, I beg of you.

912
02:12:45,671 --> 02:12:48,435
Please Anna, hear me out for once

913
02:12:50,809 --> 02:12:55,212
After what you did,
I don,t even trust myself

914
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,382
I don,t even know the difference
between truth and falsehood

915
02:13:03,789 --> 02:13:05,882
Give me once chance to prove
that I,m honest

916
02:13:08,093 --> 02:13:10,061
You don,t have a past.
I haven,t either

917
02:13:10,763 --> 02:13:16,463
If you don,t give me a chance, both
of us might stand to lose a tomorrow

918
02:13:32,351 --> 02:13:35,445
"This is what my heart does to me"

919
02:13:36,355 --> 02:13:39,449
"Oh what do I do now?"

920
02:14:08,354 --> 02:14:12,120
"Without you, I can,t live"

921
02:14:12,524 --> 02:14:18,121
"This is what my heart does to me"

922
02:14:18,864 --> 02:14:20,855
"Oh what do I do now?"

923
02:14:31,577 --> 02:14:35,843
"So what if I die?
I,ll give you a bad name"

924
02:14:37,182 --> 02:14:39,844
"They will say that you killed me"

925
02:14:42,254 --> 02:14:47,191
"I'Ve lost my heart to you"

926
02:14:47,926 --> 02:14:49,894
"Oh what do I do now?"

927
02:15:13,419 --> 02:15:15,353
"What if your anger
turns to love?"

928
02:15:15,921 --> 02:15:17,889
"What if my enemies were
to become my friends?"

929
02:15:19,925 --> 02:15:21,893
"I,d give my life for you"

930
02:15:23,929 --> 02:15:27,763
"This is what my heart does to me"

931
02:15:28,267 --> 02:15:30,235
"The match was made lifetimes ago"

932
02:15:30,636 --> 02:15:33,230
"Oh what do I do now?"

933
02:16:25,791 --> 02:16:30,592
No need to get worked up.
Let him do what he,s doing

934
02:16:31,663 --> 02:16:35,121
How long will he go on?
He,s going to be exposed in court

935
02:16:36,535 --> 02:16:39,971
He has no evidence, nor any
witness to prove himself

936
02:16:40,205 --> 02:16:40,603
Forgive me, brother. Had I come
a few days earlier...

937
02:16:44,676 --> 02:16:48,635
had you lived a while longer,
you would'Ve seen...

938
02:16:49,381 --> 02:16:52,976
that your Raju has become
what you wanted him be

939
02:16:53,986 --> 02:16:59,083
That,s why you slapped me.
Give me this chance to atone

940
02:16:59,725 --> 02:17:01,659
Who are you?

941
02:17:26,718 --> 02:17:29,687
You don,t recognise me?
Uncle, I,m Raju

942
02:17:30,222 --> 02:17:34,318
I was in Washington when I read
the news about my brother

943
02:17:36,728 --> 02:17:38,992
How did this happen?

944
02:17:39,898 --> 02:17:42,696
I,m nearly expecting my brother
to walk in any moment to ask me...

945
02:17:42,935 --> 02:17:44,903
where I'Ve been

946
02:17:47,906 --> 02:17:48,895
The kids...

947
02:17:57,849 --> 02:17:59,840
You,re Rani, aren,t you?

948
02:18:01,219 --> 02:18:04,985
You,re Rohit
And you,re Rahul

949
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:07,358
If you are Raju, then who is he?

950
02:18:12,397 --> 02:18:14,388
I don,t understand, Uncle

951
02:18:17,903 --> 02:18:20,371
He too claims that he is Raju

952
02:18:23,108 --> 02:18:25,042
So you are Raju

953
02:18:26,612 --> 02:18:29,080
Rajit Rai. Alias Raju

954
02:18:30,582 --> 02:18:32,573
Then who am I?

955
02:18:34,953 --> 02:18:41,552
For 20 billion, anyone can become Raju.
- So that,s why you,re here?

956
02:18:42,794 --> 02:18:46,890
But I,m not here for the 20 billion.
By the blessings of my brother...

957
02:18:47,032 --> 02:18:50,092
my business turnover exceeds
200 million dollars

958
02:18:51,903 --> 02:18:54,872
It,s the court,s job to decide
who the real Raju is

959
02:18:56,908 --> 02:18:59,035
Day after tomorrow is the hearing
Whatever you have to say...

960
02:18:59,778 --> 02:19:01,370
you can say in court

961
02:19:03,949 --> 02:19:09,216
From the day I left this house, till
this day, my activities are recorded

962
02:19:13,125 --> 02:19:17,221
To become Raju, you will need evidence
of the days before you left this house

963
02:19:18,296 --> 02:19:20,264
That you haven,t

964
02:19:23,802 --> 02:19:27,602
More than evidence, I rely on my
integrity and my brother,s blessings

965
02:19:32,344 --> 02:19:35,108
You recognise me!

966
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:41,319
Can I have peas for lunch?

967
02:19:56,068 --> 02:19:58,332
Of course, sir!

968
02:19:58,904 --> 02:20:02,340
I,d rather that you
introduced yourselves to me

969
02:20:06,244 --> 02:20:10,340
My name is Preeti.
I,m Prabhakar,s second wife

970
02:20:13,885 --> 02:20:19,721
He looks like the real Raju!
- So I think

971
02:20:20,425 --> 02:20:23,519
You thought you,re too smart?
Now it,s all over

972
02:20:24,496 --> 02:20:26,521
You wouldn,t let me a bite. Now
you haven,t any left for yourselves

973
02:20:26,932 --> 02:20:29,560
While we fought over it, someone else
walked away with the cake

974
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:36,237
I called you here
to talk business

975
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:42,406
What,s left to talk of? The kids go
to America. The money goes to a trust

976
02:20:43,315 --> 02:20:45,749
And you end up on the streets.
Makes no difference to me

977
02:20:46,151 --> 02:20:49,587
I,m just a common thief.
I,ll go somewhere else

978
02:20:50,155 --> 02:20:54,683
Think about it! Think of something!
- Between you and me, you fellows...

979
02:20:55,093 --> 02:21:00,531
are the bigger rogues. I,m small fry.
I can,t think that big

980
02:21:01,633 --> 02:21:03,601
Something can be worked out!
- What?

981
02:21:04,236 --> 02:21:07,603
What if we depose that
this one is our nephew?

982
02:21:08,306 --> 02:21:11,901
The court will have to accept it.
There are no witnesses except us

983
02:21:14,146 --> 02:21:18,742
What if you kill me afterwards?
No, thank you

984
02:21:19,317 --> 02:21:21,410
I,m not running the gambit
with my life at stake

985
02:21:21,787 --> 02:21:23,755
We can offer you a share

986
02:21:26,658 --> 02:21:31,595
How much?
- More than what you could'Ve plundered

987
02:21:33,465 --> 02:21:35,490
Ten percent is too less.
The risks are too high

988
02:21:36,034 --> 02:21:38,298
What if I,m caught in the act?

989
02:21:39,538 --> 02:21:42,632
Fifteen.
- One-fourths, at least

990
02:21:43,375 --> 02:21:47,812
5 billion? Lmpossible

991
02:21:50,348 --> 02:21:52,339
Very well. Then I leave

992
02:21:54,452 --> 02:21:55,441
Done

993
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:35,325
I knew it! Scum like you
can never be a gentleman

994
02:22:37,195 --> 02:22:39,993
But I,m not going to let you
or those villains take...

995
02:22:40,365 --> 02:22:42,390
what belongs to those
innocent children

996
02:22:43,568 --> 02:22:45,559
I,m going to the police!

997
02:22:49,107 --> 02:22:52,838
You aren,t going anywhere. I'Ve been
through a lot of trouble...

998
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:59,348
to get at this fortune. No one
stands in my way. Not even you

999
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:08,159
So he,s very intelligent!
- If we depose before the magistrate...

1000
02:23:08,293 --> 02:23:12,662
before the hearing comes up, we can
pre-empt Rajit from going to court

1001
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:18,027
Our Raju will have become
the children,s uncle by then

1002
02:23:18,737 --> 02:23:23,037
All three of you have made sworn
affidavits before me, testifying...

1003
02:23:23,775 --> 02:23:29,543
that Raju is Mr Rajit Rai, the late
Siddhant Rai,s long-lost sibling

1004
02:23:30,015 --> 02:23:32,210
There being no other claimants
before this court...

1005
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:35,715
I accept that you are Rajit Rai.
From this day onwards, you are...

1006
02:23:35,887 --> 02:23:38,879
the heir to Siddhant Rai,s estates,
also the guardian of his children

1007
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:48,929
With water, or...?
- Alcohol is injurious to health

1008
02:23:50,168 --> 02:23:52,136
Pepsi will do

1009
02:23:53,171 --> 02:23:57,039
Congratulations!
Now you are our heir!

1010
02:24:01,112 --> 02:24:04,206
So how and when
do we share the booty?

1011
02:24:04,783 --> 02:24:10,050
Yes, which company do you want?
- Would you like shares? Or cash?

1012
02:24:14,092 --> 02:24:16,720
What are you saying?
- We have to pay you your share

1013
02:24:18,129 --> 02:24:20,962
Share?
What tripe!

1014
02:24:22,167 --> 02:24:27,264
I Rajit Rai, am the sole heir to
the estates of the late Siddhant Rai!

1015
02:24:28,306 --> 02:24:30,274
Where comes the question of sharing?

1016
02:24:46,524 --> 02:24:53,453
Not Shekhar. Raju. All three of you
have sworn in court that I,m Raju

1017
02:24:53,665 --> 02:24:55,633
What impertinence!

1018
02:24:55,834 --> 02:25:02,262
Lmpertinence? You call me impertinent?
You insult me in my own house!

1019
02:25:04,642 --> 02:25:08,942
He,s telling me to get out!
- So this is your plot?

1020
02:25:12,851 --> 02:25:17,117
No plot.
It,s curtains for you.

1021
02:25:18,323 --> 02:25:23,659
What you forget Shekhar,
is one who can make, can also break.

1022
02:25:26,031 --> 02:25:28,022
Empty threats

1023
02:25:28,566 --> 02:25:34,835
Empty threats are bows sans arrows.
Pull all you will, but you can,t shoot

1024
02:25:35,907 --> 02:25:39,673
Now pick up what,s left of your esteem
and get out of here. Else...

1025
02:25:41,413 --> 02:25:45,713
Present your accounts to the office
tomorrow morning

1026
02:25:46,584 --> 02:25:49,178
You fellows have swindled a lot.
I have to collect

1027
02:25:50,555 --> 02:25:53,786
Don,t forget that you are Raju
by dint of our deposition

1028
02:25:54,025 --> 02:26:00,988
Yes, we can say that we erred.
- So you,ll depose in Raju,s favour?

1029
02:26:01,232 --> 02:26:02,529
Yes

1030
02:26:03,401 --> 02:26:05,369
You,ll make him Raju Chacha?
- Yes!

1031
02:26:06,404 --> 02:26:08,497
Get on with it. Here he comes

1032
02:26:15,747 --> 02:26:17,681
Good you,re here!

1033
02:26:17,882 --> 02:26:23,718
This fraud conned us into saying
that he,s Raju!

1034
02:26:24,589 --> 02:26:29,526
You must help us put him in jail!
- You want me to send him to jail?

1035
02:26:29,694 --> 02:26:31,662
Yes.
- Yes?

1036
02:26:37,936 --> 02:26:41,235
Why are you laughing?
- What else? If he goes to jail...

1037
02:26:41,606 --> 02:26:43,904
who gives me my share?
- Your share?

1038
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:51,407
You asses! This isn,t Raju.
He,s an old mate, Gaffoor

1039
02:26:52,317 --> 02:26:55,218
We pulled off many robberies together.
We'Ve even been to jail together

1040
02:26:55,753 --> 02:26:59,553
I called him in so that...
- You fellows would lose nerve...

1041
02:26:59,924 --> 02:27:01,858
and make him Raju Chacha

1042
02:27:05,096 --> 02:27:07,064
Stop!
What,s that?

1043
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,268
Not my brand. Get lost

1044
02:27:14,139 --> 02:27:17,438
Do you mind it, Uncle?

1045
02:27:18,643 --> 02:27:24,240
All your life you swindle Siddhant Rai.
In a trice, I take it all back

1046
02:27:25,150 --> 02:27:30,247
Did you hear the idiom
about one fell stroke?

1047
02:27:42,867 --> 02:27:45,961
Throw these dogs out. Don,t even
leave a trace of how they smelt!

1048
02:28:01,819 --> 02:28:03,787
Not now

1049
02:28:04,656 --> 02:28:07,124
Not the right place.
Not the right time

1050
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,087
Come on.
- Get out!

1051
02:28:22,373 --> 02:28:26,639
Thanks? What for?
I always fancied acting

1052
02:28:27,212 --> 02:28:30,978
But mugging the dialogues I was to
say in front of the portrait was tough

1053
02:28:31,382 --> 02:28:36,820
Honestly, didn,t I put in a good act?
I had everyone in a tizzy!

1054
02:28:37,722 --> 02:28:43,490
Tell me, what do you want?
- I'Ve worked for you for 20 percent

1055
02:28:44,362 --> 02:28:46,830
But I know that your take here
is going to be only good wishes

1056
02:28:47,765 --> 02:28:52,031
Let me have 20 percent of the goodwill.
If the kids wish me well...

1057
02:28:52,937 --> 02:28:55,838
an old sinner will be spared a bit
of embarrassment when he faces Allah

1058
02:28:56,874 --> 02:28:59,968
Call me whenever you need me.
Farewell.

1059
02:29:00,378 --> 02:29:02,346
Farewell

1060
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:54,621
Open the door. Anna, please!

1061
02:30:00,505 --> 02:30:02,473
What happened Raju Chacha?

1062
02:30:03,841 --> 02:30:06,435
Open up Anna. Open up

1063
02:30:10,381 --> 02:30:12,315
What happened?
- She...

1064
02:30:12,517 --> 02:30:14,485
Idea! Let,s make her laugh!

1065
02:31:07,705 --> 02:31:09,696
Forgive me, Shekhar!

1066
02:31:47,478 --> 02:31:54,179
"Yesterday is gone
never to return"

1067
02:31:54,752 --> 02:32:01,521
"Tomorrow isn,t here yet.
We,ll see when it comes"

1068
02:32:21,412 --> 02:32:27,908
"Only today is ours.
The rest, all dreams"

1069
02:32:32,824 --> 02:32:35,793
"The rest, all dreams"

1070
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:58,906
"What,s today,s programme?
- Work? Or a holiday?"

1071
02:32:59,984 --> 02:33:02,248
"Today? There,s work and work to do"

1072
02:33:03,988 --> 02:33:07,287
"You got to go to school.
You have to cook"

1073
02:33:07,658 --> 02:33:11,253
"I have to eat.
- I got to see a movie"

1074
02:33:11,662 --> 02:33:14,654
"No pictures. You,re going to office.
Understand?"

1075
02:33:15,533 --> 02:33:22,132
"Whatever the boss wishes.
I,m just a slave"

1076
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,635
"But if you say yes,
the works are ready!"

1077
02:33:32,216 --> 02:33:35,481
"By the way,
what,s today,s programme?"

1078
02:34:01,879 --> 02:34:05,315
"Where are you headed?
- I,m taking the 7 o,clock train"

1079
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:09,144
"Any letters?
- I'Ve been called back"

1080
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:16,319
"This is a lame excuse.
- Leave me! I have to go"

1081
02:34:17,361 --> 02:34:20,853
"The postman just
delivered a telegram"

1082
02:34:21,432 --> 02:34:24,196
"It,s addressed to someone else!"

1083
02:34:24,602 --> 02:34:26,035
"You imp!"

1084
02:34:51,862 --> 02:34:56,697
"Let,s get out of the house.
- Let,s go for a picnic"

1085
02:34:58,402 --> 02:35:00,370
"Let,s change the mood"

1086
02:35:32,003 --> 02:35:35,302
"True soulmates..."

1087
02:35:36,007 --> 02:35:38,976
"laugh and cry together"

1088
02:35:40,011 --> 02:35:43,447
"In this whole wide world,
what,s most lovable?"

1089
02:35:44,515 --> 02:35:47,279
"Most lovable?"
- "I,m the most lovable!"

1090
02:35:47,585 --> 02:35:54,423
"Among the most lovable things,
the first is love!"

1091
02:35:55,726 --> 02:36:01,926
"The reward for finding love,
is love"

1092
02:36:51,582 --> 02:36:54,949
"By the way,
what,s today,s programme?"

1093
02:37:24,248 --> 02:37:26,182
Name, Shekhar

1094
02:37:26,917 --> 02:37:29,351
First arrested for stealing.
Age eight

1095
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:32,388
18 years in juvenile jail

1096
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:39,359
Here,s your police record.
- So you posed as Raju to loot us?

1097
02:38:43,661 --> 02:38:45,959
You like her, don,t you?
Keep her

1098
02:38:47,631 --> 02:38:53,297
Lawyer, get the magistrate to sign
the adoption papers by tomorrow

1099
02:38:55,806 --> 02:39:00,743
These men are dangerous!
They,ll kill you! Go away!

1100
02:39:02,146 --> 02:39:06,913
No! How can we leave you and Anna?
- Don,t bother about us

1101
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:13,579
No BBC. We,re going together

1102
02:39:38,983 --> 02:39:40,951
Let,s pick up Anna

1103
02:40:47,685 --> 02:40:52,622
Now the fraud is gone!
- Who becomes a billionaire?

1104
02:40:58,062 --> 02:41:00,428
We,ll end up owning 20 billion!

1105
02:41:09,673 --> 02:41:14,610
You don,t deserve
such a lot of money

1106
02:41:16,347 --> 02:41:18,440
I killed Siddhant.

1107
02:41:20,851 --> 02:41:23,615
Where did this new Raju Chacha
transpire out of?

1108
02:41:23,954 --> 02:41:29,620
Not our mistake. Yours. Had you
killed the kids too we wouldn,t...

1109
02:41:29,793 --> 02:41:33,456
be facing this problem today.
- That,s not difficult

1110
02:41:34,398 --> 02:41:38,494
There,s a 2000-foot cliff right behind.
I,ll dispatch them to their father

1111
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:44,007
Always ready to kill? Kill them.
But not now. Get it?

1112
02:42:58,248 --> 02:43:00,512
Did you see that car?
- Which car?

1113
02:43:01,418 --> 02:43:03,181
It was right here!

1114
02:43:14,131 --> 02:43:20,070
You should meet Charles Sobhraj.
- I,m the one who helped him escape

1115
02:43:20,471 --> 02:43:22,405
You helped him?
- What else?

1116
02:43:23,307 --> 02:43:25,275
You know what happened one day?

1117
02:43:28,312 --> 02:43:30,576
Shekhar, you here?
- Trouble

1118
02:43:30,981 --> 02:43:34,075
Anna and the kids are trapped.
- You want to get out?

1119
02:43:34,985 --> 02:43:35,952
Yes

1120
02:43:36,153 --> 02:43:38,951
Come and see what Gaffoor and God
have in store

1121
02:43:41,992 --> 02:43:46,588
So what was I telling you?
- You helped Charles Sobhraj escape

1122
02:43:46,964 --> 02:43:50,627
Yes. One day, there was
a hot altercation

1123
02:43:51,368 --> 02:43:56,897
I say, no one can escape from Tihar.
He says, "I can". So we take bets

1124
02:43:58,142 --> 02:44:00,235
Now suppose I,m standing here
and it,s Charles over there

1125
02:44:01,111 --> 02:44:03,238
Shekhar, stand here.
Come on

1126
02:44:06,483 --> 02:44:08,451
Then you know what he did?
- What?

1127
02:44:08,652 --> 02:44:10,745
He clutched his tummy
and started screaming

1128
02:44:11,321 --> 02:44:14,085
The guard came inside the cell.
Hey guards...

1129
02:44:14,658 --> 02:44:17,422
when Shekhar screams,
the two of you come in

1130
02:44:17,961 --> 02:44:22,455
Shekhar, scream
Go on, scream

1131
02:44:25,202 --> 02:44:26,635
Come in

1132
02:44:27,871 --> 02:44:33,810
I got his plan. So I caught
both the guards like this!

1133
02:44:34,711 --> 02:44:36,303
And I said...
Shekhar run

1134
02:44:37,814 --> 02:44:39,782
Run!

1135
02:44:41,185 --> 02:44:42,482
Run man!

1136
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:56,466
That,s how Charles Sobhraj escaped?
- Moron, that,s how Shekhar escaped

1137
02:45:02,372 --> 02:45:04,340
Where,s the tape?

1138
02:45:05,842 --> 02:45:06,809
Say it!

1139
02:45:08,011 --> 02:45:13,313
He thought he,s the cock of the walk!
- Tell us, son. Else...

1140
02:45:13,450 --> 02:45:16,351
this one-eyed Jack will
give you an eye like his!

1141
02:45:21,058 --> 02:45:23,822
Tell us, son.
- Of course, he,ll tell

1142
02:45:24,561 --> 02:45:26,529
Rohit is a very good boy

1143
02:45:27,764 --> 02:45:29,732
Very good boy

1144
02:45:33,770 --> 02:45:38,707
Rohit, I worked out this lovely game.
Shut you eyes and hit the ball

1145
02:45:38,875 --> 02:45:40,536
Want me to show you?

1146
02:45:41,745 --> 02:45:46,705
Look. Here I take aim,
I shut my eyes, and...

1147
02:45:46,950 --> 02:45:48,713
No! Grandpa! No!

1148
02:46:16,947 --> 02:46:18,881
What,s going on?
Where,s this smoke coming from?

1149
02:46:36,166 --> 02:46:38,134
What,s going on?

1150
02:46:45,175 --> 02:46:46,767
Shut up!

1151
02:47:19,643 --> 02:47:21,611
Raju Chacha!

1152
02:47:22,179 --> 02:47:24,113
Let,s go and get Anna!

1153
02:48:15,532 --> 02:48:16,829
Run!

1154
02:51:04,935 --> 02:51:05,902
Faster!

1155
02:51:07,103 --> 02:51:10,072
Papa didn,t die in an accident.
They killed him

1156
02:51:11,274 --> 02:51:13,071
The proof is in this cassette

1157
02:52:28,852 --> 02:52:33,289
I,m over here!
- Careful!

1158
02:52:56,312 --> 02:52:58,280
Give us your hands

1159
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:04,786
Anna, take the kids away.
- No! We listened to Papa...

1160
02:53:05,021 --> 02:53:08,286
and he left us. We aren,t listening
to you. Give us your hand

1161
02:53:09,492 --> 02:53:10,959
Give me your hand!

1162
02:53:12,529 --> 02:53:14,497
Come on. Give me your hand!

1163
02:54:33,943 --> 02:54:35,934
Bash him up!

1164
02:54:47,624 --> 02:54:51,082
Our horses are eager to teach
these asses a lesson!

1165
02:56:25,221 --> 02:56:26,688
No one comes here

1166
02:58:02,518 --> 02:58:04,042
Give me the videotape

1167
02:58:09,625 --> 02:58:10,557
Give it to me

1168
03:00:56,292 --> 03:01:00,251
Then Shekhar surrendered himself
to the police

1169
03:01:01,264 --> 03:01:05,291
After serving time for six months,
he served an even bigger sentence

1170
03:01:05,635 --> 03:01:10,004
He married Anna. Nowadays
Shekhar and Anna...

1171
03:01:10,506 --> 03:01:15,136
are taking care of Rohit, Rahul
and Rani. And they,re looking...

1172
03:01:15,711 --> 03:01:19,010
for the real Raju Chacha.
If you know anything...

1173
03:01:19,382 --> 03:01:21,816

1174
03:01:22,051 --> 03:01:27,819

1177
03:01:35,097 --> 03:01:37,065
"He,ll tie up the villains"
