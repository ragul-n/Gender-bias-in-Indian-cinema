1
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:44,308
Thank you very much for attending
this meeting at such a short notice.

2
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:49,037
This year, both, our illegal and
legal businesses have been successful.

3
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:58,253
Therefore l was happy...

4
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:00,920
... only till yesterday.

5
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:05,757
y esterday, one of
my ships was seized.

6
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:12,566
And one of us.... is responsible
for it!

7
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,670
He, therefore, has no right
to be amongst us!

8
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,939
- The police have become too alert!
- lnspector Arjun Joglekar...

9
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:26,249
- ...is very smart and brave.
- No!

10
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:30,924
ln fact you are absolutely
useless and foolish!

11
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,256
Look, don't you talk to
me like that!

12
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:48,103
brother! brother!

13
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,737
you have killed my brother!

14
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,917
brother!

15
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:02,580
Don't cry.

16
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:07,492
This is part of our profession.
Don't cry.

17
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,021
Consider me to be
your elder brother.

18
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,436
Who is this Arjun Joglekar?!

19
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:59,977
He often comes to our hotel, sir.
And keeps inquiring from Mona too.

20
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:09,754
Good Lord! How many times have l
told you to knock before coming in.

21
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:16,286
Do you know why my father
named me Goli ' (bullet)?

22
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:23,195
because l reach before
any other bullet.

23
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,332
What was that inspector
asking you?

24
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,444
- y ou are so suspicious.
- What do l do, darling?

25
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,740
As a child l had vitamin pills.

26
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:43,415
Pills to overcome deficiency, but
no pills to overcome suspicion.

27
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:49,752
- What was that inspector asking you?
- oh, nothing!

28
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:55,427
After the dance, some people were
misbehaving with me...

29
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,229
... so he set them right.
And yes...

30
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,602
...he told me that l can call him
whenever l need his help.

31
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:14,049
Here's what you will do, darling.
Call him over tonight.

32
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,351
And give this small gift
on my behalf.

33
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:33,696
Happy birthday, brother Arjun!

34
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:37,803
Come on, out with the money.

35
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,402
- What for?
- Do as l say!

36
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,076
- How much do you want?
- Give me.

37
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:49,284
Strange! My birthday,
and l've got to pay up!

38
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,222
Chutki, what will you
do with all this money?

39
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,593
y es! Tell me?

40
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,959
l'll get a gift for him.

41
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:04,003
Meaning, you'll buy a gift
for me, with my own money?

42
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:07,330
What has the world come to!

43
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:12,905
How much is it?

44
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,686
- brother, this is Karan here.
- oh, Karan!

45
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,753
- Congratulations to you too.
- lt's brother Karan!

46
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:33,093
How forgetful l am. What happened
about that investigation?

47
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:37,328
okay, first talk to Chutki.

48
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,637
Hi, brother Karan!

49
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,172
How are you, Shivangi?
- l'm fine!

50
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:43,237
but you were supposed to
be back in two days?

51
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,909
There's a lot of work.
l'm coming tomorrow.

52
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,611
Really? See you tomorrow.

53
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:54,581
Karan, let me give you
another good news.

54
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,581
y ou're soon getting a promotion.

55
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:02,524
From inspector Karan, you will
become uncle Karan.

56
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,925
- Sister-in-law?!
- y es.

57
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:13,663
- This calls for a grand party!
- Come over first.

58
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:18,701
We'll celebrate in such a way that
it'll be a memorable event.

59
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:26,911
So let's cut the cake.

60
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,150
- l'll eat Karan's share too.
- Eat my share too.

61
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,740
This is Mona here, lnspector.

62
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,178
y es, what is it?

63
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:02,713
Come over. l want to
tell you something.

64
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:07,317
Perhaps my life is in danger.

65
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:11,229
Look, don't you worry.
l'll be right there.

66
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:19,063
The door is open, inspector.
Please come in.

67
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:24,332
Come in.

68
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:32,911
y ou sounded scared on the phone.
y ou said your life is in danger.

69
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:36,248
- but you are...
- Right now it isn't....

70
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:40,157
...but if you don't support us...

71
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:45,962
- lt could be.
- Meaning?

72
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,029
l mean this bag.

73
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:54,665
- What does it contain?
- See for yourself.

74
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:10,986
What's this?

75
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,462
This is small gift on behalf of
my master. Please accept it.

76
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:24,427
lf l want, l can arrest you
for bribing a police officer.

77
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:32,907
but then, l think you're a
spoilt brat from a rich family.

78
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:40,744
And yes. Convey my message
to your lover and master.

79
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,518
Soon, he will be behind bars.

80
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,510
What... what have you done?!
y ou've killed him?!

81
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:17,284
Why did you do this?!
And you didn't even tell me...

82
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:20,750
...that you'd kill him
if he didn't accept the bribe?!

83
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:29,033
lt's the rule of our profession.

84
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:36,204
Kill the one who does not
acquiesce to our demands.

85
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:40,544
because l don't have time to
talk to him.

86
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,543
Put this bundle of note
in his pocket.

87
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:52,750
So that he is accused of
taking bribes.

88
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:06,832
Come soon. We'll celebrate in such a
way that it'll be a memorable event.

89
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:44,976
l know nothing! l'm only a
dancer in hotel Moonlight!

90
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,606
And from the past two days,
l haven't been home either!

91
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,674
Please believe me.

92
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:57,650
y ou know nothing?
Nothing?

93
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,890
Why were you leaving
the country that night?

94
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:02,653
l don't know.

95
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:05,560
We caught you at the airport.

96
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,226
y et you know nothing.
y ou are lying!

97
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,274
Do you realize what you have done?
y ou are responsible for three deaths!

98
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,343
y ou want to see?!
Do you?!

99
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,006
Come on!

100
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:27,084
- Leave me!
- This is my sister-in-law!

101
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:32,751
She is now a widow
because of you!

102
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:39,195
The child in her womb will be
called an orphan before he's born!

103
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:44,091
He became an orphan only
because of you!

104
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,336
This....this....

105
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:52,502
...this innocent sister of mine.

106
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,606
lt was her brother's
birthday yesterday!

107
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:02,246
And today he is no more.

108
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,388
And you are responsible for it!

109
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,525
Arjun Joglekar was a symbol
of righteousness and integrity!

110
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,662
Who sacrificed his life for
his duties.

111
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:18,366
And whom the entire department
should have been proud of!

112
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:23,337
but today, they abhor the very
mention of his name. y ou know why?

113
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:30,005
on account of your people, he was
accused of taking bribe!

114
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:33,444
And you are responsible for it!

115
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:37,220
- No!
- y es, only because of you.

116
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,386
Stop it!

117
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:47,961
l didn't kill your brother!

118
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:51,198
And neither have l made your
sister-in-law a widow!

119
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,135
And neither have l ruined your
sister's happiness!

120
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:58,710
Then who is it?
Who is responsible for it?!

121
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:08,416
y ou want to know who killed
your brother and why?

122
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,286
l'll tell you everything.

123
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,859
y ou very well know.

124
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:22,932
Relations, love and sentiments...
have no meaning in our profession.

125
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,302
Even if it is Mona for that matter.

126
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,302
What happened?
What are you thinking about?

127
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:37,814
Scared?

128
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,176
No.

129
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:43,977
What should l be scared of?

130
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,460
l was thinking about your brother.

131
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,426
What a noble and decent
human being he was.

132
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,434
y ou know, one day, he told me
to leave Goli and his accomplice.

133
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:13,077
Had l listened to him... all
this wouldn't have happened.

134
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,349
He was right.

135
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,954
Perhaps that's how the world is.

136
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:28,628
Honest people are always
done to death.

137
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,312
They are here, Karan!

138
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:57,688
Run, Mona! Faster!

139
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,633
Faster, Mona!

140
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:15,069
l can't run.
My skirt!

141
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:39,623
Get in.

142
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,356
No!

143
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,575
Sir, l want an arrest warrant
against Goli and his gang.

144
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:47,258
- What for?
- What for?!

145
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:52,289
He killed my brother!
Killed Mona!

146
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,091
And you still ask me what for?

147
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:59,503
What evidence do you have that he
is behind all these killings?

148
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:03,005
- Strange, my sir....
- Ramlal, will you shut up?!

149
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:06,110
- Ramlal, wait.
- He's shouting at me.

150
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:08,268
Sir, will you give me the
arrest warrant or not?

151
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,340
Don't be childish.

152
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:13,910
The ones you want to arrest are
no ordinary people.

153
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:15,977
They have lawyers and barristers!

154
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:20,416
And won't the judge ask me for
what crime l want to arrest them?

155
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:22,623
- y ou won't give the arrest warrant?
- No way!

156
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,393
- Sure?!
- Positive!

157
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,794
- Here's my resignation then.
- And mine too.

158
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:33,894
- Here it is.
- Mine too.

159
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:36,339
Just a minute.

160
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:40,708
- What is it, sir?
- Why do you always do this?

161
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:44,174
lf l don't do as you say,
you submit your resignation!

162
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:45,507
y ou do such a thing.

163
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:50,345
Why should l? This is your house,
not your police station.

164
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,452
Neither are you a D.C.P nor am l a
constable. l'm your elder brother.

165
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:58,087
l'm ten minutes elder to you.
How many minutes?

166
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:01,963
Answer me.

167
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,934
What do l do with him?

168
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:11,900
Look, Karan. Getting involved with
such criminals is like...

169
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:14,035
...walking straight
into a lion's lair.

170
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,573
lf you want to defeat them,
then there is only one way.

171
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:24,416
Don't let your heart rule your mind.
Certainly, victory will be yours.

172
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,334
Didn't l tell you, Mohini?!

173
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:53,735
lf you meet this boy again,
l won't spare him!

174
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:59,414
- He is my biggest foe!
- but he is my love, my life!

175
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:03,011
before killing him,
you have to kill me, daddy!

176
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:09,989
l had sworn not to spare him!
And now...

177
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:13,421
No!

178
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:25,969
What have you done, Mohini?

179
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:30,438
Sacrificed your life for my sake?!
No, Mohini!

180
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:38,013
y ou can't die! We have sworn
to live and die together!

181
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:07,676
l'm coming with you, Mohini!
Wait for me!

182
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:36,079
Wow, Deepak.
What a performance!

183
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:45,281
Marvelous!

184
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,423
- Mr. Director! What a film!
- y ou are great!

185
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,760
Deepak, the shooting begins
in half an hour.

186
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,055
l don't want to shoot!

187
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:57,324
- l'm going home!
- This is Damodar bhai's film!

188
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,905
l don't care!
l'm going home!

189
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:07,370
- Damodar bhai will be very angry.
- Wonder what he will do?

190
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,219
- y es, Rosy.
- This is Damodar here.

191
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:20,021
Damodar bhai!
That's what l'm saying.

192
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:23,083
Never leave anything incomplete.
lt's wrong.

193
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:33,571
bhai, these artists are very moody.

194
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:39,542
Don't talk about killing him.
He is your boy.

195
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:42,972
lt's our home production.
our film should be complete.

196
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:46,283
l told him.
l'll send him.

197
00:32:47,518 --> 00:32:49,076
He is on his way.
He's at the door.

198
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:57,818
This is the 5th call since morning.
...y ou walked out of the shoot?!

199
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,927
That too, from a
Damodar bhai film?

200
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:03,224
He's a butcher!
He'll kidnap you! And me.

201
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:06,498
The name is Damodar.
He is a demon.

202
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:10,398
y ou'll have to pay and you'll be
on the streets too. Sorry, l...

203
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:12,901
y ou are my brother! My father!

204
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,804
Never leave your work incomplete.

205
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,844
l don't want to work in this film!

206
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,916
ls this a film?
lt's crap!

207
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:27,649
y ou've reached this position
only because of such films.

208
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,793
- but this position bites me!
- Now they will bite me!

209
00:33:32,363 --> 00:33:35,662
A dog bite can be cured with
injections. but this is Damodar.

210
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,097
l'll need 120 injections
if he bites me!

211
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:43,536
lf he is Damodar,
l'm Deepak Kumar.

212
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:46,205
Get a nice role for me.

213
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:48,479
Roles which Shahrukh,
Jackie and Sanjay do!

214
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:53,644
They have learned acting,
but you are God gifted.

215
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:57,580
- y ou don't know what you are.
- l know everything, Dhansukh.

216
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:02,292
Call the press. And tell them
that Deepak Kumar is retiring.

217
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:11,224
y ou are retiring from your work!
They will retire me from life.

218
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:18,406
Another block buster of superstar
Deepak Kumar...

219
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:26,814
Reaching the pinnacle of success!
The heartthrob of millions!

220
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:36,958
Deepak, l'm shutting it down.

221
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:40,629
Just one minute.
lt'll stop on it's own.

222
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:44,327
Have patience, Deepak.
No, Deepak.

223
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:27,377
Deepak Kumar! y ou good for nothing
actor...get down from there!

224
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,443
Look look!
That's the same hero!

225
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,215
What's his name?
our hero, Deepak Kumar!

226
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:35,885
So your not coming down?

227
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:37,951
Not coming down?
y ou....

228
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:41,921
Hey Deepak, what's happened to you?

229
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,057
Why are you yelling at that poster?

230
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:46,327
Why?

231
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:47,853
l'll tell you why.

232
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,324
l'll tell you all!

233
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:55,439
Listen...

234
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,034
My beloved fans...

235
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:03,575
y ou all came to see my picture...

236
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,875
...your Deepak Kumar...

237
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:09,411
Time and time again....l have to
do the same acting.

238
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:12,213
Have to work in the same
style of films.

239
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,287
What?...Do you...

240
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:16,988
do you approve of them?

241
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:19,560
Do you think people go
and watch just acting?

242
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:22,389
Songs make the money worthwhile.

243
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:23,691
but for how long?

244
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,226
How long will you watch just
songs and dance?

245
00:36:26,637 --> 00:36:28,332
How long for this nonsense?

246
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,368
Don't you people want me to do
a good role like a man?

247
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:36,378
Hey Raja.....not a man!

248
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,481
y our a young man!

249
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,448
Act like a young man!

250
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:43,449
but l want to change my style.

251
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,652
l want to do new scenes...

252
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,691
....new dialogues...

253
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:51,859
...and this guy wants me to act
like a young man?

254
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:55,156
Listen...

255
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:56,863
....my public...

256
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,965
...my friends...

257
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:03,029
...l am about to bring about
a whole new way of doing things.

258
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,840
And when l do, it will
blow you away.

259
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,051
Hey Mister, what's happening?

260
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,919
What do you think your doing?
Gathering up the public?

261
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:22,154
l talk nonsense in my films,
here l am talking sense!

262
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,486
Talk sense later!

263
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:27,926
Drinking, bothering the public,
no hero has a license for this!

264
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:31,668
And listen, you've been driving
under the influence.

265
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,436
Where's your license?
Get it out!

266
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:37,799
-y ou're asking me for my license?
-y es you!

267
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:42,439
-License from me?
-y es you!

268
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:46,480
-From Deepak Kumar?
-Deepak Kumar, come with me.

269
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:49,480
When you get a whiff of jail,
you'll come to your senses!

270
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,518
oK, lets go.

271
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:56,057
Forget about 2-4 hours, take
me in for 2-4 months.

272
00:37:56,294 --> 00:37:58,728
At least l'll get away from this
ridiculous shooting!

273
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:00,325
Lets go!
Hurry up!

274
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:08,134
-Go and get into the car!
-l am, why are you pushing me?

275
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:17,512
He's here, Damodar-bhai.

276
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:28,420
Where are you going?

277
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,858
What is this, Damodar bhai?

278
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,321
y our thugs masquerading as cops
brought me here.

279
00:38:34,632 --> 00:38:35,963
These threats don't scare me.

280
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,801
My name is also...Deepak...Kumar.

281
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:43,235
Plastered.

282
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:50,179
Splash water on him.
Give him black coffee.

283
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:58,982
When he comes to his senses,
he will cool down.

284
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:02,417
Gangiya, next time
you beat up anybody...

285
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,159
l'll come and smash you to pulp
in your own bar! Understood!

286
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:16,601
Go to Gangiya's bar. And check if
he has renewed his license or not.

287
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:22,709
lnspector.

288
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:27,645
A scoundrel tried to rape me.

289
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:33,556
Don't cry.
Sit there. Go on.

290
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:41,197
Sit down.

291
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,092
What happened?

292
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:48,569
There's this man,...
no, he's a beast.

293
00:39:50,074 --> 00:39:54,306
He is a big film producer.
l went to him for work.

294
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:59,579
He said, 'y ou are good looking.
but l have to take a trail first'.

295
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,911
Sir, he called me home.
And...

296
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:05,619
Don't cry.

297
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:09,023
- What did you say his name was?
- Damodar.

298
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:15,525
Tomorrow at 9 a.m. you will
shoot for my film.

299
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:20,234
The film should be finished
on time.

300
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:24,303
or l'll finish you.

301
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:29,635
Damodar bhai, don't get angry.
Think about me as well.

302
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:35,379
l'm sick of these stereotypes!

303
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,380
Damodar bhai, l'll do all your
films free of cost.

304
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:45,894
but conceive a role for me
no one has ever heard about!

305
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:50,093
Something macho!
Something solid!

306
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,929
Hey, how did you get in?
Didn't my men stop you outside?

307
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:44,048
- y ou are Damodar?
- y es. So?

308
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,488
What is the telephone number
of your residence?

309
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:49,826
Why?

310
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:56,659
What is the telephone number
of your residence?

311
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:04,802
What will you do?

312
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:18,952
Speaking.

313
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,219
What's the matter, inspector?

314
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,625
y our husband has met
with an accident.

315
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:29,998
y es. Nothing to worry about.

316
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:34,704
He only has four ribs
and a broken arm.

317
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,405
No trace of the jaw.
l don't know which leg has broken.

318
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:44,648
lf you want to know, come to
Jaslok hospital.

319
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:51,153
- When did l meet with an accident?
- Just now.

320
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:55,416
y ou claim to be a very
big bhai (brother), don't you?

321
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:59,745
Then the womenfolk of the entire
world are your sisters.

322
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,954
Then how dare you rape them?

323
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:06,788
Was it with this hand?

324
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:19,165
y ou! y ou work in films?

325
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:35,652
Reach him to Jaslok hospital.

326
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:53,167
He speaks so well!
He fights so well!

327
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,372
- What style!
- Hey, Jaslok!

328
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:06,111
Didn't l tell you about
a character...? That's him!

329
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,747
l want to play a character
like him!

330
00:46:10,754 --> 00:46:14,690
Produce just one film, in which
l'll play an inspector.

331
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,094
l won't take a single penny from you.
ln fact l'll invest some if you want.

332
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:21,022
l'll play the role of that inspector.

333
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,066
This is yours.

334
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:40,775
- Do you know Deepak Kumar?
- That midget?

335
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:45,785
y ou are wrong.
He is a very big actor.

336
00:46:52,496 --> 00:46:56,023
Do something for me, Karan.
Keep him with you for a few days.

337
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,230
With me?
l can't do that, sir.

338
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:08,076
y ou won't? This is a golden
opportunity of your life.

339
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:10,107
on the contrary, it's the worst
opportunity there could be.

340
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:12,209
l? Keep that
cockroach with me?

341
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:19,818
He's not a cockroach.
Girls die to only approach him.

342
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:23,885
y ou don't know what he is.
Ask me, ask his fans.

343
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:29,095
Actually, he has only
done romantic roles so far.

344
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:33,725
Now he wants to do tough roles.
Like Dharmendra would.

345
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,004
Maybe, what do l do?

346
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:41,340
Do nothing. only keep him
with you for few days.

347
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:44,445
- l refuse to obey this order.
- y ou have got to obey it!

348
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,308
- l won't, sir!
- y ou have to!

349
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:48,280
Fine.

350
00:47:48,886 --> 00:47:50,649
Remove your hand, l know you
have your resignation with you.

351
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:53,990
l'm no ordinary man. l'm the D.C.P!
- Must be!

352
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:57,659
When did l deny that?

353
00:47:58,729 --> 00:48:01,095
Sir, you very well know that
l'm busy with my brother's case.

354
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,093
And...and you are thrusting this
cartoon on me?

355
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,163
Sit down.

356
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:09,028
Sit down, l say.

357
00:48:14,878 --> 00:48:17,244
l'm least interested in thrusting
anyone on you!

358
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,806
l also have orders to obey.
This is the D.l.G's order.

359
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:23,144
- What do l do?
- l can't do this, sir.

360
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:24,877
And l'll tell you something else...

361
00:48:25,122 --> 00:48:27,488
And the person you are trying to help,
he wasn't just your brother...

362
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,016
He was like a son to me.

363
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:33,386
Schooling him, l made him
into an inspector.

364
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,732
And you, this DSP made you,
this DSP!

365
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:40,969
And you can't even do this
one thing for me?

366
00:48:41,205 --> 00:48:42,729
Sir, its such a thing...

367
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:45,298
Sir, you know me...

368
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,770
...l'm a hot tempered person...

369
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:49,308
...if something goes haywire,
l'll lay one on him!

370
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:50,570
That he'll be zeroed out.

371
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:52,308
Then don't blame me!

372
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,380
What do you mean by all this?

373
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:57,187
What l mean is that l can't do this.

374
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:57,949
What?

375
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:17,405
The way you kicked the door
and stormed in.

376
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,667
What an entry! y ou reminded me
of Amit in ' Lawaris '.

377
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:22,477
Amit?

378
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:27,147
That walk! That talk!
That style! That punch!

379
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:31,612
l don't have words to describe it.
l've gone crazy about you!

380
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,057
lf l make an entry like this
in one of my films...

381
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:40,222
...by God, l'll create
sensation all over lndia.

382
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:48,300
My film will do much better
then these three films.

383
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:51,304
Guru, just teach me your style.

384
00:49:58,582 --> 00:49:59,844
Mr. D.C.P.

385
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:03,515
l was busy talking to Karan.
l didn't see you.

386
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,954
l sent you passes to the premiere
How did you find the film?

387
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:10,953
lt was wonderful!
My children were jumping on the seat.

388
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:48,787
So, Mr. Karan. y ou won't have any
problem keeping me with you.

389
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:54,194
l can help you in investigating a
murder case or tracing a gangster.

390
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:03,839
y our introduction please.

391
00:51:08,452 --> 00:51:12,912
y ou probably haven't recognized me
because of my get-up.

392
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,487
Actually we actors can't move
around without a get-up.

393
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,722
- lt's artificial?
- y es.

394
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:28,636
Preserve it.

395
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:21,890
Hey, constable! Can't you hear me?
Leave my children l say!

396
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:26,059
y ou dare threaten
constable Ramlal?!

397
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:30,923
- l won't leave them. Do what you can.
- Constable, please don't do that.

398
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,136
Please leave my children alone.

399
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:38,100
y ou've resorted to apple-polishing?
Are you a politician's child?

400
00:57:38,608 --> 00:57:42,510
l won't let them go!
l swear l won't!

401
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:47,511
- How innocent they look.
- lnnocent?!

402
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:53,113
They look like devils.
Wonder where you got them from?

403
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:56,356
The day they were born,
devils had retired!

404
00:57:57,093 --> 00:58:01,029
Are they children?! When they pass by
my wallets disappear.

405
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:06,230
My socks and my vest disappears.

406
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:09,561
- l'll never leave this brat!
- Shut up!

407
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:15,978
He's shouting at me?
y ou little brat!

408
00:58:16,312 --> 00:58:21,147
- Hey, slut!
- y ou called me a slut!

409
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:25,182
- He called me a slut!
- Are you a princess? Cheapskate?

410
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:29,649
Cheapskate!
y ou called me a cheapskate?!

411
00:58:29,993 --> 00:58:31,961
- Forget it, sister.
- y ou!

412
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:46,503
Now how will you escape?
l'll make you bald.

413
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,527
See for yourself, sir.

414
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,993
She has taken after Phoolandevi.

415
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:16,435
She beat your Ramlal
black and blue.

416
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:20,936
People salute me and she threw
files at me!

417
00:59:21,811 --> 00:59:27,579
Sir! l'm narrating my problems
and you are gaping at her.

418
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,583
Don't look at her.
She is a trickster.

419
00:59:36,726 --> 00:59:37,488
y our name?

420
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:42,195
- Tuck your vest in and go out.
- What? Put this in and go out.

421
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:47,801
l don't have any energy left.
l can't do anything.

422
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:49,537
Ramlal, just go out!

423
00:59:53,176 --> 00:59:54,108
Sending me out?

424
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,809
l have to pay for someone
else's crime.

425
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:05,418
Good riddance!
Sir, you are amazing!

426
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,882
Good you sent him away!

427
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:12,919
What do l tell you?
He caught my children.

428
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:16,226
- That bloody constable!
- Shut up!

429
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,764
lf you utter another word
l'll lock you in! Shut up!

430
01:00:22,238 --> 01:00:23,603
What did you say your name was?

431
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:31,504
basanti, l'll spare you
on one condition.

432
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:36,083
What work?

433
01:00:37,553 --> 01:00:39,214
l can't say it
in front of these children.

434
01:00:43,426 --> 01:00:48,887
l know....what you will
ask me to do.

435
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:51,894
That...

436
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:56,570
...l must sleep with you.

437
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,302
Don't talk nonsense!
or l'll break your teeth!

438
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,737
ldiot! Uncouth girl!

439
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,208
Forgive me, sir.

440
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:12,249
That's what people ask me to do.

441
01:01:12,488 --> 01:01:15,013
And you thought l'm
one of them?!

442
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,919
l'm sorry, sir.
Please forgive me.

443
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,425
l'm ready to do as you say.

444
01:01:28,604 --> 01:01:31,334
l can do anything
for these children.

445
01:01:31,674 --> 01:01:33,039
y ou just don't worry, sir.
l'll handle him.

446
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:37,809
y ou know, we actors are
very charming.

447
01:01:45,888 --> 01:01:49,517
Karan, be careful!
His hand will come apart!

448
01:01:52,261 --> 01:01:53,193
Look at her intently.

449
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:01,402
This is basanti.
And basanti this is....

450
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:03,968
This is Deepak Kumar!

451
01:02:10,013 --> 01:02:11,412
- y ou want to stay with me?
- y es.

452
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:16,646
y ou have to do me a favor.
See this illiterate girl?

453
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:21,555
...you've got to make
a modern girl out of her.

454
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:26,558
y ou have to teach her English.
Transform her completely.

455
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,798
because she has to impersonate
a cabaret dancer.

456
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:35,972
Teach her a bit of acting.
So that she doesn't get caught.

457
01:02:35,972 --> 01:02:38,566
ls that all?
That's child's play for me!

458
01:02:41,377 --> 01:02:43,538
but after that, you have
to keep me with you.

459
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:44,975
lf you succeed.

460
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:16,837
basanti, you?!

461
01:04:23,713 --> 01:04:24,645
His highness!

462
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:31,352
lt's my talent that transformed...

463
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:37,252
- And turned her to Mona.
- y ou've done a marvelous job.

464
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:40,286
Not l, buddy.
but my acting.

465
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:45,791
This is the talent we present on
screen and drive millions crazy.

466
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,030
- ln one of my films...
- Enough!

467
01:04:48,404 --> 01:04:49,632
l don't want to see
your sick acting.

468
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:53,464
- Show it on screen!
- y ou are very rude.

469
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:58,504
l've kept my word. Now you
must fulfill your promise.

470
01:04:59,148 --> 01:04:59,739
What promise?

471
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:04,051
Do you hear that?
He doesn't even remember!

472
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:06,882
l have to stay with you
for three months.

473
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:08,854
Can't we think of another solution?

474
01:05:09,325 --> 01:05:12,089
l'll cling to you from
this very minute.

475
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:14,258
Go ahead. but you have to do me
another favor.

476
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:17,960
- What work?
- Hey, hold it!

477
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:24,295
Do your talking afterwards.
First l want to meet my children.

478
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:27,576
l'm missing them a lot.

479
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:31,646
Which schools are open at night?
l'll take you tomorrow morning.

480
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:33,644
Sister! Sister!

481
01:05:36,786 --> 01:05:38,947
Where did you leave us and go?

482
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:50,822
All of you look so nice.

483
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:55,728
No, sister. We don't want to study.
We want to stay with you.

484
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:08,676
From the day all of you entered
my life, l had only one dream.

485
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:13,279
To educate you and make
nice human beings of you.

486
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:16,485
Come on, children.
Time's up.

487
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:22,464
Please look after my children.

488
01:06:23,899 --> 01:06:27,630
l have no one except them.

489
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,125
Remember, l asked you to
do me another favor?

490
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,264
y ou have to take basanti
to Moonlight hotel.

491
01:07:06,709 --> 01:07:08,802
- Why?
- because she...

492
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:13,846
because she has to go there
as a cabaret dancer.

493
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:18,609
but...how can he take me there?
Anyone can recognize him.

494
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:22,516
No one will recognize me.
y ou must have seen my film.

495
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:23,922
Which one?

496
01:07:42,378 --> 01:07:43,675
l'm getting scared.

497
01:07:45,247 --> 01:07:47,738
Shall l tell you a secret?
l'm scared too.

498
01:08:19,248 --> 01:08:22,046
Don't be so astonished.
She is the same Mona.

499
01:08:22,918 --> 01:08:26,012
l found her in the sea.
She had been hit by four bullets.

500
01:08:32,828 --> 01:08:35,296
but since the water was cold
her blood got clotted.

501
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:39,693
l took her to the dispensary.
l treated her for a month.

502
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:44,328
As soon as she became all right.
l got her to you. Understood?

503
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:49,237
l managed to save her, but...
- but what?

504
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:54,981
Just as a short circuit can
cause a black out in the house...

505
01:08:55,284 --> 01:08:59,152
similarly, when human beings receive
a shock, they lose their memory.

506
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:02,848
They don't remember anything.
Neither relations nor incidents.

507
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:08,028
She has received such a shock.
She has lost her memory.

508
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,428
ln her sleep, she only kept
uttering ''Moonlight hotel''.

509
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:18,972
Hence l took an appointment on
phone and got her here.

510
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:20,842
Who is she to you?

511
01:09:24,013 --> 01:09:27,346
She is my fiancEe.
l was going to get married to her.

512
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:30,244
Thank you very much.

513
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:59,604
Wow, Mona!
y ou were too good.

514
01:10:00,783 --> 01:10:04,651
The same electrifying movements!
The same style!

515
01:10:07,389 --> 01:10:08,117
Look, Goli.

516
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:13,292
lt's true that l consider you
to be a nice human being.

517
01:10:15,364 --> 01:10:23,567
but...l don't like you caressing
and kissing me.

518
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:30,202
y ou are my life.
y ou mean everything to me.

519
01:10:31,447 --> 01:10:38,285
- y ou are my future wife.
- l don't remember anything.

520
01:10:39,255 --> 01:10:44,090
And when you force me,
l get a splitting headache.

521
01:10:47,696 --> 01:10:54,124
Till l don't recollect everything,
please don't do all this with me.

522
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:59,000
okay, Mona.
y our wish is my command.

523
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:05,578
Till you don't remember my love.
Till you don't come and embrace me.

524
01:11:06,749 --> 01:11:10,310
Neither will l touch you
nor embrace you.

525
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,811
That's a promise.
Happy?

526
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:40,541
Tonight at Disney world we should...

527
01:11:40,983 --> 01:11:46,717
.. finish the work between
1 1 :15 to 1 1 :30.

528
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:49,885
- Done!
- y es!

529
01:12:03,205 --> 01:12:06,902
- Mr. Karan, basanti here.
- y es, basanti?

530
01:12:07,643 --> 01:12:10,476
l heard some goons talking
just now.

531
01:12:11,146 --> 01:12:13,307
Tonight they are going to
rob the Disney world.

532
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:17,644
l asked you to keep a vigil on
Goli's men. Not on stupid things.

533
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,147
Now what is this?
Aren't you a police officer?

534
01:12:22,992 --> 01:12:24,857
So isn't it your duty
to stop thefts?

535
01:12:25,394 --> 01:12:29,854
okay, l have heard that.
y es, l'm going.

536
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:36,501
Hey, oldie! Do as l say.
And give me the loot.

537
01:12:37,072 --> 01:12:40,940
or l'll take your daughter to
a lonely place and...

538
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:46,009
No! Leave my daughter. l'll give you
as much as money you want.

539
01:12:51,086 --> 01:12:54,055
Karan, the gate is closed!
No, Karan!

540
01:12:58,994 --> 01:12:59,790
y ou are mad!

541
01:13:05,034 --> 01:13:07,195
be careful!
My life is very precious.

542
01:15:04,253 --> 01:15:06,414
- y ou want to fight?
- y es.

543
01:15:08,357 --> 01:15:10,257
- With me only?
- y es!

544
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,488
Just a minute.

545
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:23,565
one moment...
First say action.

546
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,838
Say action.

547
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:11,607
Leave my man alone.
or l'll blow his brains off!

548
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:21,649
Get in!

549
01:17:42,678 --> 01:17:43,736
Dirtied my suit.

550
01:17:49,952 --> 01:17:51,613
l told you not to step
out of the jeep!

551
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:55,281
Why did you step out?
What did you think?

552
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,889
That this a film shooting?!
And they were fake goons?!

553
01:18:00,462 --> 01:18:02,020
With fake revolvers?!

554
01:18:03,832 --> 01:18:06,232
Come out of your superficial
world and look around!

555
01:18:06,768 --> 01:18:08,929
Look at reality!
Look at me!

556
01:18:10,205 --> 01:18:14,198
When l leave my house at dawn l don't
know whether l'll return or no?

557
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:21,410
l can't say at which crossroad,
death is waiting to maim me!

558
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:27,386
Had he shot you, your head would've
blown up like a watermelon!

559
01:18:27,589 --> 01:18:29,250
And it would be lying on
the streets...

560
01:18:29,524 --> 01:18:32,459
where some stray dog
would've feasted on it!

561
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:38,525
ln your profession, you get many
opportunities to correct your mistake.

562
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:43,601
Many retakes!
but we get only one take!

563
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:49,602
And if we falter,
we die!

564
01:18:57,285 --> 01:19:01,051
Repeat that line, please!
That one about the retake!

565
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:03,148
lf l learn that line,
my life will be made!

566
01:19:16,038 --> 01:19:17,471
broke my tape recorder?

567
01:19:36,758 --> 01:19:40,592
- Why did you shut it off?
- No more movies.

568
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:43,692
Please switch it on.
lt's Deepak Kumar's song.

569
01:19:44,066 --> 01:19:48,003
lf l see this cartoon again,
l'll throw away the T.v.

570
01:19:48,003 --> 01:19:50,369
Sister-in-law! He's not
letting me switch on the T.v.

571
01:19:50,806 --> 01:19:51,534
Why call her?

572
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,070
l'm your elder brother.
This monkey shouldn't be seen here.

573
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:56,138
Look, don't abuse Deepak Kumar!

574
01:19:56,945 --> 01:20:00,403
l will! He looks like an ape,
a monkey, an owl!

575
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:04,683
- y ou abused him again?!
- l'll abuse him on his face.

576
01:20:04,886 --> 01:20:06,388
- y ou?
- y es.

577
01:20:06,388 --> 01:20:10,258
What is there to laugh about?
Don't you believe me?

578
01:20:10,258 --> 01:20:11,247
- No?
- No.

579
01:20:12,094 --> 01:20:13,118
y ou stop laughing.

580
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:16,860
lf l call him home,... stop making
faces and listen to me!

581
01:20:17,732 --> 01:20:21,429
What if l call him home and make him
stay with my dog in the garage?

582
01:20:22,037 --> 01:20:23,595
- With Tommy?
- y es!

583
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:27,440
y ou still don't believe me?
What if l do it?

584
01:20:28,376 --> 01:20:30,139
l'll do as you say.

585
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:31,839
- Promise?
- Promise.

586
01:20:32,114 --> 01:20:35,379
- y ou'll never watch his films.
- okay.

587
01:20:39,354 --> 01:20:40,116
Stop laughing.

588
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:59,598
What a personality!

589
01:21:00,842 --> 01:21:03,242
What height!
Want to be an actor?

590
01:21:03,712 --> 01:21:06,442
Forget Deepak.
l made him the star he is.

591
01:21:07,449 --> 01:21:11,783
y ou'll create a sensation!
y ou'll become a hero from zero!

592
01:21:13,522 --> 01:21:16,082
Can you fight?
Dance, perhaps?

593
01:21:16,925 --> 01:21:19,291
l'll teach you.
y ou just have to spend some money.

594
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:23,190
Raise 25 thousand. The money goes
here, and you go there!

595
01:21:23,732 --> 01:21:27,566
Definitely you must be having a name.
but l'll give you a nice name.

596
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,429
- What is your name?
- My name?

597
01:21:37,913 --> 01:21:39,437
y ou are great, sir!
Simply great!

598
01:21:40,015 --> 01:21:43,185
Mr. Deepak is your fan!
y ou have driven him crazy!

599
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:48,248
He only thinks
about you all the time!

600
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:53,258
This is just a trailer.
but you must become an actor.

601
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:57,493
y ou must!
Don't think!

602
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:02,398
Raaj Kumar was an inspector first.
Now he's one of the top most actor.

603
01:22:02,938 --> 01:22:04,303
He has created a sensation
in the film industry .

604
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:08,532
He has become
a pain for everybody.

605
01:22:13,315 --> 01:22:15,783
- Where will l find Deepak?
- Forget Deepak.

606
01:22:16,218 --> 01:22:20,416
The carpet which Deepak is standing
on today, l had laid it.

607
01:22:21,256 --> 01:22:23,019
l'll pull it and down he goes!

608
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:26,389
- Where is Deepak?
- Upstairs!

609
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:36,126
This man is of no use.
So damn original?!

610
01:22:42,877 --> 01:22:46,608
l was thinking about you only.
y our action is too good!

611
01:22:47,082 --> 01:22:49,812
And your dialogue! l shook the
writers of the industry!

612
01:22:51,086 --> 01:22:52,383
- Where are your clothes?
- Clothes?

613
01:22:53,455 --> 01:22:54,581
ln the cupboard.

614
01:23:08,136 --> 01:23:11,367
Why are you putting my clothes in
the bag? Are we going somewhere?

615
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,632
- y es.
- Where to?

616
01:23:14,209 --> 01:23:18,077
- To my house.
- Why?

617
01:23:18,546 --> 01:23:20,036
because my duty-hours
are unpredictable.

618
01:23:20,615 --> 01:23:26,178
Anything can happen anytime!
And l have to be there.

619
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:29,385
And if you are not around,
it'll be your loss.

620
01:23:31,226 --> 01:23:36,289
That's right. lf l stay with you,
l'll have a 24 hour class.

621
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,824
Wear this.

622
01:23:42,003 --> 01:23:44,995
Actually, Karan. l have only
stayed in five star hotels.

623
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:48,100
Staying in your house will
be a good experience.

624
01:23:54,783 --> 01:23:55,807
How about some tea or coffee?

625
01:23:57,485 --> 01:23:58,383
Have some juice at least.

626
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:03,087
As l was saying, you must have an
air-conditioner in your house?

627
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:10,420
A hot and cold shower. A bath-tub!
Life without all this is dry.

628
01:24:10,999 --> 01:24:11,294
Right, Karan.

629
01:24:17,205 --> 01:24:20,641
- Where are you going?
- Say l'm going abroad for a month.

630
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:21,803
For a month!

631
01:24:23,778 --> 01:24:24,836
Mother!

632
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,960
Quite a small lift.
but it's cute.

633
01:24:41,629 --> 01:24:44,154
ln case the lights go of when
a couple is in the lift....

634
01:24:44,466 --> 01:24:45,626
...what a romantic scene
it can be.

635
01:25:10,392 --> 01:25:11,324
Get in!

636
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:14,760
Come on!

637
01:25:22,237 --> 01:25:23,465
lsn't this house a bit small?

638
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:30,578
l want a big room
with an air conditioner.

639
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:38,380
Look, we have three rooms. For me,
my sister and my sister-in-law.

640
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,314
- Understood!
- Where will l stay?

641
01:25:41,756 --> 01:25:42,723
ln the garage.

642
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:44,490
- Garage?
- y es!

643
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:47,359
We'll put a cot there.
Go to sleep.

644
01:25:48,263 --> 01:25:51,164
Let alone an a/c, there is neither
a fan nor a window there.

645
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:53,099
Me? ln the garage?

646
01:25:56,404 --> 01:25:58,770
Stand up! ... Up!

647
01:26:01,342 --> 01:26:03,003
- Do you want to stay with me?
- y es, but...

648
01:26:03,411 --> 01:26:04,378
Shut up.

649
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,304
Sit down quietly.

650
01:26:09,984 --> 01:26:11,076
bloody nuisance!

651
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,789
What are you doing here?
Go and make some tea.

652
01:26:15,557 --> 01:26:17,286
Shivangi! Go and make tea!

653
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:22,729
That's the bathroom!

654
01:26:28,236 --> 01:26:30,932
This house of yours.
There's lot of realism in it!

655
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,471
Will you give me your house
on rent for shooting?

656
01:26:37,512 --> 01:26:39,810
y ou will not discuss anything
about a shoot here!

657
01:26:40,882 --> 01:26:42,076
- Why?
- because...

658
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,281
My sister is your...very big fan.

659
01:26:50,325 --> 01:26:52,384
l don't understand how anyone
can be your fan!

660
01:26:54,796 --> 01:27:00,496
lt might surprise you.
but l have thousands of fan.

661
01:27:00,635 --> 01:27:04,833
Maybe, but l don't want
any fan in my house...

662
01:27:05,106 --> 01:27:06,437
Else l'll hang you from the fan!

663
01:27:07,342 --> 01:27:09,310
Thousands of fan, my foot!

664
01:27:11,112 --> 01:27:12,739
Listen! Listen!

665
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:19,952
l want you to do something that
my sister starts hating you.

666
01:27:21,022 --> 01:27:24,389
- Why?
- because l say so!

667
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:29,387
l won't.

668
01:27:33,935 --> 01:27:34,959
l won't.

669
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:37,431
- y ou won't?
- No.

670
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:39,095
- y ou won't?
- No.

671
01:27:39,507 --> 01:27:40,474
No?
- No.

672
01:27:40,808 --> 01:27:41,604
but why not?

673
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:46,144
First smile and say ''please''.

674
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:09,429
l've said it.

675
01:28:34,128 --> 01:28:35,288
How much sugar will you take?

676
01:28:58,453 --> 01:28:59,681
Don't you think you've put
a lot of sugar?

677
01:29:00,822 --> 01:29:01,789
Sugar?

678
01:29:17,305 --> 01:29:18,602
Shivangi! What are you doing?

679
01:29:21,042 --> 01:29:24,375
Go and prepare food.

680
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,311
Go to the kitchen.

681
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:33,854
Will you drink it?

682
01:29:51,673 --> 01:29:52,640
- Ladyfinger!
- Lady finger?!

683
01:29:54,142 --> 01:29:58,704
l told you l don't like lady finger!
Then why did you make it?!

684
01:30:01,983 --> 01:30:02,950
l like it.

685
01:30:04,952 --> 01:30:08,149
l made it for him and
not for you, brother.

686
01:30:08,556 --> 01:30:10,683
- He loves ladyfinger.
- Heard that?

687
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:18,623
- And how do you know that?
- l read his interview in 'Stardust'.

688
01:30:21,703 --> 01:30:22,829
Ladyfinger.

689
01:30:31,746 --> 01:30:33,304
- What is it?
- Sister-in-law! Look who's here.

690
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,218
- Sister-in-law, he...
- l know, he's Deepak Kumar.

691
01:30:38,986 --> 01:30:41,853
Chutki is a very big
fan of yours.

692
01:30:42,256 --> 01:30:46,488
- She watches all your films.
- Please sit. The food is delicious.

693
01:30:47,195 --> 01:30:48,924
Especially the lady finger.

694
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,764
Sister-in-law, take care of Shivangi!
She is getting out of control.

695
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:59,305
Ask her to concentrate on her studies.
And stop watching movies.

696
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:05,378
Sister-in-law, what does
she know about fans?

697
01:31:06,247 --> 01:31:07,942
l'll tell you what a fan is!

698
01:31:08,683 --> 01:31:11,243
one day someone phoned me at
three in the morning.

699
01:31:11,919 --> 01:31:16,879
An aggrieved mother was pleading me
to save her daughter.

700
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:19,020
Do you know what had
happened to her daughter?

701
01:31:19,427 --> 01:31:20,724
What?

702
01:31:21,596 --> 01:31:23,655
Her daughter was a
great fan of mine.

703
01:31:25,099 --> 01:31:31,163
She was so crazy that she carved out
my name on her wrist with a knife.

704
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:35,873
What do l tell you? While doing
that, she slit a nerve.

705
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:39,470
- What are you saying?
- y es, and she bled a lot.

706
01:31:40,214 --> 01:31:43,183
She was almost on
the verge of dying!

707
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:46,754
This is called madness.

708
01:31:49,457 --> 01:31:51,584
Shivangi's madness is nothing
compared to this.

709
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:57,722
l have millions of fans like her.

710
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:45,272
l've been watching you.
for the last two hours

711
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:49,141
lt's like moving with a bloody mirror!
l can't even think, because of you!

712
01:33:04,866 --> 01:33:09,769
y ou ape me! y ou even smoke like me!
Soon l'm going to quit smoking!

713
01:33:10,204 --> 01:33:11,865
Me too! lt is a bad habit.

714
01:33:20,248 --> 01:33:22,580
one second,... why are you
getting so angry?

715
01:33:23,484 --> 01:33:24,951
l was only trying to be like you.

716
01:33:25,519 --> 01:33:28,784
lt's easy to tackle an army,
but not a monkey like you!

717
01:33:32,326 --> 01:33:33,520
Do you know where l'm going?

718
01:33:33,895 --> 01:33:35,157
- No.
- To the loo!

719
01:33:35,463 --> 01:33:38,261
- Come and watch me do it!
- No thank you.

720
01:33:38,599 --> 01:33:42,228
What's the point in watching
something we can't show the public?

721
01:33:42,904 --> 01:33:43,996
Carry on.

722
01:33:49,543 --> 01:33:50,532
Are you Damodar?

723
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,274
Are you Damodar?

724
01:33:55,549 --> 01:33:56,743
What is the telephone number
of your residence?

725
01:34:19,807 --> 01:34:23,402
l'm neither interested in your
films nor your heroes! Got it?!

726
01:34:25,046 --> 01:34:27,606
Don't try to bug me!

727
01:34:34,855 --> 01:34:38,450
- Karan, is Deepak there?
- oh, sister-in-law. l'm Deepak.

728
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:44,923
While writing your name on her wrist,
Shivangi slit her nerve.

729
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,261
l'm calling from Holy Spirit hospital.
Please rush here soon.

730
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,729
And don't tell Karan anything.

731
01:34:52,006 --> 01:34:54,736
Sister-in-law, don't worry,
l'll be there right away.

732
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:05,044
Hey jerk!

733
01:35:25,373 --> 01:35:26,670
Not now sister.

734
01:35:28,976 --> 01:35:32,377
Sister-in-law, how is Shivangi?
ls she out of danger?

735
01:35:32,947 --> 01:35:35,939
y es. but even the doctors
were scared initially.

736
01:35:36,684 --> 01:35:42,213
She just wouldn't stop bleeding.
l thought l had lost her.

737
01:35:44,358 --> 01:35:47,384
Sister-in-law, don't cry.
Everything will be all right.

738
01:35:48,729 --> 01:35:55,658
Shivangi was my husband's favorite.
She is like a daughter to me.

739
01:35:56,837 --> 01:36:02,036
- l wonder why she was so crazy?
- l very well understand this.

740
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:04,207
l have a cure for it too.

741
01:36:09,383 --> 01:36:10,475
Please wait here.

742
01:36:43,284 --> 01:36:44,876
What madness is this?

743
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:51,048
y ou had told me that someone else
is a greater fan of yours than me.

744
01:36:51,892 --> 01:36:54,452
Who had etched your name
on her wrist.

745
01:36:54,995 --> 01:36:59,022
l also tried, but l don't know
when l fell unconscious.

746
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:04,194
l had lied to you folks.

747
01:37:06,006 --> 01:37:09,464
- but l took it seriously.
- but...

748
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:12,739
but why?

749
01:37:14,782 --> 01:37:21,210
So that my name is on top
of the list of your fans.

750
01:37:21,956 --> 01:37:25,551
Can anyone love someone so dearly?

751
01:37:25,693 --> 01:37:27,991
y es.

752
01:37:31,832 --> 01:37:32,992
Will you come close?

753
01:37:36,237 --> 01:37:37,226
Closer.

754
01:37:39,406 --> 01:37:40,771
Closer.

755
01:37:44,111 --> 01:37:45,009
l love you.

756
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:15,661
Whatever you are doing
is not good.

757
01:43:18,332 --> 01:43:20,357
And what is it that l'm doing?

758
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:25,635
Don't try to hide from me.
l know everything. y ou and Deepak...

759
01:43:27,508 --> 01:43:33,344
- lt's better if you don't meet him.
- Why? lsn't he a nice human being?

760
01:43:36,417 --> 01:43:40,649
of course, he is
a very nice person.

761
01:43:41,155 --> 01:43:43,350
- but...
- but what?

762
01:43:44,091 --> 01:43:47,618
Look, Chutki. lt's not advisable
to talk to Karan now.

763
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:53,393
As, all he can think about is
your brother's killer.

764
01:43:54,135 --> 01:43:56,296
lf l talk to him now,
he will get angry.

765
01:43:56,971 --> 01:44:01,908
So l suggest you remain quiet for
a few days and not meet each other.

766
01:44:03,177 --> 01:44:05,702
When the time is right l'll
personally talk to him.

767
01:44:06,881 --> 01:44:11,716
And l'm sure, Karan will
never say no to me.

768
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:20,087
Don't cry, Chutki.

769
01:44:21,929 --> 01:44:26,423
What happened?
- l'll never meet you again.

770
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:31,400
Not meet me?
Why not?

771
01:44:33,007 --> 01:44:37,068
because neither brother nor
sister-in-law will be happy.

772
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:41,606
Hence it's better....
if we don't meet again.

773
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:45,252
Why not? Why won't Karan accept
our relationship?

774
01:44:45,786 --> 01:44:49,449
We love each other. l'll
straight away go and tell him...

775
01:44:49,891 --> 01:44:52,724
...that l want to marry you.

776
01:44:53,127 --> 01:44:57,757
No, Deepak. Karan will
never understand our feelings.

777
01:44:58,566 --> 01:45:01,126
He cannot see beyond
the law and his duties.

778
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:04,804
He won't understand our sentiments.

779
01:45:05,539 --> 01:45:08,838
Why won't he? Hitherto no one
has made an effort.

780
01:45:09,343 --> 01:45:12,176
Love can even melt a
stone-hearted person.

781
01:45:12,747 --> 01:45:15,807
What? Love?!
And that too brother Karan?

782
01:45:16,484 --> 01:45:19,180
He can't even smile,
what will he think about love.

783
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:24,656
He will Shivangi.
We will teach him how to love.

784
01:45:25,059 --> 01:45:29,689
When he realizes what love is,
he'll value our love too.

785
01:45:30,131 --> 01:45:32,929
And after that our
path will be cleared.

786
01:45:33,301 --> 01:45:39,240
No way. He's always talking
about guns and bullets.

787
01:45:40,141 --> 01:45:42,075
Which girl is crazy to
fall in love with him?

788
01:45:43,044 --> 01:45:46,741
There is a girl, Shivangi.
And he will fall in love.

789
01:45:47,581 --> 01:45:52,416
l'll bring such a twist in his life
that he'll be left with no choice.

790
01:46:02,897 --> 01:46:07,391
- Not everybody get what they want.
- Why not?

791
01:46:08,269 --> 01:46:12,968
Tell me something.
How do you find Karan?

792
01:46:13,507 --> 01:46:14,974
Absolutely boring.

793
01:46:16,744 --> 01:46:20,544
of course. All the time he moves
around with a sick look on his face.

794
01:46:21,082 --> 01:46:24,347
There's no smile on his lips.
A curt look.

795
01:46:25,286 --> 01:46:27,345
And neither have l seen
any sympathy in his eyes.

796
01:46:27,855 --> 01:46:29,152
y ou know how he
looks when he walks?

797
01:46:29,924 --> 01:46:34,258
Like a loaded revolver
dressed like a man.

798
01:46:34,662 --> 01:46:40,430
Don't say that. He has lot of
sympathy for you if not for others.

799
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,326
oh forget it.
That's a load of bull-shit!

800
01:46:42,903 --> 01:46:45,770
He can never have sympathy
for anybody.

801
01:46:46,674 --> 01:46:49,837
That's where you are wrong.
y ou have only seen his face.

802
01:46:50,344 --> 01:46:52,574
Come down a bit and
peep into his heart.

803
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:58,040
He's like a coconut.
A hard exterior and tender within.

804
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,750
l don't believe you.

805
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:07,050
Why don't you believe me?!
l...l swear to...my make up.

806
01:47:07,728 --> 01:47:11,721
l stay with him 24 hours. And most
of the time he only talks about you.

807
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,693
About me? Really?

808
01:47:15,369 --> 01:47:17,894
l just swore, and still you
don't believe me?

809
01:47:19,573 --> 01:47:21,837
- What does he say?
- He says that...

810
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:24,710
He says that...

811
01:47:27,615 --> 01:47:31,984
He doesn't say anything.
He's foolish in this matter.

812
01:47:32,853 --> 01:47:36,721
- but one thing really hurts him.
- What?

813
01:47:37,058 --> 01:47:40,994
That you dance on the streets
and bandy words with men.

814
01:47:41,495 --> 01:47:43,326
And...and pick pockets.

815
01:47:44,632 --> 01:47:47,965
What do l do? l have to do
something for a living.

816
01:47:48,369 --> 01:47:51,634
No, basanti. Don't sacrifice your
love for your living.

817
01:47:52,673 --> 01:47:55,801
Just imagine that you are a
police officer's wife.

818
01:47:56,610 --> 01:48:00,376
y ou'll get so much of respect.

819
01:48:20,267 --> 01:48:26,035
Just imagine, your orphan children
will at least have a father.

820
01:48:39,086 --> 01:48:43,546
- y ou have come?!
- Hey! At least leave my uniform!

821
01:48:47,795 --> 01:48:50,161
- y ou want to be a police officer?
- y es, l do!

822
01:48:51,699 --> 01:48:55,226
- y ou dare scold my children?!
- l was only...

823
01:48:59,073 --> 01:49:00,370
y ou didn't answer my question.

824
01:49:02,176 --> 01:49:04,474
Speak up, basanti.
Speak up!

825
01:49:05,479 --> 01:49:09,779
What do l say?
This dream can't come true.

826
01:49:10,217 --> 01:49:13,118
- lt can basanti. lt can!
- How come?

827
01:49:14,989 --> 01:49:17,685
- Will you do as l say?
- l will.

828
01:49:21,962 --> 01:49:22,690
Why did you get me here?

829
01:49:23,831 --> 01:49:29,565
- buddy, l'm very unhappy today.
- What do l do?

830
01:49:31,338 --> 01:49:33,966
Look, buddy.
l have no one in this world.

831
01:49:34,808 --> 01:49:37,675
only Dhansukh... my secretary.

832
01:49:38,746 --> 01:49:42,944
- And you, my friend.
- Listen to me carefully.

833
01:49:43,717 --> 01:49:48,745
l'm no friend of yours. After your
work is over we go separate ways.

834
01:49:50,057 --> 01:49:51,684
And why have you got me here?

835
01:49:52,393 --> 01:49:53,690
Whether you take me as
your friend or not...

836
01:49:54,195 --> 01:49:56,891
l want to spend the evening with you.
- Why?

837
01:49:58,666 --> 01:50:01,499
because today is my birthday.

838
01:50:07,641 --> 01:50:09,199
- Now what?
- Today is my birthday.

839
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:13,446
- How about a drink?
- No. l lose control over myself.

840
01:50:14,014 --> 01:50:17,381
y ou must've drunk hooch. l'll
treat you to ''Deepak Kumar special''.

841
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:20,780
- No, l won't.
- Today is my birthday!

842
01:50:21,155 --> 01:50:22,918
- only one.
- okay.

843
01:50:24,658 --> 01:50:27,126
- Let's go.
- one is for enmity.

844
01:50:27,494 --> 01:50:29,724
- l don't care. l won't drink!
- Scared, eh?

845
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:34,495
Me?

846
01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:57,980
- That's it.
- ls that all?

847
01:51:12,806 --> 01:51:16,867
l forget to tell you.
basanti had called this morning.

848
01:51:17,444 --> 01:51:18,411
She sounded scared.

849
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:21,646
She says every night at 10,
someone knocks at her door.

850
01:51:22,016 --> 01:51:24,143
- Why?
- l don't know.

851
01:51:24,585 --> 01:51:25,882
y ou left her among the wolves.

852
01:51:26,287 --> 01:51:29,586
lmagine, if someone breaks open
the door, then her chastity will...

853
01:51:30,491 --> 01:51:31,856
Why will anyone do that?

854
01:51:32,559 --> 01:51:37,428
l've taken responsibility to protect
her honor! Understood!

855
01:51:37,765 --> 01:51:39,960
y ou are here and she is there.

856
01:51:42,436 --> 01:51:44,028
l must go.

857
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:49,632
He has not yet come.

858
01:52:03,357 --> 01:52:04,585
He is here!

859
01:52:09,196 --> 01:52:12,529
y ou? y ou are drunk?

860
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,294
No.

861
01:52:16,136 --> 01:52:19,105
l...am drunk.

862
01:52:42,296 --> 01:52:45,823
y ou here, at this hour
of the night?

863
01:52:46,934 --> 01:52:52,236
one should solve night problems
in the night only.

864
01:52:54,174 --> 01:52:57,507
At 10 o'clock some son-of-a-gun...

865
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:05,741
...knocks at your door,
and disturbs your peace.

866
01:53:09,656 --> 01:53:10,748
He's here?

867
01:53:21,101 --> 01:53:25,697
Don't open the door.
l'm getting very scared.

868
01:53:26,073 --> 01:53:28,371
but what are you doing?
Please stay away.

869
01:53:34,248 --> 01:53:39,151
The next time he knocks,
l'll pounce at him immediately.

870
01:53:40,154 --> 01:53:41,917
And l'll beat him so much...

871
01:53:51,398 --> 01:53:52,456
Stay back.

872
01:54:28,268 --> 01:54:29,860
My clothes with hers?

873
01:54:50,023 --> 01:54:52,048
basanti, what happened?

874
01:54:54,194 --> 01:54:56,355
y ou have ruined me!

875
01:54:57,931 --> 01:54:59,694
l'm undone!

876
01:55:01,268 --> 01:55:04,101
Last night you did
whatever you liked.

877
01:55:04,171 --> 01:55:08,699
- What...what did l do?
- What did you do?! y ou...

878
01:55:17,818 --> 01:55:21,584
- basanti, don't cry. Listen to me.
- Don't come near me!

879
01:55:22,322 --> 01:55:24,483
one minute. l'll just come.

880
01:55:40,507 --> 01:55:44,307
Come again?
y ou did everything?

881
01:55:45,746 --> 01:55:47,338
y ou raped that girl?

882
01:55:48,482 --> 01:55:55,411
People revere and respect cops.

883
01:55:56,623 --> 01:56:04,655
And that very inspector has
outraged a girl's modesty?

884
01:56:05,132 --> 01:56:09,398
l could never imagine that you
are a devil in disguise.

885
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:13,031
Poor basanti.

886
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:17,973
l didn't do it deliberately.
lt was an accident.

887
01:56:19,947 --> 01:56:20,879
What do l do?

888
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:26,784
What do l tell you?
y ou have only two options.

889
01:56:27,621 --> 01:56:31,148
Either serve a term for
seven years for rape...

890
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:35,294
...or get married to her.

891
01:56:35,462 --> 01:56:38,659
Hows that possible? Neither does
she know me nor do l love her.

892
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:42,499
As far as knowing you is concerned
by now she knows you too well.

893
01:56:43,437 --> 01:56:48,465
And as for love... you know this
country of ours is amazing.

894
01:56:49,242 --> 01:56:53,042
Girls here fall in love with
their husbands after marriage.

895
01:56:53,814 --> 01:56:55,611
Just get married,
she will start loving you.

896
01:56:56,183 --> 01:56:58,481
- Shall l send for invitation cards?
- Hey! Wait!

897
01:56:58,952 --> 01:57:01,182
- but....
- No ifs and buts.

898
01:57:01,822 --> 01:57:07,852
Tell me something, if she tells
you that she loves you...

899
01:57:08,395 --> 01:57:09,487
...then will you marry her?

900
01:57:10,330 --> 01:57:13,231
- y es...if...
- y es, speak up!

901
01:57:14,067 --> 01:57:18,527
lf she says ' l love you '
then it's fine.

902
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:27,506
Deepak here. Do as l have told you.
l'm giving Karan the phone.

903
01:57:39,693 --> 01:57:46,098
Whatever happened last night...
l am....

904
01:57:47,134 --> 01:57:48,692
...extremely sorry.

905
02:05:38,805 --> 02:05:40,670
- basanti, here.
- y es?

906
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:46,137
Goli's goods worth millions have
been delivered to a godown at vashi.

907
02:05:46,779 --> 02:05:49,145
lf you wish, you can raid
that place right now.

908
02:05:49,649 --> 02:05:50,274
Now?

909
02:05:50,617 --> 02:05:54,246
y es, because at 4 p.m.
the goods will be shifted....

910
02:05:54,587 --> 02:05:56,817
...and delivered to
their respective dealers.

911
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:58,352
4 p.m.!

912
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,693
According to basanti, there must
be only four to five men here.

913
02:06:10,203 --> 02:06:15,106
l'm going down and you...
will stay here.

914
02:06:16,643 --> 02:06:18,577
- y ou won't come after me, okay!
- Why?

915
02:06:19,212 --> 02:06:20,975
Why not?
l will come!

916
02:06:23,316 --> 02:06:26,752
Fine. Come after me.

917
02:06:47,307 --> 02:06:49,832
Karan, if you don't release me!

918
02:09:20,226 --> 02:09:21,215
Come on!

919
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:45,708
The keys!

920
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:16,043
Quick!

921
02:10:52,084 --> 02:10:52,675
Why?

922
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,252
lf it wasn't for your
timely help, l'd have...

923
02:10:58,558 --> 02:11:05,293
by saving my life, you have proved
that you are a hero and not a zero.

924
02:11:09,602 --> 02:11:14,130
Today l saved your life. Will you
give me anything l ask for?

925
02:11:14,507 --> 02:11:15,098
What?

926
02:11:16,509 --> 02:11:21,412
Karan, l...l love your sister
and want to marry her.

927
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:47,567
Such a big loss?
Such a big loss?!

928
02:11:51,277 --> 02:11:53,837
only half an hour more.

929
02:11:56,382 --> 02:11:59,215
only half an hour more!

930
02:12:01,721 --> 02:12:05,157
And the goods would have been
delivered to the dealers.

931
02:12:10,062 --> 02:12:10,926
There's someone.

932
02:12:13,299 --> 02:12:15,028
There's someone amongst us...

933
02:12:16,702 --> 02:12:21,935
...who is a police informer.

934
02:12:41,994 --> 02:12:44,053
- y es?
- Should l say something?

935
02:12:44,564 --> 02:12:49,558
l'm getting scared. y ou go in
and l'll wait out?

936
02:12:50,603 --> 02:12:53,629
- Why?
- l've a wife and four children.

937
02:12:54,273 --> 02:12:59,210
l'm the only bread winner. And this
terrorist has committed 30 murders.

938
02:12:59,512 --> 02:13:04,347
- Thirty murders?
- lf l die they will become orphans.

939
02:13:05,284 --> 02:13:06,774
l'm getting very scared.

940
02:13:09,322 --> 02:13:11,381
What's this?

941
02:13:17,663 --> 02:13:20,188
Why are you fooling at this time?
Forget it, sir.

942
02:13:22,234 --> 02:13:23,132
What's this for?

943
02:13:24,136 --> 02:13:28,095
When the terrorist comes, you'll
lose your heel. Keep it in!

944
02:13:28,741 --> 02:13:32,643
Sir, you go in.
May God protect you.

945
02:13:41,954 --> 02:13:49,053
This is loaded.
Keep it.

946
02:13:51,197 --> 02:13:52,858
only to protect you.

947
02:13:54,734 --> 02:13:58,636
lf required, shoot only
at the leg. lf required.

948
02:14:00,072 --> 02:14:01,266
And don't come out
of the jeep.

949
02:14:04,644 --> 02:14:06,271
Don't step out of the jeep.

950
02:14:40,546 --> 02:14:41,604
Stop, or l'll shoot.
Stop!

951
02:14:42,181 --> 02:14:45,116
Stop, or l'll shoot!

952
02:14:51,657 --> 02:14:52,817
He has a machine gun!

953
02:14:58,964 --> 02:15:00,454
He is running away!
Shoot!

954
02:15:02,902 --> 02:15:05,336
Stop! Stop!

955
02:15:34,667 --> 02:15:35,565
What have you done?

956
02:15:37,636 --> 02:15:38,762
y ou shot Ramlal?!

957
02:15:40,172 --> 02:15:43,300
No! l thought it was someone else.

958
02:15:43,809 --> 02:15:46,539
Do you know the consequences of
shooting a police officer?

959
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:48,478
No.

960
02:15:49,315 --> 02:15:51,306
Didn't l tell you
not to step out of the jeep.

961
02:15:53,252 --> 02:15:55,686
Didn't l tell you to shoot
at the leg?

962
02:15:56,522 --> 02:16:00,583
Why did you shoot on the chest?
What have you done?

963
02:16:20,412 --> 02:16:22,004
l've killed a constable.

964
02:16:23,549 --> 02:16:28,248
My life, my career everything
has got ruined.

965
02:16:38,998 --> 02:16:39,896
Listen.

966
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:44,961
- Give me this revolver.
- y ou are arresting me?

967
02:16:48,941 --> 02:16:54,811
lf someone learns you've committed
this murder, you'll be hanged.

968
02:16:56,682 --> 02:16:58,081
l'll only lose my job.

969
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,819
And if l take the blame on myself,
you'll be saved.

970
02:17:07,593 --> 02:17:11,689
And so will your career.

971
02:17:13,732 --> 02:17:15,256
At the most...

972
02:17:15,734 --> 02:17:23,038
... l'll lose my job and will
be sentenced for a year or two.

973
02:17:25,811 --> 02:17:29,508
y ou must leave
this city and go away.

974
02:17:30,749 --> 02:17:34,378
Forget that such a thing ever
happened or you saw it happen.

975
02:17:36,655 --> 02:17:42,116
l'll handle everything.
Nothing will happen to you.

976
02:17:42,795 --> 02:17:44,763
Nothing.

977
02:17:46,198 --> 02:17:51,932
Give all kind of monetary
support to Ramlal and his family.

978
02:17:52,137 --> 02:17:53,468
l've explained everything
to my secretary.

979
02:17:54,406 --> 02:17:58,775
Appoint a nice lawyer, if you want.
Don't worry about the money.

980
02:17:59,445 --> 02:18:01,037
one minute. Take this.

981
02:18:02,414 --> 02:18:07,010
l'll be here for a few days.
Do keep me informed.

982
02:18:07,786 --> 02:18:10,311
And Karan, l'll phone you
after every half an hour.

983
02:18:10,656 --> 02:18:13,682
Don't make that mistake.
because the lines will be tapped.

984
02:18:14,293 --> 02:18:17,660
lf someone hears our conversation,
we'll be sentenced for a year or two.

985
02:18:18,797 --> 02:18:19,764
okay, l won't phone.

986
02:18:50,462 --> 02:18:53,090
Wait, Deepak.
What are you doing?

987
02:18:53,899 --> 02:18:58,336
Karan, on one hand, is staking
his life and his career.

988
02:18:59,038 --> 02:19:01,871
And you are running
away like a coward?

989
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:05,677
ls your conscience dead?

990
02:19:06,412 --> 02:19:09,870
y ou love Shivangi a lot, don't you?
Then how will you face her?

991
02:19:10,482 --> 02:19:13,849
Get up, Deepak.
And confess to your crime!

992
02:19:32,638 --> 02:19:36,301
He was shaking with fear.

993
02:19:36,775 --> 02:19:40,370
He placed his head on my stomach.
l was getting tickled

994
02:19:40,713 --> 02:19:42,112
... l was about to jump.

995
02:19:43,415 --> 02:19:46,475
Thank God, l didn't. or the
truth would have been unveiled.

996
02:19:48,053 --> 02:19:50,647
but one thing is for sure, sir.

997
02:19:51,757 --> 02:19:56,524
The way you drove him out of the city,
he'll remember all his life...

998
02:19:56,962 --> 02:19:59,954
that even police officers
are good actors.

999
02:20:00,766 --> 02:20:03,758
- Who is it?
- lt's you. okay, tell me something.

1000
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:09,297
l loaded fake bullets in the revolver.
but how did you start bleeding?

1001
02:20:10,175 --> 02:20:12,609
- Was that blood?
- Then what was it?

1002
02:20:12,978 --> 02:20:14,240
Tomato ketchup.

1003
02:20:16,181 --> 02:20:23,144
l filled it in a plastic bag and kept
it here, and pressed it like this.

1004
02:20:23,922 --> 02:20:25,389
And seeing the ketchup,
he lost his senses.

1005
02:20:29,595 --> 02:20:32,223
- Sir, only one clap.
- Put your vest in.

1006
02:20:32,698 --> 02:20:36,259
To hell with the vest.
l feel like jumping with joy.

1007
02:20:38,871 --> 02:20:40,361
How he ran for his life!

1008
02:20:42,307 --> 02:20:46,175
Let alone coming here,
his plane won't even...

1009
02:20:49,081 --> 02:20:53,245
- What is it?
- The plane has landed, sir.

1010
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:55,309
Landed? Where?

1011
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:17,072
This vest has become too long.
l'll go and change it.

1012
02:21:21,847 --> 02:21:22,677
So last night....

1013
02:21:24,917 --> 02:21:27,078
...we were out to nab
a dangerous terrorist?

1014
02:21:28,554 --> 02:21:32,046
And l shot your constable
by mistake?

1015
02:21:36,261 --> 02:21:38,024
y ou did a great favor to me.

1016
02:21:39,698 --> 02:21:43,190
y ou took the revolver from me
and put your finger prints on it?

1017
02:21:47,906 --> 02:21:49,874
Look, next time you raise
your hand...

1018
02:21:50,275 --> 02:21:54,644
Let alone beating you, l can
get you arrested for fraud!

1019
02:21:55,614 --> 02:21:58,412
y ou claim to be an inspector?!
A police officer!

1020
02:21:58,817 --> 02:22:01,581
but you are a cheat!

1021
02:22:02,387 --> 02:22:05,879
And you and your cheap constable
were making fun of me?!

1022
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:15,430
l was crazy about you, because
you were a complete man!

1023
02:22:16,268 --> 02:22:21,672
by aping your style, your walk,
l wanted to win an award!

1024
02:22:22,708 --> 02:22:24,903
but...but now l won't.

1025
02:22:26,111 --> 02:22:28,272
because l don't like
aping fakes.

1026
02:22:29,515 --> 02:22:34,680
Just once you should have caught
me by my collar slapped me...

1027
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:40,952
...and asked me, how dare
l fell in love with your sister?

1028
02:22:42,227 --> 02:22:46,129
l would have beseeched you.

1029
02:22:46,999 --> 02:22:51,936
Fallen at your feet and asked
your sister's hand in marriage.

1030
02:22:54,173 --> 02:22:59,543
but no. Tears can melt hearts but
not stone-hearted people like you.

1031
02:23:00,546 --> 02:23:02,776
y ou are a heartless, ruthless
shrewd person!

1032
02:23:03,248 --> 02:23:06,046
y ou neither care about your sister
nor her love nor her happiness!

1033
02:23:07,719 --> 02:23:09,243
And not even her future!

1034
02:23:10,789 --> 02:23:16,659
Mr. inspector, first learn to protect
hearts. y ou may then protect the law!

1035
02:23:17,763 --> 02:23:22,359
lf moving around with guns and
acting tough is duty for you...

1036
02:23:23,101 --> 02:23:25,831
Then you are wrong!
lt's your pride and ego!

1037
02:23:26,738 --> 02:23:28,797
We call it the act of a bully.

1038
02:23:34,646 --> 02:23:38,082
y ou wanted me to go away
from your life, didn't you?

1039
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:42,680
And your sister's life too?
All right. l'm going away! Forever!

1040
02:23:43,055 --> 02:23:46,957
be happy, and if possible
let others also be happy.

1041
02:23:59,271 --> 02:24:05,232
lf l have made any mistake
unknowingly, then do forgive me.

1042
02:24:10,282 --> 02:24:14,013
Take care.

1043
02:24:43,782 --> 02:24:45,716
Are you happy now?

1044
02:24:46,652 --> 02:24:50,782
Are you happy, having broken
your kid sister's heart?

1045
02:24:52,624 --> 02:24:55,286
y ou claim to be her elder brother!

1046
02:24:57,029 --> 02:25:03,332
but have you ever asked her what she
wants, have you ever sat with her?

1047
02:25:05,704 --> 02:25:09,071
y ou didn't fulfill your duty
but l will fulfill mine!

1048
02:25:09,975 --> 02:25:12,409
l'm not only her sister-in-law,
but her mother too.

1049
02:25:13,578 --> 02:25:19,710
And Deepak is the right choice
as a son-in-law!

1050
02:25:20,886 --> 02:25:27,985
lf someone else comes to marry her,
l won't be alive to welcome him.

1051
02:25:29,861 --> 02:25:33,194
Had he been alive, then his decision
would have also been the same, Karan.

1052
02:25:46,345 --> 02:25:47,312
Dhansukh, where's Deepak?

1053
02:25:48,347 --> 02:25:52,181
He went upstairs. He was in a
bad mood. Anything wrong?

1054
02:25:53,418 --> 02:25:57,354
Actually, l've come to seek
an alliance for my sister.

1055
02:25:57,856 --> 02:26:01,383
- That's good news.
- l don't accept this alliance!

1056
02:26:08,367 --> 02:26:10,062
l do!
And l will, till my last breath!

1057
02:26:10,369 --> 02:26:13,998
but what you did with me,
l can't forget all my life!

1058
02:26:17,776 --> 02:26:20,210
- l know l made a small mistake.
- Small mistake?!

1059
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:26,182
Had l not returned from the airport,
you had almost got rid of me!

1060
02:26:28,186 --> 02:26:34,887
but my conscience told me that Karan
is giving such a big sacrifice.

1061
02:26:35,293 --> 02:26:38,990
He's staking his life.
Go back, Deepak!

1062
02:26:40,866 --> 02:26:46,065
And when l returned l saw this!
What did you think l was?!

1063
02:26:46,438 --> 02:26:50,204
Deepak, you can't do this!
y ou can't play with Shivangi's life!

1064
02:26:50,509 --> 02:26:52,977
- y ou have got to marry her!
- l won't! What will you do?

1065
02:26:53,245 --> 02:26:54,075
l...

1066
02:26:58,984 --> 02:27:02,317
What can l do?
Nothing.

1067
02:27:04,523 --> 02:27:05,581
Nothing.

1068
02:27:11,096 --> 02:27:13,758
- on one condition.
- What?

1069
02:27:15,333 --> 02:27:19,133
First smile and say please.

1070
02:27:28,046 --> 02:27:29,741
Smile, Karan.

1071
02:34:26,598 --> 02:34:30,762
- Get up, Ramlal.
- No, sir.

1072
02:34:31,903 --> 02:34:36,101
lt's time to leave the world.

1073
02:34:36,341 --> 02:34:38,468
- Don't joke, Ramlal!
- No, sir.

1074
02:34:40,211 --> 02:34:45,080
l'm not joking, sir.
l've been really shot.

1075
02:34:46,417 --> 02:34:51,650
Today l learnt how painful it is
when you get really shot.

1076
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:55,257
- Nothing will happen to you. Get up!
- No, sir.

1077
02:34:58,730 --> 02:35:03,258
Sir, will you do me a favor?

1078
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:08,138
- What?
- Won't you tell me?

1079
02:35:09,007 --> 02:35:12,670
Ramlal, go and tuck your vest in!

1080
02:35:13,378 --> 02:35:17,508
Say it, sir.

1081
02:35:21,386 --> 02:35:22,478
No.

1082
02:35:28,793 --> 02:35:34,163
What's this? Such a short meeting?
We had just met.

1083
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:37,031
And he left?

1084
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:16,636
Friends! From today they
are my foreign partners.

1085
02:36:17,675 --> 02:36:22,169
They do the same business in their
country which we do here.

1086
02:36:23,681 --> 02:36:26,275
They don't stay anywhere for more
than an hour or two.

1087
02:36:27,118 --> 02:36:29,552
because they are wanted by
the police all over the world!

1088
02:36:30,355 --> 02:36:32,721
Soon they will leave.

1089
02:36:33,725 --> 02:36:36,888
So l wanted you to meet them.

1090
02:36:37,729 --> 02:36:41,426
because many of you will have to
go to their country for business.

1091
02:36:52,844 --> 02:36:56,371
Come, Mr. Peter. l'll introduce
you to my partners.

1092
02:36:57,015 --> 02:37:00,041
This is Mr. Ram Mohan.
This is Mr. Peter.

1093
02:38:08,786 --> 02:38:13,246
basanti here.
l have found proof against Goli.

1094
02:38:16,227 --> 02:38:18,286
Mona just left from here,
she had camera in her hand

1095
02:38:18,596 --> 02:38:19,255
What?

1096
02:38:25,503 --> 02:38:28,131
Someone has made a call to the
police station from here, sir.

1097
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:31,638
- From which room?
- 402. From Mona's room.

1098
02:38:31,976 --> 02:38:32,840
What nonsense?!

1099
02:38:33,244 --> 02:38:36,839
- She is on line!
- Put me through.

1100
02:38:41,519 --> 02:38:45,853
This roll contains all the black
deeds of these smugglers.

1101
02:38:46,624 --> 02:38:47,613
And not only that.

1102
02:38:48,226 --> 02:38:54,495
With the help of these picture you can
easily arrest Goli and his men.

1103
02:38:55,233 --> 02:38:56,962
This is the best opportunity.

1104
02:38:57,735 --> 02:39:01,535
Through this roll, you can
get to your brother's killer.

1105
02:39:02,306 --> 02:39:05,503
- And send them to the gallows.
- Hi, love.

1106
02:39:10,181 --> 02:39:12,581
l'll call you later.

1107
02:39:17,822 --> 02:39:18,914
Whom were you talking to?

1108
02:39:20,057 --> 02:39:24,255
A...a friend of mine.

1109
02:39:40,711 --> 02:39:43,680
Where is the roll?

1110
02:39:46,217 --> 02:39:47,206
Which roll?

1111
02:39:52,957 --> 02:40:00,557
Then why is there sweat on
your brow so beautiful?

1112
02:40:02,533 --> 02:40:04,023
What are you saying?

1113
02:40:08,005 --> 02:40:12,601
Don't you believe your Mona?

1114
02:40:31,696 --> 02:40:34,164
l was wondering...

1115
02:40:35,533 --> 02:40:43,963
...how our goods were being seized,
despite all the secrecy.

1116
02:40:45,042 --> 02:40:49,376
And who has been giving information
to inspector Karan?

1117
02:40:49,914 --> 02:40:53,748
So it's you!
y ou!

1118
02:41:13,571 --> 02:41:15,801
l loved Mona very much.

1119
02:41:17,441 --> 02:41:19,500
When l could kill her with
my very hands....

1120
02:41:20,745 --> 02:41:24,306
...you ...you are just her
look alike.

1121
02:41:25,850 --> 02:41:27,818
lmagine what l'll do to you.

1122
02:41:34,458 --> 02:41:38,451
Tell me, where's the roll?

1123
02:41:39,997 --> 02:41:42,329
Look here and tell me
where is the roll?!

1124
02:41:44,101 --> 02:41:48,435
- Where it should have reached!
- Where?!

1125
02:41:51,342 --> 02:41:54,277
To inspector Joglekar!

1126
02:42:24,475 --> 02:42:30,277
- There's bad news for you.
- What nonsense are you talking?

1127
02:42:34,785 --> 02:42:39,654
y our basanti is in my custody.

1128
02:42:41,926 --> 02:42:44,087
l'll tell you later
who l am.

1129
02:42:45,196 --> 02:42:49,132
- First give me the roll.
- Roll?! Which roll?

1130
02:42:51,736 --> 02:42:54,671
or l'll cut your basanti
into pieces...

1131
02:42:54,905 --> 02:42:59,069
...and throw her in the courtyard
of your police station.

1132
02:43:02,380 --> 02:43:03,404
but the roll...

1133
02:43:05,182 --> 02:43:08,208
So inspector, are you dumbfounded?

1134
02:43:09,086 --> 02:43:13,750
- l want an answer.
- okay, l'll give you the roll.

1135
02:43:14,358 --> 02:43:16,292
but nothing should happen
to basanti.

1136
02:43:17,595 --> 02:43:19,893
Tell me, where must l bring it?

1137
02:43:24,368 --> 02:43:27,633
Listen carefully.

1138
02:43:34,912 --> 02:43:36,072
ls basanti okay?

1139
02:43:39,884 --> 02:43:41,215
basanti's life is in danger.

1140
02:43:42,987 --> 02:43:47,617
They want the roll, which they
didn't find it with basanti.

1141
02:43:49,093 --> 02:43:52,722
They think l have it.
but where do l get it from?

1142
02:43:53,964 --> 02:43:56,330
- The usual trick!
- Meaning?

1143
02:43:56,567 --> 02:43:59,468
buy any roll from the market.
Till they develop it...

1144
02:43:59,737 --> 02:44:01,830
- ...we'll get her released.
- How can...

1145
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:09,204
We shouldn't underestimate
our enemies.

1146
02:44:10,347 --> 02:44:14,977
We'll take the roll,
but my way.

1147
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:18,611
l might escape from the
police here.

1148
02:44:20,057 --> 02:44:25,620
but the police abroad will
find me at any cost.

1149
02:44:26,997 --> 02:44:28,965
They won't spare me.

1150
02:45:49,947 --> 02:45:52,006
y ou think Karan is a fool?!

1151
02:45:52,950 --> 02:45:55,475
lf l don't leave with basanti
in ten minutes...

1152
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:58,620
...he will be here with the
entire police force.

1153
02:46:15,472 --> 02:46:16,632
Where is the roll?

1154
02:46:31,655 --> 02:46:32,952
Get it here.

1155
02:46:35,426 --> 02:46:37,053
First show me basanti.

1156
02:46:51,241 --> 02:46:54,972
Look, l've got another
gift for you.

1157
02:46:55,879 --> 02:46:59,144
Which will make you come to me
running like a small child.

1158
02:47:00,217 --> 02:47:01,206
Look.

1159
02:47:41,825 --> 02:47:45,420
Hey actor.
Where are you going?

1160
02:47:47,064 --> 02:47:49,123
y ou think l'm a fool?

1161
02:47:50,067 --> 02:47:54,231
First the roll will be developed,
then printed...

1162
02:47:55,172 --> 02:48:00,838
...the photographs will be seen
and then they will be released.

1163
02:48:05,315 --> 02:48:07,215
Deepak, move!

1164
02:48:44,021 --> 02:48:45,147
Stop those scoundrels!

1165
02:48:49,193 --> 02:48:49,784
Quick!

1166
02:49:42,112 --> 02:49:43,306
blast the tire!

1167
02:49:59,663 --> 02:50:00,425
Come out!

1168
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:04,030
Move!

1169
02:50:57,521 --> 02:50:58,818
lt's very painful, isn't it?

1170
02:51:00,757 --> 02:51:04,523
Actually you have also caused me
terrible pain in my life.

1171
02:51:05,696 --> 02:51:06,663
Therefore...

1172
02:51:08,165 --> 02:51:13,193
...there's a strange intoxication
in causing you pain.

1173
02:51:14,371 --> 02:51:15,531
l like it.

1174
02:51:17,774 --> 02:51:21,266
l'm enjoying.

1175
02:51:39,830 --> 02:51:42,697
Look, tell me where the roll is!

1176
02:51:44,301 --> 02:51:50,831
or you will undergo this torture
for a week.

1177
02:51:52,309 --> 02:51:57,941
l might get tired.
but he is a devil.

1178
02:52:00,550 --> 02:52:02,814
Let alone a week.

1179
02:52:04,488 --> 02:52:09,585
Continue this even for a year!
yet l won't give you the roll.

1180
02:52:11,161 --> 02:52:12,287
l won't!

1181
02:52:12,829 --> 02:52:14,888
Why do you want to
torture yourself to death?

1182
02:52:15,732 --> 02:52:20,294
Die like your brother died.
An easy death.

1183
02:52:23,607 --> 02:52:25,097
y ou know how your brother died?

1184
02:52:26,510 --> 02:52:30,810
At my behest, he pumped five
bullets into him.

1185
02:52:33,150 --> 02:52:36,085
He was torn to shreds.

1186
02:52:37,888 --> 02:52:41,221
y ou see this loyal
servant of mine?

1187
02:52:43,293 --> 02:52:44,954
He is very heartless.

1188
02:52:49,333 --> 02:52:51,767
bloody hell, don't hit me
on my face!

1189
02:52:52,202 --> 02:52:56,662
y ou know the value of my face is
more than your master's factory.

1190
02:53:28,739 --> 02:53:34,769
Never mind. When he comes around,
start the torture again.

1191
02:53:36,513 --> 02:53:38,378
He won't acquiesce so soon.

1192
02:58:25,769 --> 02:58:30,502
be it in film or reality, hero always
rescues the damsel in distress.

1193
02:58:35,512 --> 02:58:36,376
Hurry up.

1194
02:58:50,660 --> 02:58:51,524
Wait.

1195
02:59:36,106 --> 02:59:37,733
Come on out!

1196
02:59:38,708 --> 02:59:43,839
or your artist friend won't be alive
to perform before the world!

1197
02:59:44,614 --> 02:59:49,779
Come out! or l'll kill everybody!

1198
02:59:54,624 --> 02:59:55,818
Come out!

1199
03:01:07,464 --> 03:01:10,160
Ask me what fear is?!
When l leave home in the morning.

1200
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:13,569
l'm not sure whether l'll return
home in the evening or no!

1201
03:01:15,004 --> 03:01:19,464
l can't say at which crossroad
death waits to maim me!

1202
03:01:20,176 --> 03:01:24,340
He's saying exactly what l told him!
y es, exactly the same!

1203
03:01:26,816 --> 03:01:29,250
- Sir, he has copied...
- be quiet.

1204
03:01:41,197 --> 03:01:44,098
- Where are you going?
- l don't want to see this film.

1205
03:01:59,849 --> 03:02:00,816
Nice film, isn't it?

1206
03:02:26,175 --> 03:02:27,369
ls something is burning?
