01:24:55,711 --> 01:24:56,748
I want to meet him.

1077
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,085
Father!

1078
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,743
Oh, father!

1079
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,925
I think, I have seen you somewhere.

1080
01:25:34,475 --> 01:25:35,832
Sir, my name is Jai.

1081
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:38,098
Those flowers that you sent to Sonia.

1082
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,495
They were delivered by me.

1083
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:41,287
Oh.

1084
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,263
The shoes are dirty.

1085
01:25:58,961 --> 01:26:02,416
Don’t hesitate, carpet can be changed.

1086
01:26:03,228 --> 01:26:04,882
Sonia bought it from Iran.

1087
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,549
She is fond of buying
new and beautiful things.

1088
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:10,809
Well.

1089
01:26:12,982 --> 01:26:14,699
- Sir, this.
- Keep it with you.

1090
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,135
Decorate them in Sonia’s
room with your own hands.

1091
01:26:18,915 --> 01:26:21,727
She has gone out to
take care of your dinner.

1092
01:26:22,312 --> 01:26:23,541
She must be back soon.

1093
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:26,014
What work do you do?

1094
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:29,506
Sir, I can do any such work.
That is not possible for anyone else.

1095
01:26:29,754 --> 01:26:32,140
This means, you don’t
do anything worthwhile.

1096
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,064
Come. Let me show you Sonia’s room.

1097
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:39,572
These areSonia’s clothes.

1098
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:41,926
She is very fond of clothes.

1099
01:26:44,459 --> 01:26:45,641
Do you see this saree?

1100
01:26:46,293 --> 01:26:48,352
It’s embellished withdiamonds and pearls.

1101
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:49,678
She got it from Paris.

1102
01:26:51,363 --> 01:26:53,344
What will you do by knowing the price?

1103
01:26:54,705 --> 01:26:56,842
You must have seen it for the first time.

1104
01:27:00,357 --> 01:27:02,703
All these shoes and
footwear, belong to Sonia.

1105
01:27:03,406 --> 01:27:06,482
She just wears them a couple
of times, and throws them away.

1106
01:27:09,327 --> 01:27:11,265
These shoes reminded me of something.

1107
01:27:12,263 --> 01:27:15,517
A person always buys a
shoe, which is fit for his feet.

1108
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:18,492
No one buys, a smaller or a bigger one.

1109
01:27:19,172 --> 01:27:21,257
The subject of marriage is also similar.

1110
01:27:22,073 --> 01:27:24,315
People look for alliance
in equal households.

1111
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:25,711
Not in bigger or smaller ones.

1112
01:27:25,753 --> 01:27:27,500
Sir, Sonia knows about my income.

1113
01:27:27,836 --> 01:27:30,651
She understands the difference
between love and wealth.

1114
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:32,349
I will keep her like a flower, sir.

1115
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:34,737
You can make her happy
with the magic of love.

1116
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,097
But can’t give her lifelong happiness.

1117
01:27:37,743 --> 01:27:40,811
Sonia is an innocent girl,
been raised in the lap of luxury.

1118
01:27:40,853 --> 01:27:42,334
Your delicate shoulders of love...

1119
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:44,362
...can’t take the burden
of demands and tantrums.

1120
01:27:44,403 --> 01:27:45,608
Only wealth can do that.

1121
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:47,149
Sir, I request you.

1122
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:49,338
Don’t weigh my love with gold and pearls.

1123
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:51,152
- We both…
- I know it pretty well.

1124
01:27:52,115 --> 01:27:53,992
The purpose of poor guys like you...

1125
01:27:54,518 --> 01:27:56,594
...is only to sweet talk
girls of wealthy households.

1126
01:27:56,636 --> 01:27:58,565
And to get their money, nothing else.

1127
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,270
Your love is fake, it’s a drama.

1128
01:28:01,453 --> 01:28:03,519
Sir, if it’s about wealth?

1129
01:28:03,721 --> 01:28:05,426
Then tell me, how much
wealth should I earn?

1130
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:08,178
That you will be able to
give Sonia’s hand into mine.

1131
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:11,306
Even if you become the
richest man of the world.

1132
01:28:11,937 --> 01:28:14,401
I still won’t give
Sonia’s hand into yours.

1133
01:28:15,648 --> 01:28:17,577
Because even if someone becomes rich.

1134
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:21,198
Yet the stench of poverty, doesn’t go
away from them, for at least, 40 years.

1135
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,204
Rich man.

1136
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:23,905
Even I have a tongue.

1137
01:28:24,411 --> 01:28:26,128
The poor only have a tongue.

1138
01:28:26,371 --> 01:28:27,284
What else can they have?

1139
01:28:27,326 --> 01:28:31,742
And to get hold of rogues like you.
We keep strong hands too.

Jai, what has got into you?

1143
01:28:41,672 --> 01:28:44,050
You have a lot of pride
on your unreliable wealth.

1144
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:46,104
Just a day’s hunger,
and an hour of thirst.

1145
01:28:46,145 --> 01:28:49,445
Removes this gap between rich and poor.

1146

You will have to chose one among us.

1152
01:29:13,537 --> 01:29:15,744
Before taking a blind step, do remember.

go away from my heart.

Keep it safe from the world.

1248
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:20,712
Do remember my fire, beloved.

1249
01:37:21,275 --> 01:37:26,702
Always keep it in your heart, hidden.

1250
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:31,827
Even if the whole
universe puts all its force.

1251
01:37:32,033 --> 01:37:37,430
We won’t be separated, even when apart.

1252
01:37:37,624 --> 01:37:42,854
I want to make love to you,
that’s what my heart desires.

1253
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:47,664
What has happened to me, today my beloved?

1254
01:37:48,025 --> 01:37:53,295
Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled.

1255
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:58,533
Have some pity on my youth, heartless.

1256
01:37:58,886 --> 01:38:03,938
I want to make love to you,
that’s what my heart desires.

1257
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:09,598
What has happened to me, today my beloved?

1258
01:38:20,724 --> 01:38:25,941
Comeover now, by leaving your world.

1259
01:38:26,113 --> 01:38:31,493
Atleast listen to my heart’s wish.

1260
01:38:31,688 --> 01:38:37,070
Love is God, I swear to God.

1261
01:38:37,312 --> 01:38:42,520
How will humans be able
to take it away from us?

1262
01:38:42,864 --> 01:38:48,072
I have written your name on my youth.

1263
01:38:48,177 --> 01:38:53,578
I want to make love to you,
that’s what my heart desires.

1264
01:38:53,868 --> 01:38:58,599
What has happened to me, today my beloved?

1265
01:38:58,825 --> 01:39:03,696
Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled.

1266
01:39:04,072 --> 01:39:09,298
Have some pity, on my youth, heartless.

1267
01:39:09,618 --> 01:39:14,562
I want to make love to you,
that’s what my heart desires.

1268
01:39:14,904 --> 01:39:20,243
You are my life, you are my universe?

1269
01:39:20,347 --> 01:39:25,521
Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled.

1270
01:39:25,827 --> 01:39:30,777
Have some pity, on my youth, heartless.

1271
01:39:31,008 --> 01:39:36,214
I want to make love to you,
that’s what my heart desires.

1272
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:43,216
You are my life, you are my universe?

1273
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:57,115
Stop.

1274
01:40:10,532 --> 01:40:11,383
Raju, you?

1275
01:40:11,578 --> 01:40:14,051
I am the ASP of this area.

1276
01:40:14,155 --> 01:40:14,989
Hhmm.

1277
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:18,280
And you ned to address me as, sir.

1278
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:21,479
You met me as a dead man...

1279
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,582
...or I would have peeled off your skin.

1280
01:40:25,358 --> 01:40:28,799
The mischief that you did to me,
its debt is still pending with me.

1281
01:40:28,986 --> 01:40:32,427
If you will ever get life back in you.
I will pay my debt for sure.

1282
01:40:32,715 --> 01:40:34,819
I am getting married to Sonia.

1283
01:40:39,964 --> 01:40:42,140
If you bring Sonia’s
name onto your tongue...

1284
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:44,267
...I will beat you till you become dumb.

1285
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:16,537
You are acting really oversmart.

1286
01:41:16,995 --> 01:41:19,879
I am telling you for the
last time, forget about Sonia.

1287
01:41:21,897 --> 01:41:25,655
If you will take Sonia’s name,
I will make your life difficult.

1288
01:41:32,046 --> 01:41:35,960
Remember you have tied
my hands not my confidence.

1289
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:01,109
Throw him outside his home.

1290
01:42:18,527 --> 01:42:19,361
What?

1291
01:42:19,522 --> 01:42:20,859
What has happened to you?

1292
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:22,127
Mother.

1293
01:42:22,231 --> 01:42:24,361
- He had hit the ASP.
- So what?

1294
01:42:24,582 --> 01:42:26,311
Why did he beat him so cruelly?

1295
01:42:26,622 --> 01:42:27,876
Come. Come son.

1296
01:42:28,055 --> 01:42:28,930
Get up, son.

1297
01:42:29,346 --> 01:42:30,652
Come.

1298
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:44,373
What’s left that you have come to tell me?

1299
01:42:44,415 --> 01:42:46,911
Now, you might have
known what the truth is.

1300
01:42:47,072 --> 01:42:48,298
And what was the lie.

1301
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:49,444
And?

1302
01:42:49,697 --> 01:42:50,665
Didn’t I say that.

1303
01:42:50,989 --> 01:42:54,824
My grandson, can’t do a dirty
thing like abducting someone.

1304
01:42:55,173 --> 01:42:56,007
And?

1305
01:42:56,213 --> 01:42:59,990
Jai and Sonia, love each
other with all their heart.

1306
01:43:00,483 --> 01:43:01,105
And?

1307
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:03,332
Jai has become disheartened from life.

1308
01:43:04,205 --> 01:43:05,039
I,

1309
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,630
I have come here. To ask for the alliance.

1310
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:11,628
Before making a wish like this.

1311
01:43:12,649 --> 01:43:15,963
It would had been better, if you would
had looked at your status at least once.

1312
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:17,642
We are not as per your status.

1313
01:43:18,141 --> 01:43:19,792
But with the grace of God.

1314
01:43:20,128 --> 01:43:24,044
We are not that poor, that
we have to live hand to mouth.

1315
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:27,999
I promise you, I will take
care of Sonia as a queen.

1316
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:32,117
I believe in realities, not in
words What’s your status?

1317
01:43:32,369 --> 01:43:34,680
What do you know about our status?

1318
01:43:34,815 --> 01:43:36,746
That you live in a rented home.

1319
01:43:37,102 --> 01:43:39,292
No land, no property. Not even a business.

1320
01:43:39,501 --> 01:43:40,535
And on top of that.

1321
01:43:40,734 --> 01:43:42,611
The guy is unemployed and shameless.

1322
01:43:42,745 --> 01:43:43,480
At one side there is this king.

1323
01:43:43,585 --> 01:43:45,348
And on the other the pennyless guy.

1324
01:43:45,389 --> 01:43:46,292
Wow.

1325
01:43:47,292 --> 01:43:48,648
Your boy said something...

1326
01:43:48,711 --> 01:43:50,982
...and you just found just
my door to ask for an alliance?

1327
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,090
Stop!

1328
01:43:52,472 --> 01:43:53,787
You have said enough.

1329
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:57,556
Money and status are temporary.

1330
01:43:58,434 --> 01:44:01,019
You have not yet recognised our decency.

1331
01:44:01,246 --> 01:44:04,102
Your decency was broken
into pieces on that day itself.

1332
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:07,193
The day you spoke mannerlessly with me.

1333
01:44:08,234 --> 01:44:09,968
I remember every word.

1334
01:44:10,232 --> 01:44:12,109
Then you would also have remembered.

1335
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:15,835
The day you came with your
daughter’s desire to my home.

1336
01:44:16,391 --> 01:44:18,956
I took away my grandson’s
happiness and gave the horse to you.

1337
01:44:18,998 --> 01:44:20,631
It was an animal’s child.

1338
01:44:21,184 --> 01:44:22,877
Sonia is my child.

1339
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,488
She is a part of my heart.

1340
01:44:25,665 --> 01:44:29,084
Wearing the mask of decency,
to do away with your problems.

1341
01:44:29,188 --> 01:44:31,273
You have come here to crack a good deal.

1342
01:44:31,315 --> 01:44:32,300
Pyare Singh.

1343
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:33,824
Let’s go from here.

1344
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:36,680
But a market.

1345
01:44:36,785 --> 01:44:39,103
Relationships are bought and sold here.

1346
01:44:42,186 --> 01:44:43,209
Even in the time of crisis...

1347
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,066
...the decency of a decent
man doesn’t become any less.

1348
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,681
Even if you make 100 pieces of gold...

1349
01:44:48,897 --> 01:44:51,034
...the value of gold doesn’t become less.

1350
01:44:54,245 --> 01:44:55,416
Take this sir.

1351
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:58,123
Here is the approval for your factory.

1352
01:44:58,507 --> 01:44:59,915
This is the import licence.

1353
01:45:00,249 --> 01:45:01,865
And this is the export licence.

1354
01:45:02,242 --> 01:45:04,391
I have fulfilled my promise.

1355
01:45:04,617 --> 01:45:05,849
Thanks a lot.

1356
01:45:06,058 --> 01:45:07,935
Your gift will be sent to your home.

1357
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:09,904
Whatever needs to be given to others.
You give it on your own.

1358
01:45:09,946 --> 01:45:11,082
Thanks a lot.

1359
01:45:11,956 --> 01:45:13,103
Hey. Come, come Sarin.

1360
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:14,686
You too came at a good time.

1361
01:45:14,728 --> 01:45:16,031
It’s something important.

1362
01:45:16,211 --> 01:45:18,366
Aah... I will come back later.

1363
01:45:18,631 --> 01:45:20,612
Mr Dhanraj is also our special friend.

1364
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:21,914
What do we have to hide from him?

1365
01:45:21,956 --> 01:45:24,626
The advertisement that we gave.
For Sonia’s matrimonial alliance.

1366
01:45:24,668 --> 01:45:26,180
These are the replies for it.

1367
01:45:26,411 --> 01:45:28,601
These are a few
pictures shortlisted by me.

1368
01:45:29,646 --> 01:45:31,350
Is there anyone, who is
worthy enough to be replied?

1369
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:32,488
Not actually…

1370
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:33,840
These are just OK, Okay.

1371
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:34,935
Hhmm.

1372
01:45:35,239 --> 01:45:37,627
Then give out the advertisement, in
the newspapers of London and America.

1373
01:45:37,668 --> 01:45:38,868
I was also thinking that.

1374
01:45:38,909 --> 01:45:40,535
Even I have a photograph.

1375
01:45:41,988 --> 01:45:44,178
- This is your son.
- He is the only child.

1376
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:47,384
The only heir of my wealth.
He is even well settled.

1377
01:45:47,593 --> 01:45:49,105
Yes, he is not a businessman.

1378
01:45:49,306 --> 01:45:51,235
But if you wish you can make him one.

1379
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:54,306
My son stays at your place
or mine after the wedding.

1380
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:55,918
It’s one and the same thing.

1381
01:45:56,407 --> 01:45:59,001
We politicians, don’t break the ties.

1382
01:45:59,237 --> 01:46:01,278
We mend the ties.

1383
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:04,055
Why am I kept imprisoned in this house?

1384
01:46:04,722 --> 01:46:06,494
I have started feeling suffocated.

1385
01:46:06,614 --> 01:46:07,985
With whom shall I talk?

1386
01:46:08,089 --> 01:46:09,027
I am here, child.

1387
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:11,979
When do you have any time
from your lakhs and crores...

1388
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,465
...that you will talk to me?

1389
01:46:13,506 --> 01:46:14,901
You have become really spoilt.

1390
01:46:14,943 --> 01:46:16,455
For whom am I doing all this?

1391
01:46:16,653 --> 01:46:17,959
For your wellbeing only.

1392
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:20,717
I don’t want money but love, father.

1393
01:46:21,329 --> 01:46:22,632
A sense of belongingness.

1394
01:46:26,883 --> 01:46:29,073
I think her schooling has been done wrong.

1395
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:35,364
Dildara. Where is Jai?

1396
01:46:36,648 --> 01:46:37,482
Tell Jai.

1397
01:46:37,623 --> 01:46:40,021
To immediately come to
Delhi and take me along.

1398
01:47:05,582 --> 01:47:08,077
What happened, Dildara? What’s the matter?

1399
01:47:13,624 --> 01:47:14,458
Dildara.

1400
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:17,186
What’s this?

1401
01:47:30,716 --> 01:47:31,610
Sonia?

1402
01:48:20,316 --> 01:48:21,151
Sonia.

1403
01:48:24,889 --> 01:48:26,279
Sonia, daughter.

1404
01:48:31,878 --> 01:48:33,076
Sonia.

1405
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:35,515
Jai.

1406
01:48:36,133 --> 01:48:37,216
Sonia.

1407
01:48:38,206 --> 01:48:38,773
Sonia.

1408
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:40,598
Let’s get out of here fast. Fast.

1409
01:48:40,865 --> 01:48:41,699
Come.

1410
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:50,333
[TRAIN HORN BLARING]

1411
01:49:06,049 --> 01:49:06,883
Hey.

1412
01:49:20,746 --> 01:49:23,805
Grandmother, this is Sonia.

1413
01:49:30,266 --> 01:49:32,560
So, at last, you fulfilled
your stubbornness.

1414
01:49:33,104 --> 01:49:34,616
Now, see my stubbornness too.

1415
01:49:35,155 --> 01:49:37,746
I can’t give a place to such a girl.
One who has eloped.

1416
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:39,765
Grandmother, you are getting it wrong.

1417
01:49:39,806 --> 01:49:41,058
I have not abducted her.

1418
01:49:41,769 --> 01:49:42,603
Grandmother.

1419
01:49:42,766 --> 01:49:44,499
I have come with Jai with my consent.

1420
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,365
You should not have come, daughter.

1421

02:01:04,519 --> 02:01:06,872
...who doesnít remember
God, in their luxury?

1599
02:01:07,132 --> 02:01:09,289
And doesnít fear God, in their ego?

1600
02:01:10,596 --> 02:01:12,989
The path on which
Sonia has started walking.

1601
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:14,240
Itís her own destiny.

1602
02:01:16,298 --> 02:01:20,090
Sir, a human can fight everyone.

1603
02:01:20,747 --> 02:01:23,164
But they canít fight, their own destiny.

1604
02:01:27,145 --> 02:01:28,344
I have not seen mother.

1605
02:01:29,509 --> 02:01:32,852
But God has sent you as a mother for me.

1606
02:01:33,002 --> 02:01:34,191
I know.

1607
02:01:34,747 --> 02:01:37,857
You all are becoming against me.

1608
02:01:38,495 --> 02:01:40,828
Even if the whole world backs her up.

1609
02:01:41,642 --> 02:01:44,822
Still, I wonít let that happen.
The thing that she wishes for.

1610
02:01:50,942 --> 02:01:53,265
I want to marry Sonia with your son.

1611
02:01:53,444 --> 02:01:54,278
Are you ready?

1612
02:01:54,328 --> 02:01:56,706
Hey, you want to do a good deed.

1613
02:01:57,032 --> 02:01:59,556
And you areasking.
We politicians, donít just laugh.

1614
02:01:59,597 --> 02:02:01,013
We make the others laugh too.

1615
02:02:01,055 --> 02:02:02,563
You stay stress free...

1616
02:02:03,044 --> 02:02:06,012
...and make all the arrangements
of the wedding, at my farm house.

1617
02:02:06,054 --> 02:02:06,955
Yes.

1618
02:02:12,767 --> 02:02:13,601
Jai.

1619
02:02:16,933 --> 02:02:21,913
Modi is getting Sonia married to Desraj.
On his farmhouse.

1620
02:02:30,276 --> 02:02:32,239
Sir, sir, sir.

1621
02:02:32,364 --> 02:02:33,199
Huh?

1622
02:02:34,495 --> 02:02:35,339
Sir a catastrophe happened.

1623
02:02:35,381 --> 02:02:36,668
What has happed? Tell me, at least.

1624
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:38,720
Sir both of them broke the lock,
and ran away from the prison.

1625
02:02:38,761 --> 02:02:39,596
Where were you?

1626
02:02:39,687 --> 02:02:40,574
Sir, at that time

1627
02:02:40,813 --> 02:02:42,334
I went to the washroom.

1628
02:02:42,584 --> 02:02:43,660
Desraj.

1629
02:02:44,874 --> 02:02:48,828
Half of Indiaís idiots
have joined the police.

1630
02:02:48,997 --> 02:02:50,404
And the rest of the idiots?

1631
02:02:50,742 --> 02:02:53,038
Like me, they have joined politics.

1632
02:02:53,307 --> 02:02:54,352
Get lost from here.

1633
02:02:54,394 --> 02:02:55,078
Yes sir.

1634
02:02:55,228 --> 02:02:56,062
Sir.

1635
02:03:00,589 --> 02:03:01,178
Get lost.

1636
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:02,942
Yes sir. Yes sir.

1637
02:03:03,636 --> 02:03:05,982
You look for him.

1638
02:03:06,395 --> 02:03:09,655
And make sure, he doesnít
reach the marriage venue.

1639
02:03:15,379 --> 02:03:17,381
Sir, you go. I will see them.

1640
02:03:17,506 --> 02:03:19,592
You reach the wedding venue at any cost.

1641
02:03:19,652 --> 02:03:21,425
I will bring the magistrate along.

1642
02:03:27,923 --> 02:03:28,809
Hey! Whatís this?

1643
02:03:29,024 --> 02:03:30,113
My cart.

1644
02:04:30,803 --> 02:04:32,025
Kid!

1645
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:34,635
You have played a lot of hide and seek.

1646
02:04:35,467 --> 02:04:38,702
You are really fond of
reaching the wedding venue.

1647
02:04:38,946 --> 02:04:40,950
Sarju will take you.

1648
02:04:41,226 --> 02:04:44,901
Not to the wedding
venue, but to your pyre.

1649
02:04:45,076 --> 02:04:46,484
I am a soldier of love.

1650
02:04:46,689 --> 02:04:48,606
I will go even by
crossing, the well of blood.

1651
02:04:48,648 --> 02:04:49,701
Really?

1652
02:05:16,046 --> 02:05:17,566
What nonsense is this?

1653
02:05:18,235 --> 02:05:19,956
Why have you not groomed her yet?

1654
02:05:21,927 --> 02:05:23,751
And why have you not applied henna?

1655
02:05:24,942 --> 02:05:26,402
Stubbornness too has a limit.

1656
02:05:26,444 --> 02:05:27,401
Come with me.

1657
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:32,987
Everything will be fine.

1658
02:05:33,235 --> 02:05:34,901
Our women will make Sonia understand.

1659
02:05:34,943 --> 02:05:36,728
Groom her and bring along.

1660
02:05:37,729 --> 02:05:38,968
Come.

1661
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:41,032
Come.

1662
02:05:44,708 --> 02:05:45,423
Mr Modi.

1663
02:05:45,509 --> 02:05:46,454
I am afraid...

1664
02:05:46,694 --> 02:05:48,448
...I am here to stop this wedding.

1665
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:48,978
Why?

1666
02:05:49,178 --> 02:05:50,898
Because this marriage is illegal.

1667
02:05:51,161 --> 02:05:52,412
As the girl is already married.

1668
02:05:52,454 --> 02:05:53,814
Do you have a proof?

1669
02:05:53,855 --> 02:05:55,791
I am the proof.

1670
02:05:56,401 --> 02:05:59,717
In front of me.
In the temple of Lakshmi Narayan.

1671
02:05:59,758 --> 02:06:01,336
Jai and Sonia...

1672
02:06:01,468 --> 02:06:04,284
...by accepting God as the supreme power.

1673
02:06:04,325 --> 02:06:06,122
Exchanged garlands.

1674
02:06:06,332 --> 02:06:08,061
This woman just said
something and you accepted it?

1675
02:06:08,103 --> 02:06:11,031
The witness for my
truthfulness is the whole village.

1676
02:06:12,364 --> 02:06:13,823
If they will come to know...

1677
02:06:13,928 --> 02:06:16,580
...that their auntís honesty
is being questioned.

1678
02:06:16,893 --> 02:06:18,092
Then let me tell you...

1679
02:06:18,432 --> 02:06:21,047
...you wonít get any place to even hide.

1680
02:06:21,172 --> 02:06:22,530
This is blackmailing.

1681
02:06:22,572 --> 02:06:24,644
Mr Dhanraj, pressuring a married woman...

1682
02:06:24,685 --> 02:06:27,063
...into second marriage is a crime.

1683
02:06:27,305 --> 02:06:29,228
Which can lead to a punishment.

1684
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:31,981
As per section 366 IPC itís
10 years of imprisonment.

1685
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:33,209
Mr lawyer...

1686
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:36,141
...as pr the Hindu marriage Act 1955.

1687
02:06:36,431 --> 02:06:37,714
As per section 7.

1688
02:06:38,249 --> 02:06:41,631
Law doesnít agree to a
wedding which didnít happen...

1689
02:06:41,673 --> 02:06:43,869
...as per theHindu rituals.

1690
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:45,533
For marriage...

1691
02:06:45,895 --> 02:06:49,482
...Itís required to walk
around the vedi, 7 times.

1692
02:06:49,524 --> 02:06:52,727
We politicians, donít just know the law.

1693
02:06:53,155 --> 02:06:55,126
We evenmake the law.

1694
02:06:55,261 --> 02:06:57,435
I donít need the lawís permission...

1695
02:06:57,476 --> 02:06:59,070
...to get my daughter married.

1696
02:07:00,007 --> 02:07:01,016
I am her father.

1697
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:03,760
To take care of her
wellbeing is my responsibility.

1698
02:07:03,801 --> 02:07:04,924
My concern.

1699
02:07:05,315 --> 02:07:06,817
Mr magistrate.

1700
02:07:07,005 --> 02:07:09,611
And the one for whom,
this ruckus is being created.

1701
02:07:09,985 --> 02:07:10,915
Where is he?

1702
02:07:16,852 --> 02:07:17,813
Mr. Modi.

1703
02:07:19,042 --> 02:07:19,573
Mr. Modi

1704
02:07:19,615 --> 02:07:21,880
I am telling you for the last time.

1705
02:07:22,482 --> 02:07:24,280
Till the time, court
doesnít give its decision.

1706
02:07:24,322 --> 02:07:25,912
This marriage canít take place.

1707
02:07:25,954 --> 02:07:27,245
Or for insulting the law...

1708
02:07:27,286 --> 02:07:29,019
...I can get you arrested.

1709
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:30,154
Do you know who is that guy?

1710
02:07:30,196 --> 02:07:31,130
And this person?

1711
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:33,345
These are runaway goons.

1712
02:07:33,789 --> 02:07:35,080
And by listening to their false testimony.

1713
02:07:35,121 --> 02:07:36,813
You just came here, at this time.

1714
02:07:36,854 --> 02:07:38,395
To tarnish my reputation.

1715
02:07:38,996 --> 02:07:39,859
Remember...

1716
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:42,844
...I will sue you for my defamation.

1717
02:07:42,971 --> 02:07:45,121
Modi, you donít know the nuances of law.

1718
02:07:45,298 --> 02:07:47,152
Why are you doing harm to yourself?

1719
02:07:47,457 --> 02:07:49,229
Thereís no benefit to talk to him.

1720
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:50,826
I will issue an arrest
warrant towards him.

1721
02:07:50,867 --> 02:07:52,640
- Come with me.
- No, Mrmagistrate.

1722
02:07:52,751 --> 02:07:53,728
You came at your own wish.

1723
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:55,763
But you will leave only as per our wish.

1724
02:07:55,804 --> 02:07:58,714
Our guards know, how to take care of you.

1725
02:07:59,426 --> 02:08:01,295
First you see the wedding rituals.

1726
02:08:01,483 --> 02:08:04,196
Then I will drop you, wherever you want.

1727
02:08:04,634 --> 02:08:07,051
We politicians, donít become fools.

1728
02:08:07,093 --> 02:08:08,669
But make others fool.

1729
02:08:08,975 --> 02:08:10,695
Mr Modi. Come.

1730
02:08:11,072 --> 02:08:13,566
The bride might have reached the vedi.

1731
02:08:13,778 --> 02:08:17,759
[Chanting in Sanskrit.]

1732
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:44,900
Mr Modi.

1733
02:11:45,408 --> 02:11:46,715
I said one day.

1734
02:11:46,832 --> 02:11:48,988
That if you will try to marry
Sonia to someone else.

1735
02:11:49,029 --> 02:11:50,672
I will take her from the venue.

1736
02:11:50,921 --> 02:11:52,537
I am here to fulfil my promise.

1737
02:11:56,397 --> 02:11:57,231
Stop him.

1738
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,600
Sonia!

1739
02:12:19,124 --> 02:12:20,375
Daughter.

1740
02:13:45,745 --> 02:13:46,989
Jai!

1741
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:49,170
Sonia, daughter. What has happened?

1742
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:51,931
I became a beggar in just one second.

1743
02:13:52,041 --> 02:13:55,270
Father, you scolded me.

1744
02:13:55,397 --> 02:13:57,837
That I had not applied henna in my hands.

1745
02:13:58,893 --> 02:14:00,229
See this.

1746
02:14:00,375 --> 02:14:03,979
Forgive me, daughter. Forgive me.

1747
02:14:06,902 --> 02:14:08,481
Jai!

1748
02:14:09,646 --> 02:14:11,429
Son jai!

1749
02:14:13,533 --> 02:14:14,605
Son jai.

1750
02:14:15,239 --> 02:14:17,375
What sort of stubbornness is this?

1751
02:14:17,416 --> 02:14:19,666
I just died.

1752
02:14:19,816 --> 02:14:22,435
Grandmother, you said...

1753
02:14:22,881 --> 02:14:23,960
...that you.

1754
02:14:24,178 --> 02:14:26,986
That you. Can live without me as well.

1755
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:28,654
You said that, grandmother.

1756
02:14:28,695 --> 02:14:30,421
No. No, son Jai.

1757
02:14:30,463 --> 02:14:34,097
Donít go. You will have to
be alive till my indemnification.

1758
02:14:34,690 --> 02:14:36,410
Who else do I have in this world?

1759
02:14:36,841 --> 02:14:37,748
Who else?

1760
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:41,516
Grandmother says.

1761
02:14:41,649 --> 02:14:42,854
That till the time...

1762
02:14:42,896 --> 02:14:44,669
...you donít marry me with your consent.

1763
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:46,946
She wonít accept me.

1764
02:14:54,297 --> 02:14:55,131
Jai.

1765
02:14:55,736 --> 02:14:56,570
Jai.

1766
02:14:57,183 --> 02:14:58,017
Jai.

1767
02:14:58,529 --> 02:14:59,976
Jai.

1768
02:15:00,703 --> 02:15:06,435
Became a victim of stubbornness.

1769
02:15:06,666 --> 02:15:11,573
Became a victim of stubbornness.

1770
02:15:12,185 --> 02:15:16,544
Became a victim of stubbornness.
