1
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,934
Congratulations! Baby boys, twins.

2
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,869
Look after Durga, while I go
and break the news to her father.

3
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,000
Congratulations, Mr. Dinanath.

4
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,934
You've become a
grandfather to two children.

5
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,267
I'm a grandfather?

6
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,333
Who is their father?

7
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,404
I see you dancing everyday,
still I'm not weary of you.

8
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,735
Don't let him enter!
- Who are you? Get out!

9
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,070
Who is kicking up a fuss?
- This old is trying to get in.

10
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,069
Old man? Who?

11
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:27,671
It's me. Do you recognise me?
- I ignore young people. .

12
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,071
. .on the second meeting. How
will I remember old men like you?

13
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,200
Out!
- No.

14
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,070
I'm not going until justice
is meted out to my daughter.

15
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,733
Justice, eh?

16
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,800
Justice.

17
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,069
You fool! Son of a gun!

18
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,669
If I were to be fair with
each and every man's daughter. .

19
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,869
. .by now I'd have had
ten-thousand fathers-in-law.

20
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,935
Let's go, Father. We
won't be given justice here.

21
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,335
No dear, have patience.

22
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,801
Vikram. .

23
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,805
You destroyed my daughter's life.
We're poor, we bore it silently.

24
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,204
But now that you've refused to give
the innocent children their right. .

25
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,336
. .all their life they'll
remain a blot to the society.

26
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,003
I won't let you live
in peace! I won't!

27
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:36,638
Look at you, old man. You
rustle like a withered leaf.

28
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,004
Just one touch from me and you're
going to embrace the graveyard.

29
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,737
Stop it, Vikram.
Enough. You've spoken enough.

30
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:53,004
If I stop talking,
my shoes will talk.

31
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,736
No Vikram. Just think
about the future of the kids.

32
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,667
Oh yes.

33
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,601
I almost forgot about them.

34
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,535
Dump those misbegotten
ones into some orphanage.

35
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,937
As for you daughter..
she's pretty enough.

36
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,135
Put her in a brothel, her
old age will be taken care of.

37
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,600
Vikram!

38
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,133
Father!

39
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:27,270
What happened to you?
- My child. .

40
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,869
Father!

41
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,601
No. No.

42
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:44,936
You are high on wealth and power,
so you spurn a hapless woman.

43
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,802
You refuse to accept
your own children.

44
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:56,272
But remember. There'll come a
day when time will favour the kids.

45
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,534
And they'll extract
revenge from you. .

46
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,203
And you.. you will beg
for mercy from them.

47
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,534
Yes, you'll beg for mercy.

48
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,670
You'll beg!

49
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,203
I? Beg for mercy?

50
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,736
Mother Goddess, what
kind of justice is this?

51
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,669
He married me before You.

52
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,668
And today he denies.

53
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:39,202
He even refuses to
acknowledge his sons.

54
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,201
You tell me, Goddess. .

55
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,001
. .what do I do with
these innocent children?

56
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,201
What am I to do?
Oh, where am I to go?

57
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,970
Like days and nights, joys
and sorrows come and go.

58
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,470
The truth is that, one
who can't take on sorrows. .

59
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:01,136
. .has no right to seek joys.
- Accepted.

60
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,403
But what else can a
hapless woman do but cry. .

61
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:10,403
. .who has no one to fall back upon?
- When the world. .

62
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:15,537
. .snatches away one support,
God gives more.

63
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,403
I know of a woman in the city,
who has devoted her life. .

64
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,436
. .to the welfare of hapless
and destitute women like you.

65
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,469
Go to her, and you will find refuge.

66
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,602
I know no one in the city, brother.

67
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,734
Now that you've
called me a brother. .

68
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,867
. .I must honour this relationship.

69
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,601
Come, I'll take you there.

70
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,667
Please come.

71
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,002
More attitude, less professional.

72
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,867
Greetings.

73
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,800
Nice. Very, very nice.

74
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,934
Are we ready?

75
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,800
Come, please.

76
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:33,104
Sit here while I talk to the landlady
about you. I'll be right back.

77
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,903
Champabai, how long?
It's been half-hour.

78
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,036
I'm losing my drunken ecstasy.

79
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:47,370
I've brought sensuous stuff. He's
going to be intoxicated forever.

80
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,701
Really?
- Show me, will you?

81
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:52,702
Go, look her up. I'm no
Jaggi if you don't enjoy.

82
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:07,637
What a dish!
- Fine, but what about the kids?

83
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,303
Don't worry. I'll take care of
them provided you shell out dough.

84
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:13,633
Good.

85
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:20,370
Go and wait in the room,
we'll send her.

86
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,435
Well..
- First introduce her.

87
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:32,970
This is your landlady.
- Landlady? She's like a daughter.

88
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,235
What is my job?
- It's simple.

89
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,433
You can start right now.

90
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,634
Come honey.

91
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,302
Don't cry.
- Go on, don't worry.

92
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,433
It's your own house.

93
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,501
He's our new guest. Make him happy.

94
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,568
What. .?
- Yes, else I'll flay you alive.

95
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:05,303
Where to? Stay right here.
Shut the door from inside.

96
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,903
She's a late-starter,
but she'll give in.

97
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,567
Damn, she will!

98
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,904
I'm a poor,
respectable woman. I have kids.

99
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:21,169
I was brought here
under the pretext of a job.

100
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,902
I beg of you, brother.

101
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,568
Get up, sister.
- Sister?

102
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,569
Do not be afraid.
I'm a police officer.

103
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,167
I was informed that women from. .

104
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,168
.. respectable
families are lured here. .

105
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,702
. .and forced to do this.

106
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,767
Don't you worry.

107
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,569
Jaggi, you are under arrest.
- Police?

108
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,435
Make a move, and this kid..
- No!

109
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,705
No? Then drop the gun. Drop it,
else I'll kill the kid.

110
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,300
Drop it!

111
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,567
Stop, Jaggi!

112
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:11,302
No brother. You might hit the baby.

113
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,635
Liquor for two bucks,
and some peanuts.

114
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,101
Get lost!
- Move it!

115
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,835
Want this kid?

116
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,601
Out of the way.

117
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,101
Out of the way, you cripple!

118
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:07,436
Gangubai! Get up.

119
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,105
Take care of the kid.
You'll be paid handsomely.

120
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:27,437
''Like flowers they blossomed.. ''

121
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:32,237
''Like flowers they blossomed.. ''

122
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:37,437
''And were set apart in no time.''

123
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,102
''And were set apart in no time.''

124
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:49,437
''Like flowers they blossomed.. ''

125
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,071
''And were set apart in no time.''

126
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,434
''And were set apart in no time.''

127
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,570
''Like flowers they blossomed.. ''

128
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:57,570
''In a world of plenty. .''

129
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:02,104
''All a mother had was so little. .''

130
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:07,371
''And what little she had. .''

131
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,306
''She lost. ''

132
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,236
''Like flowers they blossomed.. ''

133
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,370
''And were set apart in no time.''

134
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,967
Thieving?
- No sir, no.

135
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,636
My mother is sick. I
need money for medicines.

136
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,434
Let me have it, please.
- Want it?

137
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,233
Drink.

138
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,501
How else will you buy medicines?

139
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,433
Mother!

140
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,038
''Like flowers they
blossomed together.. ''

141
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:37,906
''And set apart in no time.''

142
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,835
''Like flowers they
blossomed together.. ''

143
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,167
What's wrong?

144
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,034
Where do you live?

145
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:49,567
Come, I will drop you.

146
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,300
You drunkard.

147
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:07,370
''Tormented and torn.. ''

148
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:12,170
''A mother she was.''

149
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:16,971
''Tormented and torn.. ''

150
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:21,837
''A mother she was.''

151
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:27,103
''It's a story of flowers. .

152
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:34,106
. .plucked and torn apart.''

153
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:39,170
''Blossoms.. ''

154
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,973
''Torn apart in no time.''

155
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:51,203
''Like flowers they
blossomed together.. ''

156
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,303
Idiot! Tap water
comes only for two hours.

157
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,836
Drink this. Go on. You
will get it 24 hours.

158
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,768
Watch it!
- Don't worry. .

159
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,769
. .just toning up my throat.
Get that donation box.

160
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,302
Here you are, Amit.
- Hold the bottle.

161
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,134
In the name of the Goddess?

162
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:58,203
Why hide it away? It's
for building a temple.

163
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,102
You'll be given more!
- I don't have money.

164
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:05,103
I haven't made a cent yet.
- Not a cent yet, eh?

165
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,102
No.
- You'll be given right now.

166
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,101
What's this?
- Sandal.

167
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,901
Brand?
- Kolhapuri.

168
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,769
Size?
- Can't see.

169
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,235
Size 9. What size?
- 9.

170
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,769
Right, 9, lasts long
enough for a hundred beatings.

171
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,803
Nice. May the Goddess bless you.

172
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,768
Are you through?
- I am.

173
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,301
And you?
- Almost done, Amit.

174
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,037
Got from all of them, except the
idiot, the fatso. He isn't giving.

175
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:51,970
Well fatso, gathered lots of fats,
eh? Out with the money, or!

176
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:56,036
Fair play all right, else I'll
break everything. Give that too.

177
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,435
How're the goings?
- Still more shops to go.

178
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:04,837
More shops? One by one will
take a lot of time. Hold this.

179
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,300
Keep the boxes here.

180
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:14,636
Listen folks, the temple must come
up before the festival of Navratri. .

181
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:18,637
. .else I'll lose face
before Goddess Durga.

182
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,634
The boxes are kept here.
Come one by one and donate.

183
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,234
You will be blessed.

184
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:29,171
C'mon, put the money.
What're you looking at?

185
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:33,236
C'mon, hurry up. C'mon, hurry up.

186
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:38,036
We got to collect 50,OOO.
C'mon, hurry up.

187
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,301
Come on, hurry up.
Put it in this box.

188
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,969
Come. Come.

189
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,167
What're you honking for?

190
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,701
Donate money first,
then we'll clear the way.

191
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,635
Sir, they're asking
money. What to do?

192
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,568
Sir, we're
collecting donations for. .

193
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,768
. .building a
temple of Goddess Durga.

194
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:13,069
Who are you collecting for?
Goddess Mother? Or your mother?

195
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,969
One and the same. The
Goddess is also my Mother.

196
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:26,170
What sir? A tenner? The
temple will need 50,OOO.

197
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,968
How will it come up if rich
men like you act so miserly?

198
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:32,102
At this rate how long will it
take for the temple to come up?

199
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,770
It'll come up, sir. If the
donations fall short, I'll get dirty.

200
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:41,003
I'll rob and murder. But I'll
see to it that the temple is built.

201
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:45,068
Can you kill? - Definitely
if I fall short of money

202
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,767
Donate, please.

203
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,033
You seem to be a useful person.

204
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:57,768
Thank you. Ismail,
make way for the car.

205
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,701
Clear the boxes. Hurry up.

206
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,900
Let him go.

207
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,900
Greetings, sir.

208
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,900
Get me my medicine.

209
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,635
Brother Amit!

210
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,702
Someone fleeced your father.
- Fleeced?

211
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,201
Where?
- At the bar.

212
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,902
Oh my God!
- What's the matter?

213
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:28,038
What's wrong?
- Son, I'm ruined. I'm undone.

214
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,906
I'm reduced to penury. Years
back, I got a goon banished.

215
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,501
The dirty man
cropped up from nowhere. .

216
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,702
. .and robbed me of
my hard-earned money.

217
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:44,503
My God!
- And all of you were watching, eh?

218
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,501
No, teacher..
- Forgive us.

219
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,503
Forgive, eh? Where
did he go? Which way?

220
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,570
I've no idea where he went.

221
00:23:56,033 --> 00:24:01,505
He used to live on the Kali hills,
near the Hanuman temple.

222
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,167
Hey black coat!

223
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:12,835
What're you searching there?
This way, look who's here.

224
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,767
I knew you'd come for sure.

225
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:27,969
I'll pursue you wherever you go.

226
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:35,903
Then take me on, sonny. You're
destined to have it from me!

227
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:41,835
Anyone can play with a gun.

228
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:47,633
That's like it.

229
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,969
Anyone can play with
that. How about this?

230
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:17,433
There goes.

231
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,369
Who are you guys? To
fight or to set up a trade. .

232
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,770
. .in this territory, you
need to ask Raghu don.

233
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,733
Raghu don?

234
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,669
So you aren't Raghu?
- No, I thought you.. no?

235
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,335
Forgive me don, my mistake.
- It's okay.

236
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,467
What's this?
- Sandal.

237
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,668
Brand?
- Kolhapuri?

238
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,334
Size?
- No idea.

239
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,934
No idea, he says. It's size 9.

240
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,601
Mine is size 10, boys.

241
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,734
10, eh?

242
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,667
Smart fellow!

243
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:17,600
Take him away.

244
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:25,470
Who is that who commands a salute?
- He's the inspector.

245
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,467
Inspector.

246
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:35,337
Sir, I never knew
you were an inspector.

247
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,735
Forgive me if I have hurt you.
- No problem.

248
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,867
Message for you, sir.

249
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,535
Sir, please don't book me.
Else, I'll be in for a year or two.

250
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:45,168
I got a clean police record.
- It's all right, go on now.

251
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:47,668
I'm sure you must
be hurt. Forgive me.

252
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,534
I told you, no problem. Go.

253
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,534
Sir..
- Get lost!

254
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,335
Yes?
- Inspector Khan was shot.

255
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,333
What?

256
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,469
What has happened to my son? My son!

257
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,802
Do not cry.

258
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,469
You've lost a son
but I am still alive'.

259
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:22,406
I swear by uncle Khan,
I'll avenge his death someday.

260
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,467
Excuse me, sir.

261
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:31,135
These are four suspects in
inspector Khan's murder case.

262
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,268
They're regulars at
Jamnabai's brothel.

263
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,469
If I fail to avenge
his death from you guys. .

264
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:51,069
I don't deserve to be a policeman.

265
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:57,203
Jamnabai, call her.
- She's getting dressed.

266
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,601
Isn't she taking
too long to dress up?

267
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:06,404
She might take all the time,
but I'm fully prepared.

268
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,467
Will I do?

269
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,205
Don't make faces, man.
I'll show you such a stuff. .

270
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,535
. .you might not have
seen in your life.

271
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,434
Here.. this.

272
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,403
What's this? What is this?
- Sandal.

273
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:34,204
Everyone knows its a sandal.
But what make is it?

274
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,333
Kolhapuri.

275
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,004
Those dons out there, use knives. .

276
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:45,136
. .and I put this sandal to good use.

277
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,303
What's the size?
- 6.

278
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:53,403
It's 9, and you say it's 6?

279
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:57,536
Forgive me, I can't see properly.

280
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:04,273
Myopic, hard of hearing,
false teeth!

281
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:08,236
And you dare come to a brothel?
Get out of here! Out!

282
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,367
Leave me!

283
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,702
Aren't you ashamed? Get out!
- Hey!

284
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:22,302
Drunk again?
Kicking up a fuss again?

285
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,101
I held till the ritual
of Goddess Durga got over.

286
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:33,806
Once it was over, I
guzzled a bottle in.

287
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,835
Everyday you come and
bug my clients. Why?

288
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:44,305
Only when they stop coming
here will you marry me. Say what?

289
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:49,304
I've told you ten times!
I'm not going to marry you.

290
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:53,436
Why not? Man,
yours is the right age.

291
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:55,500
You're nearing eighteen.

292
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:58,101
Once you're old, no
one is coming to you.

293
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:02,101
None of these guys. Guys. .

294
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,335
No.
- What did I say? None of them.

295
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:09,503
Only me. Even after my hairs
turn grey I'll keep coming here.

296
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,434
Let's go, guys.
- Go on.

297
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:14,569
Where are you folks going?
Sit. Don't fall for his words.

298
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,500
I'll dance.

299
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:21,436
Is it? All right, if you
dance, I'm going to sing.

300
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:59,771
''You're losing your youth.''

301
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:05,171
''You're losing your youth.''

302
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,970
''Who's going to care for you?''

303
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:12,670
''Try something. ''

304
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:18,171
''Yes love, do something.''

305
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:23,570
''Mere words won't help.''

306
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,038
''Mere words won't help.''

307
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,970
''I'm not going to give in. .

308
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:36,970
. .no matter how hard you try.''

309
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:42,304
''Try your very best. ''

310
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:17,139
''For my dancing-bells, I
have a thousand admirers.''

311
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:23,305
''For my dancing-bells, I
have a thousand admirers.''

312
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,969
''You're not the only one. .

313
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:33,972
..my heart has a
place for millions.''

314
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,969
''How long will you dance?''

315
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:40,903
''Someday your body
is sure to tire out. .

316
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:44,903
. .no matter how ha,rd
you try to save it'

317
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:49,937
''Try your very best. ''

318
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:23,176
''Love me, waste not the moments.''

319
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:29,171
''Break the
dancing-bells and give in to me. ''

320
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:34,037
''Give in to me,
break the dancing-bells.''

321
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,838
''Handcuffs, I shall wear. .

322
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,838
. .but I'm not giving in to you. .

323
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,169
. .no matter how hard you try.''

324
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:52,170
''Try your very best. ''

325
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,871
''You're getting old. ''

326
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:03,038
''You're getting old. ''

327
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:07,837
''Who's going to care for you?''

328
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,236
''Do something, now.''

329
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,169
''I'm not giving in. .

330
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,368
. .no matter how hard you try.''

331
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,971
''Try your very best. ''

332
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:02,424
So our information was accurate.

333
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,625
Hey, stay put! Or
I'll break your jaw.

334
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:09,060
Pandu, take him away.
- Wait. How can you take him away?

335
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:11,725
I haven't yet dealt with them.

336
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:16,159
Let me hand them below the belt,
then you can take them.

337
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:18,490
You?

338
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:25,427
You are the one?
- You are that inspector, right?

339
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,425
Right.
- Good day, sir.

340
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:32,426
So you're here too? Wherever
you go, you create trouble.

341
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:37,426
No sir, trouble
follows me wherever I go.

342
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:41,460
But sir, please don't book me,
my record will get a beating.

343
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:44,225
All right, go now.
- Everyone has to go someday.

344
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:48,160
But sir, please don't book me,
my record will get a beating.

345
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:50,024
Will you shut up?
- Put me in the cell if you want. .

346
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,361
. .but please don't
register a complaint.

347
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:57,424
Ramble more and I'll handcuff you.

348
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:02,960
Hang me if you want, but if you
book me, my record will tarnish.

349
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:04,958
Shut up!
- I'll get out if you want, but. .

350
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:06,691
.. my record
shouldn't be spoilt, sir.

351
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,560
Don't book me! Consider my record!

352
00:38:19,356 --> 00:38:20,423
Who are you?

353
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,557
What're you staring at?

354
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,694
I guess you don't recognise me?
- No.

355
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:30,957
15 years back when your son. .

356
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:33,225
. .was lying
inebriated on the streets. .

357
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:36,024
. .I was the one who brought
him home. Do you remember?

358
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,494
You are the one?
- Yes.

359
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,158
Come son, come on in.

360
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:51,995
You've grown so tall and broad.
- Loneliness stretched me.

361
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:55,092
Burdens of misery broadened me.

362
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:57,691
But your favour, I
shall never forget.

363
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:01,025
What favour?
- I wanted to study.

364
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,293
You encouraged me, also
gave me books. Remember?

365
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,959
Look mother, I've
passed matriculation.

366
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,624
Really? Wonderful !

367
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,625
Bless me.
- Live long. .

368
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:16,492
You're drunk, aren't you?

369
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,928
Yes, I drink. But actually it's
the liquor that's swallowing me.

370
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:33,030
When your son was drunk,
you had slapped him.

371
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,091
One slap changed
his life completely. .

372
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:38,290
. .and he reached new heights.

373
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:43,293
Had I a mother, had she slapped me. .

374
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,423
. .I wouldn't have fallen so low.

375
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,626
Who is it, Ma?
- Look for yourself.

376
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:55,925
You?
- Yes sir.

377
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,991
Why have you come here?
- Son. .

378
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,960
I came to express my gratitude
for saving my life last night.

379
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:03,891
Fine. If you want to
express your gratitude. .

380
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:05,891
. .come to the police station.

381
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:08,091
And this is my house.
- What're you saying, son?

382
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,892
Don't interfere, Ma. If
you encourage such people. .

383
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:12,891
. .all the rogues in the world
will start visiting our house.

384
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:15,425
Do you know who he is?
- I know him in and out.

385
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:20,894
You don't know. Once as a
kid, when you were drunk. .

386
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:24,092
. .he was the one who picked
you up and brought you home.

387
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,957
Remember?

388
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:36,491
Yes, yes. What did
you say your name was?

389
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:38,291
No, don't say.

390
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,225
Let me guess. Amit!

391
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,958
Right.
- Strange!

392
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,892
Why didn't you tell me before?
- How could I?

393
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:49,425
You didn't give me time,
you just shut my mouth.

394
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,625
Sit.
- Have the oblations.

395
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,293
I'm a devotee of Goddess Durga.
- Then we can sure hit it off.

396
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:58,158
Are you Goddess Durga's devotee?
- I'm Mother Durga's son.

397
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:06,027
The two of you
remind me of my lost son.

398
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:10,826
Had he been around
he'd have been like yo'u.

399
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:12,825
Consider me your son.
I was lost years back. .

400
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:16,093
. .today you've found me, mother.

401
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,357
I'll answer it.

402
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,424
Hello?
- Inspector Kishan?

403
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:32,961
I'll call him. Kishan, call for you.

404
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:38,825
Hello?
- If life is dear to you. .

405
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:44,361
. .set my men free. Else. .

406
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,424
Who's that?
- Your father!

407
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:53,960
What's wrong? Why are
you upset? Who was it?

408
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,224
Your father!

409
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,892
If you don't want to tell me,
don't. But why drag my parents in?

410
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:04,159
I mean, he told me that.
- Then say that.

411
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:07,159
I thought you
spoke about my father. .

412
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,959
You love your parents dearly?

413
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:15,226
No question of loving them
when I haven't seen them.

414
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,160
Implying? Your parents..
- No. I have no one.

415
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,962
No one to fall back upon,
no one to look after.

416
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,959
Thought I found a brother in him,
but he too acts on his whims.

417
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:34,293
You aren't even married?
- Ma, who will give him a girl?

418
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,093
The rogue! Six months he is in
prison, and six months he's out.

419
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,893
Wrong inspector. Girls form
a beeline outside my house.

420
00:42:41,956 --> 00:42:42,990
Come, see sometime.

421
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,762
Then why don't you marry?
- Well, none is worth liking.

422
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:53,159
What's wrong with today's
men? No girl attracts them.

423
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:58,827
Same with him. He has seen many,
but none attracts him.

424
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:01,692
And how? I don't
want an illiterate oaf. .

425
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:06,093
. .and you don't want a modern girl.

426
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:09,292
I'll accept anyone. Just get one.
- Right, get one first.

427
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:10,890
Hear that?

428
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:21,761
First the dough, baby.
- Giving, man. Don't you trust me?

429
00:43:21,823 --> 00:43:25,293
I don't even trust my father.
What good are you?

430
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,827
Here.
- 50 bucks? 50 is past, baby.

431
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,759
100 works now. Know what?

432
00:43:33,823 --> 00:43:35,691
The police keep on
raiding every now and then.

433
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:38,091
It's hard to smuggle in the goods.
- Give me, please.

434
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:41,759
There's the girl in
red who came with you.

435
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,757
Get me a date with her. .

436
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:49,694
. .and I'll give you a drink for free.
- I can only introduce her to you.

437
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,093
Then it's up to you.
She's a shy girl.

438
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:57,692
She's here to study the atmosphere. .

439
00:43:57,756 --> 00:44:00,158
. .for a college stage show. - Oh
I see. Jai, one cigarette please

440
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,824
For you.
- Thank you.

441
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,291
And this is for your friend.

442
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:11,693
Just one puff, and
she'll be rid of her shyness.

443
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,157
Excuse me!

444
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:22,658
Annu, what're you
doing here all alone?

445
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:23,823
C'mon, have a cigarette.

446
00:44:23,856 --> 00:44:27,626
Cigarette? No way.
- You're going to act as a smoker. .

447
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,959
. .in the show. Why not
have a rehearsal right here?

448
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,157
Come on, have it.

449
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:34,625
No.
- C'mon. Please.

450
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:51,157
Drink. It'll take care of the cough.

451
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,157
Good.

452
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:57,225
Annu, this is Mr.
Gopal. He owns the disco.

453
00:44:57,623 --> 00:45:00,892
Gopal, she's Annu.
- Nice to meet you.

454
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,023
Hello.

455
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,559
You're staging a
show that portrays. .

456
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:09,891
. .the evil effects of drugs? Nice.

457
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:13,693
I'm sure, it'll have a good
effect over the young generation.

458
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:16,958
And you know, I'm
very happy about that.

459
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:21,960
Give me all the tickets that are
remaining, I'll have them all sold.

460
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:24,624
Hey brother, quickly.

461
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,757
Excuse me.

462
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:01,827
Hey brother, one for me too.
- Who are you?

463
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:05,493
This is the first time I see you
here. - I have seen the world.

464
00:46:05,523 --> 00:46:08,492
Seen all the hangouts. I
heard lots about this place. .

465
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:11,892
. .so I came here.

466
00:46:11,956 --> 00:46:14,558
We don't offer credit to
first-timers. - Take this.

467
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:15,690
That's good.

468
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,558
Hi! What're you doing here?

469
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:24,091
Annu, why don't you go on the floor?

470
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:29,225
Dance will set your mood right.

471
00:46:44,756 --> 00:46:47,758
Hey brother why do you hold my arm?
- To put on handcuff.

472
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:49,690
Handcuff? Who are you?

473
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:53,623
Police.

474
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:03,959
Annu, there's a fight going on.
Let's get out of here. Come on!

475
00:47:04,623 --> 00:47:05,690
Go to hell!

476
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,957
Police?

477
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:38,557
Take them away!

478
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:44,657
Come on.

479
00:47:55,823 --> 00:48:00,894
Get in. Move it.

480
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:07,558
Sit. Where do you want to go?

481
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:09,557
Tell me.

482
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:13,091
C'mon, tell me.
- Me?

483
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:18,859
Take me wherever you want to.
- Wherever?

484
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:21,557
How strange!

485
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:38,425
Where do you want me to take you?

486
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,758
You got a name, an address?

487
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:43,559
''How do I tell you. .

488
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,892
I
.. my story?'

489
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:55,360
''How do I tell you my story?''

490
00:48:55,423 --> 00:49:00,027
''I don't have a house,
no place to go.''

491
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:03,625
''Then?''
- ''I'm homeless.''

492
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,892
''Take me to your house.''

493
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,694
''If that's a problem,
take me to your office.''

494
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,492
''I'm homeless. ''

495
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,691
''Take me to your house.''

496
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:20,494
''If that's a problem,
take me to your office.''

497
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:30,358
''Hey stop it. Come down.''

498
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:55,328
''If it's an holiday,
don't lose heart.''

499
00:49:55,423 --> 00:50:00,027
''If it's an holiday,
don't lose heart.''

500
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:05,294
''Just stop on the way. .

501
00:50:05,356 --> 00:50:08,892
. .near some hotel.''

502
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:11,625
''Hotel? Are you mad?''

503
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:17,894
''If not a hotel
take me for a mov'ie.''

504
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:22,493
''I'm homeless, take
me to your house. ''

505
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,494
''If that's a problem,
take me to your office.''

506
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,325
''I'm homeless. ''

507
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,694
''If watching a movie gives a
bad name, sit in the motor car.''

bad name, sit in the motor car.''

509

''Let's go for a long ride,
like lovers do.''

510
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:12,359
''What're you up to?
What'll people say?''

511
00:51:13,356 --> 00:51:18,427
''Then marry me,
take me to a temple. ''

512
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:23,427
''I'm homeless, take
me to your house. ''

513

518
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:16,560

me to your house. ''

Wake up now.

529
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:41,728
Have the police started
keeping girls' sandals for guns?

530
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,526
Sandals? In whose pockets?
- I see.

531
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,591
What's this?

532
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,993
Sandal? Oh come on, Ma.
You think you can fool me?

533
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:01,525
That must be some neighbour's.
- Great!

534
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:13,058
And that lipstick? Some neighbour's?

535
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:15,991
Lipstick?
- Yes.

536
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:24,426
Tell me, who is she?
- Who?

537
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:29,527
The lipstick one, the sandal one.
- Oh come off it, ma.

538
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,126
Tell me.
- Prepare my breakfast, my dress.

. .we buy clothes,
medicines for the poor.

547
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:02,591
No dear, there's no such work here.

548
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:05,058
Nothing?
- No.

549
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:08,923
One minute.

550
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,058
Who is that?

551
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,258

Your son?
- Yes.

Actually.. I got to apologise.

Apologise? For what?

556
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:38,996
For last night's antics.

557
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:45,460
I see. So that's your sandal?
- Sandal?

558
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,460
Yes.
- Where to? Come on in.

559
00:55:51,923 --> 00:55:54,458
But..

Sit!

561
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:00,223
I've had it.

562
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:12,860
Your sandals?
- These? No, not mine.

563
00:56:12,923 --> 00:56:16,926
Your sandals?

Yes.
- What jobs can you do?

566
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:32,926
Jobs? Everything that
a girl can do. - Is it?

567
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,524
Yes.
- Come with me.

568
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:42,792

Ma! Quick, I'm hungry.
I'll change after breakfast.

574
00:57:19,256 --> 00:57:22,325
Wonderful ! Looks
like a special omlette.

575
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:23,924
Anything special today?

576
00:57:28,123 --> 00:57:29,457
You? What're you doing?

577
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:32,724
I shined the clothes,
made a shoe-omelette. .

578
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:34,725
. .and ironed the breakfast.

579

No.. I goofed.
- You're still on last night's high?

580
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,926
I'm out to do social work.

581
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:45,725
Get out of here. If ma sees you,
she'll have a go at you. .

582
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:50,393
. .she'll bash you up.
- But she asked me to do all this.

583
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:52,458
Yes, I did.

584
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:55,925
What?
- Aren't you trapped?

585
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:59,258
Trapped? I'm a policeman,
I'm not in the wrong.

586
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:01,658
Yes, you're a policeman.
But if you keep switching guns. .

587
00:58:01,723 --> 00:58:05,193
. .and sandals. .

588
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:09,393
. .someday you'll make news.
- Ma, she's intruding.

589
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:12,191
I don't even know her.
- Come dear.

590
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,358
I know everything. Sit down.

591
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:22,058
Take this.
- Why're you giving her a coconut?

592
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,390
To break it on your head.

593
00:58:24,656 --> 00:58:27,658
When the girl comes
home for the first time. .

594
00:58:27,723 --> 00:58:29,991
. .you mustn't send her
empty-handed. - What do you mean?

595
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:34,726
Now out with a tenner,
and give it to her.

596

Tenner? For what?
- For her social work.

Start the practice right now.
When she comes here as a bride. .

give her your earnings.

Ma, are you out of your mind?
- Send a swift note to your family.

601
00:58:59,723 --> 00:59:00,990

I haven't got replies to
any of my earlier letters.

that I've chosen a boy.

A police inspector.

613

I will meet her, but.. - How
Iong will you keep this secret?

622
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:30,492
A family for myself
is out of question.

623
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,192
I'll have to withhold
my true identity till. .

624
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,459
. .I get Annu educated and married.

625
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:02,039
Kishan.. oh mother, you?
- Are you surprised?

626
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:06,606
No, actually.. Kishan..
- I know, Kishan called you here.

627
01:01:07,403 --> 01:01:14,676
Shall I tell you why? He
doesn't want to marry Annu. Right?

628
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:21,073
But remember something,
Amit. I like the girl.

629
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,606
Kishan will marry only her.
And you will get him to marry.

630
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,540
I? But how will I?
- I know nothing.

631
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,206
If you don't get his consent,
I'll break your leg. Get that?

632
01:01:35,003 --> 01:01:37,605
But what have I done?
- You haven't done, you have to do.

633
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:40,404
Do what?
- What I told you.

634
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,537
Kishan.

635
01:01:43,336 --> 01:01:45,538
I'll hide behind the tree. Okay?

636
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:50,741
Amit! Where are you? I'm
tired looking for you.

637
01:01:51,036 --> 01:01:54,639
What's the matter?
- Let me take a breather.

638
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:57,639
You know her?
- Who?

639
01:01:57,703 --> 01:01:59,504
She.
- Who?

640
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,040
Annu. Wonder what names they keep.

641
01:02:04,836 --> 01:02:07,772
Ma is impossible!
- What's the matter?

642
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:10,672
She wants me to marry Annu.
- So marry.

643
01:02:10,736 --> 01:02:14,439
No jokes, I don't want to marry.
- So don't.

644
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:20,041
I won't! Hey, don't be harsh.
I must say no in style.

645
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:26,508
Do something. Go to Annu,
and tell her that. .

646
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:31,573
I'm a bad man. I'm an alcoholic.

647
01:02:31,636 --> 01:02:35,906
I'm a sinner, a hypocrite. I
have all the vices that you have.

648
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,839
Are you listening? I have
no time. Got to go to work.

649
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:42,438
I'm listening, I'm also watching.

650
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,838
I don't know whom
to pay attention to.

651
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,737
I don't care about that.

652
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:49,439
But if you don't spoil
my record before her. .

653
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:50,704
. .I'll spoil your record.

654
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:53,103
My record?

655
01:02:57,036 --> 01:02:59,238
Hey, listen, one minute.

656
01:02:59,636 --> 01:03:00,970
What if the trick doesn't pay off. .

657
01:03:01,036 --> 01:03:04,372
. .and she still
insists on marrying you?

658
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:07,971
All right, don't let her sister. .

659
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:12,039
. .and brother-in-law
make it to my house.

660
01:03:12,103 --> 01:03:13,170
Call them right here.

661
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:16,372
The two of us will put the
matter to rest. You dig?

662
01:03:18,203 --> 01:03:21,573
Hang on. Despite this, if they
still insist on the wedding?

663
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:24,171
Then I'll break your leg.
- My leg?

664
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:28,172
Which leg? This one? Or this?

665
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:33,106
Let me guess! That one.
- It's already booked.

666
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:35,171
What?
- Nothing. Go on.

667
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:36,303
Crazy!

668
01:03:37,436 --> 01:03:40,705
Strange! Everyone is after my legs.

669
01:03:41,503 --> 01:03:43,371
Heed him, and
mother's after my legs.

670
01:03:43,436 --> 01:03:45,304
Heed mother, and Kishan wants them.

671
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:49,574
If I fail to deliver, my
Iegs are gone. Curse my legs!

672
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:52,172
Mother. .

673
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:56,706
She's gone.
Everyone has deserted me.

674
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:02,441
Come on out! You're only
one who never deserts me.

675
01:04:05,103 --> 01:04:08,506
You want to marry Kishan?

676
01:04:09,036 --> 01:04:11,505
He's a first-rate
dirty man ! Very mean.

677
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:16,307
If you get hooked to him, you're
going to rue it all your life.

678
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:23,506
Don't weep. Try to understand,
it's just a rumour.

679
01:04:24,936 --> 01:04:30,107
Mother says that Kishan is one
of a kind. Decent and honest.

680
01:04:30,436 --> 01:04:34,439
He's as great at heart
as great as he looks.

681
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:38,506
That means, if there's a
gentleman on earth, it's Kishan.

682
01:04:39,303 --> 01:04:40,370
But. .

683
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:44,439
r
As far as I've heard
he's a drunkard.

684
01:04:44,903 --> 01:04:47,305
Drinks imported as well as hooch.

685
01:04:47,369 --> 01:04:51,907
Visits casinos more than his office.
He's also a flirt. No matter. .

686
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:58,409
. .even if he's on duty, the
sight of a girl just lures him.

687
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:00,571
Either he gets the girl,
or he gets bashed up.

688
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:05,372
But mother says
that let alone booze. .

689
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:13,376
. .the stink of it itself stops
her son from raiding liquor dens.

690
01:05:13,836 --> 01:05:19,374
As for girls, at the sight of
them, he turns coy, like girls.

691
01:05:19,903 --> 01:05:22,238
Bashful eyes, careful banter.

692
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:24,370
But. .

693
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:29,874
Kishan says, come what may,
he won't marry Annu.

694
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:32,838
But mother says, she'll make. .

695
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:36,173
. .Annu her daughter-in-law,
at any cost.

696
01:05:37,236 --> 01:05:40,372
But..
- To hell with your buts!

697
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:44,840
Sometimes you talk in his favour,
sometimes you insult him.

698
01:05:46,236 --> 01:05:50,373
I thought you came to help me.

699
01:05:50,436 --> 01:05:54,039
But you're putting me in a quandary.

700
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:01,806
All because, I'm all alone.

701
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,772
Had my sister and
her husband been here. .

702
01:06:06,836 --> 01:06:09,305
. .you wouldn't make a butt of me.

703
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,305
I have no one who can talk for me.

704
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:20,371
Serious situation.

705
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:28,842
Now look, I'm very sentimental.
A girl in tears really moves me.

706
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,305
Well, where's your sister?

707
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:38,975
I wrote to her, but I got a reply
that they've gone on a pilgrimage.

708
01:06:39,903 --> 01:06:43,172
They can't come.
- All right, don't worry.

709
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:46,305
Tell me, do you love Kishan?
- Yes.

710
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:47,970
Truly?
- Yes.

711
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:52,774
That's it. Now I don't care.
No matter if my legs break. .

712
01:06:52,836 --> 01:06:56,239
. .or my record is spoilt, I'm
going to make Kishan fall for you!

713
01:06:56,903 --> 01:06:58,371
Or else, I'm no. .

714
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:00,103
Name?

715
01:07:00,836 --> 01:07:04,305
Name? I'm no Amit!

716
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:08,804
I'm not playing sister!

717
01:07:09,603 --> 01:07:11,805
You just know how to
interfere in others' matter.

718
01:07:11,836 --> 01:07:14,538
I'm not interfering, I'm going
to help someone settle down.

719
01:07:14,603 --> 01:07:18,206
You couldn't make my life,
at least help someone marry.

720
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:21,805
The girl is in love with
my friend, inspector Kishan.

721
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:25,603
Kishan?

722
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:31,604
What's the girl's name?
- Annu.

723
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:35,937
Annu?
- Yes.

724
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:44,207
Basanti, I've promised her. If I
don't get her married to Kishan. .

725
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:46,438
. .I'll lose face.

726
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:55,940
All right, but on one condition.
I won't show my face.

727
01:07:56,336 --> 01:08:00,473
I'll cover my face.
- Do whatever, but come on.

728
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:03,203
Fine.

729
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:07,204
I've made you help
someone else get married.

730
01:08:08,203 --> 01:08:11,873
If don't make you marry me, I'm no. .

731
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:15,537
Name?

732
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,471
Right.

733
01:08:31,536 --> 01:08:34,739
Great music. Well
I'm facing the musi'c.

734
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:43,140
No one is here as yet. Not
your sister, not her husband. .

735
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:46,539
. .not my mother, nor my lousy
friend. I think they won't turn up.

736
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:49,739
Oh no, don't say that.
They will sure come. Yes.

737
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:55,140
No, no chance. Probably they mus
t've met somewhere else. .

738
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:59,273
. .and decided against the wedding.
- Hey brother!

739
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,138
Who says the wedding won't happen?

740
01:09:08,203 --> 01:09:11,139
Who is that?
- That? He is. .

741
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:15,471
I'm the lady's brother-in-law.
- Right.

742
01:09:15,536 --> 01:09:18,672
And this is her sister.
- Yes. See, they're here.

743
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:26,677
My wife is sworn not to show her
face until her sister gets married.

744
01:09:27,469 --> 01:09:30,606
And you jerk! You
don't want to marry her?

745
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:32,138
What's wrong with the girl?

746
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:35,138
What do you mean?
- I'll tell you later.

747
01:09:37,136 --> 01:09:42,274
Tell me, what's the length?
- What?

748
01:09:42,603 --> 01:09:46,139
What's your height?
- Five-eleven.

749
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:48,471
Five-eleven? Is that fine, dear?

750
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:52,139
Fine.
- What's your weight?

751
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:55,105
62 kgs.
- 62 kgs?

752
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,572
Is that fine?
- One minute.

753
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:03,140
Yes, the weight's fine too.
- What job you do?

754
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,138
I'm an inspector.
- Ticket inspector?

755
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:07,672
No, police inspector.
- I see.

756
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:13,141
Look for the mole now.
- Oh, I forgot. One second. .

757
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:18,473
What is it about the mole?
- It's linked to her heart.

758
01:10:19,203 --> 01:10:20,604
It's in her horoscope.

759
01:10:20,669 --> 01:10:24,073
The one she'll marry will
stand five-eleven tall. .

760
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:29,407
. .weigh 62 kgs and have a black
mole. And you have all of them.

761
01:10:29,469 --> 01:10:32,472
Here's the wedding gift.
- The gift? Oh no.

762
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:36,673
The gift's for you. And
please stop pursuing me.

763
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:41,073
And find another man for the girl.
- Where to? Listen to me.

764
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:38,610
''Your marriage was
made in the heavens. ''

765
01:11:38,636 --> 01:11:41,605
''Believe it or not. .

766
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:47,074
. .this is what the mendicant says.''

767
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:53,005
''Your marriage was
made in the heavens. ''

768
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,739
''Believe it or not. .

769
01:11:56,136 --> 01:12:01,207
. .this is what the mendicant says.''

770
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:09,977
''Whatever you say.. ''

771
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:13,439
''I have nothing to do with it.''

772
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:19,141
''My marriage will take
place only with my consent.''

773
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:32,939
''Why do we need
elephants and horses?''

774
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:35,538
''Of what use is a retinue?''

775
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:42,142
''In your eyes, my love, let me be.''

776
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:45,539
''Where will you find a
girl like her again?''

777
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,673
''She moves around like a doll.''

778
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:52,005
''It takes a lot of
pining from bees. .

779
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:55,139
. .for such a rose to blossom.''

780
01:12:55,203 --> 01:13:02,877
''Go away, let me go.''

781
01:13:02,936 --> 01:13:06,072
''Do not tinkle your bangles.''

782
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:11,074
''I do not wish to be your husband.''

783
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:44,272
''Why did you gaze into her eyes?''

784
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:47,105
''Why did you rob her of her sleep?''

785
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:50,472
''Why did you gaze into her eyes?''

786
01:13:50,503 --> 01:13:53,372
''Why did you rob her of her sleep?''

787
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:59,875
''You have given me a bad name,
you stone-hearted man.''

788
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:06,008
''Beware the wrath of a Jat!
Don't you turn her down now. .''

789
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:09,206
''Quietly become the bridegroom. .

790
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:12,006
. .or be careful of this stick.''

791
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:19,810
''Do not tie me forcibly to her.''

792
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:27,877
''You could get handcuffed for this.''

793
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:48,873
''What they say is true. .''

794
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:51,405
''Love is a terrible affliction.''

795
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,806
''You have broken my heart. .''

796
01:14:54,836 --> 01:14:58,005
''I could stab myself to death.''

797
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:01,072
''Forget him, silly girl.''

798
01:15:01,136 --> 01:15:04,138
''Do not waste your lovely youth.''

799
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:07,139
''There are millions like him. .

800
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:09,939
. .and you're one in a million.''

801
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:17,810
''By God, I could die. .''

802
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:21,139
''I was putting up a fake fight.''

803
01:15:21,203 --> 01:15:26,975
''Wear this ring for me, my love.''

804
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:31,940
''Your marriage was
made in the heavens. ''

805
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:36,474
''Your marriage was
made in the heavens. ''

806
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:40,806
''Your marriage was
made in the heavens. ''

807
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:53,271
Hello.
- Listen. .

808
01:16:09,203 --> 01:16:12,072
My love, she's got her man.
What happens to me?

809
01:16:13,203 --> 01:16:16,673
God knows.
- Lady, God will know later. .

810
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:22,274
. .let me tell you now.
That's more like it.

811
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:36,874
Mr. Jaggi, I know you control all
the illegal trades in this city.

812
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:41,273
And I also know that all the
grains storehouses belong to you.

813
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:43,671
So?
- I want you to. .

814
01:16:43,736 --> 01:16:47,873
. .hand over all the
storehouses to me.

815
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:50,737
Really? What joy does it bring me?

816
01:16:50,803 --> 01:16:54,740
I want to make you my partner.

817
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:57,738
My goods will lie
in your storehouses.

818
01:16:57,803 --> 01:17:00,205
And what profits I make from them. .

819
01:17:01,003 --> 01:17:07,209
. .you will get 20 percent. Agreed.
- Let's go, son.

820
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:12,606
Why, what happened?
- I didn't know how a big man. .

821
01:17:12,636 --> 01:17:14,137
. .could talk such crap.

822
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:17,605
The storehouses are the
means of my existence.

823
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:20,606
When there is a drought,
people yearn for a morsel of food.

824
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,205
That's when I quote my
price and earn my millions.

825
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,139
And 20 percent. .

826
01:17:27,203 --> 01:17:29,605
. .is with what you're trying to
Iure me? - Then take 25 percent.

827
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:32,806
Only cheapskates
fall for petty baits.

828
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,205
Find yourself some other partner.

829
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,205
Do you know whom
you are turning down?

830
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:40,838
Silly question. Know who I am?

831
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:43,104
In minutes I can
get you behind bars.

832
01:17:43,203 --> 01:17:47,006
Mr. Vikram! We can have you hanged.

833
01:17:47,736 --> 01:17:50,004
If you don't believe,
Iook at this picture.

834
01:18:03,836 --> 01:18:08,440
Nice photo. Looks like
the job of my well-wisher.

835
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:20,371
He looks sick. Give him treatment.

836
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:22,437
I haven't done anything. Forgive me

837
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:25,305
I did nothing. Spare me, please.

838
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:27,770
Good luck.

839
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,573
I didn't know how a big
man could talk such crap.

840
01:18:35,636 --> 01:18:37,237
The storehouses. .

841
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:39,238
. .are the means of my existence.
When there is a drought. .

842
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,238
. .people yearn for a morsel of food.

843
01:18:41,303 --> 01:18:42,370
That's when I quote my price. .

844
01:18:42,436 --> 01:18:43,837
. .and earn my millions.

845
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,638
20 percent is with what
you're trying to lure me?

846
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,238
With the help of
this tape you can go. .

847
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,338
. .in for at least 10-15 years. No?

848
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:55,838
Daddy, what use squabbling?

849
01:18:56,836 --> 01:19:01,840
I speak no evil, I hear
no evil, I see no evil.

850
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:03,570
Same goes an old saying.

851
01:19:04,303 --> 01:19:06,171
So uncle, we won't
Iet the word out. .

852
01:19:06,236 --> 01:19:08,771
. .we won't display the photo either.

853
01:19:09,236 --> 01:19:13,306
And you'll not let anyone hear
the tape. Am I right, uncle?

854
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:17,307
Daddy, say something.
- Your son is smarter than you.

855
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:18,437
Thank you.

856
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:23,674
All right. You hold my
weak point, I hold yours.

857
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:25,671
Compromise is a must.

858
01:19:27,303 --> 01:19:33,175
Here's the negative.
- We'll lock our weaknesses safely.

859
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:39,241
The safe will have two
keys that we shall share.

860
01:19:40,169 --> 01:19:44,574
Done? - We'll go
fifty-fifty on the profits.

861
01:19:44,636 --> 01:19:45,703
Done?

862
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,238
Done.
- Thank you.

863
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:54,174
Kishan, he's the one
who came to bribe my son.

864
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:56,505
But my son refused.

865
01:19:56,570 --> 01:20:00,573
I feel he's the one
who killed my son.

866
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:06,174
If he's responsible for uncle
Khan's death, then trust me. .

867
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:08,905
. .this time I'm not sparing him.

868
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:12,572
Who are you talking about, son?
- Uncle Khan's assassin.

869
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:16,705
Let me see who it is. .

870
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:19,370
Your dress is stained.

871
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:27,204
Can't see it properly.

872
01:20:29,703 --> 01:20:35,375
The day I arrest him,
you'll see him, ma.

873
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:43,772
Someone is here to see you, boss.
- Send him in.

874
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:49,370
Come in.

875
01:20:54,503 --> 01:20:55,570
Hello.

876
01:20:56,169 --> 01:20:58,639
Hello. Are you Mr. Vikram?
- Yes.

877
01:20:59,303 --> 01:21:01,705
I'm Inspector Kishan. Can I sit?

878
01:21:04,203 --> 01:21:05,704
Please sit.
- Thank you.

879
01:21:08,503 --> 01:21:12,640
What can I do for you?
- I want a favour.

880
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:18,107
Tell me.
- I hear, you're kind to the police.

881
01:21:19,236 --> 01:21:23,106
Sorry, sorry. I've never
kept connections with policemen.

882
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:27,106
You're misinformed.
- No, the information is accurate.

883
01:21:27,636 --> 01:21:31,239
You tried to offer
inspector Khan a big amount.

884
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,504
He was murdered recently.

885
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:35,837
Inspector Khan?
- Yes.

886
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:40,706
Inspector Khan? I've heard the name.

887
01:21:42,169 --> 01:21:44,305
Yes, I read in the papers.
But I don't know him.

888
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:48,506
Big men hardly remember
trivial matters. Well. .

889
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,105
I got a request. If you
offer me what you tried to. .

890
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:54,106
. .offer inspector Khan. .

891
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:57,106
. .then I promise..
what unlawful things. .

892
01:21:57,169 --> 01:22:00,773
. .you wanted him
to do, I'll do them.

893
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:06,574
Unlawful things? I guess
you are a new recruit.

894
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:09,038
You mustn't intimidate a
gentleman without evidence.

895
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,738
Don't you know?

896
01:22:13,036 --> 01:22:16,239
Son, come up with some evidence,
and then talk to me.

897
01:22:17,036 --> 01:22:21,440
It's time for my dinner. I
don't talk while eating. Get out!

898
01:22:23,036 --> 01:22:27,640
Fine, Vikram Singh. Go on,
tonight you have home cooked food.

899
01:22:29,169 --> 01:22:34,108
I'm no Kishan Kapoor unless
I make you eat prison food.

900
01:22:38,169 --> 01:22:41,039
Boss, ever since this
inspector has been here. .

901
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,171
. .he has been a menace.

902
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,538
That's what they said
about inspector Khan too.

903
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:50,039
But I got my men to kill this one.
- Then?

904
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:57,040
There's one man. He needs
money. To build a temple.

905
01:22:57,103 --> 01:23:00,372
Idiot rogues!

906
01:23:01,503 --> 01:23:06,975
Put your hands in your pockets
to save yourself from apocalypse.

907
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:09,104
How dare you refuse?

908
01:23:10,103 --> 01:23:14,373
Climb down, son!
You'll die if you fall.

909
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,973
Let me die. I wish I
were stillborn! I'd have..

910
01:23:18,003 --> 01:23:21,239
. .spared of these bad faces.

911
01:23:21,503 --> 01:23:23,972
This bad neighbourhood
is a pile of misers!

912
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:27,172
Shameless! Go and drown yourselves!

913
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,972
To buy a movie ticket
in the black-market. .

914
01:23:30,036 --> 01:23:32,104
. .they shell out hundreds.

915
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:33,237
But when it comes to
donate for the temple. .

916
01:23:33,303 --> 01:23:34,370
. .they are cash strapped.

917
01:23:35,369 --> 01:23:37,371
Right opportunity. Tell him to jump.

918
01:23:37,436 --> 01:23:38,703
We'll build the rest of the temple.

919
01:23:41,036 --> 01:23:46,374
Amit! Jump off. We'll
build the rest of the temple.

920
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:49,172
Come again!
- Jump off.

921
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:50,671
We'll build the rest of the temple.

922
01:23:51,203 --> 01:23:53,204
Why didn't you say that before?

923
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:55,504
You got me up here for no reasons.

924
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:59,506
Hang on, I'll jump.

925
01:24:00,303 --> 01:24:01,370
I'll jump, okay?

926
01:24:02,436 --> 01:24:05,305
Coming. One. .

927
01:24:06,436 --> 01:24:07,503
. .two. .

928
01:24:08,436 --> 01:24:09,503
. .three?

929
01:24:10,903 --> 01:24:13,905
No, no, no. Who
guarantees that the temple..

930
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:17,306
. .will be built after my death?

931
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:23,040
What if they cheat
on you after I'm gone?

932
01:24:24,003 --> 01:24:26,972
Man, I got brains too. Right?

933
01:24:27,303 --> 01:24:34,510
Son of a gun! If you have brains,
use. And climb down, moron!

934
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,440
The old man is right.
Absolutely right.

935
01:24:39,903 --> 01:24:42,505
I was drugged and sent up here.

936
01:24:43,103 --> 01:24:46,105
Now they want to send me to heaven.

937
01:24:47,036 --> 01:24:53,175
Bad cheats! Thank God, I
didn't jump. I'd have died.

938
01:24:54,036 --> 01:25:00,575
Had I died, how could I have
faced Goddess Durga. I'm broke.

939
01:25:02,236 --> 01:25:05,238
You conned me, I'm stranded.

940
01:25:05,836 --> 01:25:08,371
For such a trivial
thing you sent me up here.

941
01:25:09,236 --> 01:25:12,973
I started building you, but
who will finish building you?

942
01:25:13,036 --> 01:25:14,103
My Father?

943
01:25:14,836 --> 01:25:17,038
Had I a father I'd
have begged of him.

944
01:25:17,103 --> 01:25:20,039
He'd have come looking for me

945
01:25:20,236 --> 01:25:23,906
If not in person, he'd have
at least sent someone to me.

946
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:29,240
Today I realise, in times of
need you can rely only on friends.

947
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,139
Listen here, who is Amit?
- Up there.

948
01:25:34,836 --> 01:25:36,837
When will friends come?

949
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:40,973
And when will this
temple be built? I'm broke.

950
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:46,440
Amit, come down. My boss wants you.

951
01:25:46,836 --> 01:25:47,903
Hurry up and come down.

952
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:53,842
Tell your boss to come up
here. I'm not coming down. .

953
01:25:53,903 --> 01:26:00,376
. .until this temple is built. -
Come down. Boss will give you money.

954
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:04,473
Is it? I'm coming.

955
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:09,307
Hang on, I'm coming. Coming.

956
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:13,372
Money! Like a Skylab,
I'll shoot down.

957
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:19,174
Me and my intoxication! Zoom!

958
01:26:28,736 --> 01:26:30,137
How's the temple work going?

959
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:38,074
Who's that? The temple
work is going on fine. But. .

960
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:42,872
Who are you? Why don't you face me?
- Just answer my questions.

961
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:47,406
Sure, ask.
- I hear you need 50,OOO more. .

962
01:26:47,436 --> 01:26:51,506
. .for the temple.
- Well yes, I do need.

963
01:26:52,736 --> 01:26:56,873
I can give you
50,OOO on one condition.

964
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:01,941
Condition? Well, any conditions
accepted. I can even give my life.

965
01:27:02,403 --> 01:27:06,406
Not to give, you got to
take a life. - Sure, I will. .

966
01:27:09,403 --> 01:27:14,074
Take a life?
- Yes. This man's life.

967
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:20,373
Oh no, I just joked. I can't kill.

968
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:25,340
Ask me to vandalize, ask me to hit
someone, ask me to kidnap someone.

969
01:27:25,403 --> 01:27:29,940
I can do all that. But murder..
playing with knives.. God forbid!

970
01:27:30,669 --> 01:27:33,539
My sandal is my best weapon.
This is what I use.

971
01:27:46,669 --> 01:27:49,739
He.. he is inspector Kishan.

972
01:27:51,336 --> 01:27:52,737
You want him murdered?
- Yes.

973
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:57,573
Why didn't you tell me before?
He's my sworn enemy.

974
01:27:58,803 --> 01:28:02,873
But sir, first the dough.
- Here's 25,OOO.

975
01:28:03,869 --> 01:28:06,539
The rest, after the job is executed.

976
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:12,406
Fine. Keep the 25,OOO ready.

977
01:28:12,803 --> 01:28:15,605
You'll find his corpse
within 24 hours in the sea.

978
01:28:15,936 --> 01:28:17,003
Listen. .

979
01:28:17,403 --> 01:28:20,272
Yes? - Not in the sea.
I want him killed..

980
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:23,539
. .right before my eyes, during the
festival of Navratri, in your temple.

981
01:28:24,536 --> 01:28:28,006
Idiot! At least you
should've seen his face.

982
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,505
How could I? He was
sitting behind tinted glass.

983
01:28:31,303 --> 01:28:35,006
I was led blindfolded in and out.
That leaves the hideout unknown.

984
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:40,006
Then it's difficult. What to do?
- What else? I'll kill you.

985
01:28:40,936 --> 01:28:44,005
What? - What else?
He'll be there in person.

986
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:47,272
He has paid me. Albeit, for
the temple. How can I betray him?

987
01:28:47,603 --> 01:28:52,407
Are you drunk?
- No, but I've got something. Look.

988
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:56,472
I'll use this to
kill you. Like this. .

989
01:28:56,869 --> 01:29:01,474
Why're you scared? This is just a
toy knife. This is how it works.

990
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:07,675
On that particular day, it'll
be coloured red. Got the idea?

991
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:13,475
Got it. But make
sure you bring this one.

992
01:29:13,869 --> 01:29:16,939
If by mistake you get a
real one, I'll be sacrificed.

993
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,806
I'll certainly offer a sacrifice,
but it won't be you.

994
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:24,271
You mean it?
- Yes.

995
01:29:46,203 --> 01:29:53,476
''Save us from the claws
of evil, Goddess Mother.''

996
01:29:53,803 --> 01:30:00,876
''Save us from the claws
of evil, Goddess Mother.''

997
01:30:01,203 --> 01:30:08,643
''Glory be to the Goddess Mother.''

998
01:30:09,503 --> 01:30:15,408
''You are the greatest. ''

999
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:19,206
''Astride upon a lion. You ride, on
the highest mountain You dwell.''

1000
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:23,741
''I'm in a bind.. set things right.''

1001
01:30:23,803 --> 01:30:29,475
''You are the greatest of all.''

1002
01:30:29,536 --> 01:30:33,339
''Astride upon a lion. You ride, on
the highest mountain You dwell.''

1003
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:38,141
''I'm in a bind.. set things right.''

1004
01:30:38,169 --> 01:30:43,642
''You are the greatest of all.''

1005
01:30:43,736 --> 01:30:47,539
''Astride upon a lion. You ride, on
the highest mountain You dwell.''

1006
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:52,341
''I'm in a bind.. set things right.''

1007
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:33,745
''It's a trying moment,
calamity has befallen.''

1008
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:37,539
''You must a show us a way out.''

1009
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:41,473
''This world has shut all doors.''

1010
01:31:41,536 --> 01:31:45,273
''This world has shut all doors.''

1011
01:31:45,303 --> 01:31:50,574
''My life has become a
struggle, O Goddess.''

1012
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:57,075
''I'm in a predicament, O Goddess,
set things right.''

1013
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:02,541
''You are the greatest of all.''

1014
01:32:02,603 --> 01:32:06,473
''Astride upon a lion you ride, on
the highest mountain You dwell.''

1015
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:11,274
''I'm in a predicament, O Goddess,
set things right.''

1016
01:32:50,403 --> 01:32:55,007
''O destroyer of evil.. ''

1017
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:58,672
''You brighten up our lives.''

1018
01:33:00,003 --> 01:33:04,140
''For the lonely. .''

1019
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:06,605
''You are Succour.''

1020
01:33:06,669 --> 01:33:10,407
''You are Succour''

1021
01:33:10,603 --> 01:33:17,743
''Heaven and earth offer salutations
to You, O Mother Goddess.''

1022
01:33:18,003 --> 01:33:22,273
''I'm in a predicament, O Goddess,
set things right.''

1023
01:33:22,336 --> 01:33:27,574
''You are the greatest of all.''

1024
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:31,440
''Astride upon a lion you ride, on
the highest mountain You dwell.''

1025
01:33:31,503 --> 01:33:36,474
''I'm in a predicament,
O Goddess, help me.''

1026
01:33:41,336 --> 01:33:43,471
What's delaying the
sacrifice to the Goddess?

1027
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:55,942
''Who do I offer as a
sacrifice to please You?''

1028
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:02,943
''Enemies shudder at Your wrath.''

1029
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:10,143
''Enemies shudder at Your wrath.''

1030
01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:41,271
What happened to her?

1031
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,406
What happened?
- Nothing, she just fainted.

1032
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:57,271
Summon a doctor!
- Wait.

1033
01:34:59,869 --> 01:35:03,340
Why do you need a
doctor when we are here?

1034
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:08,507
This is a house of God. Not
medicines, miracles work here.

1035
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,072
But priest..
- No buts. I'll bring him to life.

1036
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,539
Do you have a room here?
- Nearby is a cottage.

1037
01:35:16,869 --> 01:35:19,939
Pick the lad and put him in my arms.

1038
01:35:21,403 --> 01:35:22,470
Careful.

1039
01:35:29,203 --> 01:35:33,807
Wait. I shall perform this miracle
in complete privacy. Wait for me.

1040
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:40,073
Kishan! Open the door!

1041
01:36:43,803 --> 01:36:48,140
What happened, Kishan?
- He ran off.

1042
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:50,204
Kishan. Kishan.

1043
01:36:55,003 --> 01:36:59,807
Are you all right, Kishan?
- I can't see a thing, Amit.

1044
01:36:59,869 --> 01:37:01,805
What?
- I can see nothing.

1045
01:37:02,203 --> 01:37:06,540
I can't see.
- Kishan!

1046
01:37:18,403 --> 01:37:21,272
Doctor, his eyes?
- Corneal blindness.

1047
01:37:24,036 --> 01:37:29,341
Doctor, do something. He's
the only support I have.

1048
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:31,938
Restore his eyesight somehow.

1049
01:37:34,336 --> 01:37:40,208
I've heard of eye transplant
that can restore one's eyesight.

1050
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:44,206
Can it be done in his case?
- Chances are there.

1051
01:37:44,736 --> 01:37:48,206
Then give my eyes to him,
doctor. He needs eyes more I do.

1052
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:51,939
Besides, my eyes have seen
nothing but hell and nasty things.

1053
01:37:52,936 --> 01:37:55,738
It's not possible. In such cases,
we can use only those eyes. .

1054
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,406
. .that are destroyed due
to cortical blindness.

1055
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,005
But at the moment, the eye
banks haven't any of that type.

1056
01:38:03,203 --> 01:38:07,807
Still you must apply for the eyes.
- Okay.

1057
01:38:18,736 --> 01:38:24,341
What's on your mind, son?
- I'm evil.

1058
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:28,305
All my life I've been treading
along evil paths, breaking the law.

1059
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,371
That's why my I don't expect
much out of life and destiny.

1060
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,137
But. .

1061
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:38,673
. .but your son is a
decent and honest man.

1062
01:38:39,669 --> 01:38:43,006
And what did life offer him? You
made him follow the path of truth.

1063
01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:47,674
And what did you get in return?
- What do those mothers get. .

1064
01:38:47,736 --> 01:38:51,873
. .whose sons take on enemy
bullets and get martyred?

1065
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:56,672
If every mother clutches
her son to her bosom. .

1066
01:38:56,736 --> 01:39:00,072
. .then no country in the
world will enjoy freedom.

1067
01:39:01,103 --> 01:39:06,274
And no mother will have the
pride of calling her son a martyr.

1068
01:39:07,936 --> 01:39:13,207
Well Amit, can you debate on that?

1069
01:39:17,136 --> 01:39:22,207
I have no answer to mother's point.
But I can certainly answer back. .

1070
01:39:22,936 --> 01:39:25,938
. .the one who snatched your
eyesight. - No, my friend.

1071
01:39:26,603 --> 01:39:29,806
In a frenzy, don't do
something that goes against the law.

1072
01:39:29,869 --> 01:39:32,138
I know not what's for
and what's against the law.

1073
01:39:33,036 --> 01:39:36,038
All I know is that
someone snatched your eyesight.

1074
01:39:37,036 --> 01:39:39,872
I can't be at peace
unless I destroy him.

1075
01:39:41,603 --> 01:39:43,604
No Amit, this is no answer to it.

1076
01:39:44,736 --> 01:39:47,939
If you have an answer, this is it.

1077
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:55,008
Yes, my friend. Wear the
uniform and take my place.

1078
01:39:57,603 --> 01:40:02,674
Police uniform? How can I wear it?

1079
01:40:05,803 --> 01:40:12,109
You know that when the night
sets in, I need liquor for support.

1080
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:15,605
I'm also aware of that. And I
also know that for nine nights. .

1081
01:40:15,669 --> 01:40:19,073
. .in a year, you abstain from
drinks for the Goddess Durga.

1082
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:25,608
Can't you stop drinking for my sake?
You consider me your mother, too.

1083
01:40:26,536 --> 01:40:27,737
My name is also Durga.

1084
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:46,606
Agreed, Amit is your friend.
What's surprising is that. .

1085
01:40:47,936 --> 01:40:49,537
. .an intelligent and responsible
officer like you speaks. .

1086
01:40:49,603 --> 01:40:50,937
. .in favour of him.

1087
01:40:52,536 --> 01:40:57,540
You're recommending a man who
never ever cared for the law.

1088
01:40:58,669 --> 01:41:00,538
Picking up fights and
arson are his hobbies.

1089
01:41:01,003 --> 01:41:05,006
His greatest weakness is booze.
Without booze, he gets quivers.

1090
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:10,007
It takes more than a couple of
drinks to quell the fire in him.

1091
01:41:11,603 --> 01:41:15,573
That's the fire that
only the booze can quell.

1092
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:19,139
But you haven't seen the
fire that razed his childhood.

1093
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:24,808
As a child, before he could realise,
he saw himself in a liquor den.

1094
01:41:25,803 --> 01:41:30,474
At an age when parents tend to
kids, he was carrying stoned men. .

1095
01:41:30,536 --> 01:41:35,007
. .to their houses, which
earned him two square meals.

1096
01:41:37,936 --> 01:41:42,540
You can find many patrons of
decency amidst gentlemen. .

1097
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:46,472
. .but seldom are those found, who,
after consuming the poison of crime. .

1098
01:41:46,503 --> 01:41:50,073
. .still harbour a desire to
follow the path of righteousness.

1099
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:52,104
Call Amit.

1100
01:41:58,203 --> 01:41:59,470
Hello sir.

1101
01:41:59,803 --> 01:42:04,207
So, you want to join the police?
- Yes sir. If you oblige me.

1102
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:08,005
I'm not illiterate, sir. I'm
educated, cleared matriculation.

1103
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:12,473
Life offered me no support, so
I used to study during nights. .

1104
01:42:12,536 --> 01:42:16,473
. .under the lamppost on the
streets. This is my certificate.

1105
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:27,407
Sir, give me one chance. I
grew up amidst crime and sin. .

1106
01:42:27,603 --> 01:42:31,139
. .so I know the root causes of all
evil. Breweries, gambling dens. .

1107
01:42:31,403 --> 01:42:33,404
.. black-market storehouses, smugglers
hangouts.. I know everything.

1108
01:42:34,403 --> 01:42:39,474
Sir, iron cuts iron. I
grew up amidst criminals.

1109
01:42:39,936 --> 01:42:44,006
I shall erase the criminals.
Give me one chance, please.

1110
01:42:48,003 --> 01:42:49,871
Give me one chance to
wear this uniform, sir.

1111
01:42:50,803 --> 01:42:54,439
If I fail to honour the uniform,
if I fail to honour my friend. .

1112
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:59,006
. .you have every right to
rip my uniform and my skin off.

1113
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:03,072
All right, I'll think about it.

1114
01:43:04,403 --> 01:43:05,470
Thank you, sir.

1115
01:43:15,136 --> 01:43:16,403
Basanti.

1116
01:43:19,736 --> 01:43:23,872
No clients yet, and you're
already here to drive them out?

1117
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:28,974
No Basanti, tonight I'm not here
to pick up a fight. I want help.

1118
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:30,937
What is it?

1119
01:43:32,869 --> 01:43:37,407
Look, I got a bottle.
- Nothing new about it.

1120
01:43:37,936 --> 01:43:40,672
It's in your hand now, in a
while it'll go right into your head.

1121
01:43:41,869 --> 01:43:45,740
No Basanti, tonight I'm not here
to drink. I want to quit drinking. .

1122
01:43:46,869 --> 01:43:47,937
.. forever.

1123
01:43:51,736 --> 01:43:55,940
Must be last night's hangover.
- Believe me, I mean it.

1124
01:43:58,669 --> 01:44:03,441
If you help me tonight,
I'll quit booze forever.

1125
01:44:04,336 --> 01:44:10,008
If you have a soft corner for
me, or even if you pity me. .

1126
01:44:10,736 --> 01:44:13,538
. .then stop me. Sing, dance,
do what you want. .

1127
01:44:13,603 --> 01:44:15,538
. .but keep me away from booze.

1128
01:44:16,336 --> 01:44:19,939
If I don't drink tonight,
I'll never drink for good.

1129
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:23,670
Will you help me?

1130
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:28,873
Fine. If not you,
maybe someone else.

1131
01:45:02,936 --> 01:45:05,605
''Tonight is the test.''

1132
01:45:06,503 --> 01:45:13,610
''Tonight is the test.''

1133
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:19,208
''You're my guest for tonight.''

1134
01:45:21,736 --> 01:45:24,338
''Tonight is the test.''

1135
01:45:25,603 --> 01:45:30,407
''The intoxication in my
eyes will break the bottle.''

1136
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:35,675
''I shall not let you drink,
no I shall not.''

1137
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:40,841
''The intoxication in my
eyes will break the bottle.''

1138
01:45:41,203 --> 01:45:46,207
''I shall not let you drink,
no I shall not.''

1139
01:45:46,336 --> 01:45:48,738
''It's a challenge. .

1140
01:45:51,203 --> 01:45:53,605
. .for me.''

1141
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:56,538
''It's a challenge. .

1142
01:45:59,203 --> 01:46:01,738
. .for you.''

1143
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:29,208
''You've been drinking for ages,
living a miserable life. .''

1144
01:46:29,669 --> 01:46:34,474
''You've been drinking for ages,
living a miserable life. .

1145
01:46:35,203 --> 01:46:39,807
. .being a slave to liquor.''

1146
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:42,604
''Do not destroy yourself. ''

1147
01:46:43,336 --> 01:46:45,337
''Oh, don't be upset with me.''

1148
01:46:45,803 --> 01:46:50,607
''I can rid you of sorrows,
tonight I'm ecstatic.''

1149
01:46:51,303 --> 01:46:53,471
''No matter how thirsty you are. .

1150
01:46:53,869 --> 01:46:56,205
I I
. .come to me.

1151
01:46:56,603 --> 01:46:59,272
''Intoxication is the key. .''

1152
01:46:59,336 --> 01:47:01,738
''It hardly matters if
it is water or booze''

1153
01:47:01,803 --> 01:47:06,607
''I won't stop you from
getting drunk, but your life. .

1154
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:09,872
. .means my life.''

1155
01:47:12,536 --> 01:47:15,205
''It's a test''

1156
01:47:15,803 --> 01:47:18,205
''It's a challenge. .

1157
01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:23,139
. .for you.''

1158
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:58,738
''O young drunkard. .

1159
01:47:59,536 --> 01:48:01,537
. .booze is evil.''

1160
01:48:02,203 --> 01:48:04,271
''O young drunkard. .

1161
01:48:04,803 --> 01:48:06,804
. .booze is evil.''

1162
01:48:13,136 --> 01:48:15,137
''You have me before you.''

1163
01:48:15,603 --> 01:48:17,671
''And I have you before me.''

1164
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:22,807
''Yet ours heart are burdened, and
the bottle of booze is an enemy.''

1165
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:28,174
''In the bottle you're mirrored,
and in this gathering I'm bound. ''

1166
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:34,142
''Swim across the oceans,
come and embrace me. ''

1167
01:48:34,203 --> 01:48:38,073
''Don't drink the poison,
for tonight. .

1168
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:42,273
. .I give in to you.''

1169
01:48:44,536 --> 01:48:47,138
''Tonight's the test. ''

1170
01:48:47,803 --> 01:48:50,205
''It's a challenge. .

1171
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:55,072
. .for you.''

1172
01:49:18,703 --> 01:49:19,770
The bottle. .

1173
01:49:21,503 --> 01:49:22,570
I broke it, Basanti.

1174
01:49:24,703 --> 01:49:27,038
Look.. Iook. .

1175
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:31,907
I broke the bottle. I broke
the bottle of booze, Basanti.

1176
01:49:33,103 --> 01:49:36,940
I've got rid of this poison.
I'll never booze again.

1177
01:49:38,103 --> 01:49:42,974
I swear by you, Basanti, I
shall never drink again.

1178
01:49:44,503 --> 01:49:45,570
Never.

1179
01:49:57,236 --> 01:49:58,503
Mother. .

1180
01:49:59,169 --> 01:50:01,572
What?
- Take a look, mother.

1181
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,640
Look what you have made out of a
drunkard. I used to break the law.

1182
01:50:05,836 --> 01:50:08,505
You've made me a guardian of
the law. Here, have a sweet.

1183
01:50:09,203 --> 01:50:10,504
Open your mouth.

1184
01:50:11,503 --> 01:50:12,971
Where's Kishan?
- Inside.

1185
01:50:13,503 --> 01:50:19,508
Kishan, see here. How do
I look in the uniform?

1186
01:50:22,436 --> 01:50:24,971
Sorry. I wish you could see.

1187
01:50:26,103 --> 01:50:28,438
Can't I see?

1188
01:50:30,036 --> 01:50:32,638
Nice uniform.

1189
01:50:33,636 --> 01:50:34,703
Ma. .

1190
01:50:34,903 --> 01:50:40,642
Ma, ward him off the evil eye.

1191
01:50:41,836 --> 01:50:46,707
How I wish you both were in uniform.

1192
01:50:47,036 --> 01:50:50,639
So what if either of us
wears it. It's one and the same.

1193
01:50:50,836 --> 01:50:53,638
We're two bodies, but one soul.
- Right mother.

1194
01:50:54,169 --> 01:50:58,107
Now watch his brains
and my power at work.

1195
01:50:58,636 --> 01:51:00,704
We'll break the faces of
those who break the law.

1196
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,837
What happened?

1197
01:51:31,036 --> 01:51:32,904
You drive.
- I? No way.

1198
01:51:32,970 --> 01:51:34,037
C'mon, I'm with you.

1199
01:51:35,103 --> 01:51:36,370
Amit!

1200
01:51:36,436 --> 01:51:37,503
The clutch.

1201
01:51:42,703 --> 01:51:44,771
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1202
01:51:45,369 --> 01:51:52,376
''Your friendship means
more to me than my life. ''

1203
01:51:52,836 --> 01:51:55,038
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1204
01:51:55,436 --> 01:52:02,376
''Your friendship is dearer
to me than my own life. ''

1205
01:52:02,636 --> 01:52:07,374
''In friendship, we
are incomparable.. ''

1206
01:52:07,503 --> 01:52:12,374
''We make a terrific duo.''

1207
01:52:12,703 --> 01:52:14,571
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1208
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:22,310
''Your friendship means
more to me than my life. ''

1209
01:52:42,703 --> 01:52:47,307
''What do I look at? And when?''

1210
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:52,508
''It's through your eyes
that I look at the world. ''

1211
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:58,308
''I swear it on you,
these hands might be mine. .

1212
01:52:58,369 --> 01:53:04,509
. .but the strength
in them is all yours.''

1213
01:53:04,903 --> 01:53:06,904
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1214
01:53:07,436 --> 01:53:14,509
''Your friendship is
dearer to me than my own life''

1215
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:44,907
''My heart bears your picture.''

1216
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:49,774
''My heart bears your picture.''

1217
01:53:50,303 --> 01:53:54,707
''You are my fate,
you are my destiny.''

1218
01:53:54,903 --> 01:53:59,440
''Whatever the two of you say. .''

1219
01:53:59,836 --> 01:54:01,671
''I always heard.''

1220
01:54:02,236 --> 01:54:06,773
''But listen to me ,n, ow..
it's my turn.

1221
01:54:07,503 --> 01:54:09,571
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1222
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:16,910
''Your friendship means
more to me than my life. ''

1223
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:35,606
What insolence is this, son?
- No, son. Police.

1224
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:38,238
Your business closes down.

1225
01:55:17,836 --> 01:55:21,105
No, Kishan. Don't shoot..
spare the old man.

1226
01:55:21,703 --> 01:55:22,770
Get lost!

1227
01:55:51,103 --> 01:55:56,107
''We're the days
and nights of youth. ''

1228
01:55:56,236 --> 01:56:00,773
''We're the days
and nights of youth. ''

1229
01:56:01,169 --> 01:56:05,774
''As if we've been
together since we were kids.''

1230
01:56:05,836 --> 01:56:10,574
''My heart and life
belong to my friend. .''

1231
01:56:11,103 --> 01:56:12,704
''What do I possess?''

1232
01:56:13,103 --> 01:56:18,107
''Even this uniform
belongs to the government''

1233
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:20,571
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1234
01:56:21,169 --> 01:56:28,110
''Your friendship means
more to me than my life. ''

1235
01:56:28,436 --> 01:56:33,107
''We are incomparable.. ''

1236
01:56:33,369 --> 01:56:38,108
''We make a terrific duo.''

1237
01:56:38,436 --> 01:56:40,437
''Listen, ye friend.. ''

1238
01:56:41,103 --> 01:56:48,109
''Your friendship is dearer
to me than my own life. ''

1239
01:57:23,536 --> 01:57:28,607
Daddy, we've made Vikram our partner,
but there's a risk I figure.

1240
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:33,073
I hope, he doesn't take over the
storehouses and leave us gaping.

1241
01:57:35,603 --> 01:57:37,938
Son, you know your
father, don't you?

1242
01:57:38,936 --> 01:57:42,673
In the illegal trade, millions
venture in and bite the dust.

1243
01:57:43,536 --> 01:57:47,539
And you father? Look how far he
has come. All because of his brains.

1244
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:54,173
Once Vikram's goods
arrive here, we'll seize them.

1245
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:56,070
It's me, Kishan.

1246
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:14,071
Hey cockeye! Where
are you running off to?

1247
01:59:16,003 --> 01:59:18,138
Do anything. Engage
the biggest lawyer.

1248
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:20,605
Get my son released. Go, hurry up.

1249
01:59:20,669 --> 01:59:24,807
Jaggi! I'm ruined. I'm undone.

1250
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:28,539
What is it?
- What kind of boy did you sell me?

1251
01:59:28,603 --> 01:59:32,406
I reared him with my blood.
- Not blood, liquor.

1252
01:59:32,436 --> 01:59:36,840
Yes, but I reared him. I taught
him the intricacies of my trade.

1253
01:59:37,403 --> 01:59:41,874
But he used it against me. He
has become a police officer.

1254
01:59:41,936 --> 01:59:45,005
Know what he did the first thing?
- What?

1255
01:59:45,536 --> 01:59:47,804
He shut my shop.
- How can I help it?

1256
01:59:48,403 --> 01:59:52,406
For the sake of our longstanding
friendship, help me so that. .

1257
01:59:52,536 --> 01:59:55,405
. .I can make a footing for myself
again. - I'm not magnanimous enough. .

1258
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:58,539
. .to help the disabled.
- Don't say that, Jaggi.

1259
01:59:58,669 --> 02:00:01,739
There was a day when you
were hard put, and I helped you.

1260
02:00:02,403 --> 02:00:04,071
Look, I'm not in the right
frame of mind. Get out of here.

1261
02:00:04,403 --> 02:00:07,005
Give him a tenner and
throw him out! - A tenner?

1262
02:00:07,403 --> 02:00:10,906
What else? 25,OOO, eh? Take
the tenner or get lost! Out!

1263
02:00:11,003 --> 02:00:12,037
You cripple!

1264
02:00:13,603 --> 02:00:14,670
Take this.

1265
02:00:15,869 --> 02:00:21,942
All right, Jaggi. I shall
remember this day. You must too!

1266
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:28,074
Damn you, Jaggi! You had me
thrown out, eh? I'll fix you!

1267
02:00:29,936 --> 02:00:32,672
Can't you see, cripple?
Want the other leg broken too?

1268
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,805
Vikram Singh?
- Move it, driver.

1269
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:41,673
Stop the car. Hello sir.

1270
02:00:42,336 --> 02:00:44,971
You don't know me, but
I know you very well.

1271
02:00:45,869 --> 02:00:50,341
Me?
- Yes. We're in the same trade.

1272
02:00:50,936 --> 02:00:52,003
What?

1273
02:00:52,336 --> 02:00:57,808
What sets us apart is the volume.

1274
02:00:57,936 --> 02:01:03,741
I'm in bad weather. Even Jaggi
had me thrown out of his house.

1275
02:01:03,936 --> 02:01:06,338
Please offer me a job.

1276
02:01:07,070 --> 02:01:11,407
I'm cripple, but I got
the brains and the skills.

1277
02:01:15,036 --> 02:01:19,874
Good. Let's see how
trustworthy you are.

1278
02:01:20,736 --> 02:01:23,472
Come to my office tomorrow morning.
- Okay sir.

1279
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:32,271
Cheers!

1280
02:01:32,736 --> 02:01:35,271
To the cop who
committed the mistake. .

1281
02:01:35,336 --> 02:01:38,005
. .of taking me on
and lost his eyesight.

1282
02:01:38,869 --> 02:01:41,606
Pretty soon he'll lose his life too.

1283
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:49,907
But his friend is still alive.
Through my eyes, he'll see.

1284
02:01:50,869 --> 02:01:53,672
And his uniform is what I
use to discharge my duties.

1285
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:28,138
What's the matter, inspector?
- Nothing.

1286
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:41,009
Goddess, tonight is Karwa Chouth.
A married woman observes a fast. .

1287
02:05:42,236 --> 02:05:43,303
. .all through the day and
breaks it in the night. .

1288
02:05:43,403 --> 02:05:44,504
. .after she sees her husband.

1289
02:05:46,136 --> 02:05:47,470
But I'm not so fortunate.

1290
02:06:06,836 --> 02:06:07,903
You?

1291
02:06:09,903 --> 02:06:12,939
You, here? How come you're bleeding?

1292
02:06:13,636 --> 02:06:19,108
My enemies! All my enemies are
after me. I'm punished for my sins.

1293
02:06:19,903 --> 02:06:22,772
When I was evil, they
wanted me to change my ways.

1294
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:25,571
Now that.. I've turned a new leaf. .

1295
02:06:25,636 --> 02:06:28,572
. .the same guys want to
drag me into the filth again.

1296
02:06:28,903 --> 02:06:33,707
They all want to kill me. For a
while, Durga, hide me somewhere.

1297
02:06:34,903 --> 02:06:37,105
Come.. come.

1298
02:06:38,503 --> 02:06:41,973
Don't tell anyone that
I've been shot. - I won't.

1299
02:06:45,036 --> 02:06:46,704
I'm an idiot, Durga.

1300
02:06:47,903 --> 02:06:52,140
One day you came to
me seeking justice.

1301
02:06:53,103 --> 02:06:56,773
But I humiliated you and had
you thrown out. And this day. .

1302
02:06:57,503 --> 02:07:02,908
. .when my life fell in danger,
I'm brought to your doorstep.

1303
02:07:03,503 --> 02:07:07,506
Don't say that.
- I was high on alcohol then. .

1304
02:07:07,570 --> 02:07:12,241
. .and I refused to even acknowledge
you. But believe me, Durga. .

1305
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:17,974
. .since then, I
never found happiness.

1306
02:07:19,436 --> 02:07:23,873
Durga, I'm not worthy of it. .

1307
02:07:24,936 --> 02:07:29,440
. .but if you can, please forgive me.

1308
02:07:29,503 --> 02:07:30,570
Oh no, what're you doing?

1309
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:33,904
No matter how the husband is. .

1310
02:07:34,703 --> 02:07:38,907
. .but it's the duty of
the wife to respect him.

1311
02:07:40,703 --> 02:07:45,574
I'm not worthy of respect. I
shall give you your right, my wife.

1312
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:58,708
Where are my children? I've
been pining for years to see them.

1313
02:08:00,169 --> 02:08:03,640
One was lost when he was
a kid, and the other. .

1314
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:06,637
Who is it, Ma?

1315
02:08:08,169 --> 02:08:09,704
He's your son.

1316
02:08:10,636 --> 02:08:14,706
Whom are you talking to?
- Someone tried to take his life.

1317
02:08:15,836 --> 02:08:19,372
If I encounter the idiot,
I won't spare him!

1318
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:26,574
Kishan, know who is here?
- Who is it, Ma?

1319
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,004
Your father.

1320
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:34,439
Father?
- Yes son.

1321
02:08:35,503 --> 02:08:39,506
For years, he has been looking
for us. At last he found us.

1322
02:08:40,103 --> 02:08:43,706
Ma, ask him to go away.
- What're you saying?

1323
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:48,040
I mean it. He snatched away
the most desired right from us.

1324
02:08:49,036 --> 02:08:54,574
He made you live like a widow.
What has he come here for now?

1325
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:58,807
Where was he when you
worked in houses to feed me?

1326
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:01,772
Where was he when you were sick?

1327
02:09:01,803 --> 02:09:04,605
When I used to beg
to buy you medicines?

1328
02:09:05,436 --> 02:09:08,839
When in return all I got was a glass
of booze forced into my throat?

1329
02:09:08,903 --> 02:09:13,507
Stop it, Kishan.
- No Durga, let him say it.

1330
02:09:14,369 --> 02:09:18,640
Let him pour his heart out. I've
given you nothing but sorrows.

1331
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:26,309
Kishan, you are right. I'm not
worthy of being called your father.

1332
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:32,841
If I'm a blot to you, don't ever
tell anyone that I'm your father.

1333
02:09:33,503 --> 02:09:37,740
You can call me your servant.
- Don't say that, please.

1334
02:09:38,636 --> 02:09:43,574
Still if you aren't convinced,
then I shall go away.

1335
02:09:43,636 --> 02:09:47,306
No, no.
- Let me go, Durga.

1336
02:09:47,903 --> 02:09:51,306
When my own son doesn't want
me here, I can't stay back.

1337
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:52,637
Stop him, Kishan.

1338
02:09:56,036 --> 02:09:57,303
Wait, father.

1339
02:09:58,503 --> 02:10:01,439
Stay with us.

1340
02:10:10,703 --> 02:10:15,974
Son.. my son.

1341
02:10:17,903 --> 02:10:20,238
Come, take some rest now.

1342
02:10:26,236 --> 02:10:27,303
Blood?

1343
02:10:35,303 --> 02:10:37,838
Hello?
- Who is it?

1344
02:10:38,369 --> 02:10:40,972
Who? Vikram Singh? I'm Pascal here.

1345
02:10:42,336 --> 02:10:45,238
Pascal? What're you doing
there? Where are my men?

1346
02:10:45,836 --> 02:10:49,239
All your men have run,
scared of police.

1347
02:10:49,636 --> 02:10:51,971
Jaggi's son, Gopal. .

1348
02:10:52,036 --> 02:10:53,971
. .is going to testify against me
in court, tomorrow.

1349
02:10:55,836 --> 02:11:02,242
Don't you worry. Trust me, I won't
Iet the cockeyed one reach the court.

1350
02:11:03,103 --> 02:11:08,374
Good. Pascal, as soon as you
get him, call me on this number.

1351
02:11:09,236 --> 02:11:12,772
53-39-8 1.
- Sure sir.

1352
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:20,241
My sister used to live in Kanpur.

1353
02:11:20,569 --> 02:11:22,305
I went looking, but
I didn't find her.

1354
02:11:22,569 --> 02:11:23,904
Her neighbours say she's in Bombay.

1355
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:25,571
I can't find her. Someone asked me. .

1356
02:11:25,636 --> 02:11:28,305
. .to lodge a complaint.
- Sit.

1357
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:31,838
What's her name?
- Basanti.

1358
02:11:32,569 --> 02:11:33,637
Basanti.

1359
02:11:34,903 --> 02:11:35,970
Here's her photograph.

1360
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:44,571
Wonderful.

1361
02:11:44,636 --> 02:11:47,905
Wonderful.

1362
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:19,137
Annu!

1363
02:12:20,036 --> 02:12:25,908
Annu.. you.. what
are you doing here?

1364
02:12:27,703 --> 02:12:31,973
That's my question,
sister. What are you doing here?

1365
02:12:33,703 --> 02:12:36,972
I? I..
- Tell me!

1366
02:12:37,503 --> 02:12:39,771
What can she tell? I'll tell you.

1367
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:42,638
This world, the beats of
the musical instrument. .

1368
02:12:42,703 --> 02:12:44,638
. .the chimes of the dancing-bells. .

1369
02:12:44,703 --> 02:12:47,639
. .the clink of money.. all
these have shackled her feet.

1370
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:51,840
The outside world scares her. In
the decent world, she feels lost. .

1371
02:12:51,903 --> 02:12:53,704
No! That's untrue.

1372
02:12:55,136 --> 02:12:56,203
What's the truth?

1373
02:13:00,503 --> 02:13:03,639
Want to know? Come with me.

1374
02:13:05,036 --> 02:13:07,505
For a poverty-stricken
hapless girl, the brothel. .

1375
02:13:09,970 --> 02:13:12,906
. .is a place thousand times better
than the world of gentlemen, Mr. Amit

1376
02:13:15,036 --> 02:13:17,638
r
Here, even in the midst of vermin
honour remains intact.

1377
02:13:19,170 --> 02:13:20,437
And there. .

1378
02:13:21,436 --> 02:13:23,905
it's hard to save one's honour
despite living. .

1379
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:25,438
. .among respectable people.

1380
02:13:27,436 --> 02:13:31,439
That's what happened with me. When
there was drought in the village. .

1381
02:13:32,569 --> 02:13:34,638
. .I became first victim.

1382
02:13:35,636 --> 02:13:37,571
I had only one cow. It died.

1383
02:13:37,636 --> 02:13:41,573
Helpless I was,
I had to see the landlord.

1384
02:13:41,903 --> 02:13:42,970
Yes?

1385
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:48,440
I need money.
- You think I own a mint?

1386
02:13:48,903 --> 02:13:50,437
You haven't paid me what you owe.

1387
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:52,571
And now you come
again asking for a loan?

1388
02:13:52,903 --> 02:13:55,772
I'll repay every cent.
But please help me today.

1389
02:13:56,036 --> 02:13:57,637
I got to send money to
my sister in the city.

1390
02:13:58,769 --> 02:14:02,440
How will you repay? For your
sister's studies, you have pawned. .

1391
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:06,841
. .everything you owned with me.
- Have mercy on me.

1392
02:14:07,436 --> 02:14:12,908
Give her some money. Blessings of
the poor come handy in trying times.

1393
02:14:13,636 --> 02:14:17,172
I can't help. If you
can, you help her.

1394
02:14:18,903 --> 02:14:21,105
All right, I'll help. Come.

1395
02:14:22,036 --> 02:14:23,637
Where?
- Upstairs.

1396
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:25,571
Upstairs?
- Yes.

1397
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:28,972
Money matters must be
settled in papers. Come.

1398
02:14:31,103 --> 02:14:33,371
He conned me, and took me upstairs.

1399
02:14:34,703 --> 02:14:36,404
I don't want your money! Take it!

1400
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:41,040
Well! Help them, and
also take their tantrums!

1401
02:14:59,503 --> 02:15:00,570
Sir!

1402
02:15:00,769 --> 02:15:03,506
Murder! Murder! You murdered him!

1403
02:15:13,569 --> 02:15:16,105
Life had closed all doors on me.

1404
02:15:19,303 --> 02:15:21,772
I could see nothing but death.

1405
02:15:25,436 --> 02:15:27,704
What the hell? Why do
you want to kill yourself?

1406
02:15:27,769 --> 02:15:32,040
Let go! I want to die!
- Who are you? What's the matter?

1407
02:15:32,436 --> 02:15:33,503
Take it easy.

1408
02:15:37,569 --> 02:15:38,637
Come, dear.

1409
02:15:45,503 --> 02:15:46,570
This. .

1410
02:15:46,636 --> 02:15:50,439
The Lords of society
call this place a brothel.

1411
02:15:51,036 --> 02:15:54,773
This is only place where
respectable people visit. .

1412
02:15:54,836 --> 02:15:56,370
. .yet it's maligned.

1413
02:15:58,636 --> 02:16:02,706
You'd better let me die.

1414
02:16:03,436 --> 02:16:05,704
You're taking it wrong, my child.

1415
02:16:06,636 --> 02:16:11,374
We dance and sing to entertain, no
doubt but we don't sell our honour

1416
02:16:11,836 --> 02:16:14,838
All the girls here
are like my daughters.

1417
02:16:15,536 --> 02:16:17,905
It's my duty to protect your honour.

1418
02:16:19,436 --> 02:16:20,503
Come in, dear.

1419
02:16:22,503 --> 02:16:24,705
That's how I ended
up in this brothel.

1420
02:16:25,703 --> 02:16:28,305
You tell me, had I a choice?

1421
02:16:29,036 --> 02:16:33,774
You wanted to marry me, didn't you?
Am I worthy of getting married?

1422
02:16:35,303 --> 02:16:38,439
Why did you tell me all this
before? Didn't you trust me?

1423
02:16:38,769 --> 02:16:42,907
I had trust in you, but
I had not the courage.

1424
02:16:45,736 --> 02:16:46,903
Basanti, you. .

1425
02:16:50,336 --> 02:16:52,838
Basanti, you have no idea,
to the law, you are. .

1426
02:16:52,903 --> 02:16:53,970
I know.

1427
02:16:55,703 --> 02:16:57,371
Someday, I was to be arrested.

1428
02:17:00,436 --> 02:17:04,506
Good that you will arrest me.

1429
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:07,639
''When the dancing-bells break,
it's time to put on handcuffs.''

1430
02:17:07,903 --> 02:17:13,041
''When the dancing-bells break,
it's time to put on handcuffs.''

1431
02:17:13,303 --> 02:17:18,041
''I shall put on the handcuffs. .''

1432
02:17:18,436 --> 02:17:21,572
I I
. .but I shall
never give in to you. .

1433
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:26,372
''Come what may. ''

1434
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:47,439
Amit! He's the one whom I murdered!

1435
02:17:47,903 --> 02:17:50,772
No! He's alive.. he's alive, Annu.

1436
02:17:51,236 --> 02:17:52,270
Come here.

1437
02:18:03,436 --> 02:18:04,904
C'mon, the car's over there.

1438
02:18:29,769 --> 02:18:32,506
Hello?
- Sir, your job is done.

1439
02:18:33,169 --> 02:18:36,172
And Gopal is in our custody.
- Wrong number.

1440
02:18:38,836 --> 02:18:43,507
Who was it, son?
- Someone said the job is done.

1441
02:18:43,570 --> 02:18:46,306
And that he has Gopal. Wrong number.

1442
02:18:53,836 --> 02:18:55,837
Tell Mr. Vikram that Jaggi is here.

1443
02:18:55,903 --> 02:18:57,838
He's not well. He won't see anyone.

1444
02:18:57,903 --> 02:19:01,306
Tell him my name. He might recover.
- Let him in, son.

1445
02:19:01,603 --> 02:19:05,173
Hear that? Just my voice
got him out of the bed.

1446
02:19:06,836 --> 02:19:10,639
Well, what brings you here?
- I hear you're sick, so I came over.

1447
02:19:10,703 --> 02:19:13,172
Thank you very much. Careful, son.

1448
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:15,438
He?
- My son, Kishan.

1449
02:19:16,303 --> 02:19:18,171
Was he born blind?
- No, someone helped me. .

1450
02:19:23,103 --> 02:19:26,306
Father, I guess the two of
you have met after a long time.

1451
02:19:26,703 --> 02:19:30,506
You might have lots to discuss.
I'll go upstairs to my room.

1452
02:19:30,703 --> 02:19:31,737
Okay son.

1453
02:19:36,603 --> 02:19:37,704
Sit.

1454
02:19:42,603 --> 02:19:46,606
How did you know I'm here? -
Keeping track of partners is a must

1455
02:19:47,003 --> 02:19:49,672
Why have you come here?
- Mr. Vikram, you must remember. .

1456
02:19:50,136 --> 02:19:51,937
. .our weakness are
Iocked inside a safe.

1457
02:19:52,203 --> 02:19:55,339
The safe has two keys that we share.

1458
02:19:57,003 --> 02:20:01,741
I remember. So?
- I'd like to have your key.

1459
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:06,740
What for?
- For joy and sorrow.

1460
02:20:07,803 --> 02:20:11,840
As for the joy, unlike you I'm not
wanted, and my business is soaring.

1461
02:20:12,803 --> 02:20:16,873
As for sorrow, if you
refuse to give me the key. .

1462
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:22,074
. .then I'll inform the
police about your whereabouts.

1463
02:20:22,203 --> 02:20:26,941
Oh I see. Then talk to the point.
Why did you have to give a lecture?

1464
02:20:27,936 --> 02:20:34,075
Want to talk to the police?
I'll dial the number, you talk.

1465
02:20:41,769 --> 02:20:43,938
Hello?
- Vikram here.

1466
02:20:44,169 --> 02:20:47,139
Yes sir? Tell me.
- Mr. Jaggi would like to speak.

1467
02:20:47,203 --> 02:20:48,804
Sure sir, put him on.

1468
02:20:49,803 --> 02:20:54,073
Here, talk. Don't
stare at me, just talk.

1469
02:20:59,669 --> 02:21:01,271
Hello?
- Who? Mr. Jaggi?

1470
02:21:01,803 --> 02:21:05,806
Who's that?
- The forgotten slave. Pascal.

1471
02:21:05,936 --> 02:21:08,271
Here, talk to your son.

1472
02:21:10,603 --> 02:21:13,739
Hello daddy..
- Gopal? What are you doing there?

1473
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:18,174
They're holding me. Daddy,
please accept all their conditions.

1474
02:21:18,603 --> 02:21:21,539
Else, they'll kill me.
- Where are you?

1475
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:23,137
Hello?

1476
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:27,473
Spoke to the police?
What did they say?

1477
02:21:29,203 --> 02:21:31,004
The police are coming, aren't they?
- Vikram. .

1478
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:36,873
. .today you've won.
- I've won, haven't I?

1479
02:21:37,736 --> 02:21:40,805
Now heed me.

1480
02:21:41,936 --> 02:21:44,938
Give me your helicopter.

1481
02:21:45,669 --> 02:21:51,475
In return, I'll give you
your son and the key. Agreed?

1482
02:21:54,136 --> 02:21:55,203
Agreed.

1483
02:21:56,803 --> 02:22:01,741
Come to the hangar with my son in
two hours. You'll get the helicopter.

1484
02:22:15,203 --> 02:22:19,640
So I see, son. You were taping your
father's conversations on the sly?

1485
02:22:20,603 --> 02:22:25,674
Yes, Father. Police motto. Tape a
thief's conversation on the sly.

1486
02:22:28,403 --> 02:22:31,606
But son, what'll
you do with the tape?

1487
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:36,740
I'll give it to the police.
Let them know your true colours.

1488
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:41,541
No. Will you turn your father in?
- Let alone my father. .

1489
02:22:41,936 --> 02:22:43,737
. .when it comes to duty, I
won't spare my grandfather either.

1490
02:22:53,603 --> 02:22:57,506
r
Don't move, Father. Had I wished
I'd have riddled your chest.

1491
02:22:59,003 --> 02:23:05,075
But I fired only to stop you. Sound
is all I need to shoot on target.

1492
02:23:06,003 --> 02:23:07,070
Like to see?

1493
02:23:14,669 --> 02:23:16,538
No, don't remove your shoes, Father.

1494
02:23:17,403 --> 02:23:20,472
When you're silent, your shoes talk.

1495
02:23:21,070 --> 02:23:24,606
Keep jogging on the
spot. And remember. .

1496
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:28,339
. .if your shoes stop talking,
my gun will talk.

1497
02:23:35,669 --> 02:23:38,672
That's nice, Father. Good.

1498
02:23:46,603 --> 02:23:47,670
What's going on?

1499
02:23:49,936 --> 02:23:53,305
Now shoot! I have
your mother, Kishan.

1500
02:23:53,936 --> 02:23:57,339
She's my shield. Let me
see how you shoot me now.

1501
02:24:01,836 --> 02:24:02,937
Someone's coming.

1502
02:24:05,036 --> 02:24:06,937
Now be a good boy and
listen to your father.

1503
02:24:08,536 --> 02:24:12,072
Go downstairs and send him
away as fast as you can.

1504
02:24:13,603 --> 02:24:18,007
And if you try to let the word
out.. you know the end result.

1505
02:24:20,253 --> 02:24:24,457
Kishan. .

1506
02:24:24,919 --> 02:24:29,190
Basanti has been exonerated.
- Really?

1507
02:24:29,253 --> 02:24:34,458
Yes. And very soon I'll also find
the one for whom I joined the police.

1508
02:24:35,319 --> 02:24:38,322
Here's his photograph.
I wish you could see.

1509
02:24:40,386 --> 02:24:43,589
That's fine, but
Amit you better go away.

1510
02:24:44,919 --> 02:24:47,922
How strange! I gave you a good news,
you don't even congratulate me. .

1511
02:24:47,986 --> 02:24:50,188
. .and you ask me to go away?
- I'm happy, I'm elated.

1512
02:24:50,253 --> 02:24:52,989
But you go away. - Going.
Let me have a glass of water.

1513
02:24:53,053 --> 02:24:56,456
I'm thirsty. - No water.
Ma has locked the kitchen.

1514
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:06,555
If you don't wish to give me water,
then don't. But don't lie.

1515
02:25:07,253 --> 02:25:08,320
The kitchen is open.

1516
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:13,389
Stop arguing, Amit.
I told you, go away!

1517
02:25:14,453 --> 02:25:18,323
See that? You fell down! I'm
not leaving before mother comes.

1518
02:25:18,919 --> 02:25:19,987
Ma is in danger upstairs.

1519
02:25:20,386 --> 02:25:23,522
I don't need you here.
Go, I say. Go on.

1520
02:25:23,853 --> 02:25:27,056
Going. Why are you pushing me?
I won't come even if you call me.

1521
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,187
Fine.
- Strange man !

1522
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:30,855
Calls me home and
then throws me out.

1523
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,488
Ma.. Ma..

1524
02:25:41,053 --> 02:25:44,156
Well done! You're an obedient son.

1525
02:25:46,153 --> 02:25:48,588
And what do you think of me?
- You never left?

1526
02:25:48,853 --> 02:25:49,920
Then the sound of the jeep?

1527
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:52,988
Left a rock on the accelerator.

1528
02:25:59,586 --> 02:26:03,189
Amit. .Amit. .

1529
02:26:03,853 --> 02:26:05,187
Amit.

1530
02:26:07,386 --> 02:26:08,453
Let go!

1531
02:26:08,986 --> 02:26:10,053
Kishan.

1532
02:26:12,253 --> 02:26:13,854
Mother!
- Kishan !

1533
02:26:13,886 --> 02:26:15,254
Kishan !
- Mother!

1534
02:26:18,919 --> 02:26:20,254
Let go! Annu. .

1535
02:26:20,386 --> 02:26:22,121
What's going on?
- Come on.

1536
02:26:23,186 --> 02:26:25,922
Get inside the car, girls. Get in.

1537
02:26:27,186 --> 02:26:30,322
Get lost.
- Kishan.

1538
02:26:30,853 --> 02:26:34,456
Don't worry about me. Amit is lying
injured inside. Look him up, hurry.

1539
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:37,122
Get lost!
- Kishan. - Sit.

1540
02:26:38,586 --> 02:26:41,855
Amit!
- Kishan.

1541
02:26:42,453 --> 02:26:44,254
Kishan, he's
taking your mother away.

1542
02:27:01,919 --> 02:27:05,256
Welcome, Mr. Vikram.
I was expecting you.

1543
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,187
Your key.

1544
02:27:10,186 --> 02:27:12,121
Where's my helicopter?
- Where's my son?

1545
02:27:12,853 --> 02:27:16,456
What's the hurry? He should
be coming. - After he comes. .

1546
02:27:16,853 --> 02:27:19,822
. .you will get the helicopter.
What's the hurry?

1547
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:38,122
Inspector, make a
move and the kid.. - No!

1548
02:27:38,186 --> 02:27:40,855
No? Then drop the gun.

1549
02:27:43,986 --> 02:27:47,522
You are the one
who took my son away!

1550
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,323
Where is my son, tell me?
- Which son?

1551
02:27:52,786 --> 02:27:54,420
You snatched him away
from me, years back.

1552
02:27:55,486 --> 02:27:58,388
He's the one who
ran off with our son.

1553
02:27:58,853 --> 02:28:00,521
Ask him, where our son is?

1554
02:28:01,319 --> 02:28:03,522
Where's my son, tell me?
- Get lost.

1555
02:28:04,453 --> 02:28:06,788
You want your son, and I'm
worried for my son. I don't who. .

1556
02:28:06,853 --> 02:28:09,922
. .and where your son is.
- But I know, Jaggi.

1557
02:28:15,986 --> 02:28:19,723
You must've forgotten
your past. But I haven't.

1558
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:23,990
For 300 bucks, you
sold her son to me.

1559
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:29,725
You like to sell kids, no? So come,
strike a deal for your son.

1560
02:28:29,919 --> 02:28:32,989
But where's my son?
- Stay there! Don't you move.

1561
02:28:34,853 --> 02:28:37,055
Here, see your son.

1562
02:28:40,053 --> 02:28:44,123
What have you done to my son?
- He was screaming too much.

1563
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:45,721
So I got him to
sniff some chloroform..

1564
02:28:45,786 --> 02:28:48,188
. .he's going to sleep for some time.

1565
02:28:48,453 --> 02:28:49,787
You lousy man!

1566
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:53,923
Hurry up, Pascal. Give him
his son.. - Stop, Mr. Vikram.

1567
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:56,321
I got to settle a score with him.

1568
02:28:56,853 --> 02:29:00,323
Where's my son? Tell
me, I'll be obliged.

1569
02:29:00,353 --> 02:29:03,422
Want your son? Then you
will have to pay a price.

1570
02:29:10,986 --> 02:29:13,722
Now tell me where my son is.
- Only four bangles?

1571
02:29:14,853 --> 02:29:18,122
Hurry up, Pascal. The police..
- Hang on, Mr. Vikram.

1572
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:23,124
Why've you worn the wedding necklace?
Is it worth more than your son?

1573
02:29:23,186 --> 02:29:27,056
Not this, no. The wedding
necklace is my husband's memento.

1574
02:29:28,186 --> 02:29:31,722
I can't let it go, no matter what.
- I'm your husband.

1575
02:29:32,286 --> 02:29:34,788
Mere gold rolled on to this damn
thread carries no weight. - No.

1576
02:29:42,653 --> 02:29:45,789
In this thread is trapped
your breaths, Mr. Vikram.

1577
02:29:47,653 --> 02:29:50,655
It's a mark of a married woman.
Destroy it, and you'll be destroyed.

1578
02:29:52,053 --> 02:29:53,120
Take it, mother.

1579
02:29:58,653 --> 02:30:02,123
Amit, this man knows who my other
son is and where he is.

1580
02:30:02,386 --> 02:30:04,788
I know, everything.

1581
02:30:05,186 --> 02:30:09,657
What do you know? Speak
up! Who is my brother?

1582
02:30:10,653 --> 02:30:13,655
Tell me, or I'll kill you.
- I'll tell you, everything.

1583
02:30:14,186 --> 02:30:16,855
Amit. Amit is your brother.

1584
02:30:21,586 --> 02:30:22,720
Amit.. my brother?

1585
02:30:23,586 --> 02:30:24,653
Brother?

1586
02:30:24,786 --> 02:30:27,188
Amit.. my son!

1587
02:30:37,853 --> 02:30:41,189
Wait. Where are you going?
- To answer the phone.

1588
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:42,287
Not to detonate a bomb.

1589
02:30:49,586 --> 02:30:53,056
Our men are fixing a bomb in the
helicopter. As per your orders. .

1590
02:30:53,786 --> 02:30:57,189
. .it will be set to explode
ten minutes after ignition.

1591
02:31:00,653 --> 02:31:06,191
Mr. Vikram, my helicopter is ready,
at the old airport. You may go.

1592
02:31:10,053 --> 02:31:13,790
If anyone tries to move, I'll shoot.

1593
02:31:16,786 --> 02:31:17,820
Hold it!

1594
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:30,522
Don't try to venture out, father.

1595
02:31:31,653 --> 02:31:32,720
Let me go, son.

1596
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:37,122
Will you shoot me if I don't stop?

1597
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:44,124
No, you can't shoot me. Because
my blood runs down your veins.

1598
02:31:46,919 --> 02:31:51,124
You've already shed that blood.
You've also extracted its price. .

1599
02:31:52,086 --> 02:31:53,187
. .along with interest.

1600
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:58,591
We're her sons. You never
considered her your wife.

1601
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,989
She's your wife, yet you
tried to trade the relationship.

1602
02:32:30,586 --> 02:32:34,056
Mr. Vikram! Take me along.

1603
02:33:14,053 --> 02:33:15,120
What're these?
- Sandals.

1604
02:33:15,786 --> 02:33:17,521
Brand?
- Kolhapuri.

1605
02:33:18,053 --> 02:33:19,053
Size?

1606
02:33:20,586 --> 02:33:23,922
Six.
- Not six, eunuch. Nine.

1607
02:33:24,586 --> 02:33:26,921
Nine, cockeye!

1608
02:33:31,886 --> 02:33:34,655
Amit!

1609
02:33:35,786 --> 02:33:37,988
Daddy, hurry up, come on.

1610
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,387
My brother.

1611
02:33:47,653 --> 02:33:51,590
Embrace well, for the last time.
You won't get another chance.

1612
02:33:52,653 --> 02:33:56,056
Because you will die here. And
your parents, in the helicopter.

1613
02:33:57,386 --> 02:33:58,987
I've fixed a time-bomb in it.

1614
02:34:08,586 --> 02:34:10,921
Amit, save Ma.

1615
02:34:13,586 --> 02:34:14,653
Come with me.

1616
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:51,522
What's wrong?
- A truck is trapped in the middle.

1617
02:35:17,653 --> 02:35:18,653
Father!

1618
02:35:21,386 --> 02:35:22,453
Stop Father!

1619
02:35:46,253 --> 02:35:49,856
My arm is injured. I
can't drive. What to do?

1620
02:36:17,653 --> 02:36:18,720
Go straight.

1621
02:36:20,386 --> 02:36:21,587
Dead straight.

1622
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:26,856
Right! Oh no, no entry.

1623
02:36:29,453 --> 02:36:30,520
To the right.

1624
02:36:30,919 --> 02:36:31,987
Right.

1625
02:36:34,253 --> 02:36:35,320
Right, very good.

1626
02:36:36,386 --> 02:36:37,854
Straight.

1627
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:40,587
Left.

1628
02:36:43,986 --> 02:36:45,253
Right.

1629
02:36:50,253 --> 02:36:51,754
Stop, stop.

1630
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:56,322
Ma's car has met with an accident.
- What?

1631
02:36:56,453 --> 02:36:57,520
I'll be back.

1632
02:36:58,653 --> 02:36:59,787
Ma. .

1633
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:05,391
Are you all right, Ma?
- Where's your father?

1634
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:08,256
Must've gone for the helicopter.

1635
02:37:09,253 --> 02:37:11,521
But Jaggi has
planted a time-bomb in it.

1636
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:13,588
What? Time-bomb?
- Yes.

1637
02:37:13,786 --> 02:37:17,322
Son, save your father, somehow.
- But Ma, you. .

1638
02:37:17,586 --> 02:37:22,590
Don't worry about me,
son. Save my husband.

1639
02:37:23,186 --> 02:37:24,887
Save my husband.
- Yes, Ma.

1640
02:37:27,319 --> 02:37:28,521
Let's go, Kishan.

1641
02:37:28,853 --> 02:37:30,187
Left. Left.

1642
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:33,587
Kishan.

1643
02:38:03,653 --> 02:38:06,188
Faster Kishan. Speed up.

1644
02:38:10,419 --> 02:38:11,687
Faster!

1645
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:34,088
Why did you risk it here? Jump off.

1646
02:38:34,153 --> 02:38:36,622
No Amit. Whatever we do,
we'll do it together.

1647
02:38:57,886 --> 02:39:02,724
Father!
- No use. The rotors are too loud.

1648
02:39:56,686 --> 02:39:57,753
Amit.

1649
02:40:38,686 --> 02:40:44,091
Amit, I can't hold on.
- Don't let go. We're too high up.

1650
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:30,623
Father, there's a time-bomb
planted inside. Land the copter.

1651
02:41:30,819 --> 02:41:34,423
Son of a gun! You think I'm a
fool to fall for your words?

1652
02:41:34,553 --> 02:41:35,754
Believe me, it's wired.

1653
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:37,888
I am telling the truth that
there is a time bomb in it.

1654

There it is.

1655
02:41:52,553 --> 02:41:56,821
Brother, jump off when I tell you.
- Right.

1656
02:41:59,419 --> 02:42:00,487
Jump.

1657
02:42:24,953 --> 02:42:26,020
Open your eyes, slowly.

Yes, Kishan. - How could
he when he's still alive?

- No need to thank, son.

1668
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:17,822
