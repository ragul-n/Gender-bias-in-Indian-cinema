1
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:02,625
I just killed my wife.

2
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,125
See that building...

3
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,708
...she was there.

4
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,833
With one of my friend.

5
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,333
Finished them both!

6
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,550
Bang! Bang! Bang!

7
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:25,883
Two years...

8
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,550
...she kept f***ing my life!

9
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,591
I gave her everything.

10
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,758
My time, my love!

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,050
All I had.

12
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:44,716
Bloody women!

13
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,675
You can never know them.

14
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,925
They'll never tell you.

15
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,091
The moment, I got to know...

16
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,175
...I took the step.

17
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,800
I did, what should've been done.

18
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,133
I was with her till she was alive.

19
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,675
I saw her dying.

20
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,216
In front of my eyes,

21
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,091
she died!

22
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,466
Then, coming out
I saw the tire punctured!

23
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,508
That's why, hired your car.
Let's go.

24
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,466
-Where to?
-Huh?

25
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,758
First, leave this place.
I'm telling you.

26
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,341
How much is it?

27
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:08,383
350 Rs.

28
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,425
Okay.

29
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:23,841
Give the change to some poor.

30
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:41,133
I've committed two murders.

31
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,508
There's even a gun in my hand.

32
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:50,716
Didn't it scare you?

33
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,591
-No.
-Why so?

34
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,091
I am scared of nothing.

35
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,925
You must have lost something.

36
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,300
Hmm!

37
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:13,716
Something very precious!

38
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm sure.

39
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,508
Fine then, brother.

40
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,716
I better go.

41
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,300
Before going to jail...

42
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,050
...I want to pay a visit
to my empty house.

43
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,466
It was my world even yesterday.

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,758
Okay, brother.
Take care then.

45
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:45,716
Goodbye.

46
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,550
All my zeals have turned to ashes.

47
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:26,800
Life is like unending mountains.

48
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:34,883
My happy days are gone.

49
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,966
Gone with the wind.

50
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:46,800
Life is nothing but a delusional maze.

51
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:53,133
Who knows, when this suffering will end!

52
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,008
Will she ever answer my call?

53
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:06,341
Will she ever come back to me?

54
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:48,550
Who's there?

55
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:49,716
Hey, you...

56
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,550
What are you...

57
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:06,758
(Humming)

58
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,425
What happened?

59
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:17,800
What kind of sound?

60
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,758
Give it a count, bro.

61
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,508
You know, I never count.

62
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,050
Too much faith is not good.

63
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,425
Murad bhai, trusts me.

64
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,383
Where is he these days?

65
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,091
In London.

66
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,425
He'll be back.

67
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,133
He's having fun there.

68
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,466
Just like, you'll now.

69
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,341
Nice one, huh?
Buy it.

70
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:00,883
Just checking it out.

71
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:02,675
Just like that?

72
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,591
Why are you so
casual about yourself?

73
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:06,800
You don't buy anything for yourself.

74
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:08,716
Buy it, come on.

75
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,008
Let it be.

76
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:14,591
Let it be, huh?

77
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,508
What's wrong with you?

78
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,800
Why aren't you buying anything?

79
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,591
You earn a lot of money.

80
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,091
But you hardly
spend them on yourself.

81
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,800
Buy a car or a house!

82
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,966
Repair the old ones.

83
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,508
Do something, atleast!

84
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,216
How can I have fun with
this blood money?

85
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,425
Even for my own self!

86
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,383
Well, who else do you
have to spend for?

87
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,008
Exactly!

88
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,425
The house seems so empty.

89
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:45,633
Anything else, madam?

90
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,091
No.

91
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:47,883
All is there but seems nothing is.

92
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,758
I spent all day alone.

93
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,508
It feels so lonely..

94
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,800
Don't you think every individual
needs someone in life?

95
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,591
A companion...

96
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,675
...who'll be with me.

97
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,466
Who'll always be around me.

98
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,800
Who'll spend time with me.

99
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,550
The one, who'll worry for me.

100
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:07,716
Who'll take care of me.

101
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,216
For whom, I'll be spending my earnings.

102
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,550
Someone, who'll...

103
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,300
...belong to me, only.

104
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:15,675
Get married then!

105
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,966
Remember Maya, the hotel dancer?

106
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:20,716
She really loves you.

107
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:21,466
She told me.

108
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:22,425
Crazy or what?

109
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,925
Not a girl like her...

110
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,300
...someone decent.

111
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:29,008
Are you a decent man?

112
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,300
That's why, I'm saying.

113
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:32,758
I don't want her to be like me.

114
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:36,508
Do onething then.

115
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,341
Find a simple, nice girl.

116
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,050
And get married to her.

117
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:42,800
Anyways, you're a part-time cab driver.

118
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:44,508
Tell her that's your profession.

119
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,425
The cops couldn't suspect you till now.

120
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:48,466
Don't think, she'll be able to.

121
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,966
Well, there's a girl of 23-24 years old.

122
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,925
She's an orphan.

123
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,383
Her aunt raised her.

124
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:06,008
They're also looking for a suitable boy.

125
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:08,841
How should I put this?

126
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,925
The one who works honestly
has no money.

127
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,133
And the one who has money,

128
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,550
is dishonest.

129
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,133
Now if you agree,
I'll let them know.

130
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,466
Well, I'm ready.
I don't have any problem.

131
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,591
Actually, I don't have anyone also.

132
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,050
I grew up in an orphanage.

133
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,258
I have no issues.

134
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,133
You let me know, whenever you can.

135
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,133
I'll wait.

136
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:51,258
Hey!

137
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,716
What's so funny?

138
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,383
No, I was thinking...

139
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,716
...which is more easy to get!

140
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:58,758
A girl or a target!

141
00:12:59,383 --> 00:12:59,758
Why so?

142
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,175
Because, it's hard to know
in case of women that...

143
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:03,341
...who is the target!

144
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:05,550
What rubbish!

145
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,883
Listen,

146
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,258
why aren't they here yet?

147
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,675
-Did they get to know about me?
-Yeah, right!

148
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,383
Who are you? A celebrity?

149
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,675
Hey! There they're.

150
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,425
It's them, I think.

151
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:42,966
Let me introduce you.

152
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:44,883
He's Amir.

153
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,050
He's a cab driver in Kolkata.

154
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:48,633
And, she is...

155
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:50,800
...sorry, what was your name?

156
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:51,758
Pari.

157
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,591
Pari Banu.

158
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:55,216
I knew it.

159
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:58,883
No, I mean...

160
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,300
...well, nothing.

161
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,341
We agree with this marriage.

162
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,675
You earn in an honest manner.

163
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,258
You've a house in Kolkata.

164
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,466
What else one needs!

165
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:08,508
But,

166
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,925
we're very poor.

167
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,341
We won't be able to give you much.

168
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,883
No, I don't want anything.

169
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,758
You all gave your consent...

170
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,175
...that's enough for me.

171
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,258
So, umm...

172
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:23,008
...if you don't mind then...

173
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,258
...can we talk separately?

174
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,050
I mean, here only.
Somewhere near here.

175
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:29,675
Ofcourse, but don't go too far!

176
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,341
Sure.

177
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,300
Umm...

178
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,050
...so, I was saying...

179
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,841
...everyone else has agreed but,

180
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,258
I must know your decision too.

181
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,050
You're okay with it, right?

182
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,341
I mean, hope you don't have a problem.

183
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:47,383
Umm, no.

184
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,300
So then, you like me?

185
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,758
Why aren't you saying anything?

186
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:58,716
No, I mean...

187
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:01,758
...do you like me?

188
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,466
Yes, very much. I mean...

189
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,341
'Very much' ?

190
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,216
We met...

191
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:11,675
...today only.

192
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,675
I'll tell you someday.

193
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,258
After marriage.

194
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,591
My world turns upside down...

195
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,591
...with every glimpse of your eyes.

196
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:46,050
My nights and days have surpassed time.

197
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:54,175
When darkness crawls slowly
to my window...

198
00:17:54,591 --> 00:18:02,341
...my heart and mind only craves for you.

199
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm your guiding star.

200
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:10,758
You are my conquest.

201
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:15,300
Though, I have you for eternity...

202
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,591
...it never feels enough.

203
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:23,300
I'm your guiding star.

204
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,258
You are my conquest.

205
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:31,800
Though, I have you for eternity...

206
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:35,133
...it never feels enough.

207
00:18:54,466 --> 00:19:02,091
The way moonlight overflows the valleys...

208
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:10,508
...my love for you is like that.

209
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:14,925
You have no idea...

210
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:18,841
...how long I have waited for you.

211
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:23,341
I'm your guiding star.

212
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,300
You are my conquest.

213
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:31,841
Though, I have you for eternity...

214
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,133
...it never feels enough.

215
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,925
I'm your guiding star.

216
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,883
You are my conquest.

217
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:48,425
Though, I have you for eternity...

218
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,716
...it never feels enough.

219
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,300
Pari!

220
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,966
Did you serve my lunch?

221
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,133
-Yeah, I'll after this...
-But, I'm getting late!

222
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,383
-Yeah, but...
-No, I don't want to hear anything.

223
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:26,466
Serve me the lunch now.

224
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:27,800
Okay...then.

225
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:29,841
Wait, listen...

226
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:31,758
I was saying that...

227
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:35,300
You don't need to do
these household works.

228
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:36,216
Get it?

229
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,383
We'll keep a maid.

230
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,175
No need to.
Anyways, it's a small house.

231
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:43,258
And I stay in the house
all day, anyway.

232
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,550
If you want, I can enroll you in
any designing course.

233
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,341
I don't like seeing you
do such petty works.

234
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,091
Fine then.

235
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm lucky to have you as my wife.

236
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,925
Whatever I say, or wish...

237
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,258
...you always take care of that.

238
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,216
But don't you have...

239
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:06,966
...anything that's your?

240
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:08,383
Yes, I do.

241
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:10,550
It's you.

242
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:14,258
Good Lord!

243
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,383
I forgot to buy the breads.

244
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:18,591
Oh, God!

245
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,008
Yeah, say!

246
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,091
What is there to say?

247
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,633
Murad bhai wants to meet you now.

248
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:43,508
Right, now?

249
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:44,716
You know he's like that.

250
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,008
-Hey! Take your tiffin.
-I'll call you later.

251
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,591
Are you going to be
empty stomach all day?

252
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:49,091
Here, it's...

253
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,466
Whom were you talking to?

254
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,883
It was Irfan.
I finished talking, anyway.

255
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,675
Then, why did you hang up the call?

256
00:21:56,841 --> 00:21:58,383
Because we were done with talking.

257
00:21:58,966 --> 00:21:59,383
Oh!

258
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:03,175
You could've talked to
him in front of me also.

259
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,508
Yeah, I'll talk later.

260
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,300
Was that any other woman?

261
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:09,966
No way! I can't even
manage the one I've.

262
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,716
Then, why did you disconnect it?

263
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,591
Okay, I'll talk to him later.

264
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:15,758
Now, can I've my tiffin?

265
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,550
May I go now?

266
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:19,300
Hmm!

267
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,300
Yeah, Irfan tell me.

268
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:27,216
Actually, Pari came suddenly.

269
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:28,966
What's the place?

270
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:31,258
Whose house?

271
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:57,966
Hey!

272
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,633
What have you all done?

273
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,966
After all, she's a woman.

274
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:12,258
But, really dangerous!

275
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:23,383
I told you,
not to go against me!

276
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:28,800
I'll be what I am.

277
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:31,175
You be they way you're.

278
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:32,591
Cook food.

279
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:37,008
Make a family and take care of it.

280
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,633
Why do you care so much...

281
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:43,466
...about stopping the crime?

282
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:49,008
To increase the T.R.P media
is conducting sting operation on us.

283
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,966
And you also attacked on me
for your own purpose.

284
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,050
No, not done!

285
00:23:56,716 --> 00:24:00,008
Contract-killing is nothing new!

286
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,716
Right? Then!

287
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:06,550
Human trafficking, drugs, guns...

288
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,008
...doesn't only happen in underworld.

289
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:10,883
Not at all!

290
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,966
All is legal in the upper world.

291
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,466
You should've done some homework.

292
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:17,133
You bastard!

293
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,550
You bloody criminal!

294
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:23,675
Torturing a weak woman...

295
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,841
Murad does torture...

296
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,050
...on weak people.

297
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,300
Whoever that weak person be!

298
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:45,425
What's the matter, Amir?

299
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:47,050
Haven't you...

300
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,716
...seen any female dead body earlier?

301
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:56,091
-No, I mean...
-Come, let's talk outside!

302
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:01,716
Come on!

303
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,550
This migraine...

304
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,550
And people think
murder is a child's play!

305
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:21,258
Let it be!

306
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,633
Listen!

307
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:25,841
There's new case!

308
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,925
It's rich businessman.

309
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:30,300
He owns 70 crores worth property.

310
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,633
He wants to donate...

311
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:33,675
...it all for charity.

312
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:35,258
His brothers came to me.

313
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,008
The can't stop him!

314
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,091
So, we've to do it.

315
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,966
Finish this within tomorrow night.

316
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:43,591
-Hey!
-Yes, bhai!

317
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:47,341
Here!

318
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:49,716
It'll be done, Murad bhai.

319
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:50,466
Good!

320
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,425
I heard you got married.

321
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:55,883
Yes.

322
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:58,466
Invite us for dinner then!

323
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:03,133
But she has no idea about my real work.

324
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,508
Make mutton!

325
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:08,591
Okay.

326
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,050
When?

327
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,008
After this work gets done.

328
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,383
Amir!

329
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,258
Come here!

330
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:20,175
My mother used to say onething...

331
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,216
Nobody possesses humanity
in this business.

332
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,258
No one is your father, mother,
brother or even friend!

333
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:33,008
That's why, Murad meets everyone.

334
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,341
May it be someone new in business...

335
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:36,716
...or a new wife!

336
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:38,758
Goodbye!

337
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,008
Salam!

338
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,633
Wa alaykumu s-salam!

339
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,383
How come you're so late today?

340
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:20,300
Couldn't help it!

341
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:24,216
All the passengers today
were of far away route.

342
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:25,383
Oh!

343
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:30,508
That's why, you look so tired!

344
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,800
You go take a bath.

345
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,175
I'll serve the food.

346
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:34,341
-Pari!
-Yes?

347
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,383
Sit with me for a while.

348
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:43,383
Tell me.

349
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:52,425
Don't ever leave me Pari.

350
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:55,466
-Why say all this now?
-Please let me say.

351
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,841
I only have you after my God.

352
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,758
I have no one except you in this world.

353
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,758
Please promise me!

354
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:10,300
That you'll never leave me.

355
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,550
I promise you.

356
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,841
I'll never leave you.

357
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:17,883
Never ever.

358
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,425
No, say it from your heart.

359
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:25,008
Without you...

360
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:26,050
...I'll never...

361
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:28,175
...go anywhere.

362
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:33,675
Even if you,
throw me out of the house...

363
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:35,966
...still I won't go.

364
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,008
Never ever!

365
00:29:57,216 --> 00:29:59,508
(Phone Rings)

366
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:04,925
Who is it?

367
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,758
Didn't you save my number?

368
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:09,758
No, Murad bhai!

369
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:11,008
Actually...

370
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:11,883
Amir!

371
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,008
Look,

372
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,050
It's been two years.

373
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:17,758
Atleast now, forget her.

374
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,675
Please!

375
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:20,675
I can't.

376
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,800
No matter how much I try to.

377
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,425
I again start thinking about her.

378
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:27,466
Look!

379
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
We're also looking for her!

380
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:30,633
My men...

381
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,675
...looked everywhere!
But, couldn't find her.

382
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:34,758
Where can she go?

383
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,175
How far?

384
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,050
Which city?

385
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,050
How can I not find her?

386
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,175
I looked everywhere fro her.

387
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,341
Amir!

388
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,800
It's time to move on!

389
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:46,966
Go ahead!

390
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,008
Do your work.

391
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,258
Restart your life.

392
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:50,300
I can't.

393
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,091
I just want her.

394
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:54,883
No one else.

395
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:57,300
Okay.

396
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:58,841
You look for her.

397
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:00,258
We'll look for her.

398
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:02,341
Forgot all our works
and let's do this. Right?

399
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:03,800
Okay.

400
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll hang up.

401
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:06,300
Goodbye.

402
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,341
What are you looking at?

403
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:23,008
At you!

404
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,716
Well, look.

405
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:28,925
...but, if I...

406
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,841
...get lost...

407
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,758
...or I fall sick,

408
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,341
or I die.

409
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:37,175
Don't blame me then.

410
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,675
Why did you stop?

411
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:41,800
Keep saying such bad things!

412
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:43,216
I haven't had enough yet.

413
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,591
I was just waiting for this smile.

414
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:56,133
You really like my smile right?

415
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:56,925
More than anything.

416
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:00,008
Keep smiling like this forever.

417
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:02,841
Tell me onething,

418
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:06,133
how can I keep you
happy like this forever?

419
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,591
What do you want? Tell me.

420
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,300
I'll make all your dreams.

421
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:13,091
Hmm!

422
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:14,550
Looks like, you've all the money
in the world huh?

423
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:16,508
Who knows!

424
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:17,508
Maybe, I do.

425
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:19,300
Really?

426
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,633
You didn't tell me!

427
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,716
Answer my question, first!

428
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,175
Tell me, about your dreams.

429
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:31,591
I don't have dreams.

430
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:33,966
I only have one.

431
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:36,966
I want you to be simple...

432
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,633
...like this forever.

433
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:45,175
So that our life
goes on like this forever.

434
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,425
That's all.

435
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:47,966
Oh, God!

436
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,008
You're so happy with little things.

437
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:54,550
You should've been born 200 years back.

438
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,258
What the hell!

439
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:58,925
Good Lord!

440
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:02,300
So many works are pending,
I forgot while talking to you.

441
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,008
I've so many works
at my hand. Let's go.

442
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:05,216
I've to make the dinner.

443
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,341
Come on, let's go.

444
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:08,383
I've some work to do.

445
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,425
What work?

446
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:11,383
Hey! Where are you...

447
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,008
Atleast, tell me what's going on?

448
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:18,050
Just a minute!

449
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:20,383
You all please
excuse me for a while.

450
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:40,091
Mr. Mehta!

451
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:41,425
Yes?

452
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,633
Please don't kill me!

453
00:34:59,133 --> 00:34:59,925
-Pari!
-Hmm?

454
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:00,841
Is everything done?

455
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,508
Yes, almost.

456
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:02,800
Well, listen to me.

457
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,508
Come out only when I'll call you.

458
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:06,216
Okay.

459
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:12,175
And, also my friends are
not very educated.

460
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:16,258
If Murad bhai says something odd,
don't mind please.

461
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:17,966
-I won't.
-Actually...

462
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:19,758
...he's a bit weird.

463
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:22,216
More than you?

464
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:24,800
I'll be outside.

465
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:32,758
Where is she?

466
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,300
Pari!

467
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,050
Come here.

468
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:43,633
As-salamu alaykum!

469
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,008
-That's Murad bhai.
-Wa alaykumu s-salam!

470
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:52,591
Out all of you!

471
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:02,216
Come here.

472
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:03,675
Please sit.

473
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:05,758
Come on, sit!

474
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,341
Where is your parental home?

475
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,175
In this city.

476
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,341
Where is your family then?

477
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:23,675
I've no one.

478
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:25,425
I only have...

479
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:26,966
...an aunt.

480
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,466
Why don't you make
eye contact while talking?

481
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:31,925
No, I mean...

482
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,550
Pari,

483
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,883
Murad bhai is just
like my elder brother.

484
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,175
I drive his cab.

485
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:42,758
He did a lot for me.
I told you that earlier.

486
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:43,591
Yes.

487
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:45,841
We are...

488
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,216
...very much greateful of you.

489
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,175
Amir, you're a lucky man.

490
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:57,133
Nowadays, very few girls feel shy.

491
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,216
It's really hard to find
girls like her these days.

492
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:01,925
My work is done.

493
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:03,300
Time to leave.

494
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:07,758
I came to meet you, that's all.

495
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:09,133
This is for you.

496
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,508
Pari, thank him!

497
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:20,966
Thank you.

498
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:22,425
It's alright.

499
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,341
Come on.

500
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,175
It's a pleasure meeting you, Pari.

501
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:30,425
See you!

502
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:33,300
But, I made dinner for you all...

503
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:38,258
Actually, how can you
leave without eating?

504
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,800
I came to see you...

505
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,425
...my work is done.

506
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:45,258
Amir!

507
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,550
Now, you'll eat all this food.

508
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,050
You'll die because of
her one day, Amir.

509
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:01,258
You'll be finished.

510
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:05,175
I've seen your demise in her eyes.

511
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:08,841
I say it from my experience.

512
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,800
A huge fire...

513
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,716
...begins from a little spark.

514
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:16,841
Don't let this happen.

515
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:19,883
If you let it...

516
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,925
...no one will be able to save you.

517
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:26,008
Congratulations on your married life.

518
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:32,758
What is there to think so much?

519
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:34,550
The case is clear.

520
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:36,925
Three murders!

521
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,258
With one single pistol.

522
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:41,716
The pattern is same as well.

523
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:43,175
Shot in the head!

524
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:46,091
-It's the same guy!
-So?

525
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,675
What should we do now?

526
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,175
Investigate! What else?

527
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:51,925
That's our work.

528
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:54,341
-Call the ambulance!
-Yes, sir.

529
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,633
Tell Amir, to go underground for a while.

530
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,591
Listen, to me carefully.

531
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:21,758
The news is true.

532
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,091
You better leave today.

533
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,883
Go underground.

534
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,300
This is Murad bhai's order.

535
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:30,883
You're listening, right?

536
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:36,758
Pari!

537
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:38,966
Did you call me?

538
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:40,508
Yeah, I was thinking...

539
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,925
...why not we go for a trip?

540
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:44,925
A trip?

541
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,008
Umm...where?

542
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:50,758
Anywhere you say.
Somewhere far away.

543
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:51,925
Far away!

544
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:53,883
We can go surely.

545
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,841
But...

546
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,841
...it'll be good if go after somedays.

547
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,425
Umm...why?

548
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:00,633
No, I mean...

549
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:02,383
...I feel a bit sick.

550
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,300
What do you mean by sick?

551
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:04,633
Why, what's wrong?

552
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,675
Oh, God! You've high fever.
Let me take you to a doctor.

553
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,966
No, I've already taken the medicine.

554
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,716
No, come with me.
I'll talk to the doctor.

555
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:15,966
There's no need of it.
I'll be all fine with the medicines.

556
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,425
Why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

557
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,716
What could I've said?

558
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:22,091
It's just a normal fever.
I'll be all fine.

559
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,633
Okay, fine...

560
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:26,008
Let's go somewhere,
it'll be a change for you.

561
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:26,425
Amir!

562
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,341
Why are you forcing me?

563
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:33,591
I'm telling you constantly that
I don't feel good enough to go anywhere.

564
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,800
It'll be better to go sometime later.
Why are you doing this?

565
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,133
This is why, I tell you all...

566
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,966
...don't ever get married!

567
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,633
Now, look at him!

568
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:51,175
Due to his wife's sickness...

569
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,675
...he got stuck here now!

570
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,341
Your love life will...

571
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,091
...ruin all of our's lives.

572
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:02,591
Do whatever you want!

573
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:05,425
Take her to a doctor,
do her treatments...

574
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,216
...but run away from here at once!

575
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:07,758
Get it?

576
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:12,925
No, Murad bhai!

577
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:17,383
I won't take her anywhere
in this condition.

578
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,008
Fine then!

579
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:23,550
Go!

580
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:28,216
Amir!

581
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:36,966
Listen to me!

582
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,800
I'll take care of everything today.

583
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:43,508
But...

584
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,133
...don't make it a habit.

585
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:47,466
Who knows, when the trouble will come.

586
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,550
And I'll be able to do nothing!

587
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:52,925
I'm requesting you.

588
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,383
Don't make me helpless!

589
00:41:56,758 --> 00:41:57,466
Please!

590
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:14,925
Sir!

591
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,550
We searched for the entire locality.

592
00:42:16,716 --> 00:42:18,633
We even searched
the entire house as well.

593
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:19,508
He's nowhere, sir!

594
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,300
I think, he eloped to Dubai.

595
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:23,008
Then?

596
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,633
What to do?
Should we close the case?

597
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:25,675
No.

598
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:27,300
Half-close!

599
00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:27,966
Huh?

600
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,091
The higher authority has given order...

601
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,466
...to close the case.

602
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,341
And for the publice...

603
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:35,300
...we must keep the case open.

604
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:38,133
What will you do then?

605
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:40,966
I'll do my duty.

606
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:43,466
I'll shoot him if I see him.

607
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,966
If I don't, I will leave this matter here.

608
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:50,300
But who is this guy?

609
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:53,633
How come he disappears everytime?

610
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,216
Who's giving him shelter?

611
00:42:58,216 --> 00:42:59,550
I think...

612
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,300
...he's hiding his own identity...

613
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:05,466
...and fooling people
with his false identity.

614
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,175
What do you mean by that?

615
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:08,383
Look,

616
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:11,466
if a criminal stays
within the criminals...

617
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,758
...then it's easy to catch him.

618
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:14,841
Hmm.

619
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:18,466
But if, he stays among the
common people then...

620
00:43:20,758 --> 00:43:21,758
One has to admit...

621
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,383
...he is...

622
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:24,925
...a clever guy.

623
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:29,466
He's always thinking
a step ahead of me.

624
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:33,716
(♪♪♪♪)

625
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:52,675
-As-salamu alaykum!
-Wa-Alaikum-Salaam, Amir!

626
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:53,425
Great!

627
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:54,300
What's all these?

628
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:55,300
All these!

629
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,883
This party is for your come back.

630
00:43:57,966 --> 00:43:58,925
Danger is gone!

631
00:43:59,091 --> 00:43:59,925
The case is closed!

632
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:00,633
Happy?

633
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,133
How do you know that?

634
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:03,466
I?

635
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:04,341
Look,

636
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:07,008
your brother is not only friends
with the criminals.

637
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:08,550
I'm friends with the cops too.

638
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:11,716
How's your wife?

639
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:13,008
She's fine now.

640
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:13,425
Hmm!

641
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,716
Well, God bless her!

642
00:44:15,716 --> 00:44:16,841
She'll be fine, Murad bhai.

643
00:44:18,008 --> 00:44:18,508
Good!

644
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:20,008
So much confident, huh?

645
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,216
No cops could catch me,
what can a woman do to me!

646
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,925
Best of luck!

647
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:28,133
You all enjoy!
I'll leave now.

648
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,050
Amir!

649
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,341
This party is for you.

650
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:46,216
Why are you having soft-drinks then?

651
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,008
Have some alcohol!

652
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,425
Have you gone mad?

653
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:50,300
Why?

654
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:51,883
Don't crazy people drink?

655
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:54,175
You know I don't drink.

656
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,633
I know that.

657
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,966
I know, you don't drink.

658
00:44:58,216 --> 00:45:00,925
Still, for you parties
are taking place.

659
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:01,925
Have a bit!

660
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:04,966
Nobody is safe in our line.

661
00:45:05,966 --> 00:45:08,175
Maybe, you're alive today but
who can tell the future!

662
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,008
Amir...

663
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,466
...he's in Xanadu hotel.

664
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:14,050
That's his real office.

665
00:45:14,383 --> 00:45:15,550
I know very well.

666
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,091
I know that too.

667
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,675
Still, I'm requesting.
Have some.

668
00:45:22,758 --> 00:45:24,216
Who are you?

669
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:27,675
Member!

670
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,841
We all are members of this family.

671
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:32,633
But onething brother!

672
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:36,258
You've trapped a nice fish!

673
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:38,216
What is her name?

674
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:40,258
Some 'Banu'...

675
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:42,133
...yeah, 'Pari Banu'.

676
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,341
Really brother!

677
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,758
The day, I saw her
for the first time...

678
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,758
...right then and there...

679
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,425
...I decided to warm your bed up...

680
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,300
...by sleeping with her.

681
00:45:55,925 --> 00:46:00,050
-I'll satisfy her, I swear!
-You bloody swine!

682
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,550
She's not my keep!

683
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:03,758
She's my wife.

684
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,175
One's wife...

685
00:46:08,675 --> 00:46:09,925
...becomes one's keep.

686
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,341
Once, I said I want your wife...

687
00:46:15,466 --> 00:46:16,425
...I want her at any cost.

688
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:53,466
Amir!

689
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,425
Did you serve my lunch?

690
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,508
Oh, God! I forgot
to bring the bread.

691
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:54,800
Where is Amir?

692
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,466
Amir?

693
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:56,883
At Xanadu hotel.

694
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:58,591
Xanadu hotel!

695
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:00,425
That's his actual office.

696
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:03,300
You told her?

697
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,716
Amir will kill you,
if he gets to know.

698
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,883
I did it for his own good.

699
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:09,466
There's no peace in his life.

700
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:10,633
She's so nagging.

701
00:49:11,175 --> 00:49:12,133
What she could've known later...

702
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:13,300
...she got to know it now.

703
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:21,091
I will see you!

704
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,216
Pari, listen to me!

705
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:32,133
Leave the door!

706
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,466
Listen to me once!

707
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,258
Leave it, I said.

708
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:37,466
-I was about to tell you...
-Leave it!

709
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:40,341
Let's go!

710
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:56,841
Where are you going?

711
00:49:57,091 --> 00:49:57,466
Leave!

712
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:58,925
Let me go!

713
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:00,133
I was going to tell you anyway.

714
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:01,633
No, you weren't
going to tell me anything.

715
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:02,508
Listen to me!

716
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,216
I don't want to hear anything!
I can't and won't live here anymore.

717
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:07,508
Where will you go?

718
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,633
You can't leave me!

719
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,258
I can't live here anymore.

720
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,050
I feel claustrophobic here.
Let me go!

721
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,008
Leave me!

722
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:19,591
Listen to me!

723
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:20,883
Let me go!

724
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:22,716
You're joking right?

725
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:24,716
Isn't it ?

726
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:27,383
You can't leave me!

727
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,466
After all I'm your husband.

728
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:30,550
We're married.

729
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:31,675
How can you leave me!

730
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,050
Now, stop all this drama!

731
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:35,216
Just listen to me once!

732
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:36,258
Don't touch me!

733
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,175
Don't you dare!

734
00:50:38,925 --> 00:50:40,383
You disgust me!

735
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:42,383
I don't accept this marriage!

736
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,175
We're no one to each other!

737
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,675
This marriage is a curse for me!

738
00:50:46,716 --> 00:50:47,675
You're bad for my life!

739
00:50:54,716 --> 00:50:55,633
You kill people right?

740
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:57,550
This is all you can do!

741
00:50:57,758 --> 00:50:58,716
You can only cause pain!

742
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:08,091
Leave me!

743
00:51:08,758 --> 00:51:09,258
Leave!

744
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:14,133
Where are you going?

745
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:14,550
Come on.

746
00:51:14,716 --> 00:51:15,716
Pari, come on!

747
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:17,216
-Let's go inside!
-I won't go anywhere with you.

748
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:17,591
Come!

749
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,216
Please save me!
I don't want to live with him.

750
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:21,216
-Save me please!
-What's going on here?

751
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:23,633
This is my personal matter.
Stay out of it!

752
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:30,716
Leave me, please!

753
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,341
Leave!

754
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,841
Stay right here!

755
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,591
Keep quiet and stay here!

756
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,758
Remember one thing!

757
00:51:56,966 --> 00:51:58,550
I hate you!

758
00:51:59,675 --> 00:52:01,508
I hate your touch!

759
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:04,883
I hate our relation!

760
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:08,091
There's no one for you in this house!

761
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,925
Hook-and-eye as much as you can!

762
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,925
Lock as many doors as you can!

763
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,800
But, you won't be able to lock me up!

764
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,591
You won't be able to, Amir!

765
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:23,383
You've no one now!

766
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,675
You're alone!

767
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:27,966
Alone forever!

768
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:39,175
Will you go mister?

769
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,341
Please sit!

770
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:41,716
-Come on.
-Let's go!

771
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:02,716
Here's your money!

772
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:04,341
Thank you.

773
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,466
Pari!

774
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:51,050
The moment our hearts met...

775
00:54:52,841 --> 00:55:02,091
...our life overflowed with joy.

776
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:15,258
And, you became my destiny...

777
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:22,341
I'm your guiding star.

778
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:27,091
You are my conquest.

779
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:32,508
Though, I have you for eternity...

780
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:35,508
...it never feels enough.

781
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,091
I'm your guiding star.

782
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:46,841
You are my conquest.

783
00:55:47,091 --> 00:55:52,258
Though, I have you for eternity...

784
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:55,258
...it never feels enough.

785
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,091
She is a drug addict.

786
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:11,258
These cases take time to cure.

787
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,300
Look, I can't say anything more now.

788
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,550
Let her come to sense first.

789
00:56:17,966 --> 00:56:18,550
That'll be enough for now.

790
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:21,258
Because of the multiple drugs, she has taken...

791
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:23,800
...their effects will take time to come down.

792
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:26,300
The rest is your responsibility.

793
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:26,925
I mean,

794
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,175
you've to help her to get out of this addiction.

795
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:33,050
Drug addict!

796
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,508
I mean...

797
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:35,841
How this happened?

798
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:37,925
This is a very serious case.

799
00:56:38,091 --> 00:56:39,841
You haven't taken proper care of her.

800
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:42,591
If you really have cared
this wouldn't have happened.

801
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:44,925
Now, it's too late.

802
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,383
Addiction is running in her blood.

803
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,425
She still has the marks of
injections on her hands.

804
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,883
She didn't even eat properly.

805
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:52,466
She is...

806
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,466
...totally weak.

807
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:54,966
What were you doing all this time?

808
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:57,175
I was...

809
00:56:58,175 --> 00:56:58,841
I was then...

810
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,050
There is no other way.

811
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,300
You better be with her.

812
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,050
Take care of her.

813
00:57:03,258 --> 00:57:04,383
Just get her in a rehab...

814
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:05,800
...as soon as possible.

815
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:07,800
Otherwise, there's no hope.

816
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,758
I'm responsible for all this.

817
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:34,925
Just look at her condition!

818
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,133
She has deteriorated a lot.

819
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:41,966
It's over now.
Stop worrying so much!

820
00:58:42,716 --> 00:58:43,633
She's back now.

821
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:47,591
She is totally changed now!

822
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:52,258
Did you see her?

823
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:53,633
Did you see her clothes?

824
00:58:56,258 --> 00:58:58,716
I've no idea how she got into drugs.

825
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:01,550
I don't understand a thing.

826
00:59:04,258 --> 00:59:06,383
All will be fine. Have faith in God.

827
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:07,591
God will solve all your problems.

828
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:10,091
When will you take her home?

829
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,216
Tomorrow.

830
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:27,883
Here it is.

831
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:30,216
I kept all your clothes carefully.

832
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:31,591
I knew...

833
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:34,050
...one day you'll surely come back.

834
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:36,800
Why are you doing all these Amir?

835
00:59:38,258 --> 00:59:39,716
I'm not like before.

836
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,383
Our lives have changed.

837
00:59:44,716 --> 00:59:45,883
Our lives may have changed...

838
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:48,716
...but love never changes, Pari.

839
00:59:59,716 --> 01:00:00,550
I know...

840
01:00:01,383 --> 01:00:02,716
...it's all my fault.

841
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:05,300
Still, I had one hope.

842
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:07,133
I was waiting for you.

843
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:12,050
The one, you were waiting for...

844
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,591
...is way different...

845
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:20,633
...than what I am now.

846
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:25,175
I only know and believe that...

847
01:00:26,508 --> 01:00:27,425
...you are my wife.

848
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,758
I can't go back to that house.

849
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,508
I don't have the pertinence...

850
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,966
...to go back to that house.

851
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:45,050
What is your pertinence...

852
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:46,341
...let me decide that!

853
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:50,550
Let's go.

854
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:17,591
This is Murad bhai's house.

855
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:22,008
That old house was filled with memories.

856
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,716
So, he told to stay here.

857
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:27,258
Come on.

858
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:35,925
Pari!

859
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:41,675
Pari!

860
01:01:51,966 --> 01:01:53,800
I'm going out to buy groceries.

861
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:54,716
Actually,

862
01:01:55,383 --> 01:01:56,550
no one used to live here before.

863
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:58,425
So, there's no food in here.

864
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,591
Will you go with me?

865
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:01,841
No!

866
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:05,133
Do you need anything?

867
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:06,216
No, no!

868
01:02:07,216 --> 01:02:08,675
I don't need anything.

869
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,466
Umm...Pari!

870
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,758
Stay in the house.

871
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:17,925
Don't get lost like before.

872
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:19,425
Lock the door then!

873
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,425
No need of that.

874
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:16,133
Are you planning to open
a chocolate shop or what?

875
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,508
No, she really loves all these.

876
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:23,300
You shouldn't have left her
alone in the house.

877
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,591
It is risky.

878
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,550
I've heard the one who gets into drugs...

879
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:30,175
...they can never be trusted.

880
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,091
I trust her.

881
01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:43,258
She won't go anywhere now.

882
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:44,883
And now I'm with her.

883
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:45,841
All will be fine.

884
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:52,341
Who is it?

885
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:53,216
Angel!

886
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:06,258
Now go!

887
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:06,925
Go!

888
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:58,925
What are you doing?

889
01:04:59,383 --> 01:05:00,883
I don't like this colour.

890
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:03,508
We will paint it blue. Okay?

891
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:05,883
It'll be blue!

892
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:07,508
Blue will look nice.

893
01:05:09,591 --> 01:05:09,883
Did you...

894
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:10,966
...go outside?

895
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:11,716
No!

896
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,008
I didn't go outside!

897
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:15,800
I was here only!

898
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,633
Don't lie to me, Pari!

899
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:19,925
Show me your hands!

900
01:05:20,966 --> 01:05:22,216
I said, show me your hands!

901
01:05:22,716 --> 01:05:23,341
Let me see...

902
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:28,383
Pari, you again...?

903
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:30,800
Did you forget
what the doctor said?

904
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:32,300
These are poisons for you!

905
01:05:32,341 --> 01:05:34,258
You can't take these drugs anymore!

906
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,550
Can you hear me?

907
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,925
I can...

908
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:39,841
Pari, listen to me!

909
01:05:41,008 --> 01:05:41,300
Look,

910
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:44,425
you've to get rid of all these.

911
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:48,591
If not for yourself then be it for me.

912
01:05:49,341 --> 01:05:49,675
Okay?

913
01:05:50,883 --> 01:05:51,258
I'll leave it.

914
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,508
I'll leave it from tomorrow.

915
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,841
Okay...you come with me now.

916
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:03,883
Come, you need to take rest.

917
01:06:04,175 --> 01:06:05,050
-Come!
-No...no...

918
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:07,508
We've to paint this wall.

919
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:09,966
-That wall...
-Come now!

920
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:13,550
-We'll paint it blue.
-Okay, come now.

921
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:16,300
-But we've to...
-We'll do it later. come now.

922
01:06:16,383 --> 01:06:20,216
-It'll be blue! Leave me!
-Yes, let's go now!

923
01:06:21,175 --> 01:06:22,008
May God...

924
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,800
...always be with you.

925
01:06:24,508 --> 01:06:25,175
Look,

926
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,466
how he reunited you two.

927
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:30,341
Now, you must...

928
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:31,758
...stop worrying.

929
01:06:32,216 --> 01:06:33,008
I'm with you.

930
01:06:34,008 --> 01:06:38,175
I know, this addiction to drugs is very terrible.

931
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:39,675
Many times,

932
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,175
poeple die.

933
01:06:41,716 --> 01:06:44,258
And many times people get rid of this too.

934
01:06:45,883 --> 01:06:46,675
You just...

935
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:47,800
...wait for sometimes.

936
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,675
When she went missing
I was searching for her.

937
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:56,591
And now when I've found her,
I got so many questions too.

938
01:06:57,425 --> 01:06:58,508
What happened with her?

939
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:00,133
Who did all this to her?

940
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:02,008
Did you ask her?

941
01:07:04,008 --> 01:07:05,841
She's not in the condition to say anything.

942
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:07,675
Then,

943
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:09,758
wait for her to recover.

944
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:12,050
Ask her then.

945
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:13,591
Not now.

946
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,425
Don't you worry!

947
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:19,383
Murad bhai,

948
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:21,133
I don't get it.

949
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:21,591
I mean,

950
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:24,841
is someone taking revenge on me?

951
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:25,800
Is it...

952
01:07:26,466 --> 01:07:27,925
...that Satish?

953
01:07:28,508 --> 01:07:29,050
No!

954
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:31,508
I would've known...

955
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:33,383
...if it was Satish.

956
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:35,341
Look,

957
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:36,925
if you...

958
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,591
...want to know the truth...

959
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,383
...then...

960
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:41,883
...ask her!

961
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,300
Only she can tell you the truth.

962
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:45,966
Get it?

963
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:49,591
Now, go home. Stop worrying!

964
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:52,216
-I'll go then.
-Hmm!

965
01:07:52,341 --> 01:07:53,633
-Khuda Hafiz!
-Khuda Hafiz!

966
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:03,633
What will you do now?

967
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:06,050
Nothing at all!

968
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:07,758
What if, his wife tells him everything?

969
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,050
We'll see then.

970
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:13,591
How can you forget that he's a hitman?

971
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:14,966
Don't take him too lightly!

972
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:19,133
At first, he's my...

973
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:20,258
...slave.

974
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:21,966
Then, he's a...

975
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:22,966
...hitman.

976
01:08:23,758 --> 01:08:24,341
Get it?

977
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:25,800
Let's go!

978
01:08:36,716 --> 01:08:37,258
Pari!

979
01:08:40,466 --> 01:08:40,883
Pari!

980
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,633
What are you doing here?

981
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:44,633
I've some work.

982
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:45,216
What work?

983
01:08:45,216 --> 01:08:47,508
-Leave me! I've some work.
-Let's go home now.

984
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,675
What's going on?
Let her go!

985
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:53,133
This is our personal matter.
Stay out of it!

986
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,216
He's not my husband.
I don't know her.

987
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:57,341
-I don't know him.
-What's going on?

988
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:05,300
She's my...move away!

989
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,091
(Public chattering)

990
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:09,883
Give all these to me!

991
01:09:10,008 --> 01:09:11,675
I'll take all of these.

992
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:13,925
He doesn't let me come here.

993
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:17,091
I'll take it and hide it all!

994
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:18,633
I'll take these home.

995
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,341
But, why would I give you all these?

996
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:22,675
I also have clients.

997
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:28,425
I need it.

998
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:29,883
Please give me some.

999
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:30,841
Okay, I'll give you.

1000
01:09:32,216 --> 01:09:33,258
But, in exchange of that...

1001
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,425
...what will you give me?

1002
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,675
You don't even have money.

1003
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:41,508
I'll give you.

1004
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:45,508
You take this!

1005
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:47,091
You take this.
My husband has a lot of money.

1006
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,008
Take it!

1007
01:09:49,216 --> 01:09:50,633
Who's talking about money!

1008
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:14,966
B***h!

1009
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:23,925
Don't do this please!

1010
01:10:26,675 --> 01:10:27,425
Don't hit me please!

1011
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,383
Good they all died!

1012
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,758
Now, it's all mine!

1013
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:56,716
-These are all mine!
-Come with me.

1014
01:10:56,883 --> 01:10:58,925
-These are mine.
-Let's go!

1015
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,591
Amir, leave me!
Those are all mine.

1016
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:11,758
Who did this to you?

1017
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:14,175
I don't know.

1018
01:11:14,758 --> 01:11:16,008
Who did it Pari?

1019
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,966
I said, I don't know.

1020
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,841
I don't know a thing.
Just give me the drugs.

1021
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:23,383
You left me.

1022
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:25,841
Where did you go Pari?

1023
01:11:26,091 --> 01:11:27,133
With whom?

1024
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:28,466
Who took you?

1025
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,050
I don't know!

1026
01:11:30,425 --> 01:11:32,050
I don't remember!
I don't know...

1027
01:11:32,883 --> 01:11:35,216
Try to remember,
what happened Pari!

1028
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:38,508
I can't remember!

1029
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:39,550
Think about it!

1030
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,216
Think and tell me right now!

1031
01:11:41,216 --> 01:11:42,800
When they kidnapped me...

1032
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,300
...they locked me up inside a pitch dark room.

1033
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,383
After that, what happened I can't remember.

1034
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:49,675
I didn't see anything!

1035
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:52,591
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
I don't know.

1036
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,716
I don't believe that!

1037
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,800
There has to be someone, Pari.

1038
01:11:59,175 --> 01:11:59,883
Any person?

1039
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:00,883
Any face?

1040
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:02,300
Any shadow?

1041
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,341
You don't remember anything?

1042
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:05,383
You're making me beg to you, right?

1043
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:07,966
You're making me beg
just like them, huh?

1044
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,175
You're my husband.

1045
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,341
You can do whatever you want.
Then do it!

1046
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:14,383
Do it.

1047
01:12:15,925 --> 01:12:17,050
Kill me, Amir!

1048
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,716
I don't want to die
begging for drugs.

1049
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:23,008
Like this...kill me!

1050
01:12:23,091 --> 01:12:24,508
You kill people right?

1051
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,216
Then you can kill me too!
Do it then!

1052
01:12:27,258 --> 01:12:28,883
-Oh, God no!
-Kill me!

1053
01:12:29,216 --> 01:12:30,966
Please kill me!

1054
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:37,591
How do I tell you!

1055
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:41,133
How will I cure you!

1056
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,300
What can I do for you?

1057
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:56,591
All my zeals have turned to ashes.

1058
01:12:56,591 --> 01:13:01,008
Life is like unending mountains.

1059
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:07,091
My happy days are gone.

1060
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:11,550
Gone with the wind.

1061
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:38,008
All my zeals have turned to ashes.

1062
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:42,425
Life is like unending mountains.

1063
01:13:43,341 --> 01:13:48,383
My happy days are gone.

1064
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:51,800
Gone with the wind.

1065
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:57,300
Life is nothing but a delusional maze.

1066
01:13:57,591 --> 01:14:02,383
Who knows, when this suffering will end!

1067
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:07,716
Will she ever answer my call?

1068
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:12,883
Will she ever come back to me?

1069
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:16,133
People are dying because of this.

1070
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:20,050
-Stop this drug dealing.
-Why?

1071
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:22,383
Is someone of your own dying?

1072
01:14:55,550 --> 01:15:00,508
I go to you with only one wish...

1073
01:15:00,508 --> 01:15:04,383
...as my ears crave for
your sweet old words.

1074
01:15:05,841 --> 01:15:10,841
If my heart would've been a stream...

1075
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,091
She must have these meds.

1076
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,050
Not a single one should be missed!

1077
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:17,758
And try not to live her alone!

1078
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:19,008
Get it?

1079
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:31,508
If my heart would've been a stream...

1080
01:15:31,675 --> 01:15:35,341
...my emotions would've flown too far.

1081
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:40,508
Life is nothing but a delusional maze.

1082
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:45,508
Who knows, when this suffering will end!

1083
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:50,800
Will she ever answer my call?

1084
01:15:50,966 --> 01:15:56,008
Will she ever come back to me?

1085
01:16:28,425 --> 01:16:29,925
-Sir, have a look!
-Hmm!

1086
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,841
Find out it's from which shop!

1087
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,133
Yeah, right sir!

1088
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:40,008
Forgive me, Pari!

1089
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,008
I know, I ruined it all.

1090
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:50,383
Slowly, slowly I damaged everything.

1091
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:56,466
I wanted to fill my empty life
with your love.

1092
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,425
But, I ruined that too.

1093
01:17:00,508 --> 01:17:02,466
I had no one to love me, Pari.

1094
01:17:04,008 --> 01:17:06,341
Then you came and
fulfilled me with love.

1095
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,300
But, what could I give you?

1096
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:16,133
I'm even unable to change my past.

1097
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,591
I have no other option than...

1098
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:22,300
...asking for your forgiveness!

1099
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,091
Say, whatever you want.

1100
01:17:25,716 --> 01:17:26,925
Punish me anyway you want.

1101
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:31,383
But forgive me!

1102
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:36,633
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

1103
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,966
You are not at faults.

1104
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,675
I have no reason to punish you.

1105
01:17:45,425 --> 01:17:47,841
You're not responsible
for my condition today.

1106
01:17:50,175 --> 01:17:53,008
Still, if you think
me forgiving you...

1107
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:56,050
...will bring you peace...

1108
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,633
...then I forgave you, Amir.

1109
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:03,383
My God forgave you too.

1110
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,675
Let me give you back...

1111
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:13,175
Let me show you again...

1112
01:18:13,425 --> 01:18:17,466
...a new world full of happiness and joy.

1113
01:18:18,008 --> 01:18:21,341
Mister, is this from your shop?

1114
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:23,383
Yes sir. It's from here only.

1115
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:24,841
What about its details?

1116
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:25,383
We have, sir.

1117
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:26,008
Show me!

1118
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:28,133
Here it is.

1119
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,800
Her face looks familiar!

1120
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:18,591
But why?

1121
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:35,050
Amir Nawaz!

1122
01:19:51,216 --> 01:19:52,050
As-salamu alaykum!

1123
01:19:52,508 --> 01:19:53,175
Wa alaykumu s-salam!

1124
01:19:53,758 --> 01:19:54,383
Myself, Promod Ray.

1125
01:19:55,008 --> 01:19:56,091
A.C.P, crime brunch.

1126
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:57,300
Homicide section.

1127
01:19:58,091 --> 01:19:59,508
Yes, sir tell me.

1128
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:02,216
Three murders have taken place.

1129
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,800
They used to deal in drugs.

1130
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,466
But sir, why do you ask me...

1131
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,133
No, no! You don't bother.

1132
01:20:09,966 --> 01:20:12,216
Just tell us,
where is your wife?

1133
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,008
My wife!

1134
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:14,758
Hmm!

1135
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:17,841
But, what does my wife has to do...

1136
01:20:17,841 --> 01:20:18,925
We suspect that...

1137
01:20:19,216 --> 01:20:21,008
...your wife has a connection
with all these murders.

1138
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:25,300
Sir, how can you say that?

1139
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,175
I mean, how can you be so sure?

1140
01:20:28,175 --> 01:20:28,841
Not sure!

1141
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:30,675
Just suspecting!

1142
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,300
I think, this is a mistake.

1143
01:20:35,383 --> 01:20:37,550
My wife can't kill anyone.

1144
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:41,258
Then, how come this chain...

1145
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:42,675
...reach that spot of murder?

1146
01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:44,883
It's her right?

1147
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:46,591
We've the details of this chain.

1148
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:51,133
My wife is a drug addict, badly.

1149
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:54,008
Maybe, she went there to buy drugs...

1150
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,300
She's at the rehab now.

1151
01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:58,633
Going through treatments.

1152
01:20:58,758 --> 01:21:02,383
Maybe, she went there for drugs and
dropped her chain there.

1153
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:03,383
Hmm!

1154
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:05,175
Where were you then?

1155
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,133
Sir, I'm a cab driver.

1156
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:09,008
I was at my duty.

1157
01:21:09,133 --> 01:21:09,841
Great!

1158
01:21:10,925 --> 01:21:11,883
Your wife is a drug addict.

1159
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,758
You're a cab driver.

1160
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,966
So, you used to leave
her alone like that?

1161
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,591
What options did I have?

1162
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:22,383
To earn, I have to go
out of the house.

1163
01:21:23,633 --> 01:21:24,091
True that!

1164
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:24,675
Hmm.

1165
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,216
But, your neighbours were saying that...

1166
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,300
...someone took her with him.

1167
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,341
Do you know...

1168
01:21:31,508 --> 01:21:32,133
...who that can be?

1169
01:21:35,508 --> 01:21:36,091
No, sir.

1170
01:21:38,175 --> 01:21:38,633
Okay.

1171
01:21:39,758 --> 01:21:41,383
What can we do then!

1172
01:21:42,758 --> 01:21:44,966
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1173
01:21:46,425 --> 01:21:47,633
What can I do?

1174
01:21:48,341 --> 01:21:49,591
I'm habituated of suspecting.

1175
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:51,966
Like an addiction to drugs.

1176
01:21:52,633 --> 01:21:53,216
Can't get rid of it.

1177
01:21:54,758 --> 01:21:55,216
Let's go!

1178
01:21:56,091 --> 01:21:56,591
Khuda Hafiz!

1179
01:21:57,466 --> 01:21:58,258
Khuda Hafiz!

1180
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:03,591
Go, sit in the back.

1181
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:04,425
Yes, sir.

1182
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,341
Sir!

1183
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,508
You didn't even investigate at all!

1184
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:13,716
I'll investigate!

1185
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:14,758
Not him but his wife.

1186
01:22:15,383 --> 01:22:16,175
But why her?

1187
01:22:17,383 --> 01:22:18,758
She is the eye witness.

1188
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,675
Only, she knows...

1189
01:22:21,133 --> 01:22:22,258
...who did all the murders!

1190
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:24,216
And, I'm sure...

1191
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:27,883
...this is the person
I've been looking for.

1192
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:34,883
So many bullets fired!

1193
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,883
Enough to wake up the dead!

1194
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,050
And, you're saying
you don't remember!

1195
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:41,716
Sir,

1196
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,133
I would've told you if I remembered.

1197
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:47,841
Who took you out from there?

1198
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,800
I don't remember.

1199
01:22:52,758 --> 01:22:53,633
Do you remember his face?

1200
01:22:54,508 --> 01:22:54,800
Umm...no!

1201
01:22:56,883 --> 01:22:57,883
Do you remember me?

1202
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,258
I've arrested you 3-4 times.

1203
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:03,425
From different places!

1204
01:23:06,091 --> 01:23:07,591
You look way different in a photograph.

1205
01:23:08,758 --> 01:23:09,216
That was...

1206
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:11,300
...clicked...

1207
01:23:12,258 --> 01:23:12,841
...long ago, sir.

1208
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:14,008
Hmm!

1209
01:23:15,383 --> 01:23:16,425
It's 2 years old.

1210
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:18,758
But, seems like 100 years.

1211
01:23:20,841 --> 01:23:22,050
Do you meet Murad Jamil now?

1212
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:26,133
He used to give your bails.

1213
01:23:28,716 --> 01:23:29,300
Yes...

1214
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,050
...sometimes I see him.

1215
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,591
He used you well.

1216
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:37,508
He made you do his work.

1217
01:23:38,258 --> 01:23:39,050
Also, got you addicted.

1218
01:23:40,675 --> 01:23:41,550
Then, here...

1219
01:23:42,175 --> 01:23:42,841
...or, there...

1220
01:23:43,175 --> 01:23:43,758
...or somewhere else...

1221
01:23:44,133 --> 01:23:45,050
...kept sending you.

1222
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:47,300
Does your husband know all this?

1223
01:23:52,175 --> 01:23:53,050
What a couple!

1224
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,175
He's a simple taxi driver.

1225
01:23:56,758 --> 01:23:58,008
And, you're an escort.

1226
01:23:59,091 --> 01:23:59,883
Drug addict!

1227
01:24:02,425 --> 01:24:03,300
Anyways, these are different matters.

1228
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,466
This case is different.

1229
01:24:07,883 --> 01:24:08,716
Okay.

1230
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:10,508
I'll come here again.

1231
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:13,050
Try to remember by then.

1232
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,716
Or else, I know how to...

1233
01:24:16,633 --> 01:24:17,508
...make you remember!

1234
01:24:21,175 --> 01:24:21,758
Let's go, sir.

1235
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,966
Where is your wife?

1236
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:23,925
At the rehab.

1237
01:26:24,425 --> 01:26:25,800
The person...

1238
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,966
...who's responsible for the
condition of your wife...

1239
01:26:31,258 --> 01:26:33,091
...will surely be punished...

1240
01:26:34,508 --> 01:26:36,550
...by me.

1241
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:39,841
I'll shoot him!

1242
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:49,341
I'll do the same too.

1243
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:55,841
Do you know, who is that?

1244
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,216
I'm a bit confused.

1245
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,591
I know some of it.

1246
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:05,091
And some of it is left to know, yet.

1247
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:10,008
Give me a drink!

1248
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:50,550
You believe in God, right?

1249
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,425
You worshipped him every single day.

1250
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:58,508
This book is about that God.

1251
01:28:00,425 --> 01:28:02,925
Just how you told
the truth to the cops...

1252
01:28:04,466 --> 01:28:05,716
...tell me the same too.

1253
01:28:31,758 --> 01:28:33,841
That night after all those troubles...

1254
01:28:35,216 --> 01:28:37,508
...I thought I'll tell everything to the cops.

1255
01:28:37,966 --> 01:28:39,425
So, I left the house.

1256
01:28:39,466 --> 01:28:40,050
But,

1257
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:42,008
Hey, wait!

1258
01:28:42,175 --> 01:28:43,633
Catch her!

1259
01:28:43,633 --> 01:28:46,966
-Catch her!
-Let me go.

1260
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:07,800
I predicted it already.

1261
01:29:09,633 --> 01:29:13,341
I said that because of you,
we all will die.

1262
01:29:13,508 --> 01:29:15,008
We all will die because of you.

1263
01:29:15,425 --> 01:29:16,300
Now, see!

1264
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:17,883
That's what happened!

1265
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,966
You went to complain against me.

1266
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,841
Against your husband!

1267
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:28,258
No!

1268
01:29:28,925 --> 01:29:32,216
Do you know,
I picked up Amir from the streets?

1269
01:29:32,258 --> 01:29:35,758
I turned him into a beast from a human
after so much effort.

1270
01:29:35,925 --> 01:29:36,966
I made him a drugs dealer.

1271
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:38,133
Made him an arms dealer.

1272
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,883
He became the world's
most popular hitman.

1273
01:29:40,883 --> 01:29:42,258
Because of whom?
It's me.

1274
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,800
He never missed a target before.

1275
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,175
But, what went wrong this time?

1276
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:50,758
What about this time?

1277
01:29:52,758 --> 01:29:55,050
Everyone look at her!

1278
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,675
What does she have?
What?

1279
01:29:58,675 --> 01:29:59,883
She must have something different.

1280
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,175
Amir is crazy for her.

1281
01:30:02,383 --> 01:30:04,925
He has gone crazy in your love.

1282
01:30:05,175 --> 01:30:06,133
And, you...

1283
01:30:07,675 --> 01:30:09,133
...went against him!

1284
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:15,425
Remember, that bullet?

1285
01:30:17,508 --> 01:30:20,091
Do you remember that?

1286
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,925
Amir fired it for you.

1287
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,008
For you.

1288
01:30:24,425 --> 01:30:26,133
Remember, Satish?

1289
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:30,341
Satish wanted to sleep with you.

1290
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,925
That's why, Amir attacked her.

1291
01:30:34,258 --> 01:30:35,800
-Let me see.
-No!

1292
01:30:36,341 --> 01:30:37,550
No? Okay, okay.

1293
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:42,091
Your eyes...

1294
01:30:44,466 --> 01:30:46,175
...will ruin us.

1295
01:30:47,633 --> 01:30:48,383
No!

1296
01:30:50,175 --> 01:30:51,633
I won't let that happen.

1297
01:30:52,841 --> 01:30:55,175
The issue started
because of your honor.

1298
01:30:57,466 --> 01:31:00,758
So, your honor will be jeopardized then.

1299
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:05,925
Take her!

1300
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:07,091
Sell her!

1301
01:31:07,175 --> 01:31:08,675
Take her, at once!

1302
01:31:08,716 --> 01:31:11,675
-Finish her honor!
-Come on, you b***h!

1303
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,216
-Come on!
-Leave me.

1304
01:31:14,216 --> 01:31:16,383
Ruin her life, go!

1305
01:31:16,675 --> 01:31:17,883
Come!

1306
01:32:15,508 --> 01:32:16,633
They sold me!

1307
01:32:17,216 --> 01:32:19,341
For few money, they sold me.

1308
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,758
Let me go!

1309
01:32:57,675 --> 01:32:58,716
Take her!

1310
01:34:28,341 --> 01:34:28,966
What?

1311
01:34:30,091 --> 01:34:31,175
Want some?

1312
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,591
Beg for it, then!

1313
01:35:06,841 --> 01:35:08,133
I started to change.

1314
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:12,425
I changed city, even countries.

1315
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,758
I wandered off in the
middle of nowhere.

1316
01:35:30,508 --> 01:35:33,091
My punishment was even bigger,
than my mistake.

1317
01:35:34,883 --> 01:35:36,633
When did Pari...

1318
01:35:37,383 --> 01:35:38,591
...become Angel,

1319
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:40,633
I had no idea.

1320
01:35:41,633 --> 01:35:43,008
I got used to it, after that.

1321
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,300
Got used to of living without you.

1322
01:35:45,925 --> 01:35:48,050
Got used to of this pain.

1323
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,758
Got used of the addiction.

1324
01:35:57,508 --> 01:35:59,425
Then, I again got you back.

1325
01:35:59,633 --> 01:36:01,008
After such a long time.

1326
01:36:02,508 --> 01:36:04,841
The one, you married...

1327
01:36:04,883 --> 01:36:06,966
...was a decent girl.

1328
01:36:07,508 --> 01:36:09,883
And, the one you rescued...

1329
01:36:10,633 --> 01:36:11,508
...she was...

1330
01:36:15,466 --> 01:36:16,591
...not even alive.

1331
01:36:17,175 --> 01:36:18,300
I was being punished...

1332
01:36:18,841 --> 01:36:20,258
...for misunderstanding you.

1333
01:36:22,633 --> 01:36:23,508
Did you realise, Amir?

1334
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:26,716
So, many things
happened in our lives.

1335
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:30,675
But,

1336
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:32,716
it was written somewhere ...

1337
01:36:33,841 --> 01:36:35,383
...that we'll meet again.

1338
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:39,216
I have nothing to wish for.

1339
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:41,550
I've nothing to gain.

1340
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:44,591
I've nothing to say even.

1341
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:47,341
What's there to tell, anyway!

1342
01:36:49,758 --> 01:36:50,758
It's all my fate!

1343
01:36:58,966 --> 01:37:01,008
All I want is to die in peace.

1344
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:04,466
I've said, what I had to.

1345
01:37:05,883 --> 01:37:07,591
Now, you can do whatever you want.

1346
01:37:08,675 --> 01:37:10,175
I won't be stopping you anymore.

1347
01:37:10,466 --> 01:37:12,508
I won't be the barrier
in your way anymore.

1348
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:55,508
Amir!

1349
01:37:56,716 --> 01:37:57,966
Don't take one more step!

1350
01:37:58,925 --> 01:38:00,091
Don't even dare!

1351
01:38:00,591 --> 01:38:01,216
What happened?

1352
01:38:02,175 --> 01:38:02,883
Scared huh?

1353
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,050
I should've killed you earlier.

1354
01:38:16,175 --> 01:38:18,133
Addiction is your forte huh?

1355
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:20,841
Come on then.

1356
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:22,633
I'll show you
what addiction is!

1357
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,300
No! No!

1358
01:39:20,758 --> 01:39:22,425
I heard a story once.

1359
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:24,050
Long time back.

1360
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:26,508
If one,

1361
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:28,883
needs to kill the king...

1362
01:39:29,258 --> 01:39:30,966
...he must kill his parrot first.

1363
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:33,841
-Rony!
-Yes, boss?

1364
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:35,466
Where is my king's parrot?

1365
01:39:36,591 --> 01:39:39,258
Wow! You look really
beautiful today.

1366
01:39:40,216 --> 01:39:42,508
After a long time,

1367
01:39:43,175 --> 01:39:44,925
I'm going back
to my own house.

1368
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:46,300
That's why!

1369
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:46,883
What?

1370
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:48,216
When?

1371
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:51,050
You just stay there,
I'm coming boss.

1372
01:39:51,341 --> 01:39:52,633
I'll be there in no time!

1373
01:39:56,633 --> 01:39:58,050
Murad bhai, called me.

1374
01:39:58,883 --> 01:40:01,675
He told me to kill you.
You should run away!

1375
01:40:01,675 --> 01:40:02,716
-Run away!
-You knew everything.

1376
01:40:04,425 --> 01:40:05,716
All of it!

1377
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:10,050
I was looking for her
past two years.

1378
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:14,133
You didn't tell me once.

1379
01:40:15,758 --> 01:40:17,841
You let it happen
in front of you.

1380
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:19,966
You kept...

1381
01:40:20,591 --> 01:40:22,050
...fooling me as a friend.

1382
01:40:23,008 --> 01:40:24,383
You told me to forget her!

1383
01:40:26,925 --> 01:40:27,758
To move on with life!

1384
01:40:29,466 --> 01:40:31,133
She was dying a bit every day.

1385
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:35,133
People were taking
advantage of her.

1386
01:40:36,258 --> 01:40:37,383
And you let this happen?

1387
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,341
No, trust me...

1388
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,466
...I was...

1389
01:40:41,883 --> 01:40:42,925
You're misunderstanding me.

1390
01:40:45,216 --> 01:40:46,966
I was misunderstanding you so far.

1391
01:40:48,758 --> 01:40:49,550
But, now...

1392
01:40:51,133 --> 01:40:51,841
...I won't.

1393
01:40:52,716 --> 01:40:53,466
Amir,

1394
01:40:54,258 --> 01:40:55,383
what are you doing?

1395
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:58,341
You can't kill me!

1396
01:41:00,091 --> 01:41:01,091
I'm your friend.

1397
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,633
Murad bhai used to say...

1398
01:41:04,966 --> 01:41:06,550
...in our business,
we all are just humans.

1399
01:41:08,883 --> 01:41:09,425
No mother!

1400
01:41:10,258 --> 01:41:10,925
No father!

1401
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:12,258
No brother!

1402
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,550
And no friend!

1403
01:41:15,258 --> 01:41:17,050
Someone came to visit you.

1404
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:17,466
Okay.

1405
01:41:23,716 --> 01:41:25,133
-Hi, Angel!
-Hmm?

1406
01:41:32,841 --> 01:41:33,300
Amir!

1407
01:41:48,675 --> 01:41:49,258
Sir!

1408
01:41:49,883 --> 01:41:50,966
He's from Murad's gang.

1409
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,841
We have proofs
in the CCTV footages.

1410
01:41:54,008 --> 01:41:55,591
He committed all the murders.

1411
01:41:55,841 --> 01:41:56,841
He's the 'Taxi Driver'.

1412
01:42:01,341 --> 01:42:02,800
Taxi driver!

1413
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:35,091
Let me give you back...

1414
01:42:35,425 --> 01:42:38,383
Let me show you again...

1415
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,758
...a new world full of happiness and joy.

1416
01:42:45,508 --> 01:42:48,591
Let me again make you...

1417
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,883
...the important part of my life
or life itself.

1418
01:42:52,133 --> 01:42:57,133
We'll create a new beginning
all over again.

1419
01:42:57,175 --> 01:43:03,716
Life is nothing but a delusional maze.

1420
01:43:03,841 --> 01:43:10,050
Who knows, when this suffering will end!

1421
01:43:10,466 --> 01:43:16,925
Will she ever answer my call?

1422
01:43:17,175 --> 01:43:23,258
Will she ever come back to me?

1423
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:36,716
Amir...Amir...where is he?

1424
01:43:37,425 --> 01:43:38,216
I don't know that.

1425
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,383
He left from the hospital.

1426
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:42,175
But, I don't know where he went.

1427
01:43:44,425 --> 01:43:46,133
-You don't know?
-No.

1428
01:43:46,925 --> 01:43:48,258
How could you not know?

1429
01:43:48,925 --> 01:43:51,216
You know,
he's a contract killer right?

1430
01:43:51,841 --> 01:43:52,716
Contract killer!

1431
01:43:53,466 --> 01:43:57,258
He has now taken
the charge to kill me.

1432
01:43:58,216 --> 01:44:02,341
Whether I stay here or leave,
it doesn't matter.

1433
01:44:03,091 --> 01:44:04,300
I'll die.

1434
01:44:04,925 --> 01:44:05,758
And with me...

1435
01:44:06,508 --> 01:44:07,591
...you all will die too.

1436
01:44:09,008 --> 01:44:10,091
All of you will be dead.

1437
01:44:14,008 --> 01:44:14,675
ALL: Stop him!

1438
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:22,008
She won't do anything.

1439
01:45:25,716 --> 01:45:26,633
She's dead now.

1440
01:45:29,383 --> 01:45:30,300
Dead forever.

1441
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,550
I killed her.

1442
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:36,175
Not today.

1443
01:45:38,341 --> 01:45:40,925
She died the day,
I married her.

1444
01:45:43,008 --> 01:45:44,216
That's not your fault.

1445
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:48,633
She died that day,
when I hid the truth from her.

1446
01:45:51,508 --> 01:45:52,883
That's not your fault too.

1447
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,175
I'm responsible for her death.

1448
01:45:58,758 --> 01:45:59,383
Not you.

1449
01:46:00,925 --> 01:46:01,883
Only me.

1450
01:46:04,841 --> 01:46:07,800
But you polluted her pure soul.

1451
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,300
You sold her honor.

1452
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,758
You auctioned her body.

1453
01:46:14,466 --> 01:46:15,633
That's your fault.

1454
01:46:17,966 --> 01:46:20,133
Now the time has come
to make it even, Murad.

1455
01:46:21,966 --> 01:46:22,841
Today,

1456
01:46:24,091 --> 01:46:25,300
who's going to
save me from you?

1457
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,300
I am...

1458
01:46:34,466 --> 01:46:36,591
I am not afraid of death.

1459
01:46:38,216 --> 01:46:40,883
I buy and sell death.

1460
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,383
And you did the same too.

1461
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:47,050
Instead of death,

1462
01:46:47,675 --> 01:46:49,758
you sold your loyalty.

1463
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:53,383
You have sinned.

1464
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,008
I've recieved punishment.

1465
01:47:02,758 --> 01:47:05,133
When my close one died...

1466
01:47:05,883 --> 01:47:08,050
...I understood how it feels.

1467
01:47:12,258 --> 01:47:14,883
I suffered more than I sinned.

1468
01:47:16,466 --> 01:47:17,341
A lot more.

1469
01:47:18,675 --> 01:47:20,216
Even if you survive today...

1470
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,216
...how will you face
your God in the after life?

1471
01:47:23,466 --> 01:47:24,800
Who'll save you there?

1472
01:47:34,758 --> 01:47:35,550
Let's move.

1473
01:47:36,008 --> 01:47:37,966
Amir, what are you doing?

1474
01:47:38,633 --> 01:47:41,716
You'll kill a helpless man?

1475
01:47:42,425 --> 01:47:43,258
You s**ne!

1476
01:47:43,633 --> 01:47:45,008
You'll kill a helpless,

1477
01:47:45,466 --> 01:47:47,466
armless man?

1478
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:48,133
No!

1479
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,800
That has been my job so far.

1480
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:53,633
Why not...

1481
01:47:54,216 --> 01:47:54,883
...another one today!

1482
01:47:56,133 --> 01:47:56,966
Amir Nawaz!

1483
01:47:57,883 --> 01:47:58,550
Drop the gun!

1484
01:47:58,716 --> 01:48:00,591
Inspector, please save me!

1485
01:48:00,925 --> 01:48:01,966
He's gone mad.

1486
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,883
Because of his wife's death,
he has gone mad!
