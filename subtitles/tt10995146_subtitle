1
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,295
The storm in the Bay of Bengal
has turned into a typhoon.

2
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,670
According to the meteorological department,
in the next 48 hours...

3
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,337
there is a strong likelihood that in northern parts of Andhra
and both the Godavari districts, there will normal to heavy rains.

4
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:03,011
Hey Nandu..

5
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:04,719
Stop playing with the rain while you are in a moving train.

6
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,344
Just come in.

7
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,719
It’s fun when one does things like this
on a moving train.

8
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:10,594
Yeah, right!
And what happens if you get hurt?

9
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:11,511
Look at your head

10
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,177
Madam, Some unknown people are in
a fight with your husband.

11
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:14,594
Please come.

12
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,177
It’s up to us.
We make some videos for our pleasure.

13
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,261
Why do you care?
Why should we tell you?

14
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:19,844
Why are we accountable to you?

15
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:21,511
Just calm down.
Just clear the way.

16
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,386
Calm down. Calm down.

17
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,552
What’s the issue?

18
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:24,886
Why are you ganging up against this old man?

19
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:25,927
Nothing, sir.

20
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,552
My dad cannot keep his thoughts to himself.
He told them how he felt

21
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:29,677
...and they didn’t like it.

22
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:32,052
Why would anyone get into a fight just
because he spoke his thoughts out loud?

23
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:33,927
The thing is, he doesn’t measure his words.

24
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:36,386
My master here, cannot differentiate between thoughts
that are to be kept private and thoughts..

25
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,552
that can be spoke out.

26
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,552
What does that mean?

27
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,011
Don’t you understand, dimwit?

28
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,344
You have become a Ticket Collector (TC)
on recommendation. Look at your pasty face!

29
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,011
What is this?

30
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:48,136
The thing is...TC
-I get it.

31
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,136
I became a TC without merit.

32
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,052
And I have a pasty face.

33
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,886
Well, I...
...did I spill my inner thoughts?

34
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,344
Anyways, what did he say that was
so offensive to you?

35
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:01,011
We were making tiktok videos because we
were bored and he kept scolding us.

36
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,427
They are not tiktok videos, sir.

37
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:03,886
Anyone who watches it will have a heart attack.

38
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,891
Anyways, why couldn’t you make those
Tiktok videos at home?

39
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:08,266
Why choose public places?
Disperse please!

40
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:09,474
Move along
Go on lady...

41
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:10,641
What happened?

42
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,933
What happened, father?
-The thing is...

43
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,016
The thing is...

44
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,984
Your weakness is going to be the death of me.

45
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,151
You did the same thing in Simhachalam temple.

46
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,109
Passengers your kind attention please,

47
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,442
Because of the felling of trees on the
train track to Annavaram...

48
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,859
The train is being halted here.

49
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,401
The train will commence once
we get the track cleared.

50
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,401
Mother, apparently the train is
going to be here for a while.

51
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,067
I will go and get something hot.

52
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,692
We regret the inconvenience caused
to the passengers.

53
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,151
You stay here. He will go.

54
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,109
You go on, husband.

55
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:36,776
Mother...

56
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,192
I have spoken.
I won’t go back on my word.

57
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,229
Two plates of hot fitters please.

58
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,396
Even before the journey commenced,
I already knew it.

59
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,854
That there will be interruptions in
today’s journey due to horoscope

60
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:47,563
Now look at this.

61
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,896
Don’t know when this train would
resume the journey is.

62
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,896
That is why we were told to consult with the
planets and the stars before commencing the journey.

63
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:54,771
Sir...

64
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,063
This rain...This sun...

65
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,729
and train stopping...

66
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,688
are all of these in your scriptures?

67
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:01,521
Most certainly.

68
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:05,354
Astrology was born for the purpose of
finding out what the future holds.

69
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,188
So, will you tell me my future?

70
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:08,604
My master will be able to read anyone’s fortunes.

71
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,960
Just hurry and give him
the time and place of your birth.

72
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,210
and he would read your fortune quickly.

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,460
November 5th, 1993
Morning 4:00 am, Rajahmundry.

74
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,168
I gave the information immediately.
Now tell me my fortune quickly.

75
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:16,710
Now, listen girl.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,126
I don’t know if you trying to make fools of us
or if you are genuinely interested in your fortune.

77
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,460
But, I will tell you your future.

78
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,960
Alright. I will wait for you in S1 compartment.

79
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:25,626
Alright?

80
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:29,835
Mother, here are chilli fritters.
They are very hot.

81
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,251
I don’t want them.

82
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,501
I wonder what oil he used to fry them in?!

83
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,585
Mother, it is a big deal that we found this in a weather like this
and that too at a station such as this.

84
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,793
Sister, what about you?
-Of course. I was waiting for them.

85
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,210
I tried my best to convince people at home.

86
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,668
What can you do if they didn’t agree?

87
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,501
You said Chandu would come to Annavaram, right?

88
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,043
If we get the marriage over with first,
parents would be convinced later.

89
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,418
It’s something related to problems of love.

90
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:51,876
Hi, I am Nandini.

91
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,126
Were you talking about some love problem?

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,168
Are you eloping?
-Why do you need to know?

93
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:58,293
Curiosity.

94
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,460
Who wouldn’t be interested in a good love story?

95
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:02,460
Please tell me.

96
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:03,835
How long have you guys been together?

97
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:04,710
Since a year.

98
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:06,126
Only a year?

99
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,418
I have been in love for the past 15 years.

100
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:09,626
15 years?

101
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,168
Yeah.

102
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,085
Well then, fill us in on the details of your
love story.

103
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,626
And then I will tell you about mine.

104
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:17,001
Well it’s better to call it my lover’s story
rather than a love story.

105
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:23,376
If I have to tell you about my hero,
I should begin from my childhood days.

106
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,626
In Narsapur,
when we were studying in school...

107
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,418
On one August 15th,

108
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,460
The school was bustling with students.

109
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:33,543
Madam is here.

110
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:34,835
Hello, Madam.

111
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,376
Hello, sir.

112
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,085
You told me that you would let my eldest
daughter play the character of Rudramadevi.

113
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,251
Shirisha is not able to remember those dialogues.

114
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,626
That is the reason why I could
not give the part to her.

115
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,335
By the way, you told me that you would get
my husband’s loan sanctioned?

116
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:46,293
Did you get it done?

117
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:50,126
<i>You won’t get my daughter to perform</i>
<i>but you want a bank loan for your husband?</i>

118
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,376
<i>Look at that shrivelled up face of yours!</i>

119
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,210
Well, ask your husband to come to the bank
we will get the loan approved.

120
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,043
We don’t want it.

121
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,251
Why did she stomp off that seriously
when I told her that we would sanction a bank loan?

122
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,418
You spilled your inner thoughts.

123
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:03,085
Let’s go.

124
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:05,501
Come... Come. Sit.
-How are you?

125
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,543
When did you get here?
-It’s been ten minutes.

126
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,710
I was told that your son would be giving us
a special performance today?

127
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:10,543
Yes.
-Where is he?

128
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,460
Generally, only one person performs on the stage.

129
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:14,501
But my hero....

130
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,001
Mr. Rutherford.

131
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,293
Even before your country could open its eyes,
my country touched modernity.

132
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:22,668
Even before you knew how to dress up,
we manufactured silk robes here.

133
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:25,543
When you didn’t even have a language,
mathematics was born here.

134
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:30,126
In this land of such knowledge and scriptures,
You claim you have modernised it?

135
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,835
Such hypocrisy, Rutherford!

136
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:36,876
We don’t want to get into
unnecessary debate with you, Ramaraju.

137
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,085
If you surrender to us,
You will stay alive.

138
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,418
If not...

139
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,126
Are you going to kill me?

140
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,876
If you kill one Seetha Ramaraju,
Millions more will appear.

141
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,168
Seetha Ramaraju is not an individual.
He is a collective strength.

142
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:51,376
He is a movement.

143
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:52,751
He is a slogan for freedom.

144
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,918
I don’t tolerate this!

145
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:55,918
FIRE!

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,585
I will become the mud in this land.

147
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,668
I will become water in this ocean.

148
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,543
I will become the breath in my people.

149
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,168
And will win over the forces of the empire.

150
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,835
I will be the victory song of my country’s independence.

151
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,751
<i>Vande Mataram</i>
(Mother! I bow to thee.)

152
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,793
<i>Vande Mataram</i>
(Mother! I bow to thee.)

153
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,210
You have performed both characters beautifully.

154
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,668
You might become a hero when you grow up.

155
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,168
If he has to become a hero,
you will have to become the producer.

156
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,918
Daddy doesn’t need to become a producer

157
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,001
If Balu becomes the hero,
I will become the producer.

158
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:27,793
I already said it,
I won’t go back on my word.

159
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,668
Is that ok, hero?
-Okay, producer.

160
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:44,293
What happened?
Why are you so gloomy?

161
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,001
What happened?

162
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,001
Mom, scolded me.

163
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:47,626
Why?

164
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,293
Why because...
Your son has become very charitable.

165
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,960
A kid in the school did not have his geometry box
So, he gave his instead.

166
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,585
That fellow doesn’t have a father.

167
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:55,710
And his mother is the one who is supposed to buy it for him.

168
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,793
And she didn’t buy it yet.

169
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:57,960
That is the reason I gave mine to him.

170
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:58,626
Is that so?

171
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,668
Do you know how happy he became when
I gave it to him?

172
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:02,376
Very good.

173
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,126
Remember this in your life.

174
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,168
When you give someone something,
It will return and come back to you.

175
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,876
If you give love,
You will receive love.

176
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,210
If you give happiness,
you will receive happiness.

177
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,418
And If you give pain
you will receive pain too.

178
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,835
That is all well and good.
Next week is your birthday.

179
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,001
What gift do you want?

180
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,085
Gift?

181
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,585
Call all our relatives this time, dad.

182
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,376
All our relatives, why?

183
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:24,835
Why don’t you invite your friends?

184
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,043
They are the ones who come for every birthday of mine.

185
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,085
So, for this birthday of mine,
I want aunts and uncle.

186
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,251
Every one of them.

187
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:36,168
You asked me what present I wanted, right?
This is what I want.

188
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,376
Fine. I will call them.

189
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,085
But why do you want to invite all of them?

190
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,918
I like our relatives.

191
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:49,876
He is your brother from Antarvedi.

192
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,918
Hello, brother.
-How are you?

193
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:54,668
Happy birthday to you
-Start it.

194
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,543
Happy birthday to you.

195
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,585
Why would you go to such grand to
celebrate a birthday?

196
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,793
Calling all relatives, neighbours, etc.

197
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:06,585
He asked for it.

198
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,001
Uncle.

199
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:08,710
Hi...

200
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,126
Look how happy he is.

201
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,835
Aunty.
Have another sweet.

202
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,376
No. No. I have diabetes.

203
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,460
If that’s the case, have a tablet.

204
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,001
Naughty fellow!

205
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,543
Hero... That uncle there wants a piece of sweet.

206
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,251
Let’s go producer.

207
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:20,251
Move aside, uncle.

208
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,751
Couldn’t you have come during summer vacation?

209
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,585
If its possible, we will definitely come.

210
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,501
No one can write a better screenplay than god himself.

211
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:36,210
My hero who wanted to be close to his near and dear ones,
lost his parents in an accident.

212
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,126
He has a lot of relatives, right?

213
00:09:58,251 --> 00:09:59,293
Could one of them take him?

214
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,751
Friends would be more supportive than relatives.

215
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,501
And they have to be too.

216
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:06,835
We have two daughters in the house.

217
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,126
I don’t like having him here in this house.

218
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:19,001
You will come once a week to visit me. Right, uncle?

219
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,376
Most certainly.

220
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:24,876
And if you want to see me in between,
Tell the warden. They will call me.

221
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,335
Study well, okay?

222
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,251
Bye, hero.
-Bye, producer.

223
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:38,085
I heard you lost your parents in an accident

224
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,126
My name is Raju.
-I am Balu.

225
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Hey.
-What’s up?

226
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,293
Why are you drawing all this?

227
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,085
You don’t have any relatives, right?

228
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:58,418
I don’t have now.
But they will come later.

229
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,335
Did you learn the dialogues by rote?
-Did the breakfast arrive?

230
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,585
No, the breakfast did not come yet.
-Then the dialogues are not learnt yet.

231
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,085
What? Are the dialogues and breakfasts related?

232
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,210
I was just joking.
-But I am quite serious.

233
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,710
We are doing a short film here.

234
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,293
If you act all haughty,
you will be removed from the role.

235
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,085
Where is Sudarshan?

236
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,126
I am here.

237
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,210
Sudha?
-What?

238
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,085
Our video isn’t garnering views.

239
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,085
Take my suggestion and put the thumb line I give you.
The views will increase drastically.

240
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:41,626
Tell me.

241
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:45,168
"The parents are shocked at what their
daughter does early in the morning."

242
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,001
Super..
-Is that so?

243
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:47,085
What was she doing?

244
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,126
She was putting Rangoli.

245
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,126
She is doing something traditional.
Why put a thumb line that has an innuendo?

246
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:51,960
What can we do?

247
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,543
If we say that the father is happy that
his daughter puts Rangoli.

248
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:55,501
Who is going to watch that?

249
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,501
Hey, have all the artists come?

250
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:02,984
How much?
-281.

251
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:06,993
Hi, everyone.

252
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:08,326
Hi...

253
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:09,368
What’s with the delay?

254
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,826
Should we wait for you as well?

255
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,784
We started very early Nandu.

256
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,784
But we were stuck in a huge traffic jam at Dilshukhnagar.

257
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:15,868
By the way, where is Balu?

258
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,117
You are the god of this 'Kaliyuga'.

259
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,909
You are the god of generosity.

260
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,700
You are the protector

261
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,575
Our support is you.

262
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,409
Oh god of benevolence

263
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,242
The fountain of miracles.

264
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:29,075
For the entire 100 years of his life,

265
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,034
Please bless this good man!

266
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,227
Hey, look there.

267
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,144
I heard about <i>‘Thulabharam’</i> but never watched it.

268
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:41,561
Priest, what’s special about today?

269
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,655
<i>‘Thulabharam’.</i>

270
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,780
Today is his grandson’s birthday.

271
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:48,822
They are going to weigh him against money
and feed the poor with that money.

272
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,822
Why do you weigh so little?

273
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,280
If you had a little more weight on you,
it would have been nice.

274
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,488
If you had told me last night that you were going to arrange for
something like this,I would have had a heavy dinner.

275
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,488
Get down carefully.

276
00:12:58,488 --> 00:12:59,863
Excuse me.
Can we take a selfie?

277
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:00,780
Sure.

278
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,447
Come grandma. Come here grandpa.

279
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,155
What’s your grandson’s name, sir?
-Shiva.

280
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,488
<i>(chanting prayers)</i>

281
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:15,738
Grandma...

282
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,072
I have a small gift for you.

283
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,738
What is this?

284
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,905
I downloaded all of your favourite old songs into this.

285
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,113
You can watch it anytime you want.

286
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:26,572
It's your birthday. Why would you give me a gift?

287
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:27,697
Consider it a return gift.

288
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:31,655
Of course! Of course! You love your grandmother more than me.

289
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,363
Did you ever bother to give me a return gift?

290
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,905
Don't feel too bad old man !

291
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,947
I got something for you too.

292
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,863
Okay, I shall take my leave, grandpa.

293
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,905
Why are you leaving so soon?

294
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,113
Couldn't you stay a while longer?

295
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,447
I have to go, grandma.

296
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:46,988
My friends have been calling me continuously.

297
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:48,238
I am already quite late.

298
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,113
Oh no, I already got a warning call.

299
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,655
Grandpa... Bye. Bye. Bye.

300
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,697
Grandma! Bye.

301
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:54,613
Take care.

302
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,447
Nandu, we are done with all the shots that
do not have Balu in them.

303
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,530
We don’t have any work until Balu comes.
What do you want us to do?

304
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,905
Balu...
-You are going easy on Balu.

305
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,780
As a producer, you don’t hesitate to
keep us in check

306
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,238
but you never reprimand Balu at all.

307
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,197
She is not going easy on him.
She is scared of him.

308
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,179
Scared?
Why would I be scared of him?

309
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,637
If he is a hero,
I am a producer.

310
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:20,512
Let him come.

311
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:21,970
Watch how I am going to give him an earful.

312
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,262
Hey.

313
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,727
Why are you guys this relaxed?

314
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:25,060
Oh my god!

315
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,935
Do you know how costly an affair shooting is?

316
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,709
None of you here are responsible enough.

317
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:29,928
Isn’t that right, producer?

318
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,137
Shut it.

319
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,428
You are talking on my behalf
so that you can avoid a scolding from me.

320
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:34,720
What do you think of yourself?

321
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,137
You come and go as you please,
and you do what you like.

322
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,220
You have absolutely no respect for a producer.

323
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:40,970
You are not even dedicated to your work.

324
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:42,595
Listen to me first, please.

325
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,178
What are you going to tell me?!
-See, what happened is...

326
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,178
Don’t you hear that snake charming music
playing in the background?

327
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,553
As soon as he removes his hands,

328
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:55,012
She will say, “Really? Just leave it.”

329
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,553
Look at how softly she says that.

330
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,845
Really?
Just leave it.

331
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,512
Hey guys, let’s shoot.

332
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,137
Your honour.

333
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:03,637
This is my client Bhadram.

334
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:05,137
And that girl is Swati.

335
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,887
They have been in love for the past one year.

336
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:07,720
But now...

337
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:10,137
that girl wants to break up with him
and leave.

338
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:14,428
So, my client has spent 1 lakh 94 thousand on that girl.

339
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:17,178
I request the court to order that girl to
return that money along with interest.

340
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:19,262
Objection, your honour.

341
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:22,428
Just for the sake of his lover, an emperor,
built Taj Mahal to commemorate his love for her.

342
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:23,678
Being born in such a land as this,

343
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:26,387
and asking his lover to return the money
he spent on her,

344
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,345
is as good as going to a restaurant,
eating until one’s tummy hurts...

345
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,762
and complaining that they didn’t enjoy the taste
and so, they won’t pay the bill.

346
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:33,845
Why do you want to break up with him?

347
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,053
He isn’t buying me any of the
things I asked for.

348
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:41,137
If he can’t give her the things,
how can he be her lover, your honour?

349
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,280
He is just focusing on things he didn’t buy.

350
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,072
He hasn’t mentioned the things that he bought
and the money he spent, your honour.

351
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,989
Take a look,
money for the phone recharge

352
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,614
the rent for the hostel room,
ticket to travel to her village...

353
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,780
and her return from there,

354
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,655
shopping at the shopping mall.

355
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:58,280
I am unsure of how long this list runs but she swiped
his card for everything and finally left him out to dry.

356
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,155
So, my lord...

357
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:03,822
as a fellow man, with a kind heart,
please understand my client’s anguish

358
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,947
and I request you to ensure that his money
is returned to him, your honour.

359
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,155
Thank you.

360
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:09,197
Order! Order!

361
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,280
Women's desires are like the layers of an onion.

362
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,822
If one layer is removed,
Another one appears.

363
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,030
It's the same case here as well.

364
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,489
As soon as one desire is fulfilled,
another springs in its place.

365
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:21,655
As an experienced person,
I believe that there is some truth to your arguments.

366
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,530
Therefore, I order the accused to return the money
spent on her by him.

367
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,822
Thank you, your honour.
Lawyer sir.

368
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,530
Let me go.

369
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,780
God bless you my son.

370
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,739
Six months ago, you told me
that you had some work at Mukhteshwaram and left.

371
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:48,947
What is it this time again?

372
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:49,989
I have some work again.

373
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:53,197
You keep telling me that you have work but
you don’t tell me what it is.

374
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,322
Alright, fine.
Do you have a water bottle?

375
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,322
Oh no! I forgot.

376
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,489
I have to remind you of everything.

377
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,239
I don’t know what will happen to you
if I am not around.

378
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,280
Wait here. I will get it for you.

379
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,197
Give me a water bottle.

380
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:09,072
What’s up?

381
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,447
Yeah, I am starting

382
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,530
Okay.

383
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:21,489
Military...?

384
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,864
What’s with this military uniform?

385
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,030
Nothing.

386
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,030
What exactly are you up to these days?

387
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:27,447
These days you are keeping a lot of secrets from me.

388
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:29,155
You are hiding a lot of things.

389
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,197
Just because I have been following you around
since childhood, you have taken me for granted.

390
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,127
You give me some excuse or the another
and convince me.

391
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:42,794
Alright, fine.
Happy journey.

392
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,086
Thank you.

393
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:46,169
I have been asking you to tell me that
for quite a while now.

394
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,002
Couldn’t you say it to me?

395
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:47,877
What is it?

396
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,627
I love you.

397
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,711
Oh dear! Again, with that!

398
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,310
You can ask someone to tell you sorry
and even a thank you...

399
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,185
but you must never ask them to
profess their love for you.

400
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,019
Ok, Bye.

401
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,310
Even if you say or don’t say,

402
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,894
I have already said it.
I am not taking it back.

403
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:01,602
Alright, go on now.

404
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,269
Fine. Drive safe.

405
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,894
Bye.

406
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,560
Hi, dad.
-Hi.

407
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,435
Did dad spill his inner thoughts?

408
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,852
He said something and then
a war erupted in the house.

409
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:16,810
What happened?

410
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,352
If you don’t increase my salary,
I wouldn’t be able to work any longer.

411
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,644
If you can’t work, just quit.

412
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,644
I am already paying you 4000 bucks
and that’s a lot.

413
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,227
I won’t increase it even by a rupee.

414
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,644
<i>In our neighbour’s house, they are paying</i>
<i>6000 bucks for the same amount of work.</i>

415
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,227
<i>If she quits, we have to pay someone</i>
<i>6000 to work for us.</i>

416
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,602
I won’t work for anything less than
6000 bucks, madam.

417
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:34,685
<i>I told you, right?!</i>

418
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,060
Husband, you!

419
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,394
Did I blurt out my inner thought again?

420
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,310
Give me my mask, please.

421
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,810
Enough about him.
-Why are you so late?

422
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,060
I dropped Balu at the bus stop and came home, mummy.

423
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,144
There was heavy traffic.

424
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,269
Anyways, working on a short film with Balu...

425
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,227
and loitering around with no sense of time...

426
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:51,144
I told you number of times that I don’t like it.

427
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:54,769
I told you equal number of times that
I like spending time with Balu.

428
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,394
Oh, there’s nothing else to discuss, right?

429
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,102
Okay. Good night.

430
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,477
Bye, dad. Good night.

431
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:01,227
Good night, daughter.

432
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,352
You can go..
-Ok, Madam.

433
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:07,977
You are responsible for all this.

434
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:10,894
What did I do now?

435
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:14,435
When we were shifting to Hyderabad,
I told you not to bring him along.

436
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:15,352
And yet, you did.

437
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,269
Now, look at what happened.

438
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,727
With each passing day,
Nandu is getting even more attached to Balu.

439
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:19,477
and I don’t see it waning.

440
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,227
Balu is a good guy.
Isn’t that so, Sharada?

441
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,352
Just because I got him here,
you are on my case.

442
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,102
I had resigned the bank job on time, and focused on Real estate
and earned so much all due to his suggestions.

443
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:30,769
It doesn’t matter how much you support him.

444
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,560
I never even liked him living with us when he was young.

445
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,935
How would I be ok with making him my son-in-law?

446
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:39,102
<i>Who wants to know about your likes and dislikes?</i>

447
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,144
<i>They have to like and love each other.</i>

448
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:42,560
Yeah. Yeah.

449
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:44,394
Why would you like it?

450
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:45,560
Of course, you won’t and shouldn’t as well.

451
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,685
Did I spill my inner thoughts?

452
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:51,602
Put it there.

453
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,144
This stupid habit of mine.

454
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:54,060
This is exactly right for you.

455
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,144
Who called me at this time?

456
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,852
Raju, what’s up?

457
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,852
I sent you a photo of a girl who posted on Facebook
Please take a look.

458
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,685
Why is Balu in ‘Thulabharam’?

459
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,269
Who are those beside him?

460
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:14,810
Apparently, they are his grandparents.

461
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,144
How come he has grandparents?

462
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,435
I feel like he is hiding something from us, Nandu.

463
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:25,769
Yeah, he is hiding something.

464
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,727
Anyways, what was the name of the place that
Balu said he was going to?

465
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,519
Mukteshwaram near Kotipalli.

466
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:50,477
Hey, it’s uncle.

467
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,435
Uncle is coming.
-Uncle.

468
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,227
Uncle..?
-How are you?

469
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,060
How are you?

470
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,602
Brother...

471
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:03,394
Are you fine?
-Are you fine, Brother?

472
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:04,810
How are you sister in law?

473
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:06,269
I am fine... what about you?

474
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:06,852
How have been, Mother?

475
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,935
Anyone wants to alight at Kotipalli?

476
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,352
Kotipalli...Kotipalli...

477
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:14,644
Come...

478
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,977
Sir, where is Mukteswaram?
-That side

479
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,935
That side?

480
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,560
How do we get there?
-On a <i>Ballakattu </i>(Pont).

481
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,352
I heard about ‘<i>Jallikatu’</i> but never heard about
<i>Ballakattu</i> (Pont).

482
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,144
You heard about it now, right?
Come along.

483
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,685
How did you load a bicycle on a bike?

484
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:30,019
If necessary, our men would even load an aeroplane.

485
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,435
Why?
Won’t you come because of this?

486
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,227
We are coming.

487
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,644
You look new around here.
-Yes. We are new here.

488
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,227
Oh, this is deep. Is it?

489
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,810
Yup. If you fall into it,
you will drown and die. It’s that deep.

490
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:41,144
Hey, hurry up and come to the fair.
-I will drop these off at home and come.

491
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:42,935
Anyways, you didn’t answer my question.

492
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,519
Fair... We came to watch the fair.

493
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,269
Then, go this way.

494
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,019
That way, huh?
Let’s go.

495
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,185
Will catch up in the fair.

496
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:48,602
You shut it.

497
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,810
If you showed him Balu’s photo,
he would have told you where Balu lived, right?

498
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,477
Yes, of course! He would tell us where Balu lives
and he would in turn tell Balu that we asked about him.

499
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:54,977
You dimwit!

500
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:55,519
Oh?!

501
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,102
We are under secret operation, right?

502
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,977
By knowing secret operation
why would you declare that loudly?

503
00:21:59,102 --> 00:21:59,560
Oh, sorry.

504
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,519
He is just killing me!

505
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,727
Where would we search for him?

506
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,144
If the entire village is at the fair.
Would you search for him in the next village?

507
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:18,158
Blow it.

508
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:20,741
Hey...

509
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,075
That’s Balu.

510
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,116
Let’s go.

511
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:27,116
He lived like a solo hero there
Here, he looks like a family hero.

512
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:28,700
Grandpa, come here.

513
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,342
Do I look like a grandfather to you?!

514
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:32,206
I am not even a father yet.
-Aren’t you?

515
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,813
Why?

516
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:33,790
Because he didn’t get married.

517
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:35,941
That’s alright.
What are you going to achieve getting married?

518
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:36,743
Never mind, brother.

519
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:37,953
I am going to ask you something.
Will you answer?

520
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:39,994
Do you know about that family?

521
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:41,403
Why wouldn’t I know about them?

522
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,528
They are Sundar Master’s sons.

523
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,611
The eldest son is Bhaskar
and those are his wife and children.

524
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,236
The younger one is Suryam.

525
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,445
He works for Indian military.

526
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:48,986
Military?

527
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:50,236
What’s with this confusion?

528
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:55,869
Hello, Nandu.

529
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:57,119
Did you find Balu?

530
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,661
Yes, we did
but his name is not Balu here.

531
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:00,328
It’s Surya.

532
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:01,661
Surya?

533
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,887
And on top of that, he is rumoured to be
working in the armed forces.

534
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:06,221
Balu? In the armed forces?

535
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:07,554
What does that mean?

536
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,596
If you put the phone down,
we will figure out what that is and report it to you.

537
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,262
Come one, come all.

538
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,262
All the young men who are here to
participate in the fair.

539
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:15,679
This is a fantastic opportunity for you.

540
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:18,012
Participate in the wrestling match.

541
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:22,512
And win a Rs. 10,000 cash prize along with surprise.

542
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:23,762
Uncle...
-What is it, dear?

543
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:25,221
Go on participate and win.

544
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:26,971
You mean in that wrestling match?

545
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,971
Yes, uncle. You only.
Dad doesn’t fight anyone.

546
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:33,971
But you are in the military.
You can easily win.

547
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:35,762
What’s with all this fuss?!

548
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:37,762
There will be no talk of fighting or anything.
Let’s go home.

549
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:38,721
You stay quiet.

550
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,637
If my brother participates,
he will certainly win.

551
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,762
Right... Uncle will surely win.

552
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,929
We get Rs. 10,000 cash prize
if you win in this competition.

553
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,179
Go, uncle.
Hit them

554
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,179
Are you ready to fight?

555
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:11,887
Whoever wins between the either of you,
should win against him.

556
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,804
And after that match,
the winner must wrestle against that guy.

557
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,637
Then only you will get Rs.10,000 prize money.

558
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:18,554
Are you ready?

559
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:20,012
You mean to say...

560
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:24,971
we have to fight this guy,
that guy and then finally that guy, right?

561
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:25,887
Goodness!

562
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:28,262
This type of wrestling doesn't suite me.

563
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,679
Ask all of them come together.

564
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,387
Let’s see.

565
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:35,554
Click photos.

566
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:37,554
Uncle...

567
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:38,471
Are you happy?

568
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:39,971
Come... come...

569
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,471
You hit them very well.

570
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,429
Congratulations, young man.
-Thank you, sir.

571
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:47,054
Here, Prize money for you.

572
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,221
Thank you, uncle.
-Thank you, uncle.

573
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,679
You guys told me that there was a special surprise.

574
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:52,971
Oh...! It’s Manjuvani.

575
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:59,304
♫ Manjuvani, with you it’s a public performance. ♫

576
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:07,346
♫ You have written my heart’s desire. ♫

577
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:18,637
♫ The fair, the fair ♫

578
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:22,346
♫ when I come down here, it’s a spectacle. ♫
It’s a festival of youth here. ♫

579
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:25,346
♫ Its all blossoms and blossoms
♫ It’s a blossom of gold here. ♫

580
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,929
♫ Look at the lightening and spark you have lit in me. ♫

581
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,721
♫ The people of the village and
the youth here are rushing here♫

582
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,929
♫ We know what the real festival is. ♫

583
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:35,929
♫ Only after we pass the trail by the fire, ♫

584
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,471
♫ The truth will be out as to what the real gold is. ♫

585
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:43,012
♫ It’s a piece of sugar cane beside you, ♫
♫ Take a naughty bite out of it and go. ♫

586
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:48,304
♫ 25 acres of land (your wealth), tie it around my waist♫

587
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:54,554
♫ Just once, touch me, ♫
♫ You would say that Jyothi Lakshmi has come again. ♫

588
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:59,929
♫ If you want, you can kiss me. ♫
♫ And bestow your wealth on me. ♫

589
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:05,221
♫ Just once, touch me, ♫
♫ You would say that Jyothi Lakshmi has come again. ♫

590
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:10,471
♫ If you want, you can kiss me. ♫
♫ And bestow your wealth on me. ♫

591
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:11,887
♫ The fair, the fair ♫

592
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:15,596
♫ when I come down here, it’s a spectacle. ♫
It’s a festival of youth here. ♫

593
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:18,596
♫ Its all blossoms and blossoms
♫ It’s a blossom of gold here. ♫

594
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,179
♫ Look at the lightening and spark you have lit in me. ♫

595
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,387
♫ There are many people coming here ♫
♫ To participate in the wrestling match. ♫

596
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:48,221
♫ But they can’t even wrestle with the tip of my saree. ♫

597
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:50,804
♫ The intelligent biggies and the gully boys♫

598
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:53,429
♫ Are unable to be worthy of my kisses. ♫

599
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:58,637
♫ If a macho guy is persistent, ♫
♫ Your blouse is going to be shredded to pieces. ♫

600
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,929
♫ If you are as virile as that crazy cock in cock fights, ♫
♫ Show me how sharp your thing is. ♫

601
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:09,221
♫ Just once, touch me, ♫
♫ You would say that Jyothi Lakshmi has come again. ♫

602
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:14,512
♫ If you want, you can kiss me. ♫
♫ And bestow your wealth on me. ♫

603
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:45,554
♫ The brilliant Godavari surrounds us♫
♫ Is your energy greater than hers? ♫

604
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:50,804
♫ If we beat the drums, it becomes energised ♫
♫ Does your tabala sound better than that? ♫

605
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:55,971
♫ All the beauty of Godavari stay within the banks♫
♫ And all that playfulness with me has no limits. ♫

606
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,721
♫ Don’t touch the drums, ♫
♫ Touch my lips, ♫

607
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:01,304
♫ I am the fire that quickens you
and hurries you up♫.

608
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:06,596
♫ Just once, touch me, ♫
♫ You would say that Jyothi Lakshmi has come again. ♫

609
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,679
♫ You are just a fake Lakshmi. ♫
♫ I don’t think we are matched well. ♫

610
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,012
♫ Don’t touch me. ♫

611
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:17,346
♫ Just once, touch me, ♫
♫ You would say that Jyothi Lakshmi has come again. ♫

612
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:21,346
♫ You are just a fake Lakshmi. ♫
♫ I don’t think we are matched well. ♫

613
00:29:21,346 --> 00:29:22,679
♫ Don’t touch me. ♫

614
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:26,429
Uncle.

615
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:29,471
I am going to get some money tomorrow.
Do you want me to buy something for you?

616
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:30,679
Do you get money...?

617
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:31,637
How?

618
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,512
Tomorrow is Rakhi festival.

619
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,262
If I tie the Rakhi,
He will give money.

620
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,137
Oh, yes! Tomorrow is Rakhi, right?!

621
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:41,679
Yes, uncle.
I have my sister so she will tie me Rakhi.

622
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:44,637
But who is going to tie Rakhi
to you and my father?

623
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:50,471
When I called you,
you said you were out of station.

624
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,679
I thought I might miss you this time.

625
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,804
Missing out on you tying a Rakhi?

626
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,096
There is absolutely no chance of that.

627
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:57,471
Have it.

628
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,012
This is for you.

629
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,012
No, brother. I don't want it.

630
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:04,929
When your elder brother gives you something
for the festival, you shouldn't refuse it.

631
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:05,846
Alright.
-Okay.

632
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,679
I shall get going then.

633
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:08,471
When will you come again?
-I will see you tomorrow.

634
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,012
Come.

635
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:20,679
Hey... let's go.

636
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:26,846
Who are you people?

637
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:27,846
Move aside.

638
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,096
What is all this?

639
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:31,679
Who are you?

640
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,012
What’s going on between
you and our Balu?

641
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,429
Who exactly are you people?
-We are Balu’s friends.

642
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,679
Our friend is a real good guy.

643
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,346
If you are under the impression that you
can trap him and do something to him,

644
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:39,971
we are there for him.

645
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,179
And there is Nandini who has been waiting
for him for a long time.

646
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:45,346
If you want friends, try face book
and if you want followers, try Instagram.

647
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:48,012
Harassing our friend?
That isn’t good behaviour.

648
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,846
What? Are you guys insane?

649
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:52,096
Do you think that is the only relationship
between a man and a woman?

650
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,054
Don’t you think there is an alternative explanation?

651
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,262
What else can there be?
The only thing we know about is this.

652
00:30:55,262 --> 00:30:56,971
He is my brother... Rishi.

653
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:57,762
Rishi?

654
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:58,721
Rishi?

655
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:00,596
Yes... That is what that girl told us.

656
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:01,971
He becomes Shiva with grandfather.

657
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,846
He is Surya in the village.
He becomes Rishi with this girl.

658
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,637
He has been using different names and
maintaining different relationships at different places.

659
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:07,387
Let him get here.

660
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:11,179
Apart from acting in short films,
I am going to ask him why is he acting in real life too!

661
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:12,846
I am back, grandpa.
I will meet you in the evening.

662
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:13,346
Bye.

663
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:15,971
Hey, guys.

664
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:18,387
Could you order me a cup of coffee?

665
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,471
Buddy, get Shiva a cup of coffee.

666
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:24,846
Are you ok with just a coffee or
do you want snacks as well, Surya?

667
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,054
But you shouldn’t have any snacks
when you have your coffee.

668
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,554
Am I right, Rishi?

669
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:32,721
Rishi...

670
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:33,637
Yes.

671
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,637
From now on,
with what name would you like us to call you, Hero?

672
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:36,429
Shiva...

673
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:37,012
Rishi...

674
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,221
Surya... Balu...

675
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:38,971
I got it.

676
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:47,387
I understood that you are now
in on the secret that I have been hiding from you.

677
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:48,387
No, you didn’t let us in on the secret.

678
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,304
We followed you from Mukteswaram
and figured stuff out.

679
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:53,262
So, you have been on detective duty, is it?

680
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,721
What is all this, hero?

681
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:55,971
What is with all these names of yours?

682
00:31:55,971 --> 00:31:57,096
And who are these relatives of yours?

683
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,971
Am I the only one calling them relatives?
They are the ones who treat me as their relative.

684
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:02,512
These days, people let go of families
for the sake of money.

685
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,387
Are you saying that there are people
who voluntarily maintain such kinship?

686
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:05,637
Why shouldn’t we?

687
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:09,429
When we lack something in our house,
We will get it from someone.

688
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,929
In the same manner,
we lack happiness in our house.

689
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:15,096
We lack love.

690
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:19,012
We have no one to call us with affection.

691
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:25,846
That is the reason why
we have brought him to us as our grandson.

692
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:29,137
At the same time,
It’s not that we have no grandson of our own.

693
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,221
We do have one.

694
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:31,596
He is in America.

695
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:33,887
He is our one and only grandson.

696
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:39,679
My son and daughter died in a car accident.
We went there to keep him company.

697
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:41,221
We were there for 6 months.

698
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,304
But, in the 6 months that we were there, We knew that
we were no different from the objects in that house.

699
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,512
Thing feels no need to wish someone or share love with someone.
That is the reason why they just exist.

700
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,596
But we couldn't live like that.
That's why we came back to India.

701
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:00,637
One day, my husband asked me,

702
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,304
“Who are we living for?”

703
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:04,971
“Why are we alive?”

704
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,179
“We have no one to call us affectionately,”

705
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,887
“And no one to sit with us and
spend time with us out of interest.”

706
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:13,221
“There was no one like that.”

707
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:15,846
“What is the point of living?”

708
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:20,221
“We have already seen everything there is to life.”
“Why do we keep waiting for death?”

709
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,346
“Why don’t we go to it?”
is what he asked me.

710
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:35,387
We told you the reason why we wanted to die.

711
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:38,512
He gave us the reason as to why
we should stay alive.

712
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:41,637
He asked us if all we wanted was
our grandson.

713
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,804
He said that he will show us all the love that
a grandson bestows on us.

714
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:48,221
He said that from now on,
he would be our grandson.

715
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:53,971
That’s alright.

716
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:57,012
They are all from Hyderabad,
and by some stroke of fate, have connected with you.

717
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:59,762
But, how did you get close
to that family in Mukteswaram?

718
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:00,846
We didn’t meet him.

719
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:03,054
The lord above has connected us.

720
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:06,429
My husband loves his brother a lot.

721
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,596
Surya used to work in the army.

722
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,512
He used to come home every 6 months.

723
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:13,762
Once, when he came home...

724
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,429
they went out on the bike together.

725
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,512
They got into a huge accident

726
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,637
Surya died on the spot.

727
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:23,012
He had a serious head injury.

728
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:24,429
When we took him to the hospital...

729
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,179
They told us that his brain was damaged.

730
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,221
My husband was unable to process the
death of his brother, Surya.

731
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:36,804
Whenever he met someone in Surya’s age group,
he would go to them and hug them.

732
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:38,346
Some were irritated.

733
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,929
And few others scolded him severely.

734
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:43,359
We took him to Hyderabad,
to consult with the doctors here.

735
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,762
There was a shooting around that neighbourhood.
-Yeah producer... we will pack up in ten minutes.

736
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:47,554
Brother....

737
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:48,679
Brother....

738
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:49,929
Brother...
-Husband...Please wait.

739
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,054
We will meet in the next location.

740
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:53,554
How are you?
When did you come?

741
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:55,346
It’s been so long since I saw you.

742
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:57,012
Husband.

743
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:00,596
It’s been so long.

744
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,471
Brother, how have you been?

745
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,762
How have you been?

746
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:08,846
I am fine, brother.

747
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:10,054
How long has it been since I saw you?!

748
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:12,512
Everyone saw his pain through their eyes.

749
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,971
But he was the only one who saw it
with his heart.

750
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,179
That is the reason why I asked him.

751
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,512
If he could come to our house every 6 months
as our Surya.

752
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:24,012
He happily agreed to it.

753
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:26,012
Since then, he has been visiting us regularly.

754
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,387
How did you become Meghana’s brother?

755
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:33,762
It’s because my brother stopped caring for me.

756
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,762
Before my brother got married,
we got along really well.

757
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:40,929
But after he got married, I don’t know why...
My sister-in-law didn’t like me.

758
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,554
He asked me if I could be in a hostel for a while,

759
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:46,387
So that he could take some time to convince
my sister-in-law before he could take me home.

760
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:49,596
In the beginning, when I am in hostel,
he used to call me every day.

761
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,262
He visited me once every week.

762
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,929
After that, he began to call me once a week.

763
00:35:55,054 --> 00:35:56,512
He visited me once a month.

764
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,762
Now, I don’t know when he would come.

765
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:01,762
And I don’t even know when he would call me.

766
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:06,471
But... during that phase,
on the day of Holi...

767
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:01,012
Hey, you.
Why are you fighting with us for that girl?

768
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,471
How are you related to her?

769
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:03,387
She is my sister.

770
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,262
That is all well and good but...

771
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:14,929
Why would you spend that kind of time
with strangers when their own kin don’t?

772
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:23,554
I know how it feels when your kin
becomes distant.

773
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:25,221
After my parents died...

774
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:32,721
I thought I had a lot of relatives
to support me and to give me courage.

775
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:39,971
Just because that kid lost his parents and
you thought that you could get that kid home.

776
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,846
If you do that, there will be no one left to
feel sorry for my children.

777
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:43,679
Okay?

778
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,596
We can get him home for a week or so
but if we take him with us now,

779
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,804
we have to bear the burden of his education.

780
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:52,179
Why are you so bothered?

781
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:55,429
He has relatives from the maternal side.
Someone from that side will take him in.

782
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,721
Balu... you have to study well.

783
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:02,429
We would have taken you with us but
we are going to Kasi.

784
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,637
When we come back,
we will take you with us.

785
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:08,387
Just because you lost your parents,
don’t think that you lost us.

786
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:12,096
You can come to our home anytime
and spend two to three days happily.

787
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:12,929
Alright, dear?

788
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,512
Here, take this money.
Keep them with you for expenses.

789
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,387
Aunt, Have another piece of sweet.

790
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,721
No... no! I have diabetes.

791
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:26,971
Just pop a pill then.

792
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,637
Naughty fellow!

793
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:33,596
He is a small kid... Give him 100 rupees.
He will buy something for himself.

794
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:34,137
Okay

795
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,679
Couldn’t you come for the summer holidays?

796
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,804
Let’s see.
If time permits, we will surely come.

797
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,221
Even though I had lots of relatives.

798
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:06,887
I remained as someone without any kin.

799
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,679
Even though all my relatives left me and went.

800
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:14,721
I couldn’t forget the love and affection
I experienced when I had relatives.

801
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:17,721
May be that is the reason why...

802
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:20,762
when they told me what they were missing
in their lives...

803
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:22,471
I bonded with them.

804
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:26,929
That is the reason I thought about this...

805
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:30,346
and wanted to discuss with you all, the proposal
to start a supplier service.

806
00:39:30,596 --> 00:39:31,596
Suppliers service?

807
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:32,512
What suppliers?

808
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,762
Emotion suppliers.

809
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:35,846
Emotion suppliers?

810
00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:36,971
What is that?
-I’ll tell you.

811
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:40,387
We have son and daughter, grandson, granddaughter,
elder sister, younger sister, elder brother, younger brother.

812
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,221
Any sort of relationship that people require,
will be available.

813
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:44,637
We will supply the emotion that people
require, perfectly.

814
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:46,221
What are you talking about Balu?

815
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:49,346
If you love having relatives that much,
call up your relatives once again.

816
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,346
What is with this Emotion suppliers?

817
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,596
When I didn’t want people,
I didn’t abandon them.

818
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:56,429
And when people abandoned me,
I didn’t abandon them either.

819
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:58,887
A lot of people nowadays,
don’t care about their own families.

820
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:00,596
Would they want people for
that very purpose?

821
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:02,096
This is not for everyone, buddy.

822
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:05,596
This is for those who have a lot of people around
and yet feel lonely.

823
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:10,512
Those who have no one to wish them,
to speak to them with affection...

824
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,429
and no one to wait for them
and or worry about them.

825
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:13,346
Alright, fine.

826
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:17,762
But do you think they will accept
something new?

827
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,137
Fifteen years ago,

828
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:24,387
people didn’t understand the concept
of buying water.

829
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:27,637
But now, there is no house
that doesn’t purchase water.

830
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,346
Yes.

831
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,596
When Swagruha Foods was first established...

832
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,762
people thought that it was strange to buy
foods that we prepared for festivals.

833
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:36,929
But now, If there is a festival...

834
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:41,429
right from Tamarind rice to other kinds of eatables,
they are purchasing it from the stores.

835
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,929
Anyways, we are all actors in a short film.

836
00:40:45,346 --> 00:40:46,471
Let’s act in real life.

837
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:47,387
Balu, I have a doubt.

838
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,137
Both the parties know that they are not real kin.

839
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:51,762
How can be bond with that knowledge?

840
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:53,054
You watch a lot of movies, right?

841
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:53,721
Yes.

842
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:57,012
We are aware that we are watching a movie.

843
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,471
We also know that it’s not real.

844
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:01,054
But when those characters crack a joke,
why do you laugh?

845
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:03,137
When they make you cry,
why do you cry?

846
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:05,554
Why are you bonding with
every emotion they evoke?

847
00:41:06,054 --> 00:41:07,637
Because we get involved in the movie.

848
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,596
Even though we know that it’s not real,
when we get involved in it, we begin to feel.

849
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,846
If we are able to get them that involved,
they will feel the same way.

850
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:16,721
I am not so sure buddy.

851
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:19,929
Establishing Kinship when we are not related by blood.
I think it’s a challenge.

852
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:23,971
In our friend’s circle, we call some
of our buddies as brother or brother-in-law.

853
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:27,846
Women folk in the house call the
neighbourhood ladies either sister or sister-in-law.

854
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,304
Does that mean they are all related?

855
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,346
No, of course not.

856
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:32,012
But...

857
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:37,012
Instead of a name, if you call them with
the kinship terminology, that bond is special.

858
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,137
We are going to supply that kind of emotion.

859
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:43,554
So, producer? Shall we start?

860
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:45,304
Whatever you say, hero?

861
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:47,262
Anyways, what are we going to name this idea?

862
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:50,929
“All is well” emotion suppliers.

863
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,812
If someone gets back the love that he once lost,
He is good fellow.

864
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:12,270
But If he returns the love that he lost
to people in similar circumstances...

865
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,229
he is a great fellow.

866
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:15,229
You are a great person.

867
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,020
“All is well” Emotion suppliers.

868
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:25,187
If you need a relative to share your emotions,
Please call us at 94754 94754.

869
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,437
If you are sad that your son is distant with you,
Then press one.

870
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Our boy will come to your house as your son.
He would give you what you desire.

871
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:35,770
Hi, is your sister in the hostel?
Are you missing her and her naughtiness?

872
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,729
Press two.

873
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:38,770
Your naughty sister will be in your house.

874
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:41,395
If you want a granddaughter, then press three.

875
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,354
If you want a grandson,
Press four.

876
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,979
Any relation, any emotion.

877
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,354
Just give us a call.

878
00:42:46,354 --> 00:42:47,604
You are the ones who desire a bond.

879
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:48,979
We are the ones who will provide you
with affection.

882
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:57,568
Emotional suppliers?

883
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,735
Apparently, this website provides us with relatives.

884
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:03,360
If we want any relation,
They will send that relatives to our house.

885
00:43:03,485 --> 00:43:06,318
You mean to say, when we call a company,
they send us drivers and housemaid.

886
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,402
These people are going to send us relatives?

887
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:08,610
This looks different.

888
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,527
What is this fake relatives, Mom?

889
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,735
While we are already fed up with our own relatives.

890
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:15,110
Why? What’s wrong?

891
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,493
When people are unable to conceive, they are able
to conceive through surrogacy and give birth, right?

892
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:25,277
How come there isn’t even a single person?

893
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,152
Do you think we opened a wine shop
that they would drop in easily?

894
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:29,735
They will come for sure.
-Don’t worry.

895
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,193
Hi, uncle.

896
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:37,527
What can we do for you?

897
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:38,693
My name is Siva Rao.

898
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,652
My son lives in Australia.

899
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,818
I live here alone.

900
00:43:44,943 --> 00:43:46,860
So...
-You want a son, right?

901
00:43:47,777 --> 00:43:51,860
So, your son left you here all alone
and lives there and is enjoying his life...

902
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:54,152
Who told you that my son doesn’t care for me?

903
00:43:55,068 --> 00:43:57,068
My son does a good job of looking after me.

904
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,777
He bought me a flat to live in.

905
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:03,610
He had the foresight to understand that if I ever needed to travel,
I would get uncomfortable travelling in buses and autos

906
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:05,485
and so,
he bought me a car.

907
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:06,610
Not just that.

908
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:12,402
The first of every month,
he deposits money in my account for my expenses.

909
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:17,818
He gave me everything I could ever need...

910
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:20,152
but somehow, I am still lonely.

911
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,652
If I want to talk to someone,
everyone is busy.

912
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:27,318
That is the reason why...
Sir, if you give me a son,

913
00:44:27,818 --> 00:44:32,027
all the things that I want to tell my son,
I will tell him.

914
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,277
Okay, uncle
Please come this way.

915
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,610
What is your son’s name?
-Aditya.

916
00:44:36,652 --> 00:44:37,360
Nice name.

917
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:39,360
Bhadram!

918
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:43,777
This is your Aditya.

919
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:47,193
Uncle, the way you want to behave with your son,

920
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:50,777
the things that you want to share with your son,
you can do all of that with him.

921
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:52,527
Sudha, It's urgent.

922
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:53,860
What is it? Thumb line?

923
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,402
For that doctor video?
-Yes.

924
00:44:57,443 --> 00:45:00,235
Aunty cried her Lungs out for what the doctor did.

925
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:01,485
Oh, brilliant.

926
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:02,485
Cried her lungs out?

927
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:03,693
What did the doctor do?

928
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:05,568
He gave her an injection.
For her Cold.

929
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:07,527
Would someone put a thumbnail such as this for that video?

930
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:08,902
We should put it exactly like this.

931
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:12,943
Anyways, how to manage these things,
who would know this better than me?

932
00:45:15,443 --> 00:45:17,693
Hello!
All is well Emotional suppliers.

933
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:21,485
You mentioned in your website that
you would be able to send any kind of relative.

934
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,318
Yes, madam.

935
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,235
Could you please send us a grandmother
who is approximately 60 years old?

936
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:28,985
Grandmother?
-Yeah.

937
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:31,985
My daughter is very close to her grandmother.

938
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,527
My mother passed away last month.

939
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,068
And my daughter is very depressed.

940
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,193
So, If you could send me someone in that age,
-Someone of that age....?

941
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:43,943
Okay, madam.

942
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:45,485
Please message me your address.

943
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:46,735
A grandmother will greet you at your house tomorrow.

944
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,443
Thank you.

945
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,402
Hero, where will you get the grandmother from?

946
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:55,318
Because we are young, we can manage
with the characters of sons and daughters.

947
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:56,485
Where do we get grandfathers and grandmothers from?

948
00:45:56,777 --> 00:46:00,652
We will get our make-up artist Ramu
and ask him to dress anyone of us as an old person.

949
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:03,735
If we put on make-up, we might look like an old person
but we wouldn’t be able to portray the emotions of an old person.

950
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,402
Well then, how did you make that promise?

951
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,652
Mother...

952
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,693
Who are you people?

953
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,360
You don’t know us but
we came to meet with you on some work.

954
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:28,235
My children left me here because they
find me useless.

955
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,277
What work would you have with me?

956
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:35,360
At this age, wouldn’t you have that desire
to play with a grandson or a granddaughter, right?

957
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:36,818
Of course, I do.

958
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,402
Why wouldn’t I?

959
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:42,735
Everyone here has that wish.

960
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,985
But one must also have luck.

961
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:49,527
We might not be able to give you the great fortune
of playing with your own grandchild but..

962
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:53,318
we can give you the opportunity of playing
with a grandchild of that age.

963
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:55,360
I didn't get you.

964
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:58,277
Trust me.

965
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,235
Thank you very much, sir.

966
00:47:03,235 --> 00:47:05,610
After a long time, I have seen my daughter happy.

967
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,735
This happiness will stay with you forever.

982
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:25,485

-Sudha... Sudha?

995
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,735
The video is done.
Give me a good slogan for thumbnail.

996
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,235
What’s with this harassment?

997
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,485
It looks like you have no problem giving birth
to a child but have a problem with naming him.

998
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:53,068
You record videos
and yet, you cannot name them.

999
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:54,568
Alright, fine.
I’ll tell you, note it down.

1000
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:54,943
Tell me.

1001
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,735
"The girl is in tears at what the officer did."

1002
00:49:58,985 --> 00:50:00,068
Oh, superb!

1003
00:50:00,235 --> 00:50:01,902
What did the officer do?

1004
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:03,193
He sanctioned the loan.

1005
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:03,652
Disgusting!

1006
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:05,610
He did such a good thing.
why would you give it such a weird name?

1007
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:07,360
People will watch it only if
they are written this way.

1008
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,152
This is the trend.

1009
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:08,777
Follow it.

1010
00:50:15,902 --> 00:50:16,527
What can we help you with?

1011
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:19,318
So, as emotion suppliers, do you guys cater to
all types of relationships?

1012
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,027
We do.

1013
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:21,402
Who do you want?
-Son?

1014
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:23,902
Brother?
-Sister? -Father?

1015
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:26,318
Who?
-I want a wife.

1016
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,277
Wife?

1017
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:28,235
Wife?

1018
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,027
Wife?

1019
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:30,985
Wife?

1020
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:33,277
Why? Is wife not a relation?

1021
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,027
Doesn’t she have emotions?

1022
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:36,152
Don’t you have a wife of your own?

1023
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:37,068
I do.

1024
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,485
But she isn’t here.

1025
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:39,985
She went to her mother’s house.

1026
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:43,235
Since she isn’t here,
my body is totally...

1027
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:45,818
If that’s the case,
couldn’t you call her and ask her to come?

1028
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:46,360
Who are you?

1029
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,193
I am an employee here.

1030
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:47,777
Come here...

1031
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:48,443
Please tell me.

1032
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:52,568
The wife who goes to her mother’s place,
and the friend who drunkard...

1033
00:50:52,777 --> 00:50:53,527
shouldn’t be called home.

1034
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:55,277
Call her, then you will know.

1035
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:55,943
No... I won't.

1036
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:57,235
Give us your address before you leave.

1037
00:50:57,943 --> 00:50:58,527
Okay.

1038
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:09,818
I am coming.

1039
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:11,652
Hi.

1040
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:13,777
Welcome.

1041
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:14,818
Please come in.

1042
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:15,277
Thank you.

1043
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,860
Please come in. Please come in.

1044
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:19,902
No one is looking, right.

1045
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,110
Oh, my goodness, this smells great.

1046
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:35,527
It tastes great as well.
-Is that so?

1047
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,902
You are right.
This tastes amazing!

1048
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:44,277
He has got the temper.

1049
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:45,818
My favourite song.

1050
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:47,902
Let's dance...?

1051
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:48,568
Me?

1052
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,527
You dance with your wife in the same manner?
-No, no. No. She only fights.

1053
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:56,110
[Song Playing on the TV from the movie Temper]

1054
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,735
Who dare disturb me now?

1055
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:20,068
Who the hell...?

1056
00:52:25,693 --> 00:52:26,568
Who is she?

1057
00:52:27,402 --> 00:52:29,235
I am his wife as well.

1058
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:32,068
But the difference is that you are permanent
and I am a temporary one.

1059
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,360
Listen! Don't hit me.

1060
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:39,610
Just because I wasn’t in town,
you wanted another wife, is it?

1061
00:52:39,735 --> 00:52:41,235
Don't hit me.
-Am I not enough for you?!

1062
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:42,985
Are you that much of a man?!
-Don’t hit me. You are going to kill me.

1063
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:44,818
How come you here suddenly anyways?

1064
00:52:45,527 --> 00:52:46,443
I didn’t come on my own.

1065
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:48,277
He called me and asked me to get here.

1066
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:55,610
What is this sir?

1067
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,068
You send me the fish and
send the net as well.

1068
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:00,193
Sir, this is unfair.

1069
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:03,943
Looking at other women when your wife
is not in town. Is that fair?

1070
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:09,152
We established this Emotion Suppliers ventures, so that we will be
able to help people who genuinely need a relationship.

1071
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:11,943
Not for someone like you with dirty thoughts.

1072
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:15,943
I could have told you this right there.

1073
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:21,402
Even if we deny you, there is a high likelihood
that you would take this elsewhere.

1074
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:23,360
Let’s go, Manasa.

1075
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:27,610
One more thing.

1076
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:30,610
You came asking for someone to portray
the emotions of a wife.

1077
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:33,027
Imagine if she does the same and asks for
a husband?

1078
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:38,277
Just remember this dialogue
and the emotion,

1079
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:40,693
and permanently fix it there.

1080
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:43,027
Only then will it never make you
commit this mistake again.

1081
00:53:43,777 --> 00:53:44,610
I am sorry.

1082
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:53,110
Hi Nandu, how are you?

1083
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:55,235
I am excellent.
How are you?

1084
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,193
I am fine.
Wait, your brother-in-law wants to talk to you.

1085
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,193
Hey, hi

1086
00:53:59,193 --> 00:53:59,652
Hi...

1087
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:02,068
Shirisha told me about your concept.
It’s very nice.

1088
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:03,402
Thank you.

1089
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:07,443
So the thing is when people invite you to their homes,
You go to them portraying the relationship that they want.

1090
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:08,735
Yes, that is true brother-in-law.

1091
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:09,235
Ok.

1092
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:12,443
Well, we want Nandini to come in as our
youngest daughter-in-law.

1093
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,277
Okay, fine.

1094
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,443
I will speak to you later.

1095
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:18,277
Why did she cut the call?

1096
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,402
Of course, she would cut it.

1097
00:54:19,402 --> 00:54:21,193
Why would she continue a topic
that she doesn’t like?

1098
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:23,027
My brother keeps on broaching
the topic of his wedding.

1099
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,693
He likes Nandini, right?

1100
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:25,902
Don’t I know that?

1101
00:54:26,527 --> 00:54:29,027
I am going to talk to mom and
figure out a way to convince her.

1102
00:54:29,027 --> 00:54:29,735
Leave that to me.

1103
00:54:29,735 --> 00:54:30,235
Ok.

1104
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,235
My name is Gayatri.

1105
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,277
My husband’s name is Rama Sharma.

1106
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:45,027
We live in Vadapalli that is
close to Kovuru.

1107
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:46,402
We have a son.

1108
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,693
His name is Acharya.

1109
00:54:49,235 --> 00:54:50,860
My husband loves our son very much.

1110
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:56,068
When Acharya was 7 years old,
he got lost in Godavari Pushkaralu.

1111
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:00,360
We searched everywhere for him
and tried everything possible.

1112
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:08,110
Even now, my husband goes to the banks of that river
and waits for him to return.

1113
00:55:08,152 --> 00:55:11,985
When Acharya was young,
he loved getting on the bikes of our neighbour.

1114
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:17,652
So, my husband bought a scooter
and took my son on rides every morning and evening.

1115
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:24,860
After we lost Acharya, My husband suffered intense grief
and hasn’t touched the scooter up until now.

1116
00:55:27,777 --> 00:55:34,068
Looking at his plight and efforts from past twenty years,
Perhaps the god himself has taken pity.

1117
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:37,527
And so, he was called to join god.

1118
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:42,610
He has cancer.

1119
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:45,777
He cannot live for more than a month.

1120
00:55:46,152 --> 00:55:51,277
So, for this entire month,
I want him to be happy and smile a lot.

1121
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:58,110
If he has to be happy,
our long-lost son must come back to us.

1122
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,652
That is the reason why,
I want a son.

1123
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:06,568
But my husband shouldn’t know that
the person you sent was not our own son.

1124
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,777
Can I find such sort of a son here?

1125
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,152
Certainly, aunty.

1126
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:15,193
You will find the son that you wished for.
-Acharya.

1127
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:16,860
Yes, exactly.
Acharya.

1128
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:20,193
Acharya...

1129
00:56:21,568 --> 00:56:24,360
your mom has come for you.
Don’t you recognise her?

1130
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:38,235
Mother...

1131
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:43,235
If my son were alive,
maybe he would look like this.

1132
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,318
You look exactly like our Acharya.

1133
00:56:48,527 --> 00:56:51,360
What do you mean I look like Acharya?
I am Acharya.

1134
00:56:54,235 --> 00:56:57,568
This has all the details of our Acharya
since childhood.

1135
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:02,193
I hope that my husband doesn’t get suspicious.

1136
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:04,693
I will manage in such a way that
it doesn’t rouse his suspicions.

1137
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,027
Just prepare uncle.

1138
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,360
Tomorrow, his son is going to come
with much fan fair.

1139
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:10,193
Okay.

1140
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:22,693
Prasad, what’s with all these preparations?
Is there some sort of fete?

1141
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:26,152
Remember, Rama Sharma’s boy who got lost?

1142
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,152
Apparently, he returned.

1143
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,235
Oh, that is good news.
For all the good deeds he performed,

1144
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:30,318
For all the good deeds he performed,
I am glad he is at the receiving end of it.

1145
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:30,943
Yes. yes.

1146
00:57:30,943 --> 00:57:31,610
Hey, producer!

1147
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:33,402
Hey, producer!

1148
00:57:33,485 --> 00:57:34,860
What’s up, hero?
-Come here.

1149
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:37,818
Doesn’t all this look a little too much?

1150
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
A bridge groom rides with much fanfare.

1151
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,818
Now, imagine what would it be like for a boy
who was lost years ago?

1152
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:44,152
This is to be expected.

1153
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:46,068
I just got a wonderful idea.
-What is that?

1154
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:48,527
If a son receives this kind of welcome.

1155
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:49,902
Imagine how it would be if he arrives with
a daughter-in-law!

1156
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:52,568
They want a son!

1157
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:54,652
They want a son,
I want you.

1158
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:56,860
Don’t you think this is a very good offer for them?

1159
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,693
They get a daughter-in-law free with their son.
Isn’t that great.

1160
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:00,735
Have you gone mad?

1161
00:58:00,735 --> 00:58:01,318
Yes, I am mad.

1162
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,652
I am mad about my hero.

1163
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,277
I asked you to tell me that you love me.
But you don’t.

1164
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,152
So, let me get satisfied at least like this.

1165
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:08,402
Hey, my spectacles!

1166
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:18,818
Hello, aunty.

1167
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:21,777
How are you, mother?

1168
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:23,985
Bless me as well.

1169
00:58:25,027 --> 00:58:25,693
Your daughter-in-law.

1170
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,402
Daughter-in-law?

1171
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:30,235
Don't be so surprised aunty.
It was my idea.

1172
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:34,152
Where is dad?

1173
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,193
There. He just came in.

1174
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:02,735
Father...

1175
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:04,568
Acharya...

1176
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:12,902
Acharya...

1177
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:15,068
Acharya...

1178
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,777
A lot of people in the village said that they saw our lost boy.

1179
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,318
He looks exactly like you.

1180
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:33,235
They said they saw someone here who looks like him.

1181
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:36,152
And so, we went to those villages and looked for you.

1182
00:59:36,735 --> 00:59:37,568
We nourished hopes

1183
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:40,277
and then, I began to compromise.

1184
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,860
I stopped going to those villages and searching for you.

1185
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:46,693
But, god in the form of your mother
brought you home to me.

1186
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:53,110
Well, who can recognise their sons
better than their mothers?

1187
00:59:55,998 --> 00:59:56,665
Come on, father.

1188
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:57,540
Where?

1189
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:58,665
I will tell you.
Please come.

1190
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:01,748
Look at that.

1191
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:06,040
This is the scooter you bought for me
when I was young.

1192
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:07,463
I am back now, right.

1193
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:09,172
Will you take me out?

1194
01:00:20,188 --> 01:00:24,271
♫ Who knows? Who knows? ♫
♫ The kind of pain hidden in their hearts. ♫

1195
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,553
♫ Let’s share their pain a bit at least. ♫

1196
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,670
Mr. Rama Murthy, did you see my son?
He just came.

1197
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,253
Yes, I heard Mr. Sharma.
You both look like a wonderful pair of father and son.

1198
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,628
♫ Let’s increase the number of our kith and kin. ♫

1199
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:38,337
Where is the license?
-I didn't have.

1200
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,920
Then pay the fine.

1201
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:43,003
What’s up?
-I have the license and RC book with me, sir.

1202
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:44,295
But, where is the helmet?

1203
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:45,128
The thing is...

1204
01:00:45,295 --> 01:00:47,962
My son whom I had lost 20 years ago,
came back to me.

1205
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,634
I want the entire village to
see the happiness on my face.

1206
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:52,342
If I put the helmet on,
they won’t be able to see.

1207
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:53,301
I will pay the fine.

1208
01:00:53,467 --> 01:00:54,509
That’s not necessary.

1209
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:56,926
If I give you a penalty, it would look like
I am giving you a penalty for being happy.

1210
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:57,509
Go on.

1211
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:05,926
♫ You who has no time to spare♫
♫ Will be given a rebirth♫

1212
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:09,717
♫ This is not the time to be idle. ♫

1213
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:13,967
♫ The thing that your heart desires♫
♫ is vanished ♫

1214
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:17,801
♫ this is the net from which you cannot escape. ♫

1215
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:22,384
♫ It fulfils that vacuum♫
♫ Now and always♫

1216
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:25,467
♫ Let’s stay ahead♫

1217
01:01:26,134 --> 01:01:30,676
♫ After we have done our good deeds♫
♫ What we get in return, ♫

1218
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:34,405
♫ Let’s consider it as a blessing♫

1219
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,964
♫ Who knows? Who knows? ♫
♫ The kind of pain hidden in their hearts. ♫

1220
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:42,467
♫ Let’s share their pain a bit at least. ♫

1221
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:47,384
♫ Who knows? Who knows? ♫
♫ The kind of bond hidden in which path. ♫

1222
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:50,717
♫ Let’s increase the number of our kith and kin. ♫

1223
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:00,051
Hey!
Stop that!

1224
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:06,634
Hey, where are you going?

1225
01:02:06,842 --> 01:02:08,134
Someone is being beat up there.

1226
01:02:08,134 --> 01:02:09,676
Let that be. It’s none of our business.
Let’s go.

1227
01:02:09,676 --> 01:02:10,384
What do you mean father?

1228
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:12,884
How can you say that when someone is
being that brutally beaten up right in front of us?

1229
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:13,467
Look there.

1230
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:15,384
The people who are supposed to stop that
are leisurely drinking tea.

1231
01:02:15,384 --> 01:02:16,301
Why should we bother?

1232
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:29,842
Give me two coconuts please.

1233
01:02:32,384 --> 01:02:33,467
What’s this atrocity, father?

1234
01:02:34,176 --> 01:02:37,634
They are hitting that man in broad daylight
Why is no one intervening?

1235
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:39,134
Who are those people?

1236
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:41,009
Gangaraju.

1237
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:46,842
He is the big boss of sand mafia.

1238
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:55,176
One of the reason why I have taken
Voluntary Retirement from my VRO position...

1239
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:58,342
was because I couldn’t do anything about his misdeeds.

1240
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:01,884
Most people earn money and turn it into wealth.

1241
01:03:03,051 --> 01:03:04,342
He buys officers.

1242
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:06,842
This is Kaliyug...

1243
01:03:07,301 --> 01:03:09,217
Justice also is on the side of the offender.

1244
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:12,926
That is the reason why no one comes forward
to oppose him.

1245
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:42,384
Did you think that I would hit you?

1246
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:49,592
My people have already brought
you after hitting only, know?

1247
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,842
A person who sits in the shop and do business like you,
Is enough if you know calculations.

1248
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,509
But while doing this type of business,
One should know how to miscalculate...

1249
01:04:01,259 --> 01:04:02,217
Like me.

1250
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:06,134
We told you numerous times to change the
survey numbers from your end to our convenience.

1251
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,426
But you never listened to us.

1252
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:10,801
You could have gotten rid of all this with money.
Instead, you choose the hard route of getting thrashed.

1253
01:04:11,342 --> 01:04:12,384
Come to your senses. Listen to us.

1254
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:13,342
Why should I listen to you?

1255
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:15,134
I am the one who took those leases.

1256
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:17,009
This is my sand.

1257
01:04:17,884 --> 01:04:19,384
I will not give it to you,
even if I lose my life.

1258
01:04:21,051 --> 01:04:23,217
There is no question of my sand or your sand.

1259
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:25,842
There is just sand.

1260
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:32,092
When I look at him,
I recall a poem that I learnt in my childhood.

1261
01:04:32,217 --> 01:04:34,217
We can squeeze oil out of sand with effort

1262
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:37,217
We can drink water from a mirage

1263
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:39,967
We can search and find impossible things.

1264
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:43,676
But we can never win the heart of a stubborn fool!

1265
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,092
That last line is for people like you.

1266
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,134
God gives one a full life span.

1267
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,801
But people like you, will die with half lifespan.

1268
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:14,342
It’s better to kill the issue
rather than kill a person, Ganga.

1269
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:15,592
I don’t understand.

1270
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:20,342
Listen, legally speaking, all the survey numbers
are under his name.

1271
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:23,676
If not today, some other day, there will be someone
or the other who will begin to fight for him.

1272
01:05:23,842 --> 01:05:26,342
That is the reason why it’s better
if the survey numbers are in our name.

1273
01:05:26,342 --> 01:05:27,134
How do we manage that?

1274
01:05:27,176 --> 01:05:30,842
If we can get the VRO of that time, to sign on
these leases with that date, that would do the trick.

1275
01:05:30,842 --> 01:05:33,051
The VRO of that time was Rama Sharma.
-Yes, brother.

1276
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:34,217
He is not in that position anymore.

1277
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,717
Yes, he is not in that position
but he is alive, right?

1278
01:05:36,842 --> 01:05:39,509
Let’s get an agreement done with that date
and get him to sign on that.

1279
01:05:40,051 --> 01:05:41,301
He already has cancer.

1280
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:42,759
We don’t even know when he is going to die.

1281
01:05:42,926 --> 01:05:45,842
If in the future, if we encounter any problem,
he wouldn’t be alive to tattle on us.

1282
01:05:54,342 --> 01:05:56,967
You used to love eating
sliced guava with chilli and salt.

1283
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:00,092
Hey, Sharma!

1284
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:01,051
Come here.

1285
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:09,301
Gangaraju asked you to sign these documents.

1286
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:17,051
You illegally mine sand and
you covet that of others as well.

1287
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:18,384
I won’t sign it.
Get lost.

1288
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:19,759
Hey..

1289
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:23,009
If you don’t sign it,
we were asked to get it signed by you.

1290
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:28,092
Who do you think you are dealing with?

1291
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:32,551
Who are you trying to intimidate?

1292
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:36,676
We are Gangaraju’s men!

1293
01:06:36,676 --> 01:06:38,342
So what if you are Gangaraju’s men?

1294
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:39,801
Since you are all human,

1295
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:43,342
If I hit you or him,
you are bound to get hurt, right?

1296
01:06:51,051 --> 01:06:52,509
You are his men.

1297
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,676
If he pays you, you hit people.

1298
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:57,467
I am his son.

1299
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:05,926
If you ever come to my father,
or even try to threaten him...

1300
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:10,217
you and that guy...

1301
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:32,467
Gayatri, get some water.

1302
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:33,884
For me too, mother.

1303
01:07:41,342 --> 01:07:42,426
What are these papers doing here?

1304
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:44,176
Gangaraju came here.

1305
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,759
Madam.. my name is Gangaraju.

1306
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:49,926
You must have heard of me.

1307
01:07:50,217 --> 01:07:53,884
The gifts of nature such as
Air, Water, Fire...

1308
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:56,467
are being used by people.

1309
01:07:56,884 --> 01:07:59,926
I do the same thing as well.
The gift of nature that I use, is sand.

1310
01:07:59,926 --> 01:08:02,092
I sell it to people in need.

1311
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:03,467
I have to survive, right?

1312
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,842
There is a huge demand for sand these days.

1313
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,676
I am not able to meet that demand.

1314
01:08:10,676 --> 01:08:13,717
That is the reason why
when Rama Sharma comes home...

1315
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:16,592
make sure he signs these documents
and send it to us.

1316
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:22,301
If your lost son thinks he is a man now
and tries to challenge us,

1317
01:08:23,884 --> 01:08:26,342
He gave warning to my boys.

1318
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:27,842
Instil some fear in him.

1319
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,842
Because he was lost,
he returned to you.

1320
01:08:34,592 --> 01:08:36,759
If I make sure you guys lose him...

1321
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:40,009
he would never come back.

1322
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:44,759
Come, father... Let’s go.
-Where?

1323
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:47,134
He asked for a signature, right?
Let’s do that in front of him.

1324
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:01,426
Ganga...

1325
01:09:02,634 --> 01:09:04,634
Sharma is coming here with his son.

1326
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:11,967
Of course, they would come here!

1327
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:14,009
Fear.

1328
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,717
Fear will make anyone weak on their knees, uncle.

1329
01:09:23,176 --> 01:09:23,884
Sit down, father.

1330
01:09:30,384 --> 01:09:33,217
We did not call you so that you can sit down
and discuss some sort of reconciliation.

1331
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:36,801
Anyways, did you sign?

1332
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:39,051
No, I did not.

1333
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,509
And he won’t sign either.

1334
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:44,051
I will make sure you sign.

1335
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:32,509
I have a habit from childhood.

1336
01:10:33,301 --> 01:10:36,092
When someone gives me something,
I will return it back to them.

1337
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,342
Be that love...

1338
01:10:40,092 --> 01:10:41,134
or fear.

1339
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:01,217
Sit down, father.

1340
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,259
We shall leave in 5 minutes.

1341
01:11:15,842 --> 01:11:18,842
You came home and
told my mom to advise me about something.

1342
01:11:19,676 --> 01:11:20,801
What is it?

1343
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:22,301
Fear...

1344
01:11:23,592 --> 01:11:25,759
Yes, fear.

1345
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:29,592
One does not fear because of what someone says.

1346
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:32,301
and courage doesn’t leave you just because
someone threatens you.

1347
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:49,801
The one who will be your umbrella
in hot weather, is behind you.

1348
01:11:50,009 --> 01:11:54,301
And to make sure no harm comes to my father,
he has a son, who is in front of you.

1349
01:11:57,717 --> 01:12:01,676
This is because you threatened my father
and also, because you worried my mother.

1350
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:03,801
If you apologise, I will let you go.

1351
01:12:17,926 --> 01:12:18,926
What?

1352
01:12:19,176 --> 01:12:21,009
Are you threatening Gangaraju?

1353
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:25,551
Your kingdom can only survive until a person
who isn’t threatened by you faces you.

1354
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:56,051
You look like a decent guy.

1355
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,592
Why are you hitting all like a brute?

1356
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:00,176
Lord Rama was also a good man.

1357
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:04,176
and yet, didn’t he kill Ravana?

1358
01:13:10,217 --> 01:13:10,717
Move...

1359
01:13:17,967 --> 01:13:18,592
Grandpa,

1360
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:20,009
Do you know who East Godavari SP is?

1361
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:21,384
Do you have any work with him?

1362
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:32,717
Do you get such kind of problems
because of your Emotion Suppliers service?

1363
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:35,426
We got to know about that just like all the others.

1364
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:37,676
He is a dangerous fellow.
I hope he didn’t do anything later.

1365
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:40,592
Let’s set this action part of your story aside.
What happened to your love affair?

1366
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:42,884
Did your sister not force you
with regards marriage?

1367
01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:44,926
Please tell us fast.

1368
01:13:44,926 --> 01:13:47,217
We are very curious to know and are
breathless with excitement.

1369
01:13:47,217 --> 01:13:49,176
I will have some hot tea and then
tell you the rest of the story.

1370
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,342
Order five tea please...

1371
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:00,970
What’s up, master?

1372
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,887
Are you really paying attention to her birth chart?

1373
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:06,512
I told her that I would take a look at her birth chart, right?

1374
01:14:06,845 --> 01:14:09,595
And when I look at it,
there are some problems with her birth chart.

1375
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:13,095
I am going to calculate the planetary positions accurately
and give her a detailed explanation.

1376
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,345
Or else, she wouldn’t believe me.

1377
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,428
You are done with your tea, right?
What happened next?

1378
01:14:19,803 --> 01:14:23,262
When we started, we wondered
if we could run it for at least a month.

1379
01:14:23,928 --> 01:14:26,178
But, it continued seamlessly for 6 months.`

1380
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:30,637
In those 6 months, all of us got attached
to a lot of people and unearthed a variety of emotions.

1381
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:35,512
What’s up, hero?
Why are you looking that intently at those photos?

1382
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,303
Look at the number of relationships
I’ve earned for myself.

1383
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,803
Grandpa and Grandma,

1384
01:14:40,095 --> 01:14:41,387
Younger sister,
Elder brother and sister-in-law.

1385
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,845
Mom and Dad.

1386
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:47,845
That’s true. ,But amongst all those relatives,
The one that I like is this.

1387
01:14:48,512 --> 01:14:51,595
Why wouldn’t you like this?
You deliberately asked to be a daughter-in-law.

1388
01:14:51,762 --> 01:14:53,762
You still won’t call me a wife for namesake either?!

1389
01:14:59,803 --> 01:15:01,762
Who are you people?
Why are you breaking our stuff?

1390
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:04,470
How dare you to cheat people in the
name of love and affection ?

1391
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:06,262
What the hell is this fake relationship?

1392
01:15:10,303 --> 01:15:11,637
Where is the guy who started this?

1393
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:12,678
I am here.

1394
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:16,762
We are after him.
Hit him!

1395
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:25,803
If you hit any of my near and dear ones,

1396
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:29,303
And you dare try and hit me?

1397
01:15:33,345 --> 01:15:36,887
You find it that amusing to destroy
another person’s property?

1398
01:15:43,387 --> 01:15:46,178
If the furniture in my office is destroyed,
I will buy them again.

1399
01:15:48,012 --> 01:15:50,428
If things in your body are damaged,
where will you buy them from?

1400
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,470
Siva!

1401
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:56,303
He is my grandson.
He came from America.

1402
01:15:59,178 --> 01:16:02,387
What is this, bro? How can his grandson come to my office
and make a scene?

1403
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:03,387
What did I do?

1404
01:16:03,387 --> 01:16:05,178
You beguiled my people with
your charms and nonsense of love and affection.

1405
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,803
You made them sign their property off in your name.

1406
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:08,262
What does he mean that I got you
to sign off your properties?

1407
01:16:08,637 --> 01:16:09,970
Oh, what a fine actor you make!

1408
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:11,970
They might believe you because of your acting skills.

1409
01:16:12,553 --> 01:16:13,345
But I wouldn’t fall for your tricks.

1410
01:16:14,928 --> 01:16:16,053
What is he talking about, grandma?

1411
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:17,595
What does he mean that I got you
to sign off your properties?

1412
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:19,803
He signed our property off to you.

1413
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,512
My grandson got to know it through his lawyer.
He came home and caused a scene.

1414
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,053
What is this, grandpa?

1415
01:16:25,262 --> 01:16:26,262
He is your grandson, isn’t he?

1416
01:16:26,637 --> 01:16:28,428
In what way is he my grandson?

1417
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:33,012
Is it because he was born to my son?
Or because he shares my surname?

1418
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:36,428
Blood relations exist only because of wealth?

1419
01:16:36,762 --> 01:16:41,303
It’s because he found out that I wrote off
our property in your name, he came to me.

1420
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,095
Is not, would he come?

1421
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:49,053
At the minimum, did he come to visit us
once a year and stay with us for two days at least?

1422
01:16:49,262 --> 01:16:50,053
No, he didn’t.

1423
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:51,845
But you...

1424
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,303
When she call you, you just come running.

1425
01:16:54,512 --> 01:16:57,887
If I say that I want you,
you come and sit with me.

1426
01:16:58,053 --> 01:16:59,553
You gave us love.

1427
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,345
You gave us a reason to live.

1428
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:06,845
Why would I give my wealth to him?

1429
01:17:10,387 --> 01:17:11,262
This is wrong, grandpa.

1430
01:17:12,137 --> 01:17:13,845
I am just pretending to be your grandson.

1431
01:17:14,637 --> 01:17:17,595
I want your love and affection.
I don’t want your wealth

1432
01:17:18,887 --> 01:17:22,095
I beg of you, don’t equate love with wealth.

1433
01:17:25,387 --> 01:17:27,012
All of this happened because
I didn’t know about any of this.

1434
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:29,387
If I had known, this thing wouldn’t have
gotten this far.

1435
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:31,637
Your wealth is yours.
Okay?

1436
01:17:35,512 --> 01:17:37,137
I don’t want anything that’s not mine.

1437
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:40,137
But if anyone lays a finger on things that are mine,

1438
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:41,970
Get lost!

1439
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:53,637
This is an interesting concept
in an interesting way.

1440
01:17:54,012 --> 01:17:54,678
Yeah.
Yeah.

1441
01:17:55,387 --> 01:17:56,095
Hi guys.

1442
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:57,803
Hey, Hi...

1443
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:58,595
What's the video?

1444
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:00,220
Seem to be watching it with
so much of interest?

1445
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:00,887
Yes.

1446
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:03,678
There are some people at Hyderabad,
they started emotional services named, ‘All is Well’.

1447
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:05,970
No matter what kind of relative you want,
they would supply them.

1448
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:06,595
Really?

1449
01:18:06,678 --> 01:18:10,095
All those people who have used their services
are giving their feedback on their website.

1450
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:11,303
My daughter Ramya.

1451
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,887
She lives in London.

1452
01:18:13,178 --> 01:18:14,720
I live here alone.

1453
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,303
This company sent me someone
who came to my house as my daughter.

1454
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:18,428
I am satisfied with their service.

1455
01:18:18,595 --> 01:18:20,137
I am quite happy.

1456
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:21,553
It’s all trash.

1457
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:25,012
How can someone evoke the same emotions
as one’s own daughter and son?

1458
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:26,470
They may have shot it with some drama artists.

1459
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:27,970
Don’t believe them.
It’s a fake video.

1460
01:18:29,553 --> 01:18:32,178
My name is Siva Rao
and my son’s name is Aditya.

1461
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:34,720
He works in Australia.

1462
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:39,053
When he calls me up,
I wish to tell him so many things.

1463
01:18:39,387 --> 01:18:41,678
But, he is busy.

1464
01:18:41,762 --> 01:18:44,553
And so, he doesn’t speak
for more than five minutes.

1465
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,512
I took a son relation from them.

1466
01:18:48,928 --> 01:18:50,095
This is uncle, right?

1467
01:18:53,803 --> 01:18:54,970
Balu...
-Yes.

1468
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:58,220
Send someone else as
Mr. Sivarao’s son. I cannot do it anymore.

1469
01:18:58,428 --> 01:18:59,428
How can we do that?

1470
01:18:59,428 --> 01:19:00,720
Once you have committed to them,
you can’t change on whim.

1471
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,178
There is no going back.

1472
01:19:01,178 --> 01:19:03,428
I am not his real son, right?
That does not matter. Just change it.

1473
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:05,887
I am unable to handle his affection.

1474
01:19:06,845 --> 01:19:07,512
Hi...

1475
01:19:07,637 --> 01:19:08,512
He is here.

1476
01:19:14,303 --> 01:19:14,887
My son.

1477
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:16,012
Hello...
-Hi.

1478
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,137
Because you started this
Emotion Suppliers...

1479
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:33,803
I realised what I was missing in my life.

1480
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:37,512
I love my dad very much.

1481
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:40,845
He wanted a house of his own.

1482
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:43,012
but he couldn’t fulfil that wish.

1483
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,970
That is the reason why
I bought him a house.

1484
01:19:48,262 --> 01:19:51,928
In my childhood, my father used
to take me to school on his bicycle.

1485
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:56,053
When I grew up,
I wanted to buy my father a car.

1486
01:19:57,678 --> 01:19:58,303
And I bought it.

1487
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:02,595
My dad is a big foodie.

1488
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:04,845
But...

1489
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,428
when my mom passed away,
he stopped eating well.

1490
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:16,762
If my father wishes to have good food,
who will cook for him?

1491
01:20:17,637 --> 01:20:20,095
That is the reason why I got him a cook.

1492
01:20:22,178 --> 01:20:26,137
I did all this for him and thought that
I gave my father a lot of happiness.

1493
01:20:27,137 --> 01:20:27,637
But...

1494
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:34,470
I realised that I gave him everything
except happiness.

1495
01:20:34,803 --> 01:20:35,762
I am sorry, Dad.

1496
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:38,220
Why are you sorry?

1497
01:20:39,345 --> 01:20:39,928
No.

1498
01:20:40,553 --> 01:20:41,053
No.

1499
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:42,428
Balu...

1500
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:49,887
when I came to your office for the very first time,
I thought I needed a son to have a conversation with.

1501
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:56,178
But, I never imagined that my son would come back for me.

1502
01:20:57,845 --> 01:20:58,762
Thank you, Balu.

1503
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,803
This is possible because of you.
-Don’t mention that, uncle.

1504
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:02,928
Thank you very much.

1505
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:06,470
Okay. Okay.

1506
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:08,720
Bye. Bye. God bless you.
-Thank you, uncle.

1507
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:13,220
I still remember the happiness I saw
in my hero’s eyes.

1508
01:21:13,512 --> 01:21:18,095
Up until that day, the emotions we gave to our clients was
different from the emotions that father experienced!

1509
01:21:18,303 --> 01:21:23,220
I figured out how happy one can get
just by making other’s happy.

1510
01:21:25,803 --> 01:21:27,637
What’s up producer?
Why did you ask me to come down?

1511
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,428
I made a programme for the both of us today.

1512
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:32,553
A programme?
For the both of us?

1513
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:33,262
Yeah.

1514
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:35,345
First, let us have some good coffee.

1515
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,845
and after that let’s go for a 11:00 o’clock show movie

1516
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:40,095
and then, let’s have our lunch at Bowl o’ China.

1517
01:21:40,137 --> 01:21:44,137
then, let’s shop in the mall. And go for
a long drive on Necklace Road in the evening.

1518
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:44,720
Stop. Stop.

1519
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:47,303
What’s this long list?
Don’t you know that I have a lot of work to do today?

1520
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:50,762
Nothing doing.
You are spending the entire day with me.

1521
01:21:50,762 --> 01:21:52,178
I already said it.
I am not taking it back.

1522
01:21:52,512 --> 01:21:56,720
I am telling you that I don’t have time to spare.
I am not taking it back.

1523
01:21:57,637 --> 01:21:58,095
ok

1524
01:21:58,595 --> 01:21:59,053
go

1525
01:21:59,803 --> 01:22:04,678
Vadapalli ,I am going to call my father-in-law who stays in
Sri Sri Rama Sharma,

1526
01:22:04,803 --> 01:22:08,303
and complain that his son isn’t taking me
outside anywhere at all.

1527
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:08,720
Alright!

1528
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,470
What do you want?
- Hold my hand.

1529
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:12,678
Hold it.

1530
01:22:16,803 --> 01:22:17,345
Smile.

1531
01:22:18,387 --> 01:22:19,387
Good boy.
Let’s go.

1532
01:22:43,637 --> 01:22:47,387
♫ I don’t know if it’s a yes ♫
♫ I don’t know if it’s a no, ♫

1533
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:51,095
♫ I don’t know what kind of smile that is. ♫

1534
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:58,387
♫ Haven’t you lost your hesitation? ♫
♫ Or haven’t you woken up to your youth? ♫

1535
01:22:58,928 --> 01:23:02,803
♫ I don’t know if it’s a yes ♫
♫ I don’t know if it’s a no, ♫

1536
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:06,595
♫ I don’t know what kind of smile that is. ♫

1537
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:13,637
♫ Haven’t you lost your hesitation? ♫
♫ Or haven’t you woken up to your youth? ♫

1538
01:23:13,637 --> 01:23:21,887
♫ If I extend my companionship, does the thought find you bitter? ♫
♫ Don’t you want to taste my mouth? ♫

1539
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:27,512
♫ Say something sweet♫
♫ Make me believe that you are a sweet guy♫

1540
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:29,178
♫ Very nicely ♫

1541
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:33,303
♫ Even if you ask me to leave, ♫
♫ Do you think I will? ♫

1542
01:23:33,303 --> 01:23:37,053

1544
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:45,053
♫ I will bind myself to you in bonds that won’t break♫

1545
01:23:56,678 --> 01:24:04,303
♫ Oh, the screen that separates us, ♫
♫ Move aside just a little bit. ♫

1546
01:24:04,303 --> 01:24:11,220
♫ Isn’t this is the age and time in which youth rushes?♫

1547
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:15,762
♫ Have you taken for granted the allures of kisses, ♫

1548
01:24:15,887 --> 01:24:22,095
♫ Why are you still shy and silent? ♫

1549
01:24:23,387 --> 01:24:27,220
♫ Even if you ask me to leave, ♫
♫ Do you think I will? ♫

♫ Don’t say no. ♫

1554
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:08,803
♫ Come to me as if I were your present. ♫

1555
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:13,262
♫ It is but natural for me to have these kinds of desires. ♫

1556
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:19,595
♫ This isn’t an offence, right? ♫

1557
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,845
♫ I don’t know if it’s a yes ♫
♫ I don’t know if it’s a no, ♫

♫ Or haven’t you woken up to your youth?

1560
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:43,345

01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:06,928
♫ Let me bind myself to you in bonds that won’t break♫

1567
01:26:14,428 --> 01:26:17,970
Mohan Rao, you seem to be very busy
with the wedding of your Son?

1568
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:20,053
Of course, yes.
Weddings are definitely tedious, no?

1569
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:21,345
I’ve heard that the girl is quite rich.

1570
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:23,053
How does that matter how rich she is?

1571
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:24,595
We aren’t taking any dowry.

1572
01:26:25,512 --> 01:26:27,595
They have only one daughter

1573
01:26:28,012 --> 01:26:30,095
and all that wealth belongs to her.

1574
01:26:30,095 --> 01:26:32,803
And yet, you are here proclaiming that
you don’t take a single penny in dowry.

1575
01:26:32,803 --> 01:26:33,553
Husband!

1576
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:39,178
What I mean is, in this age,
hats off to you for not taking any dowry.

1577
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:43,137
Come. Serve us.
Take some sweet.

1578
01:26:44,137 --> 01:26:46,012
He stopped having any sweet.

1579
01:26:46,595 --> 01:26:50,678
He stands in front of Pulla Reddy Sweets
and has half kg of sweet every day.

1580
01:26:50,678 --> 01:26:52,428
And he claims, he quit sweets.

1581
01:26:54,762 --> 01:26:56,970
You quit sweets?
We had absolutely no idea.

1582
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,012
We will get going, Sharada.
But don’t get your husband for the wedding.

1583
01:27:02,345 --> 01:27:04,720
I wouldn’t be surprised if he becomes the
reason why the marriage wouldn’t go through.

1584
01:27:06,428 --> 01:27:09,762
Why would they come to my house,give me the wedding invite
and ask me not to come to their wedding?

1585
01:27:10,262 --> 01:27:12,012
You just blurted out your inner thoughts.

1586
01:27:12,803 --> 01:27:14,928
Your habit doesn’t just cause one problem.

1587
01:27:15,095 --> 01:27:17,428
Everyone is getting married.

1588
01:27:17,845 --> 01:27:20,470
If we get Nandini married,
we would be done with one responsibility, right?

1589
01:27:21,595 --> 01:27:22,720
When I want to talk to her,

1590
01:27:23,012 --> 01:27:27,387
she goes around villages with Balu talking of
emotions and relationships.

1591
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:31,803
Stop. Stop.
Right here.

1592
01:27:33,845 --> 01:27:35,553
Father, are you done with your prayers?

1593
01:27:36,762 --> 01:27:40,345
Mother, this is Soursop fruit.
I heard it’s helpful to treat cancer.

1594
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,970
If father has it every day,
It will do him good.

1595
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:45,762
If I don’t eat it,
I’ll die

1596
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:51,553
It’s better to be dead rather
than stay alive as a father who has been cheated.

1597
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:55,137
What happened, father?

1598
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:55,678
No!

1599
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,303
Don’t call me father.

1600
01:27:57,553 --> 01:28:01,012
Just because you are paid to act like my son,
will I become your father?

1601
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:06,470
Do you want to know how I found out
about this?

1602
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:08,470
Mr Sharma, watch this video.

1603
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:11,678
You want a relationship
and we provide the affection.

1604
01:28:11,803 --> 01:28:14,512
For further information,
log into our website.

1605
01:28:14,553 --> 01:28:15,720
You have been deceived.

1606
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,720
www.alliswellemotionalsuppliers.com

1607
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:23,678
You brought someone who is not my son.

1608
01:28:24,678 --> 01:28:27,803
You lied to me in an effort to keep me happy.

1609
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:31,470
But, did you ever think how hurt
I would be when I find out the truth?

1610
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,095
Please, father...
Listen to me...

1611
01:28:34,095 --> 01:28:37,470
I was ecstatic when you came to me as my son.

1612
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,928
I went around the entire village

1613
01:28:40,137 --> 01:28:43,678
and told every one that my son is back.
...that my son is back.

1614
01:28:44,095 --> 01:28:47,387
How do you expect me to raise my head
and walk around in my village?

1615
01:28:49,012 --> 01:28:51,762
This entire village would look at me
with sadness due to my disease...

1616
01:28:52,428 --> 01:28:55,845
But now, it’s going to look at me with
pity because I was cheated.

1617
01:28:58,887 --> 01:29:03,012
I thought that the place of business was flooded
with almost everything but affection.

1618
01:29:04,137 --> 01:29:08,220
Finally, you mocked affection as well.
Are you even human?

1619
01:29:08,512 --> 01:29:14,553
Don’t ever play with hearts and emotions!
You will never succeed in life.

1620
01:29:14,762 --> 01:29:16,095
Never succeed!

1621
01:29:16,803 --> 01:29:18,178
Get lost.

1622
01:29:18,178 --> 01:29:18,803
Get lost.

1623
01:29:19,137 --> 01:29:20,803
Get out of my sight.

1624
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:22,803
Go away!

1625
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:29,720
Father-in-law...

1626
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:31,803
Oh, sorry!

1627
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:34,303
We are not related now, right?!

1628
01:29:35,428 --> 01:29:37,053
The person whom you have
commanded to get out of this house,

1629
01:29:37,512 --> 01:29:38,345
Acharya...

1630
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:40,220
I mean, Balu.

1631
01:29:40,803 --> 01:29:42,345
I know him right from my childhood.

1632
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,262
He keeps saying the same thing every time.

1633
01:29:46,262 --> 01:29:49,595
What you sow is what you reap.

1634
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:53,678
That is the reason why he always gives love.

1635
01:29:54,678 --> 01:29:56,303
How is Balu in the wrong?

1636
01:29:57,637 --> 01:29:59,595
He didn’t come here for your wealth.

1637
01:30:00,303 --> 01:30:02,345
He came here because of her request..

1638
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:06,720
He lost his father when he was young.

1639
01:30:07,553 --> 01:30:09,970
And he saw his father in you.

1640
01:30:10,553 --> 01:30:13,345
He gave you the love you wanted from a son.

1641
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,553
When you were in trouble,
he had your back.

1642
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:24,553
He didn’t turn away thinking that
he was just an acting son.

1643
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,012
That day, in that brawl with Gangaraju’s goons,
what if something had happened to him?

1644
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:35,470
Aunty, do you remember?

1645
01:30:35,637 --> 01:30:40,387
You told us that your husband will not stay
alive for more than a month.

1646
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:45,928
You said that you needed a son to
keep your husband happy this entire month.

1647
01:30:47,387 --> 01:30:50,470
It’s been 6 months since we came to your house.

1648
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:55,803
These 5 months of life that you have enjoyed
is not because of doctors or gods.

1649
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,970
It’s because of him.

1650
01:31:01,053 --> 01:31:03,678
Medicines are not the only things that
keep a man alive.

1651
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,387
Love and affection as well.

1652
01:31:06,637 --> 01:31:08,803
It was because of the affection he showered on you.

1653
01:31:09,095 --> 01:31:14,762
It was the happiness that he gave
that enabled you to survive and stay alive for so long.

1654
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:20,262
Even if your real son came back to you,

1655
01:31:20,845 --> 01:31:23,845
he wouldn’t have done as good a job of looking
after you as Balu did.

1656
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:32,887
If you had ever been hurt or offended by
either of us, please forgive us.

1657
01:31:51,928 --> 01:31:53,887
I was hasty. I badmouthed you.
and hit you.

1658
01:31:55,262 --> 01:31:56,762
I asked you to leave my house.

1659
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,678
And yet, you are still here.

1660
01:31:59,012 --> 01:31:59,803
Oh common, father.

1661
01:32:00,095 --> 01:32:02,595
Who leaves their home just because
their father scolds or nags?

1662
01:32:03,012 --> 01:32:04,887
If that were the case,
90% of the children will run away from home.

1663
01:32:05,178 --> 01:32:08,345
You are my father.
If you won’t hit me, who can?

1664
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:12,053
I asked god to give me back my son that I lost.

1665
01:32:12,678 --> 01:32:16,595
But, he has given me the father I had lost
many years ago.

1666
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,970
He gave me my father back.

1667
01:32:22,345 --> 01:32:23,970
Your hero is really great.

1668
01:32:24,095 --> 01:32:27,470
Kids nowadays, if their parents say a harsh word,
they get upset and leave the house

1669
01:32:27,637 --> 01:32:30,470
But, for Balu to be that committed...

1670
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:32,845
Mr. Rama Sharma must have been very happy.

1671
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:34,137
Yes, he was.

1672
01:32:34,678 --> 01:32:37,428
Perhaps that was the reason why his
life prolonged.

1673
01:32:40,595 --> 01:32:41,678
But one day,

1674
01:32:57,053 --> 01:33:05,970
♫ Life is not lived without a few tears
spilling out of our eyes.♫

1675
01:33:06,262 --> 01:33:14,887
♫ No birth reaches its logical end without scars and hurt.♫

1676
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:23,970
♫ This body that we have been given is for the sake of others.♫

1677
01:33:24,137 --> 01:33:33,303
♫ One must always return the favours,
this is the reason for our survival.♫

1678
01:33:33,595 --> 01:33:38,553
♫ Who knows? Who knows? ♫
♫ the kind of pain lies in people’s hearts. ♫

1679
01:33:38,553 --> 01:33:42,303
♫ Let’s try and share a bit of it. ♫

1680
01:33:42,637 --> 01:33:50,428
♫ The kind of relationships hid in different paths.
Let’s increase the number of our kin. ♫

1681
01:33:50,428 --> 01:33:51,303
Acharya...

1682
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:54,678
Oh, from now on, shouldn’t be
calling you by that name, right?

1683
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:57,678
Balu..
Here is the money you spent on his funeral.

1684
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,470
Just because you served the purpose for
which you were recruited.

1685
01:34:01,012 --> 01:34:02,512
Please don’t forget your mother.

1686
01:34:05,137 --> 01:34:06,637
I came to this house as a son.

1687
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:08,512
Not just for him.

1688
01:34:09,637 --> 01:34:11,095
A mother is not a person one can forget.

1689
01:34:11,678 --> 01:34:12,678
It is an unforgettable relationship.

1690
01:34:13,512 --> 01:34:14,012
Nandu...

1691
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,678
These are the flight tickets to Kasi.

1692
01:34:18,012 --> 01:34:21,470
I have also recruited someone to accompany you
and even help you.

1693
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,012
Later on, you can stay with me.

1694
01:34:23,137 --> 01:34:25,887
If only there was a son like this in every house,
It would be great.

1695
01:34:31,852 --> 01:34:36,935
He appeared as though he was
the real son and got the situation this far.

1696
01:34:38,185 --> 01:34:39,977
Apparently, that’s his job.

1697
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,393
He will supply relations for people
who needs emotions.

1698
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:44,033
Giving is his habit.

1699
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:47,435
Taking anything that we can get our hands on is our habit.

1700
01:34:48,102 --> 01:34:51,393
He doesn’t have wealth or even sand mines,

1701
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,935
so, let’s take his life

1702
01:34:53,935 --> 01:34:55,727
Do you want me to call our men?

1703
01:34:55,935 --> 01:34:56,852
No, uncle.

1704
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,518
It’s been so long since I heard
the sound of Soda bottle.

1705
01:35:01,602 --> 01:35:03,977
When I come out,
I will listen to it myself.

1706
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,518
The car you sent to receive me is the same old thing.

1707
01:35:16,727 --> 01:35:17,727
You didn’t even change the house

1708
01:35:17,852 --> 01:35:18,893
and yet you change manners, is it?

1709
01:35:18,893 --> 01:35:20,185
What did they change?

1710
01:35:20,268 --> 01:35:23,060
When your son-in-law comes home,
won’t you even come to the threshold to welcome him?

1711
01:35:23,227 --> 01:35:23,852
Those are basic manners.

1712
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:25,560
We have been married for five years.

1713
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,685
Why start things like that?

1714
01:35:26,977 --> 01:35:28,477
Oh my Goodness!

1715
01:35:28,477 --> 01:35:29,685
I am not talking about you.

1716
01:35:30,102 --> 01:35:31,518
I am talking about me,
the youngest son-in-law.

1717
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:32,852
You are not yet the son-in-law
of this house.

1718
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:33,810
If you do become one,
they will certainly welcome you.

1719
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:35,352
Not if.
I have to become the son-in-law.

1720
01:35:35,518 --> 01:35:36,685
I must get married to Nandini.

1721
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:38,727
If not,
you have to divorce my sister-in-law.

1722
01:35:38,977 --> 01:35:42,435
If you and my sister do not get married,
why would my husband divorce me?

1723
01:35:42,518 --> 01:35:45,768
Rama was the only one who was exiled to the forest yet,
Lakshmana forsook his wife and followed him.

1724
01:35:45,768 --> 01:35:46,768
Check the history.

1725
01:35:46,768 --> 01:35:48,352
What kind of comparison is that?

1726
01:35:48,352 --> 01:35:48,935
Really?

1727
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:49,893
Come here.

1728
01:35:50,727 --> 01:35:53,185
Do we look like we share the same genes?
And yet we are born as brothers.

1729
01:35:53,435 --> 01:35:55,602
Some things cannot be compared
so, you should just obey orders.

1730
01:35:55,727 --> 01:35:57,393
What’s with this mindless chatter?

1731
01:35:57,393 --> 01:35:59,018
Mom!

1732
01:36:00,852 --> 01:36:02,435
Hi, uncle.
-How are you?

1733
01:36:03,352 --> 01:36:05,977
Hope your journey was well.
-Great uncle.

1734
01:36:07,185 --> 01:36:08,518
How are you?
Fine.

1735
01:36:08,518 --> 01:36:10,143
Hi, Dad...
How are you?

1736
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,060
Why is she screaming like that?
Is she going to register a complaint or what?

1737
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,685
Why did you hug her?

1738
01:36:16,185 --> 01:36:19,143
Both of them hugged the both of you.
What am I supposed to do?

1739
01:36:19,143 --> 01:36:19,602
I can’t.

1740
01:36:19,602 --> 01:36:21,477
Looks like he didn’t outgrow the weirdness

1741
01:36:22,435 --> 01:36:23,143
Nice joke.

1742
01:36:23,935 --> 01:36:25,227
You say I am weird. How is that a joke?

1743
01:36:26,018 --> 01:36:26,935
Oh,
Did I spill my inner thoughts?

1744
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,643
Yes, you did.
But, it’s ok.

1745
01:36:28,643 --> 01:36:30,810
Anyways, you didn’t change your maid?

1746
01:36:30,893 --> 01:36:32,852
She does a good job.
Why would we change her?

1747
01:36:32,852 --> 01:36:33,435
They have to be changed.

1748
01:36:33,893 --> 01:36:35,018
Our phones work fine and yet,

1749
01:36:35,018 --> 01:36:36,727
we change our phones when
there is a new model in the market.

1750
01:36:36,893 --> 01:36:38,435
Car is in a good condition and yet

1751
01:36:38,435 --> 01:36:40,560
when there is a new sleeker model
in the market, we buy it.

1752
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,685
Occasionally, we have to change
the things we use.

1753
01:36:42,685 --> 01:36:44,768
That is how they become fresh.
That is called rejuvenation.

1754
01:36:44,852 --> 01:36:46,893
Thank god you didn’t ask me
to change my wife.

1755
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:48,602
Actually it's a good idea.

1756
01:36:48,768 --> 01:36:51,643
But to get someone in your height,
we should go to Uganda.

1757
01:36:51,643 --> 01:36:53,643
The seed of weirdness in his head
is the size of a palm fruit.

1758
01:36:53,643 --> 01:36:55,435
What is he saying?!
-What is he talking about?!

1759
01:36:59,935 --> 01:37:00,893
Hi, brother-in-law.

1760
01:37:01,268 --> 01:37:01,893
Hi, Nandu...

1761
01:37:01,893 --> 01:37:03,477
Hi, Nandu.
How are you?

1762
01:37:03,477 --> 01:37:04,143
I am fine.

1763
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,518
Where is my sister?
-She is inside.

1764
01:37:06,018 --> 01:37:07,060
Nandu.

1765
01:37:08,768 --> 01:37:09,227
Kishore...

1766
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,435
Hi...

1767
01:37:10,435 --> 01:37:14,393
I expected you to come to the airport
to receive me.

1768
01:37:14,393 --> 01:37:15,102
But you didn't come.

1769
01:37:16,102 --> 01:37:21,477
I expected you to lose a couple of kgs this time
But, you didn’t.

1770
01:37:22,393 --> 01:37:24,643
Alright, I will meet up with my sister and come back later.

1771
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:28,560
She didn’t come. I didn’t lose.
Nandu has a sharp tongue just like me.

1772
01:37:28,852 --> 01:37:29,477
Our Nandu.

1773
01:37:29,477 --> 01:37:30,477
Our Nandu?

1774
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:34,393
How dare you compare yourself to my daughter?

1775
01:37:34,393 --> 01:37:35,935
She is a gem and you are gum!

1776
01:37:35,935 --> 01:37:36,560
Seriously.

1777
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:40,435
That’s right. It’s exactly the same.
That sharp tongue.

1778
01:37:40,643 --> 01:37:43,352
You must be talking loudly in that head of yours.
I can hear your inner voice.

1779
01:37:43,893 --> 01:37:44,893
What do you mean gem and gum?!

1780
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:51,768
Mom, did you broach the subject of Kishore
with Nandu?

1781
01:37:51,768 --> 01:37:54,893
How could I? Whenever I bring up that topic,
she just gets up and leaves.

1782
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,352
And to add to that....

1783
01:37:56,768 --> 01:37:58,143
Kishore is a bit weird.

1784
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:01,810
He just talks like that, Mom.
But as a person, he is very good.

1785
01:38:02,852 --> 01:38:04,393
All the members of my family
are for this alliance.

1786
01:38:05,393 --> 01:38:08,102
Next week, we are going to my
mother-in-law’s place for a get together

1787
01:38:08,977 --> 01:38:11,727
If Nandu agrees, my husband said that
we could get the engagement done right then and there.

1788
01:38:11,893 --> 01:38:13,310
You must convince Nandini.

1789
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:15,435
No matter how many things you say to
convince me, I cannot come there.

1790
01:38:15,602 --> 01:38:16,852
I've lot of works here.

1791
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,393
What could be more important to you
than a family function?

1792
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,352
We are offering prayers to ‘Lakshmi Ganapati’

1793
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,852
for the well-being of all.
You will benefit too.

1794
01:38:24,018 --> 01:38:25,477
Whatever your heart desires,
it will come true.

1795
01:38:26,268 --> 01:38:28,560
Are you serious?
Yes, I am.

1796
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,102
Ok. Then, I will come too.

1797
01:38:29,102 --> 01:38:29,852
How are you going there?

1798
01:38:30,643 --> 01:38:31,768
All of you go by flight.

1799
01:38:32,227 --> 01:38:34,560
Nandini and I will take the car.
We will come by road.

1800
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:37,852
What?!
With Kishore? In a car?

1801
01:38:37,977 --> 01:38:39,060
No way.

1802
01:38:39,102 --> 01:38:41,393
What do you mean?
A road trip with him, without any of you guys?

1803
01:38:42,227 --> 01:38:45,185
I am going to impress Nandini because
no one is going to be around.

1804
01:38:45,518 --> 01:38:49,352
We need that kind of space so that we will be able
to understand each other before we get married.

1805
01:38:49,352 --> 01:38:51,935
Alright! You want me to come in a car with him?
Is that all?

1806
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:53,393
Yes. Yes.
-Fine, I’ll come.

1807
01:38:54,477 --> 01:38:57,352
Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Mom, let’s go pack.

1808
01:38:58,602 --> 01:39:01,185
How can one take a road trip with
some one you don’t like at all?

1809
01:39:01,768 --> 01:39:04,227
Don’t worry. The one I like will accompany me.

1810
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:06,768
Did you check it well?

1811
01:39:06,768 --> 01:39:08,685
Well, if that Kerala family wanted
a son and a daughter-in-law...

1812
01:39:08,727 --> 01:39:10,227
you could have sent Raju and Swati, right?

1813
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:11,143
Why should we go?

1814
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,393
Shall I speak to them?

1815
01:39:12,393 --> 01:39:14,185
They aren’t even around to talk.

1816
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,518
What did you say?

1817
01:39:15,727 --> 01:39:19,602
Nothing. I am going to attend a family
function in Munnar.

1818
01:39:19,893 --> 01:39:23,602
So, if you accompany me, family purpose
and business purpose, both will be served

1819
01:39:23,602 --> 01:39:24,768
That is the reason why I agreed.

1820
01:39:24,768 --> 01:39:26,310
Hey Kishore!
How are you?

1821
01:39:26,768 --> 01:39:28,602
When I started from their place,
I was alright.

1822
01:39:28,852 --> 01:39:30,727
But when I came to your place...
-I am here, right?

1823
01:39:30,727 --> 01:39:31,518
Everything will be fine.

1824
01:39:31,643 --> 01:39:33,143
You understand the situation according to your
convenience.

1825
01:39:33,143 --> 01:39:33,977
Great people.

1826
01:39:34,477 --> 01:39:35,185
Just a second...

1827
01:39:36,852 --> 01:39:37,643
Tell me...

1828
01:39:37,643 --> 01:39:39,227
Did you make Nandu fall for you?

1829
01:39:39,227 --> 01:39:40,393
Do you think Nandu is a maiden on
a packet of cards.

1830
01:39:40,393 --> 01:39:41,435
that she would fall at the slight gust of wind?

1831
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:44,352
I didn’t even start my moves.
How can you ask me about the result, already?

1832
01:39:44,518 --> 01:39:46,227
You are such a bad sibling!
Put the phone down.

1833
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,893
Why are you in the front seat?
-The back seat will be comfortable for you. That’s why

1834
01:39:51,227 --> 01:39:52,768
I am comfortable beside Nandu.

1835
01:39:52,768 --> 01:39:53,727
Bro, please sit in the back.

1836
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:54,852
Okay.

1837
01:39:55,602 --> 01:39:58,768
If hero sits in the back, I will sit in the back too.
You drive.

1838
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:01,393
If both of you sit in the back,
I’ll become the driver.

1839
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:03,143
Never mind that.
I will sit in the back.

1840
01:40:15,393 --> 01:40:16,768
This head weighs a lot!

1841
01:40:20,102 --> 01:40:23,102
I thought you might not be comfortable while driving.

1842
01:40:39,518 --> 01:40:40,602
Hey, move...

1843
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:42,768
Not that side.
This side.

1844
01:40:43,602 --> 01:40:44,143
Sit here.

1845
01:40:44,727 --> 01:40:45,893
That is my spot.

1846
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:51,310
Hey...

1847
01:40:54,518 --> 01:40:55,393
This is my spot.

1848
01:40:55,977 --> 01:40:56,810
Drink some tea.

1849
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:57,518
Please...

1850
01:40:58,227 --> 01:40:58,935
It tastes good.

1851
01:41:01,185 --> 01:41:02,143
Get your tea yourself.

1852
01:41:07,477 --> 01:41:08,018
Keep it.

1853
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:13,768
This fellow!

1854
01:41:14,685 --> 01:41:15,143
Oh no!

1855
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,602
This seat is mine.

1856
01:41:22,435 --> 01:41:24,018
He and his useless timing.

1857
01:41:24,393 --> 01:41:24,893
Tell me.

1858
01:41:25,143 --> 01:41:27,602
Brother, did you impress Nandini yet?
- Impress?

1859
01:41:27,977 --> 01:41:31,227
Balu is already squeezing my chances.
You are for sure getting a divorce.

1860
01:41:49,143 --> 01:41:50,310
Why did you stop the car?

1861
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:51,893
I didn’t stop the car.
It stopped.

1862
01:41:52,143 --> 01:41:54,310
Bloody local cars!
Open the bonnet.

1863
01:42:02,518 --> 01:42:03,018
Give me some water.

1864
01:42:03,685 --> 01:42:04,310
Quickly!

1865
01:42:05,935 --> 01:42:07,435
Do you know how to fix a car?

1866
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,185
No, I don’t.

1867
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,727
Then, why did you open the bonnet?

1868
01:42:11,352 --> 01:42:14,102
This is what people do in a situation like this.
That is protocol.

1869
01:42:14,518 --> 01:42:17,685
It’s a bit presumptuous to think that people
who lift the bonnet know how to repair a car.

1870
01:42:17,685 --> 01:42:19,727
One should regularly change cars and girlfriends.

1871
01:42:19,727 --> 01:42:21,602
If you just think changing the oil is enough,
this is how you end up

1872
01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:22,102
Hello!

1873
01:42:22,685 --> 01:42:27,185
Enough with your statements.
Just google if there are any mechanic shops around.

1874
01:42:35,643 --> 01:42:37,935
What? What happened?
What’s up?

1875
01:42:38,268 --> 01:42:41,643
If you think that I know what you are talking about
other than the fact that it’s Malayalam,

1876
01:42:41,643 --> 01:42:42,727
you can slap me with your slippers.

1877
01:42:43,227 --> 01:42:44,893
Are you people Telugu?

1878
01:42:44,893 --> 01:42:46,143
Oh, are you a Telugu person too?

1879
01:42:46,602 --> 01:42:47,393
My wife.

1880
01:42:47,727 --> 01:42:48,393
Okay.

1881
01:42:48,893 --> 01:42:49,810
Is there a problem?

1882
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,143
Yes. That is why we have stopped here.

1883
01:42:51,143 --> 01:42:53,060
If not, do you think we are taking selfie
or what with opened bonnet ?

1884
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,518
Indu!
-Yes, uncle.

1885
01:42:56,852 --> 01:42:59,143
Call Bijju and ask him to figure out what’s wrong.
-Okay, uncle.

1886
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:03,268
Mechanic would come and repair it.
Until then, stay in our house.

1887
01:43:03,268 --> 01:43:06,018
Okay, sir.
-that’s not necessary... we will stay here.

1888
01:43:06,352 --> 01:43:09,685
The mechanic has to come, he has to
figure out the problem and then repair it.

1889
01:43:10,102 --> 01:43:11,727
It takes lot of time.
-Lot of time.

1890
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:14,477
This is a hilly area. So, please...
-Can’t trust it.

1891
01:43:17,518 --> 01:43:18,185
Ok, Sir.

1892
01:43:31,852 --> 01:43:33,977
What is all this decoration for?
Is there a party of sorts?

1893
01:43:34,018 --> 01:43:36,768
It is our 25th wedding anniversary.
So, we have a small party.

1894
01:43:37,102 --> 01:43:39,268
Oh! 25th wedding anniversary?!
Congratulations.

1895
01:43:39,268 --> 01:43:40,227
Thank you.
-Where is your wife?

1896
01:43:48,227 --> 01:43:49,018
Jaya...

1897
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:52,518
My wife.

1898
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:53,102
Hello...

1899
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:55,018
Hello.
-Hello.

1900
01:43:55,018 --> 01:43:56,685
Who are these people?

1901
01:43:56,852 --> 01:43:57,810
They are our guests.

1902
01:43:58,977 --> 01:43:59,768
They are Telugu people.

1903
01:43:59,977 --> 01:44:01,310
Telugu people..!?

1904
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:01,727
Yes.

1905
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:04,102
Where are you guys from?
How do you know him?

1906
01:44:04,268 --> 01:44:07,477
It’s been a while since we saw Telugu people
and spoke in Telugu.

1907
01:44:07,477 --> 01:44:08,018
That is the reason why...

1908
01:44:08,018 --> 01:44:09,810
What would you like to have?
Coffee? Tea?

1909
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:10,643
No, just have a meal with us.

1910
01:44:11,768 --> 01:44:16,477
Indu, arrange food for all of them.
Go on, arrange food.

1911
01:44:16,477 --> 01:44:16,935
Ok, Aunty.

1912
01:44:16,935 --> 01:44:19,893
When she sees Telugu people
she feels as happy as seeing her own people.

1913
01:44:19,893 --> 01:44:21,227
That is the reason why she is so excited.

1914
01:44:21,227 --> 01:44:23,643
Have they been to space or something?

1915
01:44:23,643 --> 01:44:25,685
If you visit your village, you will
surely meet a lot of your kind in piles.

1916
01:44:27,268 --> 01:44:29,477
Its been 25 years since she went to her village.

1917
01:44:31,602 --> 01:44:32,935
Ours is a love marriage.

1918
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:38,393
25 years ago,
I used to work in ONGC in Narsapur.

1919
01:44:39,143 --> 01:44:43,393
She hails from Antarvedi.
None of our families agreed to our marriage.

1920
01:44:43,602 --> 01:44:45,893
She put her faith in me
and came with me.

1921
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:52,893
Her family broke ties with her because
she didn’t listen to them and came away with me.

1922
01:44:56,602 --> 01:45:03,185
From that day on, until now, they never set foot here
and she never went there either.

1923
01:45:04,393 --> 01:45:06,477
All these people here are my side of the relatives.

1924
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:14,352
she misses her side of the family.

1925
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:17,685
Antarvedi? That means your name is
Jayalakshmi, right?

1926
01:45:18,477 --> 01:45:19,143
Yes.

1927
01:45:19,143 --> 01:45:21,685
You studied in Y.N college in Narsapur, right?

1928
01:45:22,268 --> 01:45:22,893
Yes.

1929
01:45:23,102 --> 01:45:27,602
You used to love eating cashewnuts,
and loved playing on the carousal?

1930
01:45:27,977 --> 01:45:30,435
Yes, that’s right.
How do you know about those?

1931
01:45:31,602 --> 01:45:33,935
It’s because you are my aunt.

1932
01:45:34,393 --> 01:45:37,060
Aunt?
Aunt? How?

1933
01:45:37,768 --> 01:45:42,018
Are you my eldest brother Ramu’s son?

1934
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,685
Are you my younger brother Krishna’s son?

1935
01:45:46,018 --> 01:45:47,643
Yes, I am Balu.

1936
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:48,977
Krishna’s son?

1937
01:45:51,435 --> 01:45:52,727
Oh my god! I cannot believe it.

1938
01:45:54,727 --> 01:45:57,018
Husband, did you hear that?
He is my nephew.

1939
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:57,602
Balu.

1940
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:01,852
When I came away from there,
he was about this tall.

1941
01:46:02,268 --> 01:46:04,893
It’s because I was way too young,
you couldn’t recognise me.

1942
01:46:05,893 --> 01:46:06,560
But my father...

1943
01:46:06,852 --> 01:46:08,393
used to talking about you...

1944
01:46:08,685 --> 01:46:09,477
Really?

1945
01:46:09,685 --> 01:46:10,268
Yes.

1946
01:46:11,685 --> 01:46:15,477
If uncle did not tell us about your love story,
I wouldn’t have recognised you at all.

1947
01:46:15,477 --> 01:46:19,018
I can’t believe...
Who is this girl?

1948
01:46:19,018 --> 01:46:20,310
I will be related to you as your daughter.

1949
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:21,560
We are husband and wife.

1950
01:46:21,852 --> 01:46:22,977
We got married recently.

1951
01:46:23,102 --> 01:46:25,102
Congratulations!
-Thank you.

1952
01:46:25,268 --> 01:46:26,143
Oh nice!

1953
01:46:26,227 --> 01:46:27,393
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1954
01:46:27,393 --> 01:46:28,227
Who is this?

1955
01:46:28,602 --> 01:46:30,185
This is my cousin brother aunty.

1956
01:46:30,518 --> 01:46:31,268
No. I am just a cousin.

1957
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:34,060
Do you want to make them stand here and talk
or shall we take them inside?

1958
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:34,935
Oh. I am sorry.

1959
01:46:35,102 --> 01:46:36,143
Come here once...

1960
01:46:36,143 --> 01:46:36,602
Tell me, Madam.

1961
01:46:36,602 --> 01:46:38,768
This is my nephew.
This is his wife.

1962
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:40,393
Please get a room ready for them.

1963
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:41,810
Right away.
-Alright?

1964
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:46,477
There are a lot more people you will have to meet.
I want to introduce you to them.

1965
01:46:46,477 --> 01:46:47,727
Okay.

1966
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:48,602
Hey, let's go.

1967
01:46:49,185 --> 01:46:52,560
Husband, god does give you what you desire.

1968
01:46:53,102 --> 01:46:54,477
Perhaps a little late.

1969
01:46:55,643 --> 01:46:58,727
After all these years, my relatives
came to my house.

1970
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:04,791
Though he became a relative for the lonely,
after a long time, he found his own blood kin.

1971
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,958
I am so happy.

1972
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:06,666
Hey..?

1973
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:07,875
What’s up?

1974
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:11,541
I am not okay with you introducing yourselves as
husband and wife.

1975
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:12,958
But I am completely fine with it.

1976
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:14,375
Anyways, how could you say that?

1977
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,250
He found himself unexpectedly related to them.

1978
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,666
But what about you?

1979
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:21,041
Why did you attach yourself to them?
In all these years,

1980
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:23,833
Nonsense!
-And I wanted to be associated with that.

1981
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,625
I have already said it.
I am not taking it back.

1982
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:28,958
I will blurt out to everyone that you guys
are fake husband and wife.

1983
01:47:29,916 --> 01:47:30,500
No, I won’t tell them.

1984
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:33,208
But, please don’t forget that you are acting.

1985
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:34,958
and don’t get too involved in acting like
Radhika Apte.

1986
01:47:35,166 --> 01:47:35,958
Get lost.

1987
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:37,625
This is your room.

1988
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:38,208
Nice.

1989
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,375
Ok, uncle..
-Thank you.

1990
01:47:39,625 --> 01:47:40,333
Thank you.

1991
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:41,916
Not bad.

1992
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,541
Do you have it?
-What is that?

1993
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:47,583
Is it actually there?

1994
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,291
What are you talking about?
-A brain that thinks?

1995
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:51,083
Why do you want to come in between a
husband and wife?

1996
01:47:51,708 --> 01:47:52,375
I mean they....

1997
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:54,291
There is another room for you.
Come with me.

1998
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:00,708
What could they be doing in the room?

1999
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,416
I can’t see anything.

2000
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:05,875
And I can’t hear anything.

2001
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:07,791
Uncle...

2002
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,041
What happened?

2003
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:13,791
That curtain...

2004
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:18,708
Do you have it?

2005
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,208
Do you actually have it?

2006
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:21,375
A brain that thinks?
Yes, I have it.

2007
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:22,916
No.
Character.

2008
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:24,375
Do you have any character?

2009
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,833
When husband and wife are inside,
why are you peeping?

2010
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:29,166
I mean,
It looked like they were fighting...

2011
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:30,916
Does that mean you can look?

2012
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:32,708
You should at least have a bit of it.

2013
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:34,291
You mean character?
I got a bit of it.

2014
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:36,208
No... Shame!

2015
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:42,500
Oh wow!
You guys look so cute together.

2016
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:44,458
Come, I will introduce you to all.

2017
01:48:44,666 --> 01:48:45,333
Vishwa!

2018
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:46,625
My son.

2019
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:48,541
Vishwa...
-Mother...

2020
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:49,625
Vishwa, look who is here.

2021
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:51,041
This is my nephew, Balu.

2022
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:53,250
You are cousins.

2023
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:56,750
Mother-in-law and Father-in-law,

2024
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,666
Look at them.

2025
01:48:58,666 --> 01:48:59,791
Hello...
-hello.

2026
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,166
Balu, my nephew.

2027
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:02,041
Please bless me.

2028
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:02,708
And his wife.

2029
01:49:04,541 --> 01:49:05,708
You might now know about them.

2030
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:06,958
I did not know about them either.

2031
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:08,583
I just got to know about them.

2032
01:49:10,291 --> 01:49:11,625
I am very happy, father-in-law.

2033
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,625
Get lost!

2034
01:49:18,875 --> 01:49:22,166
Aunt is really happy because of her
nephew’s visit.

2035
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:24,500
She has been looking forward to meeting them
for the past 25 years.

2036
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:29,750
No one can give a woman the kind of happiness
that she gets from meeting people of her birth family.

2037
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:30,583
Aunt, this is enough.

2038
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:32,041
Eat some more for me

2039
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:35,166
The fried papads are really good.
They are quite special here.

2040
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:40,291
Nice taste, right?

2041
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:45,791
Do you have it?

2042
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:47,750
Do you really have it?

2043
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:51,083
What are you asking for?A brain? Character?
Or shame?

2044
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:52,458
Hunger.

2045
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,291
I mean hunger.

2046
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:56,333
I do not have hunger.
I have vengeance.

2047
01:49:56,333 --> 01:49:57,750
If you don’t leave, I’ll bite you.
Get lost!

2048
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:03,541
I am thankful to everyone who has come to
grace us on the occasion on our 25th anniversary.

2049
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:06,333
I have a small question for all the couples here.

2050
01:50:06,583 --> 01:50:08,208
You have to give me sincere answers.

2051
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,041
Good!

2052
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:23,000
I want to know how many times you told your partner
that you regretted marrying them.

2053
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:24,541
No... no...

2054
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:27,333
No chance.
I am certain that you must have said it one time or another.

2055
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:29,375
If that’s the case,
I say that at least 8 times a month.

2056
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:32,000
8 times?
What’s that score?

2057
01:50:32,166 --> 01:50:35,166
I tell him to stop going to the pub.
But he doesn’t pay heed.

2058
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:37,791
When he comes back,
I tell him that I regret marrying him.

2059
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:40,416
So, four weekends,
8 times.

2060
01:50:40,416 --> 01:50:41,916
Good. Good.

2061
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:45,500
I say that whenever your aunt makes lentil stew.

2062
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:47,333
I tell her that I regret marrying her

2063
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:49,916
and instead I should have married Andal in
Alwal street.

2064
01:50:51,333 --> 01:50:52,500
You tell me Nandini.

2065
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:55,708
Did you ever regret marrying Balu?

2066
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,666
Why would they think like that?
They are newly married.

2067
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:01,750
Newly married?

2068
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:04,500
We have been married for fifteen years.

2069
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:07,500
Fifteen years?!
-Yes, uncle.

2070
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:10,166
Does tying the sacred thread mean that
they are married?

2071
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:14,750
If one has loved a person for a long time

2072
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:19,000
and wants to spend their life with them,

2073
01:51:20,208 --> 01:51:22,875
that is when you are married to that person.

2074
01:51:25,166 --> 01:51:27,833
I loved Balu right from childhood.

2075
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:30,708
As I grew up...

2076
01:51:30,958 --> 01:51:32,708
my love for him grew too.

2077
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:38,458
Balu always keeps saying something, uncle.

2078
01:51:39,916 --> 01:51:43,625
What you reap is what you sow.

2079
01:51:44,375 --> 01:51:45,500
And that is the reason why...

2080
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:49,166
I have been giving him love from childhood.

2081
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:53,833
With the expectation that I would receive it
one day or another.

2082
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:01,041
If Balu did not return the love that you expected of him,
what would you have done?

2083
01:52:02,041 --> 01:52:03,500
I read somewhere that...

2084
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:07,583
if my love is true,
I don’t need you.

2085
01:52:08,166 --> 01:52:09,625
I can do with your memories.

2086
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:13,208
Even if Balu did not get married to me

2087
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:17,208
or if he doesn’t reciprocate my love for him,

2088
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:20,916
I would have lived my entire life
with his memories.

2089
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:23,875
That is how much I love Balu.

2090
01:52:24,791 --> 01:52:29,625
When you asked him if I regret marrying him,
I would never ever joke or even say

2091
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:36,125
Because...
I deeply desired to marry him.

2092
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,500
Only I know that.

2093
01:52:40,916 --> 01:52:45,000
It’s because the you love him that deeply,
god has united you.

2094
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,083
Aunty, everyone is waiting to celebrate.

2095
01:52:49,083 --> 01:52:49,916
Let’s go.

2096
01:53:35,416 --> 01:53:37,416
♫One small smile is enough. ♫

2097
01:53:37,416 --> 01:53:39,458

Help..

2144
01:56:33,333 --> 01:56:33,750
Father...

2145
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,333
Take a look.

2146
01:56:38,333 --> 01:56:38,708
Hello...

2147
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:44,166
Thanks.

2148
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:48,208
Do you have it?

2149
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:50,166
Do you really have it?
-What is it?

2150
01:56:50,166 --> 01:56:51,750
How did you lock yourself in?

2151
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,500
Are you insane?

2152
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,375
How would anyone inside
lock themselves from outside?

2153
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:57,166
This must be the act of some idiot like you!

2154
01:56:58,166 --> 01:56:58,875
Very stinky

2155
01:57:02,708 --> 01:57:04,333
This is for you.
Do you like it?

2156
01:57:04,916 --> 01:57:06,041
Why would you give this to me aunty?

2157
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:09,208
If he is my nephew,
you are my daughter.

2158
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,375
If mom isn’t generous to her daughter,

2159
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:13,083
That’s true but...

2160
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:14,791
this looks expensive.

2161
01:57:15,333 --> 01:57:16,916
If someone gives you something,

2162
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:19,708
you should look at the love with which
it’s been given.

2163
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:27,041
Do you have it?

2164
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:29,041
You mean the air in the tyre?
Yes, there is.

2165
01:57:29,291 --> 01:57:30,583
Petrol?
I have it.

2166
01:57:30,583 --> 01:57:31,875
A brain?
I have that too.

2167
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:33,541
Do you have your phone?

2168
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:37,875
I have it. You forgot.

2169
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Who would give me the charger?

2170
01:57:39,291 --> 01:57:40,000
You don’t have it.

2171
01:57:40,666 --> 01:57:43,541
What don’t I have?
-Charge.

2172
01:57:45,166 --> 01:57:47,125
I have it as well.
In fact, a lot.

2173
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:55,250
Aunty, he has taken a lot of gifts from you.
But, he never gave you anything.

2174
01:57:55,791 --> 01:57:59,083
He gave me the satisfaction that
I have someone from the family that birthed me.

2175
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:00,375
What more do I need than that?

2176
01:58:01,583 --> 01:58:02,875
Yeah, right!
Both of you are the same.

2177
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:05,583
Then, the both of us are the same.

2178
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,916
Your aunt’s family is really good.

2179
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:20,208
Is that because they gave you a necklace?

2180
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:20,666
No...

2181
01:58:20,833 --> 01:58:22,125
Not because of the gifts.

2182
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:27,291
Look at the way they treated us.
With such great affection.

2183
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:28,875
That is true.

2184
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,750
But my aunt’s family is a shitty one.
They constantly keep asking me about

2185
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:33,916
what I got for them from US.

2186
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:36,125
All these relatives need to be changed.

2187
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,583
All that is ok.
But, I have a doubt.

2188
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:42,625
I remember your dad’s name to be Mohan.

2189
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:44,500
And aunty said that his name is Krishna.

2190
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:47,083
Is your dad’s full name, Mohan Krishna?

2191
01:58:47,458 --> 01:58:47,916
No

2192
01:58:48,375 --> 01:58:48,958
What then...?

2193
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:53,083
She isn’t really my aunt.

2194
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:55,333
What?

2195
01:58:55,791 --> 01:58:57,500
So you mean to say....that aunt...

2196
01:58:58,750 --> 01:58:59,500
I told her a lie.

2197
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,125
You told her a lie?

2198
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:04,458
You fooled that poor lady
and got yourself gifts?

2199
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:07,083
You are not just an emotional supplier.
You are an emotional cheater as well.

2200
01:59:07,083 --> 01:59:07,666
That’s enough.

2201
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:08,541
Nonsense with him.

2202
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:12,000
But, you were very accurate with all details
regarding her.

2203
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,291
What details?!

2204
01:59:14,541 --> 01:59:16,750
In those days, the only degree college
in Narsapur was Y.N. College.

2205
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:17,625
That is what I told her.

2206
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:20,625
I generally told her all the things
that children preferred when they went to fairs.

2207
01:59:21,583 --> 01:59:23,750
Why would you need to lie to them?

2208
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:27,166
If tomorrow, they get to know the truth,
they would consider us to be frauds.

2209
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,625
I don’t care if they think you are frauds
But since I am with you,

2210
01:59:28,625 --> 01:59:30,333
I will be considered one too.
Won’t my reputation be ruined?

2211
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:31,583
Can you shut up?!

2212
01:59:31,833 --> 01:59:33,125
Even if they know the truth,
they wouldn’t feel that bad.

2213
01:59:35,125 --> 01:59:37,833
Do you know why?
Because I told uncle everything.

2214
01:59:38,166 --> 01:59:38,916
Sorry, sir.

2215
01:59:39,583 --> 01:59:42,291
When you told me that every one
who came here were your relatives,

2216
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:45,000
I saw the sadness in her eyes.

2217
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:51,500
I know very well the pain one experiences
when one is abandoned, even with so many relatives around.

2218
01:59:53,416 --> 01:59:54,583
That is why I lied.

2219
01:59:56,791 --> 02:00:00,416
She really thought that I was her nephew
and gave us a lot.

2220
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:04,916
If I don’t tell you the truth even now,
it isn’t ethical at all.

2221
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:06,458
We don’t want anything that you gave us.

2222
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:08,583
Balu...

2223
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:14,333
This is nothing compared to the happiness
you gave my wife.

2224
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:20,541
In all these years of marriage,
I have never seen her this much happy.

2225
02:00:22,666 --> 02:00:24,083
And you are the reason for that.

2226
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:26,333
And let that continue.

2227
02:00:27,625 --> 02:00:29,208
But remember one thing.

2228
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:35,708
You are the one who started this relationship
and it is your responsibility to continue it.

2229
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,000
Promise me?

2230
02:00:41,083 --> 02:00:41,875
Promise, uncle.

2231
02:00:43,416 --> 02:00:47,291
You are amazing hero.
People lie for selfish reasons.

2232
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:50,916
But you,
You lied for the happiness of others.

2233
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:52,666
shall we go?

2234
02:00:53,916 --> 02:00:57,166
If you take your hand off...
you have turned me in a chauffeur.

2235
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:57,875
Drive.

2236
02:01:02,791 --> 02:01:03,625
Ok, you go.

2237
02:01:04,875 --> 02:01:07,208
How are you?
How was the journey?

2238
02:01:07,541 --> 02:01:09,250
Won’t you change?
Won’t you change at all?

2239
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:10,500
What should we change?

2240
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,791
When I go to the movies,
you ask me if I went to watch the movie.

2241
02:01:12,791 --> 02:01:15,000
When I go to the hospital,
you ask me if I went to the hospital.

2242
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,291
When I go on a journey,
you ask me how my journey was.

2243
02:01:17,625 --> 02:01:19,333
Won’t you deviate from these regular dialogues?

2244
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:21,208
It’s because we had a safe journey,
that we are here.

2245
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,041
If there was an accident,
we would have called you up, right?

2246
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:25,416
That is why I keep saying
that things should change.

2247
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:27,125
These nonsensical things...
are always the same.

2248
02:01:27,833 --> 02:01:30,958
Nandini,
did he eat something weird on the way?

2249
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:32,333
He keeps talking nonsense.

2250
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:34,500
You already know about that nonsensical fellow, right?!

2251
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:38,333
Grandpa, how have you been?

2252
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,666
What’s happening?
You asked us all here to discuss something important.

2253
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,833
What are you going to say?

2254
02:01:45,875 --> 02:01:46,250
Damn!

2255
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:50,375
What did we actually want to discuss
after the function got over?

2256
02:01:50,625 --> 02:01:52,000
Your marriage with Nandini.

2257
02:01:54,583 --> 02:01:57,541
Because all the elders agreed to this proposal,
we have to exchange the auspicious offerings.

2258
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,041
What is this, dad?
How can I get married to Kishore?

2259
02:02:00,041 --> 02:02:01,000
I don’t like him.

2260
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:01,666
Nandu!

2261
02:02:01,666 --> 02:02:04,875
Even I don’t like you marrying this idiot
with a ghost-like face!

2262
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:06,541
He and his ghost-like face!

2263
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,041
Husband!
-What’s wrong with Kishore’s face?

2264
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:11,416
You can get married to him happily.

2265
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:13,708
I want to know what you mean by ghost-like later.

2266
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:14,916
Mask please.

2267
02:02:14,916 --> 02:02:15,833
It's ok, put that back in.

2268
02:02:16,416 --> 02:02:18,500
Nandu, so you won’t get married to me?

2269
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:20,958
Nandu, won’t you marry me?

2270
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:22,166
I won’t marry you.

2271
02:02:22,291 --> 02:02:24,375
Fine, then. I won’t marry you either.
Just do as you please.

2272
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:25,041
Good!

2273
02:02:26,041 --> 02:02:29,250
What do you mean?You convinced us
that you wanted to get married to Nandu.

2274
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:32,500
I like Nandini.
But she loves Balu.

2275
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,333
I understood that on our trip together.

2276
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:37,125
Well, If it’s up to me,
I will sit in the mandap hall, decked as a groom

2277
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:40,500
But that Balu,
sits in the halls of her heart.

2278
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:49,500
It was only yesterday that I found out
how much Balu loves you.

2279
02:02:50,416 --> 02:02:52,041
You like Nandini, right?

2280
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:55,916
Why didn’t you tell her that?

2281
02:02:57,666 --> 02:03:00,083
Some likes can be expressed with words.

2282
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:03,458
Some can only be expressed by the heart.

2283
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:07,541
I love Nandu
and I could only express it through my heart.

2284
02:03:08,083 --> 02:03:08,791
Why?

2285
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,875
Just as easily as I can accept her love,
It isn’t easy for aunty to accept me as her son-in-law.

2286
02:03:15,458 --> 02:03:16,625
Who cares if she approves?

2287
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:18,833
Just confess your love to Nandini
and she will leave her house and come to you.

2288
02:03:19,833 --> 02:03:23,375
Life partner should come from a family.
but she shouldn’t leave her family behind to come to me.

2289
02:03:25,291 --> 02:03:27,791
I am a kind of person who provides relatives to
people who lose their kin.

2290
02:03:28,916 --> 02:03:32,291
I don’t like the fact that Nandu would lose her
family because of me.

2291
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:36,708
But, are you okay with letting her go?

2292
02:03:38,416 --> 02:03:41,250
Loving someone does not mean having them beside us.

2293
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:43,083
It means having them in our hearts.

2294
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:48,416
Nandini will always be here.

2295
02:03:48,833 --> 02:03:52,125
Well now that I know that both of them
like each other that much,

2296
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:53,958
why would I get married to her?

2297
02:03:54,541 --> 02:03:55,958
That is why I changed my opinion.

2298
02:03:56,708 --> 02:04:01,666
All of you do that as well and only if you do that,
you will be just to both the mother and the daughter.

2299
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:03,250
The rest is up to you.

2300
02:04:05,708 --> 02:04:08,416
Yes, it would be good to get
Nandini and Balu married.

2301
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:10,458
I don’t think we could ever find a
better son-in-law than him.

2302
02:04:10,791 --> 02:04:11,458
Sir...
-No mask!

2303
02:04:12,291 --> 02:04:14,958
All this while, my inner thoughts
spilled out without filter.

2304
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:16,833
Now, I am aware of what I am saying.

2305
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:19,500
Nandu likes him, right.
Just agree to it, Mom.

2306
02:04:19,875 --> 02:04:22,458
Despite all that you people say,
I will not agree to this marriage.

2307
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:26,208
Are you a fixture here?

2308
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:27,833
You got a message. Take a look.

2309
02:04:28,333 --> 02:04:31,875
Why would you have a problem when
she wants to get married to the person she loves?

2310
02:04:33,625 --> 02:04:35,208
Did you tell them the entire story?

2311
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:39,250
I have my ego as well, right?

2312
02:04:39,583 --> 02:04:40,750
How will I agree then?

2313
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:42,708
So, you mean to say, you agreed later on?

2314
02:04:42,791 --> 02:04:43,583
No, they convinced me.

2315
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,708
The day that I agreed to their marriage,
we immediately got them engaged and got them married as well.

2316
02:04:48,708 --> 02:04:50,375
They got married as well.

2317
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:52,666
Your hero is really great.

2318
02:04:52,666 --> 02:04:54,458
He got all the relatives that he desired.

2319
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:57,583
And because he got married,
he became a husband as well.

2320
02:04:57,583 --> 02:04:59,375
The only thing that remains is being a father.

2321
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:00,833
I am giving him that position as well.

2322
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:02,125
I am 3 months pregnant.

2323
02:05:02,708 --> 02:05:03,958
Oh! Congratulations.

2324
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:05,166
Thank you.

2325
02:05:07,291 --> 02:05:07,833
Just a minute.

2326
02:05:09,125 --> 02:05:10,750
Hi, producer.
Where are you?

2327
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:12,916
They stopped the train at Yelamanchili station, hero.

2328
02:05:13,083 --> 02:05:15,666
Only when the track gets cleared,the train would resume its journey.

2329
02:05:15,666 --> 02:05:18,791
If there is a taxi outside,
just get in it and come here.

2330
02:05:18,916 --> 02:05:19,375
Okay, alright.

2331
02:05:53,125 --> 02:05:56,000
Master.What happened?
Why are you anxious?

2332
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,708
There is something wrong with her fortune.

2333
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:04,958
According to her chart,
she is likely to encounter that obstacle today.

2334
02:06:16,182 --> 02:06:17,098
Where is he?

2335
02:06:23,598 --> 02:06:26,557
Come on.
Did you see how large a family awaits you?

2336
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:30,223
Hey there! Come fast.
It’s already been late.

2337
02:06:31,432 --> 02:06:32,640
Grandpa! Why are you getting a hurry?

2338
02:06:34,444 --> 02:06:35,152
Come... come..

2339
02:07:50,694 --> 02:07:51,486
Hey...

2340
02:07:52,486 --> 02:07:54,902
Apparently, you supply some emotions.

2341
02:07:55,319 --> 02:07:57,902
Why didn’t you just mind your business
and why did you poke your nose into mine?

2342
02:07:59,277 --> 02:08:00,652
Is this your entire family?

2343
02:08:01,569 --> 02:08:03,527
Apparently, you are all
exchanging love and affection.

2344
02:08:03,527 --> 02:08:06,277
I am going to make sure you don’t have that love anymore.
I will give you death.

2345
02:10:10,569 --> 02:10:11,069
Dear...

2346
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:12,236
Balu...

2347
02:10:24,486 --> 02:10:25,361
Son...

2348
02:10:28,027 --> 02:10:29,152
Hey, leave her.

2349
02:10:29,444 --> 02:10:29,944
Nandu...

2350
02:10:30,111 --> 02:10:30,819
Balu...

2351
02:10:34,486 --> 02:10:34,986
Nandu...

2352
02:10:40,152 --> 02:10:41,152
Nandini...

2353
02:10:42,277 --> 02:10:42,777
Nandu...

2354
02:10:43,652 --> 02:10:44,152
Nandu...

2355
02:10:45,486 --> 02:10:45,986
Nandu...

2356
02:10:46,361 --> 02:10:46,861
Nandu...

2357
02:11:52,152 --> 02:11:52,652
Nandu...

2358
02:11:53,152 --> 02:11:53,652
Nandu...

2359
02:11:55,611 --> 02:11:56,111
Nandu...

2360
02:11:56,444 --> 02:11:56,944
Nandu...

2361
02:11:58,902 --> 02:11:59,402
Nandu...

2362
02:12:00,527 --> 02:12:01,569
Nandu... get up.

2363
02:12:01,902 --> 02:12:02,402
Nandu...

2364
02:12:13,652 --> 02:12:14,152
Nandu...

2365
02:12:23,652 --> 02:12:24,277
Balu...

2366
02:12:25,944 --> 02:12:26,569
Balu...

2367
02:12:28,277 --> 02:12:28,902
Balu...

2368
02:12:29,777 --> 02:12:30,402
Balu...

2369
02:12:51,527 --> 02:12:52,152
Balu...

2370
02:12:56,402 --> 02:12:57,027
Balu...

2371
02:13:00,236 --> 02:13:00,861
Balu...

2372
02:13:43,777 --> 02:13:44,361
Doctor...

2373
02:13:45,194 --> 02:13:46,569
We did our very best.

2374
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:47,944
The rest is up to god.

2375
02:13:49,027 --> 02:13:52,027
He will be conscious in a few minutes.
You can talk to him then.

2376
02:14:33,027 --> 02:14:33,861
Uncle...

2377
02:14:33,902 --> 02:14:36,402
You wanted a family of your own...

2378
02:14:36,986 --> 02:14:39,819
and today, you have every kind of kin that
you possibly wanted.

2379
02:14:41,652 --> 02:14:44,194
How can you leave us now and go?

2380
02:14:46,236 --> 02:14:47,236
How can you go?

2381
02:14:48,277 --> 02:14:48,777
Please...

2382
02:14:49,319 --> 02:14:50,444
... don’t leave us.

2383
02:14:51,319 --> 02:14:55,402
When I was alone,
everyone left me and went away.

2384
02:15:00,444 --> 02:15:02,236
And today,
I have so many people with me.

2385
02:15:03,319 --> 02:15:04,569
What more could I ask for?

2386
02:15:27,277 --> 02:15:28,486
Grandpa! Don't cry

2387
02:15:31,944 --> 02:15:33,069
I am sorry, aunt.

2388
02:15:33,819 --> 02:15:35,944
I am not really...
...my nephew, right?

2389
02:15:36,694 --> 02:15:37,486
Is that all?

2390
02:15:40,944 --> 02:15:45,944
For the past 20 years, people who raised me
couldn’t understand my love.

2391
02:15:46,777 --> 02:15:49,402
And my husband of 25 years
who understands me perfectly...

2392
02:15:50,569 --> 02:15:53,069
could never fulfil that lack of affection
from my parents’ end.

2393
02:15:54,111 --> 02:15:54,944
But you...

2394
02:15:55,236 --> 02:15:58,236
you figured out what I needed
just as soon as you saw me.

2395
02:15:59,194 --> 02:16:01,402
Who can be more of my kin than you?!

2396
02:16:02,861 --> 02:16:04,152
Even when my parents distanced me...

2397
02:16:04,694 --> 02:16:05,736
I accepted it.

2398
02:16:06,986 --> 02:16:11,527
But, when I realised that you are going away from me,
I am not able to take it.

2399
02:16:12,277 --> 02:16:12,986
Please...

2400
02:16:13,986 --> 02:16:15,277
Live for me.

2401
02:16:15,986 --> 02:16:18,402
Please live for all the people
who wish to have you in their life.

2402
02:16:23,986 --> 02:16:25,361
Why producer?
Why are you crying?

2403
02:16:26,777 --> 02:16:27,611
Come here.

2404
02:16:32,277 --> 02:16:33,986
Nothing happens to me.

2405
02:16:34,111 --> 02:16:39,069
When we say that a person is alive,
it does not mean that they are just physically alive.

2406
02:16:40,777 --> 02:16:42,944
Even when we are not alive,
we must survive in their memories...

2407
02:16:44,236 --> 02:16:45,652
survive in their words.

2408
02:16:46,194 --> 02:16:47,736
Even if I don’t survive...

2409
02:16:48,944 --> 02:16:52,694
I will remain in your words
and in your memories.

2410
02:16:56,444 --> 02:17:00,069
I will remain as your hero for you.

2411
02:17:01,152 --> 02:17:02,152
That’s enough for me.

2412
02:17:02,861 --> 02:17:03,861
That’s not enough for me.

2413
02:17:04,361 --> 02:17:05,361
That’s not enough for me.

2414
02:17:06,069 --> 02:17:08,027
I cannot live without you.

2415
02:17:10,777 --> 02:17:14,902
If something happens to you,
I will do something to myself and die.

2416
02:17:16,194 --> 02:17:18,486
I don’t want a life without you.

2417
02:17:18,902 --> 02:17:19,902
I don’t want it.

2418
02:17:26,111 --> 02:17:26,861
Producer!

2419
02:17:28,069 --> 02:17:28,777
Producer!

2420
02:17:29,652 --> 02:17:30,777
Don't say like that...

2421
02:17:33,319 --> 02:17:34,152
Listen to me.

2422
02:17:35,236 --> 02:17:39,486
If we die because someone we loved died...

2423
02:17:40,819 --> 02:17:42,402
no one would have stayed alive in this world.

2424
02:17:44,986 --> 02:17:46,277
Where will I go?

2425
02:17:49,027 --> 02:17:50,152
I will stay with you.

2426
02:17:51,736 --> 02:17:52,861
I will stay with you.

2427
02:18:36,069 --> 02:18:41,527
Any father gives his son,
material wealth as an inheritance.

2428
02:18:43,152 --> 02:18:47,652
But you have given our son relatives,
love and affection from kin.

2429
02:18:48,069 --> 02:18:50,944
Medicine is not the only thing that
helps a man survive.

2430
02:18:51,444 --> 02:18:52,277
Love does too.

2431
02:18:52,736 --> 02:18:55,861
All the love that people had
for my hero is what helped him survive.

2432
02:18:57,986 --> 02:18:59,069
Love you hero.

2433
02:19:03,277 --> 02:19:03,819
Hello...

2434
02:19:05,194 --> 02:19:05,861
Please tell me.

2435
02:19:09,277 --> 02:19:09,736
Ok.

2436
02:19:09,902 --> 02:19:11,819
Share us your location on What’sapp.
We will be there.

2437
02:19:13,444 --> 02:19:15,611
Let's go producer..
They want a son and daughter-in-law.

2438
02:19:16,402 --> 02:19:17,861
This time, I am the real wife.

2439
02:19:23,486 --> 02:19:25,986
If we want to develop a relationship
with someone...

2440
02:19:25,986 --> 02:19:27,819
If we want to give someone our love...

2441
02:19:28,069 --> 02:19:29,861
They don’t have to be related to us.

2442
02:19:30,194 --> 02:19:34,819
When we share love and affection with someone
who is lonely and seeks company,

2443
02:19:35,027 --> 02:19:38,861
they become our people and
they become the relatives of the heart.

2444
02:19:39,319 --> 02:19:43,111
When you stand with those people who are on the lookout
to build those kinds of bonds,

2445
02:19:43,194 --> 02:19:44,819
no one is alone any longer.

2446
02:19:45,111 --> 02:19:47,861
People who share love that way
are very good human beings.

2447
02:19:48,027 --> 02:19:51,407
This movie ‘Entha Manchivadavura’ (Good Fellow)
is dedicated to such good human beings.
