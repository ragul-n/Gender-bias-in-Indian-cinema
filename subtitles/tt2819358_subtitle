1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,041
FF

2
02:19:14,041 --> 02:19:14,083
LF

3
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,791
The jewellery box lay safe and sound
deep inside the chest

4
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,916
Who knew that it would tumble out
& stir a hornet's nest?

5
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,583
Ta ra rum pum pum pum para!

6
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,250
In the storm it went asunder!

7
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,750
And lo! Behold! There tumbled out
some very strange events !

8
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,041
From the jewellery box...

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,708
...that all along lay
safe inside the chest!

10
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,041
But what is there in the box?

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,791
Oh no! Oh no!
Best not to know!

12
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,250
Just let the matter rest

13
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,916
That box is such a pest!

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,416
The jewellery box that all
along lay safe inside the chest!

15
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,333
If it must be told,
a chain of gold...

16
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,041
...a 100 grams or more...

17
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,916
...friends & foes
and loves & woes...

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,583
...& secret tales of yore...

19
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,666
... & rugs in dreams...

20
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,000
...that turn to trees
never seen before!

21
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,416
In the box there is a story!

22
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,208
In the box there is a story...

23
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,750
...bursting to be free!

24
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,208
So the magic cat swings wide its tail,
runs up the magic tree!

25
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,500
The tail is quite a rocker!
The old crone grabs her hookah!

26
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,791
In a snap, she starts a stream
before you can count to three!

27
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,208
The magic cat swings wide
its tail up in the magic tree

28
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,208
But that's not all, three vessels tall
come floating down the stream

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,583
Their sails are all aflutter,
but what is this we have here!

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,833
The sails have turned to sarees!

31
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,583
The sails have turned to sarees...

32
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,791
...stairs come down in a flurry!

33
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:10,583
Pots and pails and cats with tails
come hurtling with a clatter!

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,208
Whatever is the matter?

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,750
If a sail can be a saree,
why not a tail a rose?

36
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,625
& bloom and turn to letters lost,
made up of loves and woes

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:29,125
Lost letters full of woes....

38
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,541
Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!

39
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
There goes the bell, you hear?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,125
What tumbled out must tumble in,
scurrying back in fear!

41
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,583
Is the box just full of jewels?

42
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:44,458
So all these things we've
all been seeing, nothing is for real?

43
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,666
Is the box just full of jewels?

44
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,916
Oh no! Oh no! Best not to know,
just let the matter rest

45
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,375
That box of yarns with twists & turns
were best inside the chest!

46
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,541
That box is such a pest!

47
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,500
The box had originally belonged
to my Pishi-thakuma...

48
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,833
... that is, my father's aunt.
Rasmoni!

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,500
She'd got it
as part of her dowry

50
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,500
Rasmoni had been married
at the age of 11

51
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,458
By 12 she was a widow

52
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,916
She never went back
to her in-laws' home again

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,458
No! No!
Don't cut my hair!

54
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,750
They say she had been
a great beauty in her time

55
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,541
And vain too!

56
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,916
Her brothers had spoilt her...

57
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,416
...to make up for
her early widowhood

58
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Rasmoni! Rasu!

59
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:21,416
Come down,
your food's been served!

60
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,416
C-o-m-i-n-g!

61
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,541
Hmph!

62
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,750
Food's been served!

63
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,583
Just hear them!

64
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,708
As though they've laid out a feast!

65
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,416
All they'll serve me
is that awful widows' fare!

66
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
Ghastly vegetarian stuff!

67
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,416
I'm coming!

68
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,125
...coconut pattern 1 pair...

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,333
... so that's that...

70
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,958
... ruby studded - 1 pair...

71
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,875
So, 28 pairs of bangles...

72
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,166
...19 pairs of earrings...

73
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,291
One can't be too careful!

74
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:10,166
They're all waiting like vultures
to get their filthy hands on my box!

75
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,250
She was said to have developed
a terrible temper in her old age

76
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,291
Her brothers' wives
were terrified of her moods!

77
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:27,250
How I came to own her box of jewels...

78
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
...is a long story

79
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,791
We'd have to go back to 1949,
2 years after India's Independence

80
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,708
By then Bengal had been divided up
between India and Pakistan

81
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,750
My grandparents had left
their ancestral home in Faridpur...

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,750
...to come & live in West Bengal

83
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,708
Soon after, my mother
arrived here as a bride

84
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,750
Sister look ! A real brick house!

85
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,750
A mansion!

86
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,750
The matchmaker was right!

87
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,166
You've married royalty!

88
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,583
Rasu!

89
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,708
Rasmoni!

90
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,958
Chandan and his bride have
come for your blessings

91
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,708
Ugh!

92
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,500
That awful cat again!

93
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,083
Get rid of it someone!

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,625
Unlucky creature!

95
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,750
Chandan!

96
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,958
Too big for your boots
after marriage, huh?

97
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,708
Chase the brute away at once!

98
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,666
It's gone...

99
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,708
Good!

100
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:12,541
Your husband's aunt.
Go touch her feet, dear

101
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:19,333
Hey Chandu! The girl's
family is penniless I believe?

102
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,000
There!

103
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,458
You're a jackass, Chandu!

104
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,625
Must've been your mother
who made the match?

105
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,875
No wonder!

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,291
She too, is from
this side of the border!

107
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Her own folk are
as poor as field mice!

108
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,583
What're you standing for?

109
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,625
Need an invitation to sit?

110
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,500
Now then, let's see your face!

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,416
Hmm! Natural or make-up?

112
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
Now for your hair!

113
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,875
Nothing to write home about!

114
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,416
Before I became a widow,
my hair was long enough to sit on!

115
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,416
Chandu...

116
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,625
...fetch that photograph!

117
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,708
Taken when I was eleven...

118
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,583
...by a British lady photographer

119
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,583
Alright...now for the actual...

120
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
Yes! Yes! I know!

121
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,583
I suppose you're expecting
some jewellery from me?

122
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,583
No, no!

123
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,583
Stop acting coy!

124
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,333
Too heavy!

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,791
Here you are!

126
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,000
Ever seen the likes of these
at your father's?

127
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,583
These are Burmese rubies!
Belonged to my grandma!

128
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,791
Keep them carefully, understand?

129
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,583
Now off with you!

130
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,583
Wasted enough time!

131
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,791
Ruby studded bangles - cancelled!

132
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,791
Just look at that!

133
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,458
Got him tied to her apron
strings already! Shameless hussy!

134
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Saw that?

135
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,750
Measly gold chain for me
& Burmese rubies for her!

136
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,458
Let it go...

137
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,500
I put up lights wherever you asked!

138
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,208
I must at least cover costs, Sir!

139
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,375
-Shut up you swine!
You and your false accounts!

140
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,541
-No point shouting, Sir

141
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,708
Clear my dues & I'll leave.
- Get out! That's all you'll get!

142
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,541
Bring it here!

143
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,458
Take this & get lost!

144
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,708
If I'd known I'd get a bed
in lieu of payment, Sir...

145
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,500
...I wouldn't have accepted the contract!
- Oh go on !

146
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,458
Don't flaunt contracts!

147
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,375
Have you ever seen a piece
like this in your life ?

148
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,666
A genuine antique!

149
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,666
Real Burma teak!

150
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,625
Know what that means?

151
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,666
The British hunt for
pieces like this nowadays!

152
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,083
So I have to go hunting
for the British now?

153
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,250
They left 2 years ago, Sir.
For good!

154
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,125
Where do I find them?

155
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,666
Silence, you ill-mannered oaf!

156
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,666
Rambilas!

157
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,083
Rambilas!
-Sir?

158
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,666
Listen!

159
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,666
That antique carpet in the hall...
- The big one?

160
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,083
Fetch it!
- Yes Sir!

161
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,166
Go!

162
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,333
Useless bunch!

163
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,625
Give this swine the damned carpet...

164
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,500
...& throw him out on his ear!

165
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,208
Yes! Yes! Give it all away!

166
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,625
All our land is in Pakistan now,
with no one to look after it!

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,916
Why keep anything here either?

168
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,125
So many creditors
still waiting in line!

169
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,083
Watch out for potholes!

170
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,500
Careful! Don't scratch it!

171
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,416
- It's real Burma teak!
- Oh no!

172
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,166
Gone!

173
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,166
What's the din about?
Who passes?

174
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,958
A bed, brother!

175
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,541
A bed? All by itself!

176
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,125
No brother...

177
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,333
...a carpet accompanies it!

178
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,583
I see!

179
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,541
Ask them to pass quietly!

180
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:47,291
Lost my catch because of them!
Nuisance!

181
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,000
So...

182
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,958
...now you know all!

183
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,125
Get your husband in hand
while there's still time...

184
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,000
...make a man out of him!

185
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,208
Let go, & he'll spend
the rest of his days lazing!

186
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,583
M-m-me?

187
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,541
Who else?

188
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,875
You're still a novelty for him;
so he'll heed your words

189
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,458
But he's s-so much older than me!

190
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:21,500
Supposing he g-gets angry?

191
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,083
Stop stammering!

192
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,333
What're you scared of?

193
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,916
Know how much older than me
your father-in-law is?

194
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,541
At least 20 years!
So?

195
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,166
Mustn't give so much importance
to men's moods!

196
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,541
In any case...

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,416
...better an angry husband
than a poor one!

198
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,291
Your t-tea!

199
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,500
How well you p-play!

200
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,708
So you like music?
-Yes

201
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:37,916
Can you sing?

202
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,750
N-no

203
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,375
Unfortunate!

204
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,708
Anyway...
get me my kurta, will you?

205
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,708
Will you be going out?

206
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,708
Can anyone go out in this?
Where's the silk one?

207
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,166
You go out almost every evening...

208
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,875
...w-w-where do you go?

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,708
Why?

210
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,208
Do I have to answer to you?

211
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,250
No, no!
Of course not!

212
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,125
I was just...

213
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
Hm!

214
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,250
Any more questions?

215
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,333
Only one...

216
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,583
...wh-who provides for me here?
I m-mean...

217
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:57,333
...who bears the
h-h-ousehold expenses?

218
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,666
I haven't the faintest idea!

219
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,500
You are being provided for,
aren't you?

220
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,500
Indeed!

221
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,458
Look...

222
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,500
...it's not me or my brother!

223
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,916
I'm sure you know that!
And it's not my father either

224
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,083
Men in our family
haven't worked for generations

225
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:22,083
We're landlords. Landed gentry.
Understood?

226
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,166
Oh! Then we must be
having a lot of l-l-land, right?

227
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,791
Of course!
I mean, I'm sure we do...

228
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,375
Where?

229
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,000
What do you mean?

230
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,791
I'd...I'd love to see it...

231
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,416
Oh dear!

232
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,125
Are you a wife?
Or an assessing officer!

233
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,583
It's all in Pakistan.
How do I show it to you?

234
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,125
Any more queries?
- N-n-no...

235
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,500
Thank heaven!

236
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,708
Demanding to see land!
The absurdity of it!

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,875
See you!

238
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:04,500
EF

239
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:32,083
There! Your kite's gone!

240
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,166
Hello! Remember me?

241
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,291
No, you don't!

242
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,541
I'm Reba!

243
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,625
Dressed you up for the wedding,
remember?

244
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:21,166
Our fathers-in-law are cousins

245
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,625
I remember now

246
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,500
So how are you?

247
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,541
Made friends with your husband yet?

248
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,250
Why haven't you come
to visit us since?

249
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,625
Just listen to her!

250
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,166
Don't you know anything?
There's a court case on!

251
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,916
Our families are fighting a case...

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,458
...over the possession of this
house!

253
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,875
It's all right to socialise
at weddings and festivals...

254
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,416
...but on a day-to-day basis,
we're supposed to be enemies!

255
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,125
Got that?

256
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,833
What a sweet child! Your son?

257
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,166
Good heavens, no!

258
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,791
My mother-in-law would
have a fit if she heard you!

259
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,333
This is Benu...

260
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
...short for Banwarilaal!

261
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,125
That's his mother there -

262
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,750
Etwaari!

263
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,208
Yes ma'am?

264
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,208
Take him away!
Such a whiner!

265
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,791
Come baby.

266
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,500
Don't you know her?

267
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,333
Her husband is your
father-in-law's servant!

268
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,875
Rambilas...?

269
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,541
You're still new here...

270
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,125
...you'll get to know
everyone soon enough!

271
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,125
You know...

272
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,083
...they say the men in your family...

273
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,666
...killed Benu's grandfather
in a fit of rage!

274
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,750
So, to atone for their sin...

275
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,083
...they've looked after
his family since then!

276
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,333
What?

277
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,125
M-m-murder!

278
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,833
Who knows?

279
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,375
It was all such along time ago!

280
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,541
But there was no
police case or anything!

281
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,083
Said he fell down the stairs
& broke his neck!

282
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:57,375
It was...something to do
with your husband's aunt...

283
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:03,083
...the old lady with the box of jewels!

284
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,458
Quick! Come and see something!

285
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,791
Come!

286
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,041
Your father-in-law!

287
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,041
& there's mine!

288
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,750
Guess where they've been?

289
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,041
Where?
- At court!

290
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,958
To fight the case!

291
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,125
They travel together
because it's cheaper!

292
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,708
They can share the carriage fare!

293
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,166
Once they reach the court,
they go their separate ways...

294
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,041
...& fight each other over the house!

295
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,041
Then they come back together
gossiping merrily...

296
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,500
...& chewing betel!

297
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,041
P-i-ishima -

298
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,291
Pishima!

299
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,250
Don't worry, I'm dead alright!
- Oh my God!

300
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,208
Wait!

301
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,000
No need to go blabbing
to them at once!

302
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:15,458
They'll come rushing up
the moment they hear, the vultures!

303
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,916
I know what's on your mind!

304
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,916
Good riddance, you'll all be
saying!

305
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,916
Now you'll come
& occupy my rooms...

306
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,791
...& divide up my jewellery!

307
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,791
But I'll have none of that, you hear?

308
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,916
Tell that jackass husband of yours...

309
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,250
...that he'd better not think
of living up here!

310
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,750
Else he'll die before the week's out!

311
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,250
Don't gape like an idiot!

312
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,333
Hurry up! Untie the keys
from my saree!

313
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,125
Come here!

314
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,750
Don't worry, I won't wring your neck!

315
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,208
Not yet!

316
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,708
Untie the keys!

317
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,958
Idiot!

318
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,625
Can a ghost have
real keys on her?

319
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,833
Take them from my corpse!

320
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,458
Done?

321
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,333
Now go to the other room

322
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:41,833
Go!

323
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,375
Pricked your foot?

324
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,541
Serves you right!

325
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,875
Rushing up with that mirror
to see if I am good & dead!

326
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:00,541
There's a chest near the window

327
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,583
Take the big iron key from the ring...

328
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,541
...the big one!

329
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,583
Now unlock the chest!

330
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,250
Hurry up!

331
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,500
Look underneath the woollens ...

332
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,666
...you'll find a wooden box
wrapped in a shawl!

333
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Yes!

334
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,166
Now lock the chest and fetch the box!

335
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,666
Hurry! Hurry!

336
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,750
This...?

337
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,416
Yes!

338
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,541
That's the one they're after,
the vultures!

339
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,500
Now listen carefully!

340
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,458
Hide the box so that
not a soul will know!

341
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,500
Think I'm gifting it to you?

342
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,666
Bullshit!

343
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,791
Just making sure they don't
grab my precious jewellery!

344
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,166
Open it!

345
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,458
There's over 5000 grams of gold!

346
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,458
A 100 gram g-g-old chain...

347
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,166
I'm warning you!

348
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:50,125
Not a speck of gold must
be missing!

349
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,333
If you ever so much as
try on a single piece...

350
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:59,541
...I'll make you a widow
by wringing your husband's neck...

351
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,416
...and sucking his life blood dry!

352
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,416
That'll end your hopes of
ever wearing jewellery again!

353
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,666
Got that, you moron?
-Y-yes...

354
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,041
Now hurry!

355
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:14,000
Tie my bunch of keys back!

356
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,416
No one must suspect that
they'd been taken!

357
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:34,041
Quick!
I hear footsteps!

358
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,375
Goodness! Is she woman or a horse?

359
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,958
Galloping off like...

360
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,583
Wait! What was that bulge
under her saree?

361
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,958
What's this? Lata!

362
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,416
Where are you?

363
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,875
Lata-

364
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,833
Lata!

365
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,875
Who? Who? Who?
What? What?

366
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,666
Why are you lying in the dark?
What's the matter?

367
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,458
Nothing...I...

368
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:10,208
I had a headache. So...

369
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,250
Well, listen...

370
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:17,250
...there's some bad news!

371
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,458
W-w-what?

372
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:20,833
Pishima...

373
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,458
...our aunt who lived upstairs...

374
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,833
...she's kicked the bucket

375
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,833
What!
- I mean...

376
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,833
...she's died. Passed away!

377
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,541
Everyone's upstairs.
We should go too...

378
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,083
Unfavourable planetary position?

379
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,125
Yes sir!

380
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,750
At that time Saturn was in the ...

381
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,541
Found the box?
Hunt! Hunt!

382
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,625
The jewellery box!

383
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,208
I'm trying to find it...

384
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:06,125
Oh, there you are at last!

385
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Come on, pay your last respects.

386
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,791
What's there to cry so much about?

387
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,500
Oh my God!

388
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,583
A saree!

389
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,208
Not there?

390
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,958
- What do you mean?
- Why not?

391
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,208
Who's that?

392
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,625
Nothing here, Sir!

393
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,916
Jewellery box! Ha!

394
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,833
Nothing at all!

395
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,083
Shut up you swine!

396
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,333
Look again

397
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,041
Yes! Yes! Keep searching!

398
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,416
Does he think we've stolen it?
- Calm down!

399
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,125
Waste of time!
- But Father..

400
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,583
Useless lot!

401
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,291
Suspecting our sons' wives too?

402
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,791
This is too much!

403
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,958
Actually Father, I was saying...

404
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,916
No use searching this room!

405
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,458
I know who's taken it!

406
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,458
Wait! Wait!

407
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,625
What's that?

408
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,666
I'll check...

409
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,791
Nothing here!
Take the key

410
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,041
What do you think you're doing?

411
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,750
Trashing the whole house!

412
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,958
Don't worry

413
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,583
I know who's taken the box
even if no one else does!

414
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,000
I'll show them!

415
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,416
Absolutely useless!

416
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,333
Move, I'll take a look...

417
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,041
Don't just stand there!

418
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,166
Lift the damn lid!

419
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,291
I'm lifting it!

420
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,625
Don't touch this chest!
It's possessed I tell you!

421
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,666
Leave it alone

422
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,375
Pishima must have hidden
her box somewhere

423
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,000
Leave it alone?
Nonsense!

424
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,583
Useless idiots!

425
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,500
I will not let it go

426
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,708
Here you!

427
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,750
Go and call the police at once!

428
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,125
My hands...

429
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,625
What're you whining for?

430
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Come on!

431
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,166
Sir, I don't know anything Sir!

432
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,958
Let me go Sir! Please!

433
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,958
Master! It's not my fault Master!

434
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:17,958
I swear to you...

435
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,000
Sir, let my husband go!
He's innocent!

436
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,333
Don't spare them!

437
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,958
A couple of blows and
it will all come pouring out!

438
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,541
Criminals in the house!

439
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:28,958
Unbelievable!

440
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,000
Where have you hidden it?

441
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,333
M-m-eaning...?

442
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,333
Hope you haven't hawked
the jewellery already!

443
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,708
Why are you saying this?

444
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,916
Don't act dumb!

445
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,708
Who else would steal them?

446
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,125
Ever seen so much gold in your life?

447
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:59,625
Are you saying that
because I'm poor?

448
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,916
You're a dangerous one!

449
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:06,625
Wouldn't be surprised if you
poisoned the old crone yourself!

450
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,333
Anyway, now that you have
stolen the jewellery,

451
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,583
I want half the booty

452
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,375
All of 2500 grams!

453
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,708
Got that?

454
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,166
I haven't told anyone about you...

455
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,000
...& I don't intend to!

456
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,416
If you listen
to me, that is!

457
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,250
Or else I'll tell the cops that...

458
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,291
...I saw you run down the stairs
with the box...

459
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,291
The cook is also a witness!

460
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,000
You'll be charged with theft and murder...

461
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,875
...handcuffed & dragged to jail!

462
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,125
What're you looking at ?

463
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,250
Now what ?

464
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,458
Why have you turned so pale?

465
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,291
Scared...

466
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,833
That takes care of her!

467
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:47,458
This is the strangest case
I have ever seen!

468
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,916
Her paralysis is restricted
to the tongue!

469
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,375
Just the tongue!

470
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,000
Amazing!

471
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,541
What on earth is the matter?
- What is it, child?

472
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,416
What are you saying,
sister-in-law ?

473
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,416
It's no use, I tell you!

474
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,625
It's impossible for her
to say anything!

475
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,500
I've told you...

476
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,583
...speech is severely impaired!

477
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,708
But a sudden
recovery may be possible

478
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,833
Since there are no signs
of any physical cause...

479
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:30,416
...it must be the result of
severe mental shock

480
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,875
No, no, I think she wants
to say something

481
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,375
If she can't speak,
let her write it

482
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,750
Here, take this -

483
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,000
Write it down!

484
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:55,916
J...

485
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,416
My God!

486
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,333
Paralysis has just now spread
to the hand as well!

487
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,583
Meaning?

488
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,500
No sensation there either!

489
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,708
But she tried to write something!

490
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:28,625
'J!'

491
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,791
Mmm! Smells delicious!

492
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,333
What're you cooking?

493
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,375
Shuntki? (dried fish)

494
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,291
M-m-mutton

495
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,291
Liar!

496
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,500
It's  Shuntki  for sure!
I can tell from the smell!

497
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:34,791
We d-d-don't eat Shuntki!

498
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,250
We d-d-don't eat Shuntki!

499
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,250
Think you're royalty, huh?

500
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,083
Why don't you eat it?

501
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,250
But of course!

502
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,041
You come from a poor family
from this side of the border!

503
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,958
They used to make delicious
shuntki in our Faridpur home!

504
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,250
With onion and garlic...

505
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,583
...& fiery chillies!

506
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,708
It's been so long!

507
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,666
Can't even remember the taste!

508
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,250
What're you cooking it with?

509
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,666
Garlic and chillies?

510
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,583
Mmm!
What an aroma!

511
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,083
Will you taste some?

512
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:21,000
I m-e-ean if you're able...

513
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,166
Want some?

514
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,958
Ass!

515
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,208
I may be a ghost but
I'm still a widow!

516
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:41,250
May I say s-s-omething?

517
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,958
You may

518
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,583
It wasn't right, what you did!

519
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,208
What?

520
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,916
What you did to m-m-my
sister-in-law

521
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,541
Poor thing!

522
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,958
My my! Soul of kindness!

523
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,000
Why shouldn't I do what I did
to that bitch?

524
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:05,416
She'd have sold my jewellery
like a shot!

525
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,125
I know her kind!

526
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,958
You haven't salted the mutton.
- Really? I thought I had...

527
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,833
Enjoy it!

528
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,333
Enjoy all the fish and meat you can...

529
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,166
...while there's still time!

530
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,583
You have only another couple
of months!

531
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,875
What do you m-mean?

532
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,666
You're going to be
a widow very soon

533
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,500
W-what are you saying Pishima!

534
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,208
Why should that happen ?

535
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,500
And why not?

536
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,208
Pleased as punch
because of a doting husband!

537
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,500
Now you'll see!

538
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,416
Why are you c-cursing me
Pishima?

539
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,125
What have I d-done?

540
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,458
What sin have I committed?

541
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,291
And what sin had I committed?
Tell me!

542
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,291
Are you pregnant?

543
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:55,458
No...I don't know

544
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,458
If you are,
your child will die too!

545
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,416
Don't you dare sleep
with your husband!

546
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,208
Sleep separately.
Got that, shameless hussy?

547
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,458
No salt in the mutton.
Salt it! Salt it!

548
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:16,208
- Call this cooking?
- What's wrong?

549
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,666
Full of salt!

550
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,458
Is there any milk?

551
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,458
What were you doing? Sleeping?

552
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,166
Serves you right!

553
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,041
So proud of your culinary skills!

554
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,416
What happened to you today?

555
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,250
The mutton was inedible!

556
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,250
You're usually a good cook...

557
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:43,125
...yesterday's food was fine

558
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:47,375
But...what's wrong with you?
Are you sick or what?

559
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:49,583
Listen!

560
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:54,208
Do you believe in g-g-ghosts?

561
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,458
Hmm...

562
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,125
...can't say for sure

563
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,625
Why?

564
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,416
Have you seen any?

565
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:06,416
Yes

566
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,208
Oh God! No!

567
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,166
What's the matter?

568
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,250
Please! Let go!

569
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,250
I must sleep separately!

570
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,958
Over there...on the floor

571
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,875
Are you mad?

572
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,375
I can't sleep alone!

573
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,083
If you sleep on the floor,
I'm coming with you!

574
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,125
What!

575
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,333
Alright, let go...
I'll stay here.

576
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,458
...today is the 27th of September.
- Oh dear me!

577
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,375
Promise me that you'll be...

578
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,875
...very c-c-careful for
the next two months?

579
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,458
I will! I will!

580
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,375
Promise you'll never leave me?

581
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,458
Where will I go?

582
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,333
You're the one who is
threatening to leave!

583
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,125
Come closer!

584
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,083
Help me God!
Oh God! God! God!

585
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:48,500
God! God!
God! God!

586
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,041
Hey there!

587
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:14,750
Idiot! I'm here!

588
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,333
How does it feel?

589
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,333
How does what feel?

590
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,333
Don't act coy!

591
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,250
Do I have to spell it out?

592
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,291
What you do with that jackass
at night!

593
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,041
Pishima please!

594
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,791
My! Aren't we bashful!

595
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,291
What's wrong in asking?

596
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:40,500
Married at 11, widowed by 12!

597
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,541
By the time my body awoke...

598
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,500
...I was living a
barren life
with my head shaved...

599
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,500
...eating vegetarian fare
and fasting!

600
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:48,958
What would you know?

601
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,708
Tell me, how does it feel?

602
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,916
Good.

603
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,041
Stupid bitch!

604
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,958
Everyone knows that!

605
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,708
Give me some details, woman!

606
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,000
Pishima please!

607
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,625
So complacent!

608
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:06,291
If I hadn't been a child widow...

609
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:08,791
...I too would have made
a very loving wife!

610
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:12,041
But he was already middle-aged
when he married me...

611
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,916
...& consumptive on top of that!
Died before you could say hoot!

612
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,291
And if he were alive?

613
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,750
Ah then!

614
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,916
I would have him tied
to my apron strings...

615
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,625
...wouldn't have let him
out of my sight!

616
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,958
Would have cooked & cleaned...

617
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,208
...& cared for him!

618
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:33,916
Come on, girl!

619
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,750
Tell me!

620
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,833
Bitch!

621
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,500
So it's ok to do it,
but not to talk about it!

622
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,333
I'll destroy that complacence of yours!

623
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,333
Just 2 more months, remember!

624
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,833
Die, you bitch! Die!

625
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,458
Rot in hell!

626
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,291
Die! The whole lot of you!

627
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,208
Die...

628
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,875
Die...

629
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,375
Die...

630
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:41,708
Any news of Rasmoni's box?

631
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,166
Nothing...

632
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,541
...seems to have vanished magically!

633
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,791
The cops couldn't get anything
out of those two idiots...

634
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,791
...so they let them go!

635
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,375
The date for the hearing is close

636
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:59,125
Do you have money for the trial?

637
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:03,250
Or have you decided
to give us the house?

638
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,583
You're living in a fool's paradise!

639
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,458
Not that easy, brother!

640
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,833
I'll raise the money all right!

641
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,208
Really?

642
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:23,708
I'm selling some property in Pakistan.
It's almost done

643
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,333
Check!

644
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Before eyeing the house...

645
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,791
... you'd better save your rook!

646
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,125
Trying to scare me off!

647
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,250
What a shame!

648
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,791
Everything's going...everything!

649
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,000
Shame!

650
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,750
Shame on me!

651
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,708
Couldn't save a thing! Shame!

652
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,583
Oh my goodness!

653
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:05,791
Oh, Lata!

654
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,250
Can you do me a favour?

655
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,875
Can you please knock this table
from under me?

656
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,208
What!

657
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,916
Don't try to stop me!

658
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,458
I won't live this life anymore!

659
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,000
Mother is right!

660
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,333
I am no good!
What the English call worthless!

661
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,041
What are you saying!

662
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:28,333
Do you know
how much I respect you?

663
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,500
Respect me!
Whatever for?

664
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,250
Can we talk
with you up there?

665
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,875
Come down, I'll tell you

666
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,125
??

667
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,750
You're not trying to trick me?

668
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,291
Never!

669
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,083
I'll come down since you ask...

670
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,916
...but I'm warning you Lata!

671
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,375
Don't think you can trick me!

672
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,250
If I find...

673
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:52,166
Very well. If you
don't like what I say...

674
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:54,125
...you can always climb up again

675
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,291
The table will be right here

676
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,625
Hear me out first...

677
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,666
Yes, but...

678
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,791
...how exactly do I get down?

679
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,583
What if I get strangled?
I mean...

680
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,833
...by accident?

681
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,000
Oh!

682
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,333
First untie the cloth from the beam

683
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,208
Go on...done?
-Yes

684
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,750
Now climb down

685
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,583
I'll hold the table

686
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,166
Hold it tightly!

687
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,750
You are only a woman...will you manage ?
- YWs...now come down

688
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,375
Okay...

689
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,500
Now say what you have to

690
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,958
But be careful, Lata!

691
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,416
If you dare ridicule me...

692
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:01,125
I have got an idea!

693
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,375
I'll tell you, but...

694
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:12,541
...you mustn't tell anyone yet!

695
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:47,333
See!

696
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,333
So much money?

697
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,166
For our shop!

698
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,125
Business capital?

699
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:59,916
But where did the money...?

700
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:02,791
I mean you're
just a housewife!

701
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,333
How did you...?

702
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,500
May I ask you something first?

703
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:08,708
Now what?

704
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:18,291
You do t-t-trust me?

705
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,291
Don't you?

706
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,291
I do, but...

707
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:25,833
Then trust me,
I've done nothing wrong

708
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,500
I swear on you!

709
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,791
Do you believe me?

710
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,291
Yes, but...

711
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,541
Now tell me...

712
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,625
...what will you name the shop?

713
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,291
Whatever you wish

714
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,625
Really ?

715
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,291
Of course!

716
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,666
You are my...

717
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,708
...lucky mascot!

718
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,333
Madam...

719
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:07,250
...shall I take this up
to your sister-in-law?

720
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,541
Yes please

721
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,375
Low born bitch!

722
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,916
How dare you!

723
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,625
I'll destroy your entire family!

724
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:22,916
Ohh! That hurts!

725
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,708
It's supposed to!

726
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,416
I'll break your neck!

727
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,333
Thought you could fool me, huh?

728
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,583
This morning...

729
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:33,583
...as I was relaxing in the
bamboo grove...

730
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,833
...who do I see but Manik Seth's wife...

731
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,500
...walking towards me, jug in hand...

732
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,708
...with my heavy gold chain
around her neck!

733
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,208
Recognized it instantly!

734
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:47,208
Betel-chewing bitch!

735
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,208
How dare you touch my jewellery?

736
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,541
Please forgive me this time!

737
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,208
I took just that one chain...

738
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:06,750
...besides, I didn't sell,
merely p-p-pawned it!

739
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:10,166
P-p-pawned it!
What a great favour!

740
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,625
Pawned goods never come back!

741
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,166
Think I don't know that much,
being part of this family?

742
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:18,041
Stupid, low-born creature!

743
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,166
Give me some time, let the business ...

744
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,291
Oh God!

745
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,375
Believe me, Pishima

746
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,166
...I will get your chain back...

747
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,541
...just give me some time...

748
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,166
...once the business grows, I'll...

749
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,541
Your shop will never work!

750
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,041
Stupid bitch!

751
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,083
You dare turn my nephew
into a shopkeeper!

752
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,416
Your business won't last
for 2 days, I tell you!

753
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:45,291
You'll die of leprosy!
You'll die of cholera!

754
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,666
No one will give you a drop of
water at your deathbed!

755
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,708
They'll stuff you in the
dirtiest corner of hell!

756
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,166
I'll destroy your entire family!

757
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,333
May your husband die!
May his father die!

758
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:59,458
If you conceive a child,
may it die too!

759
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:03,208
May everything turn
to ash around you!

760
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,333
Wretched woman!

761
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:09,291
I'll devastate everything!
Just wait & see!

762
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:13,250
One bitch pawns my jewellery..

763
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:18,125
...& the other wears it
to go for a crap!

764
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,166
Such audacity!

765
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,458
Earthquake?

766
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,208
But I didn't feel it upstairs?

767
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,916
Why, cousin...

768
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,083
...what're you carting
in those bundles?

769
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,500
These?

770
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,833
Er...

771
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,083
...just laundered clothes

772
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,083
That much?

773
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,083
Come!

774
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,833
Sleep on the bed...

775
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,916
...or you'll get a stiff neck!

776
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,666
See you...

777
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:42,041
Mitra Saree Corner

778
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:51,000

Lovely Saree Stores

782
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:32,083
What's wrong ?
Don't like any?

783
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,625
Rasmoni Saree Stores

784
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,625
Congratulations on your shop sir!

785
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:38,666
Here have some sweets -

786
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:46,541
Visit us again please!

787
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,416
What!

788
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,166
A shop?

789
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:59,000
A son of this family
turned shopkeeper!

790
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:00,500
Yes Sir...

791
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,666
...I've just come from there!

792
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,875
Rashmoni Saree Stores.

793
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,833
Named it after Rasu!

794
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:07,833
Yes Sir...

795
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:10,750
All lit up with dynamo chargers!

796
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,916
Quite a show!

797
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,083
He's a disgrace!

798
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,833
Plotting this all along!

799
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:18,500
Wait!

800
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:20,833
Capital?

801
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,083
From where did that come?

802
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,541
I didn't part with a penny!

803
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,833
Er...

804
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,833
I hear...

805
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,833
...that Somlata...

806
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,333
...sold her jewellery and
gave the money to Chandan!

807
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:35,708
Jewellery?

808
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:36,833
Ha!

809
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,833
She came here with only...

810
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,833
...2 thin pairs of
bangles on each wrist!

811
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:42,833
Some jewellery!

812
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,000
That means...

813
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,875
...she's gone & sold
the jewellery we gave her?

814
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:50,791
Wait!

815
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,458
I'll teach her a lesson...

816
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,291
Don't say anything just yet

817
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,875
Wait & see for a while

818
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,625
It's not that easy to run a business!

819
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,791
The shop will wind up soon

820
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,625
Your son and his wife...

821
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,458
...will come back shamefaced

822
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,250
There won't be any need for words!

823
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,375
Pishima!

824
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,250
Pishima!

825
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,166
P-i-ishima!

826
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,750
Are you there ?

827
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,750
What is it?

828
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,791
You can't just order me
around like a queen!

829
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:52,500
From where I live these days...
...travelling up & down
takes time!

830
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,250
I've got your chain back!

831
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,708
Really!

832
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,583
Let's see?

833
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:14,708
Ugh!

834
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,416
Wash it! Wash it!

835
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,833
...& then sprinkle it
with holy water...

836
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,458
...& put it back in the box!

837
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:21,708
Didn't I tell you...

838
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,291
...Manik Seth's wife took a crap...

839
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,708
...with that chain on!

840
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:28,291
Fancy that!

841
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,166
So your shop's doing well!

842
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,250
Where is it located?

843
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,625
In the New Bazaar

844
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:49,541
Not a decent market
in this godforsaken place!

845
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,583
Now if it were back in Faridpur...

846
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,125
...that would be something!

847
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,458
What have you named it?

848
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,083
Guess?

849
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,666
You & your stupid games in
the middle of the night!

850
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,625
What's the name?

851
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,500
Rashmoni Saree Stores

852
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,666
Like it?

853
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,625
What is it Pishima?

854
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,666
Have I d-done something wrong?

855
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:21,958
Silly cow!

856
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:23,958
You...

857
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,666
...you named it after me?

858
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:32,666
I can't believe anyone even
remembered my name any more!

859
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,166
A child widow...

860
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,625
... utterly useless in this world...

861
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:42,458
...yet you remembered and...

862
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:45,333
What is this Pishima?

863
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,958
You're crying!

864
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,083
Please don't!

865
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,083
I didn't mean to...

866
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,375
Pishima?

867
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,625
Done? Give-

868
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,000
A shirt?
-Yes

869
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,416
Chest...

870
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,708
Ma'am!

871
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,583
There it is!

872
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:54,166
Hey! Give me a betel leaf!

873
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,208
Let's go!

874
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,708
Isn't that Kamala?
- Of course!

875
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:05,791
All decked up in the
middle of the afternoon!

876
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,875
Where is she going?

877
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:10,583
Must be going to the Mitra's shop

878
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,208
Really?

879
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,083
Yes!

880
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,250
So the affair is still on?

881
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,500
Take it Ma'am!

882
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,833
Sure?

883
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,500
Pack this too!

884
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,166
Show me that silk-
- Which one?

885
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,583
The peacock blue!

886
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,791
Here-

887
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:11,500
This one too!

888
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,208
How many does that make?

889
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:17,333
Er...

890
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,375
32 in all, Miss!

891
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:21,833
Is that all?

892
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:27,250
Panna, get a porter!
- Yes, Ma'am

893
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,875
Miss...er...
the total cost comes to...

894
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,875
Shahjahan, how much?

895
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,291
Cost!

896
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,083
Hey Chandan babu!

897
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,291
What are they saying?

898
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:44,250
Are you going to
charge me for these?

899
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,125
No, I mean...er...

900
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:31,833
Come

901
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,166
Sit

902
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,666
Have you heard?

903
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,125
Your father-in-law!

904
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:47,333
He's livid about the shop!

905
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,791
He'll send for you this evening

906
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,333
Have you decided
what to say ?

907
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,833
I think we'll have to
wind up anyway

908
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,083
Why?

909
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:00,166
Because of your stupid father-in-law?

910
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:04,166
We have no more to invest

911
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:05,625
Besides, so many sarees...

912
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,791
...were stolen the other day!

913
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:10,000
Stupid bitch!

914
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,333
So the shop is yours to shut down...

915
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:16,958
...and mine to pawn jewellery for!

916
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,791
It's named after me!

917
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,333
Made with my money!

918
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,791
Who're you to shut it down?

919
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,333
But what am I to do?

920
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,291
We've run out of capital

921
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,333
Why?

922
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,166
My box is still there!

923
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,208
Pishima!

924
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,166
Have I ever said I won't give it?

925
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,875
But I want all my jewellery back!

926
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,458
It's my only wealth!

927
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:45,875
The reason they tolerated me
in this house for so long!

928
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,541
Else I would've been
kicked out long ago!

929
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:52,416
Now then...

930
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,750
...what will you
say to your in-laws?

931
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,333
Your father-in-law has a foul temper!

932
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,250
He might just beat you!

933
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,458
Well...

934
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,500
...what can I do?

935
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,083
I'll tell you!

936
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:11,250
Did you know that he
has a dirty secret?

937
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,250
No!

938
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:17,708
He has a woman!

939
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,708
Chameli!

940
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,083
Lives by the canal!

941
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,958
He's spent a lot on her

942
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:27,000
Money, gold ornaments...

943
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:30,125
The moment he insults you,
speak right out & say...

944
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,791
...that you know about Chameli!

945
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,708
That'll shut him up!

946
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:46,666
Now what?
Don't like the idea?

947
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,708
I can't say all that!

948
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,041
No! Of course not!

949
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,333
Pious bitch!

950
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,625
No one ever dares say
anything to these men!

951
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,583
No wonder they've got out of hand!

952
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:09,666
All equally lecherous!

953
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:11,916
Want to know more?

954
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,791
Your husband has a mistress too!

955
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:16,666
What!

956
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,125
Her name's Kamala

957
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,000
Go ask him!

958
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,083
Stolen saris!
Hmph!

959
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,666
Stolen or gifted?
Find out!

960
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:28,083
What are you s-s-saying Pishima?

961
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,750
My dear girl...

962
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,625
...I'm giving you hard facts!

963
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,625
Where do you think
he goes every evening...

964
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:38,625
...splashing cologne &
wearing his silk shirt?

965
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:41,208
Returns home late after dinner?

966
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:44,250
Think he's devoted to you?

967
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:45,958
My foot!

968
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,916
Runs to Kamala
at every opportunity!

969
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,625
Scoundrels, all of them!

970
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,208
Having fun all their lives...

971
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,750
...and for me?

972
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:01,916
A jewellery box!
To forget what I was missing!

973
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:06,875
I was young and stupid,
so I did forget for a while...

974
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,500
Then...

975
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,916
...one day...

976
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,958
...when youth beckoned-

977
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:26,125
Scorched...all is scorched...

978
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:35,208
Terrible, searing hour...

979
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:49,375
I have gazed at his form all my life

980
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,500
Yet my eyes were never sated

981
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:04,958
For aeons I have laid my heart on his

982
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:12,458
Yet my heart was never at rest

983
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,000
Ramkhilaon!

984
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,041
Yes Miss?

985
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,958
What do you think you're up to?

986
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,250
Making such a din!

987
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,416
Disturbing my afternoon nap!

988
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,458
Haven't I told you...

989
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,958
...not to make so
much noise at siesta time?

990
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,166
Forgive me Miss!

991
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,791
My mistake!

992
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,208
Mistake?

993
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:37,916
Should I tell Father about
your mistake then?

994
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,916
The Master &
your two brothers...

995
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,916
...will flog me!

996
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,708
So they will!

997
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:50,916
What should I do then?

998
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:52,250
Tell me!

999
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:01,916
I heard...

1000
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,916
...your wife's gone
to visit her parents?

1001
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,125
Yes Miss

1002
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,083
So now you're all alone!

1003
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,333
Like me!

1004
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,666
Your hammering has
given me a headache!

1005
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:30,041
Feel!

1006
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,625
Feel how it throbs?

1007
01:13:53,875 --> 01:14:05,833
I built my home
in the hope of happiness

1008
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:13,791
Fire burnt it down

1009
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:24,500
I went to bathe in the sea of nectar...

1010
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,000
Come! Take the stairs!

1011
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:34,500
...but the nectar turned to poison

1012
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:54,000
Miss...?

1013
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:59,375
I'm right here...

1014
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,125
Be careful!

1015
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,125
Hurry!

1016
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:15,375
Who's that? Who's that?
Thief! Thief!

1017
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:19,458
Catch the thief! Catch him!

1018
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:22,416
Who is it? Who is it?

1019
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,083
Swine!

1020
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,333
How dare you enter the
inner quarters at night!

1021
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:34,375
Is this what I get for feeding
& clothing you all these years?

1022
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:40,333
Rascal! I will kill you!

1023
01:15:54,416 --> 01:16:03,958
Scorched...all is scorched...

1024
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:11,083
Bouma (daughter-in-law)

1025
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:14,166
Come, they're calling you....

1026
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,416
Ask the wench!

1027
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,708
Who paid for her shop?
Her business?

1028
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:27,791
From where did the capital come?
Ask the wench!

1029
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Wants to be a businesswoman!

1030
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:31,000
Not that easy! Not that easy!

1031
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Ask the wench!

1032
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:34,166
Chameli!

1033
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,541
Talk about Chameli!

1034
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:38,958
Oh no! I can't!

1035
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Sissy!

1036
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Who's that?

1037
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:43,708
Who? Who? Who?

1038
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,791
Who do you look at?

1039
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,458
Who do you look at?
Who do you look at?

1040
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,500
Where? No one!

1041
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:53,000
What's the matter?
Answer my father!

1042
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:54,416
The capital!

1043
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,083
From where did it come?
From where?

1044
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,625
From where?

1045
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,041
This one is a gambler!

1046
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,958
How does he square his gambling debts?

1047
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Why don't you ask him?

1048
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,833
Ask! Ask! Ask! Ask! Ask!

1049
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,083
Ask! Ask! Ask! Ask!

1050
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,458
Out of the question!

1051
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,958
Is this a joke?

1052
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:12,958
What have you done with the
jewellery we gave you?

1053
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:13,958
Answer me!

1054
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:15,041
Er...father...

1055
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:16,958
Listen dear...

1056
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,375
Family honour!

1057
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,916
Do these words mean anything?
Family honour!

1058
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,333
Yes! Yes! Family honour!

1059
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:26,500
Low-born wench from a lowly home!
- Lowly! Lowly!

1060
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,958
Lowly! Lowly!

1061
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,541
My brother & his wife
were very lucky...

1062
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,833
...for they died before...

1063
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,916
...they met a girl like you!

1064
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,000
Lowly! Lowly!
Lowly! Lowly!

1065
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:38,833
Brazen hussy, bringing shame!

1066
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:39,958
Ruining our family name!

1067
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:41,000
Now you want to start your game...

1068
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,958
...of doing business! Shame!

1069
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,583
Did you hear my Father's words?

1070
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:46,916
Hmm?

1071
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,250
My father's words? My father's words?

1072
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:51,916
Lowly wench, I'll spank
you with my clogs...

1073
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:52,916
Chameli!

1074
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,916
Chameli!

1075
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,791
Let it go...for now...

1076
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:01,541
Yes! Flog her!

1077
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,500
Gambler!

1078
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:04,875
A woman in business!
- Hey, Gambler!

1079
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,500
Let's talk later!

1080
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,750
Later, not today!

1081
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,833
What, father?
Shall we talk later?

1082
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:14,916
Yes! Yes!
Later, later...

1083
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,416
That takes care of them!

1084
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:29,625
Ha! Ha!
'Silence is Golden!'

1085
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,875
You are just...

1086
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,250
What's the matter?

1087
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,875
I know!

1088
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,750
You're hurt by...

1089
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:43,166
...what my father and brother said!

1090
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:44,875
Ignore it!

1091
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:47,833
Just give it a day or two...

1092
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:50,875
The sarees from the shop...

1093
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,875
...were not really stolen,
were they?

1094
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,291
You... know...?

1095
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,875
Who took them?

1096
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,875
K-k-amala?

1097
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:05,500
Who told you about Kamala?

1098
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,833
Is that important?

1099
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,833
Why are you acting so coy?

1100
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:19,708
If you l-l-ove her,
then maybe you should...

1101
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:22,250
...marry her & bring her home!

1102
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,375
I'll give you your f-f-reedom
& go away!

1103
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,083
What are you saying!

1104
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:29,833
How can you compare yourself with...

1105
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,708
No question of marriage!

1106
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,291
Besides...

1107
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:40,625
...I've hardly visited her since you came!
In fact...

1108
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,291
...never!

1109
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:45,458
Listen!

1110
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,833
You gave Kamala some sarees, fine!

1111
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,583
If you wish, give her more!

1112
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,041
But do it with your head held high!

1113
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,750
Aren't you a l-i-ion
among men?

1114
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,791
Why should you have to
hide anything for fear of me?

1115
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,750
I didn't give her anything,
believe me!

1116
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,083
She just came one day...

1117
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,125
...& said "I'm taking these!"

1118
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,666
I couldn't say no...

1119
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:10,000
You do see?

1120
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:15,583
Point is, can we get them back?

1121
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,291
What!
Take them back?

1122
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:20,791
What kind of person
would that make you?

1123
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,583
Besides...

1124
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,791
...you did  love her once!

1125
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:32,166
If you ever feel like seeing her...

1126
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,750
...you might, you know!

1127
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,750
It's human nature!

1128
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,875
Then do so...

1129
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,083
...but never hide it from me!

1130
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,125
Promise ?

1131
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:49,541
You...

1132
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:53,333
...you don't despise me Lata?

1133
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,500
Why?

1134
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,708
Because you loved someone else?

1135
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:05,125
Silly!

1136
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,833
As though love can be c-c-ontrolled!

1137
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,791
I don't want anyone but you Lata!

1138
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:18,500
No one but you!

1139
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,750
No one!

1140
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:26,666
Not any one!

1141
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:06,833
Rasmoni Saree Stores!

1142
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:09,208
What a name!

1143
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,416
After our cousin Rasmoni!

1144
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,833
Such devotion!

1145
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:15,208
Who knows...

1146
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:18,583
...maybe it was Chandan's
wife who stole the box!

1147
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:19,583
I forget her name...?

1148
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:21,833
Somlata. But Mother,
she's a very good girl!

1149
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:23,166
Oh come on!

1150
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:25,750
Good girl?
Or good businesswoman?

1151
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,375
Come Puni...

1152
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,708
...let's take a look at
your cousin's shop!

1153
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:31,333
Come -

1154
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,291
Oh dear!

1155
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,625
My Aunt from
the other side!

1156
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,041
With her daughter...

1157
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:38,833
Puni!

1158
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,250
If she asks for credit now...?

1159
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:42,583
Oh! Aunt!

1160
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:46,083
So happy to see you!
Welcome! Welcome!

1161
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,708
Do sit!

1162
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,375
Sit Puni!

1163
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,791
Yes, sit down!

1164
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,750
Let me send for some s-s-weets?

1165
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,208
Why bother?

1166
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,375
- Why not?

1167
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:13,375
So then Puni...

1168
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,375
...when did you come from Calcutta?

1169
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:18,333
Didn't see you at the terrace...?

1170
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:20,166
Terrace?

1171
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,833
In her condition?
She's due any day!

1172
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,791
We've come to buy a saree
for the expecting mother!

1173
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,416
B-b-uy! What do you mean?

1174
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,750
You are family!

1175
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:33,958
So Puni...

1176
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:35,125
...what would you like to see?

1177
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:37,916
Japanese georgette!
Have any?

1178
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:40,041
It's high fashion in Calcutta!

1179
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,583
Are you mad?

1180
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,541
Georgette! Here?
This is not Calcutta!

1181
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:46,166
Let me show you some silks!

1182
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,750
From Bishnupur!

1183
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,000
Just take a look!

1184
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,666
Absolutely genuine!

1185
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:58,041
See, Aunt?
Indigenous from Bengal!

1186
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:03,083
Why not a South Indian silk then?

1187
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:04,625
A Kanjivaram!

1188
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,500
What's that?
- You wouldn't know!

1189
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:11,291
D'you have any?
Kanjivaram?

1190
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:14,833
No, I'm sorry.
Ours is a small outfit...

1191
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:20,458
...we don't stock stuff like
Georgettes or K-a-anjivarams

1192
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,500
So get them from Calcutta!

1193
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:26,791
The shops in Hogg Market
bring sarees from all over India!

1194
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:30,333
Bombay! Madras! Bangalore! Mysore!

1195
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,666
You should see those shops in Calcutta!

1196
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,416
Wait Puni!
Want to see a Dhaka saree?

1197
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,625
Design all over!

1198
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:37,750
From Benaras!

1199
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:38,958
Balasore!

1200
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:46,250
(Sarees from all over Bengal)

1201
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:48,708
Something in the range of red?

1202
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,750
Why not?
Sunset cloud!

1203
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:55,041
(Different colours)

1204
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,791
Ridiculous!
- Don't like any?

1205
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,250
That's enough!

1206
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,291
Brought the whole shop down for her!

1207
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:02,000
Listen!
- No, let me talk!

1208
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,333
A chit like her!
Crawling only the other day!

1209
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:06,250
Flaunting Calcutta here!

1210
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:09,750
Cousin...
- No, no! She talks too big!

1211
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:12,333
Calcutta! Bombay! Madras!
Hmph!

1212
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:22,791
Calcutta... Bombay...Madras

1213
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,791
Kanchipuram! Mysore! Bangalore!

1214
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,250
Pishima...?

1215
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:36,958
Here -

1216
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:42,833
Kanchipuram! Mysore! Bangalore!

1217
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:46,916
Sambalpur! Jaipur!
Cuttack! Baroda!

1218
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:49,500
It was a long tour...

1219
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:51,875
...but I managed to see everything!

1220
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:55,208
We must get new stock!
- But...

1221
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:58,208
...such distant places!

1222
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,541
Distant?

1223
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:06,416
Fine, sit back & relax!
Let the shop go to the dogs!

1224
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:10,125
But who will travel that far?

1225
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,250
Why? What's that jackass there for?
Your husband!

1226
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:17,250
Can't bear to part with him
for a second, can you?

1227
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,166
Shameless hussy!

1228
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:21,791
Always wanting to cuddle!

1229
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:23,666
I've only made threats so far,...

1230
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,708
...but when I really make you a widow...

1231
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,166
...you'll know what's what!

1232
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,166
Shameless, low-born bitch!

1233
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:31,166
Please Pishima!

1234
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,833
Stop cursing & think about expenses!

1235
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,125
Don't act coy now!

1236
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:39,833
We both know that my box is there
to fall back on...

1237
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:43,666
...but before that, I want to
check the accounts!

1238
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:46,416
72 sarees were sold
in the last two months

1239
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,791
I've been counting!

1240
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:52,125
What happened to that money?
Show me the book!

1241
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,125
Go on!

1242
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:02,083
Don't bother getting up.
Just push it this way!

1243
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:27,666
Cost of tiffin for the salesmen...

1244
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:30,000
...30 rupees!

1245
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:32,791
In one month!

1246
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:34,875
What do you feed them? Gold?

1247
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:45,416
You think Pishima is illiterate,
what will she know of accounts?

1248
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,458
You can hoodwink her?

1249
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:49,083
More fool you!

1250
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:51,750
I learnt math formulae
in my childhood ...

1251
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:57,875
...just hearing the Pundit
teach my brothers!

1252
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:02,375
Don't ever think you can fool me!

1253
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:07,958
You're being very generous
with your jewellery...

1254
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:14,000
...but what if he gets ch-e-eated
when abroad?

1255
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,000
I've been cheated all my life anyway!

1256
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:22,000
Husband died before
I got to know him...

1257
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:27,375
...the government cheated us
of our home & our land!

1258
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,833
So what's new?

1259
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,583
Rather, see if you can...

1260
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:34,041
...make a man out of that jackass!

1261
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:37,291
Pishima!

1262
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,625
Pishima, you...

1263
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:51,666
Damn!

1264
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,291
The English have left India,
but their clothes haven't!

1265
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:59,625
Suddenly, I have to leave for Bombay!
Out of the blue!

1266
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:01,750
Have I ever travelled that far?

1267
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,375
Leaving Faridpur was bad enough!

1268
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:09,625
Let me see?

1269
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,833
And what about me?

1270
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,208
I'll have to run the shop all
by myself after you've left!

1271
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:21,250
Why? Birenbabu, Shajahan,
they'll all be here!

1272
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,375
You're going away for so long...

1273
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:27,208
...won't you m-m-miss me?

1274
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,583
Chandan! Are you done?

1275
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,666
Coming, Father!

1276
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:35,416
Won't you miss me at all?

1277
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:38,166
Don't start all this now!

1278
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,208
I'm late already!
The carriage is here...

1279
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,208
Father's calling me...
Where's my stick now!

1280
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,625
So much rush!

1281
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:55,750
Listen! Rambilas will come up.
Give him my luggage

1282
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,083
See you...

1283
01:29:58,166 --> 01:30:00,416
- It's getting late!
Coming, Father!

1284
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:27,708
Salaam, Sir!

1285
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,583
Haven't seen you in a long time!

1286
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:32,333
Come & bless my
poor shop with your presence...

1287
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,375
Not today.
I'm in a bit of a hurry!

1288
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,583
Where are you off to?

1289
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,041
Don't get me started!

1290
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:41,041
My brother's gone to buy new stock

1291
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,708
The shop is my responsibility now!

1292
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:46,375
How can a woman
handle business all by herself?

1293
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,125
You can't farm with a donkey, can you?

1294
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,708
See you...
- Ok

1295
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,291
Whatever I fail to supervise...

1296
01:30:56,583 --> 01:31:01,375
Ah! Soumen Babu!
Welcome! Welcome!

1297
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:07,041
I don't see Mrs. Mitra...?

1298
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:11,458
I've sent her home. To eat!

1299
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:16,416
She doesn't even get time for meals!

1300
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:20,166
What do you want?

1301
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,375
I've brought my brother-in-law along.
His daughter's getting married...

1302
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:29,083
...told him the stock of bridal sarees
here is better even than Calcutta!

1303
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:32,041
He's shopping for her trousseau!

1304
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,000
Show him some festive sarees...

1305
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:36,500
...from Dhaka, Benaras,
Balasore and so on...

1306
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:37,875
Sure!

1307
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,416
I'll do it.

1308
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:51,166
These are from Benaras!

1309
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:54,291
Sir...those are from Balasore!

1310
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:59,250
Oh, right. Balasore!
Wait, I'll show you Benarasis as well...

1311
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,000
Here you are! Benarasi!

1312
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:09,041
Lovely colour!
- Ah! Yes...

1313
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:11,291
...what's it called?
Peacock blue!

1314
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:14,958
That's a Midnight blue, Sir
from Dhaka!

1315
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:19,166
It's the same thing!
Peacock blue or Midnight!

1316
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:23,000
Yes, Midnight blue!
It'll look very nice on Minu...

1317
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,375
...don't you think?

1318
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,458
Let me see?

1319
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,500
Nice!

1320
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,791
How much?

1321
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,750
Probably Rs.45

1322
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,750
Just check the ticket please, Sir!

1323
01:32:39,166 --> 01:32:41,250
A slight mistake, Biren babu.
Not 45...

1324
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,375
...but 145!

1325
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:48,458
Just a difference of 1...

1326
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:50,250
...otherwise correct!

1327
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,250
But Sir...?

1328
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:56,750
Isn't that a bit steep?

1329
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,958
Biren babu,
would you please check again?

1330
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:02,333
Come now, Sir!
Surely I know the prices in my own shop?

1331
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:04,875
No need to ask employees!

1332
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:07,291
This store is very reliable though!

1333
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,375
I've been shopping here a long time

1334
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:13,208
But the prices are fixed, my friend;
no bargaining allowed!

1335
01:33:13,375 --> 01:33:15,833
Now the decision is yours!

1336
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:19,208
What decision?
It's his daughter's wedding after all!

1337
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:22,750
Biren babu, pack this.

1338
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:29,833
Here -

1339
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:35,208
Your bill...

1340
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:40,666
...your change

1341
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,166
Drop in again!

1342
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,666
Of course!

1343
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,166
Give me the rest of the sarees -

1344
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:55,083
Let me correct the prices!

1345
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,208
You've been working for so long...

1346
01:33:57,291 --> 01:34:00,291
...still haven't learnt to price your goods!

1347
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:04,791
Heard your multi-talented brother-in-law
was at the shop today?

1348
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,083
You've had it now!

1349
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:12,166
Actually he doesn't have
much work at present, so...

1350
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:14,541
Hmph! An idle mind is
the devil's workshop!

1351
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:17,875
Why can't he just go fishing
like he used to?

1352
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:23,250
I'm warning you,
your shop will go bankrupt!

1353
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,583
If you don't like our prices,
go elsewhere!

1354
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:46,500
What gives you the right
to call us cheats?

1355
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:48,458
If you cheat,
you will be called one!

1356
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:51,875
My cousin bought the same saree
a week ago for just 45 rupees!

1357
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,416
How can the price increase
by 100 in 7 days?

1358
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,791
I knew there was something fishy!

1359
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:57,958
What a shame!

1360
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,416
I was so confident
of your reliability!

1361
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:04,291
You didn't keep my faith!

1362
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:06,000
There you are Mrs. Mitra!

1363
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,458
I didn't expect this from you!

1364
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,333
Adding 1 with a
different coloured ink!

1365
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,791
Think we're idiots?

1366
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:15,625
Be careful what you say!

1367
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,208
We won't tolerate any rudeness...

1368
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:19,708
Oh dear! How embarrassing!

1369
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,958
It's actually my fault, Soumen babu!

1370
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:23,875
My husband's not here you know...

1371
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:29,833
...I must have faltered
while working late all by myself!

1372
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:32,750
Please f-f-forgive me
Soumen Babu!

1373
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:35,583
This shop is like your own

1374
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:37,958
Tell me, has such a thing
ever happened before?

1375
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,708
No, that's why...
- Anyone can make a mistake...

1376
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,750
...but the way this
gentleman behaved...

1377
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:44,916
He's not mentally stable right now

1378
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:47,666
His w-w-wife is seriously ill!

1379
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:51,208
Paralysed. Completely bed-ridden!

1380
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:53,541
We find it hard to bear...

1381
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:55,916
...so you can imagine his state!

1382
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,208
Really? Tch! Tch!

1383
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,833
Paralysed...?

1384
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:04,250
That explains it!

1385
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:06,458
I just couldn't fathom
why he...

1386
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:08,666
She's in a bad way this morning!

1387
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,916
Mother's asked you to
go back as soon as possible!

1388
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:15,541
Yes...yes...of course!

1389
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:19,875
Forgive me!

1390
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,916
Not mentally stable
you know...

1391
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:24,916
Not stable..

1392
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,666
Do sit!

1393
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,875
So you're Soumen Babu's brother-in-law?
-Yes

1394
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,833
Then you're family for us too!

1395
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:42,625
We really can't charge
you for the saree!

1396
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,875
Here!

1397
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:48,041
145 rupees -

1398
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,708
No, no!
What is this?

1399
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:52,041
Just because of a small mistake...

1400
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:53,791
What's your daughter's name?

1401
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:56,333
Minu. But Mrs. Mitra...

1402
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,750
Let this saree be a wedding gift
for Minu from Rasmoni Stores

1403
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,541
No, no, we won't brook
any arguments!

1404
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:09,875
Instead, let me show you some sarees
as gifts for her in-laws...

1405
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:12,416
Here...

1406
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:17,125
From Shantipur!
See how d-e-ense the weave is?

1407
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:13,708
Pishima ? So late ?

1408
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:17,416
Idiot!
Night is the best time for me!

1409
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,500
Daylight poses certain problems...

1410
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,208
...you wouldn't understand

1411
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:22,791
Now tell me...

1412
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:25,583
...your husband's away,
your bed is empty...

1413
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:28,000
...so why such pains
to dress your hair?

1414
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,375
Who are you planning
to cuddle tonight?

1415
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:33,250
Pishima! Please go now!

1416
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,416
I'm sleepy!

1417
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,250
Who do you think you are?
A queen?

1418
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,875
Why should I go just
because you say so?

1419
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,708
I don't live off your Father!

1420
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:48,250
Who's the boy?

1421
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:51,916
Boy?

1422
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,416
What boy?

1423
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:56,750
Acting coy again!

1424
01:38:57,041 --> 01:38:59,833
Who's the boy who follows you...

1425
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:03,291
...on your way back
from the shop every day?

1426
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,750
Think I don't know!

1427
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:09,375
I don't know.
I haven't seen anyone!

1428
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:15,333
Handsome boy!

1429
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:18,500
Have you seen his eyes?

1430
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:23,083
Full of dreams!

1431
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,500
Don't refuse him

1432
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:28,500
Why stay faithful?
Let yourself be swept away!

1433
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:31,708
Disgusting!
Even hearing this is a sin!

1434
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:34,000
Enough of that crap! Sin!

1435
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:38,250
All this hoo-ha about
sin & virtue, heaven & hell...

1436
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:41,875
...is just stuff & nonsense!
I know that now after death!

1437
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,875
I'm giving you
first hand information!

1438
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:46,500
Understood?

1439
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:52,541
So just go ahead & ravage the boy!

1440
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,458
Virtuous saint!

1441
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:01,916
I'm giving you good advice,
you'll regret not taking it!

1442
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:05,500
When your body ages & begins to rot...

1443
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,833
...then you can bemoan your fate!

1444
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,250
What do I care!

1445
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:28,958
I've collected a lot of sarees
for the shop in the last few months!

1446
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:33,708
I'm told sarees are cheaper in Surat
than in Bombay!

1447
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:38,375
I'm going to Surat tommorrow.
Not sure when I'll be back...

1448
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,166
... please don't worry!

1449
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,000
Tell Father...

1450
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:46,291
...that Bombay is a far bigger
city than Dhaka!

1451
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:50,250
The biggest I've ever seen!

1452
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,458
I am well!

1453
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:56,291
My respectful regards to
you and Father!

1454
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:58,500
Yours Chandan

1455
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:02,083
Has he written only to you?

1456
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,666
No one else?

1457
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
He must be busy...

1458
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:10,083
...so he's written
to us all together!

1459
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:14,750
Your brother-in-law has already
had his breakfast

1460
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's time you had yours too!

1461
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:20,083
You'll have to rush
to the shop after this!

1462
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:25,208
Yes, let her eat now.
She's been wearing herself out!

1463
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:34,583
By the way...

1464
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,916
...until Chandan returns. ..

1465
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,208
...why don't I go and sit
at the shop now & then...?

1466
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:40,333
Please!

1467
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:42,833
Don't go poking your nose
where it doesn't belong!

1468
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:45,458
You're landed gentry.
Remain that way!

1469
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:47,375
Why bother with the shop?

1470
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,416
Stupid woman!

1471
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,541
No sense at all...

1472
01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:16,458
Etwaari! Go & attend to Benu,
he's crying his lungs out!

1473
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,791
Yes, Ma'am!

1474
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:22,750
Your sister-in-law is childless!

1475
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:30,166
And all you & Chandan can think about
is your shop!

1476
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:33,708
If you're not careful...

1477
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:37,166
...you'll get old before you know it!

1478
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:39,708
It'll be no use repenting then!

1479
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:43,333
Youth doesn't last forever, my dear!

1480
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:47,333
There's a time for everything
under the sun you know!

1481
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:39,041
W-w-hat do you want?

1482
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:42,083
Why do you f-f-follow me every night?

1483
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:45,250
I don't like it one bit!

1484
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:21,500
Delicious, isn't he?

1485
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:23,500
What did I tell you?

1486
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,500
I told him off sternly today!

1487
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:29,500
That's the way!

1488
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,875
Be stern at the start!

1489
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,916
Cast the net...

1490
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:37,500
...& draw him in playfully!

1491
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,291
Then bring him home,
lock the door and...

1492
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,916
A husband is boring!
Like everyday clothes!

1493
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,041
Colours faded
through use!

1494
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:51,541
But a stranger is like
an expensive silk saree

1495
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:55,000
You need to wear those
too sometimes!

1496
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,750
Why?

1497
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:01,666
Why should only men
have mistresses?

1498
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:04,500
Don't women have
desires too?

1499
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:07,750
Listen...

1500
01:45:07,833 --> 01:45:10,458
...youth comes just once
in a life time, remember!

1501
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,875
Once gone, it never comes back!

1502
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:34,416
Oh sakhi!  (girl friend)

1503
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:42,666
This monsoon (rainy season)
holds no charm for me

1504
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:13,375
Lightning flashes clutch at my heart

1505
01:46:13,375 --> 01:46:20,375
The house seems empty,
forlorn and dark

1506
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:28,041
Which way has my beloved gone

1507
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:35,375
No one can tell me that

1508
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:51,208
This monsoon holds no charm

1509
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:58,958
Listen!

1510
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:01,083
Are you listening?

1511
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:03,083
You stupid woman!

1512
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:06,416
He's come, your lover!

1513
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:09,333
Must you sleep as
soundly as a buffalow?

1514
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:13,333
He's at the gate.
Won't you go ?

1515
01:47:14,333 --> 01:47:15,583
Why are you gaping like that?

1516
01:47:16,333 --> 01:47:18,333
The rain's stopped!

1517
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:23,333
Dawn is about to break.
Hear the birds chirping?

1518
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:29,250
Hurry! I can't hold
on to this form much longer!

1519
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,500
Let me witness this courtship
before I go!

1520
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:35,333
Stupid bitch!
What're you waiting for?

1521
01:47:35,333 --> 01:47:37,375
If you don't believe me,
go to the terrace & see for yourself!

1522
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,291
I can't stay much longer!

1523
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:50,291
Drops of rain quench
the thirst of the earth

1524
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,375
Hurry up!

1525
01:47:56,208 --> 01:47:57,291
Let's go!

1526
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:08,458
Without you, my love,
my heart is parched

1527
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,041
Go!

1528
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:02,208
Don't turn him away!

1529
01:49:03,416 --> 01:49:05,125
Go!

1530
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:18,333
The monsoon goes
to come back again

1531
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:27,208
Youth once gone,
will never return

1532
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:38,166
The monsoon goes...

1533
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:48,125
...to come back again

1534
01:49:58,583 --> 01:50:09,000
Youth once gone,
will never return

1535
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:30,750
Youth once gone,
will never return

1536
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:38,208
This monsoon holds no charm

1537
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:02,125
You should have left
early today Ma'am!

1538
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:05,000
The wind is rough,
it's going to rain soon...

1539
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:07,875
...you'd better hurry!
- It's ok!

1540
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:10,500
Should I go with you?

1541
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,916
The distance is not much

1542
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:15,625
I'll manage!
I do it every day!

1543
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:17,875
Reach home safely!
- Sure!

1544
01:51:55,708 --> 01:52:03,500
Drops of rain quench
the thirst of the earth

1545
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:13,166
Without you, my love,
my heart is parched

1546
01:52:14,583 --> 01:52:22,166
The monsoon goes
to come back again

1547
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:32,666
Youth once gone,
will never return

1548
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:41,208
Youth once gone,
will never return

1549
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:48,500
This monsoon holds no charm

1550
01:52:48,583 --> 01:52:52,541
Open the door!

1551
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:56,208
Open the door!

1552
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:00,416
Take down the trunks!

1553
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:05,333
They have to be taken inside!

1554
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,625
Ah...Lata!

1555
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:14,333
What's the matter?

1556
01:53:14,416 --> 01:53:16,625
Why are you crying?

1557
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:20,416
You're flushed!

1558
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,208
Aren't you well?

1559
01:53:22,625 --> 01:53:25,875
Why did you go to the shop
in this condition?

1560
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:44,333
What a beautiful rose!

1561
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:50,083
How did you know I would
return today?

1562
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,958
Now what...?

1563
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,583
What...?

1564
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:23,333
Death to you!

1565
01:54:23,416 --> 01:54:25,083
Stupid bitch!

1566
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:27,125
Rot in hell!

1567
01:54:29,458 --> 01:54:31,708
She's back with that jackass again!

1568
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,875
Tell me...

1569
01:54:36,958 --> 01:54:41,250
...do you still believe in
gh-o-hosts?

1570
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:42,583
Rubbish!

1571
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:47,541
I travelled to so many places;
never saw hide or hair of one!

1572
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:54,958
Don't tell me you
still believe in ghosts!

1573
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:58,958
Death to you!

1574
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:02,458
Death to you both!

1575
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:10,458
Ten months later...

1576
01:55:10,541 --> 01:55:12,291
...early one morning,
in Chaitra (March)...

1577
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:14,125
...I was born

1578
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,250
After the month of my birth...

1579
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:20,125
...I was named 'Chaitali'

1580
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:40,791
She looks like my sister Rasmoni!

1581
01:55:57,458 --> 01:55:59,041
After a long time...

1582
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,875
...a child was born to this family

1583
01:56:02,333 --> 01:56:05,875
I was adored by one and all!

1584
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:10,708
Even the paralysis
in my Aunt's tongue...

1585
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:12,708
...was miraculously cured!

1586
01:56:13,166 --> 01:56:17,041
I became the lucky mascot!

1587
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,541
Everyone said I looked...

1588
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:32,750
...exactly like my
father's aunt Rasmoni!

1589
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:35,833
From the shape of my eyes.
to my complexion...

1590
01:56:35,916 --> 01:56:38,666
... right to the
beauty spot on my lip!

1591
01:56:39,916 --> 01:56:42,958
Only one person seemed
worried by this

1592
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:44,416
My mother!

1593
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:51,000
Pishima!

1594
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:53,958
Pishima?

1595
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,875
No one else ever saw her again...

1596
01:57:01,083 --> 01:57:02,208
...not even my mother!

1597
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:05,083
Only I knew that there was...

1598
01:57:05,166 --> 01:57:07,416
...someone else who lived with us!

1599
01:57:07,833 --> 01:57:09,875
Someone I've seen
ever since I can remember!

1600
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:13,416
Someone who's not human,
but a ghost...

1601
01:57:13,833 --> 01:57:16,083
...my Pishi-thakuma!

1602
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,875
In the years that followed...

1603
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:21,041
...I grew up surrounded
by love & affection

1604
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:25,458
Along with me grew
our sleepy little town

1605
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:31,666
People crossed over from the
other side by the hundreds...

1606
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:33,583
...seeking refuge

1607
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,666
The other side was then in turmoil!

1608
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:44,125
The people of East Pakistan were carving out
a new identity for themselves...

1609
01:57:44,375 --> 01:57:46,375
...based on their mother tongue.
Independent Bangladesh!

1610
01:57:51,375 --> 01:57:55,666
In the middle of all this,
I completed my 18th year

1611
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:08,750
Come, have some rice pudding!
I made it for your birthday

1612
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:10,916
Hurry up!
Mother's calling me -

1613
01:58:11,541 --> 01:58:12,375
Here -

1614
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:15,083
Mmm!

1615
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,333
Take this -

1616
01:58:25,375 --> 01:58:26,416
What is it?

1617
01:58:32,708 --> 01:58:33,708
Jewellery!

1618
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:36,708
Not a speck of gold is missing!

1619
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:39,416
Here! You can tally it
with the list!

1620
01:58:41,333 --> 01:58:42,083
Goodness!

1621
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:45,541
What ugly, old-fashioned ornaments!

1622
01:58:45,625 --> 01:58:47,000
Whose are they?

1623
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:51,708
Belonged to a great aunt of yours.
Rasmoni

1624
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:54,291
She had a tragic life...

1625
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,916
They're yours now

1626
01:58:58,291 --> 01:58:59,458
What're you talking about?

1627
01:58:59,541 --> 01:59:01,625
Do I ever wear jewellery?

1628
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:17,291
I have no interest
in Pishi-thakuma's jewellery

1629
01:59:18,291 --> 01:59:19,791
My world is made up of...

1630
01:59:19,875 --> 01:59:21,000
...my college...

1631
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,416
...my friends...

1632
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,458
...and someone else...

1633
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,500
...from whom I haven't heard...

1634
01:59:27,583 --> 01:59:29,250
...for the past 3 months

1635
01:59:55,916 --> 01:59:56,875
Come on, girl!

1636
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,250
Why're you moving at snail's pace?

1637
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,250
Speed up!

1638
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:10,583
How long since you
received his letter?

1639
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:13,583
The last one came in July

1640
02:00:13,833 --> 02:00:15,208
From Tangail

1641
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:17,166
That too after exchanging
several hands!

1642
02:00:18,166 --> 02:00:19,583
From Tangail

1643
02:00:19,791 --> 02:00:21,666
But that's in East Bengal!

1644
02:00:22,041 --> 02:00:26,083
Wasn't he working at
some news agency in Calcutta?

1645
02:00:26,583 --> 02:00:28,041
He still is...

1646
02:00:28,791 --> 02:00:31,041
...but he's been travelling
to East Pakistan...

1647
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:32,583
...to deliver arms!

1648
02:00:32,708 --> 02:00:33,583
Really?

1649
02:00:33,625 --> 02:00:34,833
But he is from India!

1650
02:00:34,916 --> 02:00:35,750
So?

1651
02:00:36,583 --> 02:00:39,000
Aren't we Indians supporting
their fight for freedom?

1652
02:00:39,208 --> 02:00:41,500
And Benu feels he belongs there!

1653
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:44,541
Haven't you read about the
student agitation over Bangladesh?

1654
02:00:44,583 --> 02:00:46,666
Oh, I forgot!
Ghosts don't read newspapers!

1655
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:50,833
Stop calling me names!

1656
02:00:51,375 --> 02:00:52,625
So what if I don't?

1657
02:00:52,708 --> 02:00:56,041
There are many ghosts
who read the news regularly!

1658
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:57,625
Hmm...

1659
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:01,750
If only we could know Mrs. Gandhi's
decision about the Bangladesh war!

1660
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:03,833
Tell me...

1661
02:01:04,083 --> 02:01:06,125
...you've studied so much...

1662
02:01:06,666 --> 02:01:08,000
...go to college everyday...

1663
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:09,791
...read the newspapers...

1664
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:12,083
...have your ever thought about...

1665
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:15,541
...how you will manage to marry Benu?

1666
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,125
His grandfather...

1667
02:01:17,458 --> 02:01:18,833
...Ramkhilaon, was beaten to death...

1668
02:01:18,916 --> 02:01:20,458
...by the men of this family!

1669
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:22,833
Will they spare his grandson?

1670
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:26,083
Do you have the courage
to go against them?

1671
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:29,083
Why else am I going
to meet him tomorrow?

1672
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:31,958
Don't keep harping about
marriage like a bourgeois!

1673
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,500
Is that the only goal of one's life?

1674
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:36,708
Like who? Bourg...?

1675
02:01:37,333 --> 02:01:38,625
What kind of ghost is that?

1676
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,041
Never mind.
You wouldn't understand!

1677
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,833
I don't need to!

1678
02:01:57,916 --> 02:02:00,916
How many of you live in hiding here?

1679
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,750
Three right now...

1680
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:05,750
...two more will join day after...

1681
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:10,541
... if they can make it
across the border!

1682
02:02:11,833 --> 02:02:14,750
What a state these rooms are in!

1683
02:02:16,916 --> 02:02:19,541
I've always heard of Rafiq's house...

1684
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:22,750
Who is this Rafiq?
Do you know?

1685
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:25,666
A poet from across the border

1686
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,750
Lived here for a while
after the Partition

1687
02:02:29,166 --> 02:02:31,708
Of course it wasn't in ruins then!

1688
02:02:32,625 --> 02:02:35,125
They say he fell in love
with a Hindu woman here...

1689
02:02:35,166 --> 02:02:36,708
...& committed suicide

1690
02:02:39,708 --> 02:02:42,458
Unrequited love is
a dangerous thing, Chaiti!

1691
02:02:45,083 --> 02:02:47,916
Do you think you'll succeed...?

1692
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:53,666
What if...

1693
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,625
...what if you're killed?

1694
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:01,000
I will come back again...

1695
02:03:03,875 --> 02:03:06,125
...to the banks of
the rice-field river...

1696
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:08,416
...in this land of Bengal

1697
02:03:09,708 --> 02:03:11,666
Not in human form perhaps...

1698
02:03:12,375 --> 02:03:16,375
...perhaps as a gull, or a sparrow...

1699
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:19,666
...or the crow at dawn...

1700
02:03:20,375 --> 02:03:23,458
...in this land of New Harvest...

1701
02:03:36,708 --> 02:03:41,375
Oh golden land of Bangla(Bengal)

1702
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:47,583
I pledge my love to you

1703
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:53,458
Forever and ever…

1704
02:03:53,666 --> 02:04:02,625
…your skies & your sweet breezes
have played to my heart…

1705
02:04:03,458 --> 02:04:08,625
…have played to my heart
the sweetest music

1706
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:11,916
Oh golden land of Bangla

1707
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:17,541
I pledge my love to you

1708
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:32,416
What shaded nooks,
what beauteous glades!

1709
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:37,583
What love, what care!

1710
02:04:37,583 --> 02:04:43,125
What peace reigns
under your banyan trees…

1711
02:04:43,541 --> 02:04:48,291
…and down your rivers flows!

1712
02:04:49,375 --> 02:05:00,291
O motherland, my mother-tongue
is music to my ears

1713
02:05:00,583 --> 02:05:14,166
O motherland, my mother-tongue
is music to my ears

1714
02:05:14,833 --> 02:05:15,833
He's gone!

1715
02:05:16,125 --> 02:05:24,375
When you are hurt, my heart is rent…

1716
02:05:24,666 --> 02:05:29,750
...and tears drench
the earth beneath my feet

1717
02:05:30,041 --> 02:05:33,541
Oh golden land of Bangla

1718
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:40,208
I pledge my love to you

1719
02:05:40,291 --> 02:05:52,250
Oh motherland!
I pledge my love to you!

1720
02:06:13,458 --> 02:06:17,125
All India Radio, Calcutta
Debdulal Bandhopadhyay with the news

1721
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:19,416
The headlines this evening are...

1722
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,250
...amidst continuous cross fire
at the eastern border of India...

1723
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:27,083
...a delegation of 3 will
inspect the area tomorrow

1724
02:06:27,166 --> 02:06:30,958
This was conveyed by
the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi

1725
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:32,916
In Pratap-pur,
a village of Barisal district...

1726
02:06:33,041 --> 02:06:36,875
...in a clash with the Pak army
several freedom fighters were killed...

1727
02:06:36,958 --> 02:06:39,125
...as reported by
our special correspondent

1728
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:42,458
The extent of collateral damage
is yet to be...

1729
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:49,458
Why did you turn
off the radio suddenly?

1730
02:06:51,458 --> 02:06:52,458
Now what?

1731
02:06:52,458 --> 02:06:54,416
What're you sniffling for?

1732
02:06:56,458 --> 02:07:03,458
It was in Pratap-pur that my in laws
had their ancestral home

1733
02:07:04,208 --> 02:07:05,958
You're overdoing it now!

1734
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:09,291
Mother said you'd been there
only once in your life

1735
02:07:09,375 --> 02:07:11,291
That too over 50 years ago!

1736
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:13,500
So why this sudden surge of grief?

1737
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:14,833
True!

1738
02:07:14,958 --> 02:07:17,458
I went there only once...

1739
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:20,458
...but I wanted to spend my life there
with my husband!

1740
02:07:20,541 --> 02:07:23,208
No insight despite all your degrees!

1741
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:24,416
So what're you waiting for?

1742
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:26,416
You don't need passports or visas...

1743
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:28,250
...go make a visit!

1744
02:07:28,791 --> 02:07:30,166
I did!

1745
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,416
You did?

1746
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:33,416
Not to my in laws'...

1747
02:07:33,416 --> 02:07:35,958
...but to my maiden home in Faridpur!

1748
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:41,041
The place has been taken over
by Pak soldiers!

1749
02:07:41,375 --> 02:07:43,416
It's an army camp now!

1750
02:07:43,416 --> 02:07:45,416
Made my blood boil!

1751
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:49,125
Better that it were overrun by weeds!

1752
02:07:50,166 --> 02:07:53,333
I was roaming around sadly...

1753
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:56,166
...when I came across
2 freedom fighters

1754
02:07:58,083 --> 02:07:59,958
Poor young things!

1755
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:02,916
Just martyred in the war!

1756
02:08:03,291 --> 02:08:04,791
Ghosts?

1757
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:06,375
Shame on you!

1758
02:08:06,375 --> 02:08:09,125
Never call the blind blind
the lame lame & ghosts ghosts

1759
02:08:09,208 --> 02:08:10,250
...to their faces!

1760
02:08:10,333 --> 02:08:12,250
It hurts their feelings!

1761
02:08:12,708 --> 02:08:15,375
No one wants to be a ghost
if they can help it!

1762
02:08:16,333 --> 02:08:19,666
They won't be able to continue
their fight much longer!

1763
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,375
Why?

1764
02:08:21,833 --> 02:08:24,041
No resources!

1765
02:08:24,375 --> 02:08:27,250
The freedom fighters are dying like
flies at the hands of Pak soldiers

1766
02:08:27,625 --> 02:08:28,666
No doctors!

1767
02:08:28,791 --> 02:08:29,375
No arms!

1768
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:30,833
No medication!

1769
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:32,208
Just the other day...

1770
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:35,250
...a boy died right in front
of my eyes for want of medical help!

1771
02:08:37,375 --> 02:08:38,625
Come...

1772
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:40,000
...let's go out to the terrace!

1773
02:08:40,083 --> 02:08:43,333
Have a smoke together!

1774
02:08:43,375 --> 02:08:45,250
Want to...?
- Yup!

1775
02:08:46,083 --> 02:08:47,333
Come!

1776
02:08:52,625 --> 02:08:56,125
These cigarettes of yours...
how do they taste?

1777
02:08:57,083 --> 02:08:58,333
Good!

1778
02:08:58,333 --> 02:08:59,958
Like one?

1779
02:09:00,541 --> 02:09:01,791
No, thanks

1780
02:09:01,875 --> 02:09:04,541
I'm not used to it!
Better stick to my hookah!

1781
02:09:05,208 --> 02:09:06,875
Want a drag?

1782
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:09,208
No, thanks

1783
02:09:13,833 --> 02:09:15,333
By the way!

1784
02:09:15,833 --> 02:09:19,333
What news of your Ramkhilaon?

1785
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,125
Any lovers' meetings?

1786
02:09:21,208 --> 02:09:22,750
No such luck!

1787
02:09:23,875 --> 02:09:28,666
Went to look for him
first thing after my death

1788
02:09:29,083 --> 02:09:32,291
I was told that he'd been
reborn a long time ago!

1789
02:09:32,916 --> 02:09:34,208
Anyway...

1790
02:09:34,708 --> 02:09:36,875
...what shall we do now?

1791
02:09:37,291 --> 02:09:39,125
About what?

1792
02:09:39,541 --> 02:09:41,750
Weren't you just telling me
about those poor boys?

1793
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:43,958
Being slaughtered by the Pak soldiers!

1794
02:09:44,041 --> 02:09:46,291
No resources, no...

1795
02:09:47,958 --> 02:09:49,750
Chaitali!

1796
02:09:50,791 --> 02:09:52,041
Now what?

1797
02:09:52,291 --> 02:09:55,208
My box is still there!

1798
02:09:55,291 --> 02:09:57,166
5000 grams of gold!

1799
02:09:57,583 --> 02:09:59,000
5000!

1800
02:09:59,083 --> 02:09:59,791
Really!

1801
02:09:59,875 --> 02:10:01,625
What do you think I'm telling you?

1802
02:10:02,291 --> 02:10:05,916
Why don't you give that box
to the freedom fighters!

1803
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,250
Maybe they can save
our home in Faridpur...

1804
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:15,458
Benu...?

1805
02:10:21,458 --> 02:10:22,625
Just look at that!

1806
02:10:22,708 --> 02:10:25,041
Gone off somewhere
after asking me to come!

1807
02:12:11,958 --> 02:12:13,916
My keys...?

1808
02:13:16,125 --> 02:13:17,250
Mother...

1809
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:19,666
I'm taking what's mine...

1810
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:21,958
...and leaving here what's yours

1811
02:13:22,833 --> 02:13:26,875
How could you have spurned
so much love?

1812
02:14:21,458 --> 02:14:23,083
For Somlata...

1813
02:14:23,791 --> 02:14:27,500
Shimontinee,  (married lady)
I called in vain, you did not come

1814
02:14:28,166 --> 02:14:31,791
By a thousand thorns
your door was barred

1815
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:37,000
Why then in the forest, Shimontinee

1816
02:14:37,625 --> 02:14:41,000
Why then in the mist, Shimontinee

1817
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Did you wander alone, lose your way...

1818
02:14:46,416 --> 02:14:50,250
Why then in the forest
did you lead me astray...

1819
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,500
...Shimontinee?

1820
02:15:02,166 --> 02:15:07,625
Shimontinee, now, in the
searing flame of your eyes...

1821
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,916
...in the flame of the sizzling
red dot between your brows...

1822
02:15:12,958 --> 02:15:17,416
My nights and days
have turned to ash

1823
02:15:17,666 --> 02:15:19,916
Shimontinee...

1824
02:15:20,416 --> 02:15:22,458
...beloved kafer!

1825
02:15:22,958 --> 02:15:25,541
In my love for you I'm forever lost

1826
02:15:52,166 --> 02:15:55,208
For Somlata, woman of the mist...

1827
02:15:55,958 --> 02:15:59,000
Beyond the river,
in the darkening night

1828
02:15:59,833 --> 02:16:02,416
You came to gather flowers of mist

1829
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:07,041
Between us the flowing river
creates a rift

1830
02:16:12,958 --> 02:16:17,541
Creates a rift between you and me

1831
02:16:17,875 --> 02:16:21,125
Creates a rift between
our broken lands

1832
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:23,458
Is that why you came?

1833
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:27,375
Woman from beyond the river,
leaving all

1834
02:16:27,458 --> 02:16:29,375
Is that why you came?

1835
02:16:30,875 --> 02:16:34,375
To build a bond of mist between us?

1836
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:43,875
The train storms past,
shattering the night

1837
02:16:44,333 --> 02:16:47,125
Words sink into the bottomless dark

1838
02:16:47,875 --> 02:16:53,041
Time stops as you gaze into my eyes

1839
02:16:55,958 --> 02:17:01,083
Unearthly stranger clad in mist!

1840
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:08,083
The bonds of mist dissolve in the wind

1841
02:17:08,166 --> 02:17:17,208
You break the transient link and flee,
ephemeral one

1842
02:17:17,791 --> 02:17:19,416
In the frenzied wind...

1843
02:17:20,166 --> 02:17:27,791
...desire for you surges in my veins

1844
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,833
Desire for you!

1845
02:17:34,958 --> 02:17:38,708
Kafer, because I fell in love with you

1846
02:17:38,791 --> 02:17:42,333
All shadows died, stars went out

1847
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:45,333
Seas went up in flames!

1848
02:17:45,791 --> 02:17:48,291
Comets rained from
the heavens overhead

1849
02:17:48,583 --> 02:17:51,791
All creation shuddered in mortal dread

1850
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:54,625
Mountains collapsed in the sea!

1851
02:17:54,708 --> 02:17:58,791
Such devastation, such annihilation

1852
02:17:58,791 --> 02:18:03,666
All because I fell in love with you!

1853
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:07,791
Kafer, because I fell in love with you

1854
02:18:07,791 --> 02:18:10,791
Spring arrived before its time

1855
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:14,958
Every branch was filled
with untimely bloom

1856
02:18:15,791 --> 02:18:19,708
From the ends of the earth
a tempestuous gale arose

1857
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:23,041
And in my veins,
in the flow of my blood

1858
02:18:23,125 --> 02:18:26,750
Time began its frenzied dance

1859
02:18:27,541 --> 02:18:34,750
All because I fell in love with you...
