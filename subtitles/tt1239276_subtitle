00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,280

120
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,920
Mr. Ontel, how much do you know about the law?

121

..he is given capital punishment.

130
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
If someone..

131
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,400
..kills the culture and tradition which is 1000 years old.

132
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,920
What punishment should be given to him?

133
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,920
This man..

134
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,640
..who stands shamelessly..

135
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
..and calls himself an artist.

136
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
He is a stain to humanity.

137
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
He is a danger to the society.

138
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,880
This man in the name of art..

139
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
..has spread filth in the society.

140
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,360
Has hurt the society's norms.

142
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,760

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,880
..has hurt the sentiments of 1000 of people.

144
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,960
Mr. Ravi Verma.

145
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,080
Please explain to the court.

146
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Are you married?

147
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,560
Yes.

148
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,040
Is it true that after your marriage for a long time..

149
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,080
..you was staying at your in-laws place..

150
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,040
..and enjoying life with her wealth.

151
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I feel you know about me better than me.

152
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,400
But you have forgotten that the place I come from..

153
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,360
..the husband stays in his wife's home after marriage.

154
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,400
And my wife was a princess.

155
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
No!

156
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,720
I want to see you.

157
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
The whole.
- Come on.

158
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Are you crazy?

159
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,640
What are you doing?

160
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
I am getting ready to paint.

161
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,120
Painting? Whose painting?

162
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,520
Yours!

163
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,760
Come on.

164
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,880
In our family the husbands don't do such lowly job.

165
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,720
Then what do they do?

166
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,120
They just enjoy. That's it.

167
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
What are you doing?

168
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,560
Nothing.

169
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Don't move.

170
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Stand still.

171
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,520
How did you like it?

172
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,880
You may leave.

173
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,080
Stop!

174
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,640

176
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,440
What are you doing?

I am tired.

178
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,360
Just for sometime. The painting will be done. Then.

179
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Keep your left hand close to your ears. In this manner.

180
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,360
With the right hand the flower..

181
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,560
..you are opening it.

182
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,400
Like this. This position.

183
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,840
Are you only a painter?

184
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
And I a thing which you want to paint.

185
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,000
"In your heart and soul..

186
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,480
..I lost my heart."

187
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,880
"My dreams came true."

188
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,800
"Your eyes are mesmerizing."

189
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,040
"I am not in my senses."

190
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,440
"In one look I die thousand times."

191
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,920
"It opens up my desires."

192
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,400
"O Kamini! O Kamini!!"

193
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,440
"O Kamini!"

194
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
"Your skin."

195
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
"Is like a mirror."

196
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,200
"I gift you the rainbow."

197
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,160
"Let me wrap myself."

198
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,280
"Just lie the earth covers itself by the sky."

199
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,760
"We have met since..

200
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,640
..the stars didn't shine."

201
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,240
"Just think what life has to say."

202
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
"Flow along with me."

203
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,280
"O Kamini! O Kamini!!"

204
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:08,320
"O Kamini! O Kamini!!"

205
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,480
Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,880
About what?
- About what? To touch the untouchables.

207
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,240
And for this dirt.

208
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,480
Everyone laughs at me because of you.

209
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,440
Is this the way to mingle with servants?

210
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,920
God knows what things you do with her?

211
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,840
Have you any self respect or not?

212
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,120
For the last time I am telling you.

213
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,680
I won't allow this in my house.

214
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,960
I don't care.

215
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,040
Raja Ravi Verma.

216
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,600
Will you tell the court..

217
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,640
..which is your Kingdom?

218
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,280
You won't be spared if you are silent.

219
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,840
The King of art.

220
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Wow! That's great. Good.

221
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,800
But. As you call yourself a King.

222
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,200
You should have a Kingdom too. In reality.

223
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,080
Not in your thoughts.

224
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,680
Tell me.

225
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,720
Where is your Kingdom?

226
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,040
In the competition of Madras painting..

227
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,840
..where the painters from India and Europe have taken part.

228
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,920
There our royal painter..

229
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,240
..got the top most award.

230
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Ravi Verma from Travancore..

231
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,680
..for his beautiful painting called a lady..

232
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,280
..where he has mixed east and west..

233
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,080
..paintings.

234
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,320
The golden coin of the governor is given as an award.

235
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,920
Even ants have learnt to fly.

236
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Though you are my brother.

237
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,800
But you have no right to insult an artist.

238
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,280
Ravi Verma.

239
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,040
You are the pride of Travancore.

240
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,640
You have revered this kingdom with your painting.

241
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
Please accept this award.

242
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,560
I, Ayilyam Thirunal, the King of Travancore.

243
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,280
Bestow you with the title of King.

244
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,160
King. Henceforth you will be known as Raja Ravi Verma.

245
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
No one must say.

246
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
That a artist is not equal to a king.

247
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,640
"Painter."

248
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,520
"Painter."

249
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,520
"Painter. Painter."

250
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,120
"Painter. Painter."

251
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,280
"Painter. Painter."

252
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,960
"Painter. Painter."

253
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,680
"Painter. Painter."

254
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
Brother Ravi.

255
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,480
Brother Ravi.

256
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
Brother Ravi.

257
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,600
Brother Ravi.

258
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Everything is over.

259
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,080
What?
- The King is no more.

260
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,240
I am very sorry to hear the news.

261
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,000
Now what do you intend to do?

262
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
I haven't thought about it.

263
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,040
Then think about it.

264
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
Two lions don't stay in one jungle.

265
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,560
And this Kingdom is too small for 2 kings. Raja Ravi Verma.

266
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
I am grateful to you.

267
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,400
You relieved me of my dilemma.

268
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,720
From a King to a pauper in just one moment?

269
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,080
Just like as if it was a dream.

270
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,760
If we could change our lives.

271
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,840
If I wouldn't come to Bombay. This wouldn't take place.

272
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,400
Madhavrao was the chief administrative..

273
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
..officer of Baroda state.

274
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
He asked me to come to Bombay.

275
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Welcome to Bombay, Ravi!

276
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,760
I hope you will like Bombay.

277
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,880
Consider this as your own house.

278
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,000
I am very grateful to you, sir.

279
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,800
I like your art.

280
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,720
And the artist too.

281
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,960
I don't know whether that artist is alive or not.

282
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't worry. I won't let that artist die so easily.

283
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,320
Bombay is the city of dreams.

284
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
The talented one are well thought off.

285
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,120
Now give a smile.

286
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,160
Forget the past and start a new life.

287
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,880
What is it? Why are you following me?

288
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,280
I am an artist.
- Artist? What is your art form?

289
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,720
To stare at girls. To follow them.

290
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,280
Aren't you ashamed?

291
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,640
You are mistaken.

292
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,760
I understand you very well.
I have come across many like you.

293
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,720
You deserve a slap. Shameless!!

294
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,840
Enough.

295
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,400
I thought you would resurrect my talent.

296
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,400
But I was wrong.

297
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,600
I don't know who you are but whoever you are.

298
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
God knows how many are crazy for you.

299
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,960
But don't forget that you won't be beautiful forever.

300
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,240
It will subside just like the youth.

301
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,320
But my art will remain. Forever.

302
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,880
Bhackubai. The girl is growing up.

303
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,360
Have you thought about her or not?

304
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,280
Their mother died and they are my responsibility now.

305
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,600
If you are their aunt then you will have..

306
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,320
..to do something about it. Right?

307
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,920
Alright. You spread the word. Let's see.

308
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,160
Where did you go?

309
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,920
"He thinks I am crazy."

310
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,360
"He thinks I am crazy."

311
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,000
"My friends tease me."

312
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:12,560
"My eyes are speaking. Listen dear."

313
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,040
Did you know that I would come?

314
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
Just like from heaven.

315
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,240
You didn't tell me.

316
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,280
You knew I would come.

317
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,480
Like an inspiration.

318
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,440
Let's start from Saraswati.

319
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,680
The goddess of Knowledge and art.

320
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
Please come!

321
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,440
Consider you are a goddess.

322
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,160
How do I know how a goddess is?

323
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,720
Absolutely. It is my job to make you feel like one.

324
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,600
"Painter. Painter."

325
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,720
"Painter. Painter."

326
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,600
"All these are your colours."

327
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,440
"Orange is like the sun set at dusk."

328
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,640
"My tresses are black."

329
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,960
"Just like flowing from your eyes."

330
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,920
"Red. Yellow. Green. Pink. Golden."

331
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,560
"You are one. But there are different shades."

332
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,200
"Colour me. Colour me. Colour me."

333
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,400
"The blue sea is swaying. Flowing. Swinging."

334
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,560
"I am the colour that you choose."

335
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,040
"Painter."

336
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,960
"Painter."

337
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:20,600
"Painter. Painter. Painter."

338
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,800
It's very pretty.

339
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,920
You are pretty.

340
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,920
What do you know about me?

341
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,680
Nothing at all.

342
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
Whatever I know..

343
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,760
..is enough for me.

344
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,360
Where did you get me, sir?

345
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,600
My dear painter. There is a world outside your paintings.

346
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
I want you to see it.

347
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,640
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please be seated?

348
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,920
The meeting is about to begin.

349
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,240
Indian National Congress is the symbol of our nationality.

350
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
Do you know who is he?
- He is a painted.

351
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,320
Raja Ravi Verma.
- It is an organisation for our country.

352
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
The Viceroy says.

353
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,680
India is not a country nor it was in the past.

354
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,440
He can't believe from Balochistan to Burma.

355
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,280
Kashmir to Kanyakumari.

356
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,080
People from here can unite and get freedom.

357
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,720
I say he is wrong.

358
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,480
Freedom is my birth right.

359
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,120
And I shall have it.

360
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,080
Do you read Times of India?

361
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,600
To know about the world and to move with time..

362
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,560
..read Times of India. It's the voice of India.

363
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,920
Do you have Rs.5?

364
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,680
Times of India will be delivered
to your residence for a year.

365
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,200
Every day without fail.

366
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Thank you. Have a nice day!!

367
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,200
But you don't even know my name?

368
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,080
Don't worry. I know. Raja Ravi Verma.

369
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,080
Pachan!

370
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
Pa.
- Yes.

371
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
Any news about Sugandha?

372
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,040
She should have come by now. Right?

373
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,240
Why is she so late? Go and find out.

374
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,240
Stop. It's not needed.

375
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,400
Is she sick?

376
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,920
She was fine until yesterday. Right?

377
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Pachan. Tell the boss not to worry so much.

378
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
Tell her not to worry me.

379
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
Do you think it's a joke?

380
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,640
Is it a joke?

381
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,080
Pachan, why is she so late?

382
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,520
Is she sick?

383
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,360
She was fine until yesterday. Right?

384
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,280
Who gave you the right to tarnish me?

385
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
It's not a tarnish.

386
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,800
It's colour.

387
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
Higher!

388
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,320
More higher.

389
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,320
More higher.

390
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,400
You may go to heaven while jumping. You may fall.

391
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,280
I am not scared.

392
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,800
I have to go for a party.

393
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
Will you come with me?

394
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,040
Devi. To some party?

395
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
No.

396
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,160
Suganda!

397
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,920
Others will also be there. I can't come.

398
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,880
Then we will go elsewhere.

399
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,560
Where?

400
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
We will take a boat and go in the sea.

401
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,560
Far. Somewhere far.

402
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,680
Only the sound of waves and..

403
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
..only the moon watching us.

404
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,440
What if we get lost?

405
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
We will find an island.

406
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,080
I. I can't wait after the sun sets.

407
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,880
Wait!

408
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
Someone or the other will search our island.

409
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,720
If not today then tomorrow. Then.

410
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,640
Hello sir.
- Hello!

411
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,920
The painter Raja Ravi Verma.
- Hello!

412
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,280
I am pleased to meet you.

413
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
Please come!

414
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,840
Hello!

415
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,040
Hello!

416
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,640
Hello!
- Hello!

417
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,040
The painter Raja Ravi Verma.

418
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,160
Hello!

419
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,160
What is this Indian National Congress about?

420
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,520
Hello!
- Fenny! -Hello!

421
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,800
Some people who learnt English wants to play politics.

422
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
That is Seth Hirachand. He has a mistress.

423
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,600
She is young.

424
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,120
Younger than his grand daughter.

425
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,200
He may be around 70 years.

426
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,200
God knows what he does with her.

427
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,920
This is a joke. What will you do with freedom?

428
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,520
Will you eat it?

429
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,160
What do you think about it, Raja Ravi Verma?

430
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,760
Should we get freedom?

431
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't understand politics.

432
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
I am just an artist.

433
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,120
But I know that art is always free.

434
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,400
This is a camera. It takes photograph.

435
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
You get pictures which look real.

436
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,600
Is it?

437
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,600
Can we have a look?

438
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,960
Absolutely! Come.

439
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,520
Pachan!

440
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,560
Let's start our work.

441
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,240
Please! Come on.

442
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,520
Come on.

443
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,280
Go!

444
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Hold! Hold it!

445
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,360
Keep your left hand up not your right.

446
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,080
Keep your left hand up and right down.

447
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,480
Open your fingers.
- Hello!

448
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,680
Hello Ravi!

449
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,080
Hello Fenny.

450
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,080
My!! You look lovely!!

451
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,280
Thank you.

452
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,760
What is this?

453
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,480
What?

454
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,120
We had decided yesterday that we would go to watch a play.

455
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,800
Ravi, you always forget.

456
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
I am sorry.

457
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,640
I hope it's not too late.

458
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,960
No. But it will. Get ready quickly.

459
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Sit down for some time. I will get ready quickly.

460
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,000
Suganda!!

461
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,280
Bye.

462
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,560
Suganda!!

463
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,680
Go! Go away! I won't wait for you.

464
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,080
Welcome sir.

465
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,160
Ravi. There is a good news for you.

466
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,920
This was a golden opportunity in our life.

467
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,240
The King of Baroda called me personally.

468
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,400
When I was in Europe, I saw very interesting paintings.

469
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,960
What paintings!? What painters!?

470
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,960
I am ashamed why the painters here can't paint so well.

471
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,480
Go to Europe and look at the paintings there.

472
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,080
And make some copies for my court hall.

473
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,040
I am sorry, sir.

474
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,680
I can't do this.

475
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,640
What are you saying?
- I will explain.

476
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,240
Don't take me wrong.

477
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,280
There is a treasury of stories in our country too.

478
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,640
One story greater than the other.

479
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,400
These stories will surprise the world.

480
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,760
Ramayana. Mahabharata.

481
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,960
I want to show these stories to the world.

482
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,160
I want to paint them.

483
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,560
Then paint. Start from today.

484
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,000
No one must say that we, Indians don't understand art.

485
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,320
I am grateful to you.

486
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,120
But even now I can't do this.

487
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,640
I will need to make preparations.

488
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,238
I will have to visit the whole country. And.

489
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,400
I will need to understand where these stories started.

490
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,080
And for that..

491
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,480
..it will take time.

492
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,480
I will wait.

493
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,240
Officer, give him whatever he needs.

494
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,400
Let's see whether he paints as well as he talks.

495
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,880
"I am present everywhere."

496
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:18,640
"But you are not to be seen."

497
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:28,960
"O.. No one can find..

498
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,160
..your path."

499
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,120
"Who is he? Open up the secret."

500
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,800
"Open up the closed doors."

501
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,720
"Open up the closed doors.
- Open up my senses."

502
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,760
"I search for you every nook and corner."

503
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,760
"When it is dawn, I get up and I find you there."

504
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,080
"There are flowers everywhere. We smiled when you bloomed."

505
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:29,160
"The sun is touching the ground.
You are glowing like light."

506
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,720
"Your beauty is all around."

507
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,960
"I am following you blindly."

508
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:49,680
"Like someone is pulling me."

509
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,440
"Open up my senses."

510
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,680
"Open up my senses. Open up my senses."

511
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,320
"I am searching you everywhere."

512
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,300
"O.."

513
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,920
"O.. Open up. Open up."

514
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,920
"Every path. Every lane."

515
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:45,040
"Each river. Each lake. Day and night."

516
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:55,320
"You are in every kingdom. In everything I see you."

517
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,400
"You are in every corner. I am in you. You are in me."

518
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,120
"Come, follow me. Leave everything aside."

519
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,920
"Open up my senses."

520
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,160
"Open up my senses. Open up my senses."

521
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,200
"Open up my senses."

522
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:30,520
"Open up my senses. Open up my senses."

523
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,920
"Open up my senses."

524
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,240
Raj. Send a telegram to the King. I am ready to paint.

525
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,840
"This golden colours. The silver."

526
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,920
"My darling is so entertaining."

527
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,160
"God knows his condition being away."

528
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,400
"With the sun and moon, the night is lovely."

529
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,040
"Where is your destination?"

530
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,960
"Painter. Painter. Painter."

531
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,760
"Painter."

532
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,480
"Painter."

533
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:17,280
"Painter."

534
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:25,280
"Painter."

535
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,440
All your paintings will be put up here.

536
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,600
I will arrange for it to be hanged, your highness.

537
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,560
Are you upset? Tell me without any hesitation.

538
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,720
Very few will see these paintings.

539
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,840
If it could be found out..

540
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,280
..what the normal people think about this painting? So.

541
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,600
Do I look abnormal to you?
- No, your highness.

542
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,400
I mean the common man.

543
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,840
You are not common in any sense.

544
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,240
Alright. Show the paintings to everyone.

545
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,800
Great!!

546
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,040
This will be the first art exhibition for the common man.

547
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,200
Are the paintings ready?

548
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,560
No, your highness. It will take another week.

549
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,280
Alright. One week.

550
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,200
I can't wait longer than this.

551
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,040
Why did you lie? The paintings are ready.

552
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,920
If the King finds out he will hang..

553
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,360
..us instead of the paintings.

554
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,240
Take care that no one sees these paintings.

555
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,960
Hey, where are you going?

556
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,080
Suganda! I need to speak to you.

557
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,040
You thought of me after a long time.

558
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,160
I thought you have forgotten me.

559
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,560
I have come from afar just to meet you.

560
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,720
Leave me. The people are watching.

561
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,760
Come with me.

562
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,000
Where?

563
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,560
Don't ask. Just come along.

564
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,480
You know I can't wait after sunset.

565
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,560
Just once.

566
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,800
For me.

567
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,520
Come.

568
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,680
Come here.

569
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,560
This is you. Mesmerizing me.

570
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,560
Come.

571
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,320
This is when you get angry with me.

572
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,040
And this is you. Having fun with me.

573
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,280
And this is when you go away from me.

574
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,840
Even for a moment.

575
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,440
You can't be away from me.

576
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,600
I wanted you to be the first to see them.

577
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,520
Look!!

578
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,720
It is you.

579
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,240
Just you.

580
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,200
It is you. You!!

581
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,680
Did you like them?

582
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,360
Very much. A lot.

583
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,400
A lot.

584
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,920
I don't know why I met you.

585
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:12,440
"Painter."

586
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,720
Ravi.

587
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,840
Now I don't fear death.

588
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,800
You have shown me the face of god here.

589
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,280
Get aside. Get aside.

590
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,160
Get aside.

591
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,200
Ravi, you are really famous.

592
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,320
Chintamani has come personally to see it.

593
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Come with me.

594
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,360
Master, hello.

595
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,160
Pretty. Very pretty.

596
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,800
Raja Ravi Verma.

597
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,840
He is King Chintamani.

598
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,520
He is the scholar of Sanskrit, Sachiv Maharaksha trust.

599
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,800
Trustee of 15,000 temples.

600
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,520
No. 18,000.

601
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,960
I am sorry. 18,000 temples.

602
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,800
You must be the member of my trust.

603
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,600
We do a lot for the upliftment of the society.

604
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,640
That's good. But I am busy.

605
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,240
You need to make time.

606
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,680
It is for your good.

607
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,920
You will make new connections. Your network will increase.

608
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,240
All the powerful people of the trust will support you.

609
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,280
Thanks a lot. But.

610
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,680
I don't need them.

611
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,280
Who gave you the permission to paint gods?

612
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,560
The gods.

613
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,160
Is it?

614
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,320
In my dreams.

615
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,240
God's can't be painted in human forms.

616
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,800
The gods and goddess are better in the temple.

617
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,160
They are not for everyone.

618
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,960
Who made this rule?

619
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,960
Your trust?

620
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,080
I am sorry. I don't believe such nonsense.

621
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,680
Egoistic. Non believer.

622
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,600
Raj, escort him out.

623
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,400
Remember this moment.

624
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,920
Get aside.
- "Ram. Ram. Ram."

625
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,200
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

626
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,200
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

627
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,760
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

628
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,040
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

629
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,280
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

630
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,840
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

631
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,240
"Ram. Ram. Ram."

632
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,120
Once again the great stories of India came alive.

633
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,280
The gods got their face. Their identity.

634
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,400
These pictures were a finding.

635
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,880
The search for the soul of India.

636
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:24,560
"Painter.
- Painter."

637
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,920
Success once again.

638
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,240
Raja Ravi Verma became famous far and wide.

639
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,360
King. Lords. The rich.

640
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,680
Everyone, whoever it was.

641
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,200
Wanted to have the paintings of Raja Ravi Verma.

642
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,440
Success and money..

643
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,800
..if it doesn't make you mad. Where else would it lead?

644
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,560
Good evening sir. I am Phalke. Dhondi Raj Govind Phalke.

645
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,640
I was with Mr. Wilson. The Photographer.

646
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,920
I want to work with you.

647
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Why? -I want to learn from you.
- I am a student of J.

648
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,120
J. School of arts.
- I have learnt everything.

649
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,960
Painting. Drawing. Oleography. Lithography.

650
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,640
And I also know English.

651
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,360
Meet me tomorrow.

652
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,360
Thank you. Thank you very much sir. Thank you very much sir.

653
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,280
Show?

654
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,000
There it goes.

655
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,080
There it goes.

656
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,160
What is it?
- This is fake.

657
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,760
What nonsense?

658
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,520
The note that you en-cashed at the counter is fake.

659
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,280
What nonsense? How do you know if this is true or fake?

660
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,840
We found out.

661
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,400
You are making a big mistake.

662
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,560
I did not en-cash a fake note.

663
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,920
Show it to me.

664
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,240
I feel it's real.

665
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,840
But it is not. I will have to hand you over to the police.

666
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,000
I have been in India for a year. Now this is happened to me.

667
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,360
Wait!

668
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,840
Take the money from me. This is a real note.

669
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,880
I feel so.

670
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,280
Surely it is a mistake.

671
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,800
Come on friend.

672
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,960
Thank you.

673
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,960
I am Chris Schleizer from Germany.

674
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,760
I am Ravi Verma. An Indian.

675
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,640
What do you do?

676
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,400
I am a painter.

677
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,640
I a printer.

678
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,280
Cheers!!

679
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,800
Are you mad? Now you want to open an printing press.

680
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,680
If he can print a fake note which..

681
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,600
..looks so real then just think..

682
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,600
..what he can't do with our paintings.

683
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,600
Oh! Now you want to print copies of your paintings.

684
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,200
This is the latest craze in Europe.

685
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,440
One machine can print 500 pages.

686
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,560
In 8 hours in 14 colours.

687
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,960
The perfect knowledge of auto technology.

688
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,680
Yes. Besides this.

689
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,160
I have seen his paintings.

690
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,200
Fantastic.

691
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,600
Very exotic.

692
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,120
A painting and 1000 prints.

693
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,560
Sell it in India, Europe, America, the world over.

694
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,640
It will sell like hot cake.

695
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,680
But I don't like cakes.

696
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,920
Come here. Do you know what you are doing?

697
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,560
If we do it only then we will know.

698
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,880
How can you say that Schleizer won't cheat you.

699
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,560
I know he won't.

700
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,280
How much will be the cost of this printing press?

701
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,920
Rs. 200,000..

702
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,320
..200,000?

703
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,160
Thank you Mr. Schleizer. I think we must leave.

704
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,080
Wait!

705
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,560
How much money we have in the bank?

706
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,360
Around 50,000.

707
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,240
If we take loan?

708
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,600
How are you playing with fire?

709
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,640
As I can't forget the face of that old man..

710
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,200
..who was worshipping my painting. Our painting.

711
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,720
Telegram.

712
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,960
How much is it?
- Still more is needed.

713
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,200
How much?

714
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,400
Around 100,000.

715
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,400
Send a telegram to Madhavrao. He will do something about it.

716
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,960
Madhavrao will not do anything.

717
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,400
He is no more.

718
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,000
People want to see life on the face..

719
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,240
..of an artist not a look of death.

720
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,800
Your dreams require people like them.

721
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,840
Be happy. Confident.

722
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,400
You will get what you want.

723
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,400
Smile. When you smile you look great.

724
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,880
Good. Very good.

725
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,880
Good idea!

726
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,000
Printing press?

727
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,240
Good idea!

728
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,560
What are you saying, sir? Its a wonderful idea.

729
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,040
You will have to finance it.

730
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,480
I won't finance it.

731
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,280
Why?
- Business. Who will run it?

732
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,280
I will.

733
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,600
Did you ever venture into business?

734
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,800
This is not just business for me.

735
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,320
That's it. That's the reason I won't finance it.

736
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,560
Look, an artist can't be a business man.

737
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,920
A business man can't be an artist.

738
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,440
Listen.

739
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Look, you are happy with your art.

740
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,480
I am happy only with money.

741
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,040
Will you be my partner?

742
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,920
You take care of the art. I will take care of the business.

743
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,920
Believe me.

744
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,320
We will earn lot of money.

745
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,720
As.

746
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,520
Nothing sells like religion in this world.

747
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,240
Raja Ravi Verma's prints connected the whole country.

748
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,120
For the first time these colourful paintings..

749
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,240
..reached every house in the nation.

750
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,280
The sari's that the model's of Ravi Verma wore..

751
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,200
..were accepted by the ladies of India.

752
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,200
It became the identity of the women in India.

753
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,840
Loads of letters.

754
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,080
Did you hear that the whole post office..

755
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,840
..is filled with one man's letters?

756
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,800
So you are now the real King.

757
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,600
And this are your people.

758
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,800
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

759
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,760
Stop there.

760
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,760
Kamini!

761
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,200
I wanted to meet you.

762
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,640
I want to show you something.

763
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,320
Come with me.

764
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,360
We were never let to go inside the temple.

765
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,960
Never since ages.

766
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,040
Always the gods were in.

767
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,200
And we were outside.

768
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,080
You got them out and let us meet him.

769
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,560
This man has accepted that he..

770
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,880
..made art and religion a business.

771
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,440
Art. Which was a part of the temples and palace once.

772
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,320
Today it is being sold on streets.

773
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,120
It has become an advertisement for soaps and oil.

774
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,320
It is hung on the walls of prostitutes houses.

775
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:37,680
Your honour, this man's art is supporting such a culture..

776
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,880
..where god is money.

777
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,160
But I don't see any filth in these pictures.

778
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,680
Your honour.

779
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,600
Thousands of people feel..

780
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,120
..maybe the goddess appeared to him.

781
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,560
But later they came to know.

782
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,240
The face they considered to be the face of the goddess..

783
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,960
..was the face of a mere lady.

784
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,720
And that lady was a prostitute.

785
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
But this man didn't stop here.

786
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,480
The face that people considered a goddess..

787
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,720
..this man painted such dirty pictures.

788
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,400
It's long since you have painted.

789
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,480
What's the matter?

790
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,760
You are famous. You have money. You have love.

791
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,520
Everyone loves you.

792
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,960
Even then you are so sad. Why?

793
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,080
I am thinking.

794
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,000
About whom?

795
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,880
Urvasi.

796
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,400
Urvasi?

797
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,920
Who is she?

798
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,920
A fairy. Just like you.

799
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,000
Urvasi. The one..

800
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,960
..who loved a human being.

801
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,200
She has started to love Purushva.

802
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,600
Purushva.

803
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,960
He was a brave King. But he was a human being.

804
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,080
The god accepted this relationship but on one condition.

805
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,720
What was the condition?

806
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,120
That they will not see each other in their real form.

807
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,000
Naked. If it happens.

808
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:51,080
Then Urvasi will have to return to the heavens forever.

809
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,360
Then?
- Then they used to meet only at nights.

810
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,440
She used to leave once it was dawn.

811
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,520
Then?

812
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,000
But Purushva was a human being.

813
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,240
This incomplete truth was not enough for him.

814
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,160
But their love was so strong. The gods were jealous.

815
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,840
Then one night.

816
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,960
When she was draping her sari..

817
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,000
..was getting to ready to leave.

818
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,560
Purushva was awake.

819
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,840
He caught her drape.

820
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,880
The god planned something and there was lightening.

821
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,000
Urvashi's sari slipped.

822
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,360
In that light they saw each other.

823
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,640
Naked.

824
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,360
Then?

825
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,720
Urvasi had to..

826
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,960
..return to heavens forever.

827
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,120
How interesting?

828
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,000
There are so many pictures..

829
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,920
..which will never be painted.

830
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,080
Why?

831
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,720
The story is true.

832
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,400
Who will model for this?

833
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,120
We are afraid to accept the truth.

834
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,320
Actually to be free.

835
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,240
Our thoughts are shut with fear.

836
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:10,280
"Why do you trouble me? My dear, why do you trouble me?"

837
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:19,160
"I don't understand. I don't understand."

838
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:28,400
"I don't understand. I don't understand.'

839
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:43,880
"My eyes are like the arrow."

840
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,960
"When your tresses are away from your face..

841
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,360
..your beauty is seen."

842
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:59,040
"All my senses are awake when I hear your tinklets."

843
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,560
"Beauty."

844
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,040
"Is my being. I am feeling desired."

845
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:19,600
"I am feeling as though music is being played."

846
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,880
"Today I have only one thing in mind."

847
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,840
"Let me be lost."

848
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:37,720
"I want to give myself to you and be pleased."

849
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:46,400
"Why do you trouble me? My dear, why do you trouble me?"

850
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:55,280
"Dear, I don't understand. I don't understand."

851
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,040
"In. Out. And inside,"

852
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,760
"For a moment we are lost."

853
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,080
"Let us unite as if our bodies have turned to ashes."

854
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,720
"Only our hearts will meet."

855
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,520
"I will drink the nectar of your being."

856
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:28,320
"I will paint such a painting
that even god will come alive."

857
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:37,520
"Why do you trouble? My dear, Why do you trouble me?"

858
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:46,160
"I don't understand. I don't understand."

859
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:59,360
"I don't understand. My dear"

860
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,160
Do you love him?

861
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,760
It's terrible.

862
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,080
My paintings.

863
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,280
Pick it up.

864
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,120
Pick it up.

865
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,880
Accounts. Altar roof. Everything is burnt.

866
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,400
We will have to buy some parts.

867
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,120
How much will it cost?

868
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
Around 30,000.

869
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,440
Please don't look at me.

870
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,120
I.. came to tell you..

871
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,680
..that I want to break off this partnership.

872
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,760
I can't take any more risk.

873
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,440
Give me some loan.

874
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,600
What's the use?

875
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,800
I will return it.

876
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,920
With interest.

877
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,960
Don't misunderstand me. But.

878
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,840
What do you have in bargain?

879
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,320
Keep my paintings.

880
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,160
All? Think about it.

881
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,720
We have to start the press again.

882
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,960
Alright.

883
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,280
Then plague started spreading.

884
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,360
Death was all over.

885
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,120
So much pain. How long could one endure it?

886
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,880
The plague isn't in our body but in our soul.

887
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,480
The British government is killing us like animals.

888
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,600
And we are quiet.

889
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,840
Are we cowards?

890
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,760
No. No.

891
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,720
We must burn all the pictures of this painter.

892
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,560
And even him with them.

893
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,960
He has sold gods and goddess for a penny.

894
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,360
He supports the British.

895
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,640
Mr. Pandit, this is a court. Think before you speak.

896
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,840
I am speaking after thinking about the pros and cons.

897
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,640
He is part of the conspiracy.

898
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,440
A conspiracy to destroy the Hindu religion.

899
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,960
That's why the gods are angry. They have sent the plague.

900
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,720
What do you mean?

901
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,360
This plague is the anger of the gods. What else can it be?

902
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,800
1000 have died. More will die.

903
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,960
If this sinner is not stopped.

904
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,080
Down with the British support. Down. Down.

905
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,800
Order.
- Throw him out.

906
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,520
Who are you to decide?

907
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,840
The court will decide.

908
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,920
Kill him. Kill him.

909
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,040
Order.

910
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,120
Where is Pachan?
- Maybe giving water to the horses.

911
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,800
What? What are you staring at?

912
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,720
Do I have horns?

913
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:13,160
May you have the plague.
- Everyone has gone crazy.

914
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,400
Where are you running?

915
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,200
Will you hit me?

916
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,600
Hit me. -No body will touch him.
I will report to the police.

917
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,600
Hit him. Hit him.

918
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,640
Call the police.

919
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,040
He is running. Catch him.

920
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,960
What smell is this?

921
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,360
Rats. The rats have dirtied the place.

922
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,600
What should we do?

923
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,720
What to do?

924
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,680
Keep it with the clean print and parcel it.

925
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,040
It will dry up on its way.

926
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,360
This is not right.

927
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,800
I am the partner of this company.

928
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,440
Don't teach me what is right and wrong.

929
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,320
Who will bear the loss of 3000?

930
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,840
My brother, I can't cancel anymore orders.

931
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,360
Who is bothered about your art during this plague?

932
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,960
Go and parcel it.

933
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,480
Burn them.

934
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,600
I have seen his dreams turning to ashes.

935
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,240
Before time, I saw him ageing.

936
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,720
I have seen the pain.

937
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,560
But never saw him losing hope.

938
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,040
Chintamani is here.

939
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,840
Please sit down.

940
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,320
We are ready to take back the case.

941
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,040
But for this..

942
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,000
..you will have to say sorry to god and the people.

943
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,640
You will have to atone for your sins.

944
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,760
Donate to the Brahims.

945
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,360
Fast for 11 days.

946
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,080
Dip in the Ganges for 21 times.

947
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,760
Clean the staircase of the temple for 21 days.

948
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,760
Thank you for your advice.

949
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,800
It will be better that the court decides my future.

950
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,880
Excuse me. I have lots of work.

951
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,400
So much pride.

952
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,960
The court may let you go.

953
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,960
God will punish you.

954
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,400
That is later. The people will punish you before that.

955
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,560
I will wait.

956
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,320
Ravi Verma, pack your bags.

957
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,400
Your days in Bombay is over.

958
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,640
Yes. As you say.

959
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,080
You.

960
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,840
Don't come to me begging for your brother.

961
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,520
Gajodhar, let's go.

962
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,040
Who is the boss?

963
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,880
Bhakubai.

964
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,720
Raghu, please come in.

965
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,040
Yes. What made you come so early in the morning?

966
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,480
Go in.

967
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,480
Today I keep my shop closed.

968
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,160
I went to the barber.

969
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,360
While returning I thought of meeting you.

970
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,000
Your girl is becoming very famous.

971
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,240
Look.

972
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,120
Is it a woman with a sari or the sari on the woman?

973
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,080
Is it a woman? Is it a sari? Or is it a woman?

974
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,880
The barber has hanged it in his
shop to please his customers.

975
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,600
I bought it for 25 paise..

976
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,760
..25 paise? -Yes.
- Buy all of them.

977
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,760
How much will you buy? It is being sold everywhere.

978
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,320
The elder one has done what had to be done.

979
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,360
Decide what you want to do with the younger one.

980
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,600
Or you will lose her too.

981
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,040
It doesn't matter if she is paralysed.

982
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,200
She has the head.

983
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,000
Aren't you ashamed? Go away.

984
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,920
Stupid, look what you have done.

985
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,200
You shamed us. Stupid woman.

986
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,720
Drop your drape.

987
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,120
What are you hiding? Show yourself.

988
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,960
I know.

989
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,440
You know?

990
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,160
I was not asked.

991
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,120
The press was running in losses so.

992
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,600
I gave my paintings for loan.

993
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,640
He printed it.

994
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,280
And you didn't do anything.

995
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,760
I trusted you.

996
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,160
You cheated me.

997
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,880
I loved you.

998
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,200
You sold me.

999
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,000
I know it shouldn't have happened. I am really.

1000
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,080
No matter how many women you paint.

1001
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:14,160
You will never understand what it is to be a woman.

1002
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,520
Suganda!

1003
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,960
Why did you paint her if she was scared of being blamed?

1004
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:30,160
Are you a kid?
- Don't you know how the society and the world is?

1005
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,720
Or you are acting that you are angry?

1006
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,360
Govardhan Das, this is cheating.

1007
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,320
This is business.

1008
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,280
Don't forget that your press is..

1009
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,880
..intact because of this prints.

1010
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,760
As you are not a businessman..

1011
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,360
..you will not understand the pain of earning money.

1012
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,520
You haven't borne any loss. You have always stolen from me.

1013
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,880
You print 10,000 copies and tell me it's 5,000 copies.

1014
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,960
And you also take commission.
- It's nonsense.

1015
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,240
If this is true then why didn't you stop me?

1016
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,080
Why didn't you check the accounts?

1017
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,000
Why didn't you try to understand the business?

1018
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,920
As you were only concerned with your name and fame.

1019
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,800
You never tried to find out..

1020
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,840
..how much hard work is required to do business.

1021
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,960
You are responsible for everything that has happened.

1022
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,320
You have started this game.

1023
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,240
I will finish this game. It's too much.

1024
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,400
You haven't paid my loan.

1025
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,400
Ravi, this press is mine.

1026
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,960
You scoundrel!!

1027
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,400
How dare you?

1028
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,240
You will take my press. My press.

1029
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,160
I will kill you.
- Down with Ravi Verma.

1030
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,040
Down with Ravi Verma.
- Down with Ravi Verma.

1031
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,320
Punish the culprit.
- Punish the culprit.

1032
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,280
We won't bear the insult to religion.

1033
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,400
We won't bear the insult to religion.

1034
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:53,840
Down with Ravi Verma.
- Down. Down.

1035
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,080
Complete bed rest. I am afraid.

1036
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,560
Your mind is better than your body.

1037
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,120
If you don't get well who will pay my bill. Eh?

1038
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,280
You won't get rid of me yet.

1039
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,640
That's good.

1040
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,320
Fit. Come.

1041
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,640
I hope it's not the plague.

1042
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,960
No. I suspect it's diabetes.

1043
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,000
I.

1044
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,600
Madras competition.

1045
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,800
I had sent a painting, right?

1046
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,840
Yes.

1047
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,160
You did.

1048
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,760
What happened about it?

1049
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,600
I got the prize.

1050
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,880
This is better.

1051
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,840
You didn't inform me.

1052
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,920
You sent your painting.

1053
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,840
I never thought that I could win.

1054
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,520
Sometime I feel..

1055
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,000
..staying with me, you..

1056
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,520
..wasted your life.

1057
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,880
I am happy to be your brother.

1058
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,560
You are crazy.

1059
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,720
Even I am crazy.

1060
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,720
Everyone is crazy.

1061
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,200
Time was changing fast.

1062
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,920
Everything was changing fast.

1063
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,960
Machines were over powering life.

1064
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,600
One day.. I saw such a wonder.

1065
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,400
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1066
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,800
Welcome to the Mother Audisentry.

1067
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,280
We have great innovators..

1068
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,760
..of Greece and Lily Mayor from France.

1069
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,520
I, Manin Saskip..

1070
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,960
..present before you the wonders which beat all the wonders.

1071
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,680
The cinematograph.

1072
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,120
The magic of moving pictures.

1073
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,960
You weren't seen while the show was going on.

1074
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,200
Where did you disappear?

1075
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,360
I was helping in running the projector.

1076
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,040
Do you know to run it?

1077
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,480
Yes.

1078
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:29,120
Why don't you start this cinema.

1079
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,720
Cinematograph.

1080
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,080
Yes. The same one.

1081
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,600
I feel like.

1082
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,120
But it is costly. I don't know if its possible.

1083
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,400
It will happen.

1084
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:42,160
When it happens will you take me as your student or not?

1085
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,920
What is that?

1086
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,480
Pictures moving.

1087
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,000
It's amazing!

1088
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,280
Suganda doesn't want to come here.

1089
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,360
Chris, what makes you very happy?

1090
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,760
In the scent of the fresh prints.

1091
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,720
Will you want to buy the press?

1092
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:22,520
What?
- If I lose the case the people will take away..

1093
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,520
..everything from me and even the press.

1094
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,320
I don't want Govardhan Das gets anything.

1095
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,480
You can run it very well.

1096
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,240
I maybe having only 50,000.

1097
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,440
The price of the press will be much more.

1098
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,440
How much you can give me..

1099
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,680
..that is enough.

1100
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,680
But the paintings? What will I print?

1101
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,520
Keep those paintings too.

1102
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,760
Raja, why are you doing it?

1103
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,040
As you like the scent of fresh print.

1104
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,320
Good.

1105
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,400
When do you want the money?

1106
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,840
I don't want the money.

1107
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,840
Give Gowardhan Das whatever I owe him.

1108
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,680
The rest..

1109
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,520
..give it to this young man, Phalke.

1110
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,120
For his cinema.

1111
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,200
Hey!

1112
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,360
Use it wisely.

1113
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,760
Cheers! For a new world.

1114
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,040
And cinema.

1115
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,840
You have always supported me.

1116
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,120
And I didn't do anything for you.

1117
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,760
This is a small gift for you.

1118
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,120
They are beautiful!

1119
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,280
Now she is your new inspiration?

1120
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,360
She is a friend. She came to meet me. You didn't come.

1121
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,360
Oh! That's why you gave her your drawings?

1122
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,560
You may have told her too how beautiful she is.

1123
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,600
Sugandha, enough.

1124
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,920
How were you watching her?

1125
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,320
I know you are worried.

1126
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,240
But nothing as such.

1127
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,720
Nothing as such. That's nothing to you.

1128
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,040
Nothing. And mine?

1129
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,360
Everything. House. Family.

1130
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,720
Friend. Respect.

1131
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,320
I am doing whatever is possible.

1132
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,240
The court has called me as a witness.

1133
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,680
If I go I will be insulted.

1134
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:50,680
If I don't go they will consider me your partner in crime.

1135
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,520
And this is nothing.

1136
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,400
I never forced you.

1137
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,960
Whatever you did was your wish.

1138
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,040
Now don't blame me.

1139
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,880
Great.

1140
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,640
You play with others life with a lie.

1141
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,360
Use them and throw them out.

1142
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,960
And you are not at fault.
- Sugandha, enough.

1143
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,240
Your art can kill someone.

1144
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,240
But it doesn't make any difference to you.

1145
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,480
You never thought what would that do to me.

1146
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,440
You exist outside my thoughts.

1147
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,160
I.. I.. don't exist.

1148
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,160
Sugandha!

1149
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,120
Are you married?

1150
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,480
Are you a widow?

1151
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,760
What are you?

1152
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,360
Is it you?

1153
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,840
And this?

1154
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,040
Even this?

1155
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,000
Yes.

1156
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,920
Why did you paint such paintings?

1157
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,640
Did this artist made you helpless?

1158
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,840
Or gave you money?

1159
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,600
Or requested, what happened?

1160
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,120
What was the reason, Sugandha?

1161
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,760
Please answer, Sugandha.

1162
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,160
This is a court and you..

1163
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,240
..have vowed to speak the truth.

1164
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:09,200
No woman would insult herself willingly.

1165
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,960
Why did you do this? Answer me?

1166
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,000
As I believe he is a true artist.

1167
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,640
You won't live.

1168
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,240
I won't live.

1169
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,640
But his art will remain. Forever.

1170
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,880
And through him even me.

1171
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,160
Don't explain to us about art.

1172
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,600
We know the art of a woman like you.

1173
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,840
This man..

1174
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,040
..made a woman like me a goddess.

1175
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,160
You made her a prostitute.

1176
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,160
I am the culprit.

1177
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,360
Blame me for painting.

1178
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:09,280
I am to be blamed to paint the god and goddess.

1179
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,040
And a mere woman.

1180
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,440
This woman.

1181
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,640
I am to be blamed to make this woman my inspiration.

1182
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,760
As I..

1183
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,440
..saw a goddess in her eyes.

1184
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,480
Can I ask..

1185
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,840
..who are the people who tell me what..

1186
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,480
..is right and what is wrong.

1187
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:50,880
Who are these people who are ready to judge my art.

1188
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,120
Of my life.

1189
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,560
As my art is my life.

1190
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,920
I am proud of my culture and tradition.

1191
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,400
And it is not so weak..

1192
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,040
..that it will break on seeing a naked body.

1193
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,720
I have roamed this wide country.

1194
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,040
And I have seen amazing temples.

1195
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,160
Ajanta. Ellora.

1196
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,640
Konark.

1197
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,840
Kajrao.

1198
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,760
Seeing the statues in them.

1199
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,120
I didn't feel anything dirty.

1200
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,800
I was not ashamed. In fact it was..

1201
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,720
..so beautiful that I. I was amazed.

1202
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,680
This country belongs to Kamasuthra.

1203
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:01,560
It talks about our body..

1204
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,040
..our soul..

1205
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:08,400
..our beliefs and humanity. It teaches us to celebrate.

1206
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:12,600
I am just a human.

1207
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,480
This is my story.

1208
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,560
I have grown up hearing these stories.

1209
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,240
They are stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata.

1210
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,840
It is from the best stories of the world.

1211
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,720
Among them..

1212
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,320
..one thing is found.

1213
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,320
That is..

1214
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,880
..a woman who was cheated.

1215
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,960
Who is cheater sometime by her husband..

1216
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,080
..sometime by her lover.

1217
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,760
And sometime by gods.

1218
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,520
We all are to be blamed.

1219
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:15,160
Everyone.

1220
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,120
I know.

1221
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,640
I am..

1222
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,080
..to be blamed.

1223
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,320
Your honour, the truth is..

1224
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:47,040
..I am little, selfish, greedy artist.

1225
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,720
Who wants to win the hearts of many.

1226
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:58,080
Who wants to touch more and more people.

1227
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,080
Who lives in fear..

1228
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,480
..that whatever I have in me if..

1229
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,240
..it doesn't come out completely?

1230
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,080
If the changing times will leave me behind.

1231
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,680
I believe..

1232
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,360
..our life's motto should be to be better than art.

1233
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,480
If you tie up art..

1234
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,640
..it will destroy everything..

1235
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,120
..which is beautiful and it has some meaning.

1236
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,200
It will be closed.

1237
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:39,280
If believing this is a crime.

1238
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,840
During the course of this case.

1239
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,200
Some important questions have been raised.

1240
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,360
Can we..

1241
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,120
..stop our thinking?

1242
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,200
Can we imprison art?

1243
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:08,880
Can art, technology and religion..

1244
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,480
..all three..

1245
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,440
..can go towards one direction?

1246
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,280
All the witnesses of this case.

1247
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,280
And keeping in mind all the different outlooks.

1248
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:24,840
This court..

1249
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,920
..releases..

1250
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,600
..Raja Ravi Verma.

1251
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:56,040
This is him. It is him.

1252
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,080
If I could live only in your thoughts.

1253
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,960
But I am a woman. Not a goddess.

1254
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:47,320
After living in the world of paintings.

1255
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,400
I feel the real world is a lie.

1256
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,800
I can't endure..

1257
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,480
..whatever is happening with you.

1258
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,960
I am responsible for that.

1259
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,240
I believe time will prove you right.

1260
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,320
But as we have..

1261
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,520
..seen each other in our real form.

1262
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,400
Like Urvasi, I will have to leave too.

1263
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,800
Whenever you remember me. Close your eyes.

1264
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,400
I will come.

1265
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:43,480
Ravi.

1266
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,520
How long will you hide from the world?

1267
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,480
I don't know.

1268
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,280
I don't feel anything.

1269
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,520
Nothing at all.

1270
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,480
Why are you punishing yourself in this way?

1271
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,040
Who am I.

1272
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,480
This is a game by the gods.

1273
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:35,800
Then maybe you should leave painting gods and goddess.

1274
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,600
Paint real people.

1275
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:45,200
