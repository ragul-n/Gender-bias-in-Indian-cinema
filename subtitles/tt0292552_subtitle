1
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,439
"Ladies, I win."

2
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:49,108
- Now it's my turn.
- We belong to you.

3
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,739
Your name?

4
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,402
"- Brother, it's Nikki.
- Can't she speak?"

5
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,406
A girl's name sounds sweet
only when she says it.

6
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,381
Whisky for a hiccup?

7
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,785
Whisky for a hiccup
and rum for sad times.

8
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,887
Like brandy for a cold.

9
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,992
And champagne?

10
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:19,068
Champagne is like a girl.
Drink it with love.

11
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:21,999
Brother is like this only.

12
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,401
He'd even bathe in whisky.

13
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:30,747
"Actually only after creating
Rishi, God understood..."

14
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,678
He's done a good job by making girls.

15
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,419
Do you follow?
Isn't the boy right?

16
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,423
Liquor in one hand
and a damsel in another...

17
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,261
I want to live and die like this.

18
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,425
Else what will I tell my Maker?

19
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:52,269
"Brother, quickly come
to the right track."

20
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,104
And tell the girl why I brought her...

21
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:01,709
It's my birthday tomorrow.

22
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,043
I can be your birthday cake.

23
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,403
"What is romance?
Nothing but love"

24
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,407
"Tomorrow means nothing.
Reality exists only today"

25
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,411
Don't steal glances or my heart

26
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,153
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

27
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,418
Come close to me

28
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,831
"What is romance?
Nothing but love"

29
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,426
"Tomorrow means nothing.
Reality exists only today"

30
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:01,703
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

31
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,367
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

32
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,376
Come close to me

33
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:51,413
I am crazy about maids

34
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,019
"Their heart winning
style is what I target"

35
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,920
Wherever I see euphoric youth...

36
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,764
I get smashed

37
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,864
I am crazy about maids

38
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:13,877
"Their heart winning
style is what I target"

39
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:17,372
Wherever I see euphoric youth...

40
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:20,716
I get smashed

41
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:25,380
"How do I explain
my condition to you?"

42
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,122
"Tomorrow means nothing.
Today is real"

43
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,058
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

44
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,732
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

45
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,735
Come close to me

46
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,452
Let me drink from yourjuicy eyes

47
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:34,119
"Let me live a few
moments in ecstasy"

48
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,786
Your lips cry out to mine

49
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,455
Quench my thirst

50
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:49,202
Let me drink from yourjuicy eyes

51
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:53,138
"Let me live a few
moments in ecstasy"

52
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,471
Your lips cry out to mine

53
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,815
Quench my thirst

54
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,754
I fancy your pranks

55
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,893
"Tomorrow means nothing.
Only today is real"

56
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,091
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

57
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,426
"Don't steal glances
don't agonize my heart"

58
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,836
Come close to me

59
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,459
Why this sari?

60
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,466
Because no other garment
is as mysterious.

61
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:55,864
A face covered by a veil
becomes even more beautiful.

62
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:02,905
"When the edge slips off the
shoulder, it's so comely."

63
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,151
"Round the waist, it's like
a necklace in the neck."

64
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,421
It's even more intoxicating.

65
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:19,764
It's only the sari that's
alluring when draped or taken off.

66
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,867
I understand.

67
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,105
Will you feel shy
if I stay here?

68
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,840
I can go out.

69
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,434
"No, I won't feel shy."

70
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,438
But if I do blush...

71
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,442
Don't think I am acting.

72
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,945
No need to say it.

73
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:45,947
I know girls very well.

74
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,954
Would you like a drink?

75
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,829
What are your likes and dislikes?

76
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:36,931
I like brightness.

77
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,441
A dim light.

78
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,861
"Why are you saying, no
to everything I say?"

79
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:03,163
"When a girl says no,
she actually means yes."

80
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,897
"- And if she says, yes?
- She isn't a girl."

81
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:27,020
Love means nothing to me.

82
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,424
That's what they all say.

83
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,429
But who can escape love?

84
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:43,833
"Someday, somewhere
this fool will be ensnared."

85
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,440
He'll be in somebody's heart.

86
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,387
I made pea with potatoes
and cottage cheese dumplings.

87
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,389
Shahi Korma and
I also made Kashmiri Biryani.

88
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,998
I made malai kofta and dum aloo.

89
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:12,064
There were 80 items including
sweet dish. I made so much.

90
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:14,805
One minute.

91
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,745
I made your favourite dishes for
your birthday but nobody ate it.

92
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,075
I spent Rs. 10000!

93
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,078
He's asking me to
account for every penny.

94
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,887
I'll talk to him.

95
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,418
Forget it. Yesterday
was my birthday.

96
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,163
Don't talk to me.

97
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,426
We were up till 1 AM to wish you.

98
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,427
I apologise to you. And you.

99
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,203
Yesterday I went to all the
temples and prayed for you.

100
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:54,244
"Ghanshyam, the truth is that
you're just a cook for him."

101
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,439
You're just a servant
and I'm just a manager.

102
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,817
How can he celebrate
his birthday with us?

103
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,788
Okay...

104
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:07,791
What are you doing?

105
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:11,119
No son. What are you doing?

106
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,734
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. And you?

107
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,401
I too am at home.

108
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,399
- Where?
- Right behind you.

109
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,404
"- How are you?
- Fine, sunny boy."

110
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,407
We live in the same house
yet speak on the cell phone.

111
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,251
- It's such a big house.
- Tell me...

112
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,417
Have you woken up early or
are you going to bed now?

113
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,422
I'm going to sleep.

114
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,919
You'll sleep better afterjogging.

115
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,099
How was the party?

116
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,437
How much did you spend?

117
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,036
Double last year.

118
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,710
- Is it too much?
- Not really.

119
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,873
- Let's stop. - Why?
- You run too fast.

120
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:11,652
Am I running too fast or
are you too fast for life?

121
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,882
How old do I look?

122
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:18,795
I am 53.

123
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,889
In spite of being 53
why do I look 45?

124
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,062
I've lived life with discipline.

125
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:27,395
That is why I can jog
and run faster than you.

126
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,403
If you keep running like this...

127
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,745
A day will come when you'll
have to sleep with money.

128
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:42,080
I have a suggestion.
A terrific suggestion.

129
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,252
"- Tell me.
- Sit down, I'll tell you."

130
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:49,417
Why don't you look for a
nice girl and get married?

131
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,420
First tell me how would
you define a good girl?

132
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,162
Fall in love and
everything will fall in place.

133
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,427
What's this with the good morning?

134
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:02,138
"Sir, tea for you and
whisky for your son."

135
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:07,710
- I'd asked for coffee.
- But you meant whisky.

136
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,145
You've forgotten milk in
the tea. Get some ice too.

137
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,379
- So what was I saying?
- Try falling in love.

138
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:22,725
Fall in love. It's great.

139
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,196
There are hundreds
of problems in love.

140
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,199
"Take them for drives,
outings, shopping..."

141
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,996
"Carry their bags,
see films they like..."

142
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,999
"Eat what they like,
make false promises."

143
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,077
How many times have
you fallen in love?

144
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,416
I got married when I was 21.

145
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,417
I fell for your mother
after we were married.

146
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,420
"After she's dead,
I only love you."

147
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,027
Also your business.

148
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,031
- That is why you sent me
to the hostel. - That was...

149
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,362
Those were the best days of my life.

150
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,167
You'd sent me loads of
money and I'd buy everything.

151
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,037
Even today I do the same.
Buy everything.

152
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,370
I neither need love nor marriage.

153
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,373
I'm fine as I am.
Leave me.

154
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,384
You left me long ago.

155
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,719
Now I'm thinking of
how to get you back.

156
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,755
Are you expecting a
call from the village?

157
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:02,189
You always come here to talk
when you're expecting the call.

158
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,093
Is it for me?

159
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,764
It's not like that. If you
transfer the line to my cabin...

160
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,768
"And my line is busy, my father
will have to pay more for STD."

161
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,100
Shall we see a film?

162
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,777
No... you always ask me
to come for a film.

163
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:22,842
And I turn you down.
You must be feeling hurt.

164
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,949
But I can't help it.
I have old parents.

165
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,250
A younger sister I
have to marry off.

166
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,447
Household expenses.

167
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,786
So many expenses and
I'm the only earning member.

168
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,453
But Diwali bonus...

169
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:42,457
- It's not possible.
- Don't worry. I'll bear the cost.

170
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,960
- Sure? - Yes.
- Then do one thing...

171
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,463
The money you were to spend on me...

172
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,943
If you can give it to me...

173
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,207
It will solve my difficulty.

174
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,973
Father? I've sent the money.

175
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,010
Have you spoken?

176
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:04,013
To your father?

177
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:08,419
- But you neither wished nor asked
about his health. - There's no need.

178
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,959
Father always taught me...

179
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,830
Never spend more than
Rs. 10 on an STD.

180
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,429
"Since he called me,
he must be fine."

181
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,201
I sent him the money
order and spoke to him...

182
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,930
Obviously I too am fine.

183
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:26,038
I must make a move.

184
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:33,850
Please take a seat.

185
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,115
Where are you going? Sit down.

186
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,450
Give Mohan whatever
information he needs.

187
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,460
Do I have to keep reminding you
we studied together in college?

188
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,463
I haven't done you any favour.

189
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,468
You got this job on your own merit.

190
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:02,409
"If I can consider you a friend,
why can't you treat me as one?"

191
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:04,413
What is the problem?

192
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:10,411
Keeping distance in friendship
keeps yourjob and friendship.

193
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,757
You think like this
because you live alone.

194
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:16,425
Live in my house from today.

195
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,429
But if there's a problem...

196
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,425
There'll be no problem.
In fact I'll love it.

197
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,098
We'll drink and party together.
Have great fun.

198
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,098
Only then will this
distance be eliminated.

199
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,930
Only you wealthy guys can do this.

200
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,107
One can enjoy without money too.

201
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:36,073
I'll take you out this evening.

202
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:38,916
I won't go to funny joints.

203
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,943
You can join me if you wish.

204
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,450
"Even if you don't want,
you will have to come."

205
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:53,192
The moment that you have
been waiting for is here.

206
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,457
Who will be the beauty queen?

207
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,460
The beauty queen is...

208
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:01,058
A beauty contest gives
a girl self-confidence.

209
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,397
And self confidence helps every man
in society to scale heights of success

210
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:10,841
It is said there's a woman
behind every successful man.

211
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,408
I want to be that woman.

212
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:17,404
I am confident that
in the future of my life...

213
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:21,248
...even if a coward
enters my life...

214
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:24,912
I can take him to
every peak of success.

215
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,227
Life is beautiful.
It should be lived.

216
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:31,420
Don't fritter it away.

217
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:35,423
I donate my prize money
to Mother Teresa's orphanage.

218
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,430
"Didn't I say, one can
enjoy without money?"

219
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:56,449
Let's sit out.

220
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,219
- Where are the rest?
- They are coming.

221
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,241
Your son called from
America last night.

222
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,906
But you had gone to bed.
He'll call back tonight.

223
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,908
The son didn't want to
stay with his mother.

224
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,673
So he went off to America.

225
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,915
He knows his mother
goes early to bed.

226
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,753
Then what is the meaning
of calling so late?

227
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:37,088
"Anyway, son went to the US
the daughter went to Germany."

228
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,765
Now there's nobody to
take care of me in my old age.

229
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,429
Don't worry. We're here
to take care of you.

230
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:47,872
The girls who were here
before you would say the same.

231
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,170
They completed studies
and returned to their homes.

232
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:55,110
"When you complete your
education, you too will go back."

233
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:59,941
Forget it. Get ready fast.
It's time for college.

234
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,386
A new rock chick.

235
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:15,127
I too have seen a new model.

236
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:20,132
Inter college beauty queen.
The name is Chandni Gupta.

237
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:21,804
Find her.

238
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,829
You are a paying guest.

239
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,433
A beautiful young girl like you...

240
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,430
...goes to college pushed around
in the bus early in the morning.

241
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:00,104
And you return the
same way in the evening.

242
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:07,776
I know like everyone else
you too have great dreams.

243
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:11,187
Your own car.
Your own flat...

244
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:15,383
You can have all these.

245
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:17,885
"No, no..."

246
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,391
"Study in the day, earn at night."

247
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,394
Earn in an hour or two.

248
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,172
You are not aware...

249
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,004
I run the Women's
Development Association.

250
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:38,906
"Silly girl, it's free!"

251
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,252
Life is for enjoyment.

252
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,913
Not to struggle.

253
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,825
You have me.

254
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,419
Note down my number.

255
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:02,173
Just one eight.

256
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,039
The rest are all nines.

257
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,139
I'll wait for your call.

258
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,025
"Brother, turn right."

259
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,731
Do you know the Parliament
Street police station?

260
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,070
"Yes, please hurry."

261
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,903
I'm relieved she left.

262
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,407
Forget about her.
Throw her out of your heart.

263
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,413
- Why?
- Manjit saw many girls...

264
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:58,981
But I never saw one like her.

265
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,415
She nodded in affirmation
and made me sit in the auto.

266
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,156
And took me to the police station.

267
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,930
The girl isn't bad but
there's only one way to get her.

268
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:12,927
Woo her with love and
send her away with love.

269
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,436
You are advising me to keep
a cow for one cup of milk.

270
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,044
"Some fish get caught in the
net, others need the hook."

271
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,444
I'll lay out a net
for her. Then we'll see.

272
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,129
Who gave these?

273
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:42,456
I don't know.
A man gave them.

274
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,868
- All right. Put them in my room.
- Okay.

275
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,463
A bouquet for you.

276
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,206
Another one?

277
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:01,918
Flowers for you.

278
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,413
- Your birthday?
- No.

279
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:07,915
Somebody is pulling my leg.

280
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,445
Somebody called me in
the morning and asked...

281
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:39,856
May I send flowers?

282
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,451
"I said, okay. I had no clue
he'd send so many flowers."

283
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:47,864
I've got so many flowers since
morning but no clue of the sender.

284
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,456
I'm equally smart.

285
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:52,459
I called up the florist.

286
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:54,068
Who is sending them?

287
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,468
Who?

288
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,410
How are you?

289
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:08,013
"No, don't say that."

290
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,420
Where were you all these days?

291
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:22,423
Just a minute.
Here to meet Rishi?

292
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:34,442
You are mad.

293
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:44,945
You'll never change.

294
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,451
I'd sent all the flowers.

295
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:54,864
Talk to you later.

296
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,193
Why did you send me so many flowers?

297
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:08,811
Like this?

298
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:13,077
- Yes.
- And this?

299
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,084
That too is pretty.

300
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,092
And this?

301
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:25,828
The mirror?

302
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:31,425
- This.
- But that's me.

303
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:40,434
I liked that. I bought it.

304
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:42,937
I like this and bought it.

305
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:47,448
Now I like this.

306
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,853
What is your price?

307
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:52,923
"Stop, stop."

308
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,449
Hear me out.

309
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:57,792
I give you 4 options.

310
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:04,959
You look beautiful
when you're furious.

311
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,401
What would you like to do?

312
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,899
Or audience?

313
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,407
You misunderstand me.

314
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:17,813
I'm not that kind of a girl.

315
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:21,249
Neither am I that kind of a boy.

316
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,412
Else I'd have shut the door
the moment you walked in.

317
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:25,153
But I didn't.

318
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,415
Don't think I want you forever.

319
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:30,917
Forjust one night.

320
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,262
"Think it over. Once,
twice, a thousand times."

321
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,431
But answer in the affirm.

322
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,166
I turn it down.

323
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:43,438
You might have been buying
girls but I am not for sale.

324
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,438
Forget me.

325
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,848
Not a goodbye.
This is just a beginning.

326
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,044
I will keep troubling you...

327
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:58,221
Till you agree.

328
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,447
One day you will be on my bed.

329
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,388
"Today you refuse,
tomorrow you might agree."

330
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,399
- Shall I tell ajoke?
- Yes!!

331
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:17,841
- Yes?
- Yes!

332
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,745
I won't. I won't tell.

333
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,077
"Aunt, please..."

334
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:28,852
Do you have a tape recorder?

335
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,753
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

336
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,088
This tape has come for you.

337
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,694
"- For me?
- Yes, it contains a silly joke."

338
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,832
Silly joke?

339
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:46,836
Come close.

340
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,438
"Good day, Miss Chandni."

341
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:58,939
My name is Mohan.

342
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:08,389
Many a time I tried to meet you
but couldn't because I'm shy.

343
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,787
I am sure if I meet you even once...

344
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,388
I too will become brave.

345
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,801
I don't know why
I've lost trust in life.

346
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:23,069
I often contemplated
terminating this drab life.

347
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,400
"I not only thought,
I even tried it."

348
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,410
But I was unsuccessful.

349
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:33,874
I saw you at the inter
college beauty contest.

350
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:35,909
That day you said...

351
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,221
Even if the man in
your life is a coward...

352
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:42,422
You could still make him
scale the peaks of success.

353
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:46,420
Life is beautiful.
It should be lived.

354
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:48,429
Not frittered away.

355
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:52,860
That day I felt
I'd got a new lease of life.

356
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:55,429
If you can fill me
with hope from afar...

357
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,841
Had you been close...

358
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:01,878
It is said that there's
a woman behind every man.

359
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,876
Can you be that?
Please don't turn me down!

360
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,379
I don't want to lose my
new life at any cost.

361
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,046
I believe one can
attain God by asking.

362
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:16,155
So will you come to meet me
at Indian Gate tomorrow?

363
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,731
My life is filled with dark clouds.

364
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:30,067
Not the light of the sun.

365
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:35,072
Dark clouds can obscure the
sun not it's blinding light.

366
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:40,811
Funny. I feel I'm in a class
room and you are my teacher.

367
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,946
Do you have a match?

368
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,823
I don't smoke.

369
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,828
Just imagine...

370
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,923
If I spend 1500 out of my
salary of 15000 on cigarettes...

371
00:35:58,102 --> 00:35:59,433
Then I am finished.

372
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,362
I send 7000 to my parents.

373
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,365
I deposit 3000 in an account
for my sister's wedding.

374
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:08,177
I use the rest for my expenses.

375
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:13,373
These guys are strange. They can
buy cigarettes for 50 bucks.

376
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:15,852
But don't have 50 paise for a match.

377
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,383
"By the way, considering inflation,
how does your Dad manage?"

378
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:25,862
My father is no more.

379
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:28,789
Does your mother work somewhere?

380
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,800
- No.
- Do you have a brother...

381
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,837
I don't have a brother either
just a little sister.

382
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:37,999
How do you manage to run your house?

383
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:42,410
We run the house on
my Dad's pension.

384
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:46,250
"Anyway, forget this.
I heard your cassette."

385
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,209
I liked it. I empathise with you.

386
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:53,417
I'm glad somebody does.

387
00:36:54,759 --> 00:37:00,095
"I feel if somebody like you was
with me, I can conquer any peak."

388
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:03,696
I can't say that I don't
understand what you're saying.

389
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,898
But some matters are in the
hands of God not us humans.

390
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,209
I too go to the temple daily.

391
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:16,370
I'm sure my God will
never let me down.

392
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,376
I'm getting late.
I must go home.

393
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:25,879
It's turning dark again.

394
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,383
"Anyway, carry on."

395
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:34,888
This is for you.

396
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,907
How come you're so late?

397
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,151
I'd come earlier but I saw you
playing and didn't want to disturb.

398
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,416
Admiring Chandni from afar?

399
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:04,827
These are my friends.

400
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,093
Shall we leave?

401
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,926
- Yes.
- Join us.

402
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:15,429
- We'll join you later.
- Come along...

403
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:18,841
Come on.

404
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,255
You seem very tired.

405
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:40,454
Actually... I couldn't
sleep well last night.

406
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:41,862
Why?

407
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:45,459
- Dreams...
- Dreams?

408
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:50,470
You'd come and leave...

409
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,467
Then you'd come again
and leave again...

410
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:55,139
- Do you know how?
- How?

411
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:31,438
This is just the beginning of love

412
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,444
This is just the beginning of love

413
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:43,950
"We have to wait
for the end result"

414
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:50,127
Your style is heart tugging

415
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:56,133
Your style is heart tugging

416
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:03,072
"Your name must be
equally beautiful"

417
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:08,818
This is just the beginning of love

418
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,451
These eyes and lashes...

419
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,446
Your make-up...

420
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,120
The bangles and bracelets...

421
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,461
The ear rings and anklets...

422
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,143
Your voice is so melodious

423
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:17,410
Tour voice is so melodious

424
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:23,860
It provides relief to my heart

425
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:30,026
This is just the beginning of love

426
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:04,399
"The naughty gestures,
the fragrance of your tresses"

427
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:11,400
"The red tinge on the lips
the magic of your words"

428
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:29,416
Every man desires you

429
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:35,422
Every man desires you

430
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:42,271
Somebody will be your monarch

431
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:47,935
This is just the beginning of love

432
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:54,443
"We must wait for
the end result of love"

433
00:42:55,453 --> 00:43:00,186
Heart tugging is your style

434
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,889
"I bet your name is
equally beautiful"

435
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:12,733
This is just the beginning of love

436
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:37,417
"In the end, you always leave me."

437
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:41,421
Tell me how can I sleep
with a dream like this?

438
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,424
I won't do this to you.

439
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:48,701
But I want to fall in love
only with the man I'll marry.

440
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,931
And it might be you.

441
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,846
"To marry me, you must take
permission from my mother."

442
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:02,114
If she won't agree
and your love is true...

443
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,385
I will stand by you.

444
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:10,724
But if you ever lose me
due to your own folly...

445
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,390
You alone would be
responsible for it.

446
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:16,730
For this too?

447
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:22,838
But I won't lose you.

448
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,400
Because I can't stay
alive after losing you.

449
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:30,073
That's my promise to you.

450
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:46,225
Have you fallen in love?

451
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,421
No... it's not that...

452
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:53,426
Wrong. I know you are in love.

453
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:55,929
Otherwise you wouldn't
have made 3 mistakes.

454
00:44:57,441 --> 00:44:59,432
But you were just praising me...

455
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:02,378
I was praising your errors.

456
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,871
You are making another mistake.

457
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,374
Love. Because the one who loves...

458
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:09,375
His mind is not on anything.

459
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:13,188
Look at me.
Do I ever make mistakes?

460
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:16,224
Never. Because whatever I like...

461
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:21,391
"I buy it, use it and forget it."

462
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:25,801
Will you drink?

463
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:31,807
There's a mistake in this file.

464
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:37,245
- What?
- In spite of quoting low price...

465
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:39,147
You've signed it.

466
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:48,858
You may go.

467
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:58,163
"You just said, you buy
whatever catches your eye."

468
00:45:58,436 --> 00:45:59,926
Use it and forget about it.

469
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:01,769
How did this mistake?

470
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,372
You too may leave.

471
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:24,384
What are you doing?
Can't you see?

472
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,062
It's not my fault.

473
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:35,065
The car turned towards you on its' own

474
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:37,897
She knows what's in my heart.

475
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:42,811
What's your problem?

476
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:46,007
Lots of them.

477
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,907
These days I'm missing appointments.

478
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:51,414
Singing wrong files.
Forgetting names.

479
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:59,260
I think I should rectify this
wrong. I just need your consent.

480
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,699
- I already told you...
- You buy girls with your money.

481
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,361
But I'm not for sale.

482
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,370
Forget me.

483
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:18,974
Say something else today.
Say yes. Let's go someplace.

484
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:21,044
Why are you troubling me?

485
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,714
"I'm throwing a hook, not troubling."

486
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,880
"If the fish won't take the bait,
I'll have to lay the net."

487
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:31,225
So do that.

488
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,390
Spread the net.
I'm leaving.

489
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,071
May I speak with Mohan?

490
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:49,743
Who is calling?

491
00:47:58,422 --> 00:47:59,821
Chandni here.

492
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,417
I've received an urgent
telegram from mother.

493
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:07,092
- I have to go to the village.
- Anything serious?

494
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:09,422
- No.
- When will you leave?

495
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:12,925
I must leave today.
I'll call you on arrival.

496
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:15,928
"- Don't forget.
- No, I won't."

497
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:17,435
I'll call tomorrow.

498
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:29,446
Why did you send a
telegram to call me?

499
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:33,446
- Coming...
- Cut the vegetables.

500
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,122
All right.

501
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:36,892
I have to do everything.

502
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:38,458
Why has mother called me back?

503
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,294
- Know Dr. Shekhar?
- Who?

504
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,457
He treated you when
you had typhoid.

505
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,960
- What's wrong with him?
- He wants to marry you.

506
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,468
But I don't want to get married.

507
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,472
Are you in love with somebody?

508
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:55,138
No but I made a promise to somebody.

509
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:58,141
- What promise?
- If mother agrees...

510
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,813
I will marry him.

511
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:02,076
I turn it down.

512
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:05,411
Why? And I gave him my word.

513
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:08,418
Why don't you understand
our condition?

514
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,683
We live with such constraints.

515
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:12,420
The doctor wants nothing.

516
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,921
No money or furniture.

517
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:17,423
In fact he's ready to
bear the marriage expenses.

518
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:21,097
"If you get married,
your sister too will benefit."

519
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:23,099
Then help her alone.

520
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,431
You don't have to worry about me.

521
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:27,208
I will lead my own life.

522
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,436
Your father died after
both of you were born.

523
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:34,110
He never spared a thought
of how I'd raise you!

524
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,443
He never thought these
very kids will grow up to say...

525
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:40,289
Don't worry about me!
How can I not worry?

526
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,889
How can I allow you
to marry a stranger?

527
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:45,792
Do I know the doctor?

528
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:49,295
"Right from childhood,
you never obeyed me!"

529
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,195
You argue with me!
Back answer me!

530
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:54,130
"If I obey you, I'm good."

531
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,272
"Mother, I'll chop the vegetables."

532
00:49:59,977 --> 00:50:02,411
- Yes?
- What kind of daughter are you?

533
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:04,813
Look at her!

534
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:08,180
Had you been like her
I wouldn't have to worry about you!

535
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,912
Why can't you live
your life like her?

536
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:14,084
Promise your love to
some boy and run away!

537
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:16,017
At least then I can die in peace!

538
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:21,091
You want to marry me off
but you don't have money.

539
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,922
- Is that it?
- Yes!

540
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:27,430
The boy I'm talking about
will marry me without dowry.

541
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,772
Did you hear that?
Now you can't get married!

542
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:36,209
"If she won't marry Shekhar,
he won't pay for your wedding!"

543
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,244
You'll remain a spinster!

544
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:40,783
I'll arrange for her dowry.

545
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,450
We have a week.

546
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:46,948
I've promised Shekhar!
What will I tell him?

547
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,289
I just want 2 or 3 days.

548
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:52,952
Now the money will come!

549
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,461
Now you'll get married!

550
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:56,455
Go in and work!

551
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,457
My bad luck!

552
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,071
May I speak with Mohan?

553
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:15,908
Yes? Need something?

554
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:18,417
I'm expecting an important
call. Has it come?

555
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,414
"No, I'll inform you if it does."

556
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:25,019
Shall we go for the film today?

557
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:26,828
Some other time.

558
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,927
He's not in his cabin. I'll give
the message when he returns.

559
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:35,428
Will you take my PP number?

560
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,432
Yes. I'll just write it down.

561
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,917
I'll convey your message.

562
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:04,727
I gave your message to Sir.

563
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:06,799
In fact I just reminded him.

564
00:52:07,404 --> 00:52:09,395
But he said he's busy
and will call you later.

565
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:13,740
I feel sorry for you.
I'll convey your message...

566
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,720
Now I can do nothing for you!

567
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:05,884
My life is finished!

568
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:09,388
Your sister is on the
STD booth day and night!

569
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,391
And she shuts herself
in her room at night!

570
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:15,735
Is anybody listening
to what I am saying?

571
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,238
"Go, elope!"

572
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,403
What will I do in this house?
I too will run away!

573
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:27,007
Both of you do as you wish!

574
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:28,884
"Go anywhere, do anything!"

575
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:30,417
How does it matter to me?

576
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:34,416
I've raised both of you
with such difficulties...

577
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:37,416
I've undergone such pain!

578
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,158
Why don't you understand my pain?

579
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:44,024
My curses won't spare you!

580
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:46,925
Why don't you understand my pain?

581
00:53:50,774 --> 00:53:53,106
Why are you punishing her
for the anger you have for me?

582
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,104
I'm ready for the marriage.

583
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:59,438
To anyone you want. I'm
doing this for you not myself.

584
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,080
Has Chandni returned?

585
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:36,409
No. But you're a strange man.

586
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:39,753
Chandni kept calling you.

587
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,415
And got the answer that you are busy.

588
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:44,424
He'll call you later.

589
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,192
But not once did you call back.

590
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:50,423
And you're asking if
she returned from the village?

591
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,762
Now she will never return.

592
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,836
She's getting married.

593
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,237
But she never called me.

594
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,705
I think there's some problem.

595
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:04,377
- When is the wedding?
- Tomorrow.

596
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:13,219
I hope you aren't bluffing me.

597
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,385
"If she's getting married tomorrow,
you should be in the village."

598
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:19,384
"No, it's true."

599
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,991
She called in the morning.
We're leaving in the night.

600
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:37,211
So what I said was true.

601
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,412
What is that?

602
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:42,409
You'd made 3 errors in the file.

603
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:48,414
And I'd said you are in love.

604
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:52,224
"Now you can get married,
become a father."

605
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:53,896
Even a grandfather.

606
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,865
My best wishes are with you.

607
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:04,101
"Now tell me, what I can do"

608
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,865
Need money?

609
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:11,370
We have no time to think.

610
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,377
Some misunderstanding
cropped up between us.

611
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:17,376
Now she's marrying another man.

612
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:20,154
You already told me that.

613
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,051
Come right to the problem.

614
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,221
I want to go to the village
to convince my parents.

615
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:30,798
- And I?
- If you could talk to the girl...

616
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:33,994
Bring her here?

617
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:41,408
Kidnap her?

618
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:43,811
Yes.

619
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:55,422
It is possible.

620
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:57,825
Why can't it be done?

621
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:06,029
"Today for the first time,
you've asked a favor as a pal."

622
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:09,361
I'll do it.

623
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:15,037
"- But who is she?
- Sir, you know her."

624
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:20,709
I know her?
She's my type?

625
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:27,879
"If she's my type,
she's not fit for you."

626
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:32,188
No sir. Remember we went for
the inter-college beauty contest.

627
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:36,229
- I remember.
- We saw a pretty girl there.

628
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:38,390
There were many pretty girls there.

629
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:44,396
"No sir, the one I'm
talking about is Chandni."

630
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,251
"Of course, you're sure."

631
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:07,919
She had won the competition.

632
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,025
She won.

633
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:14,926
She's a nice girl.

634
00:58:15,438 --> 00:58:18,430
Very pretty.
You have good choice.

635
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,784
Looks like it's time
to get rid of my troubles.

636
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,453
Write her a letter
just as I dictate.

637
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:44,956
I'll look after the rest.

638
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:03,008
- Isn't she looking pretty?
- That's right.

639
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:13,420
The groom is here!

640
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,424
- Look after this.
- Yes.

641
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:17,164
"Come on, everyone..."

642
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:29,121
I

643
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:32,677
It

644
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:36,233
It'

645
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:39,789
It's

646
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:43,345
It's a

647
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:46,901
It's a R

648
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:50,457
It's a Ro

649
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:54,013
It's a Roh

650
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:57,569
It's a Rohi

651
01:00:57,569 --> 01:01:01,125
It's a Rohit

652
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,681
It's a Rohit R

653
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:08,237
It's a Rohit Re

654
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:11,793
It's a Rohit Rel

655
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,349
It's a Rohit Rele

656
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:18,905
It's a Rohit Relea

657
01:01:18,905 --> 01:01:22,461
It's a Rohit Releas

01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:26,017
It's a Rohit Release

678
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:48,927
Sister...

679
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,116
I am here.

680
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:08,122
What is this?

681
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,790
Letter.

682
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:11,388
What letter?

683
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:17,731
I haven't written it.
The one you promised something did.

684
01:04:19,068 --> 01:04:20,399
Of love.

685
01:04:21,404 --> 01:04:23,065
You will love him after marriage.

686
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:27,899
Dear Chandni...

687
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:30,402
It was very late when
I heard about your marriage.

688
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:34,007
I didn't get any of your messages.

689
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:39,184
I am unfortunate.
Fate was never on my side

690
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,415
When you acme into my life...

691
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:44,859
I'd started living again.

692
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:46,827
But now...

693
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,421
I have no option but suicide.

694
01:04:50,433 --> 01:04:52,424
Only you can save me from this.

695
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,233
If your answer is in the affirmative...

696
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,839
A white car waits for
you outside the inn.

697
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:01,371
Your unfortunate...

698
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:06,871
Now what do we do?

699
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:12,385
Tear it.

700
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:21,386
If this letter had
come right to you...

701
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:23,798
You would decide what to do.

702
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:26,399
But that didn't happen.

703
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:28,797
But the letter came to me.

704
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,737
I will do as I please.

705
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:36,173
I do appreciate this...

706
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:39,808
You had told me everything
about Mohan before our wedding.

707
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:45,217
- So now I...
- Won't you marry me?

708
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,765
As a doctor it is my duty
to save Mohan's life.

709
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:03,102
Look...

710
01:06:04,374 --> 01:06:06,774
I have everything.
I am happy.

711
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,375
I am successful.

712
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:11,176
But Mohan still has
to achieve success.

713
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,372
He has to find happiness.

714
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:21,716
My losing you isn't
very earth shattering.

715
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:24,788
As much as Mohan finding you.

716
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,387
Do you mean I must leave this?

717
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:30,388
And marry Mohan?

718
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,874
But... I...

719
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,402
Me... I...

720
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,906
I will get married.

721
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:50,215
To your sister.

722
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,413
Now go. The white car waits for you.

723
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,018
- Go.
- Yes.

724
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,761
Listen...

725
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,761
Don't forget to tell
your mother everything.

726
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,360
"- Yes, I'll tell her.
- Go."

727
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:10,771
Listen...

728
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:14,366
"If you tell her everything,
you'll have to forget Mohan."

729
01:07:15,378 --> 01:07:16,777
What do I do?

730
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:22,647
Go. I'll handle everything here.

731
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:15,927
Why did you stop the car?

732
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,184
You're smiling?

733
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,449
I thought you'd run
away on seeing me.

734
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:40,122
And I'd have to run after you.

735
01:08:43,132 --> 01:08:44,463
Aren't you afraid?

736
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:49,235
No because you can't even
touch me without my consent.

737
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,474
Consent?

738
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,209
Rishi asked for your consent.

739
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:02,144
Today he is in no mood to ask.

740
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:06,752
Today he will write
a new story in your life.

741
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:11,154
Which you will
never be able to forget.

742
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,019
Come.

743
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:04,274
You begin a new life today.

744
01:10:06,812 --> 01:10:08,803
If my life begins anew today...

745
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:12,140
Then it's the last day of your life.

746
01:10:14,486 --> 01:10:15,976
You're a brave girl.

747
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,220
Let's go in.

748
01:10:30,502 --> 01:10:31,935
What are you thinking?

749
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:34,495
"If you're so brave, go..."

750
01:10:36,508 --> 01:10:37,839
Go on.

751
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,852
"Father, why don't you understand?"

752
01:10:51,924 --> 01:10:54,017
I can't marry any girl but Chandni.

753
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:58,792
"If I marry for money,
later we'll have problems."

754
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:04,459
If your wife doesn't get dowry
how will we marry your sister?

755
01:11:06,205 --> 01:11:07,467
You talk to him.

756
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:11,468
I brought so much when
I got married into this family.

757
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,941
"So much money, jewelry."

758
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:17,148
All got used up in this house.

759
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:20,077
How can we manage if
your wife gets nothing?

760
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:21,885
This is tradition.

761
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:24,478
"Mom, Dad, I'll work day and night."

762
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,484
Come in...

763
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:32,088
Father... mother...

764
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,491
Don't you have any
elders in your family?

765
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:39,095
Is this what your parents taught you?

766
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:42,941
Great are the parents
and great is this girl.

767
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:46,234
What qualities!

768
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,504
Like you I too am a girl.

769
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:52,173
But am I after any man?

770
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,179
Why do you want to
ruin my brother's life?

771
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,249
Can't you find another man?

772
01:11:57,456 --> 01:11:58,855
What?

773
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:01,790
The house is in debt.
We have to marry Meena.

774
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:04,459
There's no money at home!
And you worry about your marriage!

775
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:06,954
What will you get
by marrying her?

776
01:12:07,466 --> 01:12:09,195
Will our worries end?

777
01:12:13,138 --> 01:12:17,472
What do your parents want to pay
off the debt ad marry your sister?

778
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:21,309
Should I go out and do
anything to earn money?

779
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,314
"No, that's not right."

780
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:27,213
"Father, I never
asked you for anything."

781
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:32,156
I never demanded a toy.
I never demanded anything.

782
01:12:33,826 --> 01:12:35,487
Give Chandni to me!

783
01:12:37,496 --> 01:12:40,932
I never refused him anything.

784
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,162
But I can't give him
what he's asking for now.

785
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:45,993
Explain to him.

786
01:12:49,508 --> 01:12:50,998
What do you think I am?

787
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,171
Something you buy from the market?

788
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,503
And you're demanding it
from your father like a child.

789
01:12:57,116 --> 01:12:58,447
It's not like that.

790
01:12:58,851 --> 01:13:00,785
I never asked father for anything.

791
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:02,943
Today for the first time I ask him...

792
01:13:05,124 --> 01:13:06,853
I want you. Only you.

793
01:13:07,459 --> 01:13:09,450
Don't touch me. Stay away.

794
01:13:10,129 --> 01:13:11,460
I want you.

795
01:13:12,131 --> 01:13:13,462
I don't want anybody else.

796
01:13:17,803 --> 01:13:19,202
What is going on?

797
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:21,803
"Father, my boss..."

798
01:13:22,474 --> 01:13:24,465
- Good day.
- Please be seated.

799
01:13:25,477 --> 01:13:26,808
You take a seat.

800
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:30,209
"Father, sir brought
Chandni for me."

801
01:13:31,884 --> 01:13:33,476
Did you bring her here?

802
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:36,477
- Yes.
- Then why don't you marry her?

803
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,287
Don't' feel offended
by my father's words.

804
01:13:41,493 --> 01:13:43,154
He doesn't know what he's saying.

805
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:44,894
- You...
- No!

806
01:13:45,497 --> 01:13:47,294
I told you not to touch me.

807
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:52,766
- What's wrong?
- This man is touching me.

808
01:13:56,942 --> 01:13:58,432
What is the problem?

809
01:13:59,445 --> 01:14:01,208
The house is snowed under debt.

810
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:03,781
Our daughter is to be married off.

811
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:08,445
This girl has spent a
whole night with a stranger.

812
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:14,119
How can we face our
community when they find out?

813
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,223
Who will marry our daughter?

814
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:19,124
We won't be able to mix in our caste.

815
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:24,233
Explain the circumstances in which
I brought her here to your parents.

816
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:27,462
Sir picked her up from
her marriage ceremony for me.

817
01:14:29,475 --> 01:14:30,965
"Father, I want to marry Chandni."

818
01:14:31,477 --> 01:14:35,470
"All right son, marry her.
We will commit suicide."

819
01:14:35,814 --> 01:14:37,475
He has left us with no option.

820
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:40,918
- We'll die.
- No mother. Father...

821
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:47,482
Please leave her back
from where you got her.

822
01:14:48,494 --> 01:14:50,485
"- Is this ajoke?
- No, sir."

823
01:14:51,497 --> 01:14:55,160
I can't sacrifice my
family for one Chandni.

824
01:14:57,436 --> 01:14:59,028
Why don't you understand?

825
01:14:59,438 --> 01:15:01,429
I brought this girl from
where she was getting married.

826
01:15:02,107 --> 01:15:03,438
For your son!

827
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:05,774
Now where can she go?

828
01:15:06,178 --> 01:15:07,440
Where can she go?

829
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,439
Let him get married.
We'll commit suicide!

830
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,851
Good God! Why us?

831
01:15:25,797 --> 01:15:27,128
Come on.

832
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:28,865
Let's leave.

833
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,762
I'll take you back.

834
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,936
"If I go back, my sister's wedding..."

835
01:16:13,445 --> 01:16:15,106
Then let's return to Delhi.

836
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,042
Now I can't even return to Delhi.

837
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:24,253
Everyone is in my village.

838
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:27,953
And with what face can I return?

839
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:35,865
There is one other place.

840
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,970
But you might not approve.

841
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:42,203
My home.

842
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:48,143
No. That might not be proper.

843
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:55,885
Look...

844
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:57,819
All that...

845
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:02,259
I mean... all those old things...

846
01:17:03,428 --> 01:17:04,759
I've forgotten everything.

847
01:17:07,432 --> 01:17:10,765
I've never hurt anyone.

848
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:17,840
But today...

849
01:17:18,443 --> 01:17:21,935
For the first time in life
I feel I've done a wrong.

850
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:27,182
I ask you once again.

851
01:17:28,453 --> 01:17:29,784
Please come with me.

852
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,954
I never let down anyone
who comes to me for refuge.

853
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,919
Where have you been?

854
01:18:37,122 --> 01:18:39,352
"Earlier we'd see you in the
day, now you vanished for 2 days."

855
01:18:39,524 --> 01:18:41,014
"Chandni, come in."

856
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:42,925
Where is Dad?

857
01:18:57,476 --> 01:18:59,740
"Dad, this is Chandni."

858
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:05,950
You are all wrong.

859
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:09,814
Chandni was in big trouble.

860
01:19:10,489 --> 01:19:11,956
Her marriage was stopped.

861
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:14,322
And I think I'm responsible for it.

862
01:19:17,496 --> 01:19:22,991
"I would like her to stay here
as a guest, if you permit."

863
01:19:30,175 --> 01:19:31,506
Take her to the guest room.

864
01:19:33,512 --> 01:19:35,309
Take good care of her.

865
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:36,913
Yes sir.

866
01:19:37,516 --> 01:19:38,983
Follow me.

867
01:19:46,525 --> 01:19:47,924
Son...

868
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:51,325
To date you only needed
the support of girls.

869
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:55,799
Today I see a girl
needing your support.

870
01:19:57,469 --> 01:19:59,130
You have never lied to me.

871
01:20:00,472 --> 01:20:01,962
I hope you're speaking
the truth today too.

872
01:20:09,214 --> 01:20:10,476
Do you want to say something?

873
01:20:11,483 --> 01:20:14,816
How can we say anything
when you didn't.

874
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:16,818
We don't want to say anything.

875
01:20:21,493 --> 01:20:26,487
Go to the guest room and
make whatever she asks for.

876
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:29,490
- Terrific.
- Yes sir.

877
01:20:32,504 --> 01:20:33,994
That's nice.

878
01:20:34,506 --> 01:20:37,498
The son brings a
girl home at midnight.

879
01:20:38,009 --> 01:20:40,000
And the father wants me
to look after her.

880
01:20:40,512 --> 01:20:41,911
What a family!

881
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:46,913
Speak your mind in front of me.

882
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:48,918
Not behind my back.

883
01:20:49,521 --> 01:20:53,514
The tradition of this
family is hospitality.

884
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:56,016
- What is it?
- Hospitality.

885
01:20:56,528 --> 01:20:59,292
- Go on. - Yes sir.
- To the guest room.

886
01:21:17,482 --> 01:21:18,881
The car is ready.

887
01:21:19,484 --> 01:21:21,475
- You too get ready.
- Yes sir.

888
01:21:34,499 --> 01:21:35,830
Sit down.

889
01:21:43,508 --> 01:21:46,500
Our cricket team never
learns from its' mistakes.

890
01:21:50,515 --> 01:21:52,506
I'm going to office.
I'll be back by evening.

891
01:21:53,518 --> 01:21:56,009
If you need anything...

892
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:57,852
Don't feel shy.

893
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:00,117
I've told everyone.

894
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,255
If you want to see a film...

895
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,863
Swimming pool is there.

896
01:22:11,202 --> 01:22:12,464
"No, it's there."

897
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:20,137
If anyone bothers you...

898
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,810
You can...

899
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,472
Call me on my mobile.

900
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:43,160
Why don't you go back to college?

901
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,162
You might feel better.

902
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:50,338
"No, I'm fine.
I don't want to go to college."

903
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:52,100
Learnt everything?

904
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,172
I'll find ajob.

905
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,208
Want to stand on your own feet?

906
01:23:00,952 --> 01:23:03,284
I want to stay in a hostel.

907
01:23:03,788 --> 01:23:05,119
Why? What's the problem here?

908
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,857
This house is quite like a hostel.

909
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:15,797
Are you afraid of me that?

910
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:18,460
That's not true.

911
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:22,235
Actually I've reached
a conclusion about you.

912
01:23:22,474 --> 01:23:23,873
You too?

913
01:23:24,476 --> 01:23:27,809
The girls you kept relations
with were already spoilt.

914
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,142
But you are good with good girls.

915
01:24:30,475 --> 01:24:32,466
You wish me good morning everyday.

916
01:24:33,478 --> 01:24:35,275
Today you seem to have lots of work.

917
01:24:36,481 --> 01:24:37,812
Forget it.

918
01:24:39,884 --> 01:24:41,749
What you did last night
was terribly wrong.

919
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:44,478
I feel like firing you.

920
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,889
But I know...

921
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:49,490
"...your parents, sister,
sister's marriage..."

922
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:51,484
Everything hinges on you.

923
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:55,490
So you can work here.

924
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:58,025
Just as an employee.

925
01:24:58,436 --> 01:24:59,835
You can't be my friend.

926
01:25:04,442 --> 01:25:06,933
"If you need to come
to my cabin, please knock."

927
01:25:08,446 --> 01:25:09,845
Carry on with your work.

928
01:25:25,463 --> 01:25:26,794
Good day.

929
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:28,956
- Good day.
- Please remain seated.

930
01:25:29,134 --> 01:25:30,465
You too take a seat.

931
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:32,459
He's our manager.

932
01:25:33,471 --> 01:25:35,462
In the early days he'd
keep accounts of Rishi's milk.

933
01:25:35,974 --> 01:25:37,464
These days he keeps
accounts of his whisky.

934
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:41,142
He is our cook.

935
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:43,470
Sometimes he cooks quite well.

936
01:25:43,882 --> 01:25:45,474
I've given her coffee in the morning.

937
01:25:46,484 --> 01:25:48,475
- How was it?
- Good.

938
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:52,752
"- Thanks.
- This is Charlie, our driver."

939
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:55,823
"Yes, I saw him in the morning.
Sleeping on his feet."

940
01:25:56,494 --> 01:26:00,225
Actually 10 years ago
I was on the China border.

941
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:02,831
"The eyes of the Chinese
are half closed, half open..."

942
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:05,026
Narrate that later.

943
01:26:05,436 --> 01:26:07,427
Put down the bags.
Please sit down.

944
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:15,105
Rishi sent this for you.

945
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:19,245
This morning Rishi and his
father were talking about you.

946
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:21,042
In my presence.

947
01:26:21,452 --> 01:26:24,444
Hearing that cleared all
the misunderstanding about you.

948
01:26:25,456 --> 01:26:26,946
Consider this your own house.

949
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,121
We ought to be thanking you.

950
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:35,796
For the first time
I felt proud about Rishi.

951
01:26:36,467 --> 01:26:37,798
A sense of pride.

952
01:26:38,469 --> 01:26:39,800
Thanks to you.

953
01:26:48,813 --> 01:26:50,474
Where is Chandni?

954
01:26:50,982 --> 01:26:52,472
She's out in the garden.

955
01:26:52,984 --> 01:26:55,475
- Did she eat lunch?
- Yes. But she's quite sad.

956
01:26:57,422 --> 01:26:59,219
Did anyone say something to her?

957
01:26:59,824 --> 01:27:01,416
"No, she had gone out."

958
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:03,090
She seems upset since she got back.

959
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:24,445
You seem very sad.

960
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,781
No.

961
01:27:27,452 --> 01:27:30,114
Your face shows that
something has happened.

962
01:27:30,889 --> 01:27:32,049
I went to college.

963
01:27:32,457 --> 01:27:34,948
For my certificates.
I met some friends.

964
01:27:35,193 --> 01:27:36,455
And somebody said something.

965
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:38,193
That hurt you.

966
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:40,260
So your mood is off.

967
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:45,461
Let's try to switch
your mood back on.

968
01:27:47,472 --> 01:27:48,871
Not with this.

969
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:51,273
My friend is throwing
a party tonight.

970
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:53,467
You can join in if you wish.

971
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:55,969
If you'd rather not...

972
01:27:56,214 --> 01:27:57,476
You'll still have to come.

973
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:15,496
You're late.

974
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:18,233
No I'm in time.
You've come early.

975
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:30,913
My guest.

976
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:38,921
Don't you remember?

977
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:41,522
Forgotten?

978
01:28:53,538 --> 01:28:54,937
Not today.

979
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,471
The stud has met his match.

980
01:29:50,528 --> 01:29:52,962
The stud has met his match

981
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,463
He has lost his heart

982
01:29:59,871 --> 01:30:04,137
"The stud has met his match
He has lost his heart"

983
01:30:04,475 --> 01:30:06,807
He lives in her eyes

984
01:30:07,478 --> 01:30:09,241
Where is he lost?

985
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,970
Isn't he in love?

986
01:30:14,485 --> 01:30:15,884
Lost his heart?

987
01:30:18,489 --> 01:30:20,150
Fallen in love?

988
01:30:23,494 --> 01:30:25,485
Lost his heart?

989
01:30:57,462 --> 01:31:01,455
"You are innocent.
Do you know..."

990
01:31:03,468 --> 01:31:05,959
The journey of the heart isn't easy

991
01:31:11,476 --> 01:31:15,469
Difficult are the ways of love

992
01:31:16,481 --> 01:31:20,474
This innocence won't let you live

993
01:31:20,985 --> 01:31:22,976
Mind the trap of the tresses

994
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:28,323
"Crazy fool, come with me"

995
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:32,486
You are so innocent

996
01:31:32,897 --> 01:31:34,489
Pay heed to my advice

997
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,229
Fallen in love?

998
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:41,233
Lost your heart?

999
01:31:44,509 --> 01:31:46,500
Fallen in love?

1000
01:31:49,514 --> 01:31:51,106
Lost your heart?

1001
01:32:32,223 --> 01:32:36,489
Your story is on my lips

1002
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:40,896
My youth is only for you

1003
01:32:46,904 --> 01:32:50,499
"What is this
beautiful night saying?"

1004
01:32:51,909 --> 01:32:55,345
"Let's get together
and talk of love"

1005
01:32:56,013 --> 01:32:57,947
Don't jerk my hands and leave

1006
01:33:00,785 --> 01:33:03,447
Don't escape meeting my eyes

1007
01:33:05,456 --> 01:33:07,447
"Goodness, where are you lost?"

1008
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,116
"What is wrong with you, dear?"

1009
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:11,951
Fallen in love?

1010
01:33:14,865 --> 01:33:16,457
Lost your heart?

1011
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,062
Fallen in love?

1012
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:25,965
Lost your heart?

1013
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:36,252
What is your rate?

1014
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:39,217
How much do you charge?

1015
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:47,487
We'll pay a higher rate
than what Rishi is paying you.

1016
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:52,935
"I was asking her, her rate."

1017
01:33:53,504 --> 01:33:55,233
- What is wrong?
- She's not that type of girl!

1018
01:33:57,441 --> 01:33:59,432
You didn't tell us so we asked...

1019
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:02,105
This is a daily affair.
Why are you getting angry?

1020
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:05,847
Didn't I say she's my guest!

1021
01:34:39,483 --> 01:34:40,882
They are fools.

1022
01:34:43,487 --> 01:34:46,081
They have no idea of how to behave.

1023
01:34:47,258 --> 01:34:48,486
It's not their fault.

1024
01:34:48,993 --> 01:34:50,824
- Then is it my fault?
- Yes.

1025
01:34:52,496 --> 01:34:54,487
"Have you ever taken
your mother, sister..."

1026
01:34:55,499 --> 01:34:57,433
...or any good girl
to any of these places?

1027
01:34:58,436 --> 01:35:00,233
You've only gone with
the wrong kind of girls.

1028
01:35:01,105 --> 01:35:02,766
That is why they
mistook me for the same.

1029
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:53,889
What?

1030
01:35:54,091 --> 01:35:55,388
Why are you drinking so much?

1031
01:35:57,428 --> 01:36:00,761
I... I need sleep.

1032
01:36:01,432 --> 01:36:04,094
I wouldn't stop you
from drinking. But so much...

1033
01:36:07,838 --> 01:36:10,432
"I said, I need sleep."

1034
01:36:15,446 --> 01:36:17,175
I have been insulted.

1035
01:36:18,449 --> 01:36:21,441
I never insulted anyone.

1036
01:36:23,454 --> 01:36:25,046
Please go away.

1037
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:29,453
Please go...
I want to be alone.

1038
01:36:30,461 --> 01:36:31,951
I was insulted at the party.

1039
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:33,458
I felt hurt.
So I should be drinking.

1040
01:36:38,135 --> 01:36:40,194
Why are you harping on
about your being insulted?

1041
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,463
Why don't you try to understand me?

1042
01:36:45,209 --> 01:36:49,145
What did you say? I'd never
gone out with a good girl.

1043
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:52,471
I wanted to go with my mother.

1044
01:36:53,484 --> 01:36:54,951
I would have liked
to go with my sister.

1045
01:36:56,153 --> 01:37:00,214
But... I have neither
mother nor a sister.

1046
01:37:00,758 --> 01:37:02,157
Is that also my fault?

1047
01:37:04,428 --> 01:37:07,192
It was you who said
the girls I'm with...

1048
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:08,898
They are already spoilt.

1049
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:11,230
I respect good girls.

1050
01:37:12,837 --> 01:37:14,429
If every girl was like you...

1051
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:17,430
Could I have gotten
spoilt even if I wanted to?

1052
01:37:18,776 --> 01:37:20,107
Leave me!

1053
01:37:20,444 --> 01:37:23,436
Don't come to me
when I am drunk.

1054
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:27,044
I get very emotional.

1055
01:37:28,452 --> 01:37:30,113
To speak the truth who are you?

1056
01:37:30,788 --> 01:37:32,847
I shouldn't have done this.

1057
01:37:33,457 --> 01:37:35,448
Because you are our guest.

1058
01:37:38,128 --> 01:37:39,459
Please go...

1059
01:37:40,464 --> 01:37:41,795
Go away. Leave me.

1060
01:37:42,466 --> 01:37:44,195
"I am your friend, not a guest."

1061
01:37:44,468 --> 01:37:46,800
- Leave me...
- I don't feel offended.

1062
01:37:50,474 --> 01:37:51,873
Sit down.

1063
01:39:25,903 --> 01:39:29,339
Did I cross my limits last night?

1064
01:39:31,508 --> 01:39:32,907
Everything is fair in friendship.

1065
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:37,275
Do you think I deserve
your friendship?

1066
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:39,175
Why do you say that?

1067
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:41,507
I think you're a good human being.

1068
01:39:42,186 --> 01:39:44,518
Only a good human
can be a good friend.

1069
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:47,183
- Sugar?
- Lots.

1070
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,929
What is it?

1071
01:39:55,032 --> 01:39:56,363
Where is Sir?

1072
01:40:03,474 --> 01:40:06,136
Leave the door open
and the dogs rush in.

1073
01:40:11,482 --> 01:40:13,473
I'll have cauliflower stuffed
pancakes for breakfast!

1074
01:40:13,984 --> 01:40:15,474
What did you say?

1075
01:40:16,487 --> 01:40:18,148
- Anything will do.
- Really?

1076
01:40:41,512 --> 01:40:43,503
- Sir!
- What's wrong?

1077
01:40:44,515 --> 01:40:46,506
Where are your feet?
Bless me!!

1078
01:40:47,017 --> 01:40:49,508
All right. What day is it?

1079
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,286
Days don't matter. It's
morning when you open your eyes.

1080
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:55,517
Tell me what net you laid out...

1081
01:40:56,026 --> 01:40:57,459
...that the fish came home.

1082
01:40:57,861 --> 01:40:59,226
It's not what you think.

1083
01:40:59,463 --> 01:41:02,125
- Then what is it?
- It's a long story.

1084
01:41:04,068 --> 01:41:07,469
Forget the story. I got
something else for you.

1085
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,471
The number is...

1086
01:41:13,877 --> 01:41:15,242
I don't want it.

1087
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:16,969
But sir...

1088
01:41:17,481 --> 01:41:19,472
I booked the Honda City
thinking you...

1089
01:41:21,485 --> 01:41:24,477
"If you turn me down,
I'll have to sell my Matiz..."

1090
01:41:24,555 --> 01:41:26,284
Take back your words.

1091
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:28,481
- I don't want it.
- No?

1092
01:41:29,493 --> 01:41:31,324
I think my bad days begin...

1093
01:41:32,496 --> 01:41:35,488
"Lord, you're my only hope."

1094
01:41:48,512 --> 01:41:50,343
I think my bad days have begun.

1095
01:41:50,514 --> 01:41:51,913
Now what's up?

1096
01:41:53,517 --> 01:41:55,109
- What is this?
- Rat.

1097
01:41:55,519 --> 01:41:58,249
- Where?
- I first saw him in the hall.

1098
01:41:58,455 --> 01:42:00,116
Then I saw him come here. A fat rat.

1099
01:42:01,458 --> 01:42:03,119
A fat rat? Here?

1100
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,725
You go out. I want to kill him.

1101
01:42:08,132 --> 01:42:09,793
Give me the stick.
I'll kill it.

1102
01:42:10,467 --> 01:42:12,867
You might feel sorry.
So you go out.

1103
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:17,463
"Sir, you're my shield!"

1104
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:20,476
I've been loyal to you
How can you thrash me?

1105
01:42:21,478 --> 01:42:25,744
Just a minute. Give me this
stick. I will thrash the fat rat.

1106
01:42:26,483 --> 01:42:28,144
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

1107
01:42:30,487 --> 01:42:32,887
I should hear his screams.

1108
01:42:37,895 --> 01:42:39,487
Am I the rat?

1109
01:42:44,234 --> 01:42:47,499
Chandni has only seen one
Rishi. Now she sees another me.

1110
01:42:48,505 --> 01:42:50,496
"As long as she's here,
don't come to my house."

1111
01:42:52,509 --> 01:42:53,942
She means a lot to me.

1112
01:42:55,512 --> 01:42:56,945
Now don't ask me anything else.

1113
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:01,940
- All right.
- What do you understand?

1114
01:43:02,452 --> 01:43:04,044
It's pack-up time for me.

1115
01:43:05,455 --> 01:43:07,218
"Wait, first scream."

1116
01:43:07,457 --> 01:43:08,856
Why?

1117
01:43:09,059 --> 01:43:11,459
So Chandni can hear you
scream right outside.

1118
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:23,868
We want to promote
Internet TV in the villages.

1119
01:43:24,474 --> 01:43:26,465
Are you willing to
work in the villages?

1120
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,801
"No, I'd prefer to be in the city."

1121
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,971
You're from the village yet
you don't want to work there.

1122
01:43:35,485 --> 01:43:38,477
Then how will we take this
new technology to every village?

1123
01:43:39,489 --> 01:43:40,956
How will the country progress?

1124
01:43:54,504 --> 01:43:55,971
Did you see that?

1125
01:43:56,173 --> 01:43:58,107
Girls from the villages
don't want to work there.

1126
01:43:58,442 --> 01:43:59,841
These days everyone...

1127
01:44:24,968 --> 01:44:29,064
I see that in spite of good marks
you didn't complete your studies.

1128
01:44:29,473 --> 01:44:30,804
"May I ask, why?"

1129
01:44:31,475 --> 01:44:33,136
Some family problems.

1130
01:44:33,477 --> 01:44:37,470
You want to work to
support your family?

1131
01:44:38,482 --> 01:44:41,474
"No, I want to stand on my own feet."

1132
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:45,478
Can you tell us
something about logic design?

1133
01:44:48,492 --> 01:44:50,483
Please wait outside.
We'll call you.

1134
01:45:46,149 --> 01:45:47,480
Did you want something?

1135
01:45:47,818 --> 01:45:49,285
"- No, sir.
- Want to say something?"

1136
01:45:49,486 --> 01:45:51,477
I have some work... see you...

1137
01:45:58,428 --> 01:46:01,420
Mr. Mahadevan feels you don't
have the qualifications for this job.

1138
01:46:03,433 --> 01:46:04,832
But my Dad feels that...

1139
01:46:05,435 --> 01:46:07,835
The self-respect you
possess is equally important.

1140
01:46:08,105 --> 01:46:10,437
Hence he wants you to
work for this company.

1141
01:46:32,863 --> 01:46:35,457
"The eccentric, crazy guy..."

1142
01:46:36,466 --> 01:46:38,866
"The eccentric, crazy guy..."

1143
01:46:39,469 --> 01:46:43,200
I am nuts about you

1144
01:46:43,473 --> 01:46:46,465
I am nuts about you

1145
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,471
"The eccentric, crazy guy..."

1146
01:46:53,483 --> 01:46:56,475
I am nuts about you

1147
01:46:58,422 --> 01:47:00,913
I am nuts about you

1148
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:05,090
Your eyes cast a spell on me

1149
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:30,443
"The fool bought
a bottle of whisky"

1150
01:47:31,455 --> 01:47:34,049
"The fool bought
a bottle of whisky"

1151
01:47:35,459 --> 01:47:38,451
With great affection

1152
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:41,454
Oh my crazy beloved

1153
01:47:42,466 --> 01:47:45,458
Oh my crazy beloved

1154
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:49,462
I am nuts about you

1155
01:47:50,474 --> 01:47:52,465
I am nuts about you

1156
01:47:53,477 --> 01:47:55,809
Your eyes cast a spell on me

1157
01:47:59,483 --> 01:48:00,973
I've been waiting for your call.

1158
01:48:02,486 --> 01:48:04,477
Rishi isn't in.
I'm his Daddy.

1159
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:10,483
I'm not old. I too
am young and handsome.

1160
01:48:10,827 --> 01:48:12,294
I too have a car.

1161
01:48:17,501 --> 01:48:19,492
My son learns everything from me.

1162
01:48:25,842 --> 01:48:28,003
It's tough to compete with the son.

1163
01:48:30,514 --> 01:48:33,005
Oh my crazy beloved

1164
01:48:53,537 --> 01:48:55,971
- This is Mohan.
- Who?

1165
01:48:56,907 --> 01:48:59,467
The Mohan you met at India Gate.

1166
01:49:00,477 --> 01:49:02,206
Please don't put down the phone.

1167
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:06,210
It's been a month since
you joined the office.

1168
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:08,742
But you never spoke to me.

1169
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:12,483
It's my birthday today.

1170
01:49:13,490 --> 01:49:16,482
I've distributed sweets
to everyone except you.

1171
01:49:19,896 --> 01:49:22,296
I didn't have the
courage to meet your eyes.

1172
01:49:24,167 --> 01:49:26,499
So I thought of calling you up.

1173
01:49:28,505 --> 01:49:29,836
Are you angry with me?

1174
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,338
- No.
- So you've forgiven me?

1175
01:49:34,511 --> 01:49:38,003
- Yes.
- So look at me and say that.

1176
01:49:41,518 --> 01:49:43,349
I've forgiven you.

1177
01:49:46,523 --> 01:49:48,514
I should thank you.

1178
01:49:49,526 --> 01:49:52,017
That means you haven't
forgotten me as yet.

1179
01:49:52,195 --> 01:49:53,526
How can I forget you?

1180
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,963
This means I can come
to offer you sweets.

1181
01:49:57,467 --> 01:49:59,059
"Yes, you can do that."

1182
01:50:41,511 --> 01:50:43,274
I'm in the bathroom.
I'll be out in a second.

1183
01:50:55,258 --> 01:50:56,850
I was going to the farmhouse
Want to come?

1184
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,951
- No.
- It's you who says...

1185
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:01,461
I don't go out with good girls.

1186
01:51:02,465 --> 01:51:03,955
How will it be possible
if you don't come?

1187
01:51:05,468 --> 01:51:06,958
What if there's a problem?

1188
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:09,461
It's my home.
There won't be a problem.

1189
01:51:10,807 --> 01:51:13,469
All right. I'll change.

1190
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:15,208
Hurry up.

1191
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,277
I have to change.
Please go out.

1192
01:51:20,483 --> 01:51:21,973
Now change.

1193
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:29,321
I said I have to change.
Please go out.

1194
01:51:29,826 --> 01:51:32,090
I can hear. Why are you
yelling? What's the problem?

1195
01:51:33,496 --> 01:51:36,988
- The problem is I'm a girl.
- I know that.

1196
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:39,900
You're a girl.

1197
01:52:08,465 --> 01:52:11,195
You never mentioned
you had a stud farm.

1198
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:14,130
I'll tell you now.
We have a stud farm.

1199
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:15,938
It's called Oberoi Stud Farm.

1200
01:52:16,473 --> 01:52:19,271
We have many horses of
which some are very naughty.

1201
01:52:21,478 --> 01:52:23,275
"Come, I'll introduce you to them."

1202
01:52:31,221 --> 01:52:32,745
The pride of our farm.

1203
01:52:32,889 --> 01:52:34,151
We imported him from UK.

1204
01:52:34,491 --> 01:52:36,482
To date he's won every race.

1205
01:52:39,496 --> 01:52:40,895
Come along.

1206
01:52:41,498 --> 01:52:42,897
What's the cost of that horse?

1207
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,967
One crore.

1208
01:52:45,502 --> 01:52:49,495
A crore? But why must one
spend so much on a horse?

1209
01:52:50,507 --> 01:52:51,838
Because he earns money for us.

1210
01:52:52,509 --> 01:52:55,171
- How? - People send
their mares for breeding.

1211
01:52:55,512 --> 01:52:58,447
- And we charge them.
- How much?

1212
01:52:59,449 --> 01:53:01,440
"50, 60 or 70000."

1213
01:53:06,456 --> 01:53:08,447
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1214
01:53:09,959 --> 01:53:11,449
Then why are you smiling?

1215
01:53:12,462 --> 01:53:13,861
"No, nothing."

1216
01:53:14,464 --> 01:53:16,125
What does that mean? Tell me.

1217
01:53:17,467 --> 01:53:20,129
You might feel offended.

1218
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:22,904
That can never happen.

1219
01:53:25,475 --> 01:53:28,808
Horses make money from breeding and...

1220
01:53:41,491 --> 01:53:44,289
And I spend it on girls.

1221
01:53:58,107 --> 01:53:59,438
Good day sir.

1222
01:54:00,443 --> 01:54:01,842
Hello Kishore.

1223
01:54:02,846 --> 01:54:04,245
"Sir, this is my wife."

1224
01:54:04,447 --> 01:54:07,109
- Hello.
- I couldn't attend your wedding.

1225
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:09,441
I had lots of work.
But did everything go well?

1226
01:54:10,119 --> 01:54:11,450
Yes.

1227
01:54:12,455 --> 01:54:13,854
Get my car.

1228
01:54:14,457 --> 01:54:16,448
- Yes sir.
- Everything fine?

1229
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,919
"- Sir, I'm very happy.
- What's happened?"

1230
01:54:20,129 --> 01:54:21,460
"Sir, I'm going to be a father."

1231
01:54:25,468 --> 01:54:27,299
Why did she blush and run away?

1232
01:54:27,804 --> 01:54:29,465
Shyness increases love.

1233
01:54:30,473 --> 01:54:31,872
Good day.

1234
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,277
Shyness increases love.

1235
01:55:10,446 --> 01:55:11,845
Yes?

1236
01:55:12,115 --> 01:55:13,776
Do you visit temples?

1237
01:55:14,183 --> 01:55:15,775
"Yes, I do. Why?"

1238
01:55:17,453 --> 01:55:22,447
I want to know how does
one ask God for something.

1239
01:55:24,127 --> 01:55:25,253
What could you want?

1240
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:28,123
Are you God?

1241
01:55:28,464 --> 01:55:30,455
No. Just...

1242
01:55:31,467 --> 01:55:32,957
Then?

1243
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:38,463
"If you want something from
God, ask from the heart."

1244
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:40,874
And He will know.

1245
01:55:43,146 --> 01:55:44,477
He will know.

1246
01:56:03,433 --> 01:56:06,425
You know how far
Delhi is from here.

1247
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:11,202
I don't feel like going back.

1248
01:56:11,441 --> 01:56:12,908
Who will drive the car?

1249
01:56:16,446 --> 01:56:20,041
I think we must stay
here for the night.

1250
01:56:22,452 --> 01:56:26,946
But I need an excuse to stay.

1251
01:56:33,463 --> 01:56:34,953
Why... don't you send rain?

1252
01:56:53,483 --> 01:56:56,316
"Sir, why don't you return in
the morning? It's quite late."

1253
01:56:56,486 --> 01:56:58,750
"No, we'll leave now.
Is there a problem?"

1254
01:56:59,422 --> 01:57:02,255
I don't have any problem.
We will leave right now.

1255
01:57:02,759 --> 01:57:04,920
We'll leave now.
Nothing will happen.

1256
01:57:05,928 --> 01:57:08,692
It's late for you too.
Your wife must be waiting.

1257
01:57:08,898 --> 01:57:11,423
"- You carry on.
- Okay, goodbye."

1258
01:57:14,437 --> 01:57:15,836
Let's go.

1259
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:28,940
I don't think God exists.

1260
01:58:09,492 --> 01:58:12,484
"Sir, it's raining cats and
dogs. The road too is jammed."

1261
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:14,821
It would be better
if you left tomorrow.

1262
01:58:15,498 --> 01:58:16,931
We'll stay back.

1263
01:58:35,518 --> 01:58:38,282
"- Come...
- No..."

1264
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:00,968
"Why am I enveloped
with restlessness?"

1265
01:59:01,477 --> 01:59:03,468
There's a fire raging

1266
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:05,970
...that you lit

1267
01:59:06,983 --> 01:59:09,281
"Why am I enveloped
with restlessness?"

1268
01:59:10,153 --> 01:59:13,486
"Why have you lit
this consuming fire?"

1269
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:18,483
I belong to you

1270
01:59:21,497 --> 01:59:24,489
I belong to you

1271
01:59:29,505 --> 01:59:31,496
You've taken away my breath

1272
01:59:32,508 --> 01:59:36,501
You even stole my sleep

1273
01:59:38,181 --> 01:59:40,342
You've taken away my breath

1274
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:44,513
You even stole my sleep

1275
01:59:46,522 --> 01:59:49,514
I belong to you

1276
01:59:52,528 --> 01:59:55,929
I belong to you

1277
02:00:14,817 --> 02:00:19,481
"Never before did my
heart beat like this"

1278
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:25,156
"Never was it tormented
for no special reason"

1279
02:00:32,168 --> 02:00:36,502
I never felt such agony

1280
02:00:37,506 --> 02:00:41,966
"Never did I lose my
peace every moment"

1281
02:00:49,518 --> 02:00:55,252
"It is killing me
What have you done to me"

1282
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:00,122
I belong to you

1283
02:01:03,466 --> 02:01:06,458
I belong to you

1284
02:01:42,505 --> 02:01:47,169
"What's the point in
being frantic quietly?"

1285
02:01:48,511 --> 02:01:53,175
"Sharing the secrets of
the heart has it's fun"

1286
02:01:59,855 --> 02:02:03,951
I swear by my heart beat

1287
02:02:05,461 --> 02:02:09,454
"My beloved, you too love me"

1288
02:02:16,472 --> 02:02:18,463
There's nothing wrong in it

1289
02:02:19,475 --> 02:02:22,467
Why do you hide this?

1290
02:02:25,481 --> 02:02:28,211
I belong to you

1291
02:02:30,886 --> 02:02:34,151
I belong to you

1292
02:02:36,492 --> 02:02:38,483
"Why am I enveloped
with restlessness?"

1293
02:02:39,495 --> 02:02:42,760
"Why have you lit
this consuming fire?"

1294
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,491
You've taken away my breath

1295
02:02:47,169 --> 02:02:51,503
You stole my sleep

1296
02:02:53,509 --> 02:02:56,000
I belong to you

1297
02:02:59,448 --> 02:03:03,441
I belong to you

1298
02:03:04,854 --> 02:03:07,448
I belong to you

1299
02:03:10,459 --> 02:03:13,451
I belong to you

1300
02:03:22,471 --> 02:03:23,961
Now...

1301
02:03:27,476 --> 02:03:30,206
Ajoint venture between
Rishi Tech and Asia Telecom.

1302
02:03:31,981 --> 02:03:34,142
This joint venture is
proving very profitable to us.

1303
02:03:35,484 --> 02:03:37,213
We're planning more business with them

1304
02:03:38,487 --> 02:03:42,287
But... Mohan feels we must
cancel this joint venture.

1305
02:03:42,491 --> 02:03:43,981
And work with others.

1306
02:03:48,164 --> 02:03:51,224
There are many points in this
contract that can be harmful to us.

1307
02:03:52,501 --> 02:03:55,334
You mean Dad signed this
contract without thinking.

1308
02:03:55,905 --> 02:04:00,706
No sir. But our distributors
have complained about our product.

1309
02:04:05,181 --> 02:04:06,443
That is why I feel...

1310
02:04:11,454 --> 02:04:15,254
If we terminate this contract
we'll have to pay heavy compensation.

1311
02:04:16,459 --> 02:04:19,451
I think it would be better
to replace defective pieces.

1312
02:04:20,796 --> 02:04:22,855
What will we do if
they too are defective?

1313
02:04:24,133 --> 02:04:25,794
What do you suggest?

1314
02:04:26,469 --> 02:04:28,903
Mr. Mohan is absolutely right.

1315
02:04:29,472 --> 02:04:32,464
Asia Telecom has no answer
for these complaints.

1316
02:04:32,975 --> 02:04:34,966
The problem is in their technology.

1317
02:04:35,478 --> 02:04:38,879
Their profit is more important
to them than our clients.

1318
02:04:39,482 --> 02:04:41,814
This can affect all our businesses.

1319
02:04:46,489 --> 02:04:48,480
That is why I feel
Mr. Mohan is right.

1320
02:04:55,498 --> 02:04:57,090
Mr. Mohan is right.

1321
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:00,432
Shall we eat lunch?

1322
02:05:12,848 --> 02:05:15,214
Do you actually feel
Mr. Mohan is right?

1323
02:05:16,118 --> 02:05:17,449
Yes sir.

1324
02:05:19,855 --> 02:05:21,447
Sometimes we feel something is wrong.

1325
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:25,450
After sometime it feels right.

1326
02:05:28,464 --> 02:05:29,954
Mr. Mohan is right.

1327
02:05:30,466 --> 02:05:31,956
It's time for lunch.

1328
02:05:35,471 --> 02:05:37,462
Your words have filled my stomach.

1329
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:39,471
You may go.

1330
02:05:48,217 --> 02:05:49,741
It's time to break away.

1331
02:05:53,489 --> 02:05:55,980
What's going on between
the boss and Chandni?

1332
02:05:56,492 --> 02:05:58,187
Forget it. None of our business.

1333
02:05:58,427 --> 02:05:59,917
It doesn't concern us.

1334
02:06:00,429 --> 02:06:02,829
Boss asked Chandni to stay
back after the meeting.

1335
02:06:03,432 --> 02:06:05,423
I want to know if it's
temporary or permanent.

1336
02:06:07,436 --> 02:06:09,097
Stop this nonsense.

1337
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:13,272
Don't lose your shirt.
I know the boss is your pal.

1338
02:06:13,709 --> 02:06:15,040
But the truth is the truth.

1339
02:06:15,177 --> 02:06:16,439
What is the truth?

1340
02:06:16,946 --> 02:06:18,937
They come and leave together.

1341
02:06:19,448 --> 02:06:22,281
They live together. Do we
consider them brother and sister?

1342
02:06:22,451 --> 02:06:24,043
- Mind your tongue or...
- Or what?

1343
02:06:24,453 --> 02:06:26,045
I don't generally get angry.

1344
02:06:26,188 --> 02:06:28,179
"But if I get angry,
I won't spare you!"

1345
02:06:28,457 --> 02:06:30,118
- Go on...
- I'll show you!

1346
02:06:30,459 --> 02:06:33,792
- Talking rubbish!
- You don't know me...

1347
02:06:42,471 --> 02:06:44,029
What is going on?

1348
02:06:44,473 --> 02:06:46,134
This is an office not a market.

1349
02:06:46,475 --> 02:06:49,069
This man was saying something
wrong about you and Chandni.

1350
02:06:49,211 --> 02:06:51,202
If somebody says anything
does it become true?

1351
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,948
How can I tolerate anyone
saying anything about Chandni?

1352
02:06:54,483 --> 02:06:55,950
Now how do I convince you...

1353
02:06:56,485 --> 02:06:58,419
Why should it matter to
you if they abuse me?

1354
02:06:59,421 --> 02:07:01,252
You do not have to think about me.

1355
02:07:02,424 --> 02:07:04,221
Are you saying this to me?

1356
02:07:04,927 --> 02:07:06,417
"Yes, I'm telling you."

1357
02:07:07,429 --> 02:07:09,192
I have the right to think about you.

1358
02:07:10,432 --> 02:07:11,831
What right?

1359
02:07:12,434 --> 02:07:15,426
I was the first man in your life.

1360
02:07:19,842 --> 02:07:21,434
It's true that you were
the first man in my life.

1361
02:07:22,177 --> 02:07:25,840
But like the cloud that was
blown away by difficulties.

1362
02:07:27,116 --> 02:07:28,447
You have no right over me.

1363
02:07:28,851 --> 02:07:30,443
I have no right?

1364
02:07:32,454 --> 02:07:34,285
Didn't you say you
can never forget me?

1365
02:07:35,958 --> 02:07:39,724
"Sir, you ask her, didn't she
say, s he's forgiven me?"

1366
02:07:40,462 --> 02:07:42,259
She looked into my eyes and said it!

1367
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,459
"Didn't you wish me, happy birthday?"

1368
02:07:47,136 --> 02:07:48,467
Didn't you thank me?

1369
02:07:49,138 --> 02:07:50,469
What was that?

1370
02:07:52,474 --> 02:07:54,908
When I told you I
hadn't forgotten you...

1371
02:07:55,477 --> 02:07:59,470
"what I meant was, how can I
forget the way you treated me"

1372
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:03,311
When I said I'd forgiven you...

1373
02:08:04,153 --> 02:08:06,087
I forgave your mistake.

1374
02:08:06,889 --> 02:08:09,483
"When I looked into your
eyes, I wanted to see..."

1375
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:11,490
How much of a coward you still are.

1376
02:08:13,162 --> 02:08:14,493
And I thanked you...

1377
02:08:14,997 --> 02:08:18,296
"Because of you, I got the
opportunity to know Rishi."

1378
02:08:19,501 --> 02:08:21,901
"You all talk about Rishi,"

1379
02:08:22,504 --> 02:08:25,496
Actually all of you
want to live like Rishi.

1380
02:08:26,508 --> 02:08:28,100
But you can't be Rishi.

1381
02:08:29,511 --> 02:08:31,911
All of you feel there's some
thing wrong between Rishi and me.

1382
02:08:32,848 --> 02:08:34,179
But the truth is...

1383
02:08:34,516 --> 02:08:36,507
Rishi considers me a good friend.

1384
02:08:36,919 --> 02:08:38,511
He considers my honour his honour.

1385
02:08:39,521 --> 02:08:42,854
I live in his house
as if in a temple.

1386
02:08:43,926 --> 02:08:47,521
I am proud to be a woman
after meeting Rishi.

1387
02:08:49,531 --> 02:08:50,930
He is MD for all of you.

1388
02:08:52,534 --> 02:08:54,195
He is MD for me too.

1389
02:08:54,536 --> 02:08:55,935
But...

1390
02:10:24,827 --> 02:10:26,260
Come tomorrow morning.

1391
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,899
Yes?

1392
02:10:33,502 --> 02:10:35,163
My room hasn't been cleaned well.

1393
02:10:35,504 --> 02:10:37,165
- Take a look.
- Yes.

1394
02:11:01,196 --> 02:11:02,458
Can't I even touch?

1395
02:11:02,865 --> 02:11:04,457
It's not ready.

1396
02:11:11,139 --> 02:11:12,470
When will it be ready?

1397
02:11:14,142 --> 02:11:15,473
I'll tell you.

1398
02:11:16,478 --> 02:11:17,945
I am ready.

1399
02:11:19,815 --> 02:11:21,476
To eat. I'm hungry.

1400
02:11:22,484 --> 02:11:23,974
Wait for awhile.

1401
02:11:29,491 --> 02:11:30,981
I will wait.

1402
02:11:32,494 --> 02:11:33,893
What happened?

1403
02:11:58,453 --> 02:12:01,945
This clock is so slow.

1404
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:05,449
It's only 12.30.

1405
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:07,451
The clock is right.

1406
02:12:08,463 --> 02:12:10,294
It is only 12.30.

1407
02:12:13,869 --> 02:12:15,461
I want it to be 6.

1408
02:12:16,471 --> 02:12:18,132
Only then will the sun rise.

1409
02:12:18,473 --> 02:12:20,464
Only then will it be day.

1410
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:24,472
These days I love the day.

1411
02:12:44,499 --> 02:12:47,161
All these years
I thought I drank wine.

1412
02:12:48,503 --> 02:12:52,997
But now I feel that
liquor is consuming me.

1413
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:57,102
I was waiting for this moment.

1414
02:12:58,447 --> 02:13:00,108
Today after years...

1415
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:03,042
I've found my son again.

1416
02:13:13,195 --> 02:13:15,220
I've never felt so anxious.

1417
02:13:16,465 --> 02:13:18,194
I don't know what it's called.

1418
02:13:19,468 --> 02:13:22,460
I just want you and your company.

1419
02:13:23,472 --> 02:13:24,803
Forever and ever.

1420
02:13:35,484 --> 02:13:36,883
So now...

1421
02:13:42,891 --> 02:13:44,483
Such anxiousness...

1422
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,899
This anxiousness...

1423
02:13:54,236 --> 02:13:55,965
Are you... all right?

1424
02:13:57,439 --> 02:13:59,430
Yes... yes.

1425
02:13:59,941 --> 02:14:04,173
I... never... felt like this.

1426
02:14:11,453 --> 02:14:14,047
What... what is it called?

1427
02:14:14,456 --> 02:14:15,946
I have no clue.

1428
02:14:20,462 --> 02:14:21,929
I just...

1429
02:14:23,465 --> 02:14:25,456
I just want you.

1430
02:14:27,002 --> 02:14:28,469
And to be with you.

1431
02:14:30,472 --> 02:14:32,235
Forever and ever.

1432
02:14:33,475 --> 02:14:35,272
What are you saying?

1433
02:14:37,479 --> 02:14:39,470
What I said...

1434
02:14:43,485 --> 02:14:45,476
I've said what I had to.

1435
02:14:47,823 --> 02:14:49,222
"Sorry, I didn't hear."

1436
02:14:56,498 --> 02:14:58,022
Yes... I was saying...

1437
02:15:00,435 --> 02:15:04,098
Such... such...

1438
02:15:06,441 --> 02:15:08,432
I... I...

1439
02:15:14,116 --> 02:15:15,447
You may leave.

1440
02:15:17,452 --> 02:15:19,443
- I...
- But you called me.

1441
02:15:20,122 --> 02:15:21,453
You wanted to say something.

1442
02:15:22,457 --> 02:15:24,448
I forgot. I'll talk to you later.

1443
02:15:43,478 --> 02:15:44,968
"Yes, son?"

1444
02:15:45,881 --> 02:15:48,281
You know I know so many girls.

1445
02:15:50,485 --> 02:15:52,476
I could speak my mind to them.

1446
02:15:53,889 --> 02:15:57,086
And right now I wanted
to say something to Chandni...

1447
02:15:59,094 --> 02:16:00,425
But I just couldn't!

1448
02:16:04,833 --> 02:16:06,164
Hear this.

1449
02:16:09,437 --> 02:16:10,768
Did you hear?

1450
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,171
It's beating so hard.

1451
02:16:15,177 --> 02:16:16,439
What is happening to me?

1452
02:16:16,945 --> 02:16:20,176
"What you called nonsense, stupidity..."

1453
02:16:20,448 --> 02:16:22,279
That's what has happened. Love.

1454
02:16:22,450 --> 02:16:23,849
What?

1455
02:16:30,458 --> 02:16:31,857
Love... and me?

1456
02:17:01,423 --> 02:17:05,154
"For the first time
my heart feels restless"

1457
02:17:06,428 --> 02:17:10,865
"For the first time
my heart feels restless"

1458
02:17:12,434 --> 02:17:15,835
It feels as if I am in love

1459
02:17:16,771 --> 02:17:19,103
As if I'm in love

1460
02:17:20,442 --> 02:17:24,776
Anticipation is killing

1461
02:17:26,448 --> 02:17:30,441
Anticipation is killing

1462
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:35,954
It feels as if I am in love

1463
02:17:37,459 --> 02:17:39,450
As if I'm in love

1464
02:17:42,464 --> 02:17:47,197
My heart is under your command

1465
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:52,465
It feels as if I am in love

1466
02:17:53,475 --> 02:17:55,466
As if I'm in love

1467
02:18:08,156 --> 02:18:12,752
I can't fall asleep all night

1468
02:18:13,995 --> 02:18:18,159
Your memories torment me all night

1469
02:18:25,507 --> 02:18:29,170
How can I reveal what I go through?

1470
02:18:30,512 --> 02:18:34,949
"I go away only
to come back to you"

1471
02:18:36,518 --> 02:18:40,284
"I go away only
to come back to you"

1472
02:18:44,526 --> 02:18:48,519
"My love, what is
happening to my heart?"

1473
02:18:49,864 --> 02:18:54,267
"My love, what is
happening to my heart?"

1474
02:18:55,937 --> 02:18:59,464
It feels as if I am in love

1475
02:19:00,475 --> 02:19:02,466
As if I'm in love

1476
02:19:26,501 --> 02:19:31,268
Her eyes stole my heart

1477
02:19:32,507 --> 02:19:36,500
Your simplicity won me over

1478
02:19:43,518 --> 02:19:47,852
Pain too feels dear

1479
02:19:49,124 --> 02:19:53,026
"Now I know what it
means to fall in love"

1480
02:19:54,529 --> 02:19:57,965
"Now I know what it
means to fall in love"

1481
02:20:02,871 --> 02:20:06,807
I believe in heartbeat now

1482
02:20:08,476 --> 02:20:12,469
I believe in heartbeat now

1483
02:20:14,149 --> 02:20:17,482
It feels as if I am in love

1484
02:20:18,486 --> 02:20:20,477
As if I'm in love

1485
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:26,483
"Never before was
my heart so restless"

1486
02:20:27,896 --> 02:20:32,230
Anticipation is killing

1487
02:20:33,501 --> 02:20:37,494
It feels as if I am in love

1488
02:20:38,506 --> 02:20:40,303
As if I'm in love

1489
02:20:42,243 --> 02:20:45,508
It feels as if I am in love

1490
02:20:46,514 --> 02:20:48,505
As if I'm in love

1491
02:21:13,875 --> 02:21:15,206
How are you?

1492
02:21:15,477 --> 02:21:17,468
I am fine.

1493
02:21:18,146 --> 02:21:19,477
You will have to help your son.

1494
02:21:20,482 --> 02:21:21,972
And you can't refuse him.

1495
02:21:24,219 --> 02:21:25,481
What's been happening
for the past few days...

1496
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:30,890
- That...
- Heart beating fast...

1497
02:21:31,493 --> 02:21:33,222
Not being able to sleep?

1498
02:21:34,496 --> 02:21:37,829
"If this is love, I am in love."

1499
02:21:40,502 --> 02:21:41,992
I love Chandni.

1500
02:21:45,507 --> 02:21:46,906
What can I do?

1501
02:21:47,509 --> 02:21:49,272
You have to go and tell her...

1502
02:21:51,513 --> 02:21:52,912
"No, no..."

1503
02:21:53,515 --> 02:21:54,914
I can't do this.

1504
02:21:55,517 --> 02:21:58,452
I tried so hard but
I couldn't tell her.

1505
02:21:58,853 --> 02:22:00,445
Couldn't you find anyone else?

1506
02:22:01,122 --> 02:22:04,114
I don't have anyone else.
You are the only friend I have.

1507
02:22:08,463 --> 02:22:09,896
But...

1508
02:22:10,465 --> 02:22:11,955
I can't do this.

1509
02:22:15,870 --> 02:22:17,462
What a tight corner you've got me in!

1510
02:22:19,474 --> 02:22:20,907
Good God!

1511
02:22:21,809 --> 02:22:23,470
Oh my God! Come on.

1512
02:22:30,485 --> 02:22:31,884
I...

1513
02:22:32,487 --> 02:22:34,478
What are you doing there?
Come here.

1514
02:22:38,493 --> 02:22:40,484
- He...
- Yes...

1515
02:22:41,496 --> 02:22:45,489
I'm not able to say
what I want to.

1516
02:22:48,503 --> 02:22:51,961
Dad will tell you
what I'm unable to.

1517
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:04,179
I want to say something
very important to you.

1518
02:23:05,119 --> 02:23:06,450
Yes.

1519
02:23:06,788 --> 02:23:08,449
- Sit down.
- You too.

1520
02:23:16,464 --> 02:23:20,958
The fact is that
Rishi wants to get married.

1521
02:23:21,135 --> 02:23:24,468
- That's very nice.
- Not for me because...

1522
02:23:25,473 --> 02:23:29,466
The girl knows Rishi's past...

1523
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:32,469
Everything he was earlier.

1524
02:23:32,814 --> 02:23:34,475
Just like you do.

1525
02:23:35,483 --> 02:23:36,973
Yet she wants to marry him.

1526
02:23:37,485 --> 02:23:39,476
Everybody has a past.

1527
02:23:40,154 --> 02:23:43,487
We must forget the past
and think of the future.

1528
02:23:45,493 --> 02:23:47,222
What does a girl need for marriage?

1529
02:23:47,495 --> 02:23:49,486
A husband's love and security.

1530
02:23:50,498 --> 02:23:53,899
Yes but this is such
an important decision.

1531
02:23:54,502 --> 02:23:57,835
I don't understand anything.

1532
02:23:58,439 --> 02:24:00,031
Should I talk to the girl?

1533
02:24:00,441 --> 02:24:04,172
"Tell me, if you were
in the girl's place..."

1534
02:24:04,779 --> 02:24:06,770
Would you marry him?

1535
02:24:07,115 --> 02:24:08,776
Yes I would.

1536
02:24:09,450 --> 02:24:13,181
This means according to you
there's nothing wrong with Rishi.

1537
02:24:13,855 --> 02:24:16,790
- No.
- The truth is...

1538
02:24:17,458 --> 02:24:20,859
You are the girl
Rishi wants to marry.

1539
02:24:24,465 --> 02:24:25,864
Now what is your answer?

1540
02:24:27,468 --> 02:24:30,130
My answer remains the same.

1541
02:24:31,472 --> 02:24:33,463
I knew this would be your answer.

1542
02:24:36,811 --> 02:24:40,474
"Considering the situation you are
in, this is what any girl would say."

1543
02:24:41,482 --> 02:24:45,009
Your father is no more.
You've left your mother's home.

1544
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:48,814
"If you get married to Rishi,
you'd be in seventh heaven."

1545
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:51,981
"Home, cars, bank balance
you get everything."

1546
02:24:53,227 --> 02:24:55,286
"What4ever the boy is,
whatever he does..."

1547
02:24:55,496 --> 02:24:57,225
That doesn't matter to you.

1548
02:24:57,432 --> 02:24:59,764
You are concerned with security.

1549
02:25:01,436 --> 02:25:03,427
What else does a girl
like you require?

1550
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:05,429
You misunderstand me.

1551
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:08,773
By security I meant
the husband's love for life.

1552
02:25:10,178 --> 02:25:13,443
I'm staying here only because
of your love. Not for money.

1553
02:25:13,948 --> 02:25:16,439
Rishi will feel hurt if I leave.

1554
02:25:17,452 --> 02:25:20,444
If money as what I wanted
I'd have agreed that very day...

1555
02:25:21,122 --> 02:25:23,215
Rishi offered me the price I'd ask.

1556
02:25:24,459 --> 02:25:26,051
You might not like this.

1557
02:25:26,461 --> 02:25:30,056
A girl can earn money
easily if she wants.

1558
02:25:31,132 --> 02:25:33,794
And you're not the only
rich man in this city.

1559
02:25:34,469 --> 02:25:36,266
You are feeling offended.

1560
02:25:37,472 --> 02:25:40,270
I only said what a
father should say.

1561
02:25:41,476 --> 02:25:44,138
And I said what any self
respecting girl should say.

1562
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:46,879
So what have you decided?

1563
02:25:47,815 --> 02:25:49,476
Life is a train journey.

1564
02:25:50,485 --> 02:25:51,975
The home is a compartment.

1565
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:57,424
Everyone is traveling with me.

1566
02:25:58,426 --> 02:25:59,757
I've reached my station.

1567
02:26:00,762 --> 02:26:02,889
I don't have to say
goodbye to everyone.

1568
02:26:04,098 --> 02:26:05,429
I am leaving.

1569
02:26:07,168 --> 02:26:08,760
Don't take a hasty decision.

1570
02:26:10,438 --> 02:26:13,896
I think if you marry Rishi...

1571
02:26:16,444 --> 02:26:19,208
What did you say?
Your life becomes secured.

1572
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:25,442
"If you've taken the
decision, what can I do?"

1573
02:26:26,454 --> 02:26:28,445
I'd like to say
something before you leave.

1574
02:26:30,124 --> 02:26:32,922
The next time you ride a train...

1575
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:36,453
Get your ticket confirmed before hand.

1576
02:26:50,211 --> 02:26:51,473
What did she say?

1577
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:54,745
Do I have to tell you that too?

1578
02:26:54,882 --> 02:26:56,213
Go and ask her.

1579
02:26:56,484 --> 02:26:58,918
"- Did you tell her everything?
- Yes, I did."

1580
02:27:09,430 --> 02:27:12,263
Many a time I tried to tell you...

1581
02:27:13,434 --> 02:27:14,765
But I couldn't.

1582
02:27:15,837 --> 02:27:18,772
Dad didn't tell me your
answer. Are you happy?

1583
02:27:24,111 --> 02:27:25,442
What's wrong?

1584
02:27:27,448 --> 02:27:28,938
Why do you look so angry?

1585
02:27:30,885 --> 02:27:32,284
Where are you going?

1586
02:27:36,457 --> 02:27:38,891
Why don't you talk to me?

1587
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:40,927
Say something.

1588
02:27:42,463 --> 02:27:43,862
Answer me.

1589
02:27:52,473 --> 02:27:55,874
- What happened?
- Don't know what's wrong with her.

1590
02:27:56,477 --> 02:27:58,069
She... She's not talking to me.

1591
02:27:58,479 --> 02:27:59,878
I don't know where she's going.

1592
02:28:03,150 --> 02:28:05,482
- Don't let her go. - OK.
- I'll talk to Dad.

1593
02:28:06,487 --> 02:28:07,977
Keep her here.

1594
02:28:10,491 --> 02:28:12,152
Don't let her leave!

1595
02:28:16,497 --> 02:28:17,987
What did you tell Chandni?

1596
02:28:18,499 --> 02:28:20,990
I said you love her
and want to marry her.

1597
02:28:21,502 --> 02:28:23,231
Then why isn't she talking to me?

1598
02:28:23,504 --> 02:28:25,096
Why is she leaving home?

1599
02:28:27,508 --> 02:28:29,772
"- What is wrong, dear?
- What happened?"

1600
02:28:31,512 --> 02:28:34,913
"If Dad's words have hurt
you, please forget it."

1601
02:28:35,516 --> 02:28:37,507
It was my fault.
One-sided love.

1602
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,852
I don't mind if you don't love me.

1603
02:28:42,189 --> 02:28:43,520
We can live as friends.

1604
02:28:44,525 --> 02:28:46,186
Why won't you talk to me?

1605
02:28:46,861 --> 02:28:48,192
What is wrong?

1606
02:28:53,868 --> 02:28:55,301
Don't let her go anywhere.

1607
02:28:59,473 --> 02:29:01,964
Will you tell me what
transpired between both of you?

1608
02:29:02,810 --> 02:29:05,074
I told herjust what
you asked me to tell her.

1609
02:29:06,213 --> 02:29:09,478
I also said that she was
marrying my son for money.

1610
02:29:11,485 --> 02:29:13,476
What did I tell you
and what have you said!

1611
02:29:14,488 --> 02:29:15,978
Why?

1612
02:29:16,891 --> 02:29:18,324
What you did is terribly wrong!

1613
02:29:20,494 --> 02:29:22,485
What is wrong that suddenly you...

1614
02:29:23,497 --> 02:29:24,987
Please don't go...

1615
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:28,297
Dad said something
very wrong to you.

1616
02:29:30,838 --> 02:29:32,499
I'll tell him to apologise to you.

1617
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:35,834
- Don't let her leave.
- Please don't go.

1618
02:29:37,511 --> 02:29:38,978
Come and apologise to her.

1619
02:29:39,513 --> 02:29:41,504
- Why should I apologise?
- Because it's your mistake!

1620
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:45,179
What is wrong with you?
You talk sense when you're drunk.

1621
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,785
Today you are sober
but talking nonsense.

1622
02:29:48,022 --> 02:29:49,922
Will you apologise or not?

1623
02:29:50,091 --> 02:29:51,956
- Definitely not.
- Then get out of this house!

1624
02:29:52,526 --> 02:29:55,256
What are you saying?
This is my house.

1625
02:29:55,529 --> 02:29:57,463
I worked hard to build it.

1626
02:29:58,466 --> 02:30:00,866
Have you ever earned money?

1627
02:30:01,469 --> 02:30:03,460
"If anyone has to leave, it is you."

1628
02:30:04,472 --> 02:30:06,736
All right. I don't want your house!

1629
02:30:07,008 --> 02:30:09,875
Or your money!
I am leaving!

1630
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:11,877
"Stop, my son."

1631
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,970
Don't be hasty.

1632
02:30:15,149 --> 02:30:16,480
You are used to comforts.

1633
02:30:17,485 --> 02:30:19,146
You can't walk without a car.

1634
02:30:19,487 --> 02:30:20,977
You can't live without whisky.

1635
02:30:21,489 --> 02:30:23,480
You can't sleep without
the air conditioner.

1636
02:30:24,158 --> 02:30:25,489
Think it over.

1637
02:30:28,496 --> 02:30:29,895
Hear him talk...

1638
02:30:30,498 --> 02:30:33,490
Haven't I slept without the
AC when there was no current?

1639
02:30:35,503 --> 02:30:38,301
"When I'd be drunk,
I wouldn't eat food."

1640
02:30:40,508 --> 02:30:42,169
Can't I live without liquor?

1641
02:30:44,512 --> 02:30:45,979
Where is Chandni?

1642
02:30:48,516 --> 02:30:50,507
- She left.
- How did she leave?

1643
02:30:51,018 --> 02:30:52,508
I asked you not to let her go!

1644
02:30:54,522 --> 02:30:55,921
I am leaving!

1645
02:30:56,524 --> 02:30:58,458
You are welcome to your money!

1646
02:30:59,126 --> 02:31:02,220
And your house! Now
they will call you Dad!

1647
02:31:13,069 --> 02:31:14,468
Get some ice.

1648
02:31:22,078 --> 02:31:25,070
"Sir, what you did wasn't right."

1649
02:31:26,582 --> 02:31:27,810
In fact it was terrible.

1650
02:31:29,085 --> 02:31:31,076
You're not a good father.

1651
02:31:32,822 --> 02:31:34,084
We won't work here.

1652
02:31:36,025 --> 02:31:37,754
Is this what you want to say?

1653
02:31:39,028 --> 02:31:40,427
Isn't it Charlie?

1654
02:31:43,699 --> 02:31:45,030
"Prem, is this what you want to say?"

1655
02:31:46,035 --> 02:31:48,026
"No, sir you did very right."

1656
02:31:49,438 --> 02:31:52,430
Now we know how a
great man like yourself...

1657
02:31:53,442 --> 02:31:58,038
"How he can save his honour,
his name, his wealth."

1658
02:32:00,049 --> 02:32:01,846
You are a good father.

1659
02:32:03,452 --> 02:32:07,855
Our heads are held high with
pride knowing we work for you.

1660
02:32:10,059 --> 02:32:15,395
We pray that we get the opportunity
to work for you in our next birth.

1661
02:32:16,065 --> 02:32:17,555
Why did you stop?

1662
02:32:18,067 --> 02:32:21,730
Carry on. Say
that you are God.

1663
02:32:22,071 --> 02:32:24,062
You are great.
One should respect you.

1664
02:32:25,074 --> 02:32:26,564
We should worship you.

1665
02:32:28,077 --> 02:32:29,567
Tell me...

1666
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:34,413
"If you were in my place,
would you go tell a girl..."

1667
02:32:34,683 --> 02:32:36,014
...that your son loves her?

1668
02:32:41,023 --> 02:32:42,513
You know Rishi right from childhood.

1669
02:32:42,691 --> 02:32:43,817
You also know all his habits.

1670
02:32:44,693 --> 02:32:47,685
If you were Chandni's father...

1671
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:50,021
Would you marry her
to a boy like Rishi?

1672
02:32:52,034 --> 02:32:57,438
If your son brought home a girl
dressed as a bride at midnight...

1673
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,803
Would you keep her home?

1674
02:33:00,042 --> 02:33:03,375
- No sir.
- You wouldn't do it but I did.

1675
02:33:04,046 --> 02:33:08,039
I did this so that in future...

1676
02:33:09,051 --> 02:33:10,541
Rishi won't ever imagine...

1677
02:33:11,053 --> 02:33:13,487
Chandni married him for his money.

1678
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:16,553
And Chandni should never feel...

1679
02:33:17,059 --> 02:33:19,550
Rishi married her because
he felt sorry for her.

1680
02:33:21,463 --> 02:33:24,864
The moment I asked Chandni...

1681
02:33:26,068 --> 02:33:29,060
Is she marrying Rishi
for his wealth?

1682
02:33:30,072 --> 02:33:31,562
She left home.

1683
02:33:32,408 --> 02:33:34,069
When Rishi found this...

1684
02:33:34,343 --> 02:33:35,674
Rishi too left home.

1685
02:33:38,013 --> 02:33:42,416
When Chandni finds out
Rishi left his Dad's home...

1686
02:33:43,018 --> 02:33:45,009
Left the comforts and
luxuries for her...

1687
02:33:46,021 --> 02:33:48,512
Both will believe in their love.

1688
02:33:49,024 --> 02:33:51,515
That's what I wanted!

1689
02:33:51,694 --> 02:33:54,026
But you thought parents
are the enemies of love.

1690
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:59,023
No. When parents are against love...

1691
02:34:00,035 --> 02:34:04,802
They are not enemies of love.
They make it stronger.

1692
02:34:29,064 --> 02:34:30,497
I looked for you everywhere!

1693
02:34:35,004 --> 02:34:36,733
I'm exhausted.

1694
02:34:44,013 --> 02:34:45,742
Dad has gone mad.

1695
02:34:48,350 --> 02:34:49,749
I'm very tired.

1696
02:34:51,020 --> 02:34:52,487
Because I smoke.

1697
02:34:53,022 --> 02:34:54,546
I smoke a lot.

1698
02:34:58,027 --> 02:35:00,018
Does anyone have water?

1699
02:35:00,529 --> 02:35:02,019
No.

1700
02:35:06,035 --> 02:35:07,434
Now...

1701
02:35:09,038 --> 02:35:10,528
I want nothing from him.

1702
02:35:14,043 --> 02:35:15,704
I've left home.

1703
02:35:18,047 --> 02:35:19,446
I've left home.

1704
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:22,813
I am educated.

1705
02:35:23,385 --> 02:35:24,818
I can earn my own living.

1706
02:35:30,793 --> 02:35:32,055
Stay with me.

1707
02:35:34,063 --> 02:35:36,827
- We will stay somewhere else.
- Who are you?

1708
02:35:40,002 --> 02:35:41,401
Your...

1709
02:35:44,006 --> 02:35:46,770
I can understand your anger.

1710
02:35:49,011 --> 02:35:51,002
All that he said was very wrong.

1711
02:35:54,016 --> 02:35:55,415
Dad has gone mad!

1712
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,853
Please forgive him for me.

1713
02:36:03,025 --> 02:36:05,016
Forget what he said.

1714
02:36:06,028 --> 02:36:08,019
He doesn't' know you like I do.

1715
02:36:09,431 --> 02:36:13,424
I only asked him to
tell you that I love you.

1716
02:36:15,037 --> 02:36:16,368
Yes. I want to marry you.

1717
02:36:17,039 --> 02:36:18,438
But...

1718
02:36:20,042 --> 02:36:23,307
But it's okay if
you don't love me.

1719
02:36:23,712 --> 02:36:25,043
We can be friends.

1720
02:36:26,048 --> 02:36:27,515
Why are you troubling the girl?

1721
02:36:28,050 --> 02:36:29,381
Who are you?

1722
02:36:30,386 --> 02:36:31,717
Isn't he troubling you?

1723
02:36:32,054 --> 02:36:33,453
- Did I tell you anything?
- No.

1724
02:36:33,655 --> 02:36:34,986
Did I complain?

1725
02:36:35,391 --> 02:36:36,722
Then?

1726
02:36:37,326 --> 02:36:40,489
Go away. What are you
looking at? Go.

1727
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,992
He wouldn't know our relation.

1728
02:36:52,007 --> 02:36:53,736
Where are you going?

1729
02:36:54,676 --> 02:36:56,007
Stop!

1730
02:36:59,014 --> 02:37:00,413
Don't leave me and go.

1731
02:37:02,684 --> 02:37:04,015
Why don't you talk to me?

1732
02:37:05,754 --> 02:37:07,016
Please get off the bus.

1733
02:37:08,023 --> 02:37:09,513
Stop the bus!

1734
02:37:11,026 --> 02:37:12,755
What's my fault?

1735
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:16,520
Where will I look for you?

1736
02:37:43,392 --> 02:37:47,658
"It happened late
but I did fall in love"

1737
02:37:49,998 --> 02:37:53,991
"It happened late
but I did fall in love"

1738
02:37:56,004 --> 02:38:00,998
"My beloved, you
took my heart with you"

1739
02:38:31,039 --> 02:38:36,978
You taught me the meaning of love

1740
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:42,474
You taught my heart to beat

1741
02:38:50,726 --> 02:38:55,993
My heart was carefree

1742
02:38:56,999 --> 02:39:01,663
You taught it to be tormented

1743
02:39:03,739 --> 02:39:08,005
Waiting is so difficult

1744
02:39:10,012 --> 02:39:14,676
"My beloved, you
took my heart with you"

1745
02:39:27,029 --> 02:39:29,463
"Papad, crisp papads."

1746
02:39:31,033 --> 02:39:32,694
Would you like some?

1747
02:39:33,035 --> 02:39:34,696
"Sir, buy some..."

1748
02:41:00,055 --> 02:41:02,387
Will you please sit here?

1749
02:41:03,058 --> 02:41:04,389
- I want to sit there.
- Sure.

1750
02:41:55,043 --> 02:41:57,034
I want to say something to you.

1751
02:41:59,047 --> 02:42:00,446
"Chandni, listen to me."

1752
02:42:05,053 --> 02:42:06,850
Who are you?

1753
02:42:07,556 --> 02:42:09,046
"Sister, she knows me."

1754
02:42:13,795 --> 02:42:15,057
She won't tell.

1755
02:42:16,465 --> 02:42:17,898
My name is Rishi.

1756
02:42:20,068 --> 02:42:22,730
I lived my life very
badly all these years.

1757
02:42:25,073 --> 02:42:28,065
"Wrong meaning, the wrong
way of looking at girls."

1758
02:42:29,077 --> 02:42:30,840
The way I lived
with girls was wrong.

1759
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:36,017
I thought I could throw money
and get any girl on my bed.

1760
02:42:37,018 --> 02:42:38,747
But not every girl is the same.

1761
02:42:41,022 --> 02:42:42,751
Chandni made me realise this.

1762
02:42:45,026 --> 02:42:47,824
I always thought love
was useless trash.

1763
02:42:49,030 --> 02:42:52,022
But this very love can
turn a bad man to good.

1764
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:59,036
"Today if I address you as
sister, she's responsible for it."

1765
02:43:01,042 --> 02:43:03,374
"Sister, you asked me who I am."

1766
02:43:05,046 --> 02:43:07,378
Chandni told me who I was.

1767
02:43:08,049 --> 02:43:10,040
I was just searching
for you to thank you.

1768
02:43:11,553 --> 02:43:13,646
I made only one mistake.

1769
02:43:15,056 --> 02:43:16,455
I fell in love.

1770
02:43:18,059 --> 02:43:19,651
But I'm not worthy of her.

1771
02:43:23,465 --> 02:43:25,057
Forgive me.

1772
02:43:41,016 --> 02:43:43,007
Now I understand.

1773
02:43:44,686 --> 02:43:46,347
My ego prohibited me
from speaking with you.

1774
02:43:49,024 --> 02:43:51,015
What a woman can do...

1775
02:43:52,027 --> 02:43:54,018
You made me realise it.

1776
02:43:56,031 --> 02:44:00,024
You're not the only one
who loves. I too love you.

1777
02:44:02,037 --> 02:44:03,527
Right from the beginning.

1778
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:09,443
When Mohan said he was the
first man to be in my life...

1779
02:44:10,712 --> 02:44:12,703
I had turned to look at you.

1780
02:44:14,049 --> 02:44:15,539
It wasn't me...

1781
02:44:18,053 --> 02:44:19,543
My love looked at you.

1782
02:44:21,790 --> 02:44:23,052
"In the kitchen, when you said..."

1783
02:44:26,061 --> 02:44:28,052
"In the kitchen, when you
said you were ready..."

1784
02:44:29,798 --> 02:44:32,062
I knew you loved me.

1785
02:44:33,568 --> 02:44:38,005
But... I first wanted you
to confess your love to me.

1786
02:44:39,741 --> 02:44:41,003
That was my mistake.

1787
02:44:42,010 --> 02:44:43,602
My ego killed me!

1788
02:44:46,014 --> 02:44:49,745
When your father said
that you loved me...

1789
02:44:51,019 --> 02:44:52,509
I felt...

1790
02:44:54,689 --> 02:44:57,021
You turned out to be
a coward like Mohan.

1791
02:44:57,525 --> 02:44:59,015
But I was wrong.

1792
02:45:00,028 --> 02:45:03,361
That was respect for
me not cowardice.

1793
02:45:04,032 --> 02:45:05,624
The mistake is mine.

1794
02:45:07,035 --> 02:45:08,525
I am not worthy of you!

1795
02:45:09,037 --> 02:45:10,698
Forgive...

1796
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:13,769
"Rishi, forgive me!"

1797
02:45:19,047 --> 02:45:20,639
Forgive me.

1798
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:25,042
- What are you doing...
- You taught me...

1799
02:45:35,997 --> 02:45:39,990
"Albeit late, I fell in love"

1800
02:45:42,003 --> 02:45:47,407
"Albeit late, I fell in love"

1801
02:45:49,010 --> 02:45:53,003
"My beloved, you took away my heart"

1802
02:45:58,019 --> 02:46:03,013
You told me what love meant

1803
02:46:05,026 --> 02:46:09,520
You taught my heart to beat

1804
02:46:18,039 --> 02:46:23,705
"You gave restlessness
to my thirsty heart"

1805
02:46:24,045 --> 02:46:28,539
You taught me to pine

1806
02:46:30,051 --> 02:46:35,318
Anticipation can be killing

1807
02:46:36,992 --> 02:46:41,725
My beloved you took away my heart
