[cow mooing]
[indistinct chattering]

2
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,880
Kiran! Instead of playing games
on your phone,

3
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,090
why don't you play something devotional?

4
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,090
[music playing]

5
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,250
-Padma!
-Hmm.

6
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,460
Adilaksmi didn't sweep properly.
There is still dirt all over the floor.

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,920
Ask her to sweep again.

8
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,250
Kondal Rao's breakfast isn't here
and it is soon going to be 7 o'clock.

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,500
-Call them.
-I'll take care of them,

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,050
but the cow seems
to be reluctant to poop.

11
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,880
-You should take care of that first.
-[mumbling] Damn these gatherings!

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Not one job done properly!
Not even one! It's getting late.

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,920
Will the dung come anytime today?

14
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,590
We are getting late
and it didn't poop yet.

15
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,050
Did you feed it properly?

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Sir, how can you say so?
I personally fed it last night.

17
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,250
Hey, Kiran.
Where are you going?

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,420
Uncle, I urgently need to
use the bathroom.

19
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,960
No one should use the upstairs' bathroom
until the cow starts pooping.

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,630
Go downstairs.
Use a stick to make it poop.

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,460
Oh, no! You can't prod it with sticks.
It has to be natural, sir.

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,630
Did I spend all that money
on you and your cow for this?

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,550
The auspicious time is getting nearer.

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,710
It's not so easy. No one can say exactly
when these things will happen.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,210
I can. Every morning,

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,000
when my clock strikes eight,
I will be at it in my bathroom.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Then ask her the timings.

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,500
You should check that beforehand.
Uncle, don't pay him.

29
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,130
Huh! The cow is here,
so the fee must be paid.

30
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,090
Get out.
No pooping means no fee.

31
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,250
-We shall bring another cow.
-Wait, look, it is happening.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,460
Now that the important thing is over,
let's not quarrel.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,670
-Let's continue.
-Hmm.

34
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,550
[auspicious chanting]
[music]

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,090

[laughing]

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,380
[kids playing]

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,250
Hey! Hey!

38
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,920
Thank God!

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,210
Hey, girl! Hey, girl!
Kids these days!

40
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,380
Hey, boys! Someone please get me
some water. I'm thirsty.

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,630
The furniture moving
could have been done tomorrow.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,300
Why did you take up
two tasks simultaneously?

43
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,840
Yes, but tomorrow I'd need
to hire help to move them in.

44
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,340
Whereas today,
we've got our people, isn't it?

45
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,170
-[singing]
-Venkatesh.

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,090
Yes, uncle.

47
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,210
-Go upstairs and pull the rope.
-Okay.

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,960
It will be over in an hour
if everyone does it.

49
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,880
Anyway, why are these steps so steep?

50
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,210
It's difficult for us to climb.

51
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,050
How can your mother climb them
with her knee pains?

52
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,090
-Hey!
-Yes, uncle. Tell me.

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,000
We need to haul my mother up
in the chair.

54
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,300
There is no issue.

55
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,130
Grandmother, will you please get up?

56
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,960
If you come near me,
I will break your legs, you morons!

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,920
Didn't I warn you about this?

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
-Do you think I am an almirah,
-We will take care of that, grandma.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
-to hoist me up like that?
-Nothing will happen.

60
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,340
-Get up!
-What if I tumble off from there?

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,550
-Uncle, please tell her.
-Mother, we are here to take care.

62
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,050
It's just upstairs.

63
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,380
-Oh, God!
-Get up!

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,050
-No, listen to me.
-It's not too high. Come.

65
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,550
-Hey, Rahul!
-Yes, Father.

66
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,590
-Hold on to the rope and pull up.
-Okay.

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,590
-Don't worry, Mother.
-Pull it carefully.

68
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,590
Pull it properly.

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,090
Oh, God!
[chanting]

70
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,750
-Carefully. Don't worry.
-[reciting]

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Brother, pull it carefully.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,130
-She will kill me if she falls.
-Grandmother, you should lose weight.

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,960
[screaming]

74
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,800
[chanting]

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To hell with you!
Pull it carefully.

76
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,840
MIDDLE CLASS MELODIES

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,250
-Keep that in.
-Hmm.

78
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,920
It's 7 a.m.
and the chutney isn't done yet.

79
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,130
Deliver the breakfast at lunch.

80
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,920
Mallikarjun Rao needs to get his parcels

81
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,920
and the house warming
function needs its catering.

82
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,550
Whenever there is a huge order,

83
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,880
the whole household moves
at a snail's pace.

84
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,840
It has been ages
since he started stirring.

85
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,170
You know that there will be a power cut
at 6 o'clock, right?

86
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,000
Who will do the other tasks if you are
still preparing that Bombay chutney?

87
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,750
You could have done them
instead of sleeping.

88
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,250
What will you do
if I have to do everything?

89
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,710
Do you think that I ran this hotel
for 30 years

90
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,090
sleeping through the mornings?

91
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,590
Now, stop the stirring
and do the seasoning.

92
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,880
Look, you don't have to tell me
how to prepare Bombay chutney.

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Mind your work.

94
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,590
Don't give that bullshit.

95
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,170
Everyone knows that
you learnt it from your mother.

96
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,590
Stop shouting at him in the morning!

97
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,550
Don't take his side. I will put your head
in the grinder instead of chutney.

98
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,670
-Madam, milk.
-How dare you?

99
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,050
-You don't know about me.
-Yeah. The whole village knows about you.

100
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,050
If I say something,
both mother and son get angry.

101
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,880
Seems Kondal Rao is at it again.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We got used to it.

103
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,630
His voice serves as an alarm clock
for the whole village.

104
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,210
Anjaiah, what did you say?

105
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,670
Nothing. I was just saying that
your voice serenades everyone.

106
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,250
Hey! Are you ready?

107
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,250
Yeah!

108
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,130
Come fast.

109
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,090
Uncle, what's the delay?
Let's start serving the breakfast.

110
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,800
Excuse me.
[indistinct chattering]

111
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,170
[phone ringing]
Lakshmi, come here.

112
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,050
What is it?

113
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,670
It's Seenu.
Please talk to him.

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,590
Hello.

115
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,210
-Hello.
-Yeah, Seenu.

116
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,920
What is this, sister-in-law?
The breakfast is not here yet.

117
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,710
-Is he there?
-He is not feeling well.

118
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,300
But breakfast is ready. Raghava is on the
way, you will get them in half an hour.

119
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,750
-Okay, please make it quick.
-Okay.

120
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,250
He just creates a haste
without any reason!

121
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
Hey! We will come on the bike.
Follow us.

122
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,880
Okay, brother.

123
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,380
-Is everything loaded?
-Yes.

124
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,090
Be quick. It's already late.
They shouldn't be vexed.

125
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,590
Hey, go carefully.
Seems like you'll drop them on the road.

126
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,920
Stop pestering us.
Why don't you go and take a nap?

127
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,210
-You just irritate us!
-To hell with my sleep!

128
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,460
My back is hurting
due to this potholes.

129
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,340
We can go to Guntur happily
once these roadworks get completed.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,500
We can't ignore it, Mr. Contractor.

131
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,750
The road we constructed till now
will go in vain.

132
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Don't take it in a wrong way,
I am just being frank.

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,050
It's all out of my hands, sir.
The government is not responding.

134
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,550
Did you bring breakfast?

135
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,550
Uncle, didn't the workers come yet?

136
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,090
They are always late, just like this road.

137
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,090
Raghava, how are you?

138
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,000
Good, uncle.

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,590
Didn't I tell you about the delicious
Bombay chutney from our village?

140
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,500
He is the one who makes it.
He is Raghava.

141
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,210
Taste it and tell me how is it.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,170
It tastes good.

143
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,050
Okay, uncle. We'll be off then.

144
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,050
Did you repair my phone?

145
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,210
Yeah. I'll bring it when I come home.

146
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,380
Okay, then.
Raghava, here's the money.

147
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,340
It's okay, uncle.

148
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,710
Father said that he will collect when he
sees you later at the chit fund auction.

149
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,800
You have to pay
for last time as well.

150
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,590
Done. So, are you headed to Guntur?
It's for your hotel, isn't it?

151
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,300
No. We have a function to cater there.
That's all.

152
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,130
Yeah, I know.

153
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,420
-Hey!
-Yes.

154
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,960
How does your uncle know
about my hotel business?

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,000
Did you blurt it out to him?

156
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,710
Yes, what is it now?

157
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,170
Of course, it doesn't matter to you.
What if my father learns about this?

158
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,550
I can imagine him shooting off
like a bottle rocket.

159
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,710
Your father fears that you might end up
bankrupt after starting a hotel in Guntur.

160
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,130
I too faced the same thing
when I wanted to start a mobile shop.

161
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,800
They said, "He has lost his mind.
No one will buy those China phones."

162
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,800
Only my uncle believed in me.

163
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,550
He helped me set it up
by paying Rs. 25,000 out of his pocket.

164
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,090
Now when anyone needs a phone,
they have no other option but my shop.

165
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,800
If your father bothers you again,
tell him about my success story.

166
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,420
I did.

167
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,380
He said, "Just because
someone finds urine tasty,

168
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,340
it doesn't mean that
you should give it a try."

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
Hell, you! Your father just blurts out
whatever comes to his mind.

170
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,210
Whatever! Let's go and search a space
for the hotel now.

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,250
I won't.

172
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,840
You search along with your father.

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,210
You guys can enjoy each other's company.

Rs. 70,000.

-What?
-What?

185
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
Why is it that much?

186
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,840
A hotel in a state's capital
doesn't come cheap.

187
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,550
They are saying
the capital is going to be shifted.

188
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,670
But it still hasn't shifted yet, has it?
Come back when they do it.

189
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,380
Hey. That's a wrong turn.

190
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,000
This is Guntur. It doesn't matter here.
Even the cops go in the wrong route here.

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,750
There are more autos
than people in Guntur.

Get up... Hurry...

215
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,250
Sister-in-law,

216
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,380
we are also planning to construct the
first floor to our house just like this.

217
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,420
-We are planning for two years...
-Finally, the breakfast is here.

218
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,130
-...let us see when it happens.
-Did they bring breakfast?

219
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,800
-Move aside, I'm hungry.
-Isn't it?

220
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,050
Move aside.

221
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,130
-Must be a diabetic. Serve him first.
-Serve me as well.

222
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,960
Move aside. I'm very hungry. Move.

223

Upma, bonda, idli...

224
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,840
[gasps] Where is the chutney?

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,840
Hey, Seenu! The chutney is missing.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
-What?
-Where is the chutney?

227
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,250
Move, let me in.

228
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,550
-Oh, you hired a great caterer!
-To hell with him!

229
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,630
Is it that good?

230
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,590
I think it doesn't deserve
this reputation.

231
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,800
I can do a better job
with my chutney.

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,750
Look around you.

234
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,670
Do you think people are fools
to fall for reputation without taste?

235
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,840
This place has been running since
before we were even born.

236
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,170
I think it's due to lack of competition
and options.

237
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,500
The same old chutneys
served in the same old way.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,500
I will redefine taste when my hotel opens.

239
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,880
People will say Raghava introduced
Bombay chutney to Guntur.

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,460
Hey! It's my father.

242
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,250
Pick up or he will get suspicious.

243
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,090
Yes, Father.

244
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,420
Hello. Where are you?

245
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,130
-Ah...
-Hey! Say the bike got punctured.

246
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm at the house warming function.

247
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,880
Then give the phone to your Seenu uncle.

248
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,630
What is it, Father?
Your voice is cutting off.

249
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,500
Hello...

250
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,420
-At the function?-Hello!

251
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,880
-You should have said a punctured tyre.-Hello!

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,500
-The bike's tyre got punctured...
-Hey!

253
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,210
I'll hit you with footwear.
You rascal!

254
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,300
I don't care where you are!

255
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,710
The chutney hasn't reached

256
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,630
and if you don't get it there
in ten minutes,

257
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,300
I will break your spine.

258
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,420
That auto idiot
forgot to deliver the chutney.

259
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,130
Hey! You didn't deliver the chutney.
Where are you?

260
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,170
No, sir. I have delivered everything.
There's nothing here.

261
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,880
Sorry, sir.
I didn't see under the seat.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,710
Good job, useless fellow.
Now bring it here. Right now.

263
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,210
Okay, brother.
Should I bring it to Kolakaluru?

264
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,590
Not there, you idiot. To the function.

265
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,550
Okay. Disconnect the call. I'm coming.

266
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,300
We should have started our search
after the function.

267
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,920
Sandhya will be there.
You know that I can't face her now.

[people chattering]

269
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,800
Sorry, uncle. Our bike got punctured.

270
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,800
-Alright, go. Everyone is waiting.
-Sorry.

271
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,670
-You also go.
-You go first.

272
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,130
You also go and serve for yourself.

273
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,170
[people chattering]

274
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,670
Do you want more?

275
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,500
Raghava, is it true that you are looking
for a place for your hotel?

276
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,090
Yes, uncle.

277
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,380
I heard from Rahul.

278
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,880
I have a shed.
Do you want to check it out?

279
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,590
It would suit a hotel perfectly.

280
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,250
It is right in the middle
of the market.

281
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,880
Take it only if you like it.

282
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,300
Ok, uncle.
I will see it.

283
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,500
Then come to my house after the function,
I will show you the place.

284
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,460
Pour some chutney.

285
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,130
Enough.

286
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,670
-How are you, brother?
-I feared he would recognize us.

287
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,630
What did he want?

288
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,800
He wants to show me
some shed of his for my hotel.

289
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
That's good.

290
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,880
Not good. I don't like Sandhya thinking
that I am doing all this for her.

291
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,050
Hi, Krishna. How are you?

292
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm good, Gopal.
Why did you come so early?

293
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,090
-Do you want some new phones?
-We can order the same Yellow phone

294
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,050
if you want.

295
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,710
Heard that you had a daughter.
Goddess Lakshmi came to your house.

296
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,800
Thank you. Even my mother...

297
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,340
-Can you show me any of the new models?
-Alright.

298
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,210
-Hey!
-Yeah?

299
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,880
Stop following her movements
like a creepy sunflower.

300
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,880
Okay.

301
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,250
[clears throat]

302
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,750
Hey! Wipe that smile off.

303
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,750
Is it that obvious?

304
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,630
Yeah.

305
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,460
These are the new ones.

306
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,670
-Yeah, we will take them all.
-Okay.

307
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,880
Sir.

308
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, seems like
I forgot the money, Krishna.

309
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll buy them later.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,380
Hey! I have the money.

311
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,670
Did I ask you?

312
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,000
I will come later, Krishna.

313
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,710
No problem, Gopal.
You are a regular customer.

314
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,550
You can pay later.

315
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,090
No problem, Krishna.
I will be coming back anyway.

316
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll buy it then.

317
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,800
See you later, Krishna.

318
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
-Girl, keep them inside.
-You are so cunning.

319
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,750
Stop it.

320
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,460
Hey! You will get a break
only when you learn it.

321
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,210
Sandhya, see if he has done it.

322
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,380
Friction is a force
that opposes the motion.

323
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
-Friction...
-Tell me.

324
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,420
Friction... Friction that...
[doorbell rings]

325
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,380
Hey! Let's go back.

326
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,550
He doesn't remember us. Don't worry. Hey!

327
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,550
Hi.

328
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,420
Raghava. Come in.

329
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,170
Uncle asked me to come.

330
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,300
He said that there is a shed
I could check out.

331
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,300
He is still in the office.

332
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,210
Raghava is here for the shed.

333
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,630
How is that shed suited for a hotel?

334
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,000
There used to be a barbershop, right?

335
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,090
He will take care of those things.

336
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,840
-He is not a kid.
-Oh, no!

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,170
Don't shout!

338
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,500
This phone doesn't work without a speaker.

339
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,750
Looks like you are going
to hash up this whole deal.

340
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,920
Give him the phone.

341
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,840
Let's just see it once.
We will decide later.

342
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,500
Uncle is on the phone.
He wants to speak with you.

343
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,750
-You take it.
-Hello, uncle.

344
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,800
Raghava, I've some work in
the office and couldn't come.

345
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,130
I will give you the address,
take the keys and check the place out.

346
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,630
It's the third lane in Donka Road.
You will see a Sai Baba temple there.

347
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,840
I am not too familiar with Guntur, uncle.

348
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Is that so?

349
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,710
Uh... Is Sandhya there?

350
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,300
For Sandhya.

351
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,380
Sandhya?

352
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,920
Sandhya?

353
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,960
Your father.

354
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,000
Father.

355
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,170
Take Raghava and show him our shed.

356
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,960
Me?

357
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,710
There is no problem.
He is like a brother to you.

358
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Why is this so shabby?

359
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,880
Okay, I will check the surroundings,
meanwhile, you talk with your brother.

360
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,920
Hey, kiddo. Come with me.

361
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,210
-Let's go that way.
-Okay, uncle.

362
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,090
Uncle! Who here looks like your uncle?

363
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,750
-Which grade are you in?
-I'm in sixth grade.

364
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,960
Don't worry.
I will say that I didn't like the shed.

365
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,050
I came here just for formality
because I said I would check it out.

366
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,420
I think I have seen you somewhere.

367
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,500
That can't be true.
This is my first visit to Guntur.

368
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,420
I don't want the shed, uncle.

369
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,550
What? You didn't like it?

370
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,250
It's just that there's a tree
blocking the view.

371
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,750
Also, the location
is in some far-flung corner of the city.

372
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,630
I mean...

373
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,250
You are the first one to say
that you didn't like the shed.

374
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,840
Once the business gets rolling,

375
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,340
everyone will start calling it
the "Hotel-behind-the-tree."

376
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,630
What's your budget?

377
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,210
I'm thinking of taking a lease.
Somewhere around four.

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,710
Four? For four lakhs
you wouldn't even get my shed.

379
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,500
This is Guntur, not Kolakalur.

380
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,420
Look, I am telling you all this
because I care for you.

381
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,550
I can easily get a lease
at 25,000 a month that is six lakhs.

382
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,880
But because it's you,
I will give it to you for five.

383
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,250
For both, rate and place,
this is a double bonanza for you.

384
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,920
No, uncle.
We decided not to take the place.

385
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,630
-Listen to me...
-We'll leave.

386
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,800
[gate creaking]

387
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,630

388
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,130
-Are you done with your exam?
-Yeah.

389
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,170
[people chattering]

390
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,210
How was it?

391
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,710
Superb.

392
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,340
You?

393
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,300
Yeah, right!

394
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,210
Will you stay here for a while?

395
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,170
Why? Do you have something to say?

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,210
Nothing, just casually.

397
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,880
What is next?

398
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,210
Vacating the hostel and going home.

399
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,750
I mean, what is next with your education.

400
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,170
There is no hope in EAMCET.
I may join degree. What about you?

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,130
I don't know.
Whatever my father decides for me.

402
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,800
Who knows how long it will be
before we meet up again.

403
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,670
Is there a need to meet again?

404
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,550
"Sandhya..."

405
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,880
"Is it the shyness that is stopping you?"

406
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,800
"Brother-in-law..."

407
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,460
"Is that what you want to
call him but hesitate?"

408
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,340
"You just have to stay strong,
steady and straight"

409

in line automatically"

"The fate will get its happy ending"

412
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,050
"Do you even know"

413
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,550
"How far or how close is he to you?"

414
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,840
"Do you even like floating"

415
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,300
"In this limbo of love?"

416
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,960
"You stuffed your feelings in your heart"

417
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,000
"When will you let them out?"

418
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,210
"Time to end your friendship with shyness"

419
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,210
"It's a sin, when will you realize this?"

420
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,090
"Sandhya..."

421
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,550
"Is it the shyness that is stopping you?"

to call him but hesitate?"

Raghava.

425
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,590
It's a friendship band.

426
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,420
Call me "bava".

427
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,800
-Uh-huh!
-Then forget it.

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,050
"The love you think you are expressing
is not enough"

429
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,340
"Just staring at him
won't help you anyway"

430
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,710
"He looks brash from the outside"

431

"But he secretly likes you"

"Just take your aim and hit him
with your love arrow"

in the next moment"

Huh?

444
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,090
I want to say something.

445
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,710
Tell me.

446
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,840
The thing is...

447
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,380
Say it.

448
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,920
The thing is, I...

449
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,750
You... Tell me.

-Good.

Get on.

Hey! Stop.

How did you do in your exam?

457
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,000
It went well, Mother.

458
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,670
Kamala, make some coffee.

459
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,670
There is no milk. Go and bring some.

460
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Mother, I am going to Yamini's house
to discuss the exam.

Look, she came.

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,420
-She might be asking us to come there.
-Get on.

463
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,630
Wait here.

464
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,000
Raghava, what are you doing here?

465
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,000
You were about to say something?

466
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,920
It's not a good time now.
Please, leave.

467
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,420
It's okay. Tell me, Sandhya.

468
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,710
I want to hear
what you were going to say.

-Listen to me.
-Don't worry, Sandhya.

I know what you were going to say.

473
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,210
Just say it. I will say accept it.

474

Raghava, not at this moment.

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,960
-Just say it. I will say accept it.
-It will be a problem.

-Shucks!
-What's the matter now?

486
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,800
Ask him. Ask him where he was

487
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,960
when he was supposed to be
at the function.

488
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,710
Mother, I want to start my hotel
in Guntur.

489
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,710
I don't want to get stuck
in the same place my whole life.

490
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,550
What is it you want to do in Guntur?

491
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,710
Twenty-five years of age
and a brain worth a rat's pellet.

492
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Cool down and hear him out.

493
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,050
What's there to hear?

494
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,420
I had to listen to Seenu
while he insulted me.

495
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,460
I had to suffer with that idiot
for something he did.

496
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,500
To hell with his Guntur!

497
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,130
Yes. I will go to Guntur. So what?

498
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,250
I make delicious Bombay chutney
and is anyone here even eating it!

499
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,840
Our hotel is a meeting point
for everyone to come and shoot the crap!

500
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,750
Stop building castles in the air.
It is not that easy in Guntur.

501
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,710
There is a hotel
in every corner in Guntur.

502
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,170
Even if there are, it doesn't matter.

503
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,380
None of them makes Bombay chutney.
I believe in myself.

504
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,090
I also equally believe that
I cannot grow in this village.

505
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,750
You have already grown 6 feet
like a bamboo. What more do you want?

506
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,800
Shucks!

507
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,000
Hey! Eat something and go.
I have prepared food for you, too.

508
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,460
Give it to a beggar tomorrow.

509
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,340
Do the seasoning and serve the same meal
to him tomorrow.

510
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Will you both stop for a moment?

511
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,050
You don't know how to talk
and he doesn't know how to take it.

512
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,670
I am fed up with your quarrels.

513
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,340
I feel like I should leave you guys.

514
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,250
Listen, these legs are killing me.
Would you come and massage them?

515
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,170
This song is from
"Samsaram Oka Chadarangam."

516
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,960
Mother, bring some onions.

517
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,340
And uncle, everyone in the village
is talking about the road.

518
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,710
Saying that Mallikarjun Rao
is keeping his word and standing firm.

519
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,210
Yeah, and all this standing
is hurting his legs.

520
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,840
Who asked him to make a promise?

521
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,670
What happened, uncle?

522
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,000
Halfway through the project
the government stopped giving funds.

523
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,420
Frankly, the work was stopped.

524
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,460
To keep the work going,
I have to dig into my pocket.

525
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,590
The chit fund business was better
than politics.

526
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,800
Politics are for those
who have a thick hide,

527
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,340
and we know how soft you are.

528
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Come on, this is the difference between
those ordinary politicians and uncle.

529
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,500
His horoscope is not an ordinary one.

530
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,630
I have seen it personally.
He will live on for 80 years.

531
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,130
He won't stop at being a president.

532
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,170
Even his horoscope says
he will become an MLA.

533
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,210
I'm sure he will make a great MLA.

534
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,300
Are you pulling my leg?

535
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
It's true, uncle.
Come to the shop tomorrow.

536
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,920
I will show you your horoscope
on my computer.

537
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,090
Gopal, stop giving him false hope,

538
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,420
-or I will skin you alive.
-I'm leaving.

539
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,630
Do you want to become an MLA?

540
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Eat your roti first.

541
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,550
To hell with his MLA!

542
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,710
[dog barking]
Will you have some idly, Mr. Murthy?

543
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,210
No, thanks, Kondal Rao.
I already ate at home.

544
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,050
This Trump's insanity
seems to be escalating day by day.

545
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,130
Is he crazy?

546
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,380
You are concerned
because your son is living there, teacher.

547
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,670
It's all talent. Those people
don't work as hard as our people.

548
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,420
But, why will they not resist our people
taking away their jobs despite the talent?

549
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,550
These are just an exemption
but there is politics underneath!

550
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,090
Jobs are an issue
created by Trump for local votes...

551
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,460
He's got no dearth of pride!

552
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,550
"I have no problem with you setting up
a hotel in our shed. Sandhya!"

553
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,210
I thought there was something like this
when you came to me early in the morning.

554
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,500
So, it's all good, isn't it?

555
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,590
Anyway, may be Sandhya might think...

556
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,380
Hey! Whose loss is it going to be?

557
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,960
She texted you that she doesn't
have a problem, didn't she?

558
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,250
Go set up your hotel if you like it.
I don't like that shed.

559
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,130
Okay, I will take it.

560
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,670
Alright, your father is yet
to stamp his approval.

561
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,460
Mother, are you feeling alright?

562
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,300
Nothing as such. I was just lying down.

563
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,340
Wash your hands, I'll serve food.

564
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,460
I had my dinner. Did you eat?

565
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,170
Yes, but...

566
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,710
Are you taking
that Nageshwar Rao's shed?

567
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,710
He called your father.

568
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,460
Did father say anything?

569
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,250
Why so serious? Huh?

570
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,800
Do you think you are a bigwig
to get things easily?

571
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,800
Is it? When have I got something I wished
for easy in this house?

572
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,750
What did we deprive you of then?

573
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,800
Where did she keep the damn oil bottle?

574
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,670
Okay. Let's not start in front of him.
Go and sleep. We will talk tomorrow.

575
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,170
Okay.

576
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,170
Yeah, it's here.

577
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,550
-You've become old already.
-Hmm.

578
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,750
The doctor specifically said
not to sit on the floor.

579
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,920
But you won't listen.

580
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,960
When have you and your son
ever listened to me?

581
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,130
Keep your voice down.
I'm too tired to mediate a fight.

582
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,710
Why? Has he grown old enough
to start his own hotel?

583
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,000
Ouch! Be gentle.

584
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,670
Of course, he has grown up.

585
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,210
You were the one saying
that he should get serious with life.

586
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,050
Now, he is trying something on his own.

587
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,880
He should mind his business, shouldn't he?

588
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,250
Yeah, ask him to arrange
the money as well.

589
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,090
I'm not giving him any of mine.

590
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,500
Yeah, like you have
a treasure hidden somewhere.

591
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,750
Do you remember what you said
when we came here 30 years ago?

592
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,710
You said, "Your father didn't
give you anything,"

593
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,500
"and my father didn't save anything."

594
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,380
Didn't you say that it would've been nice
if someone gives us a leg up?

595
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,590
Isn't it only fair for him
to expect the same from his parents?

596
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
I'm just looking out for him.

597
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,050
It seems I always turn out to be
the villain but no one understands me.

598
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:12,130
Anyway, just give him the chit fund money
so that he can pay the advance.

599
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,750
I won't.

600
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,300
Why did you massage just one leg? Come.

601
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,000
Nope. I'm sleepy.

602
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Oh, no!

603
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,800
It's hard convincing some people.

604
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,250
We will manage. Go take a shower.
Hot water is ready.

605
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,590
Ready? Now pray to God.

606
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,750
No!

607
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,500
Take this. Go and pay the advance
to Nageshwar Rao.

608
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,920
What's with this sudden change?

609
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,800
Did God come in your dreams
and tell you to help me?

610
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,170
It's us who has to help you.

611
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,250
How does it matter to you
when the money is not yours?

612
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
We think before acting.

613
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,590
We should think of the pros and cons
before investing in something.

614
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,050
Now go and pay.

615
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,420
Ouch! Careful with the money, you moron!

616
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,960
It's great that
your father agreed to it, Raghava.

617
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,300
Yesterday he was singing a different tune.

618
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,300
It's just that one has to think twice
with such costly affairs.

619
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,460
But this is a good decision.

620
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,460
Businesses are always better than jobs.

621
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,670
But the advance stays with me,
there is no returning it.

622
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,000
It's just that we want to build
a portion on top

623
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,340
so that we lend it out for rent.

624
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,380
I'm planning to build it with
your remaining payment.

625
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,960
There's money coming in next week.
We will pay off the rest then.

626
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,920
Alright.

627
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,460
-We will leave then.
-Alright.

628
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

629
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,920
Krishna, how's your Lakshmi?

630
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,800
She is fine, Gopal. How are you...

631
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,000
Why do you even ask me?

632
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,880
Hi.

633
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,750
Tell me.

634
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,420
Can you show me some good phone
in the range of Rs. 400?

635
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,710
There are no phones for Rs. 400.
Starting price is Rs. 700.

636
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,880
-Is that okay?
-No problem.

637
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,460
Check these.

638
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,250
-Is the voice clarity fine in these?
-Yeah.

639
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,130
I need to speak with you,
can you come outside?

640
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,460
How much is this?

641
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,750
Rs. 2,000.

642
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,630
-Must be a camera phone.
-Yeah.

643
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
The colour reproduction
isn't bad, right?

644
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,840
I will be at the cloth store.

645
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I recently bought a camera phone
on Krishna's recommendation.

646
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,840
Blue dress became black in the photos.

647
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,050
My customers are complaining.

648
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,380
Okay, I will take these later.

649
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,960
Bye, Krishna. Don't forget.
The cloth store outside.

650
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,340
[vehicles honking]

651
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,920
Krishna, it's just...

652
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,960
Can you show me those phones again?

653
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,960
Okay.

654
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,050
Why didn't you come? Are you angry?

655
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,590
Which phone did you like previously?

656
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,420
The whole street is filled
with cloth stores.

657
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Which one should I come to?

658
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,460
-Venkateswara Fashions.
-Hmm.

659
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,710
Keep this model aside.

660
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,550
See you, bye.

661
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,170
[vehicles honking]

662
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:17,960
Gopal.

663
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,710
Sorry. Hi.

664
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,670
Come inside.

665
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,250
Hi.

666
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,920
So, what is it?

667
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,750
It's just that I wanted
to ask you something for a long time.

668
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,420
Is that so?

669
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,590
Yes.

670
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,630
Even I wanted to say something to you.

671
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,340
Is it? What is that?

672
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,960
No, you first.

673
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,170
That is... I don't know
how to bring this up.

674
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,590
But if you don't mind...

675
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,170
Can I have your date of birth?

676
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
16th January 1995.

677
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,380
-Okay, thanks.
-Why do you want it?

678
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,210
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'll tell you later.

679
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,920
-Ms. Gouthami.
-Yeah?

680
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,090
You didn't tell me the time of birth.

681
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,840
7:30 a.m.

682
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,960
Okay, thanks. Bye.

683

[bike starting]

684
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,380
What did he say?
Did he propose?

685
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,550
No! He asked my date of birth.

686
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,250
So he wants to set the date
for the marriage.

687
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,090
I wish you were right.

688
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,590
Of course, it's the only way.

689
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,300
I can't leave my family in this situation.

690
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,800
I should take care of them
even after getting married.

691
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,460
I went to tell him all that.
But he left without even listening to me.

692
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,340
I think Gopal will understand
your situation.

693
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,000
Gopal is so much better than
the auto driver your father arranged.

694
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,050
[people chattering]

695
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,630
January 16th at 7:30 a.m.

696
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Eight?

697
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,670
Online horoscope.

698
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,340
I'm going for the chit fund auction,
do you need any vegetables?

699
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,710
-No, we already have it.
-Okay.

700
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,300
[indistinct chattering]
Hey!

701
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,420
What did you talk to her yesterday?

702
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,300
That's personal.

703
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,170
Just say what happened.

704
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,170
Leave it be.
Why should we bother about it?

705
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,590
-These things don't work out.
-Hey!

706
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,130
Stop blabbering and come to the point.

707
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,460
I didn't talk much with her.

708
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,960
I just asked for her date of birth.

709
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,670
What, idiot?
Aren't you ashamed?

710
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,750
Are you even educated?

711
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,380
She may have been hurt.

712
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,590
Stop it. What did I do to hurt her?

713
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,710
Did I ask for her caste
or did I ask her to go out with me?

714
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,630
I just wanted to check if our horoscopes
match for marriage.

715
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,840
They didn't match and I left it at that.
What's wrong with that?

716
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,420
Nothing's wrong.
You are just too great.

717
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,300
-I know. Now give me two more bondas.
-You!

718
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,380
Raghava, bring me two idlis.

719
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,170
Raghava, I heard that
you are shifting to Guntur?

720
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,170
Yes.

721
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,710
Is it?
Why do you want to do that?

722
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,840
Going to the city has now become
a fashion among the youth.

723
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,380
What's wrong with this place?

724
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,250
What's great about this place to like?

725
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,250
Not even one of you dirty faces
come here to eat.

726
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,590
You read newspaper and chit-chat
for two hours and eat just two idlis.

727
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,800
Drat!

728
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,460
What's the use to cook for someone
who doesn't even eat?

729
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,710
And if it weren't for the newspaper,
half of you wouldn't come here.

730
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,630
What are you talking about?

731
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,050
Don't forget that your father's roots
are in this same place.

732
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,340
That's why he is rooted in the same spot
with no growth of any sort.

733
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,500
Our lives would've been different
if it was another place.

734
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,420
I increased the dosa's rate by Rs. 1
and you were all complaining.

735
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,340
I mean, who has ever heard
of five-rupee dosa?

736
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,380
Go to Guntur,
the prices will knock you senseless.

737
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,710
Did any of you ever properly eat
my delicious Bombay chutney?

738
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,300
You will know my value
once I go to Guntur.

739
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,840
Idiots!

740
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,250
Raghava! Look over there.

741
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,460
[breaths heavily]

742
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,590
-Kondal Rao.
-Father, what happened?

743
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,550
That bastard Mallikarjun Rao
has disappeared

744
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,050
along with the chit fund money.

745
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,250
-Oh, no!
-Yeah!

746
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,920
Nobody knows where he is.

747
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:33,750
His family doesn't know
his whereabouts.

748
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,920
The money doesn't matter to them.

749
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,090
-Calm down.
-Drink some water.

750
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,420
-Drink some water.
-I won't spare him!

751
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,460
Kondal Rao, why are you so aggressive?

752
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,340
You will know
when you lose 6 lakh rupees.

753
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,380
Raghava, this anger isn't good
for your father.

754
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,050
If you can't control your aggression,

755
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,840
your blood pressure will result
in a cardiac arrest!

756
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,550
You will lose another 6 lakh
for the surgery.

757
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,590
-Hell with the surgery!
-Father.

758
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,710
-Why don't you listen to me?
-Raghava, let's go.

759
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
This thing has to be cleared up
once and for all.

760
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,880
-Why are you behaving like this?
-Come.

761
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,420
At least take your shirt.

762
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,710
Uncle, Kondal Rao is getting into a brawl.
Come, let's watch.

763
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Is it?
Let's go.

764
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,380
Wait a moment!

765
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,590
You bastards!

766
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,250
I saved every penny of mine

767
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,130
for my granddaughter's education
and you stole it.

768
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,340
-Hey, Anjaiah!
-What?

769
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,800
Shut up with your drunk ramblings
and keep in mind who you are talking to!

770
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,420
Hey, stop it! I am fully aware
that I am talking to a thieving bastard.

771
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,880
-Get lost!
-Hey! What's your problem, Anjaiah?

772
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,710
Our family is distraught
over the disappearance of my father

773
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,920
and you're making a scene.

774
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,250
Your problems are insignificant to us
as ours are to you.

775
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,920
-No one else can understand your problems!
-Your money is in safe hands.

776
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,090
What if my father isn't here?
Aren't we here to pay the debts?

777
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,130
-Do we seem like thieves?
-Hey!

778
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,130
If someone has something to say
then it should be Mr. Kondal Rao.

779
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,920
He's owed 6 lakh,
and yet he is calm.

780
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,630
To hell with your 1 lakh rupees?

781
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,340
Even he created
a big scene moments ago.

782
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,670
To all those here,

783
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,170
I'll return your amount with interest
once my father returns.

784
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,210
-Is it?
-Understand?

785
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,590
I will return.

786
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,210
Hold on, listen to me.

787
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,340
-Anjaiah.
-Yes.

788
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,800
-Meet me after a month.
-What?

789
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,090
Meet me after a month.

790
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,710
A month, is it?

791
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,420
-Yeah, we shall see that!
-Damn my life!

792
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,960
Having to put up with these men.

793
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,590
We shall see that!

794
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,880
Just wait and see what I will do
if you don't pay me back in a month.

795
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,840
All my dreams crumbling in a single day!

796
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,170
Damn!

797
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,670
And I can't believe
that your uncle absconded.

798
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,920
How can Surendra arrange so much money
in one month? Poor guy.

799
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,210
What about my hotel now?

800
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,250
Will someone lend us money?

801
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,750
No one.

802
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,300
Things are now beyond our control.
Forget about the hotel.

803
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,670
Just like a lake dries up when an
unlucky guy goes to wash his body,

804
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,000
this idiot is of no benefit to me,
all he incurs is a loss.

805
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:45,500
The moment he mentioned his hotel
in Guntur, we've lost all our money.

806
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,210
What's his fault in this?
Don't blame him for everything.

807
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,420
No further discussion.

808
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,170
Forget about Guntur and the hotel!

809
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,800
Your only option is to stay
and work in the village. Else, sit idle.

810
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,590
You're well aware of it, aren't you?

811
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,090
How can you say that?
We paid the advance, right?

812
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,460
Forget about it! What more is there
to lose for a guy who's lost everything.

813
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,130
I'll just think that I lost
another Rs. 50,000 on him.

814
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,300
You are talking senseless!

815
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,630
Where am I supposed to bring
in the money from?

816
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,340
Shall I sell my soul to the devil?

817
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,340
You need not lend me the money.

818
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,500
We can sell our land in Santha Magaluru.

819
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,460
What?

820
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,750
I'm saying the land...

821
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,880
I will beat you senseless
if you mention the land again.

822
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,750
You don't understand...

823
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,210
That's the only property we have.
You can forget your hotel.

824
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,090
No point in talking to him.
He will sell us too for his selfishness.

825
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,630
You should share part of the blame.

826
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,750
I kept saying that you shouldn't keep
all your eggs in one basket.

827
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,170
You invested all the money with him saying
that Mallikarjun Rao is trustworthy.

828
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,800
Now he cheated us!

829
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,840
How would I know that Mallikarjun Rao
would do such a thing?

830
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,380
[indistinct chattering]

831
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,380
We wouldn't have faced this day
if you had listened to me!

832
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,210
If you really think I am selfish.

833
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,590
then I don't need
the Guntur hotel anymore.

834
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,880
I will stay here and look after our hotel.

835
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,250
Dear...

836
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,880
I'm not saying this
because I'm upset.

837
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,710
I've thought about it.
You don't need to fight for it.

838
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,960
-What's this?
-[goat bleating]

839
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,170
Dear, how are you planning
for this year's temple festival?

840
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,630
What does he know?

841
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,500
How much is the festival's estimated cost?

842
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,170
-We aren't sure about it.
-Sir.

843
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:27,380
I was drunk and spoke very badly
the other day. Forgive me.

844
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,840
I know that 1 lakh isn't much to you,

845
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,460
-but it's a huge amount for us.
-Damn, my life!

846
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,960
Not a moment's peace! Every bastard wants
to drill in life lessons.

847
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,840
Sir.

848
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:48,130
[birds chirping]

849
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,590
-Anjaiah.
-Yes, sir.

850
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,050
How are you arranging
your granddaughter's college fees?

851
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,460
I can't figure it out, sir.

852
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,170
-Why?
-No one is ready to lend me the money.

853
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,550
Things would have been different
if her parents had been alive.

854
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,340
I have no other choice, but to stop
sending her to college.

855
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,550
Oh, no! You are uneducated
but your granddaughter studies well.

856
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,550
Let her study.

857
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,750
I'm lending you. This is my pension
money and you have to return it.

858
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,710
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

859
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,750
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

860
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,670
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

861
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,840
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

862
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,550
"Hail Lord Shiva"

863
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,550
"Hail Lord Shiva"

864
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,880
"I wanted to anoint you
with the sacred water"

865
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,750
"When I want to anoint you
with the sacred water"

866
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,920
"You reject it saying it is impure
with the saliva of frogs and fishes"

867
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,670
"Hail Lord Shiva"

868
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,630
"Hail Lord Shiva"

869
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,300
Why are you still here?
Didn't you go to Guntur?

870
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Are you satisfied now?

871
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,550
"Hail Lord Shiva"

872
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,000
"I wanted to bring the cow milk
for your offerings"

873
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,880
"I wanted to bring the cow milk
for your offerings"

874
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,090
"You reject the cow milk"

875
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,800
"Saying it is impure
with the saliva of the calves"

876
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,800
-"Hail Lord Shiva"
-Say it loud!

877
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,460
-"Hail Lord Shiva"
-That's it!

878
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,420
[phone ringing]

879
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,920
-Hello!
-Brother-in-law, it's me, Nageshwar Rao.

880
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,500
Bloody scoundrel! Why the hell did he do
such a terrible thing?

881
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:05,460
Come to the point.

882
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,550
It's just that Raghava's advance
is still with me,

883
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,340
many people are asking
if the shed is still available.

884
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,670
-Sell it.
-[gasps]

885
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,380
What did he say?

886
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,050
We shouldn't have bought
all this construction material.

887
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,590
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

888
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,590
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

889
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,090
Hey, Gouthami.
Why don't you get in my auto for once?

890
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,840
Hey! I'm talking to you!

891
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,750
You will be my wife anyhow.

892
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,630
Your father gave me his word,
what's your problem?

893
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,000
"I wanted to bring the flowers
for your pooja"

894
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,130
-Sister!
-Yeah, I'm coming.

895
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,670
Aren't you coming?

896
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,630
"You reject them saying they are impure
with the saliva of the honey bees"

897
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:54,130
"Hail Lord Shiva"

898
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,250
"Hail Lord Shiva"

899
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,590
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

900
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,420
-"Hail Lord Shiva"
-Louder!

901
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,630
"I wanted to bring coconut to offer you"

902
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,840
"I wanted to bring coconut to offer you"

903
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,550
"You said you love it at once"

904
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,380
"Hail Lord Shiva"

905
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,380
"Hail Lord Shiva"

906
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,550
"Hail Lord Shiva"

907
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:36,750
"Hail Lord Shiva"

908
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,130
Is there any news
of Mallikarjun Rao's whereabouts?

909
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,000
Not yet, brother. Gopal and Surendra
are trying their best.

910
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,670
A few of them are saying that
he stole the money and absconded.

911
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,670
Who said that?

912
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,750
All that money was put
into the road repair.

913
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
We haven't used anybody's money
for our personal use.

914
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,750
Damn you!

915
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,920
I kept telling him not to take
the project personally.

916
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,920
But he didn't listen to me!

917
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,840
Nobody listens when it
has to happen in our fate.

918
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,920
He trusted that contractor.

919
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,960
He gave him all his own money
along with the chit fund money.

920
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,960
He wanted to ensure the roads
are constructed properly.

921
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,460
But the contractor absconded
with the fund money when it came.

922
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,210
He never breaks his promise.

923
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,130
Stop crying.

924
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,960
-Please control yourself.
-This is not the time to discuss all this.

925
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,000
We should first find where he is.

926
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,420
Nageshwar Rao, did you sell the shed?

927
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,210
Hold on to it.

928
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,380
We have an acre of land
in Santha Magaluru.

929
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,420
We will sell it off and pay up the rest.

930
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,090
Where in Santha Magaluru?

931
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,460
-Are you aware of the malachamma tree?
-Father.

932
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,670
-Yeah!
-100 meters from there. But why?

933
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,460
I will call you back.

934
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,340
I said I am done
with the Guntur business, didn't I?

935
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,460
Then what is this?

936
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,880
I don't want you to sell that land.

937
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,460
Why do you get so irate?

938
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,460
You should not take everything to heart.

939
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,500
We elders say many things.

940
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,670
How can you get so retrogressed
for such a small thing?

941
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,710
We have thought about it thoroughly.

942
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,960
Now keep quiet.
[phone ringing]

943
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,590
Yes, brother-in-law.

944
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,340
What price do you expect
for this land to get sold for?

945
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,750
Someone offered six lakhs for it.
It would be more than six.

946
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:20,210
Look, you will sell it to someone else,
he will pay you for it

947
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,500
you will pay me that money
for the shed...

948
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,840
Why all this hassle?

949
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,500
How about selling the land to me?
I will give you the shed in return.

950
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,000
We can keep the property in the family
by doing so.

951
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,000
What do you say?

952
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,550
Fine. Let's do it that way then.

953
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,050
Alright, then.

954
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,380
Let's mark up a good day
for you to go to Guntur.

955
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,750
[indistinct chattering]

956
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,130
-Brother-in-law, I'm here.
-Okay.

957
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,840
[indistinct chattering]

958
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,960
Why are you so late?

959
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,210
-Come, Raghava.
-Yeah, uncle.

960
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,380
Did you learn something
about Mallikarjun Rao?

961
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,340
No.

962
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,050
How's Lakshmi?
It's been a while since I saw her.

963
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,170
She's good.

964
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,920
-Come to the house when you are in Guntur.
-Okay.

965
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,630
I am tired of sweeping
with these cement bags in the house.

966
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,090
You can do it yourself from tomorrow.

967
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,630
All this housework will come in handy
once you marry.

968
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,000
We can get the construction started
once the registration is over.

969
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,960
But father needs cash for construction.

970
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,550
What's that got to do
with the registration?

971
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:34,670
Money can be arranged easily
by taking a loan.

972
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,670
But getting good land is not easy.

973
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,840
Moreover, there is a highway
coming there.

974
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,670
Your father learnt it from his office.

975
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,340
The land value will increase
ten-fold it seems.

976
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,750
Isn't it good to buy it when it's cheaper?

977
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,630
What are you saying? Is it true?

978
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,380
What do I get lying to you?
Now, come and cut the vegetables.

979
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,420
Oh, no!

980
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,880
[line ringing]

981
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:10,170
[indistinct chattering]
[phone vibrating]

982
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,710
[phone vibrating]

983
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,460
Where are you going now? Sit down.

984
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,250
Gopal.

985
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,800
[line ringing]

986
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,000
[phone ringing]
[singing]

987
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,210
Hello.

988
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,960
-Hello.
-Who is this?

989
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,000
Is Gopal there?

990
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:48,050
He's taking a shower.
Who's this?

991
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,880
I'm Sandhya, aunty.

992
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,550
Sandhya? What do you want from Gopal?

993
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,590
It's urgent. I'm Gopal's friend.

994
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,090
Wait a minute then. Gopal.

995
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,500
Gopal.

996
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,750
Yes.

997
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,500
Someone called Sandhya is on the line.

998
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,130
Sandhya?

999
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,960
Why is she calling me?

1000
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
Tell her I'll call back.

1001
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,340
He said that he'll call back...

1002
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,460
Why did the call drop?

1003
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,250
[line beeping]

1004
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,880
You have insufficient balance
to make this call.

1005
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,090
Mother, where's your phone?

1006
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,750
Your father took it to get it repaired.

1007
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,090
-Come and cut the vegetables.
-Urgh!

1008
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,670
Where are you going?

1009
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,960
Mother, I've some urgent work,
I have to go.

1010
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,630
What's more urgent than
peeling a ridge gourd?

1011
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,130
Do you know Yamini, my junior?

1012
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,050
She called me
that she reached the centre.

1013
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,380
I'll give her my book and come back.

1014
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,050
You have a phone in your hand
but where's the book?

1015
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:49,880
I forgot.

1016
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,050
Hey!

1017
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,920
Mother, why don't you tell all at once
instead of troubling me?

1018
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,880
Is that how you dress
when you go out?

1019
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,880
-Change your clothes and go.
-Urgh!

1020
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,250
This girl has gone nuts!

1021
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,880
Move aside. Move, move.
Nageshwar Rao, you're up next.

1022
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,130

Please, I'm in a hurry.

1029
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,880

Oh! What are you saying?
Your father is so cunning.

1050

Okay, I'll try to reach Kondal Rao uncle,
you try Raghava's phone.

Here it is, sir.

Hey, Sandhya!
Why did you call me so many times?

1068
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,460
I was sandwiched between your father
and my father and hence I couldn't pick.

1069
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,550
Was it urgent?

1070
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,090
Is the registration over?

1071
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,250
Yes. Just now.
I'm outside the office.

1072
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,920
I called to stop it.

1073
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,500
Stop it? Why?

1074
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,210
What are you saying, Sandhya?
Is it true?

1075
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:49,550
Oh, no! I am a dead man
if my father knows this.

1076
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,380
Why did you call me as if
there is something urgent?

1077
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,590
You know that I'm busy here
at the registration office, don't you?

1078
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,550
I'll kick your ass
once I get back to the village.

Did Gopal say anything?

1080

To hell with him!
There will be nothing important.

1081
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,460
He must have got some new film print.

is going to Guntur?

01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:48,550
Kondal Rao, don't you own some land
near Santha Magaluru?

1090
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,840
Yes, why?

1091
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,050
It's mentioned in the paper.

1092
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,050
Is it? What is the news?

1093
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,710
Looks like there is going to
be a highway coming there,

1094
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,630
which would increase the price
of it by ten times.

1095
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,380
-Is it?
-What are you saying?

1096
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,210
5 lakhs worth land
will now be worth 50 lakhs it seems.

01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,880
we shall talk to each other's parents
and get married.

1196
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,800
"All is well today"

1197
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,050
"Just like yesterday"

1198
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,880
"Will that be the case every day?"

1199
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,420
"Bad times will come,"

1200
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,590
"Bringing along difficulties"

1201
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,300
"Only then you can change for the better"

1202
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:33,340
"Will you cry when there are problems?"

1203
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,000
"Won't you start fighting them?"

1204
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,880
"Will you become hopeless
like a port without ships?"

1205
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,380
"Won't you see there is no
one who did not lose?"

1206
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,090
"Won't the time come for help?"

1207
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,170
Where did you get all these lice from?

1208
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,170
I sleep by your side every day.
I think you've passed them to me.

1209
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,170
Check this guy, dear.

1210
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:21,880
Who is he, father?
Why are you showing this?

1211
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,050
Give me the phone.

1212
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,710
He looks good like a statue.

1213
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,130
He is an assistant engineer
in our R and B Department.

1214
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,250
Even his father worked in my department
and got retired.

1215
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,920
Oh! Then they must have made good money.

1216
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,300
A couple of plots in Eluru Road
and a house in Bandar road. Well off!

1217
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,670
Father, why now?
I want to get a job.

1218
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,380
Job? Let's ask them.

1219
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,920
It would be better if they allow you
to work after the marriage.

1220
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,000
But... Father...

1221
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,130
The proposal came just now.
There would ample time in-between.

1222
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,090
Everything has to work out
for a marriage to happen, right?

1223
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,090
Sir, have some hot and tasty idli
at our hotel. Please, sir.

1224
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,250
-Please leave me. I had.
-Please, sir.

1225
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,500
-We've got Bombay chutney as well.
-I had breakfast.

1226
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,170
Sir, our hotel is very famous.

1227
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,170
-Please come to our hotel, sir.
-Where is the hotel here?

1228
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,210
Over there, sir.
Please come and have breakfast.

1229
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,460
I already had my breakfast.

1230
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,210
-You can manage a second breakfast, sir.
-Hey!

1231
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,170
-Shiva.-Sir.

1232
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,670
Is the name of our hotel
visible from a distance?

1233
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,840
I can only see "tre"
from "Raghava Tiffin Centre", sir.

1234
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,550
That's why nobody is coming here.

1235
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:28,920
Let's do something, sir.

1236
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,420
We shall cut down the tree.

1237
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,750
No. Go and stand over there.

1238
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:43,340
See now.
Do you see the name now, Shiva?

1239
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,670
What about now?

1240
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,050
I can't see anything, sir.

1241
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,420
Yeah! Now it's clearly visible, sir.

1242
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,710
Fool! Stand up and see properly!

1243
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,750
It's this branch.
Hacking it off will solve the problem.

1244
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,300
I'm coming down.

1245
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,920
This tree is irritating me, Sandhya.

1246
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,960
I'm only tolerating it
because of the shade it gives.

1247
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,130
Come and have a seat.

1248
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,670
Not a single soul is turning up.

1249
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,800
Will you have an egg dosa?

1250
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,130
-Master.
-Yes.

1251
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,170
My father brought a wedding match for me.

1252
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,000
Why is this all of a sudden?

1253
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:26,670
It's all because of that land you sold.

1254
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,710
Since its value
has increased exorbitantly,

1255
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,340
he wants to sell me off with that.

1256
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,550
Oh, no! Please don't remind me
of the land, Sandhya.

1257
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,550
What do you want to do now?

1258
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,340
I had decided on the very day of learning
the Bombay Chutney recipe from my mother

1259
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,750
to open up a hotel in Guntur
when I grow up.

1260
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:54,170
But I always had a fear of failing
by doing something I am passionate about.

1261
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:58,130
I overcame that fear because of you.

1262
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,380
Why are you surrendering now?

1263
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,880
Can't you tell your father
that you don't like that match?

1264
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:12,880
Why doesn't anyone ask me
what I like?

1265
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,670
You didn't care to ask me
before kissing me.

1266
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,130
And now, my father is doing the same.

1267
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,130
He doesn't talk to me properly
since then.

1268
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,550
He always looks at me as if I'm someone
who has made a mistake.

1269
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,840
It's because of me.

1270
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:35,050
[sniffles]

1271
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:45,250
Let bygones be bygones. We shall think
of what to do now, Sandhya.

1272
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,750
-Can I get some coffee?
-Okay.

1273
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:58,460
Father.

1274
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,670
The groom's parents called me.
They are coming to see you.

1275
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Fath...

1276
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,090
Get the phones
mentioned in this list, Krishna.

1277
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,920
I'll come by to pick them up later.

1278
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,460
Okay, Gopal. I'll get them.

1279
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:35,050
Gopal.

1280
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,250
-The thing is...
-I'm sorry. I like you.

1281
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,050
I wanted to come
and talk to your parents

1282
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,340
if our horoscopes matched.

1283
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,590
-But...
-Ah...

1284
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,960
Things won't work out between us.

1285
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:49,380
Forget it. So please don't
mind all this. Sorry.

1286
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,880
[sniffling]

1287
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,630
What happened? What did he say?

1288
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,460
Did he say he didn't like you?

1289
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,840
He said he doesn't like my date of birth.

1290
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,840
[shutter closes]

1291
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,800
Sir, what should I do
with the leftover idlis?

1292
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,710
Give the idlis away to someone.
Has the batter gone sour?

1293
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,090
-Yes.
-Throw it in some waste bin.

1294
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,460
We are throwing away
so much food everyday.

1295
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,130
God knows when will this hotel get better.

1296
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,920
[laughs]

1297
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,000
Idiot!

1298
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,670
-Have you gone mad?
-What should I do then?

1299
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,170
We are not even getting back our
maintenance money after all these days.

1300
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,710
The count of flies and mosquitoes in here
are more than the number of customers.

1301
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,050
Will you cut the tree for that?
Use your brain.

1302
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:55,920
When the business grows,

1303
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:57,500
we can put up some tables
in its shade.

1304
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:01,710
And what about all the things you said

1305
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,750
about overcoming anything
to make this a success?

1306
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,710
Where did it go?

1307
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,250
How can you not have patience?

1308
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,460
Did you expect people to throng
to your hotel upon setting it up here?

1309
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,300
First, think about how to draw people
to eat here.

1310
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,960
I had the same experience in
the initial days of my cell phone's store.

1311
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,630
Hey! Don't use that stupid cell phone shop
of yours as an example in every matter.

1312
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,250
Idiot! I am saying that for your own good.

1313
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,670
Patience is the key for the hotel
to progress. Wait for few more days.

1314
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,050
Of course, I will wait.
But my uncle wouldn't.

1315
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,590
She said that he's brought
a wedding match for her.

1316
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,460
I am scared.

1317
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:42,590
He will get her married
if we don't succeed soon.

1318
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,800
I must do something.

1319
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,090
Please have some coffee.

1320
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,420
She wants to work after marriage.

1321
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:14,460
No problem. That's not an issue.
Let her work until she has a kid.

1322
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,130
This is a very good match.

1323
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,840
The boy looks good.

1324
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,460
He's tall, handsome,
and holds a government job.

1325
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,300
Though she's been getting many matches,
this is the best one, sister.

1326
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,460
-Yes, he's a government employee as well.
-Father.

1327
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:31,500
Yes.

1328
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,090
Father, I want to talk to you
about something.

1329
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,210
I don't want to get into this marriage.

1330
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,590
Why? They have agreed
to let you work, right?

1331
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,420
I don't want to get married now, Father.

1332
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,250
Good matches don't come whenever we want.

1333
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,420
But, why do you say so?

1334
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:53,340
There should be some reason
for that, right?

1335
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,670
I asked you
before arranging all this, right?

1336
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,170
-Come on, answer.
-Huh?

1337
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,710
[gate creaks]
[sighs]

1338
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,550
[advertisement playing on TV]

1339
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,130
-Calm down. Listen to me. Don't shout.
-Don't support her.

1340
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:32,380
Don't we know what's good for her
as her parents?

1341
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,670
Should we ask for her permission?

1342
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,090
Won't you ask for my opinion
before marrying me off?

1343
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,550
Why is your voice raising?

1344
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:38,840
-I'll slap the hell out of you!
-Calm down!

1345
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,500
Yes, Father. Slap me!
Let's get it over with.

1346
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:42,670
He's speaking for your own good.

1347
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,250
You don't need to convince her.

1348
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,380
I've had enough, Mother.

1349
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,460
How many more days
will he vent out his anger at me?

1350
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,630
Doesn't he care for what I want?
Should I do everything as per his wish?

1351
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,880
Shut up, or I will beat you senseless.
How dare you!

1352
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,090
One plate onion dosa.

1353
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,750
Good morning, sir.
I will get your order ready.

1354
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,960
Meanwhile, have these "Chitti Garelu".

1355
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,050
What is this?

1356
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,170
-Bombay chutney, sir.
-Why?

1357
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,420
It's really good. It's free.

1358
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,340
Free? Why?

1359
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,840
It's a new variety, sir.
And our special dish.

1360
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,920
Just try it once.

1361
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,420
Master, an onion dosa.

1362
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,710
Okay.

1363
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,960
[sniffs]

1364
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,340
What's this? Don't you clean the place?
What is this disgusting smell?

1365
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,420
[sniffs]

1366
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,840
-Shiva.-Yes, sir.

1367
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,090
There is a dead rat.

1368
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,210
Dead rat? Master, there is a dead rat
over here. Check it.

1369
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,460
A rat? So much food is left over.
Rats are expected to come.

1370
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,880
I am looking for it.

1371
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,750
[phone ringing]

1372
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,300
-Yes, Sandhya. Yes.-"Bava",

1373
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,300
I have told my parents everything.

1374
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,250
What did you say?

1375
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,420
I told him that I would marry you.

1376
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,880
What? Why did you say that now?

1377
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,300
You were the one
who encouraged me to do that, right?

1378
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,170
Oh, man! You have put me
in a tight spot, Sandhya.

1379
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,710
I asked you to say no to that match,
but not to confess about us.

1380
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,920
I had to tell them someday.

1381
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,250
Come and speak to my parents.

1382
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,170
How can I come to your house
and ask them

1383
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:26,380
"Uncle, I've sold the land and
I've spent all that money on this hotel

1384
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:29,050
and now it is running in losses."

1385
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:30,380
"Kindly get your daughter married to me."

1386
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:32,460
"I'll make her grind the batter and take
good care of her." Should I say this?

1387
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,300
Are you backing off now,
after asking me to stay brave?

1388
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,500
That's not the point, Sandhya!

1389
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,840
-Please, Raghava...
-Hey! Who are you talking to?

1390
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,340
-Give me the phone.
-Father...

1391
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,750
[line beeping]

1392
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:48,880
[TV playing]

1393
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,880
Hey. Don't do this now.

1394
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,590
Your father is very angry
with Nageshwar Rao. Listen to me.

1395
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,380
-No, Mother. I'll tell him.
-No...

1396
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,590
[laughing]

1397
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,130
Father.

1398
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,250
Father, here...

1399
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,250
Have some water.

1400
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:19,340
[TV playing]

1401
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,670
-Father
-Yes.

1402
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,880
-I want to tell you something.
-Tell me.

1403
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,090
[TV playing]

1404
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,380
Will you switch off the TV?

1405
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,210
That won't be a problem. Tell me.

1406
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,710
No. Switch it off.

1407
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,960
Tell me.

1408
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:41,380
Don't get angry.

1409
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,460
You know our Nageshwar Rao Uncle, right?

1410
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,090
-So?
-You know his daughter Sandhya, right?

1411
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We've been in love with each other
for a long time.

1412
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,090
If you all agree to it,
we want to get married.

1413
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,420
This is the first wise decision
you have ever taken in your life!

1414
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,800
-Gopal, get on the bike.
-Yes, uncle.

1415
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,920
-Let's get going.
-Father...

1416
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,250
Father, where are you going?

1417
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,130
Is it Sunday today?

1418
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,130
Yes, it's Sunday.

1419
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,630
Where are you going?

1420
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:23,750
Father, where are you going?

1421
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,960
Why do you ask? I am going
to Nageshwar Rao's house.

1422
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,670
Ah! Why? I will come as well.

1423
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,840
No need for that.

1424
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,670
People will laugh if you come to talk
about your own marriage. Move aside.

1425
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,050
What if you make a scene over there?
I have to come.

1426
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:40,250
I know how to talk. You don't need to poke
your nose in adult matters. Move aside.

1427
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,750
Father, I have to come.

1428
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,380
Okay. But on one condition, that you have
to keep your mouth shut while I speak.

1429
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,750
Then get on the bike. Move aside.

1430
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,420
Okay.

1431
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:51,670
-Go on.
-Okay, uncle.

1432
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,130
-Drive.
-Hey!

1433
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,630
-Drive slowly. Don't hurry.
-Okay.

1434
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,710
-Gopal, drive safe.
-Sure, aunt.

1435
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:03,050
Did you bring them?

1436
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,710
Did you find anything
about the contractor?

1437
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,880
-Here, treat yourself.
-He has the support of some big wigs.

1438
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,210
I've met with Mallikarjun Rao once.
He is a nice guy.

1439
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,920
-Here, have them.
-No. Thank you, aunt.

1440
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,630
He used to be around my office
all the time.

1441
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:19,750
Umm... Sorry for what I said in the heat
of the moment the other day.

1442
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,800
Please don't mind. It was my mistake.

1443
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,670
Hmm. Sometimes things go wayward.

1444
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,500
It's alright.

1445
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:30,300
I will get to the point
without beating around the bush.

1446
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:33,000
I'm here to ask your daughter's hand
in marriage with my son.

1447
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:35,170
He said that both of them are in love
with each other.

1448
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,840
My daughter didn't even mention
about it at all.

1449
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,710
Girls are usually shy
in these matters.

1450
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,090
He told me everything.

1451
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:49,000
The thing is that she is getting matches
from big, wealthy families.

1452
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:51,380
Recently, we got
one such match from Vijayawada.

1453
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:55,090
The boy is an AE, an Assistant Engineer
in our R and B department.

1454
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,420
I've already said okay to that match.

1455
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,800
All that is left is saving the dates.

1456
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,670
[scoffs] I shouldn't really say this,

1457
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,800
but we've been witnessing
the last minute cancellation of weddings.

1458
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:06,500
Both of them love each other.
We should consider that as well, right?

1459
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:09,630
Brother-in-law,
please think from my perspective.

1460
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,670
On one hand, the AE guy,
the government job holder.

1461
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,340
On the other hand, there is this guy.

1462
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,710
Who would you prefer?

1463
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:19,050
To be frank,

1464
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,380
all the boys that you talk about
come for the dowry that you give.

1465
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,300
So, you don't want any dowry?

1466
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:28,420
Is it true, brother-in-law?

1467
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,130
Yes, uncle. I don't want
a single penny as dowry.

1468
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,630
All I want is Sandhya.

1469
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,460
Tell your father to say the same thing.
What do you say?

1470
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:43,170
This isn't the time or place
for such topics.

1471
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,590
I should not boast about my own son
but he's no less than anyone else.

1472
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,840
If his hotel makes a mark,
he will earn 1 lakh rupees per month.

1473
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,590
Yeah. We've been observing
how well his hotel is running.

1474
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,300
I pass by his hotel on my way
to the office every day.

1475
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,590
He got into the hotel business
instead of getting a proper job.

1476
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,250
He's just shooing flies over there.

1477
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,590
-In a business...
-Brother-in-law...

1478
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:04,920
We have fixed on that match.

1479
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,300
Please don't put us in a spot.

1480
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,170
But this isn't a decision
for us to make, Nageshwar Rao.

1481
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,000
We should consider
our children's consent as well, right?

1482
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,630
I think that's not something
you do in your home.

1483
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,500
We'll leave.

1484
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,590
I blame myself
for bringing you along.

1485
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,300
Why did you have to mention dowry?

1486
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,300
Unable to hold your horses, idiot!

1487
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,960
I brought along an idiot.

1488
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,420
What's wrong in what he said?

1489
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:45,340
I told you to shut up, didn't I?

1490
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,500
You childish moron!

1491
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,130
Who asked you to interfere
and say, "I don't want dowry"?

1492
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,960
Do you think I am an idiot
trying to convince him?

1493
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,920
That's why I told you not to tag along.

1494
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,550
Worthless bums!

1495
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,250
What's with this stink?

1496
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,920
Shiva! You couldn't even find a dead rat?

1497
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:07,920
Wastrel! I shouldn't have hired you!

1498
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,750
That's not the smell of a dead rat, sir.
Come here.

1499
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:12,500
Where are we going?

1500
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,590
Come over, sir.

1501
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:18,800
What's there?

1502
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,050
I'll show you, sir. Just come.

1503
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:27,170
Look over there.

1504
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,750
Where did this dump come from?
This wasn't there before.

1505
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,130
Sorry, sir. I was the one who started
dumping here because the place was empty.

1506
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,380
Now, the entire colony
has started using it.

1507
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,670
I didn't expect that this would become
such a big problem. I am sorry, sir.

1508
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,880
To hell with your apologies! Fool!

1509
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,090
-Hello! Is this the municipality?-Yes.

1510
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:07,090
There is an open garbage dump
in the third lane of Donka Road.

1511
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,590
What the hell are you doing?

1512
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:13,130
Bloody government job workers.
All flash, no substance!

1513
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:15,130
-Won't you check it?
-Will you get it cleaned or not?

1514
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,960
Hey! Why are you blabbering?

1515
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:20,750
You should request for our help.
Do you think we are your servants?

1516
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,460
Post your complaint
anywhere you like!

1517
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,800
Damn!

1518
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:31,500
Who would tolerate
if you vent your anger at them?

1519
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:32,670
Clean it yourself.

1520
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,670
What can be done? You opened up a hotel
in Guntur despite my objection.

1521
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,920
Let's go, Gopal.

1522
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,420
Yuck!

1523
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,130
DO NOT LITTER HERE

1524
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,170
[shutter opens]

1525
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:39,500
[gate creaks]

1526
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:14,210
Greetings, sir!

1527
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,460
I just wanted to talk about fixing
the wedding dates as it's been so long.

1528
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:22,750
Oh, no! What happened, sir?

1529
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:24,920
You agreed on the other day, didn't you?
What happened now?

1530
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:30,840
No, there must be some mistake.
I'll get back to you.

1531
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:36,670
Are you sure? Was he talking
about our land in Santha Magaluru?

1532
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:42,000
They said that the MLA of that place
has bought 50 acres of land over there.

1533
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:45,750
Now, he is shifting the highway plan
towards his land.

1534
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,170
There will be
an official notification soon, as well.

1535
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:53,880
-Does it mean that the match is gone now?
-Of course!

1536
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,420
They agreed for the marriage

1537
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:57,170
because of the land price,
not for our family.

1538
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,460
I think we have gone
a bit far out of greed.

1539
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,090
She too loves Raghava.

1540
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,920
He is a nice guy too.

1541
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,500
Let's fix on Kondal Rao's son.

1542
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,130
Kondal Rao will spit on my face.

1543
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,170
After all the things I have said,
how can I show my face to him?

1544
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,800
With this same face!

1545
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:18,130
You blabbered out of the pride
of having the land.

1546
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,170
There is nothing wrong
in accepting a mistake.

1547
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:22,550
[creaks]

1548
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,550
My father asked me to come urgently.
I wonder what mess he has made for me now.

1549
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,630
He must have brought you a match.

1550
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,880
Father...

1551
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:31,090
[people laughing]

1552
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:35,750
I'll soon transfer the land
into my daughter's name, brother-in-law.

1553
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,170
After the marriage,
it will be as good as yours.

1554
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,460
Forget about the land.
The marriage is more important.

1555
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:42,300
-We'll do just as you said.
-Ah! [laughs]

1556
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,050
Oh, you're here! Have a sweet.

1557
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,800
No. Thank you, uncle.

1558
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:52,670
I understand the fact that the kids
of this generation wouldn't listen to us.

1559
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,880
-Brother-in-law.
-Yes.

1560
01:35:55,710 --> 01:36:00,880
Well, what happened to that wealthy
AE match you were talking about?

1561
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,300
Let me tell you the truth.

1562
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,380
I don't want to get my daughter
married to him.

1563
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:11,130
I was looking forward for that AE match.

1564
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:17,050
My daughter's blind stubbornness
finally convinced me.

1565
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,210
-Isn't everything we do for their good?
-Leave me.

1566
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,050
You shouldn't do this
if you aren't entirely convinced, uncle.

1567
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:22,920
I was just saying that.

1568
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,550
That's not what you just said.
That's what you meant.

1569
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,500
Even the other day you said I am nobody
when compared to that AE.

1570
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:28,880
Oh, no! That's not my intention.

1571
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,300
Regardless of your intentions,
there is no need to rush for my marriage.

1572
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:34,710
I'll only marry when you have confidence
in me and my hotel.

1573
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,250
Let's not talk
about my marriage till then.

1574
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,960
He is hell bent on taking revenge on me.

1575
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,630
He always says or does the opposite of me.

1576
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,460
We must have been sworn enemies
in the previous life.

1577
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,340
Calm down.

1578
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:56,630
It was because of him that I went there
and became a fool

1579
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,210
by talking to them
about fixing the wedding, right?

1580
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,880
Does your brain stop
when you get enraged?

1581
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,250
Don't you have any control
on your mouth?

1582
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,380
Your wedding would have been fixed
if you had kept quiet for a minute!

1583
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,880
After I'd convinced my father
by putting lot of efforts,

1584
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,460
how could you break it off so easily?

1585
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:11,050
Your father spoke of me
as if I am a wastrel.

1586
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:12,750
How did you ever think
I would be okay with that?

1587
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,090
So what? Would it be the end of the world
if he spoke so?

1588
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,300
That's my nature, Sandhya.

1589
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:20,960
I won't bother anyone. And if someone
undermines me, I'll lose my control.

1590
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:21,960
I'm telling you.

1591
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,420
I'll lose my control
even if it is your father.

1592
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,550
How can you say that? What would you do
if he brings another match for me?

1593
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,460
There won't be such a scope.
That won't happen.

1594
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:29,670
What if it happens?

1595
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:31,130
I'll handle it if it goes that far.

1596
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:32,250
What will you handle?

1597
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,840
You have no answer to that.
That's why you are skipping that.

1598
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,920
What's with your torture!

1599
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,210
I'll marry you
only if the hotel flourishes,

1600
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,210
otherwise, I won't.

1601
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,800
I won't marry you even if
your hotel business becomes successful.

1602
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,670
Sandhya.

1603
01:37:57,550 --> 01:37:58,630
Sandhya. Wait a minute!

1604
01:37:58,670 --> 01:37:59,500
Sandhya...

1605
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,300
I'm sorry, Sandhya.
I shouldn't have said that.

1606
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,710
You've been seeing my situation, right?

1607
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,250
My problems start
from the time I wake up.

1608
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:09,050
On one hand, I am really confused
why this hotel is failing.

1609
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,170
On the other hand, this marriage tension
coupled with that garbage mess.

1610
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,550
At least, you should understand
and give me some time.

1611
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,420
I need some time for my hotel
and chutney to make a mark...

1612
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,960
Your chutney isn't that great, bava.

1613
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,550
I have eaten it, right?

1614
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:24,130
The chutney in the food cart at the corner
of our lane tastes better than yours.

1615
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:27,630
Your chutney alone is not enough
to make your hotel a success.

1616
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,050
Introspect it at the ground level.

1617
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:33,300
Stop building castles in the air.

1618
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,210
Hello. Yes.

1619
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:56,750
Come and take everything I have.
Why are you pestering me then?

1620
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,300
I told you I'll repay you

1621
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,840
once I get the chit fund amount
from Surendra, didn't I?

1622
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:01,500
Yes. Hang up!

1623
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:10,840
Ah! Hey!

1624
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:12,500
Hey, Mallikarjun Rao!

1625
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,000
Stop. Oh, Mallikarjun Rao!

1626
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:16,750
Mallikarjun Rao!
[splashes]

1627
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,130
[splashes]

1628
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,250
Hey!

1629
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:31,130
Did you find him?

1630
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,170
-Gopal.
-Yes.

1631
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:35,210
They were saying that your uncle
jumped into the canal.

1632
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:44,050
[panting]

1633
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:49,840
[people clamouring]

1634
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:53,250
Please, move aside. Move. Move.

1635
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,380
Careful now. Careful.

1636
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,800
Move aside. Move aside.

1637
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,340
Slowly. Slowly.

1638
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:25,840
Father... Father... Father...

1639
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,960
Father... Get up, Father.

1640
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:32,090
Father... Father...

1641
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:40,500
Father... Father...

1642
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:41,670
[crying]

1643
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:57,380
[sobbing]

1644
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:13,090
Mallikarjun Rao did a terrible thing.
He shouldn't have killed himself.

1645
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,590
We would have killed him with our words
if he had come back.

1646
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,460
This happened for his own good.

1647
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:21,300
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Gopal,

1648
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,630
you said he would become an MLA
and live for 80 years.

1649
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,380
But how did he kick the bucket
so soon?

1650
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:54,500
"It is good? Is it bad?
Or is it something in between?"

1651
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:59,670
"Or did I miss to assess the time?"

1652
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,550
"Is it a friend? Is it a foe?"

1653
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:05,090
"We never know what will it do to us?"

1654
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:10,380
"Didn't you assess its nature?"

1655
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,250
"The time that is leading you
in the thorny path"

1656
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:15,590
Hey, Gouthami, why don't you
get into the auto rickshaw once?

1657
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,800
"Won't it show the highway
if we wait patiently?"

1658
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:26,170
"The time is very clever
that throws difficult questions at us"

1659
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:30,300
"Won't it come back
with all the answers?"

1660
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,050
Place your finger on your cheek, madam.

1661
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,090
Pose with your fingers like this, madam.

1662
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:59,670
"When a smile flowers in the heart"

1663
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,800
"Won't it soothe us off the guilt?"

1664
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,420
"When the night's darkness
blinds our eyes"

1665
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:15,460
"Won't the light come
and show us the day?"

1666
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:20,590
"The future is not written
in our palm lines"

1667
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,000
"One should learn from the mistakes
of the past and forget it"

1668
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:31,800
"Don't look for divine intervention
to help you with your problem"

1669
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:36,630
"All these pains are nothing
but a passing cloud"

1670
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:42,500
"It will not last forever like the sky"

1671
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:47,710
"Courage is the only thing,
that should last"

1672
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,920
"Even in the face
of endless sufferings"

1673
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,590
Gouthami, I have to talk to you.

1674
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,460
Will you please come to the cloth store?

1675
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:07,340
I am talking to you. Will you please
come there? I need to talk to you.

1676
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,500
What do I seem to you? Do you think that
I will come wherever you want me to?

1677
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:20,550
"Life is like an ocean"

1678
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:25,710
"One should learn to swim across it"

1679
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:31,590
"There's is nothing wrong in falling down"

1680
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,800
-"We must try getting back on feet"
-Sir... Sir, please serve a dosa.

1681
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,840
"Regardless of whatever obstacles
that come in your path"

1682
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:47,170
"We should progress"

1683
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,880
"As if there is a day
when waves stop flowing"

1684
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:58,090
"Time will take off
our blindfolds one day"

1685
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:03,960
"And will show us the truth?"

1686
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:09,130
"And on that day,
all our illusions will disappear"

1687
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:13,880
"Even after our fall"

1688
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:18,550
Mother, does my chutney
really taste delicious?

1689
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,170
What happened all of a sudden?

1690
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,920
I don't know, Mother.
In fact, what father said is true.

1691
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,920
There are guys like me
in every lane over here.

1692
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:30,090
The chutney at the food cart
tastes better than mine.

1693
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,920
It's not even Bombay chutney.

1694
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:34,710
Forget all that.

1695
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,750
Be it a Bombay chutney
or some other chutney,

1696
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:40,130
it has to taste delicious
when it touches the tongue.

1697
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,210
That's important.

1698
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:46,380
When we put our heart in our work,
we'll know if it tastes good or not.

1699
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,170
Focus on your work
rather than seeking fame.

1700
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,300
Fame would come on its own
if the work is good.

1701
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,500
Don't overthink.

1702
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:01,420
Well... Do you want to visit here?

1703
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:06,420
No, Mother. I don't want to come home
until my hotel succeeds.

1704
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,130
His dilemma is all about that hotel.

1705
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,460
He became solitary.

1706
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,880
Where is he?

1707
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,210
He is inside.

1708
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:37,670
BOMBAY CHUTNEY IS FAMOUS HERE

1709
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:40,880
Hey!

1710
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:42,880
It says "famous'.

1711
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:50,300
[sniffles]

1712
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:02,840
Mother, have this.

1713
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,250
-Father, come here.
-No, I'm not hungry.

1714
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,960
-Stop that. You don't have to work.
-Hey.

1715
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:08,800
-Hey... Hey...
-Eat this first.

1716
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,630
He asks me to eat now. Wonder why!

1717
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:14,340
Eat now!

1718
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:00,550
Give that here.

1719
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:02,300
-Have a safe journey, Mother.
-Okay.

1720
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:03,920
Look...

1721
01:51:06,090 --> 01:51:08,630
Difficulties will come and go.

1722
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:11,460
We have to keep doing our work honestly.

1723
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:13,750
That's what is important.
What do you say?

1724
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,960
Your chutney tastes delicious as well.

1725
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:18,960
Work hard.

1726
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,380
Call us if you need anything.
Don't roam around unnecessarily.

1727
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,380
Keep eating on time!

1728
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,460
RAGHAVA TIFFIN

1729
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:30,170
It is 12 a.m., sir.

1730
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,920
This is the time
when police and ghosts roam around.

1731
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:35,880
Let's go home.
Can't we do this tomorrow?

1732
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,840
Just shut up and work.

1733
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:38,920
Simply blabbering!

1734
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,800
I'll ensure this problem
ends today!

1735
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,920
[shutter opens]

1736
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:46,550
[sniffs]

1737
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:48,750
[gate creaks]

1738
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,590
[phone rings]

1739
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,090
Hello.

1740
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:48,630
Yes... Yes.

1741
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:55,590
Sure. Definitely. Sure.

1742
01:53:55,750 --> 01:54:00,000
[phone ringing]

1743
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:04,300
That AE guy called me.
He wants to marry our daughter.

1744
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,300
Really?

1745
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,340
Yes. They are already on the way
to our home. Be ready.

1746
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,670
Okay.

1747
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:14,590
[phone ringing]

1748
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:18,340
Don't rush.
Sandhya likes Raghava, right?

1749
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,210
Who is bothered about who she likes?

1750
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,250
Didn't we go to Raghava's place to talk
about the wedding the other day?

1751
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:24,250
Wasn't the humiliation enough?

1752
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,420
-That's not the point...
-I have fixed on this wedding match.

1753
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:29,170
I am coming home. Let's handle it.

1754
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:33,800
Will you shove off every match
that comes my way in this manner?

1755
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,800
You'd give silly excuses
such as horoscope,

1756
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,500
caste and lineage didn't match,

1757
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:38,460
the girl's nose and jawline features
are not pleasant, etc.

1758
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:40,630
And if god-forbid everything works out,
you'd whine about dowry not being enough.

1759
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,460
-A marriage consists of all those aspects.
-Please don't talk.

1760
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:43,550
To hell with your snobbery!

1761
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,840
I like that girl
and will marry only her.

1762
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:50,710
Even her father is okay.
Please shut up while you're there.

1763
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,880
We should have started after

1764
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:53,380
the inauspicious time was over.

1765
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:55,920
Sorry, please look ahead. Look ahead.

1766
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:58,710
[phone ringing]

1767
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:00,590
Yes, Mr. Nageshwar Rao.

1768
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:02,170
-We've entered Guntur.
-Talk to him first.

1769
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,750
We'll be there within 15 minutes. Okay.

1770
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,300
Understand why we are explaining to you.

1771
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,630
-One shouldn't rush into these things.
-Yes, dear.

1772
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,880
I'm 30 now.
Don't I know the type of girl I want?

1773
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,170
Huh! Don't I know the type of girl I want?

1774
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:16,630
I have left that choice to you
as you are elders but...

1775
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,500
And you managed to louse it up
with your bloody traditions.

1776
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:19,710
[people clamouring]

1777
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,420
Hey, why aren't you picking up the phone?

1778
01:55:25,590 --> 01:55:27,130
Do you know how many times
I have tried calling you?

1779
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,250
Did they take away your phone again?

1780
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:33,300
I've been trying to tell you
the good news since two days.

1781
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,340
Why aren't you saying anything?

1782
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,590
What should I say?
There is nothing to talk with you.

1783
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,670
I know what you are going to say.

1784
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,960
Maybe the news is that your hotel is
finally doing well. That's it, right?

1785
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:45,500
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
How did you guess that?

1786
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:46,800
What would you say other than that?

1787
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,130
You just won't change.

1788
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:49,340
[people clamouring]

1789
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:52,590
Why are you so angry with me now? Huh?

1790
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,250
What's the price of ridge gourd?

1791
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,210
Sixty rupees per kg.

1792
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:58,340
I'll take 2 kg, make it 100..

1793
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:03,420
I'm talking about serious things here
and you are haggling for ridge gourds?

1794
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,250
At least this is something useful.
This is better work.

1795
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,960
Ms. Gouthami.

1796
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:12,000
Ms. Gouthami, please. I am sorry.
Can I speak to you for two minutes?

1797
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
-Gopal, what's this? Go away.
-Please. Hey.

1798
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,300
Ms. Gouthami, please. Just spare
two minutes. I won't waste your time.

1799
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:17,840
What will you say? Huh!

1800
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:21,420
I'd have understood if you had told me
that you didn't like me or my behaviour.

1801
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:24,210
But you said you didn't like
my date of birth. Is that in my hands?

1802
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:25,750
Isn't that humiliating me?

1803
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,420
What I did is wrong. I am an idiot.

1804
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:30,920
It took me this long to understand
that horoscopes are trash.

1805
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:32,590
Well, I've been roaming around you
since a long time, right?

1806
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,880
Don't you think
humans are prone to make mistakes?

1807
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,130
That is what makes us humans, right?

1808
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:38,380
No, no. I am sorry. I am sorry.
I'll come right to the point.

1809
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:41,590
I love you so much. And if you have
feelings for me, I'll marry you.

1810
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,130
I swear on my granny that I'll never think
of those bloody horoscopes again.

1811
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,420
I don't have patience
to hear this rambling.

1812
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:48,460
Come and talk with my family
if you have more to say.

1813
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:51,960
I've been begging you for so many days.
Why are so stubborn?

1814
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,300
Gopal, look at the note. The note!

1815
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:57,340
Note? What note?

1816
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,920
Yeah, she chucked something at me.
Must be the address.

1817
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:04,340
Damn! Where is it?

1818
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,880
Gouthami... Gouthami, wait a minute.

1819
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:12,750
Oh, man! How come she left so quickly?

1820
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,210
Have the sky inside your house.

1821
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,130
Buy one radium sticker for 70 rupees
and three for 200 rupees.

1822
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,090
There's a big discount on three pieces.
Come and buy away.

1823
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:21,960
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

1824
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:25,710
Sir. Sir. Sky in your home.
Will you buy some radium stickers?

1825
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,300
Well... Where's Kakumanivari Thota?

1826
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,500
Go straight and turn right.

1827
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,840
But that is left!

1828
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:35,500
Not left. You have to take a right.

1829
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:38,550
-Is it left or right?
-Damn! Just go straight and turn right.

1830
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,050
Damn!

1831
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:48,300
I am the tiger of the house. No one
crosses me in my house or in the town.

1832
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,670
I lay down the rules here.

1833
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:53,130
I'll personally preside
your wedding, son-in-law.

1834
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:55,170
And she's here just in time.

1835
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:56,170
Come, dear.

1836
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I keep mentioning an auto rickshaw driver,
Kotinagulu, right? This is him.

1837
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:01,960
That's his own auto rickshaw outside.

1838
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,960
He was given 10,000 rupees
by the government recently.

1839
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:07,500
He is pure gold.
He doesn't even want dowry.

1840
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:11,710
He will take care of both our needs.

1841
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,710
She left because she's shy.

1842
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:16,630
She is coming. She is here. Dear...

1843
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,710
-Get up.
-Hey!

1844
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,590
Get out of here. Get out!

1845
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:22,170
Why did you do that?

1846
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,960
-Now don't get angry. I'll talk to her.
-Damn you!

1847
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,130
Son-in-law...
Why did you hit that poor boy?

1848
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,170
Son-in-law... Stop, I'm coming.

1849
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,050
Bloody shrew! I'll take you to task
when I get back.

1850
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:36,670
Son-in-law... Stop. Oh, my booze supplier!
I'll preside your wedding!

1851
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:39,340
-Bloody oldie! Bugger off!
-Idiot! Let me get in.

1852
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:41,710
-Why did you get in? Get down.
-Hold on... Hold on...

1853
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:44,210
Your daughter is so proud!

1854
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:47,380
How dare she hit me with
a bathroom cleaning broom! Bloody vixen!

1855
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:50,250
Hey! You can chide me and I'll bear it.

1856
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,750
But I'll not spare you
if you call her names. She's gold.

1857
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,840
You fool! I neither want your daughter
nor her gold. Just give me my money back.

1858
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,090
-Money?
-Ah!

1859
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:01,130
-What money?
-How can you say that?

1860
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:03,800
Hey! Didn't I loan you Rs. 20,000?

1861
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:07,130
When did you loan me Rs. 20,000?
When did you do that?

1862
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,500
Hey, oldie, don't act smart.
I won't spare you!

1863
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:13,880
Hey! I can't get anyone
to give me free liquor

1864
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:17,550
and you're saying that you
loaned me money. Where's the proof?

1865
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:19,710
Hey, oldie, I'll really kill you
if you don't stop lying.

1866
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:24,380
Kill me? How dare you! Stop the damn
auto rickshaw right now, you idiot!

1867
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,590
-I'm on it, you idiot!
-Come on, pull over!

1868
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,710
-Wait!
-Stop it. What do you think of my rep?

1869
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:30,420
Just stop! Let's start the fight.
Come on.

1870
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:33,340
How dare you lie about not taking money!
I'll kill you, old fool!

1871
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:36,460
I'd rather die than lie.

1872
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:37,960
[horns blaring]
I'll kill you, oldie!

1873
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:42,710
Kill me? Cross this line if you dare?
I dare you, dimwit!

1874
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,840
I'll trample you under my auto rickshaw
for real! It's not funny!

1875
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,170
Do it. Come on, do it.
I dare you to do it!

1876
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:51,840
-Hey oldie! Get up. Get off the road.
-No one can take me away!

1877
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:54,380
I've dealt with worse idiots
than you in my life.

1878
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:55,380
-Get up.
-Hey!

1879
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:58,130
What's this nuisance in the middle
of the road? Take your vehicle away!

1880
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:02,590
Move the vehicle.
Come on. Go away. Now. Do it.

1881
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:03,960
Get into the vehicle.

1882
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:06,460
Leave. Leave.
Or he will kick you as well.

1883
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,880
-Hey...
-Stop the auto rickshaw.

1884
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:16,840
Hey, the old bastard is acting smart
instead of repaying my money.

1885
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:17,840
Where are you guys?

1886
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,750
-Hey... Stop the auto rickshaw.
-Stop the auto rickshaw.

1887
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:26,340
Look, it's urgent.
Drop us at Kakumanu Vari Thota. Please.

1888
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,710
-No, I won't come.
-Please understand.

1889
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,420
Our car broke down. It's urgent.

1890
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:30,710
-It'll cost you Rs. 1,000.
-What?

1891
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:32,920
A thousand's fine. A thousand's fine.
A thousand's fine.

1892
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:34,090
A thousand's too much.

1893
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,630
How can you demand so much?
Make it Rs. 500.

1894
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,420
Stop it and get in.

1895
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,340
[tyres screech]

1896
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:45,880
He promised me to get his daughter married
to me in return to the money I gave him.

1897
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,710
Now, he has insulted me
by calling to his house.

1898
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,840
-Go slow.
-Wastrel!

1899
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,130
Go slow. It's okay if we're late.

1900
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:52,590
All we need is to reach
the destination safely.

1901
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,210
Oh! Slow down!

1902
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,170
Whoa! Slow down and drive carefully.

1903
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,000
You are riding on the wrong side. If we
get caught, it'll delay us an hour more.

1904
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:02,250
Are you new to Guntur?
Nobody dares to stop me here.

1905
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,420
-Look out!
-Hey...

1906
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,920
You idiot! You've dented my vehicle!

1907
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,840
Why are you kicking my vehicle?
Are you crazy?

1908
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:11,920
Are you blind that you couldn't see
a vehicle coming?

1909
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,630
Don't you know you have to drive safe
at the turns?

1910
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:14,590
It is a brand new auto rickshaw.

1911
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,960
Why are you blaming me when it is you
who came in the wrong lane? You prick!

1912
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:19,340
-How dare you curse me!
-Of course, I'll curse you!

1913
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,710
I will beat you black and blue.

1914
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,340
What the hell are you talking!

1915
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:26,590
[tinnitus]
Hey drive, just drive and drop us.

1916
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,670
Forget it and drop us.

1917
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:29,170
Sandhya. This is serious.

1918
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:31,090
Everyone has flaws.

1919
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,130
Even I have flaws.

1920
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:36,750
Love is accepting
each other's flaws, isn't it?

1921
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:39,920
And it's not like I've not changed.
I am gradually changing.

1922
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:41,710
-How can I change instantly?
-Will you stop?

1923
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,800
I've been expecting you to change
your behaviour since college days.

1924
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:46,300
Though other things changed,
your obstinacy is still intact.

1925
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,250
Will you come with me for a while.

1926
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:48,460
I've got to talk to you calmly
for a moment.

1927
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,710
[phone ringing]
I've got to go home.

1928
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,550
What's it?

1929
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,300
Raghava, someone has beaten me.
I'm bleeding.

1930
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:58,710
What! Is it? Where are you?

1931
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:00,340
In front of Vignan Mandir gate.

1932
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,500
Wait right there. I'm coming.
I'm at the market.

1933
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:04,550
The market? I'm coming.

1934
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:06,670
I'm coming to the Naaz centre.
Come to that place.

1935
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:08,090
Let's take them to task!

1936
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:15,420
Gopal, you said you were bleeding.
Who's the rascal?

1937
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:16,590
He hit me and went that way.

1938
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:17,500
Curse him!

1939
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,800
Let's go.

1940
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:27,500
Hey, that's him.

1941
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,130
There are so many auto rickshaws here.
Which one?

1942
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:32,590
Look, the one with
the Pawan Kalyan's sticker.

1943
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:33,840
He's the one. Keep going.

1944
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,710
Hey... Keep going.

1945
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,670
[honking]
Keep going faster.

1946
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:42,250
Hey... Don't forget.
Bring Malli and Soori along with you.

1947
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:45,050
To hell with his shenanigans!
He's not even considering our safety.

1948
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,300
Hey!

1949
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,670
Son, are we really going for matchmaking
or anywhere else?

1950
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:04,460
-Hey, stop the vehicle!
-Hey! Rascal!

1951
02:03:04,630 --> 02:03:07,340
I've lent him money so that
he'd get his daughter married to me.

1952
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:11,710
Son, our car broke down
and this scoundrel did an accident.

1953
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:15,250
Listen to me. Things won't work out
if we start in inauspicious time.

1954
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:18,210
-Stop! Stop, you rascal!
-Hey! Go! Go!

1955
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,420
-Stop it. Stop the vehicle, rascal!
-Stop the vehicle, scoundrel!

1956
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:23,090
Stop!

1957
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,590
-Was it him who hit you?
-Yes. That's him.

1958
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,630
Get down, rascal!

1959
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,000
He said that you came in the wrong route
and hit him as well.

1960
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:31,710
Hey, stay there! I didn't drive
in the wrong route, he did.

1961
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,670
Don't act smart!

1962
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,340
-He's lying.
-Catch him!

1963
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:36,550
-Stay here.
-Hey!

1964
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,170
-Stop, you rascal!
-He came to this side.

1965
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:41,880
-Hey! Please don't do that.
-Where are you running away?

1966
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:43,420
We're getting late.
Don't get into a brawl.

1967
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:44,380
What's with you?

1968
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:46,750
Hey! Do you think bringing in a friend
would scare me?

1969
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:49,880
I too have friends. I can get ten guys
with a single phone call.

1970
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:53,090
Is that so? Call them. Call them.

1971
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:54,130
Please don't quarrel. Please.

1972
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:55,090
-Move aside
-Please don't fight.

1973
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:56,920
Rascal, come and face me!

1974
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:59,630
-Come on, show your worth!
-I'll show it for sure.

1975
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:01,630
You were boasting about you.
What happened now?

1976
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:04,800
-Hey! Who the hell are you?
-Ah!

1977
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:09,380
Oh, my God!

1978
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,460
Take your hands off me, I am warning you!

1979
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:21,550
-What the hell are you blabbering?
-Stop it, bava!

1980
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:22,920
Will you hit him just for coming
to matchmaking?

1981
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:25,880
What do you mean by matchmaking?

1982
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:28,460
Aren't you

1983
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:30,960
Mr. Nageshwar Rao's daughter,
Sandhya?

1984
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:34,130
Yes.

1985
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:49,380
They are here.

1986
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:50,710
Did they arrive?

1987
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,550
[gate creaks]

1988
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:03,750
[clears throat] Uncle, please don't mind
my words I said the other day.

1989
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,960
I heard that there are auspicious days
for marriage in the month of December.

1990
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,300
Let's meet on an auspicious day
and fix a date.

1991
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:20,210
Hey Gopal, here.

1992
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:22,380
Give this to Uncle Seenu.

1993
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:23,380
-Okay, Mother.
-Okay, mother-in-law

1994
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,380
Ride safe.

1995
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:26,880
-See you, uncle.
-Ride safe, son-in-law.

1996
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:28,500
-I'll drop them, uncle.
-See you, father.

1997
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:29,960
-Take good care of son-in-law.
-Bye.

1998
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:31,210
-Bye.
-Bye.

1999
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:33,300
-See you, Father.
-Bye, dear.

2000
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:35,750
[phone chimes]

2001
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:43,170
Bloody misleading messages!

2002
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,380
-Mr. Murthy.
-Yes.

2003
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:46,960
Stop reading the newspaper for a while.

2004
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,670
I got the same damn message again.

2005
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:52,920
Will the news change
if I stop reading, Kondal Rao?

2006
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:54,050
Come on.

2007
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,550
Kondal Rao, there is news about
highway construction at Santha Magaluru.

2008
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:59,880
Is it? Give it here.

2009
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:05,880
-Do you know what happened?
-What does it mean ultimately?

2010
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,920
The MLA bought
a piece of land over there.

2011
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:08,800
Hmm...

2012
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:09,920
He has changed the original
highway construction plan.

2013
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,800
Hmm...

2014
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,300
That news got leaked to media.
When it became a big mess,

2015
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,130
they have said there is no change
in the original plan.

2016
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:18,170
They would construct the road as per that.
And that is what the article states.

2017
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:21,170
Does that mean our land rate still
has a good value in the market or not?

2018
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:22,050
Of course, it still has
a good market value.

2019
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:23,420
Don't you have any other topic
other than hanging around that?

2020
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:26,840
Thank God! Consider my bad times
have gone, brother-in-law.

2021
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,710
-My daughter has brought us luck.
-Yes.

2022
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:31,050
For a moment, my heart skipped a beat
over that news.

2023
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:42,840
What was your order?
Bondas? There are no bondas left.

2024
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Do you want green tea?

2025
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,590
Here, keep it inside.

2026
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:55,210
We are pleased with your hospitality.

2027
02:06:55,710 --> 02:07:00,880
Well, we are here to ask for your
daughter's hand in marriage with Gopal.

2028
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:05,920
What you are saying is good.
But we aren't from the same caste.

2029
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:09,920
We don't practice
inter-caste marriage in our clan.

2030
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:12,090
Moreover, our family has got
big reputation and honour.

2031
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:13,590
-Reputation?-Why are you pinching me?

2032
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:15,050
I stated the fact, right?

2033
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,920
Why are you staring at each other?

2034
02:07:17,090 --> 02:07:18,750
Did you guys get my point?

2035
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,590
-What? Where are you taking me?
-Let's go!

2036
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,460
Are you going to immerse me in water
like the Lord Ganesha's idol?

2037
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:24,380
Bava...

2038
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:25,630
I'll give everyone their money.
Everyone will get their money.

2039
02:07:25,630 --> 02:07:27,500
-Where's Anjaiah? Anjaiah...
-Sir.

2040
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:30,170
Anjaiah. Here's the money
I owed you.

2041
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:31,840
Apologies for being late.
Please don't mind.

2042
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,880
No problem, sir.

2043
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:34,090
[clamouring]

2044
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:37,710
The contractor was nabbed
by the police recently, right?

2045
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:40,050
Everyone will get their money
once the case gets settled.

2046
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,880
I'm assuring you
that I'll give your money.

2047
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,630
I'll give the money.
Everyone will get what they're owed.

2048
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,590
Thank God!

2049
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,960
Okay. I'm assuring
that I'll give your money.

2050
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,300
Sir!

2051
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:52,250
Surendra returned my money!

2052
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:53,500
So quick?

2053
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:55,800
He called me to his home
and gave it in front of everyone.

2054
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:57,960
Here, have your money.

2055
02:07:58,130 --> 02:07:59,840
-See you.
-Sure. Take care.

2056
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:08,920
-Go and ask them. Let's see.
-Give me two packets.

2057
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,210
How much?

2058
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,090
-Do you have change for Rs. 2,000?
-Brother,

2059
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:15,710
is there a good hotel nearby?

2060
02:08:16,210 --> 02:08:20,090
Brother, don't try here. Go straight
and you'll reach Donka Road.

2061
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:23,750
You'll find a big mango tree
at the end of the third lane.

2062
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,340
There is a hotel behind the tree
which is unnoticeable.

2063
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,300
"Raghava Tiffin centre" is the name.
Eat over there.

2064
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:29,590
Well, the Bombay chutney tastes delicious
in that hotel. Try that.

2065
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:32,710
Hey, dude! They are indeed talking
about your hotel.

2066
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:34,710
That's obvious! Get on the bike!

2067
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:48,050
-Hey, master.
-Greetings, sir.

2068
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:48,960
Greetings.

2069
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:52,380
I have ordered poori a long back.
Please bring it.

2070
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,920
Hey, come here.

2071
02:08:56,630 --> 02:08:57,960
Seems like someone is competing
against you.

2072
02:08:58,960 --> 02:08:59,800
Let him compete.

2073
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:02,340
There's no one who can make a chutney
that beats the taste of mine.

2074
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:05,170
-Shiva, get me two bondas
-Okay, sir.

2075
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,300
NEW RAGHAVA TIFFIN CENTRE

2076
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,460
Hey! Who the hell is that?

2077
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,300
-Copycat, rascals!
-Who the hell stole the name of our hotel?

2078
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:15,380
Copycat, rascals! I dare you to come out!

2079
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:16,550
Hey!
