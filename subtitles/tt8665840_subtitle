1
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,291
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

2
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:07,250
- Good morning!
- Good morning! -Morning!

3
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,416
Are you just going to sit there?

4
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,874
What do you want me to do?
Perform? Who's going to listen to us?

5
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,208
Exactly! It's too early in the morning...

6
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,333
Everyone is busy trying to get to work.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,416
But it's possible you know...

8
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,291
Today might turn out to be different.

9
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,332
There's still a debate if the Earth is
turning... And here the day will turn?

10
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,082
Think about the poor guy
stuck in the rush hour traffic.

11
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:29,875
What guy?

12
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:32,125
He probably had to skip breakfast.

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,583
Or a mom who is worried
if her son reached school on time.

14
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,749
Or maybe some young dude
whose wife is pregnant...

15
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,332
Who has checked his sales report
but forgot the pregnancy report.

16
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,333
Good for him.

17
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,457
But everyone keeps moving forward, right?

18
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,125
Yeah.

19
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:50,582
- What is driving them on?
- What?

20
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,375
- What?
- What?

21
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,792
The hope that everything
will be alright one day.

22
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,208
We can't give up this easily.

23
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,458
Come on, guys.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,250
Seriously?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,541
- Let's do this!
- Okay.

26
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,375
- Okay, let's do it!
- Yes!

27
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:46,207
Cross the mountains of sleep
And touch the morning sky

28
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,832
This painted city of cards
Breaks up this game

29
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:56,457
Oh World! Oh World!

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:01,749
The kite is clear when the sky is cloudy

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,457
The lonely pain is buried deep in the heart

32
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:12,082
Oh World! Oh World!

33
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:17,541
In this city, the moon flies like the kite

34
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:22,749
We are all alone in this life

35
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,957
But the sun still shines on the weak

36
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:35,958
Where are you?
Life is looking for you

37
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:04,457
One day, you will be right
And this city will be wrong

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:09,082
You'll find courage from the clouds,
rain and sunshine

39
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:14,832
Oh World! Oh World!

40
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:19,916
Sometimes you'll lose your way

41
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:24,749
You are all I ever have

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,416
Oh World! Oh World!

43
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:35,791
In this city, the moon flies like the kite

44
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:40,957
We are all alone in this life

45
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:46,249
But the sun still shines on the weak

46
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,250
Where are you?
Life is looking for you

47
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,207
Wake up.

48
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,583
Eat something.

49
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,083
- What are you doing here?
- What else could I do?

50
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,667
Did you tell me you're not coming home
last night?

51
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,041
I didn't want you to work
on an empty stomach.

52
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,624
So, I got you some food.

53
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,667
Please, have your dinner now...

54
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,541
Oh my sweet Archie!

55
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,582
How long are you
going to do this for me?

56
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,250
Have you forgotten our deal?

57
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,708
What deal?

58
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,791
What if I ditch you at the last moment?

59
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,292
What if I don't marry you?
What will you do?

60
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,249
Even if you don't want it...

61
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,542
we're already married according
to the Gandharva tradition.

62
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,708
Oh no!

63
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,041
The bride and the groom
make promises during the wedding.

64
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,416
What have you promised?

65
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:48,874
I promise to work hard
and pay all the bills on time.

66
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,875
Great!

67
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,167
And I'll cook delicious meals for you.
Deal?

68
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,250
Deal.

69
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,541
This "bhetki" fish in banana leaf
is unbelievable!

70
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,792
That's hilsa and it's steamed.

71
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,208
Sorry.

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,082
These all-nighters are driving me crazy.

73
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,457
I'm going to be on a new assignment.

74
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,125
I've no idea how I'm going
to manage everything.

75
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,125
There's too much pressure.

76
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,207
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.
I'm here if you need me.

77
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,791
I'll always make sure you're well fed.

78
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:33,291
How long will this go on, Archie?

79
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:36,042
- Mom called.
- Whose mom?

80
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,708
- My mom.
- What did she say?

81
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,832
She didn't see your photos
in the newspaper?

82
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,083
Not funny, Archie.

83
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,082
Our families have spoken.

84
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,666
They want us to get married.

85
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,167
It's not just them.
I want it too.

86
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,332
You don't think I want it?

87
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,958
A girl doesn't want to be
in a live in relationship all her life.

88
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,707
That's what I thought.

89
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,667
That's why I've never forced you.

90
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,083
But I think I've to force you now.

91
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,207
Give me some time, Archie.

92
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,541
Just to be mentally prepared.

93
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,082
Please tell my parents that tonight.

94
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,082
They have some expectations too.

95
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,207
Wait a minute...
What's today?

96
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,249
Great! You don't remember?

97
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,832
It's my parents' 40th anniversary.

98
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,167
You're supposed to get the cake.

99
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,582
- Please do something...
- Okay, don't worry.

100
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,749
I'll bake the cake
but please be on time.

101
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,624
Definitely! I'm setting
a reminder right now.

102
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,417
9 o'clock, right?
I won't even be 5 minutes late.

103
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,666
My parents want to announce
our wedding at the party.

104
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,832
You've missed twice before.

105
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,874
If you miss it today,
consider our "divorce" final.

106
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,917
Will you force me like this, Archie?

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,791
Will you put psychological pressure
on me?

108
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,958
I'm not putting
any pressure on you, Ira.

109
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:05,125
I'm just asking you to prioritise.
Either it's your work or it's me.

110
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,749
It's been three years.

111
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,999
Can't you take a decision?

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,874
I moved in with you.

113
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,582
And I want to get married too.

114
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,167
But not in a rush, Archie.

115
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,167
You had decided to leave home
in rush.

116
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,749
You didn't think twice
about moving in with me...

117
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,917
What about my office?

118
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,333
Deadlines?

119
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,957
How will I manage these, tell me?

120
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,083
The way you manage me,
manage your office like that for a day.

121
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:39,292
And your life's deadline
is 9 o'clock tonight.

122
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,833
Now the choice is yours.

123
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,583
Bye.

124
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,583
Archie...

125
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,417
- Archie, all well?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,124
What's wrong, Ira?

127
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,500
Looks like the sky
is falling down on you.

128
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,291
Sir, I want to take off early today.

129
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,750
Why?

130
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,166
Otherwise, I won't have a relationship
to go back to.

131
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,874
Really? Then you must go...

132
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,541
You should leave right now.

133
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,958
Actually, you need to get out of the office
right now.

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,582
What do you mean?

135
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,999
You've to start work
on the new assignment.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,999
"Women in new age Kolkata."

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,166
Start looking for women all over Kolkata.
Got it?

138
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,375
Mind it. It's all about
new age Kolkata women.

139
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,583
Powerful, successful... Single.

140
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,124
Plus-sized, zero-figure...

141
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,666
Wedding-crazy woman like you...

142
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:46,042
I want different kinds of women
for this story.

143
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,458
Then we can start with Ms. Sen, sir!

144
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,583
The Ms. Sen?

145
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,875
Best of luck!

146
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,083
- May I come in?
- No.

147
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,625
What are you doing here?

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,708
- Didn't you get your money?
- Yes, I did.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,374
It was credited to my account
by the 5th of the month.

150
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,375
Then?

151
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,916
It's not actually about money.

152
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,542
It's about Titir.

153
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,958
What's wrong with Titir?

154
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,208
She has fever.

155
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,874
The doctor said it's typhoid.

156
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,707
A change might be...

157
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,083
Yeah, you should go.

158
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,708
Where does she want to go?

159
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,999
Arrangements need to be made
for Titir to travel.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,957
Take her wherever she wants to go.

161
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,332
Don't involve me.

162
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,208
Ask Mr. Das to make
all the arrangements.

163
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,250
Fine.

164
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,250
Listen.

165
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,292
Doesn't Titir want to meet her mom ever?

166
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,958
She knows her mom has drifted away
from her.

167
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,167
Even if she tries...

168
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,375
she knows she can't be with her mom.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,875
Yes, Mr. Das?

170
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,083
Hello, madam.

171
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,000
I got to know something...

172
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,917
that's why I had to call you.

173
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,957
Vivel is asking other agencies
to submit designs.

174
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,125
So what?

175
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,124
We've worked with them for so long.
This time won't be any different.

176
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,708
Madam, it won't be that easy this time.

177
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,417
We must get this project
if we want that bank loan.

178
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,708
Or else, we won't be able to
save the company.

179
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:56,583
No one tells Ms. Sen
what to do in life.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,375
She'll find a way.

181
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,750
Don't worry.
That's my job.

182
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,042
One more thing...

183
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,042
Siddharth might call you...

184
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,250
Give him whatever he needs.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,875
I have an appointment.
Please let me in.

186
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,083
Without madam's instruction,
I can't allow anyone in.

187
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,707
I'm press.

188
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,958
Don't you understand Bengali?

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,624
I don't care if you are.

190
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,417
- What's your problem...
- What is it, Laxman?

191
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,624
Madam, she is forcing her way in.

192
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,416
- What are you doing?
- Ma'am... Ma'am...

193
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,749
I'm from Morning Kolkata.

194
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,332
I need a photo and a quote from you.

195
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,582
I'm sorry, I can't right now...

196
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,749
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
my deadline is today.

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,708
You'll really like the story.

198
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,249
It's about women in new age Kolkata.

199
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,624
And right now, you're the most successful
Bengali woman.

200
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,792
So what?

201
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,167
I've to leave.
Step aside.

202
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,000
B****!

203
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,667
Want advice for Bengali women?

204
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,417
Listen carefully.

205
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:11,125
In this dog eat dog world,
you have to be a b****!

206
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:28,499
She's my little sister...

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
My lovely little baby sister...

208
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,291
Archie, don't irritate me.

209
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,541
I'm writing something important...

210
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,166
Tell me if it's urgent.

211
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,249
You should come out of your blog's
virtual world sometimes...

212
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,666
and experience reality.
You'll feel better.

213
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,208
Listen...

214
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,583
You're just a year
older than me, okay?

215
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,833
Don't want your wisdom.

216
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,292
I'm very happy writing my blog.

217
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,999
And for your kind information...

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,791
the outside world is equally
busy staring at the cyber world.

219
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,124
Get it?
Now tell me why you called?

220
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,291
I hope you haven't forgotten
that it's Mom and Dad's anniversary.

221
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,375
No, I didn't.

222
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,750
All plans set.

223
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,249
I've taken care of everything.

224
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,041
And now you can take credit.

225
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,666
Don't call them too much.

226
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,749
It'll ruin the surprise.

227
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,667
Please... Why would I do that?

228
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,291
You're more prone to that.

229
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,292
You've a really loose tongue.

230
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,874
Packing done?

231
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,375
Yes, flight's at 9 o'clock in the morning.

232
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,458
Ready to leave.

233
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,042
Will you like Bangalore
better than Kolkata?

234
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,957
I'm sure you'll call me constantly
because you'll get bored.

235
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,708
Bangalore or Kolkata...

236
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,167
It'll always be me and my laptop.

237
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,417
You know, Archie...

238
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,166
It's very difficult to find a real friend
in this cyber age.

239
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:33,917
If you want...

240
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,374
a friend, you've to meet people...

241
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,333
Not virtually but in real life.

242
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,625
When you're single, be ready to mingle.

243
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,541
Okay, Mr. Know-it-all.

244
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,708
I've to get back to work.

245
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,957
I'll see you tonight.

246
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:44,625
Bye.

247
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:45,708
Okay, bye.

248
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,042
Am I really cut out for your article?

249
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,457
Most people see me more as a man.

250
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,417
Exactly, ma'am. That's the story.

251
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,499
A woman in a man's world...

252
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,166
is fighting alone
at the peak of success.

253
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,667
How does that make you feel?

254
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,500
It's scary sometimes.

255
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,417
Sucess, power...

256
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,917
is all good for newspaper articles...

257
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:23,375
But in life there's something
more important than success.

258
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,208
Someone who stands by you...

259
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,875
It gets very lonely.

260
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:34,333
So you never had anyone
to share this journey with you?

261
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:39,875
Can you tell the people you work with
that you're hungry?

262
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,542
Can you rest your head on their shoulder
and rest for a bit?

263
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,417
Can you share an icecream with them?

264
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,375
You can't.

265
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,083
Ma'am, what you're saying is...

266
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,708
one has to be in love.

267
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,875
You've no idea about love,
thanks to your deadlines.

268
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,624
Why don't you write an article
on yourself?

269
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,083
You're successful too.

270
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,874
Not really.

271
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,792
People don't want to read about us,
they want to know about you.

272
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,083
And what about those ordinary women?

273
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,749
Moms who wait outside the school
after dropping their kids.

274
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,458
Women who cook for their families.

275
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,000
Women who'd do anything
to see their husband smile.

276
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,167
Don't you want to write about them?

277
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,667
Oh, no!

278
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,749
- What happened?
- Nothing, Mother.

279
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,916
What do you mean?
I heard something...

280
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,124
I dropped the spatula.

281
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,291
Why can't you be more careful?

282
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,499
Why are you coughing on the food?
Move away.

283
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,791
Look at the mess here...

284
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:01,332
I wonder what your mother
has taught you?

285
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,667
Just get out of here.

286
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,958
You haven't taken your medicine yet?

287
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,582
The doctor has asked you to have it
on time.

288
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,042
What's the point?

289
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,417
We'll have a baby sooner?

290
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,249
Why don't you fix your cough first?

291
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,958
You're coughing all day...

292
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,083
Sister-in-law, Mom is calling you.

293
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,958
Coming...

294
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,917
- Here...
- Damn it!

295
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,792
What's the point in giving
my brother the meds?

296
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,667
I can give you what you want.

297
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,917
It'll all stay within the family.

298
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,875
Think about it.

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,458
Check this babe out, buddy.

300
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,542
I have a working daughter...

301
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,208
She works so hard
that there's no food in the house.

302
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,250
The landlord comes twice everyday
for the unpaid rent.

303
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,832
How many times have I told you?

304
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,083
Please get married to a nice man.

305
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,416
We could have lived comfortably.

306
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,375
Just before I leave for shoot...

307
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,042
you have to talk about these things.

308
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,957
What's the point of these shoots?

309
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,750
We have to look for you in the crowd.

310
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,874
I've never seen you on TV.

311
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,791
And no one believes me
when I tell them.

312
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,957
It would have been better
if you had a regular job.

313
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,042
Mom, I don't want a job.

314
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,750
I love what I do.

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,207
That's why I know...

316
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,333
If not today,
I'll get my chance tomorrow.

317
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,249
There goes my queen to the battle.

318
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,666
And I have to handle everything here
by myself.

319
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,624
Your only sick brother...

320
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,374
Your old mother will
take care of him too...

321
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,375
Why?

322
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,125
Suzy will be here.

323
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,833
She'll look after him.

324
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,500
Watch your step.
Be careful.

325
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,059
- Have you taken your homework?
- Hey, sexy!

326
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,124
Stop being a tease.

327
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,624
Give us a chance please.

328
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,292
Hey, you buggers!

329
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,083
Stay away from her.

330
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,250
Listen, Suzy baby.

331
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,167
Don't stay here alone with your kid.

332
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,583
Your husband is not around, right?

333
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,667
These people will make your life
a living hell.

334
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,833
Be on your way now.

335
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,542
God bless.

336
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,542
What?

337
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,125
Your cake is ready.

338
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,875
Good news.

339
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,500
Sounds like you're about to give me
some bad news.

340
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,832
Not at all.

341
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,250
Only three more stories to go.

342
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,083
And then I'll be done.

343
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,666
Will you be done by 8 o'clock?

344
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,042
Of course, I'll be...

345
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,166
I've got it! Got it! Got it!

346
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,707
What?!

347
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,667
Hang up right now...
I've got my subject...

348
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,375
I'll talk to you later.

349
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,417
Hey... What?

350
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,125
Hello? Ira?

351
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,292
Hey!

352
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,375
S***!

353
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
Strange woman!

354
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,583
Hello?

355
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,916
Be a good boy, okay?

356
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:26,917
Okay.

357
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,792
Don't be naughty.

358
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,167
Okay, Mamma.

359
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,124
And complete your tasks.

360
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:33,833
- Okay?
- Okay.

361
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,083
- Bye.
- Bye... Go...

362
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,875
Suzy!

363
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,083
Suzy, just a minute.

364
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,250
Please come.

365
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,124
Hello.

366
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,250
Hello, my dear.

367
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:54,500
- Your son...
- Any problem, Sister?

368
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,458
Big problem.

369
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,708
Actually, you haven't paid any fees
for the last four months.

370
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,749
Oh, yes... I know, Sister.

371
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,167
Actually, I'm a little low on cash. So...

372
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,249
Suzy, your child is a gift of God.

373
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,458
Don't spoil his future, please.

374
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,582
Yesterday, we had a teachers' meeting.

375
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:19,958
And it was decided that all the fees
had to be cleared in the next two days.

376
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,042
Otherwise, you'll be served a notice.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,917
Your son may not make it
for his exams.

378
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,625
I tried to call you.

379
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,207
But you were perhaps busy.

380
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,833
Please pay the fees by tomorrow.

381
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,667
I'll try my best.

382
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,375
God bless. Take care.

383
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,042
Uncle, why are you sitting here?

384
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,875
- Please come inside.
- No.

385
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:11,542
I'm not here for tea.

386
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,125
I just want to talk to you
and then I'll go.

387
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,667
Please tell me.

388
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,500
Do you even remember
how many month's rent is pending?

389
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,750
Three months.

390
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:27,333
Today is the third day
I've come looking for you.

391
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,125
Yes, Mom told me.

392
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,916
I was out of town on a shoot.

393
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,666
Please don't give me that excuse again.

394
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,499
I know what happens
in these shoots very well.

395
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,292
What's the point of shooting
when you can't even pay rent?

396
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,042
Uncle, you'll get your money.

397
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:49,457
I just need this week.

398
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,416
I'll be getting my payments this week...

399
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:56,417
I can't run after you like loan sharks
for money.

400
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,707
Someone is willing to pay me an advance
for this place today itself.

401
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,749
You have exactly two days.
Two days.

402
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,124
Pay up or move out.

403
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,083
Keep that in mind.

404
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,708
Shooting nonsense!

405
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:27,832
Madam, we've submitted
all the designs for Vivel on time.

406
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,332
But they're still looking for
other agencies.

407
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,167
I think they're trying to lower the budget.

408
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,958
What if we tweak our quotation...

409
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:40,416
Not a penny more,
not a penny less.

410
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,791
This is Sen's.

411
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,125
Ma'am...

412
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,833
Ma'am...

413
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:49,707
I needed to see you urgently, that's why...

414
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,917
- I'll come back later...
- Actually, ma'am...

415
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,041
The designs I had submitted...

416
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,083
for the new Vivel campaign...

417
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,167
If you could pay me something
for that...

418
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:03,249
I need some money right now.

419
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,000
It's very urgent, ma'am.

420
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:12,666
I'm not your ATM that you can get money
out of me whenever you want.

421
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,374
And those designs
haven't even been approved yet.

422
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:21,708
Mr. Das, please get her out of here.

423
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,208
Madam...

424
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,042
Hello?

425
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,667
Hello, Doctor?

426
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,708
This is Rupa.

427
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,874
Rupali Ghosh.

428
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,208
Yes, yes...

429
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,125
My coughing has not stopped.

430
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,707
There was some blood too.

431
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,750
Blood?

432
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,292
Yes, blood.

433
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,999
Are you taking your medicines properly?

434
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,207
Yes... For the last four months.

435
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,374
Have you done the tests I suggested?

436
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,042
Yes, I've got them done.

437
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,957
I've got all the reports too.

438
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,916
I want to see all the reports.

439
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,333
Meet me at my chamber.

440
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,292
At the Bhowanipore chamber.

441
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,625
Okay. I'll come.

442
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,833
- Rupa!
- Coming!

443
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:42,417
My heart is not your toy, Ratan.

444
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,875
Wow! What modesty!

445
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,708
Then you should just stay home.

446
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,250
Is it so painful
to show some cleavage?

447
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,542
Just one button?

448
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,875
Just one...

449
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,000
Okay, now say your line.

450
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,125
Look at the camera.

451
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,333
Action.

452
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,708
- My heart is not...
- Let it be.

453
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:12,417
Shantanu, where do you find
these people?

454
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,582
Sorry, boss.

455
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,707
So much drama for just one button?

456
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,582
Why doesn't she stay home?

457
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,208
Okay... Thank you...

458
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,292
It's just a button, man...

459
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,542
You didn't get it, right?

460
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,250
You have a good figure.

461
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:54,333
Why are you shying away
from showing it off?

462
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,625
If I had to get work using my body...

463
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,458
I wouldn't have been an actor.

464
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,332
There are lots of other kinds of work.

465
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,625
I could have done those.

466
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,625
Everyone can't do it.

467
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,207
Moreover, this is the glamour industry.

468
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,667
People see how you look first.
Then how talented you are.

469
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,792
Look and cleavage
are two different things.

470
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,750
Let me tell you something...

471
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,875
Magenta Films is looking for girls
for their short films and web series.

472
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,499
You don't have to do much.

473
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,958
There are some intimate scenes.

474
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,708
But they will pay you cash
right after pack up.

475
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,667
You can try.

476
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,500
They'll cast you immediately.

477
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Hello?

478
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,207
Hello, Archie?

479
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,792
Sorry, sorry, sorry...
My mistake... Wrong number.

480
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,499
Was it 779 or 997?
Damn it!

481
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,333
Done.

482
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,332
- It's working and your contacts are synced.
- Thanks a lot.

483
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,583
- Here's the headphones, charger etc...
- Okay, okay...

484
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,708
Archie?

485
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,458
Yeah, Ira?

486
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,667
What's up with you?

487
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,958
Couldn't get through to you
since you hung up.

488
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,375
There's a huge problem.

489
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,101
You'll not come to the
party tonight, right?

490
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,708
When did I say that?

491
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,666
I dropped my phone and...

492
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,542
Let it be.
I don't want your excuses.

493
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,184
My parents will wait
for you till 9 o'clock...

494
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,875
Then they'll cancel the wedding.

495
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,250
Archie, listen to me...

496
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,708
Hello?

497
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,833
Disgusting!

498
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,082
What happened, darling?

499
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,582
What are you thinking about?

500
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:55,583
Nothing really...

501
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm sorry.

502
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,500
It's not that important, aunty.

503
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,417
Is your son alright?

504
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,750
Yes.

505
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,667
Then what are you worrying about?

506
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,292
When will Meher be back, aunty?

507
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,208
I don't understand your friend
or you...

508
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,416
I've been telling Meher for so long...

509
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,875
Please get married...
Please get married...

510
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,750
But she never listens to me.

511
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,000
And you...

512
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:30,333
You couldn't hold on to your husband.

513
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,792
I wonder what will happen to you two.

514
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:38,792
Meher will find
a very good husband, aunty.

515
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,542
She's not stupid like me.

516
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,792
She's a good judge of character.
She won't be fooled easily.

517
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,250
Can I say something, love?

518
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,832
The one who appears worldly wise...

519
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:55,125
they have learnt it the hard way.

520
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,333
You're trying to be clever
with me.

521
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,416
You think I don't understand anything.

522
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,707
You're saying nothing's wrong.

523
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,833
You think I can't understand.

524
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,958
Please tell me...
Is something wrong with your son?

525
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,958
No, aunty... I mean...

526
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,708
There's a lot of pressure
on Bob from school.

527
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,583
Aunty, can you watch him today?

528
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,249
I've got to go now.

529
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,458
Of course.

530
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,125
Yes, Suzy.

531
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,458
Meher, sorry to disturb you.

532
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,042
Actually, I'm in some trouble...

533
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,582
What happened?
Is my brother alright?

534
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,792
Yes, yes... Actually, the problem
is mine, Meher.

535
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,291
I need...

536
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,292
Please tell me.

537
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:07,291
Actually, I have to pay
Bob's school fees tomorrow.

538
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,250
And I don't have...

539
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,167
Money?

540
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,083
I'm broke too...

541
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,458
Can you manage some money
from somewhere?

542
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,624
I mean... Please...

543
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,375
Okay, I'm trying, Suzy.

544
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,958
Thank you.

545
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,292
He'll dump me... Won't marry me...
I'll see how...

546
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,583
Mamma's boy...

547
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,082
Ira, the morning story photos
are very good.

548
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,374
They've really come out very well.

549
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,416
Now, about the cover story,
new age women.

550
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:47,707
I need it today.

551
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,500
Today?!

552
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,041
I got a last minute call
from the Mumbai office.

553
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,667
But sir I have to go to my...

554
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,374
Ira, I know your problem.

555
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,125
But you know it better than me.

556
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,625
The newspaper has to go to print.

557
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,542
What's up, Meher?

558
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,625
Problem, Ira.

559
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,458
I'm the one with the problems.

560
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,374
I've to reach Archie's place
by 9 o'clock.

561
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,333
And I'm still not done with my story.

562
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,416
And if I don't make it there today...

563
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,207
I won't have a relationship anymore.

564
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,042
Listen...

565
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,542
If Archie wasn't my best friend,
I would've married him.

566
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:32,708
Then I wouldn't have to deal
with these perverts at the auditions.

567
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,875
I wouldn't have to worry about rent either.

568
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,458
Ira...

569
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,792
The marriage will save you.

570
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:48,208
You don't know how tough it's been
since Dad passed away.

571
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,292
You got an ultimatum
from your landlord, right?

572
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,667
So...

573
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,917
Please figure something out.
I need some money today.

574
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,875
What to do?

575
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,042
I've an idea!

576
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,082
I'm sending you Ms. Sen's agency's number.

577
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,457
Okay? They're looking for...

578
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,792
a new model.
You should try.

579
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,042
Modelling?

580
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,208
Do you want the money or not?

581
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:17,207
Yes, okay.
Send me the number.

582
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,125
Right away.

583
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:18,708
Thanks, Ira.

584
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,708
Bye.

585
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,208
What's wrong with you, Rupa?

586
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,208
You don't look well at all.

587
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,458
Don't know.

588
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,833
I feel very tired all time.

589
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,041
Are you taking some pills for pregnancy?

590
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,042
No.

591
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,875
He's the one who needs medicine.

592
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,750
What does your husband
have to say about it?

593
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,875
- He doesn't say anything.
- Does he...

594
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,875
do something about it or...

595
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:05,417
Oh, hi...

596
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,917
She doesn't listen to any of us.

597
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,958
Maybe she'll listen to you.

598
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,499
She spends the entire day in the kitchen
slogging for the family.

599
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,124
What else will she do?
That's the life of a married woman.

600
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,291
Why?

601
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:22,500
She has a life of her own. Right?

602
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,000
She should think about that too.

603
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,542
I'll see you later.

604
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,542
Please don't mind my saying so, Rupa...

605
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,000
Your brother-in-law's
gaze is very sleazy...

606
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,167
Just the gaze?

607
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:45,457
Even his touch is poisonous.

608
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,167
Let it be.

609
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,916
You should report them to the police, Rupa.

610
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,667
- Why are you tolerating this?
- What else can I do?

611
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,333
What can I do?

612
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,582
One brother doesn't even touch me...

613
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,833
And the other one just...

614
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,832
I don't want to talk about it.

615
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,500
They're getting away with it
because you're too good to say anything.

616
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,125
I would have dragged them to court.

617
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,042
What's the point?

618
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,625
Would my life be any different?

619
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,083
Such a nice dress!

620
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,750
Do you think
I can carry off a dress like that?

621
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,667
Sometimes, I really feel like, you know...

622
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,333
I'll wear high heels.

623
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,083
I'll wear a dress like that.

624
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,667
I really wish I could.

625
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,667
Don't know if I'll ever get a chance.

626
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:54,207
Are you just going to give up?

627
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,250
Keep all the pain buried in your heart?

628
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,583
No, I won't.

629
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,917
I dream quite often.

630
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,333
Both of us have travelled to the hills...

631
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:11,292
And we're throwing snowballs at each other
like they show on TV.

632
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,624
He feels very cold...

633
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,083
But I really want to take him
to snow-capped mountains.

634
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,958
Daughter-in-law!

635
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,417
Where's the coconut for the lentils?

636
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,583
I'll have to go now.

637
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,208
Do you know how many people send us
their photos everyday?

638
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,833
That's normal.

639
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,292
This is a big agency.

640
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,583
Who wouldn't want to work here?

641
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,708
Then?

642
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,000
Why should my agency work with you?

643
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:02,000
Because others don't have the x-factor
which I think I have.

644
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,375
And what is that?

645
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,208
Courage.

646
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,457
When you rush in to do something
you don't know...

647
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,667
it's foolishness not courage.

648
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,958
X-factor... I don't see it.

649
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,708
All I see is the foolishness otherwise...

650
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,417
Why will you leave your job in the
TV serial and become a model?

651
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,542
Acting is my passion.

652
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,750
And modelling is just a hobby?

653
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,250
Go home...

654
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,791
Learn to question yourself.

655
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:39,166
If you really loved acting then...

656
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,666
you would have worked harder
to become a lead.

657
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,582
You'd have waited in a production house.

658
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,750
You wouldn't have wasted my time.

659
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,375
I'm sorry.

660
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,500
You could've given me one chance.

661
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,917
At least, to find out
if I'm wrong about myself.

662
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,458
You want to prove yourself?

663
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,583
Go around with some casting director.

664
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,708
You'll get both cash and chance.

665
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,375
You don't look like
you can do that either.

666
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,875
I must say...

667
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,042
to break someone's confidence...

668
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,292
one minute with you is enough.

669
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,292
If I didn't tell you...

670
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:42,625
Would you have known how hopeless you are?

671
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,958
Wait a minute...

672
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,417
Ira.

673
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:05,167
Mom...

674
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:06,707
I'm very busy.
Can I call you later?

675
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,333
Oh God! How much later?

676
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,375
Look at the time.

677
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,582
It's already 3 o'clock.

678
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,624
I know...

679
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,292
But I can't leave until my work is done.

680
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,292
What do you mean, Ira?

681
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,374
Are you going to prioritise your job
today too?

682
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,791
He is waiting for you.

683
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:21,207
His parents are waiting for you.

684
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,750
Mom, I know.

685
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,292
Don't have to remind me.

686
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,874
Ira, don't push it.

687
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,916
I want to make something
very clear to you.

688
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,207
If you don't make a final decision today...

689
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,417
I won't be involved
in your life anymore.

690
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,791
Strange!

691
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,917
Hello?

692
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:52,917
Yeah.

693
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:55,207
What is wrong with all of you, Archie?

694
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,125
You have decided...

695
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:58,291
you won't let me work
in peace, right?

696
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,582
What do you want?
We'll get married...

697
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,874
and I'll make coffee for you
all my life.

698
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,875
No...

699
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,332
That's my job.

700
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,957
I haven't forgotten my promise.

701
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,167
I just want to know if I'm there
on your priority list.

702
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,916
And my parents...

703
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:13,250
want me to marry someone
who gives me first priority.

704
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,833
Not second.

705
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:16,375
What?!

706
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,500
Archie?

707
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,208
Arch...

708
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,292
Ira.

709
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:36,750
Boss is asking
for the cover story article.

710
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,374
You want the story...
here take it...

711
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,792
- Oh no!
- Idiot!

712
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,832
Mamma... Mamma...

713
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,792
Good boy!

714
00:42:57,793 --> 00:42:59,957
- How was school?
- Mamma, let's hurry.

715
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:03,667
- I want to play. Yay!
- Yes, yes. Go...

716
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,375
Let's play.

717
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,042
Suzy!

718
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,875
Suzy!

719
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,624
Just a reminder.

720
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:18,082
Please pay the fees tomorrow.

721
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,667
Otherwise, you'll be served a notice
in the evening.

722
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,167
I don't want tomorrow to be Bob's last day
at school.

723
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:26,792
Okay?

724
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,375
- Here, take it.
- This is too little money for second lead.

725
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:58,125
And who is ever going to cast me
as a lead anyway?

726
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,583
Everyone just wants to take advantage here.

727
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:07,082
In all your time in the industry, have you
ever heard anything bad about me?

728
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,791
All these heroines you see around...

729
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,749
All of them were mentored
by this Priyo Sharma.

730
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,957
- Keep this money...
- No, Priyo...

731
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,041
- Listen to me... Trust me...
- No, this is too less...

732
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:16,207
I'm telling you to take this money.

733
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,874
- But...
- Here, take it...

734
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,417
- What's stopping you...
- Priyo...

735
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,083
Who are you?
What do you want?

736
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,749
You can't recognise me?
It's Meher.

737
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,559
I was in the outdoor shoot
day before yesterday.

738
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,167
The film's name is "Akasher Surjo".

739
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,167
That film's production
has been postponed.

740
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,167
You'll get to know
when work starts again.

741
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,749
Leave your phone number with me.

742
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,499
No, actually, I'm not here for work.

743
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,333
Then what?

744
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:42,042
I'm here for the cheque
for the work already done.

745
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,667
Is the cheque ready?

746
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,667
I really need the money very badly.

747
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,875
Cheque?

748
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:51,292
You've become a big artiste now, is it?

749
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,958
And you want a cheque
for that brilliant performance?

750
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:54,750
Get lost!

751
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,458
Don't bug me.
Get out of here.

752
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,428
You'll get to know
when the cheque is ready.

753
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:02,667
Did you count it?

754
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,583
Is it okay?

755
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,958
Listen, you're not getting it at all.

756
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,332
No, no, no...
I have to move tomorrow.

757
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,417
You have to complete the packing
by tomorrow.

758
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,249
My flight is at 9 o'clock tomorrow.

759
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,166
- But I told you before...
- Urna...

760
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,847
- It's my parents' anniversary...
- Urna...

761
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,625
Yes, Mr. Das?

762
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,625
Madam.

763
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:51,833
Siddharth has booked two flight tickets
to Bagdogra through our travel agent.

764
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,458
The other ticket is for...

765
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,875
some Ms. Bhattacharya.

766
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,167
Do you know anything about it?

767
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,167
What happened to Titir?

768
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:06,542
Fever.

769
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,667
And the doctor thinks it's typhoid.

770
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,833
A change would be...

771
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:21,542
Drive.

772
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,875
I didn't think the matter was this serious.

773
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,833
I thought it was a minor throat infection.

774
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,458
We should have tested you before.

775
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,291
Can you understand
what I'm saying, Rupa?

776
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:45,708
What I'm saying...

777
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,167
Rupa...

778
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:52,500
There's something yellow
on your collar.

779
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm sorry to say that...

780
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
you have an advanced stage
of lung cancer.

781
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,583
You have around three more months.

782
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,750
However, if we immediately
start the chemo...

783
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:39,999
The city has plunged into darkness

784
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,207
How will it light up again?

785
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:49,749
The seashell of the heart
has been washed away

786
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:55,124
Who has dressed up streets?

787
00:47:55,125 --> 00:48:00,124
The songs of the birds will end

788
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:04,916
But still no one will understand my heart

789
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:09,916
No happy ending to my fairytale

790
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:13,499
My life's broken swing sways back and forth

791
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:21,500
How do I make things right?

792
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,457
You don't know

793
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:23,999
But everyone loses themselves in this city

794
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,374
My own shadow

795
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:34,124
Has turned to dust at the touch of light

796
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:38,999
But the music still plays on

797
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,957
Even though everything seems fake

798
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:48,207
But the heart stands tall like a mountain

799
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:52,332
In this scattered city of mine

800
00:49:52,333 --> 00:50:00,333
How do I make things right?

801
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:07,833
Damn...

802
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,167
Ira, a big problem has come up.

803
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,042
And only you can manage it.

804
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:20,417
This word has been playing
as my partner since morning.

805
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:21,917
"Problem".

806
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,167
Please tell me.

807
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,500
Last minute decision
from the head office.

808
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,917
Your story will go as the centre page.

809
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,458
Centre... Centre page?

810
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,291
That would mean...

811
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,374
we need more photographs.

812
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,375
Exactly.

813
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,458
But...

814
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,666
Where will I get them now?

815
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:41,667
You'll find stories if you try.

816
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,332
But I have a commitment today...

817
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,333
I know, Ira.

818
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,916
If you leave now, you can do both.

819
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:49,750
No, it's not possible.

820
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:52,832
I have to move according to time.
It's not the other way around.

821
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,542
Ira... Ira... Ira...

822
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,333
Your promotion is being discussed
in the head office.

823
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,125
Now, you decide...

824
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,957
whether you want to do laundry
in Kolkata or...

825
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,958
you want to relax by the sea
in Mumbai.

826
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,125
Think about it.

827
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,125
Damn it! I hate my life!

828
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:21,583
What to do?

829
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,792
We're in the same boat.

830
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,375
I have to pay the school fees tomorrow.

831
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,750
And I have to pay rent.

832
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:41,417
And I need a job.

833
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:46,458
Can't deal with this tension
every month.

834
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,500
What should we do, Suzy?

835
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,792
All our desires... Our efforts...
Our struggles...

836
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,208
Will all of it be in vain today?

837
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,500
Are we going to lose?

838
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:02,542
No.

839
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,458
I'm not thinking of giving up.

840
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,167
I'm looking for a way to survive.

841
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,500
We must persist, Meher!

842
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:18,167
No matter how.

843
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:23,583
How else will we fight
the odds tomorrow?

844
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:29,625
Magenta Films is looking for girls
for their short films and web series.

845
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,333
You don't have to do much.

846
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,792
There are some intimate scenes.

847
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,333
But they will pay you cash
right after pack up.

848
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,292
They'll cast you immediately.

849
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,375
Suzy...

850
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,875
It's more important to survive today,
isn't it?

851
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:55,583
If we don't survive today,
how will we dream of a better tomorrow?

852
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,375
Tell me...

853
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:03,250
What is the definition of sin
in the Bible?

854
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:06,583
The only sin is not loving
other human beings.

855
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:09,500
And what is the punishment
for the sin?

856
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,957
Not being loved by others.

857
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,750
What is the matter?

858
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:18,208
Why are you asking all this?

859
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,792
I was hesistant about something.

860
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:26,042
But you cleared it up for me.

861
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,207
Go home, Suzy.

862
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:32,292
You'll be able to pay
your son's school fees tomorrow.

863
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,208
HONEYMOON WITH HONEY

864
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,167
Cut it!

865
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:02,333
Great shot!

866
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,042
Let me see it.

867
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,708
Are you free tonight?

868
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,124
What about my husband?

869
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:17,332
But all the meetings for the new projects
are at night.

870
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:21,542
Is there going to be another audition?

871
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,332
No audition today.

872
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:26,958
I'll directly sign the contract with you.

873
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,833
- Sir...
- What is it?

874
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,917
New girl.

875
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,042
She's looking for work.

876
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:41,792
Acting?

877
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,417
Bring her in.

878
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,042
Okay, sir.

879
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:50,917
Let's go.

880
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,958
Can you act?
Have you acted before?

881
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,292
Acting is what I do.

882
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,417
Films, megaserials...

883
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,042
Wow!

884
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:09,792
You're a veteran it seems.

885
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:14,583
But I don't recognise your face.

886
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,958
Do you really look for new names
in the title credits?

887
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,167
Great!

888
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,292
You have courage.

889
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,041
This courage is what we need.

890
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,833
And I need work.

891
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,750
We're not trying to make art here.

892
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,708
I wouldn't be here if I wanted to.

893
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:41,250
Excellent! Let's begin the audition.

894
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,208
Audition?

895
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46,833
There's no art, no acting.

896
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,583
What's the audition for?

897
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,833
Just tell me if I'm hired.

898
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,083
See...

899
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,125
The way you look...

900
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:57,167
I've no other option but to hire you.

901
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,833
But you know what?

902
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,792
Stripping behind closed doors...

903
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:07,250
And doing it in front of the camera
is very different.

904
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,875
I just wanted to test you.

905
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:13,875
I've never had to strip
behind closed doors, anyway.

906
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,125
- I have some urgent need...
- What do you need?

907
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:20,042
Money?

908
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:29,083
That's one of the reasons people agree
to undress in front of the camera.

909
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,208
There's 50 thousand in here.

910
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,833
Hope this will take care of your need.

911
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:54,875
But you deserve much more than this.

912
00:57:55,208 --> 00:58:00,042
You just have to prove yourself.

913
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,500
You'll get much more.

914
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,625
Hey, get the shot ready.

915
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,000
New project is on!

916
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,625
Damn!

917
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:46,375
Ira.

918
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,042
What is it?

919
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:48,291
Boss is looking for you.

920
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,999
I told him,
you're out taking photos.

921
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,833
Did you get something?

922
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:53,207
Yes, darling! I did!

923
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,916
A duck's egg in the crow's nest.

924
00:58:54,917 --> 00:58:55,750
Will it work?

925
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:56,958
What? What do you mean?

926
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,333
It means nothing.

927
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:01,832
But please hurry.
You're getting engaged today.

928
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,542
- Hey, listen...
- Excuse me.

929
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,875
I think this is yours.

930
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,082
Hello. Hello?

931
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:07,667
S***!

932
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:08,583
Ira? Ira?

933
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:09,874
Thank you.
You hang up.

934
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,249
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

935
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,416
I completely forgot about it
while talking on the phone. Thank you.

936
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,417
Exactly.

937
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:19,708
The phone is the devil's gift
to mankind.

938
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:23,000
It messes up life's priorities.

939
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:25,625
Anyway, nice to meet you.

940
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:40,374
Hey, what's your rush?

941
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,458
At least, sit down and eat.

942
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,250
You've become so grumpy.

943
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,249
We also studied...

944
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,625
But we've never ignored our family.

945
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,250
Mom.

946
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,249
Just because I'm not going to the family
reunion doesn't mean I don't care.

947
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:00,041
I've to fight a lot
in the college union meeting today.

948
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:04,582
It's more important for me
than the fake smiles at the party.

949
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:08,624
Of course... Be with your
college and union...

950
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,505
You don't have to care
about your family at all.

951
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,375
I'll go there alone.

952
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,542
And if anyone asks for you...

953
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,832
I'll tell them my daughter
has grown up.

954
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:19,582
Please don't ask me about her.

955
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,249
Please don't be sentimental.

956
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,666
Everyone has priorities in life.

957
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:24,749
They follow it.

958
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,083
I am doing the same.

959
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:28,750
Yes, please do that.
But listen...

960
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:34,833
But before you do please think about it
carefully with your head and heart.

961
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:38,832
I know, right now, uncles, aunts, cousins
are less important.

962
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:44,457
Friends, college, union etc.
Seem more attractive right now.

963
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:47,542
But one day none of this will matter.

964
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,625
You'll need someone
to stand by you that day.

965
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:57,457
And that person will stay with you
if you prioritise.

966
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,458
Got it?

967
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,708
Where were you?

968
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:15,083
Mom was looking for you.

969
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,542
Answer me.
Where were you?

970
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,083
I went to see the doctor.

971
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,124
More Ayurveda?

972
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,792
I've told you so many times,
these medicines don't work.

973
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:30,125
Maybe, it would have.

974
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,417
If you wanted it to.

975
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:35,833
What do you mean?

976
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,958
Are you trying to say
I don't want a child?

977
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,500
Do you really want it?

978
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,166
Do you think you'll be able to lead
this comfortable life?

979
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:48,625
What do you want me to do?

980
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,500
Do you want to me to find a job?

981
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,875
Men of my family have never worked a day
in their lives.

982
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,416
They only live off the rent.

983
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,542
Hey, what did you say?

984
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,832
You're pushing this too far, Rupa.

985
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,583
There's a limit to everything.

986
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,667
You seem to know it well.

987
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:10,833
Who knows where she goes
in the middle of the afternoon...

988
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:41,375
I know why you're mad at my brother.

989
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,833
I've told you before...

990
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:48,041
The hunger is not just in the stomach.

991
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:51,250
The hunger of the body
needs to be satiated too...

992
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,500
Who will satiate me?

993
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,167
You?

994
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,375
Why?

995
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:03,416
Do you think I'm so inadequate?

996
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,875
Why don't you come with me?

997
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:06,332
Just once.

998
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,042
I'll show you what a real man is.

999
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,291
You've taken a lot of advantage of me...

1000
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:12,499
- No, no... Stop it...
- Do you want more?

1001
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,832
I'll tell the neighbours
what you do, animal...

1002
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:19,624
- What are you doing?
- She's gone crazy...

1003
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,292
What's happening?

1004
01:03:20,293 --> 01:03:23,999
I was just telling her
not to talk to you like that...

1005
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,875
when Mom is around...

1006
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:28,750
- Don't lie! Don't you lie!
- And she started hitting me.

1007
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:30,291
- Did you hit him?
- Yes, I did.

1008
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:31,541
- Apologise!
- I was right!

1009
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:32,749
Apologise right now!

1010
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,750
Apology?

1011
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:39,166
She won't because this is what her parents
have taught her.

1012
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:40,707
She'll lose her respect
if she says sorry.

1013
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:41,916
And what have you taught them?

1014
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:42,333
Just see...

1015
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:44,541
What have you taught your two sons?

1016
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,374
Your younger son wants to sleep
with his sister-in-law.

1017
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,042
He will go to you after sometime.

1018
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,125
Oh my God!

1019
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,374
Disgusting...

1020
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,999
- That's why...
- You're right...

1021
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,749
That's why God hasn't given you a child.

1022
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,041
So disgusting...

1023
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:04,082
Otherwise, it must have...

1024
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,207
Do you want to know?

1025
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,249
Do you want to know
why I can't get pregnant?

1026
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,541
You know how to read, right?

1027
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:11,582
Please take a look at the prescriptions.

1028
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,583
And you'll know why I can't have a baby.

1029
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:18,375
This heroic son of yours
can only beat his wife.

1030
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,167
But can't get her pregnant.

1031
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:37,625
ROMANCE IN ROME

1032
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,417
Why do you make me so hungry?

1033
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:50,458
Your body is full of romance.

1034
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:55,875
Cut!

1035
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:57,667
What happened?

1036
01:04:57,917 --> 01:04:58,917
Hey!

1037
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,042
Why did you stop?

1038
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,917
We're not supposed to kiss.

1039
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:09,832
I was just improvising.

1040
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,791
No, I'm sorry.

1041
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:14,416
You should tell me if you're going to
improvise during the rehearsal.

1042
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:15,417
Then I wouldn't have done it.

1043
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:16,375
What's your problem?

1044
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:18,042
You need money...

1045
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,583
And I need you.

1046
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,291
Yes, I need the money.

1047
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:23,957
But not in lieu of my dignity.

1048
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,499
Hey, babydoll...

1049
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,000
Don't act innocent.

1050
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:30,208
You grabbed the money I gave you.

1051
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,582
But you don't want to work for it.

1052
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,041
Let's finish the shot.

1053
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:35,125
Come on.

1054
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:46,417
I'm an artiste, not an escort.

1055
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,042
Get the next shot ready.

1056
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:52,125
Hello, Meher?
Where are you?

1057
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,542
What is it?

1058
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,125
Did you meet Ms. Sen?

1059
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,875
I didn't just meet her.

1060
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,625
I spoke to her too.

1061
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:05,417
She made me realise
how hopeless I am.

1062
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:06,957
I'm so sorry.

1063
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,917
I had no idea
it wouldn't work out.

1064
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,958
She's actually very rude.

1065
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,249
She's a b****!

1066
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,000
Let it be.

1067
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,542
How are you doing?

1068
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,167
I'm in the same state as you.

1069
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,292
Hopeless.

1070
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:20,916
I told you that...

1071
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,583
I've to go to Archie's place
at 9 o'clock.

1072
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,624
His parents are going to announce
our wedding...

1073
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,583
But I don't know how I'm going to
make it there on time.

1074
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,750
What?

1075
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:30,917
Why can't you reach?

1076
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:31,417
You've no idea...

1077
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,958
Too much pressure at work.

1078
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,041
Archie is your best friend.
Please talk to him.

1079
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,874
I mean, in case, I'm late...

1080
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,458
Please ask him
not to misunderstand me.

1081
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,458
Okay.

1082
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,417
I'll handle it.

1083
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,792
I'll take care of it.

1084
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:48,416
But listen... You try
and reach on time. Okay?

1085
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,541
Thank you... Thank you so much...

1086
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:52,042
And please let me know
what he said, please.

1087
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:53,375
I'll let you know.

1088
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:54,667
Don't worry.

1089
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:56,250
Bye.

1090
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,083
Okay, bye.

1091
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,750
Please take the next left.

1092
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,458
Hello, Archie.

1093
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,250
Where are you?

1094
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:40,707
Mamma, I'm very hungry.

1095
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,125
I want noodles.

1096
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:48,458
I'm so sorry, baby.

1097
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,249
Give me two minutes.

1098
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,042
I'm making your favourite noodles.

1099
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,250
Go play.

1100
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,542
Where the hell is it?

1101
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:19,082
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

1102
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,791
You're bloody irresponsible.

1103
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,541
You're the mother of a child.

1104
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,124
What is this?

1105
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,125
What's there in the kitchen?

1106
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:26,250
You have no clue.

1107
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,124
So what we're out of noodles?
I'll make something else.

1108
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,957
You know I've been busy with the sketches
since morning.

1109
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:33,125
To hell with your sketches
and paintings, man.

1110
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:34,917
What do you think of yourself?

1111
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,292
Da Vinci, my a**!

1112
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,208
Bob?

1113
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,333
Bob?

1114
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:26,500
What if Mamma makes you
a yummy soup?

1115
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:27,874
You'll have it, no?

1116
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:31,999
No, Mamma... Please noodles...

1117
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,708
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!

1118
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,333
Hi!

1119
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,792
Saying please or thank you
shouldn't bring you down.

1120
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:17,249
And if you cancel the friend request
after sending it on Facebook...

1121
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,625
I get to know.

1122
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:26,875
Having a party?

1123
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:30,833
It's my parents' anniversary.

1124
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,624
How long have they been married?

1125
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:33,833
40 years.

1126
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,625
Wow!

1127
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,792
Some people can really push it.

1128
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:42,457
I noticed you're going somewhere
a little while ago.

1129
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,167
You must have forgotten something.

1130
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,458
Yeah, phone's charger.

1131
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:50,625
By the way...

1132
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,250
If you're free in the evening...

1133
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:56,417
You're most welcome to come.

1134
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:08,042
Bye, see you.

1135
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,708
Thank you.

1136
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,791
I have a reason to feel awful.

1137
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:23,166
Why are you pulling the long face?

1138
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,167
Shut up.

1139
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:26,375
Both of you have lost it.

1140
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,332
I know one person has lost her mind.

1141
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,917
But what's my fault?

1142
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:33,791
You've always burdened Ira
with your conditions.

1143
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:34,833
Why?

1144
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,499
Give her some space.

1145
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,166
- Let her decide what she wants to do.
- What will she decide?

1146
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,499
She still can't prioritise
between her work and me.

1147
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,583
I talk to her mom more
because she doesn't even call her back.

1148
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,208
I know...

1149
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,041
But please don't force her.

1150
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:50,875
You know...

1151
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:53,957
I realised today while looking for work...

1152
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:56,958
Anyone can insult me anytime.
Do you know why?

1153
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:59,708
Because I let them.

1154
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,292
Will you also take advantage of Ira?

1155
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,332
Then tell me what to do.

1156
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:06,500
I don't think she'll make it today.

1157
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,708
Archie, do you love her?

1158
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,667
Do I still have to prove it?

1159
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,332
Then let her be.

1160
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,249
Accept her for who she is.

1161
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:18,125
She'll come to you
when the time is right.

1162
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,541
Okay... I've let go.

1163
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:21,791
I'll keep waiting.

1164
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:23,291
But what about my parents?

1165
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,958
Why should they wait?

1166
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,041
It's your responsibility
to make them understand.

1167
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:30,124
It's my duty to tell you
but you'll do what's best for you.

1168
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,624
There's one thing I know for sure.

1169
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:35,208
I'm sure there's some problem.
Or else, you won't be so philosopical.

1170
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,875
Problem?

1171
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,208
Problems don't face me anymore.

1172
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,667
They ignore me.

1173
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:47,083
Because it knows
I can't face it anymore.

1174
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,417
What's wrong?

1175
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,375
Maybe I can help.

1176
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:57,499
Can you find me a job?

1177
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,749
Anything... Acting, modelling...
Whatever I can do.

1178
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,833
Otherwise, I'll...

1179
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,499
You know I can't help you with acting.

1180
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:10,707
But you can try to contact my
cousin, Aahan. He has an ad agency.

1181
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,624
He needs models for ad campaigns.

1182
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:13,750
Is it?

1183
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:18,041
Archie, please tell him to meet me today.

1184
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:20,083
I'll talk to him.
See if something works out.

1185
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:21,708
Archie...

1186
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,042
Archie, you're the best I have.

1187
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:26,625
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1188
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,124
Damn it.

1189
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,125
Why is the artwork file corrupted?

1190
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,542
Stupid technology.

1191
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:48,875
Sir?

1192
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,875
I'm so sorry.

1193
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,624
- What did you say your name is?
- Meher, Archie's friend.

1194
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:58,250
Oh, right! Archie had called.

1195
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:03,292
But Meher I can't offer you
a job right now.

1196
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:09,625
There might be something
but for that...

1197
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:11,583
this presentation has to work.

1198
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,417
What is this presentation for?

1199
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:17,542
It's for Vivel Lotus Oil.

1200
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,749
They're launching a new campaign.

1201
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,625
This is what the presentation is for.

1202
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,500
Hope all will be fine.

1203
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:27,917
I hope so too.

1204
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,291
But I'm feeling really bad.

1205
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:34,000
You're Archie's friend.
And you're so beautiful.

1206
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:38,250
And I can't offer you any work.

1207
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,250
It's okay, sir.

1208
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,708
Today has been the worst.

1209
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,542
Maybe everything will be better tomorrow.

1210
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,875
- I'll get...
- Can I say something?

1211
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,583
Don't call me sir.

1212
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:54,333
I mean if you ever come back here.

1213
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:55,999
Just call me Aahan.

1214
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
No sir.

1215
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,500
Only God knows what's in store today.

1216
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,875
If I can't show the representation today...

1217
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,667
all my hard work
will go down the drain.

1218
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:15,917
Aahan...

1219
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,667
My heart says...

1220
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,542
You will get the project.

1221
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:27,042
You, women, are always so encouraging.

1222
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,000
I didn't get it.

1223
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:33,249
Actually, this presentation
that I'm so worried about...

1224
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,708
It was created by a woman.

1225
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,458
My ex-girlfriend.

1226
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:42,958
Why ex?

1227
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,207
She ran away.

1228
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:48,333
Without finishing the work.

1229
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:53,750
But she pushed me
to pitch for this campaign.

1230
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:58,291
I didn't realise it at the time
that her smile was fake.

1231
01:17:58,292 --> 01:18:00,042
It wasn't real.

1232
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,291
I'm so sorry.

1233
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,832
I've no idea why I'm boring you.

1234
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,125
Don't worry.

1235
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:11,542
It's good to let these things out
to feel better.

1236
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:14,250
Doesn't matter who listens to you.

1237
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,125
A stranger...

1238
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,833
or a mirror.

1239
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,583
I didn't mind at all.

1240
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:23,125
Thank you, Meher.

1241
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:27,500
- Bye. See you.
- See you.

1242
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,958
Mary Aunty... Mary Aunty?

1243
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,792
- Mary Aunty...
- Coming, Suzy.

1244
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,042
Yes.

1245
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,792
Can Bob stay here with you?
I'll be back soon.

1246
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:41,042
Okay.

1247
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,000
Don't be too late, child.

1248
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:46,375
You know this area is not safe.

1249
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:48,875
I know, aunty.

1250
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:50,042
Don't worry.

1251
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,875
I have a meeting about a job.

1252
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,583
I'll be back soon.

1253
01:18:54,792 --> 01:18:55,708
Okay.

1254
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:58,499
Come on, baby. Come on.
Let's go.

1255
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,417
- Would you like to have some brownies?
- Yes!

1256
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,457
I'll explain everything to madam.

1257
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,875
All of you please...

1258
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,125
Please, please, please...

1259
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,333
Madam...

1260
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:13,957
Madam, they haven't received their salaries
for the last two months.

1261
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:14,999
That's why, they're agitated.

1262
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,541
Don't worry.
I've calmed them down.

1263
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:22,333
Siddharth is waiting for you
in your office.

1264
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:35,417
Please calm down.

1265
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,791
Where are you going, darling?

1266
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:48,999
If I hear one more word from you,
I'll call the police.

1267
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,749
Was that a threat?

1268
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,292
Then, let's scare her for real...

1269
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:56,500
Don't touch me...
Stop this...

1270
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,500
What are you doing?

1271
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:02,625
Help! Help, please!

1272
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:03,667
Help!

1273
01:20:03,668 --> 01:20:04,750
- Hey!
- Help!

1274
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:06,208
Scoundrel!

1275
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:16,875
It's okay...
It's okay...

1276
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:20,417
It's okay.

1277
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:33,625
What are you doing here again, Siddharth?

1278
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,000
That wasn't our deal.

1279
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,582
I wanted to tell you something.

1280
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,791
You would get to know anyway,
sooner or later.

1281
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:47,541
That's why, it's better
that you hear it from me.

1282
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,458
You're going to Darjeeling.

1283
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,707
With some Ms. Bhattacharya.

1284
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,208
Actually, she's Titir's governess.

1285
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,875
She looks after Titir.

1286
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:59,625
That's why I'm taking her along.

1287
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:11,042
Reena, it's been a long time
since our divorce.

1288
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,750
Sorry.

1289
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,750
But the amount of money
hasn't increased.

1290
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,583
Please think about it.

1291
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:33,792
I'm really struggling
to make ends meet.

1292
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,542
As the father of our daughter...

1293
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:43,708
saying things like this,
doesn't look good, Siddharth.

1294
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,833
Let me tell you something...

1295
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:57,917
I've decided today
that I'll not give you any money.

1296
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,917
- Please...
- Reena...

1297
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,208
Out!

1298
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:07,083
Out!!!

1299
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,208
Madam?

1300
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:32,207
Your daughter is really very unwell.

1301
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,208
Please reconsider your decision.

1302
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,583
Get lost!

1303
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,667
Get lost.

1304
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,167
Born orphan...

1305
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,042
Abusive husband...

1306
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,917
Disturbed child...

1307
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,000
Here.

1308
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:58,292
Why do bad things always happen to me?

1309
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,417
What is my fault?

1310
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,750
It's not your fault, Suzy.

1311
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,042
It's just a game.

1312
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:19,125
Time is playing with you,
me, everyone.

1313
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,792
You can call it a test too.

1314
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,083
While struggling, one day
when you win this fight...

1315
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:31,875
then you'll know
what a life full of happiness is.

1316
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:36,042
And if you lose...

1317
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,500
that'll just be living.

1318
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:04,167
Suzy, did you paint this?

1319
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,749
What is this presentation for?

1320
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,292
It's for Vivel Lotus Oil.

1321
01:24:12,542 --> 01:24:14,374
They're launching a new campaign.

1322
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:16,500
If I can't show the representation today...

1323
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:19,167
all my hard work
will go down the drain.

1324
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:25,874
Suzy, life is always playing games with us.

1325
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:28,167
Games?

1326
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,749
Listen, you might get a job today.

1327
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,625
Really. So, go, get ready.

1328
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:37,917
Go... Get ready...
Go, go, go...

1329
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:56,625
I don't want to be second priority
in your life.

1330
01:24:56,958 --> 01:25:00,042
You're free to call me a male chauvisnist.

1331
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,292
I get it.

1332
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:33,708
Hey, why the long face?

1333
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:36,167
Nothing seems okay.

1334
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:37,667
Why?

1335
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,625
I don't think Ira will come today.

1336
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:45,166
I've told you before also
that a relationship doesn't work like this.

1337
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:46,457
Then how does it work?

1338
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,667
Compatibility!

1339
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:53,791
Are you leaving
because of that too?

1340
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,750
My case is different.

1341
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,416
Why are women so selfish?

1342
01:25:58,417 --> 01:25:59,832
You don't think about the men at all.

1343
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:01,957
Stop being so immature.

1344
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:05,249
Men can lead a comfortable life
because the women care.

1345
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,832
What do men ever sacrifice?

1346
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,666
Does your life change
before or after marriage?

1347
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:12,917
Women always get the worst deal.

1348
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:16,958
You don't know anything.
Neither does Ira.

1349
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:24,083
Do you know how much Mom and Dad
are going to miss you?

1350
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,792
Ira doesn't understand.

1351
01:26:25,793 --> 01:26:29,542
I know her work is important
but I should be important too.

1352
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,791
Archie, listen to me carefully.

1353
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:37,916
Ira is a modern, independent,
working woman.

1354
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:39,832
Please give her some space.

1355
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,707
You'll see, everything
is going to be alright.

1356
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,250
Trust me.

1357
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:08,792
Sorry... Sorry...

1358
01:27:26,792 --> 01:27:31,208
Yes, ma'am... What do you want?

1359
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,958
Any drink?

1360
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:46,458
What? That?
Okay.

1361
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:36,708
All you got

1362
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:40,249
You lost it today

1363
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,874
All you found

1364
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:47,457
You lost it today

1365
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:51,582
Why does life hurt?
Why does love hurt?

1366
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:55,332
Run away with your dreams
Why does your heart ache?

1367
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:59,041
Break through to your dreams
What makes your heart ache?

1368
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,874
Light up your eyes with fire

1369
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:05,458
Let the fire light up the world

1370
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:09,666
Who's gonna burn?

1371
01:29:09,667 --> 01:29:13,791
Your carefree heart
Melts away the venom

1372
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:17,291
Your empty heart
Will find you again

1373
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:20,874
Riding on fire
Where are you off to?

1374
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:24,457
Riding on fire Let go of control

1375
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,374
No one really knows you

1376
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:28,582
You keep drowning in your sleep

1377
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,249
The songs in your dream

1378
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,291
When are you gonna write them?

1379
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:35,874
Light and shadows on your face
This old fever

1380
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:39,207
Throw it away from your life

1381
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,082
Write with a new light

1382
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:43,124
Reclaim your life

1383
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:47,125
Riding on fire
Where are you off to?

1384
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:56,917
Drift away from the dark...
Drift away...

1385
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,999
She lives alone
With no one around her

1386
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,832
It's the end of the road

1387
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:14,707
Burn the world down
Burn the skies down

1388
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,832
All she sees is fire

1389
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:20,291
Where did she go wrong?
She lost the fight

1390
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:23,749
She lives alone
With no one around her

1391
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,666
It's the end of the road

1392
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:29,291
Burn the world down
Burn the skies down

1393
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:31,582
All she sees is fire

1394
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:34,624
When will you dream of a new dawn?

1395
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:38,832
Your carefree heart
Melts away the venom

1396
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:42,041
Your heart will fly
With the wind beneath your wings

1397
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:45,874
Riding on fire
Where are you off to?

1398
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:49,374
Riding on fire Let go of control

1399
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,332
No one really knows you

1400
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,541
You keep drowning in your sleep

1401
01:30:53,542 --> 01:30:55,124
The songs in your dream

1402
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:57,249
When are you gonna write them?

1403
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,707
Light and shadows on your face
This old fever

1404
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:04,166
Throw it away from your life

1405
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,957
Write with a new light

1406
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,082
Reclaim your life

1407
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:12,083
Riding on fire
Where are you off to?

1408
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:21,667
Drift away from the dark...
Drift away...

1409
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:38,458
Darkness and light...

1410
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:48,458
Light and darkness...

1411
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:17,125
Drift away from the dark...
Drift away...

1412
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,457
Excuse me. Can you let Aahan know
that Meher is here?

1413
01:32:56,458 --> 01:32:58,416
We're here for some urgent work.

1414
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:01,166
I told you
he is in an important meeting.

1415
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:02,667
Please wait.

1416
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:16,624
No, no. The design is ready.

1417
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:20,457
It's just that our artwork file
is somehow corrupted.

1418
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,124
Sir, please understand the situation...

1419
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,916
This is ridiculous, Mr. Roy.

1420
01:33:23,917 --> 01:33:25,291
We told you way in advance.

1421
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,749
This is a very serious matter.

1422
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:29,291
We don't have any time at all.

1423
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:31,207
And the product is very important for us.

1424
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:33,541
And the new campaign has to be out
in the market.

1425
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:34,791
- I know... I know...
- Come on, Mr. Roy.

1426
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:37,249
But let me assure you
that you'll love our designs.

1427
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,833
Just give me some time
to solve the situation, sir. Please...

1428
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,833
- Hey, check if the background is okay.
- Let me see.

1429
01:33:49,917 --> 01:33:52,875
Please hurry.
The client is waiting inside.

1430
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,416
- Please say something...
- I don't know what to do...

1431
01:33:55,417 --> 01:33:57,457
I think I'm going to lose my job today.

1432
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,707
I am going to lose it too.

1433
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,917
- But do something...
- Excuse me.

1434
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,916
Is this the new campaign design
for Vivel Lotus Oil?

1435
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:05,917
Yes. Why?

1436
01:34:05,918 --> 01:34:08,374
Okay, I think I can help you.

1437
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:10,832
What do you mean?
Can you seriously do it?

1438
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:11,957
Yes, I'm a designer.

1439
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:15,375
- Okay, then, please sit.
- Yeah, yeah, please.

1440
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,749
Suzy, what are you up to?

1441
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,125
This is Vivel Lotus Oil's
new campaign design.

1442
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:40,167
This is what I designed for Ms. Sen.

1443
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,917
Remember I told you,
she didn't pay me.

1444
01:34:44,708 --> 01:34:46,000
Yes.

1445
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:51,542
- Sir, please understand my situation...
- No, not possible... Sorry.

1446
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,374
Please give me some more time.

1447
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:55,832
I'll have the designs ready
for you by tomorrow.

1448
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:57,916
We believe in today, Mr. Roy.

1449
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:59,541
Tomorrow is utopia for us.

1450
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:00,708
Correct!

1451
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:03,082
Sir, I can understand...

1452
01:35:03,083 --> 01:35:04,666
But please try to understand
my situation, sir.

1453
01:35:04,667 --> 01:35:06,833
There's nothing more I can do.

1454
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,333
It's done.
Printing it now.

1455
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,250
Okay...

1456
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:33,583
Let's go.

1457
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:38,582
- Sir, please don't leave, sir...
- No... It's over...

1458
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:40,707
Sir, I'm trying to get
it done by tonight...

1459
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,457
What are you doing here, Meher?

1460
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:44,291
Aahan, your design is ready.

1461
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:45,542
What is that?

1462
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:53,851
This really looks interesting.
Do you like the design pattern?

1463
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,292
Not bad.

1464
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,582
This looks quite relatable.

1465
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:01,042
- I like this "v".
- Me too.

1466
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:04,332
- Look at this.
- The tagline?

1467
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:06,332
- Hashtag...
- No more compromises.

1468
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:09,583
Hashtag "No more compromises"...

1469
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:13,166
Nice!

1470
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,625
It's on, Mr. Roy. Congrats!

1471
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,208
- You're a lucky man.
- Really...

1472
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,624
Now, mail it officially.

1473
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:21,999
Of course... Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1474
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,583
- You're welcome.
- All the best, Mr. Roy.

1475
01:36:33,042 --> 01:36:35,416
Madam, all the employees have quit.

1476
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:37,542
No one wants work here anymore.

1477
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:41,500
And one more bad news.

1478
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:45,833
We've lost the Vivel campaign.

1479
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,416
Thank you, Suzy.
Thank you so much.

1480
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:08,458
- If it wasn't for you...
- Don't thank me.

1481
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,291
- You were in trouble so...
- That's the thing...

1482
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:14,791
It's difficult to find helpful people
in times of trouble.

1483
01:37:14,792 --> 01:37:18,708
I really appreciate
you helping me out today.

1484
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,500
Will she get the job now?

1485
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:22,625
What did you think?

1486
01:37:22,626 --> 01:37:25,125
I'll just thank you
and be done with it.

1487
01:37:25,292 --> 01:37:27,624
Who's going to deal with
the rest of my clients?

1488
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:31,457
If you're okay with it,
I'd like you to start from tomorrow.

1489
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:35,332
And I'm transferring some money
to your account for your help today.

1490
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:36,583
Please accept it.

1491
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:45,625
I must thank you now.

1492
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:47,042
See you tomorrow.

1493
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,125
- Let's go...
- Meher...

1494
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:54,750
Today is a very special day for me.

1495
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:58,542
But I don't have anyone
to celebrate it with me.

1496
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:04,750
Why? We're here.
Right in front of you.

1497
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,042
Really?

1498
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,416
Then, let's celebrate.

1499
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:11,083
How about dinner?

1500
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:15,500
Aahan, can I tell you something?

1501
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:18,750
A dinner might make you very happy.

1502
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:23,292
But I won't be able to enjoy it today.

1503
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:28,707
Meher, when I was younger...

1504
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:32,542
my mom would give me a gift
everytime I was sad.

1505
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:36,917
I can give you a gift
to make you feel better.

1506
01:38:38,667 --> 01:38:39,958
What gift?

1507
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:42,957
We've to shoot the ad now.

1508
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,957
And I need a model for that.
Right, Suzy?

1509
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:46,958
Of course!

1510
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:49,957
Now, tell me if you are ready to do it?

1511
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:52,792
If you are, then I would like
to sign you up with an advance.

1512
01:38:55,083 --> 01:39:02,332
Well, when all of life's stresses are
released, I think we all can celebrate.

1513
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:03,125
Super!

1514
01:39:03,126 --> 01:39:04,916
But not in any restaurant.

1515
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:08,374
Two of my closest friends
are getting engaged today, so...

1516
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,083
You're talking about Archie, right?

1517
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,875
I completely forgot
that I'm supposed to be there too.

1518
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:15,499
So, let's all go together.

1519
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,916
Let's go.

1520
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:17,999
- Okay...
- Let's go.

1521
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,083
- Let's go...
- We have to change... Come...

1522
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,999
Hello, Ira?

1523
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,750
Tell me.

1524
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:38,082
Where are you, Ira?

1525
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,291
I've been calling you for so long.

1526
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:43,833
Boss is very angry.
Mumbai office is calling constantly.

1527
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:46,291
I think my relationship is over.

1528
01:39:46,292 --> 01:39:48,916
What are you saying?

1529
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:50,082
Really?

1530
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,749
Didn't find any subjects.
Couldn't make any photos...

1531
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,666
How will I manage everything?

1532
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:57,249
Ira, remember...

1533
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,542
the newspaper...

1534
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:01,250
must go to print.

1535
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,625
Hey, don't try to tell me...

1536
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:12,167
Hello? Ira?
Hello? Hello?

1537
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:14,750
Whatever!

1538
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,250
Hi!

1539
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:03,250
What a beautiful location!

1540
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:04,792
Really beautiful...

1541
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,667
What a fantastic view!

1542
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:13,416
Boss, I've never climbed so many stairs,
that too faster than Bolt.

1543
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:16,667
I might not win a gold medal
but a smile from you will do.

1544
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:20,250
See, I forgot to introduce myself.

1545
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:23,458
Hi, I'm Ira.

1546
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,291
Why did you save me?

1547
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:39,124
Why?

1548
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:41,416
You can die if you want.

1549
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:46,292
You can jump from here or hang yourself.
But first tell me why?

1550
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:50,458
I don't need to know
but what about your family?

1551
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:54,333
At least, give them a reason.

1552
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:58,416
You can escape if you die. Right?

1553
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:00,416
All your troubles will be over.

1554
01:42:00,417 --> 01:42:04,749
But what about the ones who love you?

1555
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:08,124
They will have to carry the burden
of your death.

1556
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:11,208
But I have no one.

1557
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:14,041
If something happens to me...

1558
01:42:14,042 --> 01:42:18,375
it won't make a difference to anyone.

1559
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:24,999
Your definition of "no one"
is not very clear to me but...

1560
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,041
what I understand by family
and friends is...

1561
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,874
people who love me a lot...

1562
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:32,124
Someone who will take risks for me...

1563
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:34,708
and will die for me.

1564
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:40,582
I don't know who you have or don't.
But right now, you have me.

1565
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:43,125
Now, tell me your name.

1566
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:51,375
Come on... Tell me...

1567
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:53,667
Rupa.

1568
01:42:56,292 --> 01:43:01,999
The doctor said I don't have
more than three months to live.

1569
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,666
That's why, I thought...

1570
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:05,332
You thought you should die.

1571
01:43:05,333 --> 01:43:07,499
Suicide is a better option.

1572
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:11,625
What's the point in living
for these three months?

1573
01:43:11,917 --> 01:43:15,833
Do you know how much you can do
in these three months, Rupa?

1574
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,124
You can throw a party
for yourself every day.

1575
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:22,332
You can celebrate your birthday
and cut a cake every day.

1576
01:43:22,333 --> 01:43:27,042
You can enjoy each and every moment
in your life only for yourself.

1577
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:34,042
I... I just want some love.

1578
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:41,042
Just a little... Nothing more.
Nothing more...

1579
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:47,167
You need another person
to make you feel loved, Rupa.

1580
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:49,833
But you can love yourself too.

1581
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:54,582
Okay, now you have two options.

1582
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:58,957
One, we can chat all night
in this beautiful location.

1583
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:02,082
And two, I can take you to a great party...

1584
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:04,541
where you won't be bored.
I guarantee.

1585
01:44:04,542 --> 01:44:07,042
Now you decide what you want to do.

1586
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:10,166
But no matter what you decide,
you're stuck with me.

1587
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:13,333
Because I'm not leaving you alone
in this state.

1588
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:28,458
Madam?

1589
01:44:29,917 --> 01:44:31,542
Madam...

1590
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:38,292
What will we do now?

1591
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:43,250
Ms. Sens don't give up so easily.

1592
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:47,625
But it's all over.

1593
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:52,667
My life was already over that day.

1594
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:01,750
The day Titir passed away.

1595
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:11,875
Even after that the scoundrel...

1596
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:18,708
lies to me about Titir.

1597
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:23,083
And takes money from me.

1598
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:27,000
What else is left, Mr. Das?

1599
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,542
Mr. Das?

1600
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:40,667
I need a friend very badly.

1601
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,500
What do you mean?

1602
01:45:43,708 --> 01:45:46,042
Nothing...

1603
01:45:52,375 --> 01:45:55,667
Apply for the bank loan.

1604
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:13,624
How are you?
Meeting you after a long time.

1605
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:15,416
We remember you as a kid.

1606
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:17,291
All grown up now.

1607
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:19,417
When are you getting married?

1608
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,207
Excuse me...

1609
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:24,041
- He is getting engaged today, I think.
- Really?

1610
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:25,042
You didn't know?

1611
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,042
Yeah?

1612
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:28,708
Archie...

1613
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:33,708
I don't think I'll have this job anymore.

1614
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:37,875
But I want you for the rest of my life.

1615
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,667
Will you be there?

1616
01:46:41,292 --> 01:46:42,292
Tell me...

1617
01:46:44,292 --> 01:46:46,250
I want to be with you too...

1618
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,917
Always...

1619
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:50,583
What happened at work?

1620
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,583
I couldn't find the subjects
for my new assignment.

1621
01:46:56,250 --> 01:47:01,124
Maybe, women don't have success stories
in new age Kolkata.

1622
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:02,667
Come over, you crazy girl!

1623
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,958
For the last 40 years, my mom...

1624
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,957
has been by my Dad's side,
for better or for worse.

1625
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:08,559
Don't you think this is a success story?

1626
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:12,625
Your story is waiting here...
With me...

1627
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:15,833
And you're looking for
it all over the city.

1628
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:17,583
Come to me.

1629
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm waiting for you, Ira.

1630
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:22,458
I'm on my way.

1631
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:36,791
I had to do everything.

1632
01:47:36,792 --> 01:47:38,624
You didn't take any responsibility.

1633
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:39,333
What is it?

1634
01:47:39,334 --> 01:47:41,083
Where's the music?

1635
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:42,999
The music system is right there.

1636
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,500
That won't work.

1637
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:46,667
We need live music, bro.

1638
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:48,375
I'll be right back.

1639
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:50,000
Where are you going?

1640
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:05,750
Hey, stop the car...

1641
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:08,916
Guys, please try to understand.

1642
01:48:08,917 --> 01:48:10,792
You'll get free booze and food.

1643
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:12,499
Are you even listening?

1644
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,500
Urna?

1645
01:48:17,542 --> 01:48:21,500
- Hey, what are you doing...
- Actually, I was...

1646
01:48:22,125 --> 01:48:24,249
on my way to your party...

1647
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:25,417
Pass me that...

1648
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,583
What are you doing here?

1649
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:31,582
Actually, I've been listening to them
all day.

1650
01:48:31,583 --> 01:48:32,624
They're very good.

1651
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:36,082
So, I thought to make
our terrace party livelier...

1652
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:37,583
You know...

1653
01:48:38,958 --> 01:48:40,375
Excuse me.

1654
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,500
Yes?

1655
01:48:41,792 --> 01:48:44,833
There's party right now.
How much will you charge?

1656
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:49,166
I'll pay in cash.

1657
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:51,042
50% right now and...

1658
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:54,292
if you're not good,
I won't answer your call.

1659
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:57,292
What did I tell you?

1660
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:01,250
Today might turn out to be different.

1661
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:05,417
- Guys, we got a gig!
- Yay! -Yay! - Yay!

1662
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,417
Thank you!

1663
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:40,583
My heart is in trouble now

1664
01:49:41,667 --> 01:49:45,875
The moon is high up in the sky

1665
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:50,375
It didn't care much about itself

1666
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:55,292
It had given up on happiness

1667
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:59,375
My heart is in trouble now

1668
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,541
The moon is high up in the sky

1669
01:50:04,542 --> 01:50:09,166
It didn't care much about itself

1670
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:13,749
It had given up on happiness

1671
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:18,166
Far away from the crowd
Out in the open sky

1672
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:22,791
Plays with abandon
Sings out loud

1673
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:27,499
The crooked lanes
The broken hearts

1674
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:31,333
Like a rolling stone
Losing it's way

1675
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:33,749
A little right, a little wrong

1676
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:36,624
Holding the evening's hand

1677
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:40,500
Is telling you to come back home

1678
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:45,792
A little bit of day, a little bit of night
Your hand on my shoulder

1679
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:49,792
Is telling you to come back home

1680
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:52,166
A little right, a little wrong

1681
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:55,041
Holding the evening's hand

1682
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:59,082
Is telling you to come back home

1683
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:04,208
A little bit of day, a little bit of night
Your hand on my shoulder

1684
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:08,583
Is telling you to come back home

1685
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:41,458
I have boarded a crowded train to nowhere

1686
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:45,792
My heart wants to get off
at the dream station

1687
01:51:46,042 --> 01:51:50,624
The nests know what it's to be alive

1688
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:54,333
That's what brings the heart back home

1689
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:59,207
It feels so good

1690
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:03,958
And the heart knows that better

1691
01:52:04,542 --> 01:52:09,000
Far away from the crowd
Out in the open sky

1692
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:13,707
Plays with abandon
Sings out loud

1693
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:18,332
The crooked lanes
The broken hearts

1694
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:22,166
Like a rolling stone
Losing it's way

1695
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:24,582
A little right, a little wrong

1696
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:27,374
Holding the evening's hand

1697
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:31,416
Is telling you to come back home

1698
01:52:31,417 --> 01:52:36,625
A little bit of day, a little bit of night
Your hand on my shoulder

1699
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:40,625
Is telling you to come back home

1700
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:42,999
A little right, a little wrong

1701
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,874
Holding the evening's hand

1702
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:49,916
Is telling you to come back home

1703
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:55,042
A little bit of day, a little bit of night
Your hand on my shoulder

1704
01:52:55,083 --> 01:53:00,250
Is telling you to come back home
