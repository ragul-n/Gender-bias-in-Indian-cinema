1
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,680
THORATTI (Plucking Tool)

2
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,120
Ramanathapuram District.... Early 80's

3
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,200
We are nomadic shepherds.

4
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,080
Our job is during the period between 
the cultivation and harvest.

5
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
We set temporary 
pen for the goats...

6
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,400
And make the land fertile 
with goats' feces.

7
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,320
We keep moving from one 
place to another.

8
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,280
Evenn now we are going to uncle 
Marudhappan's village for a living.

9
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,840
Nallaiah's family would be awaiting.

10
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Have to take him before 
'the village head' leaves.

11
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
Have to meet 'The village head'.

12
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,160
You can meet him at the cattle shed.

13
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Excuse me, sir.

14
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,480
Welcome Marudhappa. 
- Greetings, sir..

15
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
I was just thinking of you.

16
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
Greetings, sir.

17
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
I myself wanted to meet you. 
- Oh!

18
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,240
The harvest is over. 
You can set up the pen in our land.

19
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Got it?

20
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,280
Only after you are done with your work, 
I can spread the manure.

21
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,040
Sir... ! - Advance amount? 
- Not at all.

22
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,640
He is Mr. Nallaiah.

23
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Greetings. 
- He is my distant relative.

24
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
He is from Ramanathapuram district.

25
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,560
The drought has driven them here.

26
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,280
Is it raining cats and dogs here?

27
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
It's just drizzling then and there.

28
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
God has plans for everyone.

29
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Then you can set the pen 
tomorrow and proceed.

30
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,760
Also in the vacant 
place of the temple...

31
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
You can ask him to build a hut.

32
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Hey!!!

33
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
What's this? 
Focus on your job.

34
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,560
We will take leave. 
- Thanks.

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,280
We will take leave. 
- Thanks.

36
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,840
Excuse me! 
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,600
You will begin the job with a 'Kidai 
choru', isn't it?- Of course, sir.

38
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,840
Let me join it as well. 
- Definitely.

39
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh God!

40
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
My goodness.

41
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
Thank God.

42
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,360
The jamuns are 
making me go crazy.

43
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,560
I have to punish my tongue.

44
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,120
Even then I'm not sure of the results.

45
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
This is to be blamed for everything.

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,760
Once for all.

47
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,880
Are you going on a long trip?

48
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,400
Just to the market 
to buy groceries.

49
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,000
Nallaiah is hosting 'Kidai Choru'.

50
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
To buy the requisites 
for the feat.

51
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Stay cautious.

52
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Will be back soon.

53
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,760
Prayer for the Lord Pillayar and 
the food bestowing land.

54
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,480
The natural forces...

55
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,920
And the cattle make the land fertile.

56
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,760
We welcome Lord Karuppa 
to save the flock.

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,600
Let the barren lands bloom...

58
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,760
Let the dry trees flower...

59
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
Let the seeds sprout...

60
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,720
Bless us Oh God!

61
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Forgive our sins...

62
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,480
Accept our offerings...

63
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,360
Bless our generations to cherish!

64
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,560
Our job has begun...

65
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,600
The east has thrown a 
light on our paths.

66
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,960
The land is our home...

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,240
The cattle is our kin...

68
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,640
Our labour makes the land fertile.

69
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,160
It rains three seasons.

70
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,360
Crops grown in all directions.

71
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Dividends for all...

72
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Like rain showering 
a barren land...

73
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Love cherishes all.

74
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Our poverty doesn't 
stop from sharing love.

75
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,440
Like a dormant bermuda grass...

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,280
My heart is preserving your love.

77
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,960
Rain and Sun are our kin and kith.

78
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,080
We need none others for support.

79
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,560
When we take the 
flock for a graze...

80
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Our folk songs echo 
through the topography.

81
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,800
It's a custom here.

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Someone has marked it for them. 
Grab someother dung.

83
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Cattle is our deity.

84
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
Seems to be a hard working lad.

85
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,440
Let's get our daughter married to him. 
- I echo it.

86
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,880
When we lay on the 
banks of the streams...

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,000
It makes us forget all our worries.

88
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,520
The widespread sky narrates 
thousands of stories to us.

89
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
The fertile land...

90
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,960
Gets nourished by us...

91
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,360
We are the nomadic shepherds.

92
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,960
Greetings! 
- Who are you? What do you want?

93
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,760
We are the nomadic shepherds currently 
staying in the neighboring village.

94
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,440
I was informed that you are done 
with the harvesting.

95
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
Before the next sow...

96
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
If we setup a pen and fill 
the land with manure...

97
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
Land's fertility will be enriched 
and the outcome will be doubled.

98
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,640
Obviously you will earn as well.

99
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,840
That should be the primary reason.

100
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Carry on. 
- Thanks.

101
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Have this, dude.

102
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Silver wrist chain.

103
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
My petty contribution.

104
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
See how smart I'm.

105
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
A bag of rice.

106
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,480
We have to be least bothered about 
the food for quite some time.

107
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Why are you staring at me?

108
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
It's high quality 
seeraga samba rice.

109
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
I tested it myself.

110
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Let him go. 
Why are you hitting him?

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
Looks like fat lady's chain.

112
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,640
Don't take the rice. 
Give it.

113
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,520
I can't accept your offer.

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
It's my rice. 
- I can't give it for your price.

115
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,840
When he can't give it for your price 
why are you behind his back?

116
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Mind you business. 
He stole my rice.

117
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
My rice...

118
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Why do you do such things?

119
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,880
Please stop.

120
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,480
The rogue stole my rice.

121
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:19,920
If you can give me a lift, 
we can catch him.

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,960
If you can give me a lift, 
we can catch him.

123
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,120
I will split his head into two.

124
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,880
There he goes. 
Chase him down.

125
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
What's it? 
Air check?

126
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,800
It's sufficient.

127
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,160
I don't get you.

128
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,760
Leave me.

129
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,920
Oh my God!

130
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,560
You scoundrel. 
Are you a thief as well?

131
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm not sure of the reason. 
But food is what lures me first.

132
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,520
Ignore him. 
He is a glutton.

133
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,680
He's up with his calculations. 
- How much would it fare?

134
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,800
Let's deviate the conversation.

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,640
We have rice to eat and 
liquor to booze.

136
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,840
Meat would be the 
best compliment.

137
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,160
Do you know how much does meat cost? 
Do you have money?

138
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
Crazy guy! 
When did we pay money to get meat?

139
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,520
I have options for 
that as well.

140
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,920
The guard is awake.

141
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
He is standing. 
But you say he has fallen asleep.

142
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,960
He is standing. 
but indeed he is asleep.

143
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,960
I don't get it. 
- It's the habit of the sheperd's community.

144
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,440
He will pretend to be standing 
to deceive the onlookers.

145
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,760
Someone has taught him.

146
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,880
You keep moving. 
I'll join you shortly.

147
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,960
Move. - I want to see how 
he sleeps while standing.

148
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,800
He is sleeping while standing.

149
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,480
Hey stop!

150
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,320
Guys! 
Help me.

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,840
Guys! 
Help me.

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Leave him.

153
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Leave him.

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,760
Leave the goat, 
you muggers!

155
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,760
Muggers?

156
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,000
You deserve a rough lesson.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,640
Punch him.. 
- Let me go.

158
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,840
Why are you pushing us away?

159
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
Give me the goat.

160
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,600
Seems you haven't learnt the lesson. 
Your limb needs to broken.

161
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,440
It's my favourite.

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
It's my favourite.

163
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,200
It's my pet, 'Chevalai' 
I'll replace it with another.

164
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
It's my pet, 'Chevalai' 
I'll replace it with another.

165
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Do you think we are fools?

166
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Do you think we are fools?

167
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,240
Are you trying a new trick as you 
couldn't defend it with your valor?

168
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,400
I swear. 
I'll replace it.

169
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,200
He is confusing. 
- Seldom trust him.

170
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,920
He is confusing. 
- Seldom trust him.

171
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Have to content with the 
same porridge today as well?

172
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
Have to content with the 
same porridge today as well?

173
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Wait.

174
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,080
Let me get you another goat.

175
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,600
Are trying to trap us 
by gathering people?

176
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
You got your goat. 
Now scoot.

177
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,640
Many a slip between 
a cup and lip.

178
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,480
Many a slip between 
a cup and lip.

179
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:35,760
One mustn't eat words.

180
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,640
One mustn't eat words.

181
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
Please give me some time.

182
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
Pass it to me....

183
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,760
You didn't trust me. 
We live by our words.

184
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,440
You stole it for your food, isn't it?

185
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,760
Have this. 
- What's it?

186
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,880
Dry marinade. 
It tastes good.

187
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,720
You are a good boy. 
We will come tomorrow as well.

188
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Let's go. 
Mutton gravy for dinner.

189
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Sir...

190
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,240
Sir!! 
- Have some patience.

191
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,680
The game has reached 
an interesting phase.

192
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,200
Twelve... 
2 fives.

193
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,520
Sir... 
- Why are you being pesky?

194
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
What do you want? 
- Payment for manuring.

195
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Payment?

196
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,840
You sought me to let you 
set a pen.

197
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
Why should you I pay?

198
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,800
For setting a pen. 
- Why are you repeating the same?

199
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,920
You came and rested for some days.

200
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,600
You took all the things that 
you brought.

201
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Then why should I pay? 
- Please don't be so unreasonable.

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,640
Setting up a pen is for 
the fecal manure.

203
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
Your pay will not 
feed us through ages.

204
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,600
It will help us feed for some days. 
- Fine.

205
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
I will talk in your terms.

206
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,640
You leave the faeces. 
What's the core cause of it?

207
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,040
It's because the sheep consumed the 
plants and shrubs in my land.

208
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,880
So where does the payment 
come in to picture?

209
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,360
I heard people saying...

210
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
I heard people saying...

211
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,040
You are a shrewd cheat. 
It turns out to be true.

212
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,360
It's unfair to expect a man 
like you to judge our labor.

213
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,840
I will assume that I have 
spread it for free for a needy.

214
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Excuse me.

215
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,640
Irony doesn't suit people 
of low stature.

216
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Scoot. Don't imagine you 
working around here.

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,120
Are you locking horns 
with the head?

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Dad!

219
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:51,880
Got all the listed things? 
- Yes.

220
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Got all the listed things? 
- Yes.

221
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,040
Why do you need a unburnt pot? 
- I'll let you know.

222
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,080
We commit to the job with the sun 
and moon as the witness.

223
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,880
The land of the head who 
refused to pay us for the labor...

224
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,200
should go barren to an extent that 
it's must even produce ruderals.

225
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,040
It must stay so till he 
settles us our payment.

226
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,600
I curse it to stay barren.

227
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,280
Who is that? 
Catch him.

228
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
Let me go.

229
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Bloody moron.

230
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
Are you trying to curse 
us by planting a pot?

231
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,680
I swear that I will 
bury you alive.

232
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,040
There is a guard?

233
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He has slept.

234
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
The guard has slept. 
Let's move.

235
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,840
You are enough to steal a cow.

236
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,240
Idiot. We are to 
steal just one cow.

237
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,840
But there are many angry 
ones surrounding it.

238
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
It's easy to transport a calf.

239
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,760
But the requisite is a miking cow.

240
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
It's bulky.

241
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,680
How to move it?

242
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
And they have delegated 
it to me alone.

243
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,200
They have tied someone.

244
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,160
They have tied someone.

245
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,120
Its the shepherd.

246
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,320
Come here. 
Come here, I say.

247
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,480
Come on.

248
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
Isn't he the shepherd? 
- Absolutely.

249
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
Why is he been tied up? 
- Not sure.

250
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,800
They are to be pitied.

251
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,160
He is right. 
Let's go.

252
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,800
Have this.

253
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Maaya!

254
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,080
I felt like repaying 
our life saviors.. so

255
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,960
Exhibit the egg... 
Only then it will be sold.

256
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Don't hide it. 
- Okay

257
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,040
How are you, mister? 
- Don't be sarcastic.

258
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm worried that rain has 
played a spoil sport.

259
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
You are adding fuel to the fire.

260
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,080
So you have imported 
this clown to entertain?

261
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,160
I brought him from the 
town to work here.

262
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,520
How does it bother you? 
Get your quota and leave.

263
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
Get him two bottles. 
Take this.

264
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:15,680
Come here. 
- What?

265
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,080
Come here. 
- What?

266
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,280
Why does an dish 
washer need a coolers?

267
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,120
Let him go. 
Why are you trolling him?

268
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,240
You are the perfect 
fit for scare clown.

269
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,320
Get lost. 
- Leave the place, I say.

270
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Who is he?

271
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,080
You are giving away free booze 
and gifting money as well?

272
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
They are muggers.

273
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,520
They are a gang of three.

274
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,120
They are a gang of three.

275
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
It's an itinerary.

276
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,360
He doesn't deserve 
enough to be feared.

277
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,720
I will bring men from town and slit them. 
- Hey!

278
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
They are lunatics.

279
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,720
They are the ones who made me 
to roam around the courts.

280
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
What do you mean?

281
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,680
As I refused them to 
give free booze...

282
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,840
They poisoned the liquor.

283
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,600
10 to 15 people who consumed 
faced a near death situation...

284
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,240
My God!

285
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,920
What's cooking?

286
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
Rice porridge.

287
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,400
Can't you cook something spicy?

288
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,640
Am I your wife to satisfy 
your taste buds?

289
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
Have what's served.

290
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
The shepherd.

291
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,960
The same old story 
of dumb signs.

292
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,880
Excuse me.

293
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
Better.

294
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
What brought you here?

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
To meet you.

296
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,200
We would have been dead by 
now had you not saved us.

297
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,320
I want to repay the favour by 
serving you some tasty food.

298
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
So I have brought this sheep.

299
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,360
Is he really meaning it? 
- Cool.

300
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,720
He wants to see us happy.

301
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
We are orphans.

302
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,680
They are drafting a bigger plan!

303
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,040
Didn't you get it? 
- No.

304
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,000
You will leave after serving us.

305
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,560
What will happen after 
getting used to this tasty food?

306
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,720
I will serve you for ever.

307
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,360
Spicy food for lifetime!

308
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,680
Spicy food for lifetime!

309
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,840
That won't work out. 
He is right.

310
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
Take away the sheep.

311
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,360
It can be worked out.

312
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,520
Kins are the ones who 
help the ones in need.

313
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
It means you are my kin.

314
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,480
I truly mean it.

315
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,800
Please...

316
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,280
He has driven away the lucky mascot.

317
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,440
He has driven away the lucky mascot.

318
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,920
If I don't get the meat, 
I will substitute it with your ears.

319
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
Get lost, morons.

320
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,880
Wanted to befriend you, 
but you are driving me away.

321
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
Get lost, idiots.

322
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,360
Don't lose him. 
Cover him up.

323
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,720
I did it out of ignorance. 
Let me go.

324
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,080
Spare me.

325
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
He got scared.

326
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,080
Candidness will stick us together.

327
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,120
A goat is trapped 
in a pack of wolves.

328
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,640
Celebrations have begun...

329
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Jubilation on the rise.

330
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,360
We have a complete knowledge 
of the topography.

331
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,160
We are good men 
though unethical.

332
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,080
We roam like the country 
God Sudalaimada Samy...

333
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,000
Our hunt knows no borders.

334
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,360
The country liquor gets us high.

335
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,440
It gets us singing all the notes.

336
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,040
We are the unchallenged 
ruffians of the locality.

337
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,440
The people acknowledges 
it unanimously.

338
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,960
We are the the legacy of 
the Great Kattaboman.

339
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,200
We are the nomads...

340
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,600
We need no kin and 
kith but food.

341
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,920
No one has a lifestyle of ours.

342
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,440
We play games at odd hours.

343
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,080
Quick as an Indian rat snake.

344
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
Vigil as an owl.

345
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,880
We are self governed rulers.

346
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,080
What made you come 
home before the dusk?

347
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,520
My heart feels heavy.

348
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,520
What happened?

349
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,920
Like a male goat heads 
a flock of sheep.

350
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,480
Similarly we have only 
a son to care of us.

351
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm scared that we 
might lose him.

352
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,040
Come on. 
- I ran a thorn.

353
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:30,560
He is going through a bad phase.

354
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,280
He is going through a bad phase.

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,400
So he befriended bad people.

356
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,920
If we get him married...

357
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
He will mend his ways.

358
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Pechi...

359
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,080
This didn't strike me.

360
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,520
Why did you slit it here?

361
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,600
If you let the blood spill 
through the whole way...

362
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,480
People will assume that some 
wild animal did it.

363
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,240
You are smart enough even 
after getting high.

364
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,840
What happened?

365
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,360
You son had a pet 'Chevalai' right?

366
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,800
A thief has slit its throat 
and taking it away.

367
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,480
Go thrash the thief and 
get the lamb.

368
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,280
The thief is none 
other than your son.

369
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,920
He is abnormally drunk.

370
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,560
Just follow the path.

371
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,360
If you just roam randomly...

372
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,760
I will thrash you all.

373
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
I will go to Marudhappan's house.

374
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
You are right.

375
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,000
She will be the right 
choice for our son.

376
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
Where are you going?

377
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
Why are you halting around?

378
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,000
What are you staring at?

379
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,240
The only reason you are alive 
is that you increase the population.

380
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,400
Else you will be slaughtered 
for the next festive season.

381
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,480
Shoo!

382
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
You have eaten enough.

383
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,560
Hey girl!

384
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Who is it?

385
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,320
Uncle, is it you? 
- Yes.

386
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,120
How is aunt?

387
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,040
She is fine.

388
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
How are you? 
- Good.

389
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,840
Where is your dad? 
He is near the pen.

390
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,320
What made you come here?

391
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,440
I wanted to drive away 40 
sheep from your flock.

392
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,600
You are not ignorant to know that they 
can't be driven away just like that.

393
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,480
It will be gifted to the one 
who will marry me.

394
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,000
You sensed it.

395
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,040
Have it, brother.

396
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,640
Seems to be lost in thoughts. 
Not sure what he has in mind.

397
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,160
Any trouble with the rearing?

398
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,160
Do you want any sheep as loan?

399
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,680
Disclose the thing that’s running 
in your mind.

400
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm here to ask your 
daughter to marry my son.

401
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,640
Yes or no. 
Be precise.

402
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Oh God!

403
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,840
It had been a while since 
you came here.

404
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,960
You were too hesitant 
to ask for it.

405
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,400
If you are not confident 
about your son...

406
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
How can we get our 
daughter to marry your son?

407
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,120
Tell me. 
- Don't mistake us.

408
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,600
I might get my daughter married 
to one who has lost his limbs.

409
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,240
But not to a drunkard 
who has lost his path.

410
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,720
How much did you claim? 
40 or 50 sheep?

411
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
Why aren't you replying?

412
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,200
What happened to him?

413
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,120
What happened, uncle?

414
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,360
Get up, uncle.

415
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
Get up, uncle.

416
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,200
What happened?

417
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,880
Careful.

418
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,040
Just hold the breathe. 
Will be back in a jiffy.

419
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,240
Uncle...

420
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Have this.

421
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Get up.

422
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,040
Careful... 
Slowly...

423
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,000
Am I the most sought 
girl in the town?

424
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Once my dad refused to 
give his consent...

425
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,560
You should have challenged him 
and get you son married...

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,880
To some other girl.

427
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,680
Rather you are crest fallen.

428
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm not looking someone to 
act in a play...

429
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,320
But the savior for 
the rest of his life.

430
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,920
Your dad is my distant relative.

431
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,080
So I had a hope.

432
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,000
But luck wasn't on my side.

433
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,400
But luck wasn't on my side.

434
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,440
Let the fate take it's route.

435
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
God bless you.

436
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,920
It was my dad who refused 
to accept the offer.

437
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,800
I didn't.

438
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,920
I will marry your son.

439
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,160
Let's fix the engagement 
the next Friday.

440
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,120
I will convince my dad.

441
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,200
Dear...

442
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
Dear...

443
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,120
It won't work out.

444
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,080
What if your dad take this 
issue to the public?

445
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,120
How do I face it?

446
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,600
You need not worry about it.

447
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,560
My dad won't act 
against my will.

448
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,400
You can focus on the requisites.

449
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Okay.

450
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Dear...

451
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,560
Are you sure that you will 
stick to your promise?

452
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,680
Wait a minute.

453
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
How are you Mr. goldsmith? 
- Not bad.

454
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,240
You are smart enough to be wealthy.

455
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
Ward of the evil eye.

456
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,760
We are thieves, but this 
thief will steal from us.

457
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,120
It's Senthatti's.

458
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
This one's Eepuli.

459
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,280
This one... 
Soathumootti..

460
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,600
This one... 
Soathumootti..

461
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,360
Isn't this, your work? 
- Hey...

462
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,480
Mockery? 
- I was just trolling.

463
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,960
Mockery? 
- I was just trolling.

464
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
I'm being generic.

465
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,040
These tiny ornaments 
and kids jewellery...

466
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
Won't matter much.

467
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,240
They can't earn your 
food and liquor.

468
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
He is accurate.

469
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,080
Do something that will 
settle your lives.

470
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,680
This is what bad 
friendship gifts you.

471
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
It will make you lose 
your beloved ones.

472
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,080
I witnessed that eye 
worthy phenomenon.

473
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,000
When 'Chevalai' embraced you...

474
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,520
You slit its throat in a jiffy.

475
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,800
You slit its throat in a jiffy.

476
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,320
Someday we will be substituted for 
the goat. - Please be quiet.

477
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Go...

478
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,120
What happened?

479
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,120
You can't claim anything 
that's not yours.

480
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Even the food.

481
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,120
The body repels the stolen food.

482
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,600
The body repels the stolen food.

483
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,080
Stop rebuking. 
Was your visit the worth?

484
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,280
Stop rebuking. 
Was your visit the worth?

485
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,600
As if your son is the most 
eligible bachelor in the town.

486
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,720
Be precise.

487
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,760
Marudhappan declined the offer.

488
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,640
But God was on our side.

489
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
Semponnu agreed.

490
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,040
She has invited for the 
formalities on Friday.

491
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,480
Educate him.

492
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,360
Ask him to mend his ways.

493
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,960
Wait...

494
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Where are you going?

495
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,000
To pee.

496
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,360
Postpone it for a while..

497
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:17,520
You were the one who advised 
against it while I was a kid...

498
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,840
You were the one who advised 
against it while I was a kid...

499
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,840
Why are you speaking 
contradictorily now?

500
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,240
Look at Mr.Moral speaking 
of the principles.

501
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,040
I know what you are upto.

502
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,920
Shut up and follow my lead.

503
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,760
You are so used to scolding him 
that you can't be nice to him.

504
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
You take leave.

505
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
He earned well and 
is spending well.

506
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Pass it.

507
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Pass it to the girl.

508
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,880
Semponnu!

509
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you very much.

510
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,920
Look at the prince whom you desperately 
wanted to marry.

511
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,200
Still you haven't lost it all. 
Just say 'no'.

512
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:22,560
I will thrash him away.

513
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,440
I will thrash him away.

514
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,360
It's like digging your own grave.

515
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,720
Keep quiet. 
- Your father is to be blamed.

516
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,040
He taps to your tunes.

517
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,600
They can't even afford a plate.

518
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,200
But they are up with the traditions.

519
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,320
Let's finish the formalities 
before the auspicious time passes.

520
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,880
Marudhu, proceed with 
the formalities.

521
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,720
I want to clear certain things before that.

522
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,480
We know the stature of the groom.

523
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,440
This man managed to 
convince my daughter.

524
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,400
I don't have options.

525
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,320
I'm risking my daughter's life...

526
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,400
It's a tradition in our clan.

527
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,960
The competition held by bride's 
parents to check the groom's valor.

528
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Let him win that...

529
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,280
And fix the betrothal.

530
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,040
Why is everyone looking perplexed?

531
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,480
Such physical competitions were 
a must in my contemeporary.

532
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,320
Only the winner can get a bride.

533
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,960
But considering his condition, 
I doubt his victory.

534
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,160
Make your son consume 
the butter milk.

535
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Have it.

536
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,640
Drink.

537
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Give it.

538
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,160
Have it...

539
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,840
Have it I say...

540
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,440
What are you staring at? 
Drink it.

541
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
My fate...

542
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,280
Non sense.

543
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,840
Look at it.

544
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,800
Look at it.

545
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,560
As if grroming was the 
only missing thing.

546
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,600
Is a competition necessary 
after all this?

547
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,560
They already are 
behaving like a couple.

548
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,440
I'm sure of my 
groom's vigor.

549
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,440
But my dad's unsure.

550
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
He will win the competition.

551
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:50,000
You made me lose all my senses.

552
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,160
Like a goat chewing its prey...

553
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:03,840
My heart keeps grinding 
your thoughts.

554
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,400
I'm a lonely goat...

555
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,240
Why don't you carry 
me on your shoulders?

556
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,200
Tie me the wedding chain.

557
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,160
Tie me the wedding chain.

558
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,680
I will embrace you in the 
toe end of my saree.

559
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,960
I'm yours even if 
the world defies.

560
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,160
Take me away!

561
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Sir!

562
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,200
A guy who had tea in my shop 
looks like a thief.

563
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
Are you sure?

564
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,360
He is following the 
couple on a cycle.

565
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,600
Don't cut the wedding chain.

566
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,520
Catch those thieves. 
Spare them not.

567
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Leave them not. 
- Catch him.

568
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,920
Sign here.

569
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,640
Shall I take leave?

570
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,640
You presence is 
required in the court.

571
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,000
Shall I take the jewels?

572
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
He cut off my daughter's 
wedding chain in a flash.

573
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,360
He must not be spared.

574
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
He must repent it.

575
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
I will take care.

576
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,480
I too have a grown up daughter.

577
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,880
I can be think in your shoes. 
I'll take care.

578
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,440
Get the grooms ready for 
the rituals.

579
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,240
I'll begin the proceedings.

580
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,080
Hey!

581
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
Eat and get ready.

582
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,560
Eat atleast to bear the pain.

583
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,120
Don't ponder much. 
Start eating.

584
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,800
We will be jailed atleast for 2 to 3 years.

585
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,480
It's our end.

586
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,640
A good food will become a luxury.

587
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,320
We could have been stayed 
happy with petty crimes.

588
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,440
The smith is to be blamed.

589
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
I will...

590
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,480
The Dubaikaaran.

591
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,120
Who is he referring to?

592
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:51,800
A lady?

593
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,760
A lady?

594
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,160
The lady sheperd.

595
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,680
Where would have they gone? 
- Not sure.

596
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,680
Search!

597
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,320
Who is it?

598
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,080
Throw the light.

599
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
Look over there.

600
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,920
Who are you?

601
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,600
What are you doing in the pen? 
Dad!

602
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,360
I'm a localite, madam.

603
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
I'm popularly known as 'Dubaaikarar'. 
- That's fine.

604
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,000
What are you doing here?

605
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,160
Some thieves had stolen our jewels.

606
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,000
We are in search of them.

607
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,160
None came here.

608
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,880
None came here.

609
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,320
You are disturbing 
a lonely girl.

610
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,000
Sorry! 
Come on guys.

611
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
I'm disturbed.

612
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,840
I got my only daughter married 
with a great difficulty.

613
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,840
They stole all the jewels.

614
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,520
Let alone the jewels.

615
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,960
She got married in the morning.

616
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,480
They cut off her wedding 
chain in a few hours.

617
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,920
It's all her fate.

618
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,440
None to be blamed.

619
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,320
I'll take leave.

620
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
Take care.

621
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Sir.

622
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,360
Catch them.

623
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,920
Don't let your anger cool off.

624
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:03,560
Sustain the anger.

625
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,440
Sustain the anger.

626
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,960
We will slay when time assists.

627
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,360
They have been remanded for 15 days.

628
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,000
They will be jailed for atleast 2 
years when judgment is passed.

629
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,440
Can I talk to them?

630
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,920
How much do you have?

631
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,120
Make it quick.

632
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Senthatti!

633
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,280
Why did you do it?

634
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,720
Why is he pointing me?

635
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
How long will you be serving us?

636
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
We wanted to repay.

637
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,440
So...

638
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,160
A new plan?

639
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,600
I have bribed the cops.

640
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,600
None will beat you up.

641
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,520
I have some money. 
Hide it up.

642
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
I heard you get things in jail.

643
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,080
I have a good news for you.

644
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,160
The three musketeers pals...

645
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Have been arrested in a looting case.

646
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,320
Good they got nabbed.

647
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,080
Come here.

648
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,600
Come I say.

649
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,120
Pechi!

650
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Pechi!

651
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,520
What? 
- Get some sesame oil.

652
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,400
Where were you?

653
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,520
Town... 
- I can guess.

654
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,200
Bring it.

655
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,840
Apply on his head.

656
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,760
What are you staring at? 
Apply it.

657
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,400
Bend over. Let me apply. 
- Bend.

658
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,560
Apply generously.

659
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,480
Go and get immersed in water 
and wish for evils things to ward off.

660
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Is it cooked enough? 
- Yes.

661
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,280
Switch off the flame. 
- Dear!

662
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,000
Why are you so tensed?

663
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,520
Maayan is missing.

664
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,920
What are you blabbering?

665
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,440
He must somewhere around here.

666
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,680
He is nowhere around here.

667
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
He couldn't be found.

668
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,400
Its us who has to repent the most.

669
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,360
It was you who poisoned my 
daughter's thoughts and...

670
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,120
To be blamed for this situation. 
Why are you shedding fake tears now?

671
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,960
We didn't imagine this situation.

672
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,400
You don't deserve to justify.

673
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,880
This is how you convinced my daughter 
with your sugar coated words.

674
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
Forget it, Marudhu.

675
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,720
Let's think of the alternative. 
- No room for thoughts.

676
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,600
My nephew is right here.

677
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,120
Let him marry my daughter 
on the scheduled time.

678
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,480
Ain't I clear?

679
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,960
Do you have anything 
to object, Nellaiah?

680
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,640
I object.

681
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,800
I wished to marry Maayan 
and wanted to become their in law.

682
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,680
Here I am. 
Period.

683
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,640
I have accepted Maayan as my husband 
taking marriage out of the equation.

684
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,920
I can't accept anyone else.

685
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,200
You have a fair argument.

686
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,760
But he is absconded.

687
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,160
Did he abscond himself or 
someone instigated him to?

688
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,720
My nephew should marry my daughter.

689
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,720
That's possible only if you agree.

690
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,000
I will even fall on your feet. 
- Why are you stooping so low?

691
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,600
What's your final decision?

692
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,520
I have decided to be his better half.

693
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,520
Shut up.

694
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,240
I will slay you.

695
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,680
Don't try to threaten.

696
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,720
I won't surrender to your intimidation.

697
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,960
I will leave. I won't marry 
her even if she wishes to.

698
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,080
The groom is hurt.

699
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,240
I have an alternative.

700
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,080
What?

701
00:57:59,880 --> 00:57:59,920
'The flock is missing'

702
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,560
'The flock is missing'

703
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,240
'What would he have done to them?'

704
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,760
'What do I sell to booze?'

705
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,440
Are you worried thinking so?

706
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,000
Worry not. My daughter in law 
has taken them to graze.

707
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,760
You assumed that the marriage 
will be stopped if you abscond?

708
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
We had a practice in our clan.

709
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,480
Some had married in this 
way when I was young.

710
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,280
There were no vehicles back then.

711
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,560
Months would fly by, by the 
time men are back from grazing.

712
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,000
It's impossible to find 
where men have laid a pen.

713
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,920
They have to come in person.

714
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,640
So there was a custom 
to marry such men.

715
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,600
Groom's thoratti (tool for plucking leaves) will be assumed 
to be the groom and groom's mother/sister will tie the knot.

716
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,160
Presuming the groom has tied it, they will 
resume their wed life on his actual return.

717
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,800
This is our custom.

718
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,800
Hey Maaya!

719
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
None is here.

720
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,040
I'm talking to you. 
- I can understand.

721
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,320
You are the one who stole in 
your own pen, aren't you?

722
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,680
My dad has disclosed everything.

723
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,320
Agreeing to marry you is 
an applaudable thing.

724
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,920
On top of it, you want to 
defame me by absconding.

725
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,880
I will...

726
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,760
I didn't deliberately do it.

727
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,120
Face me if you are brave enough.

728
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,440
I am no coward.

729
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,920
Proceed.

730
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,440
You dad is to be blamed.

731
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,240
Do you blindly obey him?

732
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,840
Will you oblige him if he 
asks to drown in a well?

733
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,000
Never.

734
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Fine.

735
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,080
Why did you come here?

736
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,240
To play games.

737
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,520
For obvious reasons.

738
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,080
Just like that. 
- Legally she is my wife.

739
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,080
Liquor and spicy food...

740
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:10,320
And you wanted me for 
your other pleasures.

741
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,920
And you wanted me for 
your other pleasures.

742
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,560
I'll mince your meat and 
make marinade of it.

743
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,640
I didn't marry you 
for physical pleasure.

744
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,720
The man who wanted to make 
you a respectable man.

745
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,520
Your poor father who was 
ready to fall on my feet.

746
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,440
I married you for his sake.

747
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,320
Do you know how I 
sensed your arrival?

748
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,400
Liquor odor.

749
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:45,440
In our custom we even keep 
our sheep neat and tidy.

750
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,200
But look at your appearance.

751
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,200
The beard makes you 
look like a gypsy.

752
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,680
A good shepherd is identified 
by odor of sheep stink.

753
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,000
The day you smell so...

754
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,320
Will be the day when we 
consumate our marriage.

755
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,160
Get lost from my sight.

756
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,480
Get lost.

757
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,200
But look at your appearance.

758
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,120
The beard makes you 
look like a gypsy.

759
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,840
Maaya!

760
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,600
What are you doing here?

761
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,720
Just sitting casually.

762
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,360
You have been causal 
all the while.

763
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,000
Now you are married.

764
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,320
The sunset...

765
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,600
Should remind home.

766
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,600
He is an ideal family man.

767
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,120
Got it?

768
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,880
Come.

769
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680
Come on.

770
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,640
Dear...

771
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,440
Where's your mother in law? 
- She is inside.

772
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,960
Pass the fruits.

773
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,320
I have obliged all her commands.

774
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,560
She doesn't thrown even a glimpse.

775
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,600
There it is.

776
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,040
Mother in law...

777
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,440
You wanted to prepare a marinade...

778
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,360
Bring the knife...

779
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,600
At this time?

780
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,400
What's the urgency?

781
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,960
We can prepare it 
in the morning.

782
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,320
Shall we start? 
- Hmm..

783
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,200
MGR movie is being played in a 
nearby touring talkies.

784
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,640
We will go watch it...

785
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
And will be back by the morning.

786
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,760
Don't go today.

787
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,880
Go when I ask you to.

788
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,880
He doesn't have a 
presence of mind at all.

789
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,520
Look into that matter.

790
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,200
Come aside.

791
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,400
Is it that time of the month?

792
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,360
Then why not today?

793
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,120
Let your son forfeit drinking 
and become an ideal husband.

794
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
Then let me decide.

795
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,360
You fool.

796
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,160
You are yet to read men's mind.

797
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,440
We will leave.

798
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,080
What's it? 
- I'll let you know.

799
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,560
Be gentle.

800
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:17,760
She is threatening me to slay. 
You are asking me to be gentle.

801
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,200
She is threatening me to slay. 
You are asking me to be gentle.

802
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,360
I'm not someone who can't 
harness temptations.

803
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,440
I'm not sure how you judge me.

804
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,640
I'm not sure if I am a 
good son to my parents.

805
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,920
But for you... 
- Don't talk!

806
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,200
She is gesturing me to shut up.

807
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,800
Can you rub with your hands?

808
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,280
This will do.

809
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,240
Enough? 
- Rub it well.

810
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,120
Pass it over.

811
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,360
He is thoroughly wet.

812
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,880
What's it?

813
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,720
Have it.

814
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,280
Take this.

815
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,480
Have it.

816
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:15,720
Take this.

817
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,760
Take this.

818
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,680
Serve him something as well.

819
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,640
Keep it over there.

820
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,440
Mother in law...

821
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,040
MGR movie is being played in the 
nearby touring talkies.

822
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,840
Go watch the movie and 
comeback in the morning.

823
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,400
We had already watched it.

824
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,960
Today is the occasion.

825
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,680
Let's go.

826
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,920
God knows how many more times 
we need to watch the movie.

827
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:13,480
You gave me a soapy bath.

828
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:22,440
And washed my dirt away.

829
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:31,560
You make me go round you 
like a goat in a pen.

830
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:39,960
You make seek something 
like a spatula in a vessel.

831
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,560
Even the goat faeces smell...

832
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,840
Like jasmine.

833
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:57,680
You gave me a soapy bath.

834
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:06,600
And washed my dirt away.

835
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:53,000
You grab my soul in the 
toe end of your saree.

836
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:01,800
You make nights a memorable ones.

837
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:10,440
You resurrected my spoilt life.

838
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:19,360
You made a lowly man 
reach heights.

839
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:19,680
You won my ego through 
your determination.

840
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:28,360
You won over my mom through 
your motherly love.

841
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:36,960
You showered an unadulterated love.

842
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:46,000
The nature essays stories of you.

843
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:10,360
You gave me a soapy bath.

844
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:18,560
And washed my dirt away.

845
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,200
Must taste a good non veg 
meal after we are out.

846
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,800
Yes. Liquor with a good snack.

847
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:37,240
Yes that too.

848
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,040
Yes that too.

849
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
Dubaikaaran?

850
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Hey guys.

851
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,600
Seem to be new around here. 
- Yes we are.

852
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,680
We are slaughter house dealers.

853
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,120
We heard that Dubaikaarar 
cows are for sale.

854
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:09,640
But his house is locked.

855
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,080
But his house is locked.

856
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,640
He shifted his family 
to Dubai 2 months ago.

857
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,160
Here you are to visit him.

858
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,080
When will they come back?

859
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,920
Its hard to predict a 
localite's travel.

860
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,920
They have gone to another nation. 
None knows about their return.

861
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,280
Look at the way they are staring.

862
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,400
Why are you here all alone?

863
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Where is the flock 
taken for grazing?

864
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,120
They are grazing.

865
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,440
You seem to have 
come with a plan.

866
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,560
I'm warning you.

867
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:06,880
Just now I bathed as 
its an auspicious day.

868
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,720
Just now I bathed as 
its an auspicious day.

869
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,800
I can't bathe again 
to risk my health.

870
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,640
I'll gently dry your hair.

871
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,320
You are acting very childish.

872
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,160
Your credit is Rs.33 including this.

873
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,640
Clear it before you pass away.

874
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,920
Here comes sir.

875
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,080
Get down. 
Careful.

876
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:16,160
Those three thieves... 
- Hold on...

877
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,840
Those three thieves... 
- Hold on...

878
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,120
You have arrived to 
grandpa's house.

879
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,440
Be careful.

880
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,920
Proceed.

881
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,320
The shepherd lady.

882
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,880
Stop.

883
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,720
Hold on. 
You are acting like a lunatic.

884
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,640
Look around.

885
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,880
If you act now, 
she will be safe.

886
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,240
But we will be trapped.

887
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:16,680
Let the sunset and darkness spread...

888
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,080
Let the sunset and darkness spread...

889
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,200
We will let her soul pass in silence.

890
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,400
Let's follow his plan.

891
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,680
Who is in charge of the pen?

892
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,720
Who is it? 
- We are from the next village.

893
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,440
We are taking the forest route. 
Can you fetch us some water.

894
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,680
Please wait.

895
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,960
What happened? 
- Leg numbness.

896
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,840
As I have been sitting in 
the same posture.

897
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,600
Here is the water.

898
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Who is it?

899
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,480
Guys!!

900
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,200
Senthatti, Soathumootti... 
Wait...

901
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Eepuli...

902
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:09,920
Have you gone deaf?

903
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,880
Have you gone deaf?

904
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,040
Senthatti! 
Wait.

905
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:14,680
When were you released?

906
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,120
When were you released?

907
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,280
Don't show off your attitude.

908
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,160
What's was wrong from my end?

909
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,960
Who are they? 
- I get it.

910
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,640
You are gesturing that I forgot 
you guys after getting married.

911
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,160
Isn't that the reason?

912
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:31,480
Did you forget the past? 
- You are being sarcastic.

913
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,680
Did you forget the past? 
- You are being sarcastic.

914
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,400
Did you atleast once 
visit us in the jail?

915
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,960
I agree. 
It's my mistake.

916
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
I apologize.

917
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,520
You can punish me if you wish to.

918
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,840
But being angry 
isn't the solution.

919
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,960
Shall I fall on your feet?

920
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,640
I will feel disappointed 
if you won't eat.

921
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,120
Please come.

922
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,560
Just follow me without creating a scene.

923
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,040
You too, Soathumooti.

924
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,000
Just dine. We can discuss 
other things in the morning.

925
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,000
What's the curry?

926
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,400
It's your favourite 
marinade curry.

927
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,600
Come on.

928
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,400
Come on, guys.

929
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,760
Who are these guys?

930
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,120
Why are you pleading them?

931
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,560
Friends! 
- Friends?

932
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,200
Seems to be new ones.

933
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,240
Since when? 
- My old mates.

934
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,880
They had gone out of station 
for an official purpose.

935
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,440
Just now they have come back.

936
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,400
I smell something fishy.

937
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,480
We will just let them dine 
and send off.

938
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,680
I'll explain the rest, later.

939
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,640
Okay, get them inside.

940
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,800
Come in.

941
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,360
She has no idea about 
your imprisonment.

942
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:15,680
Don't spill it out.

943
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,720
Don't spill it out.

944
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,880
Won't she allow you to join 
us if she knows the truth?

945
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,280
Your are not open 
about your thoughts.

946
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,040
Be quiet for a while. 
Let's discuss it later.

947
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,400
Don't create a ruckus.

948
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,320
Why are you behaving oddly?

949
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,960
They are high on alcohol.

950
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,240
Who is on high?

951
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,160
Can you imagine the consequences 
if our identity is revealed?

952
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,720
Don't raise your volume. 
She might hear it.

953
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,000
If you are so submissive, why 
did you invite us for dinner?

954
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,880
I know who you really are.

955
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:10,120
My father in law has told enough 
stories about you spoiling my husband.

956
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,880
I didn't trust his words then.

957
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,480
But I trust him now. 
- Semponnu.

958
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,120
Why are you raising your voice?

959
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,440
Why are you raising your voice?

960
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,400
Friends from the outstation?

961
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,280
Their faces clearly show that 
they are prisoners.

962
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,840
They are so desperate 
for meat and rice.

963
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,240
Get lost.

964
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,400
Listen... Ignore her.

965
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:41,600
Don't go.

966
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,200
Don't go.

967
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,040
You are so inhumane 
to understand them.

968
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,240
Senthatti... 
- A word is enough for a sensible man.

969
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,320
Remember this for ever.

970
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,120
Never ever meet my husband again.

971
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,480
Have it.

972
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,840
Eat.

973
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,240
What are you staring at? 
- Hold the plate.

974
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,560
You were tapping to my tunes.

975
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,800
Now you are raising your 
voice on their return.

976
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,120
Do you think I will be your 
puppet as I'm your wife?

977
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,160
I'm not a typical woman 
who idolizes her husband.

978
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,160
Be clear if you are 
prioritizing their friendship.

979
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,480
I will get separated.

980
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,000
What did I say? 
- Don't think I will go back to my home.

981
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,720
I will manage of my own.

982
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,160
Why are you so vocal?

983
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,040
You will bring them to dine.

984
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,880
Then you will steal sheep 
for their monetary needs.

985
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,800
If I bend to your requests...

986
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,800
We will soon become bankrupt.

987
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,800
They are like fleas on sheep.

988
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,600
Cut off them, else they 
will dig your grave.

989
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,000
You are lying to 
your very own wife.

990
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,760
Do you really need this friendship?

991
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Think.

992
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,400
Eat.

993
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,840
He has fallen asleep. 
Pass it over.

994
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,600
Unfortunately she is 
now Maayan's wife.

995
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,000
She didn't identify us.

996
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,480
Fortunately we had 
masked our faces.

997
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,320
Whatever may be the plan, 
Maayan shouldn't have any idea of it.

998
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,680
Don't under estimate him.

999
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,640
He chased us just for a lamb.

1000
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,840
She is his soul.

1001
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,720
If she gets killed...

1002
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:10,400
And if he knows that we did it...

1003
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,280
And if he knows that we did it...

1004
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,560
He will avenge us for sure.

1005
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:17,760
Dude.

1006
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,720
Dude.

1007
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,840
It wasn't a true friendship.

1008
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,680
It was friendship for 
meat and marinade.

1009
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,240
But...

1010
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,520
That's right.

1011
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,760
Lets slay her first.

1012
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,960
If he intersects our 
plan, it's his fate.

1013
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,120
We are not to be blamed.

1014
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,880
Let's finish him as well.

1015
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,360
We must not carry the sin 
of separating a couple.

1016
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,880
Soathumooti, I haven't changed.

1017
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,320
It's them who have changed.

1018
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:13,760
What are you staring at?

1019
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,040
She is a woman.

1020
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,360
Being raucous is a woman's attribute.

1021
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,720
Even my father had insulted you a lot.

1022
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,800
My father had instigated her against you.

1023
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,200
She gets agitated while 
speaking of you.

1024
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,040
The way I used to slip away 
from my father's sight...

1025
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,280
Similarly I'll fool 
my wife to meet you.

1026
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,560
Are we your lady love 
to meet in private?

1027
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,240
I deserved this treatment. 
- Maaya!

1028
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,080
We aren't angry.

1029
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,400
As Soaththumooti 
said we were high.

1030
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,160
So we crossed the line. 
- Why are they acting nice?

1031
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,360
Don't know what will happen to Maayan?

1032
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,800
I have to tell him the truth.

1033
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Why are you looking perplexed?

1034
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,640
Maayan has brought a 
sheep to make curry.

1035
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,720
It was you who said it has been a 
while since we tasted good food. - Me?

1036
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
Go to the shop...

1037
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,320
Get liquor and 
ingredients for curry.

1038
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,560
Maaya, give him some money.

1039
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,320
Go and get it fast.

1040
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,680
Come on.

1041
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,360
Sit.

1042
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,560
Forget it. 
Stop talking about it.

1043
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,520
Maayan is at risk. 
- Didn't you leave?

1044
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,480
Hurry up.

1045
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,160
Why are you being harsh?

1046
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:32,440
Only if he hurry him up, 
we can booze.

1047
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,320
Only if he hurry him up, 
we can booze.

1048
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,480
Your focus is always on booze.

1049
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,760
It fills the occasion. 
- Dude...

1050
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,960
Dude, cops are here. 
- Cops?

1051
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,840
Why are they here?

1052
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,760
Leave us. 
- Why are you arresting us?

1053
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,560
Don't act like an innocent kid.

1054
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,440
You were released last morning.

1055
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,160
You have looted a jewellery 
shop the same night.

1056
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,160
We did say that we didn't loot it. 
- You didn't...

1057
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,160
Let's discuss in the station.

1058
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,640
I'll break the other one as well.

1059
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:23,840
Undress..

1060
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,320
Undress..

1061
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,400
Hey! 
- Sir.

1062
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,640
Do you want a special addressal?

1063
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,200
Undress, you idiot.

1064
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:31,600
I didn't commit any crime.

1065
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,840
I didn't commit any crime.

1066
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,880
I have no connection with the loot.

1067
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,120
Undress. 
- I swear I don't know.

1068
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,480
Won't you oblige?

1069
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,960
I will thrash you.

1070
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,120
Dressed like a groom.

1071
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,960
What are you staring at?

1072
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,520
Remove the lower.

1073
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:58,360
Undress.... 
Undress this apparel as well.

1074
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,160
Hasten it.

1075
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:05,520
Hold and undress him.

1076
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,640
Remove it.

1077
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,000
Tear it up.

1078
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,760
Hold it, moron.

1079
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,280
Only last night, I advised him.

1080
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,760
After all the sermon, he 
has taken a sheep for them.

1081
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,400
Such a stubborn he is.

1082
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,840
Such a stubborn he is.

1083
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,840
Am I a fool?

1084
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,200
What happened?

1085
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:52,600
He must repent.

1086
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,240
He must repent.

1087
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,280
Preaching won't change his ways.

1088
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,720
This incident will.

1089
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,400
If you release him...

1090
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,040
Let alone me... 
Even the God can't mend his ways.

1091
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,280
It's not that you alone are worried, 
I'm equally worried as well.

1092
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,720
When I saw his bloody face...

1093
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,840
I was almost dead.

1094
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,680
Sweeter words won't reach him.

1095
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,880
It will be soothing to him.

1096
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,280
He has to suffer.

1097
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,400
Only then he will change his ways.

1098
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,440
You won't admit?

1099
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,720
I swear on Karuppu (God), 
I didn't do it.

1100
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,680
Who is that?

1101
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,080
Your partner in crime?

1102
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:55,040
You didn't repent even 
after losing a hand.

1103
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,800
Pick up the phone.

1104
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:58,240
He is available, sir.

1105
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,920
He is available, sir.

1106
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,160
It's for you.

1107
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,320
Hello... 
Yes...

1108
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,160
Found it?

1109
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,520
Where?

1110
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,360
Kerala border?

1111
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,160
Is it?

1112
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:12,760
Fine.

1113
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,880
Fine.

1114
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,080
Release them.

1115
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,160
Get their thumb prints as 
a precautionary. - Okay.

1116
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,920
Stop Maaya.

1117
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,520
Wait Maaya.

1118
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,280
Why are you angry with us? 
We have no part in this.

1119
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,000
You are not be blamed. 
But I am.

1120
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:49,960
Now I realise why people 
begged not to befriend you.

1121
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,880
Now I realise why people 
begged not to befriend you.

1122
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,000
You didn't feel ashamed when the 
cops scolded and stripped you off.

1123
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,880
But I wanted to strangle 
myself to death.

1124
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,800
Let me go. 
I have a different life to lead.

1125
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,440
But I can't turn away from you 
living in the same place.

1126
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,360
I will lead a life somewhere else.

1127
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,520
But till that, don't disturb me. 
That's all I request you.

1128
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,920
Maayan is here.

1129
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,640
They have beaten 
him up like a dog.

1130
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,640
I curse them to lose their limb.

1131
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,720
Stop sobbing.

1132
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,600
Did someone pass away?

1133
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:54,080
Semponnu, prepare for my bath.

1134
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,840
Semponnu, prepare for my bath.

1135
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:56,720
I want to end their relationship.

1136
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,200
I want to end their relationship.

1137
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,400
Dad, let's leave this place.

1138
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,960
You people tried your best.

1139
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,000
It fell on my deafened ears. 
But now I have realised it.

1140
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:12,880
I didn't foresee such things.

1141
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,680
I didn't foresee such things.

1142
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:15,600
Your words of wisdom stuck me 
when I was beaten up to shame.

1143
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,720
Your words of wisdom stuck me 
when I was beaten up to shame.

1144
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,560
Lesson learnt.

1145
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,400
I will be cautious henceforth.

1146
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,120
Lets shift to someother place?

1147
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:38,520
People from our clan have 
set a pen near Thanjavur.

1148
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:39,240
It's a fertile land.

1149
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,200
It's a fertile land.

1150
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,520
Shall we move there?

1151
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,600
Is it okay with you?

1152
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,560
The water has boiled enough.

1153
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,560
I will prepare the baggage.

1154
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,240
We will take leave.

1155
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,680
I'll take bath. 
- You assist my mother.

1156
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,080
Don't mistake me.

1157
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,840
I followed my mom's steps 
when I was a toddler.

1158
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,520
Then my father was 
everything to me.

1159
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,600
Then I befriended these guys.

1160
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,040
Then you become my world.

1161
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,840
I had enough.

1162
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,520
I lead the life of a creeper 
depending on someone.

1163
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,120
I want to be independent.

1164
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,960
Hey Maaya, am I a fool?

1165
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,920
You will not bother about 
the sheep and come to me.

1166
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,000
I have to oblige you.

1167
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,640
But when I show ominous signs...

1168
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,000
You won't read it.

1169
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:54,480
Are you pretending?

1170
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,880
Are you pretending?

1171
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,640
You are good for nothing.

1172
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,240
Mother in law...

1173
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,320
Are they playing any MGR 
movie in the talkies?

1174
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,320
Mother in law...

1175
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,600
Mother in law...

1176
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,120
MGR movie...

1177
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,600
You crush my soul...

1178
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:32,680
With your love.

1179
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,480
You wipe away the shyness

1180
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,280
and eat me swiftly.

1181
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:51,760
You feed me enough to 
eternity.

1182
01:34:51,760 --> 01:35:00,640
Your saliva tastes sweet 
as Iluppai flower.

1183
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:06,760
Lets freeze the 
moment to death.

1184
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:19,000
Let's unify even 
if death defies it.

1185
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,720
She must not live 
happily with Maayan.

1186
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,560
Why are you looking perplexed?

1187
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,800
He is right. 
You are not trustworthy.

1188
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,480
Swear on God.

1189
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,760
Come on.

1190
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,240
Don't do it.

1191
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,560
Control your anger.

1192
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,040
Swear before it goes off.

1193
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,400
Please, listen to me.

1194
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,840
Promise us.

1195
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:19,760
Do it. 
- I can't. Why should I?

1196
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:22,240
Do it. 
- I can't. Why should I?

1197
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,000
Taking God's company to 
commit an evil act.

1198
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,480
What huge mistake did she commit?

1199
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:29,400
She got us nabbed...

1200
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,320
She got us nabbed...

1201
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,440
Only when she came to know when 
we cut off the wedding chain.

1202
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,720
I gestured him against it.

1203
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,960
It's all because of that sin.

1204
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,160
Every women wishes her 
husband to be a good man.

1205
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:43,960
She did the same.

1206
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,520
Enough.

1207
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,760
We have exploited him too much.

1208
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,760
I will not take part in this.

1209
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,320
Relieve me.

1210
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,040
Let’s part our ways.

1211
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,320
Let’s part our ways.

1212
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,480
I will somehow take care of myself.

1213
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,320
Lets end it here.

1214
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,960
There should be atleast 
some traces of courtesy.

1215
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,680
He had served us meat and 
marinade treating us like kin.

1216
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,800
How did you even think of 
harming his family?

1217
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,520
Ran a thorn?

1218
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,440
It's not a good sign.

1219
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,000
Showing off! 
Let's go.

1220
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,520
Showing off! 
Let's go.

1221
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,160
Answer him. 
Is your mouth stuffed?

1222
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,720
We had promised to 
share grief or joy.

1223
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
Let me go.

1224
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,480
Leave me.

1225
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,160
Leave me.

1226
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,280
Where are you going? 
- No not far.

1227
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,840
I will go get the payment. 
- Return soon.

1228
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,520
What happened?

1229
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,600
Hurt? 
- Nothing.

1230
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,080
Rest a while before you leave.

1231
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,280
It's okay, mom. 
- Atleast drink some water.

1232
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,400
You should have noticed the stone.

1233
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,560
Fetch it fast.

1234
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,840
Give it to him. 
- The water is silted.

1235
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,080
It's okay.

1236
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:02,440
Water shouldn't be wasted. 
Have it.

1237
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,400
Water shouldn't be wasted. 
Have it.

1238
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,800
Shall I climb and shake it?

1239
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,520
Ignore it.

1240
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,480
You separated Maayan 
from us as we feared.

1241
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,440
Don't force me to disgrace you. 
- Give us a fair reason.

1242
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,520
You are claiming as if 
you were true to him.

1243
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,480
I need not do anything.

1244
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:33,440
He himself has decided to 
cut off your friendship.

1245
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,280
The gentlemen claiming 
a fair reason.

1246
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,080
Didn't get it?

1247
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:27,240
We pleaded you the same way 
not to get us nabbed.

1248
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,360
We pleaded you the same way 
not to get us nabbed.

1249
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,760
But you didn't oblige.

1250
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,680
What's your problem if a 
stranger's life is spoilt?

1251
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,080
Will the Dubaikkaran save you now?

1252
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,960
Please leave me. 
- We can't.

1253
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,400
We have suffered a 
lot because of you.

1254
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,920
You can't be spared.

1255
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,960
Drown her.

1256
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:02,960
If someone creates a ruckus 
after drinking our liquor...

1257
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:07,200
Most lose their sense after a booze. 
Then how will they create a ruckus?

1258
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,600
Help me.

1259
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,120
Save me...

1260
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,960
A girl is screaming.

1261
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,560
Come let's go. 
- Yes.

1262
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,640
What are you doing?

1263
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,120
Performing a ritual.

1264
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,920
Mind your business.

1265
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,240
You are committing some crime.

1266
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,240
I heard a girl screaming.

1267
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,400
Don't do it.

1268
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,400
A women's curse will torement 
you for ever.

1269
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,360
Your daughter is married 
in Sokkaampatti, right?

1270
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,360
I saw her with a baby bump.

1271
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,000
Maaya!

1272
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,440
Semponnu is missing after 
she went to fetch water.

1273
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,720
Not sure what happened to Semponnu.

1274
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:46,000
Nothing bad will happen 
for a good man like you.

1275
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,840
It's inside.

1276
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,480
Someone assist him.

1277
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:06,720
One can't carry it alone.

1278
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,640
One can't carry it alone.

1279
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,760
This is true friendship.

1280
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,400
They were spontaneous. 
None of us did.

1281
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,280
They were so close. 
They will come in need.

1282
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:54,520
Her soul has ascended 
into the heaven.

1283
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:00,200
She silently slipped away.

1284
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:14,440
A generous lady who can never 
think of harming anyone.

1285
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:21,680
The quiescence earth is its witness.

1286
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,440
Her humanity was matchless 
across the nations.

1287
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:41,680
Her benevolence outweighs 
the wealth across the nations.

1288
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:47,520
A girl with the heart of 
gold is a rare find.

1289
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:57,200
She matched the efforts of ten...

1290
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:04,960
None could match her 
meticulous grazing skill.

1291
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:21,760
None of the Gods came to her rescue?

1292
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:29,120
Neither could her good 
deeds save her.

1293
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,880
Can the earth consume 
her own golden child?

1294
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:44,520
Will the God turn a blind eye to this?

1295
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:47,160
Nothing bad will happen 
for a good man like you.

1296
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,120
This is true friendship.

1297
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,760
They were spontaneous.

1298
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:59,280
They are like a fleece on a sheep.

1299
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,880
Cut off their friendhsip. 
Else, they will dig your grave.

1300
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,320
I suspect Maayan's 
friends behind her death.

1301
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,600
I noticed finger marks on 
Semponnu's neck while bathing her.

1302
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,560
Maaya.

1303
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,440
I know that you will 
cook meat for them.

1304
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:14,880
I prepared it to 
reduce your burden.

1305
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,760
I prepared it to 
reduce your burden.

1306
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,280
Return soon.

1307
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,960
There is a ritual to 
be held for Semponnunu. - Ok.

1308
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,080
Till then you have to fast. 
Not even a drop of water.

1309
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,280
You know it, right?

1310
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:38,760
Go.

1311
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,640
Maaya...

1312
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,440
You always get the sheep and 
prepare the curry here.

1313
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,040
This seems to be new.

1314
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,520
Soathumooti is missing?

1315
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,000
He was the one who missed 
the meat, the most.

1316
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:45,480
We have set him a task. 
He will be back soon.

1317
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,240
Come eat.

1318
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,200
For whom are you taking it?

1319
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,640
For Soathumootti.

1320
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,720
It's not poisoned.

1321
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,760
You can have it without any doubt.

1322
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,280
Just like a snake preys its 
own snakelet, you killed him.

1323
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,360
We will spare you just for 
the sake of our friendship.

1324
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,440
Embrace your life and leave.

1325
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,120
I have made my mind 
'Not to spare you'.

1326
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,640
You boast your valour 
to a lonely lady.

1327
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,400
Maaya, don't do it.

1328
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,200
Please...

1329
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,360
With these very hands I have 
slaughtered many sheeps for you.

1330
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,200
But you butchered my very own soul.

1331
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,240
I will...

1332
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:33,040
You have 'n' number of 
reasons to murder her.

1333
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:37,480
'She was my wife.' 
Wasn't this reason sufficient to spare her?

1334
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:42,720
I was just your meat provisioner.

1335
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,760
Just think of the past.

1336
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,360
Did you?

1337
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:50,640
Did you? - Atleast spare us for the 
sake of saving you and your father.

1338
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,840
Shedding crocodile tears?

1339
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:55,440
You took me for granted?

1340
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,000
You took me for granted?

1341
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,200
If I kill my very own friends...

1342
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,400
I will fall in your category.

1343
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:29,640
You shall reap what you sowed.

1344
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,120
Cold blooded animals.

1345
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,360
The food has turned blue.

1346
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,760
He has poisoned the food...

1347
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,760
And preaches like an ideal man.

1348
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,480
You nose is bleeding.

1349
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,440
Is it the one? 
- of course. Yes.

1350
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,920
It's their end.

1351
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:32,560
The liquor seller has avenged us.

1352
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,520
Come on, guys.

1353
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,320
Let's drink this tamarind 
extract and puke out.

1354
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,560
We can save ourselves.

1355
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:04,160
How did he come here?

1356
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,040
How did he come here?

1357
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,600
I will slay if you get up.

1358
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,480
Thirsty... 
Water...
