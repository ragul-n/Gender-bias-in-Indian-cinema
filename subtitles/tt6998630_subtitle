1
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,786
Mr. Jeevan.

2
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,050
Excuse me sir. He
is calling you.

3
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:57,917
Welcome.

4
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:58,912
Come in Jeevan.

5
00:02:59,249 --> 00:02:59,995
Have a seat.

6
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,778
I was expecting you.

7
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:06,988
Damn! That was an awesome novel!

8
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,426
The emotions in your writing are
so real! You have proved yourself!

9
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:11,712
I was touched.

10
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:13,583
How old are you?

11
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:14,898
I am 28 years old sir.

12
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,200
So, a young writer?

13
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:18,010
Good. Good.

14
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:19,336
Him first.

15
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:20,359
Have some tea.

16
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,946
Your age doesn't reflect
your experience.

17
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,373
Such a wonderful creativity.

18
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,309
Your work lives up to your name,
i.e, Jeevan (Meaning: Life)!

19
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,786
- Congratulations.
- Thank you sir.

20
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:34,785
Congratulations Jeevan.

21
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,656
So, I hear that you are
the next award winner?

22
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,142
Remember, the publishing
rights are mine.

23
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:38,856
Sounds good?

24
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,791
13 bundles of your
novel are unsold.

25
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:45,816
Jeevan, your stories
are outdated.

26
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,980
Think of something better.

27
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:52,104
We need sales to rocket
like it used to.

28
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,520
What are you looking at?
Get lost!

29
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,055
Jeevan, do you get
what I am saying?

30
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:03,015
How do you expect the cliched family
sentiment novels to make business?

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,146
We are in the 'Operation
Nova' times...

32
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:08,511
Get me an excellent horror
story or an anti-hero story.

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,979
Or at least write
an erotic novel!

34
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,264
That is the current trend!

35
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,643
Sir, let me explain.

36
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,546
Try to understand what
I have to say Jeevan.

37
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,143
Enough of your explanation.

38
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,191
My time is quite valuable.

39
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:23,213
So if you want me to pay attention
then get me something valuable.

40
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:24,101
You may leave now.

41
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:18,406
Excuse me.

42
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,625
A coffee and a cigarette please.

43
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,617
NEWS ON TV: A psycho killer
wreaks havoc in Dindugal.

44
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,042
NEWS ON TV: Creates chaos
among the locals there.

45
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,530
NEWS ON TV: Who is this mystery man?
Even after 3 months,

46
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,175
still poses a threat and challenge
to the police department?

47
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,761
NEWS ON TV: Does this serial
killer have a threshold point?

48
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,441
When will the killing stop. More
on that after a small break.

49
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,510
Sir...

50
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,423
here you go.

51
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,137
So, what happened at the
publisher's office?

52
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,092
Tell me. What happened?

53
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,118
It seems that I am outdated.

54
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,784
All my novels are...

55
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:10,822
unsold, says the publisher.

56
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,691
But ok, no problem.
Nothing to worry.

57
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:17,914
I'll take care of it.

58
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:20,834
No Jeeva!

59
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,202
It is a problem.

60
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:25,631
It won't workout.

61
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,813
It's been a week past the deadline
of two years you requested for.

62
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,668
I can't be patient anymore.

63
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,739
Over that, there is too much
pressure from my family.

64
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,194
They want to know when we are
planning to have a child.

65
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,002
Don't you think I too want it?

66
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,850
We must start a proper
family life soon.

67
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,202
And for that, you must
be in a good job Jeeva.

68
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,924
Forget all this art,
writing and creativity...

69
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:57,620
and start looking for a job that
suits your qualification. Please!

70
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:01,110
We can't run a family with
my income alone Jeeva.

71
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,949
Start being responsible.

72
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,983
Stop blaming others and...

73
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,893
I suggest you better
find a suitable job.

74
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:07,914
Do you understand?

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,889
Jeeva, I am talking to you!

76
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:13,907
Jeeva.

77
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,278
Jeeva?

78
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,358
VOICE ON TV: A snake’s
eyes aren't very good...

79
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,294
VOICE ON TV: but they can detect movement.

80
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,564
VOICE ON TV: So if the
hatchling keeps its nerve...

81
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,843
VOICE ON TV: it may
just avoid detection.

82
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:21,520
(Voice on TV continues.)

83
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,817
2 packs of cigarettes please.

84
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,324
So, everything is packed up.

85
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,824
Come on, cut me some slack.

86
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,443
Didn't you hear me? Can't
you see it's closing hours.

87
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:10,685
Will you pay the fine
if the cops turn up?

88
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,352
You guys! Now leave!

89
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:15,834
Damn it! They don't get a
better time to show up!

90
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,312
Brother....

91
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,189
can I borrow a cigarette?

92
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:21,308
I'll pay up.

93
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,566
Dear!

94
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:26,612
Come here.

95
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,286
Looking for cigarette?

96
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:30,390
Do you have?

97
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,144
Please don't smoke.

98
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,127
Smoking is injurious.

99
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,786
Smoke and you shall...

100
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,572
Got it?

101
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:43,204
I am only drinking.

102
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,474
You want drink?

103
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,831
No? Ok!

104
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,268
Head to the beach.

105
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,249
You will find an oldie
selling buttermilk there.

106
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,059
He will be having.
Go buy it from him.

107
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:57,003
45 - 90 ml.... Whoa!

108
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,341
I gave him a crystal
clear solution...

109
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:01,787
and not even a thank you!

110
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,406
Manners-less boy!

111
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:24,364
The buttermilk vendor?

112
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:25,769
Go further, you’ll find him.

113
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,155
Brother...

114
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,039
can I borrow a cigarette?

115
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,232
Whoa! I am not used to this.

116
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:39,344
Give me a cigarette.

117
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,161
This is same like how you
began with cigarettes.

118
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,011
You weren't used to it either.

119
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,074
Try it out and it'll be a bliss!

120
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,715
Come on bro!

121
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,914
Only if you smoke
it you'll know.

122
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:09,401
Psycho killer!

123
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:10,497
An anti-hero story...

124
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,638
This writing! Writing!

125
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,982
Get me something valuable.

126
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,268
Art...forget all these!

127
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,222
Leave now. Get me
an anti-hero story.

128
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,776
A job that suits
your qualification!

129
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:22,769
It seems that I am outdated.

130
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:23,882
Look for a job.

131
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:24,803
Look for a job.

132
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,044
Good morning.

133
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:42,736
You better leave!

134
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,180
I am furious with you!

135
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,927
Come on! What is my fault?

136
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:48,331
What is your fault?

137
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,047
Now that you are
up, here you go.

138
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:51,681
Have this coffee.

139
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,467
Fine. I'm sorry.

140
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:55,944
It was indeed my fault.

141
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,736
Don't you understand my
situation very well?

142
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,554
I expected at least
you to support me.

143
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,314
You too hurt my feelings.

144
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:04,210
Anyways...

145
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,343
I too shouldn't have
reacted like that.

146
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,180
If you are willing
to forgive me...

147
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,657
then here, have this world-
famous coffee that I've made.

148
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,362
I would have rather kept
arguing with you instead.

149
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,529
Well, I am not surprised.

150
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:31,067
Ok.

151
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:32,884
I've got something
important to tell.

152
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:36,218
So until I'm done talking just drink
your coffee and do not interrupt me.

153
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,478
You have waited 2 years...

154
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:41,985
so please extend it a bit and
allow me 2 more months' time.

155
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,548
Everything will be
back to normal.

156
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:45,628
I am hooked on to an
exciting thriller subject.

157
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,029
The only emotion that
is always in trend...

158
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:48,626
fear!

159
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,181
That's what my story
is all about.

160
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:53,472
I will meet the publisher today, explain
him the concept and get an approval.

161
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,888
If I don't succeed...

162
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:55,864
then as you said...

163
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,069
the 62nd day...

164
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,426
I'll be in a job of your liking.

165
00:15:58,451 --> 00:15:59,045
Sounds good?

166
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,793
You sound very confident
after so long.

167
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,657
Anyway...

168
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:04,995
All the best.

169
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:05,917
Thank you.

170
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,925
The two months' extension that you asked
for starts right from this second.

171
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,870
Keep that in mind.

172
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:10,956
Definitely!

173
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:19,514
Yes Jeevan?

174
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,830
So, any breakthrough on
how to sell your novels?

175
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:24,797
Nope but I am here with an idea
to make your time valuable.

176
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,098
Didn't you ask for an
anti-hero subject?

177
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:29,995
I've portrayed a full-fledged
villain as a hero.

178
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,582
A story about an individual who envisions
murder as an art instead of crime.

179
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:35,837
I'm going to show how
he views this world.

180
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,051
The concept sounds fresh.

181
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,956
I suggest you get
started with it.

182
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,008
Thank you sir.

183
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:04,159
I'm planning on leaving to
Meghamalai tomorrow morning.

184
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,650
I'm going there to
finish my story.

185
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,475
Alone?

186
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,219
I'm taking Romeo and
Juliet with me.

187
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,498
Where are you going to stay?

188
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,816
At Kathir's guest house.

189
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,770
That's where I'll
have some privacy.

190
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,857
You take decisions
at your own will.

191
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:18,159
Fine!

192
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,794
Come back soon.

193
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,097
Or else I'll come over there.

194
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,411
One more condition.

195
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,157
Make sure you attend my calls.

196
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:29,292
Would that be all or do you
have anymore conditions?

197
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:32,061
Nothing more.

198
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,386
Leave. Take a hike!

199
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:42,286
So about this story of yours...

200
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,198
What's the title?

201
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,516
TITLE: URU
( Shape of fear)

202
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:13,368
Jeevan sir?

203
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:19,596
Jeevan sir?

204
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,311
Yeah, that's me.

205
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:21,138
Greetings sir.

206
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:21,994
I am Jothi.

207
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,978
Kathir sir informed
me that you are here.

208
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,468
I've brought you food.

209
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:27,238
Please come in.

210
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,572
How long have you
been working here?

211
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,719
I've been working under
Kathir sir for 8 years now.

212
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:50,971
I work at his tea estate.

213
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:54,654
Whenever Kathir sir and his friends
visit, I arrange food for them.

214
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:56,065
So...

215
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,280
you must be well-versed
with this place.

216
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:01,408
Is there any quiet and
calm place nearby?

217
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,632
Sir, there are only two
houses in this whole place.

218
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,008
One, Kathir sir's house.

219
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,331
The other one is the
neighboring government quarters.

220
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,601
Then there are few huts.

221
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,769
The laborers at the tea
estate come to work

222
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:15,436
from the village at
the base of the hill.

223
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:20,071
Sir, there is a place
just like you asked for.

224
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,751
It's called 'Kazhugu Paarai.'

225
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:23,776
It is located 20 miles
away, toward south..

226
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,762
It's deep inside the forest.

227
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,221
With falls all around,
it's quite beautiful.

228
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,651
Ok.

229
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,858
Why is there no mobile
range at all here?

230
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,499
Sir, this is indeed
a bit out of range.

231
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,935
You will get some mobile signal over
there at the government quarters.

232
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,040
So tell me...

233
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:49,167
It's been two days since I arrived,

234
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:50,738
but you never turned up.

235
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,705
Sir, I had been to my native.

236
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,411
I returned today after one week.

237
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,315
Sir, what would you
prefer for breakfast?

238
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:00,294
Nothing. Thanks.

239
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:02,043
I'll set out early
in the morning.

240
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,272
- Post that, I'll be busy with my work.
- Ok sir.

241
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:05,694
You...

242
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:07,774
come back after couple of days.

243
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,271
Ok sir.

244
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,286
What did you say that
place is called?

245
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:23,482
Kazhugu Paarai.

246
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,797
Oh! It's you Mr. Jeevan.

247
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,437
A car was spotted
getting into the woods.

248
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:26,128
Everyone at the check post were
concerned that it didn't return.

249
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:28,016
Which is why I am here to check.

250
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,304
Fine, what are you doing here?

251
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:33,219
Well, I came here to get some
privacy so that I could write.

252
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:35,409
Fine, forget it. You
must be careful.

253
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,235
Come, let's go.

254
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,322
What is it?

255
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:40,867
Why do you look tensed?

256
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,009
Well, that?

257
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,127
Something has punctured my car tyre,

258
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:44,893
Sir...

259
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:48,169
the roads are bad here. Something
must have pierced through.

260
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:49,583
No way.

261
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:51,306
This looks very fresh.

262
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:52,806
I have a doubt.

263
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,160
Is there anyone here except us?

264
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:56,066
Sir!

265
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,590
There is no one in 10 km radius,
except for the three of us.

266
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,248
This is reserved forest area.

267
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:01,883
Some wild boar
must have done it.

268
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,059
Now come on. Let's go.

269
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,901
No way. This doesn't look
like a wild boar's job.

270
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,128
You heard me!

271
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,326
We have been here for
years now and we know!

272
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,920
You are already an offender,
having stepped into this forest.

273
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:13,810
Got it?

274
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:15,745
Come on sir.

275
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,578
You! Get the car
fixed and return.

276
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,917
Sir, hand me your
car keys please.

277
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:25,822
You! Here you go.

278
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,487
What is it Jeevan sir?

279
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,027
You still look tensed.

280
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,858
Nothing like that.

281
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,372
By the way, who was that fellow?

282
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,210
What's with his creepy
way of looking?

283
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,045
He cannot speak.

284
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:03,175
He belongs to the local tribe.

285
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,342
He takes care of petty
jobs for us and...

286
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,003
keeps wandering around.

287
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:09,956
A very honest and
genuine fellow.

288
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,225
Even better than us.

289
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:16,842
How do you know Kathir?

290
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:18,860
Kathir?

291
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,226
He often visits the forest.

292
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,882
I guide him around.

293
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:25,314
In the process...

294
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,853
we became good friends.

295
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,682
6 years of friendship.

296
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,359
My booth is nearby.
I'll walk my way to it.

297
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,666
You take the jeep.

298
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:41,217
It's ok sir. You
don't have to do it.

299
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,995
This is actually Mr. Kathir's jeep. I am
driving it just to keep it from rusting.

300
00:32:44,026 --> 00:32:45,971
Cars don't work well
in such forests.

301
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:48,123
You may use this. Return
it to me when you leave.

302
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:49,524
Come on now. See you.

303
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,163
What's going on here?

304
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:31,792
I am your wife!

305
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,195
And it's been 3 days
since you spoke to me.

306
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,889
Writing might be your passion but...

307
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,365
you are more important to me!

308
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:40,114
Won't you pay heed to me at all?

309
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:42,738
Have you noticed, how
much you have changed?

310
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,248
Do whatever you want
with your life.

311
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,787
But do not forget that
we have a life together.

312
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:49,579
Stop it now! What life
are you talking about?

313
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,118
We must create our own life!

314
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:55,051
Look Jeni! I have just started
to find a rhythm to my story.

315
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:56,306
I don't want to miss it.

316
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,051
You could've killed
me yesterday!

317
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:00,494
Nothing more to talk.

318
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,222
I hate the very
look of this place.

319
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,310
So you better start.

320
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:05,515
Look here.

321
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,420
I don't even mind if
you are idle at home.

322
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:08,596
Listen to me.

323
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,451
Ain't I earning? I
will take care of you.

324
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:02,747
Jeni...

325
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,555
I gave it a good thought.

326
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,690
Like you said...

327
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,746
let's return to our home today.

328
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:09,635
You get ready. I
will pack my things.

329
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:32,751
Jeni?

330
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:34,592
Jeni!

331
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,869
Did you see my mobile?

332
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:38,441
You misplace it and then ask me!
How would I know?

333
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:41,417
Hey!

334
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,036
Where's Juliet?

335
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:46,938
She must be somewhere around.
Why don't you look for her?

336
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:48,812
Yes! I forgot my phone at the
place where I went yesterday.

337
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,211
It has all the
important contacts.

338
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,360
I'll go get it. You be ready by then.
Sounds good?

339
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:06,753
I'll be back soon.

340
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,727
Be safe.

341
00:40:37,095 --> 00:40:37,545
Hi.

342
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,246
I am Pooja.

343
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:41,373
We live nearby.

344
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,382
Heard that someone had
come to stay here.

345
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,054
Earlier, I came here twice.

346
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,912
But the house was locked.

347
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,118
It was today morning
I noticed you.

348
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,567
I thought I will just drop in
and invite you for a coffee.

349
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,780
Please come in.

350
00:41:11,487 --> 00:41:13,655
This dress suits
you really well.

351
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:15,403
Thank you.

352
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,672
Where are you from?

353
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:20,045
Basically from Kambam
which is nearby.

354
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,612
But settled down in Chennai.

355
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:49,579
How long have you been pregnant?

356
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:52,310
Six months.

357
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:55,062
My husband works here
as the dam supervisor.

358
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:58,108
He leaves in the morning and
only returns by midnight.

359
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,402
Since there is no one
to take care of me...

360
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:02,567
I've asked my mom to
come down for help.

361
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:05,547
Have you come here
all by yourself?

362
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:08,237
What about your husband?

363
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,120
He is here. He has stepped out.

364
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:11,029
He will be back soon.

365
00:42:11,054 --> 00:42:13,054
Ok. Fine.

366
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:51,144
Really glad to have met you.

367
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,695
Please do come to our house sometime.
Bring your husband too.

368
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:57,772
Ok. Sure.

369
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,531
You won't find
mobile range here.

370
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:04,333
You will get some signal at our house
and we've got a landline phone too.

371
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:07,025
Please feel free to come down
if there is any emergency.

372
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:08,231
Sure.

373
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,422
- Thank you.
- See you.

374
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:10,352
Thank you.

375
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,341
What took you so long?

376
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:36,184
Sir, your car is repaired.
I've sent the keys with the

377
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:40,231
person carrying this letter.
- Thomas (Forest guard)

378
00:45:40,622 --> 00:45:42,162
Ok. Thanks.

379
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:47,017
Just a minute.

380
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:50,826
You are heading back to
the forest guard right?

381
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:52,523
I'll also join.

382
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:31,383
Sir, lift please.

383
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:33,444
Sir, lift please. Sir, lift.

384
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,039
Sir, lift please.

385
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:35,926
Sir.

386
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:38,887
Madam.

387
00:46:39,953 --> 00:46:41,953
Mam! Mam!

388
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:44,410
Mam. Excuse me mam.

389
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:47,021
My vehicle broke down. I've
been stranded here for 3 hours.

390
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:49,935
No one is around to help.
Can you please help me mam?

391
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:51,292
Please madam. Please.

392
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,770
- Fine. Get in.
- Thank you mam.

393
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:04,581
Madam, who are you?

394
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,581
I am Mr. Jeevan's wife.

395
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:09,557
What is it madam?

396
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:14,015
He left to the place he had been to
yesterday, in search of his mobile.

397
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:16,554
It's been 3 hours
and he is not back yet.

398
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:17,926
I am worried.

399
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:22,410
Don't be worried madam. Place he went
yesterday? That's Kazhugu Paarai.

400
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:23,988
I'll go check. You leave. Don't worry.

401
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:25,611
- Well...
- I'll take care of it madam.

402
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:27,266
Ok sir. Thank you.

403
00:48:29,257 --> 00:48:30,479
There is too much mist.

404
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,582
Please drive carefully.

405
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:32,675
Ok.

406
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:33,984
Who is he?

407
00:48:34,426 --> 00:48:37,794
He was stranded on the way as his vehicle
broke down. So I gave him a lift.

408
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:40,160
I'll take care of it madam.
You may leave.

409
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:42,514
Oh. Fine. Thank you.

410
00:48:43,078 --> 00:48:43,528
Sir.

411
00:48:44,317 --> 00:48:45,173
Please come.

412
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
- Ok madam. Drive carefully.
- Ok sir.

413
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:16,038
Where are you Jeni?

414
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:17,888
I've been trying to reach
you since morning.

415
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,031
I am at Meghamalai.

416
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,458
Why are you there?

417
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:24,973
Jeeva is here to write his novel.
I came down to see him.

418
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:26,886
He just won't change!

419
00:49:27,076 --> 00:49:28,579
Can't he do something
better with his life?

420
00:49:28,604 --> 00:49:30,040
You are being too
liberal towards him.

421
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:32,235
If this goes on, then remember
it'll put your life in jeopardy.

422
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,380
Joseph please!

423
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,726
That is not the
problem right now.

424
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:36,734
What happened?

425
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:38,745
Jeeva hasn't returned
home since morning!

426
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,317
I am worried.

427
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,500
Can you please come down.

428
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:44,498
Where did he go?

429
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:46,537
You stay safe. I will
start right away.

430
00:49:46,903 --> 00:49:47,836
- Also, Jeni...
- Hello?

431
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:49,292
- Don't step outside. Stay inside.
I'll be there in 2

432
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:50,770
hours. - I can't hear you.
Your voice is breaking.

433
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:51,867
- Hello, dear brother?
- Hello?

434
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:53,122
- Jeni?
- Do you hear me?

435
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:53,631
Hello?

436
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:55,117
Hello?

437
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:56,756
- Hello?
- Jeni, can you hear me?

438
00:49:57,423 --> 00:49:58,835
Hello? Hello?

439
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:50,890
Save me!

440
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:13,682
Five hours.

441
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,301
The time that I am allotting you...

442
00:52:15,326 --> 00:52:17,244
Five hours.

443
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:21,167
It won't take me long to
break into the house.

444
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,390
I can easily rat you
out and kill you.

445
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,682
But I wanna watch
you cry in pain.

446
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:27,802
And I want to enjoy
every bit of it.

447
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:31,305
And during these five hours
we are going to play a game.

448
00:52:31,759 --> 00:52:32,933
But sharp at 12...

449
00:52:33,446 --> 00:52:34,352
I'll be inside.

450
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:35,971
And you will be dead!

451
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:37,750
Just like your Jeeva.

452
00:52:38,544 --> 00:52:39,778
So, save yourself...

453
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,590
or kill yourself.

454
00:52:42,085 --> 00:52:42,911
The game...

455
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:44,429
starts...

456
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,858
now!

457
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,648
Why did you kill Jeeva?

458
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:50,097
What do you want?!

459
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,121
Who are you?!

460
01:00:07,725 --> 01:00:09,314
Please spare me.

461
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,024
I want to see Jeeva.

462
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:24,198
If...

463
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,404
my life is all that you want...

464
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:31,281
then please allow me to
see Jeeva once. Please!

465
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:34,336
You may kill me after that.

466
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:41,944
For heaven's sake! What do you want?!

467
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:44,096
Just say it already!

468
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,251
Come on.

469
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:33,629
Come on.

470
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:35,138
Come on.

471
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:38,620
Oh my god!

472
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,592
Shit!

473
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:57,505
Help me!

474
01:11:30,532 --> 01:11:31,395
Jeeva!

475
01:11:50,922 --> 01:11:51,604
Jeeva!

476
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:53,795
Jeeva!

477
01:11:54,822 --> 01:11:56,215
Jeeva! Wake up Jeeva!

478
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:57,285
Jeeva!

479
01:11:57,581 --> 01:11:59,263
Jeeva! Wake up!

480
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:00,473
Jeeva!

481
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:04,181
Jeeva! Please wake up!

482
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:06,914
Jeeva! Jeeva!

483
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:07,907
Jeeva?!

484
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:27,821
What is happening around us Jeeva?

485
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:30,078
Who is he?

486
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,288
Why does he want to kill us?

487
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:37,601
I am confused Jeeva.

488
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:46,737
I am sorry Jeni.

489
01:12:47,215 --> 01:12:48,962
I am the reason behind all this.

490
01:12:51,521 --> 01:12:54,074
The imaginary psycho killer,
whom I made up in my story...

491
01:12:54,381 --> 01:12:56,477
has come to life and is
here in front of us.

492
01:12:56,979 --> 01:12:58,153
Stop blabbering!

493
01:12:58,518 --> 01:12:59,915
How is this even possible?

494
01:13:10,341 --> 01:13:11,879
That is what even I
don't understand.

495
01:13:12,857 --> 01:13:14,133
He is a gamer Jeni.

496
01:13:14,205 --> 01:13:16,111
He toys with everyone
before killing them.

497
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,148
He allots the victim a
time and tortures them.

498
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:20,101
He tries to push them to
the brink of suicide.

499
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,766
Such a character has
come to life...

500
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:25,293
and I promise you, I
don't know how Jeni!

501
01:13:26,626 --> 01:13:29,252
Then why did he kill everyone I met?

502
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:32,090
The neighbor girl.

503
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,642
The guy whom I helped.

504
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:37,178
He killed all of them.

505
01:13:38,132 --> 01:13:39,870
He says that I am
his next target.

506
01:13:40,294 --> 01:13:41,326
How do you explain that?

507
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,485
This is not the time
to discuss all this.

508
01:13:44,518 --> 01:13:45,940
We must first escape from here.

509
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:48,690
All I am worried about
is that he must...

510
01:13:48,776 --> 01:13:50,361
not harm you.

511
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,824
A life that you wished for...

512
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,142
is something you must
live, with or without me!

513
01:14:04,814 --> 01:14:07,395
No Jeeva! I won't leave you.

514
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:09,951
Tell me, how do we
escape from here?

515
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,714
There must be some way.

516
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,431
Don't you worry, I am here.

517
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,081
Yes Jeeva.

518
01:14:19,608 --> 01:14:20,743
There is a way.

519
01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:23,935
I am sorry.

520
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,446
I thought you would never find.

521
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,438
A life that you wished for...

522
01:14:54,463 --> 01:14:55,748
is something you must
live, with or without me!

523
01:14:57,782 --> 01:15:00,700
No Jeeva! I won't leave you.

524
01:15:01,904 --> 01:15:03,860
Tell me, how do we
escape from here?

525
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:10,459
Tell me...

526
01:15:22,911 --> 01:15:24,339
Who are you?!

527
01:15:39,585 --> 01:15:40,601
There is a way.

528
01:15:42,364 --> 01:15:43,323
I am sorry.

529
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:50,854
Brilliant!

530
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,955
Now the game is interesting!

531
01:17:00,853 --> 01:17:02,035
This minute...

532
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:03,520
you live your life.

533
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:04,964
The third person lives his life.

534
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,488
The second person
too lives his life.

535
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:09,162
But in order to live life like
everyone at the very same time...

536
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:11,869
one has to be a writer, for only
a writer could live that way.

537
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,376
These are the first verses
from my first book.

538
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:17,386
But the ecstasy of living
someone else's life...

539
01:17:18,123 --> 01:17:19,726
cannot be found
in anything else.

540
01:17:28,055 --> 01:17:29,880
I began to think like him and

541
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,537
a day arrived where I became
him and I took up his form.

542
01:17:32,752 --> 01:17:35,807
And now he has
completely taken over me.

543
01:17:36,629 --> 01:17:39,731
There is no turning back.

544
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:41,062
The game...

545
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:42,293
starts...

546
01:17:42,318 --> 01:17:43,254
now!

547
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:28,589
Jeni had called me. She
was looking for you.

548
01:18:28,614 --> 01:18:29,407
Where were you?

549
01:18:29,634 --> 01:18:30,476
I had some work.

550
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:32,500
My vehicle got punctured;
hence, I was late.

551
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:33,965
So nothing to worry.

552
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,951
Why are you here at this odd hour?

553
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:37,693
Where is Jeni?

554
01:18:39,073 --> 01:18:40,056
Traveling tiredness.

555
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:42,456
She was feeling feverish. She just
took some pills and went to bed.

556
01:18:42,535 --> 01:18:44,257
Fine, I'll just check
on her and leave.

557
01:18:45,144 --> 01:18:47,851
I'll be taking her to the hospital in
the morning. You may meet her there.

558
01:18:48,032 --> 01:18:50,032
Don't worry. I won't disturb her.

559
01:19:09,927 --> 01:19:12,204
So, did you change your mind
about going for a job?

560
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:15,642
Or are you going to continue writing
this 'good-for-nothing' novel?

561
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,042
Brother, he is
trying to kill me!

562
01:19:53,743 --> 01:19:54,323
Oh my!

563
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,072
Brother!

564
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:52,740
You won't find
mobile range here.

565
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,379
You will get some signal at our house
and we have got a landline phone too.

566
01:21:55,638 --> 01:21:58,193
Please feel free to come down
if there is any emergency.

567
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:20,624
Help!

568
01:24:20,914 --> 01:24:21,937
Help!

569
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:23,858
Anybody there?!

570
01:24:24,533 --> 01:24:25,445
Help!

571
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:33,618
Help!

572
01:24:33,993 --> 01:24:35,698
Help! Help please! Help!

573
01:24:35,935 --> 01:24:37,093
Help! Help!

574
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:38,221
Please open the door!

575
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,179
Help!

576
01:24:53,718 --> 01:24:54,704
Please! Open the door!

577
01:24:54,974 --> 01:24:56,136
Open the door! I plead you!

578
01:24:56,161 --> 01:24:56,733
Hello?!

579
01:25:00,448 --> 01:25:01,195
Help!

580
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,523
Madam, what happened?

581
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:47,123
Sir...

582
01:27:23,996 --> 01:27:24,741
Sir...

583
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:26,049
Let's not go here. Please sir.

584
01:27:26,237 --> 01:27:27,317
Let's leave.

585
01:27:27,484 --> 01:27:28,943
- I am scared.
- Don't be scared madam.

586
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,888
- Sir, please no.
- Don't be scared. I am here.

587
01:27:30,929 --> 01:27:32,079
I'll go check inside.

588
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,553
You stay right here.

589
01:27:40,466 --> 01:27:41,649
Sir...

590
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:43,313
- I'll take care of it madam.
- Please sir..

591
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:44,835
You just stay put in the vehicle.

592
01:27:45,096 --> 01:27:46,072
Please don't go sir.

593
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:14,329
This is not the Jeeva I know.

594
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:16,671
You are not my Jeeva.

595
01:29:35,678 --> 01:29:37,456
Didn't I ask you to
stay put in the jeep?

596
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:39,781
What is it Jeevan sir?

597
01:29:41,056 --> 01:29:42,770
Can't you stay alert and...

598
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:46,369
execute a task properly?

599
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:48,713
If she had escaped, both of
us would have been in soup.

600
01:29:49,768 --> 01:29:51,745
If someone else had seen
this instead of me...

601
01:29:51,993 --> 01:29:53,911
all your plan would have
gone down the drain.

602
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:56,563
Make sure you do your
work quietly and safely.

603
01:29:56,771 --> 01:29:58,054
I hope you get it.

604
01:29:58,786 --> 01:29:59,849
Handle things carefully.

605
01:32:49,143 --> 01:32:51,452
There is no way I am going
to escape from him.

606
01:32:52,815 --> 01:32:54,617
I am bleeding real bad.

607
01:32:56,005 --> 01:32:57,290
If this continues...

608
01:32:57,831 --> 01:32:59,767
I'll be dead in sometime.

609
01:33:01,379 --> 01:33:03,379
If I try to escape...

610
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:04,848
he will kill me for sure.

611
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,157
He said he will get inside.

612
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:11,910
And there is only
half an hour to go.

613
01:33:12,472 --> 01:33:14,472
There is no way I can escape from him.

614
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:16,891
But...

615
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,116
I can defeat him
and be victorious!

616
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:22,159
And there is only one
thing I gotta do for it!

617
01:33:23,341 --> 01:33:24,816
I must let him inside!

618
01:39:21,262 --> 01:39:22,871
I can't escape from here.

619
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:25,332
I already knew that fact.

620
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:27,494
I am not afraid to die.

621
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:29,164
But...

622
01:39:29,776 --> 01:39:31,014
when I die...

623
01:39:31,156 --> 01:39:33,156
I will take you along with me.

624
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:38,787
Now, I give you the permission...

625
01:39:39,025 --> 01:39:40,507
to kill me.

626
01:39:44,918 --> 01:39:46,386
Bon voyage!

627
01:40:32,066 --> 01:40:32,637
Nisha!

628
01:40:34,142 --> 01:40:35,563
Nisha calm down.

629
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:37,506
Calm down Nisha.

630
01:40:39,706 --> 01:40:41,039
Nisha calm down.

631
01:40:42,614 --> 01:40:43,558
Relax

632
01:40:49,704 --> 01:40:53,251
This here is Nisha. She was
admitted here 2 years ago.

633
01:40:53,616 --> 01:40:55,189
She is an ardent novel writer.

634
01:40:55,471 --> 01:40:57,191
In fact a very good one.

635
01:40:57,374 --> 01:40:59,443
She has received many
awards and accolades.

636
01:40:59,829 --> 01:41:02,678
But unfortunately her stories
started becoming cliched.

637
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,930
And so she lost her market.

638
01:41:06,585 --> 01:41:08,355
So she moved away from
her usual style and

639
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,124
planned to write a
psychological thriller.

640
01:41:10,483 --> 01:41:12,205
She was almost done writing her story...

641
01:41:12,475 --> 01:41:14,278
but as she reached the climax...

642
01:41:14,494 --> 01:41:17,057
she was under a lot of stress
due to thinking too hard.

643
01:41:17,636 --> 01:41:19,392
So because of irregular
sleep cycles and not

644
01:41:19,554 --> 01:41:21,321
enough sleep, she
descended into insomnia.

645
01:41:21,346 --> 01:41:25,495
After sometime she started using pills
and drugs to tackle the stress.

646
01:41:26,495 --> 01:41:28,741
And at a point the tablets
and her stress...

647
01:41:29,665 --> 01:41:30,704
clashed.

648
01:41:30,855 --> 01:41:33,243
So she got admitted here as a
delusional disorder patient.

649
01:41:34,759 --> 01:41:36,465
Patients with such
disorders are not only

650
01:41:36,616 --> 01:41:38,320
found here but also
in foreign countries.

651
01:41:38,712 --> 01:41:41,376
Well, in fact there are couple of
similar cases in our hospital itself.

652
01:41:41,823 --> 01:41:43,124
I'll show you.

653
01:41:45,027 --> 01:41:46,288
One of the cases was a success.

654
01:41:46,437 --> 01:41:48,331
This patient's name is Karthika.

655
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,074
Another case, which
is a failure.

656
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:52,616
This patient's name is Kiran.

657
01:41:52,837 --> 01:41:54,621
But unfortunately he is no more.

658
01:41:54,647 --> 01:41:55,777
He killed himself.

659
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,838
Delusional disorder is...

660
01:42:01,965 --> 01:42:05,149
where one cannot differentiate
between reality and illusion.

661
01:42:06,596 --> 01:42:08,498
They tend to imagine
things as illusion when

662
01:42:08,523 --> 01:42:10,213
actually it is for
real and vice versa.

663
01:42:10,777 --> 01:42:13,084
I've been studying Ms. Nisha
for around 1.5 years now.

664
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:16,867
Nisha!

665
01:42:17,648 --> 01:42:18,672
Catch hold of her!

666
01:42:19,532 --> 01:42:21,806
Nisha! Calm down Nisha!

667
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:25,306
Injection! Now!

668
01:42:26,847 --> 01:42:27,538
Nisha!

669
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,336
Nisha calm down.

670
01:42:33,587 --> 01:42:35,340
Nisha!

671
01:42:38,821 --> 01:42:40,138
Nisha calm down.

672
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:43,665
Ok...

673
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:46,712
take her to her room.

674
01:42:56,902 --> 01:42:57,997
So where was I?

675
01:42:58,217 --> 01:42:59,924
Delusional disorder sir.

676
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:03,620
She continues to live as Jeni, a
character she had made up in her novel.

677
01:43:03,953 --> 01:43:05,953
One more interesting
fact of this case is...

678
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:08,630
she assumes the people she
sees or meets regularly

679
01:43:08,655 --> 01:43:11,000
in this hospital to be the
characters in her novel.

680
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:12,618
Not only that.

681
01:43:13,205 --> 01:43:16,870
A novel without a proper climax keeps
making a loop in her mind everyday.

682
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,607
Doctor, what is that story about?

683
01:43:20,015 --> 01:43:22,290
As far as I've analyzed,
it's about a writer.

684
01:43:22,526 --> 01:43:25,057
A mentally unstable writer
who tries to kill his wife.

685
01:43:25,304 --> 01:43:26,692
Something like that.

686
01:43:27,044 --> 01:43:29,819
Do you have any idea who she visualizes
as her husband in the novel?

687
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:32,364
Nope. I couldn't find that.

688
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:34,427
So any other doubts?

689
01:43:36,733 --> 01:43:37,371
I'm not surprised.

690
01:43:37,396 --> 01:43:39,996
Oh sorry doctor. Please continue.
I shall wait.

691
01:43:40,021 --> 01:43:41,685
It's ok doctor. The class is over.

692
01:43:42,035 --> 01:43:44,718
Note down your doubts and I'll
answer them in the next session.

693
01:43:49,882 --> 01:43:51,916
Why do you keep calling
when I cut the call?

694
01:43:51,941 --> 01:43:54,509
I am here at the hospital.
Come to room #102.

695
01:44:09,468 --> 01:44:14,183
Excuse me. Make sure you only
feed gruel to the patient in 201.

696
01:44:14,768 --> 01:44:15,513
Ok sir.

697
01:44:15,884 --> 01:44:18,147
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

698
01:44:18,172 --> 01:44:20,446
The new nurse, Geetha,
man she is a hottie.

699
01:44:20,471 --> 01:44:23,177
I hear that she is
Dr. Rajesekar's mistress.

700
01:44:23,488 --> 01:44:25,233
Is it? Damn it!

701
01:44:27,206 --> 01:44:29,038
How many times have I warned you
about smoking inside the campus.

702
01:44:29,265 --> 01:44:30,205
- Idiots!
- Sorry sir.

703
01:44:30,508 --> 01:44:31,253
Get lost!

704
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,740
Why do you keep calling
when I cut the call?

705
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:39,362
Why are you here
all of a sudden?

706
01:44:40,086 --> 01:44:41,815
You go outside and wait.

707
01:44:44,938 --> 01:44:46,414
Close the door on your way out.

708
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,642
How many times have I told you?
Don't deal this in here!

709
01:44:56,667 --> 01:44:58,167
It'll become an issue
if someone finds out!

710
01:44:58,192 --> 01:45:01,041
I have taken my share.
This is your share.

711
01:45:01,442 --> 01:45:03,150
I was asked
to hand it over.

712
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:05,532
Make sure he stays mentally unstable.

713
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:09,854
And when I say, finish him off.

714
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:13,166
If he becomes normal then he would
be a threat to a lot of big shots.

715
01:45:13,446 --> 01:45:15,403
Got it?

716
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:19,974
Sir...

717
01:45:20,429 --> 01:45:21,960
patient Nisha has fainted.
Can you please come.

718
01:45:21,998 --> 01:45:23,075
Ok. Keep going. I'll come.

719
01:45:23,344 --> 01:45:25,710
It's an important case. I'm leaving now.
I'll call you.

720
01:45:37,955 --> 01:45:38,780
Nisha?

721
