1
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,819
Come on, guru.
- Bela, this is my friend Khatpatiya.

2
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,239
Bela, I would have come with you.

3
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,059
What can I do?

4
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,338
Until I don't take care
of my parents' property..

5
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,779
..it will be difficult for
me to leave this place.

6
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,699
Come early.
- I will! I certainly will!

7
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:54,706
I will come as quickly as I can!

8
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,259
During that time, talk
to a good pundit and..

9
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,819
..fix a favourable time
for our wedding.

10
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,146
Bela, send some money.

11
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,420
You know these lawyers.
They keep asking for money.

12
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,560
Yes, I'll send it.

13
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,114
Good girl.

14
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,299
Vijay!
- Father, uncle has come!

15
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,739
Balraj!

16
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,826
Raj, you have come!

17
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,189
Uncle, you should have written
a letter before you came.

18
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,863
No! I had a holiday in
college for a few days.

19
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,092
So I thought of coming
to the village..

20
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,092
..and eat food prepared by you.

21
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,472
You did right. Tell me this.

22
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,392
Why did you walk all the way from
the station to our house?

23
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:39,552
So what, brother?

24
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,112
I had a walk and saved money
on the rickshaw too!

25
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,594
For saving 25 paisa,
you took so much trouble?

26
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:49,260
Brother! Brother, haven't you
got rid of your cough yet?

27
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:53,782
Raj, it isn't much. I am well now.

28
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,272
Forget about all that. Tell me,
how are your studies going?

29
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,472
I will surely pass my BA.

30
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:02,165
With your blessings,
I may get a first class too.

31
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:02,992
Really?

32
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:07,733
Uncle, if that day comes,
father will be overjoyed!

33
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,674
Brother!
- Bhootnath, greetings.

34
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:12,794
Bless you, Balraj. Greetings.

35
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:16,227
Tell me, sir.
Did you catch a new ghost?

36
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:20,430
Balraj, let me first get rid
of your brother's illness.

37
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:21,792
After that I'll look after
everything else.

38
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:25,912
Illness? - Dear, you don't know
this angel of death.

39
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,265
For getting money,
he could make a good person ill.

40
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,614
Vijay, give some warm
milk to your uncle.

41
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:34,392
Ok. Come, uncle. Come.
- Go on.

42
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,131
Hansraj, today I have
brought such medicine..

43
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,112
Shut up! Don't dare to speak
anything related..

44
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,028
..to my illness or medicine
before Raj.

45
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:45,170
Oh no! I would never say such a thing!

46
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,316
I have brought a potion to
help Balraj think sharper.

47
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:52,102
He can memorise a book well
just by reading it once!

48
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:53,613
Really?
- Yes!

49
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,133
Does such a drug exist?
- Yes, why not?

50
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,875
How much does it cost?
- I won't take much from you.

51
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:01,412
Give me five rupees now and
pay me one during Diwali.

52
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,413
Ok.
- Alright.

53
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:07,053
You are ready to pay for
your brother's studies.

54
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:11,098
For your illness, you won't
be ready to pay anything.

55
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,733
Give me the medicine!
- I have just brought the herbs.

56
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,909
I'll prepare it and send
it to you by the evening. -

57
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:25,602
Vijay, brother is coughing badly.

58
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,547
Yes, he always has cough.

59
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,636
The doctor said that
he has tuberculosis.

60
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:32,636
Tuberculosis? TB!

61
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:36,236
Who said so? Who said so?
I have tuberculosis?

62
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,546
You may try to hide it, brother..

63
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,612
..but your coughing and
your appearance..

64
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:44,876
- Silly boy, I have no illness.
- I have just grown old.

65
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:49,036
That is why I said this, brother.
This age requires rest.

66
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,064
You don't need to sit near a fire
and work for me all day.

67
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,956
Brother, I'll quit studying
and do some job.

68
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,690
What did you say?
You'll quit studies?

69
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,175
Why not?
- Sit here. Sit.

70
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,076
Raj, you know why
I am making you study.

71
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:09,895
Everyone in this family
has been a blacksmith.

72
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:12,236
I thought that there
must be someone..

73
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,306
..who would make the family proud.

74
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,267
It's just a matter of a few months.

75
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:18,236
Once you pass your BA,
if not a collector..

76
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,722
..you can at least be his deputy.

77
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:26,643
Raj, then I'll spread velvet on a bed
and rest like rich men!

78
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:32,094
Dear, don't delay our wedding.

79
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,411
Otherwise father will get
me married to someone else.

80
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,857
Then I won't have anyway
out other than suicide.

81
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:40,015
No! What are you saying?!

82
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,947
Sheela, the day I hear that
you're getting married..

83
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,254
..to someone else, my dear,
I'll go to Delhi straight away!

84
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:49,614
I'll stand on Qutub Minar,
take your name and jump!

85
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:52,421
Guru, Vijay!
- Say Mr. Vijay Singh.

86
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,854
Vijay Singh.
- Sheela, my guru is coming.

87
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,504
Go to your village.
- So early?

88
00:06:56,584 --> 00:07:00,494
Yes! If my guru sees me with you,
he'll report to my father.

89
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,135
My father will get me married
to someone else.

90
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,861
Look, get a favourable time from..

91
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,914
..a good pundit for our wedding. Go!

92
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:09,323
Where?
- Here.

93
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,210
Hide!
- Ok.

94
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,974
Are you praying?
- Come Vijay.

95
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:25,654
I was praying to Hanuman for you.

96
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:28,304
What is this, Balam?
- The bond of love.

97
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:29,370
What if someone sees us?

98
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,854
If someone does, he'll be envious.

99
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:36,414
He'll say, that the beautiful girl
is accompanied by Balam.

100
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,723
Vijay, today you really look great.

101
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,405
Go away.
- Where should I go?

102
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,705
Now I will go only with you.

103
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,974
Stop following me.
- What is this Vijay?

104
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:47,254
The days of love are coming
close and you are retreating.

105
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,971
Since this drape has begun
to cover your head..

106
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,734
..I have been desperate
to see your face!

107
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,926
If I would know that you
would move away from me..

108
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,998
..on attaining youth,
six years ago when you fell in a well..

109
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,894
..instead of saving you,
I would drown in the well too!

110
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:06,654
Really? Do you think that
I don't care about you?

111
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,134
Why don't you talk to father?

112
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:10,904
Uncle has come from the town too.

113
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:12,865
Wedding is a minute detail.

114
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:15,356
Father and uncle are not
required for that.

115
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,894
No! A wedding is very essential.

116
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,254
Father said to uncle that
I will be married..

117
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,974
..only after uncle passes his BA.

118
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:28,894
Really? So if your uncle fails his BA,
we won't get married?

119
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:30,134
I don't know.

120
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:34,213
Hanuman, get her uncle
to pass in BA!

121
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,214
I'll offer you offerings
worth 1.25 rupees!

122
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:38,129
Guru, is she final?

123
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,623
Khatpatiya, you are still a fool.

124
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,229
There are still more to come.

125
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,202
This means,
you still have more women. What say?

126
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,066
You are right for
the first time in your life.

127
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:50,116
Quiet! Come!

128
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,716
Get me some yoghurt and
fried potato bread!

129
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:53,896
What is it, you fool?

130
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:57,686
What have you done to deserve
fried potato-bread?

131
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,983
If I could earn something,
I would eat at a hotel.

132
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,912
Why would I trouble your wife?
What say?

133
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:05,048
Shameless! You are worthless
and shameless!

134
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,668
Get lost!
- I'll leave. I won't die due to hunger.

135
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,769
Forget it.
He had just come to eat bread.

136
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,454
All I get is abuse!

137
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,631
Son, parents wouldn't want
to abuse their son.

138
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,915
You don't care about our house.

139
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:18,553
You have a young sister.

140
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,134
Have you thought about her wedding?

141
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:26,431
Gauri! Wait, Gauri!
- Wait, dear.

142
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,687
Get up carefully.
- Up.

143
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,312
Did you see? She spilled the water.

144
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:30,797
Wherever she goes,
she'll just spill water.

145
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:32,254
Aren't you ashamed?

146
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:37,532
She is blind from birth and
you keep insulting her.

147
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,112
If we would have a little money..

148
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:43,188
..we could tempt someone for dowry
and get her married.

149
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,012
If you cared about your
sister's wedding..

150
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,610
..you wouldn't move
around everywhere.

151
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,721
Mother, this is not something
that I can get by..

152
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,761
..requesting for it.
I can't get a husband for her.

153
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:57,241
Mother, brother is right.

154
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,589
The one who has been
blinded by God..

155
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,841
..can't be helped by anyone.

156
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:11,776
Brother, I know that
I am worthless..

157
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:19,448
..for everyone in this house.
Tell me, what do I do?

158
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:27,831
You don't even let me go out and beg.

159
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:33,830
I have heard that blind
people get alms quickly.

160
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,482
You speak as if you are
well-versed with..

161
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:38,616
..all the roads in this world!
Where will you go?

162
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:44,454
Brother, I am blind but
I can walk on roads.

163
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,698
Someone will take pity on me.

164
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,230
You are blind and mad too!
Think about it!

165
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,890
Our father won't give us food.

166
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,489
What can you expect from others?

167
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:57,029
My God! What a son
you have given me!

168
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:02,455
Bring some bread for this dog!
He should stop barking!

169
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,065
Thank you.

170
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,324
Don't try to hide your illness, brother.

171
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,831
Have the medicines that
the doctor prescribes.

172
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,653
Medicines are worthless.

173
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,121
There is only one solution
to my illness.

174
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,105
What?

175
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:17,047
The day I hear that
you passed your BA.

176
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:21,225
You'll see that I'll be strong overnight!

177
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,344
People will find it difficult
to identify which one..

178
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:28,104
..of us is younger and
which one is older.

179
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,796
Look at this.
- What is this, brother?

180
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,215
This is a potion. It's a concoction.

181
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:35,657
Eat it everyday.
You will be smarter!

182
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,926
Brother!
- Keep it safely in your pocket.

183
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:54,721
Don't worry about me.
Concentrate on studying, Raj!

184
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,744
Bhatt, you haven't left yet?

185
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:02,280
Well, I was looking at the
Mathura murder case.

186
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:06,509
Look at this point.
- First check the time.

187
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,368
5.05.

188
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,554
You have forgotten
that I don't work after 5.

189
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,560
Sorry sir.
- Also, students must be waiting for me.

190
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,680
Go home.
Such murders are commonplace.

191
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,560
Good night.
- Good night, sir.

192
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,395
The bus is leaving empty.
Why didn't you go?

193
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,885
A car will come to take me.
- From where?

194
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:30,694
You'll see. At 5.10 a man will
come here and stop his car.

195
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,237
He'll ask whether anyone wants
to go to Gandhinagar.

196
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:40,508
Does anyone want to
go to Gandhinagar?

197
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,437
Come on!
- Good evening, sir.

198
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,257
Come along.
- No, I'll go in a bus.

199
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:47,129
Where do you want to go?

200
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,189
I have to go to Gandhinagar too.

201
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,505
Come with us.
- A bus is coming. I'll come by a bus.

202
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,403
Is this car not as good as a bus?

203
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,834
Come!

204
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,969
Thank you sir.
- You have to go to Gandhinagar, right?

205
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:13,585
Yes.

206
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:14,879
Come on then.
I'm going to Gandhinagar too.

207
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:16,173
It's nearby. I'll walk.

208
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,078
You're weird!
I don't leave anyone halfway.

209
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,638
Come!
- Thank you sir.

210
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,409
In what year do you study?
- BA final.

211
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:37,559
What is your name?
- Balraj. People call me Raj.

212
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,689
Last year, at inter-varsity
hockey championship..

213
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,169
..a boy had scored four goals..
- That was me.

214
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,882
You had also got first prize in
inter-varsity essay competition.

215
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,546
Yes. How do you know?

216
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:53,034
I was present there when
you were given the prize.

217
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,364
- Ok.
- Where do you want to go in Gandhinagar?

218
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:59,236
Third main road.
- You stay at third main road?

219
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:00,404
I don't stay there.

220
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,773
Mr. Chaudhary Hukumat Rai
stays there.

221
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,055
I'm going to meet him.

222
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,568
Chaudhary Hukumat Rai.
Public prosecutor?

223
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,776
Yes. How do you know him?

224
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,916
Well, I am a lawyer too.

225
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:14,980
Chaudhary Hukumat Rai is
as famous as the devil.

226
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,510
Forgive me. Is he your relative?

227
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:22,087
No. He is a very famous man.
I'm a poor boy.

228
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,924
How do you study? Do you get
a scholarship in college?

229
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:29,741
No. My elder brother works
hard to educate me.

230
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:33,187
Oh! What work do you have
with Hukumat Rai?

231
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:37,217
I have heard that he has an
empty room to be rented.

232
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,467
I have heard that he is a good man.

233
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,964
Maybe he may give me
the room at a lower rent.

234
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,579
Hukumat Rai is a miser!

235
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,065
However, for publicity he
does help people sometimes.

236
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,233
Where did you live before?
- In a hostel.

237
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,321
Were you expelled from the hostel?

238
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:56,241
No! The hostel is expensive
to live in.

239
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,884
Are you married?
- No.

240
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:03,814
Then you'll have to live in the hostel.
- Why?

241
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:07,412
Chaudhary Hukumat Rai
has a young daughter.

242
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:10,745
His wife doesn't want to make
a bachelor her tenant.

243
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:15,239
I am a well-mannered boy.
I'll explain it to her somehow.

244
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,261
It will be too difficult to
explain it to his wife!

245
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,765
Have you ever had green chillies?

246
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,059
Green chillies?
- Yes.

247
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,700
She is equal to that.

248
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:31,083
Do something.
- Tell me.

249
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,443
Tell her that you are married.

250
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,144
No, I won't lie to a respected lady.

251
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:39,629
The times are such! What's wrong
in lying for your benefit?

252
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,083
I have never said a lie.
- Start from today.

253
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,483
I'll come with you and
explain about you.

254
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,603
Listen, you must lie in such a way..

255
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:48,706
..that it appears to be the truth.

256
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,984
No, I won't lie.
- Don't be strange!

257
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,164
You say that your brother
works hard to educate you.

258
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,747
His problem can be rid
of by a small lie.

259
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,323
What difference does it make?
- But I have never..

260
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:00,677
Let me explain.

261
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,981
Don't forget what I have taught you.

262
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,494
Alright.
- What?

263
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,343
About marriage.
- Come.

264
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:18,937
Shanti!
- Sir, whom are you calling?

265
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,010
Chaudhary's daughter. Why?
- It's nothing.

266
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,259
Shanti.
- What is it, daddy?

267
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,363
Look dear, the outhouse
that has to be rented..

268
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,228
Take its key from your mother.

269
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,276
I'll get it, daddy.

270
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:42,393
Sir, is this your house?
- Of course.

271
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:45,313
You are Chaudhary..
- Chaudhary Hukumat Rai.

272
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,129
Public prosecutor
Chaudhary Hukumat Rai?

273
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,875
Why? Do I appear to be a fool?

274
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:52,035
- You..
- Good boy.

275
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:54,434
Daddy, the key.
- Show him the outhouse.

276
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:55,755
I'll change clothes.

277
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,995
Come. Come along!
- Come.

278
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,514
Come in. This is your bedroom
and drawing room too.

279
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:10,074
This is a reading table.

280
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,306
If you spread a cloth over this,
it will be a dining table.

281
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:21,103
This is the outlet for water.
Do you like it?

282
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:23,521
Yes, I liked it.
- What do you like?

283
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,657
The pitcher.
- The pitcher?

284
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:27,859
I mean, the room and
all these things. I like them all.

285
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:28,835
My mother.

286
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,098
Greetings.
- Greetings.

287
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,258
Mr. Chaudhary told me all about you.

288
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,565
What did he say?
- He was praising you.

289
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,393
What is your occupation?
- I'm doing my BA.

290
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:42,512
Do you have parents?
- No. I have an elder brother.

291
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:46,618
Are you married?
- Married? Well, I am..

292
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,140
Tell her the truth.
What's wrong in saying the truth?

293
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,085
Mr. Chaudhary, I..
- He has been married for two years.

294
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,044
How many children do you have?

295
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:55,458
We have one.
- I'm not asking you! I asked him!

296
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,018
Try to figure it out.

297
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,178
How many children can
one have in two years?

298
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:00,107
What are you saying?
- That's right!

299
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,898
He has got married
and came to the town to study.

300
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:06,328
His wife is pregnant. That's why
he has left her at her parents' place.

301
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,447
Which month is it?
- December.

302
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,738
December? I asked you how
many months it has been.

303
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,605
Oh! Seven months!

304
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,618
I'm asking him
and you are answering me!

305
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:17,540
Correct!
- What is correct?

306
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:21,538
He is young. It's embarrassing
for him to say all this to you.

307
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,937
Ask me what you have to.
I've talked to him.

308
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,218
Have you told him about the rent?

309
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,533
Oh yes! 40 rupees.

310
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:29,212
40 rupees! I..
- Of course. 40 rupees.

311
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,573
But I am very poor!
- Don't be weird!

312
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,357
What has money got
to do with poverty?

313
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,458
What?
- You will have to pay 40 rupees.

314
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:36,409
That's not necessary.

315
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,478
Can't we lower the rent
depending on the person?

316
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,820
I won't reduce it one bit.
- Move away!

317
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:44,623
Look son. Riches and poverty
is not important here.

318
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:49,047
Ask me anything you want.
My name is Laxmi.

319
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,433
Why Laxmi? Say Mahalaxmi.

320
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,407
That's enough. Come on Shanti.

321
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,225
Sir..
- 40 rupees. 40 rupees.

322
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,364
The hostel would be
cheaper than that.

323
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:02,458
Don't act strangely.
A hostel and a house are different.

324
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:03,220
What are you talking about?

325
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,686
Mr. Chaudhary
I can't pay 40 rupees..

326
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:09,660
Silly boy, you have to pay only four,
I'll add the zero.

327
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,387
Sir..
- Is it still expensive?

328
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:15,346
I won't forget this favour.
- Forget it for the moment.

329
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:19,201
Don't dare to forget one thing.
You are married.

330
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,450
Good boy! Good boy.

331
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,932
Do you like it?
- Yes, I liked it.

332
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:49,882
I had to dream about a married man.

333
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,854
Look, the more I take
medicine given..

334
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,840
..by you the more I am ill!

335
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,938
It will be fine.
- Father! Uncle has written a letter.

336
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:07,617
Raj has written a letter?
What has he written, dear?

337
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,565
He says that he has
left the hostel and..

338
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:13,316
..is staying at a rich man Chaudhary
Hukumat Rai's house as a tenant.

339
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:16,293
He left the hostel and
took a room! But why?

340
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,502
Who will clean the room,
give him food..

341
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,659
He writes that the hostel
was expensive.

342
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,569
For saving a little money
will he take more trouble?

343
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,425
Couldn't I send him money
for a few months more?

344
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:31,117
If he had to save money,
he could do that after I died!

345
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,434
Father! Father!

346
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,399
What is this, doctor?
Father is spitting blood!

347
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,321
He works all day at a heated fireplace.

348
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:39,634
Obviously, he will spit blood.

349
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,723
These are the signs of death!
- Get lost!

350
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,810
I told you many times!

351
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:48,806
Don't talk about my illness
before Raj and Vijay.

352
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,222
You just don't listen!
- But I..

353
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:52,530
Get lost! Go away! Go!

354
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,039
What are you writing, dear?
- Nothing, father. Nothing.

355
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:09,043
Nothing? I know. You must be
writing a letter to your uncle.

356
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:11,415
Yes, father.
- What have you written?

357
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:17,155
I have written that father didn't
like you leaving your hostel.

358
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,643
Everything else is fine.

359
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,939
You are reading what you
have written, right?

360
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,723
Yes, father.
- No! You are lying.

361
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:27,563
I'll tell you what you
must have written.

362
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:31,128
Father is spitting blood.
He may die soon.

363
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,523
If you want to see him come quickly.

364
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:35,806
That's it, right? Isn't it so?

365
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,333
Swear by me! Swear by me!
- Yes.

366
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:44,923
I am illiterate. You may exploit
your father's stupidity.

367
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,944
Silly girl! Why don't you understand?

368
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,575
If he hears such news..

369
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,639
..he won't be able to concentrate
on his studies.

370
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,403
Father, forgive me.

371
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:57,963
I was scared when I
saw your condition.

372
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:01,523
I will never write that! Never!

373
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:05,785
You must have thought that
I am on my deathbed.

374
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:09,003
But I have already made
a deal with God.

375
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,403
Until I don't get news
of Raj passing his BA..

376
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,913
..he is to continue giving me life.

377
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:21,403
He will listen to me!
I won't die till then!

378
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,825
Ram Singh.
- Yes.

379
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,264
Mr. Raj has come.

380
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,467
Get some tea, toast and
some sweets for him too.

381
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:34,851
Ok sir.
- You give him that everyday.

382
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,055
Do you know anything about him?

383
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:39,542
What is it?
- You don't know anything.

384
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:44,486
I know everything, dear
but I thought that the boy is poor..

385
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:47,451
What if he is poor?
He is a gentleman.

386
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:50,291
He doesn't eat betel leaves.
He doesn't smoke.

387
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:52,413
Nor does he smoke cannabis.
- Oh!

388
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:55,391
There is one more thing.
- What is that?

389
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,330
Shanti's friends come to meet her.
- So what?

390
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,193
Does anyone dare to look at him?

391
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:02,957
Do you know anything else about him?

392
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:07,115
What else? I never saw nor did
I ever hear about such a boy.

393
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:11,341
But what use is he to us?
He is already married.

394
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:15,958
That's true. If he would be a bachelor,
would I still be quiet?

395
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:19,021
Wouldn't I get Shanti married
to Raj straight away?

396
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:22,821
Really?
- What else? Completely true!

397
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,261
Very good!

398
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:31,496
You are very nervous.

399
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,175
Nervous? I have just saved
myself from death.

400
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:36,626
Are you injured?

401
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:40,534
I'm not made of wax to
get hurt by a scratch.

402
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:43,408
Well, forget that.
You are probably going to college.

403
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:46,076
Yes.
- I am going to college too.

404
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:50,028
Ok, go on.
- Come in my car. I'll leave you.

405
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:53,920
No! I have a habit of walking.
- I have a habit of giving lifts.

406
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,948
It appears to be the entire
family's habit. - Yes.

407
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:59,631
Come on then.
- Ok, let's go.

408
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:05,948
Tell me. How is your wife?
She must be writing to you.

409
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,948
Yes. She keeps writing letters.

410
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:10,872
You didn't get a telegram yet.

411
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:12,104
Telegram?
- Yes.

412
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,007
Why?

413
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:18,388
You said that you are going to
be a father after two months.

414
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,367
Yes, I will be a father.
I surely will.

415
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:24,188
But it has been four months
since you said this.

416
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:28,930
So it must have been
10 or 11 months in all.

417
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,788
Yes, it has been 11 months.
- You haven't got the news yet?

418
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,577
It is possible that there has
been a problem on the way.

419
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:39,628
I mean, the post may lose
the letter on the way.

420
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:42,908
Ok.
- My college has come. Let me get off.

421
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:03,948
Such a scared man!
He forgot his dairy.

422
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:09,471
Today I lied for the first
time in my life.

423
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,728
To get a room at
Mr. Chaudhary's house..

424
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,948
..I had to lie as he forced me to.

425
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,148
I said that I am married.

426
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:30,216
I had to lie as he forced
me to that I am married.

427
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,493
Lie! A lie!

428
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:46,877
The first lie! Forgive me Shanti.

429
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,782
I can't even sleep at
night due to this fear.

430
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,513
The day you find out my secret..

431
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:55,268
..I don't know what you
may think about me.

432
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,335
I really don't get sleep at night.

433
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:02,713
You can't sleep?
Have you lost your sleep?

434
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:12,095
You lied and lost your sleep.

435
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,935
I know the truth
and I will also lose my sleep.

436
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:31,199
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

437
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:51,379
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

438
00:26:52,019 --> 00:27:00,740
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

439
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:09,927
"He gives a message of love
from far away and leaves."

440
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:18,346
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

441
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:34,619
"I will be awake all night."

442
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:39,445
"I will hide from you, beloved."

443
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:43,659
"I will be awake all night."

444
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:48,407
"I will hide from you, beloved."

445
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:52,761
"I will never feel drowsy."

446
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:57,147
"I swear by the moon and the stars."

447
00:27:57,307 --> 00:28:05,767
"Today I agree to this."

448
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:14,957
"He gives a message of love
from far away and leaves."

449
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:23,344
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

450
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:46,811
"When I talked to him,
it came to this.."

451
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:55,674
"When I talked to him,
it came to this.."

452
00:28:55,814 --> 00:29:04,547
"When I took his name,
there was a fragrance in the air."

453
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:12,987
"There is an image
that enchants me."

454
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:22,227
"He gives a message of love
from far away and leaves."

455
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:30,667
"Someone is taking away my sleep."

456
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:46,507
What is all this?

457
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:50,292
Come in, this is the room. Mr. Raj!

458
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,418
Yes?
- Here is your telegram.

459
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:57,216
Telegram? For me?
- Yes. Take this.

460
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:03,776
Why are you worried before
seeing the telegram?

461
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,071
I'm afraid my elder
brother may be ill.

462
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,193
Oh!

463
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,965
A boy was born at 10 at night.

464
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,275
The mother and child are both fine.

465
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:21,463
Congratulations, Mr. Raj.
Congratulations!

466
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,047
I'll give this good news
to mother immediately!

467
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,124
Shanti! Please!

468
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:46,604
From where did this telegram come?

469
00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:49,371
Come in, mother. Come.
- Congratulations, Raj.

470
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,829
What? - Don't pretend.
Shanti told me everything.

471
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:56,023
Open your mouth! Open!

472
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:57,673
Ok, now give greetings.

473
00:30:57,753 --> 00:31:00,085
Greetings.
- Not to me, to mother.

474
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:02,538
Greetings, mother.
- Not like that!

475
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,346
You've had your first born.

476
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:07,316
Lie down and greet her properly.

477
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:11,414
Do it. Go ahead!
- Bless you, son.

478
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,297
May your son live a long life.

479
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:14,759
Whose son will live a long life?

480
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,039
What happened?
What mistake did he commit?

481
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,274
Get up! What happened?

482
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:18,792
What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

483
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,098
First open your mouth.
- What are you doing, dear?

484
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,880
Have I ever opened my
mouth before you?

485
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,424
Open it today, father!
- Why?

486
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:29,675
Balraj has been blessed
with a lovely son!

487
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:34,910
Very good! A boy?
You didn't tell us..

488
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,078
How could he tell us, father?
He just got a telegram.

489
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:38,360
Come on, mother. Let's distribute..

490
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,963
..sweets in the neighbourhood.
- Come.

491
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:43,508
Mr. Balraj, you are invited for
dinner today at our house.

492
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:44,685
Don't forget it.

493
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,921
You dared to lie to
Chaudhary Hukumat Rai!

494
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:56,320
You told me that you weren't married.

495
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
I don't even know where
this telegram came from.

496
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,154
Where? It must have come
from your in-law's place!

497
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:02,388
Mr. Chaudhary, I don't have in-laws.

498
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:03,936
Someone has played mischief with me.

499
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:06,677
Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

500
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:09,206
Don't worry, my boy! Don't worry.

501
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:11,560
What a problem!

502
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:14,578
Did you see how I fooled him!

503
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:17,255
- Shanti.
- Yes.

504
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,805
You are a lawyer's daughter, right?

505
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:21,653
Why do you ask, daddy?

506
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,060
Answer me. Are you are a
lawyer's daughter or not?

507
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,248
Yes.
- You don't even know to lie.

508
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,517
If you have to lie you
should do it in such..

509
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:29,777
..a way that it appears
to be the truth.

510
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:31,478
If you had to fool him,
you should have..

511
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,240
..had a telegram sent
from his village.

512
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,934
Not from our town and
our neighbourhood.

513
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:40,255
You want to be a lawyer
and such an obvious lie!

514
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:44,794
Didn't Raj lie?
- I forced him to lie.

515
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:47,084
I know.
- How do you know?

516
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:52,812
I am a lawyer's daughter.
I can find out an obvious lie. -

517
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:55,373
Listen. If your mother
finds out about..

518
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:57,472
..this entire deal, we'll be doomed.

519
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,711
What then daddy?

520
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:01,118
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

521
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:03,806
Guru! Guru!

522
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,486
A money order from Mathura.

523
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,145
Speak softly. Income tax
officers may hear us.

524
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,887
Hold this! Bend down!

525
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:11,126
Guru, I am acting like a cock
for the first time in my life.

526
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,806
Hurry up.
- Balam.

527
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,925
Count it.
- Such notes are not counted by weighed.

528
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,499
The money.
- Here guru.

529
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,326
Cigarette.
- Here.

530
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:23,287
Thank you.

531
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:25,581
Dear darling.

532
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:26,785
Oh my!
- Move away!

533
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,837
I'm sending the money
that you asked for.

534
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,415
Thank you.
- Thank you.

535
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:35,187
Take care of your health.

536
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,690
She cares about me.
- She cares about you.

537
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:38,671
You told me that you would come.

538
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,236
You didn't come nor did
you write a letter.

539
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:45,489
I am waiting for you to come.
She's waiting for my arrival!

540
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:50,271
Don't disappoint me.
Yours truly, Bela.

541
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,327
You are too good, Balam.

542
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,080
Raj! Raj!
- Yes, mother.

543
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:57,771
Tomorrow is a Sunday.
You have a holiday, right?

544
00:33:58,056 --> 00:34:00,102
Yes.
- Then, we'll go tomorrow.

545
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,886
Ok. Where to?
- To your in-laws.

546
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:06,281
In-laws? Mother, tomorrow
I have an important task.

547
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:07,679
Are you a father?
- No.

548
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,633
No!

549
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,008
I am a father.
- What kind of father are you?

550
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:12,861
You aren't happy even though your
first child has been born.

551
00:34:13,196 --> 00:34:15,994
You didn't go to meet him nor
did you buy anything for him.

552
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,185
Well, it's ok. I have bought everything.

553
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,943
Get ready to go tomorrow.

554
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,655
But mother, my village
is very far away!

555
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,965
What if it is far away?
We don't have to walk.

556
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,026
We'll go in a car and return soon.

557
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,047
Your car will be damaged.
The roads are bad.

558
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,346
They'll be alright if they are bad.

559
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:33,746
Be ready tomorrow in the morning.
Understood?

560
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:38,426
Yes, I understand. My in-laws!

561
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:49,791
"My dear man."

562
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:04,662
"My dear man."

563
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,580
"My dear man."

564
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,862
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

565
00:35:13,942 --> 00:35:15,822
"My dear man."

566
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:22,102
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

567
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:24,676
"My dear man."

568
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:46,255
"There has been a telegram
from your in-laws."

569
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,910
"Look at that."

570
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:54,462
"There has been a telegram
from your in-laws."

571
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:59,851
"Your mother-in-law has been
a spinster since 70 years."

572
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:04,382
"If she gets a good groom.."

573
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:11,069
"If she gets a good groom,
she would be blessed."

574
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:13,140
"My dear man."

575
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:19,452
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

576
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:22,334
"My dear man."

577
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:44,976
"If you don't mind,
I would like to ask you, liar."

578
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:46,743
"You liar.."

579
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:53,053
"If you don't mind,
I would like to ask you, liar."

580
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:58,629
"Why do you hurt yourself
with your dreams?"

581
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:01,133
"You are crazy."

582
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,944
"You are a stranger."

583
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,926
"You are crazy. You are a stranger."

584
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:09,933
"What are you looking at?
Come here."

585
00:37:10,013 --> 00:37:12,212
"My dear man."

586
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:18,533
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

587
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,031
"My dear man."

588
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:47,156
"If you would leave secretly.."

589
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:56,173
"I would never be able to
tell you about my love."

590
00:37:57,422 --> 00:38:04,813
"Everything regarding my love
would be suppressed."

591
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:10,849
"My life would move
on through tears."

592
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:20,574
"If you would leave secretly."

593
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:26,092
"I would never be able to
tell you about my love."

594
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:30,418
"Everything regarding my love
would be suppressed."

595
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:34,872
"My life would move
on through tears."

596
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:40,082
"Then my dreams and aspirations.."

597
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,396
"Then my dreams and aspirations.."

598
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:46,316
"..would never be fulfilled."

599
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,497
"My dear man."

600
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:54,759
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

601
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:56,721
"My dear man."

602
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:03,115
"Where are you going at
this time of the night?"

603
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:06,438
"My dear man."

604
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,526
Tell me, do you still
want to run away?

605
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:13,314
How can I escape?
You have caught me.

606
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:16,680
I haven't stopped you.
Go on if you want to.

607
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:20,641
This is strange!
First you cut the bird's wings.

608
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:22,700
Then you say that you have freed it.

609
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,441
Tell me, Shanti.

610
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,937
How did you find out
about this secret?

611
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:29,481
I have a sharp sight.
- Really?

612
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:34,297
Yes. The ones who act over-smart..

613
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:37,382
..are trapped due to their mistakes.

614
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:38,681
What do you mean?

615
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:40,881
I mean your diary.
- My diary?

616
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,987
You don't have a right to
read a gentleman's diary.

617
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:47,277
Why did you lie to
a respectable girl?

618
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,162
If I wouldn't have lied..

619
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:53,281
..everything would have been hidden.

620
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,375
My life would pass by crying.

621
00:39:56,241 --> 00:40:01,401
Really? Your situation would
be similar to mine.

622
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:04,154
But this appears to
by only my condition.

623
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,081
A lie!
- It's true, Shanti.

624
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,055
Then why were you escaping quietly?

625
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,681
To save myself from your mother.

626
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,931
Try to think of a way out.

627
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,310
That's it. I've got a way.

628
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:24,096
Tomorrow this black cat
will cross before you.

629
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:26,528
Look, did you see him in the market.

630
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:29,397
Yes guru. I saw him.
- Come on.

631
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,068
Vijay! Vijay!

632
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:37,226
What is this? You came
straight to my home!

633
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:39,197
For God's sake, go back. What
if father comes back?

634
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:42,706
Has your father gone out?
You said he's ill.

635
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:45,661
Yes but he has to pay fees
for uncle's examination.

636
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,189
He has gone to borrow
200 rupees from somewhere.

637
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,466
Who would have 200 rupees in this
village ridden by poverty?!

638
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,660
No! Go away.
- Damn it!

639
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,426
Since I have come here you
are only saying one thing!

640
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:57,738
Go, go! You should ask me
why I have come here.

641
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,464
What is it?
- This matter concerns our lives. Come!

642
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:01,307
Yes, Guru.

643
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:05,506
Tell me quickly.

644
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,990
Don't hurry. That's bad.

645
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:11,986
My parents say that if I remain
a bachelor I will be ruined.

646
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:14,706
That is why they are arranging
my marriage.

647
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:16,906
Sit! Sit down.

648
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,306
The girl's family is coming
to see me next Sunday.

649
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:21,986
Have you seen the girl too?

650
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:26,183
Are you insulting my love? Silly girl!

651
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,850
After seeing you I would never
look at any other girl.

652
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,946
Tell me!

653
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,826
This darned boy is sitting
next to my daughter!

654
00:41:38,506 --> 00:41:40,016
Don't do that, sir. Don't!

655
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,906
He won't get hurt of you
hit him with this.

656
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,270
Take this one. I told
him many times.

657
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,580
But that fellow doesn't listen!

658
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,026
Is he that shameless?
- Too much!

659
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,706
I'll tell you. You were
going to borrow..

660
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:51,866
..200 rupees for your
brother's exam.

661
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:53,617
Yes.
- That's it.

662
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:56,914
This guy found out about it!
He broke into your house.

663
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,306
I won't spare him..
- Listen to what I say, sir.

664
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,706
He told me that an able boy's
studies should not..

665
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,031
..be hampered due to a deficiency
of 200 rupees!

666
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:06,346
The villagers and
I are useless then!

667
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:08,506
He has come to give
you 200 rupees, sir. -

668
00:42:09,113 --> 00:42:12,628
Oh! Is that so?
- Yes, sir. That is why I say that..

669
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:14,746
..good people have no right
to live in this world.

670
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:18,488
My love isn't like the movies.

671
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:20,357
I don't change women like a
new heroine in every film.

672
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:27,946
Son, forgive me. I didn't know that you..
- Guru!

673
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:29,706
Have you mortgaged your
watch and cycle..

674
00:42:29,786 --> 00:42:32,346
..for paying his brother's fees.

675
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:34,295
You have, right?
- Yes!

676
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:35,752
Now you have come to
give him that amount.

677
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:37,803
Money?
- Yes! Why don't you tell them?

678
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,372
Yes! We have to give the money.

679
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:43,278
He thought that you have come
to flirt with his daughter.

680
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:44,706
He had come to beat you up.

681
00:42:44,786 --> 00:42:48,350
Khatpatiya, no good man
is allowed to live.

682
00:42:48,756 --> 00:42:51,108
I am the only one who
has survived somehow.

683
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:53,941
People make colleges and schools.

684
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,706
Can't Mr. Balam pay 200 rupees..

685
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:57,759
..for a good boy's education?

686
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,906
Give it to them sir. Go on sir!

687
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:01,382
Yes! I have come to
give them the money.

688
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,950
Here. Take 200.

689
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:09,759
Son, you have done
a big favour to me.

690
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:14,436
I will repay this debt
as early as possible.

691
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:18,586
Sir, my rule is to do a favour
and to forget about it.

692
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:22,244
I have only heard wrong about you
from the villagers till today.

693
00:43:23,506 --> 00:43:27,426
The world is so. It is
against every god man.

694
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:30,706
Today I have found out
that the one who..

695
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:35,165
..is thought to be worthless
is actually a gem!

696
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,346
Forgive me!
- What is this, sir?

697
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:40,383
Don't fall at my feet and
address me as a deity.

698
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:42,678
These days God too faces problems.

699
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:46,942
- Alright, greetings. I'll leave.
- I'm going too. -

700
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:50,061
He came home without
asking and helped us.

701
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,666
He's a very good boy!
He's a great man!

702
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:58,382
Very bad! Very bad! Goodness
has left the world.

703
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,575
What if every man acts
in such a manner?

704
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:03,977
What is it? What happened?

705
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:07,593
Raj, whom we gave a room on rent,
is a thug!

706
00:44:07,673 --> 00:44:10,547
What are you saying?!
He is really a good boy.

707
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:12,441
Go away! Keep your certificate
to yourself.

708
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:15,807
Listen! What has he done?
Why are you over-reacting?

709
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:17,466
Didn't he say that he was married?
- Yes.

710
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:19,955
That was a lie! He isn't married!
A complete lie!

711
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:23,052
Is he a bachelor then?
- Of course!

712
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,692
What if he is?
Why are you getting so angry?

713
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,347
Be quiet! He lied to me.
He tricked me.

714
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:31,495
I am a public prosecutor.
I have control over the police!

715
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:33,361
I'll call them!
- Look..

716
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:35,745
Why do you call the police
for such a small affair?

717
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,502
Call him and reprimand him.

718
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:40,529
No! I don't want to talk to a liar.

719
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:42,062
If you want to,
you may call him and talk.

720
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:45,470
What should I say?
- Tell him, to get his wife if he has one.

721
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,769
Then we'll see what he does.

722
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,004
He doesn't have a wife!
Whom will he call?

723
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:51,288
That is what we have to see.

724
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:53,578
Does he still stick
to his lie or not.

725
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,183
He's coming. Say it.
Don't leave him.

726
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,201
Mr. Chaudhary, my exams are over.

727
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,921
Now I want to go to my village.
- Good! Very good!

728
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:07,794
Ask! Ask him.

729
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:10,628
Son, you didn't introduce your wife.

730
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,877
Bring her here before
you go to your village.

731
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:16,391
Are you narrating the alphabet?

732
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:17,650
There is nothing to
laugh in this case.

733
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,000
Why don't you get her?
Go now and get her here!

734
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:24,403
Didn't you understand?
- I understand. I'll get her.

735
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:27,481
You said that he isn't married but..

736
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:29,399
..he has gone to bring his wife.

737
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,755
That is what I want to see.

738
00:45:30,835 --> 00:45:34,507
He will lie again to hide
the previous lie.

739
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:37,503
Then I'll punish him.
Now I'll see whom he gets.

740
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:44,936
Look! Look who he has got!

741
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:48,165
What is this?
He has brought our daughter!

742
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,505
She is our child!
- Greetings, Mr. Chaudhary.

743
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:51,663
Greetings. Bless you.

744
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,561
What is all this? I don't..
- Be quiet.

745
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,543
Sit down. I'll explain.
- What?

746
00:45:56,934 --> 00:46:00,014
What did you just say to him?
- I told him to bring his wife.

747
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:01,663
Correct. You told him
to and he brought her.

748
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:03,121
Since when have you become his wife?

749
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:04,590
She isn't. She is going to be!

750
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,583
You decided without asking me.

751
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,263
Why not? Didn't you say that day..

752
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:10,943
That is regretful.
If he would be a bachelor..

753
00:46:11,023 --> 00:46:13,583
..I would get Shanti married
to him straight away.

754
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:15,318
Didn't you say that?
- I didn't say no.

755
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,543
Why then are you arguing?

756
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:18,608
You liked the boy,
I fixed their wedding.

757
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:20,623
Why did you have to
say so many lies?

758
00:46:20,703 --> 00:46:23,583
People say numerous lies
to make a marriage.

759
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:26,543
I did my work with one lie.
- You did a fine job.

760
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:29,583
Oh! So this is my reward!

761
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:33,943
You boy!
Leave this house right away!

762
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:35,823
My God! When did I ask for this?

763
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:37,343
You didn't say that but
that is what you meant.

764
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:39,023
Will you go or not?
- He won't go.

765
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,183
He won't go?
- No!

766
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:42,079
He won't go?
- No I said!

767
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,125
They both will go.
Go on you two. Go!

768
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:35,057
"The trouble between two hearts
has been resolved."

769
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:43,419
"The world has recognised love."

770
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:51,186
"Every goal for love is easy now."

771
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:59,331
"Two people have been introduced
to each other."

772
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:03,514
"The trouble between two hearts.."

773
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:32,069
"A pitiful man passed
though this lane."

774
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:40,109
"I don't know what you
did to call him."

775
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:44,469
"You called him in such a way.."

776
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:52,189
"He thought it over
and became yours."

777
00:48:52,410 --> 00:49:00,429
"The world saw this
and is surprised."

778
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:08,741
"Two people have been introduced
to each other."

779
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,596
"The trouble between two hearts.."

780
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:49,145
"I have been waiting for
you since a long time."

781
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:57,725
"Then I saw that you were
standing before me."

782
00:49:58,304 --> 00:50:02,021
"We locked eyes in such a way.."

783
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:05,946
"I forgot about the world."

784
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,559
"I couldn't think about anything."

785
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:17,576
"It is as though my soul
has lost its vigour."

786
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:25,766
"Two people have been introduced
to each other."

787
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:30,124
"The trouble between two hearts.."

788
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:58,482
"The beloved who had to
meet have met now."

789
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:06,665
"My stories have merged with yours."

790
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:14,689
"Now we have the same story
and the same tale."

791
00:51:15,265 --> 00:51:18,785
"Now we have the same song."

792
00:51:18,865 --> 00:51:26,880
"Two people have become one life."

793
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:34,960
"Two people have been introduced
to each other."

794
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:42,865
"The trouble between two hearts
has been resolved."

795
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:51,048
"The world has recognised love."

796
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,654
"The trouble between two hearts.."

797
00:52:01,425 --> 00:52:02,505
Daddy!

798
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,105
Daddy, who has sent that telegram?

799
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:08,864
Raj, your brother is a little ill.

800
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:11,105
Perhaps your niece has
sent this telegram.

801
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:13,424
Father ill. Come immediately. Vijay.

802
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:16,323
Mr. Chaudhary,
my brother is very ill.

803
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:19,847
I know that. Don't worry.
We will all come with you.

804
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:22,361
Go and get ready. Come.
- Come.

805
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:27,425
Father! Uncle has come.
- Raj has come?

806
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:28,861
Brother?
- Yes?

807
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,941
How are you feeling, brother?

808
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,238
- Nothing is wrong with me.
- I am just a little weak.

809
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:39,185
Tell me, how was your exam?
Will you pass or not?

810
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:42,271
The papers were good.
I will certainly pass.

811
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:45,470
I don't need anything else.

812
00:52:45,744 --> 00:52:48,167
Hansraj, don't worry about Raj.

813
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:50,975
He will pass and I will have him
learn till he gets his MA.

814
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,782
Raj.
- Yes, brother?

815
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:54,225
Who is he?

816
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:56,612
The same Chaudhary Hukumat Rai.

817
00:52:56,805 --> 00:53:00,536
I stay at his house.
- Oh!

818
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:08,625
Forgive me! Such a big man
has come to my house.

819
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,757
I can't even welcome
you with respect.

820
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:13,170
What are you saying, Mr. Hansraj?

821
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,981
Don't treat us as outsiders.

822
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:18,474
Raj is your brother
and is our prospective son-in-law.

823
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:21,252
This is our daughter, Shanti.
- Yes.

824
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:24,258
We want to get our daughter
Shanti married to Raj.

825
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:26,009
All we are waiting for
is your permission.

826
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:30,585
You ask me for permission?

827
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:35,792
I feel as though my brother
has been very lucky.

828
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:37,356
I am the one who is lucky, Hansraj.

829
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,184
I got a son-in-law like Raj.

830
00:53:39,504 --> 00:53:41,896
Maybe you don't know how
talented your brother is.

831
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,840
Only time will tell what
a man he turns out to be.

832
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:46,960
He will certainly be.

833
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,042
If he remains under the protection
of elders like you..

834
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:58,252
..there is no doubt that
he will be a great man.

835
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,200
Father.

836
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,382
- Father!
- Hail Ram!

837
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:14,000
Did you hear that child?
Your uncle will be a famous man.

838
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,800
Today my dream has come true.

839
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:20,593
Raj is getting married to a
girl of such a good family.

840
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,079
We will be related to
such virtuous people.

841
00:54:25,254 --> 00:54:26,682
Please rest father!

842
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:34,923
Father!
- You ask me to rest and are crying!

843
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:41,549
I am not crying, father.
- Are you trying to deceive me?

844
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,012
Are you thinking that..

845
00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:54,732
..I have done nothing for you?

846
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:56,200
Why do you say that father?

847
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,925
It would be better
if I sent you away after being wed.

848
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:11,349
However, after Raj is married
to a girl of a respected family..

849
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:17,280
..you will get a good husband too.

850
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,716
Brother, do you think I will get
married before Vijay does?

851
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:26,000
No. First I will get
Vijay married in a good family.

852
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,616
After that I will think
about my wedding.

853
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,053
Did you hear what your
uncle is saying?

854
00:55:32,389 --> 00:55:37,360
Why are you crying?
Raj will do everything he can for you.

855
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,268
He will be better than me.

856
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:44,000
Brother, it is my duty
to keep Vijay happy.

857
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:47,720
Raj. Vijay.

858
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:51,200
Raj's wife.

859
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:57,960
This is such a jolly time.

860
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:08,000
Raj has passed.
He became an officer.

861
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,800
Vijay's wedding procession
is on its way.

862
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:18,762
Raj is wearing a garland.

863
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,920
Raj.. Raj..

864
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:31,710
I am your..

865
00:56:40,426 --> 00:56:44,921
Raj. Be brave, Raj.

866
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:48,486
Take Vijay and come to the
town as soon as possible.

867
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:51,627
How can I come?
I have to take care of the entire house.

868
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:54,115
I also have to find
a groom for Vijay.

869
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:57,641
Certainly. Get a suitable
groom for him quickly.

870
00:56:57,871 --> 00:56:59,282
Then bring them to the town.

871
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:02,116
We'll get Vijay and Shanti
married together.

872
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,291
Don't worry about anything.
I will take care of everything.

873
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:08,013
Okay.

874
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:12,081
Come.

875
00:57:43,454 --> 00:57:46,790
Snake!
- What happened?

876
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:49,414
A snake!
- What are you blabbering about?

877
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,227
Wait!
- No! No!

878
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:53,711
Leave me! Do you think Balam
can't do anything?

879
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:54,599
Hold this cigarette.

880
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,488
No, Balam.
- Oh my God!

881
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:00,757
Oh my God!

882
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:07,623
Give me my cigarette.

883
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:08,879
What would you do if
he would bite you?

884
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:10,039
What if he bit me?

885
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,879
People have fought lions
and elephants for love.

886
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:17,225
Can't I kill a snake for saving my love?
- No..

887
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:20,719
I know.
You are still sad for your father.

888
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:23,119
Ok. Let's go to a fair.
You will feel better.

889
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,959
I won't feel good.
- A fair comes only once in a year.

890
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:29,291
No. I have to go home.
My pot has broken down.

891
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:30,353
Oh! The pot!

892
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:31,799
Yes! We'll take the pot from there.

893
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:33,399
Look, I won't take no for an answer.
Come. Come!

894
00:58:33,479 --> 00:58:34,559
Come along!

895
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:38,093
Vijay. Vijay!

896
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,752
Vijay!

897
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:29,682
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

898
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:32,963
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

899
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:36,934
"My beloved, you may test my love."

900
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:41,159
"My beloved, you may test my love."

901
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:45,606
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

902
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,816
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

903
00:59:48,896 --> 00:59:52,756
"This affection may hurt.
Keep away from it."

904
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:57,020
"This affection may hurt.
Keep away from it."

905
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:31,119
"I will die due to you."

906
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,839
"I will make myself famous
in this world."

907
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:42,559
"By dying, I will bring myself
closer to your love."

908
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,396
"I will die due to you."

909
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,399
"I have seen many lovers like you."

910
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:51,339
"The ones who swear by love.
Hey Jamalo!"

911
01:00:51,419 --> 01:00:53,644
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

912
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:58,073
"My beloved, you may test my love."

913
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:01,439
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

914
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,485
"This affection may hurt.
Keep away from it."

915
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:52,959
"Look at this lover."

916
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,618
"He is like a bee without wings."

917
01:01:56,872 --> 01:02:00,439
"He can't deceive me."

918
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,119
"I know him very well."

919
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,998
"Look at this lover."

920
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:09,851
"You may hurt me, I won't mind."

921
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:11,879
"I won't stop loving you."

922
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:15,119
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

923
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,149
It's a bow and arrow,
show the heart.

924
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:22,825
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

925
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:26,913
"My beloved, you may test my love."

926
01:02:45,252 --> 01:02:48,879
"You won't listen to
me when I am alive."

927
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,839
"You would realize who
I was when I will die."

928
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,566
"I have realized your love."

929
01:02:56,886 --> 01:03:00,386
"Come, hold my hand."

930
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:04,236
"Come, hold my hand."

931
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:06,160
"Smile and be my companion."

932
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,099
"I am yours and you are mine."

933
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:10,146
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

934
01:03:10,226 --> 01:03:11,559
"Hey Jamalo!"

935
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,666
"My beloved, you may test my love."

936
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:19,759
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

937
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,977
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

938
01:03:23,057 --> 01:03:26,821
"This affection may hurt.
Keep away from it."

939
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:31,036
"This affection may hurt.
Keep away from it."

940
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:41,588
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

941
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:45,284
"Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!"

942
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:11,719
Vijay!
- Uncle, the old pot broke.

943
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:13,284
I was delayed while trying
to buy the new pot.

944
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,412
Really?
- What, uncle?

945
01:04:15,492 --> 01:04:16,960
It's not just the old
pot that has broken.

946
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:18,741
You have also destroyed
the respect..

947
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,219
..that this family has for itself.

948
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:23,752
You should have remembered that
your father has just died.

949
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:25,569
You have started dancing around..

950
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:26,935
..with that worthless Balam.

951
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:28,240
Uncle, you may call me anything..

952
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,266
..but don't call him worthless.

953
01:04:29,346 --> 01:04:32,381
- You are supporting him!
- Father!

954
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:36,528
Shameless girl! Don't take
the name of that great man!

955
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,013
If father would have
seen you with him..

956
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:40,595
..he would have killed you.

957
01:04:41,184 --> 01:04:43,471
Uncle, if father would
be alive today..

958
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:45,292
..he wouldn't do such a thing.

959
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,054
He would ask me
what I want and what I desire.

960
01:04:49,134 --> 01:04:50,072
Tell me what he means to you!

961
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,564
He is the one who
wants to marry me..

962
01:04:52,644 --> 01:04:54,923
..and make me his own.
- Vijay!

963
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,395
What are you saying?!
Balam will marry you?!

964
01:04:58,475 --> 01:04:59,213
Yes.

965
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:01,835
Vijay, think wisely.
Don't act foolishly by blind love.

966
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:05,099
Balam isn't a man who can
be loyal to someone.

967
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:07,308
He will leave you midway.

968
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:10,635
Uncle you have only seen him.
Not his love.

969
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:13,188
In my childhood,
he risked his life to save mine..

970
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:15,435
..when I was about
to drown in a well.

971
01:05:16,028 --> 01:05:19,205
Even today, if he wouldn't have..

972
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,315
..saved me from a snake,
I would die.

973
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:23,330
This doesn't mean that
he is a good man.

974
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,995
He is a very good man.
That's not all.

975
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:30,439
When father couldn't get
money for your exam..

976
01:05:30,656 --> 01:05:34,139
..he loaned everything he had
and gave the money to father.

977
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,715
Father had said what
a good boy he was.

978
01:05:37,941 --> 01:05:39,955
He helped us even
when we didn't ask him for it.

979
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:42,696
Father saw his goodness
and thanked him.

980
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:45,140
It is possible that brother
may have become emotional.

981
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:46,816
Vijay, I'll return his money.

982
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:51,824
He won't take it back.
Uncle, don't measure him by money.

983
01:05:51,955 --> 01:05:54,908
Look at his heart.
- What should I see and..

984
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,035
..what should I not see?

985
01:05:56,715 --> 01:06:00,328
We both see him to be different.

986
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:04,980
Yes. No one will think
that I am right now.

987
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:08,635
Father did but he is dead now.
- Vijay!

988
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:11,595
He was the only one who knew.

989
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:16,315
It would have been better
if I too would die with father!

990
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,272
Don't speak so harshly, Vijay.

991
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,224
Brother has not just
given you to me.

992
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:26,274
He has also entrusted me with
your happiness and fate.

993
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:29,396
I will never hurt you.

994
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:35,249
I thought that a wrong step
shouldn't ruin your life.

995
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:37,616
The one who makes a mistake
deserves punishment.

996
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:40,258
If such a thing happens,
I won't blame you.

997
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:43,715
However, forgetting this
is impossible for me now.

998
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:48,710
Whether I agree to it or not..

999
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,181
..but everything
will be as you want to be.

1000
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:56,140
Uncle! Uncle!
- Vijay!

1001
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:01,294
- Uncle.
- Don't cry, Vijay. Don't cry.

1002
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:07,071
If you cry I will think
that my brother is happy. -

1003
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:10,833
Don't cry. Vijay.

1004
01:07:13,226 --> 01:07:15,266
Look, what you say is right.

1005
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:17,856
But Balam should approve
of this wedding.

1006
01:07:18,003 --> 01:07:21,336
He certainly will.
They love each other.

1007
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:24,696
That's not all.
They have even decided to get married.

1008
01:07:24,776 --> 01:07:27,634
A marriage is decided by parents.
- Think about it.

1009
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:31,494
In their children's happiness,
lies parents' happiness too.

1010
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,911
If you refuse,
that poor girl will be ruined.

1011
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:40,792
All I know is that
Vijay can't survive without Balam.

1012
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:45,059
But still..
- Listen. Please come here.

1013
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:46,322
Excuse me. I'll return soon.

1014
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,746
Sorry.
- Look ahead while walking.

1015
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:03,796
Why would I fall if I could see?

1016
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:05,093
Forgive me.

1017
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:09,925
It's alright.

1018
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:21,647
Look, we don't refuse to this relation.

1019
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:25,538
The whole village praises
your late brother Hansraj.

1020
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:28,155
But we are more worried
about Gauri's..

1021
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:29,797
..wedding rather than Balam's.

1022
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:34,341
Gauri? The girl who just went in?

1023
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,155
Yes, she is blind.

1024
01:08:38,404 --> 01:08:41,446
We may bribe someone with dowry
and get her married somewhere.

1025
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:46,534
But we don't have money.
If you help us with money..

1026
01:08:47,228 --> 01:08:49,514
..we agree to Balam's
wedding with Vijay.

1027
01:08:49,965 --> 01:08:54,358
Look, I have many problems too
but I accept your condition.

1028
01:08:55,387 --> 01:08:58,883
Hey mister, you are exploiting
my father's helplessness.

1029
01:08:58,963 --> 01:09:01,467
You are benefiting from my love.

1030
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:04,494
Son, be quiet. This is a matter
of your sister's life and death.

1031
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,312
As if I don't care about my sister!

1032
01:09:07,392 --> 01:09:09,966
Mother, I speak less and think more.
I think a lot!

1033
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,486
Let me give you some advice.
- Tell me.

1034
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:14,887
Instead of helping us with money..

1035
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:16,433
..why don't you get married to Gauri?

1036
01:09:16,513 --> 01:09:17,759
What?
- What do you mean by 'what'?

1037
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,640
What if she is blind?
She is beautiful and cultured.

1038
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,087
She takes care of household chores..

1039
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,231
..better than a person with sight.

1040
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:24,380
But...
- What?

1041
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,205
This way our family's bond
will be strengthened.

1042
01:09:27,889 --> 01:09:30,008
If you accept,
two houses will flourish.

1043
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:33,862
If you refuse I will move
away from my happiness.

1044
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:37,645
For my sister's happiness,
I will sacrifice my love.

1045
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:41,433
I will move around like crazy
talking Vijay's name.

1046
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:45,331
Vijay too will be a spinster
forever in my remembrance.

1047
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,200
I can't do anything more than that.

1048
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:57,104
Very good, guru! You are great!

1049
01:09:57,263 --> 01:09:58,271
You have made a spectacular move!

1050
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:03,356
He could have got money from
his rich father-in-law too.

1051
01:10:03,436 --> 01:10:06,636
Now Raj won't refuse to
marry that rich girl..

1052
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,414
..and I won't be troubled
due to Vijay either!

1053
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:13,141
Come on. Let's drink some tea.

1054
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,676
Why have you bought two
similar wedding saris?

1055
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:20,141
One for Shanti and
another for Vijay.

1056
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:21,683
There shouldn't be any difference
between the two.

1057
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:22,570
Correct.

1058
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,849
See? Father and daughter
are both generous.

1059
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,516
The mother isn't ungenerous either.

1060
01:10:26,676 --> 01:10:30,287
How can that be?
Mahalaxmi has to be benevolent.

1061
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,116
Sir.
- What is it, brother?

1062
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,362
Why do you appear to be so sad?

1063
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:37,702
Didn't you stitch the clothes?

1064
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,800
What do I say, madam?
My workers don't work properly.

1065
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,843
They kept a hot iron on your
dress and forgot about it.

1066
01:10:42,923 --> 01:10:44,831
What?! Did they all get burnt?

1067
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:48,196
No. Just the groom's shirt was burnt.
- Show it!

1068
01:10:49,248 --> 01:10:52,492
There. Raj has come.
He will live a long life.

1069
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:54,891
Hey you.
Move this shirt and go away.

1070
01:10:56,186 --> 01:10:59,956
Come, son Raj.
What are you staring at?

1071
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:02,356
Your son-in-law has come.
Get something to eat.

1072
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,236
I'll get something, dad.
- First ask him what he wants.

1073
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:09,110
- I know what he drinks.
- Very good!

1074
01:11:09,316 --> 01:11:13,587
Come son, sit.
- Mr. Chaudhary. I apologize.

1075
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,472
Apology for what? I know you
came late but you have come.

1076
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:19,578
Is Vijay well?
Did you get a groom for her?

1077
01:11:19,724 --> 01:11:21,273
Yes.
- Very good!

1078
01:11:21,353 --> 01:11:24,864
Son, we have already made
two pairs for everything.

1079
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:28,013
You don't know
what I have come to tell you.

1080
01:11:28,093 --> 01:11:31,059
Look, don't talk about a favour
and embarrass me.

1081
01:11:31,446 --> 01:11:34,516
I am ashamed and can't speak,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1082
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:41,537
I can't marry Shanti.
- What?

1083
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:49,418
Raj, maybe you mean that
your conditions..

1084
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:50,926
You may assume them
to be my conditions.

1085
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:56,516
The person whom Vijay wants
to marry has a blind sister.

1086
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:58,803
So what?
- She..

1087
01:12:00,694 --> 01:12:02,464
Is that the condition
for Vijay's marriage?

1088
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:05,196
You are to marry that blind girl?

1089
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:07,005
Yes.

1090
01:12:09,275 --> 01:12:10,290
What have you decided?

1091
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,615
There is nothing to be decided.

1092
01:12:14,395 --> 01:12:16,008
You know about the promise that..

1093
01:12:16,214 --> 01:12:18,609
..I gave to brother as he was dying.

1094
01:12:19,473 --> 01:12:22,519
You also know that only
after hearing it..

1095
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:24,411
..did he die with peace.

1096
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,595
Tell me, how can I do
that to his daughter?

1097
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:34,539
But try to understand
my situation too Raj.

1098
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:36,291
What decision would
you take if you..

1099
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:37,764
..would have been in my place?

1100
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:39,808
If you would be my elder brother..

1101
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:44,531
..and I wouldn't fulfil my promise,
what would you think about me?

1102
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:47,889
That would make you a traitor.

1103
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:51,367
Do you want to make a traitor
your son-in-law?

1104
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:57,880
No Raj. I think that sacrifice
is the greatest thing.

1105
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:11,014
Only a father would
understand what..

1106
01:13:11,328 --> 01:13:13,450
..Shanti must be going
through right now.

1107
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:18,001
Raj, I won't force you for anything.

1108
01:13:18,635 --> 01:13:20,851
I'll explain it to Shanti somehow.

1109
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:26,596
For now, go and console her.

1110
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:30,014
Explain to her that
if coming together..

1111
01:13:30,094 --> 01:13:33,254
..symbolizes the earth,
sacrifice is the sky.

1112
01:13:35,919 --> 01:13:36,814
Go on.

1113
01:13:50,441 --> 01:13:51,734
Shanti.

1114
01:13:53,868 --> 01:13:55,430
I am guilty.

1115
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:01,014
But you think about
this also that why..

1116
01:14:01,094 --> 01:14:04,544
..did I take away your
smile and made you cry?

1117
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,804
You can take it as my helplessness.

1118
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:10,614
Or my bad luck.

1119
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:14,245
But I had to take this decision.

1120
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,428
Actually, I am the unfortunate one.

1121
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,014
And I've got the blame
of turning out..

1122
01:14:19,094 --> 01:14:21,366
..your fortune to misfortune.

1123
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,110
I got the passion of
love ignited in you.

1124
01:14:25,675 --> 01:14:28,461
And when that started
to flare violently..

1125
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:30,778
..I got it extinguished.

1126
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:36,611
I promised to flower your
path and got thorns spread.

1127
01:14:36,941 --> 01:14:39,594
I know, the pain that
I am leaving in your heart..

1128
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:42,628
..and going is something
more worse than death.

1129
01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:47,927
Was it not better Shanti
that I never could've come in your life.

1130
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:53,500
And I could die before I could
see your desires, die.

1131
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,414
Don't say so, Raj.

1132
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:06,954
It's not even your fault.

1133
01:15:08,363 --> 01:15:12,572
One who breaks someone's heart
is the real culprit.

1134
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:16,014
And the one who breaks
his own heart..

1135
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,534
..for the happiness
of somebody else's.

1136
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:19,668
He's actually a God.

1137
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,008
No Shanti.

1138
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:23,916
You're trying to cover up
my disloyalty to love by..

1139
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,112
..giving the name of sacrifice,
to my selfishness.

1140
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:30,543
The loyalty to duty is
much higher than to..

1141
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:32,663
..that of the loyalty to love.

1142
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:37,543
Even if you'd got me by
forgetting your duty.

1143
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,899
Then all my life
I'd have thought that..

1144
01:15:41,172 --> 01:15:44,263
..I did marry a selfish man.

1145
01:15:46,187 --> 01:15:51,652
Actually, you're marrying a
blind girl by rejecting me.

1146
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:55,623
You're becoming an eye for
some one's blind eyes.

1147
01:15:57,047 --> 01:16:00,431
Whenever I'll think of
it I'll be able to..

1148
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:04,035
..visualize a picture of
yours like a praying..

1149
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:09,436
..woman opens her eyes
after meditation and..

1150
01:16:10,585 --> 01:16:14,663
..sees that her God is standing
in front of her.

1151
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:15,903
Shanti.

1152
01:16:17,038 --> 01:16:18,263
I am an unfortunate.

1153
01:16:19,394 --> 01:16:21,157
That I did not get the opportunity..

1154
01:16:21,237 --> 01:16:23,086
..to stay with that God.

1155
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:27,053
But, this too is my luck.

1156
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:30,354
That every day in my meditation..

1157
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:35,863
..I'd be offering my prayer flowers
at the feet of that God.

1158
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,623
Go Raj.

1159
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:42,303
Go on the path of your duty
with great joy.

1160
01:16:43,322 --> 01:16:44,054
I..

1161
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:49,023
I'll see you off smilingly.

1162
01:16:49,182 --> 01:16:50,293
Shanti.

1163
01:16:51,683 --> 01:16:57,223
I know of the pains hidden
behind this smile.

1164
01:16:57,999 --> 01:17:00,188
Your brain has forgiven me for sure.

1165
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:05,343
If possible, please ask your
heart to forgive me too.

1166
01:17:22,488 --> 01:17:25,019
You look like a picture
of beauty, Gauri.

1167
01:17:31,216 --> 01:17:32,384
Crazy.

1168
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:33,997
It's actually a time to celebrate.

1169
01:17:34,797 --> 01:17:38,757
And then I am marrying Gauri
happily for happiness.

1170
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,057
Laugh.

1171
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:43,637
Laugh.

1172
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:26,272
"Actually, 'The Lord' did bless
you today, out of joy."

1173
01:18:26,692 --> 01:18:35,872
"Got you a place in flowers
by picking up from thorns."

1174
01:18:42,272 --> 01:18:48,490
"Why should I be living
on false hopes?"

1175
01:18:48,952 --> 01:18:59,746
"I do have the right to go back."

1176
01:19:00,263 --> 01:19:05,214
"If he's got me here."

1177
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:13,850
"Don't get despaired, understand.."

1178
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:18,531
"..the gesture of nature."

1179
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:27,752
"The forehead of yours
has got shining now."

1180
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:37,157
"The rope of hope shouldn't
let go off your hand."

1181
01:19:37,504 --> 01:19:41,598
"Like a coward."

1182
01:19:42,447 --> 01:19:51,762
"Don't take to death like a coward."

1183
01:19:52,571 --> 01:19:59,656
"Don't take to death."

1184
01:20:25,477 --> 01:20:26,421
Mr. Raj.

1185
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:27,705
Congratulations!

1186
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:30,113
I've got this present from
Mr. Hukmat Rai's end.

1187
01:20:37,202 --> 01:20:38,353
'Son Raj.'

1188
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,162
'Hand over this necklace
and sari from my end..'

1189
01:20:41,242 --> 01:20:43,552
'..to my niece Vijay,
on this auspicious moment."

1190
01:20:43,983 --> 01:20:45,472
'You assume this as a
present from your..'

1191
01:20:45,552 --> 01:20:47,792
'..brother Hansraj's end.'

1192
01:20:48,472 --> 01:20:51,352
'Give the other one to
my daughter, Gauri.'

1193
01:20:51,951 --> 01:20:55,672
'Best wishes from all of us.'

1194
01:21:11,799 --> 01:21:12,822
Vijay.

1195
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,591
Take this.

1196
01:21:25,193 --> 01:21:26,104
What's this?

1197
01:21:26,184 --> 01:21:27,712
The wedding night.

1198
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:29,152
Rubbish!

1199
01:21:29,381 --> 01:21:31,753
Such a small room.

1200
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:33,197
Small room.

1201
01:21:33,371 --> 01:21:34,938
Yuck..!
Yuck..!

1202
01:21:35,231 --> 01:21:39,152
The honeymoon should take
place on mount 'Everest'.

1203
01:21:39,232 --> 01:21:39,907
Did you understand?

1204
01:21:39,987 --> 01:21:41,357
What's this?

1205
01:21:41,507 --> 01:21:42,586
A garden!

1206
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:44,466
It has all the flowers.

1207
01:21:44,546 --> 01:21:47,112
But, where's the cabbage?

1208
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,727
Who are you?

1209
01:21:49,264 --> 01:21:49,964
Sorry!

1210
01:21:50,044 --> 01:21:51,932
Oh Anarkali!

1211
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:55,193
Are you shy of your, Birbal?

1212
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,543
I am yours, Vijay.

1213
01:21:56,623 --> 01:21:57,678
I see.

1214
01:21:57,758 --> 01:22:00,281
You're the one who used
to meet me at farms.

1215
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:01,526
But..

1216
01:22:01,606 --> 01:22:03,550
I am your wife now.

1217
01:22:03,756 --> 01:22:05,621
From being a lover,
you've become a wife?

1218
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:07,112
Alas!

1219
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,801
Is it that, you didn't
want to marry me?

1220
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:11,951
What's in marriage?

1221
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:14,625
The days before the marriage
were so enjoyable.

1222
01:22:14,705 --> 01:22:16,680
Singing duet in open and now..

1223
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,566
The world's a cart and
we, the bullocks. Understood?

1224
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:22,138
Why are you standing? Come sit.

1225
01:22:22,218 --> 01:22:23,265
I asked you to sit.

1226
01:22:23,345 --> 01:22:24,160
Come.

1227
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:25,963
After that..

1228
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:27,760
..the oven got lighted..

1229
01:22:28,065 --> 01:22:30,096
..and the bread got made.

1230
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,967
Till today I've only got
to hear your complaint..

1231
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:36,246
..from the villagers.

1232
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:41,038
Why talk of the world, it
only is against the good.

1233
01:22:41,443 --> 01:22:43,387
But I've realised today
that the one who was..

1234
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:49,012
..taken to be as worthless
is actually so precious.

1235
01:22:53,058 --> 01:22:55,145
Don't put me in a difficult
situation, Vijay.

1236
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:58,928
Brother didn't only hand
over you to me but..

1237
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:02,174
..he also made me the guardian
of your happiness.

1238
01:23:03,182 --> 01:23:05,498
I won't let your heart
break in any condition.

1239
01:23:06,152 --> 01:23:09,643
I was only thinking if
a wrong step of yours..

1240
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:11,363
..could get your life derailed.

1241
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,080
God!

1242
01:23:15,508 --> 01:23:16,809
Gauri.

1243
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,150
What's this you're doing?

1244
01:23:19,588 --> 01:23:21,664
Its here that lies my happiness.

1245
01:23:22,045 --> 01:23:23,320
You sit here.

1246
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,000
Why don't you sit please?

1247
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:26,600
Yes, I too shall sit.

1248
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,364
As I can't see you.

1249
01:23:47,506 --> 01:23:52,774
Nonetheless, I've got a beautiful
picture made of yours in my mind.

1250
01:23:54,285 --> 01:23:56,665
Now, you only are my eyes.

1251
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,050
From the time I've got
you, I feel as if..

1252
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,658
..I've got my sight back.

1253
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:09,630
Now, I'll be able to see the
world through your eyes.

1254
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:13,000
Gauri, the God didn't
bless you with eyes.

1255
01:24:13,432 --> 01:24:15,742
But, don't mention it all the while.

1256
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,920
Sleep.

1257
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,920
Brother.

1258
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:29,523
I've fulfilled my promise
given to you.

1259
01:24:30,886 --> 01:24:36,505
But I am afraid, Vijay
won't be happy.

1260
01:24:38,523 --> 01:24:42,344
Brother, forgive me.

1261
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,228
Shanti.

1262
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,692
I've refused your love, Shanti.

1263
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,256
I've done injustice to you.

1264
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,780
But still, you've forgiven me.

1265
01:25:05,339 --> 01:25:06,320
You..

1266
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:10,112
You're great, Shanti.

1267
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,560
You're great.

1268
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:17,342
You're great, Shanti.

1269
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,000
Shanti.

1270
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:29,821
Greetings.

1271
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:31,212
Dear, Raj!

1272
01:25:31,412 --> 01:25:32,492
You've come after many days.

1273
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:33,772
Greeting, aunt.

1274
01:25:33,852 --> 01:25:34,725
May, God bless you dear.

1275
01:25:34,805 --> 01:25:36,092
I hope you're fine.
- Yes.

1276
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,111
How's Gauri?

1277
01:25:37,191 --> 01:25:38,304
She's good, aunt.

1278
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:41,151
You'll be leaving for the
holy places so early..

1279
01:25:41,444 --> 01:25:42,572
..I'd not thought of it.

1280
01:25:42,652 --> 01:25:44,467
Son, we'd to go anyway.

1281
01:25:44,892 --> 01:25:47,732
So, we thought it'd be better
if we leave early.

1282
01:25:49,596 --> 01:25:50,972
Balam is not visible.

1283
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:52,732
I've been waiting for him only.

1284
01:25:53,397 --> 01:25:55,834
What to say, he's not returned
home for last two days.

1285
01:25:57,732 --> 01:25:58,468
Son, you please sit.

1286
01:25:58,548 --> 01:25:59,744
I'll call Vijay.

1287
01:25:59,824 --> 01:26:00,746
Ok, aunt.

1288
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,932
Daughter-in-law.
- Yes, mother.

1289
01:26:03,077 --> 01:26:05,032
Daughter-in-law, look,
your uncle has come.

1290
01:26:05,252 --> 01:26:06,412
Uncle!

1291
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:10,757
Uncle!

1292
01:26:13,316 --> 01:26:14,572
How's Gauri aunt?

1293
01:26:14,812 --> 01:26:15,892
How about you?

1294
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:17,812
Everything's fine.

1295
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:21,972
Vijay, Balam..
- He's just gone out.

1296
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:23,892
Yes, uncle was saying.

1297
01:26:25,078 --> 01:26:26,972
I tried a lot to make you understand.

1298
01:26:27,611 --> 01:26:30,175
Still, I got you married
to your desire.

1299
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,892
Now your happiness is in your hands.

1300
01:26:33,713 --> 01:26:36,492
This doesn't mean that
my responsibility is over.

1301
01:26:37,329 --> 01:26:39,208
All my life I'll only
wish that you ask..

1302
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:41,854
..for something and
I do that for you.

1303
01:26:41,934 --> 01:26:43,048
Oh hello!

1304
01:26:43,128 --> 01:26:45,510
In-law brother.
You're here?

1305
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,682
Perhaps, you've come
to see your niece.

1306
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:49,258
Why, can't I come to see you?

1307
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:51,288
Good people like you don't
come to meet me.

1308
01:26:51,434 --> 01:26:53,172
My class is slightly higher.

1309
01:26:53,252 --> 01:26:55,532
I'd not seen Vijay after marriage.

1310
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,212
So I thought of seeing her once.

1311
01:26:57,424 --> 01:26:58,410
You've come.

1312
01:26:58,657 --> 01:27:00,332
But do you know, why I
didn't come to you..

1313
01:27:00,412 --> 01:27:02,122
..to see my dear sister?

1314
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:03,061
Why didn't you come?

1315
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:05,702
That's because, the distance
proves good for relations.

1316
01:27:05,782 --> 01:27:07,061
You too understand this.

1317
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:08,927
After marriage,
Vijay is my problem and..

1318
01:27:09,007 --> 01:27:10,323
..Gauri's yours.

1319
01:27:10,403 --> 01:27:12,025
So, why don't we take care
of our own problems?

1320
01:27:12,105 --> 01:27:14,224
I think you're an intelligent man.

1321
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:15,618
You must've understood what I meant.

1322
01:27:16,151 --> 01:27:20,926
Ok, I'll tell Vijay that her
uncle has given his blessings.

1323
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,038
Good bye.

1324
01:27:31,124 --> 01:27:32,266
Daughter, Shanti.

1325
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:34,692
The result of BA is out.

1326
01:27:35,256 --> 01:27:36,570
What happened, father?

1327
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:37,934
What'll happen?

1328
01:27:38,173 --> 01:27:40,822
If you could've worked hard,
I would babbled..

1329
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:43,332
..in front of the world
saying, you did this.

1330
01:27:43,412 --> 01:27:44,812
You did that.

1331
01:27:45,214 --> 01:27:48,332
Now, I'll only say that
the daughter of..

1332
01:27:48,412 --> 01:27:51,098
..famous 'Public prosecutor'
has passed in first class.

1333
01:27:52,436 --> 01:27:53,324
You were nervous, right?

1334
01:27:53,404 --> 01:27:54,441
See this..

1335
01:27:57,019 --> 01:27:58,206
Father.

1336
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:00,808
Get me admitted to law college.

1337
01:28:01,066 --> 01:28:01,989
Really!

1338
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:03,861
So, my daughter's surely
going to be a barrister?

1339
01:28:04,324 --> 01:28:05,752
Very good.
- Very good.

1340
01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:07,117
What, very good.

1341
01:28:07,197 --> 01:28:09,948
Oh dear! Your daughter has passed
in first class.

1342
01:28:10,028 --> 01:28:11,704
Flatter her a bit.

1343
01:28:11,922 --> 01:28:14,229
Being my daughter, could she have failed?
- That's what.

1344
01:28:14,387 --> 01:28:16,394
But, there's no need
for her studying law.

1345
01:28:16,474 --> 01:28:17,704
Yes.
There's no need.

1346
01:28:17,784 --> 01:28:19,286
This house has got everything
by God's grace.

1347
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,111
Yes, it has.

1348
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:22,103
Now worry about getting her married.

1349
01:28:22,183 --> 01:28:23,456
Yes, that's right.

1350
01:28:23,921 --> 01:28:25,137
Mother.

1351
01:28:25,304 --> 01:28:26,827
Don't talk about my marriage.

1352
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:30,201
Daughter. To get their daughter married
is every parent's wish.

1353
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:31,400
Father.

1354
01:28:31,698 --> 01:28:33,957
If you don't want me to
study law, then don't.

1355
01:28:34,592 --> 01:28:35,658
But..

1356
01:28:35,738 --> 01:28:37,125
But, don't talk about marriage.

1357
01:28:37,205 --> 01:28:38,274
Why?

1358
01:28:38,588 --> 01:28:40,317
You forgot so soon.

1359
01:28:40,787 --> 01:28:42,692
What'd happened in this
house few days back?

1360
01:28:42,825 --> 01:28:44,390
What was that?
- Please look.

1361
01:28:44,874 --> 01:28:46,194
Let this poor study.

1362
01:28:46,429 --> 01:28:47,662
The time's the biggest doctor.

1363
01:28:47,742 --> 01:28:49,014
Slowly, she'll forget everything.

1364
01:28:49,147 --> 01:28:50,276
You're more intelligent than me.

1365
01:28:50,356 --> 01:28:52,210
It's not so.
- What more can I do?

1366
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,264
Let her study.

1367
01:28:53,398 --> 01:28:54,807
At the slightest pretext, you..

1368
01:28:55,238 --> 01:28:56,476
You're happy now?

1369
01:28:56,556 --> 01:28:57,854
Become a barrister.

1370
01:28:58,387 --> 01:29:00,113
Father.
- This paper..

1371
01:29:01,259 --> 01:29:02,196
Oh yes!

1372
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:03,712
Raj has passed.

1373
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,276
Seeing his name topping the list..

1374
01:29:06,356 --> 01:29:08,815
..I did feel happy as
well as, shocked.

1375
01:29:10,318 --> 01:29:12,550
Shocked because, I'd thought
of making him..

1376
01:29:13,038 --> 01:29:14,775
..a successful lawyer as he's able.

1377
01:29:15,663 --> 01:29:18,424
Man proposes God disposes.

1378
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:29,356
Gauri.

1379
01:29:29,436 --> 01:29:30,516
What have you done this?

1380
01:29:30,707 --> 01:29:32,055
I was sweeping.

1381
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:35,480
You've put all the dirt in the rice.

1382
01:29:36,013 --> 01:29:37,575
It was a mistake.

1383
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:39,842
Since I can't see.

1384
01:29:40,312 --> 01:29:42,175
That's why I say,
what the need to work is.

1385
01:29:42,255 --> 01:29:43,226
You be seated.

1386
01:29:43,306 --> 01:29:44,535
But..

1387
01:29:44,775 --> 01:29:47,895
Doing the household chores
is the duty of a woman.

1388
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:54,028
Even this doesn't look good
that I keep sitting.

1389
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,655
And you do all the work.

1390
01:29:57,455 --> 01:30:00,415
If you can't do any work,
what benefit is it doing?

1391
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:02,655
You want to help me,
instead it gets doubled.

1392
01:30:03,055 --> 01:30:04,608
Go and sit.
Go.

1393
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,441
Oh!

1394
01:30:08,135 --> 01:30:09,892
'My dear Balam.'

1395
01:30:09,972 --> 01:30:12,855
Thank you.
'I hope you're fine.'

1396
01:30:13,295 --> 01:30:16,415
'You always write that you'll
come and you don't.'

1397
01:30:16,853 --> 01:30:18,240
'Now one can only see
your signature..'

1398
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,655
'..on the receipt of
the money-order.'

1399
01:30:21,135 --> 01:30:25,815
'Give my greetings to your
friend, Khatpatiya.'

1400
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:26,903
Greeting.

1401
01:30:26,983 --> 01:30:29,639
'Come immediately,
getting the letter.'

1402
01:30:29,913 --> 01:30:31,188
Yes, as if the vehicle is yours.

1403
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,588
'Yours, Bela.'

1404
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:36,215
Boss.
Only letter, no money order?

1405
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:37,778
Khatpatiya.

1406
01:30:37,858 --> 01:30:40,455
It seems the bank of Belapur
has gone bankrupt.

1407
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:42,215
Now a new bank has to be searched.

1408
01:30:42,295 --> 01:30:43,375
Yes, boss.

1409
01:30:44,215 --> 01:30:45,415
Boss, boss.
- What's it?

1410
01:30:45,495 --> 01:30:47,134
Boss, I forgot to mention.

1411
01:30:47,214 --> 01:30:49,457
Sheela has got a big problem
in the village.

1412
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:51,106
It's heard, she's pregnant.

1413
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:54,236
And she says yelling that
she'll avenge you.

1414
01:30:54,316 --> 01:30:58,493
Khatpatiya. It's something like
doing the impossible.

1415
01:30:58,573 --> 01:31:01,743
I don't fear any of
these Sheela, Bela..

1416
01:31:01,975 --> 01:31:03,769
What's the problem of
these Sheela and Bela?

1417
01:31:03,849 --> 01:31:04,493
Boss.

1418
01:31:04,573 --> 01:31:08,088
That's, someone creating
a problem unnecessarily.

1419
01:31:08,168 --> 01:31:11,190
Actually, these Sheela and
Bela are two orphans.

1420
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,697
I help them when I've money.

1421
01:31:13,777 --> 01:31:16,546
And when I can't, they
start defaming me.

1422
01:31:16,626 --> 01:31:18,879
But after all, why do
you go to other woman?

1423
01:31:18,959 --> 01:31:19,870
Vijay.

1424
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,504
I am not a child that you've
come to make me understand.

1425
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:24,215
And then, don't you see
that an outsider is standing..

1426
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:25,509
..you've come in front of him.

1427
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:26,804
Go, light the oven.

1428
01:31:26,884 --> 01:31:27,895
Go I said.

1429
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:39,905
'You too understand that
after marriage..

1430
01:31:39,985 --> 01:31:42,259
..Gauri's your problem and Vijay's mine.'

1431
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:50,103
'Now, your happiness
is in your control.'

1432
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,814
'That doesn't mean I am free
of responsibilities.'

1433
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:55,034
'All my life I'll only
wish that you ask..

1434
01:31:55,206 --> 01:31:57,446
..for something and
I do that for you.'

1435
01:32:01,526 --> 01:32:02,472
Gauri!

1436
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:04,835
What's this you're doing?

1437
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:08,524
I was filling water
for you to bathe.

1438
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:10,246
To hell with my bath.

1439
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,807
If today you'd drowned..

1440
01:32:11,947 --> 01:32:13,455
..the world would've
held me responsible.

1441
01:32:13,535 --> 01:32:14,975
O God!

1442
01:32:15,597 --> 01:32:16,632
Gauri!

1443
01:32:17,755 --> 01:32:20,375
Gauri, these actions of yours
have got me troubled.

1444
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:21,695
What do I do?

1445
01:32:23,055 --> 01:32:25,053
Even death doesn't come.

1446
01:32:25,815 --> 01:32:29,055
You say so as if I've put you in trouble.
- No.

1447
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:32,760
In fact, you've given me all
the happiness of life.

1448
01:32:33,532 --> 01:32:36,400
You've given up your peace,
your rest..

1449
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,569
..everything for me.

1450
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:41,594
Gauri, don't you again
talk of my past life.

1451
01:32:41,674 --> 01:32:42,946
Understood? Go.

1452
01:32:43,026 --> 01:32:44,190
Go and sit inside.

1453
01:32:49,975 --> 01:32:50,968
Boss, Balam.
- Yes.

1454
01:32:51,048 --> 01:32:52,289
Boss, get some tea
if you don't mind.

1455
01:32:52,369 --> 01:32:55,242
Wow! You've already had three cups
still you ask for one?

1456
01:32:55,322 --> 01:32:57,554
Dear, want to make up for you loss?

1457
01:32:57,634 --> 01:32:58,532
Anyways, not a problem.

1458
01:32:58,612 --> 01:33:00,418
Vijay, get a cup of tea.

1459
01:33:00,735 --> 01:33:01,815
Please listen.

1460
01:33:02,024 --> 01:33:03,083
Please come over here.

1461
01:33:03,163 --> 01:33:04,282
O my!

1462
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,621
She's made me stand
while I was winning.

1463
01:33:05,761 --> 01:33:06,560
Come on, play on for my hand.

1464
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,381
Boss, your hand or cards.
- Cards.

1465
01:33:08,461 --> 01:33:10,508
Boss, hits a lot.

1466
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:12,088
What's the matter?

1467
01:33:12,304 --> 01:33:13,732
Where do I get the tea
from so frequently?

1468
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:16,099
There's no milk,
no sugar and nor the tea-leaf.

1469
01:33:16,179 --> 01:33:18,174
And what about the five rupees
that I gave, yesterday?

1470
01:33:18,428 --> 01:33:19,673
What's so big of five rupees?

1471
01:33:19,813 --> 01:33:21,558
Last night,
all your friends had food.

1472
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:22,573
Had breakfast in the morning.

1473
01:33:22,653 --> 01:33:23,982
Have had tea three rounds of tea.

1474
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,195
How long will five rupees last?

1475
01:33:25,275 --> 01:33:28,610
I know you pass on my money
to your uncle. Right?

1476
01:33:28,768 --> 01:33:31,129
My uncle's not of the sort.

1477
01:33:31,209 --> 01:33:32,494
You dare answer to me.

1478
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:33,714
Come on, get in.

1479
01:34:18,197 --> 01:34:19,276
Gauri!

1480
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:22,673
You're troubled and you're
troubling me too.

1481
01:34:23,218 --> 01:34:25,206
Who'd asked you to get my cot here?

1482
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:26,558
It was cold outside
so I thought you..

1483
01:34:26,691 --> 01:34:28,315
..might catch cold.

1484
01:34:28,395 --> 01:34:30,010
I'd have got sick of the
cold at the worst.

1485
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:31,349
I wouldn't have died for sure.

1486
01:34:31,508 --> 01:34:33,284
I am already drenched
in unhappiness.

1487
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:35,347
You think I am living.

1488
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,312
This isn't living,
it's a punishment to live.

1489
01:34:37,978 --> 01:34:39,267
If tonight you died of
the burn, what would..

1490
01:34:39,347 --> 01:34:40,428
..the world have to say?

1491
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,027
Only this that the wife
was blind..

1492
01:34:42,107 --> 01:34:43,926
..so I knowingly let her burn.

1493
01:34:44,085 --> 01:34:46,534
Who can stop the world
from commenting?

1494
01:34:48,027 --> 01:34:52,140
May God, do so that
I get burned and die.

1495
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:56,811
So that at least your life
turned into a happy one.

1496
01:34:58,265 --> 01:35:02,733
Do you think I am not
aware of your distress?

1497
01:35:04,395 --> 01:35:06,686
Last night too, you were
taking her name only..

1498
01:35:07,409 --> 01:35:08,989
..while sleeping.

1499
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:10,241
You've again got back to that?

1500
01:35:10,406 --> 01:35:12,158
You're misunderstanding me.

1501
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:14,707
I didn't mean that.

1502
01:35:14,874 --> 01:35:16,100
Today..

1503
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,547
Whatever I'll be saying
today, shall be true.

1504
01:35:18,627 --> 01:35:20,427
I swear on you.

1505
01:35:21,823 --> 01:35:24,997
You please call sister
Shanti to you.

1506
01:35:25,866 --> 01:35:31,627
And if possible, give me a
corner in this house too.

1507
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:32,811
I..

1508
01:35:32,891 --> 01:35:35,736
I'll serve you both.

1509
01:35:35,888 --> 01:35:38,575
Gauri. Gauri.
For God sake, don't say such things.

1510
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:40,559
Do you know, the one
who you speak about..

1511
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:42,106
..frequently with aversion.

1512
01:35:43,022 --> 01:35:45,850
Actually, the same kind soul
convinced me to marry you.

1513
01:35:46,289 --> 01:35:49,852
She herself turned her life
into a hell for you.

1514
01:35:50,372 --> 01:35:53,532
She got herself sacrificed
to adorn your forehead.

1515
01:35:54,503 --> 01:35:56,055
If you ever again take
that kind soul's name..

1516
01:35:56,135 --> 01:35:58,452
..I am afraid, I'll lose my control.

1517
01:35:59,163 --> 01:36:02,452
Either my hands shall be
at your neck or mine.

1518
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:06,612
Sister-in-law.

1519
01:36:06,932 --> 01:36:07,990
Sister-in-law.

1520
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:09,292
Aunt, Gauri.

1521
01:36:11,612 --> 01:36:12,657
What's the matter, aunt?

1522
01:36:13,692 --> 01:36:15,064
Why do you look sad?

1523
01:36:16,932 --> 01:36:18,191
Aunt!

1524
01:36:19,532 --> 01:36:21,573
What's the matter, aunt?

1525
01:36:21,932 --> 01:36:23,012
Tell me.

1526
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:24,960
What happened?

1527
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:26,772
Don't cry.

1528
01:36:27,155 --> 01:36:28,840
Come.
Come inside.

1529
01:36:30,313 --> 01:36:31,450
Come.

1530
01:36:31,938 --> 01:36:33,092
Shanti.

1531
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:35,350
Daughter, congratulations.

1532
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:37,564
You've also cleared the law exam.

1533
01:36:38,932 --> 01:36:40,692
It's all your blessing, father.

1534
01:36:44,852 --> 01:36:45,932
Shanti.

1535
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:49,656
I am aware of the pain
behind this fake smile.

1536
01:36:51,728 --> 01:36:54,673
But daughter,
you're the joy of this house.

1537
01:36:55,092 --> 01:36:56,739
We live, seeing you.

1538
01:36:57,532 --> 01:36:59,116
Tell me, what have you
decided about yourself?

1539
01:37:01,372 --> 01:37:02,452
Daughter.

1540
01:37:02,772 --> 01:37:05,346
Let bygones be bygones.

1541
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:07,509
Now, think of the coming tomorrow.

1542
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,012
Father.

1543
01:37:09,332 --> 01:37:12,012
I've only decided this
that I'll practise.

1544
01:37:13,696 --> 01:37:15,032
And shall become a successful..

1545
01:37:15,112 --> 01:37:16,688
..lawyer with your blessing,
getting your..

1546
01:37:17,197 --> 01:37:18,708
..name to a greater height.

1547
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:20,160
You've only thought this?

1548
01:37:20,932 --> 01:37:22,887
You can practice after marriage too.

1549
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,131
Father, I am very disturbed for now.

1550
01:37:25,369 --> 01:37:26,583
Don't force me for marriage, please.

1551
01:37:26,663 --> 01:37:28,335
All right, as you wish.

1552
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:30,346
There's no hurry, think at leisure.

1553
01:37:31,692 --> 01:37:32,640
Oh yes! I just forgot.

1554
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,706
There's a letter for you.

1555
01:37:50,737 --> 01:37:52,204
Yours Vijay.

1556
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:54,448
Vijay?

1557
01:37:55,652 --> 01:37:57,342
'My good sister, Shanti.'

1558
01:37:58,028 --> 01:38:00,344
'You'll surely be surprised
getting this letter.'

1559
01:38:01,142 --> 01:38:02,558
'That, how did Vijay
got to remember you..

1560
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,959
..after this big gap?'

1561
01:38:04,852 --> 01:38:05,932
'Sister.'

1562
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,116
'Perhaps,
I was born for this only that..

1563
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:14,852
'..I get you, uncle and
aunt Gauri to suffer.'

1564
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,772
'Uncle did sacrifice his happiness..

1565
01:38:17,852 --> 01:38:19,209
'..for the sake of mine.'

1566
01:38:20,017 --> 01:38:22,612
'And in the process,
three homes got ablaze.'

1567
01:38:23,204 --> 01:38:28,155
'Now I am sure that the life of
aunt Gauri rests with you.'

1568
01:38:30,987 --> 01:38:34,877
'Aunt Gauri, says to the
extent that if you..'

1569
01:38:34,957 --> 01:38:38,726
'..marry uncle right now, then
aunt Gauri shall get peace.'

1570
01:38:38,964 --> 01:38:41,219
'I leave the decision
to you on this.'

1571
01:38:41,612 --> 01:38:44,570
'As a stupid girl like
me can't qualify to..'

1572
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:46,852
'..make you understand.'

1573
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:57,122
Who's that?

1574
01:38:59,489 --> 01:39:00,607
Greeting.

1575
01:39:00,972 --> 01:39:01,982
Greeting.

1576
01:39:02,363 --> 01:39:04,531
Where's Mr. Raj?

1577
01:39:05,029 --> 01:39:06,775
He's gone to office.

1578
01:39:07,126 --> 01:39:08,684
Which office he works in?

1579
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:11,010
He's a clerk in the court.

1580
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:14,904
Clerk in the court!

1581
01:39:15,178 --> 01:39:16,452
Yes.

1582
01:39:17,087 --> 01:39:18,208
Who are you?

1583
01:39:18,355 --> 01:39:19,791
Actually..

1584
01:39:20,225 --> 01:39:23,802
When he used to study in the city,
he was our tenant.

1585
01:39:24,117 --> 01:39:28,112
Not only a tenant, but like
a member of our family.

1586
01:39:28,192 --> 01:39:29,005
I see.

1587
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:33,012
My parents take him as their child.

1588
01:39:33,954 --> 01:39:36,578
It's my luck that you've come.

1589
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,975
Please come.

1590
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,840
First, have a seat.

1591
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:41,452
Oh!

1592
01:39:41,532 --> 01:39:42,743
I'll do it.

1593
01:39:44,343 --> 01:39:46,091
Sit sister.
- You..

1594
01:39:46,275 --> 01:39:49,797
You've come at such a time
that he's not at home.

1595
01:39:50,096 --> 01:39:51,613
And I..

1596
01:39:51,693 --> 01:39:53,143
Take me as your sister.

1597
01:39:54,012 --> 01:39:56,127
Don't you've any help?

1598
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:59,059
Sister, the unlucky
ones don't have one.

1599
01:39:59,674 --> 01:40:01,465
They themselves are one.

1600
01:40:01,617 --> 01:40:02,943
Why do you say so?

1601
01:40:03,394 --> 01:40:05,253
Who else is lucky the
than the one who's..

1602
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,741
.. got a God like husband.

1603
01:40:07,874 --> 01:40:09,379
There's no doubt to that, sister.

1604
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:12,219
My husband is actually a God.

1605
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:15,539
But is very sad.

1606
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:19,769
And I am the only reason
for all his sufferings.

1607
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:23,489
May, God bestow death upon me.
- Sister!

1608
01:40:23,779 --> 01:40:25,784
Then perhaps, he may get peace.

1609
01:40:28,486 --> 01:40:30,059
Sister, why do you say so?

1610
01:40:30,987 --> 01:40:33,459
Peace is something,
which is in one's mind.

1611
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,597
Doesn't he love you?

1612
01:40:36,802 --> 01:40:39,155
He's heart is full of love.

1613
01:40:40,032 --> 01:40:42,488
But, that love can't reach me.

1614
01:40:43,218 --> 01:40:45,364
Nor am I the rightful one, either.

1615
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:49,102
He's done so much for
a blind like me.

1616
01:40:49,616 --> 01:40:51,818
This favour of his is
in itself so huge.

1617
01:40:52,389 --> 01:40:54,338
He's very great, sister.

1618
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:57,752
He doesn't say anything
but he keeps naming..

1619
01:40:57,832 --> 01:40:59,784
..somebody while sleeping.

1620
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,580
He says, Shanti, please forgive me.

1621
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,922
I've done injustice to you.

1622
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:12,319
Now, you only tell sister,
when his Shanti..

1623
01:41:12,947 --> 01:41:15,979
..is somewhere else then how
can I get peace living.

1624
01:41:16,816 --> 01:41:20,056
And my peace is only in death.

1625
01:41:20,323 --> 01:41:21,216
Sister.

1626
01:41:22,024 --> 01:41:24,216
It's the cowards who take to death.

1627
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,976
If there's a pain in
one part of the body.

1628
01:41:28,656 --> 01:41:30,736
That doesn't mean one
should chop it off.

1629
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:35,216
Come along.

1630
01:41:35,903 --> 01:41:36,736
Come, sister.

1631
01:41:51,656 --> 01:41:54,816
Do you know sister,
how do you look now?

1632
01:41:55,736 --> 01:41:56,736
How do I look?

1633
01:41:57,296 --> 01:42:01,056
Like the first ray
of the sun at dawn.

1634
01:42:02,035 --> 01:42:03,296
Perhaps, he's coming.

1635
01:42:03,656 --> 01:42:06,376
Look, don't tell him
that I've come here.

1636
01:42:06,456 --> 01:42:07,576
Ok?

1637
01:42:21,894 --> 01:42:24,976
You.. Why are you silent?

1638
01:42:26,154 --> 01:42:27,736
I've come from office, tired.

1639
01:42:27,816 --> 01:42:29,296
And then, what's there
to talk after all.

1640
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,696
You didn't see me properly.

1641
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:33,473
I did. I did see nicely.

1642
01:42:34,216 --> 01:42:36,310
Did I ever say that
you're not beautiful?

1643
01:42:36,656 --> 01:42:38,855
Then what's the use of this make-up?

1644
01:42:38,935 --> 01:42:40,576
Even a corpse is cover
with shroud and..

1645
01:42:40,656 --> 01:42:42,719
..flowers placed on it.

1646
01:42:43,892 --> 01:42:46,431
Then, can't I adorn
myself when alive?

1647
01:42:46,511 --> 01:42:47,816
One gets beautified
when there's a need..

1648
01:42:47,896 --> 01:42:49,009
..to win someone's heart.

1649
01:42:49,089 --> 01:42:50,360
One has to allure somebody.

1650
01:42:50,519 --> 01:42:52,804
The situation over here is,
the target has himself become a victim.

1651
01:42:52,937 --> 01:42:55,035
For God sake..
- Enough.

1652
01:42:55,296 --> 01:42:57,798
Whatever, I've done
till now is for God.

1653
01:42:57,878 --> 01:42:59,310
Have done for the world
for some other people.

1654
01:42:59,656 --> 01:43:01,230
But what has this world done for me?

1655
01:43:01,401 --> 01:43:04,305
"Stop a little."

1656
01:43:06,442 --> 01:43:08,869
"Stop a little."

1657
01:43:09,378 --> 01:43:16,399
"Let me explain you, what life is?"

1658
01:43:16,847 --> 01:43:21,367
"The one that you couldn't
find till today.."

1659
01:43:21,857 --> 01:43:27,555
"..to you, what's that joy."

1660
01:43:30,727 --> 01:43:34,839
"To break somebody's heart."

1661
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:39,239
"This is not life."

1662
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:43,319
"To break somebody's heart."

1663
01:43:43,573 --> 01:43:47,319
"This is not life."

1664
01:43:47,777 --> 01:43:51,737
"Taking the pain of others."

1665
01:43:51,999 --> 01:43:55,560
"Is it not happiness?"

1666
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:05,122
"Walk in a manner as if.."

1667
01:44:05,274 --> 01:44:09,133
"..these winds blow."

1668
01:44:09,437 --> 01:44:13,519
"Walk in a manner as if.."

1669
01:44:13,599 --> 01:44:16,919
"..these winds blow."

1670
01:44:17,658 --> 01:44:21,556
"They blossom the flowers."

1671
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:24,759
"They make the gardens laugh."

1672
01:44:25,239 --> 01:44:29,239
"The one who lives for himself."

1673
01:44:29,437 --> 01:44:33,392
"He's not a man."

1674
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:37,519
"To break somebody's heart."

1675
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:41,337
"This is not life."

1676
01:44:46,759 --> 01:44:50,897
"The one who's got gloom."

1677
01:44:51,217 --> 01:44:55,045
"Give smile to those lips."

1678
01:44:55,319 --> 01:44:59,321
"The one who's got gloom."

1679
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:02,581
"Give smile to those lips."

1680
01:45:02,839 --> 01:45:07,450
"By giving your peace."

1681
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,839
"Take a bud in return."

1682
01:45:11,239 --> 01:45:15,079
"Your heart is one treasure."

1683
01:45:15,365 --> 01:45:19,402
"There's no dearth of
anything to you."

1684
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,475
"To break somebody's heart."

1685
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:27,154
"This is not life."

1686
01:45:32,722 --> 01:45:36,596
"Whether, it's a moon
or blazing fire."

1687
01:45:36,839 --> 01:45:40,506
"One should see the light in both."

1688
01:45:40,795 --> 01:45:44,988
"But whichever, one saw."

1689
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:48,138
"One saw away from the blazing fire."

1690
01:45:48,368 --> 01:45:52,501
"The one who, blows away someone."

1691
01:45:52,659 --> 01:45:56,809
"It's not a light."

1692
01:45:56,889 --> 01:46:00,872
"To break somebody's heart."

1693
01:46:01,047 --> 01:46:04,846
"This is not life."

1694
01:46:05,236 --> 01:46:09,204
"Taking the pain of others."

1695
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:16,614
"Is it not happiness?"

1696
01:46:17,003 --> 01:46:18,146
Gauri!

1697
01:46:18,528 --> 01:46:19,344
Gauri!

1698
01:46:19,574 --> 01:46:21,025
Please forgive me, Gauri.

1699
01:46:21,185 --> 01:46:23,451
For God sake, please don't say so.
- No, Gauri.

1700
01:46:25,173 --> 01:46:26,588
Please.
- No.

1701
01:46:27,124 --> 01:46:29,194
Gauri.

1702
01:46:29,493 --> 01:46:31,172
Gauri, please forgive me.

1703
01:46:46,986 --> 01:46:48,109
Tea.

1704
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:50,085
It was only for tea.

1705
01:46:50,296 --> 01:46:51,051
Why?

1706
01:46:51,131 --> 01:46:52,517
Have I done something remarkable?

1707
01:46:52,757 --> 01:46:54,357
What else you could do?

1708
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:58,597
I used to think, Gauri and
I are the banks of a river.

1709
01:46:58,677 --> 01:47:00,357
Which can never, meet.

1710
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,157
But, you've got them together.

1711
01:47:02,237 --> 01:47:04,180
That's enough.
Now, stop your praises.

1712
01:47:04,386 --> 01:47:06,433
You've not thought till today..

1713
01:47:06,513 --> 01:47:09,091
..that who'll look after the house after
you leave for the office.

1714
01:47:09,437 --> 01:47:11,917
You could've at least hired
a help for sister, Gauri.

1715
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,597
How could I think of it?

1716
01:47:13,968 --> 01:47:15,757
I wasn't a human till today.

1717
01:47:16,437 --> 01:47:18,757
You've awakened my
sleeping humanism.

1718
01:47:19,437 --> 01:47:23,081
I was a lost traveller
who you got on track.

1719
01:47:23,237 --> 01:47:25,077
Let bygones be bygones.

1720
01:47:25,437 --> 01:47:26,839
By forgetting it..

1721
01:47:27,155 --> 01:47:29,597
.. make this small world of
yours a heaven.

1722
01:47:29,677 --> 01:47:31,514
You've already made it a heaven.

1723
01:47:31,644 --> 01:47:33,357
We've just got to take
care of this heaven.

1724
01:47:34,597 --> 01:47:38,428
I don't know how I will return
this favour of yours, Shanti.

1725
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,517
Shanti!

1726
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,480
Is it you..

1727
01:47:47,659 --> 01:47:48,846
Yes, sister.

1728
01:47:49,677 --> 01:47:53,437
The same Shanti for which..
- No.

1729
01:47:53,517 --> 01:47:54,958
No, sister.

1730
01:47:55,513 --> 01:47:59,728
You're something more than
Sun and Moon, for me.

1731
01:48:00,437 --> 01:48:02,282
You've given me the sight.

1732
01:48:02,437 --> 01:48:04,157
You've got the lamp
of my heart, lighted.

1733
01:48:05,592 --> 01:48:06,757
Sister.

1734
01:48:07,437 --> 01:48:13,559
If you've done so many favours,
please do one more.

1735
01:48:14,646 --> 01:48:16,753
Please, let me touch your feet.
- Sister.

1736
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:18,357
On the arrival of whose
this house has..

1737
01:48:18,437 --> 01:48:19,891
..turned into a heaven.

1738
01:48:19,971 --> 01:48:21,124
Sister.

1739
01:48:21,204 --> 01:48:22,876
You're great, sister.

1740
01:48:23,577 --> 01:48:24,688
Sister, you're great.

1741
01:48:24,768 --> 01:48:27,035
Since I've become a pauper,
even friends..

1742
01:48:27,115 --> 01:48:28,635
..have stopped coming.

1743
01:48:28,715 --> 01:48:30,635
Play on credit, I am an honest man.

1744
01:48:30,715 --> 01:48:31,854
What's it, come on show.

1745
01:48:31,934 --> 01:48:33,795
Boss. Boss.
- Yes. Boss, newspaper.

1746
01:48:34,114 --> 01:48:34,864
Did you steal it?

1747
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,155
It's not so, boss. Boss,
read it first.

1748
01:48:36,235 --> 01:48:37,415
Sheela has committed a suicide.

1749
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:43,460
A girl named Sheela,
who was pregnant before marriage..

1750
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:47,745
..has committed suicide
by jumping into the well.

1751
01:48:48,155 --> 01:48:49,235
O God!

1752
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:54,649
By her letter it was known
that her lover had..

1753
01:48:54,729 --> 01:48:57,075
..married some other girl.

1754
01:48:57,475 --> 01:49:02,769
But, she didn't write the name
and address in the letter.

1755
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:04,858
Khatpatiya.

1756
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,995
She was good at heart, poor.

1757
01:49:07,075 --> 01:49:09,474
Or else, I was to be hanged today.

1758
01:49:09,771 --> 01:49:12,715
May, God rest her soul in peace.

1759
01:49:12,902 --> 01:49:14,583
You've got the yesterday's paper.

1760
01:49:14,663 --> 01:49:15,679
It's hard earned money.

1761
01:49:15,759 --> 01:49:18,008
Go and return it.
Go at once, you thief.

1762
01:49:18,122 --> 01:49:20,385
Are the killers better than
the thieves and dacoits?

1763
01:49:20,465 --> 01:49:21,995
Killer, which killer?

1764
01:49:22,075 --> 01:49:24,588
You.
Did you not kill that innocent girl?

1765
01:49:24,668 --> 01:49:26,421
What rubbish you speak! Whose?
- That of Sheela.

1766
01:49:26,501 --> 01:49:28,269
Sheela! Which Sheela?

1767
01:49:28,349 --> 01:49:31,235
The same orphan girl who
you used to help with.

1768
01:49:31,438 --> 01:49:33,376
Today it's Sheela who's died of you.

1769
01:49:34,052 --> 01:49:37,250
After that who knows, how many
innocent girls shall follow the same.

1770
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:40,017
Who will fall a prey to your lust.

1771
01:49:40,277 --> 01:49:42,367
You've become very daring.

1772
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:43,968
If you ever try to get
into my issues, I'll..

1773
01:49:44,048 --> 01:49:45,104
..not spare you.
Did you get it?

1774
01:49:45,184 --> 01:49:46,490
As if I am living now.

1775
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:50,044
I'd died the same day
when I caught on to..

1776
01:49:50,124 --> 01:49:52,167
..you even after uncle tried
to make me understand.

1777
01:49:52,471 --> 01:49:55,680
I warn you if you ever
do so like this ever.

1778
01:50:21,635 --> 01:50:23,052
"Meow! Meow!"

1779
01:50:24,018 --> 01:50:26,408
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1780
01:50:26,488 --> 01:50:28,728
"So nice, my friend."

1781
01:50:28,808 --> 01:50:31,088
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1782
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,568
"So nice, my friend."

1783
01:50:33,648 --> 01:50:38,325
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1784
01:50:38,405 --> 01:50:43,027
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1785
01:50:43,107 --> 01:50:45,424
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1786
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,964
"So nice, my friend."

1787
01:51:04,387 --> 01:51:06,747
"I've recognised his heart."

1788
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:09,140
"It's full of love."

1789
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:11,603
"That the eyes don't move away from."

1790
01:51:11,683 --> 01:51:14,279
"Is the eye like that?"

1791
01:51:16,256 --> 01:51:18,332
"I've recognised his heart."

1792
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,067
"It's full of love."

1793
01:51:21,147 --> 01:51:23,289
"That the eyes don't move away from."

1794
01:51:23,473 --> 01:51:25,708
"Is the eye like that?"

1795
01:51:25,961 --> 01:51:28,227
"How does he walk, tell me."

1796
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,290
"It must be like a river."

1797
01:51:30,715 --> 01:51:32,747
"How does he walk, tell me."

1798
01:51:32,827 --> 01:51:34,908
"It must be like a river."

1799
01:51:35,056 --> 01:51:39,539
"The lips must be like
the petals of rose."

1800
01:51:39,666 --> 01:51:41,227
"Meow! Meow!"

1801
01:51:42,032 --> 01:51:44,341
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1802
01:51:44,421 --> 01:51:46,718
"So nice, my friend."

1803
01:51:46,798 --> 01:51:51,313
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1804
01:51:51,393 --> 01:51:56,023
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1805
01:51:56,103 --> 01:51:58,257
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1806
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,888
"So nice, my friend."

1807
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:22,303
"Seeing him I wonder
if the Moon does envy."

1808
01:52:22,383 --> 01:52:27,067
"Standing in his courtyard,
I hope it doesn't get hyper."

1809
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:34,119
"Seeing him I wonder
if the Moon does envy."

1810
01:52:34,199 --> 01:52:38,830
"Standing in his courtyard,
I hope it doesn't get hyper."

1811
01:52:38,987 --> 01:52:43,557
"Does the wind happen to touch
his hair, everyday?"

1812
01:52:43,719 --> 01:52:47,852
"Does the wind happen to touch
his hair, everyday?"

1813
01:52:47,932 --> 01:52:52,615
"I've come to know as to
why I am full of aroma."

1814
01:52:52,695 --> 01:52:54,143
"Meow! Meow!"

1815
01:52:55,027 --> 01:52:57,312
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1816
01:52:57,392 --> 01:52:59,607
"So nice, my friend."

1817
01:52:59,795 --> 01:53:04,462
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1818
01:53:04,542 --> 01:53:09,150
"Tell me, how my beloved looks like."

1819
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:11,380
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1820
01:53:11,542 --> 01:53:13,756
"So nice, my friend."

1821
01:53:13,836 --> 01:53:16,091
"Meow! Meow! My friend."

1822
01:53:16,171 --> 01:53:19,105
"So nice, my friend."

1823
01:53:19,734 --> 01:53:20,930
Oh!

1824
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:22,570
Sister, Shanti!

1825
01:53:22,737 --> 01:53:24,210
You look very happy today?

1826
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:25,875
I won't speak to you, sister.

1827
01:53:25,955 --> 01:53:27,027
Why?

1828
01:53:27,479 --> 01:53:29,223
You did forget me the
moment you went away.

1829
01:53:29,423 --> 01:53:30,783
Do you have any idea
of the difficulty I..

1830
01:53:30,863 --> 01:53:32,413
..faced getting the neighbour
write the letter?

1831
01:53:32,493 --> 01:53:33,743
Let your anger calm, now.

1832
01:53:34,053 --> 01:53:35,017
Oh yes!

1833
01:53:35,097 --> 01:53:37,790
You'd written that
you'll give me good news.

1834
01:53:38,743 --> 01:53:39,711
What's that?

1835
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:40,983
Sister.

1836
01:53:41,423 --> 01:53:43,663
You won't let me know?
You really won't?

1837
01:53:43,743 --> 01:53:44,912
No. Wait. Now, speak.

1838
01:53:46,666 --> 01:53:48,223
Speak up! Speak up!

1839
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,971
I see!

1840
01:53:52,051 --> 01:53:55,719
So this house is going
to get a new member.

1841
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:58,150
Boss.

1842
01:53:58,303 --> 01:53:59,441
Master.

1843
01:53:59,521 --> 01:54:00,857
Boss.
- What's it?

1844
01:54:00,937 --> 01:54:02,126
Oh!

1845
01:54:02,206 --> 01:54:03,289
I wanted to meet, boss.

1846
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:04,319
He's not at home.

1847
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:05,990
And don't you ever try to meet him.

1848
01:54:06,529 --> 01:54:08,433
I know it's you who's
got him spoiled.

1849
01:54:08,513 --> 01:54:10,033
Me?

1850
01:54:10,113 --> 01:54:12,139
No one can get a nuisance
spoiled further.

1851
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:14,391
I am only the caretaker of boss.

1852
01:54:14,625 --> 01:54:17,939
Sister-in-law, if it wasn't
for me the police..

1853
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:21,014
..could've arrested him long before.

1854
01:54:21,094 --> 01:54:22,856
Don't talk rubbish!
What sin has he committed?

1855
01:54:24,008 --> 01:54:29,059
The first sin he committed
was to take the birth.

1856
01:54:29,469 --> 01:54:33,504
The second sin is he got grown up.

1857
01:54:33,872 --> 01:54:37,820
And the third one is,
he's still alive.

1858
01:54:38,059 --> 01:54:39,079
Yes, it is.

1859
01:54:40,071 --> 01:54:40,987
Who's it?

1860
01:54:41,236 --> 01:54:42,435
Oh master!

1861
01:54:42,515 --> 01:54:43,540
What are you doing here?

1862
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:46,939
Boss, I was singing your
praises to sister-in-law.

1863
01:54:47,019 --> 01:54:48,219
Ask her. Ask her.
- It's a lie.

1864
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:49,270
He was speaking ill of you.

1865
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:50,648
And you were hearing
all that standing.

1866
01:54:50,728 --> 01:54:52,139
Right? Go away from here.
Come on, go.

1867
01:54:53,417 --> 01:54:54,498
Why you..
- No boss.

1868
01:54:54,578 --> 01:54:56,084
You were speaking ill about me?
- No boss.

1869
01:54:56,164 --> 01:54:57,292
You dare so.

1870
01:54:57,419 --> 01:54:58,926
Take this.
Get lost.

1871
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,362
Boss.

1872
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,099
Don't forget, you've hit me today.

1873
01:55:05,264 --> 01:55:08,339
But you too are in my control.

1874
01:55:08,499 --> 01:55:12,305
If I let out the secret
then you'll be finished.

1875
01:55:12,385 --> 01:55:13,854
So it's you who'll get out the secret.

1876
01:55:13,934 --> 01:55:14,851
Get lost from here.

1877
01:55:17,636 --> 01:55:18,899
Boss.

1878
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:22,099
You must've come across
cowards till today.

1879
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:25,699
Note it down, my name's Khatpatiya.

1880
01:55:25,845 --> 01:55:28,028
Start counting your days from today.

1881
01:55:28,219 --> 01:55:28,852
Yes.

1882
01:55:53,169 --> 01:56:01,528
"Beloved, I'll get you seated
on the eye-lids and.."

1883
01:56:01,769 --> 01:56:09,499
"..I shall show you the world's
beautiful creations."

1884
01:56:10,091 --> 01:56:13,823
"This earth, the mountain."

1885
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:17,819
"The vagrant cloud."

1886
01:56:18,147 --> 01:56:26,773
"The gestures of these cooler
than flowers, breeze."

1887
01:56:30,695 --> 01:56:35,939
"Tearing apart the heart
of the cliffs."

1888
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:42,754
"I wonder who of great hardship.."

1889
01:56:43,052 --> 01:56:47,146
"..has made these statues."

1890
01:56:47,286 --> 01:56:50,972
"This elephant of stone."

1891
01:56:51,162 --> 01:56:54,983
"This priest and temple."

1892
01:56:55,142 --> 01:57:04,345
"These many ages old relics."

1893
01:57:45,156 --> 01:57:46,178
Oh you!

1894
01:57:46,258 --> 01:57:48,222
Beloved, what have you
done to yourself?

1895
01:57:48,302 --> 01:57:50,596
I know you must have got
burn out by missing me.

1896
01:57:50,676 --> 01:57:51,739
I was coming to you only.

1897
01:57:51,819 --> 01:57:54,200
Come, come.
- Yes, I was coming to you.

1898
01:57:54,446 --> 01:57:56,120
Today, all the decisions
should be done.

1899
01:57:56,295 --> 01:57:58,486
The decision of love is not
done in these by lanes.

1900
01:57:58,566 --> 01:57:59,710
Come, come. Let's go to our spot.

1901
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:01,499
Come. Come on. Come.

1902
01:58:01,579 --> 01:58:04,262
Hurry up! Hurry up! Move.

1903
01:58:09,269 --> 01:58:10,062
Eat.

1904
01:58:12,499 --> 01:58:13,579
What's it?

1905
01:58:20,384 --> 01:58:21,488
Come.

1906
01:58:23,127 --> 01:58:25,262
Don't you think this place
is worth of loving?

1907
01:58:25,539 --> 01:58:26,870
Now tell my love,
what do you want to say?

1908
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:28,175
When will we get married?

1909
01:58:28,255 --> 01:58:29,455
It'll happen very soon.

1910
01:58:29,535 --> 01:58:30,455
When?

1911
01:58:30,535 --> 01:58:33,217
Let my troubles be over, after that.

1912
01:58:33,654 --> 01:58:35,293
Will the government grant permission
for second marriage?

1913
01:58:35,373 --> 01:58:36,862
What? Second marriage?

1914
01:58:36,942 --> 01:58:38,349
You mean you are married?

1915
01:58:38,562 --> 01:58:39,837
Not me, yours.

1916
01:58:40,069 --> 01:58:41,105
Is Vijay not your wife?

1917
01:58:41,185 --> 01:58:42,415
Who's Vijay?

1918
01:58:42,495 --> 01:58:44,029
Who told you?
- Your follower.

1919
01:58:44,357 --> 01:58:47,997
So this is Khatpatiya's deed.

1920
01:58:48,157 --> 01:58:51,197
When you knew that I am married.
What made you come here?

1921
01:58:51,277 --> 01:58:53,077
I've come to ask for justice
in front of everybody.

1922
01:58:53,157 --> 01:58:55,230
Is it? So, you've come to announce.

1923
01:58:55,641 --> 01:58:58,093
Bela, don't forget that
you're a woman.

1924
01:58:58,173 --> 01:58:59,896
There will be no harm to me.
It'll be you who'll get defamed.

1925
01:58:59,976 --> 01:59:00,875
I see.

1926
01:59:00,955 --> 01:59:02,886
So, you kept befooling me.

1927
01:59:03,094 --> 01:59:05,236
Is it for today that I kept
sending you money..

1928
01:59:05,316 --> 01:59:06,480
..selling my house, jewellery?

1929
01:59:06,668 --> 01:59:09,166
If you kept sending money,
I too kept sending the receipt.

1930
01:59:09,246 --> 01:59:10,791
It's so fair.
- Oh!

1931
01:59:11,025 --> 01:59:12,832
So, your love was an excuse.

1932
01:59:13,274 --> 01:59:15,357
You were after me to destroy.

1933
01:59:15,549 --> 01:59:16,824
I too shall not be mute.

1934
01:59:16,904 --> 01:59:18,200
I'll get all the people collected.

1935
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:19,814
What harm will you do to me?

1936
01:59:19,894 --> 01:59:21,058
What's the proof that you have?

1937
01:59:21,138 --> 01:59:21,938
Proof!
- Yes.

1938
01:59:22,018 --> 01:59:23,117
Your letters.

1939
01:59:23,197 --> 01:59:24,704
You love letters.
- Ok.

1940
01:59:24,784 --> 01:59:26,983
The fake promises hand
written by you.

1941
01:59:27,063 --> 01:59:28,639
See this.

1942
01:59:28,836 --> 01:59:31,319
So, you think you can
drag me to the court?

1943
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:33,035
Why the court, the decision
shall be done here itself.

1944
01:59:33,115 --> 01:59:34,045
What decision?

1945
01:59:34,213 --> 01:59:36,152
The same which you
always used to say.

1946
01:59:36,330 --> 01:59:39,117
That in life we'll be together,
whether we live or die.

1947
01:59:39,356 --> 01:59:41,662
The first one holds true,
the second one is a lie.

1948
01:59:41,742 --> 01:59:42,926
If you want to die, die alone.

1949
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:45,117
I don't know to backtrack
on my promise.

1950
01:59:45,373 --> 01:59:47,994
I won't die alone,
I'll take you along too.

1951
01:59:48,451 --> 01:59:50,396
Even if I am supposed to kill you.

1952
01:59:51,071 --> 01:59:52,557
You dare so?

1953
01:59:52,772 --> 01:59:55,342
You think you can kill me.

1954
01:59:55,422 --> 01:59:56,987
Help!
- Help.

1955
01:59:57,067 --> 01:59:58,099
Help!
- Nobody will.

1956
01:59:58,179 --> 01:59:58,876
Gauri, I'll just be returning.

1957
01:59:58,956 --> 02:00:00,070
Help!
- Where'll you go?

1958
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:00,954
Listen to me.

1959
02:00:01,034 --> 02:00:02,841
Help!
- Help.

1960
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:04,649
Help!
- Nobody will.

1961
02:00:04,729 --> 02:00:07,138
Help! Help!

1962
02:00:20,696 --> 02:00:21,803
Balam, what happened?

1963
02:00:21,883 --> 02:00:23,052
Nothing. Let me go.
- What's the matter?

1964
02:00:23,132 --> 02:00:24,306
Let me.
- Balam.

1965
02:00:29,911 --> 02:00:31,014
Who's it?

1966
02:00:39,343 --> 02:00:40,317
Uncle.
- Yes.

1967
02:00:59,854 --> 02:01:00,797
No, no.

1968
02:01:01,236 --> 02:01:02,531
I'll not let that happen.

1969
02:01:02,811 --> 02:01:04,902
I'll never let Vijay's life destroyed.

1970
02:01:07,237 --> 02:01:08,137
Uncle!

1971
02:01:08,217 --> 02:01:10,168
Murderer!

1972
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:13,637
Murderer!

1973
02:01:13,807 --> 02:01:15,594
What happened?
- Shanti's mother, it's shocking.

1974
02:01:15,674 --> 02:01:17,478
Raj has murdered a girl in his village.

1975
02:01:17,558 --> 02:01:18,784
Our Raj.
- Yes. Look at this.

1976
02:01:18,864 --> 02:01:20,144
His picture is printed with name.

1977
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:21,462
This is impossible.
- Look.

1978
02:01:21,784 --> 02:01:23,159
He's in 'City Jail'.
I'll go and see him.

1979
02:01:23,239 --> 02:01:24,304
Yes, you please go.
- Father.

1980
02:01:24,544 --> 02:01:25,624
I'll come along too.
- All right.

1981
02:01:25,704 --> 02:01:26,784
Let me change.

1982
02:01:28,421 --> 02:01:30,804
Raj, what's this you've done?

1983
02:01:30,884 --> 02:01:32,058
What have you done my boy?

1984
02:01:33,597 --> 02:01:35,227
Mr. Chowdhary, I've murdered.

1985
02:01:35,446 --> 02:01:36,984
I can never believe this.

1986
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:39,384
That you can murder someone.

1987
02:01:39,631 --> 02:01:40,544
Shanti.

1988
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,024
There are many things in
life which are strange.

1989
02:01:43,534 --> 02:01:44,744
But they happen.

1990
02:01:45,729 --> 02:01:46,836
Mr. Chowdhary.

1991
02:01:47,653 --> 02:01:49,464
Did you ever think of it that..

1992
02:01:49,919 --> 02:01:54,472
..I'll trample all your happiness and
get separated from you and family?

1993
02:01:54,552 --> 02:01:55,847
There was a reason to it, Raj.

1994
02:01:55,927 --> 02:01:57,498
Your promise, your duty.

1995
02:01:57,748 --> 02:02:00,138
But a murder can't be committed on
somebody's whims and fancy.

1996
02:02:00,218 --> 02:02:01,970
There's a reason to everything.

1997
02:02:02,107 --> 02:02:04,041
But one can't argue on every issue.

1998
02:02:04,392 --> 02:02:05,632
Nor shall I argue.

1999
02:02:05,712 --> 02:02:07,592
Raj.
- Mr. Chowdhary.

2000
02:02:08,537 --> 02:02:10,352
You please leave me on my own.

2001
02:02:10,556 --> 02:02:11,712
Raj, don't lose courage.

2002
02:02:11,792 --> 02:02:13,392
Tell me everything clearly.

2003
02:02:13,767 --> 02:02:16,112
I'll resign the government
job and fight your case.

2004
02:02:16,478 --> 02:02:18,141
There's no hope of I getting freed.

2005
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:20,112
The police caught me
committing the crime.

2006
02:02:20,274 --> 02:02:21,265
Not a problem, Raj.

2007
02:02:21,345 --> 02:02:22,483
I've a request.

2008
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:25,221
Yes, please tell.
I am ready to do everything for you.

2009
02:02:25,301 --> 02:02:26,364
Please tell, Mr. Raj.

2010
02:02:27,322 --> 02:02:30,984
After me, please care
for Vijay and Gauri.

2011
02:02:31,064 --> 02:02:32,392
That's ok Raj, but..

2012
02:02:32,621 --> 02:02:33,693
Raj, at least listen to me.

2013
02:02:33,992 --> 02:02:35,364
Raj.
- Mr. Raj.

2014
02:02:35,444 --> 02:02:36,722
Raj..

2015
02:02:37,528 --> 02:02:39,112
Father, what has happened to him?

2016
02:02:39,249 --> 02:02:40,715
He's completely changed.

2017
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:43,792
Yes, he's hiding from us too.

2018
02:02:45,164 --> 02:02:46,110
Come, daughter.

2019
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:48,519
Brother.

2020
02:02:49,018 --> 02:02:51,879
Why are you quiet?
Say something, at least.

2021
02:02:52,494 --> 02:02:54,152
I should be mute.

2022
02:02:54,703 --> 02:02:58,441
Brother, who else can save him,
barring you.

2023
02:02:58,873 --> 02:03:00,098
What can I do now?

2024
02:03:00,178 --> 02:03:02,135
He murdered and got caught.

2025
02:03:02,215 --> 02:03:04,273
It's not so. He's innocent.

2026
02:03:04,353 --> 02:03:06,336
He's wrongly implicated.

2027
02:03:06,603 --> 02:03:09,071
Do the police ever catch
somebody not guilty?

2028
02:03:09,151 --> 02:03:11,185
Why would he have to murder anyone?

2029
02:03:11,265 --> 02:03:14,512
Why don't you please go?
Somehow, get uncle here.

2030
02:03:14,592 --> 02:03:15,786
Now, how do I do that?

2031
02:03:16,035 --> 02:03:19,493
If he'd consulted me before killing..

2032
02:03:19,573 --> 02:03:23,871
..I'd have given him a full proof plan.

2033
02:03:24,124 --> 02:03:27,712
But the stupid kept sitting
there after murdering.

2034
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:29,654
Brother, do anything.

2035
02:03:29,734 --> 02:03:31,923
Please save him for God's sake.

2036
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,488
When did I want that my
sister becomes a widow?

2037
02:03:35,028 --> 02:03:38,859
The maximum I can do is,
I use my name..

2038
02:03:38,939 --> 02:03:43,036
..and influence, hire
a lawyer and get him..

2039
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:46,433
..life imprisonment
instead of execution.

2040
02:03:46,513 --> 02:03:47,615
Brother.

2041
02:03:48,103 --> 02:03:49,992
Can we not do any other thing?

2042
02:03:50,072 --> 02:03:51,497
Is this something, less?

2043
02:03:52,201 --> 02:03:53,344
Anyway.

2044
02:03:57,511 --> 02:03:59,126
The issue has got too far, daughter.

2045
02:03:59,391 --> 02:04:01,159
Raj's case has been handed
over to the session.

2046
02:04:01,856 --> 02:04:03,317
Is it?
- Yes.

2047
02:04:04,007 --> 02:04:08,231
And I've to take on the case
as a public prosecutor.

2048
02:04:08,451 --> 02:04:11,662
So, your attempt will be
to get Raj convicted?

2049
02:04:12,031 --> 02:04:13,111
I regret, daughter.

2050
02:04:13,421 --> 02:04:15,151
But I've to do this duty.

2051
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:16,311
Father.

2052
02:04:16,511 --> 02:04:18,498
Had it been that I'd married Raj.

2053
02:04:18,885 --> 02:04:20,351
You still would have done this duty?

2054
02:04:20,751 --> 02:04:23,911
Shanti, I surely have affection
and sympathy for Raj.

2055
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:25,951
But the law has no
room for emotions.

2056
02:04:26,471 --> 02:04:28,094
He's accepted that
he did commit the crime.

2057
02:04:28,174 --> 02:04:29,665
Every, witness is against him.

2058
02:04:29,745 --> 02:04:31,065
The evidence is against him.

2059
02:04:31,231 --> 02:04:34,639
If the same evidence and witnesses
turn to Raj's favour, then?

2060
02:04:36,356 --> 02:04:37,751
Daughter, this is not possible anymore.

2061
02:04:38,839 --> 02:04:41,454
Father, please don't get me wrong.

2062
02:04:42,108 --> 02:04:44,622
I want to take up this
case from Raj's end.

2063
02:04:46,311 --> 02:04:48,508
That means, you'll be up against me?

2064
02:04:48,951 --> 02:04:51,661
The law has nothing to do
with relation and emotion.

2065
02:04:52,511 --> 02:04:55,151
But remember,
I'll be a lawyer against you..

2066
02:04:55,539 --> 02:04:56,991
..in the court and not your father.

2067
02:04:57,231 --> 02:05:00,751
I don't want your concession
but the blessing.

2068
02:05:03,191 --> 02:05:04,511
It doesn't matter to me.

2069
02:05:04,836 --> 02:05:07,791
If I win the case,
it'll be a lawyer's win.

2070
02:05:08,191 --> 02:05:11,711
And if you win the case,
then that'll be a father's victory.

2071
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:13,151
Either way, the victory shall be ours.

2072
02:05:13,844 --> 02:05:15,300
Good luck.

2073
02:05:29,923 --> 02:05:30,996
Silence.

2074
02:05:31,527 --> 02:05:32,526
Silence.

2075
02:05:48,802 --> 02:05:51,430
Prosecution may proceed
with the case.

2076
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:55,751
You honour.

2077
02:05:56,039 --> 02:05:58,533
This is a clear case of premeditated..

2078
02:05:58,914 --> 02:06:01,059
..deliberate and cold blooded murder.

2079
02:06:01,596 --> 02:06:02,991
You've already heard to
the witnesses from..

2080
02:06:03,071 --> 02:06:04,191
..the prosecutions end.

2081
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:06,271
Which has amply proved
that the convict..

2082
02:06:06,351 --> 02:06:08,031
..only is the murderer.

2083
02:06:08,694 --> 02:06:10,073
Still in the light of all the witness..

2084
02:06:10,153 --> 02:06:12,391
..I reiterate the whole
incident once again.

2085
02:06:13,619 --> 02:06:15,151
As per the statement of the police.

2086
02:06:15,231 --> 02:06:17,751
On 22nd August,
in the evening at five.

2087
02:06:17,927 --> 02:06:22,510
The convict took a young,
beautiful girl to a lonely place.

2088
02:06:22,751 --> 02:06:23,911
With an intention to kill.

2089
02:06:25,277 --> 02:06:29,151
Over there, he pushed the girl
from the hill to death.

2090
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:33,560
By chance, two shepherds
who were passing..

2091
02:06:33,934 --> 02:06:37,231
..from there, heard the cry of the girl.

2092
02:06:37,311 --> 02:06:40,590
When they went running
towards her they saw her body..

2093
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:42,071
..drenched in blood and the convict..

2094
02:06:42,151 --> 02:06:43,991
..standing close to her
in a perplexed condition.

2095
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:46,757
Seeing the dreadful scene,
they both ran..

2096
02:06:46,837 --> 02:06:49,246
..towards the house
of Inspector Ramlal.

2097
02:06:49,413 --> 02:06:50,871
And they narrated the whole story.

2098
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:53,546
Inspector Ramlal reached
the spot swiftly.

2099
02:06:54,657 --> 02:06:56,369
At that time the crowd had
surrounded the convict.

2100
02:06:56,449 --> 02:06:57,461
So, he couldn't run away from there.

2101
02:06:57,541 --> 02:06:58,837
And the convict was arrested.

2102
02:06:59,566 --> 02:07:02,126
Secondly your honour,
the convict accepts..

2103
02:07:02,206 --> 02:07:05,726
..the crime that he's committed
in the just mentioned way.

2104
02:07:06,602 --> 02:07:08,526
Thirdly, the post-mortem report of..

2105
02:07:08,606 --> 02:07:11,278
..Dr. Bal Krishna,
supports the statement of the convict.

2106
02:07:11,669 --> 02:07:15,493
That's why I'd request
the court to give..

2107
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:18,406
..the convict a befitting
punishment.

2108
02:07:18,637 --> 02:07:19,766
Thank you, your honour.

2109
02:07:21,286 --> 02:07:23,523
Do you accept your crime or not?

2110
02:07:24,769 --> 02:07:26,088
Yes, I accept.

2111
02:07:26,246 --> 02:07:29,251
Who was that girl and
why did you kill her?

2112
02:07:29,556 --> 02:07:31,109
I've accepted my crime..

2113
02:07:31,434 --> 02:07:33,227
..and I don't want to
say anything besides that.

2114
02:07:33,406 --> 02:07:35,162
If you don't want to
argue yourself then..

2115
02:07:35,529 --> 02:07:39,158
..the court can arrange
for a lawyer for you.

2116
02:07:39,486 --> 02:07:40,606
You honour!

2117
02:07:40,806 --> 02:07:42,631
I don't want to argue on my case..

2118
02:07:42,859 --> 02:07:44,406
..nor do I wish to have any lawyer
to fight the case.

2119
02:07:44,686 --> 02:07:45,627
Your honour!

2120
02:07:45,707 --> 02:07:47,006
Let me be given the permission.

2121
02:07:47,246 --> 02:07:48,966
So that I can argue from
the convicts end.

2122
02:07:49,295 --> 02:07:50,126
Sir!

2123
02:07:50,566 --> 02:07:52,526
I don't want any support
for my defence.

2124
02:07:52,926 --> 02:07:53,912
Your honour!

2125
02:07:53,992 --> 02:07:55,726
I am not asking the
convicts permission.

2126
02:07:56,006 --> 02:07:58,000
But the convict's sister
has asked me to..

2127
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:00,150
..speak for the convicts case.

2128
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:02,968
Ms. Shanti, if the convict is himself
not ready to co-operate..

2129
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:05,246
..then why do you want to
argue on this case unnecessarily?

2130
02:08:05,326 --> 02:08:06,324
Your honour!

2131
02:08:06,404 --> 02:08:08,393
If the convict is accepting
the crime..

2132
02:08:08,607 --> 02:08:11,126
..why does he try to hide the
circumstances which led him to do this.

2133
02:08:11,252 --> 02:08:14,166
Till the time he..
- Nobody can force me to speak on this.

2134
02:08:14,370 --> 02:08:17,926
That implies your silence is
because of your impuissance.

2135
02:08:18,006 --> 02:08:19,569
It's not my..

2136
02:08:20,407 --> 02:08:23,526
Ms. Shanti, you're granted
the permission to argue over this case.

2137
02:08:24,006 --> 02:08:25,086
Thank you, your honour.

2138
02:08:27,286 --> 02:08:30,471
Now I request the court for
the prosecution witnesses..

2139
02:08:31,045 --> 02:08:32,326
..to be cross examined.

2140
02:08:32,606 --> 02:08:33,686
Proceed.

2141
02:08:34,646 --> 02:08:36,406
Inspector Ramlal.
- Yes.

2142
02:08:36,576 --> 02:08:37,966
Did you arrest the convict?

2143
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:39,372
Yes I did.

2144
02:08:39,452 --> 02:08:41,046
How did you come to
know of the crime?

2145
02:08:41,366 --> 02:08:42,926
Two shepherds came to
my house and informed.

2146
02:08:43,006 --> 02:08:44,738
Did they tell you what they saw?

2147
02:08:44,937 --> 02:08:46,326
Yes, when they were
passing from there..

2148
02:08:46,406 --> 02:08:47,526
What were you doing then?

2149
02:08:47,606 --> 02:08:48,481
Sorry!

2150
02:08:48,561 --> 02:08:50,006
What were you doing at
that point of time?

2151
02:08:50,086 --> 02:08:51,649
I did have a night shift on that day.

2152
02:08:51,812 --> 02:08:53,046
I was resting in my house.

2153
02:08:53,759 --> 02:08:55,566
Were you in uniform?
- No.

2154
02:08:55,646 --> 02:08:56,634
I was wearing a casual dress.

2155
02:08:56,714 --> 02:08:59,431
Oh! So, you went to the
spot in the same dress.

2156
02:08:59,631 --> 02:09:01,249
No, I didn't.
- I did go wearing the uniform.

2157
02:09:01,396 --> 02:09:02,981
How much time did it take to change?

2158
02:09:03,206 --> 02:09:04,077
Nearly ten minutes.

2159
02:09:04,157 --> 02:09:06,686
What would be the distance
between the crime spot and your house?

2160
02:09:06,766 --> 02:09:07,705
Almost two miles.

2161
02:09:07,785 --> 02:09:09,645
How much time did you take
to cover that distance?

2162
02:09:10,006 --> 02:09:10,905
Nearly twenty minutes.

2163
02:09:10,985 --> 02:09:12,128
I see.

2164
02:09:12,261 --> 02:09:15,726
You took ten minutes to change and
twenty minutes to reach there.

2165
02:09:16,176 --> 02:09:18,988
It means you took thirty
minutes in totality?

2166
02:09:19,267 --> 02:09:20,120
Yes.

2167
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:23,679
Were you able to find out,
who the deceased was?

2168
02:09:23,759 --> 02:09:25,126
Where did she hail from?

2169
02:09:25,394 --> 02:09:26,511
Not yet.

2170
02:09:26,659 --> 02:09:29,684
The corpus was kept at the
mortuary for two weeks.

2171
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:31,746
It was even advertised
in the newspapers.

2172
02:09:31,938 --> 02:09:33,606
But no one claimed the corpus.

2173
02:09:34,033 --> 02:09:35,798
It seems the deceased was an orphan.

2174
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:37,621
Inspector Ramlal.

2175
02:09:37,838 --> 02:09:39,659
The post-mortem report says,
there was a scar..

2176
02:09:39,833 --> 02:09:42,068
..on the body of a knife.

2177
02:09:42,418 --> 02:09:44,775
Were you able to find the knife?

2178
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:45,785
No.

2179
02:09:45,912 --> 02:09:48,060
We did the entire search but
could not find the knife.

2180
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,700
Does it mean that you
even advertised for..

2181
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:51,250
..that unclaimed knife?

2182
02:09:53,153 --> 02:09:54,082
Actually, the thing was..

2183
02:09:54,162 --> 02:09:55,686
That's all. You can go.

2184
02:09:56,166 --> 02:09:57,246
Thank you.

2185
02:09:58,074 --> 02:10:01,512
Swear on God that whatever
you say shall be the truth.

2186
02:10:01,592 --> 02:10:05,352
Swear on God that whatever
you say shall be the truth.

2187
02:10:05,432 --> 02:10:06,512
You'll say the truth.

2188
02:10:06,592 --> 02:10:07,584
You'll say the truth.

2189
02:10:07,664 --> 02:10:08,716
Not I but you.

2190
02:10:08,796 --> 02:10:10,162
Not I but you.

2191
02:10:10,543 --> 02:10:11,548
All right.

2192
02:10:11,721 --> 02:10:12,992
Ms. Shanti, proceed.

2193
02:10:13,072 --> 02:10:14,152
Look.

2194
02:10:14,392 --> 02:10:16,476
You've said that you passed
through the way..

2195
02:10:16,556 --> 02:10:17,832
..where the killing took place.

2196
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:21,312
I was not alone madam,
my uncle was also there.

2197
02:10:21,392 --> 02:10:24,192
All right. But what was the need
for you to pass from there?

2198
02:10:24,352 --> 02:10:27,710
Madam, that's the only
way we use to take..

2199
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:29,512
..goats back home.

2200
02:10:30,122 --> 02:10:31,285
What did you see there?

2201
02:10:31,472 --> 02:10:33,519
I didn't see, first I heard.

2202
02:10:33,818 --> 02:10:35,222
There was a shrill cry.

2203
02:10:36,472 --> 02:10:37,552
Order. Order.

2204
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:40,872
Sir, one who wears the shoe
knows where it pinches.

2205
02:10:41,512 --> 02:10:43,952
So the moment you heard
the scream you ran to the spot?

2206
02:10:44,032 --> 02:10:44,916
Yes, madam.

2207
02:10:44,996 --> 02:10:47,392
And you saw the convict
murdering the girl?

2208
02:10:48,404 --> 02:10:50,352
Tell, is it true or not?

2209
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:52,368
It's all a lie.

2210
02:10:52,632 --> 02:10:57,237
When I reached at the spot
the girls was already dead.

2211
02:10:57,317 --> 02:10:59,752
And the killer was standing
to her head. Yes.

2212
02:10:59,832 --> 02:11:01,279
And the killer had the knife
in his hand, right?

2213
02:11:01,592 --> 02:11:03,312
Knife!?
- Yes knife.

2214
02:11:03,392 --> 02:11:06,001
The knife which he used to kill.

2215
02:11:06,128 --> 02:11:07,077
No, madam.

2216
02:11:07,157 --> 02:11:08,952
I didn't see any knife.

2217
02:11:09,363 --> 02:11:12,152
That means you didn't see the convict,
murdering.

2218
02:11:12,321 --> 02:11:14,112
What are you saying madam?

2219
02:11:14,352 --> 02:11:17,276
I and my uncle are brave men.

2220
02:11:17,526 --> 02:11:20,312
If he did kill in front of us then..

2221
02:11:21,742 --> 02:11:24,352
We'd forced him to run
away by shouting.

2222
02:11:24,505 --> 02:11:26,912
That means you saw the convict..

2223
02:11:26,992 --> 02:11:29,152
..at the time when
he had already killed.

2224
02:11:29,312 --> 02:11:30,269
Yes.

2225
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:32,564
Now you've got it right, madam.

2226
02:11:33,107 --> 02:11:35,479
I saw and I kept shouting.

2227
02:11:35,611 --> 02:11:36,687
I kept shouting.

2228
02:11:36,767 --> 02:11:39,352
How did you decide that the
same person is the killer?

2229
02:11:39,638 --> 02:11:44,152
Yes madam, this is something
to think about.

2230
02:11:44,483 --> 02:11:46,432
I'll just go and ask my uncle.
- No.

2231
02:11:46,512 --> 02:11:47,505
What?

2232
02:11:47,585 --> 02:11:49,166
You only tell.
- I object, your honour.

2233
02:11:49,246 --> 02:11:51,130
The defence counsel is
trying to twist the..

2234
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:53,237
..the witness's statement
so that he forgets..

2235
02:11:53,317 --> 02:11:54,801
..the convict had got stained
with fresh blood.

2236
02:11:54,881 --> 02:11:56,924
It was fresh, that's why?

2237
02:11:57,004 --> 02:11:58,346
Objection, your honour!

2238
02:11:58,426 --> 02:12:00,428
The prosecutor is trying
to put words in the..

2239
02:12:00,508 --> 02:12:01,799
..mouth of the witness.

2240
02:12:02,063 --> 02:12:04,571
Mr. Chowdhary,
you can't teach a witness..

2241
02:12:04,651 --> 02:12:06,171
..while he's being cross examined.

2242
02:12:06,344 --> 02:12:07,192
I am sorry, your honour.

2243
02:12:07,272 --> 02:12:08,395
I didn't mean that.

2244
02:12:09,136 --> 02:12:09,950
Proceed.

2245
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:12,112
The moment you did see
the girl's dead body..

2246
02:12:12,414 --> 02:12:14,408
..you ran towards inspector's house?

2247
02:12:14,488 --> 02:12:15,547
No madam.

2248
02:12:15,627 --> 02:12:17,005
First I went to the police station.

2249
02:12:17,085 --> 02:12:18,464
The inspector was not there.

2250
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:20,192
So I went to his house.

2251
02:12:20,702 --> 02:12:22,912
How much time did you
take to go from there..

2252
02:12:22,992 --> 02:12:25,020
..to the police station and then
to the inspector's house?

2253
02:12:25,185 --> 02:12:26,805
I don't wear watch..

2254
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,032
..but still around half an hour
to forty five minutes.

2255
02:12:29,883 --> 02:12:30,701
You can go.

2256
02:12:30,781 --> 02:12:33,112
God bless! God bless!

2257
02:12:34,248 --> 02:12:35,581
Second witness.

2258
02:12:37,251 --> 02:12:39,054
Dr. Balkrishna.
- Yes.

2259
02:12:39,352 --> 02:12:41,659
In your post-mortem report,
it's mentioned..

2260
02:12:41,739 --> 02:12:44,762
..that the deceased had
the knife injury too..

2261
02:12:44,842 --> 02:12:45,993
..with other injuries.

2262
02:12:46,073 --> 02:12:47,091
Yes.

2263
02:12:47,171 --> 02:12:48,259
Was it a deep wound?

2264
02:12:48,767 --> 02:12:50,258
It was actually sufficient
to lacerate the..

2265
02:12:50,338 --> 02:12:51,788
..membrane of the heart.

2266
02:12:51,868 --> 02:12:52,962
I see.

2267
02:12:54,085 --> 02:12:56,259
Now, I want to ask a
very crucial thing.

2268
02:12:56,339 --> 02:12:58,869
Which the prosecution
knowingly let..

2269
02:12:58,949 --> 02:13:01,369
..it go unnoticed
or it simply did go unnoticed.

2270
02:13:01,925 --> 02:13:04,527
Was the death of the
deceased happen..

2271
02:13:04,607 --> 02:13:06,344
..to take place because
of the stabbing as..

2272
02:13:06,792 --> 02:13:08,311
..mentioned in your report?

2273
02:13:08,906 --> 02:13:10,913
From the post-mortem report
it is evident that..

2274
02:13:11,306 --> 02:13:13,262
..there was a very little
gap between the..

2275
02:13:13,342 --> 02:13:14,975
..stabbing and then the
fall of the deceased.

2276
02:13:15,308 --> 02:13:17,600
Both incident almost happened with
little time separation.

2277
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:19,965
What do you exactly mean
when you say that?

2278
02:13:20,266 --> 02:13:24,218
I mean the death occurred
within thirty seconds of the incident.

2279
02:13:24,503 --> 02:13:26,336
Thank you doctor, you may leave.

2280
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:27,447
Thank you.

2281
02:13:30,033 --> 02:13:31,229
Your honour!

2282
02:13:31,869 --> 02:13:33,949
After the cross examination
of the witnesses.

2283
02:13:34,251 --> 02:13:37,229
There are four points which
draw special attention.

2284
02:13:38,285 --> 02:13:41,113
The first, who's the deceased
and what was..

2285
02:13:41,193 --> 02:13:43,069
..the reason behind her killing?

2286
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:44,869
It's still a mystery.

2287
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:49,549
Second thing is this that there's no
witness who has seen it happening.

2288
02:13:50,015 --> 02:13:53,029
Even those shepherds reached there
after the incident.

2289
02:13:53,526 --> 02:13:57,152
Third one is the able
'Public prosecutor' taking..

2290
02:13:57,668 --> 02:14:01,069
..the help of words like
storm and lightning..

2291
02:14:01,461 --> 02:14:05,975
..did try to prove that Inspector
Ramlal reached..

2292
02:14:06,055 --> 02:14:08,909
..the spot immediately and
arrested the convict.

2293
02:14:09,141 --> 02:14:11,695
But the convict's arrest
happened after..

2294
02:14:11,775 --> 02:14:13,669
..an hour of the whole episode.

2295
02:14:14,091 --> 02:14:15,114
Your honour!

2296
02:14:15,194 --> 02:14:17,917
If the convict did murder
intentionally.

2297
02:14:18,167 --> 02:14:20,869
As claimed by our able
'Public prosecutor'.

2298
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,749
Then why did he not
run away from there?

2299
02:14:22,829 --> 02:14:24,167
What was the need of standing near..

2300
02:14:24,247 --> 02:14:25,869
..the corpus for an hour?

2301
02:14:26,225 --> 02:14:29,989
Was he waiting for the police
to come and arrest him?

2302
02:14:30,182 --> 02:14:31,801
Fourth and the last one
is this that the corpus..

2303
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:33,542
..was lying there it self
and the convict was..

2304
02:14:33,749 --> 02:14:35,509
..standing to her head.

2305
02:14:35,903 --> 02:14:38,189
But the knife with which
the killing took place.

2306
02:14:38,423 --> 02:14:41,709
Went missing mysteriously.

2307
02:14:42,299 --> 02:14:45,069
Convict Balraj,
what did you do of the knife?

2308
02:14:45,283 --> 02:14:48,149
I've already told you I killed that girl
by pushing her from the hill.

2309
02:14:48,349 --> 02:14:49,706
Then where does the question
of knife arise?

2310
02:14:49,786 --> 02:14:52,098
You're trying to hide
the actual murderer.

2311
02:14:52,301 --> 02:14:54,504
You're lying that you've murdered.

2312
02:14:54,584 --> 02:14:55,621
I am telling the truth.

2313
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:58,782
If this is true then why don't
you tell the reason to kill?

2314
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:01,003
I killed that girl because..

2315
02:15:01,179 --> 02:15:02,549
I killed for..

2316
02:15:03,759 --> 02:15:06,862
I killed her, I don't want to
say anything besides that.

2317
02:15:07,001 --> 02:15:08,780
I request for the honour of the court.

2318
02:15:08,913 --> 02:15:10,005
Permission granted.

2319
02:15:10,359 --> 02:15:11,549
Your honour!

2320
02:15:11,629 --> 02:15:14,109
I plead to the court that I solve
the mystery of the knife.

2321
02:15:14,335 --> 02:15:15,242
Permission granted.

2322
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:16,582
Dr. Balkrishna, please.

2323
02:15:20,048 --> 02:15:21,622
Dr. Balkrishna.
- Yes.

2324
02:15:21,819 --> 02:15:24,116
Is it possible that
the deceased while..

2325
02:15:24,299 --> 02:15:26,069
..freely falling from the
hill could've collided..

2326
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:27,669
..with a sharp cliff
whose wound would..

2327
02:15:27,749 --> 02:15:28,829
..be similar to that of a knife?

2328
02:15:29,201 --> 02:15:31,869
Which cliff could be like a knife?

2329
02:15:32,083 --> 02:15:33,669
I am asking the question,
you please answer.

2330
02:15:34,303 --> 02:15:36,766
In my opinion,
there can't be such a cliff.

2331
02:15:37,915 --> 02:15:38,919
What's this?

2332
02:15:40,029 --> 02:15:41,057
Stone.

2333
02:15:41,269 --> 02:15:43,494
Does it not resemble a knife?

2334
02:15:46,269 --> 02:15:47,549
Yes, it does.

2335
02:15:47,683 --> 02:15:50,698
That means the deceased
could've possibly..

2336
02:15:50,778 --> 02:15:55,084
..hit such a similar stone
and could've got..

2337
02:15:55,164 --> 02:15:58,061
..the wound similar
to that of a knife.

2338
02:15:58,917 --> 02:15:59,909
It's possible.

2339
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,069
Very good.

2340
02:16:01,149 --> 02:16:02,867
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

2341
02:16:03,168 --> 02:16:04,359
Your honour!

2342
02:16:04,439 --> 02:16:07,389
The defence counsel did
try to prove that..

2343
02:16:07,816 --> 02:16:10,349
..the deceased had a knife wound.

2344
02:16:10,429 --> 02:16:11,866
But I say, that was not so the case..

2345
02:16:11,946 --> 02:16:15,055
..but of the stone with
which she collided.

2346
02:16:15,239 --> 02:16:17,327
And that push was given
by the convict.

2347
02:17:01,344 --> 02:17:03,528
You just now told in
your statement that..

2348
02:17:03,674 --> 02:17:06,149
..on 22nd August at around five.

2349
02:17:06,229 --> 02:17:08,669
You and your husband were
eating something..

2350
02:17:08,749 --> 02:17:12,840
..at some lonely place,
that you heard the cry for 'Help!'.

2351
02:17:13,043 --> 02:17:14,138
Yes.

2352
02:17:14,323 --> 02:17:16,445
Ad your husband ran to that
direction leaving you.

2353
02:17:17,029 --> 02:17:18,216
Yes.

2354
02:17:18,857 --> 02:17:22,309
In the meantime, you encountered
somebody's feet running.

2355
02:17:22,389 --> 02:17:23,469
Yes.

2356
02:17:23,549 --> 02:17:25,229
And that was a male feet.

2357
02:17:25,309 --> 02:17:26,389
Oh!

2358
02:17:27,844 --> 02:17:32,911
Was it that your husband took
you to such places before?

2359
02:17:33,284 --> 02:17:34,269
No.

2360
02:17:35,213 --> 02:17:37,842
That means the day
this incident took place..

2361
02:17:37,971 --> 02:17:39,530
What do you want to ask?

2362
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:41,829
I want to ask what made
him take you on that day.

2363
02:17:42,037 --> 02:17:43,966
That's because, it was his off.

2364
02:17:45,109 --> 02:17:48,669
He took me to show
the old temples, hills..

2365
02:17:49,126 --> 02:17:52,109
..and statues inscribed on stones.

2366
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:53,669
And did you like those?

2367
02:17:53,854 --> 02:17:54,829
Yes.

2368
02:17:56,269 --> 02:17:58,159
It was beautiful.

2369
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:59,469
Very good.

2370
02:17:59,909 --> 02:18:00,839
Since when are you blind?

2371
02:18:01,055 --> 02:18:02,229
By birth.

2372
02:18:03,815 --> 02:18:04,840
Your honour!

2373
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:07,669
The lady who's blind by
birth was taken by..

2374
02:18:07,749 --> 02:18:11,949
..her husband to see those
things she mentioned.

2375
02:18:12,429 --> 02:18:13,829
And she liked them too.

2376
02:18:14,743 --> 02:18:16,738
This blind girl also said
that the running..

2377
02:18:16,818 --> 02:18:19,059
..feet was that of a male.

2378
02:18:19,556 --> 02:18:22,245
That means this blind girl can see.

2379
02:18:22,798 --> 02:18:24,656
Your honour!
Who can believe this?

2380
02:18:25,008 --> 02:18:26,676
She's just come to save
her husband by..

2381
02:18:26,756 --> 02:18:28,869
..giving a false witness.
- No, no.

2382
02:18:29,323 --> 02:18:31,196
Whatever I am saying is true.

2383
02:18:31,961 --> 02:18:35,676
I can't see through eyes
but can recognize..

2384
02:18:35,756 --> 02:18:37,655
..by touching things.

2385
02:18:37,879 --> 02:18:38,956
Is it?

2386
02:18:39,036 --> 02:18:40,956
You can touch and recognize.

2387
02:18:41,036 --> 02:18:42,116
Yes.

2388
02:18:43,144 --> 02:18:44,527
With your permission your honour.

2389
02:18:44,756 --> 02:18:45,836
Bring your hand.

2390
02:18:50,156 --> 02:18:51,236
What is this?

2391
02:18:52,116 --> 02:18:53,236
Glasses.

2392
02:18:54,916 --> 02:18:56,076
Very good.

2393
02:18:57,156 --> 02:18:58,236
What is this?

2394
02:18:59,836 --> 02:19:00,889
A pointed stone.

2395
02:19:00,969 --> 02:19:02,396
Please, excuse me.

2396
02:19:04,836 --> 02:19:09,236
Tell me, which finger of
mine is the smallest.

2397
02:19:10,537 --> 02:19:12,353
This is not your hand
but that of a lady.

2398
02:19:12,433 --> 02:19:15,026
No, it's my hand.
- No, I know its sister Shanti's hand.

2399
02:19:15,166 --> 02:19:17,825
Why are you lying and making
fun of my blindness?

2400
02:19:17,905 --> 02:19:19,063
Your honour!

2401
02:19:19,143 --> 02:19:21,676
I don't understand as to
why this blind girl..

2402
02:19:21,756 --> 02:19:24,676
..is being subjected
to humiliation to..

2403
02:19:24,756 --> 02:19:26,958
..get the case to be a true one.

2404
02:19:27,396 --> 02:19:29,225
'Public prosecutor'
has made fun of her..

2405
02:19:29,409 --> 02:19:32,486
..by addressing her
repeatedly as blind.

2406
02:19:32,791 --> 02:19:37,081
I can claim that
she's not blind but can see.

2407
02:19:37,316 --> 02:19:39,259
And her eyes are her husband.

2408
02:19:39,831 --> 02:19:42,952
With the eyes of her husband
she can see all things..

2409
02:19:43,032 --> 02:19:45,226
..and can enjoy them.

2410
02:19:45,435 --> 02:19:48,165
There's no such thing
which an Indian girl..

2411
02:19:48,339 --> 02:19:50,233
..can't see with her husband's eyes.

2412
02:19:50,576 --> 02:19:51,763
How can this happen?

2413
02:19:51,843 --> 02:19:56,296
Only that person can understand who
knows the depth of a women's heart.

2414
02:19:56,376 --> 02:19:57,559
Very good.

2415
02:19:57,639 --> 02:19:58,759
But, your honour.

2416
02:19:58,839 --> 02:20:01,152
What relation does this
lesson hold with law?

2417
02:20:01,298 --> 02:20:02,389
I didn't understand this.

2418
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:03,734
You honour!

2419
02:20:03,874 --> 02:20:06,425
Recognizing things without
seeing is something..

2420
02:20:06,933 --> 02:20:09,091
..what a blind can do
in a better way than somebody..

2421
02:20:09,171 --> 02:20:11,026
..who's blessed with vision.

2422
02:20:11,470 --> 02:20:13,461
I can claim that if she
touches the feet of the..

2423
02:20:13,541 --> 02:20:15,793
..person she had met.

2424
02:20:15,873 --> 02:20:17,460
She'll be able to recognize
immediately.

2425
02:20:26,876 --> 02:20:30,196
Open the door.

2426
02:20:30,769 --> 02:20:35,015
Hurry up!

2427
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:37,895
Oh no! Move away. Leave me.

2428
02:20:38,034 --> 02:20:40,325
What has happened to you? -
Nothing.

2429
02:20:40,405 --> 02:20:41,917
I am walking straight.

2430
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:43,009
Come, please sit.

2431
02:20:43,089 --> 02:20:44,299
I'll sit.

2432
02:20:44,379 --> 02:20:46,090
First you go and apply kohl.

2433
02:20:46,170 --> 02:20:48,337
Come on, go.
Go and apply kohl.

2434
02:20:55,676 --> 02:20:56,756
Bela.

2435
02:20:57,356 --> 02:20:58,524
Bela.

2436
02:20:59,141 --> 02:21:03,318
Bela, where are you hiding?

2437
02:21:04,099 --> 02:21:05,172
Bela.

2438
02:21:06,436 --> 02:21:07,693
She's hiding here.

2439
02:21:08,651 --> 02:21:09,666
Bela.

2440
02:21:09,812 --> 02:21:13,036
My sweetheart, my liver, my heart..

2441
02:21:13,116 --> 02:21:15,058
Have you got killed?

2442
02:21:19,058 --> 02:21:20,429
Now, you and I..

2443
02:21:21,078 --> 02:21:23,253
How'll we meet?

2444
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:29,996
By the way..
How will you bring her? With whom?

2445
02:21:30,552 --> 02:21:33,478
Bad, very bad.

2446
02:21:33,992 --> 02:21:36,816
Sad.

2447
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:39,743
Very bad.

2448
02:21:58,022 --> 02:22:00,579
Gauri, what's this lunacy?

2449
02:22:00,992 --> 02:22:04,082
If you're not going to eat,
will he be released?

2450
02:22:05,098 --> 02:22:06,157
I've told you.

2451
02:22:06,237 --> 02:22:08,628
I'll get him to you.
That's my responsibility.

2452
02:22:10,427 --> 02:22:13,817
My desire to drink and eat
rests with him, sister.

2453
02:22:14,589 --> 02:22:16,030
Don't be crazy, Gauri.

2454
02:22:16,410 --> 02:22:17,910
You're not alone anymore.

2455
02:22:18,442 --> 02:22:20,687
You've got to care
for the unborn too.

2456
02:22:22,916 --> 02:22:24,156
All right.

2457
02:22:24,369 --> 02:22:25,273
Drink this milk.

2458
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,590
Drink it for sure, I'll just come.

2459
02:22:37,025 --> 02:22:38,088
Vijay!

2460
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:40,399
How come you're here at late night?

2461
02:22:41,282 --> 02:22:42,439
Why are you crying?

2462
02:22:42,519 --> 02:22:43,472
Come.

2463
02:22:43,552 --> 02:22:45,919
Come inside.
- I've come with some important work.

2464
02:22:46,448 --> 02:22:47,439
What work?

2465
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:56,959
Bela!

2466
02:23:00,823 --> 02:23:01,719
Oh!

2467
02:23:03,067 --> 02:23:04,106
Now, I understood.

2468
02:23:05,027 --> 02:23:06,799
Why are eyes in tears?

2469
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:11,239
Vijay, the sacrifice that
you're giving today.

2470
02:23:11,839 --> 02:23:14,433
Must be the first one
in the whole world.

2471
02:23:14,513 --> 02:23:15,553
Enough.

2472
02:23:16,248 --> 02:23:17,639
Don't praise me.

2473
02:23:17,808 --> 02:23:18,799
I'll go.

2474
02:23:34,979 --> 02:23:37,559
Vijay, you've come.

2475
02:23:40,247 --> 02:23:41,719
Where are the letters?

2476
02:23:41,799 --> 02:23:43,439
The letters have reached
their destination.

2477
02:23:43,519 --> 02:23:44,449
Where?

2478
02:23:44,529 --> 02:23:45,799
To sister, Shanti.

2479
02:23:45,879 --> 02:23:46,959
Oh!

2480
02:23:47,235 --> 02:23:48,479
To Shanti.

2481
02:23:48,894 --> 02:23:51,559
You unlucky!
You've prepared yourself to be a widow?

2482
02:23:51,839 --> 02:23:53,239
If I become a widow
some woman will..

2483
02:23:53,319 --> 02:23:55,119
..be able to save her
husband, at least.

2484
02:23:55,678 --> 02:23:56,919
Why should she be a widow?

2485
02:23:57,331 --> 02:23:58,799
Why shouldn't be the wife
of a sinner become widow?

2486
02:23:58,879 --> 02:23:59,809
I, a sinner?

2487
02:23:59,889 --> 02:24:01,119
You call me a sinner?

2488
02:24:01,199 --> 02:24:02,252
Not only this.

2489
02:24:02,876 --> 02:24:04,918
I also would like to save
other girls from..

2490
02:24:04,998 --> 02:24:06,479
..becoming your victim.

2491
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:08,239
So that they don't become
compelled to..

2492
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:09,723
..suicide like Sheela and Bela did.

2493
02:24:09,803 --> 02:24:10,947
Wow!

2494
02:24:11,027 --> 02:24:13,415
As if you've taken the responsibility of
all the girls in this world.

2495
02:24:13,547 --> 02:24:14,689
Tell me the truth, where were you?

2496
02:24:14,769 --> 02:24:16,559
I told you, I'd gone to sister Shanti.

2497
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:19,528
You'd gone to learn,
how one enjoys in world.

2498
02:24:19,608 --> 02:24:20,696
Please, keep quiet.

2499
02:24:20,823 --> 02:24:23,719
The word enjoyment is meant
for men and not women.

2500
02:24:24,039 --> 02:24:26,119
Your eyes have got covered with sin.

2501
02:24:26,428 --> 02:24:28,531
That's why you see everybody
as a sinner like you.

2502
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:29,710
I, a sinner?

2503
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:31,528
You call your husband, a sinner?

2504
02:24:31,719 --> 02:24:32,799
Husband?

2505
02:24:32,879 --> 02:24:35,639
Husband is the one who
only loves his wife.

2506
02:24:35,719 --> 02:24:36,799
You dare so.

2507
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:38,154
Stop!

2508
02:24:38,234 --> 02:24:40,079
Today, I'll..

2509
02:24:43,239 --> 02:24:44,319
Stop!

2510
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,364
Wait.

2511
02:24:45,444 --> 02:24:46,679
Where will you run?

2512
02:24:59,959 --> 02:25:01,639
That's good.

2513
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:03,879
You keep sitting with the Goddess.

2514
02:25:04,175 --> 02:25:08,239
The world may be blind but
the Goddess has the eyes.

2515
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:10,119
She'll herself do the justice.

2516
02:25:10,446 --> 02:25:15,959
Thanks, to the Goddess that she
saved me from killing you.

2517
02:25:16,039 --> 02:25:17,708
Hail! To the Goddess.

2518
02:26:08,096 --> 02:26:09,120
Who's it?

2519
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,150
Ram Singh!

2520
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:11,389
Hariya! Come soon.

2521
02:26:11,469 --> 02:26:13,100
Ram Singh.
- Leave!

2522
02:26:13,521 --> 02:26:16,673
Leave me or else I'll break your skull.

2523
02:26:16,753 --> 02:26:18,711
Move. Leave me!

2524
02:26:18,791 --> 02:26:21,062
Let me go.

2525
02:26:21,479 --> 02:26:23,382
Hello. Police.
- Leave me.

2526
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:25,799
617.

2527
02:26:28,605 --> 02:26:29,926
Get all the prisoners
who are in lock up.

2528
02:26:30,006 --> 02:26:33,543
They are required for murder
identification parade.

2529
02:26:33,689 --> 02:26:34,715
Ok sir.

2530
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,006
Hey you!

2531
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:14,419
Press the hand and go.

2532
02:27:16,151 --> 02:27:17,319
Get off the shoes.

2533
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:21,479
Sister, Shanti.

2534
02:27:21,559 --> 02:27:23,527
He's the one.
- Move. Get away.

2535
02:27:23,607 --> 02:27:24,651
Gauri.

2536
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:27,181
O God!

2537
02:27:27,261 --> 02:27:28,380
Blood!

2538
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:31,826
Mr. Balam.
- Yes please.

2539
02:27:32,278 --> 02:27:33,719
Do you know the deceased?

2540
02:27:33,799 --> 02:27:34,624
Pardon!

2541
02:27:34,704 --> 02:27:36,319
You know the deceased?

2542
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:38,401
Actually, I've never heard of
any madam with this name.

2543
02:27:38,481 --> 02:27:41,549
I mean the girl who got killed.

2544
02:27:41,629 --> 02:27:42,799
I see.

2545
02:27:43,372 --> 02:27:44,550
Yes, undoubtedly.

2546
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:46,357
Even the convict knows her
and you too know her.

2547
02:27:49,063 --> 02:27:50,515
Do you all know the girl?

2548
02:27:50,878 --> 02:27:51,913
Yes, your honour.

2549
02:27:51,993 --> 02:27:53,871
Then why was this hidden from
the court till today?

2550
02:27:54,089 --> 02:27:57,467
Your honour! The reason was this
that the information about..

2551
02:27:57,547 --> 02:27:59,909
..the deceased we got last night in
letters and photo.

2552
02:28:00,401 --> 02:28:01,728
These are those letters
which were written..

2553
02:28:01,808 --> 02:28:03,470
..by the deceased to Balam.

2554
02:28:04,390 --> 02:28:05,898
How did you get these letters?

2555
02:28:06,482 --> 02:28:09,048
Vijay, the wife of Balam,
herself handed-over them to me.

2556
02:28:09,381 --> 02:28:12,137
And last night, Balam
was arrested from..

2557
02:28:12,217 --> 02:28:15,000
..my house, trying to steal these.

2558
02:28:15,491 --> 02:28:17,239
From these letters its
very evident that..

2559
02:28:17,533 --> 02:28:20,288
..the deceased had intimate
relationship with Balam.

2560
02:28:21,372 --> 02:28:25,474
Balam used to get paid
for that relationship.

2561
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:26,992
Is it true?

2562
02:28:27,072 --> 02:28:30,888
Sir, every couple does so.

2563
02:28:31,168 --> 02:28:34,448
When a male lover can take
care of his sweetheart.

2564
02:28:34,528 --> 02:28:37,460
Then what so big deal in a
rich girl doing the same.

2565
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:41,408
Your honour! The point is Balam did know
the deceased very nicely.

2566
02:28:41,618 --> 02:28:43,368
And he also knew of
her getting killed.

2567
02:28:43,624 --> 02:28:45,768
Then why did he knowingly
keep quite till now?

2568
02:28:45,848 --> 02:28:47,728
Sir, there's only one
reason for me and..

2569
02:28:47,808 --> 02:28:49,368
..the convict to be mute.

2570
02:28:49,448 --> 02:28:52,386
That means you too are related
with this murder.

2571
02:28:52,466 --> 02:28:53,507
Surely.

2572
02:28:54,173 --> 02:28:56,608
But not in the manner
what you think.

2573
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:58,808
Sir.

2574
02:28:59,029 --> 02:29:02,608
From the day the niece
of the convict got married to me.

2575
02:29:03,150 --> 02:29:04,768
We never got along well.

2576
02:29:05,301 --> 02:29:07,528
After getting irritated
of the day-night quarrel.

2577
02:29:07,852 --> 02:29:10,368
I did find my solace in Bela's love.

2578
02:29:10,928 --> 02:29:12,528
The joy that Vijay couldn't give me.

2579
02:29:12,751 --> 02:29:13,808
I got that from Bela.

2580
02:29:14,629 --> 02:29:16,311
When the convict got to
know this..

2581
02:29:16,895 --> 02:29:20,666
..then for his niece,
for whom he can go to any extent.

2582
02:29:21,307 --> 02:29:23,968
He killed Bela.

2583
02:29:24,728 --> 02:29:25,808
Sir.

2584
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:28,128
Now you must have got the
reason of his silence.

2585
02:29:29,081 --> 02:29:30,608
The convict is an educated man.

2586
02:29:31,106 --> 02:29:34,928
He doesn't want any stigma
on his family or his niece.

2587
02:29:35,391 --> 02:29:38,888
Convict Balraj, do you agree
to what Balam said?

2588
02:29:38,968 --> 02:29:41,802
Whatever Balam said,
I adhere to that.

2589
02:29:42,008 --> 02:29:43,728
Since the case started
the convict has..

2590
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:45,062
..been saying only one thing.

2591
02:29:45,142 --> 02:29:46,328
I've killed her.

2592
02:29:46,408 --> 02:29:49,328
I accept the crime.
I adhere to the statement.

2593
02:29:50,282 --> 02:29:52,608
The convict is not ready to
say anything besides this.

2594
02:29:53,728 --> 02:29:54,808
Your honour!

2595
02:29:55,571 --> 02:29:56,728
Now, I want to present
a witness who..

2596
02:29:56,808 --> 02:30:00,055
..was present at the time when the crime
was being committed.

2597
02:30:00,135 --> 02:30:01,998
Why was this witness not
produced till today?

2598
02:30:02,465 --> 02:30:04,728
That's because,
he came into light from the..

2599
02:30:04,808 --> 02:30:06,328
..letters which Bela wrote to Balam.

2600
02:30:13,048 --> 02:30:14,128
Oh! I see.

2601
02:30:14,208 --> 02:30:15,288
Proceed.

2602
02:30:15,731 --> 02:30:17,728
I want to make one more
request to the court.

2603
02:30:17,808 --> 02:30:19,458
Till the time this case gets over..

2604
02:30:19,808 --> 02:30:21,528
..Balam be kept in the court itself.

2605
02:30:21,992 --> 02:30:23,048
All right.

2606
02:30:23,128 --> 02:30:25,561
My witness is, Khatpatiya.

2607
02:30:26,728 --> 02:30:27,808
Proceed.

2608
02:30:31,488 --> 02:30:33,728
Is it true that the love
between Balam and Bela..

2609
02:30:33,808 --> 02:30:35,736
..took place after Balam's marriage?

2610
02:30:35,878 --> 02:30:36,767
It's not so.

2611
02:30:36,847 --> 02:30:38,772
They were involved with
each other much before.

2612
02:30:38,949 --> 02:30:40,524
Then how did Bela give
the permission to..

2613
02:30:40,604 --> 02:30:41,854
..Balam to marry Vijay?

2614
02:30:42,043 --> 02:30:44,876
How could the poor know that
he's playing a double game?

2615
02:30:45,003 --> 02:30:48,431
When she came to know
of all this..

2616
02:30:48,563 --> 02:30:51,914
..then out of being jealous,
she came from the city to the village.

2617
02:30:53,122 --> 02:30:55,696
Did you see with your eyes
Balam killing Bela?

2618
02:30:55,776 --> 02:30:56,639
Yes I did

2619
02:30:56,719 --> 02:30:58,448
When I reached the top of the hill.

2620
02:30:58,528 --> 02:31:01,196
I saw Balam and Bela
fighting over there.

2621
02:31:01,528 --> 02:31:04,487
Bela angrily was showing
some letters to Balam.

2622
02:31:04,677 --> 02:31:06,685
Balam forcibly snatched those
letters after reading them.

2623
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:08,448
Then Bela got the knife out.

2624
02:31:08,648 --> 02:31:12,754
Seeing the knife Balam said,
'I see, so you think you can kill me.'

2625
02:31:12,834 --> 02:31:14,608
Saying this, he pounced on her.

2626
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:17,906
Snatching the knife from Bela,
he stabbed her in the chest.

2627
02:31:18,128 --> 02:31:19,394
Then there was a shrill cry.

2628
02:31:19,474 --> 02:31:21,756
And Bela got rolled down
and fell off the hill.

2629
02:31:22,109 --> 02:31:24,346
Out of fear, I was perspiring.

2630
02:31:24,426 --> 02:31:25,981
I hid myself behind a cliff.

2631
02:31:26,334 --> 02:31:27,976
Balam went running in front of me.

2632
02:31:28,231 --> 02:31:32,079
And my Lord, I did see that his
clothes were blood stained.

2633
02:31:32,839 --> 02:31:34,208
What happened to that knife?

2634
02:31:34,288 --> 02:31:35,368
Of knife!

2635
02:31:35,448 --> 02:31:37,380
The knife was with Balam
while running.

2636
02:31:38,072 --> 02:31:39,467
That's all your honour.

2637
02:31:39,955 --> 02:31:42,798
Now the able 'Public prosecutor'
can cross-examine.

2638
02:31:42,878 --> 02:31:44,088
Thank you.

2639
02:31:50,222 --> 02:31:51,430
What is your occupation?

2640
02:31:51,642 --> 02:31:53,779
Actually, nothing.
I am unemployed.

2641
02:31:53,963 --> 02:31:55,549
How do you support yourself?
- What?

2642
02:31:56,009 --> 02:31:57,166
How do you support yourself?

2643
02:31:57,428 --> 02:31:59,628
My livelihood is on my friends.

2644
02:32:00,055 --> 02:32:01,497
Is Balam one of your friends?

2645
02:32:01,577 --> 02:32:03,430
Actually, Balam used to be.

2646
02:32:04,048 --> 02:32:07,513
What does it mean?
- I mean, he's a very miser man.

2647
02:32:07,593 --> 02:32:09,339
If one asks for twenty,
he gives five.

2648
02:32:09,419 --> 02:32:11,187
And later he stopped that too.

2649
02:32:11,267 --> 02:32:12,441
I see.

2650
02:32:12,608 --> 02:32:15,115
That means, when Balam stopped
giving you money.

2651
02:32:15,195 --> 02:32:16,728
You became his enemy
and came here to..

2652
02:32:16,808 --> 02:32:18,857
..become a false witness.
- No, sir.

2653
02:32:18,937 --> 02:32:21,057
I swear what I said is true.

2654
02:32:21,202 --> 02:32:22,436
Then where were you till today?

2655
02:32:22,594 --> 02:32:24,296
Why didn't you report to the
police after the murder?

2656
02:32:24,376 --> 02:32:25,225
Please see, sir.

2657
02:32:25,305 --> 02:32:27,910
At that time I thought,
after all I am a friend of Balam.

2658
02:32:28,078 --> 02:32:29,864
I too don't get embroiled in all this.

2659
02:32:30,456 --> 02:32:31,656
Then how did you think
now that you..

2660
02:32:31,736 --> 02:32:33,296
..won't be getting in trouble?

2661
02:32:33,376 --> 02:32:37,136
Actually.. Ms. Shanti has assured
me that she'll save me.

2662
02:32:37,216 --> 02:32:38,536
Very good!

2663
02:32:38,616 --> 02:32:39,764
Your honour!

2664
02:32:39,896 --> 02:32:42,216
Everybody knows that Khatpatiya
is an enemy to Balam.

2665
02:32:42,296 --> 02:32:44,183
The defence counsel
took advantage of it.

2666
02:32:44,263 --> 02:32:45,972
She taught him thoroughly and got..

2667
02:32:46,052 --> 02:32:48,829
..him presented in the court.

2668
02:32:48,909 --> 02:32:50,352
I'd request the court to
take action against..

2669
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:52,696
..him for being a false witness.

2670
02:32:52,776 --> 02:32:53,856
Your honour!

2671
02:32:54,155 --> 02:32:55,888
I didn't teach this witness
anything as such.

2672
02:32:55,968 --> 02:32:57,639
He's just stated what he saw.

2673
02:32:57,918 --> 02:32:59,639
One can feel the sympathy
for innocence..

2674
02:32:59,719 --> 02:33:02,559
..in his statement and not enmity.

2675
02:33:02,882 --> 02:33:04,656
Seeing an honest man on
the verge of being..

2676
02:33:04,736 --> 02:33:06,656
..punished, he's come here
to give his statement..

2677
02:33:06,736 --> 02:33:08,371
..taking the assurance of
his protection from me.

2678
02:33:09,014 --> 02:33:10,448
Very good.

2679
02:33:10,528 --> 02:33:11,726
Your honour!

2680
02:33:11,955 --> 02:33:13,656
My 'Defence counsel' feels
that this vagabond..

2681
02:33:14,231 --> 02:33:16,656
..suddenly started having
a soft corner for..

2682
02:33:16,736 --> 02:33:18,976
..this convict and came
here as a witness..

2683
02:33:19,056 --> 02:33:21,975
..against his enemy.

2684
02:33:22,276 --> 02:33:24,296
Your honour! There's still
a very important point left to discuss.

2685
02:33:24,376 --> 02:33:26,656
Till the time the knife
and the clothes related..

2686
02:33:26,736 --> 02:33:28,474
..to the incident is recovered,
his statement..

2687
02:33:28,791 --> 02:33:30,518
..can't be taken seriously.

2688
02:33:31,376 --> 02:33:32,496
That's all your honour.

2689
02:33:32,576 --> 02:33:34,229
You can go.
- Can, I!

2690
02:33:41,296 --> 02:33:43,475
The decision is put on
hold till tomorrow.

2691
02:33:48,256 --> 02:33:49,336
Mother Goddess!

2692
02:33:49,874 --> 02:33:51,118
At least, you're the one
who gives justice.

2693
02:33:52,056 --> 02:33:54,178
In your court, the truth
has always been..

2694
02:33:54,610 --> 02:33:55,975
..victorious and the lie has lost.

2695
02:33:56,717 --> 02:33:58,608
Mother, protect the innocent.

2696
02:33:59,211 --> 02:34:00,536
Tell me you'll do.

2697
02:34:00,616 --> 02:34:02,137
That the truth shall be victorious.

2698
02:34:02,836 --> 02:34:04,376
Why don't you say?

2699
02:34:04,776 --> 02:34:05,908
Tell you'll do it.

2700
02:34:06,216 --> 02:34:07,376
Mother!

2701
02:34:07,456 --> 02:34:08,629
Say, Goddess.

2702
02:34:08,898 --> 02:34:11,411
Say, Goddess.

2703
02:34:11,787 --> 02:34:14,216
Goddess!
Say, Goddess.

2704
02:34:14,349 --> 02:34:15,479
Say, Goddess.

2705
02:34:20,024 --> 02:34:22,271
Even though the defence
counsel has..

2706
02:34:22,351 --> 02:34:24,887
..tried to prove her point very
sternly and with courage.

2707
02:34:25,296 --> 02:34:26,740
That the convict is innocent.

2708
02:34:26,976 --> 02:34:29,094
And that Balam is responsible
for the murder.

2709
02:34:30,056 --> 02:34:31,341
But the blind daughter
of Balam who..

2710
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:32,877
..happens to be the
wife of the convict.

2711
02:34:33,056 --> 02:34:35,929
Her statement holds no value
in the eyes of law.

2712
02:34:36,957 --> 02:34:38,656
And the friend of Balam,
Khatpatiya's..

2713
02:34:38,736 --> 02:34:40,816
..statement is also not a solid one.

2714
02:34:41,256 --> 02:34:43,656
Nor could the defence counsel
get the knife..

2715
02:34:43,736 --> 02:34:45,296
..and stained cloth presented.

2716
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:50,069
Besides, the convict is still
accepting this crime.

2717
02:34:50,416 --> 02:34:54,701
In the light of all these,
the court, to the convict..

2718
02:34:54,781 --> 02:34:57,743
Stop! Stop!
- For God's sake, listen to me.

2719
02:34:57,901 --> 02:34:59,296
Who's this girl?

2720
02:34:59,559 --> 02:35:01,411
She's the wife of Balam, Vijay.
Your honour!

2721
02:35:01,491 --> 02:35:03,323
Sister, these are the
cloths of my husband.

2722
02:35:03,403 --> 02:35:05,541
And this is the knife, sister.
Take this.

2723
02:35:05,621 --> 02:35:07,376
And save my uncle.

2724
02:35:12,734 --> 02:35:13,858
Your honour!

2725
02:35:14,005 --> 02:35:15,656
To raise certain doubts
on this mystery, I want..

2726
02:35:15,736 --> 02:35:16,897
..to ask a few questions
to the convict.

2727
02:35:16,977 --> 02:35:17,933
Permission granted.

2728
02:35:18,013 --> 02:35:20,564
Thank you.
- Come, Vijay.

2729
02:35:26,136 --> 02:35:28,656
Can you surely say that
there was nobody..

2730
02:35:28,736 --> 02:35:30,956
..there at the time of murder?

2731
02:35:31,118 --> 02:35:32,702
Yes, I say so surely.

2732
02:35:33,311 --> 02:35:34,635
These are the clothes of Balam.

2733
02:35:35,016 --> 02:35:36,613
How did it get blood stained?

2734
02:35:37,182 --> 02:35:38,291
Yes, I recall.

2735
02:35:38,714 --> 02:35:40,299
The time when I was killing that girl..

2736
02:35:40,379 --> 02:35:41,816
..Balam came forward for her help.

2737
02:35:41,896 --> 02:35:43,503
Your honour!
This point, be noted.

2738
02:35:43,971 --> 02:35:45,319
Were you using the knife to kill?

2739
02:35:45,399 --> 02:35:46,485
No.

2740
02:35:46,565 --> 02:35:48,059
Then how did this knife
get traces of blood?

2741
02:35:48,856 --> 02:35:50,908
I don't know this.
- You know it very well.

2742
02:35:51,061 --> 02:35:53,499
You didn't kill the deceased
by pushing her.

2743
02:35:53,656 --> 02:35:55,815
But it was Balam, who killed
Bela with this knife.

2744
02:35:56,136 --> 02:35:59,013
The traces of Bela's blood are
present on Balam's cloth.

2745
02:35:59,481 --> 02:36:02,656
You honour! Besides,
the killer's knife and cloth..

2746
02:36:03,669 --> 02:36:05,656
..these are those letters
which Balam..

2747
02:36:05,736 --> 02:36:06,856
..wrote addressing Bela.

2748
02:36:07,011 --> 02:36:08,850
And this is Bela's handbag.

2749
02:36:09,348 --> 02:36:11,075
Now, there's no doubt
over it that..

2750
02:36:11,155 --> 02:36:13,213
..the actual killer of Bela is Balam.

2751
02:36:13,598 --> 02:36:16,656
And this too is clear as
to why was the convict Raj..

2752
02:36:16,984 --> 02:36:19,548
..owning up someone
else's crime.

2753
02:36:19,884 --> 02:36:22,656
That was so as he was
none other than the..

2754
02:36:22,736 --> 02:36:24,838
..husband of Raj's niece

2755
02:36:25,442 --> 02:36:29,704
Raj didn't want that due
to this, his niece..

2756
02:36:29,784 --> 02:36:32,200
..Vijay's life gets destroyed.
- Shanti!

2757
02:36:33,136 --> 02:36:35,561
Why are you undoing what I did?

2758
02:36:35,947 --> 02:36:37,795
Are you the enemy of
Vijay's happiness?

2759
02:36:37,973 --> 02:36:39,656
Do you want that Vijay
gets devastated..

2760
02:36:39,736 --> 02:36:40,984
..she becomes a widow?

2761
02:36:41,064 --> 02:36:42,171
That's enough Mr. Raj.

2762
02:36:42,251 --> 02:36:44,656
Please stop!
- You sit down, Balam!

2763
02:36:45,056 --> 02:36:47,075
Your honour! This murder has been
committed by me.

2764
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:49,131
I've done this murder.
- No!

2765
02:36:51,408 --> 02:36:52,781
Sir!

2766
02:36:52,971 --> 02:36:56,145
I consent that I've done this
murder with this knife.

2767
02:36:56,962 --> 02:36:59,747
The statement of my friend
Khatpatiya is correct.

2768
02:37:00,755 --> 02:37:03,214
In the world, where there's
so much of honesty..

2769
02:37:03,492 --> 02:37:05,904
..that to save an innocent,
these people..

2770
02:37:05,984 --> 02:37:07,546
..are trying so hard.

2771
02:37:08,894 --> 02:37:10,701
I don't have the right
to stay there.

2772
02:37:12,393 --> 02:37:13,936
Sir, please punish me.

2773
02:37:14,251 --> 02:37:16,405
Please, get me executed.

2774
02:37:16,567 --> 02:37:17,947
Please, punish me.

2775
02:37:18,155 --> 02:37:19,273
Your honour!

2776
02:37:19,353 --> 02:37:21,151
It's now proved that the
murderer of Bela..

2777
02:37:21,231 --> 02:37:23,161
..is not the convict but Balam.

2778
02:37:23,765 --> 02:37:25,395
The statement of Khatpatiya
is correct.

2779
02:37:25,658 --> 02:37:28,338
When Bela did try to
kill Balam, then..

2780
02:37:28,418 --> 02:37:30,401
..on self-defense,
Balam did kill Bela.

2781
02:37:30,909 --> 02:37:33,037
Your honour!
Considering the circumstances..

2782
02:37:33,301 --> 02:37:35,841
..and especially this point.

2783
02:37:36,171 --> 02:37:37,988
That in the apprehension
of the real killer.

2784
02:37:38,181 --> 02:37:40,338
His own wife has played
a vital role..

2785
02:37:40,694 --> 02:37:43,608
..I request the court to
sentence a minimum..

2786
02:37:43,781 --> 02:37:45,950
..of the punishment to Balam.

2787
02:37:46,392 --> 02:37:47,590
Thank you, your honour.

2788
02:38:00,231 --> 02:38:01,962
What does the prosecution
has to say on this?

2789
02:38:02,938 --> 02:38:04,435
I don't have anything to say,
you honour.

2790
02:38:04,562 --> 02:38:06,457
I do agree to the view
of 'Defence counsel'.

2791
02:38:08,417 --> 02:38:10,935
I hereby free Mr. Balraj.

2792
02:38:11,402 --> 02:38:12,713
Take Balam in custody.

2793
02:38:17,227 --> 02:38:18,166
Please, forgive.

2794
02:38:18,246 --> 02:38:19,415
Please, forgive me.

2795
02:38:19,495 --> 02:38:20,608
Vijay.

2796
02:38:21,142 --> 02:38:22,923
Vijay, what is this you're doing?

2797
02:38:23,003 --> 02:38:25,158
Say once that you've forgiven me.

2798
02:38:25,528 --> 02:38:28,148
Vijay, who am I to forgive?

2799
02:38:29,011 --> 02:38:31,188
My body shall get the
punishment but..

2800
02:38:31,268 --> 02:38:32,666
..you've saved my soul.

2801
02:38:32,746 --> 02:38:35,768
No, I am a sinner.
Let it be anything.

2802
02:38:35,848 --> 02:38:38,191
The stain of I getting
my husband arrested..

2803
02:38:38,368 --> 02:38:39,982
..shall always remain with me.

2804
02:38:40,429 --> 02:38:41,549
No, Vijay.

2805
02:38:41,723 --> 02:38:43,760
You're a Goddess.

2806
02:38:44,017 --> 02:38:46,579
There might be countless
sinful husbands like me.

2807
02:38:47,254 --> 02:38:52,519
You've saved those girls
from their torture.

2808
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:55,413
- All right. You let me go.
- No.

2809
02:38:55,657 --> 02:38:57,177
Take me too, along with you.
- Vijay!

2810
02:38:57,257 --> 02:38:58,377
Wherever, you'll be.

2811
02:38:58,457 --> 02:39:00,217
The place shall be a heaven for me.
- Vijay!

2812
02:39:02,551 --> 02:39:03,457
Vijay.

2813
02:39:04,697 --> 02:39:06,417
Vijay, I did try my best.

2814
02:39:07,497 --> 02:39:09,177
But God wanted otherwise.

2815
02:39:10,137 --> 02:39:11,617
Be brave, Vijay.

2816
02:39:11,915 --> 02:39:13,647
I assure you that Balam
won't be getting..

2817
02:39:13,727 --> 02:39:15,653
..punishment what you think.

2818
02:39:16,302 --> 02:39:18,377
Balam shall return from
the jail as reformed man.

2819
02:39:18,577 --> 02:39:19,857
He'll be a human being.

2820
02:39:20,147 --> 02:39:21,564
Then, you shall be happy with him.

2821
02:39:21,644 --> 02:39:25,097
Vijay. Whatever God does,
it's for the good.

2822
02:39:25,412 --> 02:39:27,217
Right now, Gauri needs us.

2823
02:39:27,474 --> 02:39:28,377
Come.
- Gauri!

2824
02:39:28,683 --> 02:39:31,046
Where's Gauri?
- She's in hospital. Please come.

2825
02:39:33,841 --> 02:39:34,881
Gauri!

2826
02:39:37,209 --> 02:39:38,373
You've come!

2827
02:39:38,453 --> 02:39:39,617
Sister, Gauri.

2828
02:39:39,697 --> 02:39:41,266
Take care of the one
who belongs to you.

2829
02:39:42,059 --> 02:39:43,457
Gauri, how's your health now?

2830
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:46,348
I thank God that you've come.

2831
02:39:47,101 --> 02:39:48,537
I am fine.

2832
02:39:52,377 --> 02:39:53,457
What do you see?

2833
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:56,017
First, tell him if it's
a boy or a girl.

2834
02:39:56,242 --> 02:39:57,486
He's the kid Raj.

2835
02:39:59,434 --> 02:40:00,537
Shanti, sister.

2836
02:40:01,457 --> 02:40:03,537
The kindness you've showered on me.

2837
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:10,977
I'll never be able to repay it.

2838
02:40:12,167 --> 02:40:13,697
You're truly a Goddess.

2839
02:40:14,278 --> 02:40:15,457
Sister, Gauri.

2840
02:40:15,777 --> 02:40:17,697
Let me remain, human.

2841
02:40:18,457 --> 02:40:22,698
If ever you pray for me, pray that..

2842
02:40:23,314 --> 02:40:26,457
..I be on the way of justice.

2843
02:40:27,039 --> 02:40:28,804
I become the support for the needy.

2844
02:40:29,515 --> 02:40:30,772
I live for others.

2845
02:40:32,061 --> 02:40:33,222
All right.

2846
02:40:33,774 --> 02:40:34,891
Come, Shanti.

2847
02:40:35,063 --> 02:40:36,263
Ok, Raj.

2848
02:40:43,670 --> 02:40:47,537
"They were together
for a few moments."

2849
02:40:47,993 --> 02:40:53,064
"Were happy and flourishing."

2850
02:40:53,787 --> 02:41:02,541
"Prayed for them and the same
may hold true for us."

2851
02:41:02,845 --> 02:41:06,127
"The time has come."

2852
02:41:06,597 --> 02:41:12,512
"Of taking the leave, we'll go."

2853
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:22,686
"Now, we don't remember anything
except our debts."
