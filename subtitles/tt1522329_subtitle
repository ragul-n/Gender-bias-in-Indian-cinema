00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:10,242
Superhits on 93.5 Red FM.

2
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:12,649
You're with Tarun on
'Mumbai Local'.

3
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,880
And on the evening of 25th July..

4
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:25,363
Tiwari, just play. Let it go. -Why
are your hands trembling?

5
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:26,694
What are you doing? Let it go.

6
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,792
Did you see that? Don't
disturb him.

7
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,167
His hands tremble at the
wrong time. -Oh, no.

8
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,266
Your fluke shot won't
work every time.

9
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,364
lt'll work.

10
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:35,698
Wait. l'll be back.

11
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:37,937
Deshpande, sit down. -Bharat
Patil has said it..

12
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,167
Deshapande, where are
you going? Sit down.

13
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,144
l'm not quitting. Don't
start without me.

14
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,238
l'm going get some water.
-Deshpande, he couldn't wait.

15
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:44,749
He played it. -Pal, can't you
hit where you're aiming it?

16
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,626
Cloud formation looks
little troublesome.

17
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,720
Sir, there's no trouble.
lt happens every year.

18
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,299
But still. Shall l inform
the airport authorities?

19
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,562
Mr. Deshpande, they're not
going to cancel any..

20
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,570
..flight because of your
weather warning.

21
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:07,738
Please come. lt's your turn now.

22
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,105
All right, l'm coming.

23
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,570
Fatso, don't play my
turn. l'm coming.

24
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,483
Wait a second.

25
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,456
Hey, listen. Are you Chinese?

26
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,124
Yes. Yes.

27
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,596
Do you speak English? -No.
English. No problem.

28
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,464
No problem. No problem. -Great.
Great. All right.

29
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:38,800
l've to go to the Heathrow Airport
because l'm getting late.

30
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,203
No problem. No problem.

31
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,138
Do you understand what
am l telling you?

32
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,336
No problem. No problem.

33
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,805
Youm, l'll call you back. Okay?
-All right, listen to me.

34
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,613
Love and romance exist
only in movies, pal.

35
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,183
Don't chase the girl. Ok ay?

36
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,390
l'll call you later.
Okay? Bye. Bye.

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,484
Listen.

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,427
Okay. ls that your son?

39
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,526
He's cute, right?

40
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:10,760
Looks like you.

41
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:17,903
This is my design. Yeah? lt's
free. -lt's for your son.

42
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,374
Yeah. -Thanks a ton.

43
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:21,573
Hi. Go ahead.

44
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:26,312
No. No. lt's for your son. -Keep
it. Keep it. -Break. Break.

45
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,853
Break Signal. -No problem.
No problem.

46
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,445
Yeah. No problem. No problem.

47
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,318
Oh my..

48
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,519
This one.

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,754
Such a..

50
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,732
Akshay?

51
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,302
Sanjana?

52
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,739
What are you doing here?

53
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,313
Same as all the people who've
boarded this flight.

54
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:11,481
Going to Mumbai.

55
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,285
Right. Right.

56
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:23,166
Hi. l'm Rajiv. -Hi.

57
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:33,740
So, how are you, Sanjana?

58
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:41,745
l'm fine, Akshay. And you?

59
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:43,646
Good.

60
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,354
Good. Good. Great.

61
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,651
How's your father?

62
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,292
Father died last year.

63
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:56,926
l'm sorry, Akshay.

64
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,609
Wow, this is amazing.

65
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,745
What were the chances that
we'd run into each other..

66
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,282
..aboard the flight to Mumbai.

67
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:16,219
Actually..l'm moving to Mumbai.

68
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,382
As far as l remember you never
really liked Mumbai.

69
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:23,789
People change, Akshay.

70
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,290
Yeah.

71
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,329
Sorry.

72
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,233
Yes, sir?

73
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,275
Can you shift me to another
seat please?

74
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,870
The only empty seat is
next to you, sir.

75
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,240
l don't mind the Economy one.

76
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,841
l'm so sorry, sir. The
flight is full.

77
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,819
Anything else l can
do for you, sir?

78
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,582
No, it's okay. -Thank
you, sir. -Yeah.

79
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,724
lt's been six years, Akshay.

80
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:57,522
Don't tell me you feel
uncomfortable to sit next to me.

81
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,393
Sanjana, that's not the case.

82
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:08,598
How many done?

83
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,774
No stamina.. This is less.

84
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,539
Who is this?

85
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,244
Who is he? -No one.
Just like that.

86
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,347
Just one big accident.

87
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,154
Give me one.

88
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,692
Pal, let's move.

89
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:11,860
Do you've a spring
in your backside?

90
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,301
Pal, this is Saturday afternoon
and l've no idea..

91
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,570
..why l'm here with you, when
in fact, l should be having..

92
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:23,173
..fun with a beautiful girl on
the only day-off that l get.

93
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,275
Got that? -l'm too busy with
my lousy job as a waiter..

94
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,877
..and my art college
to do anything else.

95
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:32,157
Won't you help me instead of just
sitting there? -Come on, get up.

96
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,683
Canvas. -What do you mean?
You haven't got time?

97
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:39,829
Had l been a painter, l could've
proved it to you.

98
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,701
l always wanted to paint nudes.

99
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,664
l don't understand what kind
of paintings you create.

100
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:49,139
Look around you, pal. You're
surrounded by beauties.

101
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,500
Hold it properly.

102
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,739
Pal, l'm doing it, okay? Why
do you scold me every time?

103
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,680
l'm going to find you a dictator.

104
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,515
Look at her. Will she do?

105
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,490
As the editor of Young Asia,
l demand an explanation.

106
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:08,721
Why haven't they replaced bulbs
used in streetlights..

107
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,160
..by eco-friendly bulbs?

108
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Why haven't they made it mandatory
in the offices..

109
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,858
..to shut down the computers
after the working hours?

110
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,195
l know

111
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,566
Oh, no.

112
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:29,872
Wait. Where are you going?

113
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,509
Come on, anybody.. somebody.
Please help.

114
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:36,485
Just take these leaflets and
keep them out anywhere.

115
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,228
Akshay, hurry up, pal.

116
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:54,397
Oh, God.

117
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,101
This stupid rain ruined
everything.

118
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,301
See the sun has come out now.

119
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,613
Never mind, Sanjana. You
tried, didn't you?

120
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,172
l was setting a mood, Namrata.

121
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,779
l was going to announce the
letter campaign and just..

122
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,452
All right. Something happened.
lt went wrong.

123
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:10,716
But look at it this way.

124
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,620
We've seen the worst.
What can happen now?

125
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:13,852
Right? Come on, smile.

126
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:17,787
Oh, no.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,565
Now. -Now what?

128
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,227
The person who owns this bike
is going to kill us.

129
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:28,169
Let's get away from here. Let's
go. -What do you mean Let's go?

130
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,607
This bike belongs to somebody.
We have to find the owner.

131
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,612
Listen, nobody has seen us yet.
He'll be very angry for sure.

132
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,874
Let's just go. Come on.

133
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,183
Okay. Just give me one second.

134
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:40,843
Oh, God. Now what?

135
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,757
Come on. -Coming.

136
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,254
Just leaving a note.
-Hurry up, girl.

137
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:56,902
We've come 40 kilometres
from Cape Town.

138
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,798
Why? How will we get
back to the city?

139
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,299
We'll see to it.

140
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,234
The bike was in my uncle's
garage for three years.

141
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,305
This takes care of our next
month's rent. Get it?

142
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,779
Stupid.. Whatever.

143
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,880
The party is tight, and
our future's bright.

144
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,911
Just think about it. lf you own
a place here you got to be..

145
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,186
Let's ring the bell.

146
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,427
Excuse me, ma'am. These gentlemen
are here to see you.

147
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,520
Yes

148
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,523
Hitler?

149
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:31,427
Akshay. -Yes.

150
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,936
This note. Sanjana.

151
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,205
My bike suffered scratches.
Are you..

152
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,506
Oh, right. -My driver must've
done that while backing up..

153
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,845
lt was crushing a blow. lt
suffered a heavy damage.

154
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,341
l'm really sorry.

155
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:46,680
No, it wasn't that serious.

156
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,355
l mean, if car hits the bike,
it'll leave some scratches.

157
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,447
Yes.

158
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,950
How much for the damages?
l'll give it right away.

159
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,819
Three and half.. -lt's
not about money.

160
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,857
We can cover that. -What do
you mean we can cover that?

161
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,499
Look, l'm in a crisis right now.

162
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,331
lt's better if you come
straight to the point.

163
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,701
You know, it will save
time for both of us.

164
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,740
Ask for the money straightaway,
we'll just leave.

165
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,834
How about this? Give
me your address.

166
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:14,107
l'll send the driver. l'll
help you to fix the bike.

167
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,670
Total overhaul. Does that work?

168
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:17,807
Total? -Yes.

169
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,152
l'll also pay for the faulty
parts if there are any.

170
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:22,711
Oh, no.

171
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,655
Oh, no.

172
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:02,786
Your cake is wasted.

173
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,764
l really wanted to
make this for dad.

174
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:11,760
May l?

175
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,244
Part-time delivery boy
and full-time..

176
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,682
..artist at your service, ma'am.

177
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,178
Wow.

178
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,155
Listen, you two had to come
so far because of me.

179
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,122
At least, l can drop
you home, right?

180
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:16,464
Yeah, sure. Come. -Let's go.

181
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,815
You came into this
world only for me.

182
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,524
Why do l feel this way?

183
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,832
My life is incomplete
without you.

184
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,528
This thought entered
my mind. -How?

185
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:51,627
How?

186
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:57,174
When you go, l go.

187
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:00,804
When you stop, l stop.

188
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,748
Why is this happening?

189
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:09,884
What started our meetings?

190
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,902
So, you'll make money only
upon your death, right?

191
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,568
What do you mean?

192
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,238
That's what happens to all
the painters, right?

193
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:38,646
Okay. l'm.. not a painter.
l'm an artist.

194
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,112
Sorry.

195
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,620
l experience some weird things
that others don't.

196
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,554
Oh. lntense.

197
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,815
Honest.

198
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,784
Filmy.

199
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:50,686
Poetry.

200
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,221
Really?

201
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:57,364
lf l tell you everything now, l
won't have anything for later.

202
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,701
Oh. Are we meeting again later.

203
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,465
Let me quote.

204
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,439
Some feelings remain unexpressed.

205
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,247
What l don't express,
believe in it.

206
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,345
How did you like that?

207
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,379
Your sense of humour is quite sad.

208
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,346
But it made you laugh, right?

209
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,592
l wasn't laughing at
your jokes, but you.

210
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:30,802
Tell me if you can, why do
l feel like this way?

211
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:37,537
My life was meaningless
till today.

212
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,477
Come, enter my heart.

213
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,443
You become mine.

214
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,449
Don't go away from me.

215
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:53,620
lt's my request to you.

216
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:59,394
We've come closer.

217
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:05,098
As if our soul's one.

218
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,637
This thought entered my
mind. -How? -How?

219
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,732
How?

220
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:18,382
When you go, l go. When
you stop, l stop.

221
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,285
Why is this happening?

222
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:27,486
What started our meetings?

223
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:02,286
Trust me, it's the truth.

224
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,353
You're my happiness.

225
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,164
lf not you, what else do l have?

226
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,768
Don't go away from me.

227
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,669
Don't go away from me.

228
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:19,342
You linger in my eyes.

229
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:23,314
You dwell in my heart.

230
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:27,341
l think of you all the time.

231
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,256
How can l stay away from you?

232
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,549
Okay. Thank you. -Thank you.

233
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:00,778
You guys saved my cake.

234
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,377
The least l can do is drop you.

235
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,579
Yeah.

236
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,316
l hope your dad will
like the food.

237
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,115
You've worked so hard for it.

238
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:08,683
He's definitely going to like it.

239
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:11,457
He comes over once in a
month, only for a day.

240
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,721
He won't criticise
the meal. -Okay.

241
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,860
Anyways, thank you.

242
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:18,827
No problem.

243
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,869
Okay. Bye. -Bye.

244
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,101
Will your uncle take her number?

245
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:30,876
l was thinking.. l was wondering..
you know if you can..

246
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,647
You want my phone number?

247
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,512
l mean..Yeah. -Sure.

248
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:41,683
Give me your hand.

249
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,236
My card.

250
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,269
lt was nice doing business
with you.

251
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:58,867
Call me.

252
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:04,841
Call her. -No.

253
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,282
Call her. Call her. -Have
you gone crazy?

254
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:09,617
Call her. -l've met her just once.
-And have you seen her house?

255
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,185
Call her.

256
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:14,650
No, forget it.

257
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:16,821
Call her.

258
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:20,924
Buddy, l was just thinking..

259
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,864
..if that girl has a sister, then
set me up with her, please.

260
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,440
lf she doesn't have a sister..

261
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:33,444
..then any of her single
aunts will do.

262
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,238
Will you shut up?

263
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:47,355
Jungle rule. -What?

264
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,792
Look, according to the
law of the jungle..

265
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,228
..the lion goes after the lioness.

266
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,560
Look, switch off the lights.

267
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,527
l've to get up early
in the morning.

268
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:56,725
But Akki..

269
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,144
Alright. How does it matter to me?

270
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,706
Don't call her.

271
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,351
God helps those those
who help themselves.

272
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:16,617
Oh god, you broke my jaw.

273
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,193
Hi Sanjana, Akshay here.

274
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,824
Hi.

275
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:07,363
You know l was thinking that if
you're free tomorrow night..

276
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,797
l mean if you're free
tonight then..

277
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:12,739
You know we could..

278
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,405
l was thinking that..that..

279
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,844
Oh no.

280
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,399
Hello.

281
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,411
Sanjana. Akshay here.

282
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,503
How are you?

283
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:49,905

284
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,476
Akshay.

285
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,323

day in your house.

286
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,522
ln my house?

287
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:06,122
Sanjana, l'm Akshay.

288
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,127
l hadn't thought that
you'd be so simple.

289
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,196
Oh, l get it. Okay.

290
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,404
This means you're thinking
about me.

291
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:18,838
Oh, sorry. l made a mistake.

292
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,277
No, keep doing such mistakes.
lt's very good.

293
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,205
Yes. So..

294
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:27,112
So?

295
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,478
You want to go out for coffee,
dinner or something?

296
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,214
Yes, sure.

297
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,225
Hey, listen, what are you
doing in the evening?

298
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,159
ln the evening? -Yes.
Why? is it too soon?

299
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,329
No, l mean it's already 6.00pm.

300
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,259
ln the evening means

00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,797
Tell me. Say about 10:00pm?

302

Oh. l've some work at 10:00pm.

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,564
At least try.

304
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,542
Okay. Okay. Fine. Okay. Okay.

305
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,902
Great. l'll be leaving
my house at 10:00pm.

00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,580
So you come there.
There's a party.

Alright. l'll see you at 10:00pm.

00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:09,791
Shall we work? Deliveries.

Hi.. Eaine Smith? -Oh, pizza.

311
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,208
Are you Eaine Smith?
-10.. 10, 20..

312
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,771
Are you Eaine Smith?

00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,352
40, 42..

314
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,682
Eaine Smith?

315
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,219
How much l should give?

316
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,416
60?

317
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,287
Shut up, will you?

318
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,191
Oh no!

319
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,927
Don't irritate me. You'll
make me forget.

320
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:28,239
Sanjana? You, here?

321
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,568
What did you think? You'll
be let off so easily?

322
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:36,371
But..

323
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,774
Excuse me. Here.

324
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,521
Jacket. -Jacket?

325
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:49,818
Take it off.

326
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:54,456
Thank you.

327
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,296
Coat? -Come on.

328
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,162
Okay.

329
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:10,272
Perfect.

330
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:11,673
Okay. Come.

331
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,652
Why does everyone give a
fake smile over here?

332
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:21,784
l mean, seriously.

333
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,491
Does anyone laugh
freely over here?

334
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,591
l thought you're an
aspiring artist.

335
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,803
So perhaps you'll get some
contacts amidst them.

336
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:36,168
You know, for future. -Oh yes.

337
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,875
Oh definitely. -You could pick
up two or three of his works.

338
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,806
A long term investment. -What
l suggest is that.. -Like it?

339
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,506
Well, that's a great idea.

340
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:43,673
Because that will be..

341
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,377
lt's a bit of a show-off.

342
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:51,112
This show-off painting
fetched a high..

343
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,713
..price in yesterday's auction.

344
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,192
Hello, sir. How are you?

345
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:57,652
Hi, Sanjana.

346
00:26:58,597 --> 00:26:59,757
Your papa didn't come?

347
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,794
No, he was going to come,
but you know..

348
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,701
lt too perfect for
abstract painting.

349
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:08,800
Textbook. -Looks like a textbook
was opened on the side..

350
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:12,503
..when it was painted. -l wonder
who will invest in it. Right?

351
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,303
Well..

352
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,142
l bought this painting.

353
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,483
Did you try the starters?

354
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:25,784
They're really very good.

355
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,848
Your friend, what does he do?

356
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:31,590
Sorry. He's Mr. Oberoi.
He's an art dealer.

357
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:35,224
This is Akshay, an artist. -Hello.
-Akshay. -Oh. Well, well.

358
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,461
So what kind of art do you do?

359
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:41,864
The truth. -The truth?

360
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:43,698
Yes.

361
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,606
l find the truth with my art.

362
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:48,870
The truth?

363
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:54,743
So how? l mean through paintings,
sculptures? What?

364
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,482
l don't know. Whatever
l feel like.

365
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,254
An art which reaches the
heart of a common man.

366
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,855
Unfortunately a common man will..

367
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,257
..never be able to pay the right
price for your paintings.

368
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,657
lf you want to make money then..

369
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:13,827
..make art for special people and
not for the common man, Son.

370
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,471
The thrones of kings stand on the
shoulders of the common man.

371
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,607
You must have heard about it.

372
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:26,275
Well, young man, all the best for
your art and your business.

373
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:28,510
Thank you. -Bye.

374
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:30,381
Shall we? -Sure.

375
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:31,479
Please.

376
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,628
lt's a little difficult to
breathe in here, right?

377
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:43,327
Bike ride? -Bike ride?

378
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,303
Oh, don't worry. l won't
take you for free.

379
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,367
l'll send the bill
to your residence.

380
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:49,597
Okay.

381
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:54,142
Okay. Driver, get the bike.

382
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,703
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:08,723
Come around.

384
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,295
lt's time to baby, come around.

385
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,393
Come on now, come around.

386
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:19,528
lt's time to baby, come around.

387
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:22,404
Come around. Come around.

388
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:27,707
My eyes were dreamless.

389
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:34,619
There was no one. My
life was lonely.

390
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,150
Oh yes.

391
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,889
l was quiet.

392
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:42,793
There wasn'thing to say.

393
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:50,191
There was no one. My
life was lonely.

394
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:55,469
l found you and l got the world.

395
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,169
l found you and every
moment seems new.

396
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:04,409
l found you and l got distant
from everyone.

397
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:10,451
l found you and the
magic spread.

398
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:14,253
l found you and l
learnt to live.

399
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:20,731
l found you and l found God.

400
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,824
Thank you.

401
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:24,692
Thank you for what?

402
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:27,938
l hope you're not too sleepy.

403
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,367
l can't sleep at night.

404
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:31,432
Okay.

405
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,701
Born insomniac.

406
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,210
lt's impossible for me to sleep
without sleeping pills.

407
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:43,277
Akshay. l can't remember the
last time l laughed so much.

408
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:47,649
Okay. Now you've started liking
my sense of humour.

409
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:50,318
Yes.

410
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,423
Come around. Come around.

411
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:57,730
My love was asleep.

412
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:04,575
There was fragrance in the air
but l'd never felt them.

413
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:12,840
l wonder where gardens were
flourishing for me.

414
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:19,590
There was fragrance in the air
but l'd never felt them.

415
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:25,424
l found you and the rains
smelt wonderful.

416
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:29,228
l found you and my desires
came alive.

417
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:34,864
l found you and my life
is full of colours.

418
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,337

magic spread.

419
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:44,178

learnt to live.

420
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:50,882
l found you and l found God.

421
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:57,393
These, are the best kebabs ever.

422
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:03,697
Best kebabs.. Kareem's, Delhi.

423
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,427

My turn. -Yes.

425
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,770
Best drink. -Beer.

426
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:18,542
Best film. -'Sholay'.

427
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:22,310
Haven't seen it.

428
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,354
You haven't seen 'Sholay'?

429
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,916
How is that possible?

430
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:28,216
Come on!

431
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:32,927
You heard my prayers.

432
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:36,596
You heard my pleas.

433
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:41,765
What more can l ask from you?

434
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:47,840
l'm incomplete without you.

435
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:51,645
You complete me.

l found you and l lost my heart.

444
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:50,534
l found you and l

Shut up. l'm happily

505
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,196

No, man.

507
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,399
lf l wouldn't have said that
you're dropping me..

508
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,863
..then things would've gotten
awkward unnecessarily.

509
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:24,665
He's cute.

510
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,701
How come you never mention
him earlier?

511
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,239
Because there isn'thing
to mention.

512
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,638
Okay.

513
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:33,784

..you gave when you saw him, l
feel there is a lot to mention.

515
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:39,121
Please Rajiv, there's
nothing of that sort.

516
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,215

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,465
Shall we? -Let's go.
-Hurry up. Let's go.

531
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:15,814
So, tell me, are you planning
to be single..

532
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,445
..or have you found a girl?

533
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:18,847
Do you've a lighter?

534
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:20,754
Don't smoke. You'll die.

535
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,226
l'll quit smoking tomorrow.
Give me a lighter.

536
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:26,228
Moni doesn't like smoking.
l don't have a lighter.

537
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,927
You're such a coward.

538
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,327
She's my wife. lt's my
duty to be a coward.

539
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:41,572
l met Sanjana on the flight.

540
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,375
Sanjana? On the plane?

541
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,683
Yes. She was on the
seat next to me.

542
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,153
Are you okay?

543
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:58,458
Yes, l'm okay. What's
wrong with me?

544
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,533
Look, it's fine if she met
you or spoke to you.

545
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,838
But it's not right to
think about her now.

546
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,437
Because she isn't thinking
about you.

547
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:23,382
Will you keep frowning
the whole day?

548
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,219
Come on, let's go out..
-You please shut up!

549
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:32,828
l'd gone crazy. l wonder
what was wrong with me.

550
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,624
l mean, everything was in
front of me, but still..

551
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:41,629
What?

552
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:49,737
Akshay, someone's here to see you.

553
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:04,524
Look, l.. -Listen, it's okay.
lt's my fault, you know.

554
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:06,753
l don't know what l
was thinking. l..

555
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,525
No, Akshay. lt's my fault.

556
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,701
l didn't tell you that
l've a boyfriend.

557
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:19,434
But..look, l didn't know
that we'd kiss and..

558
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,244
lt's not that simple. -No,
it's very simple.

559
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,907
Sanjana, you go your way
and l'll go mine.

560
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,915
Forget whatever happened.
Just forget it. Okay?

561
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:38,227
We do love each other.
-l know that.

562
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:45,558
No..l mean..my boyfriend and l.

563
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,835
He works with papa and..
l don't know. l just..

564
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,639
Sanjana, l've nothing to do..

565
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:57,274
..with what's happening
in your life.

566
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:07,481
Okay, just tell me that..you
didn't feel anything between us.

567
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:14,426
No, l didn't feel anything.

568
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,323
And there's nothing between us.

569
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:19,195
Now, if you can please excuse me..

570
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,564
..l've some work to do.

571
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:23,903
All right? l've to go. Bye.

572
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,513
Sanjana.

573
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:44,785
lt's me.

574
00:44:46,764 --> 00:44:48,459
Sorry. -Some wine?

575
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,725
Sure.

576
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,377
How are you?

577
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:07,810
What? -Nothing.

578
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:17,558
l know. ln the last one year..

579
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:21,623
..l mustn't even have asked
you how you're doing.

580
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:33,243
Sanjana, l was thinking..

581
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:41,351
You and me. l'm sorry, but..

582
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:45,545
..l don't think it's..l don't
think it's working out.

583
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:49,682
l know we're family friends.

584
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:52,660
l'll speak to your dad as well.

585
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,360
But l think it's better
to be friends than..

586
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,863
What?

587
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:12,109
Nothing. Just that..if you
hadn't said this today..

588
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,678
..then perhaps l'd have said
the same to you tomorrow.

589
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:26,655
Yesterday, that boy.. He hadn't
come to give the change.

590
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:30,858
l'm sorry.

591
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:33,861
Do you love him?

592
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:43,171
Good morning, everybody. Welcome
to your final assessment.

593
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,215
This morning, you're working
with a live model..

594
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:46,840
..in the medium of your choice.

595
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:49,809
You've three hours in
which to complete.

596
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:53,254
So good luck. And please
welcome Ms. Jessica.

597
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:57,251
Hi.

598
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,808
Ma'am, this isn't Jessica.
This isn't her.

599
00:47:19,216 --> 00:47:20,513
Do you've a problem, Akshay?

600
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:30,517
No. -Will you proceed,
then? Please.

601
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,127
You're the reality.
You're the dream.

602
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:21,337
You're the river. You're
the thirst.

603
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:27,105
You're the restlessness.
You're the satisfaction.

604
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:28,838
You're the satisfaction.

605
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:36,843
Wherever l go, l find you.

606
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:42,889
Whether you're with me or not,
you're always close to me.

607
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,718
You're always close to me.

608
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:48,731
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

609
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,235
You're my beloved.

610
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:56,672
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

611
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,732
You're my beloved.

612
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:08,751
Oh, no. l'm late. l've to go.

613
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:11,912
Come here.

614
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,419
Let's get our own place. -What?

615
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:20,823
Let's get our own place. -Really?

616
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,893
What? l bet you, Akshay.

617
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:25,658
Moving in with her is a bad idea.

618
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:27,294
l'm telling you, she's
really nice.

619
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:31,637
She's a princess. You can't afford
the rent of your own house.

620
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,301
How will you buy a house for her?

621
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:35,738
You're a painter. You're not
a Wall Street broker.

622
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:38,513
Trust me on this. You'll
have problems.

623
00:50:54,498 --> 00:51:01,836
l want to embrace you and bring
you even closer to me.

624
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:09,712
When you go away from me, every
moment seems strange.

625
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:17,779
No one in this world must
be as fortunate as l am.

626
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:25,751
You've loved me. l'm
the closest to you.

627
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:29,731
l reside in your heart.

628
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,896
l reside in every
breath of yours.

629
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:39,576
l reside in every heartbeat
of yours.

630
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,338
Every heartbeat of yours.

631
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:45,576
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

632
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:49,176
You're my beloved.

633
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:53,212
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

634
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,919
You're my beloved.

635
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:29,320
l don't realise when the
time passes these days.

636
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:37,156
Since l've found you,
l'm not in my senses.

637
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:45,408
The shade of your eyelids
is soothing.

638
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:49,242
l'm not scared of
the sunlight now.

639
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:52,878
They protect me.

640
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:57,214
l can't breathe without you.

641
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,890
l can't live without you.

642
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:08,898
l can't live without you
for even a moment.

643
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:13,267
You're the reality.
You're the dream.

644
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:17,205
You're the river. You're
the thirst.

645
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:22,803
You're the restlessness.
You're the satisfaction.

646
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:24,871
You're the satisfaction.

647
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:28,448
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

648
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,114
You're my beloved.

649
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:36,858
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

650
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:39,896
You're my beloved.

651
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:44,299
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

652
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:47,860
You're my beloved.

653
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:52,171
You're my associate.
You're my companion.

654
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,700
You're my beloved.

655
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:58,339
What are you doing? -This is
an important day for you.

656
00:53:58,615 --> 00:53:59,843
You've to look good. -Okay.

657
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:02,515
Here you go. -Can l go? -Yes.

658
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,611
Okay. -Good luck. -Thank you.

659
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:07,383
Your work is really good.

660
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:09,583
All you need to do is get it
approved by a curator..

661
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,184
..and the scholarship is yours.

662
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:12,752
Thank you. -Sure.

663
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:30,670
Yes?

664
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:34,373
Have we met..

665
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:40,717
Freelance artist.

666
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:47,488
Strange. You know, l was very
curious to find out..

667
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:49,862
..whom the college has
recommended this time.

668
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:53,732
l mean, it's good exposure.
Not to mention the money.

669
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:56,396
Yes.

670
00:54:56,673 --> 00:54:59,198
So, have you brought your work?

671
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,872
Yes. -Okay, then, let's see.

672
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:05,474
l'm sure l'll like it.

673
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:09,409
Perfect.

674
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,554
Too perfect. Textbook.

675
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:28,169
Too dark. The intensity
is missing.

676
00:55:29,373 --> 00:55:32,274
The colour pallet is.. -l know
it's not about the painting.

677
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:35,473
You've a problem with me.

678
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:38,743
You're scared of my courage.

679
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:42,716
lnteresting. -You'll never
approve this painting.

680
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:45,778
Not because it's good or bad..

681
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:48,716
..but because it's beyond
your understanding.

682
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:49,816
Ouch.

683
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:54,859
So, before you reject
me, l reject you.

684
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:57,692
Thanks, but no thanks.

685
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:01,067
Okay. As you wish.

686
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:08,337
l'll write to your school that
you didn't like our gallery.

687
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,872
Suit yourself. And your mind.

688
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:20,414
You know a lot about art, but
in business, my friend..

689
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:23,559
..you won't go too far.

690
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:28,795
Now, don't wear that long face.

691
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,192
You should've come up with
some line to impress him.

692
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:34,863
Like they say, ready answers.

693
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:40,140
What did he say? You won't go
too far in the business.

694
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:42,277
l'll buy my own gallery one day.

695
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:46,577
lt'll be a little difficult
to reject that gallery.

696
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,275
No, seriously.

697
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,616
You know, even my dad
was an artist.

698
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:57,116
When l was a child, he'd
held an art exhibition..

699
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:59,253
..in Mumbai's Taj gallery

700
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,395
But, the gallery owner
gave him a raw deal.

701
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:06,796
My dad got nothing and the gallery
owner bough a big car.

702
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:11,602
Even today, my dad
travels by train.

703
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:16,836
And l'd promised him that l'll
buy my own gallery one day.

704
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:19,239
Darn it.

705
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:21,546
Why did that idiot have
to be the curator?

706
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:23,109
lt happens.

707
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:24,647
Come. Your chance.

708
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:27,179
You want me to talk to papa?

709
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:28,848
lt's more than enough
for your dad..

710
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:31,253
..to take some time out for
normal conversations.

711
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:33,423
l've to do this on my own.

712
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:37,264
lf in the future, l can manage
to avoid people like Oberoi..

713
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:38,733
..it'll be a tad easier for me.

714
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:42,663
Let that idiot remain there.
You're going places.

715
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:46,335
For the time being,
l'm in your city.

716
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:50,304
Fifty dollars please.

717
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,582
lt's a little more than that.

718
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:58,916
What do you mean? -This
month's rent.

719
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:01,756
l don't even have that much money.

720
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:04,659
lt doesn't matter. l'm
here, aren't l?

721
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:07,427
l'll pay this month's rent.
You can pay me back later.

722
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:11,533
ln cash, or in kind.

723
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,272
Yes. l'll call you
right away, sir.

724
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:27,107
Yes. Yes, please,
sir. Please, sir.

725
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:28,875
My God.

726
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,452
lt's not an ordinary thing.

727
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:37,684
l've never seen so many clouds
in all these years.

728
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:43,432
lt's as if a sea is lurking
behind these clouds.

729
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:48,294
Sir, we have to send. -No.

730
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,204
The horse has bolted
out of the stable.

731
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:03,820
Many people are stuck there..

732
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,579
Many people have..
-What's happening?

733
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:07,782
Many houses are filled with water.

734
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,792
Where's Mr. Das? -He
must be on his way.

735
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,555
Maybe, he's caught in
traffic or something.

736
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:13,653
They'll be closing this coffee
shop at 12 o'clock.

737
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,493
How long will it take for Mr. Das?

738
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:18,193
Sir, you're lucky. His property
is very prime.

739
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:19,694
l know that property.

740
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,831
He's coming to lndia
just for a day.

741
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:25,835
Especially for this deal.

742
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:28,303
l think you should be thankful
to him when he comes.

743
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:29,470
First, let him come.

744
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,207
lt's devastation throughout
the city of Mumbai.

745
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:32,475
So, tell me. -Lokhandwala.

746
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:37,480
Let's see the condition this
rain has left this city in.

747
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:39,818
Our colleague Umesh Kumawat
will be telling us.

748
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,321
Right now, we're in the
Kurla area of Mumbai.

749
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,383
And, let me tell you that the
condition of the city..

750
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:46,554
..continues to worsen by
this heavy downpour.

751
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:49,094
You can see the difficulties
the vehicles are facing..

752
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:51,656
..because of this heavy rain.

753
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:53,893
Vehicles are moving but traffic
is jammed because..

754
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:58,130
..The roads are completely
flooded.

755
00:59:58,408 --> 00:59:59,841
Speaking of regions in Mumbai..

756
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,707
..Chembur and Kurla are flooded.

757
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:05,305
Parel especially has been the
worst hit by this rain.

758
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:07,741
The way it's raining since
this afternoon..

759
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,614
..roads are heavily flooded.
And, it's affecting..

760
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:12,348
..the movement of the
vehicles as a result.

761
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:14,352
People are unable to
reach their homes..

762
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:17,655
..and are trying to
walk till home.

763
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,853
Even the fire department are
trying to reach the spots..

764
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:22,455
..where people are trapped.

765
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:24,159
Because, the prime objective
of the administration now..

766
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:25,531
..is to save people.

767
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:27,669
Railway tracks, too, are flooded.

768
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,602
So, people are walking
on those tracks..

769
01:00:29,673 --> 01:00:31,402
..and are trying to reach home.

770
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:33,567
Because, trains have come
to a complete halt.

771
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:35,509
Since, trains aren't running..

772
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:45,613
Excuse me..

773
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,714
Akshay.

774
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:53,786
What's the matter? -l don't know,
ma'am, what's going on.

775
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:57,198
Why don't you take a look?
-l'll take a look, ma'am.

776
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,633
Akshay, are you out of your
mind? Where are you going?

777
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:06,733
To Sanjana.

778
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,508
Akshay, just wait.

779
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:10,910
Just wait. At least listen to me.

780
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:12,171
Look.

781
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:14,807
ln the night, even if
the tap leaked..

782
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:17,377
She.. She couldn't sleep.

783
01:01:19,622 --> 01:01:21,647
l've to go. She must
be in trouble.

784
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:24,626
So, even l'm in trouble. The
whole city's in trouble.

785
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:25,922
Who else will you save?

786
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:27,857
Are you forgetting why we're here?

787
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:34,135
Akshay.. Akshay, you're doing
this for your dad.

788
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:41,271
l'm sorry. l've to help
her. l'm sorry.

789
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:58,854
..reached home.. am safe

790
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:53,340
Stop. Help. Help! Please!

791
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:15,598
Stop. Help. Help! Please!

792
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,436
Please..Please. Stop.

793
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:30,285
Help me. Somebody.. Help me!

794
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:31,581
Help.

795
01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:33,121
Stop!

796
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:57,404
Darn it.

797
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:40,515
Sanjana.

798
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:50,816
Mama.

799
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:54,889
Mama. Mama.

800
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:58,591
Mama.

801
01:06:12,382 --> 01:06:13,474
Where's your mother?

802
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:18,511
Let's go from here.

803
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:33,662
Hail Lord Ganesha.

804
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:40,640
Everything all right inside?

805
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,604
Naina.

806
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:47,740
Naina.

807
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:50,112
Naina.

808
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:54,719
Have you seen my wife?
Red t-shirt?

809
01:06:56,492 --> 01:06:57,516
Naina.

810
01:06:58,494 --> 01:06:59,518
Naina.

811
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:02,121
Naina.

812
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,338
He found the girl.

813
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,258
With you, on camps

814
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:38,457
l don't know.

815
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,531
l've to go, okay? l'll
see you later.

816
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:50,645
Can l say something? -Yes.

817
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:55,813
Forget it. -Tell me.

818
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:00,548
Papa had called. He wants to meet.

819
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:04,054
l made the dinner plans
for the 25th.

820
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:06,286
You're free, right?

821
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,292
l'm all free. l'm not
doing anything.

822
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,167
Didn't mean it like that.

823
01:08:17,206 --> 01:08:19,470
lt's been three months since
l made a painting.

824
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:22,469
l'm just so busy doing nothing.

825
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:26,540
Don't talk nonsense.

826
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,378
Just a little. Concentrate just
a little more in your work.

827
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:32,846
Mark my words. Everything
will be fine.

828
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,486
l'll see you later, okay? -Yes.

829
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:39,518
Bye.

830
01:08:39,896 --> 01:08:42,592
We have to pay the power bill.
And waterworks, too.

831
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:44,132
l'm leaving the money here.

832
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:50,763
Yes, Mom?

833
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:58,170
Okay.

834
01:09:00,783 --> 01:09:01,807
Okay, okay.

835
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:06,545
Bye..Bye.

836
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:08,648
What's the matter?

837
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,692
Father's again fallen ill.

838
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:21,160
He's in an lCU.

839
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:29,705
l've to send money home.

840
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,179
l'm so sorry, Akshay. Do you
want me to stay here?

841
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:36,784
Leave me alone for
a while, please.

842
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:42,181
Please.

843
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,519
Sure. l understand.

844
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:50,458
Call me later, okay? -Okay.

845
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:44,577
Hello?

846
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:48,283
Hello? Akshay. Are you all right?

847
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,816
How's papa? -He's well.
-He's..He's.. okay. He's okay.

848
01:10:51,894 --> 01:10:54,192
He's out of the lCU, but he's
still in the hospital.

849
01:10:54,564 --> 01:10:56,498
Listen. Do you need some money?

850
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:59,330
l can get papa.. -Hey, l don't
want your money. -l'll arrange.

851
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,148
Listen, l'm sorry. -lt's okay.

852
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,374
l love you.

853
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:23,581
Love you, too. Bye.

854
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:53,646
Court or temple?

855
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:55,819
We're not getting married.

856
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,154
Fine. But, just believe that
you're for a second. Then?

857
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:05,526
l..l don't even know if he
believes in God or not, you know.

858
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:07,193
What do you mean, l don't know?

859
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,837
l don't know means l don't know.

860
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:10,229
What do you mean?

861
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,632
He doesn't talk much.

862
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:14,875
Does he ever talk about himself..

863
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:16,510
..or is it only you who
does the talking?

864
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:18,706
Careful, okay? Just hope
he's not Batman.

865
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,515
So, there's your Batman.

866
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:28,917
l'll see you. -Bye.

867
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,223
Hey.

868
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,207
What happened, Akshay?

869
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:53,646
Why didn't you come upstairs?

870
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:56,375
Can we go?

871
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,455
Akshay. Power bill?

872
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,798
l'm sorry. l forgot.

873
01:13:14,637 --> 01:13:16,298
l'll pay it. Wait.

874
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:17,896
One second. Just one second.

875
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,643
How come you've a lighter?

876
01:13:29,652 --> 01:13:30,676
Darn it.

877
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:33,346
You smoke cigarettes,
don't you? -No.

878
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:38,120
Maybe one.

879
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:40,888
Akshay.

880
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:58,436
Why did you lie to me, Akshay?

881
01:13:59,782 --> 01:14:02,250
lt did occur to me. But l felt
you'd definitely tell me..

882
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:03,683
..if you were really smoking.

883
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:07,315
Why..don't you tell
me anything, ever?

884
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,721
l'm not going to eat you up.

885
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:12,857
l'll give up smoking,
okay? -Really?

886
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:20,459
Liar.

887
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:42,618
What's going on, Akshay?
l never know..

888
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:44,318
..what's going on in your mind.

889
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,194
You never say anything.

890
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:52,197
You're my boyfriend, Akshay,
not my roommate.

891
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:58,799
Sanjana, it's been so many months
since l made a painting.

892
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,110
l don't even have money.

893
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,370
l'm unable to keep you happy.

894
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:08,746
l mean.. So, what's the point?

895
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:12,218
What's the point of what?

896
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:24,232
Akshay.. -Be seated like that.
Be seated like that.

897
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:30,496
Sit right here.

898
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:40,374
This heart's revering. Listen
to these heartbeats.

899
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:45,177
l'm obsessed with winning you.

900
01:15:47,523 --> 01:15:52,483
Let me pick some beautiful
moments from the boughs of life.

901
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:57,356
l'm obsessed with winning you.

902
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:17,312
This heart's revering. Listen
to these heartbeats.

903
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:21,784
l'm obsessed with winning you.

904
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:29,423
Let me pick some beautiful
moments from the boughs of life.

905
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:33,894
l'm obsessed with winning you.

906
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:42,310
The moments l live, l want
to live them with you.

907
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:48,283
'Whatever tomorrow holds for me,
l want to live it with you.

908
01:16:48,617 --> 01:16:54,385
The breaths l take, l want
to take them with you.

909
01:16:54,657 --> 01:17:00,459
Whatever may be the path, l
want to tread it with you.

910
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:06,267
This heart's revering. Listen
to these heartbeats.

911
01:17:06,635 --> 01:17:11,163
l'm obsessed with winning you.

912
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:53,507
Let me cease to exist.

913
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:56,908
Let me become one with myself.

914
01:17:57,152 --> 01:18:00,781
Why is there this distance?

915
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:05,686
These moments would
never return.

916
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:09,163
Don't let them fly by.

917
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:13,190
Lose yourself in me.

918
01:18:14,536 --> 01:18:17,300
Let me break you apart
from yourself.

919
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:20,436
Let me seam you with myself.

920
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:26,478
Let me envelope my body,
my soul with your scent.

921
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:32,585
The breaths l take, l want
to take them with you.

922
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:39,322
Whatever may be the path, l
want to tread it with you.

923
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:44,555
This heart's revering. Listen
to these heartbeats.

924
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:50,169
l'm obsessed with winning you.

925
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,245
Good morning. -Good morning.

926
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:10,145
ls the power back on?
-Yes. The bell rang.

927
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:13,851
l wanted to check the meter.

928
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:15,145
Yes, come in. -Okay.

929
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:22,493
Ms. Sanjana, your article
in the October issue..

930
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:24,598
..is about the environment.

931
01:20:26,234 --> 01:20:29,829
Actually, l thought..

932
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:35,633
l'm sorry.

933
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:39,471
No, we like this. We
really like this.

934
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,178
We want to make you an offer.

935
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:45,876
Chief Editor of the
Youth magazine.

936
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:48,185
You'll get a team under you.

937
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,857
What do you think about London?

938
01:20:57,032 --> 01:20:58,056
Amazing!

939
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:05,936
Wonderful. -Amazing?

940
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:08,700
Yes, of course.

941
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:13,511
l feel as if you took reality
in your hands..

942
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:15,982
..and just weaved it on paper.

943
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:18,543
You've a bulb.

944
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,078
A fused bulb.

945
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:24,523
Just like practical life, broken.

946
01:21:26,027 --> 01:21:27,517
And look at the moon.

947
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,854
A melting moon.

948
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:31,055
Great.

949
01:21:31,132 --> 01:21:33,066
lt means the night has
come to a stand still.

950
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:34,659
Great. Amazing.

951
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:35,828
That's it, isn't it?

952
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,067
Now this girl.

953
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:45,512
Sir, you've painted this
girl very beautifully.

954
01:21:46,915 --> 01:21:48,075
She looks like a fairy.

955
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,844
Exactly like a fairy.

956
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:52,679
Her eyes..

957
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:57,491
Her eyes.. -Eyes?

958
01:21:58,493 --> 01:22:00,518
Her eyes look sad.

959
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:03,862
She's trying to say something.

960
01:22:04,766 --> 01:22:07,860
She wants someone to come
and take her in his arms.

961
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:09,834
Right. That's it.

962
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,673
l guess l overdid it.

963
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,807
But sir, l just expressed
what l felt.

964
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:24,075
You see, it's an ordinary opinion
of an ordinary man.

965
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:26,911
No.

966
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:29,487
An ordinary man's opinion
can't be ordinary.

967
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:34,461
Congratulations. -Thank you.

968
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,928
Congratulations. -Thank you so
much. -You'll enjoy it there.

969
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:44,463
l'll just be back. -Cool.
-l'll see you guys.

970
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:46,029
See you. Bye. -Bye. -Goodbye.

971
01:22:46,107 --> 01:22:47,131
Goodbye.

972
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:51,804
Akshay, you won't.. -Sanjana,
you won't believe this.

973
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,040
This is my best painting. -But..

974
01:22:53,114 --> 01:22:55,548
l've been trying since many days
and last night it just..

975
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:00,011
Thank you.

976
01:23:01,656 --> 01:23:03,021
This is a new beginning for me.

977
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:19,632
You shouldn't do that.

978
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,139
Mama! Mama!

979
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:23,935
Yuvi!

980
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:35,880
Akshay!

981
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:41,152
Akshay!

982
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:59,071
Sanjana. -Akshay.

983
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:05,785
Here you are. Another Romeo
has found his.. Keep at it.

984
01:24:17,932 --> 01:24:19,160
How did you land up here?

985
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,970
Actually, our car broke down.

986
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:28,472
And we were going towards
the hotel.

987
01:24:28,943 --> 01:24:30,171
Are you dumbstruck?

988
01:24:31,112 --> 01:24:32,136
Hey.

989
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:34,605
Good to see you.

990
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:35,873
Vic.

991
01:24:36,217 --> 01:24:37,411
Sorry.

992
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:43,014
l'm sorry, Vic.

993
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:45,154
l'm just a little shocked.

994
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:48,022
Six years have passed
and today suddenly..

995
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:49,563
..we meet twice in a day.

996
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:53,163
First in a plane and now in a bus.

997
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:56,026
lf this continues, we should
be in a boat in a while.

998
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,565
Don't smile. l know
it was a bad joke.

999
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:08,610
Are you calling for
a helicopter now?

1000
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:10,844
No, buddy. l'm calling my
wife. She'll scold me.

1001
01:25:10,919 --> 01:25:11,977
You're married, Vic?

1002
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:14,584
Yes. lt also surprises me.

1003
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:17,924
l think we should go
towards the hotel.

1004
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:21,821
Right? -Yes, you're
right. Come on.

1005
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,188
Yes. Come on. -Let's go.

1006
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:27,058
Come.

1007
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:41,806
Come on.

1008
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:44,509
Come on, Sanjana.

1009
01:25:45,587 --> 01:25:47,953
l can't go. l'm scared.

1010
01:25:49,624 --> 01:25:50,648
l can't go.

1011
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,199
We'll wait till the water recedes.

1012
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:02,727
Okay?

1013
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,564
Relax.

1014
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:13,838
Thanks.

1015
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,112
Grandma, the lights went out.

1016
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:27,888
Let's have tea at least.

1017
01:26:28,596 --> 01:26:29,824
Here. Have a cup of tea.

1018
01:26:30,165 --> 01:26:31,189
Thank you.

1019
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:34,532
Ma'am, you too have it.

1020
01:26:37,071 --> 01:26:38,095
Best tea?

1021
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,532
l'm sure this tea would beat
the one at your campus.

1022
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:53,612
So, will you start something new?

1023
01:26:55,723 --> 01:26:58,692
Yes, l'd come here
to buy a gallery.

1024
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:01,152
Gallery?

1025
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,554
Das Gallery.

1026
01:27:05,533 --> 01:27:06,557
Das.

1027
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:09,633
Your dad's? -Yes.

1028
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:11,996
Great.

1029
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:14,806
Congratulations. -Thanks.

1030
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,173
You always used to say that..

1031
01:27:17,912 --> 01:27:19,937
But l don't think the deal
would be possible now.

1032
01:27:20,648 --> 01:27:21,672
Why?

1033
01:27:23,418 --> 01:27:25,716
But as per the law l should
be over there, not here.

1034
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:28,715
But l never followed the law.

1035
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:38,863
Come on, Akshay, don't
mimic movie dialogues.

1036
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:45,803
But you're smiling. lt means
you like my movie dialogues.

1037
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:51,976
l've told you before. l smile at
you, not at your jokes. -Oh.

1038
01:28:03,091 --> 01:28:04,149
Akshay. -Yes?

1039
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:11,157
Did your car really break down?

1040
01:28:15,803 --> 01:28:17,532
You want me to tell
the truth or lie?

1041
01:28:18,172 --> 01:28:21,369
Had you told the truth earlier,
l wouldn't have asked.

1042
01:28:22,744 --> 01:28:24,439
Had l learnt to lie before this..

1043
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:26,070
..things would've been different.

1044
01:28:31,185 --> 01:28:32,482
What do you say, Ria?

1045
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:45,957
Well, it's nice.

1046
01:28:47,502 --> 01:28:48,526
Okay.

1047
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,005
But something's missing.

1048
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:55,001
Let's order some food.

1049
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:56,567
No, really.

1050
01:28:56,911 --> 01:29:00,608
l mean had this been in some
other mood base colour..

1051
01:29:01,149 --> 01:29:03,174
..it would suit with the look
of my house very well.

1052
01:29:04,018 --> 01:29:05,747
Let's order something first.

1053
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:06,912
Just a second, Vic.

1054
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:11,819
So what's your opinion? What
should be its colour?

1055
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:14,527
You know some darker shade.

1056
01:29:15,029 --> 01:29:17,520
Something like, deep brown.

1057
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,524
Okay.

1058
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:22,664
l don't think that should
be a problem.

1059
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,001
l'll tell you what.

1060
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,602
l'll pour this coffee on it.

1061
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:35,879
You'll get your colour
and the deal..

1062
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,884
..will also be finalised. Yes?

1063
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:47,119
Just a second.

1064
01:29:48,563 --> 01:29:49,587
Akki!

1065
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:52,058
Akshay, what did you do in there?

1066
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:54,023
l've never met a fool like you.

1067
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:55,535
l don't want to sell her
my painting. Okay?

1068
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:56,934
Buddy, you're a freaking loser.

1069
01:29:57,472 --> 01:29:58,632
lt was so difficult..

1070
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:00,874
What do you think?
You're a Picasso?

1071
01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:02,841
You're a bloody nobody.

1072
01:30:04,078 --> 01:30:06,444
Never. Never ask for help again.

1073
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:07,772
Okay.

1074
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,492
So. -So.

1075
01:30:25,867 --> 01:30:27,630
Just give us five minutes
please. -Sure.

1076
01:30:32,073 --> 01:30:34,803
His deal was very important.
He must be on his way.

1077
01:30:35,209 --> 01:30:38,667
l don't understand this
live-in thing. Really.

1078
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:41,014
So now you want us to get married.

1079
01:30:41,082 --> 01:30:42,106
Why not?

1080
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:49,512
Your generation, you know,
l really pity you all.

1081
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:53,491
Love was unconditional during
our times. Fearless.

1082
01:30:54,562 --> 01:30:56,257
You guys calculate too much.

1083
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:00,700
ls it a respectable job? ls
there good bank balance?

1084
01:31:00,968 --> 01:31:01,992
Papa, come on.

1085
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:06,807
By the way, l don't believe that
a control freak like you..

1086
01:31:06,874 --> 01:31:09,707
..would not have planned
your future with him.

1087
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:17,775
Well, is this guy good
or just ordinary?

1088
01:31:19,053 --> 01:31:20,145
He's nice.

1089
01:31:21,022 --> 01:31:24,048
How nice? -Nice!

1090
01:31:25,059 --> 01:31:26,083
Very nice.

1091
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:28,820
Else, would l introduce
you to him?

1092
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:35,092
Let's order starters at least.

1093
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:37,795
Excuse me.

1094
01:32:41,235 --> 01:32:43,863
Akshay had called. He deal
has gone through.

1095
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:45,197
Oh, how wonderful.

1096
01:32:46,107 --> 01:32:47,904
He'd to go out with the client.

1097
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:49,905
He said to say he's
really sorry, Papa.

1098
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:51,601
We'll meet him some other time.

1099
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,874
Come.

1100
01:33:01,856 --> 01:33:02,948
Come. Let's go.

1101
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:45,792
Call up papa and say sorry to him.

1102
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:50,130
Yes, l'll call your dad.

1103
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:04,012
So, may l ask why you didn't
show up last night?

1104
01:34:04,685 --> 01:34:05,743
l was in a bad mood.

1105
01:34:06,954 --> 01:34:08,216
And l was also late.

1106
01:34:09,023 --> 01:34:10,854
l came back at 1 :30am,
but you were asleep.

1107
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:14,654
Akshay, you came at
3:30am last night.

1108
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:16,828
Do you know how scared l was?

1109
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:18,693
No phone calls. No nothing.

1110
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:19,890
You don't just..

1111
01:34:19,967 --> 01:34:22,026
-Sanjana, it was important
for me to be alone.

1112
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:23,127
Okay?

1113
01:34:27,174 --> 01:34:29,039
You're just upset because
your dad found..

1114
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:31,169
..just one day in three
months to meet you..

1115
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:32,572
..and l couldn't come.

1116
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:35,616
Have you ever wondered
why l didn't show up?

1117
01:34:36,817 --> 01:34:37,841
No.

1118
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:40,578
l didn't want to meet your dad.

1119
01:34:42,123 --> 01:34:43,420
l was having a bad day.

1120
01:34:51,132 --> 01:34:52,156
Were you alone?

1121
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:56,698
What do you mean by that?

1122
01:34:56,971 --> 01:34:58,461
l was with Vic for a while..

1123
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,564
What do you mean?

1124
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,839
Who would l be with?

1125
01:35:05,746 --> 01:35:08,840
Akshay, you never say anything.

1126
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:09,940
Ever!

1127
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:12,616
What are you always
thinking about?

1128
01:35:13,154 --> 01:35:15,588
Just forget it. -What do
you mean forget it?

1129
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:17,248
You owe me an explanation.
Darn it.

1130
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:19,785
We were supposed to have dinner
with papa last night.

1131
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,420
To celebrate your sale.
-What do l celebrate?

1132
01:35:22,797 --> 01:35:24,389
Should l celebrate that l'm broke?

1133
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:26,964
Had we had dinner last night..

1134
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:28,467
..you'd have paid the bill
in front of your dad.

1135
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:29,867
ls that what you wanted to see?

1136
01:35:31,972 --> 01:35:33,633
Celebrate this if you want.

1137
01:35:34,108 --> 01:35:35,803
That my best friend
thinks l'm a loser.

1138
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,704
Or another cancelled deal.

1139
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,048
Or that my girlfriend thinks
l'm cheating on her.

1140
01:35:41,115 --> 01:35:42,139
l never said that, Akshay.

1141
01:35:42,216 --> 01:35:44,684
But that's what you meant, didn't
you? -Akshay! -Don't Akshay me!

1142
01:35:44,752 --> 01:35:45,776
What did you really mean?

1143
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:46,785
Whether or not l was really
alone last night.

1144
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:47,980
Don't change the subject.

1145
01:35:48,055 --> 01:35:50,649
l just wanted to know why you
didn't show up for dinner. -No.

1146
01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:52,920
l think as your girlfriend l've
the right to know that much.

1147
01:35:52,993 --> 01:35:54,858
Sanjana, you wanted
to know which..

1148
01:35:54,929 --> 01:35:56,760
..other girl l was
with last night.

1149
01:35:57,164 --> 01:35:58,426
That's what you asked.

1150
01:36:01,001 --> 01:36:02,059
Where are you going?

1151
01:36:02,636 --> 01:36:04,069
You talk when you want to talk.

1152
01:36:04,138 --> 01:36:05,571
When you don't, you just..

1153
01:36:06,006 --> 01:36:07,200
l want to talk right now.

1154
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:09,233
Sanjana!

1155
01:36:36,604 --> 01:36:38,697
Why does he have to make it
so hard for me to love him?

1156
01:37:01,729 --> 01:37:02,753
l'm sorry.

1157
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,725
Akshay, l just..

1158
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,529
Money crunch leaves
you all confused.

1159
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:15,202
Then take up a job.

1160
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,739
Okay. l'll.

1161
01:37:32,626 --> 01:37:35,390
Perplexed, that's you and me.

1162
01:37:35,463 --> 01:37:37,795
Why strangers do it to us?

1163
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,196
What bothers you?

1164
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:44,563
Part your lips, tell me.

1165
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:48,641
Perplexed, that's you and me.

1166
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:51,405
Why strangers do it to us?

1167
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,843
What bothers you?

1168
01:37:54,915 --> 01:37:57,907
Part your lips, tell me.

1169
01:37:58,652 --> 01:38:05,023
Neither are you unfaithful
nor am l.

1170
01:38:05,693 --> 01:38:11,632
Still we're apart.
What can l say?

1171
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:17,802
l wonder what the fate
has in store for us.

1172
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:24,000
Why did we go our separate ways?

1173
01:38:24,912 --> 01:38:27,847
Oh, my sweetheart.

1174
01:38:31,752 --> 01:38:35,745
Oh, my sweetheart.

1175
01:38:38,726 --> 01:38:43,026
Oh, my sweetheart.

1176
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:50,526
Oh, my sweetheart.

1177
01:38:53,207 --> 01:39:00,113
A day without you
felt like an era.

1178
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:07,018
Your absence pains me.

1179
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:13,890
An evening without you, brought
loneliness for me.

1180
01:39:13,961 --> 01:39:18,694
l feel like crying.

1181
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:25,600
You're angry at me,
so am l at you.

1182
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:32,172
l can't tell you what
the reason is.

1183
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:39,076
l wonder what the fate
has in store for us.

1184
01:39:39,153 --> 01:39:44,955
Why did we go our separate ways?

1185
01:39:45,793 --> 01:39:49,627
Oh, my sweetheart.

1186
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,568
Oh, my sweetheart.

1187
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,671
Oh, my sweetheart.

1188
01:40:06,447 --> 01:40:10,884
Oh, my sweetheart.

1189
01:40:41,715 --> 01:40:45,048
l loved you from my heart.

1190
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,577
But l couldn't get you.

1191
01:40:48,656 --> 01:40:53,787
Happiness slips from my hand.

1192
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:58,829
l exist because of you.

1193
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:02,232
l found you yet l lost you.

1194
01:41:02,469 --> 01:41:07,202
This is what hurts me.

1195
01:41:07,908 --> 01:41:13,972
l'm lonely like you.

1196
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:20,683
Grief-stricken, we both
are. What can we say?

1197
01:41:21,522 --> 01:41:27,222
l wonder what the fate
has in store for us.

1198
01:41:27,695 --> 01:41:33,531
Why did we go our separate ways?

1199
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:37,865
Oh, my sweetheart.

1200
01:41:40,107 --> 01:41:43,804
Oh, my sweetheart.

1201
01:41:47,815 --> 01:41:51,979
Oh, my sweetheart.

1202
01:41:54,788 --> 01:41:59,191
Oh, my sweetheart.

1203
01:42:09,937 --> 01:42:12,667
Even l don't like when you work
as colourist all night.

1204
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:14,970
l know that you're made
for better things.

1205
01:42:15,809 --> 01:42:17,743
But we must think about
the practical life..

1206
01:42:17,811 --> 01:42:19,779
Your idea of practical life
has driven me crazy.

1207
01:42:20,681 --> 01:42:22,672
l work everyday and do the
household chores as well.

1208
01:42:24,418 --> 01:42:25,942
As if someone has snatched
my freedom.

1209
01:42:27,654 --> 01:42:28,746
That someone is me?

1210
01:42:28,822 --> 01:42:30,551
l didn't say that. Don't
misinterpret.

1211
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:32,216
Akshay, l didn't misinterpret.

1212
01:42:32,459 --> 01:42:33,949
Stop walking away from me, Akshay.

1213
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:37,152
Do whatever you feel like.
Just don't blame me.

1214
01:42:37,598 --> 01:42:38,758
l've to quit. Okay.

1215
01:42:39,133 --> 01:42:42,728
So, then quit, damn it.
But don't blame me.

1216
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:46,495
Akshay!

1217
01:42:50,477 --> 01:42:55,244
Do you still paint? -No.

1218
01:43:02,856 --> 01:43:06,656
Well..where is your..friend?
What is his name?

1219
01:43:07,027 --> 01:43:08,585
He was aboard the flight with you.

1220
01:43:08,896 --> 01:43:10,124
Rajiv? -Yes.

1221
01:43:10,497 --> 01:43:12,488
He was supposed to go with
you to your house.

1222
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:13,590
No.

1223
01:43:15,702 --> 01:43:21,038
Actually he was telling me that
he found you very cute.

1224
01:43:22,843 --> 01:43:24,105
Cute? -Yes.

1225
01:43:25,546 --> 01:43:27,810
Okay. -He's gay.

1226
01:43:29,016 --> 01:43:32,042
Okay. Okay. He's gay. Okay.

1227
01:43:33,487 --> 01:43:34,647

You couldn't get that view.

1254
01:45:48,055 --> 01:45:53,083
You were nervous when l saw

1255
01:45:54,594 --> 01:45:55,618

01:46:27,127 --> 01:46:29,152
She's so sweet. She doesn't

01:49:36,616 --> 01:49:38,049
No, Akshay, you don't need this.

1305
01:49:38,985 --> 01:49:40,976
What you need is your own art.

1306
01:49:41,755 --> 01:49:44,053
You don't need a job where you'll
have to take permission..

1307
01:49:44,124 --> 01:49:45,591
..for anything you want to paint.

1308
01:49:45,659 --> 01:49:47,183
So, you want to me to
become an artist..

1309
01:49:47,427 --> 01:49:48,724
..who roams the street again?

1310
01:49:48,995 --> 01:49:51,088
Who has to ask his girlfriend
for a bottle of beer?

1311
01:49:52,032 --> 01:49:53,590
Akshay, l earn for both of us.

1312
01:49:53,867 --> 01:49:55,892
What's wrong if l earn
for both of us?

1313
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:58,135
What's the problem with that?

1314
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:03,733

01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:18,057
Sanjana, what are you saying?

1317
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:22,526
You want me to leave my job,
my career, family, friends..

1318
01:50:22,596 --> 01:50:24,154
..and come with you
to Sidney, right?

1319
01:50:24,931 --> 01:50:25,989
Then marry me.

1320
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,561
Sanjana, we both are
talking about..

1321
01:50:28,635 --> 01:50:29,932
..completely different things.

1322
01:50:30,036 --> 01:50:31,560
How can this happen? Marriage..

1323
01:50:31,638 --> 01:50:33,037
Why not?

1324
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:37,203
You took a decision when you took
up a job, for both of us.

1325
01:50:37,444 --> 01:50:38,502
Without asking me.

1326
01:50:38,778 --> 01:50:40,643
Now take one more decision.
For both of us.

1327
01:50:41,214 --> 01:50:45,014
Sanjana, listen, l'm not
settled right now.

1328
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:47,083
l haven't got a bank balance.

1329
01:50:48,888 --> 01:50:50,014
How can l get married?

1330
01:50:52,092 --> 01:50:53,559

Yes, l have. But then..
let's wait.

1333
01:51:01,935 --> 01:51:02,959
We'll see.

1334
01:51:04,104 --> 01:51:05,128
Exactly.

1335
01:51:08,241 --> 01:51:10,209
Sanjana. Sanjana, where
are you going?

1336
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:11,834
Sanjana.

1337
01:51:14,114 --> 01:51:15,240
Sanjana, listen to me.

1338
01:51:15,649 --> 01:51:18,948
l've invested three years in my
job, for our life together.

For our stability. l

What do you want me to do? -You

..from scratch for both of us?

1343
01:51:28,595 --> 01:51:30,927
You want me to follow you wherever
you go. -To cook for you?

1344
01:51:32,098 --> 01:51:33,895
You don't need me.
You need a muse.

1345
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:35,998
A statue for inspiration.

1346
01:51:36,469 --> 01:51:37,800
Sanjana, don't talk rubbish.

1347
01:51:38,038 --> 01:51:41,838
Sanjana. Sanjana, this job offer

Go. l can't come.

1352
01:51:54,654 --> 01:51:56,918
What would you do, had you
gotten this job offer?

1353
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:58,718
You'd do the same, right?

1354

l'd got it. Chief Editor,
Youth Magazine, London.

1355
01:52:03,496 --> 01:52:05,828
But unlike you, l thought
about you first.

1356
01:52:06,232 --> 01:52:08,223
Because it was important for
you to be in Cape Town.

1357
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:13,138
You didn't do me a favour.

1358
01:52:13,273 --> 01:52:15,104
lf you'd got an offer
and if you liked..

1359
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:16,699
..it, you should've taken it.

1360

You know what, you

01:52:20,447 --> 01:52:23,678
That you control my life. Do
this. Do that. Sit there.

1362
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,741
Wear these clothes. -Akshay,
that's not fair.

1363
01:52:26,019 --> 01:52:27,782
l've always thought about us.

1364
01:52:27,854 --> 01:52:29,685
Nonsense. l don't think
you think about us.

1365
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:31,782
You'd never have refused to come..

1366
01:52:31,858 --> 01:52:33,553

thought about us.

1367

l can't refuse this job offer.

1370
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:39,982
Everything's over.

1371
01:53:51,571 --> 01:53:52,902
You didn't even listen once.

1372
01:54:01,247 --> 01:54:02,839
We'd never fight so bitterly.

1373
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:11,657
Then l'll have enough time.

1374
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:21,196
Will you do something for me?

1375
01:54:26,673 --> 01:54:30,507
Stay here for tonight. Please.

1376
01:54:53,466 --> 01:54:54,558
Could you forget me?

1377

Good.

1378

Okay. lt's fine.

1379
01:55:22,896 --> 01:55:23,920
Shall we leave?

1380
01:55:36,643 --> 01:55:37,701
What's this noise?

1381
01:55:55,828 --> 01:55:57,819
Run. Run!

1382
01:56:36,202 --> 01:56:37,396

1383
01:57:01,594 --> 01:57:03,027
Oh no. -Akshay..

1384
01:57:06,866 --> 01:57:08,697
The keys.. -That was the last one.

1385
01:57:12,505 --> 01:57:13,529
Akshay..

1386
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:25,074
Akshay..

1387
01:57:50,443 --> 01:57:52,536
Akshay, you.. -Don't worry.

1388
01:59:43,656 --> 01:59:45,590
Akshay! Akshay!

1389
01:59:46,626 --> 01:59:47,650
Akshay.

1390
01:59:49,762 --> 01:59:50,854
Come down.

1391
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:52,693
The way ahead looks safe.

1392
01:59:52,765 --> 01:59:53,789
Come down.

1393
02:00:23,596 --> 02:00:24,620
Move ahead.

1394
02:00:26,499 --> 02:00:29,593
Listen..did you tell her?

1395
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:34,162
What? -That you love her.

1396
02:00:37,076 --> 02:00:38,805
Are you crazy? Move on.

1397
02:00:40,947 --> 02:00:41,971
What do you mean?

1398
02:00:42,248 --> 02:00:43,613
She was in front of you.

1399
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:46,080
You were with her all
alone for so long..

1400
02:00:47,053 --> 02:00:49,749
..and you still couldn't tell
her that you love her.

1401

Nothing.
