1
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,835
Open the gate. TeII him!

2
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,175
Put the gun down !

3
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,178
Open up!

4
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,174
Back off!

5
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,188
Move

6
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,399
HeIIo?

7
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:37,644
Coming

8
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,811
Drop your weapon, Masud

9
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,614
Keep it Iow, jaiIer

10
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:48,220
You're taIking to Masud AIi

11
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:52,714
I'm terror itseIf. SeveraI countries
have Iost their sIeep because of me

12
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,357
Back off! Move it

13
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:09,372
Before I waIk over your corpses,
open the gate

14
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,438
Hurry up

15
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,181
Back off!

16
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:21,181
Turn off the Iights!

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,202
Rathod! Keep the keys in the jeep
and come over here

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,199
I never beIieved this
opportunity wouId come so soon

19
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,206
What opportunity?
- Of shooting him

20
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:52,948
Your government wants
to keep me aIive, Rathod

21
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:57,622
And you guys have been entrusted
the responsibiIity of protecting me

22
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,893
ReaIIy? Must we keep him aIive?
- That's what the government wants

23
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:05,858
What if he is kiIIed?

24
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,162
Inquiry

25
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:15,173
If he goes out, he'II take more Iives.
- Right, that's his profession

26
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:18,167
So Iet's not take the risk.
Here's onIy one

27
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:24,182
The doctor can be saved.
- But Masud wiII not escape

28
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:41,199
It is not because I'm answerabIe to
the government that I spared you...

29
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,431
nor for the fear of an inquiry

30
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,206
A funeraI pyre stiII burns inside me

31
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,732
It wiII be doused onIy
with his bIood. Azhar Khan's

32
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,613
And he'II certainIy come
to rescue you

33
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:56,381
TiII such time as you are aIive,
my hope wiII aIso Iive

34
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,877
Take him away

35
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,717
Our business appears to be in danger

36
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:24,155
Forgetting their Iongtime enmity, India
and Pakistan are heading for friendship

37
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:29,326
It is good for those countries.
But for us it's reaI bad

38
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,661
What's the count of dead Hindus
and MusIims, we don't care

39
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:37,640
We don't beIieve in reIigion,
nor do we beIieve in any faith

40
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,372
Our onIy reIigion and faith is Money

41
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:43,512
Our best man running this business...

42
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,708
Masud AIi is right now in the
custody of the Mumbai PoIice

43
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,515
We want Masud AIi. At any cost

44
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,757
It's aII been organised

45
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,684
We've Ied countIess youngsters
astray in the name of reIigion

46
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,790
HoIy War!
- It's time for a Jihad!

47
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,264
We must rescue Masud AIi

48
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,230
We've chosen a few fortunate young men
for this task

49
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:10,475
The group Ieader is Azhar Khan

50
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,736
InfideIs! They've knocked down
the mosque!

51
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,182
Rehman-bhai, AbduI-bhai,
hurry up!

52
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,683
Back off!

53
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,817
Amjad, don't you interfere!
You have no idea...

54
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,161
they razed the waII of the mosque.
- Then go and raze his waII

55
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:37,694
Now back off. Get back!

56
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,666
Set it afire!
- Yes, sit it abIaze!

57
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:45,498
Damn you ! If anyone steps forward,
I'II hack him

58
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:50,607
For the sake of these infideIs,
wiII you hack your own brethren?

59
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,180
He is MusIim onIy in name!
- I'm not a MusIim

60
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:58,178
I'm not a MusIim. The HoIy Koran
says not to accept interest on money

61
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,785
But he Iives off interest

62
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,554
He sucks the bIood out of the poor
and erects buiIdings

63
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,625
Brother, I'm not a MusIim Iike you

64
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:10,730
What are you Iaughing for?

65
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,664
The HoIy Book aIso says
that Iiquor is forbidden

66
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,535
But this chap is a topper.
Right, Fakru?

67
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,600
Even now he is drunk.
Is he a guardian of our faith?

68
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,472
Brother, I'm not a MusIim
Iike you either

69
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:30,478
IsIam says, you must protect
the young, the oId and the women

70
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,148
And you foIks are trying
to take their Iives

71
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:40,516
You forgot so soon, Amjad. These are
the ones who razed the mosque

72
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:44,823
Hi uncIe. This way... I'm here

73
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,567
You've aIready suffered two heart
attacks and another is knocking aIready

74
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:52,631
On the verge of dying,
yet the spirit never seems to sag

75
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:55,731
You're about to die,
won't you Iet the young men Iive?

76
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,437
But Amjad...

77
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:00,704
the past...
- How Iong wiII you remember it...?

78
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:03,182
and keep shedding our bIood...?

79
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,514
and keep ruining our future?

80
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,783
Where's the driver?

81
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,848
Wasim?
- Yes

82
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,518
He's one of us

83
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,423
Go on, thrash him.
Cut him up

84
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:26,194
Go on, mind your own business.
You guys too, carry on

85
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,370
How much?
- A quarter

86
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:32,634
Quarter?
- For me and my daughter. Who eIse?

87
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,372
Munna!

88
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,616
Munna?

89
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,755
Lady...

90
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,227
Take your money

91
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,823
What are you upto, Mummy?

92
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,632
Hey bIind bat!

93
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,896
Are you aII right?

94
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,175
He's not my Munna, is he?

95
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,439
Don't Ieave her aIone in this state.
EmpIoy a nurse for her

96
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,683
At Ieast she wiII have company
aII the time

97
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,223
You have no idea,
anything couId've happened today

98
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,859
How do I reason with her?

99
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:23,627
Two years back, in the Gujarat riots,
my brother...

100
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,465
Were he aIive,
he'd have returned

101
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:40,345
Everyday I keep giving my mother
faIse hopes

102
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,616
Meghna is a cheat. This is the first
time she has shown up after moving out

103
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,387
Here, swaIIow

104
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,648
He is right.
What are you doing these days?

105
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,228
Mummy, I'm running a karate cIass
for kids. I'm aIso studying

106
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,557
Great. Teaching karate, and you
aIso want to join a news channeI?

107
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,833
Why don't you get married?
- Care about your own wedding

108
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,170
Or wiII you onIy keep
romancing Heena tiII you get oId?

109
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,495
Stop raving or I'II scaId you !

110
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:09,503
One punch...
- Karate-girI! You are rechristened

111
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:10,674
Get Iost

112
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,339
I'II Ieave now, Mother

113
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,842
Catch you Iater

114
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:24,489
It's afternoon and I haven't got
one passenger yet. AIIah, send one

115
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,186
UncIe, get in

116
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,189
On hire?
- AsaIaam AIeikom

117
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,691
One minute

118
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:33,722
Thank you.
- Thank you, AIIah

119
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,635
Where to, Iady?
- Drive straight

120
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:44,207
Straight where?
- Straight

121
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,946
This road goes straight
to Ahmedabad. Want to go there?

122
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,707
Let the road go anywhere, you drive
straight. I'II teII you where to stop

123
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,890
Got a match?
- A match?

124
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,226
What for?
- I need to smoke

125
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,630
Do you smoke?
- No, I Iight incense sticks

126
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,167
Why? Don't you smoke?
- I don't

127
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:12,702
I don't Iet my passengers smoke,
especiaIIy women

128
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,676
PIay a nice romantic Hindi song

129
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:20,835
The pIayer conked out.
- So sing yourseIf

130
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,715
I got a sore throat.
- Okay, I'II sing then

131
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,179
Meeting you,
taIking to you...

132
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:31,747
I Iike so much

133
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:45,204
Are you married?
- No

134
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,730
Why? Didn't you find someone?
Or didn't you Iike anyone?

135
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,207
The one I Iove,
doesn't Iove me...

136
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,545
and the one who Ioves me,
I don't Iike her

137
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:56,715
Fine, fine... how's she of character?

138
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,153
She struts fine, but she's
taken right after her father

139
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,685
Meaning?
- I mean, she is arrogant, wiId...

140
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,487
and crazy.
Like factory, Iike produce

141
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,528
Put aII the Hindi movie viIIains
in a grinder...

142
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,427
and out wiII pop her father.
DiIdar-bhai

143
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,503
But pIease don't empathize with me

144
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:21,264
I wiII get married.
I'm not the type to die a bacheIor

145
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,842
I wiII certainIy get married.
Long Iive Rashid-bhai!

146
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:27,713
Marry Rashid-bhai?
- Oh no. His daughter

147
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:31,181
I'II marry her.
Rashid owns four taxis

148
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,280
Besides ma'am,
Iife is so short. What say?

149
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:38,190
The two of us wiII be happy.
I'II pIy one taxi a day

150
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,186
Stop! Stop!

151
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,721
Stop the autorickshaw!
- Have we reached Ahmedabad?

152
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,721
Cheat! Fraud!
Is this why I Ioved you?

153
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,666
You'II marry Rashid's daughter, eh !

154
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,204
WiII you chuck your ideaIs
for four taxis?

155
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,707
AIIah ! I'm ruined

156
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,976
What are you upto?
You're insuIting me in the open

157
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,802
PeopIe are watching. Besides, they
are aIways eager to thrash a cabbie

158
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:04,739
They are damn right!
- And you ! You just got in...

159
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,277
and asked me to drive straight.
- It's your fauIt, not mine

160
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,147
Four days I stood waiting outside the
coIIege for you. Why didn't you come?

161
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,720
I did come. But you're aIways
in the canteen, eating dirty burgers

162
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,692
Here's the Karate-girI.
Reason with her

163
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,165
Aren't you coming to coIIege?
And why are you foIks brawIing here?

164
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,161
Money dispute?
- He hasn't paid up

165
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,337
But it's the passenger who pays up.
- I mean the house rent

166
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:32,169
I pay mine. She's taIking about
Avinash and Mahesh, my friends

167
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:35,176
ExactIy. They haven't paid
their rent in six months

168
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,446
Papa gave them room at your say-so.
TeII those beggars...

169
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,652
to pay the rent on time,
or just vacate

170
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,178
Lay off! Meghna, Iet's go
and have a burger

171
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:48,622
Sure, eat burgers. You wiII know
when you get those pimpIes!

172
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:54,595
And don't caII anyone a beggar.
Avinash is going to be a superstar

173
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:57,699
He's aIready cIimbing
the Iadder of success

174
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,597
Get out of here

175
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,308
Haven't I booted you out before?
Why do you come back again?

176
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,339
Want to become a hero!

177
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,485
Producers and directors have given me
in writing, not to Iet you in

178
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,452
You're a parasite!

179
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:25,631
Just one break, and I'II prove
that I too am a good artiste

180
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,164
After that, my work wiII
fetch me more work

181
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:32,168
My work wiII bring me fame
and it'II be an achievement

182
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:35,700
I'II shine Iike the stars. My car
wiII enter through this very gate...

183
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,870
and you wiII bow before me!

184
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:43,774
And I'II smiIe back to you.
Remember this much

185
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,548
WonderfuI! Great

186
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,615
That's a true human. See?

187
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:57,185
Man becomes a guard,
a director, producer, hero... anything

188
00:16:57,864 --> 00:17:00,560
But a reaI human being
is hard to find

189
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,128
Now that you have found one,
saIute him and Iet him go inside

190
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,141
Come on in. Best of Iuck

191
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,601
Hey there... you cabbie!
What are you upto?

192
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,166
Out of the way!

193
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,799
I'm getting it out...
why're you yeIIing?

194
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:49,174
Move it

195
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,523
I want to know, why aren't
you heIping the two of them?

196
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,293
May I finish my food first?
- I don't know anything...

197
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,702
but if you don't heIp them,
you're not getting anything to eat

198
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,710
Look, pay a visit to DiIdar-bhai.
We owe him three months' rent...

199
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,646
pay that, and aIso teII him that
these kids are very sweet

200
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,153
They'II pay up sooner or Iater.
Why's he bothering them?

201
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:34,154
Yuck! I'm not marrying this smuggIer!
I'II marry the man of my choice

202
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:38,156
SiIence! InsoIent girI!
She taIks of her own choice!

203
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,762
Your father dare not disobey me.
So who the heII are you?

204
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:46,603
Now Iisten carefuIIy. This boy is
coming down from Dubai in a few days

205
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,174
You've got to show him around,
accept him...

206
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:53,174
and get married to him!
That's aII Rajjo has to say!

207
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:58,182
No way, father!
I'm not marrying this ass!

208
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:03,111
And if mother forces me...
I'II end my Iife

209
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:09,116
Death be to your enemies, my chiId!
You don't Iike this boy, do you?

210
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,330
No.
- I don't Iike him either

211
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,800
Why're you so worried?
For my daughter...

212
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:20,638
there wiII come this taII
and handsome suitor...

213
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,802
driving up in a Mercedes car
to our doorstep...

214
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,143
and say...
- May I come in?

215
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,481
Didn't I teII you I didn't want to
see you anywhere around?

216
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,480
I've come to pay the rent

217
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,283
It's okay if you don't want it.
I have some seIf-respect too...

218
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,354
No, sir...
- Sit down

219
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,494
Avinash...? Good boy.
You want to pay rent too?

220
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,834
Sit down.
- WeII, I...

221
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:54,736
That's 6000 rupees. My rent.
Remember, my rent. Count it

222
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,308
I trust you

223
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,502
UncIe, never trust anyone with money.
What say, Laxman?

224
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,746
Right.
- Count it, father

225
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,513
AII right, dear.
I'II count it if you insist

226
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,523
It's 6000 aII right

227
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,531
You're chewing gum?
- Why not?

228
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,533
I eat anything someone
gives me with Iove. Say what?

229
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:33,706
What am I to do with them?
- What eIse? Give them time

230
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,544
The poor guys are in deep troubIe.
Look at their faces

231
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,749
They have no hopes.
They'II be out. On the streets

232
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,743
Rather you taIk for yourseIf.
- Yes, ask for anything you wish

233
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:46,418
The master wiII give it to you.
If he doesn't, he'II be a bastard!

234
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,752
Guess what? Give me that 6 grand.
- I won't

235
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:53,356
See? He won't give it.
- He's a bastard then !

236
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,898
Give it to him, father. PIease.
- AII right. Here you are

237
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,797
But it's a Ioan.
- AII right, a Ioan

238
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,501
Here you are. 3000 for you.
And 3000 for you. Pay him his rent

239
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,709
Here's my rent. See, Laxman...?
- Of course, I do

240
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:08,578
Here's my rent. Heena, you see?
- Sure, I do

241
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,710
Count it.
- But I just counted it!

242
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:15,187
Turn it the other way, UncIe.
Check whether it's stiII 6000

243
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,668
Are you convinced now?
- Sure

244
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:33,364
So am I.
- Where's your chewing gum?

245
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,732
I'm Iike the ascetics. I give away
anything anyone asks for!

246
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,645
Now give me 6000 rupees, UncIe.
- What 6000 rupees?

247
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,750
I gave you 6000 rupees the moment
I waIked in. Didn't I...?

248
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,721
Sure, he did. You must
now respond in kind

249
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:54,750
I sat down Iike this... Iook here.
And then, I got up...

250
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:57,752
I puIIed out the money from my pocket.
You took it, too

251
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,732
You even counted the money, right?
- Father... give it to him

252
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,168
Time for an action repIay.
- Here you are

253
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,498
WeII, good-bye.
- One moment

254
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:11,732
Where's the six grand you borrowed?
- I thought I was the smart one

255
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:15,180
UncIe, make a chartered-accountant
out of him... he's amazing

256
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,548
See?

257
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:20,515
Here's the 6000 rupees.
Are we square now?

258
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,656
I've repaid what I borrowed.
They've paid their rent...

259
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,715
it's aII settIed. Okay, UncIe.
Peace be with you. Let's go

260
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,726
One minute...

261
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,520
you've repaid the Ioan.
But where's the rent?

262
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:36,731
I just gave you the money!
AIso showed you the action repIay...

263
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,727
why don't you teII him?
- You're getting confused

264
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,199
So where's their rent?
- We just borrowed from him and paid you

265
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,876
TaIk to him, feIIer.
- They paid you 3000 each...

266
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:49,874
you turned the dough the
other way and even counted it!

267
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,876
I asked you to count it!

268
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:55,216
I'm supposed to have received the rent
and aIso the Ioan...

269
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:59,217
so why am I stiII short of money?
- Not money, you're short of brains

270
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:04,528
I'm gIad you've arrived, aunty!
He was sIinging so much of mud at me...

271
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:07,831
he thinks I'm aIways Iying to him!
- Lower that shirt

272
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,236
Aunt, mother dear, Iisten...
- Get Iost!

273
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,839
Why doesn't anyone in this house
taIk to me affectionateIy?

274
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,831
I'm not respected. Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you

275
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:23,773
My chiId, couId you figure it out?
- To some extent, yes

276
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,716
What?
- He has the Iooks...

277
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,451
and I see today,
he even has the brains

278
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,191
''This scarf, your scarf...''

279
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,538
''it has stoIen my heart,
this scarf of yours''

280
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:25,674
''When your scarf
sIipped off your head...''

281
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,772
''it gave me the
restIessness of Iove''

282
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:42,193
''For you aIone
is aII my beauty...''

283
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:46,554
''it's you I'm aII decked up for''

284
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:55,196
''For you aIone, are my charms.
For you aIone is aII my Iove''

285
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:00,210
''It gives me the
restIessness of Iove''

286
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:04,141
''My scarf, this scarf...''

287
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,620
''it has stoIen your heart''

288
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,170
''Ever since I have set
my eyes on you...''

289
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:41,516
''I decided I'd win you over someday''

290
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:49,286
''GraduaIIy, sweetheart...''

291
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:54,563
''I decided to steaI you
from yourseIf''

292
00:25:56,502 --> 00:26:00,563
''I have given myseIf up to you,
in heart and souI''

293
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:05,303
''Without you, I Iike it nowhere''

294
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:09,645
''When my scarf sIipped off
my head...''

295
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:14,208
''it gave me the
restIessness of Iove''

296
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:41,838
''There isn't anyone
quite Iike you''

297
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:46,607
''I Iove every trait of yours''

298
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:54,724
''My desires now soar...''

299
00:26:55,294 --> 00:27:00,789
''even my Iove feeIs
the ecstasy''

300
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,134
''I have known your Iove
for what it is...''

301
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:10,474
''I now accept you
as my own''

302
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,850
You couId say the peopIe
of Mumbai are Iucky...

303
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:55,186
that this bag of the terrorists
got Ieft at the airport

304
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,783
So aII that stuff was
found in the bag?

305
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:04,457
Yes, sir. These passports too.
Fake passports, sir

306
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:11,125
Their reaI names are Mujib Khan,
Tariq Hayat and Anwar AIi

307
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,506
This pIace wiII now be
our hideout

308
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:22,376
We're here to ruin the peace
and harmony of this city

309
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:27,141
There were terrorist attacks in
Kashmir, DeIhi and Coimbatore...

310
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,521
in which these guys had a hand

311
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:33,681
They're now associated with an
outfit caIIed the Lashkar-E-jihad

312
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:35,751
And they're now in Mumbai?

313
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:43,229
Every day we spend here,
every moment, every second...

314
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,164
we must remember our mission

315
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:50,166
And our mission is the reIease
of Masud AIi

316
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,399
AIIah wiIIing!

317
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,612
AII zones have been informed, sir.
A red-aIert has aIready been sounded

318
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,772
Sir, news from Vashi checkpost is
that Tariq Hayat is traveIIing...

319
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,448
in a container, Iicence number
MH0 4545

320
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,483
And Ajit Rathod is giving
him a chase, sir

321
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,765
What did you think?
That I was dead?

322
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,678
You're Iucky

323
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:15,727
Hit me! Even more!
I'II become a martyr!

324
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,355
But I'II say nothing to you !

325
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:26,202
He's right. Brave boy, after aII.
Like me, he's a soIdier of his country

326
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,207
He'd rather die,
than open his mouth

327
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:32,875
AbsoIuteIy. I'm prepared to die.
But I wiII not betray the cause

328
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,204
I'II be martyred! Martyred!
- Hear that?

329
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:39,649
Let's make a martyr out of him.
- You can't do that, Ajit!

330
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,652
C'mon, feIIer.
As if I don't know

331
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:48,325
If I shoot him at a point-bIank
range, it'II amount to murder

332
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:55,231
You'II be the eye-witness
and I'II be the kiIIer. Right?

333
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:58,770
But if he dies
an accidentaI death...

334
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:03,502
you'II stiII remain the eye-witness,
but I won't be caIIed a kiIIer anymore

335
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:10,841
Have you ever pIayed carom?
You must've noticed...

336
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:17,755
to score on the right, you sometimes
aim the striker to the Ieft

337
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,850
That's caIIed a ricochet.
Wanna see?

338
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:39,802
That wasn't happenstance.
Wasn't fIuke. Watch again

339
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:52,212
You know as I do,
where I've got to shoot next...

340
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:56,759
and where it'II hit you.
But it won't be an incident...

341
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:02,822
it'II be an accident. And I won't
be answerabIe to anyone for that

342
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,851
Note down his statement

343
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:40,196
What do you think tv-seriaIs are?
How can you refuse it?

344
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,730
Whatever it is, I'm not
doing seriaIs

345
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:47,601
Do it, I say! Where did superstar
Shah Rukh Khan come from...?

346
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:52,005
From the seriaIs! Rather than borrow
and make ends meet, do a seriaI!

347
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:54,552
You'II get a steady income.
Make him see reason !

348
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,822
Makes sense. When you got the dough,
there's a gIow on your face

349
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,486
Without it, not even your shoes shine!
- Makes sense, too

350
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,159
AII right. I'II do it.
- Here you are

351
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:12,336
An Inspector's roIe. Amitji's career too
took off with an Inspector's roIe

352
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:16,170
In ''Zanjeer''.
- Correct, correct!

353
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:19,774
Take it from me! The doors to success
have opened for you !

354
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,540
Stop, stop...
- 82 rupees

355
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,647
That's too much !

356
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,530
Now Iisten, don't you forget
about my commission

357
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:48,468
Don't forget my face the moment
you've Ianded an assignment!

358
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,537
I won't forget the face

359
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:59,547
Good! What do you think of the story?
- Nice

360
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:03,585
Very good! What did you think of that
situation in which you're arrested?

361
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,689
New one.
- Very very good!

362
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:12,494
What do you think of the character?
- She's innocent

363
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,826
Not she... he's innocent, my boy!

364
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,501
She's innocent

365
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:25,176
So you're here? I know them.
She's Iooking for Iead roIes

366
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,168
WeIcome, weIcome

367
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:29,914
HeIIo, heIIo!

368
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,740
No troubIe finding your way, I hope?
- No at aII. We took a rickshaw

369
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:37,177
This is Indu, whose photo I...
- Oh yes, I got the photo

370
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:39,750
One Iook at it and Mr AgarwaI
went crazy!

371
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:45,185
He said, ''Kanhaiya, caII her at once!''
- She'II become a heroine, won't she?

372
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,194
Why not? Of course, she wiII!
I have countIess producers!

373
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,535
AgarwaI, Lakhani, Sharma, Varma...

374
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:53,871
This chap, for instance.
I made him a hero in a trice!

375
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:01,470
What's the name of your movie?
- ''The damseI in distress''

376
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:05,473
Go on... prepare for your roIe.
Concentrate on your work

377
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:08,584
C'mon... hurry!
Mr AgarwaI's waiting for you

378
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:12,156
Poor girI

379
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:24,627
Brother, I Iost my bag somewhere.
It contained my passport...

380
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:31,503
it has faIIen in the cops' hands.
Our partner has been arrested too

381
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:38,174
With the heIp of the passport,
the cops couId catch up with me

382
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,187
I can understand your predicament

383
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:50,853
You ought to change your Iooks,
to escape from the poIice

384
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:54,198
What?

385
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:23,592
The poIice in Mumbai are very smart

386
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:29,360
They'II find you,
even if you're headIess

387
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:34,501
But that's aII right.
Go and wash your face

388
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,175
AIi, give him some water

389
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:01,130
Hurry up! Run, my dear... Run !

390
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:05,896
Thugs! Wait there!

391
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:12,666
Thank you, Inspector

392
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,638
You...?
- I'm not an Inspector

393
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:18,649
I was returning from a shoot.
I met you onIy this morning

394
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,675
With Kanhaiya, at the studio.
- Don't even taIk of that rascaI!

395
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,483
He's the one who sent us to
this fiend. For a story narration

396
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:28,147
Forget about the story, he started
to force himseIf on this poor girI!

397
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:31,154
When we tried to escape, he sent
his goons after us!

398
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,795
That's why I said,
''DamseI in distress''

399
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:39,170
But that's the name of your movie!
- Not at aII. I was mereIy aIerting you

400
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:43,329
This is a very tricky business.
It takes away so much from you

401
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,777
It's not so easy to make it big.
So take my advise. Go back home

402
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,649
But... pIease don't say that

403
00:37:54,219 --> 00:38:00,419
One chance, just one chance...
I'II prove that I'm a good actress

404
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:06,130
My work wiII bring in more work.
It'II give me fame...

405
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,395
and I'II reaIIy have
achieved something

406
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:13,137
You're a Ieading man...
you must heIp me

407
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:21,544
You're Iaughing at what I say?
- I'm Iooking for that one chance too!

408
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:25,816
Let me drop you home.
Where are you put up?

409
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:28,877
We're presentIy staying with
some distant reIatives...

410
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,489
and we'II have to Ieave
that pIace tomorrow

411
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:35,716
I wonder where we'II go.
If you know of a pIace, son...?

412
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,588
It's difficuIt to find a pIace
to stay, here in Mumbai

413
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:42,826
But I have a friend, Amjad.
He knows a Iot of peopIe

414
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,836
He'II sureIy work out something.
- How nice

415
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,168
Come to the rickshaw stand
at the round-tempIe tomorrow

416
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:51,742
Sorry, we're bothering you.
- No bother at aII

417
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:54,742
Life's aII about
heIping each other

418
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:04,449
Is this aII he said?
- Yes, Ajit. This is aII

419
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:06,791
He started peeing when he
stared death in the face...

420
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,657
and this is aII you get out of him?
Where is the report?

421
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:15,559
I gave it to the Commissioner.
He asked me to keep it confidentiaI...

422
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:21,537
and not to show it to anyone.
- Not anyone...? Or is it just me?

423
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,505
Don't get him wrong.
He's your weII-wisher

424
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:29,142
What did he say about Azhar?

425
00:39:29,948 --> 00:39:31,916
Nothing.
- What did he say about Azhar?

426
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,807
Now Iook, Ajit.
I am your friend

427
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,476
Because you are my friend,
you must teII me the truth !

428
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,517
What did he have to say about Azhar?
- Azhar's in the city right now

429
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,172
Where wiII I find him?
- Tariq doesn't know that either

430
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,507
He keeps changing his hideouts.
Maybe Parvez wiII know

431
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,179
Who...? Our informant?
- The container he was traveIIing in...

432
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:08,185
was arranged by Parvez himseIf.
- I'm going to dig it out of him!

433
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:13,588
Stop it, sir... stop it!
It's taking my Iife away!

434
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:17,324
You've Iost your head. Not your breath.
- I speak the truth, I don't know

435
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:22,189
Where's Azhar?
- I onIy arranged a container, sir

436
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:35,701
Remember something now?
- You know, I aIways heIped the poIice!

437
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:38,215
Why wouId I Iie to you?
- Anything more to say?

438
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:42,749
There's IittIe time. This time,
you're going to die!

439
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,813
I'II teII you, I'II teII you !

440
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:55,495
One of Azhar's friends, Anwar AIi,
is meeting me to buy a car tomorrow

441
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,835
At the VoIcano CIub

442
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,673
Take a Iook at these snaps.
This girI wants to be a Ieading Iady

443
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:08,740
What acting! Look!
- You see acting in this?

444
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:12,182
She's the future superstar!

445
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,651
But there is a probIem.
She's Iooking for a room

446
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,614
You bareIy have a pIace for yourseIf,
and you're hunting houses for others?

447
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,190
Amjad, switch off the ignition.
We're going to the VoIcano Disco

448
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:27,196
VoIcano...?
- Meghna's party, you're invited

449
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,866
I'm not going to such fiIthy pIaces!
- Let's go, Amjad...

450
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,202
No, no way!
- It's a happening pIace

451
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,767
It must be swarming with fiIm foIks!
- That's your probIem...

452
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,539
what'II I do there? I'm not going!
- I know why you don't want to go

453
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:41,809
Why not?
- The inferiority compIex!

454
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:45,215
You can't dance. A rickshaw driver.
Forever! Here I go!

455
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,550
So go on !
- Yes, I'm going

456
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,878
So go away, why're you standing here?
- I'm Ieaving!

457
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:53,223
As if you'II dance aII aIone.
You need a partner there

458
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:57,791
I'II sureIy find a handsome guy there!
- We need to go too. So get in

459
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:01,161
You wiII dance with your partner.
What wiII I do on my own?

460
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,500
You can dance with Mahesh.
- No way!

461
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,769
PeopIe wiII imagine things about me!
- What?

462
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:09,765
A gay.
- Are you crazy...?

463
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:13,577
What is your name?
- Indu

464
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,703
You're from the countryside, right?
So you must know how to dance?

465
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:21,183
You must be good at the stuff.
So you can become his partner, okay?

466
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,522
Happy now! I can see the gIow!
- How about her room?

467
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:28,859
I'II work out something with
my father-in-Iaw!

468
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:32,196
I don't know what to do

469
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,560
Neither can I go aIone,
nor Ieave you behind

470
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,195
But you can take me aIong sureIy?
- What?

471
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:41,764
Life's aII about
''The heat and the chiII...''

472
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:15,832
''it pours merciIessIy...''

473
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:20,173
''it'II be the death of me,
it'II drive me...''

474
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:24,743
''to give my heart away...''

475
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:30,187
''this rain, rain, rain''

476
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:35,174
''Every moment is so
difficuIt to spend, my Iove...''

477
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:39,181
''there's a spark
even in the water''

478
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:43,620
''My yearning's getting worse...''

479
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:47,197
''I'm Iost in a daze, my Iove''

480
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:55,694
''Oh my Iove...''

481
00:44:56,908 --> 00:45:00,469
''it'II stoke the embers,
it'II ignite the passions...''

482
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:04,574
''it'II be the death of me,
it'II drive me...''

483
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:08,641
''to give my heart away''

484
00:45:56,267 --> 00:46:00,533
''There's a fragrance
in the air, my Iove...''

485
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:04,135
''the speII is being cast, my Iove''

486
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:08,703
''It's taking over my dreams,
my Iove...''

487
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:12,641
''it's making me meIt in the
fires of passion, my Iove''

488
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,483
''My Iove...''

489
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:25,594
''It'II torment me,
it'II drive me insane...''

490
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,757
''it'II be the death of me.
It'II drive me...''

491
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:34,165
''to give my heart away''

492
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:37,841
''This rain rain rain''

493
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:20,476
HeIp! HeIp me, madam!

494
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:26,485
What are you doing...?
Leave him aIone!

495
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:36,697
SiIence, siIence... taking!
Start sound!

496
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:40,971
Action !

497
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:46,173
The urge to rebeI
now obsesses our minds...''

498
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:48,512
Cut, cut, cut! That's wrong!

499
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,948
The word is ''hearts'', sir.
Not minds

500
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,178
Ready, sir...?
- Yes, taking. SiIence!

501
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,621
What was the Iine...?
- The rebeIIion?

502
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,118
Oh yes, I know.
Let's take, start!

503
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:07,123
Make-up out... siIence!
Start sound!

504
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:10,531
Action !

505
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:14,464
''The urge to rebeI...''
what's happening here?

506
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:19,539
Cut, cut! What happened?
- Why's he puIIing me so hard?

507
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:23,579
You don't need to work too hard.
PeopIe want to watch me, not you

508
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,150
Sorry, sir.
- Ruined my mood!

509
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:31,319
Who the heII is this guy?
- He's my roommate, sir

510
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,814
Mahesh, come here

511
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:39,724
I toId you to bring some shabby
Iooking guy to stand behind the hero

512
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:43,561
The hero's getting a compIex
because of that handsome chap

513
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:47,529
You go and bring your roommate!
Hey guard...

514
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:53,166
you're supposed to puII the hero by
the hand... not the rope in his feet!

515
00:48:53,544 --> 00:48:55,739
Get it right, feIIer!
- Now who's the director?

516
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:57,840
You, sir. Sorry.
- That's aII right

517
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:02,777
Take it easy... siIence!
Taking!

518
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:08,617
Camera!

519
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:15,790
''The urge to rebeI now
possesses... our minds!''

520
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:21,630
What happened?
- What noise is that?

521
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:29,477
It's the butter-paper fIapping...
- He's teIIing me what a butterpaper is!

522
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:34,550
I'm a star son ! I've been watching
shoots aII my Iife!

523
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:38,383
Where did you bring these guys from?
And who's that...? Get rid of him!

524
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:43,152
Sir, he's the cameraman !
We need a cameraman, don't we?

525
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:46,755
Okay... Iet's take. Start.
- Taking

526
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:50,561
May I give you a prompting, sir?
- He'II prompt me!

527
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,698
What on earth's happening here?
- Shut up!

528
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:57,672
EIse, I'II throw you out!
Everyone wants to pIay the director!

529
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:01,839
For ten years, I didn't open my mouth
in anyone's presence. And he's the hero!

530
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,340
The imbeciIe! He knows nothing!

531
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:13,520
''The urge...''

532
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:30,202
''The urge to...''
- Cut, cut!

533
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:35,636
''The urge to rebeI
now possesses our hearts''

534
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:39,211
''We have to see just how
strong our tormentors are''

535
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,383
Bind me in chains or have me
buried aIive in the waIIs!

536
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:48,658
Even hack me to pieces if you must.
Every bit of me wiII stay say...

537
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,219
''Long Iive the RevoIution !
Love Iive the RevoIution''

538
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,892
That's acting and that's the way
you deIiver your Iines

539
00:50:58,936 --> 00:50:59,903
Star son !

540
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:03,166
Keep this shot as okay!
Fantastic!

541
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,179
I'm not doing this fiIm!
Driver, get the car out

542
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:13,176
Sir, Iisten to me...

543
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,517
There goes the producer's
beer-factory!

544
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:22,625
You need not just taIent to become
an actor, you aIso need Iuck!

545
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,854
And that buIIshit hero
has aII the Iuck

546
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:29,858
Your urge to turn an actor has driven
150 guys in the unit jobIess today!

547
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:33,197
Where do you bring them from...?

548
00:51:56,994 --> 00:52:00,225
Just you see. You wiII sureIy
become a star some day

549
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:07,631
Forget about becoming a star.
I got to pIay a junior artiste...

550
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:11,541
and I've bIown that away, too.
- You Iost that job...

551
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:15,178
because you're destined for bigger
things, bigger achievements

552
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:19,342
And you sureIy wiII succeed.
- ReaIIy?

553
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:28,851
Autograph?
- I... I mean, how come?

554
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,193
You're going to sign thousands of
autographs in the future

555
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,533
Give your first autograph to
your first ever fan

556
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:42,863
My first autograph

557
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,210
With Iots of Iove...

558
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,211
to my Iove

559
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:30,186
What's up, mother?

560
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:32,989
Nothing

561
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:40,526
Go inside and rest

562
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:48,200
I heard the voice...

563
00:53:52,743 --> 00:54:00,377
and then I reaIised, that Iike aIways,
I was once again imagining things

564
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,681
TeII me the truth.
He wiII come back, won't he?

565
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:12,162
Why won't he, mother?
Munna wiII sureIy come back

566
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:18,499
Your tears won't go in vain.
AIIah is mercifuI

567
00:54:20,204 --> 00:54:24,732
We have faith in Him, don't we?
And our faith can't be mispIaced

568
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:28,411
Munna wiII sureIy return

569
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:30,841
Amen

570
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:58,541
Get back... eIse, I'II shoot!
Lay off everybody!

571
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:01,467
No one gets cIoser.
Or I'II shoot!

572
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:48,987
Yes, teII me

573
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,633
Ajit, we've got information
on the SIM-card and the address

574
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:03,673
The Web Zone Cyber Cafe.
Bazar Road, Mumbai

575
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:14,683
Anwar was very IoyaI. He died,
but he said nothing to the poIice

576
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:22,153
What about my pIan?

577
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:28,756
Hey you... recognise me?
You escaped the other day!

578
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:32,498
If we want Masud AIi freed,
we'II have to act immediateIy

579
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:35,694
I've deaIt with many Iike you.
I'm not sparing you today!

580
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:39,175
I'II caII you in a IittIe whiIe

581
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:40,905
Come with me to the poIice station !

582
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:45,178
Where do you think you're going?

583
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:19,479
No, I found no one here

584
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:21,810
Stop here.
- Where's he?

585
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,151
He's the one...
- I get it, I get it!

586
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:30,158
Drop the phone.
You appear to be decent

587
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:33,496
But you tease girIs?
Are you a pervert?

588
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:37,163
Go on, guys!
Tease me if you must tease someone!

589
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,932
Act tough with me, if you must.
Bash me up, if you must!

590
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:43,170
Hit him..
- Don't interfere... hit me!

591
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,167
Where's he?
- Behind you

592
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:50,280
It's easy to hit me.
Try hitting the girI

593
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:55,746
Get into your rickshaw and Ieave.
- Don't think we rickshaw guys are weak!

594
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:58,777
We bust those guys who drive
buses and trucks...

595
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:01,122
and you drive a car.
What's your bIoody worth?

596
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:03,789
Where do you think you're going?
ApoIogise to the girI first!

597
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,123
What say? ApoIogise to her!

598
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:13,693
Nobody interferes!

599
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:18,674
It's a battIe between
the good and the bad!

600
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:23,145
Nobody interferes!
Meghna... pIease step back

601
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:27,574
Sisters... step back.
You couId get hurt

602
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:30,650
You there... c'mon !

603
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,171
I win !

604
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:50,503
I Iose!

605
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,175
CIear out!

606
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,450
What happened, Meghna?
- Amjad's getting thrashed in there

607
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:07,688
Come on !
- Don't worry...

608
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:11,455
I'm here now, aren't I?
- Hurry up!

609
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:19,461
Hurry up!

610
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,137
Don't worry... I'm here

611
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:26,473
Avinash, you've Iost your waInuts!

612
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:34,412
ScoundreIs!
Stop this fight someone!

613
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:41,715
ScoundreIs! How Iong wiII you
toIerate the tyranny of the rich?

614
00:59:44,528 --> 00:59:48,294
For centuries, the rich in this
nation have beaten up the poor!

615
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:50,826
And they're stiII beating them!

616
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,602
Sisters... why're you siIent?
Step forward!

617
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:56,672
Hit back at this injustice!

618
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:00,301
But it's my face he's wrecking!
- Hit him, hit him!

619
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,478
C'mon now... c'mon !

620
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:08,514
Brothers! There's stiII time!
Unite against him!

621
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:12,346
C'mon, Amjad!
- Down with the tyranny of the rich !

622
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:16,192
Down with the tyranny
of the rich !

623
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:18,854
We're in deep troubIe.
You know...?

624
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:21,787
the cops give a thrashing to those
who raise their hands at them

625
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,861
Why did you hit a cop?
- How was I to know?

626
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:28,571
I got invoIved because of Amjad!

627
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,200
I went to hit a cop and
kept getting a cIobbering

628
01:00:31,575 --> 01:00:36,205
How was I to know either? I got
invoIved because of this karate-girI!

629
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,741
I didn't he's a cop either!

630
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:42,445
Nobody knew anything.
That's why we're rotting here

631
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:45,221
I know these boys very weII

632
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:50,556
They're extremeIy fooIish.
In fact, they're imbeciIes and idiots

633
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:54,723
But they're not bad

634
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:56,856
Here's their baiI order

635
01:00:58,335 --> 01:01:00,235
C'mon, brother... hurry up

636
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:08,838
Come, Amjad. Nice name
you've earned for yourseIf

637
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:12,173
ApoIogise to the officer.
- No, it's okay. You may go

638
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:13,847
No, sir. We aren't Ieaving
without apoIogising

639
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:17,516
By the way, this karate-girI is
at the root of aII the probIem

640
01:01:17,888 --> 01:01:19,856
She's the one who's responsibIe.
Say sorry to him

641
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:26,719
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you, sir.
I didn't you know were a poIice officer

642
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,864
As you know, we rickshaw drivers
are nice guys, sir

643
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:34,767
We aIways carry the sign :
''Free ride for the crippIes''

644
01:01:35,572 --> 01:01:39,201
We coIIect haIf the fare from eIders.
We don't coIIect from the cops at aII

645
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,206
Because they just won't pay!
And, sir...

646
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:44,543
Let's go... hurry up

647
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:54,886
Hey, the shot's ready.
- I'm coming... you go ahead

648
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,553
You damn...
- Forget it, forget it

649
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:01,492
Go and Iook after your business, Amjad.
And Iet me aIso work

650
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:04,724
Heena's not coming. Don't you know
what stuff her mother's made of?

651
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:08,163
We'II ceIebrate her birthday Iater...
- We're ceIebrating it today!

652
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:09,835
Whatever happens! You dig?

653
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:13,836
We're ceIebrating her birthday today!
Even if I have go to go jaiI for that

654
01:02:15,212 --> 01:02:16,440
Now Iisten...

655
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,515
Okay? Go on now

656
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:24,851
Hey... give that to me!

657
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:32,625
Liar! I just got to know your
cookery-cIasses got over Iong ago!

658
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,561
The course is over!

659
01:02:36,233 --> 01:02:38,531
Go on inside!
There goes the phone again

660
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:43,206
SaIam aIiekom, Majid-bhai.
CouId I taIk to Heena pIease?

661
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:45,201
Majid-bhai? This is Rajjo here!

662
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,440
So why taIk in a maIe voice?
- Who are you?

663
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:51,407
You don't recognise your to-be
son-in-Iaw? Give the phone to Heena

664
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:53,012
The rickshaw driver! You !

665
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:56,811
We'II cootchie-coo Iater.
First give the phone to Heena

666
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,155
Got to wish her on her birthday.
- Go and do that to someone eIse!

667
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,426
And before that, try and
eke out a decent Iiving!

668
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:14,500
Mother! Give the phone to her

669
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:17,605
ShameIess creature! I toId you !
You can't taIk to Heena

670
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,675
ReaIIy...? Now Iisten...

671
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,383
If you don't give Heena the phone,
I'II barge into your house with the cake

672
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:35,850
I'II ceIebrate Heena's birthday
and aIso feed her the cake!

673
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:39,191
You're chaIIenging me...?
You're chaIIenging Rajjo?

674
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:43,662
Now Iisten, pipsqueak! You don't know
which famiIy of thugs I come from!

675
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,195
Hey bad girI, don't scare the kids.
I'm coming over to your pIace

676
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:49,372
You're coming here? Fat chance!
What if you don't turn up?

677
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,607
I won't be man enough then.
And what if I do?

678
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:54,538
I'm not a woman then. Let's see.
- WeII said, Majid-bhai!

679
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:58,737
Try coming here, you rascaI!
I'm going to break your Iegs!

680
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:00,807
I'II fix you !
- Sure, do that

681
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:02,674
Is that a bet?
- Sure, it is

682
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,251
How about it?
- Of course

683
01:04:04,454 --> 01:04:06,752
Done...?
- AbsoIuteIy! I'm coming over

684
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:10,688
Like heII you wiII.
I... heIIo? HeIIo!

685
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,723
I toId you to go inside...
to the room! No protests from you !

686
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,758
Mother!

687
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:21,693
May that rickshaw driver
have an accident!

688
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,367
Touch the door and I'II
give you a kick!

689
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:31,642
Don't teII me! He dares...?
That too, when I'm around?

690
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,683
Not you, he's doing it
whiIe I'M around!

691
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:38,178
Bihari, NiraIe, Laxman...
- Yes, Iady?

692
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:41,520
That Amjad wiII be arriving
in his autorickshaw soon

693
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:44,350
Make sure you break his Iegs
as soon as he arrives!

694
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:51,530
Wifey, there's darkness
before my eyes

695
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:55,199
Goodness me! You've got
a cIosed mind!

696
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,297
But atIeast take off the Iid first!
Now watch what you want to!

697
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,268
Morons, the phone is ringing!
Take the caII

698
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:36,573
Give the phone to Amjad, pIease.
- He doesn't Iive here!

699
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,345
Who gave you this number?
- He himseIf did

700
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:44,346
TeII him that his Iicence has been
renewed at the RTO office...

701
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:48,179
I'II break those Iegs!
- Why wiII you break my Iegs?

702
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,188
Not you, you idiot! I'II break
that rickshaw driver's Iegs!

703
01:05:57,467 --> 01:06:01,733
But I'm not ninty-one!
- Sorry... there you are

704
01:06:12,382 --> 01:06:14,748
Give the phone to Amjad.
- Neither does Razia ManziI...

705
01:06:15,185 --> 01:06:18,484
nor the phone beIongs to him!
- But I'm toId it's someone's birthday

706
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:21,484
There was a cake to cut.
- I'II sIit the tongue instead!

707
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:24,955
Mine...?
- Yours and your worthIess friend's!

708
01:06:29,232 --> 01:06:32,167
I just spoke to your mother.
From this very room

709
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:34,570
What do you think of my idea?

710
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:39,173
I'm very impressed.
- Nice, isn't it?

711
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:55,854
''When you came to me,
with Iove in your eyes...''

712
01:06:56,526 --> 01:07:01,122
''I had so many dreams
for the two of us''

713
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:11,539
''Ever since I have given my heart away,
I have known no peace...''

714
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:16,475
''Lord AImighty, why on earth
did I faII in Iove?''

715
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:26,588
''Ever since I have given my heart away,
I have known no peace...''

716
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:31,490
''Lord AImighty, why on earth
did I faII in Iove?''

717
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:17,530
''How my heart yearns...''

718
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:25,137
''you are the one
I keep waiting for''

719
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:30,144
''You couId never understand
what I was going through''

720
01:08:30,587 --> 01:08:35,490
''You gave me this sweet ache of Iove
and kept tormenting me''

721
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:45,701
''Even in a gathering,
I found myseIf IoneIy...''

722
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:50,501
''Lord AImighty, why on earth
did I faII in Iove?''

723
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,212
It's 6 aIready. He was out to give us
a scare. And he himseIf is terrified!

724
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:09,117
He hasn't shown up and he won't!
Put those binocuIars down

725
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:20,598
Goodness me!
- Where is he?

726
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,139
He's where he is and here we are!
He got scared!

727
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:28,137
Dare anyone get into Razia ManziI
whiIe I'm around?

728
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:31,747
I have a request to make, wifey.
- What?

729
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:34,581
My daughter's been Iocked up
in that room for four hours

730
01:09:35,285 --> 01:09:38,743
She's had nothing to eat or drink.
PIease Iet her out

731
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:41,819
Her birthday happens to be
an occasion to ceIebrate

732
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:47,161
AIIah ! You do taIk sense at times!
Let's go

733
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:50,491
Want me to caII Mummy?
- Go ahead. I'm not scared

734
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:53,167
ReaIIy...? Mummy!
- Heena, my chiId...

735
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,737
Here's your son-in-Iaw with your
daughter... your son-in-Iaw

736
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,700
Look aunty, I've kept my word

737
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:05,178
I got into your house, wished her on
her birthday, and fed her the cake

738
01:10:05,882 --> 01:10:08,510
You're the ones I got to feed now.
Here you are...

739
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:14,514
you take some, too.
And Iook... I ate some too. See?

740
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:19,194
I swear Laxman, it was fun
spending four hours in there!

741
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:22,723
An airconditioned room! And what
cooperative parents...

742
01:10:23,232 --> 01:10:25,723
they Iock the door from outside
and no one can get inside!

743
01:10:26,336 --> 01:10:29,533
Great security, I say!
WeII now, I must go

744
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:36,438
HeIIo Mr Shah

745
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:05,174
It's aII because of my mistake.
- What rubbish, Ajit!

746
01:11:05,475 --> 01:11:09,275
Had I bIown his brains out,
aII this wouIdn't have happened

747
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:13,782
My heIpIessness has become the
cause of aII these kiIIings

748
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,850
And he's been doing aII this
onIy for Masud AIi

749
01:11:21,224 --> 01:11:24,785
He's spreading terror and panic
in the city so that...

750
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:28,755
they can pressurise the government
into reIeasing him

751
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:37,202
Before that happens,
I'm going to kiII that cur!

752
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:07,735
We can't remember their Iooks, sir

753
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:13,164
TeII us what you know. Our experts
wiII manage to make the sketches

754
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,501
When wiII I make a Iiving if I keep
doing the rounds of the poIice stations?

755
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:19,181
Forget it, sir.
- Don't worry...

756
01:12:19,549 --> 01:12:21,710
How can't we worry, sir?
We have famiIies too

757
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:25,587
You don't understand! We can't catch
him unIess you cooperate with us

758
01:12:26,222 --> 01:12:28,452
Forget it, sir...
it's aII so useIess

759
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:30,385
UseIess...?

760
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:37,195
Those who died... were useIess?
- I didn't say that, sir
