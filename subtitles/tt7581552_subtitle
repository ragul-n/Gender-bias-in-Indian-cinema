1
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey! Give me that spray. 
- I'll give the spray.

2
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,000
But underwear... 
That you should buy your own.

3
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,680
Let my movie release. 
I'll show you!

4
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,260
Didn't you pack everything? 
- Yes.

5
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,940
It's the first time 
I'm going so far.

6
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
I have gone.

7
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,290
To Kashmir.

8
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
It was so cold there! 
- Get me that bag, sir.

9
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,550
Did you have food?

10
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
No?

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,460
Did you eat? 
- No.

12
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
What is it?

13
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Sir...

14
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,160
You're always on the phone, huh?

15
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,190
Nothing like that, sir.

16
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,870
Don't you know to eat quietly? 
- Yes.

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay sir.

18
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Sir...

19
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Company, Attention!

20
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,240
Grip Arms!

21
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,270
Present Arms!

22
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,070
Order Arms!

23
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,360
Stand at ease!

24
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Stand easy.

25
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,630
How many of you are going on 
other-state duty for the first time?

26
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,370
When we go on duty to another state, 
the first thing we should be careful about,

27
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,620
... is that others shouldn't 
talk ill about us.

28
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,300
Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh...

29
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,590
After that, Jharkhand.

30
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,950
You'll have a duty of 
40 days, in total.

31
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Bad behaviour, boozing... 
None of this is allowed.

32
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,880
It's our responsibility to uphold the 
honour of Kerala Police & our Government.

33
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,380
And most importantly, you should 
be very careful with the arms.

34
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,040
Use them only if its necessary.

35
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,020
Don't create trouble for me by complaining 
that bullets and Lathi sticks are missing!

36
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,660
And all of you should be 
aware of the election rules.

37
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,140
We are also participants in it.

38
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,670
Not as candidates...

39
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
But as policemen.

40
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,830
That is our duty.

41
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,110
Okay then.

42
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,210
All the best.

43
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,700
Company, Attention!

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,090
Grip Arms!

45
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,500
Move to the right in threes.

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,090
Right turn!

47
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,600
'Unda' 
(Bullet)

48
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,890
Passengers, please 
pay attention.

49
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Train No. 22648

50
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,220
The special train from 
Thiruvananthapuram to Korba,

51
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,630
is arriving on platform number 2.

52
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,530
Don't forget anything.

53
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,160
Check once more if you 
have taken everything.

54
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,630
Come on, fast.

55
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,910
Here. 
Which one?

56
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,050
This one?

57
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,730
Enough. 
Move!

58
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,300
Don't crowd around. 
- Hey Girish!

59
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,550
Which one?

60
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,530
Get me that bag.

61
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,580
That blue one.

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,610
Why are you putting 
this between my legs?

63
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,860
Come on!

64
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,390
Why, man?

65
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,390
He's coming between my 
legs in the morning itself!

66
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,520
Get up! 
Come.

67
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,870
What happened, sir?

68
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,710
- Nothing. It's just gas. 
- Must be due to the long journey.

69
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,760
Anyway, the trip here was great.

70
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,310
We should have fun while going back.

71
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,930
Good, anyway. 
- A sound came from here.

72
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
What was it?

73
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,510
We are from Kerala. 
For election duty.

74
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,060
I am Mathukkutty. 
Commanding officer.

75
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,890
You think this is funny?

76
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,870
Don't know where they land up from, 
to trouble us early in the morning!

77
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,260
Come on!

78
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,290
Who is he?

79
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,390
We were told to uphold our honour, 
and lost it as soon as we came!

80
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,430
So we'll have fun while coming back! 
So see you there!

81
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,450
Okay!

82
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,600
- Our party has two ideologies.

83
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
- First...

84
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,360
- A new India, where all our brothers 
& sisters live happily, without fear.

85
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,910
- Second...

86
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,080
- To make women join banks...

87
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,180
- and to bring prosperity 
to their lives.

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,640
- Our Government promises 
to work day and night...

89
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,240
See, we've been waiting 
here for last 3 hours.

90
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,450
Where is the vehicle?

91
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,460
We didn't know that 
you were coming.

92
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,660
It will take some more time.

93
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,620
- Employment for the youth...

94
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,200
- This has always been part 
of our Government's schemes.

95
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,550
Do you have tablets for gas trouble? 
- No, sir.

96
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,930
Where is Mani?

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,550
Haven't seen him 
since we reached.

98
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I'll go and check.

99
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,090
- They say one thing...

100
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,970
- ... and do something else.

101
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,720
- The entire country knows about 
their double crossing nature.

102
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,800
Those who rule us by murdering 
their own people,

103
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,800
- what do they know about 
the country's progress?

104
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,420
- We believe in our country's 
progress and are working towards it.

105
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,080
- Brothers & sisters,

106
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,140
- they are saying that they 
will give us petrol for 40 Rupees.

107
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,650
- They promise to eliminate 
black money from the country.

108
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,080
- We would never come before 
you depending on lies.

109
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,810
- For the past 60 years,

110
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,740
- how our Government has strived for 
the country's progress day and night,

111
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,620
- to let that progress continue,

112
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,490
- all of you,

113
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,030
- should cast your valuable votes,

114
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,590
- and like in every election,

115
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,150
Why are you smiling, sir?

116
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,570
Nothing.

117
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,570
One guy was trying to pick 
another man's pocket over there.

118
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,720
He gave it back & left, 
when he saw me.

119
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,480
Why didn't you catch him then?

120
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
What thief is he!

121
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,790
There are much 
bigger thieves here.

122
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
That's true.

123
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,560
When is your wife's delivery date?

124
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,590
Sometime this week.

125
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,690
They haven't told 
us the exact date.

126
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,690
You should have been there now.

127
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,890
I've asked Teacher to 
go and check on her.

128
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,340
I asked for a leave so 
many days back, sir.

129
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,180
I was forcefully included 
in the last minute.

130
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
What can we do, man!

131
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,540
Sir.. 
Mathews sir is calling you.

132
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,590
Coming.

133
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,780
Won't you go to buy the wedding chain 
& gold with my family in two days?

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,040
Nimmy, listen to me. Pay the advance 
for the gold first. - Click my photo.

135
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
Hey! Come. 
- Then you can tell the rest to dad...

136
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,550
Just a minute.

137
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,090
My dear Nimmy, first you listen to me.

138
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,000
You, your family and my 
family can go and buy it.

139
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,710
It's just gold and Sarees, right? 
I can't skip my duty for that, right?

140
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,510
Click it!

141
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,700
He hasn't spoken to me till now.

142
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,540
He's right here, but he's avoiding me. 
- It's not bad.

143
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,510
What can I do if he doesn't talk to me?

144
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,650
Will we be stranded on the streets, 
after coming for election duty?

145
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Where were you, Mani?

146
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,710
It's been 2-3 days since I relieved 
myself. So I got that done first.

147
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,930
You could have done that in 
the train, right? - Oh no!

148
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,570
Do you have tablets 
for gas trouble?

149
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,380
You want it? 
I'll bring it now.

150
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,620
Why are you sitting 
away from everyone?

151
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
Hey!

152
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Sir...

153
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,370
Sir.. The bag...

154
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Sit! Sit!

155
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,430
I have to get hold of you.

156
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,570
Your mother had come & met 
me before we came here.

157
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,590
What did she say, sir?

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,940
I'll tell you.

159
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,850
I told that 'Rat' a hundred times, 
to avoid me from this.

160
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,810
He has such a weird nature!

161
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,710
I'll get hold of him when 
we leave to the next camp.

162
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,440
I'll hit him nicely then. 
- Move your leg, sir.

163
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,560
Stop it, sir! He's sad that 
his wife left him. - When?

164
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,200
It's been a while. 
- Yes.

165
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,510
Let that woman escape!

166
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
Enough. 
Give it here.

167
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,760
So what, sir?

168
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,190
We had fun during the trip. 
It was good fun, right?

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,530
What trip, man!

170
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,780
Can we do any of this 
with Mani sir's knowledge?

171
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,340
We should plan 
without him knowing.

172
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,010
He'll always talk about duty!

173
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,540
Here... Well, that sir.. 
We will... Give it here.

174
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,270
We will pour him into 
a bottle like this...

175
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,750
and have it at once! 
That's all!

176
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,960
Cheers!

178
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
Asianet?

179
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,990
Sir, it's on Asianet. 
They are watching.

180
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,540
There's no problem here.

181

182
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,530
On a channel in Kerala. 
Asianet.

183
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,540
One group of Kerala 
Police has reported to

184
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,310
Bastar, one of the most dangerous 
Maoist affected red belts in India.

185
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,100
They are saying that there are 
many Maoists there, Kunjetta.

186
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,860
There aren't any Maoists here.

187
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,700
There's no problem.

188
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,770
We just reached here.

189
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,750
We're waiting for a ride.

190
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,100
It's our Appu's birthday. 
I'll pass the phone to him.

191
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Appu...

192
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,740
Happy Birthday Appu, dear...

193
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,000
Say 'Thank you'. 
- Thank you.

194
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,530
You should buy a shirt for him.

195
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,420
- Sir, the vehicle is here. 
- Okay.

196
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I'll call you later.

197
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Hey! Hey!

198
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,070
Our ride is here. 
Come.

199
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,450
Did you understand what I said?

200
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,810
They told us to uphold 
Kerala Police's honour...

201
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,840
And should we uphold our honour in this 
vehicle that carries bulls & buffaloes?

202
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,720
Yeah, man! 
It's so hot!

203
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,000
And this place called Bastar...

204
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,670
It's a huge area.

205
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,730
It's a place almost 
as big as Kerala.

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,850
- Is it? 
- Yes.

207
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,710
It's a centre of granite businessmen.

208
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,120
There are many rich people here.

209
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,800
And thus, there are Maoists too.

210
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,930
I hope this gets done...

211
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
... without much trouble.

212
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,080
There won't be any trouble. 
Don't you see their happiness?

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,370
They are so happy.

214
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,450
They think they are going 
for some excursion.

215
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,700

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,110

219
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,930

220
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,200

221
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Sir...

222
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,950
Hello.

223
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
Mathews.

224
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,300
Come.

225
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,570
It will come out like a Tsunami, 
after holding it back for so long.

226
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,450
Oh my God! 
Sir, wire!

227
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,020
Sir, electric wire!

228
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,850
We would have died now.

Bloody hell!

230
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,750
The set up is awesome here, right?

231
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,030
What set up, man?

232
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,510
It's a little bigger 
than our Idukky camp.

233
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,000
That's not what I am thinking. 
Where will they go to watch a movie?

234
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,310
Get going! 
Go and sit there.

235

you keeping it in your mind?

Mani...

239
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,650
They are saying that they don't have the 
facility for all of us to stay here.

240
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,370
There are 4-5 days 
left for the election.

241
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,210
What are they saying, sir?

242
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Where will we stay then?

243
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,760
After saying that they will 
make all the arrangements?

244
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,240
They said they will arrange some booth. 
Let's talk, come.

245
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,090
Whom are you trying to 
scare with this divorce?

246
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,310
Ask her to talk to me directly.

247
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Pass the phone to her.

248
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Sir...

249
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,030
Why can't she talk?

250
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm not the only 
one who did wrong.

251
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,500
Ask her to talk now 
if she wants to.

252
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,860
I've come on duty to 
an area which has Maoists.

253
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,830
I don't even know if you 
can reach me hereafter.

254
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Do whatever you want!

255
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,510
Mani sir is calling you.

256
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,550
Where?

257
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,280
Troop A & B, get on that truck.

258
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
We're leaving from here.

259
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
So it's not here, sir?

260
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,020
Sir, shall I set up the mess? 
- No.

261

Ask everyone to get ready fast. 
- Sir.

262
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Hold it carefully.

263
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960

was better than this.

What happened?

265
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,530
It's a puncture, sir.

tools to remove the tyre.

length from each other.

What is this for, sir?

284
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,070
ITBP people are saying that there might 
be land-mines buried on the way.

285
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,040
If we go like this, 
only the truck would explode.

Nothing would happen to us.

287

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,170

- There are mines.

- Mines?

292

- Mines? - Yes.

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,760
Please don't come!

356
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,570
Hey!

357
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,590
Can you hear a sound?

358
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

359
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,570
That's from my stomach.

360
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,520
It's due to hunger!

361
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,150
It's been a long time since we 
sat together like this, right?

362
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
It's been really long.

363
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,970
Last time was during 
Sabarimala duty.

364
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,550
This is such a damned place!

365
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,880
Our place is heaven 
compared to this, right?

366
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,930
Why, sir? 
This is also our country, right?

367
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,630
I was talking about Kerala.

368
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,230
Is there any house without 
a toilet in our state?

369
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,010
Or else, it must be a tribal's house.

370
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,150
Your houses won't 
have toilets, right?

371
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,950
We consider shitting inside 
the house a bad thing, sir.

372
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,030
Hey!

373
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,870
Why are you wasting water?

374
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,790
Those villagers are waiting for water.

375
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,190
The pipe isn't going anywhere, right?

376
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,700
They can use it after 
our use, right?

377
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,160
This pipe is for them. 
They need water.

378
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,890
And you're bathing here?

379
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,740
What's wrong with him?

380
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,870
Sir.

381
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,210
What's the issue between 
you and your wife, sir?

382
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,670
Naushad, you take bath first.

383
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,560
I'll tell you the rest later.

384
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,150
Parade, roll call. 
Attention.

385
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,900
Dressing, by the right.

386
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Number.

387
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,080
Everyone has reported, sir.

388
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,850
Assign duties for each of them. 
- Okay sir.

389
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,760
Roll Call. 
Stand at ease.

390
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
Stand easy.

391
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,550
Noushad & Gokulan will be on guard 
duty in the morning. - Sir.

392
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,340
In the afternoon, Bijukumar & 
Girish should join. - Sir.

393
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,060
Does anyone else have 
to say anything?

394
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,900
[speaking in local language]

395
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,350
Because of you guys, 
they didn't get water.

396
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,180
He has been annoying us 
for a long time now.

397
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,830
Don't you understand Hindi? 
- What?

398
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,120
Sir, you haven't been beaten up by 
Haryana guys, right? - No. - That's why!

399
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,600
Does anyone bathe like this? 
- What is it?

400
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Nothing, sir.

401
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,230
Wasted all the water.

402
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,670
Use it wisely! 
Very little!

403
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,930
There's a scarcity here.

404
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Girish...

405
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,590
Before getting married,

406
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,290
it's good to learn the experiences 
from those who're married.

407
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,630
Each one's experience would 
be different, right sir?

408
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
It's not like that.

409
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,230
All husbands go through 
the same experience.

410
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,810
You'll understand that 
after you get married.

411
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,050
Why do you say so, sir?

412
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,450
Play, if you're playing.

413
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,210
Who crossed it?

414
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,160
- It's so hot. - Not the heat. I'll 
become dark. That's the problem.

415
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
What is it, sir?

416
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,400
I was trying to open this.

417
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,010
There is space.

418
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,760
If we clean this up, 
we can keep all our stuff here.

419
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
Okay sir.

420
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,060
Who is coming now?

421
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,910
It's the food, man!

422
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,450
I'm really hungry.

423
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Bring it. 
- Take it.

424
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,950
Thank you.

425
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,620
Keeping it inside, right? 
- Let's eat.

426
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,250
Doesn't he want anything to eat?

427
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,060
No need to be scared. 
It's our food.

428
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,760
I don't think this place is as 
dangerous as we thought, sir.

429
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
How do you know that?

430
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,710
We've just come, right?

431
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,830
Did you eat? 
- I'll eat, sir.

432
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
No one on duty?

433
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,110
You can have breakfast, 
but two people should be on duty too.

434
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,800
He hasn't liked us 
coming here, sir.

435
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,630
I think he told that 
yesterday to scare us.

436
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,050
What will he get by scaring us?

437
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,180
Sir, what will do if these 
Maoists actually come here?

438
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,150
Are you even a policeman?

439
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
If the Maoists come, 
we should defend ourselves.

440
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,490
Be practical, sir.

441
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,790
To defend, they're not 
college students on strike.

442
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,790
To be frank, I don't know 
how to fire with this gun.

443
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,900
My hands shiver when I touch it.

444
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,010
What were you taught 
during fire training?

445
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,190
How should you fire?

446
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Say it. 
Let me hear it.

447
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,610
Well...

448
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
You say it.

449
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,260
Stand in the armed position, 
take a breath,

450
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,860
close the left eye, and look at 
the point through the right eye.

451
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,050
- If the attention gets diverted, 
look to the nearest...... - And...

452
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,220
... take another breath,

453
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,680
close your left eye,

454
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,220
look at the point, 
and fire!

455
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,140
That's all. 
Don't laugh.

456
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Sir...

457
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,790
Has Kerala Police ever done a 
shoot-out, like we see in the movies?

458
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
No way!

459
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,850
Apart from firing at someone,

460
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,540
there's no history of anyone 
firing at our police.

461
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,500
I just want to be appointed 
to a station somehow.

462
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,160
Then we won't have to 
do such jobs, right?

463
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,540
My dear...

464
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,390
A police station is 
nothing short of a hell.

465
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,980
This camp of ours is so 
much better than that.

466
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,560
If you go to the police station, 
your whole nature would change!

467
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,890
Why do you hate the police 
station so much, sir?

468
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,060
Have any of you... 
No. You might not have...

469
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,030
Have any of you been kept 
in a police station?

470
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
For 2 days?

471
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Me too, sir.

472
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,050
Have you been beaten up?

473
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,090
- That's what!

474
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,370
Why were you kept there, sir?

475
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,520
That old stabbing case, right sir?

476
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,480
Stabbing case? 
- Yes.

477
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,990
It's an old story.

478
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,150
Before I joined the police.

479
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,650
I was jobless after 
passing SSLC in school.

480
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,990
I used to work at a 
mill in Kothamangalam.

481
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,370
And the food was 
at a house nearby.

482
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,650
One mother and two children.

483
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,060
The dishes that woman made 
were really tasty! Delicious!

484
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,810
The children were also well behaved.

485
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,310
I hadn't had any close 
interactions with families, right?

486
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,480
This was the first time.

487
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,010
I was like a son to her though.

488
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,670
So one guy in town 
was really jealous.

489
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,150
He spread rumours 
about them and me.

490
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,920
I didn't feel angry, 
but sad hearing that.

491
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,990
How can he say that?

492
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,090
Isn't it bad?

493
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,530
I got him at the field during a rain. 
I gave it to him nicely!

494
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,170
I was at the police station 
for 3 days, for that case.

495
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,630
Every policeman who came and went, 
hit me, without even asking the matter.

496
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,630
He didn't die, anyway.

497
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,780
You didn't have anything 
towards any of them there?

498
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,830
Nothing like that.

499
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,690
But, I used to like...

500
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,070
... the elder daughter.

501
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Where is she now, sir?

502
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,130
She is in my house now. 
My wife, Lalitha.

503
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,650
In spite of hating it so much, 
why did you join the police, sir?

504
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,060
It's life, man!

505
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,030
Not just police. 
We might have to do any job!

506
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,470
That's why I wrote to them saying 
that I'll stay in the camp!

507
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,820
Over here, I can joke around 
with you guys, right?

508
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What book is it, sir?

509
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,300
Is it a comedy book?

510
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,500
Yeah! It's a great comedy!

511
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,270
It's about life.

512
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,850
If I become dark, 
I won't get a chance to act in movies, sir.

513
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,970
- I played.

514
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,050
Unni sir, your turn.

515
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,320
Not mine. 
Jojo sir's.

516
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,890
Will you cross it.. or? 
- Sheesh! Gone!

517
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,270
Namaste, sir.

518
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,550
My name is Kunalchand.

519
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,570
I am from this locality.

520
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,340
I teach in this school.

521
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,380
Today, the villagers 
didn't get water.

522
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,570
Because you people used up all the water.

523
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,180
If it goes on like this, 
it will be really difficult for us.

524
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,890
Please ask your team 
to use less water.

525
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,120
Sir, he is a teacher here.

526
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,400
He's saying that the water in the pipe 
got over, since all of us took bath.

527
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,720
And he's asking us to be careful while 
using water, from tomorrow onwards.

528
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,930
Okay.

529
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
We will be careful.

530
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
Definitely!

531
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,750
Come. 
- Okay sir.

532
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,420
Sir... 
Jojo sir...

533
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Give me the cards.

534
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,610
Come. 
Sit.

535
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,510
What's the point in helping these locals?

536
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,270
Let Mani sir do what he wants.

537
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
You play, sir.

538
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,180
This will be solved if you 
pour some water into it.

539
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,430
It's an air-block.

540
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,820
These guys can't be trusted.

541
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,760
Who knows what kind 
of people they are!

542
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,900
Go and bring the water container.

543
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,550
Go!

544
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,800
Sir, don't we need 
water to drink then?

545
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,400
Let's solve their problem first.

546
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,860
Give me some water.

547
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,110
Where is his house?

548
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,130
Where is your house?

549
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,690
Over there.

550
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,880
We used to live here earlier.

551
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
Here? 
Where over here?

552
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,970
People like you came one day...

553
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,200
... and chased us away.

554
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,880
Since then, we live there.

555
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
What?

556
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,090
Do you have any idea 
where you have come?

557
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,240
I haven't seen such an 
irresponsible team till date!

558
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,970
I didn't expect this from Kerala Police.

559
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,020
You're in the worst Maoist 
affected area in India.

560
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,270
A Maoist group has threatened...

561
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,080
... that they won't let 
the elections happen.

562
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,880
They can attack anytime!

563
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,110
Vincent, explain it to them!

564
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,400
This is one of the places where the most 
number of Naxal attacks happen in India.

565
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,710
There are a bunch of 
Maoists who claim that

566
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,670
they won't let this election 
happen at any cost.

567
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,920
We didn't think that you would come 
here and behave so irresponsibly.

568
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,620
We didn't take this photo.

569
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,060
The Naxalites took this.

570
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Look at this!

571
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,760
What is your weapon backing?

572
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,820
Where are your bullet proof 
jackets and metal detectors?

573
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,880
Sir, we have SLR guns and 10 rounds.

574
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,970
Then Lathi, jackets and shields.

575
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,620
Only that many bullets?

576
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,030
What will you do after that?

577
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,170
They will eat & sleep, sir.

578
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,410
What else will they do? 
They have come here for that!

579
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,680
Have you come here to shoot 
crows & parrots?

580
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,130
Are you @%@@^?

581
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,590
How can your Government 
be so careless?

582
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,250
Those were all cuss words!

583
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,730
We were told that the rest of the 
arrangements would be made from here.

584
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,490
Sir, they were told that the weapons 
are going to be supplied by us.

585
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,310
What?

586
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,670
You were called here to help us!

587
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,420
And now we have to help you?

588
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,060
I don't know what to do.

589
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,790
Tell your Government,

590
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,620
to send everything that 
you require over here.

591
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,530
And from tomorrow, 
all of you...

592
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,700
will go on route march.

593
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
And be alert!

594
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,050
They've all come here to die!

595
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,190
Sir, the matter is really serious.

596
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,030
This place is not like 
what you think it is.

597
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,390
Contact your Government,

598
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,600
and ask them to send everything 
that you require, at the earliest.

599
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,540
Okay.

600
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,630
Good luck, sir.

601
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,850
So it's true, right sir?

602
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,080
Then? Do you think 
he was joking?

603
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
What do we do now, sir?

604
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,850
Let me try calling Mathews sir.

605
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,200
Whose phone has a signal here?

606
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,510
Only BSNL has signal here.

607
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,350
Kapil Dev uses a BSNL phone, sir.

608
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,700
Try asking him.

609
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Hello.

610
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,750
Who?

611
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,610
Mani... 
Tell me.

612
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,790
Sir, an ITBP officer had come here.

613
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,870
He's saying that the amenities 
with us, are not enough.

614
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
What should I do, sir?

615
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,570
They had told the same to me too.

616
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,260
I thought that they were joking.

617
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,630
Sir, I didn't feel 
that it was a joke.

618
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,180
Anyway, we would need many more 
metal detectors and bullets.

619
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,570
You should make 
arrangements for that, sir.

620
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,090
I had made a call to Kerala.

621
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,640
They are saying that it is the 
responsibility of these people.

622
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,700
Do we have so many metal detectors & 
bullet proof jackets in Kerala, Mani?

623
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,160
Anyway, I call them again.

624
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,730
Okay sir. 
- And Mani...

625
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Be careful!

626
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,170
Okay?

627
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
What happened, sir?

628
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,390
It will come!

629
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,450
Distribute this to the children.

630
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,090
Open your mouth.

631
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,150
That's it! 
That's it!

632
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,410
Have it.

633
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,500
Have it.

634
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,890
Sir, isn't that the man who 
came to the booth yesterday?

635
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,760
Kunalchand, right?

636
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,210
Yes.

637
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,520
The child seems to be ill.

638
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,700
Is he a doctor?

639
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,460
I don't know.

640
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,860
What is this?

641
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,300
Grapes?

642
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,660
There's quite a lot!

643
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,590
Hey! He was the one who came 
to our booth yesterday, right?

644
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Yes.

645
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,970
Would these people be the Maoists?

646
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
Can't say.

647
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,980
They might not be like 
this during the night.

648
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,970
After 4 days, it's the 
election at the school.

649
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,470
All of you should come and vote, okay?

650
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,510
All of you must vote.

651
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
Okay?

652
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,700
No need for any tension. 
We are with you.

653
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,140
Nothing will happen to you.

654
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,290
Understood? 
Okay.

655
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,150
Come on.

656
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,440
Come.

657
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,530
Are you a doctor?

658
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,220
Yes. I was a doctor, 4 years back.

659
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,080
Then how did you join the ITBP?

660
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,030
I'm from an army family.

661
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,430
Someone or the other from our family 
has been in the army, always.

662
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,440
4 years back, my brother 
became a martyr.

663
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,690
And I joined the army.

664
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,160
And now I'm serving my country!

665
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,100
Come on! 
Fast!

666
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,810
It's a shotgun missile.

667
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,750
Missile? 
- Yes.

668
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,100
Do they have all these stuff? 
- Of course.

669
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,850
They would always have it.

670
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,950
Jojo sir...

671
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,810
One guy is talking on 
the mobile over there.

672
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,450
Would he be an informer?

673
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,140
Would he be an informer?

674
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,450
Seems like the Maoists 
had come here.

675
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,550
What did he say?

676
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
Let's go.

677
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,860
Let's go forward and look.

678
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,520
Look! The place where 
Maoists made gruel.

679
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,430
What are these Maoists 
upto, over here?

680
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,770
[Incoming wireless message]

681
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,850
Run!

682
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,060
Unni!

683
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,310
Come here.

684
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,630
Come fast.

685
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,150
Your cap!

686
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,580
Sir!

687
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Jojo sir!

688
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,630
Come!

689
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,300
What's the matter?

690
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
Why did you run?

691
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,640
Didn't he ask us to run, sir?

692
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,790
He said that you guys would be tired 
of walking. We'll take rest & go!

693
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,210
Who asked you to run for that?

694
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,000
It was this 'Rat' who told us 
that there will be a shootout now!

695
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,820
Who said there will be a shootout? 
- Mani sir.

696
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,300
I've got signal on my mobile now. 
- Don't say things I didn't say.

697
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,820
If anyone wants to call home, 
go ahead.

698
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,280
Girish, I want to make a call.

699
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,200
Sheesh! Fell down on 
my back in vain!

700
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,600
You must be tired. 
Sit down.

701
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,330
Hey! Can you see a 
child inside the moon?

702
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,370
No.

703
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,510
Look carefully!

704
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,910
Like a child kicking with its legs.

705
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,100
Only you feel so, sir.

706
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Did you call your wife?

707
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
No.

708
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,860
I have to call her tomorrow.

709
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,520
But how do I call?

710
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,970
There's no signal here, right?

711
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,400
Well, have you found a 
name for your child yet?

712
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,340
She has found some name.

713
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,820
She said that it's a surprise.

714
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:12,950
What's that?

715
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,970
Do you know what that is?

716
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,800
A light is lit for 
the village guard,

717
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,710
so that no one from outside 
comes to trouble us.

718
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,310
It's there in our village too.

719
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,170
Have you ever seen a 
Maoist, in person?

720
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,820
I mean, have you...

721
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,930
Ask him.

722
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,620
Have you ever seen a Maoist?

723
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,370
I've never come 
face-to-face with anyone.

724
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,910
But there are plenty of Maoists here.

725
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,270
There are plenty of them!

726
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,090
Don't be scared!

727
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,630
Sir.

728
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,700
Actually, what are these Maoists?

729
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,180
What do they want?

730
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,040
Why are they troubling us?

731
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,630
Only they would know 
what they want, right?

732
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,450
And we're getting a salary for 
taking these troubles, right?

733
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,740
So we should take the trouble.

734
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Mani sir.

735
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,590
These villagers here...

736
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,250
... think that Mao Tse-Tung 
belongs to Andhra.

737
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,830
The people here think that 
Mao hails from Andhra.

738
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,290
Smooth!

739
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,450
Take it out.

740
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,040
No.

741
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Don't touch it.

742
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,630
No. This is my... 
- It will be awesome if we get it.

743
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,030
AK 47.

744
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,630
Nice gun. 
- Yes.

745
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,490
This is my wife! 
My wife!

746
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Smooth!

747
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,780
Don't make me lose the flow, 
please.

748
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,860
Do whatever you want with it.

749
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,260
Sir.

750
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,290
Mani sir.

751
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,310
What happened?

752
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,090
Keep the gun down.

753
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,180
Put the gun down.

754
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,300
Aji, put down the gun.

755
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,670
Sir, he will shoot.

756
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,530
Aji, put the gun down.

757
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,580
He won't shoot.

758
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
What happened, son?

759
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,580
What did you do, Aji?

760
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,060
Pointing a gun at a child?

761
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,800
Sir, that boy would have fired now.

762
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,000
Kunalchand!

763
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,760
Who is this boy? 
- He is my grandson, sir.

764
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,900
He came here by mistake.

765
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,450
Do children pick up 
guns by mistake?

766
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Whose gun is this?

767
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,110
Mine, sir.

768
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,440
Do you carry your gun 
so irresponsibly, Biju?

769
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,530
This is not a log to keep it 
wherever you like. It's a gun!

770
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,500
Sir, he is a Maoist.

771
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,520
Who? 
That boy?

772
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,570
That boy would have fired now, sir. 
- Stop it!

773
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,420
I am sure.

774
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,970
Sir, don't make up stuff.

775
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,290
Didn't he say that the boy 
picked it up by mistake?

776
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Enough. 
Come!

777
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,570
Don't worry.

778
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,140
Hey!

779
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,530
Since so much has happened, if anyone has 
hidden booze, take it out before food.

780
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,910
Bastar or wherever this is.. 
Unni will bring booze tomorrow.

781
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,260
When we're in so much tension, 
how do you feel like boozing, sir?

782
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,840
If you don't want, 
you don't drink.

783
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,510
Why are you interfering 
in others' matters?

784
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,240
I didn't say anything to you!

785
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,310
I know where the stuff is.

786
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,370
'Fire'! 
- Hey! Give it here.

787
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,210
I can't give it. 
I have other uses with it.

788
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
You selfish fellow!

789
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,560
The others also have 
the same use as you!

790
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,230
Rum?

791
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
We get it here also!

792
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:00,970
Mahua!

793
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,670
Truly single-malt!

794
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,810
Finished!

795
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Very nice!

796
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,360
Not one drop for me?

797
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,420
Drink it, sir.

798
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,130
Drink!

799
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:22,870
Thank you.

800
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,450
Cheers.

801
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,630
Do you want one?

802
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,100
No! No!

803
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,080
It's all right. 
I'll have his share as well.

804
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,520
Aji sir, have a drink.

805
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,490
To be frank, sir...

806
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,980
I got courage only now.

807
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,730
Now no one has to be scared.

808
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,380
Whoever comes, I'll stand before 
him with my chest broadened.

809
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,600
They will go away 
with your chest too!

810
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,610
How can you guys be so scared?

811
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,430
After all, we're policemen, right?

812
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,970
If not weapons, 
we'll confront them with brains!

813
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Not by firing...

814
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,240
Kerala Police became India's best 
police force by using brains!

815
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,550
That's what everyone says!

816
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,570
That's what!

817
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,450
Let them fire if they want to, sir.

818
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,340
I'm even ready to be a martyr!

819
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,330
What? 
- A martyr.

820
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,160
Hey Fair & Lovely! 
This is not a shootout from the movies!

821
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,720
Actual bullets would pierce your chest. 
- Let it come.

822
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,380
Why are you all like this?

823
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,000
Without any confidence?

824
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Let them come!

825
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,380
We'll figure out then.

826
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,460
Instead, why...

827
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,540
Why do you have to be 
tensed now itself?

828
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,600
That's what!

829
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,350
Not just the Maoist, 
we'll chase away even his dad!

830
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,040
Whom are they messing with!

831
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,060
That's it!

832
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Sir!

833
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,860
Sir! 
- Take action!

834
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,560
Where is it coming from? 
- Mani sir.

835
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,160
Sir...

836
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,740
Mani sir, what should we do?

837
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,220
Sir... 
- Sir, what should we do?

838
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,890
Sir.. 
- Mani sir...

839
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,560
What should we do, sir?

840
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,400
Go ahead! Fire!

841
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Over here!

842
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,250
Sir... Sir... 
Someone shot at us, sir.

843
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,560
Sir, what happened?

I said, stop!

Stop!

858
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,690
Since it was dark, 
I couldn't get them properly.

Noushad, this is the first 
time you fired, right? - Yes.

860
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,930
What about you? 
- It was my first time too.

861
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
What's over there?

862
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,090
How many rounds did 
you people fire?

863
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,530
First they fired.

864
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,270
Then, we fired.

865
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,210
10 rounds over.

866
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,340
Ten!

867
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,140
Full rounds!

868
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,710
Ten rounds, sir.

869
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,590
Those people fired just 
one or two bullets.

870
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,810
The rest were fire-crackers!

871
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,710
ITBP had chased away some 
Maoists who were nearby.

872
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,570
They must have fired 
seeing the light here.

873
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,040
What kind of policemen are you,

874
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,390
if you can't differentiate 
between crackers & firing?

875
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,580
They were crackers?

876
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,890
Sir, I had asked these fools not to fire, 
but they didn't listen.

No, sir.

00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
Yesterday...

888
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,430
There was a shootout 
somewhere else.

889
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,420
The report says that two 
Naxalites were killed.

890
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,430
The people back in Kerala will notice 
only if one of us dies or what?

891
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,140
What's happening, sir? Will the 
bullets & other stuff come?

892
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,440
Don't be emotional.

893
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,980
How can I not be, sir? 
We only have 8 bullets in total.

894
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,320
What can we do with it?

895
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,410
I had called them.

896
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,660
S.P. is on leave.

897
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,670
They said they will inform 
him once he's back.

898
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,240
Sir. 
- Hello, sir.

899
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,360
What is this, sir? Have we been 
brought here to get killed?

900
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,390
I can't stay here.

901
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,490
Did you see the newspaper?

902
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,240
There was the S.P.'s 
report yesterday.

903
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,910
That they removed the mines 
buried around the election booth.

904
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,900
Will I be able to see my 
wife & children, sir?

905
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,470
Is all this true, sir?

906
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,510
Our booths would be safe, right?

907
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,350
S.P. says that they would be.

908
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,280
Oh! That's great to know!

909
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,650
You can sit here & say it.

910
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,280
We're the ones suffering 
in the forest.

911
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,450
Only I know how difficult it is 
to suffer all alone over here.

912
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,100
Don't be nervous.

913
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,230
You are all team captains, right?

914
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,380
You should be giving courage 
to the others, right?

915
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,010
How can I give them courage, sir?

916
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,720
Those boys are all petrified.

917
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,240
Do they have any experience in 
handling such a situation?

918
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,590
Leave them. 
Do any of us have it?

919
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,100
Do you know what to do if 
a shootout happens, sir?

920
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,510
I am trying.

921
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,780
I can only call them from here.

922
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,240
Even if we call from here,

923
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,920
is there any guarantee that they 
would send the stuff from there?

924
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,380
Even if they send it, can we be sure that 
it would reach here before the election?

925
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
No.

926
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,160
I'm leaving, sir.

927
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,150
The shells of the rounds we 
fired yesterday are missing.

928
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,750
You're checking all this now?

929
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,770
Shouldn't you take 
it then & there?

930
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,270
Do you have it?

931
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,300
I haven't taken anything.

932
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,410
I am sure, sir.

933
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,900
The father & son who came 
yesterday are indeed Maoists.

934
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,890
They must be leaking 
information about us to them.

935
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,000
He escaped when Dakota 
sir came yesterday.

936
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,080
He came here right 
before the shootout.

937
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,800
It's him. 
- I have also felt so, sir.

938
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,050
What can I do?

939
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,620
It was Mani sir who spoke in 
his support yesterday, right?

940
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,200
We saw the condition of the 
man who spoke in his support.

941
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,100
He went and sat at a corner, 
without speaking a word.

942
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,180
What happened, sir?

943
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,460
They have informed 
the Government.

944
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,650
I don't think there 
would be any response.

945
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,450
Why is it like that now, sir?

946
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,070
It's the Government 
that sent us here.

947
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,840
So aren't they responsible 
for our safety?

948
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,800
What happened, sir?

949
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,400
Last night, something...

950
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,950
I don't know what happened.

951
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,790
My arms & legs became really weak.

952
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,240
I couldn't do anything suddenly.

953
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,130
And I was really tired too.

954
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,070
Do you have any B.P. problem?

955
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,370
No.

956
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,100
It was like, my hand 
was not there at all.

957
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,040
Have you ever had 
a heart problem?

958
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,570
No.

959
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,100
I think it might have 
been a minor attack.

960
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,630
Sir, you should take 
care of yourself.

961
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,070
And one more thing.

962
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,520
Tonight, we won't use 
the light inside.

963
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,990
We'll adjust with the torch.

964
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,490
The thing is that, if the light is on, 
there are more chances of being attacked.

965
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,260
He's saying that we shouldn't 
keep the light on in the night.

966
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,750
You take care of yourself, sir.

967
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,760
Where are the others? 
- They are inside, sir.

968
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,870
From today, 
light shouldn't be seen outside.

969
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:43,710
We need to close these windows.

970
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,230
Today itself.

971
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,160
We'll do what's necessary.

972
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,090
Jojo sir & Unni are saying that you 
didn't do anything yesterday, on purpose.

973
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,940
That's why everyone is angry.

974
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,750
We should do something, sir.

975
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,710
Or else, I don't think we 
can return from here alive.

976
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,620
Call Noushad here.

977
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,580
Is there any way to send 
these photos to Kerala?

978
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,610
We'll send it, sir.

979
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,930
Here.

980
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,450
Send it to this number.

981
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,510
Send a photo of this note, as well. 
- Okay sir.

982
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,800
Say that Kochumon sent it. 
- Okay sir.

983
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,010
Who is Kochumon, sir?

984
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,470
Kochumon is myself.

985
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,390
My old friends call me that.

986
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:53,260
'Police team on election duty 
in Chattisgarh, in distress'

987
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,400
[Protester shouting slogans]

988
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,150
We're in front of the 
Collectorate, sir.

989
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,650
A protest march by the SFU.

990
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,940
I saw it, sir.

991
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
It's from KAP 5.

992
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,910
OC is our Mathew.

993
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,030
No, sir. 
It won't happen again.

994
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,530
I'll see to it, sir.

995
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,580
Sir, shall we charge at them? 
- Calm down.

996
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,080
Who did this? 
- It's Mani sir's patrol, sir.

997
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:24,680
What do we do now?

998
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,620
Sir, let's hit them. 
- Keep quiet.

999
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,840
Sir, the election is 
day after tomorrow.

1000
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,090
The bullet proof jackets & 
metal detectors are at KAP 1.

1001
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,210
They are on duty, sir.

1002
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,180
We're really short of 
those things, sir.

1003
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,700
What the hell do we have then?

1004
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,830
We're short of bullets too, sir. 
We'll have to collect them.

1005
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:39,080
Bullets, then. Collect it 
from somewhere & take it to them.

1006
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,580
Ask them to adjust with the rest there. 
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,390
Sir, shall I chase them away? 
- Go and chase them away!

1008
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,980
Charge!

1009
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,800
What have you done?

1010
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,220
What else should I do, sir?

1011
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:21,030
After sending us here, asking to 
uphold Kerala Government's honour,

1012
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,260
if no one bothers when we have a 
problem, what should I do? Tell me.

1013
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,210
For that, should you 
insult the force?

1014
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,930
It's sure that you'll be in trouble 
for this when you go back!

1015
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,210
For that, I have to get back 
there alive, right sir?

1016
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,290
In these 15 years of service, 
I haven't got a single red mark.

1017
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,210
I've controlled many habits of mine, 
just because I'm a policeman.

1018
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,260
Well, I am obliged to do it.

1019
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,250
But this is not like that, sir.

1020
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,320
It's not like the bullets 
would be of great use!

1021
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,750
There are 6-7 of them in that booth, 
who have put their trust in me.

1022
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,000
The boys are half dead already.

1023
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,180
You don't know the situation there, sir.

1024
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,320
I also faltered slightly.

1025
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,520
What is it?

1026
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,840
There's no problem.

1027
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,900
Can I tell them a news that 
would make them happy?

1028
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,060
Will we get bullets?

1029
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,200
They said they have 
sent it on a train.

1030
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,030
It will reach on 
election day morning.

1031
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,210
We might get it, right?

1032
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,170
In such a situation, is it safe 
to send bullets in a train?

1033
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,480
I'm leaving, sir.

1034
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,650
Namaste.

1035
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:30,690
Remember me?

1036
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
Yes.

1037
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,320
I heard everything.

1038
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,900
Is there any response?

1039
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,110
No.

1040
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,280
Bullets have been sent, apparently. 
It will reach.

1041
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,970
I have to ask you something, sir. 
- What is it, sir?

1042
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,370
What is the attacking method of Maoists? 
What do they do?

1043
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,260
Sir, we set up this camp here, 
last December.

1044
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:58,020
They attacked us on the third day!

1045
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,010
We cut down all these 
trees after that.

1046
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,450
For more visibility.

1047
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,670
Attacking method is like...

1048
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,040
It's unpredictable.

1049
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,090
It's 'Hit & run' mostly. 
They come in groups.

1050
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,330
Can't say what they would do.

1051
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,220
And...

1052
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,310
Their aim is to kill.

1053
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,600
To kill us.

1054
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,280
It's us who should decide 
whether we should die or not.

1055
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:24,090
Okay then.

1056
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,760
What's the matter? 
- Sir, that Kunalchand?

1057
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,560
His son was a Maoist.

1058
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,630
He was caught.

1059
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,670
Is it? 
- Yes.

1060
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,700
When? 
- Some time back.

1061
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,530
Sir, shall we go & see 
that arrested Maoist?

1062
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,810
No one has to go anywhere. 
Is this a mimicry programme or what?

1063
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:52,890
To go and see?

1064
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,390
Where is Jojo?

1065
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,980
Sir, Jojo sir & Smooth have caught 
a fever and are resting inside.

1066
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,850
What happened to them? 
- Don't know, sir.

1067
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,140
Sir, they are bringing him.

1068
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,900
What happened? 
Was there a shootout?

1069
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,350
What happened, sir?

1070
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,430
ITBP did a raid on the village.

1071
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,250
And that boy was 
caught from his house.

1072
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,010
He was arrested. 
- Sir...

1073
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,700
Sir.

1074
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,410
Didn't I tell you?

1075
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:58,260
That he'll learn things about 
us & inform the Maoists?

1076
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,070
Now it's confirmed, right?

1077
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,270
You had the most 
sympathy for him, right?

1078
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,040
How will I know whether 
he's a Maoist or not, man?

1079
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,540
That's what I said, sir.

1080
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,920
When we're sent to such places on duty, 
an experienced officer should come with us.

1081
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,590
Finally, it's us who 
are trapped here.

1082
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,180
No one came to help us.

1083
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,050
I didn't do it on 
purpose that day.

1084
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,270
It just happened somehow.

1085
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,270
Even though I'm in the police,

1086
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,240
I've never had to chase a thief,

1087
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,830
or catch a murderer.

1088
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,650
I never had to do 
anything like that.

1089
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
It's true.

1090
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,180
I don't know how to 
handle such a situation.

1091
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
And...

1092
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,900
the guns you have, are ones abandoned 
by the army 10 years back!

1093
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,100
I have no clue whether 
they work or not!

1094
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,520
So when all this came together, 
I was at a loss altogether.

1095
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,340
What should I do now?

1096
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,260
Should I apologize?

1097
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Forgive me, guys!

1098
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,210
If anything happens again,

1099
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,990
... only after I die, something 
would happen to you guys.

1100
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,200
Fine?

1101
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,160
What you're doing is not so good!

1102
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,800
After all, he's an S.I., right?

1103
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,080
You can talk like this, because 
he's giving you so much freedom!

1104
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,550
Hey! 
Get going!

1105
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,800
Listen! 
There's a call for Mani sir.

1106
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,750
Sir.

1107
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,460
There's a call from your house.

1108
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,110
Give it to everyone. 
- Okay sir.

1109
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:33,650
Sir.

1110
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,410
I knew it when you didn't 
call for the past 2-3 days,

1111
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,240
that there's some serious problem there.

1112
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,150
There's no proper signal here.

1113
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,230
Is it?

1114
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,970
Well, what's the situation there now?

1115
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:45,790
There's no problem here.

1116
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,640
There hasn't been any 
problems so far.

1117
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,400
It's not a place where 
such problems happen.

1118
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,580
Don't be tensed about that.

1119
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,380
I don't have such tensions.

1120
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,180
Why don't you have tension?

1121
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,950
Well, it's because I trust my husband.

1122
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:04,650
The kindergarten hasn't been 
functioning for a few days now.

1123
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,730
I am alone.

1124
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,930
When are you coming 
back, Kunjettan?

1125
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,420
I will come.

1126
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,030
And yeah...

1127
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,680
Gokulan's wife gave birth.

1128
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,000
Is it? 
- Yes.

1129
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
I had gone there.

1130
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,220
Twins!

1131
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,540
Two pretty girls.

1132
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,530
There's no problem.

1133
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,440
Soumya's health is okay.

1134
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,790
If he's next to you, 
ask him to call her.

1135
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
I'll tell him.

1136
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
You should go there.

1137
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,280
I'll go.

1138
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,220
What else is happening?

1139
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,390
Well...

1140
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,340
Nothing much.

1141
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
I'll call you later then.

1142
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,220
Okay.

1143
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,760
We should say whatever we have to 
say, to whoever it is, Gokulan.

1144
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,650
What's the point in 
keeping it in our minds?

1145
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
Gokulan!

1146
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:56,810
There's a good news.

1147
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,210
Your wife gave birth...

1148
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,770
... to two children!

1149
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Both are girls!

1150
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,300
When was it, sir? 
Who told you?

1151
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,810
Lalitha had just called me.

1152
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,370
Sir, I want to call my house.

1153
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Here. 
Call from this.

1154
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,090
Call on that number.

1155
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:09,930
Sir...

1156
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,810
Jojo sir's fever has increased.

1157
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,200
How did both of them 
get fever together?

1158
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,910
Must be Malaria, sir.

1159
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,250
We drink water from here, right?

1160
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,860
Call him... that Kapil Dev.

1161
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,500
Hey! Daughters were 
born in your house?

1162
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,540
Twins?

1163
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Sir...

1164
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,390
Sir... 
Just a minute.

1165
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,500
Open! Open!

1166
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,310
He will be fine, sir.

1167
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,990
There are these small black 
mosquitoes here, right?

1168
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,540
Mosquito! 
Mosquito!

1169
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,450
It's due to their bites. 
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

1170
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,500
It's not a mosquito. 
This is out of fear.

1171
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,000
Can't you see him shivering?

1172
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,250
He was blabbering 
something last night too.

1173
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,660
It's not out of fear.

1174
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,240
Why should I be afraid?

1175
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,410
Then why are you holding 
that gun all the time, sir?

1176
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,770
Can't you keep it down?

1177
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:01,150
Make a call to your house.

1178
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,380
Do you want to call your wife?

1179
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
We have a phone.

1180
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
I don't want to see her.

1181
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,220
If I die here,

1182
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,030
don't show her 
even my dead body!

1183
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:13,730
Sir...

1184
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:14,750
Kunalchand.

1185
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:19,920
What is it, Kunalchand?

1186
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,940
We can't let him in here again, sir.

1187
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,640
It's risky for us.

1188
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:28,790
He is a Maoist, sir.

1189
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,590
Girish, tell this to him in Hindi.

1190
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,290
Why did he come here now?

1191
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,940
You don't need to know that, sir.

1192
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,650
Don't take up 
unnecessary troubles.

1193
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,860
Sir, please listen to us, 
at least in this matter.

1194
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,280
Send him away, sir.

1195
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,330
That's better for us.

1196
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:43,940
What did he say?

1197
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,600
They are saying that 
you're a Maoist.

1198
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,860
Naxalite.

1199
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,380
Get going from here.

1200
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,540
Everyone wants us to 
go away from here.

1201
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,340
Everyone wants to chase 
us away from our own land.

1202
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:59,330
Where will we go?

1203
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,740
Now my son is with them.

1204
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,530
They are calling him also a Maoist.

1205
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,060
He is not a Maoist.

1206
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:12,080
I'm not a Maoist either.

1207
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,920
It's the election day after tomorrow.

1208
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,850
There's patrolling before that.

1209
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,090
The car is here.

1210
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,110
We have to go.

1211
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,140
Who all are coming with me?

1212
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,430
I'll come, sir.

1213
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,770
You don't have to come.

1214
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,490
Jojo is unwell, right? 
You stay here.

1215
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:49,980
Aji & Noushad, come.

1216
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Sir...

1217
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,530
What's the actual issue 
between you and your wife?

1218
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:04,880
She's always 
suspicious about me.

1219
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:06,900
We are men, right?

1220
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,790
We keep talking to so 
many people, right?

1221
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,280
If she starts 
suspecting all that..?

1222
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,550
That's true.

1223
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:16,190
But just because of suspicion, 
would she go home, asking for divorce?

1224
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:17,870
Wasn't yours a love marriage?

1225
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:20,240
It happened like that, 
back then.

1226
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,470
I needed some money then.

1227
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,540
I didn't get that either.

1228
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,830
What are you saying, sir?

1229
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:29,190
Don't tell us that you don't 
have affairs with other women.

1230
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,320
We keep seeing it.

1231
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:31,790
She must have caught you.

1232
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,530
Who asked her to unlock & go through 
my phone, when I was asleep?

1233
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,670
So that's it. 
She caught you, right?

1234
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,340
From your talks, it would seem like she did 
something wrong & created this whole issue.

1235
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:46,380
Sir, this problem would be solved if you 
keep aside your ego & apologize to her.

1236
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,710
I won't say sorry.

1237
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,700
There's nothing wrong in expecting some 
honesty between husbands & wives, sir.

1238
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
You'll say this now.

1239
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:55,920
You'll get married, right?

1240
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,150
Then we'll see.

1241
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,210
In our gun...

1242
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,980
To hide the fact that there 
are no bullets in our gun,

1243
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:13,350
we just need to have confidence 
on our face and in our attitude.

1244
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,500
No one can guess it then.

1245
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,570
Is he from this locality?

1246
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:23,610
Why? Are you going to say 
that he's also a Maoist?

1247
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:25,030
Yeah right. 
- What?

1248
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Nothing.

1249
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,060
Nothing.

1250
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,250
There's something fishy 
in his 'What?', right?

1251
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,500
What?

1252
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,620
What is it?

1253
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,050
One minute.

1254
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,590
What is it? 
- Can't understand anything.

1255
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,020
Why did he go out?

1256
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,390
Dude, what is it?

1257
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,490
Sir...

1258
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,000
Will there be any problem, sir?

1259
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,370
I don't know.

1260
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,050
Sir, there might be 
land-mines on the way.

1261
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,470
Going forward this way, 
might be dangerous.

1262
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:21,610
Land-mines?

1263
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,630
Oh God!

1264
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,940
Mines?

1265
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,260
Are you sure?

1266
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,680
Sir, that's how it is, over here.

1267
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,460
- It's a dangerous area, sir. 
- What is it?

1268
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,020
Are you getting scared?

1269
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,520
You had so much confidence, right? 
- What do we do now, sir?

1270
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:35,910
Sir. 
You don't get out now, sir.

1271
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,890
This way..?

1272
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,460
It's risky, sir. 
Can't say anything.

1273
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,720
Shucks!

1274
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,290
We need to inform the camp.

1275
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:54,130
Wireless? Phone?

1276
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,140
I have a mobile phone. 
But there's no signal here.

1277
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,650
Sir, should we stay 
here and call them?

1278
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,430
Can't we go back 
the way we came?

1279
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,070
We can't go back like that.

1280
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,210
What if the people who 
come this way are injured?

1281
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
We must tell them.

1282
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,460
I'll take him and go 
search for mobile signal.

1283
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,550
All three of you 
should stay here.

1284
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,870
Don't go anywhere. 
- No.

1285
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,750
All of you should stay together. 
- Okay sir.

1286
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,780
Come.

1287
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,090
Sir, I can't find any signal here.

1288
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:37,550
Okay sir.

1289
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,300
Where did they go?

1290
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,400
Aji..!!

1291
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,640
Aji..!!

1292
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:51,590
Hey!

1293
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,090
Aji...

1294
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,020
Oh no! My boys!

1295
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:58,830
Sir, don't go there. 
It's dangerous.

1296
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,030
Will you tell the police about us?

1297
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,940
Don't hit me!

1298
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,110
Run! 
Come on!

1299
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,670
Kunalchand! 
Kunalchand!

1300
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,770
What? 
What happened?

1301
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:30,810
Who was it? 
Who was it?

1302
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:33,570
Sir.

1303
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,540
Where were you guys?

1304
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,430
You got me scared!

1305
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,700
Where are the others?

1306
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,530
What are you doing outside?

1307
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Go inside, man.

1308
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,690
Sir, they haven't returned.

1309
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,140
They will come.

1310
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,300
Mary...

1311
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:56,050
Mary...

1312
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,990
Why is he saying 
'Meri' (My) in Hindi?

1313
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,270
It's not Hindi, sir. 
He's saying his wife's name.

1314
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,290
Mary?

1315
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:06,320
Nice. 
Nice name.

1316
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,130
Maoists say that I am your man.

1317
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,390
You say that I am a Maoist.

1318
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,260
I'm not anyone's man.

1319
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,900
My son isn't anyone's man either.

1320
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,560
He's not a Maoist.

1321
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,330
My son used to say,

1322
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,030
'We should leave this place and go.'

1323
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,090
I said, 'Where will we go?'

1324
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,470
This land, water and 
jungles are all ours.

1325
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
Where will we go?

1326
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:39,550
15 years back, there were 
around 2 Lakh people here.

1327
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,890
Now there are hardly 
10,000 people remaining.

1328
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Where did they go?

1329
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,750
No one knows.

1330
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,820
I want to meet my son.

1331
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,440
I want to see him.

1332
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,360
Sir...

1333
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,670
Will you help me?

1334
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,230
Sir...

1335
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,510
Sir, where were you?

1336
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,000
It's really late. 
Don't you want to leave from here?

1337
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,250
How will we go, sir?

1338
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,120
Is it Lays?

1339
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,480
Yes. 
Do you want it?

1340
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,070
Can I have some?

1341
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,260
I always eat it while 
travelling in train.

1342
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,310
Do you want it?

1343
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,110
How can you do this?

1344
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,590
Don't you have any tension?

1345
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,970
Keep your leg! 
Come on!

1346
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Why? 
Don't you want to?

1347
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,790
Look at the place he's 
resting his foot!

1348
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,320
I'll throw you out! 
- Hey!

1349
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,660
Why are you so honest?

1350
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,120
Brother...

1351
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,230
Two cups of tea, 
two 'Vada's.

1352
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,670
Sir, we have very few sources.

1353
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,260
With all the sources we have, 
if we set all our rounds over here,

1354
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,680
... we'll be able to stop the attacks 
that may happen from the front.

1355
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,400
They are going to build something.

1356
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,660
We can't say where 
they would come from.

1357
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,990
Let's build one on 
top of this tree.

1358
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:28,970
Call all of them here.

1359
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,510
Call everyone. 
- No. I understood.

1360
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,590
From here, you can cover 
all four directions.

1361
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,420
Right! Right! 
Very good.

1362
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:39,450
If someone attacks,

1363
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,060
we need to build covers top 
and bottom, to defend it.

1364
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,900
Let's build a platform 
on top of it.

1365
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,100
We'll do that, sir.

1366
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,580
And...

1367
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,840
I've brought sacks and 
other stuff from the camp.

1368
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,310
So, start the work then.

1369
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:00,710
Is all this necessary?

1370
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,430
Just to trouble us...

1371
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,160
Let them bring the bullets first.

1372
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,200
What will you do if 
they bring the bullets?

1373
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,750
Will you fire?

1374
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:17,610
Won't even work...

1375
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,820
And he's blaming the 
bullet shortage now.

1376
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:49,190
Now you go and give it. 
I'll dig this.

1377
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,560
I'll go and ask Jojo sir.

1378
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,430
No. Each one should do the 
duty assigned to him.

1379
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:56,460
What are you saying, sir?

1380
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,390
We're together now, right?

1381
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:00,970
You want to play 
senior-junior here also?

1382
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:03,550
Jojo sir said so, right? 
I'll sort it out.

1383
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,620
His side-kicks needn't 
talk too much.

1384
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,420
Why are you angry at me? 
What did I do?

1385
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,250
Hey! You go and keep it there.

1386
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,570
I can't do it.

1387
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,130
Everyone is not a Hawildar.

1388
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:19,440
Who has a problem in doing 
the work I assigned?

1389
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:23,330
If you show off too much, 
I'll put all of you in trouble.

1390
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,140
Keep quiet, sir.

1391
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,410
You can cut off two days 
leave of mine, at best.

1392
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:28,830
You can't do anything else!

1393
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,580
Don't brag too much!

1394
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,590
You'll see what I can 
do to you, Aji Peter.

1395
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,420
There's no problem here, sir.

1396
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,820
When Gokulan was tired carrying sacks, 
he just asked for a change of duty.

1397
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:41,470
No change in duty!

1398
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,380
All of you do the work 
I assigned to you.

1399
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,770
What? 
What's the problem here?

1400
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:47,980
Nothing, sir.

1401
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,230
There's a problem, sir.

1402
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,380
In between all these problems, 
we can't tolerate his ego as well.

1403
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:56,000
If something happens to you tomorrow, only 
they will be there to take care of you.

1404
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:57,840
Why do you want to garner 
hate from everyone?

1405
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,470
Such arguments can wait until 
you return to the camp, okay?

1406
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,510
Sir, I have to say something.

1407
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,750
What?

1408
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:12,550
There's no point in filling 
sand in sacks, sir.

1409
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:15,740
We should try to get the bullets & 
other amenities here at the earliest.

1410
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,980
It has started. 
Let it reach here.

1411
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:19,660
Why should we wait?

1412
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,700
We can ask the ITBP 
people here, right?

1413
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,980
Since even those who sent us here 
aren't bothered about us,

1414
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,830
I don't know how we 
will ask these guys.

1415
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,660
If you know it, 
you try asking.

1416
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,820
Sir.

1417
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,150
Everything is okay, right? 
- Sir.

1418
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,560
This is the election officer.

1419
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,940
Take care of him. 
- Sir.

1420
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,200
Please come.

1421
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,250
Please come.

1422
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,170
We're watching the preparations 
of the Lok Sabha elections tomorrow.

1423
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,890
Sir, can you tell us about the status 
of preparations in Bastar?

1424
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,850
We have done all the preparations 
for the elections, peacefully.

1425
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,070
There's a threat from the Maoists, 
but there's no need to worry.

1426
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:19,800
We have fully equipped worthy 
officers in every centre.

1427
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,230
But doesn't yesterday's 
Maoist attack prove that

1428
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,280
there are shortcomings 
in your preparations?

1429
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,780
That was an isolated incident.

1430
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:31,390
We have 175 centres for this election.

1431
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,240
And in every centre, tight 
security has been deployed.

1432
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,660
Okay?

1433
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:39,660
Okay? 
Thank you.

1434
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,860
Thank you.

1435
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,180
Sir.

1436
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,290
I have to say something.

1437
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,880
Jojo is going to 
ask for a missile.

1438
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:47,340
Will he get it?

1439
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,940
We don't have many weapons.

1440
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,880
Earlier, you said...

1441
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:53,850
that we have everything.

1442
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:55,130
But we don't have it.

1443
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,260
If you give weapons,

1444
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:58,600
it will be great.

1445
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,750
Let's go fast, sir.

1446
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
You can say that.

1447
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,840
I'm really scared.

1448
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,420
Maoists will let you go 
because you're a tribal.

1449
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,670
They will kill me.

1450
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:17,270
What are you doing? Don't make it so long. 
Make it small.

1451
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,510
Make it small. 
- Come here.

1452
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,090
Keep this here.

1453
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,530
Where's Biju & Unni?

1454
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,720
They have gone out 
for a purpose.

1455
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Without asking me?

1456
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,750
What is this purpose that 
they didn't tell me?

1457
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,460
Nice!

1458
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,590
3 bottles!

1459
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,250
3 bottles!

1460
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,410
3 bottles!

1461
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,720
Thank you so much. 
I will come again!

1462
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:07,080
Where has this scoundrel gone?

1463
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,990
Here.

1464
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,380
Hey!

1465
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,210
What the hell are you doing there? 
Come here.

1466
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,420
Look at his love 
for his community!

1467
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,240
Did you come here to 
give them biscuits?

1468
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,220
They are poor people, sir.

1469
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,340
Not like us.

1470
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,010
Not like us. 
Like you!

1471
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,520
You're also a tribal. 
They're also tribals.

1472
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:36,330
We were brought here to pull all of 
them along & make them cast votes.

1473
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,590
And not to feed them biscuits!

1474
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:38,970
Leave it, sir.

1475
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,110
It's just biscuits, right?

1476
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:43,130
Anyway, you can't hide 
your true colours, right?

1477
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,910
People like you are the 
ones who create Maoists.

1478
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,160
Tell me, you %@%@. 
Aren't you a Maoist?

1479
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,590
You've been calling me a Tribal 
and Maoist for a long time now!

1480
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,500
There's a limit to my patience.

1481
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:54,750
What did you call me? 
'You'

1482
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,540
How can you be 
disrespectful to me?

1483
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,660
You forest-dweller!

1484
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,530
Leave me!

1485
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,230
Leave me!

1486
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:23,250
Leave me!

1487
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:34,310
Forest-dweller!

1488
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,370
Bloody ******

1489
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:37,530
******

1490
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,560
You bloody...

1491
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,620
Son of a *****

1492
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,480
Hello!

1493
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:29,980
Hello!

1494
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,080
Everything is okay.

1495
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,150
Now he'll be alright.

1496
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,430
Hey! 
Where is he?

1497
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,940
Where is Biju?

1498
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,670
Sir, you lie down.

1499
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:00,980
Lie down, sir.

1500
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,420
Kerala Police, right? 
- Yes.

1501
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,450
Call him.

1502
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,030
Hey!

1503
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,500
Come here.

1504
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,900
There's no need to be scared.

1505
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:51,780
There's no need to be scared. 
This keeps happening here.

1506
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,800
Don't worry.

1507
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,310
We will take care of it.

1508
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:24,450
What is it?

1509
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,020
Do you want to say something?

1510
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,080
If we go back alive,

1511
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,720
I won't be in this camp.

1512
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:35,360
I'm going to quit this job.

1513
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,070
Come.

1514
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,330
Our Biju...

1515
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,560
... has something 
to tell all of us.

1516
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:18,380
My opinion is that we should 
listen to what he has to say.

1517
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,050
What is it?

1518
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:26,070
Before the accident happened there today,

1519
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:29,930
me and Unni sir had a fight.

1520
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:33,990
Everyone knows where my house is.

1521
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:38,090
After completing my studies,

1522
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:43,240
when I saw an opportunity for a 
police job, my mother told me...

1523
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,100
'If you get a job,

1524
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:48,870
we would have some respect 
and position in society.'

1525
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,360
But what to do...

1526
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:55,750
Even after getting the job, 
the earlier situation never changed.

1527
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,170
I know...

1528
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:02,030
When everyone mocks me...

1529
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,030
It's a time-pass for all of you.

1530
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,570
But it's not like that for me, sir.

1531
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,230
Even otherwise,

1532
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:17,990
the situation when someone else would 
decide how our life is going to be like,

1533
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,240
that...

1534
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,400
... we can't bear that, sir.

1535
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,080
I'm quitting. 
I'm fed up.

1536
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,770
If I go back alive from here,

1537
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,640
I won't be doing this job.

1538
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:36,690
I quit.

1539
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:40,030
I just want to be myself, sir.

1540
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,750
Hey!

1541
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:55,920
What all are you saying?

1542
01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:58,360
If there's any problem, 
we can solve it, right?

1543
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,840
You can think about quitting the job, 
after going back.

1544
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,970
It's the election tomorrow.

1545
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,760
None of us can predict what all 
will happen here tomorrow.

1546
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,800
But...

1547
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,330
Whatever happens,

1548
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:18,990
only if we stand 
together as one team,

1549
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:22,240
only if we stand together as one team, 
we can survive.

1550
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,250
Not just your own lives,

1551
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:32,470
all of us should care for 
each other's lives too.

1552
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,050
I am going for night patrolling.

1553
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:49,750
There are election officers here. 
We need guards at the backside too.

1554
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,260
Girish & Aji, stand guard there.

1555
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,520
Okay sir.

1556
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,800
Hey!

1557
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:08,950
Why are you so angry at me, 
for the past few days?

1558
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,300
Did I ask you to propose 
marriage to my sister?

1559
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,950
I thought Nimmy, or your parents 
would tell you about it.

1560
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,350
I asked you whether 
you told me or not!

1561
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:23,140
You didn't tell me, 
neither did she.

1562
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,610
And I've never taken dad's 
words into account.

1563
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,140
From childhood, only I was 
there with her for everything.

1564
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,430
And when it came to such a 
big decision in her life,

1565
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,460
I wasn't there.

1566
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,220
I can only show my anger 
towards myself, right?

1567
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,300
Is that my fault?

1568
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:45,390
Dude, I didn't mean all that. 
- Don't talk too much.

1569
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,660
Do you have her photo?

1570
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,170
It's really hard to tolerate her.

1571
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:02,850
She's your sister, right?

1572
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,080
She's an innocent girl, man.

1573
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,320
Dude...

1574
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:11,830
When will the bullets 
come tomorrow?

1575
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,630
It should reach in 
the morning itself.

1576
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:25,380
Ayyappa!

1577
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:26,940
The box!

1578
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,060
Rajan!

1579
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,920
Rajan! 
- Your hands are really soft.

1580
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:35,900
Rajan! Where is the box?

1581
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,410
Is it here? 
It's over there, right?

1582
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:38,510
The box is not there.

1583
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:40,360
The box is not there, man!

1584
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,320
The box is not there?

1585
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:43,530
Yeah! Go and see!

1586
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:45,920
I saw it just now.

1587
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:50,820
Dude! 
Where is the box?

1588
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:53,470
That's what I said, you fool! 
The box is missing!

1589
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:56,030
Where's the guy who was sitting here? 
- He's also missing.

1590
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:58,640
Oh no!

1591
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:02,400
Oh no! The box!

1592
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:31,590
Dude, Aji... 
Look at that.

1593
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:33,130
Are they Maoists?

1594
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,190
No, dude.

1595
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:42,290
They are showing 
their Voter's ID's.

1596
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,620
Sir...

1597
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,770
Mani sir...

1598
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,160
It's so misty! 
- Sir...

1599
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:53,650
People have come to vote. 
- Is it?

1600
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,670
So early?

1601
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:56,400
So what?

1602
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:58,280
Hey! Wake up those officers.

1603
01:40:58,290 --> 01:40:59,290
Everyone get ready!

1604
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,590
Come on, get ready!

1605
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,300
Oh God! 
Protect us!

1606
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:13,490
Sir...

1607
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:16,350
What is it?

1608
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:19,380
People have come for voting. 
Ready! Ready!

1609
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,860
Okay. 
We will come now.

1610
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,460
Me and Girish will go and 
collect the bullets.

1611
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:30,160
You should take care of 
everything here until then, Jojo.

1612
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:31,680
You should stay alert. 
- Sir.

1613
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:33,690
Call Kapil Dev also.

1614
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:35,670
We'll come back soon.

1615
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,880
We will come fast.

1616
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:36,680
Sir...

1617
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,870
Yesterday... 
- I died yesterday, man!

1618
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:53,300
Sir, isn't he Kunalchand's son?

1619
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:56,430
Was he killed?

1620
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:01,550
Mani...

1621
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,290
Sir, we could leave if 
you give us the bullets.

1622
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,350
The bullets didn't come,

1623
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:10,310
neither the people 
who brought it.

1624
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,870
Both are missing.

1625
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:29,550
Are you hungry?

1626
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,670
Yes.

1627
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:34,980
They haven't come yet.

1628
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,710
Sir...

1629
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,250
Bullets?

1630
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:15,750
Voter ID?

1631
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:20,130
Sir, ID?

1632
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:23,370
What?

1633
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,860
What are you doing?

1634
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:34,470
How are you, Tiwari?

1635
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,880
Going on, sir.

1636
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:38,430
Your daughter must have grown up now. 
- Yes, sir.

1637
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,290
Only 15 people have come so far.

1638
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,670
15 people came? 
Will you call the army?

1639
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,590
No. You do as you please, sir. 
I don't have a problem.

1640
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:48,680
Sir, aren't these bogus votes?

1641
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:49,780
Shall we stop them?

1642
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:53,100
We can't interfere in that, 
until the election officers complain.

1643
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:57,420
And, we just have to make sure that law 
& order is being followed properly.

1644
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:58,980
Right?

1645
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:01,350
Wait, Peter. 
Wait.

1646
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,510
Then, let's wait and see 
if Maoists are coming.

1647
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,300
Right, sir?

1648
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,300
What happened, sir?

1649
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:31,950
Betrayal!

1650
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,560
You ****** 
Why is my vote going to someone else?

1651
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,470
This voting machine is rigged!

1652
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:44,790
Don't make a mistake! Don't touch me. 
- Move back!

1653
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:47,150
Move back!

1654
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:55,950
What's the problem?

1655
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,570
The booth is full of crooks, sir.

1656
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,280
First, they cast 
many bogus votes.

1657
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,810
Now they're saying that the 
voting machine is rigged.

1658
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,480
Who's creating trouble here?

1659
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,480
How dare you touch 
policemen, you *******!

1660
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,340
Aji, take all of them away. 
None of them should be here.

1661
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:33,610
Take all of them away!

1662
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:35,260
Get out, all of you!

1663
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:36,310
None of you should be seen here.

1664
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,770
Get lost!

1665
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:39,010
Get out!

1666
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,430
What? 
What? Who are you?

1667
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:43,710
You don't know me!

1668
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:46,290
You've come for 4 days. Do your 
work silently. - Get out, I say!

1669
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,750
Get going from here. 
I'll sort you out!

1670
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:50,840
I'll sort you out!

1671
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,090
None of you should be seen here.

1672
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,120
Get lost!

1673
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
Chase them away!

1674
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,940
They're trying to mess with the elections! 
Bloody rascals!

1675
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,660
How dare you touch him!

1676
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:32,730
Go! Go!

1677
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,500
Go! Go! Go!

1678
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,590
Mishra, don't worry.

1679
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:37,980
Go, man!

1680
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Get lost, you bloody dog!

1681
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,470
Get lost!

1682
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,880
Go! Go! 
- Come on.

1683
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,340
I'll get back at each one of them!

1684
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,680
Did the bullets & other 
amenities come, sir?

1685
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,880
No bullets, nothing!

1686
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,510
We have only us!

1687
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:57,860
Come on!

1688
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:45,110
Sir...

1689
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,320
Mary...

1690
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,350
It's me.

1691
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,440
It all happened by mistake.

1692
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:04,810
It's all my fault.

1693
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,000
You haven't done anything wrong.

1694
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,060
I blamed you, to hide my mistakes.

1695
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,260
It won't happen again.

1696
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,350
I swear.

1697
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:19,930
It's the election here today.

1698
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:24,210
I don't know if I can 
call or see you again.

1699
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,070
Anything can happen.

1700
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:29,830
I don't care a damn 
whether you live or die.

1701
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:32,910
If I say that I want divorce, 
that's a must!

1702
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:34,800
There's no change in that.

1703
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:37,140
I want to live peacefully 
hereafter at least.

1704
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Sir...

1705
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:28,910
Mani sir...

1706
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,240
What?

1707
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:32,810
Come here.

1708
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,840
Come fast, sir.

1709
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:41,350
What is it? 
- Look, sir.

1710
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:42,610
Someone is coming.

1711
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,660
Jojo...

1712
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:46,440
Go and get those 
binoculars from Kapil Dev.

1713
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,580
Go!

1714
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,110
Where did you see them? 
- Next to that big tree.

1715
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:54,460
Did you see?

1716
01:50:56,670 --> 01:50:57,810
How did he come here?

1717
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,930
Next to that tree. 
- Yes.

1718
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:08,250
Hold it. 
Come.

1719
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,300
Who is it, sir?

1720
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,360
Maoists?

1721
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,270
No. 
- Then who is it?

1722
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:19,670
Whoever it is, don't allow even 
one of them to step in here.

1723
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:22,330
Whoever stands in front of us,

1724
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:24,250
seek each one out, 
and finish them!

1725
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,940
Sir, I will inform ITBP.

1726
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:28,050
They will be here in 20 minutes. 
- Make it fast.

1727
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:31,650
We can hold on only until all 
these bullets are fired.

1728
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,980
These eight bullets are 
as valuable as our lives!

1729
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,300
Give it to me, sir.

1730
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,630
Please hit the targets, sir.

1731
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:42,210
Sir...

1732
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,670
I want to go home.

1733
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:45,230
All of us want to go home...

1734
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,860
... and see our 
wives and children.

1735
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,210
But...

1736
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,170
we won't go back, 
leaving one of us behind.

1737
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:51,270
Sir...

1738
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:52,820
We can't do anything 
with this, sir.

1739
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:54,140
What do we do now, sir?

1740
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,690
We just don't know what 
to do with guns, right?

1741
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:17,030
But no one has to teach us 
how to use this, right?

1742
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,100
Here.

1743
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:42,440
Cheers!

1744
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:36,660
What about the Maoists then?

1745
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,640
Keep it inside.

1746
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,700
Come on, throw it!

1747
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:12,980
Shoot him! 
ITBP!

1748
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,070
Shoot him!

1749
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:15,530
Kapil!

1750
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:19,790
Take him inside.

1751
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:23,960
Hey!

1752
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:26,840
We've come here to hold the 
elections without any obstructions!

1753
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:30,460
No one should obstruct our duty!

1754
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:33,180
Doesn't matter even if we lose our heads! 
Thrash those guys!

1755
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,880
Use this.

1756
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:44,110
Only emergency.

1757
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,810
Okay? 
- Okay sir.

1758
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,600
Beat them to pulp, boys!

1759
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,040
Hey Jojo!

1760
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:10,980
Shoot at least one 
of them down, man!

1761
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,960
Hit them!

1762
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,230
Didn't you have a gun? 
Couldn't you use it?

1763
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:15,350
Gun! Gun! Gun!

1764
01:56:35,890 --> 01:56:36,890
Beat them up!

1765
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:58,320
You won't understand what I say?

1766
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,350
You want a divorce?

1767
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:03,810
Six...

1768
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:04,930
Hit at least one, man!

1769
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:14,310
Hold this! 
Damn it!

1770
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,800
Jesus!

1771
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:48,400
Please let me hit at 
least one correctly.

1772
01:58:56,010 --> 01:58:57,120
Seven...

1773
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:16,720
Shot, sir!

1774
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,830
I shot him down, sir.

1775
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,610
Come on! Let's go! 
Run!

1776
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,800
Sir, they are coming again.

1777
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,960
They are coming again, sir.

1778
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,720
Come.

1779
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,220
My dear Jojo...

1780
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:45,860
Those are the ITBP people.

1781
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:47,750
I don't want to get 
scared again, man!

1782
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:49,120
Damn it!

1783
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,740
It's all right, sir. 
Consider this as an experience.

1784
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,200
Okay.

1785
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:19,650
Everything is done.

1786
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:22,740
You are relieved. 
You can go.

1787
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,620
Come. 
Let's get our luggage.

1788
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,920
'The one who searches for souls'

1789
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:10,710
What is it?

1790
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:14,150
I want to come here once again 
without the uniform & gun,

1791
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:15,720
... and then see this 
place properly.

1792
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,070
Come. 
Let's go.

1793
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:36,600
Are you all right?

1794
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:41,520
I'm going to the S.P.'s office tomorrow.

1795
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:44,300
To enquire about my son.

1796
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,940
I don't know your language.

1797
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,060
This is your land.

1798
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,170
Don't leave this place.

1799
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:03,350
Don't die.

1800
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:06,070
You should live.

1801
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:16,640
Sir, shall all of us 
click a photo together?

1802
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:34,070
Shall we go?

1803
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:36,410
Sir, will we have to use 
Lathis at the next place too?

1804
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,780
Or will we get more amenities?

1805
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:39,340
Bullets, right? 
- Yes.

1806
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:42,080
They will reach! 
Dream on!
