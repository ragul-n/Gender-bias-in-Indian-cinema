Get down ....

2
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,518
They are the bloody notorious criminals .
- Please don't beat me !

3
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,734
Please be seated.

4
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,711
Place it there ....

5
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,789
Your permit is going
to expire after 3 month's.

6
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,650
Apply for the request quickly.

7
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,953
lt's been orderedthat all the
lawsabidingthis matter should be strict.

9
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,903
l'm not feeling well ....

10
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,540
l don't know why are they
disturbingthis Old man ?

11
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,703
The S.P had claimedthat most of them
are not comingfor signing in the register.

12
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,839
l think some hadto be departedfrom here.

13
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,808
Most of the them are having difficulties.

14
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,351
They are having different kinda ailment's.
And some can't even walk without the help of others.

15
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,615
Even we have some restrictions ....

16
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,625
Shall l leave ...

17
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,944
There wasa call from Rauf ?

18
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,022
Enquiring that why did you visited
the Police Station without informing him ?

19
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,853
Even l too got scared ....

20
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,051
l'm pretty much worried
when you visit's the Police Station.

21
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,358
lsn't there any problem ?

22
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,426
He made me remember
that the permit is going to get expired.

23
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:15,208
Grandpa there had been
a Comedy Film telecasted in the T.V

24
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,574
Grandpa you missed it.

25
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,811
Didthe Police-mens beat you Grandpa ?

26
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,148
Come along ...

27
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,589
Police-mens won't beat your Grandpa.

28
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,023
Why are they goingto beat-up
this poor Old Man ?

29
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:37,853
My classmatesare sayingthat you will be
shot dead by the Police since you are a Pakistani.

30
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,691
Grandpa, Will Something like that occur ?

31
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,958
Stop your rubbish talk's ...
Let him take rest.

32
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,001
Your Grandma didn't like it .....

33
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,483
Dad, l will be leaving at evening.

34
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,950
Since the kids have to go
to their schools.

35
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,446
Dad, you must consult a Doctor.
You are very weak .

36
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,424
You come here let Grandpa
take some rest.

37
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,392
Can't you leave on
tomorrow morning in Rauf's Car.

38
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,752
She had to study at night
and we haven't taken the booksalong.

39
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:32,617
You are suffering from number of diseases.
So go to sleep after taking your medicines.

40
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,053
Yet the Almighty
is not calling me back.

41
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:43,752
Since your Dad had died quickly,
He might have decided to take away your life lately.

42
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,090
Dad died by the hands of Britisher's for
the sake of the Country.

43
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,265
And l might get died
asa Foreigner or asan Spy.

44
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,602
Everthing is like a Joke.

45
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,976
Again started
to think unwanted matters.

46
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,314
As per your request ....

47
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:09,580
Considering the decent records
of a Pakistan Citizen like you...

48
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:19,993
... had been allowedto reside in lndia
for one more year from 15-8-2001 to 1 4-8-2002.

49
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:29,275
During this span you shouldn't compete in any Election's
or get into any Political Party or any offence.

50
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:34,941
lf you are found guilty of getting
into any of these deeds ...

51
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:41,419
Then the permit for your stay in
lndia would be taken back.

52
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:50,294
And must register your sign in the Manjari
Police-Station between the 1st and 5th day of every month.

53
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,634
l think the officer's
had started to think wisely.

54
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:05,243
Many innocent fellows
will be saved if they wish.

55
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,447
They had carried out these
kinda Drama'sa number of times.

56
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:12,118
The superiors over the both side
are cruel and un-humanly.

57
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,679
Who is going to know about
the worry in the heart of the Poor's ?

58
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,915
They'll leave after quarelling
among each other.

59
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,697
Come in Hamsa ....

60
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,877
l haven't seen you from a longtime.
Please be seated.

61
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,681
The Police are a great nuisance.

62
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:46,050
They visit's the house twice in a week.
andabuses my Wife and kids.

63
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,447
Now l doesn't sit
in my house for too long.

64
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,282
What to do now ?

65
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,316
What should l say now ...

66
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,793
How can l ask you to fight a case,
who is finding hard to earn his own daily bread.

67
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,128
The Police is claiming
that l'm a Spy !

68
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,668
ln the recent notice they had asked me
to leave the place immediately.

69
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,171
lt's mentioned in it ....

70
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,281
You don't give up ...

71
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,512
Live in the same place
which had given you the birth.

72
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,912
You will have the help from the natives.
Don't sit in your house for too long.

73
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,349
There's no other remedy ....

74
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:33,692
You would get into trouble if caught by
the Police or the Advocates.

75
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:40,902
l'm confused Moosa Brother ...
The sight of my un-married daughter worries me.

76
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,176
They are looking after the family
after going for work.

77
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,239
Who is goingto marry them
seeing my condition ?

78
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,873
God why am
l not still dying !

79
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,685
Let me leave Moosa Brother.

80
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,130
Stop ...
Stop !

81
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,553
Grandpa l'm searchingfor you
since a longtime.

82
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,216
When l went to your house they said that you
had been to the Advocates Office.

83
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,627
And when l went there, you had gone to Police Station.
Atlast l hadfound you .

84
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,030
How are you going to find me if you search
at the time when l'm not available ?

85
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,520
Tell me ''Sahipichi'' ...

86
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,700
You have started teasing me
again calling ''Sahipichi''.

87
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:47,640
You have learn't the language of
the Britishersand had read lot of their Books .

88
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,509
... and had earneda Master's degree .
Then what shouldthis poor man address you as.

89
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:57,973
We and our Country could make such a
progress due to the education impartedto us.

90
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,087
Daughter, you shouldn't
say this to the Country-mens.

91
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,421
Our ancestors didn't fought against them
by taking up the education from the Britisher Schools.

92
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:11,620
Varian kuninu and Haji Mussaliar had gone to which
colleges to fight against the British Empire ?

93
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:16,363
kids like you won't understandthat.
So howfar is my work going on ?

94
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,696
For that you must first help me ....
l want to know some more things.

95
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,099
Grandpa, you must give
me those documents to refer.

96
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,700
And don't call me ''Sahipichi'' hereafter.

97
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,171
Ok as you wish ...
l shall provide you the documents.

98
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,272
Even if you write anything,
nothing good is goingto happen.

99
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,484
Yet it's good that
the World should be aware of it.

100
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,150
You haven't toldanythingabout your childhood.

101
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:42,488
What is there to say, the childhood of a
Poor isall the same with sufferingand disaster's.

102
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:48,928
My Father got killed by the hands of Britishers
in the Pukotur battle of 1921 .

103
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,727
He died when
my Mom was pregnant.

104
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,304
There were no one to help us.

105
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,074
l left my Home town at the age of 12.

106
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,110
Brother, please take care of my child well.

107
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,140
lsn't this Mumbai a Big Market ?

108
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,345
He is my only hope.

109
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,716
You don't worry about him.
He is like my own Son.

110
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,229
So shall we leave ....
Come along Son.

111
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,270
l wandered in most of the Cities in lndia.

112
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,277
To supress my hunger andto
look after my family.

113
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,817
From Mumbai l learnt the
art of making Beedi.

114
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,787
From there l had learnt to read
and write Malayalam.

115
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,746
From there l reached
''Mubarak Beedi'' Company in karachi.

116
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,654
Weren't you aware of the
lndependence Struggle duringthose days ?

117
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:54,366
Duringthose days poverty and worry
about unmarried Sister's had encaptivated my heart.

118
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:59,438
ln Bazar l used to hear People saying
the name of Gandhi and Nehru.

119
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:04,343
And l learned more about it
when l joinedthe struggle.

120
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,470
Andthat too not to a great extent.

121
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,078
lt's been too late ...
lt won't be good if l stay here further.

122
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,485
Mom will get worried ....
Shall l leave ...

123
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,747
l shall meet you later .

124
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,084
Should l drop you till the Bus stop.
- No need.

125
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,102
ls Advocate Ramakrishnan here ?

126
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,036
No, but his assistant hadtold that
he would be arriving soon.

127
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,750
keep it. . .
- Ok.

128
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,750
Moosa Shahib had arrived early.
Come along.

129
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,853
Be seated.

130
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,227
So How are you ?

131
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:08,964
Last week the Police Officer hadtold
that it's time to renew the Permit.

132
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,401
Yes we shall submit it immediately.

133
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,715
Along with that shall we pass on one
more request of no:92for the Citizenship.

134
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,314
There's some possibility for that.

135
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,754
lt's been saidthat
the Sumit is goingto take place.

136
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,847
Rafeeqandthe Convict
of the Perundalmana had come.

137
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,251
Ask them to wait.
- Ok.

138
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,757
We can try as you said.

139
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,593
Once they had returned it earlier.

140
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,536
Now after 8 years back...
Have to search the document's.

141
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,772
lt's not 8 but 10 year's had passed.

142
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,831
Anyways we can try for
it once again.

143
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,043
The documents might be there in the files.

144
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,137
We can claim that you were here in 1950's.

145
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,713
We can't apply on the same grounds
that we had applied earlier.

146
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:55,419
because at that time we were not able to prove that the
Pakistan passport was issued without your wish.

147
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,092
Can attach even the request of your wife.

148
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,424
And since you have
grown oldand has disease's.

149
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,462
lsn't this Lawsare meant for the humans ?

150
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,224
Don't leave the hope.

151
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,384
Afriend of Asharaf had come.

152
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:30,048
He toldthat his daughter is getting
some marriage proposals

153
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,349
Even she is goingto get married.

154
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,592
But she is still studying.

155
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,132
She was born when l arrived here
after leaving karachi forever.

156
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,404
She is our first Grand daughter.

157
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,540
From where is the proposal ?
No one had come here.

158
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,667
They are from the Qatar itself.

159
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,003
They are concernedabout the proposal
since you are a Pakistani.

160
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,680
l'm not a Pakistani.
l'm from Pukotur.

161
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,854
lt's the truth that is know to us.

162
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,220
You are a Foreigner in
front of the Law.

163
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,891
That's true ....

164
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:16,698
Because of that our Elder Son got settled in Gulf
saying that his Father isa Pakistani.

165
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:23,608
And our second Son shiftedto his own house claiming
that his childrens would get scared by the Police.

166
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,712
l'm awaiting when you too
are goingto leave me.

167
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,111
What's your problem ?

168
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:34,252
The Girls nowadaysare interested in living alone
with the family safeguardingtheir own interest.

169
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,647
And they too have
different kinda excuses for that.

170
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,957
Everyone is havinga way
to get escape.

171
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:49,401
Without whom should l share
the worry and pain in my heart from 10-40 years.

172
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,869
You are the only one to support me.

173
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,703
Should l give permission to Ashraf
to fix the marriage ?

174
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,244
Let them fix any proposal they like
l'm will be glad .

175
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,274
Anyways let the Guy they are looking
for her shall be well educated .

176
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,778
Don't just pursue
after money and wealth.

177
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,250
Hope they wouldallow our childto
pursue her education.

178
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,788
l shall bring you the medicines.

179
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,864
By the way Abu-Bakar,
Our Moosa is not yet to be seen.

180
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,834
He is been very lucky.
He had got the keeradath House so cheaply.

181
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,010
Moosa's Father wasa close
associative of keeradath House.

182
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,947
There is no need for a Father like that,
he is more than enough ....

183
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,582
He had started talking rubbish.

184
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,818
Hey fellow it's your daughter's
wedding today.

185
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,015
Could l stop from sayingthe truth even
if it's my daughter's weddingtoday.

186
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,202
Sainatha, why there is no Music ?
l can't hear khabisha singing.

187
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,831
Let everyone arrive ....
- Everyone is eagerly waitingto listen your song.

188
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,438
Stop flattering Brother Abubakhr.
Don't tease me ...

189
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,175
We were just talking about you.

190
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,354
He might have said something
rubbish in his gossip.

191
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,015
Whenever l tell the truth they say
that it's rubbish gossip.

192
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,428
When he used to live at Bistimula in Mumbai,
He was entitled with a nick-name as '' GossipingAbubakhr''.

193
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,558
Due to God's blessing he retainedthe name
in karachi andas well as here now.

194
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,468
Even his Father was not badat that.

195
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,629
Where is Vetisheri Abubakhr ?

196
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,865
He is here...
lt's his daughter's weddingtomorrow !

197
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,560
He isa Pakistani !

198
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,471
We have being orderedto arrest
and depart him to Pakistan as soon as possible.

199
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,369
Call him !

200
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,832
Sir, l shall come along with you tomorrow
after my daughter's wedding.

201

205
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,021
What are you doing ?
- You get into the Van.

206
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,325
Sir, please don't take him away ....
Let my daughter's marriage get over.

207
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,594
No one should create a problem ....
l had told you the seriousness of the matter.

208
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,993
Abubakhr come along.
- Daughter !

209
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,499
Please don't take him away !

210
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,693
Walk along ....

211
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,363
Son of Bloody Bitches !

212
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,965
My God !
- Walk along ....

213
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:16,136
That's the house of Abu-bakhr ...
l'm not coming, you go alone.

214
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,055
Wasn't there any Newsabout him later ?

215
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:29,584
We came to know that he was in a
Jail in karachi, after that he never come.

216
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,129
There was no mail from him.

217
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,872
And atlast we came to knew that
he died in a Hospital in karachi.

218
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,707
Mother, what is your belief ?

219
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,335
l feels that
he won't come back again.

220
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,647
So who carried
out the weddingafter that ?

221
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:54,176
Moosa and rest of his friend's some
how carried out the wedding.

222
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,514
She was that Bride ....
- Take the Tea ...

223
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,663
Do you have any photo of your Father ?

224
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,154
There might be some old one's.
Let me check it out.

225
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,627
lsn't your House name is Vetisheri ?

226
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,342
That day didn't anyone tried to
release him from the jail ?

227
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,745
We were not able to do that.

228
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,838
Here is the photo.

229
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,890
Hamsa, haven't you woken up yet !

230
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,302
Allah ! l thought that it
would be Police.

231
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,505
Moosa Brother ...
Please be seated.

232
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,010
From past two day's he
is not feeling well.

233
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,685
Yesterday too the Police
had come to visit.

234
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,855
He was not the Police-man
who usually visit's us.

235
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,790
He wasa kind hearted person.

236
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,089
He asked him to go somewhere else
away from home when he saw him here.

237
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:16,434
Hamsa, who is that Police-man ?
- l think his name is krishnan.

238
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:20,666
l think he is the Head-Constable.
He isabout to get retired.

239
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,706
There are good people's still
living in this World.

240
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,873
Yesterday while doing the prayer's
l felt like seeing you.

241
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:38,857
My feet'sare getting wounded
by this continuous walkingand hiding.

242
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,460
The Body start's itching whenever
l'm exposed to Sun-light.

243
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,260
My heart start's to beat heavily whenever
l listen to the sound of any incoming Vehicle.

244
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,530
lt's such a messy condition.

245
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,131
l had sat here itself
since l was not at all feeling well.

246
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,435
Yesterday my elder Son Ashraf had sent
some Money from Qatar.

247
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,678
Then l thought of giving
some money to you.

248
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,479
Leave after
having somethingto drink.

249
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,689
No need... Let me reach
my home before the Sun turns too hot.

250
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,212
When did you arrive, naughty girl ?
- We came last night .

251
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,883

253
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,121
Shall l serve Tea for you ?
- No ... l had my breakfast just now.

254
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,956
And Ashraf Brother had called me up.

255
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,691

256
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,626
Today he may call up Mom and Dad .

257

He hadtalked to your Father.

258
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,789

So you had arrived ....

260

Now you don't need
your Mom and Dad, lsn't it ?

261
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,711
Yesterday he awaitedthis
dogfor so long.

00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,611
Orelse l won't allow you to get in,
and shall make you get caught by the Police.

275

Don't do it...
- Shall l leave ....

276
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,137

any mental disturbance now ?

281
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,744
Mom hadtold me that a reporter is frequently
visiting him and enquiringabout the past.

282
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,953
Deny from saying it
if you dislike.

283
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,920
Get up ...

284
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,492
lt's not because of that.
She is a nice knowledgeable Girl.

285
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,772
l'm getting tired since
l'm getting older.

286
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,467
There is nothing to worry about.

287
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,475
Have the same medicines which
you are taking now.

288
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,102
His pressure is bit high.

289
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,934
You must take some rest.

290
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,413
lt's just few year's left,
should l waste it by taking rest.

291
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,608
We had been to your house ...
- Ooh it was you.

292
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,276
l thought it's some other trouble.

293
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,144
The S.P is very strict.

294
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,314
He had askedto
observe everyone in particular.

295
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:27,512
l couldn't find you last day
when l came to sign.

296
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,650
And l didn't even find anyone familiar.

297
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,616
Give him Rs 500.
l'm not having enough money in my pocket.

298
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:45,931
Start the vehicle ....

299
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,449
Who is it coming ...
lt's our Moosa Brother.

300
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,104
She is looking like ''Singer Noojhan''

301
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,608
ls she your new Bride ?
Anyways she is really beautiful .

302
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,776
When was the wedding ?

303
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,611
Abdul Rahman, you
please keep your mouth shut !

304
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,976
Come in ....

305
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,718
Sulaika... just come out ...

306
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,520
lt's our Moosa
and newly wedded Bride.

307
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,856
Abdul Rahman, she isa reporter.
l'm fed up of him !

308
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,154
He doesn't know what he is saying !
What to do .

309
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,089
Come in ..

310
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,999
Don't take his words seriously.

311
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,457
She had come to see Abdul Rahman.

312
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,640
And l'm not able to
go everywhere like earlier.

313
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,875
And she is scared to
come alone.

314
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,010
How is he ?

315
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,280
Now the condition had gone worse.
He is deprived of sleep .

316
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,372
And he is not eating his
foods properly.

317
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,084
What is she saying ?

318
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,819
Your Father is Crack.

319
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,720
Does she know
what is happening in this world ?

320
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,425
Last week the Police had come to visit him.

321
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,294
lt get's worse after their visit's.

322
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,497
Moosa Brother l got hold of both
of the personalities.

323
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,300
lt's been so hard to findthem.
- Whom ?

324
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,435
l'm talking about
that Nehru and Jinnah.

325
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:30,775
l took our krishnan kutty and Aftab
from karachi in front of these personalities.

326
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,779
And askedthem could you
tell us from where do they belong ?

327
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,981
Nehru andJinnah laughed.

328
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,485
They laughed like the Britisher's.

329
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,283
l got angry and beat them hard.

330
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,491
Then l askedthem again could
you tell us from where do they belong ?

331
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,889
Then they made it clear.
That they belongto our Country.

332
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,535
l have to go and see the advocate
and give a petition.

333
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,901
lt's due to the shortage
of money we are not going.

334
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,081
Will l get the Citizenship ?

335
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,817
l enfurled so many details in front of them.

336
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,047
l toldthem even about
the beedi mending works in Bistimula.

337
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,522
And l toldthem that
l worked as Bar-tender in Mysore.

338
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,322
And even toldthem that l workedat
Mubarak Beedi manufacturing company in karachi

339
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:22,881
But they didn't give it.

340
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,463
karachi Police-mens had beaten me hard.

341
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,294
They put me in jail so many times.

342
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,735
So it's the government here
who should give me the Citizenship.

343
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,000
Request them that please don't
send me back to karachi.

344
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,077
Stop crying ...

345
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,240
You come and interview Sulaika later.

346
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,114
Shall l leave...

347
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,692
Moosa Brother ...

348
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,127
Moosa Brother ...

349
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,500
l forgot to say something.

350
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,108
l had searchedfor
Sardar Vallabhai Patel alot.

351
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,044
l heardthat he is been
taken away by the ''Vishwa Hindu's''

352
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,410
l hadasked him to visit me
when ever he comes.

353
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,244
Citizenship !

354
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,196
lsn't anyone here ?

355
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,426
There are no ladies here.

356
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,705
Could you just open the door ?

357
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,798
l want to enquire about something.

358
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,146
What do you want ?
- l'm from Media ....

359
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,773
l had come to visit you on
Moosa's saying.

360
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,183
l don't care who had sent you.

361
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,847
Not only the reporter's but even the
God can't save me from here.

362
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,282
You leave from here.

363
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,593
Uncle Hamsa, please come outside.
l want to take a Photo of your's.

364
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,794
l want to enquire many things.

365
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,421
lt's not to harm you.

366
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,366
lf you have some humanity then
please leave from here.

367
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,766
l don't want to see anyone in this world.

368
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,605
l think the rice has been boiled.

369
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,925
He might be comingafter having
the meals from there.

370
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,756
Nadira wouldn't have allowed
him to leave.

371
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:42,929
''Mother, don't you feel depressed living with
a person who is always being chased by the Police....

372
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,827
... and had to spent most of his time in hide-out's ?''

373
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,681
Our depression is not so important.

374
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:01,141
But l feel upset when l think about
those people who are bearing this stress.

375
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,786
How did Grandpa baredall
this severe conditions ?

376
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,397
At first he never usedto go outside.

377
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,601
And now he reveals somethingto me.

378
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:21,572
His great depression is to
die asa foreigner.

379
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:28,273
He feels so proud when he say'sabout
the Father's pension recievedto his Mother.

380
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,613
Do you know all these peoples ?

381
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,421
l do know many thing's ....
But most of them are not alive now .

382
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,391
There wasa girl named khadisha .

383
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,656
She was one of his relative.

384
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,433
khadisha knew how
to readand write Malayalam .

385
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,869
She knew everything
along with singing and dancing.

386
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,130
khadisha and the Groom would
leave by the next Train.

387
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,975
We would be visiting you frequently.

388
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,577
The karachi is just nearby.

389
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,102
He is speaking as
if karachi is located in Manjeri.

390
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,271
lsn't it , Moosa ?

391
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,649
After khadisha had left, the song's in
the weddingare not so pleasing and soothing.

392
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,429
lt's been so many years
l hadn't hearda songfrom you.

393
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,197
C'mon singfew lines ....

394
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,826
Moosa is crazy about khadisha's song.
He always makes her sing.

395
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,304
Her Father was too like that.

396
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,068
Since you are leaving sing
few lines to him.

397
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,373
Cmon sing ...

398
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,488
Yesterday there wasa mail from khadisha.

399
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,525
l got disturbedafter readingthe letter.

400
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,899
lt's was not like
the usual letter's from her.

401
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,528
khadisha haven't likedthat place.

402
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,165
lt would change with
course of time

403
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,175
Most of the Grief and depression would
drive away after having kids.

404
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,633
lt's been four yearsafter her marriage.

405
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,039
Aunty you don't get tensed about it.

406
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,280
Now l feels that there was
no needfor such kinda proposal.

407
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,853
lt's our fate !

408
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,912
Everything happensaccordingto his wish.

409
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,258
Shall l take tea for you ?

410
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,488
No dear ...
Let me leave ....

411
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,823
Tell Moosa to come and visit me.

412
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,057
He had gone to Manjeri ,
l shall inform it on his return.

413
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,960
Let me take your leave.

414
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,223
Ramakrishna, make sure you have
the money before betting.

415
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,758
l have been playing card's for many years,
its not the first time.

416
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,658
But you bet for higher amount's even
if you don't have any money.

417
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,502
Brother Moosa ....

418
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,352
lsn't she the daughter of our Sainatha ?
- Yes ...

419
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,255
lts not been long

420
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,462
l left that place ....

421
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,920
That Man married
a Pakistani women from there.

422
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,261
Did he divorced you ?

423
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,940
No ...
But he asked me to be his second wife.

424
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,965
But my heart didn't agreed for that.

425
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,010
l'm coming along
with you to your house.

426
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,504
l shall come soon .....

427
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,261
Don't hurt aunty by
complainingabout unnecessary stuffs.

428
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,195
l won't hurt anyone .....

429
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,928
l haven't hurted anyone
till this year's.

430
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,778
Aunt Sainam ....

431
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,895
Dear why did you return ?

432
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,830
Dear what had happenedto you ?

433
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,705
Aunt you don't enquire anything now.

434
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,505
She is tiredafter travelling.
Let her take rest .

435
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,573
Moosa what had happened ?

436
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,375
She toldthat she had quarreled
with her husband.

437
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,444
There's something serious ....
Orelse she won't have returned ....

438
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,788
l shall post a mail
to karada Abdul Rahman.

439
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,779
He isa close friend of the Groom.

440
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,784
Let me try
if anything could be done.

441
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,328
Son, you must do something .
- Aunt you don't get worried.

442
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,694
Don't scold her ....

443
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,931
Shall l leave ...

444
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,599
Daughter khadisha ...
What have you decided ?

445
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,538
To stay in the country where l was born.

446
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,267
Orelse what can l do ?

447
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:44,266
Daughter what are you saying !

448
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,970
l carried out your marriage by
taking so much of trouble.

449
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,044
God .... My daughter's fate had
turned just like mine.

450
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,019
Dear you go there once again.

451
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,923
lf someone is goingto karachi from the Native,
l shall send you along.

452
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,481
l'm not going anywhere !

453
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:08,756
l'm fed up of that enclosed Gown,
the tasteless food'sand a Cruel Husband ....

454
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,828
The desire to stay
with the husband had gone.

455
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,262
Tomorrow we must go and visit Maika ...
- Ok we can go ...

456
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,431
He wouldask to work
asa servant in his house.

457
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,506
l had seen a lot.

458
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:25,249
Let's go there after all they
are our relatives.

459
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:30,016
'' Those who are rich are his friends,
and who have nothingare his labour's ''

460
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:44,161
You don't worry dear ....
l shall pray for your welfare.

461
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,970
The almighty would surely
show usa way.

462
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,667
My heavenly father,
please save this orphan's !

463
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,325
Aunt, where are you going
at this early morning ?

464
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,954
l'm visiting my younger Brother.
Since he is the only relative that l have.

465
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,200
Son, where are you going ?

466
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,565
l'm going to Manjeri.

467
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,361
On the way
l thought of visiting you.

468
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,173
You might be knowingthat
khadisha's Visa had got expired.

469
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,908
ln the usual case they
won't allow for it.

470
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,877
lt's not so easy for women's since
they can't stay in hide-out's.

471
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,813
l'm clueless....

472
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,782
And she is not at all agreeing for
returningto Pakistan.

473
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,719
By the way, Son how are you able
to stay in the Country ?

474
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,255
l'm continuing my stay by remaining in
the hide-out'sand offering Bribes.

475
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,722
Don't know when
l'm goingto get caught !

476
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,359
What should be done so
that l can stay here ?

477
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,055
l won't return to that place
even if they kill me !

478
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,432
lt would be too expensive
if you go to court.

479
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,094
Aunt Sainam won't be
able to afford it.

480
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,840
Would the Advocate be able to help us ?
- May be, since it's his profession.

481
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,043
May be the Police might show some pity
over you since you are a women.

482
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,812
khadisha think once again ...

483
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:06,044
Nothing is going to work out since
you are bearinga Pakistani passport.

484
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,352
Enough ...

485
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,490
This kid won't allow us to talk.
- Go ...

486
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:25,402
khadisha tried everything to continue
the stay in the country.

487
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,233
Didn't Moosaka helped her ?

488
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,867
He talked to many of
the advocates.

489
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,706
Then nothing worked out.

490
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,504
What could be done by
khadisha's Mother !

491
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,086
lt's better
we don't talk about it.

492
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,489
Aunt Sainam, found it difficult to
even earn his daily living.

493
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,861
Where have you been ?

494
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,369
Nothing ... Nothing ....

495
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:08,577
l went to do some house hold work's
in my Uncle's house.

496
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,780
Since we have to earn our livelihood.

No one went to
bid farewell to khadisha.

545
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:52,269
He too was not able to go there since
he was hiding from the Police.

546
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,740
That day he was in grief.

547
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,541

ls there any News about
your Elder brother ?

616
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,629
There wasa call from him.

617
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,597
Those who made the proposal are
demanding a lot as Dowry.

618
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,291
Tell them they can offer
what they can afford.

619
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:03,006
Don't give tensions to the girl
by unnecessary talks.

620
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,735
They are bit greedy.

621
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,705
lf it was my daughter l wouldn't have ever given
my daughter to these greedy peoples.

622
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:16,515
Earlier the natives here won't even take
proposal from that state.

623
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,384
The people there had helped
the Britisher's during the uprising of 1921 .

624
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,594
Nowadays they don't consider that.

625
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,296
Let's not say anything now.

626
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,923
Let everything be
done accordingto his wish.

627
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,233

628
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,669
Citizenship .... Passport ....
Border ....

629
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,209
They are taking away my
peace of mind.

630
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,580
Police - The Son of bitchesare not
allowing me to live.

631
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,911
What had happened now ?

632
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:49,178
They frequently visit's my home ,
tortures andabuses me.

633
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,610
Foolish Mens ...

634

What kinda passport ?

636
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,994
They don't know
that the world had changed.

637
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,396
Now they are imposingtwo laws
by a Single ruler.

638
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,728
What is the new law ?

639
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,566
Secularism ....

640
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,806
l'm scared ...

641
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,331
Wouldthey hurt Sulaika ?

642
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,905
For God sake please tell
to the Police ....

643
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,140
l'm not able to sleep....

644
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,084
l won't meet any of the leader's .
Almighty ....

645
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,887

You usedto be such a brave man !

01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:31,559
Even till now it's so excitingto

01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,519
Cheer up !

649
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,899
What is there to cheer up !
The world is full of injustice !

650
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,701
Since there is no one to stop it.

651
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,192
Why are you cryingAbdul Rahman ?

652
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,639
Then what would Sulaika do ?

653
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,473
l hadtold her to leave me.

654
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,544
Let she marry someone else.

655
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,377
Atleast she could live without
fearingthe Police.

656
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,952
My fate !

657
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,867
ln the report that we got,
there is nothing mentally wrong with karad.

658
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,598
lsn't he does spy work's for
the enemies during the night time ?

659
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,332
He is not at all sleepingat night.

661

663
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,424

Delhi too reveals the same.

664
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,993

01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,642
l would put an end
to that within a day !

672
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,236
You may leave ...

673
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,215
Grandpa let's leave ...

674
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,882
That S.P isan animal .

675
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,960
Let's leave and look for some
other alternative way.

676
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,370
Don't cry ...

677
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:33,075
You are very well aware of the
Police-men's behaviour.

678
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:37,320
Yet l thought of just giving a try.

679
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,188
Come.. There is no use of sheding
your tears in this World.

680
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,461
He is in Mecca ...
Would be arriving by tomorrow.

681
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,137
Moosaka nothing could be
done in this matter.

682
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,310
The Party is Consisting of 2-3 M.P's ...
Can't anything be done even if they wish ?

683
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,143
There are some hinderance in this Case.

684
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:07,080
karadan isa Mental Patient.

685
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:11,954
You know l can't even whisper the name
of our Political Party in Delhi.

686
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,324
They are claiming that karadan
isa Pakistani Spy.

687
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:19,362
The leader's of our party had warned us not
to even say the name of that Country !

688
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,732
Moosaka you can ask for
any other help ....

689
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,893
We had come to
discussabout karadan's matter.

690
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,104
l had read your articles.

691
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,937
The one that you had written against
the Financer's andthe Police.

692
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,009
Shall we leave ...

693
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:36,604
Moosaka sorry l couldn't help you.
Please don't feel bad .

694
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,252
Who is it !
Please come in ...

695
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,254
No ... Since you
were about to leave.

696
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,552
Today there would be two strikes.
So l would be very busy .

697
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,929
You might be knowing our karadan Abdul Rahman.
Yes indeed ...

698
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,097
The Pakistani
who is mentally disturbed.

699
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,928
The Police is torturing him a lot.

700
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,435
And his condition is getting worse.

701
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:00,736
Something should be done .

702
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,538
This is problem is out of our reach.

703
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:03,971
lt'san lnternational problem.

704
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,607
Can you do anything about it.

705
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,570
This problem wouldturn out
to be a national issue.

706
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,680
Only the big committee could influence it.

707
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,248
Vasu brother
you must do something.

708
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,449
lt's really miserable .

709
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,818
Usha, you might be knowing everything.

710
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,653
We have lots of restrictions.

711
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,520
Even then l shall talk to my leaders.

712
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:24,994
Could you call up the Police station ?

713
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:29,999
No need if he calls them, then this poor
fellow hadto answer in front of many peoples.

714
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,933
l'm in a hurry...
Shall l leave .

715
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,934
Ok leave ...

716
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,874
l thought atleast Vasu could help us.

717
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,248
Vasu and his colleaguesare
really nice guys.

718
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:54,757
Just can't understand what they are saying,
while deliveringthe Speech.

719
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,055
Now what should be done ?

720
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,163
From now onwards l won't go in front
of politicians for help.

721
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,723
l knew it earlier that they won't be able
to do anything in this matter.

722
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,768
l had come on your saying.

723
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,328
We must visit some Advocates.

724
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,535
lt would be bit expensive.

725
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:15,507
ln the case of karadan, there is even no
one to look after his matter's.

726
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,043
Shall we meet Advocate Ramakrishnan ?

727
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,943
He charges a lot as fee.

728
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,453
He takesaway an appreciable amount
from the money sent by my kids.

729
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,286
l know two advocates named,
Pradeep and Fazal .

730
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:28,958
We can handover the case to
one amongthem.

731
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,761
They won't charge too much
if their client is poor.

732
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,463
Hand it over to Pradeep.

733
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,953
Why not Fazal ?

734
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,768
Nothing ...

735
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,638
They are scared to interfere in
these kinda matter's.

736
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,373
l'm saying it due to the experience.

737
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,309
ls it ?

738
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,871
From when l had startedthis investigation
everything is turning out to be astonishing.

739
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,285
lt'sa crucial matter.

740
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,087
We can try an attempt.

741
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,823
He is miserable and poor.

742
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,491
He is not havinganyone to even run behindthis issue.

743
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,394
First we can give a petition to
the State embesy.

744
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,596
After that quickly
we have to apply for a stay order.

745
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,087
His disease is a strong legal point.

746
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,568
You can handover the documents to me.
l shall get it signed.

747
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,435
We have to offer somethingto the Police
so that they won't disturb him.

748
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,172
Who is he ?

749
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,845
Waliagath Moosa ...
He is residing here with 1 to 1 year permit.

750
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,082
He is the one who is helping this poor's .

751
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,984
How did you got into it ?
-Asa part of a project.

752
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,823
He is having some proof and documents.

753
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,348
You always get's into
this serious kinda issues,isn't it

754
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,297
karadan sound is not to be heard.

755
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:50,906
Dear he is not here.

756
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:55,275
The natives here hadtaken and locked him
in a distant relatives house.

757
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,876
He would come after two days.

758
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,641
Did he agreed for it ?

759
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,041
Some how they took him.

760
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,686
He isabusing the Police.

761
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,019
So the Police had startedto come and
disturb him frequently.

762
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,723
Please put your signature here.

763
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,067
Take his thumb impression on it.

764
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,864
l shall get his signature on it.
- Ok ....

765
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,236
Didn't you took karadan
for any treatment ?

766
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,242
We tried all that was possible.

767
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,267
He wasa great knowledgeable man.

768
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,646
He was well versed about the
Politics of that time.

769
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,316
Moosa and his friends used to get
astonished by his speech.

770
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,612
He was being severely
tortured in karachi, lsn't it ?

771
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,013
He sometime say'sabout it.

772
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,484
By hanging upside down, the karachi Police
and Military mens used to torture him a lot.

773
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,924
He get's violent when he talks
about those cruel mens.

774
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,911
Have you decidedto stay here itself ?

775
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:07,481
You were in a deep sleep.

776
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,485
Let me go and wash my face.

777
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,925
l think she is hailingfrom
a poor family.

778
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,861
She asked me for some starch water.
And on giving she drank it .

779
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,898
l enquiredabout his house
a couple of times.

780
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,832
She won't utter a word.

781
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,532
And would change the topic.

782
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,166
l went in search of your house.

783
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:38,574
You won't be able to figure it out so easily.
Have to work harda bit to find my house.

784
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:41,512
Atleast tell us now
who all are there in your family ?

785
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,345
Mother, Brother is in Mumbai
and Dad died .

786
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,589
Didn't anyone approach you with
marriage proposals ?

787
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,459
The desired proposal had
not come yet.

788
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:55,798
Will you be able to pay the dowry ?
- Oh yes, we are very rich .

789
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:00,569
Anyhow you got born
in a respected state like our's.

790
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,867
That's why l'm not scared of anyone.

791
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:06,302
This is the soil which
even made the Britisher's to Shiver !

792
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,078
They claimedthis country asa hell.

793
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,046
And now even their slaves
are claiming the same.

794
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,843
Who are the slaves ?

795
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:17,846
Everyone expect
this oldand elderly peoples.

796
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,751
Grandpa you are sweeping
from the bottom.

797
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,260
This is not just the knowledge
acquired by reading.

798
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,528
l acquired it being with my natives.

799
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:30,131
We wouldacquire knowledge
when we are living in between the peoples.

800
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:31,496
The food had been served.

801
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,061
Come .

802
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,105
l just need little ...
- lt's less ...

803
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:52,979
Grandpa, why didn't the thinker's like this
got into power after the partition ?

804
01:09:54,723 --> 01:10:01,797
Even the leader's who took the initiative for partition
didn't knew that the Country is getting endangered.

805
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,166
Then what about this poor peoples ....

806
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:10,435
Britain did this to trick our leader's
who were greedy for getting into power.

807
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,508
lt seems that you don't have any
objection towards ''Mahatma Gandhi''.

808
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:18,836
Britains trick didn't worked
out in front of him.

809
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,587
Moosaka the Cirle lnspector hadasked
you to come and visit him.

810
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,455
Ok.. l shall visit him by tomorrow.

811
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,319
What is she doing here ?

812
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,190
She is a news reporter.

813
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:33,162
We know's it well .....
You might be tryingto find loop holes in Police.

814
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,397
We can't stop from doing our
work because of you all.

815
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,199
Your work !

816
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,724
Don't act to smart ....

817
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,871
Moosaka you don't carry this trouble
maker along with you.

818
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,206
Dear would you get into trouble ?

819
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,941
Even l'm born in this Soil ....
They won't dare to do anything !

820
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,518
She isa brave girl .....

821
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,491
Moosa Shahib the reply for your
request letter had arrived.

822
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:09,829
Do you know English ?

823
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:15,630
Since it's our Mother tongue ...
Could we refrain from learning it !

824
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,863
l know about 10-30 words.

825
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:25,681
Your request could only be taken into
consideration if you take a Pakistan Passport.

826
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,809
So you must apply for a Pakistani Passport.

827
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,453
From where am l going to
get the Passport at thisage ?

828
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,589
Here there are proof that you
are a Pakistani citizen.

829
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,125
And it's true that you don't have a
passport along with you.

830
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,594
The law would follow the
rulesabide to it.

831
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,357
Take your copy .

832
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:03,279
ln the letter from the S.P he had again asked
me to create a Pakistani passport.

833
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,678
What should l tell to them ...

834
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:11,022
You go to sleep..
We can think about it latter .

835
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:16,231
lt's not like earlier ...
You are getting weak .

836
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,062
That Usha is in the next room.

837
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,096
She want's to talk about something.

838
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,539
She want to know about
so many thing's.

839
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,475
Sometimes l feel
like laughing at her queries.

840
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,342
She even want's to know about the
relation between us.

841
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:43,288
He becomes restless
if l'm not near to him.

842
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:47,996
While sleeping he places his hand over me
to check whether l'm near to him.

843
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:52,933
He say's that the sleep is with
fear so he does that.

844
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,271
lt might be due to love...

845
01:12:56,271 --> 01:13:01,110
You could consider it
only like that.

846
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,946
Many people had migrated
from kannur, lsn't it ?

847
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,582
ls Granpa keeping
in touch with those still now ?

848
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,184
Yes there are some contacts with them.

849
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,881
khadisha's Husband was from Pannur.

850
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:16,922
Even there were too many peoples of this kind.
But most of them got perished .

851
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,960
Nabisa and Usman were from
Chakara Parambu.

852
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,264
Ashraf is not yet to be seen.

853
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,363
Where had he gone ?

854
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,477
lt's been a longtime l
haven't seen you.

855
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:38,571
Earlier l usedto see
you atleast within two weeks.

856
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,516
Nowadays l don't move out from my house.

857
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,780
There is no information regarding my
husbands were about's.

858
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,417
Everyone is claimingthat he
is not in karachi.

859
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:46,918
Then where should l search for him ?

860
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,992
You don't worry .... He might be safe somewhere.
He would surely come .

861
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,960
Go and check it
out through a Paranomist.

862
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,088
Will he be able to tell us clearly about his where abouts ?

863
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,615
From how long is he away from here ?

864
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:21,016
lt's been a year ...
And their is no information regarding him.

865
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,797
l'm seeing the person ...
He had lost his youth and grown old, lsn't it ?

866
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,804
He isa fearful person ...

867
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,473
Yes he fears the Police.

868
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,943
l can see a
person running with fear.

869
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,311
The place is not clear.

870
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,144
l'm not confident about the
place where he is now.

871
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,248
The desire to return is not
at all to be seen in him.

872
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,657
Please tell him to come at any cost.

873
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:59,093
There is no sign of his return soon.

874
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,732
Let me try .
Since he hadto be brought back.

875
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,222
There would be some expenses.

876
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,861
Would it cost much ?
- Let's try.

877
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,900
Aren't you from his family ?

878
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,835
Come after 2 days ..
- ok.

879
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,134
Don't worry .

880
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:20,447
Let me study everything in detail.
Everything would be fine .

881
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:51,011
He had come atlast.

882
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,619
ls it the Police ?

883
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,382
karachi Police .

884
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,786
He is very scared
after returningfrom there.

885
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,803
Nabisha tried out most of the treatment's.

886
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,606
And she went before
many priest's to cure his disease.

887
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,974
And she had gone to each and every place.

888
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:03,445
And later on his Son too turned
out to be like his father, scaredand silent.

889
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,317
Sometimes Nabisha usedto come
beside usand cry.

890
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,249
What is Nabisha's condition now ?

891
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:18,264
Last year Nabisha died suddenly.

892
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,160
She was not sufferingfrom any particular disease.

893
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,437
She died by takingtensions.

894
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:28,673
Now his Son is guardingthe Father.

895
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,602
He feels that his
Mom would come back.

896
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:36,574
There'sa women in their relation.
She cooks the meals for them.

897
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:43,282
Mom is not here ...
She would return after few days.

898
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,816
l had come on Moosaka's saying ...

899
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,698
Why had you come ?

900
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,134
l had come to see Usman and his Son.
l want to take some photo of their's.

901
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,068
l had come on Moosaka's saying ...

902
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:58,740
Daughter, they might have informed you about everything.
l don't know what are you upto ....

903
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,537
Usman is inside ....

904
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:32,562
Close the door !

905
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:40,242
Go away ....
Shut the door !

906
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:45,654
Close the door the karachi Police is
comingto take me away.

907
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,678
Shut the door !

908
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,557
Shut the door ...!
Orelse they would take me.

909
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,298
Shut the door !

910
01:18:56,298 --> 01:19:01,069
Mom would be coming soon...
Don't be scared !

911
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,536
Mom would be coming soon.

912
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:07,568
Don't be scared !

913
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:29,331
lt's a good one ...
And is havingfat.

914
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,458
Nowadays everyone
is just buying the Chicken.

915
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,002
She had arrived with the meat ?
- You hadarrived.

916
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,470
Ooh... l'm not keen
to bring meat for you.

917
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,495
l know you are a miser from earlier.

918
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,775
Mom, where is Dad ?
- Dad had gone out.

919
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,443
Why Dad isalways wandering
with that Usha ?

920
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,411
She was notorious from the
time of college.

921
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,436
He might be behind her at that time.

922
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,684
You listen to her foolish words.

923
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,946
Our Dad would get into trouble.

924
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,155
Police have a cold war with that girl.

925
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,123
Shamsudin Sir had askedto be precautious.

926
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,459
They are blamingthat
she is betraying the Nation.

927
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,495
There is nothing wrong with her ...
She is brave and intelligent.

928
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,122
Guy's are jealousabout her.

929
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,166
You both don't
quarrel upon this matter.

930
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,802
She isa kind girl.

931
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,168
She won't get scared so easily.

932
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:14,339
l saw it that day how bravely he
talkedto the Police-mens.

933
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,245
Then you both make her stay here.

934
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,338
And so that we can marry her to you.

935
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,917
See he is blushing.

936
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,385
l'm not sayinganything.
you will regret it later.

937
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,645
What's wrong with him ?

938
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,994
There won't be any difficulty
in findingthe way.

939
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,985
Anyone would show you this Bungalow.

940
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,333
You fooled me....

941
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,962
Will you come to visit me
if l say this was my background.

942
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:46,403
You are a witty fellow ...
Didn't she got any marriage proposal's ?

943
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,179
No ... Everyone is leaving
away after lookingat this house.

944
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,249
Aguy came here with a proposal
that he loves her a lot.

945
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:57,650
After visiting here ...
He ended up all his love and left.

946
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:03,115
Love is meant for rich peoples, lsn't it ?

947
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,153
Grandpa you sometime say's the truth.
That's the attitude l like about you.

948
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:10,599
You even came to know
that l speaksabout the truth seldom.

949
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:15,229
l would end my life if l find a person
on this earth who always speaks the truth.

950
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,538
You won't findanyone
who always speaks the truth.

951
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,475
Grandpa you told
a truth one more time.

952
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:22,067
Shall l serve tea for you ?
- No ...

953
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:27,080
l shall come later.
Since Usha is our leader !

954
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,525
Today l visited Usha's house.

955
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:51,066
When l went to Manjeri
l thought of visiting her house

956
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,574
After visiting, l regreted
- Why ?

957
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:59,814
She was just boasting ....

958
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:03,614
What you said was right...
She is hailingfrom a poor family.

959
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:07,145
l think they don't
even have enough to eat.

960
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,252
l never heard of her
saying about her problem's.

961
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,396
She alway's fake's .....

962
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:18,799
Sometime she forceibly gives the auto fare.

963
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,969
l got really surprised ....

964
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,838
She had grown older than the
age of getting married.

965
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:27,742
lf it was from our family,
She would have got 2-3 kidsat this time.

966
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:32,247
Who would be willingto marry a girl
who is not even havinga proper Job.

967
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:36,274
Nothing could be offered from his family as dowry
and even her Father is not alive.

968
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:44,225
From my experience the
late marriage's are usually successful.

969
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,921
Something good will happen to her.

970
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:57,005
From where are you coming ?
You are looking so exhausted ....

971
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:59,474
Your face is looking as if you have
participated in a hunger strike.

972
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,577
l hadto meet some people.
So l was busy. . .

973
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,307
l didn't got time
to even have my food.

974
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,215
l was searchingfor you.

975
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,513
The Police is after you ...
So be cautious !

976
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,324
lt's good if the Police
are developing human values.

977
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,794
What happenedabout karadan's Case ?
- The medical reports should be submitted quickly.

978
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,364
Andalong with that some certificates from
the School too should be provided.

979
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,533
Moosaka didtold me that
he used to reada lot.

980
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,303
Let me try ...
And l shall submit the certificates soon.

981
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,838
Where are you about to go ?
l shall drop you till there.

982
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,773
No... l'm on the way to
the bus stop.

983
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:33,001
C'mon pop in ...

984
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:48,379
There are no brave guy's here.

985
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:53,188
l must visit Gandhi and Abdul Rahman Shahib.

986
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:59,100
Abdul Rahman Shahib hadtold so many
times that Place won't suit us.

987
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:04,800
He hadasked so many times that a
Malabari couldadapt to their food.

988
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,401
Who is going to listen !

989
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,452
lt's been few daysafter hisarrivals.
Now there is some peace here.

990
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,155
The Police are not visiting him
for past few weeks.

991
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,856
l had come to take the Medical certificate.

992
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,019
And could you find
any old certificates of his.

993
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,195
l hadarranged for the
Doctor's certificate.

994
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:30,231
Two year's back the School
where he took the education got shut down.

995
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,001
All the proof's had been transfered
to some other Office.

996
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,602
We should get it ready from there.

997
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:36,938
The advocate had told
it would be better if we get that.

998
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,769
l hope we will get that

999
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,977
Shouldn't some fee's
be given to the advocate ?

1000
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,506
He is not greedy for money.

1001
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,271
No need for it now.....

1002
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,552
So you are the one
who is tryingto save us now ?

1003
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,881
Would it result in the way likeJinnah Sir
triedto protect the Muslims ?

1004
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,598
Dear you don't take it seriously.

1005
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:04,933
Where is Moosaka ?

1006
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,527
Had be gone to get marriedagain ?

1007
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,496
What could be done
other than that in the old age !

1008
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,389
Don't you knowthat you have to come and sign in
Police station between 1st and 5th day of every month.

1009
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,028
Are you trying to increase our work load !
Walk in ....

1010
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,971
Should l send notice to you ?

1011
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,405
l would lock you behindthe bars.

1012
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,274
l'm sparing you
since you are an old man.

1013
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:49,277
l didn't do it intentionaly.
l was not at all feeling well.

1014
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:52,780
Yesterday Dinesh Sinha Sir called me up
andasked to arrest you.

1015
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,650
l settled it with so much difficulty.
Are you aware of that ?

1016
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,481
Go and put your signature ...

1017
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,835
Why are you so depressed ?

1018
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,870
Why didthey pick you up ?

1019
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,339
For delayingto sign ....

1020
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,275
lt's my fault ....
l didn't go since l was not feeling well.

1021
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:25,747
l would have taken him if you
just called me up.

1022
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:29,117
Should we plead for help from
you all at this old age.

1023
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:33,388
Don't you know that your
father doesn't ask's for anyones help !

1024
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:37,484
l didn't think about it ....
l forgot about it since l was busy.

1025
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,690
lt's ok ...

1026
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:56,673
Why are you not sayinganything ?

1027
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:04,018
ln early day's l had taken so much
scoldingfrom the Police.

1028
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,248
And hadtaken so much of beating's.

1029
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:15,926
The karachi Police had beaten me
hard all night long earlier.

1030
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:22,133
At that time
it didn't hurted me much.

1031
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:28,574
Anyways your mind is not as
strongas before.

1032
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,077
l had grown old ....

1033
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:44,956
My fate is to live like a thief in my
own Country till death.

1034
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:51,854
God, l'm not able to finda place in the Country
for which my Father hadfought for !

1035
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,359
God, lt'sall your plays ...

1036
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:03,274
Yesterday l dream't about Rahimka.

1037
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,306
Why are you talking like this ...
Forget about Rahimka...

1038
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,351
lt's been all over ....

1039
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:31,236
Rahimka do you want some more water ?

1040
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:33,641
No need ...

1041
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,581
When did we go to sleep yesterday ?

1042
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,089
Anyhow l woke up early.

1043
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:44,091
l too hada sound sleep.
Hamsa's wedding was Grand.

1044
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,058
Yes it was grand !

1045
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,495
l was not at all well to
attendthe wedding.

1046
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:50,953
l don't know how
l reached here from kunnur.

1047
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:55,703
l thought of attending his marriage
at any cost since his wasa late marriage.

1048
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:57,330
Please come and have your breakfast ...
- Come in ...

1049
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:12,753
Rahimka you are
not visiting here regularly.

1050
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,516
l'm not well dear.

1051
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:16,958
Where are your kids ?

1052
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,516
They had went to learn the Gospel.

1053
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,527
Are you facing trouble from
the Police nowadays ?

1054
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:26,858
Now why do the Police need me ?

1055
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,735
Now no one comes to disturb me.

1056
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:31,238
Hope they wouldallow
me to die here.

1057
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:33,433
l think they won't trouble you now.

1058
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:36,611
l heardthat there would be a War .

1059
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,245
You take care of yourself.

1060
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,214
God save us ...

1061
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:42,682
lt's fear in everyone's heart.

1062
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:50,424
Ooh it's kutan Nair ...

1063
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:52,193
You might have visited
on the way to your paddy field.

1064
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:55,560
No... l had come
to visit you purposely.

1065
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:01,469
Since you are here in the Country for long,
Why can't you own some more paddy fields.

1066
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,767
l'm wishingto buy some more fields.

1067
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:05,940
But what's the surety on my stay here.

1068
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,675
Everything would be alright.

1069
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,710
Who is he ?
- He is Rahimka ...

1070
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,647
He was with me in karachi.
- Now l'm settled in my native.

1071
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,816
Our Native place can't be replaced by
any other places on earth.

1072
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,647
Yes indeed ...

1073
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:25,823
l had come to inform you that
Our krishnan Nair got expired in Delhi.

1074
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:29,196
l haven't seen him for years.
Was he suffering from any disease.

1075
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,529
He had grown old ....
And he got settled there.

1076
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,935
He loved your family a lot.

1077
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:37,460
l can't forget the help done by him.

1078
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:39,670
Because of his help
l got financially well...

1079
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:45,279
We didn't knew what to do
when Britisher's sealed Father's property.

1080
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,943
krishnan Nair used to say all the time that
he gave the land considering your Father Ahmed .

1081
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,646
Son, shall l leave ...

1082
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:55,882
You continue with your chat.

1083
01:34:56,757 --> 01:34:59,393
l wish l could
reach there before noon.

1084
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:02,362
Allah, now how long
l have to wait for the Bus.

1085
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:05,499
Why are you hurrying so much to leave.

1086
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,126
l have to go.

1087
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:50,876
Moosa surunder yourself.

1088
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,859
Don't beat me ... !
l shall come along with you.

1089
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:06,494
Hey betrayer of nation ....
Go back to Pakistan.

1090
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:08,894
Where are you tryingto escape ?
- Walk along ...

1091
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,306
Are the all document's verified ?
- Yes ...

1092
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:22,810
You would attack the Police, lsn't it ?
Damodhar be cautious.

1093
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,368
Take him along with handcuff's.

1094
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:34,872
These Pakistani citizens triedto stay in the limits
of Manjeri Police station without any proper valid documents.

1095
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:38,983
They should be expelledfrom lndia immediately.

1096
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:44,986
lt is been decided that
they should be sent back to Pakistan.

1097
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,661
Do you have anything to say ?

1098
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:53,161
Please consider my condition.

1099
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:30,398
Rahimka don't get depressed.

1100
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:39,340
Will l get saved from this trouble ?

1101
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:44,008
Be patient ...
Don't worry.

1102
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:50,551
lsn't it Moosa ?

1103
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:52,485
l couldn't recognise you ...

1104
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:55,422
You had grown Old ...

1105
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:58,058
lt's been year's
you had gone from here.

1106
01:39:58,058 --> 01:40:01,261
Your fate is really miserable.
- lt's been many year's ...

1107
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:03,530
l was not able to return
even after trying for longtime.

1108
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,157
l usedto hear it from peoples.

1109
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,535
l rarely comes here...
Now l'm staying with my daughter in Tirur.

1110
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:11,827
l saw Ameena once ...

1111
01:40:12,606 --> 01:40:17,043
She hada hardtime.
Nothing is in our hand.

1112
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:20,848
You too have changed a lot.
How is Meenakshi amma ?

1113
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:23,112
She died ...

1114
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:26,786
And l'm remainingasa burden
on the Earth.

1115
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:31,250
You don't go anywhere ..
Stay along with your kids.

1116
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:34,194
l too have decided the same.

1117
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:36,997
Ahmed's Son won't go anywhere.

1118
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:39,199
Our native place have changeda lot.

1119
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,502
Now everyone is getting emigratedto Gulf.

1120
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:43,737
Malayalee's fate is to leave his
native place all the time.

1121
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:45,839
Shall l leave, l'm feeling tired.

1122
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:48,575
You move on..
l can't walk too fast.

1123
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:50,202
l shall come to your house after two days.

1124
01:40:56,717 --> 01:41:00,778
God...
Look at the fate of Ahmed's son.

1125
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:04,356
Law which doesn't allow's him to
reside in his own Motherland.

1126
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:06,950
Such a bad world ...

1127
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,665
l thought you won't return.

1128
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:16,893
And l know you are not a person who
would wait for too long.

1129
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:19,662
This time it got too late.

1130
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:23,410
lt got late because l decided not to
return after coming back.

1131
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:24,678
Do you have your Visa ?

1132
01:41:24,678 --> 01:41:27,014
l'm not having Visa nor my passport.

1133
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:28,849
l destroyed the passport.

1134
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,518
l decided whether l could return to
my Motherland without having both of them.

1135
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,247
That was bit dangerous.

1136
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,558
Anyways you are very courageous.

1137
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:40,152
What have you decided to do now.

1138
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,163
l had come to discussabout that.

1139
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,121
Please show me a way.

1140
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:47,230
Do you have any enemies here ?

1141
01:41:48,001 --> 01:41:48,865
No ...

1142
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:54,708
Then let's do one thing ....

1143
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,767
Limit your visit to outside.

1144
01:41:57,711 --> 01:41:59,804
Now l won't go back at any cost.

1145
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:03,517
l'm fed up and l am old now.

1146
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:06,714
Do what is necessary
l shall visit you sometimes.

1147
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:11,191
Anyways the Police is
not arresting you on your wish.

1148
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:13,594
Remain in hide-out'sas longas possible.

1149
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:15,762
Take care that no one betray's you.

1150
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:19,528
Andthe Police is of our state ...
They too are in need of money.

1151
01:42:20,267 --> 01:42:22,536
Our Native place had changeda lot.

1152
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:23,969
Yes it had changed.

1153
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,582
After that he didn't go anywhere.

1154
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:38,819
He lived hiding in his own Motherland.

1155
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:41,344
Atlast the court too favoured him.

1156
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:44,625
Didn't he hadany contact's with
karachi afterwards.

1157
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:47,261
He was having some business there.

1158
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:49,663
He had come after
selling the shop in karachi.

1159
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:54,902
Andafter that
l haven't even seen his Passport.

1160
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:58,005
The Passport is the cause of every problem.

1161
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:02,576
lf we wanna stay there then
we should bear the passport of that state.

1162
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:05,204
And it is even required
while coming to their own Motherland.

1163
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:12,674
While creatingthe passport
he too might have never thought of the trouble.

1164
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:24,154
What had happenedto Sahib ?
Aren't you taking care of him properly.

1165
01:43:25,132 --> 01:43:27,234
lt's due to her over caring nature.

1166
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:30,637
For 2-3 days l was not able
to sleep properly.

1167
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:33,629
He is getting worried
about unnecessary stuffs.

1168
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,510
Don't worry ...
The pressure is low ...

1169
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:37,943
You can get discharged by tomorrow.

1170
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:51,024
How far your article and
investigation had reached ?

1171
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:52,960
Are you feeling better ?

1172
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,019
Doctor said he isalright now.

1173
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:57,164
From where are you coming now ?

1174
01:43:57,164 --> 01:43:59,598
l came to visit you
when l heard that you are not well.

1175
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:03,270
You would be happy on next week
after the Summit get's over.

1176
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:05,670
lt would be benificary.

1177
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:07,702
We had seen these kinda Summit a lot

1178
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:20,946
Grandpa you are having fever.
- Ooh is it... Are you a Doctor ?

1179
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:28,028
We can consult you to
the Doctor after Uncle's arrival.

1180
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:30,764
Who told you that your Uncle is going to arrive ?

1181
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,633
Mother and Grandma told me so.

1182
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:35,102
They even told that their
would be a wedding here after hisarrival.

1183
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:37,037
Would you buy me new clothes, Grandpa ?

1184
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:43,272
Sure.. Wearing new clothes
you could go along with the Bride.

1185
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:47,914
We can send one more reminder to them.

1186
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:51,518
Anyways if anything is goingto happen
it would occur after the end of this new Summit.

1187
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:53,679
Usually it arrives by this time.

1188
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:56,818
The Police isawaiting for it.

1189
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:59,826
Body and mind both had got weakend.

1190
01:44:59,826 --> 01:45:03,430
lt's been 1 7 years
you are continuing your stay here.

1191
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:05,523
And 6 years without
getting into the sight of anyone.

1192
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:08,530
And rest year'salong with this permit.
You would get surely get the grant to stay here.

1193
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,006
Nowaday's the back stabbing is more.

1194
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:16,543
Back stabbing is not
good for the progress in Politics.

1195
01:45:16,543 --> 01:45:19,046
lt is been done by
those from the same party.

1196
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:22,649
Our Rahimka was too betrayed by this Politics.

1197
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,352
This is being done by those who had
helped in the Partition.

1198
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:28,116
The court session would begin now.

1199
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:50,911
lsn't your Visa is goingto get expired ?
You haven't shown your documents yet.

1200
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:55,215
lt would get ready ...
May be after this Summit .

1201
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:57,517
Anyways it shouldn't be a trouble for us.

1202
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,053
Rauf would come come to your house.

1203
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:04,191
Send me little more ....
Since the expenditure is high nowadays.

1204
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,658
Let me try.

1205
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,093
Hold it ...

1206
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:20,173
You go and play dear ....
- Ooh our Native place is so beautiful.

1207
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:22,342
You are saying it
because you have not stayed here before.

1208
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:25,212
The Police does come here to catch our Garndpa.

1209
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:26,680
We all get's scared ...

1210
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,881
Will they even catch us
if we stay here.

1211
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,283
The Police is catching our
Grandpa because he isa Pakistani.

1212
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:32,552
They would even catch us ....

1213
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:34,121
Since we are his Grand childrens.

1214
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:36,757
That's why Mom decidedto
take us to her house.

1215
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:38,725
Grandpa doesn't fear anything .

1216
01:46:38,725 --> 01:46:40,994
Those who had come
from Gulf are scared of everything.

1217
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:44,054
l would complain it to Grandpa ...
- You go and Complain, l don't care.....

1218
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:50,771
Grandpa they all are afraid
that they would get caught by the Police.

1219
01:46:50,771 --> 01:46:51,965
Go inside ...

1220
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:55,366
Dear you go inside.

1221
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:58,668
My opinion is that too
many peoples shouldn't be invited.

1222
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:04,251
That's your wish but must
provide a tasty meal for the guest's.

1223
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:07,220
We could organise the Henna Ceremony in the Hall .
- No ... We can carry out it in the house.

1224
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:11,050
l think it would be better if
we organise it in the house of my Wife.

1225
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,543
Where are you ?

1226
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:31,170
Where are you ?

1227
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:33,806
l'm right here ...

1228
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:42,856
What are you doingat this late night ?

1229
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:44,824
l got scared ...

1230
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,194
l wasn't able to sleep.

1231
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:56,665
Our kids had grown big ...
And had got really big ....

1232
01:47:57,237 --> 01:48:00,240
Then how would be able to sleep, lsn't it ?

1233
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:05,779
Leave it ...
There might be some problem .

1234
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,981
That's why he might have taken
a decision like that.

1235
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:12,680
l had raised him with so care and Love.
No he doesn't needanyone.

1236
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:18,692
He can't even spent a night with his parents.

1237
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:22,150
He is busy with the thought of
howto make the marriage Grand.

1238
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:28,063
lt may be because of that he had decidedto carry out
the Henna ceremony too in his Wife house.

1239
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:34,398
Will you attend the ceremony ?

1240
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:41,641
That ceremony is meant for Women and Childrens.

1241
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:45,318
The needfor people like me is
just in the wedding.

1242
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:49,516
l won't attenda
Henna Ceremony without you.

1243
01:49:35,001 --> 01:49:38,605
What is going to happen with all this ?
- You try for some other Job .

1244
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:42,142
lf l publish thisarticles may be
l would get a Job in their Newspaper.

1245
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:45,211
How long are you going
to run behind this problem ?

1246
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:48,203
You are not even getting proper sleep.

1247
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:55,622
The Police and Politicans would
come behind me if thisarticle get's published.

1248
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:57,487
You don't worry about that.

1249
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:11,671
All the preparation for tomorrow's Summit
between the lndo-Pak leader's had been done in Cochin

1250
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:19,079
Our Diplomatic Editor John Britas is Online
to enfurl us with more detailsabout this Summit.

1251
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:21,948
Britas what are the preparations
carried out for the Summit.

1252
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:26,620
Shahina the most beautiful city of South lndia (Cochin)
is grabing the attention world-wide.

1253
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:31,625
The Summit would begin on 11 o'clock
tomorrow at Le Meriden Hotel in Cochin.

1254
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:35,595
Within tonight the Pakistan leader
and his colleague would reach in Cochin.

1255
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:37,864
The most interestingfact ...

1256
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:40,166
'' Pakisthan President was born in lndia ''

1257
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:43,303
'' The same way lndian Prime Minister was born in Pakisthan
''

1258
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:49,376
The leader's world-wide are looking forward
how this fact is goingto influence the Summit.

1259
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:56,383
And one important thing is that terrorist group's
play a major role in both the Countries.

1260
01:50:56,383 --> 01:51:00,945
They too are observing this Summit minutely.

1261
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:08,228
The Summit which is goingto begin
on tomorrow is an epoch-making event.

1262
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:13,359
Andthere would be a debate over this
issue at 11 p.m on Malayalam T.V

1263
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:22,701
Hope it would be beneficial.

1264
01:51:23,643 --> 01:51:25,804
Everyone are claiming it to be benefical.

1265
01:51:31,117 --> 01:51:34,211
l won't come to see the
attitude of you and your Wife.

1266
01:51:34,554 --> 01:51:37,657
No one know's there Dad now.

1267
01:51:37,657 --> 01:51:40,490
This decision was bit harsh.

1268
01:51:41,394 --> 01:51:42,827
What are you saying ?

1269
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:45,597
lt's difficult to conduct it here.

1270
01:51:45,932 --> 01:51:47,367
And Dadtoo didn't opposed it.

1271
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:51,438
l don't agree to it.
Your Dad would bare anything.

1272
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:54,174
The Henna Ceremony could
be conducted even in our absence.

1273
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:58,311
Nadhira are you listening what our Mom is saying ?
Please make her understand .

1274
01:51:58,311 --> 01:52:02,111
l shall come but parent's must
decide whether they like to come or not.

1275
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:06,447
Everyone is trying to blame me.

1276
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:12,651
l haven't seen thisanywhere ...
lt's of how much grams ?

1277
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:17,023
lt'sa new fashion ..
lt was made on her wish.

1278
01:53:17,023 --> 01:53:18,992
She even designed it.

1279
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:20,527
lt would be around 64 grms.

1280
01:53:20,527 --> 01:53:23,291
lt's really beautiful ...
So it's how much Gram of Gold in total.

1281
01:53:23,696 --> 01:53:26,221

Since even you

1286
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:52,818

1287

Ok bye ....

1288
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:50,567
You go there ....
And you search the opposite side ...

1289
01:56:54,607 --> 01:56:56,336
There should be some one at the gate.

1290
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:00,945
you go and search there ..

1291
01:57:08,287 --> 01:57:09,879
Go and search those rooms ...

1292
01:57:13,926 --> 01:57:15,257
You go and search upstairs.

1293
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:44,791

1294
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:47,589
There is no one to be seen.
There is no one here.

01:57:48,594 --> 01:57:49,395
lt's not possible ....

1296
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:51,829
Yes you are right even the door hadn't be locked.
He might be somewhere here ....

1297
01:57:52,565 --> 01:57:55,898
That Old man is tryingto be youngagain.

Are you trying to get escape ?

1301
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,288
Rascal, are you trying to fool us.

1302
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:20,991
Please don't beat me.

1303
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:27,166
We had searched you at so many place's.
The Old man is trying trouble us !

1304
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:29,293
Walk along ....

1305
01:58:34,373 --> 01:58:35,499

Orelse we would take you along.

1307

What nonsense are you doing by comingto a house
where the Womens are stayingalone !

1313
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:07,799

1314
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:30,548
Stop there ...

You were trying to get escaped, lsn't it ?

1322
02:00:59,986 --> 02:01:04,047
Get into the Van ...
You are tryingto fool the Police for so many days.

1323
02:01:19,538 --> 02:01:23,440
Get down ..
l hadasked you to get down.

1324
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:28,781
These Son of Bitches have
the right to do anything !

1325
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:31,050
Wouldanyone go
call our Gandhi and Abdul Rehman.

1326
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:33,348
Do hell with your Gandhi and Abdul Rehman !

1327
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:43,491
Get lost ...

1328
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:52,972
You have beaten me up so many times !
Aren't you satisfied yet ?

1329
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:57,841
C'mon Beat me ... Beat me !

1330
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:34,547
Will you please postpone
this journey for two more days ?

1331
02:02:34,547 --> 02:02:36,649
We shall bringthe stay order at any cost !

1332
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:38,317
Within that time the Resident Permit
would be allotedto him.

1333
02:02:38,317 --> 02:02:39,485
We would loose our Job.

1334
