1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,542


3
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,292
There is no doubt in it

4
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,750
Is that why, being an MLA in
his district for almost 20 years,,,

5
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:00,958
instead of offering me, his son,
a seat in the upcoming election

6
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,125
the seat has been offered to a
servant's son, Arivudai Nambi?

7
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,708
Many a times our leader has mentioned
Arivudai Nambi as his next successor,

8
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,917
You tell me,

9
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,167
Dad played politics,

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,125
Nambi is from a different community,

11
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,250
Dad said it only to get votes
from his community as well,

12
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:19,875
That's not true,

13
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:24,417
Dad doesn't like you getting
into politics using his name,

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,167
That's why he agreed
upon Arivudai Nambi,

15
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,250
Please understand,

16
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:29,958
Ok,

17
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,958
Let's assume that's true,

18
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,583
But how do you think he would win in this
district where more people are from our community,

19
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,167
Right from the moment he got married
to the girl from our community

20
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,958
He belongs to our stature

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,167
The higher authorities believe we could win
votes from both the communities if he represents,

22
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,583
And that's what I believe

23
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,125
Don't get confused, Move on,

24
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,417
Tamizharasan

25
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,958
Does the name sound good?

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Beautiful name,

27
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,333
Should I send our guys and
inform Agalya's family?

28
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,167
That's unfair

29
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:18,333
I'll give them the news myself,

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,417
I don't think it's right,

31
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,958
It's not fair to ignore just
because her family is mad at us

32
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,667
This is the right
chance unite,

33
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,000
And that's what Agalya likes too

34
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,708
If you have decided
to go, don't go alone

35
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,792
Take few of our men along,

36
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,375
Why?

37
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,708
To create troubles?

38
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,375
Don't worry, Dad,

39
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,875
Thangapandi is there,,,

40
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,583
Let's seek his help

41
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,458
Okay, Nambi, Come,

42
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,833
Congratulations!

43
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,458
You have become an uncle now

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,042
Your sister, Agalya gave
birth to a baby boy

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,750
It was your
brother-in-law on line

46
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,042
When I don't consider her
my sister anymore,,,

47
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,292
there is no room for any
relationship with that fellow!

48
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,167
Your dad hanged himself because he couldn't bear
the humiliation when Agalya eloped with Nambi

49
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,750
But she doesn't seem to
have any concern at all!

50
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,833
She is happy with
him and her son,

51
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,708
You are ignorant about all this

52
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,250
How could you be so?

53
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,208
I would have murdered
them both when she eloped

54
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,167
Your dad stopped me

55
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,458
I couldn't ignore his orders,

56
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,583
That is why he is still alive,

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,333
But a day will surely come
when I'll finish him off!

58
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,917
It's been six months
since my dad passed away

59
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,333
I am not like him,

60
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,000
Nambi is coming to
your home tomorrow,

61
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,958
If still you remain silent,,,

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,667
then people will laugh at you,

63
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:13,250
For your family's humiliation

64
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:18,083
And for your dad's death, if you
really wanna take revenge

65
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,458
Then do as I say

66
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,833
I will support you

67
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,333
After all those humiliations

68
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,000
How dare you step in!

69
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:30,667
Leave me

70
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,000
Only if I kill him, my dad's
soul will rest in peace

71
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,708
Are you messing with me
because have I come alone?

72
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:42,125
Don't you realise how bold I
am, confronting you alone?

73
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,667
Dare you touch me!

74
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,125
Before you trash me down, your
wife will become a widow,

75
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,083
Look,,,

76
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,875
If I let him go now

77
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,042
He would assume we are cowards

78
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,042
Dare you!

79
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,500
Dare you touch me!

80
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,125
Come on!

81
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:57,542
Nambi,

82
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,458
Calm down, Let me talk

83
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,667
Kadhir, are you trying to turn your family
issue into village people's issue?

84
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,667
A family issue?

85
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,042
He cheats and runs away with my sister

86
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,667
Should I remain silent?

87
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,750
No man will dare to do the
same if I kill him now

88
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:13,833
Wait

89
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,333
Listen to me

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,917
Arivudainambi is one of our
party's MLA candidate

91
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,250
Moreover, he is my close friend

92
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,042
I won't be silent if
you create problems,

93
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,750
If you truly respect my father then
you should let go of this issue

94
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:30,667
That will be better
for all of us,

95
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,542
Leave now if you
respect my words

96
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,625
Get in,

97
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,125
You are responsible
for my dad's death

98
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,292
Please don't make this a big issue,
Leave,

99
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,750
Please leave,

100
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,833
Please leave,

101
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:49,750
Nambi,

102
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,458
I will let the authorities
convince your wife's family,

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,083
Please calm down until then,

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,417
Thank you, Pandi

105
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,917
Let me leave

106
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,667
Ok!

107
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,125
You have come all the way, will
you not pay a visit to my home?

108
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,458
You have forgotten us
ever since dad left,

109
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,583
It isn't so

110
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,042
I will have to inform
all the relatives

111
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,833
Only if I leave now, I will
be able to return soon

112
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,333
I will come some other day

113
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,167
Let me leave, Pandi,

114
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:35,917
What happened?

115
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,875
I don't know

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,292
I have been trying to fix
it, but it isn't starting,

117
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,333
Move, Let me check,

118
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,417
I have been trying
to control for long,

119
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,458
You please check,
I will be back,

120
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,917
You crook!

121
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:08,708
What the hell!

122
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,167
Come on!

123
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:09,667
Why?

124
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,042
Come on!

125
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,250
Listen to me

126
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,583
Let's,,,

127
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:14,833
Thangapandi,,,

128
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,792
Thangapandi,,,Look,,,

129
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,708
No,,

130
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,292
Die!

131
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,667
Pandi!

132
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,042
Thangapandi,,,

133
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,542
No, I beg you,

134
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,542
Stop!

135
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,458
Check if he is breathing,

136
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:38,250
Title: Yaman
( The god of death)

137
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:06,375
Sky is the limit; let
not the pain stop you,

138
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,750
Reach the sky and your mortal
enemy will be finished forever,

139
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:13,625
Don't be afraid of the thorns on
your path; crush them and proceed,

140
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,750
The lord is with you,
Keep advancing!

141
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:20,000
Life is a war

142
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:23,583
and you must wage the battle,

143
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:27,292
Be alert and be cautious,

144
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,000
So be prepared to battle the
monsters disguised as humans,

145
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,750
Deception and frauds are all that is
left; break the silence and crush them,

146
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,167
If you ever find
injustice, destroy it

147
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:13,958
Be aggressive like a fire and go past
the boundaries; walk like the Yaman,

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,167
If you ever find an
enemy, rip him off

149
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,458
Take a step back and,,,

150
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:24,333
you'll be attacked,

151
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,750
So keep progressing,

152
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:33,458
So be prepared to battle the
monsters disguised as humans,

153
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,333
We've been meeting celebrities
every week in our show,

154
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,542
Today in our 'Star of the week'
show, we are going to meet

155
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:56,292
the bubbly star actress in
Kollywood, Anjana is here with us,

156
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:56,833
Hello!

157
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,333
Hello!

158
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,458
If doctor says to get operated, refuse,

159
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,500
Are you worried about money?

160
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,667
Don't worry, I will
take care of it,

161
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,083
I have a concern,

162
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,958
Once I fix your marriage
and get done with it,,,

163
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,167
I will rest in peace

164
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,250
Get me fixed with that girl

165
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,958
I'll get married tomorrow,

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,208
I can't say that,,,

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,958
Tamizharasan

168
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,000
Let the patient be seated,
Doctor called you,

169
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
You please sit down,
Let me meet him,

170
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,500
According to Biopsy report

171
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,000
The cyst in his stomach
confirms it to be cancer

172
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,833
It is better to remove it soon,

173
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,958
How much would it cost
for an operation?

174
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,250
If we get it done here,
then it will be over soon

175
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,583
He can get discharged soon,

176
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,667
Government hospitals
don't charge,

177
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,292
But they only treat
considering the priority,

178
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,625
It might get delayed,

179
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,083
I will meet you as soon
as I arrange money

180
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:01,833
Okay,

181
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,958
Let's get it done here,

182
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:04,792
Brother,,,

183
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,917
There is Rs, 19,745

184
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,583
I asked money for
grandpa's operation?

185
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,167
5,000 or 10,000 is fine,

186
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,250
0,3 million is a huge money

187
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,500
I have asked everywhere,
Couldn't afford,

188
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:27,333
If you could help me,
I will return the money,

189
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,917
How will you?

190
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,583
You are a good man,

191
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,125
I don't doubt it,

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,208
That's why I didn't even
count the money you gave,

193
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,250
It will take 8 or 9 years
to return that lot of money

194
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:48,750
I am a trader,

195
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,458
Not a financial leaser,

196
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,542
I can't wait that long,

197
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,875
Please don't get me wrong, Understand,

198
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,750
I called you,

199
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,417
Please check,

200
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,750
That's okay,

201
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,625
Shake hands

202
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,792
Hello, sir,

203
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,417
One minute

204
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
- Let me take this call
- Okay, sir

205
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,917
Have you left already?

206
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,708
How can you refuse
in the last minute?

207
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,000
Look,,,

208
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,458
I shall offer you 0,4 million,

209
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,500
It's an accident case,

210
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,375
They will get you out in two days,

211
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,458
One minute,

212
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,958
Hello,,,

213
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,292
Any problem?

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,083
A guy, who is supposed to
go abroad in a week,,,

215
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:20,458
Got drunk with his friends, drove
the car and met with an accident,

216
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:27,125
His dad is willing to offer money if
anyone agrees to surrender on his behalf,

217
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,708
I arranged a guy

218
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,625
But he backed down in
the last minute,

219
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,250
I am ready to do this if I get money,

220
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,375
Have you ever been to jail?

221
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,125
No

222
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,375
A life is in danger

223
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,125
If he dies then the case might turn ugly,

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,417
This job involves risks and you
will have to go to jail often,

225
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,292
Get it?

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,583
Ask for 0,5 million, I
will offer you Rs,50,000,

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you are okay with the deal

228
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,583
Convince them

229
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,833
Let me order tea

230
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,458
Was that an unexpected accident?

231
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Or did you get money from someone?

232
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,250
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,708
Selvam, the victim was
once my business partner

234
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,292
He cheated and robbed all my money,

235
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,875
I planned to finish him off

236
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,250
But that did not work out,

237
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,250
He has got support
from local ministers,

238
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,375
I thought my life could be in danger

239
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,583
So I got in,

240
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:55,000
He seems to be Manimaran's goon,

241
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,042
They are talking now

242
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,292
I got drunk and drove the car,
And so the accident happened,

243
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,625
It isn't what you think,

244
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,625
Look,,,

245
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,167
You may find it simple,

246
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,667
But Selva isn't like that

247
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,375
Better be careful

248
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,125
Do you recognize me?

249
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:25,792
No

250
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,708
It looks like he was hardly
able to see me in the dark

251
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:35,292
The one you tried to
finish off, Selvarathnam,

252
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,958
I have got nothing to
do with the accident,

253
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,500
I needed money

254
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,667
That's when the accident happened,

255
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,333
They agreed to offer me
money if I surrender

256
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:53,750
That's why I agreed,

257
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,583
So you know who did it

258
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know,

259
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I asked someone for money
and he told me about this,

260
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,833
How are you related
to Manimaran?

261
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,833
I don't know anyone by that name

262
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:10,875
Okay,

263
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You said you agreed for money, right?

264
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,458
I shall give you money

265
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,667
The one who was talking with you

266
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,375
He is Manimaran

267
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,125
Kill him,

268
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,917
I will see to that you won't
have any further problems,

269
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,333
Is that fine?

270
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,292
No,

271
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,167
I know you wouldn't

272
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,500
Tell me now

273
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,792
How much did you get from Manimaran?

274
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,625
I don't know what issues do
you have with other people

275
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,750
But I am being punished
for doing nothing

276
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,042
That means

277
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,000
I have got rights to do anything wrong,

278
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Do you understand?

279
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,917
I'll give you 2 minutes,

280
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,292
Apologize and leave,

281
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,167
If not,,,

282
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,542
You will regret forever for meeting me

283
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,625
Hold him,,,

284
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,625
Let me show you who will regret

285
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,958
Look,,,If you don't agree to do this

286
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,333
I will finish you as well,

287
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:30,625
Sir,,,

288
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,292
Get it?

289
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,500
What are you doing?

290
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,750
Sir, Leave,

291
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,708
What are you doing?

292
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,500
Leave,

293
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,167
Leave,

294
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:37,958
Please come,

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,667
I let you in only because
Minister told me to do so

296
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,292
What are you doing?

297
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,167
Stay out for 5 minutes,

298
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,208
I would like to ask him something

299
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,208
We will not harm him,

300
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:50,083
Please wait outside for 5 minutes,

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,125
I will give you 2 minutes, Ask him
whatever you want to and let him out,

302
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,875
Let me have this until then

303
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,125
If you want to hit him

304
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,542
Make sure there are no bruises,

305
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,333
Open the door,

306
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,500
What are you doing?

307
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,917
What are you doing?

308
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,083
Open the door,

309
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,000
Open the door,

310
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,583
Open the door,

311
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,083
Open the door,

312
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,667
If you open the door

313
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,708
I will finish him off now,

314
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,083
Threaten someone else

315
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,458
Tamizh,,,

316
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,625
Over here

317
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,583
Sir,,,A minute please

318
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,042
How are you?

319
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,458
Fine, Is the operation over?

320
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,250
How is grandpa?

321
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,583
Operation is successfully over

322
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,708
Doctors have advised to stay
in the hospital for a while

323
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,083
Thank you!

324
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:01,875
Was the money sufficient?

325
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,167
Not a problem,

326
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,875
The driver passed away,

327
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,333
You don't worry,
I spoke to the lawyer,

328
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,833
I will definitely get you out,

329
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,583
I heard Selva threatened you,

330
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,958
You did not tell me,

331
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,708
He asked me if I was your goon,

332
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,250
I denied and he left,

333
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,167
Is that so?

334
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,875
Nothing happened?

335
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,708
No,

336
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,167
Selva is admitted in the hospital,

337
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:57,833
Do you know?

338
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,583
Look,,,

339
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,833
I know him very well,

340
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,250
He will definitely finish you off,

341
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
How about joining me?

342
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,792
I will save you,

343
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,500
If I stay here any longer,
my life would be in danger,

344
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,583
I am going out,

345
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,375
I will help you get out
if you agree to join me,

346
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:42,792
What do you think?

347
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:27,375
Damelu,,,, Dumelu,,,,

Take a chance

351
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,125
Like the drifting air

352
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,333
Fly high

353
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,417
There is no limit

354
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:53,375

If the mind finds peace,,,

Your life will remain peaceful

359
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,208
When you forget your pain

360
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,708
Everything looks beautiful

361
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,500
There is no room for pain here

362
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,167
Spread love,
Win hearts

363
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,958
Stay worry free and
move ahead with courage

364
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,750
Life isn't complex as you think

365
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:21,958
Damelu,,,, Dumelu,,,,

366
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:36,542
Damelu,,,, Dumelu,,,,

367
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,958
Trust friendship

368
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,625
There is none without friends

369
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,208
No matter who it is,,,

370
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,292
there are no rules in friendship

371
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:26,917
Spread love, Your life
will be beautiful

372
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,667
Even mistakes will turn
out to be admirable,

373
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:34,542
Enjoy life kingsize

374
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:38,250
Life happens only once

375
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:45,750
Damelu,,,, Dumelu,,,,

376
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:51,500
Damelu,,,, Dumelu,,,,

377
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,667
Enjoy,,, Palimelo,,,

378
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,375
When you are young

379
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:01,167
Take a chance

380
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,500
Like the drifting air

381
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,125
Fly high

382
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:12,042
There is no limit

383
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:15,250
The ball is in your court,

384
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,125
Selvarathinam and Manimaran,,,

385
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:28,083
All I remember is the two talented friends
with whom I worked ten years ago,

386
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:31,208
But now I hear,,,

387
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:34,917
there is a rivalry as to who
is going to kill whom first,

388
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,958
Police seized my stuff

389
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,458
After the case got over, all the
stuff that court said to clear,,,

390
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,958
was brought by Selvam at a
lesser price from the police

391
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,167
Only when I inquired

392
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,083
I got to know that he
ratted me out,

393
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:53,167
The stuff is worth 80 million,

394
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,417
This is what happened

395
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,875
Few days back

396
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:04,292
A police whom I
know very well,,,

397
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,750
told me that there is stuff
that court has ordered to clear

398
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,542
He asked me if I
was willing to buy

399
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,917
I brought it because it was cheaper,

400
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:21,333
I did not know it was his stuff,

401
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,875
Now that you know it is his stuff,,,

402
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,250
give him the money

403
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:30,500
Chief,,

404
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,333
Don't mistake me,

405
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,125
When there is loss in this business,,

406
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:41,125
remember you told me that
there is no recovery,

407
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,417
This is business

408
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,958
So, I can't do anything about it,

409
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,625
Chief,,,

410
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,042
I came here only
because you called me,

411
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:50,750
Let me leave,

412
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,667
Chief,,,

413
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,458
I will return him the money
if he agrees for a deal

414
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,958
Tamizharasan must die

415
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:11,917
If you agree to this, not just the
stuff, but let's forget all the rivalry

416
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:13,417
What do you think?

417
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,958
Who is Tamizharasan?

418
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,333
I got to know him
when I was in jail,

419
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,667
I don't understand why do you have
to bring him in to this matter

420
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,250
He got drunk and drove the car

421
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,667
Who told you he drove the car

422
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:31,958
He told me so

423
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,958
Do you know what he told me?

424
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,083
He said he has got nothing
to do with the accident

425
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,833
and that he works for money,

426
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,667
He said, " They said they would
give me money if I drive the car,,,"

427
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,042
"And I agreed to come"

428
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,083
Let me tell you something

429
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:53,583
The other day when I
met him in the jail

430
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,250
He agreed to finish you off

431
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,375
But I did not accept because
he demanded too much,

432
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,000
If I had agreed

433
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,750
You wouldn’t be here

434
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,208
Moreover,,,

435
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,667
He messed with me

436
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,667
He must die,

437
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,333
From what I hear

438
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,208
I don't think the
guy is trustworthy,

439
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:26,708
To have such guys around is like hanging
out with Yaman - the god of death,

440
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:30,042
I believe his deal makes sense,

441
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,833
It is wise to accept it,

442
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,250
Okay,

443
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,292
I will inquire,

444
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,667
If I get to know that he had
lied, I will finish him off,

445
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:48,958
Hello!

446
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,250
Tell me

447
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,250
Where are you?

448
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,750
I have been trying to
call you for a long time

449
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,667
Manimaran called me,

450
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,958
When I was in jail I told him I
was responsible for the accident

451
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,750
He was asking about it

452
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,917
That's why I got delayed,

453
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:02,875
What's the matter?

454
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,750
Hello,,,Hello,

455
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,833
Who are you? What do you want?

456
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,750
I came here to meet him,

457
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,500
To meet him?

458
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,292
Please get in,

459
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:30,792
Come in,

460
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:31,667
Who is it?

461
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:35,917
Bindi hidden beneath Parda

462
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,333
Who is she?

463
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,542
Why are you smiling?

464
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,250
Please be seated,

465
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,125
I came here to apologize,

466
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,375
Were you driving
the car yesterday?

467
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,458
That's what I thought,

468
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,750
Your apology sounds too formal!

469
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,042
You broke his legs,

470
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,625
We are not Godfathers
to forgive you,

471
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,208
Brother,,,

472
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,542
Please keep quiet,

473
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,375
There is no point
in asking sorry

474
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,458
We have already registered
a complaint with the police,

475
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,750
Please speak to them

476
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:23,208
Please, sir,

477
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,500
I don't have license,

478
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,042
If you go to the police,
it will become an issue,

479
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,042
Don't you have that?

480
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,042
You are done for!

481
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,333
Please, Don't cry,

482
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,417
She did not run away
after you were hurt

483
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,667
She called the ambulance
and admitted you here,

484
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,958
She did not sleep all night,

485
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,125
Even I watched a night-show movie and
did not sleep, Is that important?

486
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,458
You've admitted him here,

487
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,333
Who will take care of
the medical expenses?

488
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,333
Please be quiet,

489
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,625
Please don't cry,

490
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,292
Here 0,1 million,

491
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,958
I will pay the medical bills,

492
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,875
Why do you have to?

493
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,542
Okay, He will not be able
to go for work for a while,

494
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,375
We will be able to manage with this money,

495
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,750
But his bike is damaged

496
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,417
When will you cover
those expenses?

497
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:08,958
Get out,

498
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,708
Did you say that to me?

499
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,083
Yes, You, Get out,

500
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:18,875
You are telling me to get out
just because the girl cried

501
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,000
I will leave,

502
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,833
If you were hurt somewhere else

503
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,792
Everything would have been over,

504
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,083
Don't dig in

505
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,333
You might fall,

506
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:35,750
Brother,,,

507
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,875
She's been searching for a long time,

508
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:41,833
Fruits?

509
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,917
She is such a good actor,

510
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,292
Don't forget the fruits,

511
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,208
Please don't mind
whatever he said,

512
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Getting me admitted
here was a huge favor

513
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,292
I did not go to the police,

514
00:36:59,208 --> 00:36:59,792
Thanks,

515
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,667
Please take it,

516
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,500
I am fine,

517
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,542
Let me pay the medical bills,

518
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,083
Please take it,

519
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:14,833
Please,

520
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,333
Please,

521
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:21,667
Thanks,

522
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:26,375
I don't know your name so I did
not write it on the cheque,

523
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,625
Tamizharasan,

524
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,792
My name is Agalya,

525
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,333
I am known as Anjana
in the cine world,

526
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,500
I am feeling much better now,

527
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:38,833
Let me leave,

528
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,958
Take care,

529
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,917
Next time make sure to get
your license before driving,

530
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,125
Definitely,

531
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:47,583
Thank you,

532
00:37:59,083 --> 00:37:59,917
What's happening?

533
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,583
I am talking over here,

534
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,875
Why are you honking?

535
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,625
I will leave if you give way,

536
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,625
Then wait,

537
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,583
We will get down here,

538
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,333
Who is he?

539
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,458
He is the area councilor,

540
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,125
Please disperse,

541
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:15,917
Leave,

542
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,667
What's happening?

543
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:18,833
Water problem,

544
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,125
It's been going on
for a long time,

545
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,458
I have informed,

546
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:24,792
Hello!

547
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,167
Instead of inquiring about me

548
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,042
Just listen carefully,

549
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,500
Manimaran is in
terms with Selva,

550
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:36,208
And it was at the
cost of your life,

551
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,458
Manimaran will call you tomorrow,

552
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:43,917
If you go, you will
not return alive,

553
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,042
If you trust me then call
me back at this number,

554
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,250
I will save you from them,

555
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,250
Thank you, sir,

556
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:00,875
He hung up after thanking me,

557
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,792
Didn't I tell you?

558
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,042
He is different,

559
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,292
Once we are done with this game, let's
finish him off, What do you say?

560
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,792
There are many boats around,

561
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,458
Let's wait for some more time,

562
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,125
Chief,,,

563
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,750
looks like all the boats
are following us,

564
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,708
Who are those men?
They look new here,

565
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,083
Obey me and,,,

566
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:01,833
you can go back home alive,

567
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,292
So tell me, Is it done?

568
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,833
Yes, It's done,

569
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,125
You sound too normal,

570
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,750
Was it that easy
to finish him off?

571
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,458
Indeed chief,

572
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:27,083
Fine, you head to Selva's car
shed by his gas station,

573
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,958
Our car is ready,

574
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,000
Take it and come to the club,

575
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:32,458
- Sounds good?
- OK chief,

576
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:33,792
Also,,,

577
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,917
you will find a bag in the car trunk,

578
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,667
Ensure it's safe, OK,

579
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,250
OK chief,

580
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,042
Tamizharasan isn't that genuine,

581
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:48,625
Selva was right,

582
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,833
And that is why I
finished him off,

583
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,292
As per Selva's order,
the money too is here,

584
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,167
OK,

585
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,958
Fine, OK,

586
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,042
Did you get the bag?

587
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,958
I agree it's a mistake,

588
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:34,750
Forgive me, Tamizh,

589
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,375
There is lot of money in that bag,

590
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,458
You may have it all,

591
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,083
Please let me go Tamizh,

592
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:45,833
I'll think about it,

593
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,583
Now quiet,

594
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,542
Well, I gave it a good thought,

595
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:12,125
I realized that I ain't good enough to let
go off those who wanted to finish me off,

596
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,208
Now since you offered
the money,,,

597
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,375
Among you two,,,

598
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:21,833
I'm ready to spare one,

599
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,542
Now you guys decide
who it should be,

600
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,250
I shall give half of my
wealth to your wife and kids,

601
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,958
Please save me, Ezhumalai,

602
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,667
I can take care of my family,

603
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,208
Why should I die
for your mistakes?

604
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,750
Tamizh, you promised to
spare me if I obeyed you,

605
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:49,458
I'm still saying the same,

606
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:51,667
Five minutes,,,

607
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,917
and I shall spare
just one on of you,

608
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,708
Or else,,,

609
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,917
I'll finish you off both,

610
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,667
How do I release this lock?

611
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:34,583
Pull the top lever back and
push the right lever front,

612
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:36,042
Thanks,

613
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,625
Now wind up the glass,

614
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,333
Smuggling, exchange of goods,,,

615
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,500
settling disputes,,,

616
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,375
that is all the business I used to do,

617
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,375
Manimaran, Selva and
my brother Kumar,,,

618
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,583
worked for me,

619
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:07,417
I decided to jump into politics,

620
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:11,292
At that time there was a huge amount of
Uranium in our store room in the out skirts,

621
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:15,375
We received a task of loading all
those Uranium into a foreign ship,

622
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:21,375
With the confidence on Mani and Selva,
I asked my brother to take it up,

623
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,958
Unfortunately, the stuff was
caught by the police that day,

624
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:31,250
The owner of the stuff in Bombay, set men
and finished off my brother in the prison,

625
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:36,542
But with the envy that I taught my
brother all the tricks of the trade,,,

626
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:43,125
it was Selva and Mani who
had informed the police,

627
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,500
I came to know about
it very recently,

628
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,667
Also, it wasn't the owner of the stuff
who ordered to finish my brother,

629
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,667
It was them who finished off
my brother inside the prison,

630
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:57,500
Which is why I decided to play their
own game with them and finish them,

631
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,625
I made sure Mani's stuff
was caught by the police,

632
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:05,250
Then I secretly sold it to Selva for a cheaper
rate and created a rift between them,

633
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:09,458
You accidentally became a part of my game,

634
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:13,958
Thanks a lot sir,

635
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,417
Where are you off to?

636
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,083
I just came here to thank you,

637
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,417
Selva is still alive,

638
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:22,542
Thamizh,,,

639
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,500
now understand this clearly,

640
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:31,125
Knowingly or unknowingly you've
become a part of my game,

641
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,292
As a result Manimaran is no more,

642
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,500
Whether you like it or not,,,

643
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,667
you must continue to play this game,

644
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,333
Or you could lose your life,

645
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,167
Are you threatening me?

646
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,333
I am speaking the truth,

647
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:48,958
If I had even thought once to
save your life the other day,,,

648
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,125
you wouldn't be alive today,

649
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,583
You should have understood things when
I revealed everything about me to you,

650
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,125
I see you as my friend,

651
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:03,542
Which is why I warned you then and it for
the same reason I'm warning you now,

652
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:04,417
sit down,,

653
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,083
I want to see the end of Selva,

654
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,375
Selva wants to see the end of you,

655
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,417
So as enemy's enemy is a friend, Hence,,,

656
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:23,417
I'll help you to finish off Selva,

657
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,958
You saved my life,

658
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:30,792
I owe you for that,

659
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,083
But not my murdering anyone,

660
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,583
Even if I forgive Selva

661
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,042
he won't rest until he finishes you off,

662
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,750
So go save yourself like you did now,

663
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,083
That is all I want,

664
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:52,542
What will you give me if I do so?

665
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,500
Whatever it is I'll do it
even before you do the task,

666
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:04,375
I shall lease you the government
liquor shop in your locality,,,

667
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,042
I shall make you it's owner!

668
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,042
Go meet this person
I'll tell you about,,,

669
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,625
everything will done right away,

670
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,917
Hello, this is Anjana here,

671
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:20,125
- Tell me Agalya, How are you?
- I'm fine,

672
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,917
I'm sorry, I couldn’t visit the hospital
as I was stuck in continuous shoot,

673
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:24,542
It's OK,

674
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,542
They discharged me in two days,

675
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,208
Also,

676
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,917
I didn't deposit the
cheque you gave me,

677
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,500
They told me that you had
paid the hospital bills,

678
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:34,125
So,,,

679
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:38,458
I thought it would help you buy a new
bike and that is why I paid the bills,

680
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,208
Go ahead and deposit the cheque,

681
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,875
The hospital bill wasn’t too
costly as you might think,

682
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,167
Don't mind Govinda's words,

683
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:46,750
No problem,

684
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:50,167
Let it be a compensation for your
loss for which I am responsible,

685
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:51,792
Then do me a favor,

686
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,208
I don't want money,

687
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,417
Take me out for a good meal,

688
00:48:58,292 --> 00:48:59,958
He is asking me out for dinner,

689
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,667
- Nope, Don't accept,
- Hello?

690
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,375
Agalya? Hello?

691
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,833
Your silence tells me
that you are intimidated,

692
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,292
No problem, Forget it,

693
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,542
Well, nothing like that,

694
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:13,500
I'm in a shoot and so,,,

695
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,083
Fine, We'll go,

696
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:20,042
So you decide and let me
know the time and place,

697
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,083
OK,

698
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:21,958
Bye,

699
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:22,958
Bye,

700
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:49,583
Sir,

701
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,292
It's me Tamizharasan,

702
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:56,000
I hope ex MLA Karunakaran
might have told you about me,

703
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:56,958
Sir!

704
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,833
Thamizh, Over there,

705
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:07,833
Greetings,

706
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,167
Greetings,

707
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,167
I am Thiyagarajan,

708
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,292
Minister's PA,

709
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,167
Please don't mind whatever
happened the other day,

710
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:15,958
Please forgive me,

711
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,667
Come on, I've already
forgot about it,

712
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,792
Happy to hear, Please come,

713
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,250
The minute Karunakaran spoke about
leasing you the liquor shop,,,

714
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,458
the minister agreed to it,

715
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,833
- OK sir,
- Kindly wait,

716
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:33,542
OK sir,

717
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:37,792
Right now all the utensils,textile and jewellery
businessmen are in a meeting with the minister,

718
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,667
They are talking about some
donations for the party,

719
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,917
I'll call you in as
soon as they leave,

720
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:44,208
Sir a small doubt,

721
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,417
Are you willing to make donation?

722
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,167
I hope you won't
mistake me if I ask,

723
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,875
Of course I'll mistake you if you ask,

724
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:50,792
Don't ask us because we
never give we only take,

725
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,000
- Not that
- Then?

726
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:57,208
In the last election Karunakaran
lost to your minister,

727
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:57,792
Indeed,

728
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,667
Then how is that your
minister obeys his orders?

729
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,167
Well all this is quite normal in politics,

730
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,667
Sir, when the election arrives,,,

731
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:07,917
they step up on the Dias
and abuse each other,

732
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,708
That too is a kind of
understanding between them,

733
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,125
If they cross each other's
path, they'll hug each other,

734
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,167
If you ask about it,,,

735
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,000
they'll say that "We are
enemies by motto,,,"

736
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,667
" but otherwise we are
friends" and that's it,

737
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,375
When there is a new
government in the future,,,

738
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,583
they repay the favors exactly
the way they got the favors,

739
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,792
So that means the people who trust them
and vote for them are the real fools,

740
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,542
Let me correct that for you,

741
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,625
Even the people are involved
in politics, Isn't it?

742
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:34,125
Think about it for a moment,

743
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:38,167
When the ruling and the opposition
parties abuse each other at times and,,,

744
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:42,250
play friends at other times,
will the people like it?

745
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,833
They won't right?

746
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:47,458
They'll kick out both the parties in the
next election and call them traitors,

747
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,292
No one is a fool here,

748
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:51,667
Please wait,

749
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,042
Come on,

750
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,625
Well that guy did have a point,

751
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,625
But what ever he said initially,,,

752
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:02,708
sounds confusing,

753
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,750
Do you what is the basic
rule of all the politicians?

754
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,958
It is to promise the people to do good, then loot
the rich and get the votes from the downtrodden,

755
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,500
And solely getting benefited,

756
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,042
They get donations for the
party from the rich,,,

757
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,792
then how do you expect them
to help the downtrodden?

758
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,875
That's quite the fact,

759
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,083
OK, OK,

760
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,542
Fine,

761
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,208
Come in Tamizh,

762
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,375
You go meet him Tamizh, I'll wait here,

763
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,208
OK, I'll be back,

764
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:32,833
Please come,

765
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:19,042
Remember Karunakaran spoke
to you about leasing the bar,,,

766
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,000
Tamizharasan,

767
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:23,958
Have a seat,

768
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,708
Thank you sir,

769
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:38,500
Now stop staring at my
face and switch on the AC,

770
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,417
The AC is already switched on,

771
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,917
You look very familiar,

772
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,125
Where are you from?

773
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:52,958
Tirunelveli,

774
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:55,583
Your dad's name?

775
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,208
Arivudai Nambi,

776
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,292
I hope you didn't expect that I'll
make a come back, Isn't it Pandi?

777
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:18,792
Are you Nambi's son?

778
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,458
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

779
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,667
This here is my
close friend's son,

780
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,833
Back then, your dad was the
councilor in the party,

781
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,208
If he were alive today, he would
have been in good position,

782
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:38,625
Tell me Nambi, How can I help you?

783
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,042
Chief, not Nambi,,,

784
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:41,792
Tamizharasan,

785
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,500
I see Nambi in him,

786
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,792
That is why I addressed
him as Nambi,

787
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:50,625
Tell me dear,

788
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,833
How can I help you?

789
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:56,083
Help me to take over the local government
liquor shop and bar for lease,

790
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,208
Instead of that bar, I shall get
you the one behind the Central,

791
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,917
You can earn more there,

792
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:11,833
Thank you sir,

793
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,125
Chief, that bar,,,

794
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,167
was already requested for councilor
Anbuazhagan's brother in law,

795
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,333
You too promised him,

796
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,417
You are a big pain in the head!

797
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,250
I very well know what
to do and for whom,

798
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,000
You just obey my orders,

799
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,583
Just as a formality,,,

800
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:33,333
fill up the bar tender application and
submit it at the corporation office,

801
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,042
I'll take care of the rest,

802
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:37,958
Thank you sir,

803
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:41,375
Anytime, feel free
to ask me any help,

804
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,375
He is one of us, We
must take care of him,

805
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:44,958
OK chief,

806
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:46,292
What else?

807
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:48,208
That would be all,

808
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:51,333
Lot of other party
members are waiting,

809
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,917
Or else I would like to
spend more time with you,

810
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,250
- Thank you very much sir,
- OK dear,

811
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:56,833
See you,

812
00:55:57,917 --> 00:55:58,458
See you,

813
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,333
OK, Fine,

814
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:13,000
Chief, I forgot to tell
you something important,

815
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:13,958
Well,,,

816
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,458
thankfully Tamizharasan is one of us,

817
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,292
Selva, who is unaware of this
fact wants to finish him off,

818
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,458
Come to the point,

819
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,250
Didn't I tell you a
guy thrashed Selva,

820
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,083
It was Tamizharasan,

821
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:40,667
It was his thrashing that gifted
Selva with a collar belt for life,

822
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:45,542
And that is why Selva wants
to finish of Tamizh,

823
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,458
Nothing to worry chief,

824
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:51,792
I'll talk to Selva and let him
know that Tamizh is one of us,

825
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,208
You better shut up!

826
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,458
Just obey my orders,

827
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:56,958
Call up Selva,

828
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,625
Well,,,OK,

829
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:09,083
What's the link between
Karunakaran and Tamizharasan?

830
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,042
I don't know chief,

831
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,917
Selva's phone line is busy,

832
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:28,333
When you meet your Karunakaran,
just inquire about Tamizharasan,

833
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:32,667
I stopped meeting him after
you ordered me not to,

834
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,542
Karunakaran hasn't sent
Tamizharasan here for nothing,

835
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,875
I'm sure there is something
huge behind this,

836
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:43,667
Look here,,,

837
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:50,167
I've made you my PA even after knowing that you
are from Karunakaran's native and his community,

838
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:53,917
I warn you again,

839
00:57:55,167 --> 00:58:01,500
If I ever find out that whatever I
do and speak here reaches Karuna,,,,

840
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,667
then that will be you end,

841
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:07,583
What?

842
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,667
It's Selva,

843
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,958
Greeting chief, Tell me,

844
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,625
A guy has busted you up,,,

845
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,958
and yet you are
quiet like a sissy!

846
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Have you aged?

847
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,833
Well, chief,,,,

848
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,625
Stop giving me explanations,

849
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,583
If your guts are for real then finish
him off in two days and let me know,

850
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,375
I will chief,

851
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,833
Make sure I am not
involved in this,

852
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:37,917
OK chief,

853
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:45,792
So let's forget about leasing
the bar for Tamizharasan?

854
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:51,417
If we forget about it then
Karunakaran will feel bad,

855
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:55,458
Lease the bar in Tamizharasan's
name today itself,

856
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,292
OK chief,

857
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:00,500
After his death it'll
go to Anbu anyway,

858
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,333
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

859
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,000
I'll turn you into ashes,

860
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:26,292
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

861
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,250
I'll turn you into ashes,

862
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,667
Many living things matter
after death too but not you,

863
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,208
So back off you loser

864
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,667
I am my only competition,
so don't mess with me,

865
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,042
So back off you doofus,

866
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:44,583
Many living things matter
after death too but not you,

867
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:47,125
So back off you loser

868
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,625
I am my only competition,
so don't mess with me,

869
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:53,000
So back off you doofus,

870
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,000
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

871
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,125
I'll turn you into ashes,

872
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:02,042
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

873
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,958
I'll turn you into ashes,

874
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,792
Don't you underestimate me,

875
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,917
One heavy blow and you'll know!

876
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,750
Every failure of mine is a
stepping stone to success,

877
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,750
I am here to win,

878
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,750
I am not gonna miss the aim,

879
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,750
Join me and that would be swag!

880
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,667
I don't need any support,

881
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,667
My way is unique,

882
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,542
My will power is my first
weapon to approach success,

883
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:16,500
And my courage is the fuel
that keep myself running,

884
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:22,333
I'll make every drop
of my sweat count,

885
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:28,250
I'll convert all my struggles
into achievements,

886
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:34,708
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

887
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,250
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

888
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,417
I'll turn you into ashes,

889
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,042
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

Don't try to interrupt me,

892
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:25,167
Because I'm the rocket
that's headed to the sky,

893
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:28,250
I mind my own business,

894
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:31,208
Challenge me and I
won't back down,

895
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:34,042
I am not the one to budge for money,,,

896
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,208
because I believe in
friendship and love,

897
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:42,875
So don't you dare mess with me else
you'll be on your way in a stretcher,

898
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,083

and you'll have my respect,

899
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,708

I'll turn you into ashes,

903
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:04,250
Many living things matter
after death too but not you,

904
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,667
So back off you loser

905
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,167
I am my only competition,
so don't mess with me,

906
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,500
So back off you doofus,

907
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:18,958
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

908
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:21,958
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

909
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,583
I'll turn you into ashes,

910
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,583
Mess with me and you'll be a goner,

911
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:30,542
I'll turn you into ashes,

912
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,708
Greetings, May I come in?

913
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:38,625
Keep it inside,

914
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,958
I didn't expect this from you chief,

915
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,458
I had requested the bar behind
Central for my brother in law,

916
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:48,042
The minute I stepped out of station
you leased it to someone else,

917
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,083
I am still saying what I said earlier,

918
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,458
That bar is indeed for you,

919
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,292
Be patient,

920
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:00,042
Tell me about yourself,

921
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:04,375
I am businessman,

922
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,792
Apart from that, at home
it's just me and my grandpa,

923
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:09,167
I've don't have anyone else,

924
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,458
What about your parents?

925
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:17,625
They passed away when
I was 1 week old,

926
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:20,375
I am sorry,

927
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:21,250
It's OK,

928
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:25,667
- So what business do you do?
- How did they die?

929
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:31,708
My parents belonged to
different castes,

930
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,458
So amidst caste issues,,,

931
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,333
my mom's brother
killed my father,

932
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,625
Depressed, my mom fed me poison
and she too committed suicide,

933
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,625
I survived but she died,

934
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:49,333
And that earned me a nick name
Yaman - the god of death,

935
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:52,542
Sorry,

936
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:53,875
I shouldn't have asked,

937
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:55,417
It's OK,

938
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:00,167
Yes brother,

939
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,417
Where are you Tamizh?

940
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,542
I am at Besant Nagar, What is it?

941
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,375
Leave at once and
safe guard yourself,

942
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:09,083
You being alone might
prove risky for you,

943
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,833
That is why I'm advising you,

944
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:11,625
What happened?

945
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:14,833
It's an important call,

946
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,292
You guys carry on, I'll be back,

947
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,500
Well, OK,

948
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,000
There is camera everywhere here,

949
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,750
It's risky to finish
him off here,

950
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,458
Outside would be a
better choice to,,,

951
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:37,042
The line got disconnected,

952
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:38,042
Tell me,

953
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,417
Selva has decided that he wants
to finish you off today!

954
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:44,167
He has arranged contract
killers from outside,

955
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,708
Being alone is not safe for you,

956
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:49,875
Leave that place at once,

957
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,917
I'll find out about Selva's
hide out and let you know,

958
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,875
Finish him off today!

959
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:59,125
Or else he won't let you be in peace,

960
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,542
I'll call you back in sometime,

961
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,750
Be safe,

962
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,917
OK,

963
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:18,625
Sorry Agalya,,,

964
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,208
if you don't mind, I must leave,

965
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,875
But you invited me,

966
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:26,750
What happened suddenly?

967
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:27,875
I know it's wrong to do so,

968
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,333
And that is why I
am apologizing,

969
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:31,625
Come on now, Don't be sorry,

970
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:33,125
It's OK,

971
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,625
Neither did you deposit the cheque,,,

972
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,458
nor did you have the food,

973
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:43,458
I promise not to trouble you again pointing
this incomplete dinner as a reason,

974
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,167
OK then,

975
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:47,208
Thanks,

976
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:00,667
Start the engine,

977
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,125
Follow him,

978
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,083
Keep following him,

979
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,292
Let's crush him down
at some lonely place,

980
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,000
He has come to the right place,

981
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,375
Let's finish him in here,

982
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,500
Take the weapons,

983
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,542
Don't make it longer,
Make it quick,

984
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:46,833
Ask our men to disperse around,

985
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,250
Welcome sir,

986
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:07,708
Have a seat,

987
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,917
I had been to the
station to meet you,

988
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,333
I was ordered to come later,

989
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:11,958
Yeah right,,,

990
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,917
like you are an IAS officer,

991
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:17,208
Should I come down immediately
if you come to meet me?

992
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,583
Excuse me, please wait outside,

993
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,250
OK sir,

994
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,542
Let me come to the point,

995
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:29,125
Without your help,,,

996
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:32,042
I know that I can't run
a business in peace,

997
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:47,833
Write down how much should I bribe you and
others at your police station every month,

998
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,958
The money will reach you, where ever
you are, on first of the every month,

999
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,333
Would you like some tea or coffee?

1000
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:57,875
Tea and coffee here?

1001
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,625
Are the duplicate liquor
making good business?

1002
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,708
Sir, I don't sell
duplicates here,

1003
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:05,625
You just agreed to bribe me,,,

1004
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,833
then go ahead sell
whatever crap you want,

1005
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:08,625
But one thing,

1006
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,083
If you live up to your words,,,

1007
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:13,458
I'll be faithful to you,

1008
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,167
If you try to play Judas with me anytime,,,

1009
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,125
then remember there are lot of
them waiting to finish you off,

1010
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,167
I'll take what ever they
have to offer and,,,

1011
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,500
I'll be a trouble to you,
Got it?

1012
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:25,625
Got it,

1013
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:15,333
Just a moment sir,

1014
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,792
You said there are many
waiting to finish me,

1015
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,208
Can you be precise?

1016
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:20,875
Councilor Anbuazhagan,

1017
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,583
He was too keen on
taking over this bar,

1018
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,000
You foiled it for him,

1019
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,125
He is very furious,

1020
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,250
So watch out,

1021
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:32,167
Let's leave,

1022
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,500
Hey! Open the door!

1023
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:07,083
Speak out! Who bought you here?

1024
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:07,750
It was him,

1025
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,917
Get up!

1026
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:09,875
Who are you?

1027
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:10,583
Tell me,

1028
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,750
Selvam is at the Thangapandi's farm house,

1029
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:17,458
Better not to go over there
and create an issue,

1030
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,750
Forget it, We'll handle
him some other day,

1031
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:22,917
OK,

1032
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,875
He is the leader of all
those who came today,

1033
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,792
Your men told me that you were
looking around for me to kill me,

1034
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:16,708
And so here I am,

1035
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,167
You want to finish me off right?

1036
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:24,375
Here, Take it,

1037
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,667
If you don't finish
me off now then,,,

1038
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,000
I'll finish you,

1039
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:36,208
Chief, Now what's
this all about?

1040
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:40,792
How many time would have I obeyed
your orders without reasoning?

1041
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,042
Save me at least for being loyal,

1042
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:47,125
Tamizh,,,

1043
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:51,333
I've no idea about the
issue between you two,

1044
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,583
What Selva did was indeed wrong,

1045
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,583
Punish him how ever you want to,

1046
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,125
But then, don't kill him,

1047
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,417
He made me realize that it was a sin
to have let him go the first time,

1048
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,875
If I let him go again,,,

1049
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,750
then I face the same
plight as my dad,

1050
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:16,000
Chief,,,

1051
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,167
why are you quiet?

1052
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:21,417
Tell him the truth that I
have nothing to do with it,

1053
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:25,625
Chief?

1054
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:30,500
Will you open your mouth or
should I tell the truth?

1055
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:31,167
Selva!

1056
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,042
Get on thing straight
into your head!

1057
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,792
I am your chance to live!

1058
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,500
So think before you talk,

1059
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,458
It was you who asked me
to finish off Tamizh!

1060
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,792
Why are you quiet now?

1061
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:51,708
I said shut up! Stop talking!

1062
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,500
Did you say so?

1063
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:05,542
Come on Tamizh,

1064
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,500
He is blabbering out of fear,

1065
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:11,875
Why would you think so?

1066
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,833
You came to me
requesting a favor,

1067
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:18,250
As soon as I knew you were
Arivudai Nambi's son,,,

1068
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:21,583
I did that favor at once
and felt happy about it,

1069
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:26,125
Then why would I want to
finish you off, Tell me?

1070
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:33,083
Look here Tamizh,

1071
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,167
Listen to me,

1072
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:37,333
I promise it was not
all my decision,

1073
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:42,125
It was him who asked me hire contracted
killers from outside and finish you off,,,

1074
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,292
Liquor makes you talk crazy things!
Isn't it?

1075
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,333
Useless!

1076
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,750
Can't you just obey and shut up!

1077
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,583
Keeps arguing,

1078
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,833
Don't take it your head,

1079
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,208
Leave,

1080
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:23,958
Hey the shot is ready, Call
in the junior artists,

1081
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,917
Why is the position of
the lights altered?

1082
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,833
Excuse me, She is here,

1083
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:32,625
Please come,

1084
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,000
Please get in,

1085
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:40,708
Please come,

1086
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:45,750
Please wait outside,

1087
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:46,875
Come in when I call you,

1088
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:47,417
OK madam,

1089
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,167
Sorry for the trouble,

1090
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:57,708
I didn't know whom to
approach for a favor,

1091
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,917
I remembered only you,

1092
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,833
Don't be sorry,

1093
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:03,042
Tell me, What is it?

1094
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,958
I was born and bought
up in Bangalore,

1095
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,458
My mom and myself are alone here,

1096
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:15,417
Being an actress I get
many calls from fans,

1097
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:20,292
Since few days ago a guy started calling me claiming
to be a fan but later started harassing me,

1098
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:23,167
I gave him an earful and
blocked his number,

1099
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:26,583
He called me again, yesterday morning,
from another number

1100
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,250
I yelled at him again,

1101
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,500
And he said,,,

1102
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,833
that he wants to sleep with me and
will pay me how much ever I demand,

1103
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:42,042
I took a friend along and
lodged a police complaint,

1104
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,417
He called me from another number today morning
and says that he made a polite request,

1105
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:50,750
He threatened me and said that lodging
complaint with police ain't gonna do anything,

1106
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:58,250
He says that if I don't budge then he
knows how to get me to sleep with him,

1107
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:04,333
He said no police can do anything about it
and has gave me one week's time to respond,

1108
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:07,792
Don't worry,

1109
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,625
Give me all the numbers he has
called in from and the call details,

1110
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:12,708
I'll take care of the rest,

1111
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,042
Madam, shot is ready,

1112
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,875
Yeah, One minute,

1113
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,167
It's OK, No thanks,

1114
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,292
I think he has some
political support,

1115
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,542
Guess that is why he
is being so arrogant,

1116
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:37,167
You won't have to worry
about this anymore,

1117
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,208
A close friend of mine from my native,,,

1118
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,625
is a minister here,

1119
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:41,792
I'll take care of it,

1120
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,792
I feel some what courageous now,

1121
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:47,833
- Good,
- Thanks,

1122
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:48,417
It's OK,

1123
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,458
It's a walk in the park,
We can trace it,

1124
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,375
How do you know that actress?

1125
01:20:58,792 --> 01:20:59,792
Are you  guys close?

1126
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,750
Please introduce me to her,

1127
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,833
She is a very important
person in my life,

1128
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:08,375
Well I don't know what's with women and
fair men, They just like fair men,

1129
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,042
Doesn't your wife like you?

1130
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,333
I was just stating a fact,

1131
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,500
He was shocked
seeing Tamizharasan,

1132
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:25,750
Later, it was him who called up Selva
and asked him to finish off Tamizh,

1133
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:27,875
What has he decided now?

1134
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,417
I don't know the reason,,,

1135
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,208
but,,,

1136
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,125
he is quiet,

1137
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:37,292
Do you know anything?

1138
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:41,167
Tamizh believes that Selva sent
in men on Thangapandi's orders,

1139
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,417
But no one knows the reason behind it,

1140
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:49,833
Why should Thangapandi be
intimidated by Tamizh?

1141
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,417
There is something which
even Tamizh is unaware of,

1142
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,292
Who knows?

1143
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:04,875
Someday Tamizharasan could be the one that brings
about Thangapandian's downfall in an election,

1144
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:06,250
Be patient chief,

1145
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:08,292
I'll find out what it
is and let you know,

1146
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:12,375
It's the support and co
operation of people like you,,,

1147
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:14,542
that can make me win the election,

1148
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:18,958
I believe in our men more
than the deity I pray to,

1149
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:27,292
I've already spoke to the Mayor
regarding the water problem,

1150
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,333
Soon we'll take a call on that,

1151
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:32,208
We have speaking about
this issue for long now,

1152
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,625
But you are all drunk and
give irresponsible answer,

1153
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,333
Oldie,,,

1154
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,125
your grandson is turning the
whole town into drunkards,

1155
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,792
Stop acting genuine,

1156
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,250
You better stay quiet,

1157
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,958
Or else you'll be embarrassed,

1158
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,125
First, have some respect for
the age and experience,

1159
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,167
You sell duplicate liquor at the bar,,,

1160
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,458
you cheat the government
and earn in millions!

1161
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,208
And you demand respect!

1162
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,625
Well tell me something,,,

1163
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:59,417
every time when the question rises about why
sewage water is found mixed in drinking water,,,

1164
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,542
you don't have an answer,

1165
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:03,042
You keep talking about my bar,
What's your problem?

1166
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:05,917
So you accept that you
sell duplicate liquor?

1167
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,792
This is neither the place to discuss that nor
you are the person in charge to discuss that,

1168
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:11,458
Got it?

1169
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,208
Now check this out,

1170
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,375
He accepts that he sells
duplicate liquor,

1171
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:18,542
I'll wait here,

1172
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,792
Send your men to my bar,

1173
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:23,625
If you find even one bottle
of duplicate liquor,,,

1174
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,792
I shall cancel my bar license today,

1175
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:28,750
But if you fail to do so,,,

1176
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,208
will you resign your councilor post?

1177
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:31,875
Awesome!

1178
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:32,917
Why?

1179
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:34,833
Do you want to become the councilor?

1180
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,167
If you think you are so responsible,,,

1181
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:38,583
what should have you done?

1182
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:42,917
A little earnings you make from selling liquor
must be contributed to solve this water crisis,

1183
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,458
It's not much,

1184
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:47,625
If you had even spared money for at
least one truck of drinking water,,,

1185
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:52,333
I would have considered
listening to your reasoning,

1186
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,542
But you don't have such
genuine intentions,

1187
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,958
All that you want is a post,

1188
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,708
What happened? You've gone silent,

1189
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:02,125
Does it hurt when you are
asked to shed some money?

1190
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,125
So shut up and leave,

1191
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,583
I know what to do and when,

1192
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,000
You didn't cast vote for free,

1193
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,917
I had bribed everyone
as expected, Isn't it?

1194
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,875
How dare you applaud him?

1195
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:17,875
Whose money do you think it is,
with which you bribed others?

1196
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:20,750
It is just a small portion of
whatever you looted from all of us,

1197
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,875
Stop showing off like it's your money,

1198
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:26,667
Check that out, He couldn't stop talking until
I bought in money and now he is leaving,

1199
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:28,250
I am not like that,

1200
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,000
I live up to my promises,

1201
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:33,583
Sakthi,,,

1202
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,542
What's his source of income for all this?

1203
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:55,375
No idea,

1204
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:01,625
Excuse me, how about
lending a helping hand?

1205
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,208
Only 5 loads have arrived,

1206
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,792
He says there is more to come,

1207
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,000
Careful, Many are here to jinx it,

1208
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:08,917
He ain't doing this because I provoked him,

1209
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,750
He seems to have some plan,

1210
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,250
We must do something chief,

1211
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:15,833
Tamizh,,,

1212
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,667
why is Karunakaran's name
painted instead of yours?

1213
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:29,542
If any files a petition and questions
me about the source of income,,,

1214
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:30,792
then I'll be in prison,

1215
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,333
Hence Karunakaran's name,

1216
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:51,167
Greetings to all of you,

1217
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,417
" You must be the change you want to see in
the world" said the great leader Gandhiji,

1218
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:01,208
This gathering is the
beginning of that change,

1219
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:06,250
I hope everyone remembers Councilor
Anbuazhagan's response to water crisis,

1220
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,708
There is nothing wrong
with his response,

1221
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:13,042
Because it was us who sold
our votes to him for money,

1222
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:15,500
If we vote for money and freebies,,,

1223
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,083
then we lose even the basic rights of questioning the elected
politicians, Thanks to Anbu for making us understand this,

1224
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:25,167
One who has sufficient money
will never sell their vote,

1225
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,958
What about the downtrodden?
How will they refuse money?

1226
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:31,750
They take advantage
of our weakness,

1227
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,917
According to me, the
worst trait of all,,,

1228
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:37,583
is take advantage of one's
innocence and sidelining him/her,

1229
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:40,292
Super,

1230
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:44,417
And that doesn't mean
we should stay quiet,

1231
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:49,458
When I was thinking about how
to bring Anbu to justice,,,

1232
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,667
is when I decided to take
up his duty and perform it,

1233
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:54,125
This is just a
temporary solution,

1234
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:59,875
Even after this if Anbuazhagan fails to
realize his duties and perform it,,,

1235
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:02,542
not only that I'll take up that duty but,,,

1236
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:06,917
I'll start to bring about the change that
Gandhi spoke about and I'll start it from here,

1237
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:14,750
For this deeds that I do for you all without any
expectation of post, designation or any party's help,,,

1238
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:18,250
I hope you'll support me beyond factors
like caste, religion and political parties,

1239
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,667
I am here to help you,

1240
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:21,708
Thank you,

1241
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:41,042
He has been planning everything
since the beginning,

1242
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,375
I've made a decision,

1243
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,042
I'm getting into politics,

1244
01:27:56,542 --> 01:28:00,208
All of a sudden when one has to
speak in front of a crowd,,,

1245
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,250
one either blabbers
out of nervousness,,,

1246
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:04,417
or emotionally outbursts,

1247
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,542
I thought it was the same
with you when you spoke?

1248
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:10,708
What's with the sudden
liking towards politics?

1249
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,708
If there should be change in the society,,,

1250
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,500
then political power
is quite essential,

1251
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:20,458
How dare he? That too in your region
and even when you are still in power,

1252
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,625
He spoke about bringing
about a change,

1253
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:25,208
It is said that Politics is dirty,

1254
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,958
But only the one who lives
politics knows that,,,

1255
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:32,708
it's a dirt that mixed with
human's flesh and blood,

1256
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,833
It's impossible to become the
king if one fears to shed blood

1257
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:42,167
Name one king who hasn't shed blood,

1258
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:44,958
The kings ruled back then
in the name of King's rule,

1259
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,833
Today the politicians rule in
the name of Government rule,

1260
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,167
That's the only difference,

1261
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:55,875
I've lost most of my life with the dreams
of becoming the councilor one day,

1262
01:28:56,333 --> 01:29:02,250
And Yaman - the lord of death took your dad
away before he could take the MLA seat,

1263
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,458
More than successful people in politics,,,

1264
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:10,625
there are many who have perished
being just the party men,

1265
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,167
It's all because of your
soft corner for him,

1266
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:17,333
Now look he has stamped
right on your head,

1267
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:18,875
I speak from my experience,,,

1268
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,750
More than those brave hearts
who failed in politics,,,

1269
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,042
there many who fell
for corruption,

1270
01:29:25,417 --> 01:29:27,083
Don't trust anybody,

1271
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:29,333
Especially the ones with you,

1272
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,417
In politics, your enemy is not
the one standing against you,

1273
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,667
He'll be by your side
winning your trust,

1274
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:37,875
I very well know why
he did all this,

1275
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:40,958
I expected it that he'll
do this at some point,

1276
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:45,000
I pray that may your dad be your
holy angel and your guardian,

1277
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:01,250
Tell me,

1278
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,125
Minister wants to meet you,

1279
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:05,167
He wants you to
come down at once,

1280
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:06,583
OK,

1281
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:07,667
I'll come,

1282
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
He said he'll come,

1283
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:20,208
Come Tamizh, Chief
is waiting for you,

1284
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:37,833
So tell me,

1285
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,542
What's running inside that
little head of yours?

1286
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:50,708
Why have you given my son's phone
number to the police and trace him down?

1287
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,000
I want to talk with you in person,

1288
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,667
Step out,

1289
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,583
Looks like MLA wants to
speak with me in person,

1290
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,333
OK chief,

1291
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:18,583
I never gave you the
permission to be seated,

1292
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,333
Your son has called an actress called Anjana, whom I
know very well, He has harassed her over the phone,

1293
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:31,375
In order to find out whose number
it is, I gave it to the police,

1294
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:35,250
I didn't know that it was your
son until you mentioned it,

1295
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,750
What do you mean
by harassed her?

1296
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,083
What he did speak with her?

1297
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:46,250
Try to understand when I put
it in a diplomatic way,

1298
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,750
Worst come he might have
asked her to sleep with him,

1299
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:52,792
Isn't it?

1300
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,708
She romances and dances with
anonymous actors for money,

1301
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,958
That is the same thing
my son has asked for,

1302
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:03,708
Won't she budge?

1303
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,000
Do one thing,,,

1304
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:10,750
talk to her, make her understand and
ask her to do as my son wishes,

1305
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,292
I'll ask him to pay you too,

1306
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:13,833
Sounds good?

1307
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:18,500
Also,,,

1308
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:22,667
what's with you acting like a damn
savior for all the issues out there?

1309
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:24,500
Look here,,,

1310
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:29,042
I'm quite upset with you for whatever
you spoke in the Dias the other day,

1311
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:32,208
Do you think buying four water
tanks and providing water,,,

1312
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:35,083
will make the people around vote
for you and make you their MLA?

1313
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,708
One phone call,,,

1314
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,083
I send you to prison forever by
booking you under unclaimed charges,

1315
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,417
I'll leave no trace of you, your name
or your dad's legacy! Be careful!

1316
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:50,083
This must be our last meeting,

1317
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:52,917
If you appear in front of me again,,,

1318
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:55,000
you won't return alive,

1319
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,500
How dare you sit in front of me,

1320
01:32:56,542 --> 01:32:57,292
Get up!

1321
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,458
Stop being a pimp to your son,

1322
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:05,667
Tell your son that next time he calls Anjana it
must be only an apology call, Make it clear,

1323
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,000
You son of gun!

1324
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,917
How dare you order
me at my very home!

1325
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:12,292
One more word,,,

1326
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,958
and that will be your last word!

1327
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:17,167
Sit down!

1328
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:23,000
You can send me to prison under any
unclaimed charges and finish me off,

1329
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,833
But I'll make sure that I'll
finish you off before that,

1330
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:30,875
You and your son better
change for good,

1331
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:34,875
If I'll have to get down and do that
for you then you won't survive,

1332
01:34:13,917 --> 01:34:14,625
Please come in,

1333
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:22,125
Do you stay alone?

1334
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:24,583
Nope, My mom stays with me,

1335
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:28,125
She went to Bangalore as it
is exams time for my brother,

1336
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:29,708
She'll be back next week,

1337
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:31,542
Until then,,,

1338
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,208
remember Priya, who accompanied
me to the restaurant?

1339
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,875
She is giving me company,

1340
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:39,875
Have a seat,

1341
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,167
So you said that you found
out who was calling me,

1342
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:52,625
Remember I told you about a minister
who is close to me and from my native?

1343
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:53,250
Yes,,,

1344
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,792
It was his son who was calling you,

1345
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:57,833
You don't worry,

1346
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,833
I spoke to the minister,

1347
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:03,917
But still, until your mom returns,,,

1348
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:06,958
don't stay alone here,

1349
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,667
Go stay at your friend's place,

1350
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:09,833
Why?

1351
01:35:10,667 --> 01:35:12,542
Do you think he'll
create any problem?

1352
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,250
Nothing like that,

1353
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:17,958
If you've few people living with you
it'll make you feel courageous,

1354
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,250
Wait, I'll go get the candles,

1355
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:26,417
I'll switch on the torch,
Be careful,

1356
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:46,333
Can you wait here and leave
after the power supply is back,

1357
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:47,083
Please,

1358
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:47,833
Sure,

1359
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:49,250
Thanks,

1360
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:13,708
Quick! Get in!

1361
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,292
Fast, Drive fast!

1362
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:30,417
Tell me,

1363
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,292
Thamizh,,,

1364
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,042
there has been a fire
accident at your house,

1365
01:36:33,042 --> 01:36:35,792
Your grandpa has been admitted at
the government hospital nearby,

1366
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:38,250
I'm heading there, You
reach there immediately,

1367
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:41,167
I've no idea who it was,

1368
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:45,083
Did anyone call up the police?

1369
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:47,125
The neighbors have done it,

1370
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:48,333
Just a moment,

1371
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:52,875
If any one questions,,,

1372
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:54,458
say you don't know who it was,

1373
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,875
Also say that you have no
idea why they did this,

1374
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,708
Don't give away anything else,

1375
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:01,250
Especially about the MLA's son,

1376
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,542
We have no proofs,

1377
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,458
Looks like some men have
attacked my house too,

1378
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:10,208
My grandpa is admitted
in the hospital,

1379
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,125
I don't know what happened,

1380
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,500
Let me go check,

1381
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:18,792
Priya,,,

1382
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,708
Until Agalya's mom returns,,,

1383
01:37:23,417 --> 01:37:24,792
let her stay at your place,

1384
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,125
Won't you be back soon?

1385
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,875
Sure,

1386
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:30,583
Don't worry,

1387
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:07,958
How is my grandpa doing?

1388
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:12,333
Please get in and see
it for yourself,

1389
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:06,250
Don't reply to their questions,
Just keep walking,

1390
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:08,500
Anjana, who do you think
is behind the attack?

1391
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,667
Anjana, who was the guy with you,
Who is he to you?

1392
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,167
Is it true that he is the reason
behind those who attacked you?

1393
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,500
Tell us what happened?

1394
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,833
Are you shying away from media
because he is your lover?

1395
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:18,792
Answer us Anjana!

1396
01:39:26,417 --> 01:39:28,167
Enough of your acting!

1397
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:30,917
Pack up and settle down
with us in Bangalore,

1398
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,500
It's insulting!

1399
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,292
Why are you waiting outside?

1400
01:40:08,792 --> 01:40:09,792
Please come in,

1401
01:40:11,542 --> 01:40:12,333
Have a seat,

1402
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:28,333
I am sorry,

1403
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:30,708
For what?

1404
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,875
I was the one who said so,

1405
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:37,583
I came down to meet
you at the hospital,

1406
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:40,750
Then I met you at
the restaurant,

1407
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:44,208
It was the fear that I shouldn't
have any problems because of you,

1408
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,333
But,,,

1409
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,625
today I am not here with such intention,

1410
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:55,333
I explained everything clearly to my
parents and discussed with them,

1411
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:59,333
They refused to accept,

1412
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:01,917
Then I discussed it
with my friends,

1413
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:05,208
They said my decision is wrong,

1414
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:12,083
You step forward to help me and
now that has affected you,

1415
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:16,542
I feel I must be your side and my heart
says that is the right decision,

1416
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:19,250
And so I've conveyed it,

1417
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:26,417
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

1418
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:30,708
I do understand,

1419
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:33,542
Take one more day,

1420
01:41:34,542 --> 01:41:36,542
Think over it again,

1421
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:38,833
Here after,,,

1422
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:41,708
I am not ready to lose
anyone close to me,

1423
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:48,083
I have not seen my
parents since childhood,

1424
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:51,167
My grandpa was my everything,

1425
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:56,208
He was burned to ashes
at this very place,

1426
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:59,500
I still have an important
work left to do,

1427
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:02,667
Until I get done with it,,,

1428
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:05,875
you must wait patiently,

1429
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:11,667
Thangapandian ain't
Manimaran or Selvam,

1430
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:14,083
He is the ruling party minister,

1431
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:18,333
You cannot do anything to a
minister who is in power,

1432
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:24,167
But he can use his minister
powers and harm you in many ways,

1433
01:42:28,417 --> 01:42:30,167
Which is why, I am here to meet you,

1434
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:33,750
I have already spoke to the
party head regarding this,

1435
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:36,917
They have agreed to give
you their full support,

1436
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:42,542
First, let us notify Thangapandian
that you have the support of my party,

1437
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,375
It's only then he would refrain from attacking you out
of the fear that we would turn it into a general issue,

1438
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,958
But I am here to request
you for another favor,

1439
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:58,375
Tell me, What do
you want from me?

1440
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:03,875
Thiyagu must be made a
witness against Thangapandi,

1441
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:07,292
Thiyagu belongs to my community,

1442
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,458
He is from my native too,

1443
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:11,750
He comes down to meet once in a
while for the said attributes,

1444
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:15,000
You can't expect him to do so,

1445
01:43:15,042 --> 01:43:15,917
Leave him out of it,

1446
01:43:16,542 --> 01:43:20,083
Follow my idea and I can turn
Thiyagu into a witness,

1447
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:22,875
I know very well about
Thiyagu, Thamizh,

1448
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:25,458
He won't agree to this,
even if I request him to,

1449
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:27,292
Apart from that,,,

1450
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:30,375
why should he become a witness
against Thangapandian?

1451
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:33,375
What would make him do so? Tell me,

1452
01:43:48,542 --> 01:43:50,417
I'll ensure that he'll
have a reason to do so,

1453
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,167
If my idea fails,,,

1454
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:55,167
you won't be affected at all,

1455
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:58,792
But if my idea works out and if
Thiyagu turns into a witness,,,

1456
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:04,083
You will receive accolades for dethroning
Thangapandi who beat you in the last election,

1457
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,458
Tell me what should I do?

1458
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13,042
Bring Thiyagu here,

1459
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,750
Sometimes, even the easiest
of tasks are the one we,,,

1460
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,167
Come Thiyagu,

1461
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:23,375
We were waiting for you,

1462
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:25,875
What is it? Why did you want
me to come immediately?

1463
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:29,167
Thamizh wants to speak
with you in person,

1464
01:44:29,542 --> 01:44:30,292
Have a seat,

1465
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:34,875
Have a seat,

1466
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:38,792
You guys talk, I'll
be back in some time,

1467
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:39,875
Have a seat,

1468
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:45,375
How are you?

1469
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:47,208
Going on,

1470
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,792
How are you?

1471
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,208
I'm sure you must have heard,

1472
01:44:53,542 --> 01:44:57,625
Thangapandi finished off my
only blood relation, that I had,

1473
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:02,250
I've no idea who is
behind all that Tamizh,

1474
01:45:04,542 --> 01:45:06,750
You know what's the common
problem amongst us?

1475
01:45:09,042 --> 01:45:11,792
Be clear of the fact that others
problems don't become ours and,,,

1476
01:45:11,792 --> 01:45:13,875
then step aside and enjoy it,

1477
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:16,875
Believe me, I don't know anything,

1478
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:18,000
I understand,

1479
01:45:18,792 --> 01:45:20,625
Poor you, What can
you do about it?

1480
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:23,333
Your PA Thiyagu and,,,

1481
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:26,708
Tamizharasan are talking
about you at my home,

1482
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,708
What are you saying?

1483
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:31,000
Looks like it was you who ordered
Selva to finish off Tamizh,

1484
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:37,000
Also it was your men who set Tamizh's house
on fire and finished off his grandpa,

1485
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:39,542
Thank you,

1486
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:40,500
I'll take care of it,

1487
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,000
I'll talk to you later,

1488
01:45:42,292 --> 01:45:42,875
OK,

1489
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:51,958
Who is it Thiyagu?

1490
01:45:52,167 --> 01:45:53,292
It's minister,

1491
01:45:54,375 --> 01:45:56,458
Why is he calling me at this hour?

1492
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,625
We will be quiet,

1493
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,833
Go ahead, Attend it,

1494
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:04,708
Tell me chief,

1495
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:05,958
Where are you?

1496
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:07,375
At home,

1497
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,000
You mean Karunakaran's home?

1498
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,042
At my home,

1499
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,208
What if I prove that you are at
Karunakaran's house talking to Tamizh?

1500
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:15,792
Will you kill yourself?

1501
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:16,458
Chief!

1502
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:18,042
What are you saying?

1503
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:23,417
Believe me chief! Why
would I lie,,,to you,,,

1504
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:24,833
- Now!
- OK,

1505
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:26,458
Let's go,

1506
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:38,125
Believe me chief,

1507
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:40,042
I'll never betray you,

1508
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:42,750
I believe that none of
my enemies should exist,

1509
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,333
Chief!

1510
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:46,917
How dare you work for me and back
stab me along with my enemies?

1511
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:50,875
And now, only the deity you pray to,
can save you and your family from me,

1512
01:46:58,542 --> 01:46:59,333
Chief!

1513
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:03,625
Thangapandi somehow found
out that I am here,

1514
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,000
He threatens to finish off my family,

1515
01:47:08,042 --> 01:47:10,542
Please save us,

1516
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:14,417
I don't have to tell
you about Thangapandi,

1517
01:47:16,167 --> 01:47:19,292
He'll sacrifice his own family
for his post and power,

1518
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:23,583
First, call up your family
and ensure their safety,

1519
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:25,708
OK,

1520
01:47:41,958 --> 01:47:43,458
The mobile's switched off,

1521
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:46,292
Chief!

1522
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:48,125
Even the landline
phone isn't working,

1523
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,708
I am worried!

1524
01:47:50,542 --> 01:47:52,333
I have no one else but you,

1525
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,583
Until I am here you don't have to worry,

1526
01:47:57,583 --> 01:47:58,083
OK,

1527
01:47:59,042 --> 01:47:59,583
Tamizh,

1528
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Accompany Thiyagu to his house,

1529
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:04,458
Please Tamizh,

1530
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:33,167
The door is opened!

1531
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:44,250
Everyone's is missing at home Tamizh,

1532
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,667
Thangapandi!

1533
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:17,750
If anything happens to my family,,,

1534
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:19,875
don't think I'll stay quiet,

1535
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:24,000
I'll leak out all your
secrets and destroy you!

1536
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:26,458
You slave! How dare you
address me by my name!

1537
01:49:26,792 --> 01:49:30,125
Before you could leak my
secrets you'll be a corpse!

1538
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:33,542
He threatens to kill me Tamizh,

1539
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:37,292
Obey me and I shall
save your family,

1540
01:49:37,542 --> 01:49:38,958
Tell me what should I do Tamizh?

1541
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,542
Including the abduction of your family,

1542
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:47,167
I need you to expose Thangapandi's
every illegal activities,,,

1543
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,750
in front of the media,

1544
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,958
You have no idea about him Tamizh,

1545
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:54,417
He is dangerous,

1546
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:58,250
He might get furious and in rage
he might finish of my family,

1547
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:01,542
Do you think he'll spare them now?

1548
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:07,000
The minute the news is out about
Thangapandi abducting your family,,,

1549
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:10,167
he won't have any other
option than to let them out,

1550
01:50:11,042 --> 01:50:14,000
That is the only way
to save your family,

1551
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:20,208
Every second you delay is
dangerous for you family,

1552
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:29,875
Minister Thangapandi's PA turn
in witness against the minister,

1553
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:37,375
He reported to the press that the minister has
abducted his family and has threatened to kill them,

1554
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:42,375
He claims to have all the evidences to
Thangapandi's illegal activities and,,,

1555
01:50:42,417 --> 01:50:46,708
vows to hand it over to the police
at the right time, claims Thiyagu,

1556
01:50:46,792 --> 01:50:52,458
Further he has requested the Chief minister to
help him retrieve his family from Thangapandi,

1557
01:51:06,042 --> 01:51:09,667
It's all a propaganda to bring about
the downfall of our government,

1558
01:51:09,667 --> 01:51:14,708
Folks like my PA Thiyagu, actress
Anjana and Tamizharasan,,,

1559
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:20,042
are being wooed by the opposition and
have produced fake evidences against me,

1560
01:51:20,792 --> 01:51:24,708
If what they claim is to be true then why aren't
they going to the police? Why go to the media?

1561
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,792
Isn't that enough to realize
that this is all a drama?

1562
01:51:26,917 --> 01:51:30,042
The attacks that took place at
actress Anjana's house and,,,

1563
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:34,792
at her boy friend,
Tamizharasan's house,,,

1564
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:39,708
had minister Thangapandi's hand in it
and it has been reported to the police,

1565
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:46,375
It is to be noted that Tamizharasan's
grandpa was killed in this attack,

1566
01:51:58,583 --> 01:52:00,500
Right now chief is quite upset,

1567
01:52:00,542 --> 01:52:03,542
He told me to collect your resignation
letter, if you have bought it,

1568
01:52:16,292 --> 01:52:17,958
Welcome chief, Welcome,

1569
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:18,917
Bro,,,

1570
01:52:19,208 --> 01:52:20,292
Chief Karuna is here,

1571
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,708
Welcome,

1572
01:52:56,167 --> 01:53:03,000
You are god's gift to me and everything
appears to be like a poem written by the god,

1573
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:13,083
You are all I think of,
My heart is full of you,

1574
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:24,583
Your love has made me sleepless,

1575
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:34,000
Our love is our strength and it
grows stronger every second,

1576
01:53:53,583 --> 01:54:00,792
You are god's gift to me and everything
appears to be like a poem written by the god,

1577
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:10,417
You are all I think of,
My heart is full of you,

1578
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:41,333
All I wish for is to wake up
everyday and find you next to me

1579
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:50,708
And all I wish is to end
the day by your side,

1580
01:54:51,167 --> 01:55:00,625
Our love and us are
meant to be forever,

1581
01:55:00,792 --> 01:55:10,250
Even when I am asleep, all my eyes
look for is you and only you,

1582
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:36,667
You are god's gift to me and everything
appears to be like a poem written by the god,

1583
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:46,500
You are all I think of,
My heart is full of you,

1584
01:56:22,417 --> 01:56:31,458
Your love makes my
pains fade away,

1585
01:56:31,833 --> 01:56:41,167
And when you are not around,
my heart yearns for you,

1586
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:50,583
Step by step you came, swept me off my
feet and became a huge part of my life,

1587
01:57:25,167 --> 01:57:28,917
Seems like we'll be having an early
legislative assembly elections this time,

1588
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:33,250
In all the party gatherings
that happen in your region,,,

1589
01:57:33,792 --> 01:57:36,333
I want you and your wife
to participate in it,

1590
01:57:36,375 --> 01:57:43,167
Expose Thangapandi and how he
misused power to cheat the people,

1591
01:57:43,167 --> 01:57:46,042
You must ensure our
party's victory,

1592
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:51,958
Before that I would like
to let you know something,

1593
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:56,750
If the party agrees to what I have
to say then I'll do as you ordered,

1594
01:57:56,833 --> 01:58:01,167
Tamizh, don't hold back, Tell
what do you have in mind,

1595
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:04,458
Everyone here are well wishers,

1596
01:58:06,292 --> 01:58:11,583
In the upcoming elections, our Veera Tamizhar Muentra
Kazhagam party will be nominating a candidate,

1597
01:58:11,583 --> 01:58:13,208
I want to be that candidate,

1598
01:58:20,333 --> 01:58:23,792
I wanted to convey this
first to Mr,Karuna,,,

1599
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:26,083
but then I had to open it here,

1600
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:28,375
Has it come to this now? A candidate
seat for anyone who just walks in?

1601
01:58:28,667 --> 01:58:31,333
So what about those who toiled hard
for this party all these years?

1602
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:34,250
Look here, the party
has some regulations,

1603
01:58:34,292 --> 01:58:34,958
Got it?

1604
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:40,833
Thangapandian will definitely not get
a seat in the upcoming elections,

1605
01:58:40,875 --> 01:58:43,792
Everyone knows that I am
the reason behind that,

1606
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:49,417
For whatever good deeds I did for people in
my region has earned me a good reputation,

1607
01:58:49,583 --> 01:58:53,250
If any other candidate from our party stands then
you'll have to start promoting him from scratch,

1608
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:55,208
But I've sowed the seeds for
my promotion long back,

1609
01:58:55,250 --> 01:59:00,500
Think about the current scenario and think
who has the chance to win the election,

1610
01:59:01,958 --> 01:59:05,667
Let me talk to the party head
and other members of the party,

1611
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:07,792
Then I shall give you an answer Tamizh,

1612
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:09,917
I've decided to stand in
the upcoming election,

1613
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:11,792
There is no change in that,

1614
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:17,208
Your decision will make me either stand
as your party member or as an individual,

1615
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:21,042
Thank you,

1616
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:26,500
So fierce and dashing,,,

1617
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:30,583
It's time he revealed
himself to the world,

1618
01:59:30,667 --> 01:59:34,083
So fierce and dashing,,,

1619
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:38,083
It's time he revealed
himself to the world,

1620
01:59:38,875 --> 01:59:41,167
In the upcoming election,,,

1621
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:45,542
the party management is not willing
to make you the candidate Karuna,

1622
01:59:46,625 --> 01:59:53,708
It's because the party head believed that it was
your brainchild behind exposing Thangapandi,,,

1623
01:59:54,292 --> 01:59:56,125
he allowed to give you
the candidate seat,

1624
01:59:56,667 --> 01:59:58,167
But based on his statement,,,

1625
01:59:58,708 --> 02:00:00,875
I don't think anything can change
the party head's mind now,

1626
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:05,042
I need sometime,

1627
02:00:05,333 --> 02:00:07,667
If we let Tamizh represent
us in that region,,,

1628
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:10,542
our chances to win
are very high,

1629
02:00:10,917 --> 02:00:14,667
So the sooner you bring him on to
your line, it will be better for you,

1630
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:18,500
Or else the seat is
for Tamizharasan,

1631
02:00:19,792 --> 02:00:24,292
This was the moment I had been waiting for past
5 years and for which I had toiled so hard,

1632
02:00:24,583 --> 02:00:28,208
And that useless fellow
wants to snatch it away!

1633
02:00:28,458 --> 02:00:32,333
He thinks politics is about doing good deeds
to people and that will make him their leader,

1634
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:36,917
I'll make him understand the this is the game
of thrones played by the witty and the clever,

1635
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:47,500
Hello?

1636
02:00:49,167 --> 02:00:51,125
Yes, he is here,

1637
02:00:52,792 --> 02:00:54,417
I am fine,

1638
02:00:54,958 --> 02:00:56,375
How have you been?

1639
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,333
Hope your wife is doing fine,

1640
02:01:00,417 --> 02:01:01,917
Hold on, I'll hand it to him,

1641
02:01:07,125 --> 02:01:08,583
It's Thangapandi,

1642
02:01:16,417 --> 02:01:17,542
Tell me Pandi,

1643
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:23,000
Fine, I'll come,

1644
02:01:24,833 --> 02:01:25,583
What is it?

1645
02:01:27,208 --> 02:01:30,458
Something important,
He wants to meet me,

1646
02:01:46,042 --> 02:01:47,792
Welcome, Welcome,

1647
02:01:49,708 --> 02:01:52,167
Kasi, you wait outside, I'll call you if I need you,

1648
02:01:52,167 --> 02:01:52,625
OK chief,

1649
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,542
This is councilor Anbuazhagan,

1650
02:01:56,167 --> 02:01:57,417
What would you like to have?

1651
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,833
No thanks,

1652
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,333
What is so important Pandi,
that you wanted to meet me?

1653
02:02:02,958 --> 02:02:03,792
You have a seat,

1654
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:06,583
I heard everything,

1655
02:02:07,042 --> 02:02:10,042
It because I thought you were behind
Tamizharasan all this while,,,

1656
02:02:10,417 --> 02:02:13,208
I held back myself from
finishing him off,

1657
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:16,208
Nurturing him was
my biggest mistake,

1658
02:02:16,667 --> 02:02:18,542
It's not too late,

1659
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:20,792
I've an idea,

1660
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:23,542
If you accept to comply,,,

1661
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:27,375
then you'll be the next
MLA in our region,

1662
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:28,500
What do you say?

1663
02:02:30,208 --> 02:02:31,625
Could you be more precise?

1664
02:02:33,542 --> 02:02:35,375
Talk to your party members and,,,

1665
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:38,250
make Tamizharasan the candidate,

1666
02:02:39,167 --> 02:02:43,250
Work hard and ensure his victory,

1667
02:02:44,667 --> 02:02:46,208
Just before the election,,,

1668
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:49,000
I'll finish him off,

1669
02:02:50,417 --> 02:02:53,708
Once Tamizharasan is dead,
all you have to do is,,,

1670
02:02:53,958 --> 02:02:57,167
ensure that the MLA candidate
seat becomes yours,

1671
02:03:00,375 --> 02:03:03,625
I very well know that your aim
is not to make me the MLA,

1672
02:03:04,167 --> 02:03:05,958
What do you want in return?

1673
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:12,750
My policy is that this business in
politics must benefit both the parties,

1674
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:19,625
In order to erase off all
the charges against me,,,

1675
02:03:19,667 --> 02:03:21,750
the prime witness,,,

1676
02:03:22,292 --> 02:03:24,500
Thiyagu must die,

1677
02:03:27,042 --> 02:03:29,250
Tell me where and when
do you want Thiyagu?

1678
02:03:29,667 --> 02:03:30,833
I'll send him,

1679
02:03:32,583 --> 02:03:34,792
OK, We'll make it grand,

1680
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:37,750
OK, I'll be there,

1681
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:45,125
The party has confirmed me the MLA post,

1682
02:03:47,542 --> 02:03:50,958
They have promised to announce it
in the upcoming gathering on 24th,

1683
02:03:57,458 --> 02:03:59,458
See I am your lady luck,

1684
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,417
You got that seat
because you married me,

1685
02:04:04,083 --> 02:04:05,792
Hope you understand
how lucky you are,

1686
02:04:06,958 --> 02:04:08,333
Flash news,,,

1687
02:04:08,417 --> 02:04:16,917
Thiyagarajan aka Thiyagu, PA to ex minister Thangapandi,
who turned against him as witness and exposed him,,,

1688
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:21,583
met with an accident last
night and died on the spot,

1689
02:04:21,792 --> 02:04:26,042
Reports claim that he was
drunk while driving,

1690
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:29,667
Thiyagu is survived by his
wife, a daughter and a son,

1691
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,833
As per ex minister
Thangapandi's statement,,,

1692
02:04:34,292 --> 02:04:35,417
Tell me Tamizh,

1693
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,250
Did you hear?

1694
02:04:38,292 --> 02:04:39,833
This is a planned murder,

1695
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:41,625
What makes you think like that?

1696
02:04:42,083 --> 02:04:44,375
Come on, Don't you think so?

1697
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:48,000
Do you doubt anyone?

1698
02:04:48,625 --> 02:04:50,583
I am sure it's Thangapandi,

1699
02:04:51,375 --> 02:04:53,042
Thangapandi?

1700
02:04:53,875 --> 02:04:56,667
Why? Don't you
have a hand in it?

1701
02:04:57,542 --> 02:04:59,833
I warned you in the
beginning itself,

1702
02:05:00,417 --> 02:05:04,625
To keep Thiyagu away from the
problems between you and Thangapandi,

1703
02:05:04,792 --> 02:05:06,250
But you refused to obey,

1704
02:05:06,458 --> 02:05:07,833
What are you coming at?

1705
02:05:08,625 --> 02:05:13,500
In a way, I am too a reason for Thiyagu's
death, by playing according to your plan,

1706
02:05:14,792 --> 02:05:17,375
No one's innocent here, Tamizh,

1707
02:05:18,292 --> 02:05:23,083
Everyone here does everything
with a motive behind it,

1708
02:05:23,792 --> 02:05:24,958
Including Thiyagu,

1709
02:05:25,958 --> 02:05:28,250
According to the news,,,

1710
02:05:28,583 --> 02:05:31,208
I made my peace with the fact
that Thiyagu died in an accident,

1711
02:05:31,333 --> 02:05:32,833
You too better make peace with it,

1712
02:05:33,417 --> 02:05:34,125
Hello?

1713
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:36,542
Are you there Tamizh?

1714
02:05:36,583 --> 02:05:37,417
Yes, I am here,

1715
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:44,417
Sometimes, only when you make peace
with the lie instead of the truth,,,

1716
02:05:44,417 --> 02:05:47,833
you can live a guilt free life,

1717
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:50,167
Thiyagu's death is such an instance,

1718
02:05:56,042 --> 02:05:57,000
Leave that,

1719
02:05:57,125 --> 02:05:59,333
Did you receive any call
from the party office?

1720
02:05:59,792 --> 02:06:00,750
Yes I did,

1721
02:06:01,542 --> 02:06:05,042
They have planned a gathering on
24th to announce the candidate,

1722
02:06:05,375 --> 02:06:07,250
They want to make it a grand one,

1723
02:06:07,708 --> 02:06:08,458
Tamizh,,,

1724
02:06:08,958 --> 02:06:13,333
all your attention and actions must
now be only about the election,

1725
02:06:13,583 --> 02:06:16,375
Do not miss the golden
opportunity that you have got,

1726
02:06:17,583 --> 02:06:18,500
OK,

1727
02:06:19,167 --> 02:06:22,583
We'll meet at Thiyagu's house, Don't confuse
yourself, Concentrate on the election,

1728
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:28,000
What did he say?

1729
02:06:29,917 --> 02:06:32,000
There is something fishy
about the way he spoke,

1730
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:35,333
He says that I too have a
hand in Thiyagu's death,

1731
02:06:36,458 --> 02:06:38,875
He doesn't seemed to be shocked
at all by Thiyagu's death,

1732
02:06:40,833 --> 02:06:45,833
He talks as if it's an old news and consoles me to make
peace with the fact the Thiyagu indeed died in an accident,

1733
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:51,042
What are you thinking?

1734
02:06:52,333 --> 02:06:56,042
Only Karuna and myself
knew Thiyagu's hide out,

1735
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:58,458
I didn't share it to anyone,

1736
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:03,500
Something is really fishy!

1737
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:09,375
Why did I put you
under Tamizharasan?

1738
02:07:10,417 --> 02:07:12,292
Because you belong
to my community,,,

1739
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:15,708
and I believed that you'll be loyal to me,
Was it wrong to believe so?

1740
02:07:15,958 --> 02:07:16,833
No chief,

1741
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:21,375
Why didn't you inform me about Tamizh's plan
to stand in as candidate in the election?

1742
02:07:24,792 --> 02:07:27,625
No one knew that he had such ideas,

1743
02:07:27,667 --> 02:07:30,542
Is what I am paying
you the salary for?!

1744
02:07:31,125 --> 02:07:34,167
This is why our community
men never prosper!

1745
02:07:38,708 --> 02:07:39,958
Thiyagu is no more,

1746
02:07:40,708 --> 02:07:42,125
Do you at least know that?

1747
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,542
I watched it in the news,

1748
02:07:45,917 --> 02:07:47,750
I heard that he died
in an accident,

1749
02:07:49,042 --> 02:07:51,500
Do you blindly believe in the news?

1750
02:07:51,625 --> 02:07:52,750
It was a planned murder,

1751
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:55,333
It was executed by
none other than,,,

1752
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:57,333
Tamizharasan himself,

1753
02:07:58,583 --> 02:08:00,917
First, he grabs my MLA seat,

1754
02:08:01,042 --> 02:08:05,542
And now he finished off Thiyagu who belongs to our
community and will earn all the sympathies out of it,

1755
02:08:05,583 --> 02:08:07,667
What will the people think?

1756
02:08:08,333 --> 02:08:13,792
Won't they think that it was Thangapandi
who killed Thiyagu to save himself?

1757
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:15,542
You are right,

1758
02:08:16,458 --> 02:08:18,667
He has planned
everything very clearly,

1759
02:08:18,708 --> 02:08:23,417
He thinks he can make a fool out of
us and make his ideas a reality,

1760
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:25,250
I won't spare him,

1761
02:08:25,667 --> 02:08:27,667
I'll show what we
are made up of,

1762
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:30,458
I need your help,

1763
02:08:31,542 --> 02:08:35,083
For the salary I paid
you and for our race,,,

1764
02:08:35,125 --> 02:08:38,208
it's time for you to
prove your loyalty,

1765
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:40,375
Tell me chief, What should I do?

1766
02:08:42,917 --> 02:08:48,292
On 24th, there will be a gathering to announce Tamizh as the candidate,

1767
02:08:48,792 --> 02:08:52,667
That must be the first and the
last gathering he attends,

1768
02:08:54,167 --> 02:08:56,042
Tamizh is quite intelligent,

1769
02:08:56,750 --> 02:09:01,500
The clever thing to do is finish him off by being
along side him instead of facing off with him,

1770
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:04,542
But Thangapandi has other ideas,

1771
02:09:05,042 --> 02:09:11,917
Thangapandi's men are going to present there at gathering
and they plan to finish off Tamizh after the gathering,

1772
02:09:13,458 --> 02:09:16,292
You make sure that you are along
side Tamizharasan all the while,

1773
02:09:16,667 --> 02:09:19,833
If he escapes from the clutches
of Thangapandi's men,,,

1774
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:23,583
then you must stab him hard
enough that it must kill him,

1775
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:25,375
OK chief,

1776
02:09:25,917 --> 02:09:29,708
Once you confirm he is dead,
you can flee from that spot,

1777
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,625
OK chief,

1778
02:09:32,083 --> 02:09:33,750
Don't worry,

1779
02:09:37,625 --> 02:09:38,958
As the meeting ends,,,

1780
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:42,750
Thangapandi's men will cut
down the power supply,

1781
02:09:44,208 --> 02:09:45,917
It will be pitch dark,

1782
02:09:48,042 --> 02:09:51,125
During the riots everyone will only
be concerned about themselves,

1783
02:09:52,208 --> 02:09:54,208
No one will notice you,

1784
02:09:55,208 --> 02:09:56,833
This  is just the advance,

1785
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:00,625
If you execute this plan to perfection,,,

1786
02:10:00,875 --> 02:10:05,542
I'll get you the bar as well as the
parking contract of the railway station,

1787
02:10:05,833 --> 02:10:06,917
OK chief,

1788
02:10:06,958 --> 02:10:10,208
You can mint money literally
doing nothing, Take it,

1789
02:10:15,917 --> 02:10:16,583
God bless you,

1790
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:53,042
You are all by yourself,

1791
02:10:53,083 --> 02:10:56,625
You are your only support,

1792
02:10:56,875 --> 02:11:00,667
So be daring and
be a brave heart,

1793
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:04,208
It's time for the
battle of your life,

1794
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:08,458
You will see a new sunrise,

1795
02:11:08,583 --> 02:11:12,375
You will and you can,

1796
02:11:12,417 --> 02:11:16,250
Face all the hurdles,,,

1797
02:11:16,417 --> 02:11:19,583
and smash  them down,

1798
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:24,500
Problems will keep arising,,,

1799
02:11:24,542 --> 02:11:28,042
never let your confidence
and courage shake,

1800
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:32,083
All those lesson about
truth always tirumphs,,,

1801
02:11:32,167 --> 02:11:35,917
remember it and battle like a warrior!

1802
02:11:36,125 --> 02:11:39,667
You are all by yourself,

1803
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:43,625
You are your only support,

1804
02:11:43,667 --> 02:11:47,542
So be daring and
be a brave heart,

1805
02:11:47,583 --> 02:11:51,042
It's time for the
battle of your life,

1806
02:11:53,375 --> 02:11:54,083
Hold on,

1807
02:11:55,625 --> 02:11:56,917
You forgot your mobile,

1808
02:12:01,625 --> 02:12:03,250
Why do you look dull?

1809
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:06,083
You've been carrying a
dull face since morning,

1810
02:12:08,417 --> 02:12:09,375
Are you nervous?

1811
02:12:10,125 --> 02:12:11,458
Shall I come along with you?

1812
02:12:11,625 --> 02:12:12,958
It's not too late,

1813
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,417
You tell me and I
shall join you,

1814
02:12:16,917 --> 02:12:17,875
Not today,

1815
02:12:18,833 --> 02:12:21,292
As planned, you go
to Priya's house,

1816
02:12:21,542 --> 02:12:24,167
I'll definitely take you
for the next meeting,

1817
02:12:25,167 --> 02:12:29,083
Amongst all the good
and bad deeds,,,

1818
02:12:29,125 --> 02:12:33,833
The truth, the honesty and the brave
are the only ones that will triumph,

1819
02:12:36,917 --> 02:12:40,875
Amongst all the good
and bad deeds,,,

1820
02:12:40,917 --> 02:12:45,375
The truth, the honesty and the brave
are the only ones that will triumph,

1821
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:23,750
Uncorruptible ways and quality
of being straight forward,,,

1822
02:13:23,792 --> 02:13:27,583
is not an easy life to live,

1823
02:13:27,625 --> 02:13:31,667
Betrayal and deception
is all around you,

1824
02:13:31,667 --> 02:13:35,375
Go past them and
keep progressing,

1825
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:39,375
Even the lies disguise
here as the truth,,,

1826
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:43,333
but justice will
prevail ultimately,

1827
02:13:43,542 --> 02:13:47,167
You are all by yourself,

1828
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:50,917
You are your only support,

1829
02:13:51,083 --> 02:13:55,167
So be daring and
be a brave heart,

1830
02:13:55,208 --> 02:13:58,417
It's time for the
battle of your life,

1831
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:02,667
You will see a new sunrise,

1832
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:06,500
You will and you can,

1833
02:14:06,625 --> 02:14:10,500
Face all the hurdles,,,

1834
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:14,125
and smash  them down,

1835
02:14:14,917 --> 02:14:21,250
To everyone present here at the candidate announcement
gathering of Veera Thamizhar Munetra Kazhagam,,,

1836
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:23,542
I extend my hearty welcome,

1837
02:14:23,583 --> 02:14:27,083
This is a very important gathering, You
could have bought Anjana along,

1838
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,417
At least, let one member
in my family be alive,

1839
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,750
Hence I didn't bring her along,

1840
02:14:36,375 --> 02:14:37,542
What do you mean Tamizh?

1841
02:14:37,833 --> 02:14:40,583
When I was about to leave
after our first meet,,,

1842
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:42,375
you must have let me go,

1843
02:14:43,708 --> 02:14:45,833
It's a game that you started,

1844
02:14:46,292 --> 02:14:48,625
Well, I have decided to end it,

1845
02:14:49,125 --> 02:14:51,625
I don't understand a
thing you are saying,

1846
02:14:53,708 --> 02:14:56,417
This might be a candidate
announcement gathering for others,,,

1847
02:14:57,583 --> 02:14:59,042
but for me this is
the battlefield,

1848
02:15:00,083 --> 02:15:03,208
I'm saying that, I have come here
knowing very well that I might die,

1849
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,667
The only difference,,,

1850
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:10,167
You must be here with
you some 20 men,,,

1851
02:15:10,875 --> 02:15:13,375
and I'm here with 50 of them,
That's all,

1852
02:15:15,208 --> 02:15:16,500
I am Yaman - the god of death!

1853
02:15:17,875 --> 02:15:19,917
I've been invited
here forcefully,,,

1854
02:15:21,208 --> 02:15:23,000
I won't leave without taking lives,

1855
02:15:23,542 --> 02:15:24,333
Tamizh,,,

1856
02:15:24,958 --> 02:15:27,083
you are talking out in haste,

1857
02:15:29,667 --> 02:15:31,667
From your meeting
with Thangapandian,,,

1858
02:15:32,292 --> 02:15:33,833
to Thiyagu's murder,

1859
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:37,042
I've understood everything and hence
I am not talking out in haste,

1860
02:15:47,125 --> 02:15:49,833
You'll understand if I explain
everything it in detail,

1861
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
But this is not the place,

1862
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:54,875
Let's talk after the meeting,

1863
02:15:57,375 --> 02:16:00,667
Post meeting only one
of us will be alive,

1864
02:16:01,292 --> 02:16:02,750
Both of us know that very well,

1865
02:16:06,667 --> 02:16:09,125
You have already planned to
finish me off after the meeting,

1866
02:16:10,708 --> 02:16:13,167
But before that happens,,,

1867
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:18,083
I've decided to finish you off,

1868
02:16:18,625 --> 02:16:21,083
I consider you as my own son,

1869
02:16:21,458 --> 02:16:23,250
Do you think I'll plan
something like that?

1870
02:16:26,667 --> 02:16:28,500
Dad or son; in politics,,,

1871
02:16:30,292 --> 02:16:32,292
once the eyes are set
on the power and post,,,

1872
02:16:32,667 --> 02:16:36,417
people will destroy each other, I
understood that by observing you,

1873
02:16:38,792 --> 02:16:40,417
Forgive me Tamizh,

1874
02:16:43,083 --> 02:16:45,458
The results of the decision
we make in our lives,,,

1875
02:16:45,958 --> 02:16:47,417
must be accepted
whole heartedly,

1876
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,583
So you too forgive me,

1877
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,208
Now even if I want to,,,

1878
02:16:52,458 --> 02:16:56,000
I cannot stop whatever
is going to happen here,

1879
02:16:56,667 --> 02:16:59,875
If luck favors then
we'll meet again,

1880
02:17:00,125 --> 02:17:02,708
A,Tamizharasan will now
accept the candidate seat,

1881
02:17:13,875 --> 02:17:14,583
Tamizh,,,

1882
02:17:15,042 --> 02:17:16,667
I like you very much,

1883
02:17:18,458 --> 02:17:21,542
I've no personal
vengeance against you,

1884
02:17:21,625 --> 02:17:22,625
Pure business,

1885
02:17:24,042 --> 02:17:25,625
I hope you'll understand,

1886
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:28,000
Sure,

1887
02:17:29,917 --> 02:17:32,500
I am here today because of you,

1888
02:17:33,542 --> 02:17:35,292
I'll never forget that
until my last breath,

1889
02:17:40,208 --> 02:17:46,458
Now, the general Secretary will honor A,
Tamizharasan with a garland,

1890
02:17:52,583 --> 02:17:54,708
Tamizh is aware of the plan,

1891
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:57,708
Finish him off even before
he completes his speech,

1892
02:17:58,917 --> 02:18:00,667
You don't worry,

1893
02:18:00,708 --> 02:18:01,958
I'll save you,

1894
02:18:02,458 --> 02:18:03,375
How?

1895
02:18:03,792 --> 02:18:06,375
Just the way you saved Thiyagu?

1896
02:18:08,792 --> 02:18:11,333
It was me who exposed
your plan to Tamizh,

1897
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,083
Sir, they are carrying
petrol bombs,

1898
02:20:18,292 --> 02:20:21,375
We cannot manage them unless we have
extra force, Send them in quick,

1899
02:21:03,542 --> 02:21:07,417
Amongst all the good
and bad deeds,,,

1900
02:21:07,417 --> 02:21:11,375
The truth, the honesty and the brave
are the only ones that will triumph,

1901
02:21:55,458 --> 02:22:00,042
We have evidences with regards to the
riots that happened at the gathering,

1902
02:22:00,167 --> 02:22:04,333
Initial investigation reveals that internal
party spat is the reason behind it,

1903
02:22:04,583 --> 02:22:06,292
Investigation continues
on that basis,

1904
02:23:08,875 --> 02:23:09,667
You talk to her,

1905
02:23:09,875 --> 02:23:11,292
I'll wait outside,

1906
02:23:24,375 --> 02:23:26,417
Who do you think is behind all this?

1907
02:23:26,583 --> 02:23:29,250
Kasi, who was caught carrying
weapons at the spot,,,

1908
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:34,917
has agreed that it was minister
Thangapandi who has sent him to kill me,

1909
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,250
But for some reason the
police isn't revealing it,

1910
02:23:38,583 --> 02:23:42,792
Just because Kasi says we cannot believe it's Thangapandi
behind all this, Do you have any other proof?

1911
02:23:42,958 --> 02:23:45,333
In a gathering where I was about to
be announced as the candidate,,,

1912
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:47,792
in an attempt to murder me,,,

1913
02:23:47,792 --> 02:23:51,750
poor Karunakaran has become the
victim, as you can see it,

1914
02:23:52,333 --> 02:23:53,333
That is a proof,

1915
02:23:53,333 --> 02:23:55,917
Just for exposing Thangapandi
and his scams,,,

1916
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,500
poor Thiyagu was killed
off in a staged accident,

1917
02:23:58,958 --> 02:24:00,167
That's another proof,

1918
02:24:00,208 --> 02:24:03,292
Death of ex minister Karunakaran,,,

1919
02:24:03,292 --> 02:24:07,708
was the plan of ex minister
Thangapandi claims the opposition,

1920
02:24:07,708 --> 02:24:15,083
This is confirmed by the fact that Thangapandi
is been missing for the past few days,

1921
02:24:15,125 --> 02:24:19,625
Hence the accusation of the opposition
on this murder now holds very strong,

1922
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:28,375
Post the elections in the Tamil Nadu,,,

1923
02:25:28,417 --> 02:25:34,083
Veera Tamizhar Munetra Kazhagam has won the
majority seats and have formed the new government,

1924
02:25:34,125 --> 02:25:39,833
The party's candidate A, Tamizharasan won
the election by a very large margin,

1925
02:25:39,917 --> 02:25:45,500
If the talks are to be believed, he
might be offered to be the minister,

1926
02:26:11,083 --> 02:26:12,000
So Pandi,,,

1927
02:26:13,167 --> 02:26:14,250
how are you?

1928
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:20,375
I've a small doubt,

1929
02:26:21,875 --> 02:26:24,125
When I left after meeting
you for the first time,,,

1930
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,542
why did you order
Selvam to murder me?

1931
02:26:29,583 --> 02:26:31,292
- Don't you really know why?
- Nope,

1932
02:26:35,875 --> 02:26:37,292
If I tell you the truth,,,

1933
02:26:38,125 --> 02:26:41,292
will you hand me over to
the police unharmed?

1934
02:26:42,875 --> 02:26:43,792
Nope, I can't do that,

1935
02:26:46,083 --> 02:26:48,917
In your efforts to murder
me amidst the riot,,,

1936
02:26:48,958 --> 02:26:52,792
Karunakaran died and everyone thinks
you are absconding because of that,

1937
02:26:53,583 --> 02:26:57,250
It's better that few
truths remain unrevealed,

1938
02:26:59,458 --> 02:27:03,667
It's better that you never
realize few truths,

1939
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:19,708
By putting an end to a criminal,,,

1940
02:27:20,292 --> 02:27:22,625
doesn't make the another
criminal a genuine person,

1941
02:27:23,875 --> 02:27:25,875
If what I did was wrong,,,

1942
02:27:26,542 --> 02:27:28,542
then what you are about
to do is too wrong,

1943
02:27:30,958 --> 02:27:36,250
There is a big difference between doing a
wrong and finish off a wrong doer, Pandi,

1944
02:27:37,583 --> 02:27:41,125
Punishing you for your
sins isn't a sin,

1945
02:30:05,708 --> 02:30:10,250
I, Tamizharasan,,,

1946
02:31:47,958 --> 02:31:52,500
