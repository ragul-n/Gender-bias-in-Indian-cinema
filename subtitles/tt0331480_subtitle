3
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,940
Where are you going, ma'am?

4
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,010
I'm going in search of a job.

5
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,640
"I'm going in search of a job."

6
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,920
You make this same
excuse every day and leave.

7
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,600
When do I get the rent?

8
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,720
As soon as I get a job
I'll pay you the rent.

9
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,690
That's what you said
when you rented the room.

10
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,200
"I'll pay you the rent
as soon as I get a job."

11
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,960
It's been 6 months...

12
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,340
and you haven't gotten a job
and I haven't gotten any rent.

13
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,070
I'm trying my best.

14
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,730
But I'm not lucky at all.

15
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,910
You should have died
if you were so unlucky.

16
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,060
- Why did you come here?
- Look.

17
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,660
Don't abuse me.

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,940
Look at her. When you needed a room...

19
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,310
you pleaded in front of me.

20
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,610
Now, when I ask for rent
you pounce on me.

21
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Did you see? This is what happens
when you do someone a favor.

22
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,540
Just wait for one more day.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,190
An office has called me for
an interview after I applied.

24
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,550
- I hope I get that job.
- I don't care about your job.

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,190
If I don't get the rent today
then I'll throw away your baggage.

26
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,020
Why shout at me?

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,660
Didn't I promise
to pay the rent today?

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,850
Now when you return,
bring the rent with you.

29
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,470
Or else don't come back.

30
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,180
Did you see? This is what happens
when you do someone a favor.

31
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,240
She has neither parents
nor a house in which to live.

32
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,940
And when I gave her a room
to live, she doesn't pay the rent.

33
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,240
You'd better collect the rent every week.

34
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,410
How can you believe such people?

35
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,190
That's a good suggestion.

36
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,720
So first you give
me this week's rent.

37
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,960
Mr. Dharoga...

38
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,790
I'd like to thank you
in Urdu as well as in Hindi.

39
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,940
I've been really happy
here for six months.

40
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,200
This is like your own house.

41
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,150
I'll tell you it's a very good house.

42
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,860
Then Mr. Dharoga, good bye
in Urdu as well as in English.

43
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,490
- Good bye. Good bye.
- Good bye, my friend.

44
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,396
I hope I won't see you
for a long time.

45
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,900
No, sir. We'll meet very soon.

46
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,366
You want to return to this place?

47
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,990
- Don't we have any other jail?
- No, sir. We'll never meet again.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,626
It's so good to breathe
this air filled with freedom.

49
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,420
Doesn't it seem colder
than it really is, Mr. Mohan?

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,110
Very good, Mr. Sohan.

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
This is coming directly
from the Himalayan Mountains.

52
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,606
I wish I could live the life
of a saint from now on.

53
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,240
Come with me, you saint.

54
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,080
- Sir, do you have matches?
- Yes.

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,010
Please give it to me.
Thank you.

56
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,180
- Then you've cigarettes, too?
- Yes.

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,300
- Very good.
- Sir, but this is wet. Look.

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,320
Thank you.

59
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,110
Very good.

60
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,190
Here's your pack.

61
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,930
- Brother, never cheat anyone.
- Never, brother.

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,450
Never cheat anyone.

63
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,600
Now where should we go?
To that same old house?

64
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,190
Where else can we go?

65
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,530
First we have to think about it.

66
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,820
It's your duty to think
and my duty to work on it.

67
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,230
- Very good.
- Hey, Mohanlal Sohanlal and Company.

68
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,380
You gentlemen didn't recognize me
while celebrating your freedom.

69
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,700
Oh, very good.

70
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,350
Your old friend.

71
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,050
Police lnspector Hukumatrai.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,630
- Good morning, sir.
- What do you wish to do now?

73
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,220
Will you become good men or
I'll still have to follow you?

74
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,160
No, lnspector,
we won't break the law again.

75
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,570
You stupid.

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,030
You guys are honest.

77
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,560
It's just your way of living is wrong.

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,220
Okay.

79
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,200
- Good bye.
- Very good.

80
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,030
But remember...

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,500
the arms of the law are very long.

82
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,440
But we'll always stay close.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,100
Friend, I think our innocence
is going to bear fruit.

84
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,510
And even the English taught
us that honesty is the best policy.

85
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,960
- But how will we survive?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

86
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,920
There's only one way.

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,790
We'll again beg before
Seth Ram Dass.

88
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,526
Again ask Seth Ram Dass?

89
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,266
We've already taken
so much money from him.

90
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,460
This will be our last try, or as
we say in English, last but one.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,270
- Very good.
- Then let's go.

92
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,230
Excuse me.

93
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,980
I was thinking abut God.

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,710
Is Mr. Ram Dass inside?

95
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,830
Yes, he's inside.
What is your business?

96
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,180
I've come here for the job.

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,690
Don't enter at the front.
We'll go in through the back.

98
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,500
Hurry up.

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,390
What's your name?

100
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,500
Meena.

101
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,240
Go inside.

102
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,010
Greetings, sir.

103
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,810
My name is Meena.

104
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,890
You called me for 10 AM.

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,100
I applied for the job.

106
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,240
I don't know how to type.

107
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,860
I'll learn if you give me a chance.

108
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,660
I'm helpless.

109
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,360
If you'll help me,
then God will reward you.

110
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,870
Sir, why aren't you speaking?

111
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,970
At least answer me.

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,720
- Look.
- Sir.

113
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
Is something wrong, sir?

114
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,580
Have you got any problems?

115
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,370
Sir.

116
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,990
What happened? Sir.

117
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,650
What happened to him?

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,320
Seth has been murdered.

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,920
Go and search for the murderer.

120
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,820
Let's run or else we'll
be blamed for this murder.

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,360
- Where is that girl?
- She murdered our Seth. Catch her.

122
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
Catch her. Catch her.

123
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,240
This is her purse.

124
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,220
They're coming to get you.
Come and hide with us.

125
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,770
Come fast.

126
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,180
Catch her. Catch her.

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,800
Catch her. Call the police.

128
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,720
She must've gone there. Come.

129
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm innocent.

130
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,050
I swear to God, I'm innocent.

131
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,959
We believe you.

132
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,570
But the police won't believe you.

133
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,719
Please save me.

134
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,639
Only you people can
save this helpless girl.

135
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,250
We'll have to help her, Mohanbabu.

136
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,410
Do you wish to get hanged?

137
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,130
At least listen to me.

138
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,880
I'll explain it to him. Come with me.

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,550
What are your plans, my friend?

140
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,320
The girl seems
to be from a rich family.

141
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,790
If she becomes our friend
it'll be our good luck.

142
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,280
But will she help us?

143
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,590
We'll not let her know at all.

144
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,310
We'll behave according to her ways.

145
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,270
I've decided on a plan.

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,130
- Come.
- Very good.

147
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,300
It took me long to convince him.

148
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,550
Sister, you come with us.
We'll save you.

149
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,550
But how?

150
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,020
I think until they find
the actual murderer...

151
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,710
you should stay hidden.

152
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,910
- But how?
- That's our responsibility.

153
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,500
From today you're our sister
and we're your brothers.

154
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,390
Can you see that wall over there?

155
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,480
Hop over the wall.
Come. Hurry up.

156
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,850
The road's empty.

157
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,050
Very good. Now leave.

158
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,950
Come on.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,390
This was our story, sister.

160
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,930
Just imagine...

161
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,330
due to loss in the business
we've become this poor or else...

162
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,240
even we used to
stay in a big bungalow.

163
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,600
- Right, Mr. Mohan?
- Very good.

164
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,530
Now the place where we
stayed for the last six months...

165
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,050
had bigger and tougher
doors than the jail.

166
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,860
Anybody would have
mistaken it for a jail.

167
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,520
Okay, now tell us something
about yourself, Meena.

168
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,590
Who are you? Where have you
come from? And where's your house?

169
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,770
I don't have any house, brother.

170
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,790
I'm a helpless girl...

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,070
with no house to stay in.

172
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,900
But once even I had a house...

173
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,640
and that wasn't any ordinary house.

174
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,180
A long time ago...

175
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,020
when I was an eight year old girl...

176
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,480
We used to stay at Poyta.

177
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,110
Meena daughter, come here.

178
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,470
Cut this cake and
distribute it among your friends.

179
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,450
Call your father, too. Come dear.

180
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
Cut the cake, daughter.

181
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,880
Blow out the candles, daughter.

182
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,270
Very good. Very good.
Let's cut the cake now.

183
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,140
Should I distribute it
among your friends?

184
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Come everyone. Come quickly.

185
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,380
Take it. Take it.

186
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
That's my story up until now.

187
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,660
And you know all that happened today.

188
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,110
It was destined that I
be blamed as a murderer, too.

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,500
Now I'm surviving just because of you.

190
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,596
What happened to you?

191
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,550
Who wouldn't cry after
listening to such a sad story?

192
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,850
You're right, my friend.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,030
Even I have shed tears.

194
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,090
Today's newspaper.
Today's breaking news.

195
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,690
Today's newspaper.

196
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,450
Read the breaking news.

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,770
A young lady murdered a man.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,130
And she ran away.
This is the breaking news.

199
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,770
- Hot news.
- Newspaper?
- Yes, sir.

200
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,180
Give me one hot newspaper.

201
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,560
Take this. Give me money.

202
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,190
What? I am your regular customer.

203
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,480
What?

204
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,760
Seth Ram Dass found
murdered in his office at 10 AM today.

205
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,480
A young lady had come to
meet him just prior to the murder.

206
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,380
Servant's statement: The lady
ran away as soon as she saw him.

207
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,230
Her purse was left at Seth's table...

208
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,270
which is with the police now.

209
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,310
The police are searching
for the girl.

210
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,670
Now what will happen?

211
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,930
Think fast or else I'll get caught.

212
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,180
We'll get caught.

213
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,180
We won't be caught but she'll be.

214
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
- Very good.
- Wait.

215
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,810
Give me time to think it over.

216
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,870
- I've thought about it.
- Good.

217
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,390
Ms. Meena...

218
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,000
From today you're Queen Champatpur
and we're your secretaries.

219
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,156
What do you mean?

220
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,150
That means you'll have to
disguise yourself as a queen and...

221
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,820
we'll disguise ourselves
as your secretaries.

222
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,030
Who's going to recognize us?

223
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,710
This plan isn't bad, Mr. Sohan.

224
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,010
But how can we disguise ourselves?

225
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,180
Do you know where
we'll get the costumes?

226
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,250
Why should I always think?
Why can't you think?

227
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,160
Okay. Then I'll think this time.

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,870
We'll sell Meena's ornaments
and buy clothes for us.

229
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,220
Okay, Meena?

230
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,000
But this is an imitation.

231
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,790
And what about your necklace?

232
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,600
No.

233
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,340
I wear this is in
the memory of my mother.

234
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,190
I can't bear to part with it

235
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,546
Think about it. On one side
is the memory of your mother...

236
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,116
and on the other side
the mark after you're hanged.

237
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,600
- It hurts a lot when you're hanged.
- So much pain.

238
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,840
But how can I sell this?

239
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,140
I'll tell you how.

240
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,180
We'll pawn it and not sell it.
We'll buy it back later.

241
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,570
Very good.

242
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,350
But will you guarantee...

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,790
- that I'll get it back.
- I'll give you something else.

244
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,970
- Right, Mr. Mohan?
- Very good, Mr. Sohan.

245
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
Give it to me.

246
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,110
Greetings.

247
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,570
Manager, this is Queen Champatpur.

248
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,156
As soon as I got
the news of your arrival...

249
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,096
I've reserved the most
luxurious room in this hotel.

250
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,590
Very good. Very good.

251
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,870
We're very lucky to
have you here, sarkar (ma'am ).

252
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,630
Sarkar (English people)?
You have English people here?

253
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,160
She meant that...

254
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,140
if you've any other
Kings or Queens staying here.

255
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,960
Not until now.

256
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,580
Right now you're the only sarkar here.

257
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,380
- Me, a sarkar?
- Yes, you're a sarkar.

258
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,750
Like you are government.

259
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,080
Yes, I'm sarkar.

260
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,270
Even we're lucky to be here, Manager.

261
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,830
This is your modesty.

262
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,820
Your speech is so sweet and clean...

263
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,020
compared to other queens.

264
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,810
That is because I
clean my tongue everyday.

265
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,540
Did you see this Manager?
This is called a sense of humor.

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Very good sense of humor.

267
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,990
It's in fact very, very good.

268
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,510
I've never seen
a better sense of humor.

269
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,060
Please come with me.
I'll show you your room.

270
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,780
Walk proudly.

271
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,680
We've to work very hard
while working for our queen.

272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,670
- Luggage.
- Bring the luggage inside.

273
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,960
Put it there.

274
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,280
Come on. Hurry up.
Put it there.

275
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,870
Sir, your luggage looks very new.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,940
Even we're new people.

277
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,796
- Sir, what happened?
- Nothing.

278
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,996
Mosquitoes bit me.

279
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,060
Even these Indian mosquitoes
are so much over here.

280
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,820
Sir, a brick fell out
of your suitcase.

281
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,990
Did it break?

282
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,490
This is a brick
from the queen's old castle.

283
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,920
It's even older than the Mahabharata.

284
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,990
The Ajayab house has
ordered these bricks.

285
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,940
Each brick costs
approximately 1000 rupees.

286
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,630
- 1000?
- Even the castle is 1000 years old.

287
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,880
What should we say about the castles?

288
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,040
Please permit me to leave, sir.

289
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,159
Please ask for me
if you need anything.

290
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,349
Listen, I just remembered something.

291
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,320
I need to cash a check.

292
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,189
- My account hasn't been approved yet.
- No problem.

293
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,370
- Take it whenever you feel like.
- Thanks.

294
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,110
Listen, please send our food here.

295
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,780
Sir, I was thinking that...

296
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,929
if you could come down today...

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,000
- we have a special program during lunch.
- Very good.

298
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,210
Please close the door.

299
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,520
Thank God in Hindi.

300
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,450
We're saved this time.

301
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,610
It's good they never opened
the other suitcases...

302
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,490
or else they would have found
nothing but bricks from the castle.

303
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,030
- Think about lunch.
- Very good.

304
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,630
Today's program begins...

305
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,770
with the Emperor of Magic,
Gopiya Pasha...

306
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,650
and his talking puppet Fateh Khan.

307
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,340
Gopiya Pasha.

308
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,140
Gilli Gilli Gilli Gilli Gilli

309
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,680
Gilli Gilli Gilli Gilli Gilli

310
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,340
Gilli Gilli is not your name.
Your name is Fateh Khan.

311
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,880
Fateh Khan. Fateh Khan.

312
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,280
Tell me Fateh Khan.

313
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,780
How are you?

314
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,610
I'm not fine.

315
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,750
You're not fine?

316
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,740
Haven't you got any place to live?

317
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,700
These days you find
God but no place to live.

318
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,610
So how are your wives?

319
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,390
One died and the other two
have promised to die soon.

320
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,560
- The other two promised?
- Yes, the other two promised.

321
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,050
Are you going to marry again?

322
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,320
Marriage? Marriage?
But where is the girl?

323
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,090
There are so many girls here.
Select anyone you like.

324
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,120
But I like this girl in the black dress.

325
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,850
She isn't a girl.

326
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,820
If it's not a girl, then is it a boy?

327
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,810
- She's a queen.
- Queen?

328
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,520
Isn't a queen a girl?

329
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,720
So, do you attend school?

330
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,340
Yes, I go to school.

331
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,086
For how many years
have you gone to school?

332
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,250
Six years.

333
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,100
You must've passed
six grades in six years.

334
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,860
Yes. I've cleared six years
on one question.

335
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,030
How are you in mathematics?

336
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,330
Really good.

337
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,830
Imagine that you have...

338
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,230
a dozen of sugar, a dozen of ghee,
and a dozen of wheat.

339
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,920
- Then what do you get?
- Ladoo (a sweet).

340
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,770
Tell me, how did you do
on your math test?

341
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,390
I got one question wrong.

342
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,670
One wrong answer.

343
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,340
- How many questions were there?
- Ten.

344
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,320
You got the other nine right?

345
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,970
I didn't answer them at all.

346
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,490
Very good. Very good.

347
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,280
Fateh Khan.

348
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,690
Ma'am, now you'll hear a song
from Ms. Kirana.

349
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,410
The song is 'My brother Tingu
has come from Delhi'.

350
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,510
My brother, Tingu,
has come from Delhi

351
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,250
Tingu's brother is Pingu,
and his brother is Shingu

352
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,520
Tingu was very slim

353
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,180
And Pingu was very small

354
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,690
And Shingu was very fat

355
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,350
All three were the best of friends

356
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,970
Washerman, tailor and blacksmith

357
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,700
They were only good at talking

358
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,140
My brother, Tingu,
has come from Delhi

359
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,680
All three got onto the road...

360
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,550
and walked very stylishly

361
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,370
God, they walked tapping their legs

362
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,750
They walked very
stylishly tapping their legs

363
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,110
They walked hand in hand...

364
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,300
and lived together

365
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,040
And they used to sing that...

366
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,510
'Hindustan is ours...'

367
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,470
'and it is different
from all other countries'

368
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,380
'Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christian...'

369
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,280
'considered her
the star of their eyes'

370
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,890
My brother, Tingu,
has come from Delhi

371
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,540
Tingu's brother is Pingu
and his brother is Shingu

372
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,660
My brother, Tingu,
has come from Delhi

373
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,020
Very good. Very good.

374
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,490
So, how are you Mohan Sohan and Company?

375
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,160
- You?
- What happened?

376
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,460
Nothing. He's our old friend.

377
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,880
Wait, we'll be back soon.

378
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,810
Sir, it's a pleasure to see you again.

379
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,870
Good. Mr. Mohan and Sohan.

380
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,540
It's difficult to
recognize you in this dress.

381
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,340
There's so much difference
between the jail dress and this dress.

382
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,010
Who is she?

383
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,760
She's our Queen Champatpur.

384
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,460
We've become her servants.

385
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,150
Good. Good.

386
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,720
So these days you get
to work with the foreigners?

387
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,160
Yes. What else could we do?

388
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,230
We make more money working for them.

389
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,420
But remember one thing.

390
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,580
Don't forget the law
while you're with them.

391
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,960
Poor thing, it misses you a lot.

392
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,900
Don't worry, sir. We love our law.

393
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,830
- Right, Mr. Mohan?
- Very good, Mr. Sohan.

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,160
Okay, keep this in mind.

395
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,210
God save us.

396
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,240
- Who was this friend?
- He's my best friend.

397
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,180
That poor guy was a refugee.

398
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,120
He asked us to talk to you and...

399
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,750
help him get a job.

400
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,580
You go to your room.
We'll return after seeing the Manager.

401
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,830
Excuse me. Where is the Manager?

402
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,060
He'll be coming here
very soon. Please wait.

403
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,640
Come here Manager.

404
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,530
How's everything?

405
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,330
Please come here.

406
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,240
Thank you. Please order.
How may I help you?

407
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,010
Please help us out with 2000 rupees.

408
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,760
We need to withdraw
2000 rupees using this check.

409
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,250
Please give it to me.

410
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,510
Thank you.

411
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,120
- Who's at the door?
- May I come in? - Yes. Come in.

412
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,410
Yes. How may I help you?

413
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,340
I have come here to
meet you for a reason.

414
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes. I know that reason.

415
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,720
But I'm sorry because I can't help you.

416
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,380
Help?

417
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,380
Yes. I can't give you any job here.

418
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,790
But listen to me.

419
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,140
My secretary did
speak about your request.

420
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,790
But I'm helpless.

421
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,260
I can't give you any job.

422
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,600
Job for me?

423
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,470
Oh, I understand.

424
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,030
You've been fooled.

425
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,150
I want to save you from the
two famous criminals in this city.

426
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,580
- Who are these criminals?
- Your secretaries.

427
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,990
Mr. Mohan and Sohan.
I'm the undercover agent.

428
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,850
Police inspector?

429
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,320
Yes.

430
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,920
And these Mohan and Sohan...

431
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,880
are the most wanted
criminals in this city.

432
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,860
What are you saying?

433
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,770
They're innocent people.

434
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,890
Yes. If they're
innocent then I must be bad.

435
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,700
Look at this picture.

436
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,800
It is the evidence
proving their 'innocence'.

437
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,870
This a picture of them in jail.

438
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,990
They've been released recently.

439
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,310
- This is true?
- Yes.

440
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,910
They're really criminals.

441
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,220
I follow them as their shadows.

442
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,376
But they're so cunning that...

443
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,020
they make people into fools.

444
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,760
You better stay away from them
or else you'll regret it.

445
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,660
Thank you.

446
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,820
You've saved me in time.

447
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,810
I just did my duty.

448
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,290
Okay, greetings.

449
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,090
Take this 1000 rupees.

450
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,780
The remaining 1000 rupees
I'll deliver to your room.

451
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,730
- Thank you.
- Get 1000 rupees from the safe.

452
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,670
My share? 50-50.

453
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,870
Be careful what you say.

454
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,340
You'll get it.

455
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,110
I've heard this many times.
Give me my share.

456
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,070
Okay, take it.

457
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,840
We'll split 50-50 right now.

458
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,010
Take this. One for you...

459
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,320
- and one for me. Okay?
- One.

460
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,570
Two for you...

461
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,260
- and two for me. Okay?
- Okay.

462
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
Three for you...

463
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,790
and three for me. Okay?

464
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,340
Four for you...

465
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,870
and four for me. Okay?

466
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,860
Five for you...

467
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,810
and five for me. Okay?

468
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,540
Enough. The rest we'll divide later.

469
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,230
Where is the queen?

470
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,410
- She must be relaxing in her room.
- Very good.

471
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,200
Queen Champatpur.

472
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,810
Did she run away?

473
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,830
This dress.

474
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,950
Look she's running away. Meena.

475
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,140
Mr. Mohan? Mr. Sohan?

476
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,510
- Manager.
- Very good. Let's run away.

477
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Wait.

478
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,790
After you.
We have to follow Meena.

479
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,670
Sir.

480
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,580
This luggage.

481
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,710
Sir, they must've gotten out
by the balcony.

482
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Sir.

483
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,216
They're so good at heart.

484
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,236
They skipped the main entrance
and got down using the balcony.

485
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,730
- They're running away, Manager.
- Running away?

486
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,900
Why are you running, sir?

487
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,500
Get lost, you idiot.

488
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,280
Idiot. They're actually running.

489
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,970
At least they left me the
bricks from the Mahabharata.

490
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,410
What Mahabharata?
These aren't even made of clay, sir.

491
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,820
I'm ruined.

492
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,950
- She must've gone there.
- Yes. Come.

493
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,450
Come here. Come here.
The play's going to start very soon.

494
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,880
Live dance and songs.

495
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,410
She went inside.

496
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,800
- Where?
- Here.

497
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,450
Tickets only for four annas.

498
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,370
But eight annas for ladies.

499
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,130
- Did any girl go inside?
- Yes. She's with her.

500
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,690
Then get her a ticket too.

501
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,550
- Start the play.
- Start the play. We've paid for it.

502
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,880
Live dance and songs.

503
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,090
- Meena. - Meena.
- Meena. - Catch her.

504
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,350
Don't make noise and sit here quietly.

505
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,540
- That girl...
- Yes, everyone is here.

506
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,330
Sit down. Come on. Sit down.

507
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,790
The play is going
to start now. Look ahead.

508
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,330
A tall wife is big trouble

509
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,920
She never sees the time

510
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,740
Always she pretends
with the naughty thoughts

511
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,410
Yes, I am lost

512
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,670
You have taken
control of my heart

513
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,870
Yes, I am lost

514
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,790
You are short, but you
fight with me all the time

515
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,020
I am unfortunate

516
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,120
I have accepted you

517
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,730
Yes, I am lost

518
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,770
I have lost your love

519
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,660
I have accepted this
proposal with my knowledge

520
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,260
Yes, I am lost

521
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,920
My wife is tall.
She looks like a tower

522
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,490
I don't understand

523
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,970
Okay, I will make you understand

524
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,530
My wife is tall.
She looks like a tower

525
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,600
She needs three meters
of material for her dress

526
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,670
Even though her dress is short

527
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,070
Yes, I am lost

528
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,930
You have taken
control of my heart

529
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes, I am lost

530
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,580
Always she pretends
with the naughty thoughts

531
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,950
Yes, I am lost

532
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,320
You are short
but your words are rude

533
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,040
If it were up to me...

534
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,640
- I would have taught you a lesson.
- Really?

535
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,480
Yes, I am lost

536
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,420
I have lost your love

537
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,520
Yes, I am lost

538
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,139
I have accepted this
proposal with my knowledge

539
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,726
Great performance.

540
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,850
Once more.

541
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,989
- First class.
- Meena.

542
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,720
- Meena.
- Meena.

543
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,910
Catch her. Catch her.

544
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,040
I got saved.

545
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,540
Oh Meena.

546
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,670
Meena.

547
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,250
She went inside.

548
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,860
- Good afternoon. What do you want?
- Good afternoon.

549
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,500
- We want a hat.
- Yes. Hat.

550
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,860
- What type of hat?
- For our mistress.

551
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,220
- Look at this one.
- What for the mistress?

552
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,730
Yes. Yes.

553
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,260
Very good hat.

554
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,230
You continue with your work.
We'll choose it on our own.

555
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,740
Thank you. I'll return soon.

556
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,600
- She came here.
- Where?

557
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,980
I saw her with my own eyes.
She came here.

558
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,550
Oh you blind man.
And your name is Nainsukh.

559
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,630
We would have seen
her by now if she was here.

560
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,600
You're wasting time
for no reason. Let's leave.

561
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,100
- She came here.
- No, she didn't.

562
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,990
What is it?

563
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,316
- What is it?
- Did you see this mannequin?

564
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,406
What? This?

565
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,780
First she was looking here
and now she's looking there.

566
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,030
Stupid, haven't you ever seen
a doll rolling its eyes?

567
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,890
This is the same thing.
Its eyes roll in all directions.

568
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,690
- How?
- Now look it'll look up.

569
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,600
Did you see? Now down.

570
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,580
Look there. Now here.

571
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,640
- This keeps on rolling.
- Very good machine.

572
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,630
Up. Down.

573
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,340
- Up. Down. Up. Down. Up.
- Let's leave.

574
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,250
Meena.

575
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,540
What are you doing?
You'll break it. Are you crazy?

576
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,370
- Look Meena. Catch her.
- We'll call the police.

577
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,420
She came here.

578
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,930
This motor man created a mess
or else we would have caught her.

579
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,210
You're late.

580
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,980
- Late? Me?
- Yes.

581
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,246
Sir's been waiting for you
for quite some time.

582
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,480
- Waiting for me?
- Yes, waiting for you.

583
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,340
Come in.

584
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,340
The new secretary has arrived, sir.

585
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,420
You've just arrived?

586
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,770
You'd been asked to come at 10.

587
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,260
- 10 AM?
- Yes. Anyway, sit down.

588
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,060
I'll inform our sir.

589
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,590
Please sit down.

590
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,120
Sir, that girl has come
for the secretary job.

591
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,740
She came? Thank God.

592
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,326
It would have been impossible
for me to wok without a secretary.

593
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,130
I'll hire her and give her desired salary.

594
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,616
Nowadays it's difficult to find
a house, servant and secretary.

595
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,850
Send her in.

596
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,090
Yes, sir.

597
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,590
Where are you going?

598
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,560
- I'm...
- Sir wants to see you.

599
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,400
- Sir? Which sir?
- Manager, who else?

600
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,170
Please go in.

601
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,720
Come in. Come in.

602
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,210
I've been waiting for you.

603
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,080
- For me?
- Yes, you.

604
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Come here.

605
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,220
Come a little closer.

606
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,806
- What is your name?
- My name is Meena.

607
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,640
Meena? It sounds like
the name of a movie star.

608
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,140
Sit down.

609
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,340
- Me?
- Don't worry, you'll get a good salary.

610
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,870
- Do you know shorthand?
- Shorthand?

611
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,530
Hello? Vimla?

612
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,580
When did you come? How are you?

613
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,620
How am I? All because of your favor...

614
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,250
It's been a week and
you haven't even asked about me.

615
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,190
I'm your fiancé now.

616
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,060
It seems you might disappear
for months after our marriage.

617
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,890
Vimla, I'm sorry.

618
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,200
Please sit down.

619
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,330
Because I didn't have any secretary...

620
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,210
I had loads of work this week.

621
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,370
That means work is more
important to you than I am.

622
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm working for you only.

623
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,520
How can I marry you if I
don't make your father happy?

624
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,190
It's not that easy to marry
the daughter of your company's owner.

625
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,130
But to marry your
company owner's daughter...

626
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,090
isn't the worst thing, either.

627
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,890
Well, forget about that.
When are you coming to see me?

628
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,460
Today.

629
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,540
My friend has sent me a secretary.

630
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,540
She's sitting in front of me.

631
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,700
Now I'll be free.

632
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,850
- Oh. Is she attractive?
- Let me see.

633
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,110
- She's okay.
- Then please keep her.

634
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,280
Your name shouldn't
have been Vimla but Jealousy.

635
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,600
Okay, then I'll see you this evening.

636
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,780
Okay.

637
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,710
But I can't wait that long.

638
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,840
I'll come to your office now.

639
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,740
We'll go for a ride, okay?

640
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,360
No Vimla, I'm busy now.

641
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,030
It's also your duty to take your
company owner's daughter for a ride.

642
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,090
Manager, I'm coming now.

643
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,530
Daughter?

644
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,296
To whom are you speaking?

645
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,060
Father, I'm talking to him.

646
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,360
Him?

647
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,550
Oh, I see. That means Ranjit?

648
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,360
Wait.

649
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,850
I want to talk to him, too.

650
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,830
- Listen darling.
- Darling?

651
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,910
Ranjit, this is me.

652
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm Rai Saab Shankar Dass.

653
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,320
Oh Rai Saab. I'm sorry. I thought that...

654
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,760
Did you send the tender
to the company in Delhi?

655
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes. I've sent it.

656
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,590
But I heard that there are
many businessmen behind this contract.

657
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,000
We must get that
contract by any means.

658
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm trying my best.

659
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,700
When will you
start coming to the office?

660
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,840
The doctor has asked me
to take rest for some days.

661
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,240
Are you scared of the work?

662
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,250
Anyhow, you're
supposed to handle the office...

663
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,750
after your marriage with Vimla.

664
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,820
Because I've become old.

665
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,750
Yes. Okay. Greetings.

666
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,520
So your name is Meena.

667
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,000
You begin work immediately.

668
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,400
We'll give you 200
rupees as salary every month.

669
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,510
Two hundred?

670
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,640
But...

671
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,140
No ifs and buts. Sit down.

672
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,380
I can understand things
are costly these days.

673
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,200
I'll give you 25
rupees as allowance, too.

674
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,640
But sir...

675
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,120
Again that same ifs and buts.

676
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,206
I'll increment your salary to
250 rupees after seeing your work.

677
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,560
Now are you happy?

678
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,130
Take this paper and pencil.

679
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,930
Write a letter in shorthand.

680
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,830
- Tell me.
- Write.

681
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,760
Seth Shyam Sunder.

682
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,050
No. 5, Qutub Road, New Delhi.

683
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,400
Dictate slowly.

684
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,600
I haven't practiced shorthand much.

685
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,550
Not a problem.

686
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,860
Write. No. 5, Qutub Road, New Delhi.

687
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,370
Greetings.

688
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,580
I didn't greet you.

689
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,650
Write my greetings for Mr. Seth.

690
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,250
I received your telegram.

691
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,790
To hold the discussions
on the contract...

692
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,530
we're sending our men to Delhi.

693
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,240
Did you write? Just read
whatever you've written.

694
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,210
Greetings.

695
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,700
I've got your telegram.

696
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,550
And then...

697
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,160
Read whatever you've written.

698
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,550
In order to discuss
regarding the contract our men...

699
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,150
we're sending our men to Delhi
in order to discuss regarding the contract.

700
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,460
You write really good in shorthand.

701
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,316
Now start typing this.

702
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,530
Sir, type?

703
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,370
It's there. Go.

704
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,370
Hello Mr. Manager.

705
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,720
Don't work so hard.

706
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,130
Don't make Dalmia
and Birla feel jealous.

707
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,520
You arrived quickly, Ms. Vimla.

708
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,950
Sit down.

709
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,560
- Who's she?
- She's my new secretary, Ms. Meena.

710
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,340
Oh.

711
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,580
So she's your new secretary.

712
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,810
She's good. It seems
you've chosen her from many.

713
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,910
- You've worked at another place before?
- Yes, ma'am.

714
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,800
At the office of Popatlal Topanmal.

715
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,470
- And you were fired from there?
- No.

716
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,370
I resigned my job there.

717
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,830
You seem to be very experienced.

718
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,410
Why don't you have her desk outside?

719
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,620
The room seems to be cramped.

720
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,140
And you can sit
outside very comfortably.

721
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,320
Ms. Meena, this is my fiancé, Ms. Vimla.

722
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,720
She's the daughter of my boss.
That's why she speaks in this manner.

723
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,590
Now shall we leave, Mr. Lecturer?

724
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,990
Yes. Listen type this
letter and self attest it.

725
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,980
And this is the key.
Come early in the morning...

726
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,840
- and finish the paperwork.
- Okay.

727
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,440
Do concentrate on your work, okay?

728
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,980
Do concentrate on your work.

729
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,610
Mr. Manager.

730
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,150
You act very well.

731
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,320
Are you the new secretary?

732
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,360
Don't be scared. We'll support you.

733
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,460
This Ms. Vimla is really something.

734
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,430
Mr. Ranjit.

735
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,090
If you want to keep your job...

736
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,310
you'd better stay out of trouble.

737
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,380
- Why?
- Ask Vimla about that.

738
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,890
You won't have any complaints
after the marriage.

739
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,700
It's difficult to get you
under control before marriage.

740
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,230
I was never so free
that you need to control me.

741
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,100
I'm not only your servant but
also the servant of your father.

742
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,080
- This place isn't bad.
- This place is very beautiful.

743
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,820
I wish I could come here everyday.

744
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,740
Can we come here tomorrow?

745
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,050
Not tomorrow.
I've important business tomorrow.

746
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,900
Come for a little while for my sake.

747
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,390
Tomorrow is impossible.

748
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:21,360
The night is so beautiful

749
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:29,150
Love has blossomed

750
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:35,440
What if he comes here?

751
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,640
Ask him to come for a moment

752
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,730
Please come and
control the feelings of my heart

753
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:05,980
Ask him to come for a moment

754
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,780
I have started trusting your love

755
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:34,850
Take the oath of love

756
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,790
Ask him to come for a moment

757
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:03,160
Why are you allowing
my heart to suffer?

758
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:18,850
Why do you come in my dreams?

759
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,840
Ask him to come for a moment

760
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,240
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

761
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,870
- Did Ms. Meena come?
- I didn't see her arrive.

762
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,290
What is this?

763
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,890
Ms. Meena.

764
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,290
Ms. Meena. Ms. Meena.

765
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,680
Is it morning now?

766
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,120
- Sir, you?
- Yes. It's I.

767
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,016
What's meaning of all this?
Why are you sleeping on the table?

768
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,610
Where else could I sleep?

769
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,390
- There's no bed in here.
- Bed?

770
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,430
Which office provides you with a bed?

771
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,336
It's okay. I had a good sleep.

772
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,556
Had a good sleep.

773
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,986
What type of girl are you?

774
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,316
I don't think you can work here.

775
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,256
Do you think those who
sleep on a table can't work?

776
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,690
Don't contradict me.
What type of secretary are you?

777
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,970
I'm really good. But if you
don't like me I'll leave.

778
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,910
When did I say that?

779
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,050
I was asking why you slept here.

780
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,650
Why didn't you go home yesterday?

781
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,590
How could I've gone home?
I worked very late.

782
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,560
If that's the reason,
then why not say that earlier?

783
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,120
Okay then, get down off the table.
Come on.

784
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,120
I mean, what's going on here?

785
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,600
I mean who is she?

786
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,810
She's my new secretary.

787
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,660
I mean, what's she doing on the table?

788
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,340
Actually Mr. Rai Saab,
she worked all night...

789
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,650
so she slept here.

790
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,880
- Rai Saab? The company owner?
- Yes.

791
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,040
The company owner. Good morning.

792
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,170
Greetings.

793
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,410
I'm sorry. I'll go and...

794
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,420
She's a weird girl.

795
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,950
Yes. She's a weird girl.

796
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,230
Please sit down.

797
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,100
I was thinking that...

798
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,380
This is so stupid.

799
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,080
I'm sorry, sir.

800
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,190
So, I was saying that...

801
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,010
you and Vimla
should get married very soon.

802
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,970
But what is with the business in Delhi?

803
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,110
Sir, I've written to
Mr. Seth Shyam Sunder that...

804
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,820
we're sending our men to Delhi.

805
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,150
Please sit down.

806
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,330
I feel that you yourself
should go to Delhi.

807
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,530
And you should leave today.

808
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,050
I mean, it'll be great
if we get that contract soon.

809
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,920
As you wish. I'll leave for Delhi today.

810
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,390
I'll prepare things
for the marriage by then.

811
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,070
Alright?

812
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,770
Then I'll leave now.

813
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,310
- Will you come?
- Yes, I'll come there very soon.

814
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,410
Secretary ma'am.

815
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,146
The next time you feel like sleeping,
please don't use the desk.

816
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,620
- I mean...
- No. Sir.

817
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,910
Meena, reserve two tickets
for this evening to Delhi.

818
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,260
One for you, one for me.

819
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,160
Send a telegram to some hotel there...

820
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,290
and reserve two separate rooms for us.

821
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,790
- I'm to come with you to Delhi?
- Definitely.

822
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,576
And don't forget to send the telegram...

823
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,040
or else we'll have no place to stay.

824
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,970
Sir, then please give me leave today...

825
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,640
so that I can prepare for the journey.

826
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,060
We're going to Delhi, not abroad.

827
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,550
Today you're responsible for the office.

828
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,290
I have to go and see Vimla.

829
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,240
Sir, will you give me some money?

830
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:01,920
Why money?

831
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,890
An advance,
so I can buy some clothes.

832
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,346
What's wrong with this dress?

833
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,836
You've just started and already an advance?

834
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,460
- We'll think about it in Delhi.
- You always keep objecting.

835
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,030
- Laara-lappa?
- Yes, addi-tappa.

836
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,800
What language is
addi-tappa and laara-lappa?

837
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,236
Punjabi.

838
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,300
Laara-lappa means the
one who objects every time.

839
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,240
And addi-tappi?

840
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,040
Addi-tappi means
arguing for no reason.

841
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,490
Think whatever you like
but you won't get any advance.

842
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,310
We'll think about it later.

843
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,320
To meet Vimla.

844
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,820
And when I ask for money...

845
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:46,280
Nothing but false promises,
nothing but empty excuses

846
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,610
Making empty promises

847
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,820
His ways are amazing

848
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,150
His heart as well
as his pockets are empty

849
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,660
But for all that,
he's still so arrogant

850
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,010
I just don't understand

851
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,400
I asked for money from him

852
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,530
"What money", he replied?

853
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,950
Scorn material things.
Love is all that counts

854
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:39,150
"Love is all that counts",
as our elders have taught us

855
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:12,280
Nothing but false promises,
nothing but empty excuses

856
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,330
Making empty promises

857
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,100
The gentlemen of today...

858
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:25,140
The gentlemen of today
are always restless

859
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,670
Empty pockets and roving eyes

860
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,550
They don't do a scrap of work

861
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,750
But for all that,
they're still so arrogant

862
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,820
I just don't understand

863
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,200
The women of today...

864
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:12,670
The women of today
are a constant headache...

865
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,840
ever ready to pick a fight with men

866
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:29,500
Good for nothings
and just want to dress up

867
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,090
Making empty promises

868
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,060
Making empty promises

869
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,500
Why worry, mister?

870
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,680
We'll do this, too

871
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:18,300
When the time comes,
we'll grab this chair

872
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:36,460
Nothing but false promises,
nothing but empty excuses

873
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,950
Go in and get the status of our rooms.

874
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,650
I'll pay the cabbie and be right in.

875
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,470
- How much is it, sardarji?
- Nine rupees, sir.

876
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,210
Take this hundred rupees.

877
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:11,930
Ms. Merry-go-round,
will you stop circling and get in.

878
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,240
Is this a door or a
strange merry-go-round?

879
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,420
Gentlemen, there are no
vacant rooms in this hotel.

880
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,200
Only those who
have reservations may stay...

881
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,810
but the rest must leave.

882
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:29,800
We checked all the hotels
but didn't find a room anywhere.

883
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,070
Sir, I feel sorry for you,
but I've no vacant room here.

884
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,910
- What is your name, sir?
- Manohar.

885
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,410
Yes, sir.
Your room has been reserved.

886
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,220
Please sign here.

887
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,670
Room no. 20.

888
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,590
- Yes, madam.
- I sent a telegram to book rooms.

889
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,740
Mr. Ranjit and Miss Meena.

890
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,420
Mr. Ranjit.

891
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,870
Yes, your rooms have
been reserved for you.

892
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,980
Very good, Mr. Dharamchand.

893
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,530
How did we fool him.

894
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,110
That was the actual fun, my brother.

895
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,270
Hello, sir.

896
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,070
- Hello?
- Why have you come to Delhi?

897
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:13,180
- I'm the match company manager.
- Manager of the match stick company?

898
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,476
Sir, do you have a box of matches
to light a cigarette?

899
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,000
- Yes.
- Please give it to me.

900
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,010
- And if you've matches then you've cigarettes, too?
- Yes.

901
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,810
Sir, but this is wet.
Look. Thank you.

902
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,120
- How did this happen?
- Thank you.

903
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,140
- I don't need a room. - Why?
- Because I don't like this hotel.

904
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,660
Don't like the hotel? Great.

905
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,460
People have no place to stay
and she doesn't like the hotel.

906
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,730
Wait.

907
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,000
- They don't have rooms here.
- What do you mean?

908
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,380
- Didn't you send them a telegram?
- Yes, I did.

909
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,740
- But there's no vacant rooms here.
- No vacant rooms?

910
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,010
This is so unfair.

911
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,320
- I'll talk to the manager personally.
- Listen.

912
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,720
Why do we waste time here?
We'll try another place.

913
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,480
This is all because of you.
You're so irresponsible.

914
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,060
- What did I do?
- My head.

915
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,060
We searched for rooms everywhere
but didn't find a single one.

916
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,900
This is too much that the general manager
is roaming on the streets.

917
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,280
I'm tired. I'll relax for two minutes.

918
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,340
We'll have to relax on the benches.

919
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,890
Why two minutes?
You can rest for two days.

920
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,550
God knows what has
happened to the entire world.

921
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,410
There's not even a place to
hide your head in such a big city.

922
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,020
And this is all because of you.

923
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,550
Who knows whether you
sent the telegram or not.

924
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,470
You're shouting at me all day.

925
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,400
I'm not only shouting at you
but also at my fate.

926
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,870
You've put me in such a situation.
Now why are you crying?

927
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,210
Good. Continue crying. I'll sleep.

928
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,660
Oh my God.
Now what do we do?

929
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,720
We should take a shelter under the bench.

930
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,340
I'm a human and not an animal.

931
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,040
Okay, then get wet being a human.

932
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,610
I'm turning into animal.

933
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,210
I think I'll have to be an animal too.

934
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,540
Now I'm feeling much better.

935
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,940
Listen. I've to go and meet
Mr. Shyam Sunder Seth...

936
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,950
and your duty is
to find a room to live.

937
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,710
- But where will I find them?
- I don't know where you'll find them.

938
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,260
You should find us accommodations
before I return.

939
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,030
Even if you have to become
someone's servant.

940
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,690
And if you don't find it, then...

941
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,580
And listen, meet me at
this same place at 4 PM.

942
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,500
Servant needed.

943
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,990
Chirahash.

944
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:55,130
Room no. 5, Qutub Road, New Delhi.

945
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,380
Greetings, ma'am.

946
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:30,530
- Is this your bungalow?
- Yes.

947
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,520
Please come in. Please come in.

948
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:33,720
Please come in.

949
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:38,960
Please sit down.

950
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,940
It's good you came here
to meet us.

951
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,690
Because these days the neighbors
don't speak with each other.

952
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,370
Please have tea.

953
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:48,980
Please sit down.

954
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,260
Maybe you're staying
in the next bungalow.

955
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,490
No. I've come here for work.

956
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,170
- Take it. - No.
- Take it.

957
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,430
Tell me, what work did you have?

958
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,100
I've come here to work for you.

959
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:11,890
- Work for me?
- Yes. You advertised for a servant.

960
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,890
Oh yes. What canl tell you?

961
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,686
It's very difficult to
find a servant these days.

962
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,626
I've been searching for a servant
for the last two months

963
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,990
But I haven't found anyone.

964
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,390
They've all disappeared
because of the fight.

965
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,220
Can you provide me with a servant?

966
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,910
- Yes. I...
- If you'll provide me with a servant then...

967
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:30,090
we'll be very thankful to you.
We'll give her a decent salary.

968
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,030
That is fine.

969
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,770
But I have a wish.

970
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,880
Why not? We've a big house.
We'll give one room to the servant.

971
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,070
But the servant isn't one, but two.

972
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,390
A man and a woman.

973
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,350
Okay, wife and husband.
We've needed a couple.

974
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,250
A woman to cook food
and a man to serve it.

975
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,140
- But do they have kids?
- No.

976
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,100
Then they must've married recently.

977
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,450
That's why they ask more.

978
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,630
Where are these servants?
Please send them to me.

979
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,180
One is me and...

980
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
You?

981
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,270
You're a servant?

982
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,700
You're very fashionable.

983
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,160
Ma'am I may be fashionable...

984
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,940
but my condition is very bad.

985
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,410
More than that, please don't ask.

986
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:17,850
This is very strange.

987
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,010
I thought that...
Well, forget about it.

988
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,520
I don't bother.

989
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,890
I just need servants.

990
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,160
Okay. So where is your husband?

991
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,690
He's out looking for work..

992
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,020
We'll both come here this evening.

993
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,860
- I had a condition.
- Don't worry about the salary.

994
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,570
We'll provide you with enough money.

995
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,550
That's not it.

996
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,840
The fact is he's been working
with English people.

997
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,820
But the room must be comfortable.

998
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,740
We'll give him a first class room.

999
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,350
Only you must
meet me this evening.

1000
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,300
Okay, I'll come and meet you for sure.

1001
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,970
I have to tell you one more thing.

1002
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,380
Tell me.

1003
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:57,100
Actually, I mean my husband...

1004
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,150
is bit retarded.

1005
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,780
He's educated but...

1006
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,280
- sometimes he speaks nonsense.
- Not a problem.

1007
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,990
It's good that you told me.

1008
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,010
- What is your name.
- My name is Meena.

1009
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,960
And his name is Ranjit.

1010
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,860
Greetings ma'am.
We'll see you this evening.

1011
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,140
Shagufta, where is my cane?

1012
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,270
I can't do anymore without a servant.

1013
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,960
I can't find anything in the house.

1014
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:29,029
If that's not a cane in your hand,
then what is it?

1015
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,480
In my hand?

1016
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,230
It's in my hand.

1017
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,510
Good that I found it.
I'll leave for the office.

1018
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:36,129
Listen to me.

1019
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,880
I've found new servants.

1020
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,300
Not one but a couple

1021
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,510
She didn't look like a servant.
She looked like an English lady.

1022
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:45,629
They've worked with the English people.

1023
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,240
This is very good news.

1024
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,570
This time take care
they don't leave us.

1025
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,180
These days even servants
expect us to behave properly.

1026
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,419
And they're English. What more can I say?

1027
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,100
Why are you still sitting here?
Go to the office.

1028
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,770
I forgot to go the office.

1029
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,360
Don't forget to return
from the office someday.

1030
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,976
Is Shyam Sunder inside?

1031
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,281
No sir. He'll come in sometime.
Please wait in that queue.

1032
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,950
The queue is very long.

1033
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,640
Will I get a chance to meet him?

1034
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,480
Mr. Sachdev.

1035
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:28,856
Yes, Mr. Dharmchand.

1036
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,060
I think we should give
our place to this gentleman.

1037
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,520
Anyway, we don't need
to meet Mr. Seth urgently.

1038
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,210
Very good.

1039
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,460
Listen sir. Please sit here.

1040
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,420
We'll meet Mr. Seth later.

1041
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,700
Come sir. You may meet him first.

1042
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,750
- Thank you.
- It's alright.

1043
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,576
- They're really good people.
- Yes, they're very helpful.

1044
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,140
Sir, what is the name of your firm?

1045
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:54,980
Our firm? Sachdev, Dharmchand and Co.

1046
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,850
It's our duty to help the common man.

1047
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,490
Sir, why did you come here?

1048
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:03,490
I've come here to meet
Mr. Shyam Sunder Seth.

1049
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,350
Here? Are you here?

1050
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,100
- I'm not here?
- No, you aren't here.

1051
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,030
If I'm not here, then where am I?

1052
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,270
Sir, I can prove that you're not here.

1053
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:17,000
But sir, how can you prove
I'm not here?

1054
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,970
I can prove it. Let's bet on this.

1055
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,470
- Okay.
- Bet for 100 rupees?

1056
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,580
Not 100 rupees, sir.
You'll regret it later.

1057
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,470
- We'll bet for 10 rupees.
- Okay. We'll bet for 10 rupees then.

1058
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,820
I'll prove that you aren't here.

1059
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,180
Okay, prove it.

1060
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,680
Tell me sir.

1061
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,450
You aren't in Mumbai.

1062
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:34,920
No, I'm not.

1063
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,060
You aren't in Lahore either.

1064
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,630
No, I'm not.

1065
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,710
You're neither in Mumbai nor Lahore.

1066
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,176
- That means you're somewhere else.
- Yes, somewhere else.

1067
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,070
When you're somewhere else,
you can't be here.

1068
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,470
Good bye.

1069
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,190
Sir, you performed magic.

1070
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,956
You made both
me and my money disappear.

1071
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,620
What can we do?
Life is a game.

1072
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,050
Listen.

1073
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:02,100
If you wish to earn
double your money back...

1074
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,290
- then you can do that.
- How?

1075
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,250
You challenge this man as I did.

1076
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,420
I'll fool him.

1077
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,250
Listen sir.

1078
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,350
Yes, sir. This gentleman
wants to talk to you.

1079
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,740
Please exchange seats.

1080
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,680
Please ask sir.

1081
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,320
- What is it?
- Sir, why did you come here?

1082
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,270
I've come here to
meet Mr. Seth Shyam Sunder.

1083
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,170
Here? But are you here?

1084
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,410
Not here? I'm am here.

1085
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,210
Sir, you aren't here.

1086
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,390
If I'm not here then am I in Hell?

1087
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,100
I don't know about that but you
aren't here. I'll prove it to you.

1088
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:39,350
You can prove that I'm not here?

1089
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,890
How can this be proved?

1090
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,760
Bet me and I'll prove it to you.

1091
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,790
- Let's bet a 100.
- No, let's bet just 10.

1092
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,260
Okay, then I'll give you 10 rupees.

1093
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,590
- Prove it.
- Yes, sir.

1094
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,830
Are you in Kolkata now?

1095
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,560
No.

1096
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,200
Are you in Lahore then?

1097
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,470
No.

1098
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,140
You're neither in Kolkata nor Lahore.

1099
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:02,910
- That means you're somewhere else.
- Yes.

1100
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,266
If you're somewhere else,
then how can you be here?

1101
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,610
That's right, sir.

1102
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,820
- But sir, why did you take this money?
- Who took it?

1103
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,420
You took it, sir.

1104
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,080
I've won this challenge.
I proved it to you.

1105
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,030
Sir, you proved that I'm not here.

1106
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,560
If I'm not here,
then how can I take your money?

1107
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,960
Good bye.

1108
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,960
- Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1109
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,440
Sir, you go first.

1110
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,160
But the line starts here.

1111
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,880
We've been waiting since morning.
The line begins here.

1112
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,580
- Yes. Yes.
- Sachdev, please decide what to do.

1113
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,820
The line starts from there.

1114
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,570
How is that possible?
Ask the attendant.

1115
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,490
- Why not?
- The line...

1116
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,840
The line starts from there.

1117
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,030
- What?
- What sir, are trying to cause a scene?

1118
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,900
- Come, Mr. Sachdev.
- Come.

1119
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,430
Wow.

1120
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,870
These guys are just
like Sachdev Dharmchand and Co.

1121
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,300
It's their duty to serve
the common man.

1122
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,600
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1123
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,120
What are your names?

1124
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,370
People call me Mr. Seth Sachdev.

1125
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,210
And they call me Mr. Seth Dharmchand.

1126
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,610
- You're are the owners of Sachdev...
- Dharamchand and Co.

1127
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,290
That is right. That is right.

1128
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,840
I understood.

1129
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:24,610
- I've received your letter.
- Yes, we wrote it to you.

1130
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,720
Your company seems
to be very well-known.

1131
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,930
It's the result of hard work and honesty.

1132
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,220
Our principle is
'Honesty is the best policy'.

1133
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,156
It's learned from this letter...

1134
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,810
that most of the buildings in India
are made by your company.

1135
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,310
Yes. Our company has given...

1136
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,870
That was 'boss leg'?

1137
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:48,610
He meant that we repaired that pillar.

1138
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,630
Very good.

1139
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,690
- This contract should be awarded to you.
- That's by your blessing.

1140
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:58,430
- We're giving you the contract.
- Very good. Very good.

1141
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:02,020
If you could give us
some money in advance.

1142
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,020
As our business is spread everywhere...

1143
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,510
- we're in need of money.
- Yes. We'll give you advance money.

1144
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,540
- But now I've some important work.
- No problem.

1145
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:12,350
Come to my home for dinner
the day after tomorrow

1146
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,900
We'll discuss the contract further
and I'll provide the advance.

1147
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,440
- Thank you.
- Very good.

1148
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,190
My bungalow is on No. 5, Qutub road.

1149
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,566
So then we'll meet
you day after tomorrow.

1150
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:24,460
Okay, then you go on with your work.

1151
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,840
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1152
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,250
Ask the others to leave
as I can't meet them today.

1153
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,790
- You're always busy Mr. Seth.
- Yes, I'm a busy man.

1154
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,050
This is so unfair.

1155
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,050
What happened?

1156
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:46,860
What was to happen?

1157
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,330
I waited for Mr. Seth in his office...

1158
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,700
- and now we'll have to stay here four more days.
- Why?

1159
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:56,710
From tomorrow,
there's a four-day holiday.

1160
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,070
- Did you find us a place?
- Yes.

1161
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,576
Really?

1162
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,300
Yes. Today I met
my aunt and uncle accidentally.

1163
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,110
There's is a very big bungalow.

1164
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,740
They've invited us to stay with them.

1165
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,160
This is very good news.

1166
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,800
But the problem is that...

1167
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,496
they've no servants.

1168
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,780
It's difficult to find
good servants these days.

1169
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,420
But that doesn't bother us.

1170
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,360
We'll only be here four days.
We just need place to sleep.

1171
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,730
- But the thing is...
- What?

1172
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:29,350
My uncle and aunt are bit retarded.

1173
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:31,300
Sometimes they speak strangely.

1174
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,590
That's not a problem.

1175
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,860
Let's leave for your uncle's house.

1176
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,520
I'm tired. I'll relax there.

1177
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,870
You people have come?

1178
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:52,060
I was waiting for you.

1179
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,690
Come, come.

1180
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:57,420
- He's the one.
- Okay, okay.

1181
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,150
Sorry, we were late.

1182
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:02,000
What is it?

1183
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,050
The nails are loose. They'll hurt you.

1184
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,320
- I got saved.
- Yeah.

1185
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,560
What is it?

1186
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:17,360
I mean, go to your room
and rest a while.

1187
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,660
Yes, go and rest in your room.

1188
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,460
First rest and then work.

1189
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,090
And there's not much work
to do here.

1190
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,710
Work? What work?

1191
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:32,490
Oh. First rest and then work.

1192
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,880
This is your room.

1193
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,990
The room is very nice.

1194
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,530
Where's Meena's room?

1195
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,260
Why should she have a different room?

1196
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,280
Yes, what's the point?

1197
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,530
Okay. Now before starting work,
rest for awhile.

1198
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,810
What is this work?

1199
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,550
Your aunt is very strange.

1200
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,470
And she's put both
of us in the same room.

1201
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,570
I told you, these people are a bit mad.

1202
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:18,790
It's alright.

1203
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,990
The whole day we'll be outside.

1204
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,860
Yes. At night I'll stay outside.

1205
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,630
I mean, there.

1206
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,670
Okay, it's only for two to four days.

1207
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,396
Thank God we got a place.

1208
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,620
Otherwise, we'd have to sleep
in the park again tonight.

1209
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:39,350
I say, why have you
come home so late?

1210
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,850
I went to the club.

1211
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,340
I say, have the servants come?

1212
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,190
- Yes. They've come.
- They've come?

1213
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,730
Good.

1214
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:51,620
These days, getting a servant
is like winning the lottery.

1215
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,190
- What do you say?
- But the servant.

1216
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,060
He seems to be a Britisher.

1217
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,590
Have a look.

1218
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,960
I say, you keep eating the whole day.

1219
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:01,860
Make some tea for me too.

1220
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,800
I'll take a bath and drink it.

1221
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,970
As soon as you come home,
you think about food.

1222
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,210
Press the servants bell.

1223
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:14,470
This bell is being rung
for the first time in two months.

1224
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,120
What is this?
What bell was that?

1225
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,830
Maybe they've called us to drink tea.

1226
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,490
But we're guests and not servants.

1227
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,990
Bells are meant to call servants.

1228
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:32,410
Maybe they use it to call guests.

1229
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,270
Very strange people. But they're nice.

1230
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,900
Okay, so I'll bring you your tea.

1231
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,310
Okay.

1232
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,890
I'll also freshen up a bit.

1233
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,750
- Who's inside?
- I'm Ranjit.

1234
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,050
Ranjit?

1235
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:28,380
I say.

1236
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,990
I say.

1237
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,280
I say, who is this
Ranjit in my bathroom?

1238
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,340
He must be the new servant, Ranjit.

1239
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:37,230
Servant, and he's in my bathroom?

1240
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:40,220
Say it softly. I told you,
he's a Britisher type servant.

1241
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:43,230
So they take a bath
in their boss's bathroom?

1242
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,340
You'll chase away the servants.

1243
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,100
I can't live without servants.

1244
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,700
This is impossible.

1245
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:58,150
These servants. What they do
and what they say. Hell.

1246
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,840
If the door doesn't open now...

1247
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,380
I say...

1248
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,750
he used all my things.

1249
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,330
I say...

1250
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,700
I say. Did you see what
your new servant has done?

1251
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,150
What happened now?

1252
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:22,980
He used my soap, oil,
towel, cream, everything.

1253
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,450
I already told you,
he's a new fashioned servant.

1254
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,710
New fashioned servant. Fashion. Fashion.

1255
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,510
Who is this tea for?

1256
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,530
The tea is for that new servant.

1257
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,320
I say. Tea for the servant first?

1258
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,980
I say. Is he the servant or am I?

1259
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,960
Is this house his or mine?

1260
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,010
Say it softly.
What will the servants think?

1261
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:45,486
- Go. Take a bath.
- What will the servants say.

1262
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,710
Say it quietly.
You've got me in trouble.

1263
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,700
This is very funny.

1264
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,900
Your uncle and aunt are also strange.

1265
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,240
They don't even know
how to care for a guest.

1266
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,750
Now what is this bell for?

1267
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,550
Maybe it's time for food.

1268
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,170
Food?

1269
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,950
Tea and food together?

1270
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,680
They're a little...

1271
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,960
I'll just go and check.

1272
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,370
Who are you?

1273
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,170
- I'm Ranjit.
- Ranjit.

1274
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,840
The one from the bathroom?

1275
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,410
- Yes.
- Ranjit.

1276
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,070
Who's gown is this, sir?

1277
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,580
- Must be yours.
- Mine? - Yes.

1278
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,220
I forgot mine.

1279
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,540
Listen. You look like Shyam Sunder.

1280
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,640
Then what, am I the ghost
of Shyam Sunder? I say.

1281
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,430
- I say.
- Meena.

1282
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,450
Come quickly.

1283
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,740
Come inside. Something has happened.

1284
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:59,420
- Do you know who your uncle is?
- Who?

1285
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,210
That same Shyam Sunder, to whom
I've come to ask permission.

1286
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,540
Why didn't you tell me
his name earlier?

1287
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:07,060
Everything is done.

1288
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,480
Now you go and tell him.

1289
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:11,250
To give us the contract.
We'll make thousands of rupees.

1290
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,120
I'll promote you too.

1291
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,980
What's the matter?
Are you embarrassed to ask him?

1292
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:19,090
- I'll tell him myself.
- Listen.

1293
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,960
He's not the one.

1294
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,790
He is the one. Your uncle, Shyam Sunder.

1295
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,430
He must be...

1296
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,070
but he's not my uncle.

1297
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,940
He's not your uncle?
Is he your brother-in-law?

1298
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:30,980
He's no relation.

1299
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,670
He's the boss and we're the servants.

1300
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,670
- Servants?
- Yes.

1301
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,280
What do you mean?

1302
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,080
You'd only said, find a place to stay...

1303
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:42,950
even if you had to wash dishes for it.

1304
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,040
- Wash dishes?
- Yes.

1305
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,760
We've got this room
for washing dishes.

1306
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,340
- So you mean that...
- Yes...

1307
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,980
we're both servants here.

1308
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,430
Otherwise we wouldn't have
a place to stay.

1309
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,540
So this is the case.

1310
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,650
That's why he's
talking to me in this way.

1311
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,030
I'm a servant here.

1312
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:04,130
A manager of such a big company,
and a servant to do dishes.

1313
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,330
You're dismissed.

1314
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,540
You're dismissed now.

1315
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,010
I'll not stay a single minute here.

1316
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:11,910
Look. At least think.

1317
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,610
Where will we spend the night?

1318
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,810
In hell. You've made me so
poor bringing me to a foreign land.

1319
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,190
I did it for your best interests.

1320
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:21,076
Otherwise, where could we
have stayed?

1321
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,780
Look. Don't try to fool me
with your fake tears.

1322
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,470
I don't want to see your face.

1323
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,670
Get out. I mean, I'll get out.

1324
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,120
Listen.

1325
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,530
Rain.

1326
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,540
You've come back.

1327
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,290
How can I leave you alone and go?

1328
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,470
Also, it's raining outside.

1329
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,130
Forgive me.

1330
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:04,300
Listen to me.
It's only for a few days.

1331
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:06,340
We'll spend them easily here.

1332
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,890
And you wouldn't find a
place to stay in the city.

1333
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,570
Look, you don't
have to work as a servant.

1334
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,520
I'll do everything.

1335
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:21,320
Many astrologists saw my birth chart...

1336
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,430
and every one said that...

1337
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,600
I would rule.

1338
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,000
But none of the idiots said that...

1339
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,740
I'd have to wash dishes too.

1340
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,710
What? Have you had your rest?

1341
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,170
Yes.

1342
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:35,780
Yes.

1343
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,020
Okay. Now you both come with me.

1344
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,080
A few dishes have to be washed.

1345
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,680
Come. It's easy work.

1346
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,490
Yes, my family has been
washing dishes for generations.

1347
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,420
Then you'll wash them very well.

1348
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,740
- Come.
- Yes, I'll wash them well.

1349
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,160
Come.

1350
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,920
I'd made these for me.

1351
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,880
Your clothes will get dirty...

1352
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,380
so you put it on.

1353
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,810
Tie it.

1354
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:18,590
And a few dishes need washing.

1355
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,090
Wash them so that
you can use them as mirrirs.

1356
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,530
Few.

1357
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,000
- C'mon, start.
- Thank you.

1358
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,750
Now we've to do this forever.

1359
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,710
No, there are other jobs, too.

1360
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,300
Washing clothes...

1361
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:39,030
sweeping... Be careful.

1362
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,720
The plates are expensive.

1363
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,970
You go.
We'll wash them carefully.

1364
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,610
We'll wash them all.

1365
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,880
C'mon, start. Or will you keep talking?

1366
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,820
- What should I start?
- Washing plates.

1367
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,230
Washing plates.

1368
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,530
I say, be more careful.

1369
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:01,890
It's a good omen for
the first plate to break.

1370
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,210
But too many good
omens are also not right.

1371
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:06,780
No more plates will break.
You don't worry.

1372
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,630
You'll get us fired from here.

1373
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,360
Do you know how to do anything?

1374
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,850
Who do you think I am?

1375
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,716
My family have been servants
for generations?

1376
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,410
Okay, I'll wash them all.

1377
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,280
You just dry them
and put them away.

1378
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,650
Come.

1379
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,620
Carefully.

1380
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,520
What are you doing?

1381
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,860
Why are you giving
it to me? Put it there.

1382
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,920
But where should I put it?
There's no room.

1383
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,060
Okay, put those plates there.
And put the clean ones here.

1384
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:47,000
Where is your new fashioned servant?

1385
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,310
What do you say?

1386
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:53,900
I can hear a lot of noise
from the work.

1387
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:57,380
- I'm dead.
- I say.

1388
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,150
Watch out. Don't drop them.

1389
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:03,890
You've goten me into trouble.

1390
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,960
Don't destroy us in this
battle of husband and wife.

1391
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,460
Husband and wife.

1392
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:12,380
I'm dead.

1393
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,050
I say. They are new fashioned servants.

1394
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,270
Now why are you complaining?

1395
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:25,030
You killed me.

1396
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:30,210
Daddy.

1397
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,210
Daddy.

1398
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,500
Haven't you received any letters from him?

1399
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,020
From Ranjit?

1400
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,850
No, dear.

1401
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,490
I don't know what's happened.

1402
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,470
Even the office hasn't heard anything.

1403
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,510
He should've replied as
soon as he reached Delhi.

1404
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,510
Then daddy...

1405
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,840
why don't you
send a letter and find out?

1406
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,300
I've sent a letter...

1407
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,210
but the hotel
where he had reservations...

1408
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,850
they replied that
he wasn't staying there.

1409
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,380
God knows where he is.

1410
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:04,750
What if he's had an accident, daddy?

1411
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,580
Don't worry.
There's been no accident.

1412
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,520
After all, his secretary is also with him.

1413
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,210
She'd have informed us
if there'd been an accident.

1414
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,590
Oh. So this is the matter.

1415
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:20,330
The secretary also went with him.

1416
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,190
I think I should
fly to Delhi today.

1417
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,570
I've some other business also...

1418
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,610
and I'll track down Ranjit
at the same time.

1419
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:34,960
Daddy. I'll go to Delhi with you.

1420
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:36,830
What will you do there?

1421
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,370
I'll roam around Delhi.

1422
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,000
And I'll see the Qutub.

1423
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,870
You'll do as you like.

1424
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,980
- So, should I go pack, daddy?
- Go. Go.

1425
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,070
I say...

1426
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,450
you've become an expert
at washing plates.

1427
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,230
Yes, this is all due to you.

1428
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,920
Before, I was a simple manager.

1429
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,710
I think both husband and wife
are in a good mood today.

1430
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,460
Sit down. Work.

1431
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,670
Do you remember, you've
to make food for two guests?

1432
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,810
The food is almost ready.

1433
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,330
Add some more spices.

1434
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,110
Yes, we'll do it.

1435
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:28,230
Good. I'll go and arrange everything.

1436
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,030
First of all a servant...

1437
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:34,740
second husband and wife...

1438
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,400
tell me if you've mentioned kids also.

1439
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,580
No.

1440
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,820
What's wrong?

1441
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,540
Check the pot.
The ghee is burning.

1442
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,720
Add some spices.

1443
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,610
Here, take this box of red chili powder.

1444
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,740
The ghee is burning?
Here my whole body is on fire.

1445
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,540
What have you done?
You poured the whole can in there?

1446
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:17,960
So what?
They wanted more spices.

1447
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,936
But this will burn the mouth.

1448
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,240
Then what can I do?

1449
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,636
You've turned a good person into...

1450
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:23,906
a stupid manager.

1451
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:26,860
I say, your check is ready.

1452
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,460
But due to work, I couldn't call you.

1453
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:31,030
It's alright.

1454
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:33,430
We'd also gone hunting with a king.

1455
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,420
- Yes, we hunted big elephants.
- Elephants?

1456
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,730
He means, we killed rabbits
while riding an elephant.

1457
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,690
Killed rabbits sitting on an elephant?

1458
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,270
From on top you can get a good shot.

1459
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:48,010
So you like hunting?

1460
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:51,170
Yes, we live to hunt.

1461
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,740
I say, even we've
made chicken for you today.

1462
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:56,980
Here, put on your napkin.

1463
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,940
- Thank you.
- Our new servants...

1464
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,160
make food exactly like the Britishers.

1465
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:03,430
Ranjit? Bring the food.

1466
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:04,900
We'll enjoy it a lot.

1467
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:08,020
Won't we, Mr. Mohan?
I mean in Hindi, Mr. Sachdev.

1468
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,580
Very good, Mr. Dharamchand.

1469
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,710
Have some salad.

1470
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,010
- Very good salad.
- Begin.

1471
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:15,950
First take the chicken dish.

1472
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,580
- Why are you making such faces?
- My teeth are paining.

1473
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,440
I think I've seen
this servant somewhere.

1474
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,910
You've surely seen him.

1475
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,980
He's worked for famous Britishers.

1476
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,620
Very good, service.

1477
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,160
Meena, there's a problem.

1478
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,520
- Now what's happened?
- These guests know me.

1479
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,330
I met them at sir's office.

1480
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,550
Now you have to take the food.

1481
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,970
Okay, I'll take it.

1482
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:45,210
Very good smell.

1483
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,810
And the raita (dish) is very very...

1484
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:53,850
So did you like it?

1485
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,720
- Like?
- Very much.

1486
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,620
Have some water.

1487
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,030
The food is totally British type.

1488
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:09,940
I drink a lot of water with my food.

1489
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,530
There's just a bit too much chile.

1490
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,540
No, there's not too much.

1491
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,180
I say...

1492
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,120
Have some more, Mr. Sachdev.

1493
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,590
You have it, Mr. Dharamchand.
I eat it everyday.

1494
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,090
First give it to him.

1495
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,680
Take.

1496
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,870
What nonsense is this?

1497
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,960
- Where was your attention?
- I felt lightheaded.

1498
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:48,900
Did you see your
British fashioned servants?

1499
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,840
- It's strange.
- It's okay, sir.

1500
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,920
Once, my servant spilled
a whole jar of water on me.

1501
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,680
- Forgive us, your clothes are soiled.
- It's alright.

1502
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,450
These clothes are not ours.

1503
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,560
He means to say...

1504
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:05,830
in the spiritual world,
nothing is owned by anyone.

1505
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:07,730
Your thoughts are so cultured.

1506
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:09,980
Our life is only related to karma.

1507
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:12,240
Then we're very
fortunate to have you here.

1508
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,080
You don't have any idea the
profit that we're going to have.

1509
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:17,610
- Right, Mr. Sachdev?
- Very good, Mr. Dharamchand.

1510
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,930
People like you are hard to find.

1511
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:22,500
No one believes
in spiritual thoughts these days.

1512
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,060
- What do you say?
- Yes.

1513
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,910
Have something.

1514
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:28,230
- Take some fruits.
- We eat everyday.

1515
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,870
Sir keeps working the whole day.

1516
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:35,310
Because of that he has
earned his name, Mr. Sachdev.

1517
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:39,110
Very good name.
Our names are also due to our work.

1518
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:43,400
Our name has become so well known
that we don't even need to work.

1519
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:45,500
Very good, Mr. Dharamchand.

1520
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:48,590
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1521
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:51,000
Sir, bring the check.

1522
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:53,220
- We have to catch a train.
- Yes, I'll bring it.

1523
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,780
You people eat.

1524
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,210
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

1525
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,590
- These are thieves.
- Thieves?

1526
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:04,370
Where? Who?

1527
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:07,600
- Your guests are thieves.
- Guests, thieves?

1528
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,780
- What are you saying?
- Here, look at their prison photo.

1529
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,050
They really are thieves.

1530
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,150
Excellent, dear.
You saved me.

1531
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,040
Thank god I haven't
given them the check yet.

1532
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:20,250
I'll fix them good right now.

1533
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,110
Very very good, Dharamchand.

1534
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:26,506
Did you bring the check, sir?

1535
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,540
I say, the check will come.

1536
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,880
But the police have sent us
the photographs of two criminals.

1537
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,340
They say, two famous criminals...

1538
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,630
impersonate businessmen
and are robbing firms.

1539
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,450
I've seen them somewhere.

1540
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:46,890
- Why, Mr. Mohan?
- Very good..

1541
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,780
I've never seen them anywhere.

1542
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,230
Oh, my wallet.

1543
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,800
I left it at the hotel.

1544
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,780
Excuse me, nowadays,
with these thieves around...

1545
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:02,696
I hope they don't rob us.
I'll have to go now.

1546
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,150
- Greetings.
- Wait, sir.

1547
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,430
What's the hurry?
At least take the check.

1548
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:09,460
The check I'll get later.
First I should look after my cash.

1549
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,110
Greetings.

1550
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,610
- Where are you going, sir?
- The wallet is his...

1551
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:15,420
but the money in it is mine.

1552
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,080
What's going on?

1553
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,790
Why did they leave suddenly?

1554
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,170
Today Meena saved us.
Both those men are crooks.

1555
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:25,660
Criminals?

1556
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:27,770
Yes, they even took my napkin.

1557
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,910
Thank god, they left you.
They might have taken you, too.

1558
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,990
Look at this, they were such criminals.

1559
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:40,660
Great destiny.

1560
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,860
From a manager to a servant.

1561
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,530
From a servant to a cook.

1562
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:47,980
Only one thing was left, a washerman.

1563
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:50,140
Even that you fulfilled for me.

1564
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:53,680
What else you make me do,
only you and your God know.

1565
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,930
It'll be like this only here, sir.

1566
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,280
Like this only.

1567
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:28,410
The monsoons have come

1568
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,670
Very interesting

1569
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,840
The monsoons have come

1570
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,010
The dark clouds are gathering

1571
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,160
Oh, my dear

1572
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,990
My drape is not under my control

1573
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:30,330
My heart is also
in the same condition

1574
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:41,040
The monsoons have come

1575
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,540
Very interesting

1576
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:09,760
My hearts trembles
when I see the black clouds

1577
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:21,520
And speaks the words of love

1578
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:33,160
The season of love has arrived

1579
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,570
Oh my dear

1580
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,780
The monsoons have come

1581
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:50,120
Very interesting

1582
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,440
I say, who is it?

1583
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,990
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1584
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:19,060
- Are you Shyam Sunder?
- Yes.

1585
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:20,990
My name is Shankar Das.

1586
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,850
Meaning, Mr. Rai Shankar Das.

1587
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:26,630
- This is my daughter, Vimla.
- I say, come in.

1588
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:31,930
Sit down.

1589
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,270
I say, how can I help you?

1590
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,170
Few days ago
my man came to Delhi.

1591
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,640
But he came here
and then disappeared.

1592
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,810
I've come to you
in my search for him.

1593
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,680
What is your person's name?

1594
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:52,100
- Ranjit Kumar.
- Yes, he's staying here.

1595
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:54,730
Thank god. I'm so relieved.

1596
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,990
This means Ranjit is staying here.

1597
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:59,336
He's a very good man.

1598
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,210
He's a very hardworking man, sir.

1599
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,310
I say, you've come to visit him?

1600
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:05,636
What 'visit'?

1601
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,260
I've come here to take him back.

1602
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,430
- Take him back?
- Yes.

1603
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,690
Because of his absence,
I'm losing a lot of money.

1604
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:13,880
But how can he go back, sir?

1605
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:15,870
Who will do my work here?

1606
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,900
- Your work?
- What else?

1607
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,760
My entire house is under him.

1608
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,100
For the past two months my wife
has had to do the cooking.

1609
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,300
Now, since Ranjit
has been doing the cooking...

1610
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,890
she's gotten some rest.

1611
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,430
What are you saying?

1612
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:32,120
- Ranjit has started cooking food?
- Yes.

1613
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:34,350
He works from morning till evening.

1614
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,996
He sweeps sometimes...

1615
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,330
washes clothes sometimes...

1616
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,100
then he washes the dishes.

1617
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:41,070
- Washes dishes?
- Yes.

1618
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:43,730
About which Ranjit
are you speaking, sir?

1619
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,230
My Ranjit is the manager of my office.

1620
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:48,120
- Manager of the office?
- Yes.

1621
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,880
My Ranjit is a chef.

1622
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,470
This is also good.

1623
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,970
I say, this is also good.

1624
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,850
I speak of one person...

1625
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,320
and you of someone else.

1626
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,680
Unnecessary misunderstanding.

1627
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,970
This Ranjit is a poor servant.

1628
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,150
Have a look at him.

1629
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,180
I'll just call him. Ranjit.

1630
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:06,780
Ranjit.

1631
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:08,630
Forgive me.

1632
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,786
Without thinking,
I began an argument with you.

1633
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,310
I say, the mistake is mine.

1634
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,670
- Ranjit.
- Coming.

1635
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,550
Ranjit.

1636
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:20,270
Ranjit. Come here.

1637
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:22,400
Come here.

1638
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:25,510
You? It's the same Ranjit.

1639
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,750
- Ranjit.
- He's my chef.

1640
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:30,280
What chef?

1641
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:31,680
He's my manager.

1642
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:33,840
- Manager?
- What are you saying?

1643
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:37,650
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, but you are.

1644
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:40,280
This is my manager
and my daughter's fiancé.

1645
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:41,820
Fiancé?

1646
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:43,580
Sir, he's married.

1647
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,900
- Married?
- Certainly.

1648
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:48,130
His wife also works here.

1649
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,820
- I say...
- Meaning...

1650
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,630
- Wife?
- Yes. I'll just call her.

1651
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:54,700
I say, Meena.

1652
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,310
Meena.

1653
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,410
Yes, father.

1654
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,990
- Greetings.
- She's the wife...

1655
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:02,960
while engaged to me?

1656
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,070
- Daddy, fire Ranjit immediately.
- You are dismissed.

1657
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,510
Meaning, total dismissal?

1658
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,490
- Listen to me...
- What's there to hear?

1659
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,830
Meaning, he's a manager there
and a chef here?

1660
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:16,020
There engagement and marriage here.

1661
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,700
Wait. It's not his mistake.

1662
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:22,120
We wouldn't have gotten
a place to stay in Delhi.

1663
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,450
This is my mistake.

1664
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,400
Your mistake?
Then you're fired, too.

1665
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:28,950
Come on Vimla.
There's nothing but thieves here.

1666
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:31,746
I say, even you became a gangster
to steal away my servant.

1667
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,890
Have some shame.

1668
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,826
- C'mon Vimla.
- But at least listen to me.

1669
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,450
You're again dismissed.
Double dismissed.

1670
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,590
- C'mon, daddy.
- C'mon. - But...

1671
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:41,970
I say, Shakuntala.

1672
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:46,790
Now I've lost the job
and the girl, too.

1673
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,590
And this is all your fault.

1674
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,300
First you made me wash dishes
and become a servant.

1675
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:53,890
And you've ruined everything.

1676
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:03,220
You only said...

1677
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,856
to find a place to stay.

1678
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,370
Go to hell with what I said.

1679
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:08,570
Why didn't you take me to the graveyard?

1680
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:10,940
Why do you cry?

1681
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,530
It's not my funeral yet.

1682
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,040
You're always shouting at me.

1683
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:18,710
Wipe your tears, oh god.

1684
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:21,450
Why do you make the poor girl cry?

1685
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:23,950
What happened dear?

1686
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:25,610
Why do you cry?

1687
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,920
These males are very cruel.

1688
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:30,950
You made a innocent girl cry.

1689
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:32,886
You must've said something.

1690
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,630
I say, I haven't said anything.

1691
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,340
They said they were married.
And they're not.

1692
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:40,010
If they're not married,
they'll get married.

1693
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:41,560
After all, what's the big deal?

1694
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:44,880
Don't cry, dear. We'll help you.

1695
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,620
But he's not even a servant.

1696
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:49,450
You want to force him
to be a servant.

1697
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,590
Afterall, only yesterday
this girl saved you from thieves.

1698
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:55,310
Today you fell for Mr. Rai's claims
and forgot everything.

1699
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,460
I don't think anything of Mr. Rai.

1700
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:59,100
He has dismissed us.

1701
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,790
If he's dismissed them,
then you give them a share.

1702
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,880
Mr. Rai will remember his grandma.

1703
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:05,960
I say, you're right.

1704
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,230
Even I'm angry.

1705
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:09,840
Mr. Rai sir.

1706
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:12,400
You start your own company.

1707
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:14,960
I'll give you money and shares too.

1708
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,410
Company?

1709
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,120
- Shares?
- What else?

1710
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,920
But, I've one condition...

1711
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,560
What?

1712
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,120
You'll have to prepare
this afternoon's meal.

1713
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:28,260
I say, you make very tasty food.

1714
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,900
Sir, we'll make food for you ten times.

1715
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,700
Now, wipe away your tears.

1716
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,130
I say, let's go inside.

1717
01:44:38,770 --> 01:44:40,290
Come, I'll do it.

1718
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,280
What are you doing?

1719
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:46,340
Can't you see? I'm making my office.

1720
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,270
This is our clerk, Mr. Karela.

1721
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,820
- And where are you?
- Me?

1722
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:56,950
This is me.

1723
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,620
This is you.

1724
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:00,460
And this is your tail.

1725
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:04,720
And this is a very fat person,
who's coming to meet us.

1726
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,430
But the door is small...

1727
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,350
and the man is so fat...

1728
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:11,460
and that's our loss.
So the man goes back.

1729
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:15,060
If people go back like this,
how will the office run?

1730
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,840
We'll think about it later.

1731
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,410
Right now, in this office...

1732
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,370
you and I are there alone.

1733
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:26,070
What are you doing?
The clerk is watching.

1734
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,510
What's this problem?

1735
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:30,560
You'll not even let me come close.

1736
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,670
You should give me a chance at least.

1737
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,790
So that I can tell you
the condition of my heart.

1738
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:57,570
Don't ask about my heart

1739
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:01,620
Don't ask anything

1740
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:08,830
Don't ask anything of love

1741
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:12,850
Don't ask anything

1742
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:38,190
Why is my heart beating faster?

1743
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:52,630
Why?

1744
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:59,906
I bow my head down.
Don't ask anything

1745
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:03,690
Don't ask anything

1746
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,170
I only remember this

1747
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:26,020
I only remember our eyes met

1748
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,010
Our eyes met

1749
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:37,310
Don't ask anything about my heart

1750
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:41,200
Don't ask anything

1751
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:06,060
We are in search
of the path of love

1752
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,190
In search of the path

1753
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:24,940
Where will this journey end?

1754
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:27,480
Don't ask anything

1755
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:38,450
Don't ask anything about my heart

1756
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:42,460
Don't ask anything

1757
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:49,500
Don't ask anything of love

1758
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,650
Don't ask anything

1759
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:57,150
Did you hear dear?
Ranjit has opened his own company.

1760
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,950
Own company?

1761
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,620
From where did he get the money?

1762
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:03,690
Shyam Sunder gave him money...

1763
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,520
and the contract too.

1764
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,510
And I also learned...

1765
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:10,610
he and Meena never married.

1766
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:13,170
Never married?

1767
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:17,010
- But there...
- it was a pretense to get the shares.

1768
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:19,180
They're not married,
nor will they ever marry.

1769
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:22,380
Oh.

1770
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:26,320
I get tired of working.

1771
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,230
Ranjit Kumar.

1772
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:34,790
- What do you think?
- There's no answer to it.

1773
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:39,180
But Mr. Ranjit Kumar,
what's my share in this company?

1774
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,030
Your share? Me.

1775
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,900
Look, this is an office.

1776
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,690
Don't talk nonsense here.

1777
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:46,850
Okay, so let's go inside.

1778
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,250
Let's work.

1779
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,390
Sit down.

1780
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:00,560
Write a business letter.

1781
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,230
Sir Shyam Sunder.

1782
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:08,180
5, Qutub Road...

1783
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:09,730
New Delhi.

1784
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:11,390
- Did you write?
- Yes.

1785
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:13,570
Greetings.

1786
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:17,070
Did you write?

1787
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,810
So, write...

1788
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:21,610
I've opened the office.

1789
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,780
And have started the work.

1790
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:27,950
I've hired a secretary, too.

1791
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:31,020
She doesn't work but...

1792
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,180
she doesn't look bad.

1793
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:35,040
Is this a business letter?

1794
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:37,800
You don't know. Modern
business letters are just like this..

1795
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,800
Write. Write.

1796
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:43,210
Her eyes are very beautiful.

1797
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:49,050
I've made her my business partner.

1798
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:52,320
But I'm making plans
to make her my life partner.

1799
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:55,160
- I won't write.
- You're upset?

1800
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,060
Okay, write.
A formal business letter.

1801
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,990
- What is this?
- This is shorthand.

1802
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,816
What kind of a shorthand is this?

1803
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,050
The new one.

1804
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,190
Japanese.

1805
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,690
Oh Japanese lady.

1806
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,830
The reality is that you
don't know short hand at all.

1807
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:17,470
And till now you've been fooling me.

1808
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,890
You're dismissed.

1809
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,600
You're totally dismissed.

1810
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,890
Meaning, you're not capable
of becoming a business partner.

1811
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:29,110
But, you can be my life partner.

1812
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,870
Meena, I can't keep my
feelings quiet any longer.

1813
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,990
I love you.

1814
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:36,950
Not just from today...

1815
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,920
but since you first set foot
into my office.

1816
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:44,220
- Should I also tell my heart's feelings?
- Yes, tell.

1817
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:48,000
I liked you, too,
since that time...

1818
01:51:49,230 --> 01:51:51,180
but you talk with such authority...

1819
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:53,290
that I always kept quiet.

1820
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:57,150
So, this false authority ruined me.

1821
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,340
All the bosses...

1822
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,870
who stay in their offices...

1823
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,530
are also soft hearted like me.

1824
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:06,040
And you had that girl, too,
Ms. Vimla.

1825
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:09,520
At that time,
I didn't even know...

1826
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:10,990
what love was.

1827
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,990
Only money and position...

1828
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,680
were the two things I saw..

1829
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,960
Meena, my mother never liked Vimla.

1830
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:19,960
But watch out. When you visit...

1831
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,660
she'll love you
more than she does me.

1832
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,230
Really? Where is your mother?

1833
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:27,780
In Kashmir.
We're from Kashmir.

1834
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:29,370
I'm Kasli.

1835
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,210
That means I'm very confident.

1836
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:35,220
Our marriage will
also take place in Kashmir.

1837
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:36,910
Marriage?

1838
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:38,780
Why? Are you afraid of marriage?

1839
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:40,610
Yes, you'll be afraid.

1840
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:42,740
You've never been married before.

1841
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,110
Ranjit sir...

1842
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,680
marriage is a beautiful dream.

1843
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,090
To turn that beautiful dream
into reality is our goal.

1844
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:57,060
I want this, too.

1845
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:58,900
But I...

1846
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,350
- I'm not worthy of you.
- What are you saying?

1847
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:04,030
- Say I'm not worthy of you.
- No, no.

1848
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,280
You don't know...

1849
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:08,940
- about my past.
- Oh, the past.

1850
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:11,060
What happens to you?
Do you go into a trance?

1851
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:13,140
Suddenly you become sad while smiling.

1852
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,220
- Did you love someone else once?
- No, no.

1853
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,540
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

1854
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,450
Future days... last days... past days...

1855
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:24,210
Look, the program is,
we'll reach Kashmir next week.

1856
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:26,080
And after arriving, we'll get married.

1857
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:27,760
Do you agree?

1858
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,660
Look here.

1859
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,860
Say yes. Say yes.

1860
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:37,440
Meena has agreed to me.

1861
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,170
Meena has agreed to me.

1862
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,840
I'll go and write a letter to mother...

1863
01:53:41,110 --> 01:53:43,710
asking her to begin
preparations for the marriage.

1864
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,920
And I'll tell my friends here also.

1865
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:50,160
Meena has agreed to me.

1866
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:52,010
Meena has agreed to me.

1867
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:13,670
Great. Great. Great.

1868
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:18,990
Today the queen looks very happy.

1869
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,640
You?

1870
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,650
What style.

1871
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,480
Very good style.

1872
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:26,520
Why have you people come here?

1873
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:28,600
Why have we come here, Mr. Mohan?

1874
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,890
Just for business.

1875
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:33,590
Yes, Meena Devi, congratulations.

1876
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:36,200
- You've trapped a good prey.
- What prey?

1877
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:40,490
The girl is intelligent. We're dumb.

1878
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:44,790
Ranjit Kumar is very famous here.

1879
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,640
Very good.

1880
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:49,840
If sister gets rich,
the brothers will get something, too.

1881
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,600
And then we're saving sister
from a murder case, too.

1882
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,750
You've come to blackmail me?

1883
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:58,830
Blackmail? Meaning
we're distributing black money?

1884
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:02,870
Why Mr. Mohan?
Go to hell with the blackmail.

1885
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,730
We've come to make a deal.

1886
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,590
Take from this hand
and give to this hand.

1887
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,720
You're wasting your time.

1888
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,530
I don't have a single penny
for you people.

1889
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,300
So, listen Meena Devi.

1890
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:16,610
Look.

1891
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:19,170
The accusation of
the money is still on you.

1892
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,780
And that betrayal in the
Green Hotel, you were near us.

1893
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:27,140
Your fate is now in my hands.

1894
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:29,060
Even if you try...

1895
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,190
you won't be able to free yourself
from our trap.

1896
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:33,410
It'll be better for you...

1897
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:37,460
to get 5000 rupees from Ranjit
and give it to us.

1898
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,760
- Otherwise...
- No, I can't do this.

1899
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:43,270
I'll not betray Ranjit.

1900
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,250
You can hand me over to the police.

1901
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,100
Only children go to the police for help.

1902
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:52,770
Just to tell Ranjit about you...

1903
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,046
will be enough.

1904
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:55,590
When he comes to know that...

1905
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:57,350
his Meena is a criminal...

1906
01:55:57,850 --> 01:56:01,340
- then...
- No. For god's sake tell him nothing.

1907
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:05,670
Then, you've the power
to close our lips.

1908
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,270
This can't happen
that you play with money...

1909
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,970
and we poor keep
craving for your money.

1910
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:15,910
We don't have a single penny
to have a cigarette.

1911
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,610
Take down our address, Ms. Meena.

1912
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,980
Mr. Mohan. Mr. Sohan.

1913
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,650
Hindustan Hotel. Mall Road.

1914
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:29,040
- That's all. Come, Mr. Mohan.
- Come.

1915
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,010
And keep in mind.

1916
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:33,840
Yes.

1917
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,630
Keep in mind...

1918
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:40,610
the money should reach us in time.

1919
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:44,090
Otherwise we'll come to
know about your past and future.

1920
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:58,200
Oh. Sleep in these beautiful eyes?

1921
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:01,910
You?

1922
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,770
I'd remembered someone.

1923
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:08,480
Did you remember someone or Mr.
Mohan and Sohan remind you of something?

1924
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:13,590
So, Ranjit has taken his office.

1925
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:16,550
And has made you a
partner in the company too.

1926
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:21,130
I've heard that he has plans
to make you his life partner too.

1927
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:23,270
Congratulations from my side, Meena Devi.

1928
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,960
Ranjit loves you.

1929
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,800
For a lover, love is his entire world.

1930
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:34,840
And the rest is this about...

1931
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:37,610
who you are and from where you are.

1932
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,250
What relation
you've with Mohan and Sohan.

1933
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:41,720
These are all ordinary things.

1934
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,500
Ranjit doesn't
have any relation with it.

1935
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:47,490
After all, what do you want to say?

1936
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,940
I want to tell you this, Meena Devi.

1937
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:52,900
Ranjit can never be yours.

1938
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:57,000
You've blinded him in your love trap.

1939
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,590
But when he comes to know your truth...

1940
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:02,540
then his hateful eye
won't be tolerated by you.

1941
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:05,880
You've stranded him in your love.

1942
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:09,980
Don't take advantage
of his weakness, Meena.

1943
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,870
You've removed him from a big position...

1944
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,870
and shut him up in this jail.

1945
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:19,370
Ranjit was the manager of our firm.

1946
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:21,530
And after marrying me...

1947
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:24,350
he would've been
the owner of our firm.

1948
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:27,230
If you truly love him...

1949
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,330
then go away from his world.

1950
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:35,210
Your world and
Ranjit's world can't be one.

1951
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,010
Remember what I've said.

1952
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:01,320
Mr. Ranjit...

1953
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:03,760
I'm going.

1954
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,030
I'm going away from your world.

1955
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:11,690
It's better for you if I go away.

1956
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:13,980
For god's sake...

1957
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,350
don't try to find me.

1958
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:19,746
Forgive me

1959
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:21,070
It's alright.

1960
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:07,350
Here, wipe your tears.

1961
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:14,300
- You?
- Yes, me.

1962
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,930
I'm dead tired searching for you.

1963
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,400
After all, what's the point?

1964
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,370
From Vimla, I came to
know that you people spoke.

1965
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:25,940
And then you kept that
letter and came away from there.

1966
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:28,320
But I don't know what Vimla told you.

1967
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:31,860
Vimla didn't say anything much to me.

1968
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:34,950
Nothing? Then why'd
you run away like a thief?

1969
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,900
Have you committed theft?

1970
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,550
Or robbed someone?

1971
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,400
Apart from my heart.

1972
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:42,380
Have you murdered someone?

1973
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:44,000
After all, what have you done?

1974
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:46,960
What do you know, who I am?

1975
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,230
Maybe I've committed theft.

1976
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:51,550
Maybe I'm wanted for murder.

1977
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:54,430
You're wanted for murder.

1978
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:56,270
My murder.

1979
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:58,310
Stop joking, Mr. Ranjit.

1980
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:00,110
Okay, I'll stop.

1981
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,850
But I'll never leave you.

1982
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:04,660
Look, don't fall for Vimla's nonsense.

1983
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,050
Come with me.

1984
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:09,526
- But listen to me...
- I don't want to listen to anything.

1985
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:11,060
Come quietly with me.

1986
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,760
- But...
- No ifs ands or buts.

1987
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:16,150
We'll leave for Kashmir
on tomorrow evening's train.

1988
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:18,700
Mother must've started the
preparations for the marriage.

1989
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:20,540
If not for me...

1990
02:01:20,870 --> 02:01:22,450
at least come for your marriage.

1991
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:25,410
What do you think? Come.

1992
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:30,510
More. More.

1993
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:32,040
Yes, more.

1994
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,670
Come, come.

1995
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:35,760
Meena agreed.

1996
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:52,660
The stars of love

1997
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:08,890
They give the sign of love

1998
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:12,890
The stars of love

1999
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:19,576
These nights of love...

2000
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,330
they give the sign of love

2001
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:41,110
They always speak of you
with the moon

2002
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:45,380
These nights of love

2003
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:02,920
These are the days of love

2004
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:18,680
Don't ignore me.
These are the days of love

2005
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:28,840
My heart is not in my control

2006
02:03:42,910 --> 02:03:50,270
Why are you
comparing me with others?

2007
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:54,760
My heart is not in my control

2008
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,930
Don't worry dear

2009
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:25,360
Have fear with the generation

2010
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:29,920
Don't worry dear

2011
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:35,550
This atmosphere is very lovely

2012
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:56,440
Every flower is chanting our story

2013
02:04:56,810 --> 02:05:01,270
This atmosphere is very lovely

2014
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:06,730
The two separated hearts...

2015
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:27,660
are fortunate to have met again

2016
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,920
- Greetings mother.
- God bless you son.

2017
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,440
I've been waiting a long time.

2018
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,310
Mother, this is Meena.

2019
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,300
Yes, I recognized her.

2020
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,550
God bless you.

2021
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:38,460
How did you recognize me?

2022
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,390
From Ranjit's letters.

2023
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:44,190
These days, apart from
complimenting you, he writes nothing.

2024
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:46,340
Did I give the wrong compliments?

2025
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,060
Totally wrong.

2026
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,600
How wrong?

2027
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:52,950
What else?

2028
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,150
And Vimla.

2029
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,730
She's nothing compared to you.

2030
02:06:58,630 --> 02:07:00,160
Mother has accepted you.

2031
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:04,530
What? I've made
the wedding arrangements.

2032
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:07,300
Without my advice you've
already made the arrangements?

2033
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:11,080
You make all your decisions
without me.

2034
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,630
Can't I make
the wedding arrangements?

2035
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,260
Then, it's okay.

2036
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:17,790
Dear, your room is ready.

2037
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,140
Freshen up. We'll have tea.

2038
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:22,196
Ramu.

2039
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:23,590
Make tea.

2040
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:25,090
Okay.

2041
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:28,750
No one cares about me.

2042
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,070
Give me tea.

2043
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:35,460
Have you called me, madam?

2044
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:40,970
- Is there any mail for me?
- Yes.

2045
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,310
The postman said
it's a wedding invitation.

2046
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:46,370
Wedding invitation?

2047
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:55,460
Respected madam...

2048
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:59,590
my son Ranjit Kumar
is getting married...

2049
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:04,200
with your Meena
on the tenth of May.

2050
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:09,380
I expect you to attend the wedding.

2051
02:08:10,110 --> 02:08:11,880
Your well wisher, Sita.

2052
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:19,380
Ranjit wed Meena? Hell.

2053
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:52,250
Mohan, Sohan.

2054
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:56,330
Hindustan Hotel.

2055
02:08:56,990 --> 02:08:58,320
Mall Road.

2056
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:06,430
Let Mohan and Sohan
be invited to the wedding.

2057
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:08,630
Chandu.

2058
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:15,130
- Ramu.
- Yes, madam.

2059
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:19,780
- Please post this letter.
- Okay, madam.

2060
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:24,380
Vimla? Vimla, dear?

2061
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:33,270
Dear, why are so upset?

2062
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,770
Father, I haven't been feeling well
for a few days now.

2063
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:39,600
- Father?
- Why, dear?

2064
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:42,826
- I'm thinking of taking a vacation.
- Okay.

2065
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:47,530
Why not? I can't come.
I have some work in the office.

2066
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:49,710
But you go to Shimla.

2067
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:51,600
- Not Shimla, father.
- Then?

2068
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:55,040
- I'm planning for Kashmir.
- As you wish.

2069
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:57,130
There are arrangements to be made.

2070
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:59,980
Father, won't you come with me?

2071
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:03,890
Not right now. I can
come only after ten days.

2072
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:06,790
But you can go.
Take someone with you.

2073
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:10,380
- Okay.
- When will you leave?

2074
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:15,400
If I have to go,
then I'll start tomorrow.

2075
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:19,210
Okay then. I'll make
all the arrangements for you.

2076
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:20,710
Oh father.

2077
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,820
Move along with the track

2078
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:46,910
We have started the journey

2079
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:52,020
My heart is delighted

2080
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:58,690
Oh my dear

2081
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:06,560
Don't get upset

2082
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:23,330
Don't worry about it.
Go far away. Don't cry

2083
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:35,940
- What if I'm not in your sight?
- What happens?

2084
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:43,720
Assume that I am in your heart

2085
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:50,990
We have started the journey

2086
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:57,996
God help me

2087
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:00,450
Move along with the track

2088
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,880
God, you are the king

2089
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:07,360
Move along with the track

2090
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:11,306
You have left the path of love...

2091
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:16,060
and have hurt my feelings.
Listen to me

2092
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,470
Listen to me

2093
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:44,830
When will you return?
What will you bring for me?

2094
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:02,050
My eyes will welcome you every time

2095
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:08,740
Only for you

2096
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:25,300
I will spend my
night thinking of you

2097
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:32,140
Listen to me for once

2098
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:38,910
Move along with the track

2099
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:46,610
Listen to me, dear

2100
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:06,150
Listen to the beats
of my love, dear

2101
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:17,180
Listen to me, dear

2102
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:25,230
Don't flaunt your love

2103
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:32,230
This path is full of thorns

2104
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:38,400
Don't walk this path

2105
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:51,290
Move along with the track

2106
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:33,800
- Congratulations.
- Live a long life.

2107
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,570
Go and sit there.

2108
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,300
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Come inside.

2109
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:40,340
- Greetings.
- God bless you.

2110
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:42,110
- Where are Kamala and Sheela?
- Yes.

2111
02:16:42,139 --> 02:16:43,539
Come and take your seat.

2112
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:46,160
- Greetings.
- Congratulations. - Come inside.

2113
02:16:46,209 --> 02:16:47,419
Congratulations.

2114
02:16:51,629 --> 02:16:53,829
- Greetings, auntie.
- Bless you dear.

2115
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,690
- Hello, Ranjit. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2116
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:59,920
Father is ill.
That's why he's not here.

2117
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:02,360
- He sent me.
- It's good, dear.

2118
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:03,910
You have come.

2119
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:06,960
But, Ranjit is upset.

2120
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:10,320
Am I fighting with you?

2121
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:12,090
- How sweet.
- Yes.

2122
02:17:14,139 --> 02:17:15,709
Come in. Be seated.

2123
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:21,690
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

2124
02:17:29,809 --> 02:17:31,109
Who is he?

2125
02:17:32,209 --> 02:17:33,729
He appears like a saint.

2126
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,410
Come in, sir.

2127
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:44,930
- Yes, sir.
- Tell me, Mr. Dwarkanath.

2128
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:48,670
There's so much pomp
in the daughter's marriage.

2129
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:50,860
It's all Lord's blessing.

2130
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,590
You are absolutely right.

2131
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:56,859
- Greetings. - Greetings.
- Welcome.

2132
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:59,420
- You?
- Have come to meet someone?

2133
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:03,400
Sir, he didn't recognize me.

2134
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:06,530
I am very sorry.

2135
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:09,510
I have come to bless my niece.

2136
02:18:09,889 --> 02:18:12,949
- Niece?
- Yes, Meena.

2137
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:17,340
- Is she your niece?
- Yes. She's my only niece.

2138
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:20,430
But, she never talked about you.

2139
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:23,810
That's why you aren't aware of us.

2140
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:26,990
- He is very innocent.
- Yes.

2141
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,100
Dear, I have lived
my life in South Africa.

2142
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:34,690
When came to India,
Meena wasn't yet born.

2143
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,610
Yes you are right.

2144
02:18:37,070 --> 02:18:41,870
As we're in India,
we've come to attend her marriage.

2145
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:46,230
Assume she is my niece
as well as my daughter.

2146
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:49,090
And I even have to give her a dowry.

2147
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:51,650
- Am I right?
- Yes.

2148
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:54,620
We're very proud
you're attending the marriage.

2149
02:18:55,190 --> 02:18:56,660
I'm Meena's mother-in-law.

2150
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:59,490
Very good. Then we
have to embrace each other.

2151
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:01,880
No. No. You can't do that.

2152
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:06,500
This tradition is not in India.
It is only in South Africa.

2153
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:09,930
Yes. You have saved me.

2154
02:19:10,410 --> 02:19:12,140
This is my son, Ranjit.

2155
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:14,299
- He is marrying Meena.
- Really?

2156
02:19:14,350 --> 02:19:17,535
- I can embrace him, right?
- Yes.

2157
02:19:17,559 --> 02:19:20,349
You can.

2158
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:25,050
- Sir, let me also.
- Yes. - No.

2159
02:19:25,150 --> 02:19:28,700
I am not satisfied.

2160
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:30,749
Come closer to me.

2161
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:33,740
- Are you satisfied now?
- Sir.

2162
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:36,690
Ranjit.

2163
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:40,080
I am not yet satisfied.

2164
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:42,860
I'm very pleased to meet you.

2165
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:47,700
Take a seat. I'll call Meena.

2166
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:51,350
Meena. Meena.

2167
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:53,330
See, who have come.

2168
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,040
Shall I get something to eat?

2169
02:19:56,130 --> 02:19:57,750
Yes.

2170
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:00,930
I've come directly from Africa.
I'm very hungry.

2171
02:20:00,970 --> 02:20:03,430
I'll get it right away. Ramu. Ramu.

2172
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:05,640
- Yes.
- Be seated.

2173
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:08,620
Yes.

2174
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:10,530
Greetings, Meena.

2175
02:20:12,750 --> 02:20:15,500
Dear, recognize them?

2176
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:20,360
She doesn't know you.

2177
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:24,170
Oh god. How could she know?

2178
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:27,040
I'll introduce myself.
Dear, meet your uncle.

2179
02:20:28,770 --> 02:20:30,860
May I? Shall I talk with her?

2180
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:32,630
Yes. You have the right to speak.

2181
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:34,180
- Come, dear.
- Go, dear.

2182
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:37,520
Go.

2183
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:41,890
This is a private matter.

2184
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:45,760
Now do you recognize me?

2185
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:47,380
Sohan.

2186
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:50,900
Not Sohan. I'm your uncle, DwarkaDas.

2187
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:54,040
But.

2188
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:59,070
Don't you dare. If you say a word...

2189
02:20:59,490 --> 02:21:01,350
I'll reveal the truth.

2190
02:21:02,550 --> 02:21:03,640
Come.

2191
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:08,140
- Do you recognize them?
Yes.

2192
02:21:08,220 --> 02:21:10,310
Why wouldn't she?

2193
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:12,020
Am I right, dear?

2194
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:15,910
Dear, go now.
I have to take care of other guests.

2195
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:19,360
It isn't right to speak
with relatives before marriage.

2196
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:22,530
- But...
- Don't worry about ifs and buts.

2197
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,930
Don't worry about us.

2198
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:25,710
She'll look after us.

2199
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:28,340
We'll take care of her.

2200
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:31,490
Yes, we're on the same path.

2201
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:34,580
- Go, dear.
- Listen to your elders.

2202
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:36,430
Go.

2203
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:40,730
She's worried.

2204
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,620
She is in her past.

2205
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:46,470
She's an orphan.

2206
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:49,730
We're her only parents now.

2207
02:21:50,050 --> 02:21:52,980
- I'll take you to the room.
- Yes.

2208
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:54,970
Come, Mr. Sohan.

2209
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:58,670
Sorry, Mr. Dwarkanath.

2210
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:04,010
Mr. Mohan and Sohan.

2211
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:21,180
- Hello, Meena.
- You.

2212
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,730
I've come here to congratulate you.

2213
02:22:24,430 --> 02:22:25,530
What?

2214
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,370
I've come here to greet you twice.

2215
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:31,950
One is for the marriage to Ranjit.

2216
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,300
And other for meeting with your uncle.

2217
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:37,660
They seem to be very kind hearted.

2218
02:22:38,780 --> 02:22:41,270
As soon as they
received the invitation...

2219
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:42,880
they came with the dowry.

2220
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:44,880
Have you noticed?

2221
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:50,170
The look a lot like Mohan and Sohan.

2222
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:52,550
The ones that came to your office.

2223
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:56,160
Yes, I recognized
something with their names.

2224
02:22:57,150 --> 02:23:00,120
Does Ranjit know the truth
about Mohan and Sohan?

2225
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:02,620
What does it matter?

2226
02:23:03,310 --> 02:23:06,500
I know Ranjit very well.

2227
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:10,140
If he comes to know of your past...

2228
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:11,780
he won't marry you.

2229
02:23:12,130 --> 02:23:16,270
You're mistaken.

2230
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:19,060
No one can separate me from Ranjit.

2231
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:22,420
Are you fully confident on your love?

2232
02:23:22,580 --> 02:23:23,680
Yes.

2233
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:26,290
You are naïve.
You'll be betrayed.

2234
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:31,640
You don't know.
Men don't care for love.

2235
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,490
What's going on?

2236
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,160
Vimla, are you scolding Meena?

2237
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:39,610
Why would I scold Meena?

2238
02:23:39,870 --> 02:23:41,940
We were just discussing the novel.

2239
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:45,010
And the story was
only known to me and Meena.

2240
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:46,530
What was that?

2241
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:51,280
Yes, Meena. We'll leave
this matter to Ranjit.

2242
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:55,210
He is very well known as our hero.

2243
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:57,010
What's the matter?

2244
02:23:57,180 --> 02:24:04,730
A problem arises if the hero learns
she's involved with the thieves.

2245
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:06,890
Imagine you're the hero.

2246
02:24:07,580 --> 02:24:10,460
Now tell me,
will you marry her or not?

2247
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:16,540
Let her know that we
are made for each other.

2248
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:19,850
Does he know
she's involved with the thief?

2249
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,510
Yes, he knows the truth.

2250
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:24,280
But they love each other.

2251
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:27,420
As far as I'm concerned...

2252
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:31,850
reputation is more important than love.

2253
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:34,580
Forget about this talk.

2254
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:36,220
There's a lot of fun outside.

2255
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:38,300
Your uncle is very good man.

2256
02:24:38,590 --> 02:24:40,880
He's making friends with all.

2257
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:43,860
- Come. - Ranjit Kumar?
- Yes, mother.

2258
02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:50,440
Have you heard the decision?

2259
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,120
Okay, I'll take leave now.

2260
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,110
Let me watch the drama.

2261
02:25:58,290 --> 02:26:00,950
The dark clouds are gathering

2262
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:04,290
Oh beloved, don't go

2263
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:17,650
The season of love, pacify me

2264
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:30,030
The dark clouds are gathering

2265
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:33,310
Oh beloved, don't go

2266
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:53,610
After giving me hope,
why have you deserted me?

2267
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:08,590
I've put my trust in you.
Don't disappoint me

2268
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:27,560
The season of love, pacify me

2269
02:27:54,190 --> 02:28:00,230
I will yearn for you.
My tears will remember you

2270
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:15,290
Forget everything. Come and see me

2271
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:33,870
The season of love, pacify me

2272
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:38,810
The dark clouds are gathering

2273
02:28:39,010 --> 02:28:41,860
Oh beloved, don't go

2274
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:54,320
This is the new generation.

2275
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:57,180
These days,
the thieves have become more clever.

2276
02:28:57,690 --> 02:28:59,660
In a flash they rob you.

2277
02:29:00,130 --> 02:29:02,900
- Am I right?
- Yes.

2278
02:29:03,330 --> 02:29:06,300
Always these kind of discussions
take place during marriages.

2279
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:09,420
Do you remember that girl?

2280
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,530
Her entire dowry was stolen.

2281
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,420
- Everything?
- Yes.

2282
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:17,810
They came as guests.

2283
02:29:18,390 --> 02:29:20,640
They were masquerading as guests.

2284
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:26,250
We have to be very careful.

2285
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:30,380
That's why I put
Meena's jewelry in the locker.

2286
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:33,480
- Do you have a locker?
- Yes.

2287
02:29:34,170 --> 02:29:36,460
I always carry my locker with me.

2288
02:29:37,150 --> 02:29:40,260
This is new generation.
Anything can happen.

2289
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:43,780
- Am I right?
- Yes. Safety first.

2290
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:46,060
There is no doubt.

2291
02:29:46,570 --> 02:29:48,580
Everything might be lost
during the marriages.

2292
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:50,240
You are right.

2293
02:29:51,550 --> 02:29:53,510
Your necklace is very expensive..

2294
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:58,870
Maybe someone is looking to rob you.

2295
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:00,720
What?

2296
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:03,830
They'll never live the proof.

2297
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:08,670
Sir, can you put
my jewelry in your locker?

2298
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:11,720
No. I'm not going to
take this responsibility.

2299
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:13,900
Please, sir.

2300
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:15,330
Yes.

2301
02:30:16,770 --> 02:30:18,440
- Mr. Dwarkanath.
- Yes?

2302
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:22,730
Never say no.
You have to help everyone.

2303
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,260
Do good. Expect good.

2304
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:28,810
- Really?
- Yes.

2305
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:32,470
Then, take all the jewelry from them.

2306
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,260
Okay. As you say.

2307
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:35,780
Give it to me.

2308
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:39,686
Their loss is also like our loss.

2309
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:40,930
Yes.

2310
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,130
- We have to take care of all.
- Yes.

2311
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,800
These are very expensive pieces.

2312
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:50,620
Madam, you also give.

2313
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,550
No, thanks. I'll take care of them.

2314
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:55,380
You please help them.

2315
02:31:07,690 --> 02:31:10,560
Meena, why don't you
put your jewelry in the safe?

2316
02:31:10,990 --> 02:31:12,700
This place isn't safe.

2317
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:14,336
What?

2318
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:20,460
Your uncle is like a God.

2319
02:31:20,860 --> 02:31:24,940
He's taken all the jewelry
and put it in the safe.

2320
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,720
To protect it from theft.

2321
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:28,700
What?

2322
02:31:29,730 --> 02:31:31,310
But, why are you worried?

2323
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:34,130
He has taken them for safety.

2324
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,380
Make it fast.

2325
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:43,850
Very good.

2326
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:47,470
Wait. Wait.

2327
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,840
For God's sake, wait.

2328
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:04,540
Take this.

2329
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:06,710
Let's follow them.

2330
02:32:08,330 --> 02:32:09,680
Faster.

2331
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:11,080
Drive fast.

2332
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:14,990
Meena.

2333
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:17,560
Right now, Vimla is here.

2334
02:32:17,730 --> 02:32:19,030
Where is Meena?

2335
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:24,230
She is safe and
she is with her uncles.

2336
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:27,400
- What do you mean?
- Mr. Ranjit, I mean...

2337
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:32,720
they are Mohan and Sohan,
not Meena's uncles.

2338
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:35,770
And Meena is their partner.

2339
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:38,000
There they go.

2340
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:47,900
Drive fast. Faster!

2341
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:49,860
C'mon! Hurry up!

2342
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:53,010
She's coming up behind!
Drive faster!

2343
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:54,590
Faster! Even faster!

2344
02:32:57,870 --> 02:32:59,000
Faster!

2345
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:01,070
She's coming closer! Faster!

2346
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:14,720
Go faster!

2347
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,630
Drive fast! Drive even faster!

2348
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,940
Not there, here!

2349
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:29,320
Fast.

2350
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:32,040
What are you doing?

2351
02:34:32,670 --> 02:34:34,760
Why stay in back?
Drive faster!

2352
02:34:39,950 --> 02:34:42,070
What are you doing?
Don't you know how to drive?

2353
02:34:54,300 --> 02:34:57,290
- Oh my god.
- Stop it. Stop it.

2354
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:04,410
Oh my god! Help! Help!

2355
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:22,050
I've become a queen.

2356
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:24,780
Let's keep on going.

2357
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:26,340
With your grace.

2358
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:31,530
Why? You don't have
to go to the company today?

2359
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:33,900
Very good.

2360
02:36:35,330 --> 02:36:36,530
Mr. Mohan.

2361
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:39,180
- Yes, Mr. Sohan.
- Now we should get out of here.

2362
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:41,160
In English, meaning go, went, gone.

2363
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:44,130
Very good. Or else,
all of them will come here.

2364
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:46,600
First, we had to run after Meena.

2365
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:48,630
Now Meena will have to run after us.

2366
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:51,010
How will Meena find us?

2367
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:55,110
To find you, even if I had
to search the whole world...

2368
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:56,780
I would do it.

2369
02:36:57,660 --> 02:37:00,360
Here, it was
difficult to ask the way and come.

2370
02:37:03,390 --> 02:37:04,790
Who is with you?

2371
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:07,990
Apart from my God, nobody is with me.

2372
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:09,610
Oh, only God.

2373
02:37:11,570 --> 02:37:13,670
That's alright.
The main danger is the police.

2374
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,800
Mohan, close the door.

2375
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:22,400
Why have you come here?

2376
02:37:22,450 --> 02:37:24,000
You know why I've come.

2377
02:37:24,250 --> 02:37:26,310
You won't get back the ornaments.

2378
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,530
Give me back the ornaments.

2379
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:30,430
I'm ready to accept
all your conditions.

2380
02:37:30,590 --> 02:37:32,250
Very good.

2381
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:35,260
If we give you back the ornaments,
what's the use of conditions?

2382
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:40,460
I promise you,
I'll be with you forever.

2383
02:37:40,900 --> 02:37:42,600
Are you ready to become our partner?

2384
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:44,880
Then why do you
want back these ornaments?

2385
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:47,600
This is her trap, Mr. Sohan.

2386
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:49,760
She can't leave Ranjit.

2387
02:37:50,590 --> 02:37:52,260
I'll leave Mr. Ranjit.

2388
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:54,570
I can't bear that...

2389
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:56,600
he thinks of me as a thief.

2390
02:37:56,700 --> 02:37:58,000
And thinks that...

2391
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:00,470
I was playing with
his emotions to trap him.

2392
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:02,980
I can't fall in his eyes.

2393
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:07,370
I'm ready to make all the sacrifices.

2394
02:38:07,530 --> 02:38:09,590
I can sacrifice my love.

2395
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:11,140
Give me these ornaments.

2396
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:13,890
I beg of you. I fall at your feet.

2397
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:17,270
Don't deny my request.
Give me these ornaments.

2398
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:18,530
Never.

2399
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:21,030
Your pleas have no effect on me, Meena.

2400
02:38:21,790 --> 02:38:23,190
Have pity on me.

2401
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:25,150
I'll be your slave forever.

2402
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:26,920
We don't accept this challenge.

2403
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,680
Do whatever you want.

2404
02:38:32,190 --> 02:38:33,680
What can I do to anyone?

2405
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:39,830
I'm not worth
showing my face to Mr. Ranjit.

2406
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:42,390
What's the use of my living?

2407
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,710
What do I have to gain from life? Yes...

2408
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:47,880
I can give up my life.

2409
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:49,350
Who's stopping you?

2410
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:51,530
We won't be frightened
by this suicidal threat.

2411
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:55,850
Suicide is not a threat.

2412
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:58,480
It's the only solution to my problems.

2413
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:18,600
Brother Sohan?

2414
02:39:18,970 --> 02:39:21,460
- What is it?
- That poor girl will die.

2415
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:25,370
10,000 people die and
are born every day in India.

2416
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:27,300
Today it'll be 10,001.

2417
02:39:27,970 --> 02:39:29,570
But we'll be blamed for her murder.

2418
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:31,310
Then what should we do?

2419
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:33,670
I think...

2420
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:40,950
If you want this...

2421
02:39:41,410 --> 02:39:43,160
then return your share of the goods.

2422
02:39:43,890 --> 02:39:45,950
Half her murder charge will be on me.

2423
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:47,480
I'll handle that.

2424
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:49,420
Take this.

2425
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:54,390
You should not be
so coldhearted, brother.

2426
02:39:55,310 --> 02:39:57,640
Someone is dying and
your heart doesn't even wrench.

2427
02:39:58,340 --> 02:39:59,740
Come, let's save Meena.

2428
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:02,840
Maybe God will forgive some of our sins.

2429
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:05,980
We've an opportunity
to start a new life.

2430
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:08,780
Come.

2431
02:40:13,710 --> 02:40:14,860
Meena.

2432
02:40:15,430 --> 02:40:17,180
Sister Meena, listen.

2433
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:32,880
Sister, sister Meena.

2434
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:36,600
On a sister's wedding,
this is a gift from the brother.

2435
02:40:39,390 --> 02:40:41,350
Yes, count it.
Check if anything's missing.

2436
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:45,950
This gift was from, Mr. Mohan.

2437
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:49,790
And from me,
you're not accused of any murder.

2438
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:52,930
So, now I'm not accused
of the murder?

2439
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:55,080
Neither then, nor now.

2440
02:40:55,540 --> 02:40:59,840
The real culprit was caught
the day after Ram Das' murder.

2441
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:02,480
I'm free.

2442
02:41:02,650 --> 02:41:03,880
Totally free.

2443
02:41:04,150 --> 02:41:05,480
Like the open air.

2444
02:41:05,560 --> 02:41:07,720
Now, either take Ranjit or leave him.

2445
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:09,990
That's your choice, not ours.

2446
02:41:11,790 --> 02:41:14,630
How should I thank you people?

2447
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:17,730
Sister Meena,
don't waste your time in thanking us.

2448
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:20,330
Let it not happen,
that you keep thanking us...

2449
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:22,100
and we change our minds.

2450
02:41:22,290 --> 02:41:23,900
After all, it's a matter of ornaments.

2451
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:26,340
Okay, I'll leave.

2452
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:28,170
- Bye, bye.
- Cheerio.

2453
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:32,650
Bye, bye.

2454
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:36,320
- Mr. Mohan.
- Yes, Mr. Sohan.

2455
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:38,630
Today, we've done a very good job.

2456
02:41:39,170 --> 02:41:40,440
Yes, too much.

2457
02:41:41,630 --> 02:41:44,100
- Have you noted it?
- Oh. Very good note.

2458
02:41:44,570 --> 02:41:46,780
- Thank you.
- What?

2459
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,110
Inspector Kumatrahe.

2460
02:41:52,230 --> 02:41:53,530
Not there, here.

2461
02:41:55,590 --> 02:41:57,320
There they are. Let's go there.

2462
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:08,760
- Halt.
- Why?

2463
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:15,170
Friend, one good work you did.

2464
02:42:15,610 --> 02:42:16,930
To free Meena.

2465
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:19,400
Now, I'll do one.
Get ourselves arrested.

2466
02:42:19,650 --> 02:42:21,820
Arrested? Are you out of your mind?

2467
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:24,610
I'm saying it because
I'm in my senses.

2468
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:26,640
After all that's happened?

2469
02:42:27,380 --> 02:42:29,400
Meena's words have had an effect on me.

2470
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:31,550
In this crime life...

2471
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:33,130
there's nothing.

2472
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:35,680
For how long can
we keep running from the law?

2473
02:42:35,810 --> 02:42:38,250
As long as there's hope,
there's freedom.

2474
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,760
What kind of a freedom is this?

2475
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:42,560
To jump at every sound.

2476
02:42:42,730 --> 02:42:44,260
To run at every danger.

2477
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:45,920
No peace in the day.

2478
02:42:45,950 --> 02:42:47,360
No sleep at night.

2479
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,660
This is a false freedom.

2480
02:42:50,270 --> 02:42:51,740
Then what's your advice?

2481
02:42:52,850 --> 02:42:55,500
The advice is this;
let's surrender ourselves to the law...

2482
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:57,370
and change our lives.

2483
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:04,380
Good.

2484
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:18,470
Seeta Devi...

2485
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:21,240
you'll have to repay our full loss.

2486
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:23,020
You'd called us here to trap us.

2487
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:25,110
You found a nice daughter-in-law.

2488
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,480
A world wide thief.

2489
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:28,370
Now, why don't you talk?

2490
02:43:29,240 --> 02:43:30,640
What should I say, sister?

2491
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:32,990
I am not in my senses.

2492
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:36,210
The girl was so innocent.

2493
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:38,840
I still can't believe, mother,
that Meena is a thief.

2494
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:41,180
Whether you believe or not...

2495
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:43,100
we want our ornaments.

2496
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:45,090
Otherwise, we'll report to the police.

2497
02:43:45,270 --> 02:43:46,990
You're shouting at him unnecessarily.

2498
02:43:47,870 --> 02:43:49,616
The betrayal that
has taken place with you...

2499
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:51,390
the same thing happened
to Mr. Ranjit.

2500
02:43:51,740 --> 02:43:53,720
How could he have
known she was a thief?

2501
02:43:53,830 --> 02:43:55,500
Yes, he's very innocent.

2502
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:58,000
He was innocent.
That's why he suffered a loss.

2503
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:00,470
You people have lost
only ornaments and money.

2504
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:03,080
He has lost his name and respect.

2505
02:44:03,530 --> 02:44:05,240
We don't want to listen to your nonsense.

2506
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:06,810
We want our ornaments.

2507
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:16,170
Here, your ornaments.

2508
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:20,340
Here.

2509
02:44:20,390 --> 02:44:22,290
- My ornaments.
- My bangles.

2510
02:44:22,490 --> 02:44:23,676
My necklace.

2511
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:25,480
- My ring.
- This is my necklace.

2512
02:44:25,530 --> 02:44:27,200
My ring.

2513
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,670
I think she's playing
another trick on us.

2514
02:44:43,230 --> 02:44:44,590
I want forgiveness.

2515
02:44:45,230 --> 02:44:47,730
Because of me you were humiliated.

2516
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:49,970
Forgive me.

2517
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:56,120
I tried many times,
to tell you about me.

2518
02:44:57,140 --> 02:44:59,420
I didn't want to keep you in darkness.

2519
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:01,460
That's why...

2520
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:03,970
I tried to leave you once.

2521
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:08,300
But you compelled me to come back.

2522
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:12,790
In your love, I forgot the reality.

2523
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:16,640
Now, all I want to say is...

2524
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:18,960
whatever happened in my past life...

2525
02:45:19,430 --> 02:45:21,550
has happened due to my bad luck.

2526
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:23,960
And due to my bad character.

2527
02:45:24,890 --> 02:45:27,290
I've never tried to trick anyone.

2528
02:45:28,150 --> 02:45:30,350
I myself got tricked by my destiny.

2529
02:45:31,150 --> 02:45:32,760
That was my sin.

2530
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:41,570
The trick to return
the ornaments was good.

2531
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:44,370
But, unfortunately, it didn't work.

2532
02:45:46,530 --> 02:45:47,780
Sister Vimla...

2533
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:49,620
I want to ask forgiveness
from you, too.

2534
02:45:50,600 --> 02:45:53,920
I stole what you deserved,
by coming between you and Ranjit.

2535
02:45:54,750 --> 02:45:56,660
Who can steal
someone from what he deserves?

2536
02:45:57,190 --> 02:45:59,190
Destiny had made Ranjit for me.

2537
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:01,720
Who are you to change destiny?

2538
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:11,160
Boatman, bring it here.

2539
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,700
Take me to the other side.

2540
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:34,770
Ranjit?

2541
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:37,420
Ranjit! Ranjit!

2542
02:46:38,170 --> 02:46:39,980
Wait! Where are you going?

2543
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:41,940
I'll come with you.

2544
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:44,630
Only one passenger can come in the boat.

2545
02:46:44,950 --> 02:46:46,150
Ranjit!

2546
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:40,330
There's an agreement...

2547
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:43,640
of love

2548
02:47:58,910 --> 02:48:02,990
What are your eyes saying?

2549
02:48:03,070 --> 02:48:05,560
Don't ask anything

2550
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:09,410
Enough. Don't ask anything

2551
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:23,360
The hearts have met...

2552
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:31,440
along with the eyes

2553
02:48:36,580 --> 02:48:39,770
It's a thing to ask but...

2554
02:48:40,100 --> 02:48:42,690
Don't ask anything

2555
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:46,610
Enough. Don't ask anything

2556
02:48:46,710 --> 02:48:50,810
Now, the condition of the heart
and the condition of the life

2557
02:48:51,090 --> 02:48:53,450
Don't ask anything

2558
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:57,680
Enough. Don't ask anything.

2559
02:48:57,990 --> 02:49:02,060
Who has felt what...

2560
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:04,640
Don't ask anything

2561
02:49:04,730 --> 02:49:08,580
Enough. Don't ask anything
