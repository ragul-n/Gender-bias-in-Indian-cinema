1
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,051
Billa here

2
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:24,766
Billa why are you looking
stright, look at the right.

3
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:49,315
Brother..

4
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,160
We have seized all the dens
of Aslam and Billa.

5
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,160
All his business and his men
are under our control.

6
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:04,508
Chamunda brothers have
made a name, brother.

7
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,500
Entire Mumbai shudders at the sight of these brothers.

8
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:14,307
The best thing will be when
Aslam and Billa's right hand..

9
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,507
..Bhushan will be in our control.

10
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,983
- What is the use brother?
- He is a golden goose.

11
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,309
By confining him we
can find out about the..

12
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:31,609
..billions of dollar deal that Aslam
was going to do after two days.

13
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,799
But brothers in a short time
to get him out of the police custody

14
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,343
..is not only difficult,
but is impossible.

15
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:44,236
Chhagan. On this earth the history..

16
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:48,304
..always repeats itself.

17
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,838
Just go through the pages of
history, you will get the story.

18
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:57,943
- Inspector Shinde.
- Yes sir.

19
00:03:58,143 --> 00:03:59,143
- Is everything alright?
- Yes sir.

20
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,643
- All arrangements are done?
- Yes sir.

21
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:06,843
Alright sir...tomorrow
at 7:30am sharp.

22
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:04,750
- Father please save me!
- Ajay!

23
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:09,305
Please save me father!
- Welcome minister.

24
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:13,105
Thanks a lot for handing
over Bhushan to me.

25
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,305
Leave my son!

26
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,005
We will surely leave him
but after the task is over.

27
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:21,205
Did you forget that according to your promise
you have us get across the border?

28
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:26,405
I know it..that is why
I got the car along.

29
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:27,305
Very good.

30
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:28,905
Whoever you are.. 

31
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,916
 ..just remember that you cannot 
play with the law time and again.

32
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:39,776
Minister such is our relation with the law.

33
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:44,088
By arresting Bhushan
the law had made us helpless.

34
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:48,586
And to free him, we have
made the law powerless.

35
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,455
Please hand over my son.

36
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,020
What is the hurry minister?
Till such time..

37
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,320
..we all don't cross the border..

38
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,720
..you and your son shall
be in our custody.

39
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,705
Are you alright?
- Yes papa.

40
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,415
Inspector Arjun.

41
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,990
Valorous people like you
are the strength of the law.

42
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,990
Keep the good work.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

43
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,703
Brother.. I'm very sorry to
hear about Jagan's death.

44
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,444
I'am also very sad.

45
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:09,562
But the inspector who killed him
is alive yet.

46
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,689
He will also died brother.

47
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,540
To live and die
is the doctrine of our business.

48
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,784
But the regret is only
of one thing.

49
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,019
We still haven't got hold
of..

50
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:27,719
.. that rascal Bhushan 
for whom Jagan gave up his life.

51
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,419
Bushan was one of your enemies.

52
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:34,219
Yes he was, but we
caught him alive..

53
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,619
..then it would have been
very beneficial for us.

54
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,791
Because he wasn't
a man but a Gold mine.

55
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,873
But that inspector ruined
our entire plan.

56
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:47,973
Brother if you say the
that inspector.. - No.

57
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,714
..not yet.
This is not the time.

58
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,627
It is the guideline
of our business that..

59
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,616
..keep doing your work silently.

60
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,600
And hide yourself from all,
as far as possible.

61
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,357
To raise a hand on
a police man means..

62
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,157
..to come into the limelight.

63
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,867
To kill him we will have
to wait for the right time..

64
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,867
..and the right opportunity.

65
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:15,367
But brother..
- Chhagan is right.

66
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:19,239
My I come sir?
- Come in.

67
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,342
There is an important
message for you,..

68
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,742
..the dreaded terrorist
Bhaktawar Singh..

69
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,842
..has escaped from the jail
along with his accomplice.

70
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,542
What?  Bhaktawar has escaped?
-Yes sir.

71
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,942
Just 2 days before after
a dangerous encounter Bhishma,..

72
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,442
..had arrested him on the border.

73
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:38,642
Commander Shakti Singh.
Where is Bhishma?

74
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:41,542
The humanity cannot be wiped
out even if the man is.

75
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:47,042
No matter what strategies
are planned by the devils.

76
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:50,242
So says this earth and
so does the sky..

77
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,242
The savior of righteousness
is the greatest.

78
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,510
Whenever the Satanic
rule will encourage..

79
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,010
..injustice and inmorality.

80
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,110
And then will arrive
the destroyers ot he evil.

81
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,310
And this is a challenge.

82
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:30,645
Bhaktawar..Jagawar has helped
you evade the arrest.

83
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,207
You would have barely managed
to make two ends meet..

84
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:44,007
..even if you served for you entire life.

85
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,407
This reward of Bhaktawar
filthy rich sepoy.

86
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,059
You haven't done a great favor
by giving this money.

87
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,659
Bhaktawar..don't waste your time
in these useless talks..

88
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,411
Hereafter also you
might require me.

89
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:14,311
Hey you, I give money
and get my work done.

90
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:18,111
If not you then some other
colleague of yours will do.

91
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,485
Bhaktawar!

92
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,352
Attention everybody.
Put of the fire.

93
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,680
Throw the lights.

94
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,584
Boys..Fire.

95
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,357
Bhishma?

96
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,340
I made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

97
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:12,465
You keep this but
please leave me.

98
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,140
Inspector Jagawar..
looking at your face.

99
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:22,696
Today Bhishma hates  both the law

100
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,188
and the protectors of the law.

101
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,731
I don't want to hear any
of your explanations Bhishma.

102
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,731
Sir I..- Do you know how many
blunders you've made?

103
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:48,631
The first mistake..

104
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,367
..that without  the orders
of the Platoon commander of the reigment..

105
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,867
..you started off to finish
Bhaktawar and his gang.

106
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,867
If I waited for the orders then
I'd have lost one day of leave.

107
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,867
Second mistake was that you
shot at, inspector Jagawar.

108
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,100
Sir, that inspector had helped
Bhaktawar to escape.

109
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,967
Shut up!
- He was bribed by Bhaktawar.

110
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:04,667
Just shut up!

111
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:08,275
By killing a security officer
you have become a murderer Bhishma.

112
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:11,175
If a protector of the nation kills a traitor
and is the branded as a criminal..

113
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,675
... then I do no respect such a law.

114
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,200
Even if I had got him alive to you

115
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,455
..then your lethargic legal
laws would have tried him..

116
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:21,855
..for years and would have
acquitted him as an innocent.

117
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:24,055
Then you are suspended.
For two months.

118
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:25,625
I do not mind sir.

119
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,910
And you can go now.
-Thank you very much.

120
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,856
Major, you had been asked to report,
what is the matter?

121
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:47,056
Nothing just that my one month's leave has
been extended to two months.

122
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,825
Now I will coolly go to my village
and enjoy my mother's cooking.

123
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,125
And have fun with my two brothers.

124
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:26,155
Oh no Bahadur Singh,
this girl is in a bad shape.

125
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:28,155
She should be reached
to the hospital, come on.

126
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,009
Sister,...please do not worry.

127
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,709
I will take you to the hospital..come.

128
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:38,209
Come..take it easy.

129
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,315
- My neck. - Come on
out with your purse.

130
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,234
I'm a sepoy.- Keep it
to your police station.

131
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:58,834
Remove your purse.
- I will remove it, wait.

132
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:02,334
This has my salary
of the month...oh my neck.

133
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:05,134
It's a hand or a hammer!

134
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,706
Take this baby.

135
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,671
Oh my neck.

136
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,570
She has taken my entire
salary and given me this.

137
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,822
Tea, sir. - Hasmukh Singh..

138
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,570
Where is Barood Singh?
- Sir..

139
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,452
He comes late as usual.

140
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,829
Where is the comissioner's file?
- He knows it sir.

141
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,820
Has he ever given anything.

142
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,220
Just go away from here.

143
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,444
When Barood Singh comes,
send him to me.

144
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:07,594
I'm watching since long that
you are pampering him.

145
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,294
Please have the tea,
else it will become cold.

146
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,094
Barood Singh reporting, Sir.

147
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,289
So you are here? You go.

148
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:19,511
What happened?
I was walking..

149
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,011
..now its not a fault
of a tree falling.

150
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:23,411
Yes what is the fault of the tree,..

151
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,801
..the fault is of your neck
that it came under it. - Yes sir.

152
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:28,576
Now will you do one favor?

153
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,503
Will you get commissioner's
file? - Yes, sir.

154
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,150
Then go.
- Yes sir.

155
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:38,418
Halló!

156
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,957
Today night there's a New year
Party in the hotel Blue park.

157
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,590
Where there is a drug deal
that is going to take place..

158
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,290
..with one Mr. Robert
who's come from Hong Kong..

159
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,490
..through which you can catch
many big drug dealers.

160
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,521
Halló! Halló!

161
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:31,861
"We are crazy, why are you
scared of the crazy."

162
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:35,561
"If we have to then lets
love each other my friend.

163
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,961
"What if any one obstructs
us or any one stops us."

164
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,261
"Let us acquaint
ourselves to each other."

165
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,575
"Just hear what this heart says."

166
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:24,273
"Now come into my arms."

167
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:35,163
"How can I agree to you."

168
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,304
"Any thing can happen anytime."

169
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,359
"I fear this big bad world."

170
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,851
"And I also fear a crazy being like you."

171
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:41,082
"We are crazy now
why fear the crazy?"

172
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,482
"Love as much as you
want we are ready."

173
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,276
"We are crazy now
why fear the crazy?"

174
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:51,876
"Love as much as you
want we are ready."

175
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:55,276
"What if any one obstructs
us or any one stops us."

176
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,876
"Let us acquaint
ourselves to each other."

177
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,717
Robert hand me
over that box of drugs.

178
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:50,143
Search him.

179
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:03,906
Sir,..Nothing is found on him.

180
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,391
Sir, I have understood
where the box is.

181
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:09,491
Where?

182
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,530
Excuse me!

183
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,346
See, that lane is very dark..

184
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,946
..can you drop me to the end?

185
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,179
Thank you.

186
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,179
I'm very scared of darkness.

187
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,268
Don't you feel..

188
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,468
..that these dark lanes
should have more lights?

189
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:11,468
Like this.

190
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:17,036
Remove the money from your
pocket and hand it over.

191
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:20,336
What if I don't?
- Then I will tear my clothes.

192
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:25,107
Then? - Then
I will shout loudly.

193
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:29,177
Then-Then I will
yell and gather a crowd.

194
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:31,377
And that crowd will beat you up.

195
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,379
Then?

196
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,279
After that police will come

197
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,279
Come on hurry up,
handover to me.

198
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:41,346
No I will have to.

199
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,608
You are a real great item.

200
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:32,692
What connection do you
- I don't know any Robert.

201
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:37,292
You are lying.
- No, I'm telling the truth.

202
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:39,134
Where did you deliver the box?

203
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:40,556
Which box?

204
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:43,256
The one which was given to
you by Robert in the New Year party.

205
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,925
No one had given me that box,
but I stole in thinking..

206
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,025
..I'll get some money inside.

207
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:55,026
But..then I throw it in the gutter.

208
00:24:59,302 --> 00:25:02,302
Sir, agreed that I'm a petty thief..

209
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:06,021
..but I have never allowed
anyone to touch me.

210
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:11,771
Looks like you will believe me
when I kill myself.

211
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,346
What is this nonsense?

212
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:31,129
If only someone had slapped
me like this long before.

213
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:36,795
Then probably I wouldn't be
picking pockets on the streets.

214
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:43,011
Sir, whatever I told you
till now is the truth.

215
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:46,805
If I was working
with someone like Robert..

216
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:51,153
..then you wouldn't find me
in these dark lanes..

217
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:54,602
..but some fantastic hotel or a bungalow.

218
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:02,761
See you..

219
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:09,102
.. leave this small
time robbery and..

220
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:15,606
..get married to some
good person and..

221
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:16,806
..and settle down.

222
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,161
Will you marry me?

223
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:28,856
Will you settle down with me?

224
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,794
So..are you shaken sir?

225
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
It's very easy to say..

226
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,350
..but difficult to do.

227
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,018
Barood Singh do one thing. - Yes.

228
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:26,718
Leave this girl
and give her this money.

229
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:30,471
Give her this too.

230
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:15,201
Give it me. - Hey you bald fellow stop it.

231
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:19,301
You will get suffocated.
No child don't cry.

232
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,160
Seema!

233
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
What happened?
- I told you not to do it?

234
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:34,948
Bunty.. I told you not to.
See my shirt is soiled. Seema!

235
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,418
Suraj...when did you come?

236
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:48,399
I came when my loving brother was scolding
his son Bunty for wetting his shirt..

237
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,850
.. and  was calling out to Seema.

238
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,230
Brother.. Who is this Seema?

239
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,642
I don't know of any Seema.

240
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:56,837
You are hiding it from
then your brother owns a truck.

241
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,059
And he  has traveled a lot.

242
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:04,349
Now don't hide it from me.
Tell me fast

243
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:07,069
Told you I don't know Seema.

244
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:09,069
But tell me what business are you doing?

245
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:10,386
Of transport.
How's the business doing?

246
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:13,706
I'll tell you..first take this sweet.

247
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:17,805
Brother.. I have got a very
large contract of poultry..

248
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:20,405
..to supply eggs.
- Very good!

249
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:25,144
I want you to work very hard and..

250
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,050
..excel in the business of transport.

251
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:31,057
Come on get fresh
..lets eat food and..

252
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:32,157
..tomorrow we
have to go to our village.

253
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,383
Who's here so late in the night?

254
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,783
I'll see. - Just see.
You refresh yourself.

255
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:43,986
I... - Are you Seema?

256
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:46,786
How do you know?
- I not only know you..

257
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,186
..but also your kids
and your husband too.

258
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,560
Meaning..- Have you gone mad?

259
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,349
Please don't believe him
he is mad and talk rubbish.

260
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:00,189
Please come inside.
- No I must get back..

261
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,351
..I just came to return your money.

262
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:09,141
You believed me and
made me realize my mistakes..

263
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:12,544
..that is enough for me. And yes.

264
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,970
..you manage to scare
girls by drinking ale.

265
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:20,823
I'll tell you something,
I was really scared for a while.

266
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Brother, you said
you don't know any Seema?

267
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,400
You shut up.
- Okay I'll tell her..

268
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,325
..that you got married
to her and kids..

269
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,020
Seema..please listen to me.

270
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,099
What rubbish are you talking?

271
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,899
Not rubbish but connecting your line.

272
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,499
Is this the way to connect
a line? Go from here.

273
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:47,456
This person is a truck owner.

274
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:51,006
And he himself is the driver.

275
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:55,493
I have given him a contract
of supplying eggs at my farm.

276
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:00,271
Where we supply drugs through the eggs.

277
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,265
When you have given a contract
the chap must be good.

278
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:06,648
We have many of our own trucks..

279
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:10,748
..and many drivers too.
Then why do we need him?

280
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,648
No, we do, because
this Suraj is the younger..

281
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,548
..brother of Inpector Arjun.

282
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,936
"We all are crazy people."

283
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:56,836
"Nobody can recognize us.

284
00:31:57,136 --> 00:32:00,936
"We have come here to entertain everybody."

285
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:04,036
"In an ecstatic mood
we sing songs of love."

286
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:07,236
"Hey madam, mister listen."

287
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:57,187
"The group of friends are
going in a buoyant mood."

288
00:32:57,387 --> 00:33:00,487
"On this shining path,"

289
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:03,721
"The group of friends are
going in a buoyant mood."

290
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,266
"On this shining path,"

291
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:10,641
"Hey listen you fair girl."

292
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,388
"We have come to this town."

293
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,401
"Its our age for fun and frolic."

294
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:36,671
"Neither we have worries
nor any fear."

295
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:40,063
"Its our age for fun and frolic."

296
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:43,413
"Neither we have worries
nor any fear."

297
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:46,713
"Lets have some frolic
and get some money.

298
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:50,013
"It will be great fun."

299
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:53,524
"We all are crazy here."

300
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,030
I feel very happy when all
my 3 sons are with me.

301
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:27,332
Brother why don't we
all stay together in the city?

302
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,919
We sell off all this land
and lead a peaceful life.

303
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,439
Idiots are like you, who sell
off the ancestral property..

304
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,339
..and live a life
in a strange city.

305
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,080
I'll die but, but never
sell off my ancestral property.

306
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,080
You say you never get angry
on your younger brother.

307
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,980
I just joked and
you just pounced on me.

308
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,180
Never make a joke like this ever.

309
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,170
Bhishma!

310
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:08,289
Sir!...Sir!

311
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:13,462
What is it? - Sir..

312
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:16,231
..I hope not you too.

313
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,240
Did you have also it? - Yes sir.

314
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,976
Once I fell in love with
a girl from Kolhapur.

315
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:29,493
Sir...She asked me to meet.

316
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:34,864
What did I know
that her father was a wrestler..

317
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:37,303
..he lifted me 3 times and dropped me..

318
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:38,159
..and the fourth time he said..

319
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:40,343
..that I will bury you here itself.

320
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,430
Barood Singh reporting sir.

321
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:50,277
Sir, I will go. But do
you remember what I said?

322
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,170
Yes, please go.
- Thank you sir.

323
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,971
What is the time?
- It's 12.

324
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:03,764
12 o'clock - Yes sir.

325
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:08,169
Is this police station or a theater?

326
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:18,843
Sir, some one gave you this letter.

327
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:37,354
Sir..when the person
loses sleep in the night..

328
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:39,854
..and so also the peace of mind.

329
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:43,241
Which means that she is in love.

330
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:47,445
Same are my feelings for you.

331
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,109
If you have a little
sentiment for me.

332
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,309
Then come to meet me
at Banjara Hills at 4pm. Seema.

333
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,579
The loss of sleep and peace
of mind means one is in love.

334
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:46,905
And same are my feelings for you.
If you love me..

335
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,580
"You are in my heart."

336
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,330
"You are in my heart."

337
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:27,432
"You are my life and my desire."

338
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:31,668
"You are in my heart."

339
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:36,768
"You are my life and my desire."

340
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:41,267
"You are in my heart."

341
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:46,558
"You are in my heart."

342
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:14,333
"Agreed my sweethart
you are cross with me."

343
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:19,044
"But listen to what
my heart has to say."

344
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:21,046
"Your heart is agreeing."

345
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:23,809
"But your lips say a no."

346
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,070
"I liked your style."

347
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:31,321
"There are many beautiful girls."

348
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,421
"But for me only you are the one."

349
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,221
"You are in my heart."

350
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:42,463
"You are in my heart."

351
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:01,842
"Agreed my sweetheart
you made a mistake."

352
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:06,571
"And this was one of my styles."

353
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:10,998
"How can exist getting angry on you."

354
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:15,698
"I won't be able
to live away from you."

355
00:40:15,898 --> 00:40:20,498
"My entire prestige is in your care."

356
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:24,854
"You are in my heart."

357
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:29,927
"You are in my heart."

358
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:34,427
"You are my life and my desire."

359
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:39,005
"You are in my heart."

360
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:44,069
"You are in my heart."

361
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:48,972
"You are in my heart."

362
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:53,562
"You are in my heart."

363
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,644
Come on load the goods fast.
I don't have time.

364
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:08,532
Come on uncle..don't be
lazy enter my name.

365
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,032
Hey I'm doing your work.

366
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,332
I hope you won't make
me sit here whole day.

367
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:14,232
Let me do my work.
-I don't have time.

368
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:18,732
I have to go to meet my brother.

369
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:23,023
And tell me where have I to deliver the goods.

370
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:24,523
Same to Chandni Chowk.

371
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:30,885
Powder..

372
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:36,885
Powder..  So what, you are working
since so long haven't you seen?

373
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:38,985
Are you blind? Take it.

374
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:46,002
That I will surely but,
to the police station.

375
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,476
Stop that scoundrel.
Don't let him go.

376
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,671
Wait,..don't kill him.

377
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:24,021
He will die...but that time..

378
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,426
..when he will be beneficial
for us by his death.

379
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:29,535
How can his death be
beneficial to us?

380
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,295
Its a very old story Madan.

381
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:35,182
There was a village
surrounded by thick forests.

382
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:41,711
In that jungle two dogs had
created terror instead of tigers.

383
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:46,706
The dwellers of that village were scared of
passing through the jungle.

384
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,850
Once..there came a clever
hunter in that village..

385
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:54,342
..he came to know about
the terror of those dogs.

386
00:42:55,053 --> 00:43:00,753
The hunter was unarmed
and set of with a dry bone.

387
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,347
As soon as the dogs
came in front of him..

388
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,930
..he threw that dry bone
in between the two.

389
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:13,709
After that..the bone broke
all the relations between the two of them.

390
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,179
We understood brother.

391
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:21,131
Now go and search
that other dog Bhishma..

392
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,231
..and the dry bone is here with you.

393
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:47,207
Here comes the rogue who can turn to a lie..

394
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,163
..and also a lie into a truth.

395
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,263
What is he doing in our village?

396
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,391
Listen..
-Hey you city dweller.

397
00:43:55,591 --> 00:44:01,691
You come here,
as you I will not come to you.

398
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:12,517
What is it?

399
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:15,429
Can you tell me
where does Bhishma stay?

400
00:44:16,062 --> 00:44:19,562
Who are you?
- I'm a friend.

401
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:23,594
At this time he is not at home.

402
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,294
He will be in the godown..
at the end of the lane..

403
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:29,694
..on the backside is the godown.

404
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:30,752
Thank you.

405
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,407
What is this man doing in the village?

406
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:46,004
Mangal Singh...horse from Kathiawad..

407
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:50,528
..there is something fishy.

408
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:59,612
Bhishma...- Who is it?

409
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:01,712
Who is remembering me
early in the morning?

410
00:45:05,134 --> 00:45:06,734
Is your name Bhishma?

411
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:10,834
There vill be many....in this world.

412
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:15,934
I'm that Bhishma who is
identified by Suraj and Arjun.

413
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:19,534
Then I'm in the correct place.
Arjun sent me.

414
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:21,634
Arjun sent you, then
why didn't you tell me?

415
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:23,834
Why are you standing out.
Come and sit here.

416
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,181
How are Arjun and Suraj,
are they allright?

417
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:29,581
They are not okay.

418
00:45:30,212 --> 00:45:31,712
That is why I had to come here.

419
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:35,505
Don't talk in riddles,
tell me soon what happened?

420
00:45:35,705 --> 00:45:38,405
Are they in trouble?
- Looks like you are naive.

421
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:40,973
That is why I have
my sympathy with you.

422
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:43,169
I don't have courage to relate what I'm..

423
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,569
..going to looking at your innocence.

424
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:50,743
But what to do my profession do it.

425
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,243
If you talk in riddles
I will break your head.

426
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:54,843
Tell me what is the matter?

427
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,943
Arjun has asked his share
of from the ancestral property.

428
00:46:02,402 --> 00:46:04,702
Scoundrel..are you drunk?

429
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:08,384
You lawyer dare you
talk this about my brother!

430
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:12,084
The sun my rise in the west but
my Arjun can never do such a thing.

431
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:16,084
My brother cannot act so demeaning.

432
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:18,484
You are lying.
- What is the need for me too?

433
00:46:18,684 --> 00:46:20,484
My profession is law.

434
00:46:20,684 --> 00:46:22,584
If you don't pay heed to my request then..

435
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:24,984
..he will have to go to court.

436
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:27,484
What rubbish are you
talking about my brother?

437
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,400
You scoundrel.

438
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,900
You won't agree till I pull out your tongue.

439
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,300
Then do it!
- Stop it you two.

440
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:38,312
I'm just acting on his behalf
he has sent me here as a lawyer.

441
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:40,664
What do I know about the
feud between you two brothers.

442
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:44,511
If you don't believe it then see.

443
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:50,429
Look at this..
.. this is the summon.

444
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:51,975
And here is the notice. Hold it.

445
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,730
Mangal Singh this is right opportunity.

446
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,530
A step brother remain a stepbrother after all.

447
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:09,739
He is my flesh and blood my own.

448
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:13,539
Whom should I tell,
that my son is a defector?

449
00:47:15,777 --> 00:47:17,377
Probably the fault lies with me.

450
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:31,067
Hey you city dweller...
with Bhishma?

451
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:34,267
You said that Bhishma is your friend.

452
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:38,772
How did this turn into an enmity?

453
00:47:38,972 --> 00:47:42,072
What have you got to do?
- I have it..

454
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:45,003
The willage dweller Mangal Singh..

455
00:47:47,256 --> 00:47:50,656
..One piece horse from Kathiawad,

456
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:53,016
So what can I do?

457
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:56,016
I haven't unterstood one thing..

458
00:47:57,413 --> 00:48:02,113
Arjun who was devoted to his brother Bhishma..

459
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,970
..has changed or has been changed.

460
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:09,523
What do you know about Arjun?

461
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,981
I know him very well.

462
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:15,824
Both respect me a lot.

463
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,140
I have to avenge
an old deal with Bhishma.

464
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:29,727
Sir, if you get togheter with me..

465
00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:35,134
..then Bhishma can be ruined.

466
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:38,994
- How is that? - Look here..

467
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,870
..Bhishma thinks of me as his friend..

468
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,270
..then I'll take advantage
of that friendship.

469
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,562
What are you trying to say?

470
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:52,762
Sir..its an era of inflation..

471
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:56,404
..and by becoming a traitor
On can gain a lot of prosperity.

472
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,290
Then it is not termed
as betrayal. Understand?

473
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:05,196
You look like a gunk but
are a clever plotter.

474
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:09,776
This is what I wanted
to make you understand.

475
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,749
I'm that even an ant can.

476
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:18,049
..make a biggest elephant
fall on the ground.

477
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:20,328
Come with me.

478
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:26,671
Oh my God...Mangal Singh..

479
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:30,434
..you have come
to the right place.

480
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,734
Looks like your luck is shining upon you.

481
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:37,811
I have come to Mumbai many times..

482
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:41,255
..but never seen such a extravaganza.

483
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:45,355
This is a theatrics.

484
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,933
So he is that sample.
-Hey sir..

485
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:13,054
I'm not a sample...
But mangal Singh.

486
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:16,659
One piece horse from Kathiawad.

487
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:20,922
Madan..have you explained
to him what he has to do?

488
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:25,422
I understand everything..
you mean that..

489
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:30,022
..I have destroy the entire family in one shot.

490
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:33,122
Then think that the family is destroyed.

491
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:35,652
Think it once again Mangal.

492
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:38,254
On one hand is the
intelligent Arjun and..

493
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,954
..on other hand is the iron man Bhishma

494
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:45,434
What is there to think?

495
00:50:45,634 --> 00:50:48,534
So what if Arjun is a police officer..

496
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:51,834
..I have seen him growing since childhood..

497
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:57,574
Only Bhishma is the one
who has the real wealth..

498
00:50:57,974 --> 00:50:59,474
If it wasn't for the that.

499
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,674
The he wouldn't have been
anywhere near me.

500
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,585
Now that Bhishma will know.

501
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:11,005
What is Mangal.

502
00:51:21,742 --> 00:51:24,242
Mangal Singh? - Yes, I went to your..

503
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:28,042
..police station..there I
came to know you are at home..

504
00:51:28,242 --> 00:51:29,442
..so I come here.

505
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:31,142
What is the matter?

506
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:34,316
You come and have your food,..

507
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:36,616
..or else after  hearing me
you will not be able to eat.

508
00:51:37,058 --> 00:51:39,058
What happened?
What all hasn't.

509
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:43,666
You are such a big police
officer, but very naive.

510
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:48,462
You are such a big police
officer, but very naive.

511
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:52,975
..but now my conscience
has dragged me here.

512
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:55,794
I don't want that you should..

513
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:57,473
What happened to Bhishma?

514
00:51:57,673 --> 00:51:59,073
Where is your brother Bhishma..

515
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:02,373
He used to lavish affection
on you and your brother.

516
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,660
But for the property he
has changed his stance. - Mangal!

517
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,160
You don't know Arjun..

518
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,360
..this greed for property is such.

519
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,833
Once that greed enter ones mind..

520
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:18,133
..then that breaks
all the relations.

521
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:21,633
And as it is Bhishma is
not your real brother.

522
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,533
After all he is a step brother.

523
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:28,266
By calling Bhishma a stepbrother,
you have managed to break

524
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:30,809
..all old relations
now if you utter one more word..

525
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:32,809
..the I'll break you to pieces.

526
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:35,309
Beat me as much as you like.

527
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:38,109
I came to you thinking
of you as my close kin..

528
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:40,809
..go and save your brother Suraj.

529
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,249
What happened to Suraj?
Tell me the truth.

530
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,949
The division of property
is there is every house.

531
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,759
But no brother snatches
any brother's share.

532
00:52:54,065 --> 00:52:56,565
I have heard Bhishma
saying that..

533
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,765
..that he will kill Suraj.

534
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:02,497
But will not part with the
third share of the property.

535
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,800
I'm telling you that
he will ruin you both.

536
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:08,581
You both are step brothers.

537
00:53:09,706 --> 00:53:12,006
You are talking about
the share to Arjun..

538
00:53:12,744 --> 00:53:15,944
..you scoundrel.

539
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:19,944
I know Arjun very well..

540
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:21,944
Get out of here.

541
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,909
Dare you come here with
your rotten tongue..

542
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:27,709
..You donkey from Kathiawad.

543
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,950
Arjun is not only my  brother
but my life he is the light of my house.

544
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:33,221
What of property..I can give my life for him.

545
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:39,521
I knew it, that truth
will thing Bhishma

546
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:43,321
..many times light of the
house can put the house afire.

547
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:47,621
My name is Mangal Singh
..from Kathiawad I'll see you.

548
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,781
Water.

549
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:39,955
It is your bad luck
that you  are the younger brother

550
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:42,063
..of inspector Arjun
who killed my brother Chhagan.

551
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,005
After dying today
when go to God tell him..

552
00:54:46,205 --> 00:54:48,805
..never to make you Arjun's brother
in any of your rebirths.

553
00:54:50,442 --> 00:54:55,442
Or else you will get killed by Chamunda
every time like this.

554
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,350
Very good....Mangal Singh.

555
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,950
Horse from Kathiawad.

556
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:18,176
In my childhood my mother told
me that an astrologer..

557
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:24,376
..predicted that
I have a astrologer right?

558
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:25,276
Yes, Mangal Singh.

559
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,910
The astrologer was right.

560
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:36,099
But one of your job is still
remaining  Mangal Singh.

561
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:39,394
That will also be done.

562
00:55:39,594 --> 00:55:42,594
Why are you worried
when I'm there.

563
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:45,253
Let me enjoy this
royal treatment.

564
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:48,988
That you have to for your
entire life. Mangal.

565
00:55:49,598 --> 00:55:51,398
First do this job.

566
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,280
Hey you.. if anyone disturbs
me while eating..

567
00:55:58,524 --> 00:56:00,524
..then I don't like it.

568
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,524
Now this is an important job
hence I will do, understand.

569
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,660
Hello..
- This is Mangal Singh.

570
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:18,466
Yes Mangal, struck..

571
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:24,897
Everything ruined,
I told you ..

572
00:56:25,097 --> 00:56:27,897
...before that Bhishma
has gone crazy.

573
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:30,497
If you want to save
your brother then..

574
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:34,497
..go to the garde
of Danapur and see him.

575
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:39,313
Over..your job is done.

576
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:41,995
Now let me eat. Yes.

577
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:48,014
No Mangal...another small
job is left as yet.

578
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:54,217
Surely the astrologer told your mother
that you have royal fortune

579
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,378
... in your luck.

580
00:56:56,899 --> 00:57:00,099
But he forgot to tell
you mother probably..

581
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:04,391
..that you are destined
to die enjoying the same.

582
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,391
What are you doing?

583
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:29,358
Suraj! Look here
your brother Arjun! Suraj!

584
00:58:41,636 --> 00:58:43,436
Bhishma!

585
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:08,771
Arjun..you?

586
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:14,566
By killing my brother you have
proved that. - What? Suraj?

587
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:18,066
Don't try and act come with me.

588
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:41,124
Arjun..Bhishma.
You are fighting here and there..

589
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,624
..your brother's coffin is waiting.

590
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:29,194
Light the pyre Bhishma.
- Wait.

591
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,222
I will light the pyre.

592
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:40,233
I will not let those hands light the pyre,
who have killed Suraj.

593
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:43,713
Who has hands full of blood
that I know very well. - Arjun!

594
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:46,613
I can answer that too.

595
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:51,488
But at the moment I want
to light my brother's pyre.

596
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:54,688
Don't call him your brother.
You are the murderer.

597
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:33,635
Look has this..tornado created..

598
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,480
...any less a havoc in
my house than this storm?

599
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:43,022
This darkness is not only
outside but in our hearts.

600
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:46,369
In such a stormy night..

601
01:01:46,918 --> 01:01:51,418
..when your father left
me alone in this world.

602
01:01:52,457 --> 01:01:56,557
I embraced my three
kids and thought..

603
01:01:57,294 --> 01:02:00,894
..that my kids will make
my abode into a heaven.

604
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:04,355
And will get me out of this sorrow.

605
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:10,673
But..today the same sorrow..

606
01:02:11,097 --> 01:02:12,997
..has become a bane in my life.

607
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:18,643
My innocent Suraj has parted away from me.

608
01:02:18,843 --> 01:02:21,143
The light of the pyre is not yet over..

609
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:24,043
..mother's tears too haven't
stopped flowing.

610
01:02:24,243 --> 01:02:27,343
And you all have already
murdered my belief in you.

611
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:30,821
You both are thirsty
for each other's blood?

612
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:34,664
Mother, if a man is
thirsty with greed..

613
01:02:34,864 --> 01:02:37,364
..then he can murder any
amount of relations.

614
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:41,464
You are right it is the greed that made..

615
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:43,464
..you kill your brother.

616
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:49,664
I did not murder Suraj but you can do
anything to fulfill your dirty plans.

617
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:52,264
Arjun!
- Have you gone mad Bhishma?

618
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:54,264
Not me mother
but he has gone crazy.

619
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:59,838
He has killed Suraj.
- Not me but you have killed him.

620
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:02,599
You ask Mangal Singh
he was the witness.

621
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,899
No Mangal Singh.

622
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:06,599
That lawyer will give evidence
regarding your since.

623
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,499
As you had asked for your
share in the property

624
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:12,899
Lawyer! Division, now what
is this new plot of yours?

625
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:16,699
Why are you two brothers
in the dark, who is this Mangal Singh?

626
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:17,899
And who is this lawyer?

627
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:22,012
Some one has made you a victim
of their dirty scheme.

628
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:32,031
Just think..when Suraj was
even in a little distress..

629
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:35,831
..you both would be so tormented.

630
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:41,031
Can any of you ever kill
someone who wante..

631
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,731
..to ruin our entire family.

632
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:48,021
Bhishma you are the eldest,
you should understand.

633
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:51,321
I'm able to understan that
this entire master plan..

634
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:53,321
..is of that Mangal Singh
and that lawyer.

635
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,511
Those two cannot
escape my wrath anymore.

636
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:02,229
I swear on you mother,
I kill Suraj's murderers.

637
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:06,929
No brother. The law
will punish the guilty not you.

638
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:09,767
The revenge in the brother's
death cannot..

639
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:11,967
..wait for the law to
take its own course.

640
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:30,389
Hey, this man is coming
here..be careful.

641
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:42,295
Do you know him?
- This is Suraj Sir.

642
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,595
He has not come here since long.

643
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,582
Don't try and act smart.

644
01:04:47,036 --> 01:04:49,336
You know it wey well
that he was murdered.

645
01:04:49,536 --> 01:04:53,736
Sir, but swear on God
I know anything about him.

646
01:04:57,424 --> 01:05:03,524
But I wll find out,  on the 10 of this month..
Suraj was murdered.

647
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:08,144
I just want to know that that day
who was here on duty.

648
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:10,816
We two were there sir. And...

649
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:17,026
..there were 5 drivers,
and Suraj was included in it.

650
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,326
Where are the rest 4 drivers?

651
01:05:19,463 --> 01:05:21,663
Call them I want to enquire with them.

652
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:24,128
Where will we search for them sir?

653
01:05:24,228 --> 01:05:28,028
Hey..before I reach
back the police station..

654
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:30,553
..they should reach there, it is clear?

655
01:05:36,477 --> 01:05:38,377
Good morning sir.
- Greetings sir.

656
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:43,664
Shinde, there should be a  checking for every
vehicle that passes the Mumbai Pune highway.

657
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:46,164
No vehicle should pass without
being checked, clear? - Yes, sir.

658
01:05:47,218 --> 01:05:50,318
Sir, the four truck drivers
you had called have come.

659
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:51,718
Where are they?
- In the lock up.

660
01:05:53,327 --> 01:05:54,227
Come.

661
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:17,081
Tell me, what do you know
about Suraj's murder?

662
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:19,234
We don't know anything, sir.

663
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:25,354
Constable...you all go out.

664
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:28,445
I want to ask them something.

665
01:07:01,704 --> 01:07:03,804
Sir! I want to meet the inspector.

666
01:07:04,004 --> 01:07:07,604
What?
- Sir! I want to meet the inspector.

667
01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:09,268
What is it?

668
01:07:09,468 --> 01:07:12,468
I want to file a report. By when
will the inspector be free?

669
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:15,607
Leave me!

670
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:17,463
Sir, don't beat them so much.

671
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:18,563
Tell me who killed Suraj!

672
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:20,663
Spare them sir.
Don't be so brutal to them.

673
01:07:20,863 --> 01:07:24,263
If they go to court,
you will be in trouble.

674
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:42,084
Sir. As per plan, we raided all places..

675
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:43,884
..but got no clue about the murderes.

676
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:48,339
We did not even find
any you gave us.

677
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:52,271
But the Malad police had found
an unclaimed body some days ago.

678
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,458
Whose descripion is very much like Mangal.

679
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:57,158
Any photo?
- This is that body's photo.

680
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:00,555
You can go.

681
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:07,326
Only Mangal Singh could
lead us to those murderers.

682
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:11,056
But what will I tell Bhishma now?

683
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,158
We tricked inspector Arjun in such a manner..

684
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:21,158
..that he will never be
able to guess all his life.

685
01:08:21,358 --> 01:08:22,358
How is that?

686
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,358
I killed his brother..

687
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:28,958
..and created a rift between him
ahd his step brother.

688
01:08:38,558 --> 01:08:41,558
Barood Singh
- Can I speak to inspector Arjun?

689
01:08:41,758 --> 01:08:42,758
Who is calling?

690
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,958
Look, I want to give him some
important information.

691
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:57,133
I used to wonder how all
our news reaches the police.

692
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,533
This was the only way to nab you.

693
01:08:59,733 --> 01:09:00,533
And finally we..

694
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,204
Hey! Catch her!

695
01:09:33,138 --> 01:09:33,938
Please save me.

696
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:46,971
If I had not banged into you today..

697
01:10:48,825 --> 01:10:49,925
..then perhaps by now..

698
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Why did this lawyer want to kill you?

699
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,320
He is not a lawyer.

700
01:10:57,998 --> 01:11:00,798
He is Chhagan the brother
of the dons of this city, Chamunda Brothers.

701
01:11:00,998 --> 01:11:03,198
And they only have murdered Suraj.

702
01:11:03,398 --> 01:11:06,198
How can you say
this with such conviction?

703
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:10,798
Because until now, I have been
working with Chamunda Brothers.

704
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:14,495
You were forced to work for them? - Yes.

705
01:11:15,477 --> 01:11:17,577
I wanted to avenge
the murder of my family.

706
01:11:18,188 --> 01:11:21,388
A year ago, Chamunda Brothers had killed an inspector.

707
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:23,824
My father was an eye witness
to that murder.

708
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:27,391
My father's evidence's could send them to the gallows.

709
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:30,494
That is why they
not only killed my father..

710
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:37,664
..but also my mother
and my innocent brother.

711
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:43,421
To take my revenge I started
working for Chamunda Brothers.

712
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:48,582
And what information I got,
I secretely passed it on to Arjun.

713
01:11:56,304 --> 01:11:57,804
This will be your last information.

714
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,659
I will take your revenge.

715
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:08,075
Look, how lucky that dog is.

716
01:12:08,275 --> 01:12:09,775
How close he is to those girls.

717
01:12:09,975 --> 01:12:11,675
If it was us instead of that dog..

718
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,675
..even we'd be that close to them.

719
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:15,968
We are very unfortunate.

720
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:19,263
It is we who slog day and night..

721
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:24,024
..but our boss who has all
the fun with his girlfriend.

722
01:12:24,998 --> 01:12:27,398
You'll see, even our days will come.

723
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:28,898
Even we will have a good time.

724
01:12:29,098 --> 01:12:31,298
We can never get so lucky.

725
01:12:31,498 --> 01:12:36,798
We are only destined to do
our duty under the hot sun.

726
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:40,428
What are you two
fools doing here?

727
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:42,428
We..are..on..duty.

728
01:12:42,628 --> 01:12:46,228
But how come you are here?
You quit that job of yours?

729
01:12:47,346 --> 01:12:50,246
I have closed down my business.

730
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,867
Since when?
- Since your boss robbed me.

731
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:54,867
Rob..robbed!

732
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,409
Our boss robbed you?

733
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,252
That means he can be booked under Section 379

734
01:13:01,452 --> 01:13:02,952
If you like, we can arrest him.

735
01:13:03,052 --> 01:13:07,052
No...no! I am going to arrest your boss.

736
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:41,232
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

737
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:45,869
"O my love, I love you."

738
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:49,969
"You are in my dreams.
I crave only for you."

739
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:53,969
"You are in my dreams.
I crave only for you."

740
01:13:54,169 --> 01:13:55,769
"O my love!"

741
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:03,795
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

742
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:08,730
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

743
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:42,988
"Despite meeting you often
I crave to meet me."

744
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:47,188
"I didn't feel like this before.
What feeling is this?"

745
01:14:47,388 --> 01:14:51,288
"This is a new emotion."

746
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:55,488
'I am bemused. I am in a daze."

747
01:14:55,688 --> 01:14:59,688
"I have heard this is
what love does to you."

748
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:03,388
"What kind of ecstasy is this?"

749
01:15:03,588 --> 01:15:07,688
"I am totally taken in by you.
I am los in you."

750
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:09,888
"O my love!"

751
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:17,276
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

752
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:21,476
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

753
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:46,271
"The spell was cast
in the first glance itself."

754
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:50,471
"I lost my heart to you."

755
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:54,171
"Gift me your heart."

756
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:58,571
"After swaying in your loving arms.."

757
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:02,671
"..even my life sways with joy."

758
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,571
" I gift my heart to you."

759
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:10,471
"I love you. I am
committing no crime."

760
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:14,571
"I love you. I am
committing no crime."

761
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:18,071
"O my love!"

762
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:24,417
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

763
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:28,779
"You are in my heart,
in my heart beat."

764
01:16:29,079 --> 01:16:33,379
"O my love, I love you."

765
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:37,279
"I will make you belong to me,
and take you away from here."

766
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:39,579
"O my love!"

767
01:16:43,646 --> 01:16:46,646
"You are in my heart,
- In my heart beat."

768
01:18:22,849 --> 01:18:25,249
- How did the lights go off?
- Maybe the fuse went out.

769
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:26,249
Let's go and check.

770
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:28,711
Be careful.

771
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,720
I'm not in the habit
of talking too much.

772
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:16,619
Where are Chamunda Brothers?

773
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:17,819
We don't know.

774
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:31,961
I will not ask a third time.
Where are Chamunda Brothers?

775
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,459
I'm telling the truth.They have
not come here since many days.

776
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,800
I grant you all your life.

777
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:42,661
When chamunda comes,
tell him Bhishma had come.

778
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:45,904
Yes. - And will come again.

779
01:20:09,153 --> 01:20:11,153
Come, Arjun. How are you?

780
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:15,412
Strange! You recognised me even
 without having seen me.

781
01:20:16,264 --> 01:20:18,464
I recognise the warmth of 
your hands sonce childhood.

782
01:20:18,953 --> 01:20:19,853
What brings you here?

783
01:20:20,085 --> 01:20:21,285
A complaint has been
 lodged against you.

784
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:25,285
You went on a rampage in Chamunda
 brother's godow. And threatened to kill them.

785
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:29,496
- Who Chamunda brothers
- Don't pretend.

786
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:32,072
If  Chamunda brothers
are Suraj killers,..

787
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:34,307
..they will be punished.

788
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,500
But you don't take 
law into your hands.

789
01:20:38,114 --> 01:20:41,514
The law needs evidence, and I'll
 not leave behind any evidence.

790
01:20:42,028 --> 01:20:43,628
You can continue doing your
 duty without worry.

791
01:21:25,674 --> 01:21:30,474
Sorry inspector, the cigarette
slipped out of my hand.

792
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:35,238
The fire that doesn't extinguish
 on its own, is put out.

793
01:21:37,345 --> 01:21:39,645
Just the way you have 
arrested Bhishma..

794
01:21:39,845 --> 01:21:42,745
..for going on a rampage
 in our godow.

795
01:21:43,727 --> 01:21:47,127
The law book talks of evidence.

796
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:50,736
Without evidence, forget the innocent..

797
01:21:51,847 --> 01:21:53,647
..even the culprit cannot be booked.

798
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:54,647
What nonsense are you talking!

799
01:21:55,126 --> 01:21:57,826
Does that mean you haven't 
arrested that culprit yet?

800
01:21:59,259 --> 01:22:02,059
I send culprits straight to
 the gallows, Mr. Dhawan.

801
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:03,731
Have patience.

802
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,544
What are you trying to say, Arjun?

803
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,696
Exactly what you are thinking, Mr. Madan.

804
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:13,234
Bhishma's going on a rampage
 in your godown proves..

805
01:22:14,207 --> 01:22:17,807
..that you are connected 
with Suraj's murder.

806
01:22:18,007 --> 01:22:21,907
But regretfully, law is 
depdendent on evidence.

807
01:22:23,196 --> 01:22:25,696
But the day I lay my hands
 on the evidence..

808
01:22:25,896 --> 01:22:29,396
..I will drag you to jail like dogs.

809
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:40,149
You managed to enter our house, 
inspector Arjun.

810
01:22:41,327 --> 01:22:45,127
But only your corpse will go out of here.

811
01:22:45,385 --> 01:22:50,485
And the police department will 
not even fond your body.

812
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,137
That must be the Comissioner.

813
01:22:57,671 --> 01:23:00,371
Before coming here, I'd told him
 that I'm going to mett two dogs.

814
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:02,705
Shall I take the call? - Yes.

815
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:10,644
Hello, - Dhawan, it's me, Chhagan.

816
01:23:10,977 --> 01:23:12,877
Yes Comissioner, 
Inspector Arjun here.

817
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,038
Inspector Arjun? 
What are you doing there?

818
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:18,679
My brother haven't
 shot you dead yet?

819
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:22,279
The shooting was about 
to begin when you called.

820
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:24,779
Stop your nonsense and give
 the line to my brother.

821
01:23:24,979 --> 01:23:27,879
Alright, I will keep the phone
 on the table like you said.

822
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:31,579
If you hear gunshots, 
come here with the police force.

823
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:33,779
And arrest these mad dogs.

824
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:39,071
I have heard you love telling stories.

825
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:41,171
I'll tell you a story today.

826
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:46,207
This story is of a lion who was thirsty.

827
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:48,332
Looking for water, 
he reached another jungle.

828
01:23:50,952 --> 01:23:53,252
Over there, he met two other lions.

829
01:23:55,469 --> 01:23:58,669
The lion stopped him and said
 he cannot drink water.

830
01:23:59,503 --> 01:24:03,603
Instead of being afraid, 
the lion sprung at them.

831
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,808
And he realised that they were 
not two lions but two donkeys.

832
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:12,781
When the donkeys asked the lion..

833
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,881
..how he came to know they
 were donkeys and not lions..

834
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,940
..he said it was very simple.

835
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:21,170
A lion doesn't need to declare he is lion.

836
01:24:22,965 --> 01:24:26,565
Likewisw, even a shooter does
 not say he is going to shoot.

837
01:24:26,765 --> 01:24:28,965
The real shooters just shoots.

838
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:32,874
Even I am like a thirsty lion.

839
01:24:34,429 --> 01:24:39,829
The day I find evidence, 
you two will..

840
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:51,864
Comissioner...
 - Brtoher, I am Chhagan.

841
01:24:52,064 --> 01:24:57,164
 Chhagan, you! That means he was
 talking to you for so long.

842
01:24:57,364 --> 01:25:00,164
I think he fooled us all and ran away.

843
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:23,657
Yes?

844
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,786
I wanted to meet inspector Arjun.

845
01:25:26,249 --> 01:25:28,249
Inspector Arjun? 
He has been transferred.

846
01:25:28,449 --> 01:25:30,749
Transferred? But where?

847
01:25:32,124 --> 01:25:33,024
'Jhumri Tilaliya'.

848
01:25:34,437 --> 01:25:35,237
'Jhumri Tilaliya'?

849
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,400
But he was posted here until 
yesterday. - Was, not anymore.

850
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:46,496
Ok thank you, let's go.

851
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:48,847
Arjun? 

852
01:25:51,728 --> 01:25:53,128
What are you doing in my chair?

853
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:56,028
You were not here, so I thought
of doing your duty.

854
01:25:58,304 --> 01:25:59,404
What is the matter?

855
01:26:00,437 --> 01:26:02,537
How come you came
 to the police station today?

856
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:05,537
I came to tell you to stop
 being dependent on law.

857
01:26:05,737 --> 01:26:07,837
It has been able to help 
no one until today.

858
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,300
So you have come to advise me?

859
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,100
It was necessary. 
Look at this girl.

860
01:26:14,941 --> 01:26:17,741
Chamunda brothers have
 killed her parents too.

861
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:20,882
She kept making the
 rounds of police stations.

862
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:23,645
She kept calling you and giving
 you evidence against criminals.

863
01:26:25,633 --> 01:26:27,033
What could you do
 for her until today?

864
01:26:29,748 --> 01:26:31,948
I... - You could do nothing.

865
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:34,548
Nothing can be done
 under this roof.

866
01:26:35,101 --> 01:26:39,601
If you look at the sun, it
 will only dazzle your eyes.

867
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:43,463
Nice reply.

868
01:26:45,153 --> 01:26:46,053
Let"s go, Deepa.

869
01:26:46,253 --> 01:26:49,053
Just a minute. Where are 
you going, brother?

870
01:26:49,423 --> 01:26:51,323
To watch a film
 in Gaiety cinema.

871
01:26:51,523 --> 01:26:53,123
Even you can come
 along if you like.

872
01:26:53,823 --> 01:26:55,323
No thanks, I'm on duty.

873
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:07,592
They are going for a film and 
gave us a lecture and went.

874
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,884
- Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

875
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:15,266
Even we will go to the
 movies on a holiday.

876
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:19,432
And we will take cormer seats.

877
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,980
What if we don't
 get corner seats?

878
01:27:23,897 --> 01:27:25,597
Then we'll watch the 
movie, what else?

879
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:36,405
You go and sit, 
I'll join you soon.

880
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:44,349
I met Supriya in the library.

881
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:57,154
Nice, give me two.

882
01:27:57,354 --> 01:27:58,054
What an insolent man!

883
01:28:02,509 --> 01:28:04,109
Your sandals are good.

884
01:30:38,878 --> 01:30:40,778
You'll had killed my brother, 
hadn't you?

885
01:30:42,372 --> 01:30:46,972
Not me, my brother killed him.
I didn't kill him.

886
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:50,259
No...no... I didn't do anything.

887
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,375
I didn't kill him.

888
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:31,632
Listen, you go and light 
the theatre.

889
01:32:10,676 --> 01:32:13,776
Shut-up! Sit down all of you.
Quiet!

890
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:27,531
Arjun, you? 

891
01:32:28,107 --> 01:32:30,607
You said you are on duty
and you cannot come for the film.

892
01:32:31,868 --> 01:32:34,568
Madan, one of the Chamunda
brothers, has been murdered.

893
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:36,617
Madan has been murdered? 

894
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:39,981
That's good news.
One devil less in this world.

895
01:32:41,249 --> 01:32:43,849
But Madan must have been murdered somewhere
 outside.What are you doing here?

896
01:32:44,049 --> 01:32:45,749
The culprit is sitting
 right before my eyes.

897
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:50,900
My only problem is I have
 no evidence to arrest you.

898
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,600
I think you are mistaken.

899
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,890
We have been sitting here 
and watching the film.

900
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:59,690
You two are togheter in this.
And your evidence doesn't count.

901
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:03,792
Alright, if you don't trust Deepa,
 ask someone else.

902
01:33:03,898 --> 01:33:06,098
You can ask those girls.
Right sister? 

903
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:10,513
- Has this man been here all 
along? - Yes inspector.

904
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:14,431
He is very brazen.
 He has been teasing us.

905
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:22,494
Brother, man can run,
 but not faster than time.

906
01:33:23,212 --> 01:33:26,312
The law will have a reply
 to your every smart move.

907
01:33:26,757 --> 01:33:27,957
Mark my words!

908
01:33:45,513 --> 01:33:49,813
Brother!...
- What happened?

909
01:33:50,465 --> 01:33:55,365
Brother!...- What happened?
 I ask what happened?

910
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:57,764
Brother!...
- What happened?

911
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:02,200
Madan was killed by Bhishma.

912
01:34:12,038 --> 01:34:14,238
Just wipe out those two brothers.

913
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:18,438
 Who have snatched my brother from me. Go..

914
01:34:26,913 --> 01:34:29,013
The song were good, but rest
 of the movie was okay.

915
01:34:29,013 --> 01:34:31,613
Deepa.. with your help, I have 
managed to be succesful..

916
01:34:32,715 --> 01:34:35,515
in my first step of revenge.

917
01:39:24,038 --> 01:39:26,738
Bhishma..I'm at the 
moment with Arjun..

918
01:39:26,938 --> 01:39:29,638
You come to meet me at once. 
Your mother.

919
01:42:25,436 --> 01:42:27,336
Hey stop the vehicle.
- What is it?

920
01:43:23,121 --> 01:43:25,521
Brother...
- Where is mother?

921
01:43:25,721 --> 01:43:26,721
I'll call you later.

922
01:43:31,741 --> 01:43:34,641
What is the matter? 
You look very disturbed.

923
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,841
I haven't come to your police station, 
but meet my mother.

924
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,300
If you have committed a crime then..

925
01:43:41,196 --> 01:43:42,696
..you have no right 
to meet mother.

926
01:43:42,896 --> 01:43:45,396
You have no proof regarding my crime.

927
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:47,718
Bhishma.
- Mother.

928
01:43:51,171 --> 01:43:51,971
What happened mother?

929
01:43:53,516 --> 01:43:55,216
What is this unauspicious
 moment son..

930
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:57,416
..the lamp that I lit 
for prayers went off.

931
01:43:58,018 --> 01:44:00,218
This is just a coincidence mother.

932
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:03,218
Both your sons are with you
 then what can be unauspicious?

933
01:44:05,508 --> 01:44:08,208
But mother, why did you come 
to the city all of sudden?

934
01:44:09,234 --> 01:44:11,734
Yesterday night I had
 a very bad dream..

935
01:44:13,073 --> 01:44:17,673
..as if the enemy wants
to snatch youaway like Suraj.

936
01:44:18,286 --> 01:44:23,086
My heart was at unrest.
 And came to see you.

937
01:44:24,039 --> 01:44:26,039
I have a lot of grievance 
with you both.

938
01:44:27,096 --> 01:44:29,696
Both are staying separately
 in the same city?

939
01:44:31,684 --> 01:44:33,284
Bhishma! ..Arjun!

940
01:44:36,869 --> 01:44:40,669
Mother! 
- Left.

941
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:41,490
Come on..turn to the 
left..let it go on.

942
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,103
Come on ..let it go back. Easy easy.

943
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,110
Corect.. come on let it go back.

944
01:46:12,695 --> 01:46:14,395
Hey... what are you doing?

945
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:43,668
Listen Arjun, I cannot give you 
warrants against Chamunda.

946
01:46:44,515 --> 01:46:48,215
See we don't have any
 proof against them.

947
01:46:48,215 --> 01:46:49,315
Enough sir.

948
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:56,140
The laws knows only one word 
proof..proof..proof.

949
01:46:57,124 --> 01:46:58,724
I'm tired of this word.

950
01:46:59,286 --> 01:47:00,986
Whenever we want to take
 action ..

951
01:47:01,186 --> 01:47:04,886
.. we are restricted because 
of lack of enough proof.

952
01:47:09,369 --> 01:47:14,769
Sir..today my mother died.

953
01:47:16,327 --> 01:47:21,827
Tomorrow some other
from your house dies.

954
01:47:23,385 --> 01:47:28,385
What will you do.. 
will you run behind him?

955
01:47:31,047 --> 01:47:33,747
Arjun, your talks carry weight.

956
01:47:34,104 --> 01:47:37,504
Let me tell you one thing.

957
01:47:38,883 --> 01:47:41,683
I have been hearing since childhood that 
the law can reach  very far..

958
01:47:42,855 --> 01:47:46,455
.., but sir it is not so, but the law
 is bound with restrictions.

959
01:47:47,444 --> 01:47:49,144
And because of this restrictions

960
01:47:50,621 --> 01:47:53,821
..our sepoys are getting killed.

961
01:47:54,207 --> 01:47:57,307
After that a huge function is held..

962
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:00,670
..the sepoy's photograph is honoured..

963
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:04,670
..and his relatives are
 awarded with some money.

964
01:48:06,537 --> 01:48:09,937
And big people like you
 stand and give ovation.

965
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:13,884
That's it and next moment they are forgotten.

966
01:48:15,894 --> 01:48:19,894
When will this nation
 be freed? When?

967
01:48:45,905 --> 01:48:48,205
Hello.
- Brother, there is a bad news.

968
01:48:48,405 --> 01:48:50,005
Bad news? - Yes brother.
- What is it?

969
01:48:50,452 --> 01:48:52,052
Chhagan is killed.
- No!

970
01:49:30,589 --> 01:49:32,289
Robert.
- Yes brother?

971
01:49:32,489 --> 01:49:35,489
Inform Bihari, Anna and Carlos.

972
01:49:36,994 --> 01:49:38,894
That tomorrow at 12 midnight..

973
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:43,316
..Chamunda is selling
 the Mumbai city.

974
01:49:43,884 --> 01:49:44,784
Allright

975
01:49:59,454 --> 01:50:00,854
This is my Mumbai.

976
01:50:01,853 --> 01:50:04,353
The dream city of India.

977
01:50:05,869 --> 01:50:09,669
This is that town where every
 Indian dreams of settling down.

978
01:50:11,135 --> 01:50:14,435
Where every Mafia dreams of ruling.

979
01:50:16,338 --> 01:50:20,438
Today I'm going to have
 a city which was obtained..

980
01:50:22,743 --> 01:50:25,643
..by the dominance and 
the power of Chamunda brothers..

981
01:50:25,843 --> 01:50:32,043
..today it will be auctioned.

982
01:50:32,243 --> 01:50:37,143
For such a small job what was
 the need to gather this crowd?

983
01:50:37,343 --> 01:50:41,043
You could have called up on the phone 
and we would have bestowed you with all the wealth.

984
01:50:41,088 --> 01:50:45,788
No Bihari!  Chamunda is
 a bigger merchant than you.

985
01:50:46,732 --> 01:50:49,332
My underworld, gambling dens and casino's..

986
01:50:49,532 --> 01:50:52,832
..have a mass of wealth flowing.
I don't need the money.

987
01:50:59,161 --> 01:51:00,761
The what do you want?

988
01:51:01,881 --> 01:51:05,381
I want these two men... Alive.

989
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:15,278
Only two men? - Yes.

990
01:51:16,373 --> 01:51:19,673
The bidding starts from deal.

991
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:21,473
Any one of you who fulfills the job,
 I will hand over..

992
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:25,573
..the golden Key of Mumbai
 and leave India for good.

993
01:51:25,773 --> 01:51:27,873
But where will we find these two?

994
01:51:29,038 --> 01:51:31,238
They will surely in search of me..

995
01:51:32,888 --> 01:51:34,688
..will reach one of my dens.

996
01:51:56,113 --> 01:51:58,013
Come on bring it the box here.

997
01:52:29,494 --> 01:52:31,394
Where's Chamunda?
- I don't know anything.

998
01:52:31,594 --> 01:52:33,194
Truly.. I don't know.
I don't know anything.

999
01:52:34,074 --> 01:52:35,874
This gun has a bullet 
named on you.

1000
01:52:36,952 --> 01:52:38,952
Where's Chamunda?
- I don't know anything.

1001
01:52:47,373 --> 01:52:49,673
I will tell you where  Chamunda is.

1002
01:52:49,873 --> 01:52:51,873
Why are you killing
 that poor man?

1003
01:52:53,797 --> 01:52:55,997
Brother he is a very big
 Don of India.

1004
01:52:57,503 --> 01:52:59,203
He is Anna from the South.

1005
01:53:01,363 --> 01:53:04,563
And that is Bihari 
who shudders the north.

1006
01:53:08,718 --> 01:53:10,718
Today.. the enemies
 of the nation are here..

1007
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:14,718
..now this is not just a revenge
but a major battle.

1008
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:39,700
What is this?

1009
01:53:42,353 --> 01:53:45,453
Arjun, what is this?

1010
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:48,541
I think its their parcel
- Lets see.

1011
01:53:49,179 --> 01:53:51,279
This parcel is in your name.
 - Take it.

1012
01:53:55,853 --> 01:53:57,353
Take it.

1013
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,000
Brother.

1014
01:54:33,141 --> 01:54:34,041
Hey son.. 

1015
01:54:36,897 --> 01:54:39,297
It is your 
age to play with toys.

1016
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,197
Don't pick this gun.

1017
01:54:44,225 --> 01:54:47,125
Hey you..stop firing
those crackers.

1018
01:54:47,816 --> 01:54:49,916
Or else I will shoot 
your brothers head off.

1019
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:53,916
Death dancing over your head..

1020
01:54:54,248 --> 01:54:56,148
..and say that don't get scared.

1021
01:54:57,179 --> 01:55:00,179
Don't shoot. Take this. 
I dropped the gun.

1022
01:55:01,267 --> 01:55:03,567
This is called as love for the brother.

1023
01:55:04,256 --> 01:55:07,556
Very good Bihari, 
I did not know that these two..

1024
01:55:07,756 --> 01:55:11,056
..will come into 
our hands so easily.

1025
01:55:12,426 --> 01:55:15,426
And such a big city 
Mumbai is in our fists.

1026
01:55:16,613 --> 01:55:20,313
Do you both know that
 in lure of your lives..

1027
01:55:20,811 --> 01:55:24,311
..Chamunda is giving
 us the golden Key of Mumbai.

1028
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,419
But there is a problem.

1029
01:55:29,511 --> 01:55:32,211
Mumbai city is one 
and you are three.

1030
01:55:32,996 --> 01:55:34,396
How will you distribute
 amongst yourselve?

1031
01:55:34,596 --> 01:55:39,196
And the important thing is, who
will take us to Chamunda?

1032
01:55:39,396 --> 01:55:41,696
You..you..or you?

1033
01:55:43,701 --> 01:55:47,401
And another thing is that 
whoever takes us to Chamunda..

1034
01:55:48,368 --> 01:55:49,868
..the Mumbai city will belong to him.

1035
01:55:50,028 --> 01:55:50,828
Yes.

1036
01:55:51,188 --> 01:55:54,588
For which two will have
 to die and one will remain alive.

1037
01:55:54,899 --> 01:55:58,599
You all decide who willremain alive.

1038
01:55:58,799 --> 01:56:01,399
Till then I'm sitting
 with my brother. - Yes come.

1039
01:56:04,163 --> 01:56:06,563
Okay now attack.
 - Start off.

1040
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:15,710
Come lets sit here. 
Ring side seats.

1041
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:22,710
Whom do you think
 will win? - Anna.

1042
01:56:30,489 --> 01:56:32,089
I think Bihari will win.

1043
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:42,041
Anna will win..See. 
He is very strong.

1044
01:56:42,241 --> 01:56:45,041
Bihari will win , the people 
from Bihar are very strong.

1045
01:56:50,898 --> 01:56:53,798
One is gone. 
Now two are left.

1046
01:56:53,998 --> 01:56:55,998
Now in these two see
 Anna will win.

1047
01:56:57,647 --> 01:56:59,047
I say Bihari will win. 

1048
01:56:59,247 --> 01:57:01,247
If he does then I will kill Chamunda.

1049
01:57:01,447 --> 01:57:03,847
And if Anna wins then 
I will kill Chamunda. - Okay.

1050
01:57:21,102 --> 01:57:22,102
Here brother..

1051
01:57:25,949 --> 01:57:28,749
..these two are gone
and the third is the winner.

1052
01:57:30,421 --> 01:57:32,121
Lets congratulate him.
- He has won.

1053
01:57:34,162 --> 01:57:36,762
Congratulations.

1054
01:57:38,075 --> 01:57:39,075
You were great?

1055
01:57:40,532 --> 01:57:42,232
Listen, call up Chamunda.

1056
01:57:42,432 --> 01:57:44,832
I just call him here, right now.
- Do it then.

1057
01:57:45,911 --> 01:57:48,911
This is Carlos, I have 
caught hold of these rats.

1058
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:50,528
You come here soon.

1059
01:58:15,563 --> 01:58:18,563
Carlos..you fulfilled your promis.

1060
01:58:19,142 --> 01:58:24,542
Now by killing both of them
 I will fulfill my promise.

1061
02:00:03,348 --> 02:00:07,848
The humanity cannot be wiped out,
even if a human is.

1062
02:00:08,959 --> 02:00:12,259
What ever strategy may a devil plan

1063
02:00:13,249 --> 02:00:17,849
When a Satan will encourage the
injuste and wrongdoing.

1064
02:00:18,741 --> 02:00:21,841
And then will arrive
 and destroyers the evil.

1065
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:24,719
This is a Challenge!
