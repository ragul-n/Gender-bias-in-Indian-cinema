episode 5 will start at : 12:57

00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:49,089
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

3
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:53,521
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

4
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:57,485
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

5
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,860
At least say, peace be upon you.

6
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,860
Alpargu, you go out.

7
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,126
I was expecting you.

8
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:30,260
But I was not expecting you, Gundogdu.

9
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,893
Kurdoglu will go at night
to ambush a tent and kidnap a Shahzade...

10
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
...and I will miss this party.
How can this be?

11
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:47,460
Have you become a guard to the tent of
the people whom you were crying out...

12
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,526
...for them to leave yesterday?

13
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:54,226
In a tribe where you try to collect
support to become a Bey...

14
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,126
...let us become a guard.

15
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,026
Emmi...

16
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:03,626
...this tribe should have a guard.

17
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:10,026
So that bandits and dogs don’t roam
about inside the camp.

18
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,893
Now tell me, where did you learn
this Shahzade issue?

19
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:23,626
When I went to Karatoygar
as a messenger, I inquired around.

20
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,726
I connected the dots.

21
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,493
Why did you keep it a secret until now?

22
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:36,060
The same reason as why Suleyman Shah
kept it a secret from his own son.

23
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,060
You lie.

24
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:49,826
You asked, I answered.

25
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,126
Whoever sowed the seeds of suspicion
inside you, go and ask them!

26
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:02,026
<i>Those people who you call faceless</i>
<i>are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.</i>

27
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,660
<i>The man called Numan is a Shahzade and</i>
<i>that girl you look down on, is a sultan.</i>

28
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,893
-Brother, I need to talk with you.
-Not now.

29
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:43,093
-Brother!
-I said, not now, Dundar!

30
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,560
Gundogdu...

31
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,260
...did something bad happen?

32
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,560
Was it you who told Kurdoglu that
Numan and his son were Shahzades, Hatun?

33
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,093
-What happened?
-Answer me. Did you tell him or not?

34
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:58,026
What Shahzade, Gundogdu?
What are you talking about?

35
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,093
What made you so angry?

36
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:04,493
Kurdoglu learned that
they are Shahzades, Hatun.

37
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,593
What did he do then?

38
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:15,193
I don’t know his intention
but he wanted to imprison them.

39
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:19,060
-Where are the Shahzades?
-They left with Ertugrul.

40
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:23,760
I want you to take the agreement
to El Aziz, Ertugrul.

41
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,126
But brother,
my father gave this duty to you.

42
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,726
Very well, and I am giving it to you.

43
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,160
We should both do the jobs we know best,
Ertugrul. Don’t you always say...

44
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,860
...let the headquarter be yours
and hunt mine?

45
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,226
-And you let them go? What are you up to?
-What is it to you?

46
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:46,493
-Did you tell him or not?
-I did not tell, Gundogdu.

47
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,826
What business can I have with Kurdoglu?

48
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,893
Did Kurdoglu tell you
that he heard it from me?

49
00:17:56,226 --> 00:18:01,460
He said that it was someone else.
But if it was you, Hatun...

50
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,793
...may God be my witness that...

51
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,760
You were not like this.
Something happened to you.

52
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:13,260
Don’t you trust the woman
who is carrying your child in her womb?

53
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,160
To your wife who is going to
give you a son?

54
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,093
Bey, Ertugrul and his Alps have left.

55
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,693
Round up the men you trust,
they should go after them.

56
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,093
Tell them not to refrain from
spilling blood if needed.

57
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,248
{\an8}ALEPPO

58
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,868
You wait around here.
I will be back shortly.

59
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,866
Peace be upon you.

60
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,233
And peace be upon you.

61
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,700
I am looking for a book.
“Mawaqi al-Nujum.”

62
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:33,000
The Twilight of the Stars.
Do you have it?

63
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,333
Of course.

64
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,833
What do you expect to learn
from that book?

65
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,966
I am after what everyone else
is seeking to learn.

66
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:59,900
I want to look in the sky and
foresee the things of tomorrow.

67
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:04,633
Maybe the author did not write
the book with that intention.

68
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,433
I want to buy this. How much is it?

69
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,500
Accept it as a gift.

70
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,366
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious and Most Merciful.

71
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,466
Then I swear by the setting of the stars.

72
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:26,400
And indeed, it is an oath.

73
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:29,766
It is of course a valuable Book.

74
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,533
None touch it except the purified.

75
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,466
God always states the truth.

76
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,633
They say that...

77
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:47,400
...after the sun rises, you cannot
look at the stars to find direction.

78
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,933
Do not dwell on the stars.

79
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,800
If you want to see...

80
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,833
...the Sun is in my hand.

81
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,300
None touch it except the purified.

82
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,833
That is the Quran.

83
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,433
But It does not state
what will happen tomorrow.

84
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,900
For the eyes that can see...

85
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,933
...the secrets are Here,
as well as the secret of the secrets.

86
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:35,866
The book you took just now is only
a drop from the Ocean called Quran.

87
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:41,800
I never saw you before in Aleppo,
stranger. Are you from nearby?

88
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,733
I am a poor traveler.

89
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,933
I set off from the countries where
the sun sets to look for the country...

90
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,200
...where the sun will rise from.

91
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:57,800
I am the writer of the book
which was given as a present to you.

92
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,666
What happened, sir?

93
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:33,533
The man was Ibn Arabi.

94
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,300
We should not be late.
People are waiting for us at the lodge.

95
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,366
We will go by the stream,
you take the hills.

96
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,866
Great God.

97
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,433
Turgut, you carry on.

98
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,333
Carry on.

99
00:28:58,366 --> 00:28:59,700
Shahzade, carry on.

100
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,333
You tactless people!
What is the meaning of this?

101
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
How can you shoot
an arrow at Ertugrul Bey?

102
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:35,633
We do not know, Dogan.
Kurdoglu Bey gave a direct order.

103
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,400
Surrender without a fight.
And the arrow was just a warning...

104
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,600
...otherwise I could have hit him
right on the neck.

105
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:45,633
Your tongue has overgrown! I will cut it
for you to take it back to Kurdoglu.

106
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,466
Go back to our tribe.
I do not want to spill your blood.

107
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,366
We don’t want to spill
the blood of our brothers as well.

108
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:55,700
If you obey us and return to the tribe,
our brotherhood would continue.

109
00:29:55,833 --> 00:30:00,666
I shall not obey you or Kurdoglu.
I only obey my forefather’s customs.

110
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,933
Even if Kurdoglu sends a thousand man
here, I would not give up those...

111
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,900
...who took refuge nor
I would spill a brother’s blood.

112
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:21,299
Ertugrul Bey, I hope you did not face
another trouble because of us.

113
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,200
I prefer to be sleepless
instead of seeing a nightmare.

114
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:29,233
We put you in a bad situation but
we set off early as a precaution.

115
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,200
You are right as well.

116
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,500
If a lion goes hunting,
it gets blamed for spilling blood...

117
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:38,233
...if it lays down,
it gets blamed for being lazy.

118
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:44,700
Ertugrul Bey, when we left the tent,
Gundogdu Bey was in the tent alone.

119
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,300
Would he face a problem?

120
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,533
Do not worry.
My brother can overcome all difficulties.

121
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:29,366
Those four have died.
There is only one way for you to be saved.

122
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:34,366
If you tell me where
Ertugrul Bey is going, you will be free.

123
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,900
Aleppo. They are going to Aleppo.

124
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,400
This much freedom is enough.

125
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,766
Go to the castle, take the knights.

126
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,800
We shall set a trap for them
on the Aleppo road.

127
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,366
So he is taking the Shahzades to Aleppo.

128
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,300
Sister, what are you saying?

129
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,000
Sister, this thing is over.

130
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Ertugrul will never come back.

131
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:18,766
How can he not come back.
His tribe, his father is here, Gokce.

132
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,700
-Do not burn down your heart yet.
-But, sister...

133
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:29,266
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

134
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:32,233
May you have a good morning, my girl.
Is Gundogdu inside?

135
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,633
He did not sleep all night.
He must be asleep.

136
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,766
May you have a good morning, Gundogdu Bey.

137
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,200
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

138
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,733
-What is the matter?
-Not good news.

139
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:49,566
Come on.

140
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:54,400
Wash your face, then we have to talk.

141
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,733
Let us talk.

142
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,300
Your young brother Dundar...

143
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:04,000
...came to me early in the morning.

144
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,900
He wanted to say something
to Ertugrul but he did not listen.

145
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,700
You did not listen to him either.

146
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,633
He face was all white from fright
when I saw him.

147
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,766
What happened? Why was he frightened?

148
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,233
Not good news.

149
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:26,833
They found Baybora’s dead body with Yigit
at the Karadere stream.

150
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,900
-Baybora’s body?
-Yes.

151
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,800
Who would kill him and why?

152
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,733
I don’t know. But my mad mind
races on and thinks that...

153
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:43,866
...they have lost control,
thinking the tribe’s Bey is gone.

154
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,300
The only thing they did not have was
blood on their hands.

155
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:51,666
Do not think like that,
would this tribe ever be without a Bey?

156
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,666
Don’t worry. At the headquarters, they'll
learn that the Bey of the tribe is alive.

157
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,500
Don’t you worry.

158
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,633
Bey, in order to get ahead of Ertugrul
we went up the trail at Kiziltepe.

159
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:34,933
When our team did not arrive,
we got suspicious and went back.

160
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,333
When we came here, they were all dead.

161
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,000
Alpargu, bury them all
before anyone sees them.

162
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,466
Whatever happens, don’t forget that
you have swore obedience to Kurdoglu Bey.

163
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,600
He is Suleyman Shah’s acting Bey.

164
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,266
Then why are we coming here, Alpargu?

165
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:10,300
What business do we have
at the headquarters called by Gundogdu?

166
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:13,600
We came to give a lesson
to our Bey’s incompetent son.

167
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:18,366
You support our Bey whatever happens,
that would be sufficient.

168
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,966
Kurdoglu Bey...

169
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:48,366
...Baybora’s place has been empty
for such a long time.

170
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,900
We cannot see him in the headquarters.

171
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:55,366
What happened?

172
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:58,200
Where is he?

173
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:00,966
I will say it before you.

174
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:05,866
Last night he was found...

175
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,333
...at the banks of Karadere stream,
stabbed to death.

176
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:22,300
On the night of the day Ertugrul
came to you and inquired where he is.

177
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,600
What do you insinuate, Gundogdu?
Talk openly.

178
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:29,566
Be quiet, Alpargu. Keep your mouth shut.

179
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Your master will keep quiet as well...

180
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,000
...I shall be talking now.

181
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:42,533
You created factions within the tribe.

182
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,533
You caused discord.

183
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,800
You made people stone our guests’ tent.

184
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:50,000
Tell me Kurdoglu...

185
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
-...is attacking guests customary?
-Come to the point, Gundogdu.

186
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:00,233
Are you trying to accuse the person
you called Emmi until yesterday?

187
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:04,233
Aren’t you burying Suleyman Shah
even before he dies and...

188
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:07,333
...go out to collect obedience
from tribe’s Beys?

189
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:14,233
In our customs, questioning belongs to
the headquarters and answering to the Bey.

190
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,266
God help us.

191
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,700
We are not going to learn
our customs from the children.

192
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,400
We know what headquarter members
may ask and how to answer them.

193
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:30,733
You want to be Bey
and call us to account...

194
00:45:31,466 --> 00:45:35,466
...but you could not even steer
the caravan that was entrusted in you.

195
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:41,400
You call me to account
for the death of Baybora...

196
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,966
...but do you know what Ertugrul did?

197
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:02,866
Listen to me well, Beys of Kayi.

198
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,500
Ertugrul...

199
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:09,533
...killed five warriors of our tribe.
-That is a lie!

200
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,333
This is slander.

201
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,333
Mother Hayme, Ertugrul would
never do such a thing.

202
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,633
This shameless person
has lost control, my girl.

203
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:27,233
The slanders are only
a reflection of his own dark heart.

204
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,666
And thus...

205
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:34,933
...Gundogdu who caused our Alps
to die in the caravan ambush...

206
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:39,666
...and Ertugrul who slayed our Alps
cannot challenge me at all!

207
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,300
Decency, Kurdoglu, decency!

208
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:43,800
Enough!

209
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:51,700
Aren’t you ashamed of
slandering our Bey’s sons?

210
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,933
Don’t you have shame?

211
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,933
Calm. Be calm, Wild Demir.

212
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,400
There is no lie in my words.

213
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,333
God is my witness.

214
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:17,366
Ertugrul kidnapped Suleyman Shah’s
guests last night.

215
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,900
Their fate is unknown. In order to learn
what happened to our Bey’s guests...

216
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:25,666
...I sent some of my Alps after them.

217
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,566
In the morning,
news of their death reached me.

218
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:45,400
You are so anxious to stir up trouble
inside the tribe, Kurdoglu.

219
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,700
Aren’t you ashamed to take advantage
of my father’s illness?

220
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:53,366
Gundogdu do not talk like you don’t know.

221
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,600
You set this up with your brother.

222
00:47:57,433 --> 00:48:02,300
You disobeyed the order and gave the
agreement given to you, to Ertugrul.

223
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,633
One of us has to stay in the tribe
and fight against Kurdoglu’s doings.

224
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,266
Kurdoglu?

225
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,233
He learned that Numan and his son are
Shahzades. Now he is trying to convince...

226
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:17,433
...the Beys in the headquarters to migrate
somewhere in Seljuk territory, not Aleppo.

227
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,900
You are the one who is trying to take
advantage of your father’s illness.

228
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,733
You are the one who sits in his place,
while he is laying in his bed.

229
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,000
Thank God that my blood brother’s eyes
are closed and he doesn’t see these days.

230
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,766
Let us go, Beys of Kayi.

231
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:53,333
A headquarters not called by
Suleyman Shah...

232
00:48:53,966 --> 00:48:56,266
...is not a place we want to be in.

233
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,900
What will happen now, Bey?

234
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,366
The order given by Suleyman Shah
is still valid.

235
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:22,600
Preparations for migration
to Aleppo shall continue.

236
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:28,000
We will not give up on our Bey’s words
or his guests. With the help of God.

237
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:05,633
We are almost out of the Seljuk territory,
we can rest our horses here for a while.

238
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,733
-How is he, mother?
-The same, my son.

239
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,266
Did you hear our voices?

240
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:03,666
I am going to say that we should
send your father as soon as possible.

241
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:08,500
You are right, mother. We should have him
reach our destination...

242
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,500
...before he gets really distraught
during the migration.

243
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,266
You are right, Gundogdu Bey.
I can check and fix the old cart...

244
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,366
...for a more comfortable journey
for Suleyman Shah.

245
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:22,633
Thank you, Usta.

246
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:28,266
If he goes to Aleppo sooner,
we might find a remedy as well.

247
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,633
But I cannot come with you. You know that
the tribe is like a witch’s cauldron.

248
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:42,800
Don’t worry, Gundogdu Bey. I can take
Mother Hayme and Suleyman Shah...

249
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,666
...to Aleppo safe and sound.
We will leave early in the morning.

250
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:49,433
If God permits.

251
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,300
Look at Ertugrul.

252
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,433
I would have never thought that
he would kill the tribe’s warriors.

253
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:15,833
You have been my assistant for nothing
all these years, Alpargu.

254
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:32,333
Bey...

255
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:34,900
...this is a Crusader arrow.

256
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:38,833
Bravo, Alpargu.
You start to understand slowly.

257
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:40,266
-Turgut Agabey?
-Yes, brave boy?

258
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:43,233
How are you related to
Bamsi and Dogan Agabeys?

259
00:53:44,466 --> 00:53:46,333
They are my blood brothers.

260
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:48,933
I have a blood brother as well now.

261
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,800
Who is your blood brother?

262
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:53,633
Dundar.

263
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,233
But you blood brothers
are always together...

264
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,466
...Dundar and I are separated.

265
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,266
The world is not so large, my friend.

266
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,766
Mountains may not meet...

267
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,500
...but people can meet again.

268
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,900
The hillside is quiet. There is no one
in sight. How was your side?

269
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,000
The downside is clear as well.
This is a secure place.

270
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,466
Everywhere is clear, why are you frowning.
Because you couldn’t find an enemy?

271
00:54:44,566 --> 00:54:47,466
No, this man called Afsin
is making me anxious.

272
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:49,566
Do you know who he is?

273
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,900
I don’t know either
but it is not very important.

274
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,000
Don’t tire your pea sized brain out
with things like this.

275
00:54:57,266 --> 00:54:58,966
Your mind is not used to thinking.

276
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:02,833
Look now, we are in the field
beside the water, right?

277
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,300
Shall we wrestle so that
I can crush you to the ground?

278
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:08,833
Alright. Alright but...

279
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:11,500
...do not cry when you lose!

280
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,633
Let me go! I said let me go!

281
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:21,566
Let me go!

282
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:32,433
What about you and Aykiz Abla?

283
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,766
She is my sweetheart.

284
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,733
Are Ertugrul Agabey and
my sister Halime sweethearts too?

285
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,233
Yigit Alp?

286
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,766
What are you saying?

287
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,333
-Get the dried meat from the saddlebag.
-But, sister.

288
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,500
Go on.

289
00:55:55,933 --> 00:55:57,466
-But sister...
-Go on.

290
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:26,266
I will send Ertugrul to you, my brother.

291
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,600
Your soul will not be tormented anymore.

292
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,733
Are you fine, Shahzade?

293
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,800
Yes, thank you.

294
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,200
I am listening to my inner voice.

295
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,300
What does your inner voice say to you?

296
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,466
I think about my forefather Oguz.
He saw a dream, our Oguz Khan...

297
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:32,233
...and he pulled his golden bow
from sunrise to sunset...

298
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:38,600
...and said
this world is too small for two rulers...

299
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,466
...enough for one ruler.

300
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,333
And our Great Bilge Khan said...

301
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:48,433
...as long as the blue sky
does not fall down...

302
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:51,566
...or as long as the great earth
does not split apart...

303
00:57:51,766 --> 00:57:54,500
...no one can overrule your customs.

304
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,966
Then my grandfather Tugrul Bey...

305
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,766
...after the Dandanaqan Battle...

306
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,800
...called for the Great Council...

307
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,366
...and opened up
new horizons for our people.

308
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:19,866
And opened the road to
Rome territory for us.

309
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:23,433
And in the Rome territory, in Manzikert...

310
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,733
...Sultan Alparslan...

311
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,400
wore his shroud for a new world order
and turned these lands...

312
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:31,566
...into a state.

313
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,700
Do you know what my inner voice says,
Ertugrul?

314
00:58:43,966 --> 00:58:47,433
We need an another hero who will unite...

315
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,800
...lead and set a new vision
for these people.

316
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:16,026
Talk!

317
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,793
Who gave you the order to kill Ertugrul?

318
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:23,160
Answer me!

319
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:27,826
Who ordered you to kill
Suleyman Shah’s son?

320
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:46,260
Has not this lowlife confessed yet?

321
00:59:47,693 --> 00:59:48,993
He will soon.

322
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:52,726
We know that you are not alone.

323
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:55,260
Who helped you inside the palace?

324
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,193
Tell him, uncle...

325
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,393
...if he talks, I will spare his life.

326
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,426
Answer me.

327
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:08,293
Who helped you to attack Ameer’s guest?

328
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:12,660
It was you!

329
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,226
Answer me properly!

330
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:25,193
Who helped you?

331
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:27,326
Who? Who was he?

332
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,893
El Aziz’s vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul helped me.

333
01:00:42,426 --> 01:00:43,760
Uncle?

334
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,826
What is this man saying?

335
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:55,893
He will talk soon.

336
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,026
Someone is coming!

337
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,793
Get prepared immediately!
Master Titus is waiting for us!

338
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,860
Exercise is over! Order the knights
in the barracks to get ready!

339
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:37,360
My father used to say that you were
his most trusted man. I trust you as well.

340
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,793
That is your kindness, your highness.

341
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:42,093
I trust you more than my uncle.

342
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:47,893
Please, your highness Elanora,
do not compare Ustad-i Azam with me.

343
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,060
Titus talked about a dungeon
before he left the castle.

344
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,793
Did he want to say that my father was
thrown to a dungeon before he was killed?

345
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:01,426
I do not know, it would be best
if you asked this to Master Titus.

346
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:07,693
Before my father died, you were always
with him but you did not tell me...

347
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:11,460
...about a dungeon. Maybe my father
is still in a dungeon somewhere.

348
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,260
I am ready to hear and
know the truth, Mario.

349
01:03:14,393 --> 01:03:17,126
-No, both of you would...
-Both? My father and I?

350
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,393
No, no. I meant you and Master Titus.

351
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,460
You are lying to me as well.

352
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:21,060
Alright, put it right here.

353
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,293
Right here.

354
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:32,126
If it is ready, untie the ropes.

355
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:46,093
Children, take your lamb somewhere else.
We need that chest.

356
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:48,893
You help us as well, alright?

357
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:07,460
You old goat. I would have never thought
that Ertugrul Bey would dwell in these...

358
01:05:07,793 --> 01:05:10,093
...love issues like you.

359
01:05:10,926 --> 01:05:13,326
My brother, these things cannot be known.

360
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:16,393
It may happen to you one day as well.

361
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:22,660
You would think that you can stand up
against the whole world...

362
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,793
...but a pair of eyes would come
and smash you to the ground.

363
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,460
Which girl would like this log?
Moreover you need not a pair of eyes...

364
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:35,093
...but a pair of wrists to smash him
to the ground and I have that.

365
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:38,026
Stop right there Dogan,
stop clowning about.

366
01:05:38,693 --> 01:05:40,393
I need to understand this.

367
01:05:41,393 --> 01:05:43,826
Doesn’t Ertugrul Bey love this girl now?

368
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:49,093
He should ask permission
from her father to get married.

369
01:05:53,393 --> 01:05:55,426
Are these things so easy, brother?

370
01:05:56,326 --> 01:06:00,426
I don’t understand. If Ertugrul Bey asks
for her hand, wouldn’t her father accept?

371
01:06:05,693 --> 01:06:10,126
If that is not possible,
we can abduct Halime Sultan.

372
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,360
What does your heart say?

373
01:06:18,893 --> 01:06:22,726
State your troubles so that
we can help you if we know a way.

374
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,726
My Sultan, he wants to escape from the
hell we call palace as soon as possible.

375
01:06:35,393 --> 01:06:39,726
So that he can focus on praying to God
in the Prophet’s mosques.

376
01:06:48,026 --> 01:06:52,226
Is your desire, leaving behind
the throne like Shah Ibrahim ibn Adham...

377
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,460
...and to reach enlightenment?

378
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:59,660
But would not leaving this post
and going away mean...

379
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:03,393
...leaving behind the ones
who trust you as well?

380
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:08,026
You give your services in the palace.

381
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,126
But what will happen to the Muslim world?

382
01:07:12,993 --> 01:07:16,160
The owner of this world and Islam is God.

383
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:21,060
Your duty is to work on the path to God.

384
01:07:23,026 --> 01:07:25,326
I have never refrained from duty.

385
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,993
I did all that was asked from me
without hesitation.

386
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:34,260
-But...
-What is the despair in your mind?

387
01:07:36,726 --> 01:07:39,126
Ameer  El Aziz, my nephew.

388
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:42,293
He is just like a child.

389
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:46,426
I consume all my energy
trying to contain him.

390
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,726
But...

391
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:52,660
...messengers bring news every day.

392
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,693
From Abbasi Khalifa’s palace,
Khwarazmshah’s throne...

393
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:00,093
...from Cairo, Baghdad.

394
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,193
Wherever there is a vizier, a mayor who
cares for the problems of the people...

395
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,960
...they are being killed one by one.

396
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,826
Even in our own palace, we do not know
who is acting according to whose agenda.

397
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,426
Are the things you said...

398
01:08:18,993 --> 01:08:22,726
...an excuse to resign from your duty...

399
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,160
...or a reason to work even harder?

400
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:32,160
When you continue in your efforts
without questioning yourself...

401
01:08:32,326 --> 01:08:38,193
...God will bring you assistants and the
people whom you will help sooner or later.

402
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:41,360
My sheikh...

403
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,860
...could you do a favor
for this God’s subject?

404
01:08:45,193 --> 01:08:46,793
Favor?

405
01:08:47,426 --> 01:08:50,726
When a man asks for
a favor from his father...

406
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,860
...the father would say
“give service, my son.”

407
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,026
Do not forget...

408
01:08:56,293 --> 01:09:00,060
...those who are ready to sacrifice
themselves for their invalid beliefs...

409
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,693
...would always win over the Muslims
who are not prepared to fight for God.

410
01:09:04,826 --> 01:09:06,393
This is God’s justice.

411
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,926
God’s Son is waiting for you
at His kingdom in heaven.

412
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,893
You suffered, just like
He suffered in order to save us.

413
01:10:09,026 --> 01:10:10,260
What is inside it?

414
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,760
Argos. It will take you to God’s Son.

415
01:10:16,126 --> 01:10:20,093
When you see me again,
it means you are on your way to God.

416
01:10:56,193 --> 01:10:58,393
What is the latest situation
in the palace?

417
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:01,893
We have someone from us
in almost all the posts.

418
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:03,460
What about the vizier?

419
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:09,460
Sahabettin.
His eyes are always on his nephew. But...

420
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:13,026
...I have some plans for him as well.

421
01:11:13,426 --> 01:11:14,893
Good.

422
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:21,160
Soon, death will fall upon
all Muslim capitals.

423
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,326
Everyone will ask for help
from their neighbors.

424
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:30,426
It is of utmost importance that the
replies to letters that come to Aleppo...

425
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,760
...are stamped with El Aziz’s seal
but written by you.

426
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,926
Before calling for the Crusade army...

427
01:11:40,193 --> 01:11:44,960
...we should take hold of all
communications within the Muslim palaces.

428
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,160
I understand, sir. Do now worry.
If you don’t have any other orders...

429
01:11:49,326 --> 01:11:52,793
...I would like to return to the palace.
I would not like them to miss me.

430
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,226
What did you do about the issue of Kayis?

431
01:11:55,693 --> 01:12:01,160
Will you be able to send Suleyman Shah’s
tribe to another place away from us?

432
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:07,393
When I deal with Vizier Sahabettin,
that issue will be solved as well, sir.

433
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:12,060
Titus also said things similar to this.

434
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:17,093
He said Kayis will never
settle under our noses...

435
01:12:18,093 --> 01:12:20,960
...but they will be starting
their journey soon.

436
01:12:21,293 --> 01:12:26,160
Sir, why does the existence of Kayis
at your borders makes you worry so much?

437
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:33,193
Why are you so anxious about a tribe that
can only gather 2000 warriors at most?

438
01:12:33,993 --> 01:12:39,726
When I clear the road between Antioch and
Jerusalem for a new Crusade campaign...

439
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:46,893
...the last thing I want is
a warring Turkmen tribe settled nearby.

440
01:12:49,993 --> 01:12:54,893
If we close our eyes on Kayis today,
tomorrow they would close our eyes.

441
01:12:57,326 --> 01:12:59,693
Do not forget Saladin Ayyubi.

442
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,460
He was born in one of
the thousands of farms within Iraq.

443
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:09,726
Then he became a soldier under
the command of Nureddin Zengid.

444
01:13:10,326 --> 01:13:11,893
He was promoted.

445
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:15,926
He was only a commander amongst
hundreds of commanders.

446
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,093
You know the rest.

447
01:13:18,426 --> 01:13:21,026
If we could stop him in time...

448
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:25,160
...Jerusalem would still be
in our hands now.

449
01:13:26,793 --> 01:13:30,660
And I would not have needed to bother
with people like you!

450
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:33,826
I understand, sir.

451
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:43,026
Tell them to prepare the horses, Marcus.
We are going back to the castle.

452
01:13:45,026 --> 01:13:49,693
Once upon a time there was
a famous carpenter in Baghdad.

453
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,860
During his last days,
he carved a very beautiful pulpit.

454
01:13:56,726 --> 01:14:02,126
A very beautiful one. From walnut wood,
decorated with mother of pearl.

455
01:14:02,326 --> 01:14:07,326
It was so beautiful that everyone
would be enchanted by its beauty.

456
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,193
The news of the beautiful pulpit spread.

457
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:19,193
Everyone who came to Baghdad would go
and ask him to sell the pulpit to them...

458
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,926
...to take it to their mosque.

459
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:25,260
His answer would always be the same.

460
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:29,926
He would say: “No,
this pulpit belongs to Al Aqsa Mosque.”

461
01:14:30,893 --> 01:14:36,226
People would get bewildered as Jerusalem
was occupied by the Crusaders.

462
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,160
The carpenter would give
the same reply every single time.

463
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:47,426
This is all I can do. I am a craftsman.
I make pulpits.

464
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:53,660
Let one valiant warrior take back
Jerusalem, then the pulpit can be placed.

465
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:59,460
As time passed, the pulpit story
was heard in all the cities.

466
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,826
While everyone was telling each other
how beautiful the pulpit was...

467
01:15:07,193 --> 01:15:11,460
...the story was heard by
a boy only seven or eight years old.

468
01:15:12,226 --> 01:15:19,193
But he focused more on the will of the man
rather than the beauty of the pulpit.

469
01:15:20,693 --> 01:15:25,960
40 years passed and he took that pulpit...

470
01:15:26,826 --> 01:15:30,460
...and placed it in its rightful place
in the Al Aqsa Mosque.

471
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:35,926
The tongues spoke of him
as Saladin Ayyubi.

472
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,893
These matters are like this.

473
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:46,660
We carve out new pulpits
like that carpenter...

474
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,860
...the valiant people who will put them
in their rightful place will come out.

475
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,326
-Gundogdu.
-Yes, Usta?

476
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,226
If Suleyman Shah would have seen you
at the headquarters, he would be proud.

477
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:10,093
-I just want you to know that.
-Thank you.

478
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,060
We will break through
this ring of fire together.

479
01:17:18,226 --> 01:17:20,460
Do not forget, you are his son.

480
01:17:20,826 --> 01:17:24,693
When your origins are a wolf,
your heart is a wolf as well.

481
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,093
-Gundogdu Bey?
-What happened, Akcakoca?

482
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,060
There are some things
I need to talk with you.

483
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,793
Aykiz...

484
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,026
...Gokce is not well.

485
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,926
Her troubles are deep
but she still keeps quiet.

486
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,726
She refrains from talking to me...

487
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,426
...can you talk with her?

488
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,226
I see her condition as well, Mother Hayme.

489
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:18,726
But you know as well...

490
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,060
...the remedy of her troubles
is not with me.

491
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,393
I know.

492
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,426
I know but...

493
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:38,726
Gokce is like her late mother...

494
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,460
...she keeps silent and burns within.

495
01:19:42,193 --> 01:19:44,393
But being so silent is not good.

496
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,293
Aykiz...

497
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,160
Gokce?

498
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,793
Let me help you.

499
01:20:21,226 --> 01:20:23,760
There are only a few things left anyway.

500
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,660
You are in sorrow because
they accuse Ertugrul Bey.

501
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,426
Do not worry, the truth will come out.

502
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,460
Of course it will.

503
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:00,326
We should pray that they are well.

504
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:04,660
We could not say goodbye when Turgut left.

505
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,026
I have a feeling that a bad thing
is going to happen.

506
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:13,826
My mind is always with him.

507
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,726
Hope is the best medicine for even
the deadliest nightmares.

508
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,160
You know very well...

509
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,026
...Turgut will return to the tribe.

510
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:29,960
His return will be returning to you.

511
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,660
You will rejoice with your loved one.

512
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:40,726
But the separation between
Ertugrul and I is not distance.

513
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:43,760
Even if he returns...

514
01:21:44,893 --> 01:21:48,126
...even if he sits beside me,
I will be the furthest one from him.

515
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,993
It will be like looking at the sun
behind the insurmountable mountains.

516
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,826
Bey...

517
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:16,060
...first I thought it was because of
the famine and did not gave importance.

518
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,060
But, the matter is grave.

519
01:22:20,093 --> 01:22:21,660
What is your opinion?

520
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:24,360
Plague.

521
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:31,226
Black death?

522
01:22:32,093 --> 01:22:33,693
What do we need to do?

523
01:22:34,926 --> 01:22:36,160
Bey...

524
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,226
...I checked the whole tribe.

525
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:43,293
I stamped the ill animals with red paint
and gathered them all here.

526
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,293
If we exterminate all of them...

527
01:22:49,026 --> 01:22:52,060
...with God’s help,
we can avoid this disaster.

528
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,793
If God permits, Akcakoca, if God permits.

529
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,760
If God permits, Bey.

530
01:22:58,093 --> 01:23:00,126
Do whatever you need to do.

531
01:23:00,326 --> 01:23:02,826
Find someone trustable
and keep it a secret.

532
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,160
The tribe is in the brink of havoc,
we don’t need criers of disaster as well.

533
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,760
-May God turn it into a good deed.
-Alright, Bey.

534
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,126
Everyone is nervous as it is,
why do you call me here, Selcan Hatun?

535
01:23:39,326 --> 01:23:41,760
Why do you worry
when you see me, Kurdoglu?

536
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:45,326
You should think about what
you will do when Suleyman Shah wakes up.

537
01:23:45,793 --> 01:23:49,126
That is not my problem, your husband,
who tries to take advantage of...

538
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,326
...his father’s illness should be worried.

539
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,993
You think I am one of the Beys
you convinced at the headquarters.

540
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,893
Don’t I know the things you are up to?

541
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,326
Don’t lose your breath and tell me...

542
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,093
...you beat Gundogdu at the headquarters.

543
01:24:06,826 --> 01:24:08,860
What will you do when
Suleyman Shah wakes up?

544
01:24:10,026 --> 01:24:13,193
Don’t you worry about these things,
Selcan Hatun. I will find a way.

545
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:15,460
Suleyman Shah will be leaving tomorrow.

546
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,860
They will be going to Aleppo,
to find a remedy for his illness.

547
01:24:19,026 --> 01:24:21,026
If he gets up again...

548
01:24:21,426 --> 01:24:23,393
...think about your fate then.

549
01:24:26,293 --> 01:24:28,026
What are you trying to say?

550
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,126
Speak clearly,
do not beat around the bush.

551
01:24:33,226 --> 01:24:37,426
If our Suleyman Shah who sleeps
with high fever, God forbid...

552
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:43,060
...gives his last breath tonight.
Even I would say Azrael was the culprit...

553
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,393
...I would mourn and cry at his grave.

554
01:24:51,926 --> 01:24:53,360
How will it be done?

555
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:56,360
Tonight...

556
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,893
...I will take Gundogdu and
Mother Hayme out of the tent...

557
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:01,726
...the rest is up to you.

558
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:08,860
If Suleyman Shah dies, I would revenge my
father’s death and you would become Bey.

559
01:26:36,193 --> 01:26:41,193
30 knights have been sent
upon Sir Titus’s request.

560
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,960
Ustad-i Azam, you have a guest
from Vatican in your room.

561
01:26:47,893 --> 01:26:49,326
He is waiting for you.

562
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,793
My dear friend Petruccio.

563
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:22,926
Cardinal Thomas.
It is an honor to see you.

564
01:27:23,326 --> 01:27:25,960
You should have informed us beforehand.

565
01:27:32,993 --> 01:27:35,793
I did not want to interrupt
your Aleppo escapade.

566
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:41,293
You are still being the eyes and
the ears of our Holy Father.

567
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:47,760
His highness the Pope appreciates
your efforts but he has some reservations.

568
01:27:49,026 --> 01:27:52,326
He needs to be convinced for
a new Crusader campaign.

569
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,393
How can he be convinced?

570
01:27:55,793 --> 01:28:00,760
You have to take back the holy relics
those infidel Mohammadans stole from us.

571
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,293
I am guessing you know
who is hiding those holy relics.

572
01:28:25,693 --> 01:28:28,760
-Hello, my brother.
-Brother?

573
01:28:30,893 --> 01:28:33,026
Very wrong. Very.

574
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,193
I remember the day our mother
gave you birth. Shame.

575
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,260
Brothers should not treat
each other like this.

576
01:28:44,393 --> 01:28:46,026
Get out of here.

577
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:51,460
You did not only shatter your brother.
You shattered your whole family.

578
01:28:53,126 --> 01:28:54,826
Was it worth it?

579
01:28:55,893 --> 01:29:01,260
You went after a bedouin.
And destroyed your wife, your children...

580
01:29:01,426 --> 01:29:05,793
...your cause and everything else
with your own hands.

581
01:29:07,726 --> 01:29:09,460
But we are brothers.

582
01:29:13,026 --> 01:29:19,726
If you can bring me the items
in Ibn Arabi’s chest...

583
01:29:21,326 --> 01:29:24,793
...I can grant you your family.

584
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,026
Do you still have hope that
I would serve for your goals?

585
01:29:33,293 --> 01:29:36,393
Don’t ever talk to me about loyalty.

586
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:43,393
When you abandoned the Son of God
and sold out the Templars...

587
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,260
...you proved your loyalty.

588
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:52,460
Why should you not do the same again?

589
01:29:55,893 --> 01:29:57,693
I promise you...

590
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:02,293
...if you can bring back the items
in that chest...

591
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,893
...you can see your family again.

592
01:30:09,193 --> 01:30:11,760
I know that you don’t trust me anymore.

593
01:30:13,426 --> 01:30:16,226
For you to trust me once again...

594
01:30:17,693 --> 01:30:21,893
...I can arrange you to meet
your little daughter at midnight.

595
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,026
Is my Elanora here?

596
01:31:01,093 --> 01:31:02,193
Good.

597
01:31:03,126 --> 01:31:05,293
All the birds are in the same cage.

598
01:31:41,426 --> 01:31:44,126
-Gokce, you go and sleep now.
-Alright, sister.

599
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,026
Sister?

600
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,226
-Hatun?
-Sister?

601
01:31:58,793 --> 01:32:01,893
Quick, call Mother Hayme. Bring her here!

602
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,960
Gundogdu, something is happening.

603
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,660
Gundogdu, something is happening.

604
01:32:10,693 --> 01:32:14,260
Alright, Hatun. Alright. Calm down.
I will run and bring the midwife.

605
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:18,093
Be quick, hurry up!

606
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,326
Mother Hayme.

607
01:32:34,993 --> 01:32:36,260
Come, my girl.

608
01:32:37,326 --> 01:32:39,793
Gokce, what is the hurry? What happened?

609
01:32:39,926 --> 01:32:43,026
Mother Hayme, my sister is in great pain.
She asked for you.

610
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:50,060
I hope it is not a bad thing.

611
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,226
Akcakoca, midwife Hatun,
do we have permission?

612
01:33:00,926 --> 01:33:04,293
Yes, Bey? Akcakoca is outside.
I hope there is no bad news.

613
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:08,126
No, Selcan has some bad cramps.
We have to go to the tent immediately.

614
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:09,993
I will just get my cloak.

615
01:33:53,393 --> 01:33:56,293
-Is Selcan Hatun pregnant, Bey?
-If God permits, come on.

616
01:34:03,893 --> 01:34:06,293
-My girl.
-I can’t stand the pain, mother.

617
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:15,326
Come on. Keep calm, my girl. Calm down.

618
01:34:16,926 --> 01:34:18,160
Let me check.

619
01:34:20,726 --> 01:34:23,060
Calm down, I am just going to check.

620
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,093
Don’t do it, don’t!

621
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,426
I hope it is not serious.

622
01:34:43,893 --> 01:34:45,060
Don’t.

623
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,226
Is my Bey father alone, mother?

624
01:36:11,793 --> 01:36:14,426
No. Rahman is with him. Do not worry.

625
01:36:18,326 --> 01:36:21,960
You go to my father, Gundogdu.
He should not be alone.

626
01:36:24,226 --> 01:36:25,360
I said go.

627
01:36:49,793 --> 01:36:51,026
Kurdoglu.

628
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,260
You have passed the Alp trials.

629
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:04,060
You fought with wolves and bears, faced
many dangers to return to your tribe.

630
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:10,760
You now have the right to carry
the title of Alp with honor.

631
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:16,860
But now the lesson you have to learn
is much more important than all these.

632
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:21,860
Being an Alp is not finding food
in times of need...

633
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:25,126
...but to stand strong
in the face of difficulties.

634
01:37:25,393 --> 01:37:27,026
Suleyman Shah...

635
01:37:28,993 --> 01:37:30,793
...Kurdoglu...

636
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,260
...Alpsungur...

637
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,393
...take an arrow from your quivers.

638
01:37:40,993 --> 01:37:42,126
Break them!

639
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:54,193
Take one more arrow from
your quivers and give them to me.

640
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:23,026
If you take the advice of
your forefathers and always be united...

641
01:38:23,193 --> 01:38:25,660
...you would be unbreakable
just like these arrows.

642
01:38:25,793 --> 01:38:29,926
From now on never let your names
and selves be separated.

643
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:34,893
Those who talk about you,
should always refer to your togetherness.

644
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:34,796
Why is it dark in here?

645
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,096
Rahman!

646
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:00,363
Yes, Bey?

647
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,696
Why are these oil lamps not lit, Rahman?

648
01:40:23,163 --> 01:40:24,430
I don’t know, Bey.

649
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:54,530
You would not be aware
even if doomsday had started.

650
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,263
Bey?

651
01:41:02,763 --> 01:41:05,296
-Find something and block that tear.
-Yes, Bey.

652
01:41:07,563 --> 01:41:09,830
No one will know about what happened here.

653
01:41:10,196 --> 01:41:12,163
Don’t ever leave my father alone.

654
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,163
Yes, Bey.

655
01:41:36,463 --> 01:41:39,696
Thank God. The cramps were a good news.

656
01:41:40,696 --> 01:41:45,063
Road to motherhood is painful
but the end is a blessing.

657
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:48,430
You made us happy in these hard times.

658
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:52,796
May God permit us to hold
the child in our arms.

659
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:54,496
If God permits, mother.

660
01:41:54,663 --> 01:41:58,296
If my Bey father recovers soon,
he would be happy too.

661
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:03,063
Of course he would. We were yearning
for a grandchild for a long time.

662
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:05,463
Of course he would be happy.

663
01:42:06,596 --> 01:42:08,696
-Sister.
-My Gokce.

664
01:42:24,396 --> 01:42:25,696
Gundogdu...

665
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:30,763
Son, we have good news.

666
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,730
Our bride Selcan is pregnant.

667
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:38,263
He will continue our progeny and
become Bey of the tribe, if God permits.

668
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,530
If God permits. Thank you, mother.

669
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:49,163
-May you be blessed.
-Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

670
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:53,030
You should not have left
my Bey father alone.

671
01:42:54,163 --> 01:42:56,563
He is not alone, Hatun.
Rahman is with him.

672
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:59,796
You take care and do not worry
about other things.

673
01:43:24,063 --> 01:43:25,263
What a bitch.

674
01:43:26,463 --> 01:43:30,396
First she sent me to the tent.
Then sent her husband after me.

675
01:43:32,796 --> 01:43:37,696
So she wanted Suleyman Shah dead in order
to take revenge for her father Alpsungur.

676
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:42,630
And she was going to make me
a bait for Gundogdu at the same time.

677
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:44,763
Two birds with one stone.

678
01:43:45,596 --> 01:43:47,830
I could not work out the bitch’s game.

679
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:59,496
When a wolf gets old,
it becomes the laughingstock of the dogs.

680
01:44:01,563 --> 01:44:04,430
What do you say, Alpargu?
Are we too old now?

681
01:44:40,563 --> 01:44:44,663
Their cries tear my heart apart. I wish
we could kill them before setting on fire.

682
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:48,330
This illness is not like
the ones you know, son.

683
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:54,396
If you touch the meat or blood of these
animals, the whole tribe would be doomed.

684
01:45:45,596 --> 01:45:50,063
Our Holy Mother,
give me a sign to bring a tinge of hope.

685
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:55,196
If my father is alive
and if I can meet him...

686
01:45:55,796 --> 01:45:57,430
...give me a sign.

687
01:46:03,663 --> 01:46:05,130
Your highness...

688
01:46:06,063 --> 01:46:07,396
...are you here?

689
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:10,563
Amen.

690
01:46:11,463 --> 01:46:15,596
You told me that you were prepared
to learn the truth.

691
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:19,696
Then come with me.

692
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,363
-Is it here?
-Yes.

693
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:50,130
You never saw me, your highness.

694
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:54,530
Is my father behind this door?

695
01:47:15,496 --> 01:47:17,363
-Father?
-My daughter?

696
01:47:17,696 --> 01:47:19,430
-Father!
-My girl!

697
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,463
Father!

698
01:47:23,196 --> 01:47:24,763
-Father!
-My girl!

699
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:27,596
Father,
I thought you were killed years ago.

700
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:32,563
I always thought of you.
Hope of seeing you again kept me alive.

701
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:35,030
Father, why are you here?

702
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:40,196
Your mother, your sister and
you are in my dreams every night.

703
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:45,496
-Mother...
-What happened to your mother, my girl?

704
01:47:47,463 --> 01:47:49,563
We lost her to plague last year.

705
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:56,230
Father, why are they holding you here?

706
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:01,096
Uncle told us that you were dead.

707
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:05,196
Does my uncle know that you are here?

708
01:48:06,096 --> 01:48:08,596
I will talk with him and
take you out of here.

709
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:11,130
My girl!

710
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:15,363
Father?

711
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,596
My girl!

712
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:23,063
-Father.
-My daughter.

713
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,130
My baby!

714
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:31,063
My baby! My Elanora!

715
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:36,496
My baby, my Elanora!

716
01:48:40,396 --> 01:48:42,730
Help me God!

717
01:49:11,396 --> 01:49:13,330
Help me God!

718
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:47,063
In short, Ertugrul Bey,
just like the poet says...

719
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:52,330
I burned and turned to ash
I became a guide for the sufferers

720
01:50:53,396 --> 01:50:57,530
I was a Shah and became a subject
With the fire of your love

721
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:08,730
With your permission, Bey.

722
01:51:12,163 --> 01:51:14,096
It is your turn to take watch.

723
01:51:49,496 --> 01:51:50,730
I could not sleep.

724
01:51:59,363 --> 01:52:00,530
Halime.

725
01:52:04,163 --> 01:52:05,396
You know that...

726
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:09,063
...I have a thousand problems.

727
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:13,163
Their solutions are in my power...

728
01:52:13,596 --> 01:52:15,630
...and my power is in my belief.

729
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:20,630
But there is one problem.

730
01:52:22,263 --> 01:52:24,696
It is the most beautiful problem...

731
01:52:25,463 --> 01:52:27,063
...but it burns my heart.

732
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:33,430
And its solution is only with you.

733
01:52:39,563 --> 01:52:44,430
That beautiful eyed gazelle swept away
my feet and made me join its path.

734
01:52:46,596 --> 01:52:49,230
It took me to you
and threw me to the sea of love.

735
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:53,363
I was just about to kill it but...

736
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:57,196
...it burned my heart with a fire of love.

737
01:52:59,363 --> 01:53:01,196
What I am trying to say is...

738
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:07,630
...since the first moment I saw you...
-Please, Ertugrul. Stop.

739
01:53:09,496 --> 01:53:10,763
I shall not.

740
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:16,330
I cannot send you away with my own hands.

741
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:19,696
Do not go.

742
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,063
Stay with me.

743
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:30,030
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

744
01:53:31,063 --> 01:53:33,030
...and my companion till the end.

745
01:53:36,696 --> 01:53:41,163
You are a valiant and honest brave
with a good heart, Ertugrul Bey.

746
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:47,530
We owe you not one but a thousand lives.

747
01:53:53,196 --> 01:53:55,463
But my fate is sealed a long time ago.

748
01:53:58,796 --> 01:54:02,730
I cannot leave my father and brother
in a world of unknown to go after love.

749
01:54:06,363 --> 01:54:10,130
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

750
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:12,563
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

751
01:54:15,263 --> 01:54:17,096
This is your tongue talking.

752
01:54:17,796 --> 01:54:19,530
What about your heart?

753
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:22,796
What does your heart say, Halime?

754
01:54:48,296 --> 01:54:50,563
My heart and my tongue talk the same.

755
01:54:53,563 --> 01:54:54,630
Don’t go.

756
01:55:06,363 --> 01:55:07,563
Halime!

757
01:55:13,396 --> 01:55:14,530
Halime?

758
01:55:19,696 --> 01:55:20,830
Halime!

759
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:26,696
Halime! Halime!

760
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:29,263
Halime!
