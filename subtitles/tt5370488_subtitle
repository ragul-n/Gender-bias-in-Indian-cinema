Govindhan Nair of Padikkal,
his grand son's name is Prem Nasir

130
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,589
Just look at the way he smiles

131
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:47,061
Look, from today onwards you don't
need this name nor father's movie

132
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,530
Did you understand?

133
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,640
From today onwards you are
Vinayan, Vinaya Chandran

134
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,309
lf you remain with father
turning film reels

135
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,843
Better you study well
and try to get a job

136
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,109
Come here l say

137
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,807

00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,721
Look, did you see Nasir?

141
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,553
Did you like?

142
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,502
After the death of Balachandran,
young Vinayan become -

143
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,572
- projector operator of Sree Devi theatre

144
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,332
Along with the memories of father

145
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,876
Projector and Sree Devi theatre was
held close to mind, by Vinayan

146
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,854
Fellow, coming
start..

147
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,757
Come on hit

148
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,169
Hit man
Hit softly

149
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,166
Fellow, today l'll show you

150
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,237
You will be taught a lesson
My God!

151
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,138
Man, it worked out
What are these guys doing?

152
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,503
Hey fellow, give way

153
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,925
This is the car of Bhagavan

154
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,726
Stop it, stop it
Just move back fellow!

155
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,725
He has given it
Come, will go

156
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,784
On that day two things had
happened at Peruvathoor Kadavu

157
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,280
Firstly, beginning of
Vinayan, Sreedevi's love

158
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,959
Secondly Pallatukara and
Vadakkumbhagam natives -

159
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,522
- became die-hard enemies

160
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,664
To find the reason for
that, should know Bhagavan

161
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,298
Again its the tale of Bhagavan

162
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,441
The headman of Peruvathoor
Kadavu, Viswanathan Menon

163
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,607
The reason why he was called
Bhagavan by compatriots

164
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,480
lts because of a gun

165
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,763
This is German made revolver

166
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,696
ln 1936

167
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,737
This was presented to the family
of Bhagavan by two Germans

168
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,544
Even on firing by looking at the sky

169
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,517
Bullet will pierce the
chest of the aimed person

170
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,625
That is the history

171
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:56,371
Hey you, lad hailing from Pallattukara
don't run, on running l'll kill both

172
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,446
Stop l say

173
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,886
Don't shoot

174
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,987
What is this man?

175
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,384
Forgot to load the bullets

176
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,731
Gone is it?
On that midnight

177
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,063
As Bhagavan's eldest
daughter eloped

178
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,737
Natives of Pallatukara and
Vadakkumbhagam -

179
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,637
- became die-hard enemies

180
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,937
What more after dusk,
the entry without reason -

181
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,911
- to two shores were
canceled by Bhagavan

182
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:33,610
But still the roosters at
Pallatukara kept on hooting

183
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,023
Hey fellow, turn this off

184
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,396
lts not getting turned off
Don't play a fool, turn it off

185
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,499
Then do it brain child,
fool is your father

186
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,565
Move off the hand

187
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,399
Some one turn this off, instead
of playing harmonium

188
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,938
Can't turn this off, man
That's the same thing which l told

189
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,938
Can't turn it off

190
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,336
Was it a gun shot which was heard?

191
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,841
Fellow, he might have
come with the gun

192
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,148
My mother!
Who is that?

193
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,420
Not dead, coming as a super man
Fellow, turn it off

194
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,454
Not eating this
You will get the scolding now

195
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,615
You idiots! Turn off the song!

196
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,852
Turn it off man, or will
shower with obscene words

197
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:17,962
Will anything happen?
That call was intended to you

198
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,825
Called me also

199
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,437
My dear Saint, kindly turn this off

200
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,969
Has the Saint undertaken the
job of turning off the tape?

201
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,870
Don't beat

202
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,476
Hey Jose are you a fool
or are you acting as a fool?

203
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,773
Only acting
He and his anklets..Balls!

204
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,915
My mother!
Hell with it!

205
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,122
This thing got turned off
Get lost you dog!

206
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,616
Man, drive the vehicle or else
will die on Bhagavan's gun shot

207
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,159
Drive fast
ls it a Benz?.

208
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,791
Just drive like that and go

209
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,999
Why do you want to insert this
through the sill of his house?

210
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,031
Just drive - Not because you
guys played the music

211
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,898
Will just hit you
Just go

212
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,999
Seems 'Neer' has climbed
morning itself

213
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,771
lsn't he a son of 'Odiyan' (dalit)?
Can't say when he'll be seen

214
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,728
l'll stop this alcohol distillery

215
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,927
Stop kidding man

216
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,265
lf you've the guts, inform this

217
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,533
No doubt why cops couldn't find
on searching all over the native

218
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,303
lt was hidden on top
of this, wasn't it?

219
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,703
We also searched a lot

220
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:54,281
Did you know, on the sky thousands
of toddy shops have opened

221
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,179
''Hey you, you are the one
that makes one to whirl''

to the wall of Ravana''

236
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,976
''Hey you Ravana, what's your
reason to abduct Seetha?''

237
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,608
''Did someone tell you or
did you think in your mind?''

238
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,687
''No one has told me,
l had such a thought in my mind''

239
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:02,906
''Butterfly, today do you
have honey, to give it to me?''

240
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:11,222
''Could you tell me, when you
leave, l'll also join you''

On writing 'raa' inside
another 'raa' it becomes 'tha'

263
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,415
Hey boy, son

264
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,083
On writing another 'raa' along
with 'tha' it becomes 'naa'

265
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,493
On writing 'raa' inside
another 'raa' it becomes 'tha'

266
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,595
Son, that's correct

267
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,461
Likewise on writing
'raa' along with another 'raa'..

268
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,944
You've attracted me, like anything

269
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,874
Really attracted? Did you
remit the chitty money?

270
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,549
This is the problem, could
have sat on some tree top

271
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,087
What did you say?
On that night, when we eloped

272
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,918
Do you think about that Vanaja?

273
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,923
What rubbish? At this old
age, on the night of eloping

274
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,527
Child, is here
l'm not saying anything

275
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,291
Hey lady, the wines strength
increases as it gets old

276
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,365
This love is also just like that

277
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,001
That's the policy of this Rajan

278
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,035
Father, your name is 'Neer' isn't it?

279
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,635
'Neer' is yourfather - Father and son
play the game of telling names

280
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,274
l've got lot of work at the kitchen

281
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,402
No, don'tjust go like that
Stop, stop!

282
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:27,381
''Lady who went to bath during early
dawn, one who stood at the fence''

283
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,486
''You lady''

284
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,554
The boy is there
''You lady''

285
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,925
While standing near the fence?
Father saw a bird's nest, son

286
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,226
Will only see the bird's
nest won't get the bird, today

287
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,090
Father, which is the bird?
Crow

288
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:47,635
So, is the crow a bird?
At times, a crow becomes a bird

289
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,438
ls that so?

290
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,539
Has father's Prem Nasir, reached?

291
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,086
Why didn't 'Ummer, Jayan and
Keerikkadan Jose join you?

292
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,155
No, over here there is
only 'ever green hero'

293
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,292
An ever green hero, you
stink like anything

294
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:13,956
The section of people
that toils, may sweat a bit

295
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,188
Hey fellow, who toils

296
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,892
How many years it has been since l
told you to pass that tenth standard

297
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,594
And register the name in
employment exchange

298
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,462
Simply you roam around,
turning the movie reel

299
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,971
Mother, serve the
tapioca for me also

300
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,373
When Malutty passes the tenth
exam, there'll be no one to teach you

301
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,172
Look mother don't talk to me as if
talking to kids, did you hearthat?

302
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,575
There is no use of being an adult

303
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:39,981
Team DrC

304
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,091
Will just whack you, did you buy the
item which l told in the morning?

305
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,028
No
Forgot

306
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,030
Look, for both of you l'll boil water
and give, tomorrow did you hear?

307
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,428
Will simply shake the
head on saying anything

308
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,660
There is no lapse on that

309
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,437
Has grown up, what's the use?

310
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,697
Don't laugh, its
applicable to you also

311
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,236
Brother, will the movie 'Vandanam'
reach day after tomorrow?

312
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,468
lf it comes..?
Will you take me, along?

313
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,214
Can think about it - Then Sree Devi
chechi might come, no?

314
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,018
Go girl

315
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,231

ladders of success

Hey fellow!

Are you going for a 'Dandi march?'
(salt march)

322
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,421
Sorry buddy, l was
taken to election days

323
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,148
The love story between police
officer Unnikrishnan and Jatha

324
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,586
Man, its not Jatha, its Gatha

325
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,193
The ballard of love

326
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,162
Unnikutta, come with the sister

327
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,034
This is good man - On eating this
mixed with sugar, its deadly

328
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,433
Who has named this as gum?
Gusthilcum D'souza

The glue is over,

332
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,505
One more bucket? Are you
licking it or spreading it?

333
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,407
Jerks!

334
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:20,013
''The toddy has over flown, the
tummy is full, l stroll with a song''

335

Tutor Neer, your song is deadly

336

How many years have you been?
How many years it has been?

337

lts been lot of years, it has
become old and rotten

338
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:34,228
Hey you Kelippeeru, while you
were shitting in your mother's lap

339
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,032
Has started by that time

340
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:46,244
''The toddy has over flown, the
tummy is full, l stroll with a song''

341
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:50,685
The toddy flowing into your tummy,
your child's mother shouldn't know

342
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,451
How many years have you been?

343
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,818
You remain here
singing and mixing the glue

344
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,322
The notice and announcement is
done already through out the native

345
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,327
Madhavettan and the
box has not reached so far

346
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,490
Fellow, he'll come, you know
nothing about my Madhavan

347
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,795
Started the black and white
What? -Nothing at all

348
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,172
On that day, preparing the
outcome, l asked to Vanaja

349
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,666
Are you coming along with me?

350
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,103
Like that when myself and
Vanaja, eloped empty handed

351
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,372
There, at the front
stands the Madhavan

352
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,852
Did you see my Madhavan? - Fellow,
come on pour,pour two more

353
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,783
''Hanuman, jumped on to
the wall of Ravana''

354
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,822
''Hey you Ravana, what's your
reason to abduct Seetha?''

355
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,189
''Did someone tell you or
did you think in your mind?''

356
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,129
''No one has told me, l had
such a thought in my mind''

357
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,536
Fellow, have you reached
straight to sixth standard?

358
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,468
How many did you have?
Three, four

359
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,839
So, you got the box is it?
Fellow, that's a story to tell

360
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,546
Morning itself, after collecting the
money from Bhagavan on interest

361
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,183
On reaching the distribution
company, what has happened?

362
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,184
The box has not reached, after
hours of waiting when the box came

363
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,584
Can l come on a bus with that?

364
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,190
What is inside the box?
Which is the movie?

365
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,384
Whose movie is it?
Hundreds of questions

366
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,554
Finally took a taxi and
reached here, he also taxed me

367
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,232
Good
After repaying Bhagavan's money

368
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,800
And after remitting the current
bill, this is what is left behind

369
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,437
Now the only expectation
of Madhavettan is -

370
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,631
- there will be some
footfalls to theatre

371
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,767
So the movie will
be screened tomorrow

372
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,277
Then, tomorrow she will also come

373
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,938
'Sree Devi'

374
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,552
Look at his smile

375
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:52,135

376
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,970
Mother come here

377
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,688

378
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,390
Son, shall l do some
more make ups?

379
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,895
Not needed right now
Don't want? - No

380
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,959
Do it mother, today arrives isn't it?
Who? Who arrives?

381
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,738
..Well new movie!

382
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,599
Finished one tin of powder

383
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,242
That is the only result!

384
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,206
Girl, l'll show you, did you hear?

385
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,381
Enough, go fast or
else that person will leave

386
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,551
On this topic you don't
become my elder sister, okay

387
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,221
Okay
Go, go, go girl

388
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,257
Go girl!

389
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,694
''On the paths you go''

390
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,327
''On the paths you go''

391
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,903
''On the paths you go''

392
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,459
lnstead of waiting
like this, come fast fellow

393
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,869
What is this boy?

394
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,408
This bike is faulty, that's why

395
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,052
Why is he standing
here at this hour?.

396
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,984
Just horn twice and leave
Okay Anna

397
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,460
Sound isn't clear,
will try the other one

398
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,460
Come on horn, fellow

399
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,762
Got it
Fool, not this horn

400
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,764
Horn the other sound
Anna, right now it's not working

401
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,547
Go man

402
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,539
My goodness!

403
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,469
Bhagavan, never used to let
out his second daughter

404
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,971
But on the day when new movie
arrives at the theatre, she'll come

405
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,166
Sri..Devi!

406
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,141
On that day, our projector
operator sir is on public holiday

407
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,689
Man, it seems a new shirt
No, just for fun

408
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,726
Fellow, where is
the son and Vanaja?

409
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,993
After seating them inside,
only then l came here

410
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,644
Whatever it is, it is a great joy
watching movie through this

411
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,170
That's true

412
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,958
Lad, move
Go man

413
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,288
Brother can you sit to that side?

Madhava, today the
foot falls are very high

00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,840
Yeah, crowd is there, but
it should happen every day

422
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,777
Small theatres like this,
one by one its getting closed

423
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,350
Look, regarding the
generator its doubtful

424
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,844
lf the current fails,
might get dumped

425
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,149
When one is mad over here,
he and his babble, get lost fellow

426
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:18,995
One guy isn't worried of all these
He is doing what he knows!

427
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,341
Look, got glued on to the chair!

My goodness!

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,254
Who did that fellow?
Your rocket struck in his ear!

432
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,795
Come on call

chest like the early dawn''

00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:34,223
''Like the season of
flowers, shall caress gently''

450
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,028
''You may come as a dream''

451
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,869
''Like the early dawn''

452
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,902
''With the finger tips, within me''

453
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,145
''Like the season of flowers''

454
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,720
''To caress, come
without notice..Gently''

455
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,932
''Like a wedding
locket made of moonlight''

456
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:49,332
''You come riding on a bright star''

''Didn't the Cuckoo bird sing in
the ears, like your soft voice?''

00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:06,812
''The wishes..
Which is never ending''

459
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,087
''Without speaking..
we know everything''

460
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,448
Wept to the core,
get up man, the movie is over

461
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,414
Over?

462
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,449
Don't simply sit dreaming, man

463
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,054
Buddy, still there was
no need to throw that key

464
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,247
That was a foolishness

465
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,889
ln between that, he and his..

466
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,091
She is looking, looking!

467
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,826
Anna, here they come
Stop fellow, Prem Nasir!

468
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:48,498
Allow me to pass through

469
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,497
How dare you, to throw
rocket on to my face?

470
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,623
Where are you looking man?

471
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,833
To Annan's rocket, no
look towards Annan's face

472
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,132
Dear Potha, today we fired rocket

473
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,332
Perhaps tomorrow we may fire
an atom bomb, did you hear?

474
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,100
They have farted now

475
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,209
Sorry, in the morning it was 'dal'

476
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,972
Anna, someone broke the
head light of our auto

477
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,580
My..God!

478
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,581
Anna, broke your head light only,
they broke it, say something

479
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,647
Don't think it'll get over, right here

480
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:17,384
What if, not over?.
Will show you on next festival

481
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,323
Finished?
Anna, asking whetherfinished

482
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,893
Hey you son of aunty!

483
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,364
Hey fellow, shree Biju,
you don't come to our fort

484
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,334
Don't blow a decorative fan

485
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,671
Just move off
Move, man, go man

486
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,873
Anna, could have killed, no?

487
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,644
Madhavoo..
Yeah

488
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,642
On checking our interest account,
its totally a loss account

489
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,419
Kovacha, right away collect
the Madhavan's loss account

490
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,318
My goodness, Menon
sir l'll bring it to the house

491
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,550
Okay all right, the movie
is really boring, man

492
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,661
Don't you have ' spiritual movies'
which kids can watch?

493
00:43:56,033 --> 00:44:01,096
Nowadays, kids are interested
on fights and subjects on love

494
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,529
Kovacha, don'tjust gawk,
drive the car

495
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,982
Vinaya, Sree Devi!

496
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,191

497
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,562
Gone
Yeah, gone

498
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,735
Do you know how painful it is?

499
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,516
Lalettan Ki Jai, come on jerks say it

500
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,551
Don't stop keep on calling

501
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,196
Boy, what you told is correct

502
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,725
Now people have began
to watch movie in the town

503
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,661
ln the present situation, we can't
make the facilities in the town, over here

504
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,271
When new movie
arrives, people will come

505
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,236
Take it

506
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,567
By the way Madhavetta,
the festival is about to approach

507
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,302
What's up with the
new festival movie?

00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,276
Has arranged the new
release, there is problem to get it

509
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,745
Then what is there?
But boy, there is a big problem

510
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,345
When l'm here, what is
the problem which you face?

511
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,015
Now, from the panchayat people
will come to inspect the theatre

512
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:30,249
lnspection. With the present facility,
its difficult to get the release

513
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,686
Wait Madhavetta, let the
festival committee get finished

514
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,066
Will get some advance
of that light and sound

515
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,530
And the balance
we'll ask to Bhagavan

516
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,271
Already there is a lot to repay

517
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,563
And today he spoke
with a double meaning

518
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,202
l hate the sight of that person

519
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,639
Who has named him?
With this name Bhagavan(God)

520
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,337
Fellow, who has named you, 'Neer?'

521
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,608
That is done by all
these..l'm not saying anything

00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,821
Great! - What is great?
The stuff is great

523
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:07,462
''The sky is cloudy, mind is
cloudy rains with thunder''

524
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:18,469
''The sky is cloudy, mind is cloudy
rains with thunder''

525
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:34,054
''The toddy has over flown, the
tummy is full, l stroll with a song''

526
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:48,466
While returning the cassette,
something like kiss

527
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,095
Orchards of Arecanut and roof tops

528
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,506

607
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,383
Was it this jerk?

00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,083
Put the 'bedi' down

00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:07,420
Will pay cash

00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,858
The cash which is stolen
from father's pocket, no?

611
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,160
The bus has left

612
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,527
Don't bluff
No education?

613
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:15,960
That's not there, shall l take

620
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:36,586
Hey fellow, Gagan

Then its a hit over here, no?
Why not?

622
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,193
How come you are late

00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,029
Jayanthi, was bit late to come
Jayanthi?

00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,892
Even otherwise girls are

00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,828
Then where is she?
Who?

626

Jayanthi!

627
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,934
Some Brahmin girl from an
ancient family - ls it so?

628
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,203
Fellow, its a train
A train? Jayanthi, Jayanthi Janatha

00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,168
From where, is sir coming now?

630
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,015
Beyond your imagination
from Bombay

631
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,843
ln the dark dungeon of
underworld, l was with Milkha Singh

632
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,883
Six days in a week, it is war

633
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,518
Why are you laughing?
Then what about balance one day?

634
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,227
What?
One day?

635
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,734
Sunday generally
its a holiday for us

636
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:30,129
On Sundays we don't
go for underworld jobs

637
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,968
Then, why did you come here?

638
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,836
ls it to remove the sun glass?
Nostalgia

639
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,708
Thousands of secrets,
which is left behind untold

640
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,541
To share all that with my Vinayan

641
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,512
Further more l should
show all this, won't l?

642
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,620
Will talk friendly
chat with the main person

643
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,623
Okay you go
Ajerk who is not at all humbug!

644
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,158
Prem Nasir light and
sounds, the very old boards

645
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,690
The lights which are collapsed

646
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,697
Wonderful! There is no
change at all. Very good

647
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,097
You jerk, insulting the shop?

648
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,895
From now on never
enter inside the shop

649
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,097
Simply saying
No, seriously saying

650
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,607
Hey fellow, l've told you thousand
times, stay here at native

651
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,973
With these kind of tricks

652
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,843
One Prem Nasir shop owner

653
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,575
Hey you fellow Vinayan, you had
forgotten everything, years back

654
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,655
To write the letter for
you, l wrote that letter

655
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,189
You gave that letter by mistake and
when Thekel Janu got that letter

656
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,219
This fellow - You said, from
now on letter is not possible

657
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,118
Gagan, how much is
the number lock?

658
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,318
Of the suitcase
319..

659
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,097
For what? Keep the
suitcase there itself

660
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,860
Number lock? Again l told
the idea of cassette

661
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,935
Go man
Apart from all this

662
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,537
On the hair knot - With the
petals of 'Tulsi' (A sacred plant)

663
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,299
Along with eyes
decorated with Kajol

664
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,975
Those secrets which
he didn't say to her

665
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,603
Like a swan you have
send the messages to her

666
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:46,611
ls this not what you
were about to say?

667
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,774
Yeah, indeed buddy

668
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,317
So, you have not
forgotten all this, no?

669
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,814
No buddy, not only
l have not forgotten

670
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,649
l very well recollect all that
That's why

671
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:54,949
l told, get out, you fellow!

672
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,191
This is 'walk man' -What?
its not the man who walks

673
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,059
Forthose who love
through the cassette

674
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,827
Now they can love
by walking, sitting or lying

675
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,634
You don't want this, do you?

676
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,603
Hey fellow!
What is it? -You swan Gagan!

677
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,035
What is it?

678
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,174
Leave, the suit will get torn
Leave, leave!

679
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,880
What is he doing?
Hearing music - Whose music?

680
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,080
Michael Jackson

681
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,279
So, he is a Christian, isn't it?

682
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,892
No he is a Nair,
Michael Jackson Nair!

683
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,118
Look to that side and stand
ls it so?

684
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,353
What all things he has to know?

685
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,587
Team DrC

686
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,694
Bhagavan, is looking
What?

687
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:38,890
Bhagavan, is looking

688
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:46,868
To dear compatriots my wishes
Should have told before -l told

689
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,136
ln the ear, 'it was beat it!'

690
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,839
Change the rules, is it not what
'Aashan' (tutor) has told us

691
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,074
Has 'NeerAashan' told like that?
'Kumaranashan'

692
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,619
Because of that change
is inevitable to us

693
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,380
According to the one ortwo
planning meeting of committee

694
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:06,024
From the routine programs,
few changes have been made

695
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,389
ln that case, l've to say one thing

696
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,291
During this music program,
seating males and females apart-

697
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,333
- should be stopped

698
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,261
lnfront of God, all are equal, no?
What is that?

699
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,442
Not that, infront of God
we all are equal, no?

700
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,772
Don't we sit together like this?

701
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,410
Let it remain there, whether
equal or not before God

702
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,442
What business does some robbers
and people who elopes have here?

703
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:30,919
That's true, people who steals
coconut and Snake gourd

704
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,884
From temple premises
are well respected here

705
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,751
Come sit, or else he'll hit on the head

706
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,152
Forthe first time in the history of
festivals at 'Peruvathoor Kadavu'

707
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,762
Challenging the fire
works at 'Thrissur Pooram'

708
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,991
Don't you want to know who is
coming here with fire works?

709
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:49,398
One who created a battle ground
with fire works for Paramekkavu festival

710
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,433
'Vedikettu Velayudhan!'

711
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,175
Man, who is this
Vedikettu Velayudhan?

712
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,811
First of all you stay in the native,
then you'll know, man, who is he?

713
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,742
So, you also don't know is it?
Simply clapping hands, no?

714
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,076
'Vedikettu Velayudhan'
Great!

715
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,277
And next one is..Light and sound

716
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,791
Forthis festival,
to bring the newness

717
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:14,055
We are introducing,
illumination bulbs

718
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,226
Are these introduced
now, over here?

719
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,297
lllumination bulbs!

720
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,301
That built which flickers,
that turns on and turns off

721
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,097
There are many in Bombay

722
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,042
To give light and
sound for our festival

723
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,975
By undertaking light and sound -

724
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,014
-enters to the land
of Peruvathoor Kadavu

725
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,706
Filament Philip!

726
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,785
Here l come, move this muscle

727
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,993
Look at that smile
with that cooling glass

728
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,967
Modern guy?

729
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,511
Good hearted compatriots
of Peruvathoor Kadavu

730
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:08,449
For your information,
only two words

731
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:13,148
For the first time in the
world the bulb is invented by

732
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:17,291
Who is my tutor,
Thomas Alva Edison

733
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,858
ls he hailing from Alwaye?

734
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:24,500
Don't joke okay, is there any
problem with your eyes? -No

735
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,859
Remove that thing
All wears at Bombay

736
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,827
Simply
Bombay!

737
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,368
Dear ones, our lssac

738
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:35,271
When an apple fell on
the head, he had realisation

739
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,072
He is not that much black

740
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,272
On watching through this
he is not seen are you looking?

741
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,877
While walking, saw millions
of fireflies, that's how -

742
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,351
-he got the idea
of illumination bulbs

743
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,056
Stop it fellow!

744
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,988
He and his Edison
and illumi..Hold this

745
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,253
Your 32 teeth as if crow shit
on the survey stone marker

746
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,862
l'll hit and it'll fall on the ground

747
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,889
What brother?
Don't you like science?

748
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,068
By the way what is this all about?

749
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,330
Every year for the festival,
light and sound is done is us

750
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,442
Then all of a sudden this change,
without notice wants to know the reason

751
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,441
That is the reason why -

752
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,482
- it was humbly informed earlier,
there are some changes

753
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,412
That's it

754
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,916
That's why you changed
the agreed quotation

755
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,055
Fellow, for many years you
have been cheating natives -

756
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,087
-in the name of light and sound

757
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,250
Fellow, this time we are going to
introduce imported lights

758
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,258
Kids, you watch and
learn our illumination

759
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,362
Then what, is your illumination,
placed over there to watch?

760
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,466
What a shame!
His fuse is out!

761
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,262
Look, every year its conducted
by Palattukara compatriots

762
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,167
This time, let them
both jointly conduct it

763
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,864
For us the festival
is more important, no?

764
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,236
There is no need of
jointly conducting it

765
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,310
Then we'll do it
Okay you do it

766
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,878
Do you want to see how it is done?
Are you going to do it again?

767
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,140
You fellows stop it

768
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,219
No one asks to the cows,
where to construct a shed

769
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,854
ln Bombay its asked
Understand?

770
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,581
Because of that, this
year they will conduct it

771
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:59,486
This is my decision, does anyone
have a different opinion?

772
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,424
Anyone, l ask?

773
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,499
Fellow, hold this

774
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,172
Just return after l
fold my 'mundu' (Loin cloth)

775
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:33,157
This is a tester, don't
simply test my guts

776
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,490
Get lost, you black demon!
Me?

777
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:38,526
You don't prank at
me using my dentures

778
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,397
You don't shine more, with this
Okay take it

779
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,165
Committee people!

780
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,647
Go man!

781
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,695
Who is that man?

782
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:12,193
But still Madhavetta, with that
illuminating bulb they ridiculed us

783
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,402
ln my name Kalippeeru Jose,
being the fan of Keerikkadan Jose

784
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,539
ln the name of God, won't
allow them to remain in this land

785
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,072
Balls..Keerikadan..Should
have whacked at that time

786
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,574
But l was not there at that time
lf you were there, could have charged

787
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,542
This is the reason why
l don't attend the committee

788
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,578
Simply childish acts

789
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,410
Stupids!

790
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,609
You don't try to be smart, you are
also in that list- Did you see?

791
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,085
What is this? -Saw that flickering
Didn't you see that?

792
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:34,985
Hey Gagan, you keep
all that stuff right there

793
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,955
Should see how they
conduct by avoiding us

794
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,220
Fellow, don't create any
issue as this is a festival

795
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,559
No, won't create any issues,
hearing their verbal abuse

796
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,668
After losing the work, will cover
the head with cloth and sit here

797
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,732
Will show, l'll give a deadly task

798
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,698
Without that, there is no use in
having a mustache like this

799
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,442
Fellow, don't get too much worried,
what's your present problem?

800
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,976
They should be whacked,
that's all isn't it?

801
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,046
Will you be there with me?

802
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:03,208
Will whack, not now

803
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,316
On the tenth day of the festival,
on the day of 'Aaraattu' (Holy bath)

804
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,114
Traditional kind of whack

805
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,781
That's the routine
followed in the native

806
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,150
That's enough, okay

807
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,592
Before going for a quarrel,
l'll tell one thing to both of you

808
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,320
Don't think can release
the movie for the festival

809
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,760
Why is that? -Today those men
who came for the inspection

810
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,260
Saying the urine shed is not okay

811
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,766
Went off without giving the
fitness certificate

812
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,106
Why not stop
urinating for two hours

813
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,543
l've also tried saying
the same thing

814
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,679
They are too obstinate that
they will make to urinate!

815
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,109
Look how adamant these
panchayat people are

816
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,407
Take this
Mr. Vini Bhai

817
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:38,313
Whetherthis green should be
connected to blue wire or to plug?

818
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,787
Connect to that place of yours!
You'll get from me, okay

819
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:46,286
No need of your advise
Fellow, 'Kottayam Kunjachan' is okay

820
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,627
But to get the fitness certificate
should take one more generator on rent

821
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:53,829
For which should seek
the help of Bhagavan

822
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,598
Those pigs, had closed
the solution forthat

823
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:58,768
Still has to stand infront of
Bhagavan, isn't it?

824
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,407
l'm sure he has intentionally
done this to us

825
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,637
Madhava, l won't say
don't ask money from him

826
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,442
But Bhagavan is a cunning guy

827
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:11,745
lf not careful, he'll wipe
off the sand under the feet

828
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,282
That's true

829
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,615
But till this day-

830
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,418
- there hasn't been any disruption
in festival movie screening

831
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:21,159
Whatever it may be, for the festival
the movie should be screened

832
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,058
Will there be death?
Worry not

833
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:28,192
Once this is jointed, this year's
KSEB award is for me, buddy

834
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,405
Did you see?
Gone..

835
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,130
Gone..
3..

836
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,210
You filth, didn't l say not
to hamper with that?

837
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,745
Madhava, which is the
movie for the festival?

838
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,645
Has arranged 'Kottayam Kunjachan'

839
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,812
What is it Madhava?

840
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,182
Madhavan, needs some money, to
release a new movie forthe festival

841
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,420
Shuck! First repay the money which
is pending, then release new movie

842
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,193
Menon sir, shall repay it
after the next release

843
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,133
During the festival, there
will be good crowd

844
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,137
You have been up with
this business of fooling me-

845
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,534
- in the name of collection

846
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:07,732
When do you think, when you
can pay off the pending amount?

847
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,538
l..Will..Repay

848
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,713
Govacha- What is it?
Come near

849

851
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,893
Okay, only for this time l'll give
money but there is a condition

852
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,693
Father, did you ask water?

853
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,539
Go inside girl! Won't hear
on calling thousand times!

854
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,610
Asking, wants water, go inside l say!

855
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,948
Gives water even to foes
Keep quite, fellow

856
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,950
How is that? Will learn
from the elder sister, no?

857
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,413
That's true

858
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:00,160
Madhavan, didn't say anything
Menon sir, what's this condition?

859
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:08,666
On this 'Meenam' (march-april)
23 rd, that is on 8th day of festival

860
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:12,600
The money which you
owe to me, not fully

861
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,466
lf you can repay, 3/4 th of it

862
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,403
l'll give the money

863
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:21,506
We'll pay it
Not from his mouth

864
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,580
Madhavan, should say that

865
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,619
What? Can it be fixed?

866
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:29,291
Come on say
Menon sir, l'll give

867

This one..
Okay

874
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:59,218
Madhava, if the money doesn't
come on the mentioned day

875
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:03,958
Then there is no use of saying
Menon is Bhagavan, villain and all

876
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,554
l'll write that property and attach it

877
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,607
Will see on the festival, bye

878
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,474

Don't tilt the balance

'For the kind attention of
believers, exactly at 8 o'clock'

889
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,487
Man, isn't this our Sumathi? - Yeah

890
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,724
Why not?
My first robbery was her lunch box

891
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:25,464
As Hanuman, Vinaya Chandran
As Ravanan, Kilipperu Jose

Smile and stand

Hey man, don't show any cheap

901
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:55,896
Was it a tail?
Come on hold it Ravana

902
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,794
Removing the tail
as if removing a watch

903
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:58,956
What is this? ls it a drumstick?

904
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:09,576
Seems like this time also will get the
beating from temple premises, God!

girls ready for ritual procession

911

Lord Hanuman..
You may start

920
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,684
On touching your feet,serf is
leaving with Bhagavan's slippers

921
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,950
What a fine prayer
No one saw it

922
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,737
Sree Devi

ln between that, this father
and mother, let them go

929
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,255
Right now, this kind of meeting
is enough, if father knows this..

930
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,757
-will become a photo on the wall

931
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:40,262
Will see..l'm going to make
your father busted soon

932
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:43,572
Vinayetta, l'm leaving now, if at
all fathers comes here by chance

933
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,231
He is not going to come here now,

934
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,271
What kind of work?

01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,679
'Forthe kind attention of believers'

936
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,847
'Our Menon sir's white leather

Will end up like this, when
playing with Vinaya Hanuman

939
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,817
For Vinayettan, its always
a child's play

Where is that item?

Hey fellow, Vinayan

947
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,954
Hey fellow, Hanuman Swamy and
kiss, is it? - Won't it be matching?

948
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,118
Doesn't match, doing nonsense at
the temple premises, come here

949
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,591
Where did she kiss you?
Seems like on the cheeks

My God, with illuminating
bulb they were made busted

01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,166
My God, he came to the
house and illuminated it!

952
01:11:54,209 --> 01:12:01,843
''Hanuman, jumped on
to the wall of Ravanna''

953
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:13,226
''Hey you Ravanna, what's your
reason to abduct Seetha?''

954
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:21,931
''Did someone tell you
or did you think in your mind?''

955
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:29,769
''No one has told me, l had
such a thought in my mind''

956
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:50,096
Come, get up, come

957

01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:55,592
Not the pills, it a case
perhaps death may occur

1021
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,529
By the way Nair,
what is heard, is it true?

1022
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,501
ls it our kids? -Why not?

1023
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,432
Yesterday at the festival
ground, it was real fight

1024
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,471
Nairetta, two tea
Okay then

1025
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,370
One, strong
A scorn!

1026
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,135
Fellow, that might be
a rotten banana

1027
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,509
lts on the paper, that
you all ruined the festival

1028
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,114
lts a decayed banana, don't eat it

1029
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,774
By that time, did it
appear on the newpaper?

1030
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:18,312
Your acts are crossing the limits

1031
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:50,507
Team DrC

1032
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,656
Don't beat
Anna, run!

1033
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,664
Mr. Bhajrangan, does this
illuminating bulb turns on weekly once?

1034
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,802
Asking as we do not know

1035
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,805
Aren't you ashamed to
talk by removing the fuse?

1036
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:19,211
You all removed, not the bulb's
fuse but it was ourAnnan's fuse

1037
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,074
ls that enough Anna?
You jerk!

1038
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,822
Hey you Vinayan,
can ignore beating us

1039
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:32,484
But why did you beat this innocent
person who doesn't know anything?

1040
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,461
Without any reason
we don't beat any jerks

1041
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:41,361
He was bit show off

1042
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,832
That is the reason for beating

1043
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:47,101
Hey Filament, seems that they don't
beat anyone without any reason

1044
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,436
You take the next bus and
quit the place -That's better

1045
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,342
l won't go, without the
broken bulbs money-

1046
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:53,676
- boss won't permit
me inside the shop

1047
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,216
Not only that its not an ordinary
bulb its an illumination bulb

1048
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,580
Potha!
Annan, now really the fuse is out

1049
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,448
My dear Nairetta
This 60 vats bulbs

1050
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,617
lf it turns on and off
ten times, won't it go faulty?

1051
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,591
Won't it go faulty?
Nairetta, you say who is wise

1052
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,662
Yeah, it will go faulty

1053
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:11,892
That's it
You all did it

1054
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,565
We've got evidence on that

1055
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:17,203
Then take that evidence
let me see it

1056
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,397
Hey fellow, don't think we are all..
ls it fools?

1057
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,236
Yeah, don't think we are fools

1058
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,844
Over here other than you who
else will say 'Are Thu Chakkarr'

1059
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:31,408
See, even Nayarettan said 'Are Thu
Chakkarr' has Nayarettan done all that?

1060
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:34,381
No, l didn't
You Nair!

1061
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,547
Vinaya!
May be this guy? -Come here

1062
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,822
What is it man?
ls there any problem?

1063
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,292
Come fellow, don't stand
alone and get the beating

1064
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,728
Will deal after coming back
See, its some kind of conspiracy

1065
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,424
Where are they going to the back
side? - What is the matter?.

1066
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,832
Vinaya you are finished

1067
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,899
l have not done it all by
myself, they were all there with me-

1068
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:51,898
- to remove the fuse

1069
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,736
Most probably Bhagavan
will remove yourfuse

1070
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,434
Bhagavan, knew about the
love between you and Sree Devi

1071
01:21:58,947 --> 01:21:59,777
How did you?

1072
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,279
l heard when l was
going near Bhagavan's house

1073
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,179
He was really angry
saying he will kill him

1074
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,716
Killing only him or will he
kill others who are with him?

1075
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,390
Most probably we all will be killed
That is finalized

1076
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,617
Vinaya,by 8:30 Janatha, l'm leaving

1077
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,456
l'll send letter
You should write the reply

1078
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,295
You don't be scared

1079
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:20,490
l'll kill that dog

1080
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:22,933
Should kill
Brother in law, can l say something?

1081
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:24,301
You don't utter a word

1082
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,769
Only because of you
all this had happened

1083
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:27,808
My goodness!
What is the issue over here?

1084
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,477
Don't make natives to know this
Don't open the mouth!

1085
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,306
One daughter has
left, isn't that enough?

1086
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,942
See this walkman, she and that
operator fellow at the theater

1087
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,979
Don't make me talk

1088
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,484
The elder one left by jumping the
fence she is ready to jump the wall

1089
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,561
My God, is it true?
Look l'll tell one thing

1090
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:51,665
lf you go out, till the
festival ends, go inside l say!

1091
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:55,662
Come inside
There is no use of stopping

1092
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,328
l'll go along with Vinayettan

1093
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:04,468
l know what to do next - Look
brother in law let the festival end

1094
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,547
lf any action is taken now, like
before it'll end in bad name

1095
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:09,308
Will show you how to enter
inside a house, plan number one

1096
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,280
Hey you fellow, you rogue mole!

1097
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,319
l'll chop your head
and place it on the wall

1098
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,923
Take the bike, lets flee
The plan is dumped- Stop there!

1099
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,650
We can escape
without getting the blows

1100
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,693
Hey fellow, isn't that
walkman of mine, jerk!

1101
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:26,430
Velayudhan has come!
Vedikettu Velayudhan has come!

1102
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:32,566
Shucks!
Simply!

1103
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,343
What is the problem over there?

1104
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:42,413
Shall l take one 'Kampithiri?'
(sparkler)

1105
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,677
Shucks! Give that to your house,
has come to give 'Kampithiri'

1106
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,879
This is the problem, this
native is not at all good

1107
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:48,453
Shall l leave child?

1108
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,056
Velayudetta, fireworks
show was great

1109
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,055
Hey fellow Biju, is it possible to get?

1110
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,729
Vedikettuji, its not Biju,Bhajrangan

1111
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,626
Any possibility to get?

1112
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:05,334
That is Vedikettuji,
none of us has asked before

1113
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,805
No one is here who
smokes for a match box?

1114
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,468
Give the match box
Without match has come to fire?

1115
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,308
Hey You! -Velayudhan knows
how and where to fire!

1116
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:19,317
Fellow, who is this donkey faced?
Don't feel bad, aunty's son!

1117
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:20,679
Aunty's son!

1118
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,089
You fool, was it necessary?
Anna, my bulb and money

1119
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,493
You simply don't make
Velayudhan to take the knife

1120
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,137
Why is he making a strange voice?

1121
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:39,963
These are the people
that l told, just threaten them

1122
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:41,403
Let it be strong

1123
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,139
Friend's aunty
Where is it fellow? Let me see

1124
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:46,641
Looking
Uncle is in the army

1125
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:47,974
Poor aunty
Felow, just look there

1126
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,419
Who is this green guy?
Didn't l say l saw yesterday night?

1127
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,453
He is the guy
ls it so?

1128
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:01,920
What is this boy, is it a camera?
lts a 'Konakam' (underwear)

1129
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,163
Then take that 'konakam'
and cover the waist!

1130
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:08,127
Let me see it -By the way
have you come to see-

1131
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,462
- whether people of Peruvathoor
Kadavu wears underwear or not?

1132
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,108
Hey you fellow, just go and ask to
compatriots of Vadakkunathan

1133
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:16,603
They will tell the story how-

1134
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,644
Velayudhan became
Vedikettu Velayudhan

1135
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:22,544
Your face is beautiful but the
mustache is not that thick

1136
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,545
lf at all you go after that
girl from Vadakkumbhagam

1137
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,744
Will give a sample of firework
show, that is offered to deity!

1138
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,818
You may go now, we'll deal later

1139
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,652
What?
Go, we'll deal later

1140
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:37,161
Only afterwards it seems
Move back, fellow

1141
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:48,970
Team DrC

1142
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,534
What a fiery acting?

1143
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,804
Look at the goosebumps

1144
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,516
After Jayan, our
man is the next person

1145
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,542
Madhava, the movie
is not like before

1146
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,712
What a change the movie had?

1147
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,584
Look at the way it performs

1148
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,651
lts true regarding the
goosebumps and fire

1149
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,958
Fellow, on the eighth day of festival
if at all Bhagavan's payment is failed

1150
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:14,192
We'll be set on blaze!
Who is going to set on blaze? -Go man

1151
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:17,537
No one is going anywhere
leaving this theatre of ours

1152
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:22,233
lf it is to happen, like that
this 'Neer' should die

1153
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,206
Come on, shut up man
Madhavetta!

1154
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:30,484
Who is that man?
Tutor, got busted!

1155
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,043
Who is it?
ls it Joshy?

1156
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:36,013
Joshy?
Not Joshy, its Velayudhan

1157
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:38,555
Velayudhan? ls he a director?
Not a director and all

1158
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:39,751
Then?
Vedikettu Velayudhan

1159
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,054
lntroduced to whack him

1160
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,730
Right now had a small
scuffle at the festival ground

1161
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,661
l had warned you
at that time itself

1162
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,234
Then you wanted to pluck the
mangoes and fruit together

1163
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,797
Fruit and mangoes?
What is it?

1164
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,566
You don't make me talk more

1165
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,232
Ruined the festival, now
compatriots are making the rumours

1166
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,010
See, how he stands now?

1167
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,512
Look tutor, when ridiculed
before the compatriots

1168
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:01,912
- can l stand with
folded hands gawking? -No

1169
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,684
Fellow, you don't try
to get his support-

1170
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,547
- see that compatriots
doesn't tarnish you

1171
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,745
Since you went after
that girl, during the festival

1172
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:08,786
-created issues

1173
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,685
Now hadn't they introduced
Vedikettu and Velayudhan?

1174
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,586
So, its exposed is it?

1175
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,694
l've cautioned at
that time it'll be flashed

1176
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:16,820
My goodness..The hand!

1177
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:21,161
Neither Vedikettu or some big
miscreants come, will tremble!

1178
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,663
That's it
That's how it is

1179
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:25,735
You first go and enquire about her

1180
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,913
Why is she showing this cassette?

1181
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,614
One is locked inside the house-

1182
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,854
- now are you doing the
cassette business with three?

1183
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:46,686
Go man
l'll talk and come

1184
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:51,188
Again she is lifting, if its to talk,
why is she lifting the cassette?

1185
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,231
She has not told anything else
lts only a cassette, no?

1186
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,035
Fellow, let him go and
talk and come

1187
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:56,667
But still my Sumithra

1188
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,166
Shucks! Your Sumithra!
Nail him down, man!

1189
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,034
Go man

1190
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:01,334
Wait, we'll put the toss and see

1191
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:03,006
No need of any
toss Sumithra is mine

1192
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:04,769
Are you that Mukundhan?
Yeah

1193
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,107
Mukundhetta, Sumithra is calling

1194
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,908
Fellow, herfather shouldn't hear
When father knows, l don't care

1195
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,942
Gone?
He is coming

1196
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,816
Which is the cassette?
ls it Sukamo Devi?

1197
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:19,049
lts not that much good
but you all should remain with me

1198
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,195
You tell the matter, in
the name of 'Keerikkadan Jose'

1199
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:22,693
'Kilippeeru Jose' will do it

1200
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,225
So, tonight we'll enter
into Bhagavan's house

1201
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:28,931
l'm not there, then what?
To Bhagavan's house?

1202
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,126
Tonight?
Yeah

1203
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,763
My dear Vinayan, its not like
placing the cassette on the sill

1204
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,205
Entering into his home at night

1205
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:38,209
lf that Bhagavan comes to
know this, there will be gun shots!

1206
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:41,075
By the way when you enter into
that house at night, what'll you get?

1207
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:44,346
Fellow, other marriage
proposals have started for Sree Devi

1208
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,748
Don't know what to do

1209
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,188
She insists she wants to see me

1210
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:51,188
Some how today l must meet her

1211
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:52,791
You betrayers, who refrains!

1212
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,020
lf my Vinayan wants to
meet her Sree Devi, l'll do that

1213
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,361
No one can stop me from that if any
Bhagavan (god) or goddess intends

1214
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,192
What if goddess intends?
Possible if goddess intends

1215
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:02,869
But not possible if
Bhagavan intends

1216
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,800
Operation Bhagavan
What?

1217
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,873
ln Bombay its like this
while going for a task, do it like this

1218
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,201
Okay then
Come on hold it, say it

1219
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:17,376
Stop, stop! -What is this man?
Why did you show the hand to stop?

1220
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:18,777
Was it that one?
Then what?

1221
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:21,046
lf asked why covering the head,
say that's to be free from mist

1222
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:23,122
Come fast
What is that smell? -Come fast

1223
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:28,225
Men should have the guts, if
any obstacle comes in the front

1224
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,624
Should not get
confused, just move ahead

1225
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:32,296
My god, its a snake!

1226
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,224
You pig, scaring others to kill

1227
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:36,063
Fellow, that was a
coconut tree stump

1228
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:37,802
So, it wasn't a snake, no?
Have got real guts

1229
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,736
Simply ran
Vinaya, to where did you run?

1230
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,842
Jerk!
l ran to save you

1231
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,103
What timid people?

1232
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:47,205
Don't know how many bullets will
be there in that Bhagavan's gun?

1233
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,681
Only two bullets,
Sreekala and Sreedevi

1234
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:50,749
Talking nonsense?

1235
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,886
He did nonsense that's
why we are made to walk this

1236
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,015
Hey fellow Vinaya
What is it?

1237
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:57,921
Don't know whether its out
fear, a lump from the navel

1238
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,354
Fellow, just hold it -Yeah, it'll be
there while taking this route

1239
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:02,819
That's the room of Sreedevi

1240
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,366
Sreedevi's room!

1241
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,739
Even otherwise
you are bit humbug

1242
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:17,674
His Gorilla attack -l was just
joking, its routine in Bombay

1243
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,046
Slowly, slowly
Don't make noise

1244
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:25,844
You don'tjump
Why?

1245
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,180
You watch the surrounding

1246
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:28,116
Which means?

1247
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:30,881
No need of sack
No need?

1248
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,082
Will think we are robbers

1249
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:33,452
Here catch this, okay

1250
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:35,794
Lucky the temptation
to shit stopped

1251
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:38,961
Why no jumping?
Watch the surrounding

1252
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:45,870
Man, that's the room of Sreedevi
That's what l said before

1253
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,476
There is no use of
gawking like this, do the work

1254
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:54,142
By the way if this
house's plan was known

1255
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:55,975
Then first we'll go to the
house of mason Chandran

1256
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,108
For what?
You wanted to know the plan, no?

1257
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,479
Fellow, find out the way to get in
Don't know whiich is that way?

1258
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:05,123
As per the operation
its not left, must be right

1259
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:09,087
Where did he go?
Vinaya, Vinaya!

1260
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:10,355
Hey fellow Vinaya!

1261
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:13,829
What should Vinayan do now?
What is it man?

1262
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,400
Am l not the one who
had this plan? -l'm the leader

1263
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:16,231
So, what?

1264
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,962
l go first
You come behind

1265
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,133
Cat?
Always walk behind the leader

1266
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:23,536
Slowly, don't run from the back

1267
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,208
What a bold leader!
lts completely dark

1268
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:30,010
As per the Gorila operation each
step should be taken carefully

1269
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,478
Shucks!
What happened? -Shit

1270
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,082
No problem on carrying it
On seeing only its a problem

1271
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:36,281
lf its like this, l'm going to Bombay

1272
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,016
Say it fully
l'll teach how is planning, operation

1273
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,058
Operation, planning

1274
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,460
Don't be so scared

1275
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,533
Hell with it, there was a ladder here
How do you know that?

1276
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,968
Any house will have
a ladder at the back side

1277
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:57,299
By the way, don't question
the leader much, you got it?

1278
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,011
A fellow to ask questions?

1279
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,273
What are you looking at?
Come here

1280
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,146
No, l..- There aren't seen
on going to back side

1281
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:06,947
Why not wejump?
For what?

1282
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:09,380
Can see the room
Whose room? -Sree Devi's

1283
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:11,353
Go, man.. You!
Watch the surrounding

1284
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,558
Vinayanji! -What?
This ladder will change your life

1285
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,233
Lucky if it doesn't create an issue

1286
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,065
Confidence!

1287
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:26,335
There is a thing like that
Wait, wait

1288
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:28,339
Don't be in haste,
let the leader climb

1289
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:31,536
All this should be checked
1 , 2,3

1290
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:35,371
Oops! Vinaya, take that purse
Will think its robbers

1291
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,082
Here

1292
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:50,764
Team DrC

1293
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:54,261
What is this man?
What? -Get down

1294
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,026
She is at the top, no?
You come to the top

1295
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,262
She is on top..You! - Don't pull,
if Bhagavan comes to know

1296
01:32:58,472 --> 01:32:59,598
Operation will be ruined

1297
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,432
You monkey! Girl who eloped
along with a helper in a bus

1298
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,307
How is she in your purse, smiling
and standing along with you?

1299
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,241
Tell the truth
Listen to what l'm saying

1300
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,144
You don't have to say anything
So, l shouldn't talk

1301
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,443
Told you to say, if you
don't say the truth

1302
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:12,178
lf l show this photo to Bhagavan,
don't you know your situation?

1303
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,651
Happened

1304
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:17,113
Long back when l came here
to steal, was the treasure l got

1305
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,859
My Sree Kala
Your Sree Kala?

1306
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:23,121
Then what about that helper
in the bus? -He isn't a helper

1307
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:25,629
Then?
He was the Swan

1308
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:28,197
l didn't understand anything
lts a flashback

1309
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,065
'Hamsam' (swan)

1310
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:41,337
Hold this
Shall l give? -Go fellow!

1311
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:47,313
What is it?
Give that 'Beedi'

1312
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,166
Can l give?

1313
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:05,502
Smiled!

1314
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,453
We'll go tomorrow?
Tomorrow, when?

1315
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:26,993
Will go at night, then when
coming, bangle, chain of gold

1316
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:29,653
Take 'Aranjaanam'
(waist chain) and all

1317
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,698
On reaching there,
should eat food, no?

1318
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:37,434
Look, l have a fear what to do
if father comes with the gun?

1319
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:39,698
l'll run -What?
No, if he comes with gun will fight

1320
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:42,166
Really?
This girl is..Place it here

1321
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:43,669
True

1322
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,478
Neither its Bhagavan,
even if goddess intends

1323
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:49,082
Gagan won't leave this Sree Kala

1324
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:58,182
Come fast

1325
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:02,354
Fast
Come fast

1326
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:28,118
Stop it fellow, how
did Neer come in this scene?

1327
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:31,088
Not only this scene, this
story is written by tutor Neer

1328
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:35,494
Even tutor Neer hid this, as
he was seen as own father

1329
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,327
You and her is the
reason for everything

1330
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,590
Vinaya, not her, sister in law

1331
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:44,269
l'll just poke you hey
fellow have you seen Bombay?

1332
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:47,236
l haven't seen it?
Then where is this Hindi from?

1333
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:50,003
l'm staying on top of a
tutorial college in the town

1334
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:52,372
That is how this Hindi
You and your underworld

1335
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:54,107
You jerk because of you only-

1336
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:56,115
-Such a rift has occurred among
the people on shores

1337
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,446
l can't even meet Sree Devi
do you know?- Shouldn't know

1338
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,453
What? -Bhagavan
shouldn't know at any cost

1339
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,785
We should stand
jointly, we are one family

1340
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,652
lf you again utter in
Hindi, l'll whack you to pulp

1341
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,196
No need of Hindi,
for you to get Sree Devi

1342
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,399
For me to come to
native along with Sree Kala

1343
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,558
There are only two means
What is that?

1344
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:18,171
One is, snatch that
gun orfinish off Bhagavan

1345
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:20,204
Even if god intends, none
of the two things will take place

1346
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,775
Will take place first do
that work, for what we've come

1347
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:25,576
Buddy you climb

1348
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,178
What? -Now we have become
brother in laws, isn't it?

1349
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:29,349
Brother in law

1350
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:31,351
So you climb

1351
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:33,811
Pray to Bhagavan (god) in the mind

1352
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:36,246
You may climb
Wait, wait -What?

1353
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:38,154
For the route, let
there be a weapon in hand

1354
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:40,385
This one? ln Bombay it
must be like this, no?

1355
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:42,428
You jerk, again if you utter Bombay

1356
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,662
Bom..!
lf you say Bombay l'll beat and..!

1357
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,203
There was a mango tree here
lts not getting finished

1358
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:53,067
Did he chop it?- ls the ladder
becoming lengthier on climbing?

1359
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:55,170
Yeah, there it is
My God

1360
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:05,480
Did you see?

1361
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:09,847
Reading book

1362
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:11,449

1363
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:18,661

1364
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,801
Father and mother not slept yet
My goodness, hey fellow

01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:25,328
You want mango?

1366
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,868
So you are not alone, are you?
Nope

1367
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,234
All have come

1368
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:34,840
l thought without seeing
me you must be crying

1369
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:38,513
By listening to music, reading
books and sitting happily, no?

1370
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:41,821
Get lost, father is in
pursuit of finding other alliances

1371
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:46,819
Girl, this is the obstacle of all lovers,
such kind of alliances by father in law

1372
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,924
Nambeeshan, read father's palmistry

1373
01:37:50,264 --> 01:37:53,722
Life line is long good marriage for
daughter, things like that, no?

1374
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,398
No, said father will kill someone

1375
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:00,231
ls it to say this joke,
you told wanted to see me?

1376
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:01,772
No, l'll come now

1377
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:06,879
lts to give something

1378
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,946
Fellow?
Do you want? -No

1379
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:16,186
She is going to give something
more sweeterthan that

1380
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:17,517
lts really bitter

1381
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:23,589
Vinayetta, give this to Madhavettan

1382
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:35,206
What is this? -Sree Devi
theater should be always there

1383
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:38,745
At any cost we will
not leave the theatre

1384
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:41,938
Let it remain here itself
Wheather big or small

1385
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:43,943
That's for ourtheatre no?

1386
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:46,210
Should give this to Madhavettan

1387
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,945
No, that is..
Vinayetta, its not a joke

1388
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:53,486
Father is very serious on that for
the past two days, he is for it

1389
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:57,225
Without going out to conduct
festival, father is sitting here

1390
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:00,496
lmmediately when the festival
ends, plans to conduct marriage

1391
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:05,835
Vinayettan, why
aren't you saying anything?

1392
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:10,270
Like how sister left, why don't
we go some where from here?

1393
01:39:10,644 --> 01:39:11,668
To elope?

1394
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:18,981
Take off this hand, and then that
bullet will pierce my heart!

1395
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:23,983
Good
Fellow, saying will elope

1396
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,359
Same blood, no?
Will only say like that

1397
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:29,987
An eloping blood!
She'll also elope!

1398
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:34,730
Did you get upset with that?

1399
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,670
l was justjoking, no?
No need to talk to me

1400
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,338
Fellow, she became upset
What a pity

1401
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:45,376
Come on sing a song
ln Bombay, no, you sing

1402
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:46,774
ln the movies its like this

1403
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:47,938
So, l'll sing, no?

1404
01:39:55,255 --> 01:40:14,802
Team DrC

1405
01:40:15,943 --> 01:40:23,281
''With the eyes, how did the limbs
shake and fell, due to your sly look''

1406
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:31,524
''With the eyes, how did the limbs
shake and fell, due to your sly look''

1407
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:34,692
''You slowly..''
Stop it

1408
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:40,765
What is the intention?

1409
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:46,664
lts music
Music? Parents not yet slept

1410
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:52,740
No problem with that, we'll
go the field ridges and dance

1411
01:40:54,848 --> 01:41:01,515
''You caressed me very
slowly with your eyes''

1412
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:10,461
''Today the cloud that lingered in my
heart has disappeared, beloved''

1413
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:30,906
''Trees adorned with flowers
moved in the breeze stood smiling''

1414
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:34,612
''On the paths you stroll,
the flowers have blossomed''

1415
01:41:34,822 --> 01:41:38,622
''The whole heart is filled with
rainbow, that came winking the eyes''

1416
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:42,592
''On the paths you stroll,
stood as a guard''

1417
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:50,669
''You caressed me very
slowly with your eyes''

1418
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:59,006
''Today the cloud that lingered in my
heart has disappeared, beloved''

1419
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:34,540
''Cuckoo bird came
flying,sat attentively''

1420
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:38,515
''On the paths you stroll,
they fly with the song''

1421
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,655
''lxora,China Rose,Lotus,Jasmine ''

1422
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:46,715
''On the paths you stroll,
waited with a basin''

1423
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:54,665
''You caressed me very
slowly with your eyes''

1424
01:42:54,801 --> 01:43:02,833
''Today the cloud that lingered in
my heart has disappeared, beloved''

1425
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:13,880
''With the eyes, how did
the limbs shake and fell..''

1426
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:40,641
Who is there?
Seems like father woke up

1427
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,007
Vinayetta, you go, go
My god

1428
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:43,614
My god

1429
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:45,583
By the way,,That is..

1430
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,680
So, all the girls are like this no?

1431
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,088
Who is that fellow?
Asking who is that?

1432
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:54,954
lts Bhajrangan!
Fellow get down and run!

1433
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:57,195
Why is this jerk saying our names?

1434
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:58,093
Jump!

1435
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,037
Hey you!

1436
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:09,868
You? - Has told to repair
the latch of the window

1437
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:13,145
Thought not to disturb
the child, while sleeping

1438
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:17,843
(You jerk!)

1439
01:44:18,685 --> 01:44:21,176
Buddy..!
Saw? Can you see anything?

1440
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:22,322
Does Bhagavan have
gun in his hands?

1441
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:24,955
Looks like it may stink!
No change in the situation

1442
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:28,618
Hey fellow, look tutor
Neer and Madhavettan

1443
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:30,192
Put your head down
l didn't see

1444
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:33,697
Well known people in the
native, both of you are here

1445
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:36,530
Why Neer don't you
have any job today?

1446
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:39,002
Today's job is over here, Menon sir

1447
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:41,770
What did you do to our boy?

1448
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:45,111
Has come to talk
in favour of him, is it?

1449
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:47,609
Menon sir, it is not correct to say

1450
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:50,779
But still can you pardon
for one last time? -Shucks!

1451
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:52,111
Wants to pardon!

1452
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:53,341
Bring him!

1453
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:05,257
There is no change in such
activities of compatriots

1454
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:08,297
Even in Bombay its like this
Stop it man

1455
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:10,763
He and his Bombay

1456
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,343
Hey man!

1457
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:21,010
Okay lift him

1458
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,015
'Valleem Thetti Pulleem Thetti!'
(Really goofed up)

1459
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,116
Along with him, there are
some other rabble-rousers too

1460
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:33,851
They are also in my list

1461
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:35,888
lts you guys!
You jerk, sit!

1462
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:38,789
Hey man Madhava,
aren't you ashamed?

1463
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:41,934
After cooly collecting the money
and when you can't repay it

1464
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,934
Sending some boys for robbery,
that's not what should be done

1465
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:48,301
l've caught him red handed
He should be sent to jail

1466
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:49,631
No, l..
Stop it man!

1467
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,207
Started for a long time

1468
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:55,173
Menon ..Before thinking all this

1469
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:58,409
Just remember one thing when
sun rises and reaches to center

1470
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,379
lt is the tongue of compatriots
of Peruvathoor Kadavu

1471
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:02,382
Don't make compatriots
to say this and that

1472
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:06,887
Now that's it, while misbehaving
at the festival ground

1473
01:46:07,094 --> 01:46:07,617
He was left free

1474
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:10,229
He'll be set free,only after
making a decision on this today

1475
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,421
Then that should be seen
Will see

1476
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:17,394
Govacha! Set him free
No that brother in law

1477
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:18,796
Do what l say

1478
01:46:19,072 --> 01:46:22,235
Fellow free him
That's betterfor both

1479
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:29,443
Fellows, move back, move
Okay unfasten!

1480
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:32,380
Fellow, get down here
Come

1481
01:46:33,019 --> 01:46:36,318
Hey boy, if you buddy up
with these kind of 'tree climbers'

1482
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:38,447
And wish to peep into here

1483
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,383
Will finish all!

1484
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:42,861
As soon as festival ends,
its Sree Devi's marriage

1485
01:46:42,996 --> 01:46:45,794
None should be seen here
in this vicinity before that

1486
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:50,059
Menon! lf at all she is
ready to come out with him

1487
01:46:50,303 --> 01:46:53,101
On this land of Peruvathoor
Kadavu they will live together

1488
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:56,103
Come on fellow, Vinayan
Challenge is good

1489
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:59,107
That is regarding the kids
But Madhava..

1490
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:02,980
Don't forget about our deal, on
the eighth day of festival

1491
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,378
There isn't much days

1492
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:15,224
Come
You come

1493
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:30,035
Team DrC

1494
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:32,979
My fate what else to say?

1495
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,115
Without any help, nurtured
both of them so far

1496
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:39,952
There is no one left to know this,
even after becoming matured

1497
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:43,351
He didn't think of two human
being living in this house

1498
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:47,160
How is that? He won't go for any
decent jobs also, when saying to go

1499
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,852
Ruin the life with movie and songs

1500
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:53,497
lf you had any kind of re-thinking,
will you do such a misbehaviour?

1501
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:56,826
You didn't even think
there is a child younger to you

1502
01:47:57,103 --> 01:48:00,368
How is that? You gluttonous person!
These acts are such aftermath!

1503
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:03,772
Vinaya what do you think of
yourself?. Are you some big officer?

1504
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:06,205
With ten cents of land and
with a job in a theatre-

1505
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:08,381
-aren't you ashamed?
So what mother?

1506
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:10,982
Have received a wonderful
daughter in law, isn't it?

1507
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:13,209
You go inside before
you get slaps from me

1508
01:48:13,386 --> 01:48:16,514
One advisor has come
My dear mother can you stop it?

1509
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:19,825
This is a big nuisance
Simply making people..

1510
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:22,028
Right now l've become
your nuisance isn't it?

1511
01:48:22,295 --> 01:48:24,354
You do what you like

1512
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:36,368
Not that tutor Neer, long back
when you eloped with Vanaja chechi

1513
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:39,135
Weren't you scared?
Hey boy Vinaya!

1514
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,914
While climbing high on each trees

1515
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:45,947
There will be a tremble within

1516
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:49,553
But on reaching on top, will
howl with excitement

1517
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:53,549
Hey boy once Peruvathoor
Kadavu and our mind is with us

1518
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:55,861
Then boy, why do you fear?

1519
01:48:56,062 --> 01:48:59,998
At that time, l had
Madhavan, now you've both of us

1520
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:03,334
Remain bold boy
Hey fellow

1521
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:08,337
For all the young men in life
a situation will emerge to take up a-

1522
01:49:08,441 --> 01:49:09,908
-win or die decision

1523
01:49:10,443 --> 01:49:13,378
Mostly that will be for
the girl, who is loved

1524
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,442
lsn't it man?
Why not?

1525
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,558
What, bedi? Take it, including
this, it is the seventh one, okay

1526
01:49:29,596 --> 01:49:32,429
Chop it well and bring it
Put it down

1527
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,094
lncrease the flame

1528
01:49:35,936 --> 01:49:37,995
Son, you go water
will fall on your face

1529
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:45,973
Shucks!
What a smoke it is

1530
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:48,611
Madhava, come man
Do you want to stir it?

1531
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:56,617
Girl, is it over?

1532
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:00,416
Do it fast overthere
about to begin

1533
01:50:04,497 --> 01:50:06,522
Vinaya..!
Look those guys

1534
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,298
With one slap he is finished
That's all Anna

1535
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:11,666
We can do this
Fellow, now can finish him

1536
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:15,106
Wait, wait
Stop there

1537
01:50:15,342 --> 01:50:17,970
Hey Vinaya, heard you
got very well yesterday

1538
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:19,406
Aren't you happy?

1539
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,273
How many times have l told you

1540
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:24,644
Not to play too much at
Vadakkumbhagam

1541
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:27,111
Did you understand what Annan
has told? -No didn't understand

1542
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:28,912
Anna, says didn't understand

1543
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:30,486
Then l'll make you understand
Okay, fellow make me understand

1544
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:32,319
ls Vadakkumbhagam received
to yourfather as dowry?

1545
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:33,517
Said you will do this and that
Get lost man -What man?

1546
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:35,183
At night trespasses to girl's house

1547
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:36,226
Call him and go, fellow
Go, without getting blows

1548
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:38,159
Take this and leave!
Go man! Simply dialogues

1549
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:39,627
You come
Will show you, later

1550
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:41,228
Go!
His grandmother's..

1551
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:42,891
Anna, don't leave me alone and go

1552
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:46,100
Yesterday Vinayan was
caught from Sree Devi's room

1553
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:47,500
ls it so?
Didn't you know? - No

1554
01:50:47,607 --> 01:50:49,336
What was heard over there was
the bickering regarding that issue

1555
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:50,908
My god, then what?

1556
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:53,475
Heard that Bhagavan
really whacked him

1557
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:57,346
Look, how dare boy is
He has targeted a fortune

1558
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:02,553
He is coming
Vinaya, you are not bad

1559
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:05,183
Will we get a feast
in the near future?

1560
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,354
Will happen,
playing with Bhagavan?

1561
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:16,362
But still how dare that girl is, at
night to lodge a guy at home

1562
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:29,508
Team DrC

1563
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:38,754
''Didn't the flower murmur in
the ear, shall go to a distance?''

1564
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:48,329
''Didn't the flower murmur in
the ear, shall go to a distance?''

1565
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:52,263
Did you see that?

1566
01:51:56,743 --> 01:51:57,607
What man?

1567
01:52:03,183 --> 01:52:05,276
There is love even in
the salt of the sweat

1568
01:52:06,086 --> 01:52:08,281
Money, prestige
everything was a problem

1569
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:12,116
But with courage l was
called, takes care of me so well

1570
01:52:12,358 --> 01:52:15,725
Apart from everything
else, if she loves you-

1571
01:52:16,129 --> 01:52:18,029
- you should be able
to return it to her

1572
01:52:18,164 --> 01:52:21,463
A females courage and
strength is indeed a male

1573
01:52:23,036 --> 01:52:25,800
Do you have the courage
to call and bring her out?

1574
01:52:28,641 --> 01:52:37,674
''Girl, shall go to a distance''

1575
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:47,625
''On this chariot of night''

1576
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:57,464
''Girl, shall go to a distance''

1577
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:07,612
''On this chariot of night''

1578
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:32,830
''l became like a sun
that fades at a distance''

1579
01:53:33,206 --> 01:53:38,109
''At a distance you
became alone during the dusk''

1580
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:41,702
''Moves on..''

1581
01:53:58,898 --> 01:54:02,425
Fellow, so you have taken
the decision, haven't you?

1582
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:05,898
Have send the
letter with that Sumithra

1583
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,635
Hey you Ravana!

1584
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:14,739
''Hanuman, jumped on
to the wall of Bhagavan''

1585
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:18,406
''Hey you Ravanna, what's your
reason to abduct Seetha?''

1586
01:54:19,552 --> 01:54:23,318
Look your decision is
right, see how it rains

1587
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,717
Yeah, let it rain

1588
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:27,493
Madhavetta, should
fix a wiperforthis

1589
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:29,588
Forthat also, should l
ask money to Bhagavan?

1590
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:39,728
Why there is
crowd and this running?

1591
01:54:48,748 --> 01:54:51,182
'Neer has fallen'

1592
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,548
Hey, man!

1593
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,197
My Christ!

1594
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:42,600
Father!

1595
01:55:46,873 --> 01:56:12,723
Team DrC

1596
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:24,300
''The sky is cloudy, mind
is cloudy rains with thunder''

1597
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:31,774
Boy, when climbing on each tree

1598
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:33,976
There will be a tremble within

1599
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:37,947
But on reaching at the
top will howl with excitement

1600
01:57:39,452 --> 01:57:41,920
Boy as long as Peruvathoor
Kadavu and our mind is with us

1601
01:57:42,455 --> 01:57:43,979
Then why do you have fear?

1602
01:58:04,977 --> 01:58:08,435
He has defeated the
height that he couldn't

1603
01:58:14,153 --> 01:58:16,815
Hey man!
Vinayaa..!

1604
01:58:21,828 --> 01:58:23,693
What man?
What happened?

1605
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:25,124
Vinaya!
Gone!

1606
01:58:25,465 --> 01:58:27,057
The money which was there in
our theatre is completely gone

1607
01:58:28,067 --> 01:58:29,432
What are you saying?

1608
01:58:29,836 --> 01:58:31,599
l saw it when l
came to open the office

1609
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:34,996
What is to be repaid to Bhagavan
and collection of festival movie

1610
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:36,505
Man, everything is gone

1611
01:58:39,011 --> 01:58:39,875
Come

1612
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:55,186
This is done by someone who is
familiar -To do such a thing, here

1613
01:58:55,528 --> 01:58:56,620
That can be done by a
person who is familiar

1614
01:58:56,762 --> 01:58:58,992
Madhavan Nair, write a
complaint and come to the station

1615
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,760
Sir, some how you should
find this money of mine

1616
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:04,493
lf this talkies is not
there, l'm not there

1617
01:59:04,637 --> 01:59:06,969
You don't get worried, we'll find it

1618
01:59:07,106 --> 01:59:10,405
Sir,robbery had taken place in
near by two or three houses

1619
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:12,544
Also in my shop

1620
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:14,577
Snatched this Sugunan's
chain and ran

1621
01:59:14,747 --> 01:59:17,648
Why no one has complained,
after so much of issues?

1622
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:20,184
Sir, its a routine when the
festival begins over here

1623
01:59:20,553 --> 01:59:22,020
Anyway let us enquire

1624
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:25,054
To enquire this one, there was no
need for sirs to come all this way

1625
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:26,550
The thief is here itself

1626
01:59:26,759 --> 01:59:28,852
What are you coming to say?
My dear sirs

1627
01:59:29,028 --> 01:59:31,826
There is a hard core thief over here
which is well known to natives

1628
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:33,020
ln their gang

1629
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:35,757
Where is he, fellow
One who came from Bombay

1630
01:59:35,902 --> 01:59:37,870
Did you see when he got a
chance, fled with the money

1631
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:40,571
Talking nonsense - Doing nonsense
and fleeing from native

1632
01:59:40,706 --> 01:59:42,571
There is no problem in that
First nab that Gagan

1633
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:44,073
And then ask him, then will know

1634
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,205
Come on fellows, in stead
of straining the leg

1635
01:59:46,546 --> 01:59:48,810
All are thieves
Come to the station, we'll be there

1636
01:59:49,549 --> 01:59:50,516
Sugunan come

1637
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:56,212
This is a play by
someone from outside

1638
01:59:56,522 --> 01:59:58,683
Who among outsiders?
Many have come for festival

1639
01:59:59,425 --> 02:00:13,567
Team DrC

1640
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:20,079
Earlier l've done lot of fraud, later
came to know that's not what life is

1641
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:23,276
And on knowing the
tutor who taught that

1642
02:00:23,616 --> 02:00:25,516
- tutor Neer on
knowing he is no more

1643
02:00:26,953 --> 02:00:28,511
Man, l didn't feel like staying here

1644
02:00:29,855 --> 02:00:31,152
Man, our life is like that

1645
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:35,585
Don't know what will
happen to whom

1646
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:40,723
Once if a mistake is made, it'll keep
on happening again and again

1647
02:00:42,768 --> 02:00:43,757
Madhavettan!

1648
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:49,200
Poor person has not
come out from that talkies

1649
02:00:50,209 --> 02:00:53,906
All together with tutor
Neer and also with talkies

1650
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,142
He is deeply sad

1651
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:02,176
As we are all
present, couldn't do anything

1652
02:01:13,065 --> 02:01:14,327
Sree Devi Talkies

1653
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:17,168
What a shrewd brian
of brother in law's?

1654
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:22,129
Didn't l say Govacha?
That property after some time

1655
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:24,073
That will come to us

1656
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:26,107
That is true brother in law,
even after giving grace period

1657
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:28,612
Doesn't think Madhavan
can repay that debt

1658
02:01:28,981 --> 02:01:30,949
Anyway you arrange
the people for work

1659
02:01:31,717 --> 02:01:34,151
Tomorrow when sun rises
at Peruvathoor Kadavu

1660
02:01:34,687 --> 02:01:35,881
That talkies shouldn't be there

1661
02:02:55,935 --> 02:02:58,267
Madhava, l'm taking this

1662
02:02:58,671 --> 02:03:01,196
No one will enter inside here
All of you draw in

1663
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:03,274
No one should enter
inside the talkies

1664
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:05,904
As you decide nothing
will happen here-

1665
02:03:06,078 --> 02:03:07,909
- no matter if it is any
Menon or Bhagavan

1666
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,945
We'll repay the money
which is to be paid to you

1667
02:03:10,182 --> 02:03:13,151
Hey you little
boy, how can you pay?

1668
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:17,420
Doesn't even have a job to
say go and get one first of all

1669
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:19,314
Then get angry
Madhava..

1670
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:21,392
This is not a small sum

1671
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:25,390
Menon sir, this theatre was started
by my father, when l was young

1672
02:03:26,198 --> 02:03:29,292
When l got this, it had
lot of liabilities

1673
02:03:30,102 --> 02:03:32,866
Because of that had to
take lot of borrowings from sir

1674
02:03:33,038 --> 02:03:36,064
Sir, you may confiscate this
land whatever you want

1675
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:38,938
At least give me
the permission to run this

1676
02:03:39,111 --> 02:03:41,978
Hey man Madhava, l've
not come to know your history

1677
02:03:42,148 --> 02:03:44,139
l don't intend to be a
saint by showing-

1678
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,945
- movie to natives of
Peruvathu Kadavu

1679
02:03:46,152 --> 02:03:48,712
Then what do you
think, you can earn from this?

1680
02:03:49,321 --> 02:03:51,789
To earn something from
that thing, where there is film

1681
02:03:51,957 --> 02:03:54,289
lts a rust, made in 1960

1682
02:03:54,794 --> 02:03:57,228
Madhava, no need of any
case and things like that

1683
02:03:57,329 --> 02:03:59,297
That is good for both of us

1684
02:04:00,199 --> 02:04:03,100
This is a stamp paper which
you have signed and given

1685
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:05,463
On this l've written
and attached this

1686
02:04:06,205 --> 02:04:09,902
Hey you!
Move back -Vinaya!

1687
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:14,272
Let them take it

1688
02:04:16,148 --> 02:04:17,809
Don'tjust stand
watching go and demolish

1689
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:55,877
''Shadow, as you part very slowly''

1690
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:07,824
''Time flees as rage at the front''

1691
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:13,430
lts an untimely rain
will be very severe

1692
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:16,258
From now on at Peruvathu
Kadavu, there is no movie

1693
02:06:17,369 --> 02:06:20,532
Certain bad times, what else to say?

1694
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:54,964
''Snake Lords who dwells
in the temples within enclosure''

1695
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:03,339
Madhavetta, as we all are
here, how can you go?

1696
02:07:04,049 --> 02:07:09,612
Should go man, if l stay
here again its a mental agony

1697
02:07:10,155 --> 02:07:12,521
Without the presence
of Neer and talkies

1698
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:14,420
l can't stay in this
Peruvathu Kadavu

1699
02:07:15,094 --> 02:07:18,086
Now again in this age
l don't wish to acquire anything

1700
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:22,397
Who has told to acquire, why
can't we try one more time?

1701
02:07:22,635 --> 02:07:24,466
We are all there, with
you aren't we?

1702
02:07:26,038 --> 02:07:28,404
Wishes and dreams are
there only in movies

1703
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:31,966
Those who went
after it, the result was only pain

1704
02:07:40,552 --> 02:07:43,919
Right now, l've only
this to give it to you

1705
02:07:46,692 --> 02:07:50,458
When you call and bring Sree
Devi out, having a vehicle is a pride

1706
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:07,711
Hey boy, keep it
Come on accept it

1707
02:08:09,048 --> 02:08:11,710
With this you should
find a means to live

1708
02:08:17,222 --> 02:08:19,656
So you may go
where ever you want

1709
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:24,587
l also don't want to see people
who have decided to be alone

1710
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:29,959
Hey Vinayan! -Peruvathu
Kadavu yes get down

1711
02:09:10,242 --> 02:09:11,607
Today is tenth day of festival

1712
02:09:12,211 --> 02:09:15,146
To add the spirit and
color of tenth day of festival

1713
02:09:15,314 --> 02:09:18,147
Vedikettu Velayudhan's
fireworks show will commence-

1714
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:21,251
-shortly at the festival ground

1715
02:09:21,487 --> 02:09:23,819
For the kind attention of believers,
for lighting lamps, kindly follow-

1716
02:09:24,156 --> 02:09:26,021
- a queue at the 'Aarattu
Kadavu'(Holy bathing ghat)

1717
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,682
Only few more minutes to go
to commence the fireworks-

1718
02:09:28,794 --> 02:09:30,625
-show of Velayudhan,
which you have been waiting

1719
02:09:30,829 --> 02:09:32,820
Leave the rope
Man, hand off from the rope

1720
02:09:49,148 --> 02:10:01,652
Team DrC

1721
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:30,515
God, this is the last chance
Please protect

1722
02:10:52,244 --> 02:10:53,905
By the way that Gagan might
have started from there, might he?

1723
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:55,678
Has told he will
wait with Raju Mon-

1724
02:10:55,747 --> 02:10:56,736
- and Dasan at Aaranthikuzhi

1725
02:10:56,915 --> 02:10:58,246
He might have started, no?

1726
02:10:58,483 --> 02:11:00,314
By the way did you
give the letterto her?

1727
02:11:01,353 --> 02:11:04,880
Might have given, no?
Not that will her father get it? -No

1728
02:11:05,224 --> 02:11:08,216
Then, by the way will Sumithra?
Will you shut up?

1729
02:11:08,393 --> 02:11:09,621
Getting tensed here
at that time, he is..

1730
02:11:09,761 --> 02:11:11,786
Will Sumithra give..?
Understood, keep quite

1731
02:11:24,877 --> 02:11:26,208
When this 'Ettadi Moorkhan'
(King Cobra) bites-

1732
02:11:26,411 --> 02:11:28,436
- its said won't take eight steps
Buddy Sree Devi! Hey you pig!

1733
02:11:30,949 --> 02:11:31,916
Buddy!

1734
02:11:48,267 --> 02:11:50,428
All though doesn't posses
the money and pride of 'Cheruvali'

1735
02:11:50,636 --> 02:11:53,161
Has got the the courage
to take care of lover girl

1736
02:11:53,972 --> 02:11:56,600
Do you have the money to
take care of me, inside this?

1737
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:58,833
Even now are you joking?
Come

1738
02:12:06,385 --> 02:12:08,319
Now its the time, when people
come out after 'Aarattu' (Holy bath)

1739
02:12:08,487 --> 02:12:11,285
Those guys aren't seen yet,
that Gagan is also not seen

1740
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:12,423
Shucks!

1741
02:12:44,056 --> 02:12:45,421
Let me in, let me in!

1742
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:48,456
Govacha!

1743
02:12:50,362 --> 02:12:53,331
My God!
Brother in law!

1744
02:13:00,305 --> 02:13:02,773
Come on guys!
Come fellows!

1745
02:13:02,874 --> 02:13:04,364
Enough of fireworks!

1746
02:13:25,864 --> 02:13:28,389
Who is that?
A thief!

1747
02:13:28,633 --> 02:13:30,931
A thief!
What is it Nayaretta?- Suguna!

1748
02:13:31,103 --> 02:13:32,627
He is a thief, don't leave him

1749
02:13:32,771 --> 02:13:33,965
Hey you!
Suguna! -Hey you stop there!

1750
02:13:34,106 --> 02:13:35,869
Catch him, don't leave!
Hey you!

1751
02:13:38,543 --> 02:13:39,407
Hey you!

1752
02:13:40,579 --> 02:13:41,739
Hey you thief!

1753
02:13:44,583 --> 02:13:45,607
Hey you?

1754
02:13:45,784 --> 02:13:47,445
So it was you, no?
Get lost you!

1755
02:13:48,987 --> 02:13:52,616
Hey you, stop there - He is the one
who cheated all the compatriots!

1756
02:13:52,791 --> 02:13:54,088
Don't spare him!

1757
02:13:55,427 --> 02:13:59,659
Telling you to stop - You cheated
that poor Madhavettan

1758
02:13:59,798 --> 02:14:01,095
Hey you, stop there
Stop there

1759
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:03,897
Where?
Come on Potha, catch!

1760
02:14:04,736 --> 02:14:05,964
Hey you stop there

1761
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,634
Catch him!

1762
02:14:09,975 --> 02:14:11,909
Fellows, catch him!
Stop!

1763
02:14:23,955 --> 02:14:25,479
Suguna, get down and catch!

1764
02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:28,090
Hey you!
Hey you stop there!

1765
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,492
Telling you to stop!

1766
02:14:38,637 --> 02:14:42,698
Hey you, you are finished!
Stop there, you!

1767
02:14:42,941 --> 02:14:44,135
Hey you fellow, Vinaya!

1768
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:51,980
Hey you, stop!
Hey you!

1769
02:14:53,718 --> 02:14:55,117
Come fast!

1770
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,684
Anna, don't spare them!

1771
02:15:04,496 --> 02:15:06,623
Potha, surround!
Come on catch!

1772
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:12,634
Potha!

1773
02:15:32,424 --> 02:15:33,118
My god!

1774
02:15:33,525 --> 02:15:34,423
Catch him!
Sree Devi! Come!

1775
02:15:34,626 --> 02:15:36,150
Catch him!
Hey you fellow, Potha!

1776
02:15:36,962 --> 02:15:38,486
Anna, l got him!

1777
02:15:39,831 --> 02:15:41,196
Where are you going?
Leave!

1778
02:15:46,605 --> 02:15:47,663
Hey you!

1779
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:16,695
Fellow, stay still!
Hey you!

1780
02:16:17,068 --> 02:16:19,093
You are finished!
After cheating compatriots?

1781
02:16:19,237 --> 02:16:21,228
Trying to flee?

1782
02:16:23,008 --> 02:16:25,670
Vinaya, they are behind us
To go this way

1783
02:16:25,844 --> 02:16:27,573
There will be Raju Mon
and Dasan at 'Aaranthikuzhi'

1784
02:16:27,779 --> 02:16:28,973
We'll handle these men

1785
02:16:29,114 --> 02:16:30,240
You go
Go l say!

1786
02:16:30,715 --> 02:16:31,443
Go!

1787
02:16:31,616 --> 02:16:32,207
Come!

1788
02:16:43,595 --> 02:16:45,460
Fellows, over there
Catch them!

1789
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:47,689
Look, those guys!
Come man, l say come!

1790
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:50,734
Catch!
Don't leave!

1791
02:16:50,902 --> 02:16:52,563
Hey you fellows!
Catch!

1792
02:16:54,005 --> 02:16:56,200
My god, has covered
'Sarpa Kavu' (Abode of Snakes)

1793
02:16:56,641 --> 02:16:58,040
My god!
Creepers!

1794
02:16:58,777 --> 02:17:00,938
Looks like l'll die out of fear

1795
02:17:04,149 --> 02:17:05,741
Who is that?
What man?

1796
02:17:05,917 --> 02:17:07,976
l've told l'll come there,
then why did you come here?

1797
02:17:08,119 --> 02:17:10,019
Didn't come here, they are behind

1798
02:17:10,188 --> 02:17:12,156
Fellow, if you want your life, run!
Other guy is also there!

1799
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:14,048
Hey you stop!
Hey you!

1800
02:17:25,036 --> 02:17:26,094
Just catch them!

1801
02:17:45,991 --> 02:17:48,152
On that night,
Lunar Eclipse took place

1802
02:17:48,293 --> 02:17:51,023
Ended into the permanence
of a divine light

1803
02:17:51,329 --> 02:17:53,593
Later on several generations of
Peruvathu Kadavu, went in

1804
02:17:53,698 --> 02:17:55,723
search of that divine light

1805
02:17:55,867 --> 02:17:59,030
That divine light was
'unknown' even at that time

1806
02:17:59,337 --> 02:18:02,795
During all the festival nights,
had expected the 'divine light'

1807
02:18:04,209 --> 02:18:09,237
But never again did that light
re-emerge in the land of god

1808
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:19,056
''Hanuman, jumped on to
the wall of Ravana''

1809
02:18:19,224 --> 02:18:22,159
Jose -What man?
l wanted to ask long time back

1810
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:25,653
All these compatriots are
saying about the 'divine light'

1811
02:18:25,864 --> 02:18:28,765
On that night, what Vinayan
saw, was it a 'divine light?'

1812
02:18:28,933 --> 02:18:32,699
Asking whether its divine light?
That divine light is very bright light

1813
02:18:32,871 --> 02:18:34,736
The eyes become blind

1814
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:36,907
That is Migraine, is it?
Will just whack you

1815
02:18:37,108 --> 02:18:38,370
Really is there a thing
called 'divine light?'

1816
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:40,007
Why not?
How many years it has been

1817
02:18:40,078 --> 02:18:41,170
Really?
Yeah

1818
02:18:42,781 --> 02:18:45,249
Divine light
Look, Bhagavan's car

1819
02:18:46,551 --> 02:19:16,247
Team DrC

1820
02:19:17,282 --> 02:19:19,375
Got two birds with one stone
Look Vinayan

1821
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:20,649
Where?

1822
02:19:46,411 --> 02:19:47,935
What man Bhajrang Biju?

1823
02:19:50,181 --> 02:19:51,113
Buddy!

1824
02:19:53,051 --> 02:19:56,077
You should be like this
This is not 'eloping blood'

1825
02:19:56,287 --> 02:19:57,914
Kids don't elope okay

1826
02:19:58,957 --> 02:20:00,288
What man?
Not received the box?

1827
02:20:03,495 --> 02:20:05,258
Got man!
Has got the box!

1828
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:07,762
Then start the percussion!

1829
02:20:10,201 --> 02:20:12,192
Hey great man, who
saw the 'divine light'

1830
02:20:12,337 --> 02:20:15,306
'Are Thu Chakkarr'

1831
02:20:22,747 --> 02:20:24,146
Dear compatriots

1832
02:20:24,416 --> 02:20:26,475
What you have been waiting
for with much expectancy

1833
02:20:26,851 --> 02:20:30,048
Vedikettu Velayudhan's special
item, that fires in eight patterns

1834
02:20:30,188 --> 02:20:32,053
'Garbham Kalaki'
(pregnancy destroyer)

1835
02:20:32,257 --> 02:20:33,747
For the first time in Kerala-

1836
02:20:33,892 --> 02:20:36,053
- introduced in the land of
Peruvathu Kadavu

1837
02:20:36,194 --> 02:20:37,957
To astonish you..

1838
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:40,458
Come fellow

1839
02:21:48,466 --> 02:21:50,559
Bhagavan has said
in the Bhagavad Gita

1840
02:21:50,902 --> 02:21:52,494
'Sambhavami yuge yuge' (l advent
Myself millennium after millennium)

1841
02:21:53,438 --> 02:21:57,033
But your fate is
decided by this Bhagavan

1842
02:21:58,376 --> 02:22:00,469
Don't come
Back off man

1843
02:22:08,152 --> 02:22:09,881
Pregnancy destroyed!

1844
02:22:18,296 --> 02:22:19,558
Hey God!

1845
02:22:43,087 --> 02:22:44,577
All these are small things!

1846
02:22:57,635 --> 02:23:00,160
Doesn't know whether God as
come as Vedikettu Velayudhan or-

1847
02:23:00,271 --> 02:23:03,069
-Vedikettu Velayudhan
has come as God

1848
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:06,574
Because of that fireworks,
Vinayan got his Sree Devi

1849
02:23:06,911 --> 02:23:10,142
Compatriots of Peruvathoor
Kadavu got back their talkies

1850
02:23:37,475 --> 02:23:40,000
Years afterthe wonder
that is cinema-

1851
02:23:40,144 --> 02:23:42,635
-rose again at Sree Devi Talkies

1852
02:23:43,014 --> 02:23:45,949
The dusted memories
emerged again

1853
02:23:46,317 --> 02:23:48,308
Vinayan is still waiting

1854
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,283
To return back their Sree
Devi Talkies to Madhavettan

1855
02:24:07,105 --> 02:24:09,164
lts not due to knowing
the importance-

1856
02:24:09,307 --> 02:24:10,569
- of cinema in world history

1857
02:24:10,742 --> 02:24:12,232
Madhavan loved cinema

1858
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:15,072
A sort of passion towards cinema

1859
02:24:15,279 --> 02:24:19,306
That is what makes Madhavan
even today 'a traveling theater'

1860
02:24:19,517 --> 02:24:22,247
Like roots moves to
bedrooms of forefathers

1861
02:24:23,054 --> 02:24:24,988
Let the cinema reach
out to the villages

1862
02:24:25,256 --> 02:24:28,020
Let new good movies
be born again

1863
02:24:45,043 --> 02:24:50,037
''My girl, you may also
come along for the festival''

1864
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:58,553
''You didn't buy make-up
items, l'm not coming''

1865
02:24:58,756 --> 02:25:04,319
''My girl, you may also
come along for the festival''

1866
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:11,058
''You didn't buy make-up
items, l'm not coming''

1867
02:25:11,235 --> 02:25:14,966
''Hey girl, how can l
go without you?''

1868
02:25:15,106 --> 02:25:18,234
''lf you come forfestival,
l'll buy make-up items''

1869
02:25:18,342 --> 02:25:26,113
''lf you buy me a good dress,
l shall come for the festival''

1870
02:25:37,128 --> 02:25:40,097
''Snake Lords''

1871
02:25:44,235 --> 02:25:47,261
''The snake Lords at
the enclosed temple''

1872
02:25:54,045 --> 02:25:58,744
''My girl, you may also
come along for the festival''
