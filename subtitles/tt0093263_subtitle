1
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,152
What difference does it make
if the ruler of this country..

2
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,812
is Ram (God) or Ravan (demon).

3
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,657
The public is
always Sita (exploited).

4
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,818
lf it is Ram, he'll put
her through the test by fire.

5
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:56,824
And if it is Ravan,
he will kidnap her.

6
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:00,168
What difference does it make
if the ruler of this country..

7
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,669
is Kaurav (evil)
or Pandav (goodness).

8
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,501
The public is
Draupadi (exploited).

9
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:08,174
lf it's Kaurav,
he will disgrace her.

10
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,179
And if he is Pandav,
he will put her on stake.

11
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,182
What difference does it make
if the ruler of this country..

12
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,342
is Hindu or Muslim?

13
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:17,682
The public is a living corpse.

14
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,188
lf he's Hindu,
he'll cremate her.

15
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,350
lf Muslim, he will bury her.

16
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:30,642
l am Vishvanath Prasad,
Director of social security.

17
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,322
l am unable to
protect my wife and child.

18
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,326
The hollow statute..

19
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,328
administration
and judiciary here ...

20
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,660
has become
mistress to those in power.

21
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,333
There is misuse of power.

22
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,997
l died every day,
little by little.

23
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,340
Today, l have lost
faith in everything.

24
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,343
l cannot tolerate
this suffocation anymore.

25
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:57,845
l have no reason to live.

26
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,679
Today, virtue is
committing suicide.

27
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,517
Today, justice is
committing suicide.

28
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,358
Today, Vishvanath Prasad,
is compelled to commit suicide.

29
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,364
No!

30
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:27,170
Mr.Vishvanath Prasad was one
of our very capable officers.

31
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,376
His wife was raped, ...

32
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,878
that too, at the hands
of a sitting MLA's son.

33
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,379
Are we in for such days
where people are left ...

34
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:40,718
with only one choice,
to commit suicide?

35
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,384
l have not come
across such an incident ...

36
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:47,725
in so many years of service.
That too, with an lAS officer.

37
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,900
Mr.Pradhan, you are a
senior officer of the CBl.

38
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:55,201
l want you to go to Patna and
investigate this case yourself.

39
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:58,406
And yes, our
capable lPS officer, ...

40
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,407
Abhimanyu Singh will
assist you in this case.

41
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:09,411
Jadhav, she's beautiful.
Shall we pick her?

42
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:14,222
- Desperate? - Yes.

43
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,754
Then let's take
her to the bungalow.

44
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,760
- Take her. - Who
are you? Leave me!

45
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:36,942
You go.

46
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:42,109
Hey SP! This city
is very dangerous.

47
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:45,453
Leaders here play
with law every day.

48
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,955
And consider the
uniform as their whore.

49
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,459
l will very soon teach
a lesson to eunuchs ...

50
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,465
who consider law as game,
and uniform as their whore.

51
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,532
Hey SP! What are you doing?
We won't spare you !

52
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,034
Run, Katta!

53
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,537
Put your thumb impression here.

54
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:15,042
Sir, l've told
you several times ...

55
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,341
l don't know what
you are talking about.

56
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:23,551
- l am not a Naxalite.
- You idiot, l know that.

57
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,054
lt's obvious from your face
that you cannot be a Naxalite.

58
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:31,217
- Leave our man ! - Calm down !

59
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:36,564
Atleast tell me why you have
arrested a man from my Ashram?

60
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,575
- Abhimanyu, you?
- Greetings Yogiji.

61
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:53,244
l have been
transferred here today. But ...

62
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,584
what are you doing here?

63
00:07:56,686 --> 00:08:03,592
They have arrested a man
from my Ashram and are ...

64
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,388
Sir, he is a Naxalite.

65
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:08,096
That's not true! Don't lie!

66
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,258
They arrest some innocent
man for their selfish motive ...

67
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,597
and call him a Naxalite.

68
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:16,598
- You people ... - You go.

69
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:20,608
Yogiji, don't worry,
l'll look into this.

70
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,611
lf you don't put
your thumb impression ...

71
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,611
on this consent letter ...

72
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:27,945
you will see your
entire family dead tomorrow.

73
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,611
No! Where do l put
the thumb impression?

74
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:46,634
- You? - Address me
as 'sir' henceforth.

75
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:49,295
My name is Abhimanyu Singh.

76
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,638
Alright sir.

77
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,440
- Who is he? - He is a Naxalite.

78
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,646
l have arrested him!
l'm taking him to court.

79
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,645
You have worked
enough in arresting him.

80
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,653
Now l will take him to court.

81
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:11,660
- But l have arrested him.
- Will you please leave?

82
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,327
- And keep your uniform
buttoned up. - Yes sir.

83
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,006
The idiot came
at the wrong time.

84
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,180
- Why did he arrest you?
- What do l say, sir?

85
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,684
l had come here to
seek Yogiji's blessings ...

86
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:42,349
as my wife has
just delivered a baby.

87
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,186
l don't know why l was arrested.

88
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,689
Want to go back home?

89
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,362
l don't understand.

90
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,698
Go.

91
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,307
Go...l said, go.

92
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:04,711
No sir, l know. Put
me in jail if you like.

93
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,372
But please don't kill me.

94
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:11,048
l know, as soon as l leave,
you will shoot me.

95
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:18,055
Take....take! Go to your child.

96
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:19,720
Go.

97
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,242
Sir, l'm going.

98
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,752
lt's just a few hours
since you came here ...

99
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,255
and you let a Naxalite go?

100
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,554
That's what l regret, sir.
Wish l had come here earlier.

101
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:54,760
Then a few more
innocents would be saved.

102
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:58,095
Mr.Singh, stop
talking in riddles.

103
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:01,099
What are you trying to say?

104
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:06,274
- Sir, ask Mr.Brij Bhushan.
- l don't understand, sir.

105
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,776
Alright, l'll explain.

106
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,110
You have earned many medals,
Mr.Brij Bhushan.

107
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,784
You must have surely got
them for arresting Naxalites.

108
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:20,947
- Yes sir. - Nice
method you have adopted.

109
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,587
What's all this about, Mr.Singh?

110
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,121
l'll tell you, sir.

111
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,793
He arrests poor,
innocent people, ...

112
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:33,597
threatens them and makes
them confess they are Naxalites.

113
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:38,538
-That's the secret of his
medals -What nonsense are you ...

114
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:43,805
lt is not nonsense Mr.Brij
Bhushan ! l saw it for myself...

115
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,608
what you were
doing with that man.

116
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,613
lf l make an official report,
you will get suspended.

117
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:54,987
Commissioner, l was
only doing my duty.

118
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,324
You explain his duty to him.

119
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,329
Come, l'll
introduce you to someone.

120
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,164
Come, Mr.Singh.

121
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,841
He's Mr.Pradhan from the CBl.
He's come from Delhi.

122
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,843
And he's Mr.Singh, the SP here.

123
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,641
He got posted here only today.

124
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,506
Please sit down.

125
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:26,522
Mr.Pradhan,
here's your case file.

126
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,357
Please give me detailed
information about this case.

127
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,191
Sure, but l don't think there is
anything special about this case.

128
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,858
Whatever, but l
still want the facts.

129
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:44,872
lAS officer Vishvanath
Prasad committed suicide.

130
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,876
His wife is of
immoral character.

131
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,208
Her husband had come to
know of her immorality.

132
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:56,547
He could not
tolerate this incident.

133
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,887
The one who has
been accused of rape ...

134
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,048
is from a respectable family.

135
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:06,891
He has run away from here because
public opinion is against him.

136
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:09,394
Can we meet that woman?

137
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:15,898
Yes, why not? You can go
and meet her today itself.

138
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,234
Yes, what
happened was really sad.

139
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,244
Who can stall what is destined?

140
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,415
Have patience,
everything will be sorted out.

141
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:33,586
Only, you have
to seal your mouth.

142
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,923
l'll handle the rest.

143
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:39,261
Why did you have to
take matters so far?

144
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,928
Better mind your tongue,
understand?

145
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,728
You have to take care
of your daughter now.

146
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:53,434
lt is very difficult to
tell what the real fact is.

147
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:59,271
As far as l know, Vishvanath
Prasad's family was very happy.

148
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:06,953
He is no more. Even
his wife is almost dead.

149
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,958
What must have happened
in their personal life ...

150
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,959
we can only lay a guess.

151
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:18,966
What different people
saw and heard reached me.

152
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:24,131
Because people know l
protest against injustice.

153
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:37,149
Greetings. You are the new
CBl officer,Mr.Pradhan, right?

154
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:39,983
Congratulations on
your new assignment.

155
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:45,153
Great! A uniformed man and a
revolutionary together with you !

156
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:49,492
Just like the rapist and
the power holder is together.

157
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:54,330
Mr.Pradhan, the situation in
the state is getting complicated.

158
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,998
You understand the relationship
between Center and state.

159
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:01,007
So think twice
before you take any step.

160
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,339
l'll be going.

161
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,505
Good day.

162
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,344
Come.

163
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:18,685
They want to help you, child.

164
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:23,365
Can their help give
me back what l have lost?

165
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,367
Ask them to leave.

166
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,371
Listen...listen to me.

167
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:36,538
Look madam, only you know
what you are going through.

168
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:44,848
Only you can feel it. We
only want to reduce your pain.

169
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:49,555
And that is possible only
if the culprit is booked.

170
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,388
ln your dejection
lies their victory.

171
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:57,057
And in their victory,
is the defeat of all of us.

172
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,063
And l hate to lose.

173
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,572
l know what l am going to
say is going to hurt you.

174
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,073
l apologise for that.

175
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:11,078
But we have to
punish the culprits.

176
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,238
You will have to tell
us about that incident.

177
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:33,769
When he was
transferred to this city ...

178
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:37,769
we were so happy together.

179
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,139
''l have seen ...''

180
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:22,651
''for the first time ...''

181
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:28,484
''love in my beloved's eyes''

182
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:44,833
''Day and night, dawn
and dusk, l keep waiting''

183
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:50,337
''Even in desperation,
l find peace''

184
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,257
''Let me take you in my arms,
cross all limits ...''

185
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,259
''and savor the moment''

186
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:23,271
''My desperation wants
me to kiss your lips''

187
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:28,275
''What has happened to my
beloved in this romantic weather''

188
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,277
''What mischief ...''

189
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:47,795
''has the spring
brought along this time?''

190
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:53,300
''Love in my beloved's eyes ...''

191
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,685
''You're not aware of the coyness
behind closed eyes, my love''

192
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:04,372
''Take me in your arms,
l'm obsessed with love''

193
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:09,376
''My passion is thirsting,
and so is my heart''

194
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:14,381
''What do l do?'

195
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,385
''For my beloved ...''

196
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:28,395
''l'll even give up my life''

197
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:34,060
''Love in my beloved's eyes ...''

198
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,783
Come Kunti. Come, dear.

199
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,449
Driver, you get the luggage.

200
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:32,956
- Who is he? - Ask him.

201
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,962
Who are you, and
what are you doing here?

202
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,464
She'll get scared and won't
eat. Keep quiet for some time.

203
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:42,793
l am talking to you ! We
have been allotted this house.

204
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:47,137
- Leave this place. -
We should leave? Why?

205
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:51,474
- Do you know Madam? -
We don't know any Madam.

206
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,810
You remove your
things from here.

207
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:59,980
Remove our things?..We've been
staying here since many days.

208
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,486
How can we vacate
the place like that?

209
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,491
- We will stay here.
- That is not possible.

210
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,493
Hey! This is a
government quarter ...

211
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,153
not your father's property.

212
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:10,999
Moreover, you are
talking so rudely!

213
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,831
- Pack your things
and leave! - Listen to me.

214
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:18,502
l am not going to leave.

215
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:22,168
You go and speak to Madam
over there, in that house.

216
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:27,510
- Who's this Madam? - Rameshwari
Verma, she's a minister here.

217
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,849
Let's go and meet her, Kunti.

218
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,517
Let me see who this
Rameshwari Verma is.

219
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:42,524
Hello Madam. l am
Vishvanath Prasad.

220
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,532
l have just got transferred here
as Director of social securities

221
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:56,871
- Have any problem here?
- No Madam, no problem.

222
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,539
- l had a request. - Tell me.

223
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:03,218
The house opposite
has been allotted to me.

224
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,554
l'd like to move
in as soon as l can.

225
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,558
But some people are
already staying there and ...

226
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,890
Look for some other house.

227
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:17,727
There is no dearth of
houses here. You'll get many.

228
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,892
My people are staying there.

229
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:25,065
Madam, you should know that
this is no one's private home.

230
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:29,573
The government has
allotted this house to me.

231
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,580
How long can l live with my
family in the Circuit house?

232
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:40,087
Look, don't argue with me.
You cannot get this house.

233
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:44,249
This is too much. l'm requesting
you, and you are ordering me?

234
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:48,092
l want the house
vacated immediately.

235
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:51,928
Look...what was
your name did you say?

236
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:59,601
Look Mr.Prasad,
whatever l say is rule here.

237
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,939
And what l do is law.

238
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:07,937
Go. You are new here,
so l'm sparing you.

239
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,280
- Leave. - What
will you spare me?

240
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,948
Don't teach me law.
Even l am an lAS officer.

241
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,425
l'll show you how a
government quarter is vacated.

242
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,148
Wonder who she thinks she is.
She says we won't get the house.

243
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,647
Like as if she's the boss.

244
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,982
You are unnecessarily getting
worked up. We'll stay here.

245
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,988
Why should we stay here?

246
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:52,157
The government has allotted us
that house,we have a right to it.

247
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:57,664
- l will take that house!
- But tell me what happened.

248
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:04,069
She told me what she does is
law and what she says is rule.

249
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:06,670
l won't allow that.

250
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:12,679
Don't worry about the house.
We'll get a house.

251
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,681
lt's a question of principle.

252
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,342
They have turned a
good house into a cowshed.

253
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,012
Why are you scolding mom?

254
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,854
Alright, come inside,
l'll serve dinner.

255
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:41,705
Can you tell me where this place
is? l've been looking since long.

256
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:47,372
Under my shirt is a
fully loaded pistol.

257
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:51,213
lf you care for your life,
get off the car and run.

258
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:04,054
l have lodged a complain.
You can leave now.

259
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,895
But don't have much hopes.

260
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:08,732
But please try and do something.

261
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,068
Alright, l'll try.

262
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:18,239
- Just a minute. - Yes?

263
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,543
Lodging a complaint
here is not going to help.

264
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,751
Understand? Not at all. The
file will close without action..

265
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,548
after a few days.

266
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:31,918
lf you want back your car,
go and complain to the CM.

267
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:35,929
The police cannot help you
in this matter. Understand?

268
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,554
- CM? - Yes.

269
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:42,098
l'm helpless. One has to
do everything in politics.

270
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:45,766
Wait here, l'll ask the CM.

271
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,787
How did my car
reach the CM's bungalow?

272
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,792
The CM must not be aware of it.

273
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,455
God! The kind of
people that are here.

274
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,121
Go.

275
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,135
l had a complaint, sir.

276
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:20,800
- Yes, tell me,
Mr.Sharma. - My name is Mishra.

277
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,540
Go ahead, speak
without hesitation.

278
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:27,308
- My car was stolen. -
ls this a police station?

279
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,813
Go and lodge a
complaint in the police station.

280
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:33,978
Why have you come here? - Sir, my
car is parked in your bungalow.

281
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:37,150
The blue Maruti is mine.

282
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,319
And this man took
it from me at gunpoint.

283
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,329
Bellu, how could you !
Return his car.

284
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:49,826
- l would sir, but ... -
What but? Just return his car.

285
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,001
Look Mr.Mishra, he's laughing.
He still very young.

286
00:28:56,111 --> 00:29:00,844
He has worked hard. Do
one thing; pay him some money.

287
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,179
Pay him Rs.50-60 thousand.

288
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:10,525
- Hello. - Yes?

289
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:14,855
- l am Rameshwari Verma.
- My husband is not home.

290
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:16,861
l know.

291
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,524
Yet why l have come here?

292
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:29,871
lt's my son's birthday, and
the people of my constituency...

293
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,878
have organized a party.

294
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,211
- l want you also
to join. - Look l ...

295
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:41,886
l think the differences between
me and Prasad have upset you.

296
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,551
- He is my husband.
- That's very nice.

297
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,561
Or one hardly comes
across such feelings nowadays.

298
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,394
Mrs.Prasad, l'd like
to tell you something.

299
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,401
l have no enmity
with your husband.

300
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,404
And l think even he
has no enmity with me.

301
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:04,408
Yet, if you have been put
to trouble because of me ...

302
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:06,910
- l apologise for it. -
Please don't apologise.

303
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,917
Then should l
assume you will come?

304
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:16,423
Yes. Since you are insisting,
l will come for some time.

305
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,252
Thank you.

306
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,930
lt's the first time l have come
to personally invite someone.

307
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:27,427
l'll wait for you.

308
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,947
''What a gait you have ...''

309
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:44,948
''O fair maiden !''

310
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,988
You are very sexy!

311
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,320
''lt's fun ...''

312
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:34,999
''Not at home, in the street,
the river, or sand''

313
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,341
''lt's fun ...''

314
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:52,012
''in the fields''

315
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:36,553
''How will we meet?''

316
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:49,075
''How will what's
on my mind happen?''

317
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:57,584
''lt is difficult to
escape the eyes of the world''

318
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:01,587
''Let's run away from here''

319
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:14,100
''Not at home, in the street,
the river, or sand''

320
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,102
''Then where else, girl?'

321
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,182
''My body aches all over''

322
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:48,856
''But l'm
helpless before my beau''

323
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,199
''l cannot hold back my
youth anymore, my love''

324
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:05,541
''Come and take me in your arms''

325
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:18,224
''Not at home,
in the street, ...''

326
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:45,305
What is the matter? You
are being very loving today.

327
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:50,316
Because l won't be able
to love you for two days.

328
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,318
What do you mean?

329
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:59,325
l have to go out of town on
official duty for two days.

330
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,657
- When? - Tomorrow.

331
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:06,994
-But you'll be back
in two days? -l'll try.

332
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:11,837
l'm going on government duty.
Can't trust how long it'll take.

333
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:19,339
This beautiful
gift for my birthday.

334
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:23,848
'Oh, that beautiful
smooth as marble body!'

335
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,683
'People call it the Taj Mahal'

336
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:30,687
But regretfully, she is
someone else's wife, ...

337
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,352
as lAS officer's wife.
What do l do?

338
00:38:03,224 --> 00:38:05,055
She's taking very long.

339
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:12,398
Child, do eat your lunch. Don't
bring it back like yesterday.

340
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,061
And as soon as school
is over, take the bus.

341
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,070
- Don't go anywhere.
- Yes mummy.

342
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:24,741
Bunty, she's very sexy.
We'll have to do something.

343
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,908
l'm Mrs.Prasad.
ls my husband in?

344
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,919
- He's on tour. - But he was
supposed to come last evening.

345
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,421
- He hasn't come yet. -
He will come today evening.

346
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:40,756
Alright...He will
surely come today evening?

347
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:43,221
- Yes, he will. - Alright, bye.

348
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,439
- Hello baby,
how are you? - You !

349
00:38:56,544 --> 00:39:01,446
- Good! You recognised me.
- l know people like you !

350
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,777
But you perhaps don't know
my husband is an lAS officer.

351
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:08,447
l also know he is not
going to return until evening.

352
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,956
- What do you want?
- l want you.

353
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:35,475
What kind of behavior is this?
What are you doing?

354
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:40,486
l didn't do anything. But
l'll do whatever you say now.

355
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:43,812
Come on, smile.

356
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:49,829
- You've made me wait
too long. - Leave me!

357
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:51,995
Alright, l'll leave you.

358
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:13,847
Get out of here, or
l'll call the police!

359
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:16,519
Police?

360
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:29,535
- Look, l'm a married woman.
- That's what l regret.

361
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:33,032
- Let me go, for God's sake.
- l'm not so decent.

362
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:37,533
Let go such a
beautiful woman for God? No.

363
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,554
Leave me!

364
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,067
Trying to resist me!

365
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:38,933
Where will you escape?

366
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:42,272
Trying to act very smart, eh?

367
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,608
You're getting violent?

368
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:53,620
l told you to give in.
But you didn't.

369
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,622
Look how much it is bleeding.

370
00:41:56,724 --> 00:42:00,125
Why are you troubling
yourself so much, and me too?

371
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,968
Why are you
making me run after you?

372
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:11,634
Acting too smart! Come on !

373
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:17,643
Give in. You won't?

374
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:27,653
Let me see what you will do now.

375
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:31,986
Now it is fine.

376
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,664
What will you do now?

377
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,004
You have lot of strength, eh?

378
00:42:51,512 --> 00:42:52,672
l'll fix you.

379
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:02,017
For God's sake, let me go.

380
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:05,351
l will.

381
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,198
Now you are
completely under my control.

382
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,890
Papa is back!

383
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:32,897
What's the matter? My baby
is playing outside till now?

384
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,896
You've become so untidy.

385
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:42,567
- Where is your mummy? - Mummy
was unwell and she was crying.

386
00:46:43,277 --> 00:46:45,404
She was unwell,
and she was crying?

387
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,241
Let us go and see her.

388
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,421
- What's the matter,
Kunti? - Nothing.

389
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:59,424
My body was aching.

390
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:00,924
Perhaps because of exhaustion.

391
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,587
Go and bring water.

392
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:06,728
Did you take any medicine?

393
00:47:07,768 --> 00:47:09,429
And why are you
sitting in the dark?

394
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:11,435
l don't want lights.

395
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,270
Kunti, you are unwell.
l'll call the doctor.

396
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:22,946
Don't be worried.

397
00:47:23,484 --> 00:47:25,952
Sit besides me for some time.

398
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,282
l'll be all right.

399
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,621
l will sit besides you.

400
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,959
She will be with you
and help you in your chores.

401
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,295
And you'll get some rest.

402
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,466
Don't be upset.

403
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:46,471
So what if he is an lAS?
We are in power.

404
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:47,471
l'll manage everything.

405
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,308
Study well, dear.

406
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:11,994
Won't you ask me to come in?

407
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,000
lt was bad.

408
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:19,003
Very bad.

409
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:25,010
But what can't help it?
Bunty has become a spoiled brat.

410
00:48:28,382 --> 00:48:31,510
What else can we do?
He does not listen to us.

411
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,515
His age is such.

412
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:39,522
Anyway. Forget all that.

413
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:42,020
This happens in life.

414
00:48:43,864 --> 00:48:45,525
A woman should save
herself from defamation.

415
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,033
That is very important.

416
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,370
You will be defamed. Am l right?

417
00:48:53,140 --> 00:49:00,046
But don't worry. Our Bunty
will not do anything like that.

418
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:04,214
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

419
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:08,555
Bunty can harm your
husband and your child too.

420
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:11,383
And he can easily
get away with it.

421
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:13,051
We are in power.

422
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:18,562
So keep your
mouth shut. Understand?

423
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:21,560
She is my wife.

424
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:27,574
And now stop threatening her.

425
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:31,742
Wow! l appreciate your courage.

426
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:34,744
See you again. Very soon.

427
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,475
Get lost from here!

428
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,083
Hey, your
daughter is very pretty.

429
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,092
Just like her mother.

430
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,436
Dear, you go inside.

431
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,777
- Come, dear. - Kunti, you wait.

432
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:08,281
What was
Rameshwari Verma doing here?

433
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:11,783
- Well, ... - Who is Bunty?

434
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:17,923
Kunti, tell me everything.
Why did she come here?

435
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:22,625
l .... l was about to tell you.

436
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:25,124
What's the matter, Kunti?

437
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:32,136
Look at me. Don't be afraid.
Tell me everything.

438
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,798
Tell me everything, Kunti.

439
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,176
Please forgive me.

440
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:18,681
l was helpless.

441
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,252
What a disaster!

442
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:41,596
Mr.Ravi, my job should be done.
l'll spend any amount of money.

443
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:50,269
Ravi, Prasad speaking.

444
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:51,776
Tell me, Prasad.

445
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:53,607
What's the matter?
You sound worried.

446
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:58,777
Yes. l'm very
worried and tensed.

447
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:02,614
l need your help.

448
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:04,953
Why? What happened? ls
your wife and child alright?

449
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:06,622
l am ruined.

450
00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:10,622
Nothing is fine.

451
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:18,303
He barged into my
house in the afternoon,...

452
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:21,299
... and Kunti ...

453
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:26,471
That bastard raped Kunti!

454
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,310
What! Who is he? l'll
have him behind bars right now.

455
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,316
Rameshwari Verma's son.

456
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:38,482
And his mother came and
threatened us to keep quiet.

457
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,654
Take him into custody and
kill him in an encounter!

458
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:47,830
That's alright.
But it is illegal.

459
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,493
l can't do this.

460
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:52,128
What! What do you mean?

461
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,340
And what he did with Kunti,
was that legal?

462
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:58,843
We can take action only if
there's an FlR against him.

463
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:00,343
They are not ordinary people...

464
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:05,009
... that l can put them in
the lock up without reason.

465
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:12,350
l hope you understand?

466
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:13,685
l understand very well.

467
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:44,381
Silence!

468
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,392
What is this lAS doing here?

469
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:54,399
l will come when l am free.

470
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:55,399
Where's lnsp.Brij?

471
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,198
l asked where is lnsp. Brij.

472
00:54:59,773 --> 00:55:01,400
Sir, he'll be back.

473
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,411
Sir, why did you
bother to come here?

474
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:10,415
You should have summoned me.

475
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:13,748
Please be seated, sir.

476
00:55:14,955 --> 00:55:16,923
l want to register an FlR.

477
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,423
Sir, why did you
need to register an FlR?

478
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:21,426
You just tell me the name.

479
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:24,428
l'll put him in the
lock up and make him parade.

480
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:26,760
First you register the FlR.

481
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:30,435
Alright. lf you insist,
l'll register your FlR.

482
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:35,167
- Today around 12 a.m.,...
- At 12 a.m.,...

483
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:39,439
A goon barged into my house,...

484
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,946
... and misbehaved with my wife.

485
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:44,113
What is his name?

486
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,953
- Rameshwari Verma's
son Bunty. - Rameshwari ....

487
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:00,465
Write that he ...
He raped my wife!

488
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:04,799
What are you saying? How
can l register this complaint?

489
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:07,473
You should complain to
the higher authorities.

490
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:09,474
Shut up and write. Why can't
you register this complaint?

491
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,476
Don't you love your job?

492
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:15,139
Write that Rameshwari
Verma's son raped my wife.

493
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:18,982
- How can l register it?
- You can't? Give it to me!

494
00:56:19,186 --> 00:56:20,813
lt's better if you write it.

495
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:29,821
Let it be, Mr.Brijbhushan. A
pen does not suit in your hands.

496
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:33,495
You just
arrange for the glasses.

497
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,498
Who are you?

498
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:38,838
How did you dare to
come in like this? Get lost!

499
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:46,841
Where will we
keep the savouries?

500
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:48,678
Will we keep it on your head?!

501
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:51,846
Come on, arrange for some paper.

502
00:56:55,055 --> 00:56:56,682
What nonsense is this!

503
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:57,848
Hey, what's happening?

504
00:56:58,725 --> 00:57:00,852
Sir, what are you doing?
Please don't argue with them.

505
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:02,258
They tore the FlR.

506
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:05,525
Sir, complain to the higher
authorities. l beg of you, sir.

507
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:08,532
l am an lAS officer.

508
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:13,035
l am the watchdog
of social security.

509
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:16,034
l don't need justice from you.

510
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,542
l will fight for justice.

511
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:32,215
l will fix all
of you. Move aside!

512
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:43,566
Are you high? lt happens
in such state. Never mind.

513
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:48,573
l won't spare you. Do you
think this is your territory?

514
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:50,576
He is out of his mind.

515
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:57,582
l don't think, l know.
This city is my territory.

516
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:58,912
What can you do?

517
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,754
You ain't aware
of what l can do.

518
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,586
Go home. Your
wife must be waiting.

519
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,250
Take care of her.

520
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:09,921
lf you need,
even l can help you.

521
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,927
You scoundrel! l'll
show you your place!

522
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:18,598
Give my regards to your wife.

523
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,266
l'll get back you all.

524
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,628
Who is it?

525
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:03,642
Who are you?
Why don't you speak?

526
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,982
What nonsense is this!
lt's 12 midnight.

527
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:09,987
Why are you giving blank calls?

528
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:17,662
- Who was on line? - Nothing.
You go to sleep.

529
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:20,995
Someone is playing mischief.
He's giving blank calls.

530
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:29,837
- There it rings again.
- You wait, l'll see.

531
00:59:43,056 --> 00:59:47,015
We are coming. Open the door,
or there'll be disaster.

532
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:49,687
We might kill
your husband and child.

533
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:54,030
lt's better for you that
you keep your mouth shut.

534
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,692
Understand, baby?

535
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:14,719
Hereafter we will not stay here.

536
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:16,721
We will leave in
the morning itself.

537
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:20,720
- Where will we go? - Anywhere.
But we won't stay here.

538
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,051
l'm very scared here.

539
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:25,893
Just take me away from here.

540
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,067
Alright. Wait till morning.

541
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,730
Let's go inside.

542
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:46,079
Who is it outside?

543
01:00:46,953 --> 01:00:49,080
Hey, why are you
banging the door? Who are you?

544
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:52,754
Kunti, take Sana inside.

545
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:03,927
They cut off the power supply?

546
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:06,096
lsn't there anything
like law in this city?

547
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:11,102
They disconnected the phone too.

548
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:16,940
Let's go inside.

549
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:23,785
You stay here, dear. Don't be
afraid. l'll bring the torch.

550
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:38,803
l told you they
are very dangerous.

551
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:55,980
Do something. l am
very scared to stay here.

552
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:57,147
Do you hear me?

553
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,827
For the sake of our daughter.

554
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:07,490
What do you want?

555
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,334
l want to meet the Governor.

556
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:13,496
He is very busy today.
You can't meet him.

557
01:02:13,606 --> 01:02:16,006
The police is refusing
to register my complaint.

558
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:17,841
lt is a criminal case.

559
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:24,016
Bunty Verma
misbehaved with my wife.

560
01:02:25,685 --> 01:02:28,848
Hey Ramesh, come here.
Give this file in the accounts.

561
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:33,852
l am talking to you.

562
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:38,030
l said, Bunty Verma
misbehaved with my wife.

563
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:46,666
l'm talking to you ! Bunty
Verma misbehaved with my wife.

564
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,207
My wife was raped.

565
01:02:50,076 --> 01:02:51,202
lt is not a small incident.

566
01:02:52,078 --> 01:02:53,875
l want to meet the
governor right now.

567
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:59,048
Don't shout! This
is Governor's office.

568
01:02:59,419 --> 01:03:02,877
l already told you that the
governor is quite busy today.

569
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:04,217
You can't meet him.

570
01:03:04,424 --> 01:03:06,688
And as it is, he has
to attend a function.

571
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:08,551
l am preparing a speech for him.

572
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,892
Write your petition,
l'll give it to Sir.

573
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,898
l'll write the petition,
if you insist.

574
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,900
l'm fed up. And the
mosquitoes are biting.

575
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,236
How long should
we wait for them?

576
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,409
The car is coming.

577
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:45,930
Welcome, sir.

578
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,433
He is an officer.

579
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:54,096
Don't let his feet fall on
the ground, they'll get dirty.

580
01:03:54,207 --> 01:03:55,606
Lift him.

581
01:03:55,708 --> 01:04:01,112
Hey, what are you doing?
This is unfair.

582
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:05,947
What is unfair?! We are just
lifting him on our shoulders.

583
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:10,955
First teach him a lesson.
Beat him!

584
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:20,125
Hold him! Trying
to be a big officer!

585
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,468
Take him in front of Bunty.

586
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,967
Hey, leave my hand.

587
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:37,977
Stay within your limits,
Narendra Verma alias Bunty.

588
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,986
Very soon you
will be behind bars.

589
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:45,990
You're acting
smart because of this?

590
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:49,658
Do you know my status now?

591
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,000
- How much does it measure?
- 6' inches.

592
01:04:57,103 --> 01:05:00,800
Tell him! That l can finish him.

593
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:04,335
You all are hand in gloves.

594
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:06,341
l will see you, Bunty!

595
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:11,508
Well, that's later. But
l've see what l had to.

596
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:15,676
l've seen from head to toe.
Your wife is very beautiful.

597
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:19,023
Very hot!

598
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:32,534
Prasad, this is
not the place for you.

599
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,038
Heed me. Get yourself
transferred from here.

600
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:41,045
Stop talking nonsense!
Why should l go from here?

601
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:44,377
Fearing these goons?

602
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:50,212
l will stay here and
fight the legal battle.

603
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:51,381
No use!

604
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,388
There's no law here. No
one will come to help you.

605
01:05:57,497 --> 01:06:00,397
This is the law of jungle.

606
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:06,397
lf you have the courage, pick
up the gun and kill each one.

607
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,237
l have the courage,
and l will avenge.

608
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,407
But in my own way.

609
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,240
ln legal way.

610
01:06:17,784 --> 01:06:19,081
Sir, a call for you.

611
01:06:23,189 --> 01:06:25,089
Yes, tell me.
What is your problem?

612
01:06:26,626 --> 01:06:28,093
Sir, l am very tensed.

613
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:30,421
Then what's my fault in it?

614
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:35,092
No, sir. A very big
mishap happened with me.

615
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:39,103
Nobody is
paying attention to me.

616
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:42,106
The police refused
to register the FlR.

617
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:48,279
Sir, my wife was raped.

618
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:54,444
MLA Rameshwari
Verma's Bunty raped my wife.

619
01:06:57,657 --> 01:06:59,454
l need your help, sir.

620
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:03,455
l see! This Bunty
is a spoiled brat!

621
01:07:06,332 --> 01:07:10,132
You come to my
place tomorrow morning,...

622
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:13,296
-... l'll listen to your
plight. Okay? - Okay, sir.

623
01:07:15,408 --> 01:07:18,138
So does Bunty get
liquor contract license?

624
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:22,476
He is like my son. You
don't have to worry about that.

625
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:25,149
Please come, Mr.Prasad.

626
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:29,482
Please sit down.

627
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:35,486
Get something for Mr.Prasad.

628
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,164
More than you, l am
fed up of this boy.

629
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:50,674
And listen, Rameshwari.
Now this is the last time.

630
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:54,507
Hereafter if he does anything
wrong, l can't help you.

631
01:07:56,382 --> 01:07:58,350
Bunty, don't you
have any limits?!

632
01:08:01,387 --> 01:08:02,354
Come on, apologize.

633
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:13,194
Mr.Prasad, l am very
sorry that l raped your wife.

634
01:08:15,034 --> 01:08:17,194
l will not do it again. Okay?

635
01:08:18,037 --> 01:08:20,198
Look, he apologized.

636
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,536
Are you happy now?

637
01:08:22,642 --> 01:08:24,200
What rubbish is this, sir?

638
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,541
What's rubbish about it?
You're just too much, Mr.Prasad.

639
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:31,383
He's a kid. He made a mistake.

640
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:33,714
He is apologizing. Forgive him.

641
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:36,879
Because of his mistake,
my life is ruined.

642
01:08:39,058 --> 01:08:43,221
You call a gruesome crime
like rape, a small mistake?

643
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,226
A childishness?!

644
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:51,736
No, sir. He
deserves to be punished.

645
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,736
Which you won't give him.

646
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:01,245
l made a mistake. l
came to you with great hopes.

647
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:09,577
l will do something which
will help us get justice.

648
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:16,428
Go, and see him to the door.

649
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:25,428
He is trying to make
a mountain of a mole.

650
01:09:25,638 --> 01:09:28,435
Then you just ignore him.

651
01:11:45,678 --> 01:11:47,407
This is the affidavit.

652
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:51,415
lf you sign it, legal
procedure will begin.

653
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,923
We want to meet Kunti.

654
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,150
Mr. Pradhan, we
want to meet Kunti.

655
01:12:02,261 --> 01:12:05,753
- lt is not possible now. - Why
not? We want to know the truth?

656
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:09,432
We will tell you the
truth when the right time comes.

657
01:12:15,641 --> 01:12:19,098
Will it be the real truth,
or made by the police?

658
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:22,241
Which has less truth,
and more of lies.

659
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,027
Aren't policemen human beings?

660
01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:38,164
l haven't come across any yet.

661
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:40,865
How do you know?

662
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:46,837
l'm a reporter. lt is my
duty to keep every information.

663
01:12:50,483 --> 01:12:52,849
Hey, wait! l've
brought something for you.

664
01:12:55,488 --> 01:12:57,183
What's so funny about it?

665
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:59,889
What else can you policemen
give, except handcuffs?

666
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:02,117
You are absolutely right.

667
01:13:02,228 --> 01:13:05,720
- l've brought you a handcuff.
- l was right.

668
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:13,731
Are you willing to
be arrested forever?

669
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,067
Yes, l am.

670
01:13:42,535 --> 01:13:47,495
''Ever since l'm seeing you,...''

671
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:56,114
''Something has
happened to my heart''

672
01:13:56,215 --> 01:14:05,783
''l lost my sleep,
as well as my peace''

673
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:11,460
''Ever since l'm seeing you,...''

674
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:16,795
''Something has
happened to my heart''

675
01:14:23,009 --> 01:14:29,812
''l lost my sleep,
as well as my peace''

676
01:14:58,945 --> 01:15:04,508
''Resides in my heart, a
stranger has become dear''

677
01:15:04,617 --> 01:15:07,848
''My innocent heart
couldn't understand''

678
01:15:07,954 --> 01:15:10,013
''Someone walked in stealthily''

679
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:20,025
''What joy, what
intoxication is this''

680
01:15:25,905 --> 01:15:31,036
''Ever since l'm seeing you,...''

681
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,925
''Secret of the
heart are revealed''

682
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:23,928
''Hope everything doesn't change''

683
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,090
''Strangers become dear ones''

684
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,928
''My heart is impatient''

685
01:16:34,974 --> 01:16:40,105
''What an ambience,
what a lovely feeling''

686
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:50,945
''Something has
happened to my heart''

687
01:16:57,997 --> 01:17:02,957
''Ever since l'm seeing you,...''

688
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:21,820
Tell me something.

689
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:24,981
lf you stay away from
your beloved police force ...

690
01:17:25,091 --> 01:17:27,889
... for 24 hours,
will any disaster befall?

691
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:32,054
Reena, what are you saying?

692
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:34,323
Please tell me.

693
01:17:35,034 --> 01:17:38,333
Reena, it's not the
matter of 24 hours, ...

694
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:40,337
... it's the
matter of principles.

695
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,804
l am never late for duty.

696
01:17:44,043 --> 01:17:47,012
Yes! Why would you be late?

697
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,407
You are too fond of
staying amongst criminals.

698
01:17:52,051 --> 01:17:54,679
By the way, nowadays even
women have become dacoits.

699
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:57,346
And one of them
is beautiful too.

700
01:17:59,058 --> 01:18:02,027
May l know who won your heart?

701
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:06,031
You have stolen my heart.

702
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:09,026
Where else can l go?

703
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:13,197
For my sake, stay back
for one day. Just for one day.

704
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:16,502
- No, Reena. l have some
urgent work. - Just one day.

705
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:20,175
l've never asked for anything.

706
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:24,215
Alright. But just for one day.

707
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:56,141
How did this happen?

708
01:18:58,117 --> 01:18:58,981
What happened here?

709
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:02,076
Mr.Rathod arrested a
tribal boy yesterday.

710
01:19:02,188 --> 01:19:04,088
When the tribals came
to get him released,...

711
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,884
... he opened fire on them.

712
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:09,557
- Where is Rathod? - Sir,
he is missing since last night.

713
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:16,499
So much irresponsibility
by an lPS officer?

714
01:19:16,602 --> 01:19:18,570
Home Minister is
demanding an explanation.

715
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:20,771
Where were you when
this incident occurred?

716
01:19:20,873 --> 01:19:22,932
We heard that you
were with a woman.

717
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:28,106
Mr.Singh,this inquiry commission
holds you responsible ...

718
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:31,012
... for this incident. And
you are suspended for 6' months.

719
01:19:33,152 --> 01:19:35,120
lnsp.Singh is a killer!

720
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:41,058
lf you wish, you
can take the back door.

721
01:19:53,339 --> 01:19:55,307
He is the killer!

722
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:58,803
Beat him!

723
01:20:15,194 --> 01:20:19,153
Hadn't you told me to stay back,
hadn't l listened to you,...

724
01:20:19,265 --> 01:20:20,960
... this wouldn't have happened.

725
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,929
You are saying this?

726
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:25,526
You hold me
responsible for all this?

727
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:27,833
Then who else
should l blame? Myself?

728
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:32,908
Alright. Perhaps
it was my mistake.

729
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:35,206
l was foolish to
be influenced by you.

730
01:20:35,547 --> 01:20:39,574
Now do me a favour.
Leave me alone.

731
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:02,366
- We have Bunty's
arrest warrant. - What!

732
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:10,371
This is just a beginning.
See what happens further.

733
01:21:17,256 --> 01:21:19,224
The media has
created an hue and cry.

734
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:22,389
Everyone knows
where is Bunty Verma.

735
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,390
Only our police
is unaware of it.

736
01:21:28,434 --> 01:21:31,232
According to them,
he is absconding.

737
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:36,332
lt's a very shameful
thing for the police department.

738
01:21:38,277 --> 01:21:41,371
Now the responsibility is on us.

739
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:45,139
Where will we find Bunty Verma?

740
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,719
Sir, if it is so,...

741
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:53,588
... why not ask the media?

742
01:21:55,294 --> 01:21:58,263
The reporter of 21th
Century Times, Ms.Reena.

743
01:21:59,298 --> 01:22:01,527
Can we interrogate her?

744
01:22:23,055 --> 01:22:25,182
Didn't you find any
other way to avenge me?

745
01:22:26,058 --> 01:22:27,252
l didn't get you.

746
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:30,752
What is this?

747
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:35,767
- lt's my job. - Since when have
you started maligning other?

748
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:39,299
Look Abhimanyu, l don't
find any pleasure in doing so.

749
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:42,532
Everyone says that the
police is helpless and weak.

750
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:49,309
Wish l could get once
chance to prove ourselves.

751
01:22:49,415 --> 01:22:51,076
l will do all what l can.

752
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:54,983
l will surely tell the police
if l get any news about Bunty.

753
01:23:26,118 --> 01:23:28,746
- Greetings! - Greetings!

754
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:34,348
Look, this time
we have a huge rally.

755
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:37,762
We will knock
over the opposition.

756
01:23:37,863 --> 01:23:39,228
We will spend
any amount of money.

757
01:23:40,132 --> 01:23:45,228
But the crowd
shouldn't be less than 10 lakhs.

758
01:23:45,337 --> 01:23:48,738
Of course. l will
handle the women's wing.

759
01:23:50,142 --> 01:23:52,041
This time, give some
responsibility to Bunty too.

760
01:23:52,144 --> 01:23:54,772
What are you saying, Rameshwari!

761
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,405
Should l give him
a responsibility?!

762
01:23:57,516 --> 01:23:58,710
That too of my rally?

763
01:23:59,751 --> 01:24:01,218
He has spoiled his own image.

764
01:24:02,421 --> 01:24:05,549
Bunty, didn't you
find anyone else?

765
01:24:05,657 --> 01:24:07,522
You found an
lAS's wife, of all?!

766
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,852
Do you want me to lose?

767
01:24:10,429 --> 01:24:12,420
Sir, don't underestimate him.

768
01:24:12,531 --> 01:24:15,125
He alone can gather a
big crowd for the rally.

769
01:24:15,434 --> 01:24:17,561
Give me the responsibility
of the youth wing.

770
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:18,727
And see what l can do.

771
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:24,406
Alright. But use
your brains and be alert.

772
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,070
We must give a strong blow
to the opposition this time.

773
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:28,806
Think over it.

774
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:32,416
Don't forget that
after the interview,...

775
01:24:32,518 --> 01:24:35,419
... this fact of your
life will be known to all.

776
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:40,722
And perhaps you are forgetting
how it might affect this child.

777
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,088
l've called you here
after thinking about all this.

778
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:48,391
l don't want this to
happen to someone else.

779
01:24:52,471 --> 01:24:55,598
Alright. lf you insist,
it will be so.

780
01:24:57,476 --> 01:24:58,442
l'll see.

781
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,847
- Who is it, Reena? - lt's me.

782
01:25:11,657 --> 01:25:13,921
You?! How come you're here?

783
01:25:14,226 --> 01:25:18,128
l was passing by. So l thought
l must take a gift for Sana.

784
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:21,458
- Go inside,
dear. - Okay, mummy.

785
01:25:22,501 --> 01:25:26,494
- Meet her. She is Reena.
- We've met before.

786
01:25:27,506 --> 01:25:29,940
You sit down.
l'll get tea for you.

787
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:31,937
No, thanks. Some other time.

788
01:25:32,244 --> 01:25:33,677
l have to go on duty.

789
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:36,543
Once l had paid a very big
price for going late on duty.

790
01:25:38,517 --> 01:25:40,144
l take your leave.

791
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:46,817
Since when do you know him?

792
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:49,956
Since two years.

793
01:25:50,529 --> 01:25:52,497
You love him a lot, don't you?

794
01:25:55,534 --> 01:25:57,695
l don't know what
happened between you too.

795
01:25:57,803 --> 01:25:59,964
And neither do l want to know.

796
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:05,635
All l would say is,
never lose your love.

797
01:26:05,877 --> 01:26:09,677
Please come,
Mr.Brijbhushan, This file ...

798
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:11,516
Please ...

799
01:26:12,718 --> 01:26:15,186
- This is your
naxalites file? - Yes, sir.

800
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:18,848
How many are real
and how many are fake?

801
01:26:20,559 --> 01:26:22,527
l didn't get you, sir.

802
01:26:24,496 --> 01:26:29,195
Within the next 24 hours, l want
a file of naxalites situation.

803
01:26:29,401 --> 01:26:31,197
And that too, real.

804
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:34,697
Or l will have to find another
method to make you understand.

805
01:26:35,574 --> 01:26:38,701
Alright, sir. May
l take this file?

806
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,005
Why not? Sure.

807
01:26:43,582 --> 01:26:45,607
What are you doing, sir?

808
01:26:48,587 --> 01:26:50,919
What you did with
Vishwanath Prasad's FlR.

809
01:26:52,591 --> 01:26:54,456
You must have surely
heard this name before.

810
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:58,654
No, sir. l have never
heard this name before.

811
01:26:58,764 --> 01:27:01,289
Mr.Vishwanath
Prasad was an lAS officer.

812
01:27:01,433 --> 01:27:03,367
Who committed suicide.

813
01:27:03,935 --> 01:27:06,267
Because his wife was raped.

814
01:27:07,372 --> 01:27:10,899
When he registered
an FlR, you torn it.

815
01:27:11,777 --> 01:27:13,904
You are accusing me, sir.

816
01:27:14,613 --> 01:27:17,411
Vishwanath Prasad
did not register an FlR.

817
01:27:20,786 --> 01:27:22,845
This means you knew him?

818
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:27,991
Mr.Brijbhushan, a
man committed suicide.

819
01:27:30,562 --> 01:27:33,588
As he didn't get
justice because of you.

820
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:40,063
l have taken a pledge
that l will complete his task.

821
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:44,999
l have heard that you
have hidden a lot of reality.

822
01:27:45,811 --> 01:27:50,009
lf you hide the truth of
Vishwanath Prasad's death,...

823
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:53,277
... l will compel
you to reveal it.

824
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:58,080
Look dear, you have
to look after Sana.

825
01:28:00,826 --> 01:28:02,794
But this is not right.

826
01:28:03,628 --> 01:28:05,596
First get control of yourself.

827
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:15,637
Why don't you join the
ashram and help me in the work?

828
01:28:17,676 --> 01:28:20,645
Because it will
divert your mind, ...

829
01:28:20,746 --> 01:28:23,112
... and even Sana
will feel better.

830
01:28:23,415 --> 01:28:24,973
Right, dear?

831
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,982
- Mummy, what is that?
- That is ...

832
01:28:28,687 --> 01:28:30,052
l'll tell you.

833
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:34,648
lf someone is in trouble,
and he ring this bell,...

834
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,321
... all the people of
the ashram come to help him.

835
01:28:39,698 --> 01:28:41,325
- Understand? - Yes.

836
01:28:41,433 --> 01:28:44,334
- Now l take your leave. - Okay.

837
01:28:46,872 --> 01:28:50,330
Reena, can l give you a lift?

838
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:52,634
Alright.

839
01:28:52,878 --> 01:28:54,902
l take your leave.

840
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,152
Since when are you here?

841
01:29:03,889 --> 01:29:05,356
Since a week.

842
01:29:06,892 --> 01:29:10,452
After that incident,
you never phoned me.

843
01:29:12,898 --> 01:29:14,365
l didn't have the courage.

844
01:29:15,734 --> 01:29:18,703
Do you still hold
yourself responsibility?

845
01:29:18,804 --> 01:29:20,499
No need to blame anybody.

846
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,700
What happens, is fate.

847
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,744
And our meeting again?

848
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,571
Even that is fate.

849
01:29:37,489 --> 01:29:38,888
What happened?

850
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:45,188
For whatever
happened between us.

851
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:16,760
''With the
swaying of your veil...''

852
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:19,456
''...my heart flutters with joy''

853
01:30:29,808 --> 01:30:31,776
''And when that happens...''

854
01:30:31,877 --> 01:30:34,937
''...the feeling
is rather strange''

855
01:30:35,814 --> 01:30:38,783
''Before l met you...''

856
01:30:38,884 --> 01:30:42,251
''... l wasn't crazy''

857
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:55,791
''With the swaying of my veil...''

858
01:30:55,901 --> 01:30:57,960
''... my heart flutters with joy''

859
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:00,799
''And when that happens...''

860
01:31:00,906 --> 01:31:03,466
''... the feeling
is rather strange''

861
01:31:03,575 --> 01:31:06,544
''Before l met you...''

862
01:31:06,645 --> 01:31:10,137
''... l wasn't crazy''

863
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:33,167
''Your silence...
it speaks volumes''

864
01:31:34,606 --> 01:31:39,168
''l'm now in a state of ecstasy''

865
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:42,837
''The moment we met''

866
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:44,916
''Love blossomed''

867
01:31:45,016 --> 01:31:50,750
''All distances are
bridged in a moment''

868
01:31:56,861 --> 01:31:59,260
''With the tinkle
of your bangles...''

869
01:31:59,364 --> 01:32:01,525
''... my heart flutters with joy''

870
01:32:01,633 --> 01:32:04,067
''And when that happens...''

871
01:32:04,169 --> 01:32:06,865
''lt's a strange feeling''

872
01:32:06,972 --> 01:32:09,873
''Before l met you...''

873
01:32:09,975 --> 01:32:13,570
''... l wasn't crazy''

874
01:32:50,682 --> 01:32:55,085
''l feel so restless without you''

875
01:32:55,954 --> 01:32:58,923
''Time seems endless...''

876
01:32:59,024 --> 01:33:01,083
''... without you''

877
01:33:01,192 --> 01:33:04,093
''Wherever l look...''

878
01:33:04,195 --> 01:33:06,389
''lt's your visage that l see''

879
01:33:06,698 --> 01:33:22,604
''You are my life...
O sweetheart''

880
01:33:36,461 --> 01:33:38,122
l'll leave now.

881
01:33:56,848 --> 01:33:57,974
Bunty...

882
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:03,917
She's the same girl
who's been writing against us.

883
01:34:04,022 --> 01:34:05,455
Shall we fix her tonight?

884
01:34:06,024 --> 01:34:08,151
l'll teach her a lesson !

885
01:34:25,376 --> 01:34:27,469
- You? - Yes...

886
01:34:29,147 --> 01:34:31,980
You thought your pen
can rebel against the sword?

887
01:34:33,218 --> 01:34:38,155
This beautiful face of yours...
l'll make you ugly!

888
01:34:39,057 --> 01:34:40,684
Better be silent!

889
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:43,022
Else l'll
disfigure you in a manner...

890
01:34:43,128 --> 01:34:45,688
... that not even your
relatives recognise you.

891
01:34:45,797 --> 01:34:48,697
Remember that... l'll leave now.

892
01:34:51,069 --> 01:34:52,696
Are you sure that he was Bunty?

893
01:34:52,804 --> 01:34:54,931
How can l forget him?

894
01:34:56,074 --> 01:34:58,508
That means he must be
somewhere around here.

895
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,937
Block all entry
and exits of the city.

896
01:35:04,816 --> 01:35:06,181
He shouldn't escape this time.

897
01:35:10,088 --> 01:35:12,715
You be here with Madam.

898
01:35:12,824 --> 01:35:15,724
He'll be here with you.
You need not worry.

899
01:35:16,094 --> 01:35:17,527
But where are you going?

900
01:35:20,265 --> 01:35:22,961
They've been flaunting
their power since a long time.

901
01:35:24,269 --> 01:35:26,533
Now let me use my power!

902
01:35:33,278 --> 01:35:36,907
Brijbhushan is
filling his pockets nowadays.

903
01:35:45,123 --> 01:35:47,420
Hey... he's coming here.
What's the matter?

904
01:35:48,293 --> 01:35:50,920
- Where's Bunty?
- We don't know.

905
01:35:51,029 --> 01:35:52,087
Don't you know?

906
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:56,099
Where's Bunty?

907
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:58,226
- l don't know. -
Don't you know either?

908
01:35:59,137 --> 01:36:00,103
C'mon... tell me.

909
01:36:00,872 --> 01:36:02,931
What are you doing? l
have contacts with the CM?

910
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:06,101
- With the Chief Minister?
- Yes... l'll call him now.

911
01:36:06,477 --> 01:36:08,911
Hey you... you
threw away my cell!

912
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,242
- Have you gone crazy?
- Tell me.. where's Bunty?

913
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:12,782
- l don't know.
- Don't you know?

914
01:36:17,155 --> 01:36:19,384
- Don't you know?
- No... l don't.

915
01:36:20,892 --> 01:36:22,120
- Where's Bunty? - l don't know.

916
01:36:22,227 --> 01:36:26,220
Okay... l'll send you to the CM!

917
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:27,457
l'll tell you.

918
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:54,351
There are two
ways to go out of here.

919
01:36:54,926 --> 01:36:59,989
Either to the hospital...
or with me.

920
01:37:00,198 --> 01:37:01,631
l give you two seconds time.

921
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:13,837
- And after two seconds...
- l'll come with you.

922
01:37:17,048 --> 01:37:20,505
Stay in your limits.
Don't underestimate me!

923
01:37:20,618 --> 01:37:22,245
What's the commotion out there?

924
01:37:22,353 --> 01:37:24,184
Who's there? Oh ... Abhimanyu !

925
01:37:26,224 --> 01:37:28,852
- What are you doing?
- Tell him who l am!

926
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,188
- Lock him up. - Sir,
how can l do that?

927
01:37:30,295 --> 01:37:31,193
Put him behind the bars.

928
01:37:31,296 --> 01:37:33,196
Sir, l can't do that.

929
01:37:37,635 --> 01:37:39,535
Don't just stand there.
Put him behind the bars.

930
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:42,866
But how can l do that?

931
01:37:43,574 --> 01:37:45,666
- He's Bunty. - Are you scared?

932
01:37:46,978 --> 01:37:49,879
Then fine... l'll do it myself.

933
01:37:50,982 --> 01:37:53,883
Come on... come on l said!

934
01:37:53,985 --> 01:37:57,887
- Tell him... who l am! -
Get inside. - l'll fix you !

935
01:38:01,092 --> 01:38:04,061
Hey you... proud of
your position, is it?

936
01:38:05,163 --> 01:38:07,892
Your position and your life...
l'll wreck both !

937
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:25,215
You swine! Come on !

938
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:30,253
l'll not spare you. Come on !

939
01:38:31,356 --> 01:38:32,914
Let me out!

940
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:54,943
Bunty... you are dead!

941
01:39:11,162 --> 01:39:12,595
Sir... please stop. He'll die.

942
01:39:13,164 --> 01:39:15,688
No problem,
Sir. You can proceed.

943
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:47,991
Sir.. that's enough.
Forgive him, sir.

944
01:39:49,367 --> 01:39:50,425
Move ... Move l said!

945
01:39:53,104 --> 01:39:54,662
Sorry... l can't
get beaten up for you.

946
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:05,406
Don't consider our
silence as our helplessness.

947
01:40:05,516 --> 01:40:09,474
The politicians are
no match for the Police.

948
01:40:10,121 --> 01:40:12,351
l'm a diligent officer...

949
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:15,521
... l'll do
justice even if l die.

950
01:40:40,418 --> 01:40:41,384
Read this.

951
01:40:48,426 --> 01:40:50,394
Do you remember
what l had once said?

952
01:40:50,495 --> 01:40:52,861
That their victory
will be shortlived.

953
01:40:53,164 --> 01:40:56,065
This is my first step.

954
01:40:57,268 --> 01:40:59,395
Hadn't you been here...

955
01:40:59,504 --> 01:41:01,335
... this wouldn't
have been possible.

956
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:03,464
l've just done my duty.

957
01:41:04,175 --> 01:41:06,405
Once the law
fulfills its duty...

958
01:41:06,511 --> 01:41:08,877
You will get justice.

959
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,479
Abhimanyu, where are you?

960
01:41:14,452 --> 01:41:16,079
Some goons have held me captive.

961
01:41:16,187 --> 01:41:17,518
Please come soon.

962
01:41:36,474 --> 01:41:39,534
Where are those goons?
Are you alright?

963
01:41:40,478 --> 01:41:44,676
- Tell me, Rina.
- l was just joking.

964
01:41:45,483 --> 01:41:48,111
What kind of a joke is this?

965
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,116
l don't like such pranks.

966
01:41:51,222 --> 01:41:53,554
Did l annoy you?

967
01:41:53,658 --> 01:41:57,719
Didn't you once think
that l'll be so tense?

968
01:42:50,715 --> 01:42:55,209
''Looking into
your eyes... is love''

969
01:42:56,554 --> 01:43:01,184
''Your bashful look... it's love''

970
01:43:02,727 --> 01:43:08,597
''You can find it
for yourself, my love''

971
01:43:15,573 --> 01:43:20,203
''This feeling of
oneness...it's love''

972
01:43:21,579 --> 01:43:26,539
''Coming closer... it's love''

973
01:43:27,318 --> 01:43:32,722
''You can find it
for yourself, my love''

974
01:43:39,597 --> 01:43:43,556
''Tormenting me
like this... it's love''

975
01:44:23,374 --> 01:44:28,869
''Your charms...
have made me crazy''

976
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:35,282
''My restless heart...
craves for you''

977
01:44:38,823 --> 01:44:44,853
''Don't give me
that obsessed look''

978
01:44:44,962 --> 01:44:50,798
''Wonder why l'm
scared of this obsession''

979
01:44:53,838 --> 01:44:58,639
''Giving such excuses... is love''

980
01:44:58,743 --> 01:45:04,545
''The falling of
your tresses... is love''

981
01:46:17,755 --> 01:46:19,620
Take proper care of him.

982
01:46:22,927 --> 01:46:25,394
He's taking
advantage these days.

983
01:46:25,496 --> 01:46:27,896
We'll have to
make him understand.

984
01:46:27,998 --> 01:46:30,625
Look at him... how
majestic his stride is!

985
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:34,397
Welcome, Mr.Sohan.

986
01:46:35,105 --> 01:46:36,401
Please have a seat.

987
01:46:43,781 --> 01:46:46,909
- Won't you serve him tea?
- Get tea for him.

988
01:46:47,785 --> 01:46:53,485
So... tell me...
How's our rule faring?

989
01:46:53,591 --> 01:46:55,718
What can l say?

990
01:46:56,527 --> 01:46:58,620
Our own men are
maligning our image.

991
01:46:58,963 --> 01:47:01,431
Don't talk in riddles.

992
01:47:01,532 --> 01:47:05,764
- l hope l don't offend you.
- What's the matter?

993
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:09,704
What can l say...
Our very own Mr.Sohan...

994
01:47:09,807 --> 01:47:12,241
... he's been
raking money these days.

995
01:47:12,643 --> 01:47:15,771
- That's a lie. - l
told you, you'll be offended,

996
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,939
lt's nothing of that sort.

997
01:47:18,048 --> 01:47:20,107
Don't you know that
he's one of my special man?

998
01:47:20,818 --> 01:47:22,513
You should apologise.

999
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:27,922
Apologise? And
that too ... to him?

1000
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:30,789
Ask him... whether he
has not been demanding ...

1001
01:47:30,895 --> 01:47:33,455
... bribes in your name?

1002
01:47:33,998 --> 01:47:37,626
What's this,
Mr.Sohan? ls this the truth?

1003
01:47:39,837 --> 01:47:41,464
This time it was a bigger loot!

1004
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:44,097
Don't you want to
continue being a minister?

1005
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:47,540
lf not... then please leave.
And you accompany him.

1006
01:47:47,645 --> 01:47:49,806
Bring half the money
he has earned till now.

1007
01:47:49,914 --> 01:47:51,973
Else get his resignation.

1008
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:55,284
Please go.

1009
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,817
Okay... go.

1010
01:47:58,856 --> 01:48:01,825
After hearing the
arguments of both the Defence...

1011
01:48:01,926 --> 01:48:04,827
... and the Public Prosecutor,
the court has reached...

1012
01:48:04,929 --> 01:48:07,830
... the decision that the
accused and his mother...

1013
01:48:07,932 --> 01:48:09,490
... Rameshwari are not guilty.

1014
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,828
The Public Prosecutor
has failed to present...

1015
01:48:10,935 --> 01:48:13,301
... the requisite
evidence in the court.

1016
01:48:13,604 --> 01:48:17,506
And so the court acquits them.

1017
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:20,002
l could do nothing.

1018
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,177
Please forgive me.

1019
01:48:26,884 --> 01:48:29,318
l couldn't get him punished.

1020
01:48:51,742 --> 01:48:53,539
We were so happy.

1021
01:48:55,913 --> 01:48:57,540
Everything is lost.

1022
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,547
We have failed.

1023
01:49:08,926 --> 01:49:10,894
Till this world exists...

1024
01:49:10,995 --> 01:49:12,860
Bunty, your name will thrive.

1025
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:14,897
The people greeted me
with these slogans...

1026
01:49:14,999 --> 01:49:17,058
... after l was acquitted.

1027
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:19,294
But it's the truth...
l raped her.

1028
01:49:19,403 --> 01:49:20,893
ln spite of that people
are showering praises on us.

1029
01:49:21,005 --> 01:49:23,906
Because l am the uncrowned king.

1030
01:49:24,074 --> 01:49:26,565
They should put
some benches here.

1031
01:49:26,944 --> 01:49:29,310
My legs are aching now.

1032
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,170
Okay.

1033
01:50:01,311 --> 01:50:03,404
Should we accept
defeat and do nothing?

1034
01:50:04,982 --> 01:50:06,279
ls that what you want to say?

1035
01:50:07,718 --> 01:50:11,620
l have decided to
resign from service.

1036
01:50:15,726 --> 01:50:17,625
l can't resign.

1037
01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:21,630
- l'm not a coward. -
Neither am l, Mr.Singh.

1038
01:50:22,332 --> 01:50:24,960
lf l can't fulfill
my duty... so be it.

1039
01:50:25,069 --> 01:50:27,037
But l can't support injustice.

1040
01:50:28,405 --> 01:50:32,170
As it is l'm no
longer interested.

1041
01:50:32,276 --> 01:50:34,210
There's no need to do that.

1042
01:50:37,314 --> 01:50:39,305
Take this page from
Bunty's personal diary.

1043
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:43,443
He has written
that he raped Kunti.

1044
01:50:43,754 --> 01:50:46,245
What? What are you saying?

1045
01:50:46,356 --> 01:50:48,983
This is the truth. l
just submitted the diary...

1046
01:50:49,093 --> 01:50:51,084
... in the Police Headquarters.

1047
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:54,128
You can arrest Bunty now.

1048
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:04,132
That diary is our last resort.

1049
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:05,833
To arrest Bunty.

1050
01:51:05,943 --> 01:51:07,808
This is a day to celebrate.

1051
01:51:09,046 --> 01:51:12,015
The good news is that a
book has been written...

1052
01:51:12,116 --> 01:51:16,109
... on our
Respected CM, Chandramohan.

1053
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:18,017
The book will enlighten...

1054
01:51:18,122 --> 01:51:21,421
... you on his
charismatic personality.

1055
01:51:22,226 --> 01:51:24,353
l'll now request him to...

1056
01:51:25,395 --> 01:51:27,022
... release this book.

1057
01:51:35,072 --> 01:51:39,031
Long live Chandramohan.

1058
01:51:39,143 --> 01:51:42,112
l greet the masses
who are present here.

1059
01:51:44,348 --> 01:51:49,047
l would like to tell you that
Bunty is the son of a lady...

1060
01:51:49,153 --> 01:51:53,146
... who is a
renowned social activist.

1061
01:51:53,257 --> 01:51:57,887
This book is an
achievement for him.

1062
01:51:59,096 --> 01:52:04,294
So let him tell us...
what he has written about me.

1063
01:52:04,401 --> 01:52:09,862
Come on Bunty, tell us... what
you've written in this book.

1064
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:13,036
Long live Bunty.

1065
01:52:13,944 --> 01:52:15,468
My dear friends...

1066
01:52:15,579 --> 01:52:18,070
Greetings to all. lt
doesn't seem appropriate...

1067
01:52:18,182 --> 01:52:22,277
... to talk much in the presence
of such dignified audience.

1068
01:52:22,386 --> 01:52:26,186
But l would just
request you to read my book.

1069
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:31,788
Especially about his sincerity.

1070
01:52:31,895 --> 01:52:34,557
- We can't arrest
him now. - Yes Sir.

1071
01:52:44,141 --> 01:52:45,937
l have an arrest
warrant for both of you.

1072
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:50,506
- Sir, there's a call
from Delhi. - From Delhi?

1073
01:52:54,151 --> 01:52:58,519
Mr.Pradhan, you were
instructed to arrest Rameshwari.

1074
01:53:00,157 --> 01:53:04,457
The Government is in danger.
You know it's a coalition.

1075
01:53:04,561 --> 01:53:06,960
- But Sir... - l
don't want to hear anything.

1076
01:53:07,064 --> 01:53:10,158
Just follow my instructions.
You won't take any action.

1077
01:53:11,902 --> 01:53:13,130
We can't arrest them now.

1078
01:53:13,904 --> 01:53:15,496
- But why not? - We have orders.

1079
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:19,607
We have the evidence, Sir.

1080
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:24,108
- l've been called back to
Delhi. - What's the matter?

1081
01:53:25,182 --> 01:53:27,173
lf you have the
arrest warrant...

1082
01:53:27,284 --> 01:53:29,047
... then why
didn't you arrest them?

1083
01:53:30,187 --> 01:53:32,621
Yes... we can't arrest them.

1084
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:35,157
They say that the
government will topple.

1085
01:53:35,259 --> 01:53:36,817
The Government is in danger.

1086
01:53:36,927 --> 01:53:38,826
Let the Government topple.

1087
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:41,861
We are just left as zombies!

1088
01:53:41,965 --> 01:53:44,832
- Let's take their statements.
- The police had a warrant...

1089
01:53:44,935 --> 01:53:51,204
... any comments?
- They are baseless allegations.

1090
01:53:51,308 --> 01:53:52,900
lt's a conspiracy against us.

1091
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,001
They are trying to defame us.

1092
01:53:55,112 --> 01:53:58,172
But we are not scared.
We'll just serve the people.

1093
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:03,351
Why are you troubling
such a respectable lady?

1094
01:54:05,222 --> 01:54:07,190
Ask your mother...
will a mother ever help...

1095
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:09,521
... her son to rape someone?

1096
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,222
And tell me... who said
that the lady was raped?

1097
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:16,424
And even if that's the truth...
had you been there?

1098
01:54:17,234 --> 01:54:18,201
Let's go.

1099
01:54:19,236 --> 01:54:20,532
We've got a good headline.

1100
01:54:34,985 --> 01:54:35,883
l'm sorry...

1101
01:54:38,255 --> 01:54:40,223
ln this battle of
the good and the evil...

1102
01:54:40,324 --> 01:54:42,258
... l forgot the
role of the Government.

1103
01:54:45,262 --> 01:54:47,230
l was always
proud of my principles.

1104
01:54:49,433 --> 01:54:53,233
But today l want
to say something.

1105
01:54:55,272 --> 01:54:57,240
Get justice for yourself.

1106
01:54:58,942 --> 01:55:01,376
There are many ways
of attaining victory.

1107
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:03,712
You too find a way for yourself.

1108
01:55:06,283 --> 01:55:08,410
Take the law in your hands.

1109
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:12,486
Yes... l'm telling you this.

1110
01:55:13,123 --> 01:55:16,580
l'll be with you.

1111
01:55:26,036 --> 01:55:30,268
When the law
fails to help you...

1112
01:55:30,374 --> 01:55:34,401
... only you can
fight for yourself.

1113
01:55:37,047 --> 01:55:40,174
We'll unite and use
that power of ours.

1114
01:55:45,055 --> 01:55:47,455
Abhimanyu, this
is very dangerous.

1115
01:55:49,559 --> 01:55:51,459
l'm prepared for everything.

1116
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:56,322
But before doing anything
l'll have to talk to my Editor.

1117
01:55:57,167 --> 01:55:59,692
Do it fast... We
are running out of time.

1118
01:56:07,344 --> 01:56:09,335
Hello Sir, Reena here.

1119
01:56:09,446 --> 01:56:13,314
- Yes tell me. - Sir, l
want your permission to publish...

1120
01:56:13,417 --> 01:56:15,578
...a news which is against
the ethics of journalism.

1121
01:56:15,685 --> 01:56:17,653
Against the ethics? What's it?

1122
01:56:18,088 --> 01:56:19,554
This is not right.

1123
01:56:22,192 --> 01:56:24,660
But you are responsible for it.

1124
01:56:31,368 --> 01:56:33,029
Kunti, Reena here.

1125
01:56:34,104 --> 01:56:36,470
We have decided that...

1126
01:57:02,866 --> 01:57:04,356
How can l forget you?

1127
01:57:06,403 --> 01:57:08,030
Tell me... what
made you call me?

1128
01:57:11,241 --> 01:57:12,708
When do you want
to meet? Tell me.

1129
01:57:29,426 --> 01:57:31,394
What's it? l'm sleeping.

1130
01:57:32,429 --> 01:57:34,124
Say that l'm sleeping.

1131
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:36,062
lt's the CM's call.

1132
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,364
What's happening?

1133
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,632
Will Bunty
topple our Government?

1134
01:57:44,274 --> 01:57:46,401
What has he done now?

1135
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:48,876
Everything is ruined...
and she knows nothing.

1136
01:57:49,179 --> 01:57:51,511
Didn't you read the newspapers?

1137
01:57:51,615 --> 01:57:54,344
Ask Bunty to stop his escapades.

1138
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:56,316
How long can we keep saving him?

1139
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:05,087
Bunty will rape Kunti again.

1140
01:58:06,296 --> 01:58:07,763
Sukhiya, where's Bunty?

1141
01:58:19,476 --> 01:58:20,772
She's just a child.

1142
01:58:25,482 --> 01:58:27,450
Come in.

1143
01:58:36,226 --> 01:58:38,250
You seem to be in
great mood today.

1144
01:58:39,663 --> 01:58:40,789
What are you doing?

1145
01:58:41,498 --> 01:58:43,795
What are you doing?

1146
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:46,197
Everything
happened so soon last time.

1147
01:58:46,503 --> 01:58:48,494
Today... we'll be at leisure!

1148
01:59:00,517 --> 01:59:01,950
What are you doing?

1149
01:59:07,357 --> 01:59:08,688
What are you doing?

1150
01:59:11,528 --> 01:59:14,656
Something... which l
should have done long back.

1151
01:59:34,718 --> 01:59:36,481
Leave me, you swine!

1152
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:38,178
Oh... so was
This your intention.

1153
01:59:38,288 --> 01:59:40,187
Now l'll fix you !

1154
01:59:42,559 --> 01:59:45,426
l won't spare you today!

1155
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:09,380
What happened, child?

1156
02:00:09,486 --> 02:00:11,852
- Mummy... - Let's go.

1157
02:00:12,322 --> 02:00:13,220
You scoundrel!

1158
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:17,555
Beat him up!

1159
02:00:32,442 --> 02:00:34,569
''She is the Mother Earth...
She is the generous sky...''

1160
02:00:34,678 --> 02:00:37,010
''... she is the universe.''

1161
02:00:37,347 --> 02:00:38,575
''She is the Supreme Power...''

1162
02:00:38,682 --> 02:00:40,706
''She is the
vanquisher of the evil.''

1163
02:00:40,817 --> 02:00:43,285
- Please forgive me!
- Should l forgive you?

1164
02:00:43,386 --> 02:00:45,581
Beat him!

1165
02:00:57,367 --> 02:00:59,597
Don't spare him... Kill him!

1166
02:01:31,668 --> 02:01:33,067
Catch her!

1167
02:01:34,504 --> 02:01:36,631
Look at her audacity!
She herself called me.

1168
02:01:36,740 --> 02:01:38,799
And then she attacked me!

1169
02:01:38,908 --> 02:01:41,638
l should have killed you ...

1170
02:01:41,745 --> 02:01:44,805
... the day l had raped you.

1171
02:01:44,914 --> 02:01:47,906
l will kill you !

1172
02:01:48,418 --> 02:01:51,648
Your fate will be such
that no one from your family...

1173
02:01:51,755 --> 02:01:52,722
... will ever crave for a son.

1174
02:01:52,822 --> 02:01:55,655
Take this! Bring her here.

1175
02:01:56,426 --> 02:01:58,326
Today the world
will see the fun !

1176
02:01:59,696 --> 02:02:02,665
Bloody woman !
What did you think?

1177
02:02:05,535 --> 02:02:08,059
You were shouting a lot!

1178
02:02:08,438 --> 02:02:11,669
Now wait and watch the fun !
Let them be a witness!

1179
02:02:11,775 --> 02:02:14,937
But son...what
shall we do with her?

1180
02:02:15,044 --> 02:02:19,071
- lt's a free show
for you. - Free show?

1181
02:02:19,182 --> 02:02:21,343
Now what's that, Bunty?

1182
02:02:21,451 --> 02:02:24,011
Don't you know? You
don't know it either?

1183
02:02:26,456 --> 02:02:30,586
Please Kunti, my men
want free entertainment.

1184
02:02:30,693 --> 02:02:32,024
Will you help me?

1185
02:02:35,565 --> 02:02:38,625
You want free entertainment,
don't you?

1186
02:02:39,068 --> 02:02:41,696
Then see this...
when you see this ...

1187
02:02:41,805 --> 02:02:45,172
... think of your mother.

1188
02:02:45,475 --> 02:02:49,172
The mother who made
you such an evil man.

1189
02:02:49,746 --> 02:02:52,715
lt's not your fault...
it's the fault...

1190
02:02:52,816 --> 02:02:56,376
... of your upbringing,
which has made you evil!

1191
02:02:57,487 --> 02:03:00,183
Go and ask your mother...

1192
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:02,389
... the secret of your birth !

1193
02:03:04,494 --> 02:03:06,655
l'll strip off your clothes!

1194
02:03:07,497 --> 02:03:09,965
Oh yes... what else can you do?

1195
02:03:11,501 --> 02:03:15,028
You stripped me
naked even that day.

1196
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:20,067
But today you'll see my powers.

1197
02:03:20,476 --> 02:03:23,570
Stop! Enough of these words now!

1198
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:25,875
Now's the time for action !

1199
02:03:40,797 --> 02:03:42,696
You swine! You are here again !

1200
02:03:42,799 --> 02:03:45,427
A single call ... is
enough to get him dismissed!

1201
02:03:48,805 --> 02:03:51,433
lt seems you've forgotten the
thrashing l gave you last time.

politician can strip!

''Since ages the women have
proved their might against them''

Who will take the
responsibility if they die?

We are just the keepers of law.

You can do anything.

She'll kill him and the
lnspector isn't doing anything.

1248
02:09:29,212 --> 02:09:35,276
- l can't hear you. - Can
you hear me? Rameshwari here.

1249
02:09:35,885 --> 02:09:39,286

Please forgive me.

1253
02:10:05,915 --> 02:10:09,817
You'll have to
apologise to so many.

1254
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:13,946
You ruined my life.

1255
02:10:14,056 --> 02:10:15,580
Shall l forgive you for that?

1256
02:10:16,959 --> 02:10:19,325
Tell me! My husband committed
suicide because of you !

1257
02:10:20,429 --> 02:10:21,828
Should l forgive you for that?

1258
02:10:41,384 --> 02:10:47,516
Today you'll have to
confess all your crimes.

1259
02:10:49,225 --> 02:10:51,193
Tell them!

1260
02:10:51,294 --> 02:10:53,285

l have sinned!

1264
02:11:08,477 --> 02:11:11,571
l was the one who raped Kunti!

1265
02:11:36,605 --> 02:11:40,062
l will not spare him.
He killed my husband.

1266
02:11:40,176 --> 02:11:43,236
No Kunti... it
was his Principle...

1267
02:11:43,346 --> 02:11:45,438
... the law will
punish the criminal.

1268
02:11:46,682 --> 02:11:48,581
He will languish in
the jail all his life.

1269
02:11:48,684 --> 02:11:51,244
That's his punishment.

1270
02:11:57,626 --> 02:11:58,558
Come on.

1271
02:12:17,146 --> 02:12:21,446
''She's the epitome
of love and affection''

1272
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:25,611
''Pay obeisance to Her''

1273
02:12:26,155 --> 02:12:31,286
''The one who
dares to dishonor her''

1274
02:12:31,394 --> 02:12:35,660
''Kill him... kill
that brutal sinner!''

1275
02:12:58,187 --> 02:12:59,552
God bless you, child.

1276
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:03,317
l need your
blessings so that ...

1277
02:13:03,426 --> 02:13:06,122
... these moments of
suffering never come back.

1278
02:13:08,364 --> 02:13:12,322
l can just pray for you so
that not even the memories...

1279
02:13:12,435 --> 02:13:15,029
... of all those
experiences torment you.

1280
02:13:17,206 --> 02:13:22,371
And yes... give
this child a good future.

1281
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:26,439
- You both are
leaving tomorrow? - Yes.

02:13:27,383 --> 02:13:28,748
- Yes... tomorrow morning.

We owe our
relationship to you too.

02:13:35,391 --> 02:13:38,826
And do tell us if
you need our help.

1285
02:13:40,396 --> 02:13:42,364
- Won't you? - Yes Uncle.

1286
02:13:42,565 --> 02:13:43,361
Okay.
