00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,860
Kids, ride carefully

5
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,872
lnstead of constructing an airport
can't they repair all this roads?

6
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,238
Then after that they
will start a 'toll' on this road

7
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,869
Even other wise people can't use
roads because of toll - That's true

8
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:52,245
Man, people are squeezed is it?
How can an ordinary person live here?

9
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,786
Are we ordinary people? - No man,
you are 'Tata' and l'm 'Birla'!

10
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,082
How is it?
We'll become one, man - Yes, yes

11
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,349
You wait and see

12
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:07,356

Slowly, slowly, give it

15
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,370
l'm also a kid lady, Madhavan
kutty - Then what a kid?

16
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,912
Child did you like it? - Give one to me
Reduce the sugar and come

17
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,881
Didn't get the small one, over
there only this size was available

18
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,109
That is okay man

19
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,344
Hey Sheela, go and
make tea forthem

20
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,387
No need Sheela, has
got a trip to Chalakudy

21
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,657
ls it so? Then take one from this

22
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,918
Have made for kids 'Unniappam'
(snack made out of rice)

23
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,087
Then what am l? Worthless,
give one to me girl

24
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,898
My Radhachechi will you
give one seat to us in kids care?

25
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,939
The food is good

26
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,275
How is our new business,
it is profitable, no?

27
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,940
No big issue but the expense is
not getting limited to expectations

28
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,245
They give only Rs.500 for one child

29
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,443
While calculating
the expense is more

30
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,779
How is that, the food is grand, is it?

31
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,324
ln the morning milk and Horlicks
Feast in the afternoon

32
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,087
And during the
intervals small nibbles

33
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,457
Will you give some Horlicks?

34
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:18,136
Look it is so true - l'll mix one full
Horlicks and pour into your well, okay

35
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,300
Says it is okay

36
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,964
What a pity!
Did you see?

37
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,303
Then how can you
reduce the expense?

38
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,037
Boy it is a matter of kids, no?
They are coming to our house is it?

39
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,074
Then we should have
some satisfaction, no?

40
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,944
On that how can we
check the expenses?

41
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,712
Then in that case, when kids go
home send one parcel to their homes!

42
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,821
My Radhachechi, when it is a
business, we should check the expenses

43
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,321
Otherwise the company
will end up in loss, no?

44
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:42,156
My Madhavetta, look our case it
was started on a small scale, no?

45
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,162
Now what is the condition?
Has got lakhs of turn over...

46
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,998
What is the reason? Calculations
and accounts are correct

47
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,502
All though we are the managing
directors of the company

48
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,001
But regarding the accounts...

49
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,835
That is the secret of our success
lsn't it Balu?

50
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,143
Why not? - Then we shall
increase the fees, no?

51
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,049
Radhachechi, you increase boldly
when you increase the money -

52
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,381
- firm's grade will also increase

53
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,920
That is the current trend right now

54
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,888
Now itself one or two parties
has asked me whether -

55
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,151
- they can get an
admission over here?

56
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,955
Now a days, day care is of high
demand, you may increase

57
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,868
Madhavetta, what is there
to think like this?

58
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,027
Let Madhavettan, think over it man

59
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,103
You increase it boldly

60
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,203
What is it Madhavetta?
Okay will increase, no?

61
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,403
That is what l said

62
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,549
Hey Radha, didn't you
get the hand-fan?

63
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,788
On which fire- heath is she
sitting? Back of a rice pastel!

64
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,093
Look, coming in a moment, here it is

65
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,558
Hey lady have you checked
whether you have kept -

66
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,025
- that phone properly?

67
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,395
Checked Madhavetta,
that is kept properly

68
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,835
Has it gone out of order?.

69
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,236
No Madhavetta, Sheela
has called Babutten on that

70
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,932
Then why is he not calling me?

71
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,407
Even when the time
has reached this much

72
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,241
Then simply making people tensed
No one here, feed on tension

73
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,607
Rice-gruel is set, come and have it

74
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,408
Side dishes are your favourite, one
which is made of 'horse gram'

75
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,919
l don't want anything, you may have it
- Then we also doesn't want anything

76
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:23,656
Temm DrC

77
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,625
That must be Babutten
'Madhavettan is always...'

78
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,160
'Really always angry'

79
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,270
What is going on here?
No light and all

80
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,364
For that only sir is being called
over here - Okay madam

81
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,177
Madhavetta, what is the complaint?

82
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,472
Hey man, till this time he
has not called over to here

83
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,243
Today, he has not
called that child also

84
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,250
What a pity is this? Just see this

85
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,580
lt has been 3 or4 days
since he had called me

86
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,211
Forthe last 2 days has
not seen on 'WatsApp'

87
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,082
What toddy shop?
Not toddy shop, Madhavetta

88
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,024
'WatsApp' it is new generation

89
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,319
l don't know all this

90
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,997
Now there is no need of
knowing it at an old age

91
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,294
My Babu, you go and check it fast

92
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,338
When she turned on that tube
light, after that everything is gone

93
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,167
Sheela, you may go and
bring one long pole

94
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,304
Girl, no need one
which is made of iron okay

95
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,482
Here

96
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,311
Give it here

97
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,516
No doubt when you turned on
the switch everything was gone

98
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,490
lt is high voltage, no?

99
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,253
When this voltage is
beyond to bear -

100
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,264
- that is why he
has dumped you, no?

101
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,463
Let this poor people
continue living some how

102
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,333
Right now there is at least a
house like this to say own thing

103
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,939
That itself is a big luck

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,701
Girl, l was justjoking, sorry

105
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,374
You light the torch

106
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,067
No doubt in saying -

107
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,703
- girls mind and moonlight during
'Kumbam' (February-March) are same

108
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,548
Which means? - This is the one,
will light and get turned off

109
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,553
Yes it has come
Gone here, when it came there

110
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,317
ls it so?
Will correct it now itself

111
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,526
Where did l poke now?

112
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,427
Goodness, gone!

113
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,589
Madhavetta, if it is kept like
this KSEB people will roast me

114
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,566
Tomorrow l'll come with
line man, then will repair it

115
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,694
Okay that will do

116
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,371
By the way when KSEB people
comes and repairs this line

117
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,065
Our line will be cut is it?

118
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,370
Now that is the reason
why this line gets cut very often

119
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,140
Understood no? Shall l
poke and see once more?

120
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,342
No need KSEB people
will scold come we'll leave

121
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,349
Here is the torch

122
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:40,695
Temm DrC

123
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,431
What is this? Kids are not seen also

124
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,740
Radhachechi!

125
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,340
Going to put the sweet
broth on the fire-heath okay

126
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,074
lf you want to cancel it
you may cancel it right now

127
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,545
There is no use in
saying that later okay

128
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,744
Sheela, anyway you may make the
sweet broth, kids will come for sure

129
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,749
As it is misty they will
be late to get up

130
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,488
What l think is when we increased
the money, they might have stopped

131
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,188
At that time itself l've
told her no need of that

132
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,597
What did Madhavettan say?
Rice-pastel, that is it!

133
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,694
Sheela, did you see this? When
Madhavettan agreed that is why -

134
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,533
- we told them regarding
the money matters?

135
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,574
You also heard that one is it?'
Now he is changing the sides

136
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,270
Do l have to prepare the sweet
broth or not? - You ask that here

137
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,013
You prepare it girl,
kids will come for sure

138
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,508
Sheela, you may take
that umbrella also

139
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:42,184
Madhavan Nair, whatever you say,
we won't send our kids to your day care

140
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,159
Regarding the fees, it is
not at all a concern to us

141
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,458
The reputation of the
firm, that is our main concern

142
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,158
Because of that forthe time being -

143
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,462
- we've shifted them to
an another day care

144
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,629
The day care which is
run by wife of advocate Jose

145
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,140
lf it is over there means, there is
video game and toys and all are present

146
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,643
Then there is round the
clock medical caring also

147
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,645
After coming to Madhavan Nair's
house my kids started to use bad words

148
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,515
Do you know that?
Bad words, from my home?

149
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:12,317
Yes, indeed bad words, do you want
to hear those severe bad words?

150
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:19,020
Temm DrC

151
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,062
The back of rice-pastel!

152
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,871
'Vava's (Child) day care'

153
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,744
l came to know back of the rice
-pastel is such a bad word only today!

154
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,840
What are you saying?
Back of rice-pastel, that's all

155
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,617
Look, just throw this one!

156
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,516
Radhachechi!

157
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,591
What is it girl?
lt was Vinodettan's phone

158
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,855
When l told l'll give to mother, told
no need you just tell the matter

159
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,132
Tell the matter, don't
beat about the bush!

160
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,833
On this month 18th Vinodettan
will reach at the native place

161
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,200
He'll start from there
on 15th evening

162
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,920
Hey girl are you sure that
he has told this month 18th?

163
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,490
Or have you gone
any mistakes on that?

164
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,223
No Madhavetta,
has told this month only

165
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,632
What did l drink liquor here and sit?

166
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,429
My Lord, for the next festival, shall
give you a pot of coins as offering

167
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,197
ls it enough?

On placing side curtains

That money was saved
for my daughters wedding

When asking money there
is no money and the person

215

On the next 18th it is her wedding

227
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,806
Why a rain at a wrong time?

228
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,675
My goodness, l forgot to
keep the fire woods!

229
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,511
Back of rice-pastel, what a shame!

230
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,638
What are you thinking in detail?
No, nothing at all

231
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,833
Simply

232
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,272
As the days are nearing it
seems the time is not at all moving

233
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,144
But still this waiting has
got a pleasure is it not?

234
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,343
That is all there but..

235
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:33,751
All together a tension is mounding
up, some how this 6 days must get over

236
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,792
He should just come and
l need to see him, that's all

237
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,558
Do you remember?
Earlier in a rainy night like this

238
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,224
When he was only seven
months in womb at mid-night

239
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,668
ln the womb when the baby was
not moving, the fright we under went

240
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,034
Asking don't l remember?

241
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,338
At that time, what all offerings
we've made was -

242
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,647
- full filled in the last years festival

243
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,582
While mentioning baby's
zodiac sign an offering was done

244
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,615
He shouldn't have grown up

245
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,688
ls it not Madhavetta?

246
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,051
Always he should
have remained like a child

247
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,854
No matter how big he grows up

248
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,019

dearest baby, is it?

What a foolish thief are you fellow?

285
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,050
Hey buffalo, is it how you steal?

286
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,454
While snatching a
thing from some one

287
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,891
That hand which snatches and god
who has created, other than that

288
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,159
Even the material shouldn't know
that the owner is changed!

289
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,562
That is the dexterity!

290
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,000
Did you see this?

291
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:50,044
Even didn't open it by touching will
know whether it is empty inside or not

292
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,249
That is not the dexterity that
is the experience with work

293
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,254
Come, you come

294
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,258
This robbery is an art

295
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,498
That should be trained under a
master, who is an expert, an art

296
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,427
l'm on rest for some time

297
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,469
Has grown old, is it?

298
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,265
Thought of retiring

299
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,399
Presently in the son in laws eatery
business, remaining as his helper

300
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,970
lf you are interested to learn,
l'll take you to a very good master

301
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,275
Among my disciples
he is the smartest

302
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,079
To learn the profession
he is the best

303
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,581
l mean Benny!

304
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,392
Benny!
Son Benny!

305
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,308
Benny, son hey fellow!

306
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,382
Hey son Benny come on get up!

307
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,509
Hey girl you prepare it with some
Chinese potatoes and banana

308
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,349
What Rosy? Come on get up fellow

309
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,253
Get up l say - Then you prepare
it the way you like okay

310
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,921
Get up you rascal
Rascal is yours...!

311
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,997
My god, it is tutor!

312
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,166
What man? Did you
have work yesterday night?

313
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,329
A small one, why is tutor
without any prior notice?

314
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,136
You have become
so lean, come sit l'll tell

315
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:40,484
Temm DrC

316
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,017
Tutor, that is not required okay

317
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:48,025
Don't you know tutor, by taking all
these people, they have busted on me

318
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,301
When l'm alone if the scene gets
bad, l can some how escape

319
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,064
While in this case, l'll have
to carry this one also

320
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,532
And again if this fellow changes
the mind on seeing money

321
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,009
One day he'll stab on my
back and he'll escape

322
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,408
Tutor let that fellow
swim some where else

323
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,743
Tutor you may leave that case

324
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,750
Then like what tutor used to
say, robbery is a sort of creation

325
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,392
For doing that the real pleasure is
when we are doing it alone

326
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:19,520
Everything is true, but son you
keep him forfew days and see

327
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,758
lf he doesn't suit you,
you can chuck him out, no?

328
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,160
Other wise he'll fall in some danger

329
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,362
Someone will spoil him

330
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,564
His age is like that of fire works

331
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,403
Do we have to spoil
a good young man?

332
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,671
Son, let him stay for few days

333
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,249
Now what can l say?
l'm trapped, no?

334
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,318
Tutor you come

335
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,425

00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,999
Fellow, did you pass orfail?

340
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,501
Failed!

341
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:04,141
That is very good,
where is your house?

342
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,603
lrinjalakuda

343
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,280
l just guessed it, do you
have any lineage?

344
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,645
Does any of your ancestors
were in this field?

345
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,346
Then why did you come here?

346
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,817
Do you think stealing is so easy?

347
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:28,792
Tutor it won't work out, on
looking he has got a sly face

348
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:34,061
Man, you don't say like
that you do this for me

349
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,537
l've given him the
word that is why

350
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,271
Look, since tutor has
told this matter

351
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,406
Look, l didn't like him at all!

352
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,485
At last it'll be a burden
that is for sure

353
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,414
l know you won't deny my words

354
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,549
You are the one who has got
tutor's blessing then l'm leaving

355
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,820
Okay tutor - lf l get late my son
in law will get tensed

356
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,226
All though l'm wife's father,
l'm an old thief is it?

357
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,468
Tutor, don't go okay

358
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,139
Only this roughness outside,
he is a real innocent person

359
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,837
On knowing that purity of the mind,
l taught him the lesson and took with me

360
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,637
As he had the in
born talent and lineage

361
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,217
lt was more easy for me
Tutor!

362
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,121
Keep this with you
Boy, why all this?

363
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,687
Then shall l go?

364
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:43,599
This knowledge of stealing,
don't take it as a small thing

365
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,334
lt is very serious and at the
same time it is very dangerous!

366
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,912
Only if you have the blessings of
tutors then you'll succeed in art

367
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,872
Don't forget that one

368
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,220
Learn everything watch fully
Okay tutor

369
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,913
Obey whateverthe tutor says

370
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,492
All is well

371
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:44,765
Temm DrC

372
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,500
ls this some kind of ring tone?

373
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:51,931
No it is not, is it?
No this is real cough

374
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,810
What kind of ants
are these? Don't they sleep?

375
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,547
Don't you know
that? Brother ants don't sleep

376
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,780
ls it true?

377
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,656
ln this world it is ants, one and only
creatures that doesn't sleep

378
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,791
So we both are of the
same group, no? Sorry guys

379
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:22,001
Hey man, whether slept or not ants
are greaterthan human beings

380
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,866
Why is that brother?.

381
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:27,501
When an ant intends it
can bite on our buttocks

382
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,342
No matter how much we try
can we bite on ants buttocks?

383
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,677
No, is it? Then ant is greater

384
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,286
Hell with it put that
thing inside the dog's cage

385
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,686
What a nuisance is this,
when night falls will start

386
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,386
This cough, simply to
disturb ones sleep

387
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,987
Stuff something in its mouth
What a deadly daughter in law

388
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,995
My Sulu, you remain calm,
father is not feeling well is it?

389
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,430
On the third day after wedding
saying curry was not good -

390
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,336
- this old man whacked with a spoon

391
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,239
He should not cough
but he should crawl

392
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,868
My Sulu, all that is a very
old story is it?

393
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,480
ln return you have also done, is it?

394
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,050
Shut up and lie down there
My spine!

395
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,955
No, don't move

396
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,355
My god

397
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:31,438
What if on getting a kick
that urine block is gone

398
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,342
What a joy!

399
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,515
My mother!

400
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,626
He has got sugar that is sure

401
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,731
Hey fellow stop
yourtongue wagging

402
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,595
Are you teaching
Sachin to score goal?

403
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,069
Hey you small boy

404
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,856
No stuff!

405
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,020
What happened brother?

406
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,333
Overthere between husband
and wife reality show is going on

407
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,798
Till this time they have
reached only elimination round

408
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,871
What a cheap fellow, if l had
waited there for some more time

409
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,770
l would have reached Danger zone

410
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,469
You come here, we'll take
another plan

411
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,409
Come

412
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,942
You wait here
Okay brother

413
00:34:50,121 --> 00:35:14,139
Temm DrC

414
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,841
Come fellow

415
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,550
Hey where is this guy running?
Hey fellow this is my house

416
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,985
Tutor came and handed him
over to me as apprentice

417
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,428
Fellow you sleep on that bench

418
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,671
At mid-night saw a
small dream and got up

419
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,672
Then couldn't sleep at all

420
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,435
Girl what was the dream that you
saw? Was it a 'A' certificate?

421
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,441
Get lost

422
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,805
For the first time on starting this job

423
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,644
Didn't get anything, simply
sleep is wasted

424
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,987
Hey Rosy come, at least this should
happen - What are you doing?

425
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,681
Kids will wake up

426
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,526
My god, father is killing mother

427
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,531
Hey boys why are you crying?

428
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,861
Father was taking the dust
from mother's eyes is it not?

429
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,439
Look here, when father
steals that book -

430
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,204
- will get you that
'Chotta Beema's photo

431
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,542
Keep quite fellows!

432
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,184
That was not required

433
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,992
On just seeing the photo of
fish will eat rice like anything

434
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,892
No way with this cops
and jewellery people

435
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:48,233
Last week gave a best thing of 916
in the shop of our Francis chettan

436
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:54,912
After his multiplication and division
all what is received is one fourth of value

437
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,644
Elephant dung

438
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,645
The condition is even after
doing work also can't live

439
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,718
lt is heard that price of
gold will again go down

440
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,852
Has got no idea on thinking

441
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,885
Hey Jos Mon don't take that mother
has given one for you, is it not?

442
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,963
Let father eat that one, when boy
eats egg he will get chest congestion

443
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,601
Let him eat lady, giving
homeo medicine no?

444
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,760
Then what is there?

445
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:25,274
Look father, this Josekutty
stole his friend's colour pencil

446
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,971
lt was Shyama Prasad who told
me who was sitting next to him

447
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,740
No fatherthis brother is simply lying

448
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,942
Then what?

449
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:38,179
You little tadpole l'll make
your ears into gold

450
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,650
Son, whatever you need father
will buy it for you is it not?

451
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,288
Then why? Don't take anything
from some one without asking

452
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,997
God will punish

453
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,965
On sowing Chinese potatoes,
won't get Ash Gourd

454
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,728
Hey lady!

455
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,041
Any way it is good that
you got a company

456
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,007
lt is a peace of mind for me

457
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,113
lf anyone comes, there is
a person to cough, is it?

458
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,010
Let me wait for 2 more days

459
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,845
Then will decide whether
can take him along or not

460
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,552
Just see whether 24 inch TV
can be got from some where

461
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,021
Heard that Selvichechi's
house warming is nearing

462
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,592
Molly anuty's daughter's
wedding is fixed

463
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,560
For that also needs a sovereign

464
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,824
There is time for that
ls there anything otherthan that?

465
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:27,326
Just asking - When told that
only remembers one thing

466
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,833
Jansy has told she is coming
here to stay for a while

467
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,340
May be she may come

00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,011
Rice and all going to finish okay
How long she will be here?

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,978
Anyway she'll be here
for one ortwo weeks

470
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,016
Whatever you want you

472

Now account has become
high in the shop

473
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,984
ln stead of complaining
pray to get a good work

474
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:53,027
What is this?

You might have finished that
fish curry fully is it? l know that

00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,186
This is not because of fish curry

504

That is because few days back

510
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,080
You first go and eat something
there will be yesterday's rice-gruel

511
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,911
And day before yesterday's
fish curry will be there

512
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,053
You don't go any where
you stay with me

513
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,985
l'll make you an excellent thief,
will that be okay for you?

514
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:25,991
Hey man you have
brought luck to me! Come

515
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,131
Hey fellows, where are you going?

516
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:36,261
We are going to play - Look don't
play in the sun, will be dark like father

517
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,472
On seeing the new follower,
Jansy has got a slight attraction

518
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,011
Did you notice that one?

519
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,478
She is the one when
studying at 8th standard -

520
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,174
- gave love letterto tuition master

521
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,582
No doubt she will have
a slight fixation

522
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,581
Lady, didn't that
Dasan bring any fish?

523
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,347
No, today he didn't come

524
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,550
lf he had come with it, today could
have purchased one and a half kilo

525
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,059
Could have fried it and
could have eaten it fully, no?

526
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,560
Why not then?

527
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,965
Yes 'Othiriparachiammama'
(Old lady who exaggerates)

528
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,330
Did you have the rice-gruel?
No hunger like before son

529
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:12,241
After drinking coffee in the morning,
till noon nothing is required

530
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:18,214
Mouth tastes bitter when noon
arrives will take some rice-gruel with salt

531
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,408
Son, otherthan that
there is no food on rice

532
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:27,047
Hey son Benny will you be having
hundred rupees to give to this mother?.

533
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,256
Will return when l get money
for weaving palm leaves

00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,695
Hey Rosy give two
hundred to Ammama

535
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,669
What, is money kept here
like that to give while asking?

536
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,634
This old lady will come with
a stick in her hand!

537
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,666
Son Benny, you come here

538
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,110
You sit there

539
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,750
Did you know any of the
things which happened here?

540
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,651
What is it? - That Sumathi's
brother is there, no?

541
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,584
That guy who is in Persia

542
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:04,420
His wife eloped with a Christian boy

543
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,520
My goodness
She took all the gold also

544
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,061
Why can't you just
enter into that place?

545
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:18,742
Temm DrC

546
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:19,800
Here

547
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,840
Can't move from the place where
l'm standing, can't even walk a bit

548
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,651
Daughter then shall l go?

549
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,146
Son, l'm going
Okay

550
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,489
lt is because of giving money to all -

551
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,153
- that is why still in this
clay titled roof house

552
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,256
That Shankuru thief at lttithara has
purchased land in the heart of the -

553
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,164
- city, by paying a whooping amount!

554
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,794
Do you know all this things?
You do one thing

555
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,097
You stay along with that
Shankuru thief - What?

556
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:55,201
Hey lady, tutor always used to say
money will come today and go tomorrow

557
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,245
Don't get carried over by it

558
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:01,181
Hey lady, a good thief
is a good communist!

559
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:05,378
A real communist taking money
from rich and giving to poor

560
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,782
Rosy, if we try to save the stolen
things, that won't remain forever!

561
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,785
Here, go

562
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,672
Look, in the deserted courtyards -

563
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,640
- there will be wells without
walls, be careful

564
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,710
Then enter only in those
houses where there are no dogs

565
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,675
l'm not that greedy -

566
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,409
- myself and my kids will
live with the limited resources

567
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,617
Your brother is a big
absent minded person

568
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,549
Don't forget this torch
here and there

569
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,485
Look while climbing on the walls
there will be glasses, be careful

570
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:44,718
My Rosily, you remain bold our
ancestors who are dead will protect

571
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,353
You just don't brood
over it, you go and sleep

572
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,399
There is mist, look you may leave
only after 2 or 3 weeks, okay

573
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,832
Okay brother - Anyway l'll return
after few days only

574
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:57,305
Now it is not like before, a new
person is going to come, must be careful

575
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,372
Then over here l must teach
the art to this person also

576
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,235
Come on man
Okay sister

577
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,575
What a mist?
God, protect

578
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,356
Hey man during early times in
each place it had a regional thief

579
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,421
Regional thief of that native

580
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,925
The law is no other
thief from outside -

581
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,758
- should come and rob in that place

582
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,530
My father's grand father was the
'thief of the native' in our place

583
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:28,260
He was really skilled will even
put hinges on the egg shell

584
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,531
ls it so?
Did you con?

585
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,769
No l'm serious - Do you think
it is a small pedigree?

586
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,610
500 bags of gold coins, paddy fields
that reaps huge volumes of rice

587
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,443
All these things were
awarded by king out of love

588
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,553
But one incident took place, one
day when grand pa went to steal

589
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,849
Saw a bathing scene slipped
the leg and fell into a pond

590
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,287
lmmediately king caught
him and hanged him!

591
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,524
So grandpa is dead!

592
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,298
So you have learned,
you thief, come

593
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,533
Hot deadly girls like jack fruit who
sleeps completely un conscious

594
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,975
Deadly bedroom scenes which
will out live English movies

595
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,975
And small lads who
comes to see scene

596
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,850
During mid-night such kinds of
several sights will come to our eyes

597
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,518
Whatever you see you
shouldn't lose your control

598
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,420
A good thief is like a good doctor

599
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,387
No matter how much beautiful is the
girl we shouldn't lose our control

600
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,027
Work is truth there should
be no cheating on that one

601
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,665
Come

602
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,802
Water mixed with 'Gall-nut' and
praying to Hanuman is a must for us

603
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:40,471
Also practice some yoga also, may be
sometimes people might catch us -

604
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:41,874
- in the middle of robbery

605
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,378
All the jerks will come
and whack to the pulp!

606
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,345
There won't be any
mercy while hitting!

607
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,041
Situation will be like that of a
fly in the middle of percussion

608
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,684
Like that when entire compatriots
whack us to the core!

609
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,848
There is a special kind of yoga
posture, when sitting in that posture

610
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,289
Then won't know anything

611
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:59,692
Tutor have you ever sat in
this yoga posture before?

612
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,830
Why not? Several times

613
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,367
Worry not when compatriots
and cops finish their 'festival'

614
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:13,671
There is a treatment by mixing
all the Ayurvedic components in egg

615
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,841
Then will be double
strong, did you see this?

616
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,012
Just press and see

617
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,548
Fellow, press it boldly

618
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,723
lt has been few days since
you had that medicine is it?

619
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,550
ls it so?

620
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,398
There is no use of talking like
this, must learn the art, no?

621
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,327
Then shall we start the game?
Why not?

622
00:50:40,270 --> 00:51:05,790
Temm DrC

623
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,427
Give the bag man

624
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:21,474
Looks like, that 'head of the fish'
which was kept to feed the dog

625
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,079
lt seems she has made curry with it!

626
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,882
l'm going to do a deadly thing

627
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,955
lf it doesn't work out
you run and escape

628
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,804
Some dogs are like timid goons

629
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,138
We fear it will bite and tear us off

630
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,739
But dog will be also
having the same fear

631
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,085
Whoever attacks first,
opposite party will run

632
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,620
That is sure

633
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,657
How will we know this one?

634
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,587
Forthat should know dog
psychology l'll teach you all that

635
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,891
You come

636
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,825
But this idea may
not work out always

637
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,734
There will be some dirty dogs
who knows human psychology

638
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,835
During those times will get trapped

639
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,501
But when you do this
always keep one thing in mind

640
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:33,139
Should wear under wear
otherwise it will end in big trouble

641
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,448
Walk like a cat

642
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,127
Waiting like that of a spider

643
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,731
Patience of a craine

644
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,527
Everything should be
studied from nature

645
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,573
Pour!

646
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,702
Enough!

647
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,869
Hey fellow!
What? - lt is not safe

648
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,073
Safety is the main thing
suppose if anyone wakes up

649
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,743
Should open a door
to escape at first

650
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,649
Did you understand?
Then you walk

651
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,093
We'll think the money
is in cupboard

652
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,559
But thinking that we'll think like
that members of the house -

653
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,565
- will keep the money in the
containers in kitchen

654
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,763
Thinking that members of the house
will keep money in kitchen containers

655
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:07,275
We'll search there by the time he
might have shifted money to store room

656
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,609
One thief at the same time

657
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:15,513
He should be a goal keeper and
also a player who strikes penalty

658
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,314
Should think with double brains

659
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:19,850
Did you understand?

660
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:47,109
Temm DrC

661
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,311
Fellow, in the container
where eatables are kept

662
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,254
Rice-pot

663
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,090
Pocket of old shirt, place
where fire-wood is kept

664
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,129
To get gold search in these places

665
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,632
Now if it is key, dog's cage

666
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,762
Or inside plant pot
that is guarantee

667
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,602
Come, come

668
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,011
Hey fellow

669
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,188
While leaving after the theft

670
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:31,123
To trick the police dog, there
is one more trick pending

671
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:36,025
Usually practice is doing
some filth at the front portico

672
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,858
But thieves who has got
decency doesn't do that

673
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,195
For us this will do

674
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:52,376
Made in Kunnamkulam, if he runs
he has to run till Kunnamkulam

675
00:55:52,716 --> 00:56:05,618
Temm DrC

676
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,292
''Hey thief, thief!''

00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,930
''Hey thief, thief!''

00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,432
''Hey thief, thief!''

680
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,112
''On stealing a vessel,
calls him a thief'

681
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,942
''Also on stealing gold from
a locker calls him a thief'

682
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,686
''On stealing food, calls him thief'

683
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:34,119
''By stealing heart with a
sly look, calls him thief'

684
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,885
Where did you go at this time?

685
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,893
Sir, our Ukkan lawyer's daughter's
wedding is on Wednesday

686
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,260
Before that new house warming
should be done before that

687
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,923
Overtime work is going
on there on plumping

688
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,993
Fellow what is it in this bag?
Sir that is tools

689
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,267
Okay, okay, try to reach home

690
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,842
During mid-night suppose when
confronted before the cops -

691
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,945
- we should have
ready made answers

692
00:56:56,112 --> 00:57:03,177
''To survive if you say small lies
then you are a thief, thief, thief!

694

''Also on stealing gold from
a locker calls him a thief'

695
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,168
This whole world is full of
several kinds of thieves

696
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,796
There is robbery every where

697
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,036
Like catching the fish with prey

698
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,278
Better than getting
salary without working

699
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,040
Betterthan squeezing poor
people and making money

700
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,809
This profession is much
better is it not?

701
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:37,444
For big thieves car with red
beacon light and police escort

702
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,955
What about us? Do we have a
pension, do we have insurance?

703
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,819
That is what l said this country
won't get better - What a world it is?

704
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,865
''When night gets dark,
without anyone's notice''

705
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:52,130
''- going to work that is
a thief of the past''

706

''ln this age of which
is right or wrong -''

709
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:07,215

Here this is the share for your work

717
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,504
Take it man

718
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,409
Tomorrow is the beginning
of 'Sankranthi'

719
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,548
Which means, thieves
go on penance

720
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,215
The rule is during this
time no thief should steal

721
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:45,048
On the contrary with the money
which is saved till that time

722
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,554
Just live lavishly, when the
celebrations are over

723
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,792
Go to Palani and take the
'Kavadi' and end the penance

724
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,555
On the way of return
go for a big booty

725
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,922
That is the scheme of tutor Kelu

Will anyone steal at the
temple's compound?

746
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,659
At last if anyone catches you like
this whom will you call for help?

747
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,221
ls it devil?

''By stealing heart with a

755
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,453
Today we are going to enter
the house of a money lender

756
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,255
Each brick of that house

757
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,061
That is made from the tears
of poor people of this native

758
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,928
This 'operation Kubera'
has not affected him at all

759
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:19,197
Preying on the interest
money, in any of the nights

760
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,572
Each and every night
he expects a thief

761
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,645
So definitely there
will be good precaution

762
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,074
But whatever be the risk
you wait and see Manoj

763
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,590
With this single night his name will
be there in the 'BPL' list of that native

764
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:40,261
Person from Vandaloor,
Francis son of Babychan

765
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,061
That is an obstinacy

766
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,597
Didn't get Porotta, got
chapathi, curry is 'kuruma'

767
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,333
That is enough, really hungry

768
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,066
No need keep it
Thank you brother

769
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,542
A small girl sir, the age is only 19

770
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,180
Give more money
otherwise not possible

771
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,114
Asking for a whole day,
only 2 hours is possible

772
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,415
Brother, do you know who that
person is, who is shouting?

773
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:11,989
He is a pimp, no? - Not pimp,
he is the father of that girl

774
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,292
Father?

775
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,432
He is a Malayali

776
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,730
For 20 years he is here

777
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,403
During that time he
was a rich person -

778
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,204
- in his native he had
a finance company

779
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,802
Poor man, one day a thief
came and stole everything

780
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:37,116
Afterthat, forthe case and all, he
sold the house and came here

781
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:39,821
One and only daughter

782
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,483
Poor fellow

783
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,726
Now he is living by selling her body

784
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:54,162
Temm DrC

785
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,769
Shucks!

786
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,270
Come fast
Coming

787
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,139
Sir, after eating put the
waste in waste basket

788
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,645
l'll come and pick it

789
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,678
What happened?

790
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,078
Why looking so tensed?

791
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,848
l was the thief who
entered into his house!

792
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,779
You don't come, you stay here

793
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,340
Bennychetta, you don't
go alone l'll also come

794
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,781
You listen to what l'm saying

795
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:37,552
Temm DrC

796
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,331
My Rosily!

797
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:14,448
'The game is not over..
Only about to begin...'

798
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:32,032
Temm DrC

799
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,974
They whacked me to the pulp man

800
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,647
No one beatings got missed!

801
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:18,883
There was no use in sitting on
yoga posture, it was full beating

802
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,683
Anyway happened is happened,
now what is the use of saying

803
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,689
Several people have come
to me to seek the trade

804
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,089
All were cheating ones

805
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,232
Boy, you are just like
my own brother to me

806
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,703
Since l'm not there don't desist
from going to my house, okay

807
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,501
Like your own house you
can go there at any time

808
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,073
ln this native even the
murders get the parole

809
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,146
For poorthieves that
is also not there

810
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:48,183
Which ever government rules,
condition of thief is the same

811
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,685
Anyway it will take 4 to 5
months for my release from here

812
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,221
Till that time you don't sit idle

813
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:56,716
lf the iron and brain is
kept idle, it'll get ruined

814
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,891
l'll suggest one person to you,
you stay with him for some time

815
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,054
Anyway you are also in
need of money, is it?

816
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,166
lf you wait for me,
you will get dumped

817
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,065
You go to 'Mangadikunnu'
and meet choodan Rajappan

818
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,143
All though he is hot
tempered his heart is good

819
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,078
lf you say Benny chettan
has told, he won't leave you

820
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,740
As he is busy man
he'll give the share also

821
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,088
Hey Lady Janammo, can't
you reduce the heat of this?

822
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,751
What the hell, what hot it is?

823
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,691
l'm Manoj, other day l came
with Benny chettan, no?

824
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,929
Yea, now l recollect, Benny
Kochaettan's new follower, no?

825
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,968
Dear friend, just move back,
came from hot sun is it?

826
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,940
Can't bear this heat, that is why

827
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,116
Hey Janammo, hey come here
What is it?

828
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,243
One visitor has come

829
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,253
This is our Benny
Kochaettan's friend is it?

830
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:00,754
Really hot, hey Lady
don't come near me

831
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,686
You go and take something
to drink for him

832
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:07,651
lf there is butter milk that will do
Son, that got over

833
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,591
Shall l take lemon, l'll give okay

834
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,664
Friend, you have not
told why you had come?

835
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,963
What is it? Without
Kochaettan, all alone?

836
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,270
Don'tjust stand there you go
and take water and come

837
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,332
Don't shout and increase your heat

838
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,739
Son, now you may say

839
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:34,053
Benny chettan is now in
jail, l'm coming from jail only

840
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:40,893
My god, Kochaettan, doesn't
make such a mistake

841
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,325
l've not seen a thief who has got
such an inner consciousness

842
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:52,665
When l went to jail, Benny Chettan
has told me to meet Rajapannan

843
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,834
Can l remain with you brother?

844
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,212
l'll stay with you, without cheating

845
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,911
What a nonsense
Kochaettan, has done

846
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,382
Son, without raining,
how can l go out?

847
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,620
See it is summer, the sky
is so hot, can't you see?

848
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:10,850
To escape from this hotness, to go
out god has not given sweat gland

849
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:14,860
Right from the day l was born
this curse of fire is on my head

850
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:18,697
Son, you may go now,
when it lightens -

851
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,700
- when first drop of rain falls on
ground you come at that time

852
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,396
You may go, my god how hot it is

853
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,288
One tea
Here one tea

854
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:47,684
Rice!

855
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,356
Brother how many times this
eating, again will have to cook rice

856
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,334
Will give rupees ten
and eat ten kilos of rice

857
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,211
l came to know about the things

858
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,176
Friend got trapped, is it?

859
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,781
The moment when the
mind's concentration is gone

860
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,941
At that very moment
the failure will start

861
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,710
That is the fate of any thief

862
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,947
Tutor, did your collection
get over early today?

863
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,114
Man all that won't work out

864
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,421
ln this hot sun will have to
roam all around the native

865
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:20,962
After collecting the
money and going -

866
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,963
- son in law will count this
way and that way

867
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,828
And a grunt with a meaning!

868
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,899
This is the fate of every thief

869
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,138
ln one way betterthan this
is, the art which is studied

870
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,833
Really hot, you mouth
will get burned okay

871
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,440
Now this is the last okay, no more

872
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,275
Only eating this small quantity

873
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,283
That is not liked by her husband

874
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,388
My dog will stand there,
after hearing all this insult

875
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:50,288
l just came out, you sit here
let me finish this

876
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:57,823
When l first saw you,
there was a fire in your eyes

877
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,292
Still now that is there

878
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,493
The desire to make money

879
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,230
That will only put you in danger

880
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,833
Whatever that is known by now, all
that which is yet to be known is so small

881
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,172
Soon you will understand that

882
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,208
You have to learn a lot

883
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,843
Why son? Why not give a try?

884
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:40,539
Temm DrC

885
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,508
Glass piece!

886
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,372
How did tutor see that one?

887
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:51,877
Don't be astonished, several times
on seeing in darkness, light will come

888
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,255
A sort of illusion

889
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,187
When you get that sight there
is nothing to worry at all

890
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,352
Even the treasures that is hidden
inside the cellars in houses

891
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,259
Thiefs eyes can see that

892
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,530
But it requires good practice

893
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,036
Like the treasure which is hidden
inside the house, is it so tutor?.

894
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:11,904
Yes

895
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,163
True

896
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,337
Anyway has invested
some money on it

897
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,344
What is this house owner's job?
He is in police

898
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,549
ln police?
DYSP, special branch

899
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:30,851
You are smart man, l see a
good future for you in this field

900
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,823
When you aim, aim at the right one

901
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,823
After mid-night

902
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:42,927
ln the sky at the North-Eastern
side a slight red star will come

903
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,140
We should start the
work only after that

904
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:50,268
For 2 hours that star
will remain in the sky

905
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,478
Before the star fades from the sky,
must finish the robbery by that time

906
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:58,609
Otherwise the respect of the thief
will be gone, l'll teach all that

907
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:02,246
You go and come, l'll be here only

908
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,594
When you come across
old couples during robbery -

909
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,023
- receive the blessing from
them, by touching their feet

910
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,529
What is up, regarding the
matterfor which you went?

911
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,430
Son, is the money enough?

912
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:24,137
No tutor must require more

913
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,668
You don't worry money is there
all round this universe

914
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:34,576
ln the granary where rice is hidden,
god has created insects in it, no?

915
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,147
That is why god has
created thieves

916
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:41,584
Thief means one who is to posses

917
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,317
You come we'll go for a walk

918
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:48,086
A master theft is called 'Royal theft'

919
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,393
Royal theft is not based
on the material stolen -

920
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:55,162
- but it is the way it is
taken and in which time

921
01:17:55,570 --> 01:18:00,473
Poor people, old
people, kids, handicapped

922
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,077
Never steal anything
from these people

923
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:08,743
Robbery from a corpse is also
denied to us as perthe science

924
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,551
The reason for that is not
the humanitarian side of it

925
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,086
lf you do like that

926
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:16,050
Thief will have to answer
for the murder

927
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,683
For a straight forward
robbery there are 7 signs

936
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:56,025
We thieves, whatever we
have earned it in a hard way

937
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,127
There is a place here where
all the 'booty' is stored

938
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,497
The room at the court
where booty is stored

939
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:05,402
All the A to Z things like
a super market it is here

940
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,407
Then why tutor we have to take
trouble in roaming here and there?

941
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,140

Then how are the things at home?

955

the temple's offering box properly

Have you reached?

976
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:28,469
When you weren't seen l just slept
After finishing for which l had gone

977
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,271
The time got delayed

978
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,006
Shall we go?
Will go

979
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:35,215
But before that l need to
speak some things to you

980
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,645
Sit, come on sit

981
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:43,517
l have taught you
laws on rule of blood

982
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:46,554
The skill which you have acquired
have given you money also

983
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,357
But you must remember one thing

984
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:54,962
Like how buffaloes pull the cart,
each action will carry its result

985
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,663
That will follow you without cease

986
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,934
From that fate you can
never stay aloof

Each and every moments of our life
is recorded by an unknown person

988

See, today it is full of bad omens

989
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,481
Your mind is also not relaxed now

990
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,552
Son, it is better that
today you don't do it

991
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,852
Son, you go and sleep peacefully

992
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,691
No, tutor l can't sleep

993
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,365
l'm ready to face anything

994
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,465
Tutor, you don't worry, the
house which we have selected -

995
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,902
- no one is staying there

996
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:36,374
But in my mind, today there is some
feeling of danger - No problem

997
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:38,374
Tutor, you only have to come

Catch him!
Beat him!

1002
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:10,004

1003
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:11,832
Catch him!

1004
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,834
Come, walk

Why remaining
struck? Come and sit

No, simply asked

1010

crime, there is no big difference

01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:09,953
l surrendered, when joining the
gang they make us to do the oath -

1021
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,285
- that we won't leave
the gang and go

1022
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,651
lnside the crowd, there
will be always their guard

1023
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,628
When we change the route,
sometimes they will push a dagger

1024
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:19,599
l tried to with stand to maximum -

1025
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:22,292
- but when l was told to
sleep with that old mason

1026
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,002
l did that!

1027
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,938
Should crush that pig!

1028
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:35,639
Feeding parade, didn't
understand? l mean food

1029
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,752
Having food, come on
get up, really hungry, no?

1030
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:44,215
Make it fast, if we don't go
fast will add water in 'sambar'

1031
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,896
What is his case?
Killed 3 people

1032
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:59,098
Own daughter was
raped and killed, killed 3 men

1033
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,178
Pour more, small pain

1034
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:08,348
Today is it sambar?

1035
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:16,190
Do you know one Benny?
Which Benny?

1036
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:17,817
Very tall

1037
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,756
As per knowledge there are
4 to 5 Benny's here

1038
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,921
What is the case? Murder?
No theft

1039
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,790
Yes our Benny who is in Poonkunnam

1040
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:29,325
That dark and fat? For 2 days
his duty is in quarters

1041
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:32,937
What is the matter?
No, just wanted to see him

1042
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,139
Hey fellow, fellow, stop there

1043
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,119
Benny chettan, where were you? l
was looking at the time when l came

1044
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,156
The work was at quarters,
spine is broken

1045
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,850
l came to know over
here that you were trapped

1046
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,361
Leave that man, all this is
said in our trade

1047
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:59,296
You leave that did
you go to my house?

1048
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:03,662
Joy Mon had a slight fever l went
along with sister and went to hospital

1049
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:06,805
When you were there, there
was a peace of mind

1050
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,874
When Jancy also goes
who is there for help?

1051
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,735
Now Rosily is carrying also

1052
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:18,413
Look, that person, that fellow

1053
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:22,185
Just take a look
on him, he is Carlos

1054
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:29,795
ltem is our department
but the route is different

1055
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:31,191
A bull!

1056
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,862
Not in good terms with me

1057
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:40,763
Had come to tutor to learn,
tutor drove him off immediately

1058
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,036
Now he is alone

1059
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,109
During these times, people
like him can only make money

1060
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,408
Nothing to lose!

1061
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,378
Whatever it is make money

1062
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,091
Chop the drum sticks more, let the
things get ready fast

1063
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,095
lt is betterto reduce thrill

1064
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:06,266
Since that 'Pavada' Suresh
has gone on parole

1065
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,427
Carlos chettan doesn't like
drum sticks that much

1066
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,395
l'll just give you one okay

1067
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,041
Why man laughing?
Carlos chetta, no need

1068
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,807
lt has been so long
since seen a viral

1069
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,679
That was a time

1070
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:23,783
That is the flourto make porotta
both of you don't make Shakeela with it

1071
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,245
What is this? ls it a festival?
Didn't you know?

1072
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,983
Now prisoners are given
training on percussion

1073
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,888
The new idea of superintend sir
ls it so?

1074
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:35,019
Let the crimes have a rhythm

1075
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:38,193
Who is the master
Peruvanan Daison how is it?

1076
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:40,000
Great

1077
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,293
Will they start the course on theft?

1078
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,801
Must carry on the firm, no?

1079
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:48,100
Now a days schools doesn't
have enough children, its closing down

1080
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:51,709
Carlos chetta, new
2 joining are there

1081
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:54,480
Both are young men
lt must be Marijuana

1082
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,944
Or abuse that is the
present trend, no?

1083
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:19,031
Temm DrC

1084
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,178
Can't you sleep?

1085
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,948
Stop talking and sleep

1086
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:38,855
Why both are shy? What is
the case? ls it abuse?

1087
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,860
No, it is chit fund
What?

1088
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:44,192
Chit fund got doomed
Gone? Gone

1089
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:47,363
l've seen you some where?

1090
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,197
What is your other business?

1091
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,430
No, there is no particular work

1092
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:55,036
Will do all the jobs - Yes, yes
So doesn't know any job, is it?

1093
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:57,571
Now till you go will
have permanent job

1094
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:00,811
Elephant is gone!

1095
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,056
What a stuff? Won't say it is a
plantain inside jail, on seeing

1096
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,056
lnstead of doing that chit fund could
have planted some plantains

1097
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,559
At native could have
survived with that

1098
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:17,898
That Rapayi chettan's son Prince
he made money out of plantains

1099
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:21,059
At that time it was not okay,
was having the insolence

1100
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,499
To whom?
To you only, who else?

1101
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:27,197
Stop talking and work

1102
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,209
What a lousy jail it is

1103
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:35,813
Can we say this to anyone outside?

1104
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:39,451
When mother tells to tie
the cow, l won't do it at home

1105
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:43,079
Mother shouldn't see this
lf some one puts this on face book

1106
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:46,057
What will be the condition of
managing directors of B and B curries?

1107
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:48,186
Then what? Right now do
we have tons of respect?

1108
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:52,429
Why are you starring at me?
Come on keep on digging

1109
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,232
''Planting the plantain, long
live love on that''

1110
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:56,429
What long live?

1111
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,635
Put this one also let it reap nicely

1112
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:03,310
Hey man

1113
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,404
Again how will we
face the compatriots?

1114
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:09,074
You just think
You forget about compatriots

1115
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:12,118
Compatriots doesn't have a
unique face, to look at the face

1116
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:15,283
Uncles doesn't like my
father even otherwise

1117
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:19,024
Now with this all will
belittle him to the core

1118
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:21,185
lf l get thatjerk boy, l'll hit him

1119
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,127
What is there to give?
Taken everything, no?

1120
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:27,430
At that time itself l have told not to
delegate him for money collection

1121
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,401
l've got no idea, no money
to buy even the poison

1122
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:37,000
Don't worry man, after a loss of 30
lakhs in chit fund l've Rs.16.50

1123
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,610
That is more than enough
to buy rat poison

1124
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,404
Don't say cheap comedy,
talk some serious matter

1125
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:44,177
When l told the matter you
didn't like, then what can l do?

1126
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,145
What is he saying?

1127
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:50,148
How can that be? Don't you
know how much they love us?

1128
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,124
Then what? Out of love only
snatched even under garments

1129
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:54,923
Don't make me talk okay

1130
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,994
Hey man, that is what l said?

1131
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:01,466
Either suicide or must do
the other thing, that l said

1132
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:04,299
Other than these two options in
front of us there is no way at all

1133
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:06,168
You decide what to do

1134
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,568
Hey man, look

1135
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:17,312
lt is god who has send us to a
person who is really fit for that

1136
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,021
He knows our situation

1137
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:25,416
You don't worry on anything,
we'll work out on this

1138
01:34:25,893 --> 01:34:42,072
Temm DrC

1139
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,502
Brother, wants to say a thing
What is it man?

1140
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,079
At native near our house

1141
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,246
There is a family which
is so close to us

1142
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,481
One wedding is going
to be held there

1143
01:34:56,590 --> 01:35:00,026
Old couples and a girl
only is staying there

1144
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,120
For that what should l do?

1145
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,059
lnside the cupboard, there
is lot of money and gold

1146
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:07,530
We'll give all the details
of that house

1147
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:11,231
Just give a share to us
on what you get

1148
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,039
What did you think of me?

1149
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:15,472
What am l forthe otherjob?

1150
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:17,407
We didn't think like that
Go man

1151
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:20,072
Are you teaching me to steal?

1152
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:22,238
How man?
Brother we are just

1153
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:25,284
Benny chetta leave!
What is it?

1154
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,747
He is coming to give tips to Benny

1155
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:32,348
He has come to sell me
ln the neighbours house...

1156
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,587
To steal the gold for the wedding

1157
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,356
Cheaters!

1158
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:39,996
Yes brother we are cheaters,
not to make money and all

1159
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,531
But to live

1160
01:35:41,635 --> 01:35:44,502
As there is no other way
Benny chetta, we are also not saints

1161
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:46,163
We also do the same work, is it?

1162
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:49,765
A thief becomes a thief not when a
child grows up, no where in the world

1163
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:53,269
As there is no other way, that is
why l and you became thieves!

1164
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:56,406
My profession is theft but
it has got a honesty in it

1165
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:59,077
This Benny won't be there for
non straight forward ways

1166
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,746
Hell with it, with your
straight forward ways

1167
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:04,552
During these times when god who
doesn't look after us, no one will pray

1168
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,592
l'm in need of money
that too lot of money

1169
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,685
That is by killing or
cheating some one

1170
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:12,221
Only you will be there to kill and
cheat, Benny won't be there

1171
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,598
You take both of them along with
you, it is a good combination

1172
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,534
Will get really well!

1173
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,366
Manoj, is it?

1174
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,815
Usually this Carlos chettan
doesn't do partnership business

1175
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:08,849
That is a big risk

1176
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,689
But now l have a
feeling in that route

1177
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:16,522
Out of what is gained, half is yours

1178
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:20,856
There is only one condition, without
cheating should stay with me

1179
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,795
lf it is okay, shake hands

1180
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:58,428
Even though Benny Chettan told
that simply, we thought of it seriously

1181
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,764
Can Manoj chettan stay with us?

1182
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:04,570
Other than this there is no
other way before us

1183
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:08,237
At the native place, the situation is
very shameful, fully drenched in shame

1184
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,783
Whateverthat is gained, that can
be equally shared between us

1185
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:14,948
That is the word, like us Manoj
chettan also needs money, we know that

1186
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:20,556
lf Manoj chettan is with us,
we'll do it won't you be with us?

1187
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:34,066
Temm DrC

1188
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:36,573
What man a conspiracy?

1189
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,242
Come on tell to me also

1190
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:43,750
A total mis match, fellows
what is going on here?

1191
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,176
Come on tell, fellow

1192
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:50,455
No, there is nothing like that
Don't hide from me

1193
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:53,282
l know, l heard it

1194
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:59,289
Fellow, to do such kind of
things it really requires guts

1195
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:02,799
There should be no prick of
consciousness, like your Benny!

1196
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,939
But there is no problem with the
teachings gained from school, in you

1197
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,899
You are fresh, l liked you

1198
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:17,481
Hey boys, do you want money?
Then must play a different game

1199
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:19,847
l'll there with you

1200
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:23,655
But is the information correct?
100%% correct

1201
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,723
ln there, there is money
and gold for wedding

1202
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:31,527
That family is so close to us - This
people who cheats so close family -

1203
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:34,395
- without any prick of
consciousness, how can we trust them?

1204
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:38,596
That is also true
But on this case, you can trust us

1205
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:41,841
Because if we don't get money, then
suicide is the only way before us

1206
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:46,608
There is no other way - Hey man,
we'll do this robbery together

1207
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:50,706
Then whateverthat is gained
will share it only in three portions

1208
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:53,285
Only 3 shares okay
That is enough

1209
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,861
Day after tomorrow l'm going
to get released from here

1210
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,006
By this month end,
you will be also coming out

1211
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:17,870
On the day, when the
last person gets released

1212
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,774
By day time at around 12 o'clock

1213
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:24,406
We'll join at the 'Nila lodge'
near south railway station

1214
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,385
We can plan rest of
the things from there

1215
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:31,516
Don't forget, Nila lodge

1216
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:34,792
On the first floor, room number 1 7

1217
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,539
Hey fellow, what man?
Playing with ants?

1218
01:40:55,983 --> 01:40:58,076
Do the work properly

1219
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:22,701
Brother, this 1 7th number room
Which one? - 1 7th

1220
01:42:22,836 --> 01:42:24,997
Go straight away to
upstairs, the last room

1221
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:53,059
Temm DrC

1222
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:25,689
Yea, come

1223
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:35,472
When you weren't
seen l just had a nap

1224
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:37,667
Yesterday night was out of sleep

1225
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:41,642
ln the jail there was taking evidence
by human rights commission

1226
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:42,806
That is why got delayed

1227
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:45,484
Human rights!
You sit

1228
01:43:56,964 --> 01:43:58,591
Yea, come

1229
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:10,904
What, both of you has
become pale like a paper?

1230
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:12,671
Started shaking right now?

1231
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:14,838
No, we are strong

1232
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:19,815
Then how are the things? - By
around 9-9:30 both will go to bed

1233
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:21,978
lf they watch TV sometimes
it may reach 10 o'clock

1234
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:24,623
Anyway it won't go beyond
10 o'clock, that is sure

1235
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:28,022
Then main switch of the house is
on the wall of back side shed

1236
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:32,663
ln the next house there is
a dirty dog, that we'll manage

1237
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:38,533
Then Carlos chetta, there is a girl
there for help, she is a distant relative

1238
01:44:38,839 --> 01:44:41,171
That is not an issue at
all, she is my lover

1239
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,572
She is the one who told she
will put the door unlocked

1240
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:49,842
But the problem is when a
leaf moves in that courtyard

1241
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,110
Both will get up

1242
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:54,914
That you leave it to
me, if at all if they wake up

1243
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:57,851
l know how to make them sleep!

1244
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,729
Then shall we go?

1245
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:07,931
No need today, tomorrow will do, for
robbery tomorrow is the best day

1246
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:11,569
We'll do it tomorrow
Okay, we'll do it tomorrow

1247
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:16,237
So, one whole day time
should be wasted simply

1248
01:45:17,177 --> 01:45:20,146
Boys what is the way
to get rid off boredom?

1249
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:22,777
For 6 to 7 months

1250
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,941
Was lying inside with
the bed bug and all

1251
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:27,286
Will arrange a way for that

1252
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:29,087
We'll arrange

1253
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:32,352
Then okay, is it?

1254
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:49,809
Come inside

1255
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:01,052
Where is it man?

1256
01:46:03,056 --> 01:46:19,371
Temm DrC

1257
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,864
You go!

1258
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:23,734
You go man!

1259
01:46:35,355 --> 01:46:37,414
We've met before, no?

1260
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:44,425
l'll come now

1261
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:48,166
What is it man?
Got the stuff

1262
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:50,163
But the rate is bit high

1263
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:52,671
Didn't get the local one

1264
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,733
How can it be possible
when always local?

1265
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:58,143
At certain times should
be standard, is it?

1266
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:00,940
l'll pour it for you
My Sheela!

1267
01:47:02,516 --> 01:47:04,780
Go man, get lost l say!

1268
01:47:05,886 --> 01:47:10,414
What all things, divine
love rain in big droplets

1269
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:13,215
My Sheelawathy! (Decent women)

1270
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:25,167
Chandretta, wants 10 kg of sugar
10 Kg?

1271
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:26,705
Yea, 10 kg

1272
01:47:33,346 --> 01:47:36,372
Sir buy honey, a good
honey from woods

1273
01:47:40,887 --> 01:47:44,323
How much does honey cost?
Super honey, Rs. 200

1274
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:47,152
Take 5 bottles
5 bottles?

1275
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,318
Make it fast
1 ,2,3,4 and 5

1276
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,357
Today has won the lottery

1277
01:47:54,334 --> 01:47:56,199
What an ant is this?

1278
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:06,801
Carlos chetta, get up

1279
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:09,846
What is it?
Don't we have to go?

1280
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:13,311
Getting late, don't we have to go?

1281
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:16,345
Man, did she go?
She left

1282
01:48:16,923 --> 01:48:21,951
l couldn't do anything on her
Getting late, we'll start

1283
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:30,092
Temm DrC

1284
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:33,400
Look, we'll wait here you go

1285
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,468
Door at the Northern
side is not locked

1286
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:39,101
Get in through that door

1287
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:42,872
Then while climbing the
stairs, there is a path way

1288
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:45,540
With the left door can
reach in the hall at the top

1289
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:49,879
Gold and money will be either in
any one of the rooms over there

1290
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:55,384
Look even if they get up,
don't hurt them, okay

1291
01:48:56,563 --> 01:48:58,895
No boy!
Come

1292
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:50,916
l'll go inside
You check this way

1293
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,219
lf you feel any doubt, jump outside

1294
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,309
l'll come

1295
01:51:44,297 --> 01:51:47,061
Who has tied me up?
Let me free

1296
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,592
Hey you! - Now did you
understand it is a trap?

1297
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:54,035
To trap you, we have
planned this trap

1298
01:51:57,644 --> 01:52:00,135
Who are you?
Me?

1299
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:05,982
You must be thinking
how l became your foe?

1300
01:52:06,219 --> 01:52:07,516
That you'll understand -

1301
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:11,189
- before that there is another
face which you can recollect

1302
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:13,521
You just see that one!

1303
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:34,676
Not that contact when
you saw at that house

1304
01:52:34,848 --> 01:52:37,817
Before that, just think and see

1305
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:40,444
You will get the memory

1306
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:16,765
Who has opened the door?

1307
01:55:17,343 --> 01:55:19,607
Won't listen when telling to close it

1308
01:55:22,315 --> 01:55:54,275
Temm DrC

1309
01:55:57,350 --> 01:56:01,252
Madhavetta!

1310
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:08,594
My god, Madhavetta!

1311
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:23,468
Radhachechi!

1312
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:26,308
God!
My goodness!

1313
01:56:32,085 --> 01:56:34,383
Don't speak!

1314
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,847
l'll kill you!

1315
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,294
Daughter!

1316
01:57:54,133 --> 01:57:57,899
On that day you had
entered into my house!

1317
01:57:58,137 --> 01:58:00,037
This house!

1318
01:58:01,174 --> 01:58:06,134
lf my finger is cut even
my parents can't bear it

1319
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:09,574
They loved me that much
Me too!

1320
01:58:09,849 --> 01:58:13,046
Even then..You..!

1321
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:15,011
How much pain my
parents would have endured?

1322
01:58:15,154 --> 01:58:17,088
Leave me!
Come on tell, man!

1323
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:21,620
Playing with Carlos, is it? l will
push dagger in your stomach!

1324
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:24,526
Tell fellow!

1325
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:34,601
When cops and law disdained
saying there is no evidence

1326
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:37,643
On that day we had decided that
if you go and hide in any hell

1327
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:39,903
Will come there and lift you!

1328
01:58:40,146 --> 01:58:42,478
The life which you left,
thinking that they are dead

1329
01:58:42,682 --> 01:58:45,116
They regained the
consciousness on the 18th day

1330
01:58:46,486 --> 01:59:07,967
Temm DrC

1331
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:13,008
On regaining the consciousness,
the only identification told was

1332
01:59:13,212 --> 01:59:14,907
Your ear which was cut

1333
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:23,118
For the last 8 months we were
roaming in search of your cut ear

1334
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:34,762
We started the search from
a local thief in your native

1335
01:59:54,754 --> 01:59:58,588
That is how we reached to the
tutor of thieves, Kelu Ashan

1336
01:59:58,791 --> 02:00:01,726
Then after that to the thief Benny

1337
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:11,632
lnto the dark world
of theft and thieves

1338
02:00:11,804 --> 02:00:14,272
Embarked to search for you

1339
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:20,234
Did you think l'm dead? This is our
family matters, he is my nephew

1340
02:00:20,546 --> 02:00:22,571
l'll take you to an apt master

1341
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:25,809
What can l say?
Now l'm trapped is it?

1342
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:37,753
What is your name?
Manoj

1343
02:00:38,097 --> 02:00:40,930
Let me see for 2 days,
then will decide whether -

1344
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,797
- he can be taken along or not

1345
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:54,146
To remain with Benny ettan
we played several tricks

1346
02:01:12,164 --> 02:01:16,601
Even we went to 'Thieves village'
at Tamilnadu in search of you

1347
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:40,826
This is a news which appeared in an
evening newspaper on previous day

1348
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:44,121
On reading the intro of the news

1349
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:47,961
l felt a resemblance with the
murder of father and mother

1350
02:01:48,067 --> 02:01:49,659
The time of crime which
is mentioned in this -

1351
02:01:49,802 --> 02:01:50,962
- on taking other news papers

1352
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:53,698
Can't we get more
details on the case?

1353
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:17,987
DYSP, Ramadevan sir has
investigated that case during that time

1354
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:20,792
Tomorrow is the cross examination
of that case at the sessions

1355
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:23,198
Officer's sometimes take
the documents for court

1356
02:02:23,302 --> 02:02:25,236
They used to take it
to quarters or home

1357
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:29,307
lf we could some how examine that,
we'll get more details of the case

1358
02:02:30,209 --> 02:02:33,372
What is the job of this house
owner?. - Tutor, he is in police

1359
02:02:33,713 --> 02:02:36,113
DYSP special branch

1360
02:02:45,124 --> 02:02:48,252
Entered the 'booty room' of
the court it wasn't for theft

1361
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:55,065
l was in search of that metal torch
with which you had hit my father!

1362
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:05,904
Without anyone's
notice l hid everything

1363
02:03:06,312 --> 02:03:09,770
But at last l had to reveal
everything before one person

1364
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:17,220
l felt long back, your intention is
not to make money and learn theft!

1365
02:03:17,723 --> 02:03:20,248
Now you tell, what is the
meaning behind those -

1366
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,452
- burning ember in your eyes?

1367
02:03:39,178 --> 02:03:42,477
To do such a mercy less
act, that is him for sure

1368
02:03:43,115 --> 02:03:47,108
The Carlos with a cut ear, he
does not dare to do anything

1369
02:03:47,386 --> 02:04:04,828
Temm DrC

1370
02:04:05,237 --> 02:04:07,467
He should be
searched, not outside

1371
02:04:07,773 --> 02:04:10,970
He is in jail, on a
punishment on some case

1372
02:04:11,177 --> 02:04:13,941
Some how you must
get inside the jail

1373
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:21,817
As soon as you enter the jail, you
must speak everything to Benny

1374
02:04:21,954 --> 02:04:24,354
He will be there to help
you, he will do what is needed

1375
02:04:24,523 --> 02:04:28,823
Each of of us ended up in jail, it
was due to a meticulous planning

1376
02:04:30,396 --> 02:04:32,227
That one, is Carlos

1377
02:04:32,398 --> 02:04:36,232
ltem is our department
but the route is different

1378
02:04:41,407 --> 02:04:45,138
l'm a thief and l'll remain
only like that again

1379
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:48,441
As a brother l'll be always with you

1380
02:04:48,581 --> 02:04:52,073
Carlos chetta, new two joining
are there, both are young men

1381
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:59,517
Hey fellow, that is what l said, either
suicide or the other thing which l told

1382
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:02,186
Otherthan these 2 options
there is no way before us

1383
02:05:02,361 --> 02:05:04,522
You may decide what to do

1384
02:05:17,543 --> 02:05:19,408
Do you think l'm there for otherjob?

1385
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:20,944
Go man

1386
02:05:23,282 --> 02:05:25,216
This theft we are doing itjointly

1387
02:05:25,417 --> 02:05:27,442
Then whateverthat is gained

1388
02:05:27,586 --> 02:05:30,214
Will divide only in
3 shares, only 3 shares

1389
02:05:30,322 --> 02:05:31,880
That is enough

1390
02:05:32,925 --> 02:05:35,155
Each and every incidents
that took place inside the jail

1391
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:39,561
With the help of Benny chettan,
that was a trap set for you, Carlos!

1392
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:47,199
Man, we'll give a
hard blow on him!

1393
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,835
But it can't be done here

1394
02:05:50,342 --> 02:05:54,472
Each and every moments here are
under hundreds of camera surveillance

1395
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,239
Should lock him
when he comes outside

1396
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:07,018
Before executing
the verdict on you

1397
02:06:07,159 --> 02:06:10,424
That was the last evidence taken,
to make sure you are the murderer!

1398
02:06:10,896 --> 02:06:13,421
On that day, we took
you before Sheela

1399
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:18,931
Again we won't get such a chance

1400
02:06:19,104 --> 02:06:21,572
Before getting up,
finish him off right here

1401
02:06:21,674 --> 02:06:24,541
Forthat if there is any punishment
endured, we'll be there with you

1402
02:06:24,677 --> 02:06:26,907
Just kill this pig!

1403
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:29,110
Just wait for this day time

1404
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,013
Not here

1405
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:35,020
l want to get him in the same spot
where my parents were killed

1406
02:06:35,287 --> 02:06:37,482
On the their first death anniversary

1407
02:06:37,923 --> 02:06:39,220
On the same soil

1408
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:42,121
With his life, l must do
their after death rituals!

1409
02:06:42,328 --> 02:06:48,289
Temm DrC

1410
02:06:48,334 --> 02:06:50,495
Like how buffaloes pull the cart

1411
02:06:50,669 --> 02:06:54,105
Each action will bear its results that
will be followed without cease

1412
02:06:54,306 --> 02:06:58,140
At least in the next birth, you pray
to become a good human being

1413
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:00,644
The baptism which was
scheduled to be held at that time

1414
02:07:00,946 --> 02:07:03,039
We are going to do right now

1415
02:07:04,216 --> 02:07:08,050
Babutta, take that
honey to bathe him!

1416
02:07:31,543 --> 02:07:33,033
No need!

1417
02:07:33,545 --> 02:07:35,206
Fellow, no need!

1418
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:44,350
Fellow, didn't l say no need?

1419
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:48,184
Shut up you!

1420
02:07:52,564 --> 02:07:55,465
Carlos, sweetness is not over yet!

1421
02:07:57,202 --> 02:08:00,501
Fellows, what all are
you doing on me?

1422
02:08:01,707 --> 02:08:03,675
Hey Manoj, no need!

1423
02:08:08,213 --> 02:08:10,078
l'll go, man!

1424
02:08:26,298 --> 02:08:28,232
Sheela, take that one!

1425
02:09:15,447 --> 02:09:16,573
My god!

1426
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,625
Manoj!

1427
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:32,797
Hey man!

1428
02:09:37,469 --> 02:09:38,766

02:09:47,646 --> 02:09:49,341
No, no need!

1430
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:52,713
My god!

1431
02:09:56,522 --> 02:09:57,819
My god!

1432
02:10:05,664 --> 02:10:07,063
My god!

1433
02:10:18,744 --> 02:10:22,510
Manoj, no, no need, l'll go!

1434
02:10:29,254 --> 02:10:31,188
My god!
Hey fellow!

1435
02:10:31,356 --> 02:10:35,224
Please leave me, l'll go

1436
02:10:35,394 --> 02:10:37,487
My god, please don't do it!

1437
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:41,525
My god!

1438
02:10:46,271 --> 02:10:48,569
Please don't!

1439
02:10:52,311 --> 02:10:54,905
Please don't!

1440
02:10:57,549 --> 02:10:59,176
My god!

1441
02:11:10,295 --> 02:11:12,126
Hey man!

Please don't!
l'll go!

1443
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,564
Manoj!

1444
02:11:36,255 --> 02:11:38,723
Even on the dead bodies
of my father and mother

1445
02:11:40,259 --> 02:11:42,250
There were black ants

1446
02:11:44,796 --> 02:11:47,356
l couldn't see theirface

1447
02:11:47,833 --> 02:11:51,496
At that time l made it
sure, your decayed body

1448
02:11:51,637 --> 02:11:55,164
Alive, in raw! That it
should be fed for ants!

1449
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,968
You won't spared to give it to soil!

1450
02:12:01,213 --> 02:12:42,787
Temm DrC

1451
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:44,439
Temm DrC

1452
02:13:49,421 --> 02:13:51,048
Hey Janammoo!

1453
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:54,791
Go and get some water,
it is really hot

1454
02:13:55,093 --> 02:13:56,651
Hey lady Janammoo!

1455
02:13:57,095 --> 02:13:59,063
To teach the science of robbery

1456
02:13:59,364 --> 02:14:01,525
Kelu Ashan has
received a new follower

1457
02:14:01,666 --> 02:14:05,500
The regime of thieves
go on without an end

1458
02:14:05,637 --> 02:14:08,663
There are thieves who
are trained and un trained

1459
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:14,872
Some hi-tech thieves snatch lakhs
by sitting in government offices!

1460
02:14:15,013 --> 02:14:18,414
Some other thieves sell
out government budget

1461
02:14:19,151 --> 02:14:22,814
Some thieves are honoured
by academy award

1462
02:14:23,121 --> 02:14:24,554
And certain section of thieves

1463
02:14:24,689 --> 02:14:27,920
During the election on the grounds
where the huge arenas are set up

1464
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:32,427
They render speeches on promises
that can never be fulfilled!

1465
02:14:32,664 --> 02:14:39,593
lf at all required, government can
seriously think of a 'thief ministry'

1466
02:14:39,971 --> 02:14:44,874
As seen every where the
thief is present every where

1467
02:14:45,177 --> 02:14:47,805
Hey thief, you live forever!

1468
02:14:47,946 --> 02:14:49,971
You are me only!
