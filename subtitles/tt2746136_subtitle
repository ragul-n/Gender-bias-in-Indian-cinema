'..went to meet sister
Gurleen in the hotel.'

55
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:52,222
Gramps! - My child !

56
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,752
Hello, granny. - My child. Be happy.

57
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,890
Hello, aunt. - Hello, my child.

Mom's jealous.

00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,809
She didn't get a chance.

63
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,904
l'm not jealous. Act your age.

64
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:17,376
y ou wear such gaudy colored
clothes with such big flowers.

65
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,418
Enough ! - At least.. - Enough !

66
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,687
y ou guys forget that

00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:24,515
..fighting like mothers-in-law

00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,751
Okay. - Control yourself
at least over here.

70
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:28,259
Talk softly.
y ou.. - What ''talk softly''?

71
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,387
Stop fighting.

72
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,826
Tell her.

73
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:41,162
Dear, we...have good news for you.

We have fixed your
marriage with Vikram.

75
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,746
As soon as you finish college,
you'll get married.

76
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,406
And we will be.. - Free!

77
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,954
What is it, dear?
Aren't you happy with the news?

78
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,220
No.

79
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,753
Why? - Why?

80
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:01,658
l love Rajveer.

81
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,119
Rajveer? - Rajveer?

82
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,629
y es.

83
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,223
He's a nice guy. l want to marry him.

84
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,431
Before that we planned
to start a business together.

85
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,668
Gramps, please,
give me 50-60 lakh rupees.

86
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,211
l'll set my business
and also get married.

87
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,405
y ou will get rid of all your worries.

88
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,572
And then you'll be truly free!

89
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,445
y ou spoke just like your father.

90
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,887
Get this straight.

91
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:35,126
lf you wish to get married
to Vikram then come home.

92
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:44,631
lf you want to marry that
''50 lakh'' Rajveer then forget us.

93
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,145
Let's go, mother.

94
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,891
Grandpa..

95
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:24,677
lf sister Gurleen has found a
boy for herself then he must be nice.

96
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,306
God has been generous to us.

97
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:33,878
l agree uncle Surinder has
lost a lot of money in business.

98
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:35,887
But.. - Lost the money?

99
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,121
What about the
humiliation he caused us?

100
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:47,498
That's why this family
needs a nice boy like Vikram.

101
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:54,204
And it's also possible
that Rajveer fills in that void.

102
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:58,638
Grandpa, please give her Rs.
50 lakhs. Please.

103
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,202
Please.

104
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,216
Excuse me.

105
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:11,918
Hello?

106

y es, Preeti.

107
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:16,689
Sister Gurleen, since when
did you start hiding things from me?

108
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:18,856
What happened? What did l hide?

109
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,593
Oh, really?
What did you hide? Anyway, forget it.

110
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:26,904
Congratulations. Grandpa
has agreed to give you Rs. 50 lakhs.

111
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,270
Really? y es!

112
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,944
No! First tell me what my
brother-in-law Rajveer is like.

113
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,375
Brother-in-law Rajveer!

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,417

115
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:40,411
Tomorrow! - y es.

00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,953
Okay fine. l'll wait.

y es!

119
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,663
y our child life's is
no longer in danger, sir.

120
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,963
But she has gone into coma because
of the shock due to the accident.

121
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,835
'Even movies and novels
a twist in the story..'

122
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:36,898
'..doesn't come as
soon as it came in ours.'

123
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:43,476
'Sister Gurleen had
been in coma for 24 hours.'

124
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,649
'The news was in all the newspapers.'

125
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:52,550
'But l didn't know whether
or not brother-in-law Rajveer..'

126
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,923
'..knew about sister's accident.'

127
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,739
'Rajveer is a nice name.'

128
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,541
'But what kind of a brother-in-law
would he turn out to be?'

129
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,348
'Sister Gurleen's choice
can't be someone ordinary.'

130
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,280
'There must be something
special about him.'

131
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,551
'He has something special in him.'

132
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,433
Hi. - Hello.

133
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,666
Who are you? - Rajveer.

134
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:44,943
Brother-in-law!

Sister Gurleen is in coma!

136
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,346
He is handsome.

137
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,485
Damn you.

138
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,623
Girls these days don't
know how to pick the right guy.

139
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,328
Will you have something, son?

140
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,831
y ou must have not had
anything since morning.

141
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,565
The poor soul must be starving.

142
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,261
He came here in the afternoon.

143
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,534
He must've had something
at home in the morning.

144
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,498
Grandpa..

145
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,147
l think you were going out somewhere.

146
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,516
No. We are staying at home.

147
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:31,450
Well, the type of clothes
she is wearing l felt that you were..

148
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,557
She was Miss Chandigarh in 1 97 5.

149
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,501
Really? - She came in forth.

150
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,334
Poor thing wears such
clothes even to bed.

151
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:51,501
Really?

152
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:57,207
No problem, kiddo.
l'll teach you a lesson later.

153
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,583
By the way, what's for dinner?

154
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,713
Any vegetable? - Eggplants.

155
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,555
l don't eat eggplants.

156
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:15,231
No problem, son.
Bhola, scramble two eggs.

157
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,394
Go. - y es. That will be fine.

158
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,459
y es? lt's okay?

159
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:18,936
Listen..

160
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:25,171
Henceforth, you will never
cook eggplants in this house.

161
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,244
And what if someone
wants to eat eggplants?

162
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:30,577
Then you can go and have them outside.

163
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:33,611
Thank you.

164
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,415
Why are you thanking me, son?

165
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,482
y ou are our son-in-law.

166
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,488
Sorry.

167
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,592
No, it's okay, son.
lt's your house. y ou can burp again.

168
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:51,693
Brother-in-law, would you
like to have something sweet?

169
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:56,407
How can one have sweets
while Gurleen is in coma?

170
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,306
He said such a nice thing, didn't he?

171
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,868
Sir, how can it be nice?

172
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,679
He ate a bowl full of lentils.

173
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,377
Eight flatbreads
and four scrambled eggs.

174
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:06,913
How about a cup of tea?

175
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:10,287

Don't spare him, sir.
He ate a bowl full of lentils.

283
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,243
Because of you l

Hey, Mr. Potato, couldn't you

Brother-in-law, what happened next?

Beware if anyone raises
his voice against him.

He is an unmannered boy.

Calm down.

305
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:39,934
This was sister's room.

306
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:41,737

'This brother-in-law

333
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,387
'But grandpa didn't like him either.'

334
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,885
'Grandma had no interest in him.'

335
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:44,555
'She had found her Rajveer.'

336
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,256
'Mom thought he must
be the real Rajveer.'

That doesn't matter.

What matters is that
she reached that position.

350
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,527

00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,300
lf Gurleen would've been
here then stuffed bread..

354
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,946
y es. And give him a digestive powder.

355
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,613
He'll have it and go to sleep.

356
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,784
Son, we can quickly
prepare omelette for you.

357
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,483
We can pressure cook lentils as well.

358
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:43,947
Do you have buffaloes in here?

359
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,354
y es. Do you want to milk them?

360
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:51,623
No, l don't. l was just wandering
that if you have buffaloes..

361
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,460
..then there must be pure
clarified butter at home as well.

362
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:54,521
There is.

363
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,692
Then my day has been made.

364
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,497
Give me flatbread with
pure clarified butter. - Sure.

365
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,231
Should l mix sugar in it as well?

366
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,897
The fuss you are making
it would be better..

367
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,601
..if you just get it,
l'll mix it on my own.

368
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,771
Excuse me.

369
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,844
y ou don't need to apologise, son.

370
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,347
y ou are our son-in-law.

371
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:11,780
There is no need for formality.

372
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,181
By the way the pure clarified
butter was very tasty.

373
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:14,617
Well, it was made at home.

374
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:15,550
Really?

375
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,317
Sir, l think we should
throw him out as well.

376
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,453
We should listen to him.

377
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,487
Can l get a glass of milk, kiddo?

378
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,397
Well, l've heard my elders
say that if you have milk..

379
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:29,525
..after your meal then
it is good for digestion.

380
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:31,794
Right, gramps?

381
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,360
No gramps.

382
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,431
lt's okay, father.

383
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,674
Bhola. - y es.

384
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:43,237
Henceforth after a meal,
everyone in this house will have milk.

385
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,782
Brother-in-law, what do you do?

386
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,218
l sing. l am a singer.

387
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,148
He's artistic. - y es. y es.

388
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:53,750
Can l ask you something?
- y es, of course.

389
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:57,385
Brother-in-law,
how did you and sister Gurleen meet?

390
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,430
lt's a very interesting story.
- Please tell me.

391
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:05,302
Don't ask. Two strangers met
in such a way that they fell in love.

392
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:17,345
Brother, don't you know
that you are not allowed..

393
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,576
..to use your cell
phone at a gas station?

394
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,275
Just fill the tank with petrol.
Don't trouble me.

395
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:21,478
Shut up. Exactly.

396
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:22,815
Refuel my scooty first.

397
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,651
l'll refuel the tank of the
one who has given me 1 00 bucks.

398
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:25,815
Who gave me 1 00 bucks?

399
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,587
Mine, obviously.

400
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,418
Hello. l had just one
1 00 rupee note in my pocket.

401
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,484
Which l have given to you.

402
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,724
lt's obvious from your face
that you carry only one note.

403
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,232
The rest of them are
of denomination 1 000.

404
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,927
l don't have time
for a useless argument.

405
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,731
l don't have time to spare either.
- As if l do.

406
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:40,635
Just a minute, madam.
This 1 00 rupee note is yours?

407
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,602
Of course it is mine.

408
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:43,868
This girl is lying in broad daylight.

409
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:44,567
Don't you feel ashamed?

410
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,372
Don't you feel ashamed lying?

411
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,470
Just a minute, brother. Did your
note have any identity mark in it?

412
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,481
y es, of course.
Gandhi's photo is on it.

413
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,409
y ou are right about it.
The photo is on it.

414
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:54,952
That means it is yours. - Of course.

415
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,783
Whose photo will be
on it if not Gandhi? y ours?

416
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,254
lf Sanjay Dutt can his photo printed..

417
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,312
..then l too will have
mine printed on it one day.

418
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:00,551
Just a minute.
Just a minute. Just a minute.

419
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,324
Brother, let me do one thing.

420
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:05,295
l'll pour petrol worth Rs. 50 in
this bike and worth Rs. 50 in yours.

421
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,559
So if anyone suffers a
loss it will be only of Rs. 50.

422
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:08,860
l don't want to suffer a loss.

423
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:12,835
Madam, better suffer the
loss than get delayed indefinitely.

424
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,405
Get lost! - Don't trouble me.
- Get lost. - Monkey.

425
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:24,904
How do you know that?

426
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:26,684
He too looks like a fraud.

427
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,811
Tell me,
that 1 00 bucks belonged to whom?

428
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:32,514
That note belonged to Gurleen.

429
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,254
Heard that! Heard that! l told you so!

430
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,919
That money belonged sister for sure!

431
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:40,453
What difference does it make whether
Gurleen pays for it or Rajveer.

432
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:41,721
lt makes a difference.

433
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,925
Hey. How did you come to know that..

434
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,533
..that note belonged
to sister Gurleen?

435
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:47,762
Next day when l was rehearsing..

436
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,864
Mr. Maan, l've made an amazing song.
Should l sing it for you? Okay.

437
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:53,576
''The pain of separation..''

438
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,309
lt's amazing, isn't it, Mr. Maan?

439
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:59,910
''People will say..''

440
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:03,182
Hey, why are you crying
so early in the morning?

441
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:05,519
Here's your Rs. 1 00. - Rs. 1 00!

442
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,249
y ou are being very generous today.

443
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,657
ldiot, l am not being generous.

444
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:13,095
l had taken it out from
your pocket to pay the milkman.

445
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:15,892
This means it is my 1 00 rupees.

446
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,367
Then what! - Oh shit. Why didn't
you tell me about this earlier?

447
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:24,107
What ''Shit''?
What was there to tell you about it?

448
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:28,541
''Rent. Rent. Rent.'' l wonder
where you will take all your money.

449
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:29,637
Where are you going now?

450
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:31,238
l have to return her money.

451
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,648
Damn you. - l don't
like to keep anyone's money.

452
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,185
Except mine!

453
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:43,387
'..l, my bullet and my guitar left
to wander the streets of Chandigarh..'

454
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:45,521
'..to look for that beautiful
girl who was a stranger to me.'

455
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,358
'l had to wander a lot.'

456
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:51,835
'l went to many places.
Sector 1 7, Aroma. Sector 35, CCD.'

457
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:55,236
'l don't know.
lt was like l had lost my mind.'

458
00:29:56,675 --> 00:30:00,509
'l went to every place where
one can find girls in Punjab.'

459
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:04,407
'At snack stalls and burger joints.'

460
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:05,916
'But l didn't find
that girl anywhere.'

461
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,384
'l even went back to
that same pump station.'

462
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,318
'l thought perhaps we'll
meet where we fought.'

463
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,384
'But that girl didn't
show up there as well.'

464
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,621
'Then l thought
l should give the money..'

465
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:19,891
'..that doesn't belong to me, to God.'

466
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,296
'l wont be blamed for the sin.'

467
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,732
'Then l went to a Sikh
temple with that fifty rupees.'

468
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,664
'Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Lord Almighty.'

469
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,707
'Then l thought children
are also a form of God.'

470
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:42,948
'The ice-cream seller
wasn't giving them ice-cream.'

471
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,519
We want ice-cream !
We want ice-cream ! We want ice-cream !

472
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,652
Here, give them ice-cream.
Enjoy your ice-cream. - y eah !

473
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:10,681
Oh, my God. He is the same guy.

474
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,574
Did he come to the Sikh temple..

475
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,284
Give me my fifty rupees back!

476
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:17,952
The other day he took my money..

477
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,854
..and today he is
stealing money from kids.

478
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,521
He is coming towards me.

479
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,829
Come on, Gurleen.
Run. He looks like a loafer.

480
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,232
She is great! Wait!

481
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,845
l want to talk to you ! Stop!

482
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,477
She is crazy, l say! Hello!

483
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:48,746
Auntie! - Go trouble someone else!

484
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:52,956
She isn't listening to me! F ool !

485
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,919
Don't follow me!
- Doesn't your scooter have brakes?

486
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,472
Help! Help!

487
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,845
My brothers, a loafer is after me.

488
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,620
She is making a mistake.

489
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:31,921
What do you want, huh?

490
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,958
l don't play cricket.

491
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:34,459
y ou don't play cricket?

492
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,399
Aren't you ashamed to
trouble an innocent girl?

493
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:40,302
y ou are mistaken.
lt is not so. Hear me out.

494
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:40,929
What is wrong with you?

495
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,701
l'm telling you that you are mistaken.

496
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:45,242
Don't get hyper.
Hear me out. Otherwise..

497

Oh, my God.

y ou were following
to give me my money back?

501
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:35,251
lt was your money. Sorry,
l was mistaken at the gas station.

502
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,624
lt is my mistake.

503
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:38,854
Sorry. - y es.

504
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,726
Gurleen.

l'm Rajveer Singh.

506
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,295
Shall we? - y es, of course.

507
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:49,632
My only dream is to be
a top class businesswoman.

508
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,938
y es, that's a good thing.
One should have his own shop.

509
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,204
Please have a seat.

510
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:56,276
So, what is your future plan?

l want to cut an album.
l want to be a famous singer.

00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,352
Radio, television, wrestling grounds..

513
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,512
My songs should be played
everywhere in Punjab.

514
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:05,556
l want to be the next Gurdas Maan.

515
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,619

But for the time being

Which one? - Rotary club.

520
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,362
lf you don't mind,

Are you sure?

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,895
lf you want you can

523
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:20,864
Can l come there tonight?

afternoons and at night.

525
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:24,732
Great!

526
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,852
''She comes like the morning light.''

527
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,582
''And exits with a thunder.''

528
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,351
''She comes like the morning light.''

529
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:44,861
''And exits with a thunder.''

530
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,955
''She makes the bangles
around her fair wrist clink.''

531
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,693
''Oh, the way she moves her body..''

532
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,464
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

533
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,635
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

534
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:58,805
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

535
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,572
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

536
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:18,628
''Let me clap for the way you move,
beautiful.''

537
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,186
''Oh, beautiful.''

538
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:24,832
''Oh, beautiful.''

539
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,535
''Today, l'll cross all the limits.''

540
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,408
''Today, l'll go for the booty.''

541
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,407
''Today, l'll cross all the limits.''

542
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:39,814
''Today, l'll go for the booty.''

543
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,947
''y ou look hot in the red dress.''

544
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:44,653
''And with that lipstick..''

545
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:47,418
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

546
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:50,554
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

547
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:53,862
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

548
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,232
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

549
00:35:58,036 --> 00:35:59,663
''Hey, honey.''

550
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:02,673
''Are you ready?''

551
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:05,875
''Hey, honey.''

552
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,141
''Are you ready?''

553
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:16,780
''When this earring moves,
temperature soars.''

554
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:22,919
''When this earring moves,
temperature soars.''

555
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:27,395
''When l dance like crazy,
the floor shakes.''

556
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:33,235
''When l dance like crazy,
the floor shakes.''

557
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:35,534
''My delicate youth is praiseworthy.''

558
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:38,337
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

559
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:41,371
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

560
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,644
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

561
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:47,776
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

562
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:51,254
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

563
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:54,219
''She sets the dance floor on fire! ''

564
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,827
One more mocktail. - Okay.

565
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,365
Hey, are you out of your mind?

566
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:02,865
She is asking for mocktails
and you are giving her cocktails.

567
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,395
Now how will l handle
this drunken girl?

568
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,436
lt's your lookout.

569
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:06,629
''lt's your lookout.''

570
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:08,530
Everyone here seems to be crazy.

571
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,768
''She sets the dance floor
on fire! '' - y es. y es. y es.

572
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:13,903
lt might as well be my funeral fire.

573
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:18,707
Hey.

574
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,878
Matching. Matching. - y es, it matches.

575
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,659
A girl ! l won't spare him today!

576
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:41,665
y ou scoundrel !
y ou took a decent girl to your house!

577
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,331
y es. And that too
by getting her drunk!

578
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,603
She drank the liquor on her own.
l didn't get her drunk.

579
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,770
Don't spare him, sir. Shoot him.

580
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,472
He had a cup full of clarified butter.

581
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,746
y ou and sister in the same room !

582
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,875
Oh, how romantic!

583
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:54,714
What happened after that,
brother-in-law?

584
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:56,219
Hear that. Here her
brother-in-law is about to die..

585
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:57,311
..and she is still more
interested in the love story.

586
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:58,218
Help me, aunt. - y es. y es.

587
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:01,520
Don't spare him.
Break his neck. Break his neck.

588
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,561
Beware if anyone even touches him.

589
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:04,856
He is our son-in-law, father.

590
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,089
Thank you, aunt.

591
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:07,261
y ou don't need to thank me, son.

592
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:08,492
y ou are our son-in-law.

593
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,466
Do one thing. Go to your room.

594
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:11,559
We'll hear the whole story later.

595
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:12,728
Okay, hear it later.
- Come with me, brother-in-law.

596
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:13,828
l'll show you your room.

597
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,668
Hey, take him to
the servants' quarter.

598
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,900
Why are you being a
villain in this love story?

599
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:20,743
l will save you from grandma.
Don't worry.

600
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:21,870
y our grandpa is a hot-tempered man.
- Hey! Hey!

601
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,436
''Hey! Hey! ''

602
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,776
Enjoy. - Shut up.

603
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,406
Sit down, sir.

604
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:28,179
y ou are letting anyone who
knocks at the door into the house.

605
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,354
This was my room. Now it is yours.

606
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:36,450
Okay.

607
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:39,625
Sorry for whatever
that happened with you.

608
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:41,459
The thing is everyone is worried..

609
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:42,726
..because of what happened
to sister Gurleen.

610
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:46,199
l can understand.

611
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,567
y ou are bound to be worried.

612
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:50,201
l too am worried because of Gurleen.

613
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,746
l loved yours and sister
Gurleen's love story.

614
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,582
This starts playing on its own
whenever l see an interesting face.

615
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,413
lf you need anything then..

616
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,752
What are you saying?

617
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,557
ln such a situation,
when Gurleen is in the hospital..

618
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:14,761
l can have sliced fruits,
if l can get some.

619
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:28,342
''l miss you, Gurleen.''

620
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,144
''Where are you?''

621
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:37,853
Two Rajveers? !

622
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,183
This is a very tricky situation.

623
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:42,892
Which one do you like?

624
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,928
Both of them are useless. - Okay.

625
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:46,920
One went to her hotel room.

626
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:48,693
The other took her home.

627
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:51,631
Why don't you lodge
a police complaint?

628
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,728
l thought about it.

629
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,769
But l don't want Gurleen to become..

630
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:58,900
..a laughing stock
before she gets married.

631
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,806
Vikram had called me.

632
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:07,882
He was shocked to hear
about Gurleen's accident.

633
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:14,215
By the way,
Vikram always liked Gurleen.

634
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:19,292
l too like Vikram.

635
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:24,233
But we got into this
mess called Rajveer.

636
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,936
And this isn't just
one but two of them.

637
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:28,800
Two brothers-in-law? !

638
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:30,936
Both of them are handsome?

639
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:32,836
Are they really handsome?

640
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:34,804
Very handsome.

641
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,608
One wants to be a
fashion photographer.

642
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:37,909
And the other one
wants to be a singer.

643
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:41,247
We just can't make
out which one is real..

644
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:47,416
Look, you can keep the real one.

645
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:48,959
We are only concerned
with the fake one.

646
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,887
We will handle the rest.

647
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,753
Both their stories are awesome.

648
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,958
l think they are great love stories.

649
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:59,632
l pray, even if one of
them turn out to be fake..

650
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:01,604
..but the love stories
shouldn't be a lie.

651
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,833
So, when are you going to
introduce us to your brothers-in-law?

652
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:08,645
By then we will know
who has been lying..

653
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:10,544
..and who has been telling the truth.

654
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:13,413
This means we will party
with the real brother-in-law?

655
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,850
But how will we find
out which one is real..

656
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,582
We'll find out in a day or two.

657
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,892
When they'll come face to face.

658
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,526
'Then that day arrived when they
came face to face with each other.'

659
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,929
How are you, bro?

660
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,398
How are you doing?

661
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:37,965
lt's a vast piece of land, isn't it?

662
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,634
True. How big is this bungalow!

663
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,174
Bungalow? lt looks more like a colony.

664
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,678
They have a swimming pool.
Crazy people.

665
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,809
Didn't you have a look
at the basketball court? - y eah.

666
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:53,516
l've called you here
to tell you that today..

667
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,957
..both the brothers-in-law
have come face to face.

668
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,988
Today, we will find out
which one is the real Rajveer.

669
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,390
My Rajveer is the real one.

670
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,798
My Rajveer is the real one.

671
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,167
But sir, what are they talking about?

672
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:09,904
They look serious.
They must be planning a scheme.

673
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,333
There's a lot of land
surrounding it as well, right?

674
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:15,913
What must be the
price of this bungalow?

675
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,705
At least 5-6 crores.

676
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,581
And add the price of the land as well.

677
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:21,913
That totals up to around 50 crores.

678
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,849
That means their son-in-law
will at least get 8-1 0 crores.

679
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,154
Son-in-law? - l am Rajveer.

680
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,449
Their son-in-law.

681
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:33,190
Great. l, too, am Rajveer.
l, too, am their son-in-law.

682
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:36,593
The younger one's? Nice catch.

683
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:39,860
Gurleen is the younger one?
Hear that. No one told me.

684
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:42,937
Gurleen? l am Gurleen's Rajveer.

685
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:44,503
l am Gurleen's Rajveer, kiddo.

686
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:45,940
l am Gurleen's Rajveer.

687
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,944
Are you crazy?
l said l am Gurleen's Rajveer.

688
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:49,235
Get lost!

689
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:50,905
They have started fighting. - Rajveer.

690
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,383
y ou..

691
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,757
Hey! Let go of him.

692
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:02,590
Grandma, no.. - Hey!

693
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,651
Hit him with a brick.

694
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,890
y ou go on. Go on. Behind you.

695
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,625
y ou have come to ruin my plans!

696
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:09,927
Hit him. Hit him.

697
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:10,825
What are you thinking about?

698
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:12,927
y ou have the brick in your hand.
Hit it on his head.

699
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:15,529
Don't spare him. - Wait. Where
are you ! l'll teach you a lesson !

700
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,200
Hit him.
Hit him hard. - Brother-in-law!

701
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,710
Everyone has lost their minds!
Someone talk sense!

702
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:24,374
Sir! Sir, set them straight.

703
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:25,813
y ou are the head of this family.

704
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:27,350
l've brought your riffle with me.

705
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,715
Use it!

706
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,777
Why doesn't anyone stop them?

707
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:33,385
Now what is he up to?
He is going to shoot..

708
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,520
Only one of them is
sister Gurleen's Rajveer.

709
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,962
Now there is only
one way to find out..

710
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,503
..which out of them is the real one.

711
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:55,507
But grandpa,
this time you won't say anything.

712
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:57,474
And not even you, Bhola. Got it?

713
00:43:57,548 --> 00:43:59,778
What do l care?
Nurture the snakes if you want to.

714
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:02,651
Shut up.
y ou have started barking again.

715
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:07,151
Son, you go first.

716
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,124
Okay. Let me recall.

717
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,493
'1 st May, Sector 22 (Bus stop )'

718
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,735
'The goon starts following.'

719
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:22,702
'Thrashing (but of the real goons ).'

720
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,306
'Rickshaw.'

721
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,377
'Rickshaw fare.'

722
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:30,437
'Gurleen's l.D. card.'

723
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:31,943
'lnside girls' hostel.'

724
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,274
'Thief! Thief! '

725
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,309
'Punjab police.'

726
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:37,918
'lnside Gurleen's room.'

727
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:39,884
'Stays the night.'

728
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:45,489
Are you feeling scared of me?

729
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:47,795
How can l feel scared of you?

730
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:53,530
What do l tell you?
l've already told you everything.

731
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,868
Tell me something which you
would share with only a friend.

732
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,931
Do you have a special friend?
An affair?

733
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:01,336
Affair? l wish.

734
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:05,314
Only people with money
can have love affairs.

735
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,781
This is what you guys think.

736
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:10,753
Girls even like boys
who have no money.

737
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,812
Oh, really? Where are those girls?

738
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:14,886
l didn't find any.

739
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:17,126
Not even one?

740
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,922
Actually, there was one. Shalu.

741
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,597
But she stopped taking
my calls after she found out..

742
00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:27,136
..that l have no money with me.

743
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:34,768
l know that what happened
with you was not good.

744
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:39,271
But this doesn't mean that
girls like boys only for their money.

745
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,181
They can even like
you for your good nature.

746
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:49,619
ln reality, only successful people
can have successful love stories.

747
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:02,564
He is my friend.
He had come to return my l.D. card.

748
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,402
Any problem?

749
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:09,504
''l wish this moment
just stands still.''

750
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,206
y ou may leave.

751
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:17,752
''That it engulfs us is what l will.''

752
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,187
And yes..

753
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:30,160
''l wish this moment
just stands still.''

754
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:33,732
''That it engulfs us is what l will.''

755
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:37,568
''All my thoughts..''

756
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,904
''All my questions..''

757
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:45,380
''All my thoughts..''

758
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:48,944
''All my questions..''

759
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:53,280
''Hear what l desire! ''

760
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:19,749
''My love begins with
you and with you does it end.''

761
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:27,187
''My life belongs to you,
at your feet will it end.''

762
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:31,422
''y ou are the only one l desired.''

763
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:35,491
''y ou are the only one l acquired.''

764
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:39,360
''y ou are the only one l desired.''

765
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:42,868
''y ou are the only one l acquired.''

766
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,206
''y ou are my quest! ''

767
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,393
Rajveer, you have really gone crazy.

768
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:15,571
Any face you look at,
you see only Gurleen's face.

769
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,808
l am Gurleen. ldiot, l am Gurleen.

770
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:21,504
lt has been seven days!

771
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:24,673
y ou didn't try to contact
me after you left my hostel.

772
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,380
l didn't contact you on purpose.

773
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,577
Why?

774
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,880
l fell in love with you that night.

775
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,691
l thought if you love
me as much as l love you..

776
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,285
..then you will find me.

777
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:42,832
And would you have forgotten
me if l wouldn't have found you?

778
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:47,628
l cannot control my love.

779
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:54,805
l love you, Rajveer.

780
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,315
This is what l desire as well,
but not so soon.

781
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:07,279
l want to be a top
class fashion designer.

782
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,552
l want open a studio of my own.

783
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:19,428
We will fulfil our dreams together.

784
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:22,268
Good idea.

785
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,237
Bad idea.

786
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,865
This scoundrel will run away with Rs.
50 lakhs.

787
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,410
Nonsense!
l want to fulfil my Gurleen's dream.

788
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:28,877
Gurleen is mine.
Then why will you fulfil her dream?

789
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:30,373
Gurleen is mine and
she will always be mine.

790
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,377
Slap him. - Get this straight.
- y ou scoundrel..

791
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,650
l've caught him. Don't worry.

792
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,894
l won't leave him.
He's weaving fake stories.

793
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,366
Kamal ! - Break!
Break! Grandma fell down !

794
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:53,300
Take care of your grandma.
- Grandma fell down.

795
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,463
Are you alright?
- Oh, my God. - Help her up quickly.

796
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:02,474
Let go of me.
Get him. - Bhola! - Don't worry.

797
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:04,779
Come on, now.
- Photographer, my face..

798
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:09,649
y ou guys have lost your minds
completely. - Don't spare him.

799
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:27,397
Hi. - Hello.

800
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:28,965
Who are you?

801
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:32,271

802
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,736
Oh, my God. Another love story!

803
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,263
''This is our love story, my friend.''

804
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:50,432
''This is our love story, my friend.''

805
00:51:01,117 --> 00:51:03,415
l'm Rajveer.

806
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:05,852
Which Rajveer?
How can you be Rajveer?

807
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:06,752
Excuse me?

808
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,689
Why? Have you copyrighted this name?

809
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:15,420
No. He is Rajveer. The real one.

810
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:17,966
No, he is the real Rajveer. - Right.

811
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:20,199
He is Rajveer. - He is Rajveer.

812
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:22,999

00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:24,061
He is Rajveer.
- l said he is Rajveer.

814
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,971
Oh God. - Where are you going?

815
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,169
At least tell us your love story.

816
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:31,075
Love story? !

817
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:33,843
y es, brother. Tell her
your love story before you leave.

818
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,781
Otherwise, she won't be able to eat.

819
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,153
Just a minute.
All of you get together, please.

820
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,417
What? - Why?

821
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:42,884
l wanted to take a snap.

822
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:45,689
He's clicking a snap. - Photo.

823
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:53,663
Thank you.

824
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:55,904
l've never seen so many crazy
people together, at one place.

825
00:51:57,974 --> 00:51:59,669
l am lost.

826
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:02,770
l saw a bungalow and
l thought l'll seek direction.

827
00:52:02,845 --> 00:52:05,211
So, you are not Gurleen's Rajveer?

828
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,043
Now who is this Gurleen?

829
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:13,088
We'll guide you to the right path.

830
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:14,452
y es. Come on. Rajveer.

831
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:19,194
By the way, which one
of you is the real Rajveer?

832
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,287
l am Rajveer, brother.
He is a fraud.

833
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,353
l wonder where he came from.

834
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,922
l am the real Rajveer.
He is a thief. l know that.

835
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:26,798
He must be Rajveer.
But l am Gurleen's Rajveer.

836
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:28,427
He.. - Rajveer..
y ou know l am Rajveer.

837
00:52:28,504 --> 00:52:29,698
l am Rajveer.

838
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,200
Do you think those guys are fools?
l'll show you.

839
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,037
Shall l show you?
Shall l? - lt's okay. lt's okay.

840
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,043
Stupid. - lt's okay. lt's okay.

841
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:36,742
By the time the climax approaches..

842
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:38,177
..we will know who
is the real Rajveer.

843
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:40,841
Okay? Thank you.

844
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:41,742
Goodbye.

845
00:52:41,817 --> 00:52:44,149
'Rajveer. Rajveer. Rajveer.'

846
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,354
'This is the only name
resounding in the house.'

847
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:50,453
'A lost traveler who
came home was also Rajveer.'

848
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,985
'l pray sister soon regains

849
00:52:54,063 --> 00:52:56,827
consciousness so that we know
the truth.'

850
00:52:57,233 --> 00:53:00,100
'Oh, sister. l miss you so much.'

851
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:03,263
'y ou know, whenever sister
Gurleen and l were together..'

852
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:05,034
'..we used to have a lot of fun.'

853
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:07,808
'She used to bring
the whole house down.'

854
00:53:10,046 --> 00:53:14,278
'Sister Gurleen always treated
a fool like me like a beauty queen.'

855
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:40,432
'l used to pray to God,
day and night..'

856
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:42,904
'..that my sister should
soon regain consciousness.'

857
00:53:43,212 --> 00:53:45,146
'And that she gets her true love.'

858
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:57,224
Who is this boy? He comes every day,
keeps a bouquet and leaves.

859
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:59,318
l think he loves her a lot.

860
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:22,874
So Preeti, today is your birthday.

861
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:24,681

00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:29,089
No. lt has been a week. l didn't even
realize and my birthday is here.

863
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:32,321
We still don't know
who is real and who isn't.

864
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:35,853

919
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,644
'..more as their
son than a son-in-law.'

920
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:26,827

'But how could l forget that?'

923
00:58:36,872 --> 00:58:38,999
Hi. - Hello.

Excuse me!

y our love story remains incomplete.

931
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:05,299
Well, no one really
heard my love story.

932
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:07,062
Everyone heard that
liar's love story.

933
00:59:07,703 --> 00:59:10,263
Gurleen is in the hospital.
l am worried about her.

934
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:13,834
Why should l forget about it?

935
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:15,001
Please tell me.

936
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:18,069
Please tell me what happened when

937
00:59:18,147 --> 00:59:19,375
To your house.

00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:20,415
y ou really want to hear it?

939
00:59:20,716 --> 00:59:22,149
Of course. Really.

Okay.

942
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:32,619
'Whom does the Rs.1 00
note belong to?'

943
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:35,191
'This belongs to me.'

944
00:59:35,464 --> 00:59:37,261
'ln search of the girl.'

945
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:40,667
'Madam, your money.'

946
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:42,727
'This goon is following me.'

947
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:48,272
'Singing and dancing.'

948
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:50,273
'Patiala peg.'

949
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,206
'Sloshed.'

950
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:54,180
'ln the room...'

951
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:57,278
y ou never let me live in peace,
at least let me sleep in peace.

952
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:00,719
No, aunt. l'm asleep.
l came back in the evening.

953
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:02,256
He is a liar..

954
01:00:02,324 --> 01:00:03,621
l came back in the evening.

955
01:00:04,026 --> 01:00:06,392
Scoundrel, you don't
have a penny in your pocket..

956
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,988
Who have you brought home now?

957
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:09,689
What girl?

958
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:10,999
Where is she?
- Right here. Right here.

959
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,397
Where? - Here. Here.. - Where?

960
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:13,998
Have a look at least. - Where?

961
01:00:14,803 --> 01:00:15,235
Here. Here

962
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:17,135
Where is the girl?
Where is the girl, tell me.

963
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,031
That's the reason
l don't give you rent.

964
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:20,234
l'll get your eyes operated.

965
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:22,142
l'll get my eyes operated on my own.

966
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:24,076
Just pay me the rent, damn you.

967
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,811
This is my Versace coat.

968
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:28,312
She has vanished. Where did she go?

969
01:00:41,196 --> 01:00:42,993
What is it? Can't sleep?

970
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,194
No, l am sleepy.

971
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:47,426
But there is just one bed
and there are two people to sleep.

972
01:00:47,736 --> 01:00:48,828
That's the reason l am not sleeping.

973
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,865
l am sorry.
- No, it is not your fault.

974
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,136
Why are you apologizing?

975
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,734
lt's the bartender's fault.

976
01:00:57,045 --> 01:00:58,205
y ou were asking for mocktails.

977
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,407
And that crazy,
lunatic kept giving you cocktails.

978
01:01:01,016 --> 01:01:02,040
Stupid.

979
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,982
My dress?

980
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:06,818
y ou vomited on it, so l..

981
01:01:07,156 --> 01:01:09,090
Don't worry. Don't worry at all.

982
01:01:09,158 --> 01:01:10,420
l swear, l just used my hands.

983
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,187
l changed your clothes with
my eyes shut.

984
01:01:19,368 --> 01:01:20,801
How sweet.

985
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:26,066
l always wanted a life
partner like you in my life.

986
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,269
l think you are a very sweet guy,
Rajveer.

987
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:30,709
Huh?

988
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:31,843
l love you.

989
01:01:31,914 --> 01:01:32,903
Love you !

990
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:39,276
Oh, my! So proud of you,
sister Gurleen.

991
01:01:39,354 --> 01:01:40,878
How romantic!

992
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,948
What happened next?

993
01:01:43,025 --> 01:01:43,753
What else could have happened?

994
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:47,091
l told Gurleen that l cannot marry
her till l don't get Rs. 50 lakhs.

995
01:01:47,429 --> 01:01:48,896
l need to cut an
album as well, right?

996
01:01:48,964 --> 01:01:50,329
y es, it would cost you that much.

997
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,765
Hear that.
y ou and Gurleen say the same things!

998
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,268
This is what she said as well.

999
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:57,669
She told me not to worry. We will
take Rs. 50 lakhs from grandfather.

1000
01:01:58,307 --> 01:02:00,867
But gramps doesn't consider
me as his son-in-law.

1001
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:03,435
But l consider you
as my brother-in-law.

1002
01:02:03,745 --> 01:02:08,273
l knew it. Sister Gurleen would
choose an artistic person like you.

1003
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,874
That means you trust me?

1004
01:02:09,952 --> 01:02:12,944
l trust sister Gurleen's choice.

1005
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:16,489
Because if you wouldn't have
been sister Gurleen's choice..

1006
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:18,721
..then you wouldn't
have been my choice either.

1007
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:24,993
Huh?

1008
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:27,862
Sorry.

1009
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:30,171
Excuse me, check please.

1010
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:31,838
Come on.

1011
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,936
No, l've my scooty with me.

1012
01:02:36,011 --> 01:02:38,070
A scooty ride is no
match to a bullet ride.

1013
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:39,741
Anyway, some other time.

1014
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:40,713
l just have to go home.

1015
01:02:40,782 --> 01:02:41,908
Okay, fine.

1016
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:43,042
Okay, see you.

1017
01:02:44,786 --> 01:02:47,311
Billa. At least listen to me.

1018
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,321
Where you calling out to him? - y es.

1019
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:52,052
His name is Rajveer.

1020
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:54,755
Rajveer? His name is Billa.

1021
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,229
l have to take Rs. 50,000.

1022
01:02:56,298 --> 01:02:57,959
He's a thug from Sector 1 9.

1023
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:01,902
He isn't Billa.
He's Rajveer. y ou are mistaken.

1024
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:04,934
Rajveer? l must be mistaken then.

1025
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,302
This is the story of my life.

1026
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,047
My parents died when
l was just a child.

1027
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:16,851
lt's okay. lt's okay.
God has made the right match.

1028
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:20,980
This family needed a son
and you needed parents, right?

1029
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:25,184
l can see a mother in you, but
l don't see a father in Mr. Brar.

1030
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,192
He is always so angry.

1031
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,126
No. He is very good at heart.

1032
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:29,026
y es.

1033
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,359
Have you ever seen a coconut?

1034
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,232
lt's so hard from outside,
yet so soft inside.

1035
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,301
He can't help it.

1036
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:40,432
After suffering a lot,
following the ways of the world..

1037
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:42,305
..he has become a little harsh.

1038
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:51,351
Our young son suffered a
loss in business and shot himself.

1039
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:01,924
lt's okay.
God has answered our prayers.

1040
01:04:01,997 --> 01:04:03,794
He has sent you.

1041
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:07,729
l love cauliflower.

1042
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:11,296
Okay.

1043
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,073
Then we'll make cauliflower today.

1044
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:18,345
This is great, son.
y ou got all my work done today.

1045
01:04:18,413 --> 01:04:19,903
y ou are a very nice boy.

1046
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:22,917
y ou understand that but
l wonder why grandpa doesn't.

1047
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,715
Son, he is not bad at heart.

1048
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:31,089
y ou know when Preeti's married
someone else and went to UK..

1049
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,251
A young girl came back
to her parents' house.

1050
01:04:34,896 --> 01:04:37,831
Poor father had to
bear everyone's taunts.

1051
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,428
But he never told me to
go back to my in-laws' house.

1052
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:45,838
He always keeps thinking
about only one thing.

1053
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:52,075
That this family never
had a nice son or a son-in-law.

1054
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:57,250
But now l feel that you
will fulfil this wish of his.

1055
01:04:57,886 --> 01:04:59,183
y ou will, won't you?

1056
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:01,786
l love peas.

1057
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:02,949
Today we will cook peas.

1058
01:05:05,093 --> 01:05:06,060
y es, cottage cheese
with peas is fine.

1059
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:07,288
l'll start right away. - Okay.

1060
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:08,318
Mother..

1061
01:05:08,397 --> 01:05:09,421
Meal is being served? !

1062
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,431
l seek your blessings, Mr. Brar.

1063
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,765
He is seeking your blessings.

1064
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:18,669
l heard him. - Here you go.

1065
01:05:19,074 --> 01:05:20,234
l seek your blessings, Mr. Brar.

1066
01:05:21,176 --> 01:05:22,404
He is seeking your blessings,
father.

1067
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:23,774
Sir heard him.

1068
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:25,210
But he didn't touch his feet.

1069
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,808
y ou know today,
Rajveer help me shop for groceries.

1070
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,876
And my Rajveer helped
me arrange everything.

1071
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:33,284
Then you should have
asked them to cook as well.

1072
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:35,414
Shut up. He always keeps barking.

1073
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,021
He is being pampered a lot.

1074
01:05:37,826 --> 01:05:39,123
What happened?

1075
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,720
Have some water. - Give him some
water. - What is wrong with him?

1076
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:44,691
Thank you.

1077
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,701
He said thank you.
- He said thank you.

1078
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:52,429
Rascals, why don't you tell me which
one of you is the real Rajveer?

1079
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,766
They are causing unnecessary
mess in our life.

1080
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,375
Aren't you ashamed
of being freeloaders?

1081
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,340
l wonder from where
have these scoundrels come.

1082
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,157
Sonam, listen to me.

1083
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:16,225
Grandpa, too,
like the rest of the family..

1084
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:18,664
..is getting emotionally
attached to both of them.

1085
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:24,032
Do one thing. There is a person
called Billa in Sector 1 9's market.

1086
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:25,363
Get some information about him.

1087
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:36,682
Mr. Brar, l've fixed Vikram's
marriage with a girl from Canada.

1088
01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:40,921
Vikram likes the girl?

1089
01:06:42,057 --> 01:06:44,218
No. l kind of forced him.

1090
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,424
Vikram hasn't even seen
the girl's photograph as yet.

1091
01:06:47,896 --> 01:06:49,261
Dharma.. - y es?

1092
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:53,165
y esterday,
both Rajveers sought my blessing.

1093
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,270
l didn't say anything.

1094
01:06:57,105 --> 01:06:59,198
l felt what l did was
right at that moment..

1095
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:01,773
..but l am feeling bad about it now.

1096
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,003
y ou did the right thing.

1097
01:07:04,346 --> 01:07:05,904
One of them is a fraud.

1098
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,242
Till we don't find out
which one of them is real..

1099
01:07:10,185 --> 01:07:12,176
..you shouldn't mellow down, Brar.

1100
01:07:12,888 --> 01:07:14,412
y ou are right.

1101
01:07:15,056 --> 01:07:16,182
l have thought of something.

1102
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,153
l think you should
throw both of them out.

1103
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:23,388
Call both of them when
Gurleen regains consciousness.

1104
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:27,330
The real one who show
up the fake will run away.

1105
01:07:29,037 --> 01:07:34,304
The two females who
keep babying them..

1106
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,738
'Grandpa liked what
uncle Dharmpal said.'

1107
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:41,213
'And he decided to throw
both the Rajveers out of the house.'

1108
01:07:42,384 --> 01:07:46,878
'Mom said, give my Rajveer Rs.
50 lakhs before he leaves.'

1109
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:51,221
'Grandma said,
if my Rajveer leaves this house..'

1110
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:53,227
'..then he'll leave only with Rs.
50 lakhs in his hand.'

1111
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:56,329
'Grandpa wasn't ready
to listen to both of them.'

1112
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,758
'Now all three of them
were acting stubborn.'

1113
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:02,701
'The question was who will
be the first one to give in.'

1114
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:09,208
'Grandma and mom used a weapon
which would make anyone give in.'

1115
01:08:10,445 --> 01:08:12,436
'Hunger strike.'

1116
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,883
Hello. - Hi.

1117
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:16,975
Grandma isn't here?

1118
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:19,776
Doesn't she want to eat today?

1119
01:08:22,023 --> 01:08:24,890
Anyway, she should
avoid food at this age.

1120
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:29,394
Check, aunt must
have started dieting.

1121
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:30,990
Miss Punjaban is coming up.

1122
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,227
Neither is grandma fasting
nor is aunt dieting.

1123
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:36,693
They have gone on a hunger strike.

1124
01:08:38,106 --> 01:08:39,266
Hunger strike? !

1125
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:43,937
Both say their Rajveer should be
given Rs. 50 lakhs before they leave.

1126
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,047
But what difference
does it make to you.

1127
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,747
y ou guys eat. Eat.

1128
01:08:57,892 --> 01:09:00,725
And for you there is
spinach with cottage cheese.

1129
01:09:02,364 --> 01:09:03,729
Please eat.

1130
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:14,072
l'll have the rice pudding.

1131
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:16,673
l, too, will have spinach
with cottage cheese.

1132
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,154
l'll go and have it in my room.

1133
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,997
y ou seem to be in a bad mood.
l, too, will eat in my room.

1134
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:39,033
See you.

1135
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,706
So, what is it,
why didn't you have lunch?

1136
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:57,942
l don't want to eat. - Why?

1137
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,054
Everyone thinks l am a fool.

1138
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:02,214
Bloody monkeys.

1139
01:10:03,358 --> 01:10:06,725
l said, ''Give the boy Rs.
50 lakhs, he'll start his business.''

1140
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:08,353
But no, he is acting stubborn.

1141
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,998
y ou are right. We need the money.

1142
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:12,226
But we can't stop eating.

1143
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,790
l don't want to eat. That's final.

1144
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:18,036
Why are you doing so, son?

1145
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:19,630
Those who are lying should not eat.

1146
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:21,201
Why should we stop eating?

1147
01:10:22,077 --> 01:10:23,009
Eat.

1148
01:10:23,078 --> 01:10:23,908
l should?

1149
01:10:23,978 --> 01:10:25,445
y es. Eat.

1150
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,071
l am starving.

1151
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:29,843
Open your mouth.

1152
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:32,278
Open your mouth.

1153
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:36,282
l was not eating so that
our case doesn't get weak.

1154
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,349
We'll get the money and
we'll win the case as well.

1155
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:40,456
Start eating. Come on.

1156
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,859
l should?

1157
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:45,195
l'll feed my aunt.
How can my aunt stay hungry?

1158
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,161
Come on, open your mouth.

1159
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:51,771
Tasty, huh?

1160
01:10:54,843 --> 01:10:57,437
Grandpa, please eat.

1161
01:10:58,246 --> 01:10:59,304
l'm not in the mood.

1162
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,777
By the way both your wife
and your daughter have eaten.

1163
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:09,380
Really? ! So,
l am twirling stick for no reason?

1164
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:20,795
Grandpa, why don't
you give them the money?

1165
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:25,831
What are you saying?
One of them is lying.

1166
01:11:26,775 --> 01:11:28,333
But one of them is
telling the truth as well.

1167
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,236
Why are we troubling the
one who telling the truth..

1168
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:32,142
..because of the one who is lying.

1169
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:35,914
God has been very generous to us.

1170
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:39,276
What difference will it make
if one person takes the money?

1171
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:42,151
Please.

1172
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:44,117
Please.

1173
01:11:44,192 --> 01:11:45,454
One last time.

1174
01:11:55,904 --> 01:11:59,806
l am giving both of you Rs.
50 lakhs each.

1175
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:00,272
Take it.

1176
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:02,138
l've been working
here since two years.

1177
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,734
y ou didn't give
me a raise of Rs. 500.

1178
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:06,144
How can you give Rs.
50 lakhs to these frauds?

1179
01:12:09,184 --> 01:12:12,153
Hello? y es. y es! y es!

1180
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:14,482
Sir, don't give them any money.

1181
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,814
Sister Gurleen has
regained consciousness.

1182
01:12:20,895 --> 01:12:21,793
Really!

1183
01:12:27,702 --> 01:12:32,264
The fake Rajveer out
of you two is done for.

1184
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:37,410
Gurleen, tell me,
which one of them is your Rajveer.

1185
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,709
The one you had chosen
as your life partner.

1186
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:41,675
What are you saying !

1187
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,110
Gurleen,
he is your Rajveer, isn't he?

1188
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:45,447
Tell them, Gurleen.

1189
01:12:48,389 --> 01:12:51,358
Try to recognize him, dear.
He is the real Rajveer, right?

1190
01:12:51,726 --> 01:12:54,217
No. - What are you saying?
- No, dear. He is Rajveer.

1191
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:56,320
He isn't Rajveer. - Look carefully.
- He is. - He is the real one.

1192
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:58,228
No, he is. - He is the real one.

1193
01:12:58,299 --> 01:13:00,199
He is. - l said he is the real one.

1194
01:13:00,268 --> 01:13:00,825
She is causing unnecessary chaos.

1195
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:02,267
Shut up, both of you !

1196
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:06,138
Tell me, dear. Tell me the truth.

1197
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,850
l had told you so. Saw?

1198
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:22,389
l said l am Rajveer, but
you were not ready to listen to me.

1199
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:25,226
The finger's pointing this way.

1200
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:28,160
y es. This one.

1201
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:30,824
Saw? She came forth.

1202
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:32,699
y es, dear. He is the real Rajveer.

1203
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:35,669
Go, son. Go and give her a hug. Go.

1204
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:37,803
Hurry up.

1205
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:43,071
Who are you?

1206
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:53,785
Mr. Brar,
l think Gurleen has lost her memory.

1207
01:13:55,323 --> 01:13:57,086
And she is suffering from amnesia.

1208
01:13:57,959 --> 01:14:00,393
lt has been seen that many at
times in such cases when patients..

1209
01:14:00,461 --> 01:14:04,124
..come out of coma, it takes them
some time to recall their memory.

1210
01:14:04,532 --> 01:14:07,399
y es, if you want,
you can take her home.

1211
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:12,399
'Now we were in a position which in
English is called back to square one.'

1212
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:16,468
'Sister has regained consciousness
but had lost her memory.'

1213
01:14:17,045 --> 01:14:21,175
'But my friend had found
the house of Billa from Sector 1 9.'

1214
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:26,310
Over here?

1215
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:40,364
Hi. - Hello, my child.

1216
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:43,103
Tell me, whom do you wish to meet?

1217
01:14:44,172 --> 01:14:47,300
Well, we wanted to meet Billa.

1218
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:51,072
Billa? Don't mention
that dog's name before me!

1219
01:14:51,879 --> 01:14:53,813
What work do you have
with that scoundrel?

1220
01:14:54,415 --> 01:14:59,819
He left 20 days ago. l'll
break his bones if he comes back.

1221
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,416
He owes me three months' rent.

1222
01:15:04,492 --> 01:15:07,757
How much is three months' rent?

1223
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:09,990
Rs. 1 2000, you know.

1224
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:14,724
l'll pay the rent.

1225
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:18,903
l just want to know
whether your Billa..

1226
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:22,033
..and our Rajveer
are the same person.

1227
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,301
l'll tell you everything
in detail, later.

1228
01:15:24,379 --> 01:15:27,246
l just wanted to see his room once.

1229
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:19,163
Here you go.
Sister Gurleen's breakfast.

1230
01:16:19,233 --> 01:16:20,427
Thanks, Preeti.

1231
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:26,067
Oh, my God. y ou remember my name.

1232
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:29,075
Talk softly or else grandma
and aunt will come here.

1233
01:16:30,845 --> 01:16:33,075
Oh, my God. y ou remember everything.

1234
01:16:33,147 --> 01:16:34,774
y es, l remember everything.

1235
01:16:34,849 --> 01:16:37,784
And l also remember that
there was no Rajveer in my life.

1236
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:40,320
What? - y es,
there is no Rajveer in my life.

1237
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,151
Then why did you lie to grandpa?

1238
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,919
l thought he is pressurizing
me to get married.

1239
01:16:44,992 --> 01:16:47,392
He thought l won't
be able to do business.

1240
01:16:47,695 --> 01:16:49,162
That's the reason l lied to him.

1241
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:53,428
Rajveer was just a figment of
my imagination and not in my life.

1242
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:57,335
Then why Rs. 50 lakhs?
- l needed them, for myself.

1243
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:02,808
lf Rajveer was just a
figment of your imagination..

1244
01:17:02,877 --> 01:17:04,344
..then how did these two come here?

1245
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,771
y es. Come, lets ask these Rajveers.

1246
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,373
Let's go.

1247
01:17:15,356 --> 01:17:17,119
How is my baby?

1248
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,086
God may delay things a little
but he will set things straight.

1249
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,897
y ou will remember everything.

1250
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:26,024
How much we used
to love each other. y es.

1251
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,829
y ou should just have your
medicines on time, let me tell you.

1252
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:29,335
Otherwise l will get angry with you.

1253
01:17:29,704 --> 01:17:30,898
My baby.

1254
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,932
Everything will be fine, Gurleen.

1255
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,003
y ou will recall everything.

1256
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:50,716
l am not crying.
Something went into my eye.

1257
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:53,118
God is teaching a lesson, sinner.

1258
01:17:54,061 --> 01:17:55,392
Move away, both of you !

1259
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,260
There is no Rajveer in my life.

1260
01:17:57,331 --> 01:17:59,925
Who are the two of you and
how did you end up in this bungalow?

1261
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:03,327
l'll tell you.

1262
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:07,136
He is Mr. Billa from Gogi market.

1263
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:13,444
And has not paid rent to his landlady
since the last three months.

1264
01:18:16,184 --> 01:18:18,448
So, now will you tell
us something about yourself?

1265
01:18:21,455 --> 01:18:23,047
ln comparison l am..

1266
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:28,718
Now tell me how did you
end up in this bungalow.,

1267
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,857
Tell me now..

1268
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:36,298
Or l'll ask grandpa
to come with his rifle.

1269
01:18:42,276 --> 01:18:46,440
'Now the real story.'

1270
01:18:46,981 --> 01:18:48,778
y es, Preeti.

1271
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:52,753
What happened? What did l hide?

1272
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,256
Oh, really? What did you hide?
Anyway, forget it.

1273
01:18:56,858 --> 01:19:00,624
Congratulations. Grandpa
has agreed to give you Rs. 50 lakhs.

1274
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:02,154
Really? y es!

1275
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:06,758
No! First tell me what my
brother-in-law Rajveer is like.

1276
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:08,028
Brother-in-law Rajveer!

1277
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:10,293
l'll tell you later. Bye.

1278
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,343
Girls, good news.
Grandpa has agreed.

1279
01:19:17,845 --> 01:19:22,248
My job is done.

1280
01:19:22,817 --> 01:19:26,253
l had lied to him that there
is a boy named Rajveer in my life.

1281
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,221
And l need Rs.
50-60 lakhs to start a business.

1282
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:30,154
And he has agreed.

1283
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,324
'Mr. Brar's granddaughter
in coma after car accident.'

1284
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:41,764
Both of you have a lot of courage.

1285
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,160
Poverty teaches you
how to have courage.

1286
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:49,273
When l couldn't find another
way to fulfil my dream l chose this.

1287
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:52,338
l didn't want to do all this.
l am an artist.

1288
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,073
But l knew that in
life no matter what l do..

1289
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:57,208
..l'll never be able to
get enough money to cut an album.

1290
01:19:57,785 --> 01:20:01,084
l learned that you deceived your
grandpa for the sake of your

1291
01:20:01,155 --> 01:20:02,782
happiness..
l, too, did it for my happiness.

1292
01:20:03,224 --> 01:20:05,385
lf you want you can
call for your grandfather.

1293
01:20:07,228 --> 01:20:08,889
But l know you won't do that.

1294
01:20:09,797 --> 01:20:11,389
Because then your
lie will also be caught.

1295
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,233
y es. Call him if you want to.

1296
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:16,626
What do both of you want?

1297
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:18,902
The same that we wanted earlier.

1298
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:20,167
All we want is money. That's all.

1299
01:20:22,009 --> 01:20:24,409
Money. y ou will get the money.

1300
01:20:25,046 --> 01:20:27,037
But both of you will have
to leave in the middle of the night.

1301
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,775
And you will never
show your faces again.

1302
01:20:30,918 --> 01:20:32,215
ls Rs. 5 lakhs enough?

1303
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:35,278
Hello, madam ! Rs. 5 lakhs?
Do we look like thieves to you?

1304
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:40,056
True. They aren't thieves, Gurleen.
They are thugs.

1305
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:46,088
Give me Rs. 30 lakhs.

1306
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,293
Only Rs. 30 lakhs?

1307
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:51,168
Okay. l, too, am fine with it.
Give me Rs. 30 lakhs.

1308
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:53,235
30. Done on 30.

1309
01:20:53,774 --> 01:20:54,934
y ou will get them.

1310
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,311
But after that never
show me your face again.

1311
01:21:09,957 --> 01:21:11,049
Here's your bag.

1312
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:13,423
l've given him his bag.

1313
01:21:14,362 --> 01:21:16,887
There are Rs.
30 lakhs in it. Count them.

1314
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,131
l have a request to make.

1315
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:47,316
Hello, Mr. Brar.

1316
01:21:47,395 --> 01:21:49,090
Dharmpal.

01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:52,388
So early in the morning. - y es.

1318
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:54,098
Have a seat.

1319
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:55,900
Tell me.

1320
01:21:57,104 --> 01:21:59,902
Banks are closed for 2-3 days.
- y ou need money?

1321
01:21:59,974 --> 01:22:01,202
y es. What else could it be?

1322
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:04,073
How much? - Around Rs 1 crore.

1323
01:22:04,979 --> 01:22:05,968
l have them. - Okay.

1324
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:07,241
l had arranged for
them for some work.

1325
01:22:07,314 --> 01:22:08,838
l'll go and get it.

1326
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:11,282
Oh, my God. Money is not there.

1327
01:22:11,352 --> 01:22:12,842
We will get caught.

1328
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:14,410
Here's Rs. 1 crore. - Very good.

1329
01:22:14,488 --> 01:22:15,716
Huh !

1330
01:22:19,026 --> 01:22:20,288
Thank you very much.

1331
01:22:21,962 --> 01:22:24,362
l forgot to tell you something.

1332
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,361
Get everyone for Vikram's wedding.

1333
01:22:27,835 --> 01:22:29,393
Do you even need to say that?

1334
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:31,330
Vikram is getting married?

1335
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,400
Where did this money come from?
We had taken all of them.

1336
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,400
l know where the money came from.

1337
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:40,277
y ou know? - y es.

1338
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:43,278
Last night when l
went to grandpa's room..

1339
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:53,115
Shame on you.
Weren't Rs. 30 lakhs enough..

1340
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:54,951
..that you have come
here to get some more?

1341
01:22:55,029 --> 01:22:56,758
No, l had come to keep them back.

1342
01:22:57,164 --> 01:22:58,256
lt is like my own house.

1343
01:22:58,332 --> 01:23:01,267
Whenever l need them, l ask grandma.

1344
01:23:01,836 --> 01:23:04,430
y ou are right.
l, too, had come to keep them back.

1345
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:06,200
Aunt loves me.

1346
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:08,898
We'll ask for them
when we need them.

1347
01:23:09,376 --> 01:23:11,173
lt is like our own house.
We shouldn't do this.

1348
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:32,816
y our love story was great.

1349
01:24:33,794 --> 01:24:36,194
lt was great because it was a lie.

1350
01:24:37,398 --> 01:24:40,367
Only successful people
can have successful love stories.

1351
01:24:41,435 --> 01:24:43,232
People like me only come
across girls like Shalu.

1352
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,271
Who stops asking my calls
after finding out that..

1353
01:24:47,308 --> 01:24:48,832
..l am a struggler photographer.

1354
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,443
This was my true love story.

1355
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:56,011
lt's ending..

1356
01:24:57,818 --> 01:25:01,117
My fake love story led
me to my true love in this house.

1357
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,290
But all love stories
are destined to fail, brother.

1358
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:10,860
By the way, what is your real name?

1359
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:14,191
Rajveer.

1360
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:17,363
And yours?

1361
01:25:18,806 --> 01:25:19,670
Rajveer.

1362
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:23,973
lt was a pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.

1363
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:26,176
May God be with you.

1364
01:25:32,052 --> 01:25:33,076
Hey, Rajveer.

1365
01:25:50,738 --> 01:25:54,139
l've searched the entire house.
Where is my Rajveer?

1366
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,802
l wanted to take him to a mall.
- My Rajveer is also missing.

1367
01:25:57,177 --> 01:25:59,077
Rajveer. - Rajveer.

1368
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:01,979
Why are you shouting?
They must be here somewhere.

1369
01:26:02,049 --> 01:26:04,142
Rajveer. - Rajveer.

1370
01:26:04,418 --> 01:26:06,818
Rajveer. - There is no Rajveer.

1371
01:26:07,354 --> 01:26:09,345
There was no Rajveer in my life.

1372
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,823
l lied to all of you.

1373
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,926
Both of them have left. F orget them.

1374

Why don't you say something?

1375

y ou know what big a mistake
you have made by telling the truth?

1376
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:02,908
y ou don't know what
your grandma and aunt..

1377
01:27:02,976 --> 01:27:05,103
..are going through at the moment.

1378
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:12,115
Even l had started liking
them and their mischievous behavior.

1379
01:27:15,222 --> 01:27:18,419
Dear, what you did was not right.

1380
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:23,356
What you did was not right at all.

1381
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,185
l have suffered the
most by telling this lie.

1382
01:27:46,954 --> 01:27:50,913
l lost Vikram.
He has gone very far away from me.

1383
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:55,622
l loved him, Preeti. l loved him.

1384

''ln my eyes lie all
my dreams shattered.''

1385
01:28:06,006 --> 01:28:11,137
''How many tears l have
shed no longer matter.''

1386
01:28:11,845 --> 01:28:14,370
''lt lies incomplete..''

1387
01:28:14,815 --> 01:28:17,215
''lt wasn't successful..''

1388
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:28,785
''This was our love story,
my friend.''

1389
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:34,830
''This was our love story, buddy.''

1390
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:40,272
''This was our love story, my mate.''

1391
01:28:40,707 --> 01:28:46,077
''This was our love story,
my friend.''

1392
01:29:00,394 --> 01:29:05,991
''Those who were strangers
just a while ago..''

01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:11,904
''Are now like my shadow
which l cannot forgo.''

''Our fate..''

''ls the reason of our despair..''

1396
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:23,276
''We end up losing a winning hand.''

1397
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:29,016
''This was our love story,
my friend.''

1398
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:34,992
''This was our love story, buddy.''

1399
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:40,961
''This was our love story, my mate.''

1400
01:29:41,034 --> 01:29:46,301
''This was our love story,
my friend.''

1401
01:30:18,138 --> 01:30:21,301
Sister, those bags?

1402
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,904

Why are you going?

ls there a scarcity
of jobs in Chandigarh?

1406
01:30:31,985 --> 01:30:34,852
No, Preeti. Let me go.

1407
01:30:36,189 --> 01:30:39,454
Everyone in this family
was happy when l was in coma.

1408
01:30:39,526 --> 01:30:42,222
Both of them kept
everyone entertained.

1409
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:47,890
lt is possible that this family gets
its happiness back after l leave.

1410
01:30:47,968 --> 01:30:53,929
Sister, this family's happiness,
our happiness is with you.

1411
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:57,002
No, Preeti. Don't stop me.

1412
01:30:57,311 --> 01:31:02,146
l want to leave before everyone
returns from Vikram's wedding.

1413
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:04,247
Sis.. Sister. Sis..

1414
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:17,125
l had kept all the money back,
so why have you called me here?

1415
01:31:17,197 --> 01:31:19,791
l kept it before you,
why did she call me?

1416
01:31:19,866 --> 01:31:21,231
l don't trust you.
y ou are a photographer.

01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:23,963
Shut up. Do you guys always joke?

1418
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:27,372
Do you know why Vikram
agreed to get married?

1419
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:30,842
Because he feels sister
Gurleen loves Rajveer.

1420
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:32,208
Now from where did Vikram
come into the picture?

1421
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:33,769
Our name is causing
all problems. - y es.

Vikram the boy whom
sister Gurleen loves.

1424
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:40,443
All these problems have
been caused by Gurleen.

1425
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,681
What is it said in English.

1426
01:31:43,056 --> 01:31:44,683

Vikram is getting married today and
sister Gurleen is going to LA. - LA?

Hey, now we will be the
cause of all their problems.

Half of Punjab is addicted
to drugs because of us.

1436
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:15,348
Boys tease girls outside
college because of us.

01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:18,949
y es. y es.
Girls leave boys because of us.

Heer and Ranjha couldn't unite.

1440
01:32:21,028 --> 01:32:21,824

She's getting married to me.
- Her name is Tania?

1540
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:52,396
Brother-in-law, where are you going?

1541
01:36:52,465 --> 01:36:53,898
Sister wants to meet you.

1542
01:36:53,967 --> 01:36:56,094
Tell your sister
that l can't marry her.

1543
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,373
Sister. Sister. Vikram ran away.

1544
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,033
He said he can't marry you.

1545
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:05,073
What! How can he run away!

1546
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:07,871

1549
01:37:13,753 --> 01:37:16,381
Unnecessarily.. - Let's go.

1550
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:20,415
lf you had to run away then
why did you agree to marry me?

1551
01:37:21,928 --> 01:37:24,226
l don't want a reply from you.
l want a reply from him.

1552
01:37:24,664 --> 01:37:26,097
Tania. - Tania!

1553
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:27,224
Answer her.

1554
01:37:29,336 --> 01:37:30,166
Best of luck.

1555
01:37:30,236 --> 01:37:31,294
Hey, hello.

1556
01:37:36,109 --> 01:37:38,373
Look, my daughter
caught the boy. - y es.

1557
01:37:38,678 --> 01:37:40,111
The security guys
couldn't find them.

1558
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:44,014
Dad, what are you saying?
He is your son-in-law. Vikram.

1559
01:37:44,384 --> 01:37:45,214
Vikram?

1560
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:46,718
Doesn't he look like Rajveer?

1561
01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:48,219
He isn't my son Vikram.

1562
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,414
What? - y es.

1563
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:50,922
He is right. - y es.

1564
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:52,749
l am not the one you think l am.

1565
01:37:53,059 --> 01:37:55,960
l came here to unite
two broken hearts.

1566
01:37:56,029 --> 01:37:58,293
While doing that
l broke your marriage.

1567
01:37:58,365 --> 01:37:59,696
Then who are you?

1568
01:38:01,034 --> 01:38:03,832
l am a struggling photographer
who dreams big.

1569
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:06,865
Photographer?

1570
01:38:08,441 --> 01:38:11,410
Do you have any girl
in your life? - No.

1571
01:38:11,478 --> 01:38:14,879
Oh. There is no boy
in my life either. No.

1572
01:38:15,715 --> 01:38:17,114
But whose son is he?

1573
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:18,411
y es. He isn't my son.

1574
01:38:18,485 --> 01:38:20,248
y ou go and talk to them. Please.

1575
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:20,911
He isn't mine.

1576
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:24,354
He is my son. Mahinder Singh Brar's.

1577
01:38:24,657 --> 01:38:26,056
But where is my son Vikram?

1578
01:38:59,726 --> 01:39:01,717
Rajveer with Vikram?

1579
01:39:04,197 --> 01:39:05,129
Sister..

1580
01:39:20,346 --> 01:39:22,780
y ou are going to LA?
l am not here to convince you.

1581
01:39:22,849 --> 01:39:24,111
l am here to bid you farewell.
Come on, leave.

1582
01:39:24,651 --> 01:39:26,812
l am leaving because
you are getting married.

1583
01:39:26,886 --> 01:39:28,012
y ou refused to marry me.

1584
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:30,113
lf l refused couldn't
you make me agree to it?

1585
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,983
l used to come everyday
in the hospital to do just that.

1586
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:47,331
Gurleen is standing
right before you, Vikram.

1587
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:50,804
Even l don't want to go to LA.

1588
01:39:53,246 --> 01:39:54,975
Try convincing me once more today.

1589
01:39:55,048 --> 01:39:55,742
Please.

1590
01:40:10,163 --> 01:40:14,827
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1591
01:40:15,268 --> 01:40:20,331
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1592
01:40:20,406 --> 01:40:25,400
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1593
01:40:25,712 --> 01:40:30,775
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1594
01:40:34,354 --> 01:40:35,343
Where are you going?

1595
01:40:36,956 --> 01:40:38,389
l have a lot of distance to cover.

1596
01:40:39,092 --> 01:40:42,061
l have to cut an album.
Give live performances.

1597
01:40:42,428 --> 01:40:45,397
l agree that my dream is big
but l won't rest until l fulfil it.

1598
01:40:45,798 --> 01:40:50,861
l had just one dream that a
nice boy should come into my life..

1599
01:40:50,937 --> 01:40:53,963
..like the hero enters into
a girl's life in love stories..

1600
01:40:54,474 --> 01:40:57,204
l feel that dream
will come true today.

1601
01:41:16,763 --> 01:41:17,821
What are you thinking about?

1602
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:19,256
That what mess have
you got yourself into?

1603
01:41:19,933 --> 01:41:20,865
No.

1604
01:41:21,434 --> 01:41:24,801
Then you must be thinking that you
aren't wearing the wedding attire.

1605
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:26,429
Clothes?
What difference does it make?

1606
01:41:29,008 --> 01:41:31,806
Then you must be thinking that
everything's happening so fast.

1607
01:41:32,312 --> 01:41:34,371
Right? - No.

1608
01:41:35,348 --> 01:41:38,374
l'm thinking that even
unsuccessful people

1609
01:41:38,451 --> 01:41:41,284
can have successful love stories.

1610
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,858
'l feel some love
stories are beyond our.'

1611
01:41:49,295 --> 01:41:54,289
'Those sweet and beautiful
love stories are written by God.'

1612
01:41:55,034 --> 01:41:58,026
'God had written
our love story as well.'

1613
01:41:58,538 --> 01:42:03,168
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1614
01:42:03,843 --> 01:42:08,212
''This is our love story, buddy.''

1615
01:42:08,881 --> 01:42:13,409
''This is our love story, my mate.''

1616
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:18,684
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1617
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,670
''These eyes..''

1618
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:42,673
''These eyes..''

1619
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:46,817
''These eyes..''

1620
01:42:47,153 --> 01:42:49,314
''These eyes..''

1621
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:52,753
''These eyes treasure..''

1622
01:42:52,825 --> 01:42:54,349
''These eyes..''

1623
01:42:54,427 --> 01:42:56,361
''These eyes treasure..''

1624
01:42:58,097 --> 01:43:01,794
''These eyes treasure
my precious dreams.''

1625
01:43:03,536 --> 01:43:07,404
''l wish to go across the
sky through the path clouded realm.''

1626
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,006
''These eyes treasure
my precious dreams.''

1627
01:43:12,412 --> 01:43:15,472
''l wish to go across the
sky through the path clouded realm.''

1628
01:43:15,782 --> 01:43:19,115
''lt'll echo, in this world..''

1629
01:43:19,185 --> 01:43:22,951
''All across the sky..''

1630
01:43:23,022 --> 01:43:24,751
''lt'll echo, in this world..''

1631
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:26,382
''All across the sky..''

1632
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:29,724
''On the mike of my heart,
my racing heartbeat.''

1633
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:33,394
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1634
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,894
''This is our love story, buddy.''

1635
01:43:37,236 --> 01:43:40,399
''This is our love story, my mate.''

1636
01:43:40,873 --> 01:43:43,933
''This is our love story, my friend.''

1637
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,807
''Our love story, my friend.''

1638
01:43:45,878 --> 01:43:47,368
''Our love story, my friend.''

1639
01:43:47,447 --> 01:43:48,744
''What's up, man ! ''

1640
01:43:48,815 --> 01:43:49,338
''Hey, boy! ''

1641
01:43:49,415 --> 01:43:50,746

01:43:58,057 --> 01:43:59,854
''l don't lie.''

1647
01:43:59,926 --> 01:44:01,985
''lf you want to chant something..''

1648
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:03,255
''Then it rather be Lord's name.''

''This is our love story.''

01:44:05,131 --> 01:44:06,928
''He is pulling its strings.''

''He will make everything fit.''

1652
01:44:08,401 --> 01:44:10,369
''He will make it a hit.''

1653
01:44:10,803 --> 01:44:12,737
''One, two, three, four.''

01:44:12,805 --> 01:44:14,102
