1
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,292
For God's sake, let me go!

2
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,750
Where to, princess?

3
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:03,083
- Let me go.
- Scream if you want.

4
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,833
Let the toughest man in Meerut
save you from my clutches.

5
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,917
- Anyone there?
- Ashok!

6
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:47,167
May the good Lord forgive us!

7
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,417
Can't you speak French?

8
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,833
Ashok, didn't I hit you yesterday?

9
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,500
So what?

10
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,417
So what!

11
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,417
Times have changed, boy.

12
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,000
Your father is a boy!
They call me Bauua Singh.

13
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,167
Bauua!

14
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,500
Oh, no! That same dream.

15
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,250
Did you save my honor again
in your dream?

16
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,833
Yes.

17
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,333
Your friends are here.

18
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,417
Your father is calling you
for breakfast.

19
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,500
Bring me tea. Wash your hands first.

20
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,625
- Bauua.
- Who's that?

21
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,000
- Bauua!
- Bauua!

22
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,625
Your Majesty! Good morning.

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,833
Good morning, guys. What's up?

24
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,000
Look! The new iPhone.

25
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,167
Wow!

26
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,750
Sire, this jewel in rags

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,833
has brought great news for you.

28
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,542
Your heart will melt.
You'll sing devotional songs.

29
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,708
- The most delightful news ever.
- Read it out!

30
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,792
Okay.

31
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:20,625
Babita Kumari's heart
has been broken again.

32
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,083
- Wow!
- At director Imtiaz Ali's party

33
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,250
the spat between Babita Kumari
and her boyfriend intensified.

34
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,542
They were cast in Anurag Kashyap's
next film

35
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,625
but Babita has refused
to work with her guy.

36
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:41,250
- Tea.
- Her close friend disclosed why.

37
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
He's with another actress.

38
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,167
Has it happened again?

39
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:49,917
Has Babita Kumari's heart been
broken by another flirt?

40
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Your bride has missed the wedding bus.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,750
Well done!
Guddu, that's terrific news.

42
00:04:56,292 --> 00:05:02,042
Today is Eid. Give these guys
a 500-rupee bundle.

43
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,125
It'll make their day.

44
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,750
- Wait!
- Just be quiet.

45
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:07,833
- Is he up yet?
- No.

46
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:12,708
He'll only get up when my dead body
leaves this house.

47
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:17,583
Have your breakfast. Stop nagging him.
He's just a kid.

48
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:21,542
- By height. Eats like a full-grown man!
- Stop it.

49
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,917
I slave away while the mister wants
fresh orange juice.

50
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,000
I am not his father

51
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,167
but a money printing machine to him.

52
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,417
Keep them coming.

53
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:42,500
Hey! Enjoy biryani in my bride
Babita's name.

54
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,833
Hey, you!

55
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,625
Stop!

56
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,500
The whole neighborhood's shown up.

57
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,625
You incompetent idiots!

58
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,500
Snatch the cash from him.

59
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,500
- Have your breakfast.
- I won't spare him today.

60
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,833
- It's morning!
- What?

61
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,833
Squandering my money.

62
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,083
- He's a kid.
- A kid, my foot!

63
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,833
You're an angel of death.

64
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,417
Don't talk nonsense, Ashok.

65
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,542
Your bad habits made me short.

66
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,000
So what if I spend your money?

67
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,542
My bad habits?

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,625
Is my height my fault?

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,542
All that tobacco-chewing
stunted your genes.

70
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,167
- My genes?
- It's stunted. I've read about it.

71
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,250
Kusum, either I kill him or you kill me.

72
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:30,083
- Say that when a cop's bashing you.
- Bauua!

73
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,833
- Go on. Hit me.
- Go downstairs for my sake.

74
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,917
- I'll stop your merrymaking.
- Go!

75
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,458
- I'm taking your car.
- Be my guest!

76
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,583
Move away!

77
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,250
Even your belt's too soft.

78
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,625
Bauua, why are you after him?

79
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,750
Look at my height. He owes me, Mom.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,083
Son, it's God's will
that you're a dwarf.

81
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,750
Your God has had His way.
Now it's my turn.

82
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,917
Go. Get me my suit
and the Dhoom 3 bowler hat.

83
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,250
I'm going to watch my bride's new movie.

84
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,500
Mom, I've told you so many times

85
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,417
don't you cry.

86
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:14,000
- Found your perfect wife?
- Pandey is looking for a girl.

87
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,750
- How are you! - Nigar Cinema.
- How many passengers?

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Just me, the small kid.
And my father.

89
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,917
Why are you joking, sir?
You're a grown man.

90
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,917
So why ask? Shall I?

91
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,417
- I charge 20 rupees.
- It's 10 for Nigar Cinema.

92
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,167
Pay me five and pull
the rickshaw yourself.

93
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,000
10 rupees per passenger.
No matter how many.

94
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,167
- Can you pull us all?
- Yes.

95
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,917
Give me five! Again!

96
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,542
I'm taking you to watch
my bride's movie!

97
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:51,833
Come! We're off to see
my bride's movie.

98
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,542
Come and enjoy Babita's latest!

99
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,083
Two item numbers in this one.

100
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,250
He can pull us all.

101
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,833
Guddu, should I call Junaid?

102
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,750
Forget it! He prefers the star Deepika
and Hollywood movies.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,500
Come with us.
There's tons of room here.

104
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,958
"The night is young,
full of lustful promises."

105
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,583
"The weather is in our favor."

106
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,000
The screen is that way!

107
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:34,000
"You always fail at love.
I burn in love."

108
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,250
"Our names are notorious."

109
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,833
"I could use you."

110
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,250
"Don't think too much."

111
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,917
"I'll leave the world behind for you.
Why worry?"

112
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:51,500
"The beauty conquers your heart."

113
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:56,417
"The beauty conquers your heart.
Don't worry, sweetheart."

114
00:08:56,542 --> 00:09:00,833
"Beauty conquers.."

115
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:06,417
Shaadi.com calling.
Yes, Pandey?

116
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,833
Celebrate? Celebrate what?

117
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,625
Are you drunk?
I'll be there tomorrow.

118
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,042
- What is it?
- Nothing. Come on.

119
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:25,250
"Bang like a drum, work my body.
Tonight I'm in charge, so dance to my beat."

120
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,542
"Do it slowly."

121
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,042
"One night only."

122
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,417
"Because I'm feeling hot,
Tequila no chase."

123
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,250
"Oh, on, your lips, you like my style."

124
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,500
Bring the three Khans with you.
Here I am, sweetheart.

125
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,875
Why did Pandey call you so early?

126
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,125
I have a bad feeling.

127
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,500
Mr. Singh

128
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,333
when's the wedding?

129
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,167
What rubbish, Pandey!

130
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,708
Don't stick gum on my shoe
for your commission.

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
You've introduced me to many girls
for months.

132
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,917
I didn't like any.

133
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,167
What's so special about her?

134
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,167
I didn't care for active girls

135
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,500
why would an inactive girl
interest me?

136
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,625
- Inactive?
- Yes!

137
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,417
I told him to find me another bride.
Didn't I tell you?

138
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,000
- Yes.
- He's right.

139
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,625
I know what you were up to.

140
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,833
You should've told me before
hugging and kissing.

141
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,917
My God, what have you done?

142
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,500
What's wrong with her?

143
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,333
She's pretty and educated.

144
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,083
Comes from a good family.
Has a great job.

145
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,542
But

146
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,417
- a few mechanical problems.
- Like what?

147
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,708
Technical hiccups.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,167
He's not exactly a catch!

149
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,625
When he sits, his feet can't touch
the ground and he wants a beauty.

150
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,000
- True.
- You were having

151
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,083
a love affair.

152
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,667
No.

153
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,250
Will you betray her?
Turn your back on love?

154
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,500
Love?
What's going on?

155
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,250
You didn't tell me. God, forgive us.

156
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,417
No!

157
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,708
What do you mean, no?

158
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,625
It started five months ago,
on 27th January

159
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,500
you were looking at photos
of prospective brides

160
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,083
and I entered through that door.

161
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,500
It was a miserable day.

162
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,042
You came all the way from Meerut
in this terrible storm?

163
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,500
Bachelors at 38

164
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,917
aren't scared of storms.

165
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,000
You've seen so many photos.

166
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,083
No girl in Asia is worthy of you.

167
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,333
Shut up!

168
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:30,625
You lied to me. You hid this diamond
in a coal mine.

169
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,375
This one?

170
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,875
- Where did you find this?
- In your desk drawer.

171
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,875
She's unavailable. So I hid it.

172
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,542
I've paid you so much,
you should be available to me too.

173
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,875
- What are you saying?
- What's wrong?

174
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,375
Mr. Singh, she's not for you.

175
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,583
I think she is.

176
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,583
My friend, she shakes a lot.

177
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,375
So I'll shake along with her.

178
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,125
Introduce us.

179
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,792
Don't take this road.

180
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,708
But I will.

181
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,542
Mr. Singh

182
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,208
even people who love in secret
end up married.

183
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,958
Aafia Yusufzai Bhinder?
What kind of name is that?

184
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,875
Some people have the oddest names.
So does she.

185
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,042
Half Afghani, half Punjabi.

186
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:27,042
Blast! Then? What did you do?

187
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,042
Then, I landed up at her address.

188
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,958
Amity Global School is proud
to present our very own student

189
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,167
from the batch of 2001.
Apart from finding water fossils in Mars

190
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,958
her latest achievement is creating
a zero gravity simulator on earth.

191
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:47,583
Students, please welcome our senior
scientist, Ms. Aafia Yusufzai Bhinder.

192
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,208
Good heavens!

193
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,792
The photo was deceptive.

194
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
Good morning, students.

195
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,375
- Only girls here. Scoot!
- Fine!

196
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,875
Stop!

197
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,958
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!

198
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,125
- Why are you in a fancy dress?
- It's my birthday.

199
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,875
- And those doves?
- Which ones?

200
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,208
- Give them to me.
- Stop!

201
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,792
They cost 5,000 for the pair, idiot.

202
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,292
Insulting me? What class are you in?

203
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,708
If I had married in time,
I'd have brats like you by now.

204
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:33,833
Don't pull my ear.

205
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,125
No pulling..

206
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,042
Let go. I'll bite you.

207
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,625
Don't pull my organs!

208
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:51,208
Did Pandey send you?

209
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,958
- Bauua Singh?
- Singh..

210
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,875
Singh..

211
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,208
I didn't know my name had
a whistle in it. Say it again.

212
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,708
What's wrong? You're leaving?

213
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,292
Listen to me!

214
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:19,125
I brought a pair of doves for you

215
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,375
but those brats let them escape.
Please take this.

216
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,958
Like doves, thorns do not fear dying.

217
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,708
Isn't that a Dilip Kumar line?

218
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,292
You're no Madhubala either.
It's a compliment.

219
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,542
The canteen here has great snacks.

220
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,042
Want some?

221
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,125
You want her autograph?
Queue up.

222
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,458
Aren't kids nasty?

223
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:02,583
What made you think you could
ever marry me?

224
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:08,000
Me? Marry?
Who pays for looking?

225
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,167
I was just window-shopping.

226
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,500
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes.

227
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
You found water on Mars or something?

228
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,917
You should look for water in Meerut.
It's cut off for days there.

229
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:25,542
Looks like your brain's even smaller
than you are.

230
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,167
The way you're guzzling down
those pakoras

231
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,917
dipping them in chutney

232
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:35,333
I bet you haven't passed
the seventh grade.

233
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:39,000
- Tenth grade, actually.
- Tenth grade?

234
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,542
Students!

235
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,083
What should we do with this man?

236
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,167
Kill him!

237
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,250
Watch it!

238
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:56,292
Don't you dare!
Don't touch me. I'll hit you.

239
00:15:56,417 --> 00:16:00,917
Be polite and see
this elderly man to the door.

240
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,542
What? I'm only 38.

241
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,333
You brats!

242
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,083
- Then?
- Then what?

243
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,750
Chill, bro. I went home.

244
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,917
- Look! What is this?
- Shall I explain?

245
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,167
What are you..

246
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:29,917
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

247
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,542
What is this?

248
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,667
A dance contest.

249
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,750
The winner will attend
a party with Babita Kumari.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
- Really?
- Yes.

251
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:42,750
Add my name then. I can dance.

252
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,167
Hey! Shall I make you dance?

253
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,667
So, what happened next?

254
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,000
You're playing innocent.
Just tell the truth!

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,250
I first roasted
those cursed doves.

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,167
- This chicken is tiny.
- It's a dwarf.

257
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,500
God, forgive us!

258
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,917
As usual, my father kept saying
I was a good-for-nothing.

259
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,333
Exhausted, he fell asleep.

260
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,750
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four three, two, one, zero!

261
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,542
I couldn't sleep.

262
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,333
That mean girl,
that Shahid Kapoor lookalike.

263
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,917
5,000 angels of death swooped
past me.

264
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,250
I was so angry, I shot down 200 stars
that night.

265
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,000
But Ashok stopped me.

266
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,917
Don't empty the sky.

267
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,333
You should sell tickets
for your magic show.

268
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,000
Lend me 500 rupees.

269
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,750
Shall I take my belt off?

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,417
What belt? Are you going to hit me
with your drawstring?

271
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,542
It was pointless living
without taking revenge.

272
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,542
I wanted sweet revenge.
Revenge!

273
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:54,083
- We have decided to..
- Hello, hello, my loose cannon.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,167
You may have found water on Mars
or tomatoes elsewhere, so what?

275
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,542
Did it help you?

276
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,917
Don't laugh too much!

277
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,000
You humiliated me in front of
5,000 people yesterday. My turn now.

278
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,417
Ladies and gentlemen

279
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:14,667
sure, I could've been taller!
But she's no lanky Amitabh Bachchan.

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,417
I'm small in stature,
but my limbs work.

281
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,500
All she can do is shake.

282
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,250
Give me that pen.
I'll show you something.

283
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,167
If this pen falls

284
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,333
I can pick it up.
But she can't.

285
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:37,917
Bauua Singh may be uneducated
and live off his father

286
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,667
but I can stand on my own two feet.

287
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,500
Let's see her pick up the pen.

288
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,833
Keep watching her.
Look where you're going, mister.

289
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,667
The kid-faced Devil

290
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,500
Nasty dwarf

291
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:49,417
She did manage to lift the pen,
and she touched my heart.

292
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,917
I'm used to my father's insults,
so that wasn't a problem.

293
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,417
The problem was,
she didn't even stare at me.

294
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:02,708
I'm a dwarf! People pay money
to see dwarves in a circus.

295
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,417
It would've cost her nothing.
But she didn't look twice.

296
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,542
For me, it was quits or all in.

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,250
No more doves.
Time for a bouquet.

298
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:38,000
Long live the Goddess!

299
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,375
- Great, yes.
- True.

300
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,250
Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

301
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,667
Like dew, I only caressed your cheeks.

302
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,667
That line isn't Dilip Kumar's.
It's mine. I wrote it for you.

303
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,000
Aafia, till 3:30 last night,
I despised you.

304
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,542
At 3:45, I was in love with you.

305
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,083
Really?

306
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,000
Straight to love?

307
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,250
Yes.

308
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,750
I thought you were crushed.

309
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:20,917
Right word?

310
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:25,083
Yes! Crushed is the right word.

311
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,833
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

312
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,542
I came to apologize.

313
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,500
It's customary to bring flowers.

314
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,250
May I?

315
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,500
Never mind, it's okay.

316
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:47,875
Size does not matter to dreams.

317
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:53,083
- This small man has dreamed of you.
- Thanks.

318
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,708
- Forgive me, Aafia.
- Sorry about that.

319
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,208
Well, shall I go?

320
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,167
The whereabouts?

321
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,042
Stop me from walking away.

322
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,583
Goddess, will You crush me again?
Blast you, Pandey.

323
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,375
Nice girls for everyone.
And you find her for me?

324
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,500
She humiliated me again
in front of everyone.

325
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,875
Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

326
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,375
Like dew, I only caressed
your cheeks.

327
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,958
That's my line not Dilip Kumar's.

328
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,875
Until 3:30 last night, I despised you.

329
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,375
At 3:45, I was in love with you.

330
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,042
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

331
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:35,042
Size does not matter to dreams.
This small man has dreamed of you.

332
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,208
I came to apologize.

333
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,500
This time I've brought you a plant.

334
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,458
Please accept it.

335
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,042
I'm off. I'm going.

336
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:49,375
I'm leaving. Promise.

337
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,583
Have some shame!

338
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,583
Stop me this time!

339
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,375
Get rid of your dimple.
Don't act over-smart.

340
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,042
Then I might talk to you.

341
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,458
I didn't buy my dimples.

342
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,458
I was born with them.
God's gift, ma'am.

343
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,375
What?
What do you want?

344
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,500
I've come from so far to meet you.

345
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:18,875
You could offer me tea, coffee,
a soft-drink or wine.

346
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,458
Here. Drink up.

347
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:32,458
If I had to drink alone

348
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,875
a Meerut bar would do.

349
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,042
Have one.

350
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,958
Go on!

351
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,708
Cheers! To your smile.

352
00:23:56,375 --> 00:24:01,375
Aafia, if you're unlucky,
we'll meet again.

353
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,125
Won't you ask me
to pick up a pen today?

354
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:12,042
You'll take my life, Aafia.
What's a pen?

355
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:16,583
Can I be cheeky and request you
to dance with me?

356
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,500
I can't dance.

357
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,208
I used to think I could never love.

358
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:27,875
Give yourself a chance, my sweet lady.

359
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,792
- DJ!
- Yes, sir?

360
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,042
Play a Shammi Kapoor song.

361
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:37,583
Don't have any.

362
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,542
- A Rishi Kapoor song?
- Well..

363
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:45,042
- Play a song by any one of the Kapoors.
- Okay.

364
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,583
A Shashi Kapoor number?

365
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:50,375
Play it!

366
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,500
"Oh, my God!"

367
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,125
"This crazy heart of mine
has weaved such magic"

368
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:17,208
"that you have"

369
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:23,958
"fallen in love with me."

370
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:27,500
"I have"

371
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:33,458
"fallen in love with you."

372
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,250
"Oh, my God!"

373
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,875
"My heart tells me."

374
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:05,375
"It's God's truth."

375
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,708
"My heart tells me."

376
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,708
"It's God's truth."

377
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:16,083
"The world does not believe it."

378
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:22,208
"The world does not believe it"

379
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,583
"but I'm crazy about you."

380
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,375
"I'm not a garden, not a star."

381
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,208
"I'm not a dark cloud,
I'm only a shadow."

382
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,375
"You have"

383
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:38,042
"fallen in love with me."

384
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,125
"Oh, my God!"

385
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
See!

386
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,125
Another drink?

387
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:57,583
The rover that went to Mars,
what's it called?

388
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,708
Goodness! I'm so drunk!

389
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,792
Yes, Sunil?

390
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,458
No.

391
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,500
- It's called..
- Velocity.

392
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:11,583
I knew that.
I know.

393
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:18,375
Who asked NSAR to send
a rover to Mars?

394
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,125
Velocity was sent by whom?

395
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,583
- Who sent it?
- I did.

396
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,125
Is that so?

397
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:34,958
Who told NSAR that Velocity
should dig

398
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,125
more than travel?

399
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,500
Who did?

400
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,375
I did.

401
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,542
Amazing.

402
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,708
Who told them

403
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:50,958
we should send a man to Mars now?

404
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,292
It's time.

405
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,500
- Who did?
- I did.

406
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,583
Who said

407
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:08,125
we should find cheaper ways
of doing this from India?

408
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,875
- That's why I'm here.
- Who?

409
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,583
Me. In India.

410
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:16,292
I came.

411
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,458
If you're here in India,
it must be you.

412
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,875
- Amazing. You came here..
- Excuse me.

413
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,958
Can you give me one more drink,
please?

414
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,042
Sorry, ma'am, the bar's closed.

415
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:34,208
She found water on Mars,
and you refuse her a drink?

416
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,042
Look at her!

417
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,583
Okay. Don't look.
Aafia, shall I hit him?

418
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,458
The toilet is shaking.
Give me a sip.

419
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,375
Try some lemon.

420
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:05,208
So, who said..

421
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Enough, my friend.
Is NSAR all we can talk about?

422
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:13,958
Do I brag about saving Satish's shop
when the council came to destroy it?

423
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,583
- Who saved it?
- I did.

424
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,500
They came with bulldozers
to raze it to the ground.

425
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,208
Do I brag? I did this, I did that.
Doesn't sound good.

426
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,500
Are you making fun of me?
Rascal!

427
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,208
Acting over-smart again?

428
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,125
But no dimples this time!
It still worked, right?

429
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:42,500
Shut up! I need to take a leak.

430
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,500
Where's the leak?

431
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:51,125
Duffer! I need to use the toilet, to pee.

432
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,833
Oh, no!

433
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,125
What must I do?

434
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:01,458
You? I'm the one who has to do it.

435
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,292
I'll wait outside.
Call me when you're done.

436
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,458
Outside? You're my friend.

437
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,958
Stay put. Just turn around.

438
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:15,125
We're in the ladies toilet.
There may be some ladies around.

439
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,458
I'll deal with them.
Don't be mistaken.

440
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,375
I'm not your friend.

441
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,500
If I said I was your friend,
would you have let me stay?

442
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,292
- Oh, my God!
- Come in, ma'am. I'm only a kid.

443
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:47,042
I found water on Mars
and the rascal won't give me a drink.

444
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:50,208
Now I'll look for alcohol on Mars.

445
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,875
You didn't answer me.

446
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,500
If I said I was your friend,
could I have stayed?

447
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,042
- You missed your chance.
- No way.

448
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:25,458
If I went for this chance,
I might lose other chances.

449
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,125
God forbid I ever become your friend!

450
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,292
- Shut up!
- Okay.

451
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,708
- And goodnight.
- Okay. I'm gone.

452
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:42,792
Aafia, did anyone tell you

453
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:46,500
how pretty sweat looks
on your face?

454
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:50,042
Yes. Mom did.

455
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,458
You'll look even prettier with color
on you. It's Holi tomorrow!

456
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,792
Play Holi with me.

457
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,583
Money back if you don't have fun.

458
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:04,042
Don't forget your place, Bauua Singh.

459
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:08,458
I'm way out of your league.

460
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,125
That's really kind of you, Aafia.

461
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,583
I can find dozens like you.

462
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,792
Why like me?

463
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:24,292
- I like uneducated types.
- I can be the intellectual gent.

464
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,750
I've seen many English films.

465
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,792
Look, it's goodnight from me.

466
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,792
Stand there if you
want to waste your time.

467
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,125
Bauua!

468
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,583
Bauua!

469
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,792
Are you there?

470
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:58,042
So your head was against the door.
Like this?

471
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,458
How romantic! Standing at her door.
Then?

472
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,042
The usual.

473
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,375
What? Romance?

474
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,792
No, fool! A song.

475
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:13,708
Guddu, the orchestra cost 250,000.
150,000 for their costumes.

476
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,292
50,000 bribe for the
Imperial Hotel's manager.

477
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,958
80,000 to hire the nasty kids.
20,000 for color sprays.

478
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,375
Plus my suit at 150,000.

479
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:29,375
I didn't want to, but ended up
spending 600,000 of dad's money.

480
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:34,958
Thanks to the Goddess,
at last the girl looked at this dwarf.

481
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,292
"A color has no color"

482
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,500
"if it does not match the color
of your lips."

483
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:09,458
"A fragrance has no fragrance"

484
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:15,500
"if it does not match the fragrance
of your dark hair."

485
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:21,458
"The world pales next to you."

486
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:25,458
"You can only be mine."

487
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:32,375
"Everyone can see it.
I say this out loud."

488
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:38,042
"As long as there's light in the world"

489
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:41,583
"you'll belong to me."

490
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:46,042
"As long as I live in this world"

491
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,875
"you'll belong to me."

492
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:54,417
"As long as there's light in the world"

493
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,125
"you'll belong to me."

494
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:05,875
"As long as I live in this world,
you'll belong to me."

495
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:54,125
"I am your confusion.
I am your solution."

496
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,958
"I'm a little stubborn."

497
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,375
"A little crazy too."

498
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,125
"How false are the clouds
and spring showers!"

499
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:09,458
"How false is offering
a gift of flowers!"

500
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,125
"Only you are real.
Only I am real."

501
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:17,375
"My heart speaks the only truth."

502
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,458
"Etch your name on my heart
with your lovely hands."

503
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:29,042
"Open your eyes to my love.
Do I ask too much of you?"

504
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:34,125
"I say this out loud."

505
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,042
"As long as there's light
in the world"

506
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,958
"you'll belong to me."

507
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:46,042
"As long as I live in this world"

508
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:49,500
"you'll belong to me."

509
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,125
"As long as there's light
in the world"

510
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:58,125
"you'll belong to me."

511
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:05,708
"As long as I live in this world,
you'll belong to me."

512
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:32,792
"Forever you will sway
in my loving arms."

513
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:41,292
"Like the earth sways
in the arms of the sun."

514
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:48,500
"You will never be apart from me."

515
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:56,708
"Forever you will be a part of me."

516
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,458
"Shatter all my dreams if you wish."

517
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:09,375
"The shards of my dreams
will still dream of you."

518
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,208
"You are my inspiration."

519
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,542
"I say this out loud."

520
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,958
My good sir!

521
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:47,208
Your romancing will get my family
thrown out on the street.

522
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,708
I'll be fired.

523
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,292
Shut up! She's coming round.

524
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,125
I should shut up?
Pass me the agreement.

525
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,458
Where does it say
you'll ruin this place?

526
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:00,500
We agreed you'd spray colors,
there'd be some musicians

527
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:01,708
that's all.

528
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,125
Bauua.

529
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,042
Bauua, give me 100 rupees
and I'll tell you something.

530
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,792
Your father wants you home.

531
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,708
I paid you to hear this?

532
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,417
Rascal! What's this?

533
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,708
Lost your tongue?

534
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,708
You sang to her.

535
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:28,458
Now you're in love. What else?
Why deny it?

536
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:33,958
She fell in love with me.
And I started loving myself.

537
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,458
- Then?
- The usual.

538
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,375
Another song? You just sang.

539
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,792
No!

540
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,792
Intimacy!

541
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,583
God, forgive us!

542
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,875
Do you know

543
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,500
why the moon is sometimes
a half moon?

544
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,500
Yes.

545
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:14,042
Because the other half sits
on the Imperial Hotel balcony.

546
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,292
- Trying to be smooth?
- Trying?

547
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,125
Showing me your dimple,
making a fool of me.

548
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,042
I know your ways.

549
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,125
Well

550
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,792
let me try another technique.

551
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,500
Look!

552
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:43,583
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

553
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:55,792
Do it

554
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:57,875
again.

555
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,958
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

556
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,458
Zero.

557
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:17,708
How did you do it?

558
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,458
Would you make the moon fall too?

559
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,875
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one..

560
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,125
Never mind!

561
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,500
There's only one moon.

562
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,875
So

563
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:31,292
if we get intimate now

564
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,292
your job's done, right?

565
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,958
It's all you wanted?

566
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,500
That's what I thought, but..

567
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,583
But?

568
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,958
But

569
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,875
it's hard for me to say this.

570
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,958
It's insulting for me

571
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,583
but

572
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,042
I'm in love with you.

573
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,125
Wait. What are you doing?

574
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,292
Don't go. I'll be back.

575
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,500
What a scandal! Then?

576
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:44,708
It's a month since that night.
Haven't seen her since.

577
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,375
I've got a new SIM card
and a new number.

578
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,625
Don't fly too high!
Clever crows can end up eating trash too.

579
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:54,375
I've had my share of trash.
I'll just be the clever crow now.

580
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,500
- And fly high.
- Listen.

581
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,042
You wronged her.

582
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:02,125
- God will take His revenge.
- What more revenge can He take?

583
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:06,042
Remember when my father used to pay
tax in advance? I've paid too.

584
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:09,500
And if God asks me,
why this, why that..

585
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,792
You know, we cover our faces.

586
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,792
Don't believe her.

587
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,125
Blast you, Pandey.

588
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,583
- What is it?
- Can you eat sweets?

589
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,500
- What happened, Bauua?
- Sunita.

590
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,125
- He's back.
- Hold on a minute.

591
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,792
- Come here.
- Hear me out. Listen.

592
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,125
What's going on?

593
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,875
Look at me.

594
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:40,958
Are you duping her?

595
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,458
Bauua!

596
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:44,792
Scoundrel.

597
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:49,875
You talk nonstop.
Cat got your tongue now?

598
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,458
That's our Bauua.

599
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,125
Yes, I know.

600
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:59,042
You don't get it?
He's always going to look small.

601
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:06,708
I won't look different
25 years from now either.

602
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,708
True.

603
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,292
You're lucky.

604
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,875
You found a girl who'll marry you.

605
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,583
Even boys would say no to you.

606
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,708
Playing games with her?

607
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:26,708
Idiot.

608
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:31,042
Listen, Kusum.

609
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,958
They're both ready.
Fix the wedding date.

610
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,875
An auspicious day. Hurry.

611
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,500
He's getting married at last!

612
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:46,875
Congratulations!

613
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:51,750
I won't get married! I'll kill myself!
- How can he kill himself?

614
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,292
Where's everybody?
Ma'am?

615
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,792
- Guddu, let's celebrate.
- Celebrate?

616
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,958
How can you all eat?

617
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,708
He'll commit suicide.

618
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,792
- Who?
- Bauua, who else?

619
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:06,125
That's just typical of him.

620
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,708
He shouts his head off.
No one can say a word to him.

621
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,500
Before anyone calls him a dwarf

622
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:14,958
he stuffs money in their face
or pelts stones.

623
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,042
His strutting is a sham.

624
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,792
I'll buy you a shop
if he commits suicide.

625
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,458
God! What kind of mother are you?

626
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:25,583
The real mother.

627
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,875
Yes, I need 75 boxes of sweets.

628
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:35,167
Not 80, 75. Yes.

629
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:39,625
Move aside. Fine!

630
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,250
Bauua, you're getting marinated here

631
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,583
while the boys are jumping of joy.

632
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,125
Shut those women up.
My head's splitting.

633
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,917
Babita's coming to PVS Mall tonight.

634
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,583
Babita, who?

635
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,333
Babita, who?

636
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,500
Babita Kumari!

637
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,042
Your bride.

638
00:46:58,417 --> 00:46:59,667
Your wife.

639
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,250
The one who'll enter this house
with bridal bells on her feet.

640
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,417
The one who'll feed your children.

641
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:09,958
The one who'll have henna
painted on her hands. Bauua Singh!

642
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,583
The irony of love!

643
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,667
Before I die,
she has come to meet me in person.

644
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,917
God is great!

645
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,833
Don't rub any more inches off me.

646
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,958
Get the scooter out, Guddu.

647
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,333
"Fill my brow with stars!"

648
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:40,875
"My beloved is here."

649
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,583
- Babita!
- Jitu! Fast!

650
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:48,375
I called you two hours ago.
Babita, costume and everything is ready.

651
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,750
Now you have.. Oh, no!

652
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,333
Did you bet?

653
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,667
I'll bet 500.

654
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,333
Call him.

655
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,125
He won't pick up.

656
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,750
I know his father too.

657
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,417
All cons.

658
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:09,333
Best of three.

659
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,333
The number you're trying to reach
is currently busy.

660
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,583
How about the best of five, ma'am?

661
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:24,250
The number you're trying to reach..

662
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,125
Shall I call back?

663
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,583
Okay. Let's try.

664
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,583
The number you're trying to reach
is currently busy.

665
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,958
Can I come in?

666
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:01,417
Yes. No one's bathing.

667
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,750
Madam, shall we leave?

668
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,250
It's a three-hour drive to Meerut.

669
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:15,667
Okay.
How much did I lose?

670
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:18,958
25,000. But you can pay 15,000.

671
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:27,583
Here. Go, get my bag.
I'll pay the rest later.

672
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,292
It's already in the car.
You please get ready.

673
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:35,125
- Shall we go?
- Hello! Costume, make-up and hair.

674
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,750
Clothes done.

675
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,958
Hair done.

676
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,583
I'm so pretty. Don't need make-up.

677
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,417
"Your love isn't true, beloved."

678
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,833
"Now I know how selfish you are."

679
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,792
"You change girlfriends every day."

680
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,042
"Your betrayal got to me."

681
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,042
Hey, Babita! Turn around!

682
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,875
She's a heroine!

683
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,333
Look at me!

684
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,875
"Now I know how selfish you are."

685
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:24,708
"You change girlfriends every day.
Your betrayal got to me."

686
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:25,917
Babita!

687
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,583
"You better go tell God"

688
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,250
"that I'm going to dupe people today."

689
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,917
"And you're to be blamed for it.
You better get this straight."

690
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:41,333
To heck with you!

691
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,917
Heard what she said!

692
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,833
She proposed to you.

693
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:51,625
- I love you!
- Give me a kiss!

694
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,167
"Your love was fake."

695
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,958
Babita, my sweetheart!
Look at me!

696
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,292
Bauua, faster.

697
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,917
- You want me to fly it like a helicopter?
- Step on it.

698
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,792
Move away!

699
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,083
Bauua, stay in your limits!

700
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,375
- Are you following your mother?
- No, your sister.

701
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:32,708
- Your daughter.
- No, my sister-in-law.

702
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:36,208
I'll teach you a lesson.

703
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,125
We'll get you.

704
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,000
Give him one.

705
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:44,000
- Don't flash your torch. Kick him.
- Hold on.

706
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,708
- I can't see them.
- They're behind us.

707
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,917
You blinded me in one eye
when we were kids. Remember?

708
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,292
- I can't see.
- Kick now!

709
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,708
I paid for your mother's surgery.

710
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:05,125
Why follow my bride? You selfish man!

711
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,458
- Is that Acchan?
- Yes.

712
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,792
Here. Pay your father's bail.

713
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,917
Grab it. Get your sister married.

714
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,417
Go grab it!

715
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,792
Guddu, there are still some jokers
around.

716
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,917
Push them under the bus.

717
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,875
Guddu, hold on tight.

718
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:28,792
Pull the banner.

719
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,667
Where are you going!

720
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,000
Stop the car.

721
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,625
- Pull over.
- Babita, what are you doing?

722
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,708
What happened?
What's going on?

723
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:59,000
Babita Kumari's car has stopped.

724
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,458
Her car?

725
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,458
She's coming out.

726
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,042
- Really?
- Yes.

727
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,792
Guddu, she's calling me.

728
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,208
- God! But why?
- How would I know why?

729
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,000
Go!

730
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:44,708
Do you love me?

731
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,458
Do you love me?

732
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:53,708
Love you too.

733
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,000
I also loved him.

734
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,542
But I guess all you men
just have that

735
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:07,875
- cheating gene in your DNA.
- No..

736
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,875
I like you in shorts,
I like you in jeans too.

737
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,208
Same, same.

738
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,458
- I want to kill all you men.
- No kill, Babita.

739
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,542
Already dead, dead.

740
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:30,292
Now go back to your pathetic life

741
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:35,708
in your pathetic town
and spend the rest of your life

742
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:39,458
telling everyone
that Babita Kumari kissed you.

743
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:42,625
No one will ever believe you.

744
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,000
No one will ever believe you.

745
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:54,542
In fact, no one will ever believe me
that I loved him so much.

746
00:54:56,875 --> 00:55:01,292
So much that I'm crying
for that pathetic man.

747
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,875
I'm crying for that..

748
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:08,458
I hate myself.

749
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,000
Babita, come.

750
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:15,375
- Bauua!
- Easy, easy.

751
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,333
Why have you left me alone?

752
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,875
Where's Bauua?
Has she taken him away?

753
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,292
Guddu.

754
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,542
Babita Kumari kissed me, Guddu.

755
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:37,917
Your mother never kissed your father.
Why would Babita Kumari kiss you?

756
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,625
I swear!

757
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:44,542
She kissed me passionately.
The kiss lasted three seconds.

758
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,542
O' people of the world!

759
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,000
You have never respected me.

760
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,458
Look, there goes the dwarf!
Here comes the dwarf.

761
00:55:56,708 --> 00:56:00,000
Today Babita Kumari kissed the dwarf.

762
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,875
- I'm going to sing a song.
- Hey, Bauua.

763
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:07,292
- I'm going to sing a song.
- God, forgive us.

764
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,917
Don't say such crazy things,
Your Majesty.

765
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,167
You're marrying tomorrow.

766
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,750
Maybe it's given you
a brain hemorrhage.

767
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,375
It happens before a wedding.
Let's go.

768
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,375
Let me sing first.

769
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:25,500
Yes, we're on our way.
The boy looks nice in his photo.

770
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:29,375
He has cute dimples.
What does he do?

771
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,833
His father owns a big business.

772
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,500
But, Dad

773
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,375
he's a little short.

774
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,750
So what?

775
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,917
Your granddad was only 5'6".

776
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,583
But what a gem!

777
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:49,167
- Is he tall enough to reach you?
- Yes, he is.

778
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:53,292
"Come, my beloved,
let us meet in the moonlight."

779
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,500
"Seeing you, the wilderness will turn
to spring."

780
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:04,542
"In this rain-soaked night.."

781
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:12,250
I'll walk this road! My foot.

782
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,167
Guddu, I don't want to get married.

783
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,667
I'm not ready.

784
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,792
Enough, Ashok!

785
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,667
Is this a joke?

786
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:42,250
You said he was short,
but this short?

787
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,583
You call this short?

788
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:48,333
Pritpal, do you call this short?

789
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:51,833
- He's a dwarf.
- A dwarf!

790
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,500
You're a top scientist,
and you want to marry him?

791
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,708
A dwarf?

792
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,083
I'm hardly a Cinderella, Dad.

793
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:03,500
What can I do if I'm in love with a dwarf?

794
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:07,250
You've fallen for a school dropout?

795
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,542
Should I have checked
his school certificate first?

796
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:15,875
I don't have to send him to Mars, Mom.

797
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,333
Dad.

798
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,500
This is the first time
I've met someone

799
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:33,417
who sees me, not my wheelchair.

800
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:37,250
He talks to me like a human being.

801
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,875
He doesn't think

802
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:44,083
about how one must talk
to a disabled girl.

803
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:48,417
He treats me like a normal girl.

804
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:53,333
- He doesn't pity me, Dad.
- Pity!

805
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,167
A dwarf pitying you?

806
00:58:55,417 --> 00:59:00,083
That's enough, please!
Are you marrying him? Or am I?

807
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:03,625
Dad!

808
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:12,875
Okay. Now I want to see everyone
having a good time here.

809
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,667
- DJ!
- Yes?

810
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,583
Let's have a Pashto song.

811
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:19,042
What's Pashto?

812
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:25,875
- Then play an English song.
- Don't have any English songs.

813
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:30,958
Play a song in any language.

814
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,875
An Afghani song then?

815
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,417
Go on, play!

816
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,125
Oh, Dad, remember this song?

817
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,750
Duffer!

818
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,917
Let me ward off the evil eye

819
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,833
- or you might die.
- Get lost.

820
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:54,375
Your family duped you.

821
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,292
The post office played a trick too.

822
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,542
What's this?

823
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,375
Remember you enrolled for the Babita
dance contest? You're in.

824
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:06,792
This..

825
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,375
Come on!

826
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:29,708
"I'll say a prayer in your name."

827
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,292
"Day and night.."

828
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:48,833
It's nice and cool outside.
- Bauua, come inside.

829
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,417
- Bauua.
- What!

830
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:52,167
Congratulations!

831
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:56,000
These notes aren't fake.
Give them to me later.

832
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:59,542
I think you should take him to America.

833
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:03,833
- What is it?
- Well.. Sir..

834
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,792
Go on. You can talk to him.

835
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,292
Sir, where's the toilet?

836
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,708
Do it anywhere.

837
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:17,375
Go ahead.

838
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,375
He pees in small amounts.

839
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:23,542
Take him to the US.
Charge people to see him.

840
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,417
- Hey, girl, come here.
- Come on!

841
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,667
Come, let's go.

842
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,000
Hello! Excuse me!

843
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:58,958
Ma'am! Yes, you.

844
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,375
- How are you related?
- Her aunt.

845
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:02,833
You can stay.

846
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:05,667
- And you?
- Her father's sister's..

847
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:10,625
Out. Anyone who doesn't know
how they're related must go.

848
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:14,000
Her father's so-and-so,
etcetera, won't do. All out!

849
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,625
Kids, go outside.

850
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,083
What are you doing, Bauua?

851
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,667
What I'm about to say,
and what you're about to hear

852
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,750
only your close relatives

853
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,833
will be of help to you.

854
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:43,375
In romance, there come 10 seconds
when a man says, let's marry.

855
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:47,083
You and my father didn't give me
those 10 seconds.

856
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:50,458
You visited our house.
Two days later, it's done.

857
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:53,917
The musical ceremony in three days.
All of Meerut at my wedding in four.

858
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:57,750
Now I stand before you,
a bridegroom.

859
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,667
Are you proposing now?

860
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:09,458
Proposing? I'm talking
about opposing, Aafia.

861
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:15,208
I'm like the cuckoo.

862
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,833
I can't build my own nest.

863
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:19,667
I lay eggs in the nests of other birds.

864
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:23,458
All this, this wedding..

865
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,833
My hands are tied.

866
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,542
I really can't.

867
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,750
You're an American.
Why did you agree to marry me?

868
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:36,125
I took you for a modern girl.
You drink and all.

869
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:40,000
How come you suddenly became
the traditional wife?

870
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:44,000
You'll look odd fasting
for the health of your husband.

871
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:48,833
Come here.

872
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,917
How old are you, Bauua?

873
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:02,542
38!

874
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:05,625
- Meaning?
- 39.

875
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,375
In all these years

876
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,750
have you found anyone besides me

877
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:24,292
whom you could look in the eye
and talk to?

878
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:30,000
Everyone towers over you.

879
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:35,292
How long will you crane your neck?

880
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:40,292
You look at me straight in the eye.
I look at you straight in the eye.

881
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:44,750
We're made for each other.

882
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:49,750
Why be a cuckoo at your age, Bauua?

883
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,458
Build your own nest.

884
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,667
Don't, Aafia. Don't.

885
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:00,750
My heart can hear you.

886
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,917
But my heart does not hear you.

887
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:12,000
Control both your hearts.

888
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:16,083
Have a drink if you need to.

889
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,542
Go and sit in the groom's chair. Go.

890
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,625
Don't be scared.

891
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:28,458
The operation will be over
before you know it.

892
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,542
But if there's something else,
tell me.

893
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,917
What is this?

894
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:50,083
I've been selected
for a dance contest.

895
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,542
The winner meets Babita Kumari.

896
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,208
So?

897
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:02,083
You've hardly been selected
for UPSC.

898
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,750
Babita Kumari kissed me last night.

899
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:32,000
Look at your height, Bauua.

900
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,292
If Babita kissed you

901
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:39,292
then I'm carrying
Leonardo DiCaprio's child.

902
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:46,208
You've ruined my make-up.
Go!

903
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:48,958
You see

904
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,375
I was born a cuckoo

905
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,833
and I'll die as one.

906
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:02,083
Don't be sad.

907
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:07,417
I'll run away.

908
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,625
I'll run away.

909
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You'll run away!

910
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:16,625
Go, wait outside.

911
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,625
Go, wait outside.

912
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:56,542
Little chap, sit down!

913
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,083
No, sir.

914
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:03,083
I'm not staying. No.

915
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,542
- Shall I show you a magic trick?
- What trick?

916
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,083
- Can you count?
- Yes.

917
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,208
- So count one..
- One..

918
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,292
- Two..
- Two..

919
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,750
- Three..
- Three..

920
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:24,833
Where are you going?

921
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,375
Stop!

922
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:56,083
Darn you, people of Meerut!
Get lost!

923
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:09,417
Where to, mister?
Ticket?

924
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:29,250
A man is basically 4'6".

925
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:32,125
Anything above that is arrogance

926
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,708
Babita made me arrogant
by kissing me.

927
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,958
Now I'm a six-footer.

928
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,667
I've left behind my family, friends
and Aafia.

929
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,667
But Bauua Singh would never
leave behind his courage.

930
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:50,625
Bauua Singh has won
five dance rounds

931
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:54,208
by defeating his rivals
and winning their hearts.

932
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,375
He's through the semi-finals

933
01:09:57,625 --> 01:10:02,458
and now Bauua Singh comes
for the grand finale of the show.

934
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:09,542
He will now have to dance
against two professionals.

935
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,917
Ladies and gentlemen

936
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:22,500
please welcome Ganesh Acharya

937
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,500
and Remo D'Souza.

938
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:31,958
Whether Bauua Singh wins or loses
will be decided by

939
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:35,292
yes, my friends,
I present to you

940
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:38,542
the glory of Dabangg,
the life of Tiger

941
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:42,125
Salman Khan!

942
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:46,625
"I'm done for."

943
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:53,917
"I'm in trouble."

944
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:07,958
"I drank the nectar of love"

945
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,958
"and lost all sense of reason."

946
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:14,542
"I am the great lover."

947
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,875
"Let no one come in my way."

948
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:24,375
"The look in her eyes
makes my head spin."

949
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:27,792
"Since she became mine"

950
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:31,458
"the world seems full of lovers."

951
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,042
"I swear."

952
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:34,792
"By God."

953
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:41,458
"My heart has been taken over by love."

954
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:46,167
"My heart has been taken over"

955
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,792
"by love."

956
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,375
"How would you know"

957
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:22,125
"where the bird of love
flies in the sky?"

958
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,625
"My love is like a shadow"

959
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,375
"falling wherever it pleases."

960
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:35,125
"Love pierces your heart
with the sharpest dagger."

961
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:37,292
"When the pain increases"

962
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:42,292
"living life is more pleasurable."

963
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:47,042
"Our meeting is so unique."

964
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:52,125
"Our meeting is so unique."

965
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,542
"She's a wave, I am water."

966
01:12:55,792 --> 01:13:01,958
"You are the river. I am the shore.
The waves roll my way."

967
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:07,125
"My heart has been taken over"

968
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,708
"by love."

969
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:25,458
"I love her deeply."

970
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,792
"She loves me deeply."

971
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,125
"I can't live without her."

972
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,375
"She's incomplete without me."

973
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:39,875
"I'll make her turn away from you."

974
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,125
"You may be her yes-man,
but she won't listen to you."

975
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:46,375
"She has so many admirers,
how could she care for you?"

976
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,708
"You're not tall enough
to have big dreams."

977
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,958
"You've become too big
for your boots."

978
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:56,292
"You're a crazy Indian,
she's a foreign fairy."

979
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:59,708
"For me, only love counts."

980
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:02,958
"That's why I'm an Indian lad,
and she's a foreign lass."

981
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:06,208
"You've won my heart
with your words."

982
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:09,833
"Let's be friends,
let's shake hands."

983
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,708
"Let's be friends."

984
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:19,875
"Let's shake hands."

985
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:29,375
Bauua! Bauua!

986
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:32,750
Bauua! Bauua!

987
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,708
Aafia!

988
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:08,958
Babita!

989
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,625
Babita!

990
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:19,458
Okay, listen, I've reached.

991
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:22,708
Call you later. Okay. Bye.

992
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:27,958
Mind your strap, babe!

993
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,958
Sweetheart, that's why
they come to see me.

994
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:35,708
Babita Kumari can't control herself
or her clothes.

995
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:39,125
Wardrobe malfunction
at her own film's success party!

996
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,292
Let them enjoy!

997
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:18,375
Your eyes are full of pain.

998
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:19,542
Excuse me?

999
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,708
Did he say that to you?

1000
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:24,708
I have a complaint.

1001
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:27,708
Why didn't we meet before?

1002
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,375
Did he tell you?

1003
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:33,542
Tell me.

1004
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,625
Did he ask you to sit on his lap?

1005
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,167
- What are you doing, babes?
- Let go!

1006
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:49,625
- Stop that.
- Vinod, get me a drink.

1007
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,125
Let's go.

1008
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:58,125
One fine day, he just got bald.

1009
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,458
But he looks so funny bald!

1010
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:03,792
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi. How are you?

1011
01:17:03,917 --> 01:17:08,625
"May your life be enlightened."

1012
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,208
Hurry, Bauua.
Madam is on her way.

1013
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,042
- What is this?
- Hurry up.

1014
01:17:15,292 --> 01:17:17,958
- Keep moving.
- Let me finish eating.

1015
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,958
There she is.

1016
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:22,208
Bring her here.

1017
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,708
Another tacky party.

1018
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,875
You must meet him.

1019
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:35,125
- What is it? Who must I meet?
- The winner of the dance contest.

1020
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,792
Don't worry.

1021
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,875
You look fine.

1022
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,375
Hi. Babita Kumari.

1023
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,292
Bauua Singh from Meerut,
Uttar Pradesh.

1024
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:57,375
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

1025
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:00,125
I've known you for 15 years.

1026
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,375
Yes, we've met. In Meerut.

1027
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:05,292
Don't remember.

1028
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:09,458
Anyway, congratulations on winning
the dance competition.

1029
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,208
Keep watching my films.

1030
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:22,458
Was I drunk in Meerut?

1031
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:25,542
Not that drunk.

1032
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,208
Did I kiss you?

1033
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:34,292
No way! Meerut guys aren't that lucky.

1034
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,125
I do crazy things when I'm drunk.

1035
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:45,958
Good.

1036
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,875
It's all good.

1037
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:49,917
Ladies and gentlemen!

1038
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:52,250
You're all such important people.

1039
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,958
You have travelled the world
and seen so much.

1040
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,917
But it's the first time you'll see

1041
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:03,167
a dwarf plucking stars
from the sky.

1042
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:04,875
- Mr. Tiwari.
- Yes.

1043
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,917
This boy's not on my team.

1044
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:09,583
- If he messes up, don't cut my share.
- Okay.

1045
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,333
I just play the music.

1046
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,833
Okay. Start!

1047
01:19:13,042 --> 01:19:14,292
Come on.

1048
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,917
Come, madam,
let me show you magic.

1049
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:26,667
Ladies, gather around.
The show is for you.

1050
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,833
Come, ladies.

1051
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:34,500
I've always encouraged new talent.

1052
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:37,125
Show us your star-plucking.

1053
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:41,708
You recognize talent.
Talent knows talent.

1054
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,375
I'll show you some magic.

1055
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,292
- Let's see your magic. Show us.
- Hi.

1056
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,833
- Oh, hi!
- Wait for us.

1057
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:53,458
Oh!

1058
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,542
Hello! You look wonderful.

1059
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:01,208
Some guy here is promising
to pluck stars like you!

1060
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,958
Bye.

1061
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:06,125
You're a newly-wed. I have to show you.

1062
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,583
My gift to you.
Watch the stars fall.

1063
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:09,875
Ready.

1064
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:13,667
Long live the Goddess!

1065
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:17,625
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1066
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:26,292
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1067
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,625
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1068
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:35,542
This is..

1069
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,417
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

1070
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,875
Come on! What's going on?

1071
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:44,500
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1072
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,833
It'll happen. It takes time.

1073
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,958
It's okay. Take your time.

1074
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,292
I..

1075
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:55,375
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1076
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:58,875
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1077
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,500
Come on!

1078
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,833
This is a new city,
that's why.

1079
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,083
Don't worry.

1080
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,500
Maybe they've fallen in Meerut.

1081
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,417
Forget Meerut.
I can do it here.

1082
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:16,208
Just watch. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1083
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,167
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1084
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,333
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1085
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:22,583
Let it be.

1086
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,708
You're not that talented.

1087
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:27,250
Madam, give me another minute.

1088
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,958
- Maybe next time.
- Please wait.

1089
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,458
- Bye.
- Please stay.

1090
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,542
You haven't taken a selfie.
Take one.

1091
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,583
What do you mean?

1092
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:38,417
- Bye.
- You're laughing?

1093
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:39,833
It's fine. Next time.

1094
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,292
I'm going tomorrow.

1095
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,250
- The moon.
- The moon?

1096
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:46,750
- Tried the moon?
- Only the stars.

1097
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,542
What's the hurry?

1098
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:52,125
Someone..

1099
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:54,958
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one..

1100
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:01,125
What's wrong?

1101
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:05,250
First time you've been humiliated
in public?

1102
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:07,833
Is that why you're sad?

1103
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:13,958
Bauua Singh from Meerut, UP.

1104
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,500
The stars used to listen to me, Ms. Babita.

1105
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:18,500
I don't know what's wrong.

1106
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:21,625
- They are..
- Of course they listen.

1107
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,042
Whose heart did you break, shorty?

1108
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:31,083
Yours, or hers

1109
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,000
or all the hearts in Meerut?

1110
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,417
Correct?

1111
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:39,875
They're only stars, shorty.

1112
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:44,500
That man used to say,
if I just looked at him

1113
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,333
the ground would slip away.

1114
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:49,958
Rubbish!

1115
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:53,375
I can't even put down
this wine glass.

1116
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:57,458
It's been two months
and it's still glued to my hand.

1117
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:02,208
Shorty, when a heart breaks

1118
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,875
even a wretched dog doesn't hear it.

1119
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,167
At least your stars have dignity.

1120
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,958
Now that's a good line!

1121
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:16,208
Wow! Careful! Shall I walk you out?

1122
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:19,417
Is someone like you going
to walk out on me too?

1123
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,875
I've left the world for you.

1124
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,125
Just say the word.
I'll stay glued to you forever.

1125
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,042
Move away! Say something new.

1126
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:30,792
That's a line from my old film.

1127
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:32,542
You're broken-hearted.

1128
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:35,083
Keep me by your side,
I'll amuse you.

1129
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:38,125
I'll make you laugh
at least 25 times a day. I promise.

1130
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:41,625
- I don't want to. It's not important.
- Okay, fine.

1131
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,333
I can advise you on what to wear,
with matching lipstick.

1132
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,958
I already pay ten people to do that.

1133
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,750
If you're that smart,
why is your heart broken so often?

1134
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:56,292
Babita, you understand
the world, but not people.

1135
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,250
- And you do?
- Well..

1136
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:02,167
I can tell the annual budget just
by looking at the Finance Minister!

1137
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:04,500
My specialty!

1138
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,167
That's useful.

1139
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:11,958
Let me decide if I want you glued to me.

1140
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,250
Come to the shoot tomorrow.

1141
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,625
- And this director?
- An idiot.

1142
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:28,042
- That one?
- Shrewd, a sharpie.

1143
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:31,333
Hi.

1144
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:37,458
Is she a friend or foe?

1145
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:40,167
Neither.

1146
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,542
She couldn't care less
if you lived or died.

1147
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,833
The gangsters are circling
the heroine.

1148
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,250
And him?

1149
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:52,417
Why does he take my breath away?

1150
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:56,667
Because he's a pillow girls love
smothering their faces in.

1151
01:24:56,958 --> 01:25:01,542
He pretends to be a poet.
Misunderstood by the world.

1152
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,125
- But he's a..
- That's enough.

1153
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,625
Ma'am, shot's ready.

1154
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,958
- What?
- The shot's ready.

1155
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,458
Not ready, dear. It's a wrap.

1156
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,208
Get lost.

1157
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:22,792
It's a wrap!

1158
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,667
Bauua, want a drink?

1159
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:29,333
What's today? Wednesday?

1160
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,083
Okay, I'll drink.

1161
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,500
Come. Close the door.

1162
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,750
I'm plain unlucky.
Falling in love with a..

1163
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:40,125
Enough! Let's throw up together.

1164
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:43,292
It's coming.
There it goes!

1165
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:50,333
Babita, in Uttar Pradesh,
people think you're an angel.

1166
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,333
That you sprout wings
behind closed doors.

1167
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:57,083
Your name may not matter to you here,
but keep your honor in my town.

1168
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:00,083
Get over that man.

1169
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:02,875
He's a cheap guava

1170
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:06,750
and you're a pricey Kashmiri apple.

1171
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,250
There's no match.

1172
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:14,125
- You're right.
- I know.

1173
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:15,792
A pricey

1174
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:19,458
Kashmiri apple.

1175
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:21,000
With wings!

1176
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,792
Come here.

1177
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,292
Do you have a large family?

1178
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,083
All of Meerut belongs to me!

1179
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:37,958
At home, there's mom, dad,
my younger brother, his wife and..

1180
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:41,083
- And?
- And Aafia.

1181
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:43,042
Aafia? Who's Aafia?

1182
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:45,875
This fantastic girl.

1183
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,167
Good thing the Goddess
put her in a wheelchair

1184
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:51,917
or she'd be flying in the air.

1185
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,042
She's as honest as I'm dishonest.

1186
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:59,250
She was the only one, apart from
my mother, who loved me.

1187
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,875
I ran away, leaving her in tears.

1188
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:06,625
Why? Did a mad dog bite you?

1189
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:10,250
Not a dog.
My dishonesty bit me.

1190
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,583
Then one night, India's queen kissed me.

1191
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:16,958
Want a slap? Move your foot!

1192
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,833
You've got long legs, please.

1193
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:26,333
So you forgot Aafia?

1194
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:29,625
Don't you miss her?
Why are you here?

1195
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:31,708
Because of you.

1196
01:27:32,042 --> 01:27:33,833
I do miss her

1197
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:37,792
but I scold myself and say,
I don't miss her.

1198
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:41,042
How long will you keep
scolding yourself?

1199
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:45,125
Do you know why I've kept you?

1200
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,750
Because I'm cute.
All the girls fall for me.

1201
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,375
They love my dimples.

1202
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:56,542
Cute! It took a thousand rascals
to make you.

1203
01:27:56,667 --> 01:27:59,625
- Really?
- Think I don't know that? - So, why?

1204
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,625
Because my parents were dwarves.

1205
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,708
Dwarves?

1206
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,917
They looked fine in the pictures.
You're kidding.

1207
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:12,667
They aren't my real parents.

1208
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,958
I met them outside a temple.

1209
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,292
My parents were dwarves.

1210
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,167
They worked in a circus in Kolkata.

1211
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:25,500
My mother was bought
from a Russian circus.

1212
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:28,625
And my father was a Punjabi.
Both dwarves.

1213
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,375
Amazing.

1214
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,667
Dad was a lion tamer

1215
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,792
- and mom was a trapeze artist.
- Then?

1216
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:40,958
They fell deeply in love with each other.
They got married.

1217
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,583
When my mother was pregnant

1218
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:46,375
the circus-owner's daughter
fell in love with dad.

1219
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,833
- Was she a dwarf?
- No, she was normal.

1220
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:56,208
She seduced dad, so he dumped
my mother and they eloped.

1221
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:02,958
- Then?
- They say she took him to Belarus.

1222
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:08,792
They were together for a while,
then she dumped dad.

1223
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:14,458
I heard she fell in love
with a Prince from Madagascar.

1224
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:18,833
- Then?
- She sold dad in an Egyptian market.

1225
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:22,375
Good heavens. Then?

1226
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:25,625
He worked in a circus in Egypt
for 10 years.

1227
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,375
Then he ran away to Yemen

1228
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:30,083
and worked in an oil well.

1229
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,458
People who knew him said

1230
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:34,583
he loved my mother till the end.

1231
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:39,000
When he died, he had a smile on his lips
and my mother's name.

1232
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,708
- Alina.
- He loved her! Utter rubbish!

1233
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,042
Why didn't he go back to your mother?

1234
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:49,500
She was dead by then.

1235
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:58,042
When did she die?

1236
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:01,250
By the time he returned to Kolkata,
20 years later

1237
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:03,250
she was already dead.

1238
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:08,125
Why didn't he go back to her sooner?
To Alina?

1239
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,542
My mother had remarried by then.

1240
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,167
To a dwarf?

1241
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:15,875
No, he was normal.

1242
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:18,292
Must they all marry normal people?

1243
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:25,458
- When did she remarry?
- Six years after dad had left, I guess.

1244
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:29,458
Why didn't he return to Alina
in all those years?

1245
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:33,208
If he loved her,
surely he should have gone back.

1246
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:35,167
He should have.

1247
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,417
Why didn't he?

1248
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:39,542
You tell me.

1249
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,083
When people love each other,
why don't they stay together?

1250
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:45,208
Tell me.

1251
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,250
Stop the car. I have to pee.

1252
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,583
I must pee.

1253
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:07,750
Sorry, madam. But your mother lives
on 12th Road in Bandra.

1254
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:10,667
But he doesn't know that!

1255
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:15,042
I was narrating the story of my next film.
How is it?

1256
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,542
It's a horror film, madam,
but very good.

1257
01:31:20,292 --> 01:31:22,333
Today we're filming
the most important scene.

1258
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,625
She's made us wait two hours.
Bauua, persuade her to come.

1259
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:29,375
I'll go and check.

1260
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:53,250
Okay.

1261
01:31:55,542 --> 01:31:56,833
I'll call you this evening.

1262
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:00,708
Hey, buddy.

1263
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:06,792
He begged me to forgive him.
He said he'd never do it again.

1264
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:09,958
He loves me.
Everyone makes mistake.

1265
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,542
How does this work?

1266
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,542
Hello?

1267
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:54,458
"Happy birthday to you!"

1268
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:57,292
"Happy birthday to you!"

1269
01:33:57,417 --> 01:34:00,875
"Happy birthday, dear Babita!"

1270
01:34:01,042 --> 01:34:03,208
"Happy birthday to you!"

1271
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,208
Let me through.

1272
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:17,125
He's a cheat.

1273
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,958
I saw him kissing that girl.

1274
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:22,833
What the heck!
He's lying, Babita.

1275
01:34:23,167 --> 01:34:25,208
Me? Lying?

1276
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:28,125
Admit it! Weren't you kissing him
in the kitchen?

1277
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,333
That was my boyfriend.
I wasn't kissing Aditya.

1278
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,958
Same thing.
Everyone is kissing someone.

1279
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,083
He kissed her, she kissed him.

1280
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:40,208
She kissed me, I kissed her.

1281
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:43,083
These two guys kissed that girl
and she kissed someone else.

1282
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,500
I didn't expect this from you, Babita.

1283
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:49,750
I swear by God!

1284
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:52,167
Bauua Singh ran away for love.

1285
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:53,792
Honestly.

1286
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:57,458
If he's come back, it's not for love.
He's conning you.

1287
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:59,292
Babita, how do you bear this guy?

1288
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:01,208
- For the past ten months, he's..
- Shut up!

1289
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:04,458
What did you bring for Babita?

1290
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:08,917
This silly ring? How much was it?

1291
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:11,583
A million rupees? Two million?

1292
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,750
Let me show you
what I've brought her.

1293
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,083
Look!

1294
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:18,708
Only for Babita.
Diamonds.

1295
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:20,833
A locket.

1296
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:24,667
A chain.
A chocolate.

1297
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:29,750
A birthday card.
A ribbon.

1298
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:33,458
A hair clip.

1299
01:35:33,667 --> 01:35:38,542
An Aadhar ID card.
Why are you laughing?

1300
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:43,208
What did you bring?
You've brought her a stupid ring.

1301
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:45,917
A nasty little ring.
A stupid ring.

1302
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:49,750
- Enough!
- Your nasty ring. Let go of me!

1303
01:35:49,917 --> 01:35:51,708
- Get out of here!
- Your nasty ring!

1304
01:35:51,917 --> 01:35:54,958
Lover boy! Listen to me.

1305
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:57,083
Just arrived?
The party's over.

1306
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:01,167
You lot come here all dolled up,
looking for fun.

1307
01:36:01,292 --> 01:36:03,500
- Stop it!
- You'll drink, you'll blow air kisses.

1308
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,917
You love to party.

1309
01:36:06,042 --> 01:36:09,125
While I love spoiling them.

1310
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:11,667
Get out! What did you think?

1311
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,792
If I bothered to talk to you,
you'd become special for me?

1312
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:17,583
I spoil you rotten
and you exploit me?

1313
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:21,000
- Get out!
- Don't let me go! Humiliate me some more.

1314
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:24,458
Or else I'll never leave.
Humiliate me some more.

1315
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,208
- You're a zero, Bauua Singh!
- Humiliate me more!

1316
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:30,750
You're nothing. You have zero status.
Your wheelchair girl is zero.

1317
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:32,792
- You'll achieve nothing.
- Good going.

1318
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:35,667
Be with her, but you'll still be zero.

1319
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:39,500
- Don't hold back, Babita.
- Go home, Bauua.

1320
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:42,875
This time tell the people of Meerut

1321
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,042
that Babita Kumari kicked you
out of her house.

1322
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:49,292
Your wheelchair girl
didn't believe I kissed you

1323
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:51,000
but she'll believe I threw you out.

1324
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:55,417
- You're nearly there. A little more.
- I'm done with you.

1325
01:36:55,833 --> 01:37:00,125
Want to be disgraced some more?
Go jump in the lake. Out!

1326
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:05,125
Done.

1327
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,167
Thank you, Babita.

1328
01:37:27,833 --> 01:37:28,792
Here you are.

1329
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:36,542
Thank you, fans.

1330
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,708
Hello, everyone. Party's over.

1331
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,708
DJ! Stop the music!

1332
01:37:57,292 --> 01:38:01,708
Put all the plates, glasses and bottles

1333
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:02,792
in the kitchen.

1334
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:05,333
Ma'am! Wake up.

1335
01:38:05,458 --> 01:38:06,667
Very good.

1336
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:09,667
What are you waiting for?

1337
01:38:18,417 --> 01:38:19,792
Mr. Kapoor

1338
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:24,083
- did you drive here?
- Yes, why?

1339
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:25,708
You better leave.

1340
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:28,875
Leave your glass in the sink.

1341
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,042
Take her with you.

1342
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:37,417
I guess, baby wants to party some more.

1343
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:38,875
What are you up to?

1344
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,125
I'm asking you to get out.
Politely.

1345
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:49,542
Should I say it some other way?

1346
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,208
You know another way?

1347
01:38:56,042 --> 01:38:57,583
Who do you think you are?

1348
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,333
An angel!

1349
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:03,708
I sprout wings behind closed doors.

1350
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:08,417
I can't break every heart in this country
for your sake.

1351
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:28,833
- Hello.
- Guddu, where are you?

1352
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,792
As far as I remember, you ran off
a year ago. I'm still here.

1353
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:35,958
- Want to go to America?
- Muslims get visas? Take me then.

1354
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:39,375
Done. Bring my passport with you
and meet me in Mumbai.

1355
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,583
Okay.

1356
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:41,958
- Listen.
- Yes?

1357
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,375
Dude

1358
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:48,292
my bride is actually the previous girl.

1359
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:51,917
Okay.

1360
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:56,625
Aafia!

1361
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:01,625
- Bablu, what's that dye?
- Henna.

1362
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:06,167
Forget the henna. Make me blonde.

1363
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:08,792
Full blonde!

1364
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,875
- Bauua Singh?
- Present.

1365
01:40:20,417 --> 01:40:21,875
They want to take my photo.

1366
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:23,917
Look here, please.

1367
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:32,542
Whoever we send to Mars
will travel in a comatose state.

1368
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,542
In fact, it is really so simple

1369
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:41,542
that we can train
a monkey to do it.

1370
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:46,917
And that is precisely what I have done.

1371
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:52,250
I'm sure, you don't believe me.

1372
01:40:52,792 --> 01:40:57,583
Ladies and gentlemen, let me present

1373
01:40:59,042 --> 01:41:00,375
Indya.

1374
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:35,917
Indya has an experience
of over 200 hours

1375
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:38,667
working underwater

1376
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,250
on a module
of an international space station.

1377
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:48,583
He can take 0-G pressure,
just like our astronauts.

1378
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:53,250
He's fully trained to drive

1379
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:56,250
- on the Martian surface.
- come, sit?

1380
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:02,333
And most importantly
Indya loves sleeping.

1381
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:05,958
What is she saying?

1382
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:10,500
- Something about Mars.
- Is she an astrologer?

1383
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,792
A monkey is a better idea

1384
01:42:12,917 --> 01:42:17,667
than getting extinct and starting
from a chimp again!

1385
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:40,958
Indya, no.

1386
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:44,125
- What's going on?
- The monkey's gone crazy.

1387
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:46,542
Indya, no!

1388
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:51,250
Indya, stop!

1389
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,750
Indya!

1390
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,042
Indya, no!

1391
01:42:57,042 --> 01:43:03,083
"If you promise to stay by my side"

1392
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:09,042
"I will sing lovely songs to you."

1393
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:24,958
"If you look at me and smile"

1394
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,292
"I will look at you and.."

1395
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:31,500
- What was that?
- A gunshot.

1396
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:33,167
- Who fired?
- Aafia.

1397
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:35,625
- How?
- She has a gun.

1398
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,375
- She's just scaring me.
- Scaring you?

1399
01:43:38,542 --> 01:43:40,458
Her hands shake.
That's why you're alive.

1400
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:43,250
We mustn't be scared.
We must be brave.

1401
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:44,875
We? You must.

1402
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:49,625
I paid Business Class for you to sightsee?
Get up! Come on!

1403
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:52,667
Careful. She has five bullets left.

1404
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:54,958
- You blind bat! I know how to count.
- Get up!

1405
01:43:56,917 --> 01:43:59,125
Here goes..

1406
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:06,083
"I saw you"

1407
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:12,667
"and my eyes refused to turn away."

1408
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,625
How you've changed, Aafia!

1409
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,792
Want a slap?

1410
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,750
How dare you come here!
Get out! Out!

1411
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:27,875
I don't need permission
to meet my wife, Father-in-law.

1412
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:30,167
Father-in-law?

1413
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,958
Ismail, throw this fellow out.

1414
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,875
Don't touch me.

1415
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,292
Stop! I am holding a baby.

1416
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:38,667
Get back, Ismail.
Let me talk to her.

1417
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:40,333
Let me talk to her.

1418
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,875
Aafia, I made a mistake. Forgive me.

1419
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,125
I'm not a cuckoo. I'm a crow.

1420
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:46,750
Forgive me.

1421
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:50,167
I will caw around you all my life.

1422
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:54,750
But you didn't stop me at our wedding.
You laughed at me.

1423
01:44:54,917 --> 01:44:56,750
- Shall I..
- Wait.

1424
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:58,750
This kid's life is in my hands.

1425
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:01,125
See at that baby.

1426
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:05,750
- It's look at that baby.
- Look at that baby, rascal.

1427
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,542
She's your baby.

1428
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,958
Aafia's daughter.

1429
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,750
Is she like Aafia?

1430
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:57,042
Or me?

1431
01:46:05,833 --> 01:46:07,958
So how can she be ours?

1432
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:20,292
- Hey, stop!
- Bauua!

1433
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,875
Let him go.

1434
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:31,458
"A perfect half-dream"

1435
01:46:31,792 --> 01:46:36,875
"once came to me."

1436
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:43,375
"Like a tear of happiness"

1437
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:51,833
"falling from my eyes."

1438
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:02,417
"Oh, God, have mercy on me."

1439
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:06,792
"My shadow seems cross with me."

1440
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:11,333
"Knowingly, unknowingly"

1441
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:17,333
"I find myself alone again and again."

1442
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,250
"Loneliness has no bounds."

1443
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:25,708
"I find myself alone again and again."

1444
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:29,292
"Loneliness has no bounds."

1445
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:44,500
"My eyes do not moisten
with drops of dew."

1446
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:53,042
"I could not belong to myself.
How could I belong to anyone?"

1447
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:58,208
"The depths of my heart"

1448
01:47:59,125 --> 01:48:02,875
"seek the truth."

1449
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:07,583
"Knowingly, unknowingly"

1450
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:15,667
"I find myself alone again and again."

1451
01:48:15,792 --> 01:48:19,125
"Loneliness has no bounds."

1452
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,417
"I will win her, make her mine"

1453
01:48:30,542 --> 01:48:32,542
"or sacrifice my life."

1454
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:34,542
"I will win her, make her mine"

1455
01:48:34,667 --> 01:48:36,625
"or sacrifice my life."

1456
01:48:36,792 --> 01:48:44,625
"My bad name foreshadows me."

1457
01:48:45,042 --> 01:48:49,125
"Knowingly, unknowingly"

1458
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,167
"I call out to my beloved."

1459
01:48:57,375 --> 01:49:01,083
"I want to stay forever with you."

1460
01:49:01,542 --> 01:49:05,500
"I call out to my beloved."

1461
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:09,708
"I want to stay forever with you."

1462
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:32,667
"Being unfaithful did nothing for me."

1463
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:40,542
"Let us see if faithfulness
will befriend me."

1464
01:49:40,667 --> 01:49:48,208
"Life turned its back and walked away."

1465
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:55,708
"Let us see if it returns
to smile on me again."

1466
01:49:55,833 --> 01:50:02,292
"Losing everything is easy for me."

1467
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:09,208
"Now I know how to regain what is lost."

1468
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:18,833
Just come, Guddu.

1469
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:20,500
- Listen, Bauua..
- It's my fault.

1470
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:23,250
I'll beg for her forgiveness.
Oh, the doors are closed.

1471
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:26,458
Mister! You, with the specs!

1472
01:50:26,583 --> 01:50:29,000
- Where are you going?
- Yes? Can I help you?

1473
01:50:29,125 --> 01:50:32,042
- The wheelchair girl who gave a speech..
- Aafia?

1474
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:34,875
Yes, Aafia. Has she left?

1475
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,750
She's gone. I got here late.

1476
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:39,208
Do you know her?

1477
01:50:39,417 --> 01:50:42,167
Yes, I'm her fiance.

1478
01:50:42,375 --> 01:50:45,625
- Fancy?
- Must be her cousin.

1479
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:50,417
- Can you tell me where I can find her?
- Yes.

1480
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:53,333
Here's her card.

1481
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,542
- Her card?
- All the best, gentlemen. Goodnight.

1482
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:04,875
Fancy!

1483
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:09,458
- Guddu, he doesn't look like her cousin.
- You're right.

1484
01:51:11,292 --> 01:51:13,333
NSAR.

1485
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:25,417
Guddu, our visa will expire
while we're standing in line here.

1486
01:51:25,708 --> 01:51:27,125
Let's sneak in.

1487
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:30,417
This isn't the Delhi-Meerut tollbooth.
You can't sneak through.

1488
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:34,333
Anyway, they think Muslims come here
to plant bombs. We'll get whacked.

1489
01:51:34,458 --> 01:51:37,458
- What shall we do?
- Ask this lady.

1490
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:38,833
- Shall I?
- Go.

1491
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:40,458
- Side, please.
- My space.

1492
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:43,167
- Ma'am.
- Blind man coming.

1493
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,917
We're middle-class Indians.

1494
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:48,708
- Are you Indian?
- No, lower middle-class British.

1495
01:51:49,625 --> 01:51:50,833
- Quit India!
- The Kohinoor?

1496
01:51:50,958 --> 01:51:52,625
We'll tax you double.

1497
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,458
What do you want?
I speak Hindi. So talk in Hindi.

1498
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,708
She knows! Oh! Why this crowd?

1499
01:51:57,875 --> 01:52:00,375
Sir, NSAR selects seven people
every three years

1500
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,333
for their space program.

1501
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,167
They want to see if a human can survive
in space.

1502
01:52:06,292 --> 01:52:08,792
- Understand space?
- You mean pace?

1503
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:11,667
- Beyond the sky. Up there.
- Oh, that space!

1504
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:15,083
- Can a man survive there?
- Okay.

1505
01:52:15,208 --> 01:52:17,167
There's six months of tests.

1506
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:20,250
Today's the first selection round.
You get paid too!

1507
01:52:20,375 --> 01:52:22,792
- You're in the right place.
- We've come to see Ms. Aafia.

1508
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,042
She works here.

1509
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:27,500
She approves the candidates.
References don't work.

1510
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,708
But shortcuts will!

1511
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:33,833
- Who is Bauua Singh?
- Present! See!

1512
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:36,583
- Here you go, sir.
- Blind man coming.

1513
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,792
- Blind man?
- That way?

1514
01:52:39,042 --> 01:52:41,750
- You've got the pass?
- Do you see this?

1515
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:44,167
- We've got the pass.
- Aafia knows us.

1516
01:52:46,667 --> 01:52:48,792
What's wrong?

1517
01:52:48,917 --> 01:52:50,083
What's this?

1518
01:52:50,208 --> 01:52:53,167
Where is Aafia?
I want to see her, please!

1519
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:54,375
- I want to see her.
- What's wrong?

1520
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,958
- You need to leave the premises.
- Let me go, please.

1521
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,417
- Please don't hit me. Let me go.
- One minute.

1522
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:02,625
Aafia is getting married.

1523
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:16,417
- Let him in.
- Sir, we're sending you inside.

1524
01:53:16,542 --> 01:53:19,458
- Yes, yes.
- Let us go. We won't come back.

1525
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:37,958
Hey, come on. Let's go.

1526
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,958
Aafia, I've only come to apologize.

1527
01:54:18,292 --> 01:54:21,833
I swear by the Goddess.
I knew nothing about the child.

1528
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:28,125
What's this invite?

1529
01:54:29,708 --> 01:54:32,500
Why are you marrying someone else
when you love me?

1530
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:38,833
You may not love me anymore,
but I still love you.

1531
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:44,667
Aafia, you were right when you said
we were made for each other.

1532
01:54:44,958 --> 01:54:46,625
We're a match made..

1533
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:18,542
Stop barking and listen to me.

1534
01:55:18,833 --> 01:55:21,708
Now we're truly equals, Bauua.

1535
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:25,792
We could talk eye to eye, that's all.
I've stooped to your level.

1536
01:55:25,917 --> 01:55:29,792
Your arrogant ways, your status,
your class.

1537
01:55:30,542 --> 01:55:34,792
I didn't know about the child, Aafia.
Do you think I knew?

1538
01:55:34,917 --> 01:55:36,917
When I came to your house

1539
01:55:37,042 --> 01:55:40,500
I came to tell you
not to be nervous, Bauua.

1540
01:55:40,625 --> 01:55:43,500
If I liked you, it was my problem.

1541
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:46,542
You wanted to change
your phone number, fine!

1542
01:55:46,667 --> 01:55:52,083
But your father wanted
to fix the wedding date!

1543
01:55:54,542 --> 01:55:56,375
Go away, Bauua.

1544
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,083
There's nothing left of Aafia.

1545
01:56:38,667 --> 01:56:40,250
Did you think

1546
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:45,167
I came all this way looking for you

1547
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:48,500
only to leave again?

1548
01:56:48,792 --> 01:56:51,333
So, you're trying it on?

1549
01:56:51,625 --> 01:56:54,375
You may be brave

1550
01:56:55,333 --> 01:56:57,208
but you have no feelings.

1551
01:57:13,792 --> 01:57:15,708
Hey, middle-class Indian!

1552
01:57:15,875 --> 01:57:17,625
Why are you looking miserable?

1553
01:57:18,042 --> 01:57:20,708
Well? Your shortcut didn't work?

1554
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:22,833
Want my help?

1555
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:35,583
- How old are you?
- What's age? I'm 38. 39.

1556
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:37,542
- And you?
- Ill-fated!

1557
01:57:37,667 --> 01:57:41,417
"We did have a fight."

1558
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:43,833
"It is an empty quarrel."

1559
01:57:48,208 --> 01:57:52,042
"All lovers argue, so you're mad at me"

1560
01:57:52,167 --> 01:57:55,042
"for a fleeting moment."

1561
01:57:56,083 --> 01:57:58,458
- The smell of gas reminds me of Meerut.
- Yes.

1562
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:03,292
"I'm all around you"

1563
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:08,208
"so how can we never speak?"

1564
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:14,083
"Though you look at me differently"

1565
01:58:14,667 --> 01:58:18,083
"my feelings are unchanged."

1566
01:58:20,542 --> 01:58:25,458
"I'll never let you go."

1567
01:58:25,875 --> 01:58:30,792
"Come what may,
I'll never let you go."

1568
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:36,333
"I'll belong to you alone."

1569
01:58:36,583 --> 01:58:40,833
"You can never get mad at me."

1570
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:50,250
"It is an empty quarrel."

1571
01:58:54,875 --> 01:59:00,708
"All lovers argue, so you're mad at me
for a fleeting moment."

1572
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:30,375
"I'll smile to lessen my sadness"

1573
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:35,083
"though my smiles seem false to me."

1574
01:59:35,292 --> 01:59:38,417
"Every day I'm filled with fear"

1575
01:59:38,625 --> 01:59:44,458
"that you may break my heart by mistake."

1576
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:48,333
"No matter how you treat me"

1577
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,375
"it will feel like love to me."

1578
01:59:50,542 --> 01:59:55,750
"Not knowing my boundaries
has always been my way."

1579
01:59:56,292 --> 02:00:01,167
"Being alone is not easy."

1580
02:00:01,542 --> 02:00:05,917
"Loneliness is hard to endure."

1581
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,917
"My name so longs"

1582
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:18,083
"to be united with yours."

1583
02:00:18,292 --> 02:00:23,542
"I'll never let you go."

1584
02:00:23,667 --> 02:00:27,667
"You can never get mad at me."

1585
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:35,042
"The quarrel between you and me"

1586
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:37,958
"is an empty quarrel."

1587
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:45,833
"All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me."

1588
02:00:46,083 --> 02:00:50,125
"for a fleeting moment."

1589
02:01:12,708 --> 02:01:16,875
- I like this Bauua Singh. Shorty is good.

1590
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:18,667
He's small, but very resilient.

1591
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:22,083
He's only passed his 10th grade, Srini.

1592
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:25,500
Sorry, I forgot your chimpanzee
graduated from MIT.

1593
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:28,542
We don't need an astronaut.

1594
02:01:28,667 --> 02:01:31,458
He has to sleep all the way
to Mars and back.

1595
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,542
We just need a right-sized subject
who'll take the risk.

1596
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:42,792
Aafia, I haven't figured out
if you love or hate this shorty.

1597
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:43,833
Okay?

1598
02:01:43,958 --> 02:01:46,458
But trust me, a man at my age,
I couldn't care less.

1599
02:01:46,958 --> 02:01:50,917
I don't have anything in my life beside
this project and your brains, Aafia.

1600
02:01:51,875 --> 02:01:54,958
I don't know about you.

1601
02:01:55,917 --> 02:01:57,167
Yes, fine.

1602
02:01:57,667 --> 02:01:58,958
Whatever you say.

1603
02:02:07,208 --> 02:02:08,500
Srini

1604
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:14,000
I feel angry all of a sudden.

1605
02:02:15,917 --> 02:02:19,417
And I feel like crying too.

1606
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:24,125
I am going to go now.
I'll see you at the office.

1607
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:27,333
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. I'll see you.

1608
02:03:40,625 --> 02:03:42,458
Are you angry with me?

1609
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:47,083
You're the one who's angry.
I'm trying to make it up to you.

1610
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:50,458
Do you love me?

1611
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:52,042
What do you think?

1612
02:03:53,583 --> 02:03:56,000
You love me a lot.

1613
02:03:57,958 --> 02:03:59,292
Do you love me?

1614
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:09,333
Will you do something for me?

1615
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,000
Anything.

1616
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:14,375
Go away.

1617
02:04:20,042 --> 02:04:21,875
Let me attend your wedding first.

1618
02:04:24,042 --> 02:04:25,458
Then I'll go.

1619
02:04:27,042 --> 02:04:28,875
Run away, Bauua.

1620
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,417
You're so good at running.

1621
02:04:31,667 --> 02:04:35,750
Break my heart then.
Like you've been doing.

1622
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:38,750
You'll die, you idiot!

1623
02:04:40,625 --> 02:04:42,333
Then watch me die.

1624
02:04:43,292 --> 02:04:44,833
I'll watch.

1625
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:51,208
The Mission Mars team is impressed

1626
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:53,833
by your performance, Bauua.

1627
02:04:53,958 --> 02:04:56,042
Your reports are amazing.

1628
02:04:56,167 --> 02:04:58,708
So is your endurance.

1629
02:04:58,917 --> 02:05:01,708
You have a high pain threshold.
You're sharp.

1630
02:05:01,875 --> 02:05:04,750
Applied intelligence is excellent.

1631
02:05:05,167 --> 02:05:07,542
The team says, ideally

1632
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:12,208
they would need a man like you
for the mission, not a monkey.

1633
02:05:12,542 --> 02:05:14,500
I agree with them.

1634
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:17,667
But you'd be risking your life.

1635
02:05:17,833 --> 02:05:20,292
It wouldn't matter to you
because you love me.

1636
02:05:20,458 --> 02:05:24,042
That poor monkey
is so attached to his family.

1637
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:27,333
While the very thought of your family

1638
02:05:27,458 --> 02:05:30,292
makes you uncomfortable.

1639
02:05:30,917 --> 02:05:33,417
The rocket's very safe, Bauua.

1640
02:05:33,542 --> 02:05:37,625
But I'll pray it crashes on re-entry.

1641
02:05:41,042 --> 02:05:42,750
Oh, I see.

1642
02:05:45,458 --> 02:05:47,625
Is that how you'll get rid of me?

1643
02:05:48,167 --> 02:05:49,625
Scare me away.

1644
02:05:54,375 --> 02:05:57,333
You can't bear marrying
anyone else when I'm around.

1645
02:06:01,292 --> 02:06:02,875
Admit it!

1646
02:06:03,583 --> 02:06:05,042
Go on.

1647
02:06:05,417 --> 02:06:07,333
Okay, I'll do it for you.

1648
02:06:07,958 --> 02:06:10,917
Who knows where you're sending me
or what you're asking!

1649
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:13,083
But on the day it happens

1650
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,583
make sure you get married.

1651
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:20,875
Bauua Singh isn't running this time.

1652
02:06:22,542 --> 02:06:27,167
The words you just said,
you'll forget them all

1653
02:06:27,458 --> 02:06:31,792
when you're in the shuttle travelling
at 30,000 kilometers per hour.

1654
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:34,958
The second you hear the noise it makes

1655
02:06:35,417 --> 02:06:37,458
you'll make a run for it.

1656
02:06:37,667 --> 02:06:39,083
When they count

1657
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:42,542
ten, nine, eight

1658
02:06:42,875 --> 02:06:45,167
- seven, six..
- Hello!

1659
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:48,917
When I was even shorter,
I could count backwards.

1660
02:06:49,542 --> 02:06:52,917
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

1661
02:06:53,708 --> 02:06:56,167
Launch me in your rocket!

1662
02:07:03,917 --> 02:07:05,417
Did a star shoot?

1663
02:07:11,042 --> 02:07:13,125
At last!

1664
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:35,125
God bless the stars!

1665
02:07:41,375 --> 02:07:43,875
Let anyone try to stop Bauua Singh now.

1666
02:08:22,667 --> 02:08:26,833
Bauua, what's going on?
The whites are applauding.

1667
02:08:26,958 --> 02:08:30,833
We're from Meerut, Bauua!
We dunk biscuits in our tea.

1668
02:08:30,958 --> 02:08:33,583
What do we care about rockets?
Or Mars?

1669
02:08:34,042 --> 02:08:37,625
Isn't Mars a faraway planet?
It's not a place to go sightseeing.

1670
02:08:37,792 --> 02:08:41,083
Wake up! Mars is not Saharanpur
from where you can sprint.

1671
02:08:41,375 --> 02:08:42,667
It's Mars!

1672
02:08:43,542 --> 02:08:45,208
She won't let me go.

1673
02:08:45,458 --> 02:08:46,917
I've seen the look in her eyes.

1674
02:08:47,375 --> 02:08:50,208
She can't do it.
The girl will stop me.

1675
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:57,167
We are on the verge
of a very big mission.

1676
02:08:57,292 --> 02:09:01,333
And tomorrow we decide when this
decade-long dream becomes a reality.

1677
02:09:01,792 --> 02:09:03,583
We sign off on the take-off date.

1678
02:09:03,792 --> 02:09:05,875
The next 48 hours are really crucial.

1679
02:09:07,458 --> 02:09:10,750
Once it reaches Mars,
the gravity of Mars will slow it down

1680
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:13,250
and finally we'll enter in orbit
around Mars

1681
02:09:13,375 --> 02:09:15,167
but the orbit will be elliptical.

1682
02:09:15,292 --> 02:09:18,125
NSAR is the world's most
reputed institution.

1683
02:09:18,292 --> 02:09:22,917
They have surprised everyone
by sending Bauua Singh to Mars

1684
02:09:23,042 --> 02:09:24,958
instead of a chimpanzee.

1685
02:09:25,333 --> 02:09:28,042
Bauua Singh is from Meerut in India.

1686
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:31,917
The amazing thing is, Bauua Singh is not
very educated

1687
02:09:32,042 --> 02:09:33,917
nor does he speak English.

1688
02:09:34,167 --> 02:09:37,750
This launch is a huge opportunity

1689
02:09:37,875 --> 02:09:39,708
to learn about

1690
02:09:39,833 --> 02:09:43,250
the potential of life beyond our planet

1691
02:09:43,458 --> 02:09:46,500
with the ultimate aim of becoming

1692
02:09:47,875 --> 02:09:51,333
a multi-planet species.

1693
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:06,125
Srini.

1694
02:11:06,542 --> 02:11:11,250
- You can't stay here for the launch.
- Why not?

1695
02:11:12,625 --> 02:11:16,458
Because we'll be getting married.

1696
02:11:19,583 --> 02:11:20,958
Are your calculations right?

1697
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,333
100 percent.

1698
02:13:04,125 --> 02:13:05,542
Are you crying?

1699
02:13:06,708 --> 02:13:08,667
- What?
- You're crying.

1700
02:13:10,167 --> 02:13:12,042
- You're crazy.
- You're crying.

1701
02:13:12,542 --> 02:13:14,500
- Don't talk nonsense.
- You're crying.

1702
02:13:33,208 --> 02:13:34,292
Oh.

1703
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,958
Hello? Yes, go ahead.
Doesn't matter.

1704
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:44,667
Okay. Copy that. Thank you.

1705
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:51,292
We're heading towards propulsion.

1706
02:14:14,125 --> 02:14:17,792
How long does it take
to travel 1.25 miles at 5.8 miles per hour?

1707
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:23,375
12.9 minutes.

1708
02:14:37,583 --> 02:14:40,833
It's only right I say goodbye.

1709
02:16:43,125 --> 02:16:45,500
Very good.

1710
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:50,958
Could I talk to him for a minute, please?

1711
02:16:53,667 --> 02:16:55,208
All systems ready.

1712
02:16:55,333 --> 02:16:56,625
Standing by.

1713
02:17:11,375 --> 02:17:14,500
You didn't run, Bauua.

1714
02:17:17,917 --> 02:17:19,500
If I didn't win you

1715
02:17:21,917 --> 02:17:23,792
let me bring glory to my country.

1716
02:17:26,875 --> 02:17:31,417
What do you care about the country?

1717
02:17:33,042 --> 02:17:36,958
You're dying for the sake of love.

1718
02:17:43,583 --> 02:17:46,417
If you were near me

1719
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:50,333
I'd kiss you.

1720
02:17:55,875 --> 02:17:57,292
I'd do the same.

1721
02:18:08,083 --> 02:18:13,083
I'll wait for you, Bauua.

1722
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:21,708
What if I don't come back?

1723
02:18:23,958 --> 02:18:28,625
I'll find someone your height.

1724
02:18:36,125 --> 02:18:38,792
T-minus two minutes mark, and counting.

1725
02:18:39,583 --> 02:18:40,667
Yes.

1726
02:18:44,083 --> 02:18:48,708
If I had asked you to,
would you have stayed?

1727
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:33,958
Flight controllers, give me a go,
no-go for launch.

1728
02:19:34,417 --> 02:19:35,958
Booster.
- Go for launch.

1729
02:19:36,167 --> 02:19:37,708
- Surge in.
- We are a go.

1730
02:19:37,875 --> 02:19:39,375
- Network.
- Go.

1731
02:19:39,708 --> 02:19:41,083
- Guidance?
- Go.

1732
02:19:41,208 --> 02:19:42,917
- Recovery.
- Go for launch.

1733
02:19:43,042 --> 02:19:44,875
- Capcom.
- We are go for launch.

1734
02:19:45,042 --> 02:19:47,042
Flight control, we are go for launch.

1735
02:20:06,083 --> 02:20:07,667
Bye, Bauua.

1736
02:20:15,417 --> 02:20:18,833
Six, five, four, three

1737
02:20:19,167 --> 02:20:22,250
two, one, zero.

1738
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:03,583
I kissed him.

1739
02:21:13,167 --> 02:21:16,042
There were so many amazing things
about my story.

1740
02:21:16,417 --> 02:21:17,958
It was like a dream.

1741
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,708
It wasn't amazing that

1742
02:21:19,833 --> 02:21:24,042
so many tears and smiles,
so much love

1743
02:21:24,958 --> 02:21:27,917
amount only to a trail of smoke
in the sky.

1744
02:21:29,167 --> 02:21:32,958
The amazing thing is that we know this,
yet we fall in love.

1745
02:21:34,542 --> 02:21:37,917
It was not a surprise that I cried
when Bauua left.

1746
02:21:38,458 --> 02:21:42,667
The amazing thing was that he didn't run.
The joy of that fact dried my tears.

1747
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:48,167
It wasn't amazing that an unknown
4'6" man from Meerut

1748
02:21:48,958 --> 02:21:53,292
was sent in a rocket to a planet
so very far away.

1749
02:21:54,250 --> 02:21:58,917
The amazing thing was that
he convinced over a billion people

1750
02:21:59,292 --> 02:22:00,833
that he could do it.

1751
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:05,542
It was not a surprise that Srini and I
did not get married.

1752
02:22:06,125 --> 02:22:11,458
The amazing thing was, after so much
loathing, I loved Bauua again.

1753
02:22:12,708 --> 02:22:17,542
The amazing thing wasn't
that Bauua reached Mars.

1754
02:22:18,042 --> 02:22:20,750
The amazing thing was
that he did not run away.

1755
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:24,958
The amazing thing wasn't that,
on re-entry, the shuttle

1756
02:22:25,083 --> 02:22:26,500
silently went missing.

1757
02:22:27,208 --> 02:22:31,292
The amazing thing was that
I kept waiting for Bauua to return.

1758
02:22:32,125 --> 02:22:33,042
The amazing thing wasn't that

1759
02:22:33,167 --> 02:22:38,167
Bauua, rejected by the world,
was even spat out by the sky.

1760
02:22:38,875 --> 02:22:41,500
One day,
the Chinese Space Centre got a call.

1761
02:22:41,708 --> 02:22:44,083
He was returning.

1762
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:49,708
The amazing thing was, it took
15 years for that phone to ring.

1763
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:54,375
The amazing thing wasn't that
Bauua Singh's shuttle

1764
02:22:54,625 --> 02:22:57,333
was re-entering towards
the Arabian Sea

1765
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:59,792
at a speed of 20,000 kilometers
per hour.

1766
02:23:00,458 --> 02:23:02,417
The amazing thing was

1767
02:23:02,917 --> 02:23:06,167
15 years had wrinkled
many faces, honey

1768
02:23:06,708 --> 02:23:11,667
but the dimples on my face
remained forever young. Right?

1769
02:23:21,958 --> 02:23:26,083
Long live

1770
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:29,958
the Goddess!

1771
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:09,000
"A color has no color"

1772
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:14,875
"if it does not match the color
of your lips."

1773
02:24:17,167 --> 02:24:20,833
"A fragrance has no fragrance"

1774
02:24:21,292 --> 02:24:26,583
"if it does not match the fragrance
of your dark hair."

1775
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:33,042
"The world pales next to you."

1776
02:24:33,208 --> 02:24:37,083
"You can only be mine."

1777
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:42,875
"Everyone can see it.
I say this out loud."

1778
02:24:45,875 --> 02:24:49,750
"As long as there's light in the world"

1779
02:24:49,958 --> 02:24:53,292
"you'll belong to me."

1780
02:24:53,875 --> 02:24:57,625
"As long as I live in this world"

1781
02:24:57,917 --> 02:25:01,292
"you'll belong to me."

1782
02:25:01,875 --> 02:25:05,542
"As long as there's light in the world"

1783
02:25:05,917 --> 02:25:09,500
"you'll belong to me."

1784
02:25:09,917 --> 02:25:13,500
"As long as I live in this world"

1785
02:25:13,917 --> 02:25:17,375
"you'll belong to me."

1786
02:25:57,958 --> 02:26:01,667
"I am your confusion."

1787
02:26:01,875 --> 02:26:05,458
"I am your solution."

1788
02:26:05,917 --> 02:26:09,500
"I'm a little stubborn."

1789
02:26:09,917 --> 02:26:12,958
"A little crazy too."

1790
02:26:13,125 --> 02:26:16,833
"How false are the clouds
and spring showers!"

1791
02:26:16,958 --> 02:26:21,125
"How false is offering
a gift of flowers!"

1792
02:26:21,292 --> 02:26:24,750
"Only you are real.
Only I am real."

1793
02:26:24,917 --> 02:26:29,083
"My heart speaks the only truth."

1794
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:33,083
"Etch your name on my heart
with your lovely hands."

1795
02:26:33,208 --> 02:26:37,083
"Open your eyes to my love."

1796
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:42,708
"Do I ask too much of you?
I say this out loud."

1797
02:26:45,917 --> 02:26:49,708
"As long as there's light in the world"

1798
02:26:49,917 --> 02:26:53,333
"you'll belong to me."

1799
02:26:53,875 --> 02:26:57,583
"As long as I live in this world"

1800
02:26:57,958 --> 02:27:01,083
"you'll belong to me."

1801
02:27:01,875 --> 02:27:05,583
"As long as there's light in the world"

1802
02:27:05,917 --> 02:27:09,375
"you'll belong to me."

1803
02:27:09,833 --> 02:27:13,833
"As long as I live in this world"

1804
02:27:13,958 --> 02:27:17,958
"you'll belong to me."

1805
02:27:37,792 --> 02:27:44,417
"Forever you will sway
in my loving arms."

1806
02:27:45,917 --> 02:27:52,208
"Like the earth sways
in the arms of the sun."

1807
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:59,375
"You will never be apart from me."

1808
02:28:01,292 --> 02:28:07,333
"Forever you will be a part of me."

1809
02:28:13,208 --> 02:28:17,167
"Shatter all my dreams if you wish."

1810
02:28:17,333 --> 02:28:21,042
"The shards of my dreams
will still dream of you."

1811
02:28:21,250 --> 02:28:24,833
"You are my inspiration."

1812
02:28:24,958 --> 02:28:29,167
"I say this out loud."

1813
02:29:16,208 --> 02:29:20,917
"Beloved, your love is fake.
I know you are selfish."

1814
02:29:21,375 --> 02:29:25,958
"You are unfaithful.
I'm not able to get over your betrayal."

1815
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:41,208
"Beloved, your love is fake.
I know you are selfish."

1816
02:29:41,625 --> 02:29:46,250
"You are unfaithful.
I'm not able to get over your betrayal."

1817
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:48,833
"Go and proclaim before God"

1818
02:29:49,208 --> 02:29:51,292
"that I'm going to dupe everyone."

1819
02:29:51,583 --> 02:29:55,375
"You are responsible for this,
let me tell you."

1820
02:29:59,167 --> 02:30:02,167
"Heer has been defamed"

1821
02:30:02,292 --> 02:30:04,375
"for falling in love with you."

1822
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:07,208
"Heer has been defamed"

1823
02:30:07,333 --> 02:30:09,375
"for falling in love with you."

1824
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:12,167
"Heer has been defamed"

1825
02:30:12,292 --> 02:30:14,583
"for falling in love with you."
