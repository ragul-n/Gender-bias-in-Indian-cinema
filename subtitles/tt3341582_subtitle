1
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey, you're back!

2
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,330
No power today either?

3
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,636
On, God!

4
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,772
You got drenched!

5
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,545
Didn't you carry an umbrella?

6
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,810
Chinmay,
didn't you take an umbrella along?

7
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,456
- It rained all of a sudden.
- Of course it will, it's the season!

8
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,958
Let's get you changed
or you'll catch cold.

9
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,453
Get that lamp inside.

10
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,701
That's it?

11
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,478
Starting tomorrow,
I'll make some bread too.

12
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,449
I'll set up the kitchen tomorrow.

13
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,384
Then I'll cook whatever you like.

14
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,933
What happened, Son?

15
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,398
Unable to sleep?

16
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,284
You always get grumpy when we relocate.

17
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,692
Even when you were a baby.

18
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,452
You just wouldn't sleep!

19
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,026
I'd just give up
and let your dad put you to sleep.

20
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,464
You'd cry all night.

21
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,507
He knew how to take care of you.

22
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,671
You were closer to him, anyway.
Weren't you?

23
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,746
That is not true!

24
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,544
You were the one
who wanted to sleep early.

25
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,950
So, you'd hand me over to Dad.

26
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,988
Then, he'd tell me stories!

27
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,085
Come on! What do you mean “sleep early“?

28
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,429
I needed to wake up early, didn't I?
So many chores in the morning!

29
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,895
Mom?

30
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,936
Can't you get your relocation canceled?

31
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,572
I've told you this before, my son.

32
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,784
How can it just get canceled?

33
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,447
I've been promoted.
We need to stay here at least for a year.

34
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,122
You'll get to like this place too.

35
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,760
You'll warm up to it.

36
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,767
Come on, now! Get to bed.

37
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,806
You have to be up early tomorrow
To be ready for school.

38
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,875
Get to bed, now.

39
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,680
Bandya, hurry up!
How much can we pamper this pup!

40
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,586
Bandya, is there enough gasoline?

41
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,131
Bravo!

42
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,661
Hold her tightly!

43
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,062
Come on, shove it already!

44
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,076
Oh, my poor puppy! What happened to you...

45
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,978
Yakku!

46
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,506
Wow! Awesome!

47
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,672
- Your uncle sent it.
- For me?

48
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,840
Of course!

49
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,549
Let me open it for you.

50
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Here!

51
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,292
- And for Sagar?
- He's got the same one too.

52
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,265
He chose it. Let him know you like it.

53
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,003
Now pack your bag, have a bath.

54
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,039
I'll drop you to school on my way to work.

55
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,313
Here you go. Don't be shy in the class.

56
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,986
If they don't mingle with you,
then you initiate it.

57
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,057
I should be going now.

58
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,127
I'll see you in the evening.
I'll come back early today.

59
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,311
Bastard specksy! Have you gone blind?

60
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,344
You're the one who's blind!
Didn't you just run into me?

61
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,643
- Want gasoline up your ass like that dog?
- I'll tell on you to the teacher!

62
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,914
Bastard!

63
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,249
Hey, who are you looking at?

64
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,159
New student? What grade are you in?

65
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,893
- Seventh.
- What?

66
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,993
Seventh grade.

67
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,934
You too? Me too,

68
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,362
and her too!

69
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:11,078
Hey, egghead, what are you ogling?

70
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,013
Bandya, you're pissing me off now.

71
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,054
If you call me an egghead, I'll punch you!

72
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,259
<i>Egghead'. Egghead'. Hum
p“; Dum p“; Egghead'.!</i>

73
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,797
<i>Egghead'. Egghead'. Hum
p“; Dum p“; Egghead'.!</i>

74
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,127
Good morning, teacher!

75
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,171
Good morning! Take your seats.

76
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,115
- Neeranjan Pakle.
- Here!

77
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,151
- Sidesh Shinde.
- Here!

78
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,220
- Omkar Mali.
- Here!

79
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,920
- Yuvraj Patil.
- Hasn't come in!

80
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,491
- Hasn't come in?
- Nope!

81
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,955
- Swarali Shirdhankar.
- Here!

82
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,122
- Shruti Jadhav.
- Here!

83
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,063
- Umesh Kadam.
- Here!

84
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,032
- Prakash Kunte.
- Here!

85
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,467
- Suhas Koli.
- Here!

86
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,402
Chinmay Kale.

87
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,873
Present, ma'am!

88
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,350
You're the new student from Pune?

89
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,975
You were awarded a scholarship
in fourth grade, right?

90
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,374
You must get a scholarship this year too!

91
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,151
Listen up!
We have a gifted scholar in class.

92
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,520
Chinmay Kale.

93
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,420
You all should learn from him.

94
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:09,933
Each one of you must get
the scholarship this year.

95
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,901
Do you all understand?
Hey, you at the back.

96
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,002
Y es, maam!

97
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:20,476
Let's all welcome Chinmay Kale
with a round of applause!

98
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,353
Enough!

99
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,012
Okay, now listen very closely.

100
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,152
Seventh grade is as crucial
as the tenth grade.

101
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,897
The NOC is pending. Do you have it?

102
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,896
What do you mean?

103
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,031
The “No Objection Certificate“ is due.
I can't approve without it.

104
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,905
What I mean is

105
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,333
I'll get the NOC later.
You just sign the document.

106
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,811
I can't do that.

107
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,943
I can't sign the approval
without the bank's NOC.

108
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,816
Sure, as per the law,
we should have the NOC.

109
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,946
But the law also has exceptions,
doesn't it?

110
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,525
Yes,
but they need to be prescribed by law.

111
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,127
Come on, ma'am, don't hold up
the procedure for a single document.

112
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:17,258
I am not! Get the NOC
and we'll be through in a minute.

113
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,069
What I am saying is,
you have a fair point.

114
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,198
We will get the NOC eventually.

115
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,275
You know how painful
and tiresome it is to procure an NOC.

116
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,283
Let's do it this way. You sign it
and I will quickly get the NOC.

117
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,519
How long does it take to sign?
Half a minute!

118
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,420
Get the NOC and I'll sign the document.

119
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,353
Ma'am, why don't you figure something out?
We'll do as you say!

120
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,262
Why do we need an NOC at all?

121
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,159
Why don't you ask us
for something more lucrative?

122
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,339
Looks like you don't understand.
Get the NOC...

123
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,240
Sir, greetings! When did you come?

124
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,942
What time is it, Nivte? You're late again!

125
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,482
Ma'am, I was...

126
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,314
If you had come earlier,
we wouldn't have to wait.

127
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,046
As in? Still not signed?

128
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,323
Sign? The lady is delaying it pointlessly.

129
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,619
Sir,
actually the lady has newly joined here.

130
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,560
She doesn't know how it works here.

131
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,603
Okay, perhaps I should learn
from you “how it works here“!

132
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,996
No, I didn't mean it that way, ma'am!

133
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,006
It's Mr. Salvi's old case.

134
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,603
I've been in on it for some time.
I'll explain it later.

135
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,506
Sir, I'll take care of it.

136
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,685
Don't keep me waiting!

137
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,484
- I'm on it, sir.
<i>- I'll</i> wait outside for you.

138
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,298
What's up, scholarship! Where do you live?

139
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,999
Near the temple.

140
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,506
Holy shit! I live there too!
Let's go together.

141
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,974
Let's take the shortcut.

142
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:21,991
Then the math teacher caned
everyone in sight!

143
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,160
He still doesn't know
who put crabs in his pocket.

144
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,690
Is that a new bag you got?

145
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,190
Yeah.

146
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,161
- Did you buy it in Pune?
- Yeah.

147
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,409
Is Pune really that big a city?

148
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,375
Then why did you come to this small place?

149
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,177
My mom got transferred here.

150
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,717
Oh! So your parents are here with you?

151
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,284
No. It's just me and Mom.

152
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,481
And your dad?

153
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,751
He passed away a year ago.

154
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,286
<i>How'?</i>

155
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,057
I don't know what it was,

156
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,724
but in his final days
he couldn't even recognize anyone.

157
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,361
That's bad.

158
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,701
- Hey, come with me.
- But where?

159
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,506
Hold this.

160
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,306
Many years ago,

161
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,551
I don't even remember when,

162
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,824
my parents were on their way
to your Pune city.

163
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,727
They had taken the night service bus.

164
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,259
The driver dozed off.

165
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,331
Holy shit! The bus toppled
and got swept in the river.

166
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,206
It broke the bridge and boom!
Straight down 100 feet!

167
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,103
My parents died on the spot.

168
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,804
My granny told me
it was in the newspaper too.

169
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,573
They died without a scratch on them.

170
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,260
Hey, I think we got something.

171
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,671
That's a snake, damn it!

172
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,235
Bandya, throw it away! Throw it!

173
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,108
Let me honor you for your scholarship!

174
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,455
- Here's a snake garland, Mr. Scholar!
- Shut up!

175
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,675
Come!

176
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,743
It's a dead snake, you loser!

177
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,758
- Did you guys find the dog?
- No.

178
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,471
What was the dog's name again? Mowgli?

179
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,312
Hey, dimwit, ever seen a dog climb a tree?

180
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,516
It's not holding on to a coconut up there!

181
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,324
Go find her,

182
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,691
or I'll shove gasoline
up your ass instead!

183
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,543
Hey, scholarship!

184
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,397
Mowgli.

185
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,852
- Guys, look who's here.
- Who is it?

186
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,849
Hey!

187
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,679
That's it, relax!

188
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,687
Enough!

189
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,319
Back to your seats, now!

190
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,531
Hey, what are you doing, Bandya?

191
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,899
- Brand new watch?
- Yeah, why?

192
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,974
- Can I wear it?
- No.

193
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,533
Anything but the watch. It's my favorite!

194
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,477
Just for ten minutes!
No way, Bandya.

195
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,072
Okay, five minutes? 4 said no!

196
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,482
That's not fair, Yuvraj!

197
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,488
Come here. Who's that newbie in my seat?

198
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,850
Will you give me your watch?
'Just tell me who it is.

199
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,021
That's Chinu, aka Chinmay Kale.

200
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,999
Scholarship and all that. Almost Einstein!

201
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,036
Chinu, this is Yuvraj.
Yuvraj as in prince!

202
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,933
What you waiting for?

203
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,904
Do a belly dance for the prince!

204
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,903
Chinu, this bench is mine!

205
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,745
And here, I don't want
your scholarly bullshit! Clear?

206
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,487
Good for you. Now move aside.

207
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,955
Hey, cuckoo, what you looking at?
Look ahead!

208
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:10,864
SUBJECT: MATHEMATICS
1 RECTANGLE...

209
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,623
<i>The story of Chandrakanta.</i>

210
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,899
<i>Is old indeed.</i>

211
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,163
Bandya, listen up.

212
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,807
Let's see how good your vocabulary is!

213
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,799
Go on.

214
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,908
What does “jerking off“ mean?

215
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,072
Jerk off?

216
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,575
Wow! It sounds better than “asshole“!

217
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,489
- Ask egghead if he knows.
- Hey, egg head.

218
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,549
You're smart, aren't you?
Should I quiz you?

219
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,622
What's the meaning of “jerking off“?

220
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,795
I think I know but I'm not sure.

221
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,499
Stand up, rig ht now!

222
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,507
Tell me the solution to this problem.

223
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,536
So?

224
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,707
Prince Yuvraj?

225
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,583
Are these numbers familiar to you, sir?

226
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,555
Or do you see insects crawling
on the board?

227
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,222
So, you're determined to fail
in math again this year!

228
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,769
It's your army of buffoons
who'll also fail with you!

229
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,768
Because of you,
they're all going to fail in math!

230
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:04,041
Be a little considerate for them at least!

231
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,951
You're famous
as the undisputed king of failures!

232
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,487
Especially in math!

233
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,090
Math is so important in our lives.

234
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,127
Enough!

235
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,629
Don't pretend
like you're solving the problem.

236
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,790
Everyone knows your theatrics!

237
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,926
However much you try,

238
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,732
whatever you do,
you can't possibly solve this.

239
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,238
18.2 centimeters.

240
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,083
Correct answer.

241
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,682
I've been studying
during the summer holidays.

242
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,618
This time I am going
to top the math exam, sir!

243
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,287
Yeah, right! Sit down now!

244
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,859
What are you all looking at?

245
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:07,600
Dad got me this fancy pen from Dubai.
Now it's yours.

246
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,179
- Your dad lives in Dubai?
- No.

247
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,909
But he imports stuff from there.
By the sea route.

248
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,842
All these are from Dubai.

249
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:20,754
This compass box, watch, goggles.
There's more at home.

250
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,763
It's awesome, isn't it?

251
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,133
- Are those gears?
- Wow!

252
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,332
Gear? What does that mean?

253
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,275
Don't you know?
We learnt in science class.

254
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,779
The teeth in wheels are called gears.

255
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,109
Hello, scientist!

256
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,879
The thing that speeds up a bike
is called a gear, you fool!

257
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,882
Get braces for your teeth, idiot!

258
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,819
Stay away! Move, losers!

259
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,295
Hey, what? Get out of here!

260
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,663
Where did you find it?

261
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,735
You don't “find“ stuff like this, idiot.

262
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,729
- My dad bought it from Mumbai.
- Wow! From Mumbai?

263
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,898
Let go!

264
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,334
Hey, Yuvraj, can I take a ride?

265
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,111
Step back! Move!

266
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,747
One small little ride, please.

267
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,976
I won't repeat myself. I said no!

268
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,377
Yuvraj, come on! Don't be so snooty!

269
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,246
Hey, egghead,
only I get to ride this bike.

270
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,950
I can ride faster than the speed of light!

271
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,049
Yeah, right! That's all bull crap!

272
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,722
These fancy bikes get conked easily.
All style, no grit.

273
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,062
- Hey, wanna race?
- Yeah, I'm in!

274
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,864
Let's race! Let's race!

275
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,133
So both of you race
from that post to this post, okay?

276
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,972
Yeah, right!
Playing hopscotch here, are we?

277
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,212
The race should be very long.

278
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,138
Like, till the fort. Okay?

279
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,944
Get off the bike!

280
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,415
Are you up for it?

281
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,712
Yeah, I'm in. You, egghead?

282
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,919
Yes. But who'll be referee?
You cheated last time.

283
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,826
Don't you dare call me a cheater, okay?

284
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,891
Ah, there goes our referee!

285
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,435
Hey, scholarship, wait up!

286
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,931
This is a good idea.

287
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,030
Come, we need you here. Oh, come on!

288
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,307
Scholarship will be a good referee.
Neutral entity.

289
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,409
So, no scope for cheating.
Work for you guys?

290
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,684
- Fine with me!
- Yeah, me too.

291
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,110
Good boy! You won't cheat, rig ht?

292
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,747
He said no.

293
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,863
Now, people live so far off.
Everyone is at least an hour away.

294
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,339
Here we' re finding
such short distance unbearable.

295
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:57,776
My sister takes a two-hour train
to work daily! Can you imagine?

296
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,750
Oh, let's not even talk
about traffic in Mumbai!

297
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,507
Why did you get startled?

298
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,532
No reason.

299
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,111
Aunty is calling you downstairs. Come.

300
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,040
I'll be right down.

301
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,758
I wanted to ask you
the meaning of “jerking off.“

302
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:54,098
Aunty will take you to the teacher.
She knows him well.

303
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,329
- I don't want to learn the flute, Ma!
- But why?

304
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,110
Chinmay, I thought you'd enjoy it.

305
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,201
You always liked the flute, didn't you?

306
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,974
Then why are you refusing now?

307
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,813
- What is it now?
- What kind of curry is this?

308
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,845
Jackfruit.

309
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,788
It tastes like horseshit!

310
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,193
- It's a special dish of this region.
- I don't want any special dish.

311
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:25,228
Why can't you make those dishes
from Pune? What's this jackfruit shit?

312
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:29,271
Oh, really! What about the jackfruit
Dad used to get from here?

313
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,340
You used to eat it happily back then!

314
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,411
Mom.

315
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,529
Yuvraj's father got him a bike
from Mumbai. With gears!

316
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:02,402
His dad gets him
all expensive stuff from Dubai.

317
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,901
Bags, compass box, pen.

318
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,560
Finish everything that's on your plate.

319
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,374
Now hurry up!
I have to go to aunty's place later.

320
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,952
Total ly.

321
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,525
Give me her address.

322
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,920
I'll write her a letter.

323
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,054
She must be lonely out there.

324
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,925
Everything is fine here.

325
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,402
Chinu... is doing good.

326
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,235
He's missing Sagar.
He'll be fine by and by.

327
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,281
When I call again on Friday,
I'll bring him along.

328
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,346
Okay, I have to go now.

329
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,244
I'm using aunty's phone to call you.

330
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,919
Pay my regards to all.

331
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,290
- Oh, that wasn't necessary.
- Oh, come on.

332
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,398
It's not much at all.

333
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,395
- Thanks for the phone!
- Don't be so formal.

334
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,499
You've been a great support!

335
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,341
What support do I offer?
I myself need support.

336
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,112
You're being modest.
It's not easy to live by yourself here.

337
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,553
Forget about me. I feel so proud of you!

338
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,625
Relocating to a new place
all by yourself is not easy.

339
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,392
I thought a new place would help...

340
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,601
more for Chinmay than for me.

341
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,235
He is at an impressionable age.

342
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,599
I worry for him.

343
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,270
Don't worry about him.
He's wise beyond his age!

344
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,340
That's true!

345
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,986
Never thought of remarrying?

346
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,960
Being alone is tough.

347
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,591
You've got to make some hard decisions!

348
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:16,629
After a certain age,
nothing remains in our control.

349
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,624
BASTARD

350
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,138
Take it already!

351
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,374
ASSHOLE

352
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,276
SON OF A BITCH

353
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,337
<i>Soldiers, always march ahead.</i>

354
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:36,579
Don't ever tum back.

355
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,486
<i>Always before you, Hes the correct path.</i>

356
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:45,254
<i>Light falls on the dark path.</i>

357
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,262
No, no, no!

358
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,260
She's not hitting the rig ht notes today.

359
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,299
Why don't you play percussion?

360
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,811
Could you shush the dog!
What's wrong with it?

361
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,282
Mom, move! Make way!

362
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,348
What happened, Chinmay?

363
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,620
- What's up?
- Aunty, do you have a dog?

364
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,297
Mom, this is Bandya. He's my classmate.

365
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,874
Oh! Come on in.

366
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,177
Mom, didn't you have some urgent work?

367
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,241
Oh, of course! I had some urgent work.

368
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,289
- Is there a dog around somewhere?
- Why the hell are you here?

369
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,916
- We have to go someplace. Come.
- But where?

370
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,421
Oh, just come!

371
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,760
Mom, I'll be back in a bit.

372
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,501
Did you see a small dog? Really scrawny.

373
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,536
Do you imagine dogs everywhere?

374
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,581
Have you found any?

375
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,391
Bandya, look I found a crab!

376
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,019
That makes 12 crabs.

377
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,806
- Hold this!
- No, I can't.

378
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:22,708
This is a smaller one.
It won't do anything.

379
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:45,691
But, sir, he's falsely mortgaged
the land for the loan.

380
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,463
So we can't approve this land deal
without a bank NOC.

381
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:55,596
Mrs. Kale, Konkan has seen
a lot of development lately.

382
00:39:56,093 --> 00:40:01,805
Notjust roads but industries,
which implies more investment.

383
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,041
You'll need to get used to such approvals.
This won't be the only time.

384
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,851
You're rig ht, sir.
But according to procedure...

385
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,787
But our applicant dictates “procedure.“
He is bringing in industries and trade.

386
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,416
Why fuss over little things
when the applicant holds authority?

387
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,589
It's already complicated.
You're complicating it further.

388
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,492
I suggest you sign the approval.
The applicant will manage higher up.

389
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,727
What do you say, Nivte?

390
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,803
The decision is up to you.
Think about it, but don't ovenhink it.

391
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,470
True.
We've dealt with a lot of cases like this.

392
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,450
Come on in.

393
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:57,789
This is the Jaigad Lighthouse.
The British built it in 1832.

394
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,737
Engineered by Mr. John Oswald.

395
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,839
Careful on the stairs.

396
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,549
Ma'am, watch your head!

397
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,648
These are lighthouse optic gears.

398
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,088
These gears rotate,
and in turn move the light.

399
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,216
The light flashes four times in a second.

400
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,054
Based on those flashes,
you can gauge your location.

401
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,223
Every boat has a lighthouse chart
that shows the nearest lighthouse.

402
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:38,799
That helps sailors
to reach their destination.

403
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,273
Great, isn't it?

404
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,810
Why didn't you stay inside?

405
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,775
That man explained everything.

406
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,549
How a lighthouse works,
how far the light goes.

407
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,916
Such a lovely breeze!
It felt nice looking at the horizon.

408
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,588
Sagar should've been here.

409
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,796
When he visits, we should bring him here.

410
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,000
Mom, why is the lighthouse closed
to visitors at night?

411
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,304
The light would look
so beautiful at night.

412
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,244
You seem a little preoccupied.

413
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,716
Of course not.

414
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,585
Look, it's so lovely up here.

415
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,026
You're missing Dad, aren't you?

416
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,098
Me too!

417
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,204
I'm sure he would've liked it up here.

418
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,613
Your uncle called me at work today.

419
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,279
- How's he doing?
- He's good!

420
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,051
What was that you wrote
in the letter to Sagar?

421
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,923
Sagar mentioned it to Uncle.
And he brought it to my attention.

422
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,188
What?

423
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,796
That you and your friends
are planning a trip.

424
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:48,800
Yeah, trip!

425
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,540
Are we adults allowed on that trip?
Or is it just you friends?

426
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,902
Of course, you can come!
But we'll decide the destination.

427
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,736
Your bike is awesome!

428
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,333
Who'll be the referee now?

429
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,182
One half ticket. On that side.

430
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,027
We'll see you on the other side.

431
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,801
Yuvraj! All the best!

432
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,275
You're so late, Chinu!

433
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:14,809
Where's the referee?

434
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,146
He's at the finish point,
on the other side.

435
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,088
So, egghead, should we begin the race?

436
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,952
You bet! Let's do it!

437
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,862
Are you flooding the ocean?

438
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,407
Let's go! Enough already!

439
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,873
Wait up, guys!

440
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,635
Loser egghead!

441
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:27,170
Because of you,
our “Prince of Gears“ loses the race!

442
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,104
The irony of it!
And scholarship from Pune wins it!

443
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:36,115
If this stupid egghead hadn't blocked me,
I'd have won!

444
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,208
But I was very close!

445
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,289
Oh, really? You were tailing all of us!

446
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:48,556
Our own roads, our place.
But an outsider wins the race!

447
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,325
Let go. Don't whine now!

448
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,196
Back then,
the king's noble coun was here.

449
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,292
This room's acoustics are such

450
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:59,465
that if I whisper here,
you can hear it all the way over there.

451
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,342
- Hey, don't make up stories!
- Really!

452
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,347
The sound travels across the wall!

453
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,576
Through this thick wall.

454
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,180
Umesh, just whisper something.

455
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,717
Hey, Suhas, what up?

456
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,257
Can you hear me?

457
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,561
- Did you whisper?
- Yes.

458
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,128
Bummer!

459
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,238
Can't hear a thing, idiot!

460
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,577
Talking of sounds coming from the walls!

461
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,545
Don't act smart with me!
Let me show you how it works.

462
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,115
Yeah, sure!

463
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,183
Umesh, put your ears close!

464
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,584
I was listening well. You go on.

465
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,288
Anyone in there?

466
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,724
Oh, my egghead! It's me, Swarali.

467
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,495
How are you, my love?

468
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,261
You bastard!

469
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,443
Dear Swarali, your boyfriend is a nut!

470
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,046
Umesh, run!

471
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:18,312
Dear Swarali, save us from your boyfriend!

472
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,347
<i>Egghead'. Egghead'. Hum
p“; Dum p“; Egghead'.!</i>

473
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,323
Come on, egghead. Let's race.

474
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,642
Let's race.

475
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,105
Come on! Beat me!

476
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,092
Come, wake up. Have some warm milk.

477
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:36,460
That's it? Have some more.

478
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,627
What's wrong, Chinmay?

479
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,031
Tell me.

480
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,636
You take a nap.
I'll wake you up when dinner's ready.

481
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,727
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

482
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:42,120
A rectangular garden measures
70 meters in length...

483
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,125
and the width is 30 meters.

484
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,692
The four sides of the garden
are surrounded by...

485
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,238
Hello, Suhas!

486
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,109
You know who you remind me of?

487
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,876
The cops shown in movies.
They're always late!

488
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,577
But it's not your fault at all!

489
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:16,856
You're right on time.

490
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,789
It's all that bell man's fault!

491
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,025
How dare he ring the school bell
before you arrive?

492
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,360
Anyway»

493
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:30,365
go to the headmaster's office right away
and complain about the bell man!

494
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,832
Ask him not to ring the school bell
until you arrive.

495
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,834
Go on!

496
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,780
Go to your seat!

497
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,113
Enough with the giggling!

498
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,216
So, where were we?

499
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,386
Ma. Am!

500
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,322
The gentleman has sent this for you.

501
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,889
Thank you!

502
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,970
- Chinmay, hear us out!
- I don't want to talk to you guys!

503
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,843
We searched for you a lot.

504
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,075
Searched the whole fon.
We couldn't find you!

505
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,913
And it was pouring!

506
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,252
We were all scared shitless.

507
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,320
- Listen up!
- I don't want to listen!

508
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,849
- I don't want to hear anything!
- Hey, Chinu.

509
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,260
Come on! Bandya's apologizing. Let it go.

510
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,729
Let me explain!

511
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,932
Enough with your arrogance! Get lost!

512
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,468
Let'; Go!

513
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,277
Come on! What are you gaping at?

514
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,161
You can tell your side
of the story at length.

515
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:17,923
He'll find some way out.

516
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,125
Don't worry so much!

517
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,236
You're not at fault. It's just bad luck!

518
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,441
We've done this before.
But we've never received summons!

519
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,443
And never in Mr. Salvi's case.
This is the first time.

520
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,213
The higher authorities are onto something.

521
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,919
They've falsely charged you
with misconduct.

522
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:46,120
And it's not easy to mess with Mr. Salvi.

523
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,592
To protect vested interests,
the innocent are always blamed!

524
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,163
They know you're new here.

525
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,566
I'll come with you to Ratnagiri.

526
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,942
I'll explain it to Chief
that you're innocent.

527
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,141
No. It's okay! I'll go there myself.

528
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,118
You must be hungry. I'm awfully late!

529
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,217
I'll quickly change
and cook something for you.

530
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,616
It always pours when I forget my umbrella!

531
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,034
I'll be going to Ratnagiri tomorrow.

532
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,131
You wait for me at aunty's place, okay?

533
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,210
Why?

534
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,249
What do you mean, “Why“? Work as usual!

535
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,053
I don't want to stay here!
I want to go back to Pune!

536
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,496
Nobody gives a shit about me here!
Not even you!

537
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,626
You don't care about what I go through!

538
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,602
Just because everything's going great
for you!

539
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,185
DISTRICT REVENUE OFFICE

540
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,463
He will see you now.

541
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,617
You've been with the department
for ten years?

542
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,386
You know very well how this system works!

543
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,188
I understand
you might have been pressured.

544
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,490
Just give that in writing.

545
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,160
Everybody will be duly interrogated.

546
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,496
Including you.

547
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:48,098
What will you do then?
It's your signature on it.

548
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,699
Not anyone else's.

549
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,539
You see, even I am under lot of pressure.

550
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,411
Confess your mistake.

551
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,117
No point passing the blame.

552
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,714
It's my honest suggestion to you.

553
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:00,329
Go get me a refill from that shop.

554
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,353
- You cook really well!
- Some more sauce.

555
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,521
No, I'm through.

556
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,799
No, I'm fine. Give it to her.

557
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,333
Eat well, child.

558
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,197
Do you go to school?

559
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,400
What's it called?

560
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,738
Shridev Gopalkrishna
Primary Girls' School!

561
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,834
That long!

562
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,914
- It's right across.
- Very good!

563
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,208
So, do you like it here in Konkan?

564
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,880
Bike rides must be fun here.

565
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,548
Did you go see the Mahadev temple yet?

566
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:52,653
Let him eat!

567
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:56,360
What happened, child?
You haven't eaten much.

568
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,592
- Didn't you like the food?
- No.

569
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,566
And it smells awful!

570
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,634
I'll quickly cook something else?

571
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,301
What do you like? Some stew, maybe?

572
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,470
No please, don't cook anything.

573
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,612
- He's in a grumpy mood today.
- It really won't take that long.

574
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,584
The thing is,
he's been missing his cousin a lot.

575
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:24,420
He's quite attached to his cousin, Sagar.

576
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:28,359
So he's just a little low today.
He always finishes what's on his plate.

577
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,396
Don't worry.

578
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:34,361
- What do you say?
- No, really. Please don't cook.

579
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,527
He'll finish his meal!

580
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,697
Finish it. Be seated.

581
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,532
He told me about what happened at work.

582
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,842
I don't understand these things,

583
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,507
but he told me.

584
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,013
Don't stress so much.

585
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:33,916
Everything will be fine!

586
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,551
Really!

587
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,966
I never thought it'd go this far.

588
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,031
If I'd known...

589
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,698
You don't need to feel bad about it,
Nivte.

590
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,506
It was my own decision
to sign the document.

591
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,347
Mom, can we go now?

592
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,041
I'm hungry-

593
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,982
Mom, I said I'm hungry!

594
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,681
You won't get any food!

595
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,025
Don't you have any sense?

596
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,861
Is that how you behave in someone
else's house? Are you still a child?

597
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,567
You've become so arrogant!
You need to be spanked.

598
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,731
It's the only way you'll learn.
You won't get any food. Stay hungry!

599
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,537
But I told you, I didn't want to go there.

600
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,670
I just don't want to live here.
Don't you get it?

601
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:40,803
Don't raise your voice!

602
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,113
Instead of apologizing,
you're talking back to me?

603
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,243
Don't stay here then!

604
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,715
Go live with your uncle.
I'm fine here alone!

605
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,755
Egghead!
You'll never get a direct hit like Yuvraj!

606
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:33,823
You missed it again, loser!

607
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,564
Dig a hole and bury yourself over there!

608
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:33,825
Want a ride?

609
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,155
Feel like diving in?

610
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,379
How deep is it here?

611
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,248
Very deep!

612
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,224
When do we return?

613
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,527
As soon as we catch some fish.

614
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,840
How far did we go?

615
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,604
Very far!

616
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,513
What if our boat had capsized
and we'd died?

617
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,620
Who is at your home?

618
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:32,863
Mom.

619
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,367
Then nothing would harm you.

620
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,539
Who is at your home?

621
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,514
Here.

622
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,020
We don't eat fish.

623
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,522
Try m.

624
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,604
Where were you all day?

625
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:26,178
Couldn't you have told me?
It's so late in the night!

626
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,497
Get yourself cleaned up.

627
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:03,246
Aunty! We looked for Chinu everywhere!

628
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:06,410
Over the bridge, near the road.
The temple too.

629
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:10,513
- We couldn't find him.
- Chinmay just returned home.

630
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,250
Why don't you also come in?

631
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:17,157
No, I'm fine.
My uncle must be waiting for me.

632
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:20,564
He'll beat me. I'll go before it's late.

633
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,295
Umesh, what's going on there?

634
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,177
Show me the answer.

635
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,319
Show me the answer!

636
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,351
Asshole!

637
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,389
Should I read it to you?

638
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,695
“The sea bore an array of perils.

639
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:43,571
Amighty storm ambushed the lone sailor.

640
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:47,640
The sail snapped, the nails unhooked.

641
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:51,649
The sailor persisted,
unfazed by what lay ahead.

642
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,413
Luckless,
the knots of skill turned loose.

643
01:26:56,511 --> 01:27:02,257
He stood there alone.
The storm slapped its noose.

644
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:06,560
A life lived in benevolence
will not let faith wither.

645
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:10,602
He overcame fear
and the storm lulled into slither.

646
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:14,668
Courage of the universe regathers
in a single moment.

647
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:18,676
A hundred arms' strength regains,
as the memory of mother returns.“

648
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,206
It's quite moving!

649
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:25,846
Deep, isn't it?

650
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,620
- You got your math exam tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

651
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,716
I am already prepared for it.

652
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,896
And the exams here aren't
as tough as in Pune.

653
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:48,668
What's wrong, Ma?

654
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:50,873
Nothing.

655
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,536
What happened with your work at Ratnagiri?

656
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,252
Why don't we invite all
your friends for dinner?

657
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,584
- Why?
- What do you mean, “Why“?

658
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:07,489
I want to meet your friends.
I haven't met any of them.

659
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,932
Oh, come on.
I am not going to lecture them.

660
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,762
I just want to meet them. That's all!

661
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,330
Oh, come on! Say something.

662
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:43,555
Let's leave.

663
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,491
- Yuvraj, show it to me as well!
- Get lost!

664
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,600
<i>- I'll</i> complain to the teacher!
- Shut up!

665
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:31,802
I'll tell on you.

666
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,913
Can I borrowa pen? Pen, please!

667
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,396
This is not fair, Yuvraj.

668
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,064
I stood up to leave,
and you continued writing.

669
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,141
Suddenly I remembered
the answer to the problem.

670
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:05,370
If Chinu were on my side,
I'd have “suddenly remembered“ too.

671
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:11,142
Go ask him.

672
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,083
Why? You go ask him!

673
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:19,717
Bandya, I'll let you ride my bike.
Go ask him!

674
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,473
Exams got over, eh?

675
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,623
We're going to the beach.

676
01:30:57,985 --> 01:30:59,487
You want to come along?

677
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:05,997
Yes!

678
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,435
He agreed! Let's go.

679
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:17,776
This guy is tall like you.

680
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,747
Dinner is ready, guys!

681
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:30,191
You know what, Yuvraj?

682
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:34,163
For the Ganesh festival,
we should do the Ali Baba cave.

683
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:39,866
Ask your dad to get sacks of gold
from Dubai and throw them in.

684
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:44,171
Hey!
Not a word about my dad or Dubai! Okay?

685
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,774
- You boys liking it?
- Yeah!

686
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:54,114
Water's right here.

687
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,779
Is this silence because of me?

688
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:02,593
Mom, you know these two, rig ht?
Bandya and Yuvraj?

689
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,856
That's Prakash and that's Umesh.

690
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,065
- There's Om kar, who's not here.
- Egghead.

691
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:09,225
Egghead?

692
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:11,158
He didn't come?

693
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:15,671
- He's on a date with that girl.
- What?

694
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:17,805
The food is delicious!

695
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,711
Liked it?

696
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:25,648
So,

697
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:27,677
how was the math exam?

698
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:34,988
Yuvraj will tell us.

699
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,159
He's damn good at math!

700
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,095
As expected he did well today.

701
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:42,190
Like a pro,
he answered all questions in an hour!

702
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:45,931
And none of us could get even
half the answers right.

703
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,267
He got them all!

704
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,906
- Really?
- Isn't it, Yuvraj?

705
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,078
And Chinu helped him too!

706
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:58,817
- With the preparation.
- Oh, really! That's great.

707
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:08,727
Can Chinu spend ten days
for Ganesh festival at my place?

708
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:11,229
He'll have a great time.

709
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,328
Okay-Why not!

710
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:19,629
Bravo, Chinu!

711
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:23,108
I have an idea
for the festival decoration.

712
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:24,904
Huddle.

713
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,036
A lighthouse is really tall,

714
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:29,143
looks very pretty.

715
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,906
It has a huge lamp on its head.

716
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,583
And the lamp burns all night.

717
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,682
Sometimes you can even
see ships sailing away.

718
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:41,655
A lovely cool breeze up there.

719
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,828
The stars
in the sky look beautiful as well.

720
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:50,894
And the vast ocean,
it really does something to you.

721
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,038
There's a long flight of stairs
to get to the top.

722
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,165
It's tiring to climb all the way!

723
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:59,938
But there are windows
where you can rest in between.

724
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:02,075
There's a nice breeze there as well.

725
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:24,825
Mom!

726
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,332
<i>Wow'!</i>

727
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,241
- You made this?
- Yes.

728
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,044
Bandya taught me how to make it.

729
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,215
It's very beautiful!

730
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:43,315
I've been transferred again.

731
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:46,146
To Satara.

732
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:50,021
Why?

733
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:57,893
That's how it is.

734
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,338
When do we have to leave?

735
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:08,076
They've asked me to report
to work next Monday.

736
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,017
Okay. Not a problem!

737
01:35:25,152 --> 01:35:26,859
Can't this transfer be called off?

738
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:08,937
Come on, Bandya, your turn.

739
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:12,000
Jump in the center.

740
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:18,208
Awesome!

741
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:20,376
Chinu, you're next.

742
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,853
Come on, jump!

743
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:29,026
What, you don't have a scholarship
for this? Jump!

744
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:32,063
Don't be scared. Jump! It's easy.

745
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,793
Come on, Chinu, jump!

746
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:13,563
Before I leave,
I want to visit the fort with you guys.

747
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:43,923
I'll send a boy in the evening.

748
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:46,624
He'll help you load your stuff
on the truck.

749
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:49,897
Thanks! I'll see you in the evening.

750
01:38:57,531 --> 01:39:02,207
Come visit me in the evening
with your mom. Okay?

751
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:13,414
All the books in one trunk.

752
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:22,024
I've packed your books
and kept them upstairs.

753
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,932
- Will you load them in the trunk?
- Okay.

754
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:17,319
Why don't you give this flute
to one of your friends?

755
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:26,329
Why should I give it away?

756
01:40:27,788 --> 01:40:29,734
I'll learn how to play this in Satara.

757
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:32,626
Fine.

758
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:08,532
- Chinm ay.
- Yeah, Mom, coming.

759
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:11,132
Help me put this down.

760
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:17,814
Easy. It has fragile stuff inside.

761
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:19,709
Hold it from the bottom.
