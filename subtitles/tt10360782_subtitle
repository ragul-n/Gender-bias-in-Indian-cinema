1
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:11,391
Greetings, sir!

2
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,432
I'm Sabari, MLA.

3
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:14,681
Hope you'd have heard about me.

4
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:20,098
If you sign for the approval of
five hundred acres of land in Tambaram,

5
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:23,266
I'll give the keys of the bungalow
in ECR, immediately.

6
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,432
What do you say?

7
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:33,516
Have you seen the beggars
at Kapaleeswarar temple?

8
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:34,474
I've seen.

9
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:35,681
So what?

10
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:40,556
l'll bring them to your house.
Will you allow them in the bedroom?

11
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,973
Hey, stop.

12
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:43,848
Sir, are you teasing?

13
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,223
It's not possible, right?

14
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:50,307
Likewise, no one can takeover
the Government land.

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,141
If I see your file on my table,
you'll end up in the prison.

16
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:03,098
Good, sir.

17
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,516
Shall I leave?

18
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:13,141
Anantharaman, an honest Tahsildar
well known to everyone...

19
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:19,182
We'll have a look at
the honest path he travelled...

20
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,432
We were colleagues.

21
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:51,474
If anyone feels hungry,
he'll give them whatever he has.

22
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:57,848
An incident happened in his life
like that of Swami Vivekananda.

23
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:02,057
A North Indian girl, impressed
on his kindness and honesty...

24
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,766
...wanted a child
to be born to him.

25
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,391
Do you know what he replied?

26
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,141
Okay.

27
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,266
'Consider me as your child'.

28
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,307
And we'll continue to see
about many interesting people.

29
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,098
All those who got caught
are saying it.

30
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,556
Stop.
Take the papers.

31
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,681
Sir, please.
-No, you can move.

32
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:57,474
Thank you, sir.
-Come, let's go.

33
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:58,348
Constable,
-Sir.

34
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,307
Send here.
-Go and meet him.

35
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,474
Hey, the police!
-Go, stop aside.

36
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,182
Get down.

37
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,223
Does wearing a helmet
will make your tress frizzy?

38
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:08,556
Come here.

39
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:12,931
Do you've the RC book, licence
and insurance?

40
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,640
Sir, that is...

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,307
I'll get you,
if you don't have.

42
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,766
But, you must do me a favour.

43
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:23,098
I love your friend, Divya.
-That's it.

44
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:24,723
You've to recommend me.

45
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,516
I'll recommend you
to get on any signal.

46
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:32,098
What is she special about,
why everyone is chasing her?

47
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,016
Is she so beautiful?

48
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:36,516
Oh, no! Wow!

49
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,556
She is awesome!

50
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:05,057
Divya, do you know?

51
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,973
A traffic cop has fallen
in love with you.

52
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,681
If you accept, we don't have
to bother about licence and helmet.

53
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:14,598
No, that doesn't work.

54
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:17,766
I'm waiting for someone
to propose me.

55
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:22,307
But, you deny everyone.
What's your problem?

56
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,057
I'll tell you.

57
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,931
My aunt fell in love with a man.

58
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,766
Who?
Subbulakshmi aunty?

59
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,141
How will he look like?

60
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,141
Looking great!

61
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:43,141
He is a big hooligan.

62
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:46,681
His name?

63
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,806
The warrior

64
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,432
Wonder, did she love him?

65
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,848
He too loved her.

66
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:58,391
His well-wishers came to
my aunt's house to fix the marriage.

67
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,723
Then...

68
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:00,931
When can we fix the marriage?

69
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,057
After my death.

70
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:20,016
Disheartened, she feels everyday
on missing him.

71
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:23,348
Okay, what's the relation
between you and this story?

72
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,098
Are you searching someone like that?

73
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,640
He must be a bully,
but belong to my community.

74
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,931
Only then, my dad will accept.

75
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,848
The traffic cop belongs
to your community.

76
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,516
Shall we check with the help
of local thugs, whether he is a bully?

77
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:39,723
Yeah, okay.

78
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,266
Okay, come.

79
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,348
Hey, look there.
They're!

80
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,556
Hey! they're very old.

81
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,766
They were the old boxers.

82
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,516
Boxers!
Is it?

83
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,182
Divya, don't estimate by their looks.

84
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,640
Wait and see.

85
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:22,057
Brother, do you remember
the plans I said on the phone?

86
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:23,141
Done.

87
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,891
We'll stand aside.
Signal us when he arrives.

88
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:27,556
Okay.

89
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,098
How will this plan work out?

90
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,141
They're all too old.

91
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,891
It'll work out.

92
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,598
The traffic cop I told you about
has arrived.

93
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,348
Is he!

94
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:50,640
Hi!

95
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,016
To you...

96
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,016
You said, you need to talk
about something, right?

97
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,016
That is...

98
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:00,681
Tell me.

99
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,057
A for Apple...

100
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:06,266
B for Big apple...

101
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,806
C for Curt apple...

102
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:09,723
D for Damaged apple...

103
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,891
Her bag is good.

104
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,766
She dyed her hair.

105
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,307
Do you know, what A stands for?

106
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,348
What's this?

107
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:18,348
A knife!

108
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,348
What are you looking at?

109
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,016
Save me.

110
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,182
Leave.

111
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,141
I'll not leave.
What can you do?

112
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:29,223
I asked you to leave me.

113
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,640
Hey!

114
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,848
Oh, gosh!

115
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,057
He ran away.

116
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,223
Hey, hold my hand.

117
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:04,891
Hold her.

118
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,098
Hey, leave me.

119
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:09,681
Leave me.

120
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:13,766
Leave me.

121
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,474
Who is that child?

122
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:16,640
Is he your boy friend?

123
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,806
Save me.

124
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,141
Save me.

125
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,432
You're rocking!

126
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,348
Hey, stop.

127
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,931
Dare to tease a girl of
your grand daughter's age?

128
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,640
Wait...

129
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,516
Wait...

130
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,348
Encircle him.

131
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,598
My attire!

132
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,391
Comedian!

133
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,474
Hey, run away to home.

134
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,723
Only who has teeth must
eat snacks.

135
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:17,391
Hey knock out, finish him
with a single punch.

136
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,057
Hey!

137
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:57,266
Yeah!

138
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,307
Wow!

139
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,891
He seems to be a ruffian.
Come, let's run away.

140
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:25,891
Don't push me.

141
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,640
I'll be back in a minute.

142
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:34,474
Who are these old superheroes?

143
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,182
Let it be, who are you?

144
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:39,016
Where have you been for so long?

145
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,723
If you go straight and take left,
a small temple is seen.

146
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,516
If you go in that lane...

147
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,556
Do you love someone?

148
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:50,973
Yes!

149
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,766
What I expected has happened.

150
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,598
I vow the lord.

151
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,640
Listen, I'm the perfect match for you.

152
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,806
I'm good in cooking.

153
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:07,681
I'll take care of you to the
extent that everyone feels jealous.

154
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,348
My monthly salary is
one lakh rupees.

155
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,057
So, you don't have to
go to work.

156
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,806
I'll not torture you
to buy this and that.

157
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay?

158
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,266
Why are you saying
all these to me?

159
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,556
Because...

160
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,307
Because...

161
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,432
'I love you'

162
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,223
I had a doubt when looking at you.

163
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:34,723
Now, it's confirmed.

164
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,931
You've a problem, right?

165
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,182
Look, understand me.

166
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,806
I truly love you.

167
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:45,766
Years of love
are disappearing, nowadays.

168
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,516
If you say, you fell in love
in ten seconds...

169
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,266
...even a child wouldn't believe.

170
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:52,223
You don't understand
what I am saying.

171
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,516
Shall I do one thing,
as you believe?

172
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,057
What's your name?

173
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,640
Saravanan.
-Saravanan!

174
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,891
Saravanan Divya!

175
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,766
Lord!

176
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:44,057
He is yet to get the holy water.

177
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,766
It's a right saying, 'Many a slip
between the cup and the lip'.

178
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,723
Banu, where is your son?

179
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,598
Getting dizziness because of hunger.

180
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,806
Shouldn't he get the holy water
amidst the mob?

181
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:02,640
You're adamant to end the
fasting only after taking the holy water.

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,891
Where is your son?

183
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,307
Who knows about the queue
in the temple and where he stands?

184
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:09,973
The Jasmine, in the evening...

185
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,723
The dance, in the morning...

186
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:17,307
The Jasmine, in the evening...

187
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,891
The dance, in the morning...

188
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:28,098
I'm stuck In the smell of the saree
and fascination of love

189
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:34,723
I'm planning in the light of nosepin
and in the collection of rhythm

190
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:41,141
The fire of lust has caught me...

191
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,016
In the evening...

192
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:48,182
The suprarenal nerve was struck...

193
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:51,016
The Jasmine...

194
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,182
What, dear?
-Banu.

195
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:55,598
What's the time now?

196
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,598
It's 3 o'clock.

197
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,098
Don't lie.

198
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,307
It's 4 o'clock.

199
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,931
I won't be afraid.
Tell me the truth.

200
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:10,016
It's 5 o'clock.

201
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,266
Where is your son?

202
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:18,223
The Jasmine, in the evening...
In the morning...

203
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:34,141
You're a tasty side dish
for rice pudding

204
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:41,891
The flare catched and
it's you blazed, is the art of magic

205
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,307
In the evening...

206
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:01,766
The suprarenal nerve was struck

207
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,681
The dance...

208
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:11,016
A musical line from the film,
Geetha Govindam

209
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:16,516
Logu, it seems you're napping
after heavy meal.

210
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,016
Oh, no!
-Who's that?

211
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:26,391
It's coffee time in my house,
but still you haven't end your fasting.

212
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:29,848
We'll clean up and leave soon,
if you finish eating.

213
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,348
You too irating...
Go away.

214
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:34,223
He is hungry.

215
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:38,098
Telling him about cleaning
of the vessels.

216
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,973
He must be short tempered.

217
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:41,931
Hey!

218
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,681
Don't get tensed.
-Your blood pressure is high.

219
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:53,723
If the blood pressure increases,
you'll start bleeding.

220
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,556
What are you speaking?

221
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:56,307
Come, dear.

222
00:17:58,474 --> 00:17:59,516
Came at last!

223
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,598
Was it blood?

224
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,516
Saravanan has come.

225
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,891
Uncle!
-Yeah!

226
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:10,474
Did you see your
daughter-in-law kissing?

227
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:15,474
Mom, did you see your
daughter-in-law kissing?

228
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:20,806
Mom, did you see your
daughter-in-law kissing?

229
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,474
Banu!
-What, dear?

230
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:24,848
Get me the holy water.

231
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,307
Where is the holy water?

232
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,891
Save me!

233
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,432
Hey, what are you staring at?

234
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,307
You left in the morning to
get the holy water, isn't it?

235
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:37,806
What are you discussing there?

236
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,806
Is there the holy water?
-It's here.

237
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,848
It's in the bike.
I'll get it.

238
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,141
He is bringing it.

239
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,848
Saravanan.
- Move away.

240
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:55,182
Why are you taking this?

241
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:57,182
Holy water!

242
00:18:58,348 --> 00:18:59,348
Taste it.

243
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:03,516
Lord!

244
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:04,806
Give it.

245
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,640
It's coriander leaves in holy water!

246
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,723
Only basil leaves must be there.

247
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,432
As there was huge crowd
in the temple...

248
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,766
...the basil leaves were scarce,
so they added coriander.

249
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:31,016
He is telling, right?

250
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,474
What did you do?
-Lord!

251
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:39,931
Where shall I go and
reveal this injustice?

252
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,474
Why are you creating fuss
for a simple thing?

253
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,182
Which is simple thing?

254
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,182
It's coriander leaves instead of
holy basil.

255
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,391
Not that, brother.

256
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:50,640
You said my daughter will
get married to your son.

257
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,474
But, see what he has done.

258
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,723
Show them the image.

259
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,474
What did you do?

260
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:56,556
Look at his 'WhatsApp dp'.
-See now.

261
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,307
What's this!

262
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,348
What are you going to
respond to my daughter?

263
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:06,016
Renu, what's this?

264
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,556
Did I behave with you like that?

265
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:09,931
Tell me, dear.

266
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,141
Don't act like a hero.

267
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:20,057
When you dropped me in
the school, didn't you kiss me?

268
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:21,057
Did you forget that?

269
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:21,973
What's this?

270
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,931
She is saying about the things
happened in her fifth grade.

271
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,516
Oh, no!

272
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:26,931
What?

273
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:30,598
Logu, this is my household container.

274
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:33,391
Your son didn't go to the temple.

275
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:37,182
Hey, are you cheating me?

276
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,391
Leave him.

277
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:39,848
Don't hit him.

278
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,223
I won't hit him, leave me.

279
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:45,223
So, your son didn't visit the temple
instead roaming behind a girl.

280
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,806
What, dear?
-Mom, I'm not behind her.

281
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,973
She fell in love with me.

282
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,640
I got fixed, it's the final.
-Wait.

283
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,266
Just wait.

284
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,891
Look here, falling in love
doesn't convince our family.

285
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,806
Doesn't it convince our family
or the property?

286
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:01,891
Either he or I must stay
in this house.

287
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:03,598
I'll stay here,
ask him to go out.

288
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:04,391
Hey!

289
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:04,973
Move away.

290
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,266
What are you talking?

291
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,848
Is that girl more important
to you than us?

292
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:13,640
You don't know the importance
of me who struggled...

293
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,141
...for your prosperous life, right?

294
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,348
Yeah, don't know.
-Hey!

295
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,516
He is turning back, mom.

296
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:25,973
I prayed every deity for your birth,
you can't know my importance, right?

297
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:27,182
Yeah, don't know.
-Hey!

298
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,223
Aunt is hiding his face.

299
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:29,931
Are you teasing me?
Get out of the house.

300
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:30,806
What, dear?

301
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:31,891
I'm leaving.

302
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,806
But, you shouldn't come
to visit your grandchildren.

303
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,681
Saravanan!

304
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:40,766
Saravanan!

305
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,098
He is leaving.
-Uncle, he is leaving.

306
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:44,432
Are you happy now?

307
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,651
Sir, I'm going out, urgently.

308
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,107
I must be there in five minutes.

309
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:53,274
Shall I call you later?

310
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:54,189
Okay, sir.

311
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,229
I'll hang up the call.
Okay.

312
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:00,808
Less sugar.
- Give me, brother.

313
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:05,261
Fuel is there.

314
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,052
Sir, what's the problem?
-It's not getting started.

315
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:08,217
Not getting started?

316
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:11,839
The people will spit on us
if the bike doesn't start at our shop.

317
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,211
What person are you?

318
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,080
There is a problem in the engine.

319
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,956
It'll cost six thousand rupees.

320
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:21,203
Six thousand?

321
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,910
I must go, urgently.
It's getting late too.

322
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,408
Hey, are you the shop owner
or myself?

323
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:26,574
You're asking six thousand rupees.

324
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,280
He seems to be a good mechanic.

325
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,943
The expenses along with
his salary and shop rent...

326
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,567
It's 125 CC, isn't it?
-Yes.

327
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:35,440
Old engine.

328
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,479
It's tough to get the spare parts.

329
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,811
But, I'll manage to get it done.

330
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:41,684
It'll cost upto nine thousand rupees.

331
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,557
What! Nine thousand rupees?
-Yes.

332
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:46,595
It's getting late for the meeting.

333
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,094
This is the way to speak.
Do you understand?

334
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:49,509
Want to give balance for tea shop.

335
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,882
We've to give another delivery, today.

336
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:54,629
Leave it. We'll finish his job.
He seems to be good.

337
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:57,043
The bike has started.

338
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,624
I forget to switch on the key.
Is that a fault?

339
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:04,035
Let it be, give me
four thousand rupees.

340
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,033
Hey, there is no problem
in the bike.

341
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,407
But, you're asking for money?

342
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:08,782
Leave it, brother.
Give us, Rs.3500.

343
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:09,365
We'll get it done.

344
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,570
Hey, goof...
My bike started.

345
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,109
Look at his face.

346
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,901
Who is goof?
Hey, stop.

347
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:18,314
Mathi, come here.

348
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,270
He is yelling at you.
-I’ll slap you.

349
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,476
When I'm asking him
for four thousand rupees,

350
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:23,850
Why are you still reducing
the money?

351
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,097
Why is he bringing
his hand in a bag?

352
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,595
Mani, what happened?

353
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:35,963
It's a fault to marry a rural girl,
believing she'll be obedient.

354
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:37,045
Why?
What happened?

355
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:39,250
Are you ready?

356
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,917
It's getting late.
Come soon.

357
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,581
I'm coming.

358
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:45,661
Dear, am I good?

359
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:48,408
Can you ask this being the wife
of a medical shop owner?

360
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:49,616
Come near.

361
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,070
You're good only.

362
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,943
Dear, I'm asking whether
I'm looking good in this attire?

363
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:59,522
It's torn.
-Oh, no! Where it's torn?

364
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,060
Nothing torn.
It's very sunny.

365
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,143
Get me the glasses.
-Okay.

366
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,391
Take this.

367
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:08,054
What's this?

368
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,596
You only asked for the glasses.

369
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,927
Hey, goof!
Why are you irritating me?

370
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,300
I meant the coolers.

371
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,632
Bring it.
Go.

372
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,921
Why are you looking dull?

373
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,878
I'm going to turn right.
Hold your hand.

374
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,208
Okay, dear.

375
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,457
Hey, careful.
-Oh, god!

376
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:28,993
You're wasting our time
narrating useless tales.

377
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:30,075
Go away.

378
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,072
Hereafter, we must ask them
to apply the grease.

379
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,069
Hey, take the spanners 11 and 12.

380
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,858
Only three spanners are here.
Where to get the rest?

381
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,523
Hey, you!

382
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,228
You'll be spared.

383
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,310
The phone is ringing. Attend it.

384
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:48,391
Sister!

385
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,471
Hello!
-Murugan!

386
00:24:50,471 --> 00:24:51,221
Tell me, sister.

387
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,094
Saravanan left the home on enrage.

388
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,093
What happened, sister?

389
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:59,003
He has fallen in love, his dad
was aware of it and created fuss.

390
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,044
So, he left home on enrage.
-Oh, I see!

391
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:04,249
I thought of not hitting him.

392
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,164
But, no other way.

393
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:07,621
Don't worry, sister.

394
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,285
Don't think of...

395
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:10,159
Sister!

396
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:10,908
Hello!

397
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:11,826
Sister!

398
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,448
She had disconnected the call.

399
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:16,363
Hey, stop.
This is the house.

400
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:18,943
The pavilion is in the second floor.

401
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,317
Come.

402
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,897
Brother, will I get the house?

403
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,271
Why did you ask like this?

404
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,934
This house owner is
my long time friend.

405
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,807
It's enough if I nod,
he'll give the key with eyes closed.

406
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:30,930
When he gives the key
with eyes closed and...

407
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,136
...if it falls in drainage,
you've to take it.

408
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,718
There is nothing wrong
sending you out of the house.

409
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,548
See, whether the dog is coming?

410
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:43,502
It's not the dog, instead
a turtle is coming.

411
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,833
Who is that?

412
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:48,289
Sir, I'm Swamy.

413
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,786
Swamy! I'm coming.

414
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,201
It's about love affair.

415
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,073
Problem in his house,
so he was expelled.

416
00:25:56,197 --> 00:25:58,944
He owns a textile shop.

417
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:00,942
So, will pay the rent on time.
No need to worry.

418
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,482
You're the person who
respects love.

419
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,935
Love affair?
Don't worry.

420
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:09,100
I'll give my life for
the sake of love.

421
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,932
No need of that.

422
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,474
I can't move around with a corpse.

423
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:12,390
It's enough if you
lend me the house.

424
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,096
What's this?
-It seems to be wrong, Swamy.

425
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:16,884
No, he says about the money.

426
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:20,049
Tell me, how much is the advance
and the rental?

427
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:24,085
The advance amount is Rs.10,000,
rental amount is Rs.3000...

428
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,625
...and the water charges is Rs.500.

429
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,123
He is charging separately for water.

430
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,748
Will he take care of the side dish?

431
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,161
Swamy, it seems to be wrong.

432
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:32,909
Take the key.

433
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:33,993
Get the advance amount.

434
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,074
Don't be enraged.

435
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:35,906
Is he leaving on anger?

436
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:38,196
Then, won't he get angry?
He is the house owner.

437
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:46,689
Sir, it's a single piece.
Good design.

438
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,479
Sir, you look at this.

439
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,810
Is it good dude?
- Get the bill for sir.

440
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:52,890
Tell me.

441
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,265
Come to Mullai Nagar, immediately.

442
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:55,054
What happened?

443
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,220
Come, I'll tell you.

444
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,634
I'm coming.

445
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:01,465
(Indistinct voices)

446
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:02,631
Is it true?
-Is he?

447
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:05,045
Yes.
-He cheated us.

448
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,210
He came.

449
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,125
Hey, dear! I thought you'd be single.

450
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,000
But, came with a clan.

451
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,581
Hey, dude.

452
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:11,664
You tell him.

453
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:12,870
Any problem?
Tell him.

454
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,618
These people, who celebrated Holi
only on tresses...

455
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:16,033
Holi?

456
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,242
...do they belong to your place?

457
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:19,073
Yes, they're the avengers of our place.

458
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,613
Did you do anything mischief?

459
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,070
She was in search of you.

460
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,568
I'm giving her the details.

461
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,941
What did you say?
-My brother is....

462
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:27,897
He is the ragi malt.

463
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,270
Leave it, brother.
Do you know, what I said?

464
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,642
I praised you to the core.

465
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:35,056
They've said exactly.

466
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:37,513
Women are here, you leave.
Go...

467
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:43,382
Hey, dear! you came to meet
me with love.

468
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:47,419
I know you'll give.
Send her.

469
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:49,999
Send her.

470
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:52,955
What's your name?

471
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:54,621
My name?

472
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:57,201
I told you on that day, isn't it?
Saravanan!

473
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,242
The people around me
call as, 'Saro'.

474
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,072
So, don't you belong
to my community?

475
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:04,361
Your community?
I didn't say like that.

476
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:05,652
On that day, you were having
the tridental mark on the forehead.

477
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:06,484
Oh, that one?

478
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,854
I offered prayers, so had
the tridental mark on that day.

479
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,605
It's gone!

480
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:12,976
Everything has gone!

481
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:15,308
Everything lost as dreams.

482
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:17,223
Oh, lord!

483
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:19,346
Come here.

484
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:23,425
Why it happens to me?
-What happened, dear?

485
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:24,840
What happened?
-You don't know.

486
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:30,501
What happened?
-My dreams were shattered.

487
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,416
Kiss me.

488
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,040
Hey, damn it.

489
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,994
I lend my shoulder to console you.

490
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:40,074
But, you're pushing me away.

491
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:41,532
Okay, listen me.

492
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,903
Something was misunderstood.

493
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:46,943
I'm not in love with you.

494
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,566
Please, forgive me.

495
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,729
Don't tell even for fun.

496
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:56,601
I fought with my parents
and friends and left the house.

497
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,180
I took a house for rent
for us to live.

498
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:01,720
But, you're...

499
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,969
I don't know all those.

500
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:04,342
Forgive me.

501
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,924
It'll never happen.

502
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:09,421
Hey, you dragged and kissed me.

503
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:11,044
What are you thinking about?

504
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,042
Look now...

505
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:14,831
Your originality is seen.

506
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:16,788
This is what meant as
locale attitude.

507
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,118
It's for fun, dear.

508
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:22,906
It's clear that you do acting.

509
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:25,114
What I said is said.

510
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:28,152
You called me and
saying to stay away.

511
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:32,065
You've done everything
and cheating me.

512
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,438
Cheating?

513
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,311
Hello!

514
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:38,058
Hey, tell me.

515
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:39,681
She thought you belong
to her community.

516
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,097
She isn't aware that you're
a locale guy.

517
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:43,511
What, if I'm a locale guy?

518
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:46,217
Only the locale guy will
take care of you in life.

519
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,921
The taste of idly is enhanced
based only on the chutney.

520
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,045
Life is also the same.

521
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,292
Our happiness depends on
who we live with.

522
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,123
She denied you, right?

523
00:29:57,622 --> 00:29:58,372
Better, leave.

524
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:00,952
I understand.

525
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:04,324
You say, the scene was over.

526
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:07,530
Why do you bear
the sin of hurting me?

527
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:13,852
I feel heavy hearted.

528
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,516
It's okay, leave it.

529
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,515
I'll take care.

530
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,554
Finally, I'll tell you one thing.

531
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:22,926
Don't fall in love with someone
who wipes your lipstick.

532
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:26,880
But, love the one who
care your eyeliner not to get wet.

533
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:28,503
Your life will be good.

534
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,709
It's the last touch.

535
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:31,917
Shall I leave?

536
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,915
Let it go.

537
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:41,657
What happened to him?

538
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,989
Why are you looking dull?

539
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,278
What happened to you?

540
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,731
The hunter who lost his both hands
shot the deer without four legs.

541
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,435
The arrow didn't fall on the deer
but on my chest.

542
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:58,931
Two hands...four legs...

543
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:00,138
What are you saying?

544
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,843
She called me and bid bye.

545
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:05,841
Damn it.

546
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:07,548
These girls behave so.

547
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,670
Okay, don't worry.

548
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,751
Will you take two pegs?

549
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,915
It's costly here.
Let's go to Pondicherry.

550
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,830
Okay.

551
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,610
You've boozed, stripped and
thrown your clothes into the sea.

552
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,733
It's good time,
no one has seen.

553
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,564
Come here.

554
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,852
Why are you doing like that?

555
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:37,808
Are you drunk?

556
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:42,429
Hey, you fought with us
for the sake of love and staying here.

557
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:44,260
Then, why are you roaming
with other woman?

558
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,551
That too a pregnant woman.

559
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,173
Dad, he is the house owner,
Varadarajan.

560
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,547
Go away.

561
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,545
Greetings, sir.

562
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:53,502
Are you good?

563
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:55,042
Where are you taking this from?

564
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,749
Why dressed so insane?

565
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,954
Dad, the dog took away his attire.

566
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:00,453
But, you've mistaken.

567
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,326
Okay, whatever happened is happened.

568
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,825
I spoke out of anger,
on that day.

569
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:05,573
Your mom keeps weeping.

570
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:06,822
Come home.

571
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:08,611
You'll be spoilt,
if you stay here.

572
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:11,733
My son looks handsome
like Yasser Arafat.

573
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,065
Come home, dear.

574
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,642
Mathi, see who is coming.
-I saw.

575
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,514
Don't speak to him.

576
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:26,385
If you speak, he'll give excuses
to the core.

577
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:28,383
Then, I'll be enraged.

578
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,631
He expelled us for the
sake of that girl.

579
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:32,213
We'll expel him, now.

580
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:37,207
Why is your face so dark
like lighting a firecracker?

581
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,456
Hey, my nose.

582
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:43,076
Uncle, why are you washing
the bike removing the engine?

583
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:44,159
Is it a theft bike?

584
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,323
Hey, it's the doctor's bike.

585
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:49,195
We must deliver it today evening.
Do your work.

586
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,899
Why are you enraged?

587
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,645
You approach us for
every other problem except this.

588
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,018
You proceed alone.

589
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:01,267
We don't want your presence.

590
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:03,849
Saravanan brother! you asked for
two bottles of alcohol.

591
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,722
Keep it there and go.

592
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,584
Leave it, boss.

593
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:17,958
He is our friend.

594
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,082
What to do?

595
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,997
Whatever, who is he?

596
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:22,079
Your nephew.

597
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,244
Who is there for him
other than us?

598
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,118
Saravanan, don't worry.

599
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:27,782
Wait a minute.

600
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:32,194
What's that?
-Glass.

601
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:33,443
Hey, you...

602
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,775
Why are you hitting?
- Don't be enraged.

603
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:38,522
You took the tea-glass.

604
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,810
Another glass is in the cupboard.
Bring it.

605
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,558
Oh!

606
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:53,715
Saravanan brother, the house owner
asked for alcohol.

607
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,254
Has it arrived?
-Here it is, take it.

608
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,834
What's this?

609
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,625
So, it's not for us?

610
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,623
See, how he humiliated us.

611
00:34:03,622 --> 00:34:06,202
I thought of apologizing.

612
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:09,282
But, you behaved disgustingly
after looking at the alcohol.

613
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:10,823
I don't want to ask for apology.

614
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:13,363
Either be as friends or get lost.
-Saravanan!

615
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:14,859
He has to redeem my jewelry,
this month.

616
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:15,609
Saravanan!

617
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:16,233
Stop.

618
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:17,483
I've to talk about an important issue.

619
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,314
Don't ask me for alcohol,
I won't get you.

620
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:20,355
Not at all.

621
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:21,895
Let's speak while rectifying the deflate.

622
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,059
Say properly.

623
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:27,598
Give me a water bottle
without cooling.

624
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:28,888
Take it, sir.

625
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:33,800
Sir, aren't you Mr.Anantharaman?

626
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:34,299
Yes.

627
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,172
I read about you
in yesterday's daily.

628
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,876
I felt so happy to know
about an honest officer.

629
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,333
As you left,
mother was weeping..

630
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,040
She has gone.
leave it, dude.

631
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,996
Not that, mom...dad...

632
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,368
Those who steal petrol
shouldn't speak philosophy.

633
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:49,825
Kumar, check the deflation of this bike.

634
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,905
Another bike has arrived.
Finish it fast.

635
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,248
Hey!

636
00:35:26,622 --> 00:35:28,495
Hey!
-Hey!

637
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:29,744
Hey, what did you do?

638
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:33,723
Sir, what happened?
-Sir!

639
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,805
Someone come here.

640
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:36,638
Come on.

641
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:38,053
Someone come here.

642
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,926
Someone call the ambulance.

643
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:41,424
Someone call his home.
-Sir!

644
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:43,838
Someone spit on his face.

645
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,128
If it happens to you tomorrow,
will you do the same?

646
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:46,919
Bring water.

647
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:47,626
Okay.
- Don't know.

648
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:49,250
Check the phone.

649
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:50,831
Sir!

650
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:51,872
Look here, sir.

651
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:53,454
The phone is locked.
-Is it?

652
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,495
Sir!
Water.

653
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:55,410
Have some water, sir.

654
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,156
Uncle, he is Divya's dad.

655
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,280
Oh, no!
Come, let's go away.

656
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,279
Hey, lift him.

657
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:03,070
Is it! Lift him.
-Lift him.

658
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,068
Auto!

659
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:07,231
Hold him.
-Take him to the hospital.

660
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,065
Hurry up.

661
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:11,934
Uncle, I don't know whether
she'll attend the call...

662
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:14,392
...from my number.
you convey her the message.

663
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:36,495
An angel is seen in
the form of skeleton.

664
00:36:43,488 --> 00:36:45,028
I know...I know...

665
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,943
Welcome!

666
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:50,190
Why are you here
at the soup shop?

667
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,353
Divya, what happened?

668
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:55,975
Why are you laughing?

669
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,724
I'm not laughing,
but weeping.

670
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:58,473
Why?

671
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,679
What happened?

672
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:01,802
My dad is everything to me.

673
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,801
You saved his life.

674
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:04,967
So?

675
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:13,666
I want to thank you
and say again, 'I love you'

676
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,331
It's okay.

677
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:17,828
Hey, what's that?

678
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:18,910
'I love you'?

679
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,618
It's the bone in the gravy...

680
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:22,699
I don't want your story.
Go away.

681
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,072
No, I'm telling the truth.

682
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:25,486
How am I looking like?

683
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:26,861
Like a ready to wear attire?

684
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:29,942
To stick and remove.

685
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:34,145
It won't work out.
-It'll work out.

686
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,559
I don't belong to your community.
-It's okay.

687
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,181
I'm a locale guy.
-It's okay.

688
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:43,595
The taste of the idly is
enhanced only by the chutney.

689
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,759
The life is also the same.

690
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:47,173
Our happiness depends on
who we live with.

691
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:49,672
Are you giving back my words?

692
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:52,751
I can't believe you.

693
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,792
Shall I do one thing
to make you believe?

694
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:56,290
What?

695
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:00,077
Shall I kiss?

696
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:00,827
Kiss!

697
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:04,656
Anyhow, she will bid bye, later.

698
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,654
Enjoy it, now.

699
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:11,400
Hey, are you taking the video?

700
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,856
Are you a matured guy?
Get lost.

701
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:17,769
Okay, give me.

702
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,141
I'll give on another day.

703
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,389
Now, everyone is here.

704
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,970
What's this?
It's not right.

705
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,718
I don't want this light touch.

706
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,383
It won't work out.

707
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:30,130
I'll do whatever you say.

708
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:34,544
Bijli, give me a half boiled egg.

709
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:35,750
Just a minute.

710
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:40,663
Take it.

711
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,618
Eat this.

712
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:44,742
I'll believe you, then.

713
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:49,195
It smells odd.

714
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:51,359
Manage to eat it, applying
talcum powder in handkerchief.

715
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:59,477
Eat it.

716
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:11,923
I believe now.

717
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:13,754
'I love you'.

718
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:33,693
The carousel was moved...

719
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:37,647
I want to show you to
my mother as my wife

720
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:41,559
You must feed me
the sweet along with love

721
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:45,514
You should swing my baby
in the cradle

722
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:49,552
You kissed on my lip
and dragged me

723
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:54,046
You're reacting before growing up

724
00:39:54,297 --> 00:39:57,626
I caught a fish with galore

725
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:01,581
She made this locale don, a crazy

726
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:27,889
She sent the candy as the rocket

727
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,927
She fired the bullets

728
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,844
She hit just, I fell for her

729
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:33,923
She intruded in my heart
and created a scene

730
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:46,078
What are you speaking?
What's your story?

731
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:49,867
From today, you're an angel
to the nation

732
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,986
My body is getting fit

733
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:57,899
Don't leave me at anytime,
for any reason

734
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:01,563
I'm going to pledge
the new brass vessel

735
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:05,683
For the money to roam with you

736
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,429
You expressed your love
to me, highly

737
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,883
Why are you moving away,
giving the love?

738
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,930
The flow of your smile
seems to be slow on other side

739
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:53,885
You seduced me
in your beauteous steps

740
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:58,048
Hug me, no hindrances
for both of us

741
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,835
My soul fell on your lap

742
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,833
To get rid of you...

743
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,873
You aren't a simple babe...

744
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,789
My angel...

745
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,745
I don't have any health issues

746
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:13,532
You're the bird of the starling family,
my eyes are tingling on your tone

747
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,489
My in-law is your dad...

748
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,944
I'm not blabbering, drunk heavily...

749
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:55,953
My mom will scold me.

750
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:57,119
Hi, Divya!

751
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,742
What happened to her?

752
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:04,611
Who's that? your dad?

753
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:05,569
Getting irritated.

754
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:06,775
My love lady.

755
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:09,815
She'll call me and bid bye.

756
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:12,436
Tell me.

757
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:13,270
I know.

758
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,226
We aren't a suitable match.

759
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:16,974
My dad will not accept.

760
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,056
It's break-up, right?

761
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,471
Don't worry about break-up.

762
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,553
We'll get it done.

763
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:21,261
You....

764
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:22,303
Hey, just old jokes.

765
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:24,050
It's break-up, right?

766
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,673
It's a big issue.

767
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:27,339
Tomorrow, the bridegroom's family
is coming to my house.

768
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:29,211
His name is, 'Parthasarathi'.

769
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:30,835
That's all, right?

770
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,375
You heed so cool.

771
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,498
Send me his details.

772
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:37,578
It's nothing,
I'll take care.

773
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:40,575
What happened?
What?

774
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:43,115
Some body coming to
see my love lady.

775
00:43:43,115 --> 00:43:46,320
Who is interfering in my
brother-in-law's love?

776
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,068
No need of those.

777
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:49,732
I got his details.

778
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:51,523
It's enough to meet him
in person and tell.

779
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:54,229
Who is he, looking like
a foreign cow?

780
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,809
Dude, speak to him in English.

781
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,766
That'll be right.
-Is it?

782
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:01,679
Are you Parthasaradhi?

783
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,760
I'm Saro.

784
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:05,925
Do you know Divya?

785
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,173
Yeah, I know Divya.

786
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,588
We're family friends.

787
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:11,585
I know her for past fifteen years.

788
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:13,043
We're going to get married soon.

789
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,999
Why?
What's up with you, guys?

790
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,790
We'll speak in Tamil.

791
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,454
Dude, speak now.

792
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:21,909
Are you going to Anantharaman's
house to see Divya?

793
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,657
Yes, so what?

794
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:24,906
He loves her.
-What?

795
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:27,486
When I'm speaking,
why do you interfere?

796
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,276
I love her, you stay away.

797
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:31,774
I've seen so many like this.

798
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:32,440
You can leave.

799
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,477
Hey flat faced, everything is over
between them.

800
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:37,644
Can't you understand?

801
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:39,267
It's all over.

802
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:40,891
Are you dubious?

803
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:44,261
For safety concern,
I took a video.

804
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:45,843
Is that video?

805
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:50,379
Show me.

806
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:51,629
Stop it.

807
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:53,669
Why must I show our video to you?

808
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:56,125
Go and get her married.

809
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,372
I'll wrap it with gift paper
and present you.

810
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:01,410
Brother, I'll go ahead.

811
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:02,160
Be careful.

812
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,575
This doesn't matter, brother.

813
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,908
It has become casual.

814
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:07,654
Even the personal videos
are disowned, nowadays.

815
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:08,738
You can leave.

816
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:09,527
What?

817
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:13,482
I'll bang you on the neck.

818
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:14,481
Please, brother.

819
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,813
Please!
-Dare to yell at my brother-in-law?

820
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:21,891
(Indistinct voices)

821
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:23,182
Security!

822
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:25,845
Take it, sir.

823
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:26,802
Pay this.

824
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:27,594
Okay, I'll look at it.

825
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:30,673
You made me to pay
the fine, unwantedly.

826
00:45:30,673 --> 00:45:32,839
Who knows, it'll happen so?
-I told you not to do.

827
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,917
Tell me.

828
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:37,916
Don't you've sense?

829
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,082
Why did you hit him?

830
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,914
My dad was aware of everything.

831
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,745
Our marriage will not happen.

832
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,952
Only break up.

833
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,157
Break up comes once
in other's love life.

834
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:50,155
Instead, it's like an advertisement,
comes often in my love.

835
00:45:51,861 --> 00:45:56,731
This time, I'll pack
the parcel perfectly.

836
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,310
No need of this parcel
and take away.

837
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:01,184
It's enough, if you stay quiet.

838
00:46:01,434 --> 00:46:02,933
I'm telling you...

839
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:04,223
I'll take care.

840
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:07,054
Always saying as you'll take care
and flattened Partha's face.

841
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:08,635
What are you going to do now?

842
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:12,256
To solve your dad's issue,
I've drafted a perfect plan.

843
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:15,295
Nothing will go wrong, isn't it?

844
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,875
You aren't allowing to do
anything wrong.

845
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,165
Damn, hang up the call.

846
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:30,780
Get up.

847
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:35,525
Saravanan, is he living
in this house?

848
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:37,481
Dad, it's the own house.

849
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:39,896
You've to talk to her father
and settle the marriage.

850
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,019
Okay, don't worry.

851
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:55,048
Saravanan, why did you
come here, now?

852
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:57,960
My parents have come
to speak with your dad.

853
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:00,126
Welcome, uncle!

854
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:02,623
Welcome, aunty!
-Divya, who are these people?

855
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:06,619
Mom, he is Saravanan.
-Greetings, Aunty.

856
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:07,826
His parents!

857
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:08,784
Greetings!

858
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,116
Why are you here?

859
00:47:10,116 --> 00:47:13,403
To speak with your consort.
-Consort?

860
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,609
Mom, they say about dad.

861
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:18,191
Please, wait.

862
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:19,148
Get inside.

863
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,644
Why have they come here, now?

864
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:24,809
I don't know, mom.

865
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:26,682
You said that you'll act well
when applied tridental mark.

866
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:27,890
Hey non-stick head...

867
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,263
Sit here.

868
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:30,386
Consort...

869
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:31,719
If you open your mouth,
I'll kill you.

870
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:32,843
It's the house of a big shot.

871
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:33,634
Do behave decently.

872
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:35,923
Yeah, he behaves decently.

873
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:36,881
What did I do?

874
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,545
You look like a drug addict,
lying along the drainage.

875
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:40,045
Put your legs down.
- Put your legs down.

876
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:42,833
Dad is calling you.
-We're coming.

877
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:48,202
Have you noticed,
a separate room is given to Krishna?

878
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,077
That's the pooja room.

879
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:49,951
Greetings, sir!

880
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:53,489
Greetings, uncle!
-Greetings, sir!

881
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,988
Take this.

882
00:47:54,988 --> 00:47:56,985
Take it.
-Take it and keep inside.

883
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:59,067
It's just fruits.
-Take it.

884
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:01,105
Why didn't he wear the attire?

885
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:03,313
Sit down.

886
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,017
Dad, he is Saravanan.

887
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:09,931
He saved your life, on that day.

888
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:15,300
Oh! only his friends
thrashed Parthasaradhi.

889
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:18,590
What did you do?

890
00:48:21,004 --> 00:48:23,543
Sir, I'll come to the point,
straight away.

891
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:28,996
Everyone says, you won't care
the religion, caste, creed and clan.

892
00:48:28,996 --> 00:48:31,243
Trusting that, I came with a
marriage proposal of my son...

893
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,074
...with your daughter.

894
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:35,239
They both love each other.

895
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:38,444
We've to arrange their marriage.

896
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:40,317
Am I right?

897
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,689
Aah! What you said is right.

898
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,935
Our traditions and customs
are different.

899
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:47,476
Okay, let it be.

900
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:49,307
We're orthodox people.

901
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:49,808
What about you?

902
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:51,390
We aren't.

903
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,135
You visit the temple of Lord Shiva.

904
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:55,469
We visit the temple of the goddess.

905
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,801
Even yesterday,
we went to the goddess temple.

906
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:01,836
Dear!

907
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,456
Sing a hymn.

908
00:49:07,456 --> 00:49:08,789
Sing a good song.

909
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:10,870
Sing, dear.

910
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:48,582
A devotional song.

911
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:49,873
Excellent!

912
00:49:52,286 --> 00:49:53,369
Heed to it?

913
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:55,575
It'll not come on it's own.

914
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:59,696
From childhood,
we've to teach them.

915
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,819
See, my son will sing, now.

916
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,067
Heat it.

917
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:06,230
What's this?

918
00:50:06,814 --> 00:50:09,145
Why are you staring at my face?
Are you a dolt?

919
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:09,644
Come on, sing.

920
00:50:09,895 --> 00:50:11,559
Saro, sing now.
-Why, mom?

921
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:12,267
Come on, sing.

922
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:25,463
Our area will be darkened,
with lanes, weary and jovial

923
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:28,500
Come and have a look around

924
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,203
We'll sleep on the road
When we wake up, will have tea

925
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:38,615
We'll eat healthier,
Even we've rice for breakfast

926
00:50:38,615 --> 00:50:40,864
If you laugh, we'll laugh too

927
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:43,360
If you thump out the foot,
we'll break the face

928
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,565
If said sorry, it's okay,
Else, will be hit

929
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:51,145
We've come for asking the bride

930
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:53,600
Exchange the betel leaves
plates, quietly

931
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,973
Father of my babe...

932
00:50:55,973 --> 00:51:02,467
You're my father-in-law

933
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:17,576
Sir, heed to it?

934
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,323
You taught your daughter.

935
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:22,364
I didn't teach my son anything.

936
00:51:22,973 --> 00:51:26,593
He started singing, spontaneously.
Known his talent now?

937
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:29,132
I knew well about you.

938
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:30,174
Okay, let it be.

939
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:43,245
What?

940
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,368
Come.

941
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:46,532
Come, let's go.

942
00:51:57,064 --> 00:52:01,308
Divya, dad has never earned
a bad name.

943
00:52:02,432 --> 00:52:04,430
I'm afraid, it'll happen
because of you.

944
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:13,048
Why aren't you attending the call?

945
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:15,878
Don't you like me?

946
00:52:16,003 --> 00:52:17,542
My dad doesn't like you.

947
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,830
If a child is born to us,
he'll be suppressed like a cow.

948
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,453
I'm speaking seriously.

949
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:25,868
Childbirth is also a serious issue.

950
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,116
I'll not disobey my dad.

951
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:30,905
Hey, every father opposes
his daughter's love.

952
00:52:30,905 --> 00:52:32,860
They get married, in spite of it.

953
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:35,483
You're adoring your dad too much.

954
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:37,273
Because, he is so good.

955
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:38,688
So good?
-Yes.

956
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,103
More than the Buddha
and the Siddhas?

957
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:41,560
Won't he hit the mosquito
if it bites?

958
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,725
He is torturing too much,
doll-candy head.

959
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:44,807
Mind your words.

960
00:52:48,386 --> 00:52:52,257
Okay, I'll give you one last chance.

961
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:55,921
To say my dad is bad,
not intense...

962
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:57,835
But, a small incident is enough.

963
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:00,541
I'll throw away everything
and come behind you.

964
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:02,748
But, definitely it'll not happen.

965
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:06,077
It's good to forget me
and look after your work.

966
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,032
Hey, stop.

967
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,364
I said, stop.

968
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,277
Okay, go...

969
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,348
Hey! won't you attend the call?

970
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:29,971
I'll thump you.

971
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,677
Take the phone.

972
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:33,467
Why are you calling several times?

973
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:35,256
You'd have attended.

974
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:38,046
Where are you?

975
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:39,752
I'm behind you.

976
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:44,497
Come immediately, hiring a cab.

977
00:53:44,497 --> 00:53:47,245
He is high.

978
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:50,449
Shall we escape?

979
00:53:50,616 --> 00:53:54,278
You want me to leave
him alone, inebriated?

980
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:58,608
Silvery moon...
-He is ecstatic!

981
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:01,189
Sit, let's enjoy.

982
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,603
Washed your hands?

983
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:06,393
What's your problem to
booze heavily?

984
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,057
Who is having the problem?

985
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:10,638
I'm happy.

986
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:12,552
I'm enjoying to the core.

987
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:14,300
He is going to say a message.

988
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,091
Dude, Divya is...

989
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:22,459
Have you thrown the bucket
in the well before marriage?

990
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:24,582
What did you say?

991
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,039
What did you say?

992
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,203
Are you afraid?

993
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,741
I just threatened you,
don't scold me.

994
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:33,990
What did you say?

995
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,029
He is singing a song.

996
00:54:36,196 --> 00:54:39,359
I just threatened you,
don't scold me.

997
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,650
It's okay.

998
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,355
If you want to convey something,
sit and say.

999
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,059
Uncle, it's about Divya...

1000
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:49,515
With scissors...

1001
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:50,723
I cut her relationship.

1002
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:52,888
Excellent, dude.

1003
00:54:52,888 --> 00:54:54,719
Pour it.

1004
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,300
Enjoy.

1005
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:58,798
Don't weep, I've kept it.

1006
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:00,671
Why are you weeping?

1007
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:04,708
Not for chicken, then?

1008
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:05,957
Then, why are you weeping?

1009
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:10,785
You may get hit
on the forehead.

1010
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:15,531
Divya!

1011
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:20,109
She left me.

1012
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:20,859
What are you saying?

1013
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,357
I didn't leave her.

1014
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:24,230
She rejected me.

1015
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,686
Divya!

1016
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:29,309
Hey, what are you saying?

1017
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:38,248
Uncle, her father didn't like me.

1018
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:43,160
Does any father likes the
daughter's beau?

1019
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,742
Stay quiet.

1020
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,073
I feel panic on your behaviour.

1021
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:48,279
Remove it.

1022
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:50,278
What does she wants to do?

1023
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:58,352
Dare to speak my love lady,
disrespectfully?

1024
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:00,351
Okay.

1025
00:56:01,183 --> 00:56:04,430
I'll bang you.

1026
00:56:05,303 --> 00:56:08,551
Uncle, come here.

1027
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:09,925
Why?
-Come here.

1028
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:12,214
What did she tell you, now?

1029
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:15,129
She says to spot
her father as bad.

1030
00:56:15,129 --> 00:56:18,542
So that, she'll throw away
everything and come along.

1031
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:22,246
Okay, if her father is spotted
as bad, will she come?

1032
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:23,786
I'm sorry.

1033
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,243
Will 'Madam' come?

1034
00:56:31,528 --> 00:56:35,816
She rejected me, but you call
her as, 'Madam'.

1035
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,270
Why are you doing like this?

1036
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,352
Isn't he your uncle?

1037
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:42,018
Stay there.

1038
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,265
I'll take the peanuts.

1039
00:56:44,932 --> 00:56:46,514
I'll slap you.
Sit down.

1040
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,883
Uncle, is her father so good?
Can't we portray him as bad?

1041
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:55,588
Dude, the entire locality knows
how good he is.

1042
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,669
How will you portray him as bad?

1043
00:56:57,669 --> 00:57:00,832
So, she will not marry you
until her father is alive.

1044
00:57:00,957 --> 00:57:02,289
What did you say?

1045
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,620
What did you say?
- What did you say?

1046
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,449
I said, Madam will not marry you
until uncle is alive.

1047
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:11,988
So, Divya likes him.

1048
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,360
But, her father didn't like me, right?

1049
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:21,728
Why is he doing yoga?

1050
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:25,391
I'm planning to murder her father.

1051
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:27,264
Are you going to do murder?

1052
00:57:27,264 --> 00:57:28,179
Hey!

1053
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,260
Give it.

1054
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,344
Are you blabbering?

1055
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:32,675
I'm not blabbering, uncle.

1056
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:33,966
My mind is fresh.

1057
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:35,090
It's planned, perfectly.

1058
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,963
I'll slit him into half, tonight.

1059
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:39,710
I'll cut into pieces.
-I must escape.

1060
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:41,583
Hello!

1061
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,581
Is it!

1062
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:45,746
I'll come, immediately.
Hang up the call.

1063
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:49,700
Saravanan, granny fell in the toilet.

1064
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,448
I'll go to the hospital
and come back.

1065
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:53,154
Senseless.

1066
00:57:53,154 --> 00:57:54,236
Who?

1067
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:55,194
The granny.

1068
00:57:58,399 --> 00:58:01,188
You speak well.

1069
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,477
But, you must speak
on your phone.

1070
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:04,893
That's my phone.

1071
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:07,765
Damn it.

1072
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:10,929
I thought you're a thug.

1073
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:13,093
But, shivering for a murder.

1074
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:14,133
Don't want all those.

1075
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:16,548
It's the age to live.

1076
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,170
You want to booze for free.

1077
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,585
Have it and leave.

1078
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:25,914
Why are you humiliating us?
-I’ll do like that, only.

1079
00:58:25,914 --> 00:58:28,452
Are we behind you for free booze?
-Yes.

1080
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:32,032
Are you my friends?

1081
00:58:32,032 --> 00:58:34,947
A friend is the one who gives
his life for the sake of love.

1082
00:58:35,696 --> 00:58:37,944
Those who stay to booze free,
isn't good friends.

1083
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:39,483
All vehicles come this way.

1084
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:40,691
That's one way.

1085
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,188
A murder will happen, today.

1086
00:58:43,188 --> 00:58:47,018
I'm going to do a murder, today.

1087
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:52,054
I'll kill my father-in-law
and marry Divya.

1088
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:04,667
Saravanan!

1089
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,163
That's his leg.

1090
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:09,328
Saravanan!

1091
00:59:09,828 --> 00:59:11,118
Saravanan!

1092
00:59:11,826 --> 00:59:12,742
Get up.

1093
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:17,153
Good morning!

1094
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,070
Give me your hand.

1095
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:19,444
Congratulations!

1096
00:59:19,444 --> 00:59:21,900
A gift is awaiting for you.

1097
00:59:22,774 --> 00:59:25,438
Come, we'll show you.

1098
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,594
What's that?

1099
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,997
What did you do?
-We made it fresh.

1100
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,825
Uncle!

1101
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:58,029
What did you do?

1102
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:01,276
Uncle!

1103
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,773
Hey, have you killed him, really?

1104
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,811
Hey, many ways are there
to spot him as bad.

1105
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:09,685
Will you kill him for that sake?

1106
01:00:09,685 --> 01:00:11,516
Why are you getting scattered?

1107
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,722
Last night, you said
you'll murder him.

1108
01:00:16,136 --> 01:00:17,385
Hey, I said inebriated.

1109
01:00:17,385 --> 01:00:19,258
We too did, inebriated.

1110
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:28,708
How did you do it?

1111
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:35,159
Hey, egg head.
Come soon.

1112
01:00:35,783 --> 01:00:38,156
Dude, what happened?

1113
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:40,154
Tiruvanmiyur?

1114
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:41,611
Auto.

1115
01:00:42,277 --> 01:00:43,193
Where do you want to go, sir?

1116
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:44,733
We can't reach Tiruvanmiyur,
this way.

1117
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:46,690
This road will not
lead to Tiruvanmiyur.

1118
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,479
But....

1119
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,478
No, dude.

1120
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,476
I can't understand.
-Can't you understand?

1121
01:00:51,726 --> 01:00:52,851
You'll understand, now.

1122
01:00:53,057 --> 01:00:55,014
This road will not
lead to Tiruvanmiyur.

1123
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:57,221
But....

1124
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:59,593
Knife!
-It's knife only!

1125
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:01,716
Ask us, who are we?
-Who are you?

1126
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:14,203
Hey, Mani is standing there.

1127
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,660
Hey, come fast.

1128
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,368
I'm coming.
- Come.

1129
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:16,908
Move.

1130
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:36,734
You know what!

1131
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:38,443
He has a very good sense
of humour.

1132
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:40,359
You've told me already.

1133
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:41,859
Call from your beau?
-Mom is calling.

1134
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:42,902
Hello!

1135
01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:43,943
What!

1136
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:46,193
Hey, stop.

1137
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:56,234
Divya, what happened?

1138
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:58,109
What happened?

1139
01:02:58,693 --> 01:02:59,984
Divya, I'm asking you.

1140
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,068
What happened?

1141
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:01,734
Go home.

1142
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:08,359
Can i tie?

1143
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:09,818
Hey, tie it properly.

1144
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:31,234
Come on.

1145
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:34,568
Everything is going on well.

1146
01:03:34,902 --> 01:03:36,818
Arrangements have been done.

1147
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:39,319
They denied the drums.

1148
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,943
He was walking.

1149
01:03:46,776 --> 01:03:47,734
It's over.

1150
01:03:49,443 --> 01:03:50,234
It's okay.

1151
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:52,902
I'm there for you, Divya.

1152
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:55,443
Divya!

1153
01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:57,984
Divya!
What happened?

1154
01:03:57,984 --> 01:03:58,443
Divya!

1155
01:03:58,443 --> 01:03:59,109
Divya! see here.

1156
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:00,526
Give the water.

1157
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:01,359
Divya!

1158
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:02,859
Divya!

1159
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:05,109
Look at me.
Get up.

1160
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,693
Divya!
-Get up.

1161
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:08,568
Divya!
Get up.

1162
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:26,526
I never thought,
it'll happen like this.

1163
01:04:26,526 --> 01:04:29,359
The God has no eyes.

1164
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,027
How it has happened?

1165
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:37,859
Only that guys know.

1166
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:41,359
They're talking pointing at us.

1167
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:44,526
He is coming here.

1168
01:04:47,902 --> 01:04:50,526
Excuse me, it's you who admitted
him in the hospital.

1169
01:04:50,526 --> 01:04:51,859
What happened to him?

1170
01:04:53,277 --> 01:04:57,776
Oh, no! How to say that?

1171
01:04:57,776 --> 01:04:58,984
At least, you tell me.

1172
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:06,609
I try to say,
but struck with agony.

1173
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:09,526
Tell me, what happened?

1174
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:13,401
They've joined us and escaped, dude.

1175
01:05:13,984 --> 01:05:15,068
I'm asking you, won't you tell?

1176
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:16,068
How to tell?

1177
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:19,443
That is...

1178
01:05:19,443 --> 01:05:22,068
On the lane...

1179
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:25,027
Sir, he got heart attack.

1180
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:28,319
Suddenly, he got chest pain
and fell down.

1181
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:29,651
No signs of movement.

1182
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:31,818
Everyone was staring at him.

1183
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:36,152
He came there at that moment
and took him to the hospital.

1184
01:05:36,277 --> 01:05:39,068
He died on the way.

1185
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,277
Not blessed enough!

1186
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:42,319
But, good soul.

1187
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,483
He'll reach heaven.

1188
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,483
What's in our hands?

1189
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:50,109
Don't cry.

1190
01:05:51,526 --> 01:05:53,319
Uncle!

1191
01:05:54,568 --> 01:05:58,152
Wow! even we wouldn't have
narrated like this.

1192
01:05:58,152 --> 01:05:59,483
He said in a superfluous flow.

1193
01:05:59,483 --> 01:06:00,734
Sir!

1194
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:05,319
What a flow, sir!

1195
01:06:05,734 --> 01:06:06,859
Excellent dialogues!

1196
01:06:06,859 --> 01:06:08,319
Old is gold.

1197
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,401
Stay with me till
the last rites.

1198
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:12,277
Come on.

1199
01:06:12,277 --> 01:06:14,152
Sir will take care, today.

1200
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:17,359
He is rich skinned like a tomato.

1201
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,651
Oh, god!
don't you've mercy!

1202
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,859
Sir, why it happened?

1203
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:23,902
How it happened?

1204
01:06:26,776 --> 01:06:28,234
Shut your mouth.

1205
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,818
I'll stuff your mouth
with wooden log.

1206
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:30,984
It's you who admitted him
in the hospital.

1207
01:06:30,984 --> 01:06:31,902
Tell me, how it happened?

1208
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:33,068
He is asking, tell him.

1209
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:35,818
Me...

1210
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:40,319
Sir, my assistant will tell
better than me.

1211
01:06:40,776 --> 01:06:42,526
You'll get a clarity.
Just a minute.

1212
01:06:42,818 --> 01:06:44,027
Sir, blue shirt.

1213
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:46,483
God!

1214
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:47,401
Sir, here.

1215
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,818
Sir, you conveyed me
in a flow, isn't it?

1216
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:54,734
Will you convey the same to him?

1217
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:56,734
Thank you, my god!

1218
01:06:57,693 --> 01:06:58,776
Sir, that's is...

1219
01:06:58,776 --> 01:06:59,984
He got heart attack.

1220
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,776
He fell down with chest pain.

1221
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:06,319
This guy took him to the hospital.

1222
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:08,109
He died on the way.

1223
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,609
Not blessed enough!

1224
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,526
Oh, brother-in-law!

1225
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:15,776
Brother-in-law!

1226
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:20,693
You left us!

1227
01:07:22,651 --> 01:07:26,068
You orphaned my sister.

1228
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:32,277
Drunkard!

1229
01:07:32,443 --> 01:07:33,943
He drunk even today.

1230
01:07:33,943 --> 01:07:36,193
Don't know what is
he going to do still.

1231
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:40,234
Brother, take him to the backyard
and pour water on him.

1232
01:07:40,443 --> 01:07:43,068
Pattu, why are you speaking different?

1233
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:44,401
Go away, sinner.

1234
01:07:44,401 --> 01:07:45,776
This gives energy to me.

1235
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,277
Good taste.

1236
01:07:47,277 --> 01:07:49,319
Heed me, go away.

1237
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:52,984
God!

1238
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,734
I'll yell at you.

1239
01:07:55,193 --> 01:07:58,109
You're running away looking
at the people who comes to console.

1240
01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:00,319
What to do?

1241
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,027
When going down, the fear
is getting increased.

1242
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:05,359
We'll escape and go somewhere.

1243
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,277
Shall we go to Palaverkadu
through Tiruverkadu?

1244
01:08:07,277 --> 01:08:09,609
No need,
let's go to Pondicherry.

1245
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:11,277
You idiot...

1246
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:13,818
Asking where to go?

1247
01:08:13,818 --> 01:08:14,984
Leave it, uncle.

1248
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:16,193
He is talking senseless.

1249
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,193
Is it the way to talk?

1250
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,193
We'll go to the place
which we haven't seen.

1251
01:08:21,693 --> 01:08:23,568
Leave me.

1252
01:08:24,152 --> 01:08:25,568
I can't trust you and send out.

1253
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:27,152
You'll blabber, definitely.

1254
01:08:27,443 --> 01:08:29,193
Stay with me till the funeral.

1255
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:30,776
What he says is also right.

1256
01:08:30,776 --> 01:08:32,443
Only then, we could know
what's happening here.

1257
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:34,651
If it's revealed that three of us
held his hands and legs...

1258
01:08:34,651 --> 01:08:37,027
...and poisoned him?

1259
01:08:41,526 --> 01:08:43,027
It's revealed!

1260
01:08:43,443 --> 01:08:44,359
What do you say?

1261
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,027
I said, it's revealed.

1262
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:51,234
That's why, the dwarf hero
takes revenge on others.

1263
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:53,359
Srividhya will give them poison.

1264
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:56,526
It's the film, 'Apoorva Sagotharargal'.

1265
01:08:56,693 --> 01:09:00,734
Hey, dare to talk about a film
in the death of my brother-in-law?

1266
01:09:01,526 --> 01:09:02,193
What about you?

1267
01:09:02,193 --> 01:09:04,193
Can you use washroom
at the death place?

1268
01:09:04,193 --> 01:09:05,902
It's an urgency.

1269
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:07,526
Okay, leave it.

1270
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:09,109
Both of you are at fault.
You're right!

1271
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,109
Don't brawl in the place of death.
Get compromised.

1272
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,068
Compromise!

1273
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:14,027
Urgency...

1274
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:16,568
Who are you?
-Who are you?

1275
01:09:16,693 --> 01:09:21,859
Instead of asking me,
ask someone about me.

1276
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,776
Oh, no! He is a terrific person.

1277
01:09:24,776 --> 01:09:26,359
Be careful with him.

1278
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:27,943
This is what others
will say about me.

1279
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:29,818
Where are you going?

1280
01:09:30,277 --> 01:09:31,651
Okay, I'll ask and come.

1281
01:09:31,651 --> 01:09:33,693
Come soon.
I'll wait here.

1282
01:09:34,902 --> 01:09:36,068
Switch on the cameras.

1283
01:09:36,068 --> 01:09:36,943
Come fast.

1284
01:09:39,027 --> 01:09:44,319
A good social worker, a humanitarian,
Tahsildar Anantharaman died...

1285
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,568
...in the morning due to heart attack.

1286
01:09:48,568 --> 01:09:55,443
To pay homage, not only his relatives
even the public, Government officials...

1287
01:09:55,443 --> 01:09:57,651
...and political leaders are coming.

1288
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:00,109
What happened, sir?

1289
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:02,234
Suddenly, he got chest pain
and fell down.

1290
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:06,483
At that moment, these guys took
him to the hospital.

1291
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:08,277
But, he died on the way.

1292
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:09,568
Not blessed enough!

1293
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:12,193
You shouldn't blabber in high.

1294
01:10:12,193 --> 01:10:14,068
And shouldn't scream in low.

1295
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:17,027
Booze in limits and stay quiet
till the funeral.

1296
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:17,943
Understand?
-Okay, dude.

1297
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:19,734
Only then, no one will be
dubious on us.

1298
01:10:19,943 --> 01:10:21,319
The doubt has raised.

1299
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:26,526
Oh! he got caught exactly.

1300
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:29,943
I got the doubt.

1301
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:35,152
The astrologer told he'll live long
till 90 years of age.

1302
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:37,483
Suddenly, he died.

1303
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,902
What does it mean?

1304
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,693
It means, the astrologer lied.

1305
01:10:40,693 --> 01:10:42,109
Oh, no!

1306
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:47,109
I must find who is the reason
for his death...

1307
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,234
...and nab him, garland his intestines
and go.

1308
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:50,027
In which temple?

1309
01:10:50,027 --> 01:10:51,359
Wherever I want.

1310
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:52,483
You'll be slapped.

1311
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:56,693
Funny guys.

1312
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:57,234
Booze here.

1313
01:10:57,234 --> 01:11:00,277
He was talking for this booze?

1314
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:01,859
Give me the bottle.

1315
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:03,568
Take it.

1316
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:04,776
You...

1317
01:11:05,443 --> 01:11:06,443
Take it.

1318
01:11:09,109 --> 01:11:10,193
I'll make a move.

1319
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:11,401
Uncle...

1320
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:12,526
You left this, here.

1321
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:14,568
Keep it inside.

1322
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:15,401
Some body will watch.

1323
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:18,651
It's raining.
Go soon.

1324
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:19,943
Don't get drenched.

1325
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:24,027
Oh, god!

1326
01:11:35,902 --> 01:11:37,027
Sir, take away your hand.

1327
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:38,319
What happened?

1328
01:11:43,776 --> 01:11:44,734
It's a rape attempt.

1329
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,734
He is MLA's son.

1330
01:11:47,943 --> 01:11:49,109
Listened?

1331
01:11:50,443 --> 01:11:51,526
He is MLA's son.

1332
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:55,193
What, if you're MLA's son?

1333
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:58,152
You're a pervert.

1334
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,693
Bastard, dare to speak to me.

1335
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:06,609
Take the tea.

1336
01:12:06,776 --> 01:12:07,443
No.

1337
01:12:07,526 --> 01:12:09,568
You aren't having tea.

1338
01:12:09,568 --> 01:12:10,818
It'll go down,
if we've tea.

1339
01:12:10,818 --> 01:12:11,359
What?

1340
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,609
That is, if we've tea,
we'll feel like vomitting.

1341
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:16,568
No.

1342
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:26,818
Whenever withered crop,
I would shed tears

1343
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:28,609
It's not felt when
'Poet Vallalar' said,

1344
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:31,319
When seeing her weeping,

1345
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,401
I feel how powerful
those words are!

1346
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:34,984
Why do you think
he was dead?

1347
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:37,359
Then, is he playing cards?

1348
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:38,401
I'm not saying so.

1349
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:41,359
He can take rebirth as your son.

1350
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:43,693
That's okay.

1351
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,152
But, when thinking that
we're the reason for his death...

1352
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:49,109
...it's twinning in the heart.

1353
01:12:49,776 --> 01:12:57,483
Shall we ask her for apology
saying we killed her father?

1354
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:00,734
I'm also thinking of that, uncle.

1355
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:01,984
See him!

1356
01:13:01,984 --> 01:13:03,609
It's right of my doubt on him.

1357
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:06,109
Hey, I think he is down.
Give him alcohol.

1358
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:38,193
Whatever, tell us and do.

1359
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:42,651
Okay, leave it.

1360
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:43,401
Let's see...

1361
01:13:47,193 --> 01:13:48,526
Do you want to buy anything?

1362
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:51,693
Do you want anything?

1363
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:53,152
What did you do my dad?

1364
01:13:58,152 --> 01:13:59,401
What did you do my dad?

1365
01:14:04,193 --> 01:14:05,984
He was lying down
holding his chest.

1366
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:08,109
I took him to the hospital.

1367
01:14:09,193 --> 01:14:10,568
On the way...

1368
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:14,943
What did you do my dad?

1369
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:19,984
It was heart attack...

1370
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:22,193
What did you do my dad?
Tell me...

1371
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:26,193
What did you do my dad?
Tell me...

1372
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:31,483
We killed him.

1373
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:34,359
Yes, we killed him.

1374
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:35,483
Forgive us.

1375
01:14:35,483 --> 01:14:36,859
We've done it, unknowingly.

1376
01:14:36,859 --> 01:14:39,319
Forgive us.

1377
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:42,734
You'll get ruined.
You'll never be good in life.

1378
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:44,109
Hey, stop hitting.

1379
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:44,859
Stop it.

1380
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:45,568
I'm telling you stop it.

1381
01:14:46,109 --> 01:14:48,902
I told you not to believe him.

1382
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:49,483
Did you listen to me?

1383
01:14:49,483 --> 01:14:51,818
How dare you've killed him
and staying in his house?

1384
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:54,526
Don't hit me.

1385
01:14:58,359 --> 01:14:59,401
Forgive me.

1386
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:00,193
I've done, unknowingly.

1387
01:15:00,193 --> 01:15:01,234
Who are you?
-I did, unknowingly.

1388
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:02,193
Why are you holding my legs?
-Forgive me.

1389
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:03,319
Leave me.
-I'm sorry, forgive me.

1390
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:06,109
Leave me.
Listen me.

1391
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:08,984
Lift him.

1392
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:10,109
Uncle, get up.

1393
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,109
What's this?
What happened?

1394
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:12,193
What happened?

1395
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:13,193
I had a dream.

1396
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:13,859
What's that dream?

1397
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:16,109
The police are hitting and taking us.

1398
01:15:16,109 --> 01:15:17,818
I told you not to take more.

1399
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,193
Sleeping and screaming before everyone.

1400
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:21,027
Nothing, you may go.

1401
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:25,943
Go... Have a lemon juice
and get fresh.

1402
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:37,776
Brother-in-law, sleep peacefully
without mosquito bites.

1403
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:41,359
He didn't die, just sleeping.

1404
01:15:43,734 --> 01:15:44,651
Fate.

1405
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,818
Ranjani, throw it away.

1406
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:52,152
Anantharaman's funeral procession
will begin in few minutes.

1407
01:15:52,152 --> 01:15:54,568
His family has confirmed
that his body will be cremated...

1408
01:15:54,568 --> 01:15:58,109
...at Besant Nagar cemetery at 4 p.m.

1409
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:00,234
Hey, move away.

1410
01:16:02,027 --> 01:16:06,234
Saravanan, it's telecasted in news channels
as the body will be cremated in few hours.

1411
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:07,609
Only few hours more.

1412
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:10,859
If we booze and
manage for sometime...

1413
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:13,193
...then, no one can do anything.

1414
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,443
Listen, this is ringing.

1415
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:19,401
Hello!

1416
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:21,984
Dude, I've sent you a video.

1417
01:16:22,068 --> 01:16:23,109
Have a look at it.

1418
01:16:23,568 --> 01:16:25,319
I can't hear you.

1419
01:16:25,943 --> 01:16:27,693
I think, you're speaking
next to a generator.

1420
01:16:27,693 --> 01:16:28,818
Move away and speak.

1421
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,609
Hey, my voice is like that.

1422
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:33,526
I've sent you a video.
Watch it.

1423
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:35,109
I'll call you after ten minutes.

1424
01:16:35,568 --> 01:16:37,902
I've never heard a
hoarse voice like this.

1425
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:39,818
He has sent a video.

1426
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:41,401
Was it 'tik tok'?

1427
01:16:47,443 --> 01:16:48,859
Hey! It's our incident.

1428
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:51,359
What's this?
Who shot it?

1429
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:03,068
Oh, no!

1430
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,401
What's this?

1431
01:17:04,483 --> 01:17:05,859
It's shot similar to us.

1432
01:17:15,651 --> 01:17:16,234
Hello!

1433
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:18,984
Dude, you made it perfect.

1434
01:17:19,193 --> 01:17:21,109
Brother, we did by mistake.

1435
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:23,859
But, you should've done
it not known to me.

1436
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:25,943
He is the only humanitarian
in this locality.

1437
01:17:26,152 --> 01:17:27,401
You've killed him too.

1438
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:28,443
It's okay.

1439
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:30,152
If this shouldn't be revealed out,

1440
01:17:30,277 --> 01:17:33,234
I must get ten lakhs rupees
before the funeral begins.

1441
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,152
Else, you know well
what will happen.

1442
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:36,859
Take care.

1443
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:37,609
Brother!

1444
01:17:38,234 --> 01:17:40,359
We dived into the river by mistake.

1445
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:41,734
You should bring us to the shore.

1446
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:44,902
You're like Director Shankar's film
and we're just like short films.

1447
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:47,734
You might've seen thousands
of people on your experience.

1448
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:52,651
For your kind heartedness,
I pray God you should stay healthy.

1449
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:56,193
I like you very much.

1450
01:17:56,401 --> 01:17:58,651
So, it's enough if you give me
five lakh rupees.

1451
01:17:58,943 --> 01:18:00,943
You've reduced the money
by speaking.

1452
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:03,152
Brother, shall I speak
five more minutes?

1453
01:18:03,152 --> 01:18:03,818
Speak.

1454
01:18:03,943 --> 01:18:05,526
But, get ready with the money
and speak.

1455
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:07,734
This is the final amount.

1456
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:09,984
Brother! Hello...

1457
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:13,277
In city, there is sixty cameras.

1458
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:14,483
I'm watching.

1459
01:18:14,483 --> 01:18:16,859
No one can hide and
run away from me.

1460
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:21,027
Brother, we've fixed three
CCTV cameras in the grove, isn't it?

1461
01:18:21,027 --> 01:18:21,359
Yes.

1462
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:23,068
He is the first person
to get caught with a babe.

1463
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:24,734
He is a doctor, asking for the video.

1464
01:18:26,984 --> 01:18:28,776
Come on, dear.

1465
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:30,693
Hey.
-Brother!

1466
01:18:30,776 --> 01:18:33,027
Ensure whether the amount
is right and give him the footage.

1467
01:18:33,027 --> 01:18:33,483
Okay, brother.

1468
01:18:33,984 --> 01:18:34,526
Give it.

1469
01:18:34,526 --> 01:18:36,359
Brother, is this the way to live?

1470
01:18:36,902 --> 01:18:38,776
Hey, if we indulge in hit
and murder case...

1471
01:18:38,776 --> 01:18:39,902
...we'll be shot in encounter.

1472
01:18:39,902 --> 01:18:42,152
If we take up a job,
only assigned as watchman.

1473
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:46,068
Instead, we can take videos
and become VIPs.

1474
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:47,277
Turn and see.

1475
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:50,526
Hey, this side.

1476
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:53,859
Wherever there are secluded places
in the city,

1477
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:55,401
My camera will be fixed there.

1478
01:18:55,526 --> 01:18:58,943
If a gold piece gets struck
in a crane's throat...

1479
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,818
...it should happily swallow it.
Isn't it?

1480
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:04,234
He is asking five lakh rupees.

1481
01:19:04,443 --> 01:19:08,109
I'm living as a nomad,
paying the interest.

1482
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:09,526
You're asking me.

1483
01:19:11,651 --> 01:19:14,152
Dude, I did this murder only
by having alcohol you gave.

1484
01:19:14,152 --> 01:19:15,068
You're looking at me!

1485
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:17,483
My family will be left in perils
if I'm not there.

1486
01:19:18,277 --> 01:19:23,234
I'll get my house document
and solve this issue.

1487
01:19:32,984 --> 01:19:34,568
Hey, wastrel.

1488
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:36,152
Useless guy.

1489
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:38,401
Always busy on the phone.

1490
01:19:38,526 --> 01:19:39,068
Come here.

1491
01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:40,359
Brother, it's 'musically app'.

1492
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,776
Whatever it is.

1493
01:19:42,193 --> 01:19:44,234
Keep this hard disk in the locker.

1494
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:44,734
Go.

1495
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:45,734
Okay, brother.

1496
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:16,651
Blockhead.

1497
01:20:16,943 --> 01:20:17,943
Take it.
-Brother.

1498
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:18,776
Take it.

1499
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:26,693
Wastrel.

1500
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:28,359
Five lakh rupees gone.

1501
01:20:29,902 --> 01:20:31,693
Give this in the shop.
-Okay, brother.

1502
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:33,319
He left...

1503
01:20:33,651 --> 01:20:34,234
Hey!

1504
01:20:35,193 --> 01:20:35,984
Come here.

1505
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:36,609
What, brother?

1506
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:39,234
Where are you going?
-To the Bhai shop.

1507
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,818
Are you going to taste biryani?

1508
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:45,734
I want the full video
in this hard disk.

1509
01:20:45,734 --> 01:20:46,027
Okay, brother.

1510
01:20:46,027 --> 01:20:47,693
Take this hard disk and
get the videos ready.

1511
01:20:47,693 --> 01:20:48,443
Go.
-Okay, brother.

1512
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,401
Go.

1513
01:20:51,609 --> 01:20:52,609
Make it fast, sir.

1514
01:20:52,609 --> 01:20:53,984
Sign here.

1515
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:56,693
Signed.

1516
01:20:57,568 --> 01:20:59,401
Five lakh rupees is here.

1517
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,027
Whether you redeem the
house document or not,

1518
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:02,152
You must pay the interest
every month, perfectly.

1519
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:03,109
I'll make a move, sir.

1520
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:05,152
Wastrel.

1521
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:05,526
Brother.

1522
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:06,234
What are you doing?

1523
01:21:06,234 --> 01:21:08,359
Brother, the hard disk is not working.

1524
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:09,651
He says, we can't get the videos.

1525
01:21:09,651 --> 01:21:12,027
He is a waste guy.

1526
01:21:12,027 --> 01:21:14,068
I know, he'll say like that.

1527
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,984
That's why, I was heating up
the hard disk.

1528
01:21:16,984 --> 01:21:19,027
Even though, he couldn't retrieve
the video.

1529
01:21:19,152 --> 01:21:20,319
What to say?

1530
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:21,359
Tell me.

1531
01:21:21,651 --> 01:21:23,152
He burnt the hard disk.

1532
01:21:23,152 --> 01:21:24,359
What are you saying, brother?

1533
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:26,319
Hey, wastrel.

1534
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:27,319
Senseless idiot.

1535
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:28,859
You don't have brain.

1536
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:31,943
I must be slapped for
giving you the job.

1537
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:34,984
He is not respecting me
as a gangster.

1538
01:21:35,277 --> 01:21:36,319
I must earn a good name from him.
-Can you hear me?

1539
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:36,984
Senseless!

1540
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,902
I shouldn't get scoldings from him.

1541
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:39,984
Speak something,

1542
01:21:39,984 --> 01:21:41,568
I must take the label.

1543
01:21:43,152 --> 01:21:43,734
Speak.

1544
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:46,359
Brother, he gave me a notion.

1545
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,359
What's that?

1546
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,734
If we get the guy's number,
it's easy to take the video.

1547
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:52,609
You'd have told me earlier.

1548
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:53,568
Wait, I'll send you.

1549
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:56,943
Send me.

1550
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:58,734
I've sent it.

1551
01:21:59,776 --> 01:22:02,359
Brother, don't bother about him.

1552
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:04,902
Already, we've sent the video
in 'WhatsApp'.

1553
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:06,943
If we check the sent list,
we can take the video.

1554
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:08,109
Yes.

1555
01:22:10,068 --> 01:22:11,193
It has fallen in the fire.

1556
01:22:12,776 --> 01:22:13,902
Yes.

1557
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:17,401
Brother, only we know the video
is not available.

1558
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:19,152
But, he doesn't know.

1559
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:21,319
Yes.

1560
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:27,734
Blockhead.

1561
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:30,609
Are you given salary
to repeat what I say?

1562
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:33,943
Call him.
-I’m calling him.

1563
01:22:33,943 --> 01:22:34,443
Here it is, brother.

1564
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:47,859
Dude, I'm CCTV Chidambaram speaking.

1565
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:50,609
Hey, you...

1566
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:57,277
Speaking filthy.

1567
01:22:58,483 --> 01:23:01,277
You were speaking good, earlier.

1568
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:02,443
What happened, now?

1569
01:23:02,902 --> 01:23:03,984
Our guy is coming.

1570
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:06,609
If I send a copy to the Commissioner
and the Collector...

1571
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:08,776
...do you know,
what they'll do?.

1572
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,776
They'll spit on you.

1573
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:14,902
Hey, being inebriated,
are you cheating me?

1574
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,319
Hey, you...

1575
01:23:16,526 --> 01:23:19,319
You do, whatever.
But, don't tell me tales.

1576
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:21,027
Okay, finally I'm asking you.

1577
01:23:21,277 --> 01:23:23,609
Will you give me the money or not?

1578
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:24,319
I can't.

1579
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:25,109
Why?

1580
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:28,568
Did you give my number
to any wastrel like you?

1581
01:23:31,693 --> 01:23:32,651
Who did I give you?

1582
01:23:33,568 --> 01:23:34,401
Hey, Chidambaram!

1583
01:23:34,902 --> 01:23:36,443
I'll show, who am I?

1584
01:23:37,027 --> 01:23:40,902
Dude, I'm CCTV Chidambaram's
guy speaking.

1585
01:23:40,984 --> 01:23:42,859
I've arranged the money.

1586
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:46,068
Ask him to reduce the amount.

1587
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,693
He is a wastrel.

1588
01:23:47,776 --> 01:23:50,234
Without me, he is nothing.

1589
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:52,401
I'll reduce the amount for
your sake.

1590
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:54,109
But, you must do a help for me.

1591
01:23:54,152 --> 01:23:55,234
Tell me, brother.
What should I do?

1592
01:23:55,234 --> 01:23:55,943
Tell me, I'll do.

1593
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:57,859
He has sent you a video, isn't it?
-Yes.

1594
01:23:57,859 --> 01:23:59,027
The murder video.

1595
01:24:00,193 --> 01:24:04,109
Will you resend that video
to me for this number.

1596
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:06,109
For what, brother?

1597
01:24:06,193 --> 01:24:08,859
The video we had was deleted.

1598
01:24:08,984 --> 01:24:10,319
Now, it's only with you.

1599
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:10,943
That's why.

1600
01:24:12,526 --> 01:24:13,109
Oh!

1601
01:24:14,568 --> 01:24:15,193
Okay, brother.

1602
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:16,193
I'll send it.

1603
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:17,609
Wastrel!

1604
01:24:18,526 --> 01:24:19,693
Hey...

1605
01:24:21,027 --> 01:24:21,609
Hello!

1606
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:23,859
Hey, wastrel!
Senseless idiot.

1607
01:24:23,943 --> 01:24:24,651
You...

1608
01:24:24,651 --> 01:24:26,319
Idiot.

1609
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,109
I lost five lakh rupees
because of you.

1610
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:29,193
Brother, shall I tell you a message?

1611
01:24:29,193 --> 01:24:29,734
What's that?

1612
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:31,818
My sister is my life!

1613
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,943
She brought me up
and today I'm a don.

1614
01:24:34,943 --> 01:24:37,068
Why are you saying this to me?

1615
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:39,234
She is on phone call.

1616
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,526
Do one thing, recall whatever
you want to scold me.

1617
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:43,483
Scold me, later.

1618
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:45,984
Hey! If I get caught of you...

1619
01:24:46,443 --> 01:24:47,359
Hello, sister!

1620
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:48,526
Tell me.

1621
01:24:53,526 --> 01:24:56,483
Tell Saravanan,
I want to speak to him.

1622
01:24:56,984 --> 01:24:58,068
I'll wait in my room.

1623
01:25:03,818 --> 01:25:06,109
Why is she coming towards us?

1624
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:10,152
Hey, did you drag her, inebriated?
Did you do?

1625
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:13,109
Was it known that
we did the murder?

1626
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:14,902
I must let the dog
to bite your mouth.

1627
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:16,859
Some body will hear it.

1628
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:17,651
Hello!

1629
01:25:18,734 --> 01:25:19,859
Tell me.

1630
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:21,568
Divya called you.

1631
01:25:21,818 --> 01:25:22,984
You go.
I'll come, behind.

1632
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:34,743
Have this money
and take care of everything.

1633
01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:39,029
Hey, you're insulting me.

1634
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,653
After knowing the message
in the morning...

1635
01:25:41,653 --> 01:25:44,650
...I managed to get the money
and looking after all the expenses.

1636
01:25:48,396 --> 01:25:50,436
But, you treat me
as a third person, right?

1637
01:25:54,723 --> 01:25:55,597
Sorry, dear.

1638
01:25:56,179 --> 01:25:57,846
Don't worry.

1639
01:25:57,846 --> 01:26:01,757
I'm here to take care of.

1640
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:04,797
Did I pledge my house document
and gave you the money...

1641
01:26:04,797 --> 01:26:07,044
...for the sake of pleasing her?

1642
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,705
Even your friends are so caring
for my father.

1643
01:26:13,122 --> 01:26:14,453
See, how are they weeping?

1644
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,369
Where?

1645
01:26:15,577 --> 01:26:16,493
Here!

1646
01:26:16,784 --> 01:26:17,700
Come here.

1647
01:26:19,615 --> 01:26:22,985
I'll get you a bottle of poison, ready.

1648
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,818
It's crowded here.

1649
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:27,856
Come, let's go to that room
and cry.

1650
01:26:28,356 --> 01:26:30,270
Give the garland.

1651
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:47,711
Dare to hit my son?

1652
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:52,831
I'll show who the politician is!

1653
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:54,414
Go.

1654
01:26:56,328 --> 01:26:57,785
Brother, we'll kill him here.

1655
01:26:57,909 --> 01:26:59,283
We can look at him, later.

1656
01:26:59,283 --> 01:27:00,157
First, take the car.

1657
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:01,615
My stomach is upset.
Come on.

1658
01:27:03,072 --> 01:27:04,236
The police!

1659
01:27:08,608 --> 01:27:09,607
Good person.

1660
01:27:10,315 --> 01:27:11,605
This shouldn't have happened!

1661
01:27:16,558 --> 01:27:23,301
Oh, no!

1662
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:26,506
Did you call him?
Why did he come here?

1663
01:27:26,506 --> 01:27:28,546
I didn't call. He might've seen
the poster and came.

1664
01:27:28,546 --> 01:27:30,002
Saravanan!

1665
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:32,292
Oh, no!

1666
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,167
Keep quiet.

1667
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:35,829
What did 'Abdul Kalam' say?

1668
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:38,869
’To punish the wrong...'

1669
01:27:38,869 --> 01:27:40,200
Was it said by 'Abdul Kalam'?

1670
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,616
Why did you come here?

1671
01:27:41,616 --> 01:27:42,241
Where is my dad?

1672
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:44,405
He drunk heavily.

1673
01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:46,778
Don't worry about him.

1674
01:27:46,778 --> 01:27:53,521
I've left him to sit with
the watchman, safely.

1675
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:54,770
Where? Which watchman?

1676
01:27:57,475 --> 01:27:58,890
Watchman, sir...

1677
01:28:00,431 --> 01:28:01,513
Will you booze?

1678
01:28:03,553 --> 01:28:04,719
What's your salary?

1679
01:28:06,675 --> 01:28:07,631
What's your salary?

1680
01:28:09,505 --> 01:28:11,086
I asked, how much is your salary?

1681
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:13,209
Rs.80,000.

1682
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:17,622
He is a great owner who paid
hefty to a watchman.

1683
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:20,535
But, you aren't worried
of his demise.

1684
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:24,573
He is a good person.

1685
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:28,944
But, when I went to his house for
the alliance of his daughter,

1686
01:28:29,402 --> 01:28:33,939
He told, it'll happen only if he dies
and sent me out of the house.

1687
01:28:35,604 --> 01:28:36,520
I became enraged.

1688
01:28:37,352 --> 01:28:39,766
What I became?
-Enraged.

1689
01:28:41,972 --> 01:28:47,592
I thought of threatening him with
Vyasarpadi thugs.

1690
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:50,464
But, he said, he'll take care.

1691
01:28:51,089 --> 01:28:52,379
Who?
-Who?

1692
01:28:53,169 --> 01:28:54,044
My son.

1693
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:58,248
My son is very talented.

1694
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:01,453
He'll immolate on the road itself
and clear the case.

1695
01:29:01,535 --> 01:29:03,533
Can anyone act against him?

1696
01:29:04,575 --> 01:29:05,491
Now, what happened?

1697
01:29:06,323 --> 01:29:07,530
He died.

1698
01:29:08,363 --> 01:29:09,570
The way is clear.

1699
01:29:11,443 --> 01:29:13,067
What?
-Who is your son?

1700
01:29:13,566 --> 01:29:16,938
His name is Saravanan.

1701
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,266
The one who looks fair.

1702
01:29:24,139 --> 01:29:25,346
He is there.

1703
01:29:25,346 --> 01:29:26,220
Dude, the police!

1704
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,008
Don't move.

1705
01:29:29,008 --> 01:29:31,215
Instead of police, you said watchman.

1706
01:29:31,215 --> 01:29:34,920
I'll dance for the funeral
and then only leave.

1707
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:37,375
Go away.

1708
01:29:40,372 --> 01:29:41,871
Who is Saravanan among you?

1709
01:29:43,869 --> 01:29:44,868
Myself, sir.

1710
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:47,324
How did he die?

1711
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,405
He got chest pain and fell down.

1712
01:29:49,572 --> 01:29:53,900
He died on the way
to the hospital.

1713
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,149
Where did he fall?

1714
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,272
Only here, sir.
-At the back.

1715
01:30:03,017 --> 01:30:05,264
Don't laugh at the death house.

1716
01:30:05,264 --> 01:30:07,927
Then, can we weep?

1717
01:30:08,094 --> 01:30:12,549
If you don't tell the truth,
I'll make you cry, really.

1718
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:13,298
Come.

1719
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,042
How long to go?

1720
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:22,080
Still 10 to 15 kilometres, sir.

1721
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,164
Why to go so long?

1722
01:30:23,164 --> 01:30:25,077
If you go straight and
take a U-turn, it'll come.

1723
01:30:45,765 --> 01:30:50,469
Hey, if he ask questions, twistedly...

1724
01:30:50,718 --> 01:30:52,259
We must give him
the same answers.

1725
01:30:52,924 --> 01:30:54,506
You've watched 'Papanasam' film,
right?

1726
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:55,754
When did I see?

1727
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:57,213
You left me.

1728
01:30:59,127 --> 01:31:00,292
You shouldn't open the mouth.

1729
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:04,247
Come down.

1730
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:21,313
Was this the place where Anantharaman
fell down with heart attack?

1731
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:22,436
Yes, sir.

1732
01:31:31,386 --> 01:31:37,380
Why did Anantharaman come
to a secluded place?

1733
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,171
You've to ask him only, sir.

1734
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:42,458
That's logic.

1735
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:46,664
When Anantharaman got heart attack,

1736
01:31:46,996 --> 01:31:49,576
How where you here, exactly?

1737
01:31:51,367 --> 01:31:55,030
I can ask this logic to you, right?

1738
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,445
Yes, sir.

1739
01:31:56,569 --> 01:31:58,193
Then, answer me.

1740
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:03,438
My uncle has jaundice.

1741
01:32:03,646 --> 01:32:05,519
So, we came to get
the herbal leaves.

1742
01:32:07,684 --> 01:32:09,473
Uncle has jaundice?

1743
01:32:11,014 --> 01:32:12,013
Do you want me to believe this?

1744
01:32:12,013 --> 01:32:14,010
If you don't believe...

1745
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:16,217
...you can check his urine sample
with boiled rice in coconut shell.

1746
01:32:16,217 --> 01:32:18,006
Shall I bring the rice in coconut shell?

1747
01:32:22,086 --> 01:32:23,127
Come on, dear.

1748
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:29,079
Did I got three stars to see
how he piss?

1749
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:32,158
His mother is out of station, sir.

1750
01:32:45,979 --> 01:32:49,683
I'll make all four of you
to piss, in a while.

1751
01:33:35,804 --> 01:33:40,757
If the one who did this incident
comes forward and accepts...

1752
01:33:40,757 --> 01:33:43,796
...I'll let off the other three guys.

1753
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:49,206
Very good.

1754
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:51,163
Then, are you that A1?
-A1?

1755
01:33:52,829 --> 01:33:55,158
I didn't come forward, sir.

1756
01:33:55,158 --> 01:33:56,367
They only stepped back.

1757
01:34:01,653 --> 01:34:03,068
Can't you hear some sound?

1758
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:04,983
Brother has got stomach upset.

1759
01:34:04,983 --> 01:34:06,148
Will it sound so high?

1760
01:34:06,148 --> 01:34:08,146
It's like the pistol sound.

1761
01:34:08,146 --> 01:34:08,813
Come, let's go and see.

1762
01:34:08,813 --> 01:34:10,894
Are you playing with me?

1763
01:34:10,894 --> 01:34:12,850
I'll count till 10.

1764
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,848
It's good, if you accept the truth
by that time.

1765
01:34:14,848 --> 01:34:15,889
Else...

1766
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:38,199
One...two...three...four...five...
six...seven...eight...nine...ten

1767
01:34:38,574 --> 01:34:40,614
The gun was stuck.

1768
01:34:40,614 --> 01:34:41,571
Hey, no!

1769
01:34:41,571 --> 01:34:42,445
Oh, gosh!

1770
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,027
Hey...Hey...

1771
01:34:44,027 --> 01:34:45,526
You show pocket bullets to me?

1772
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:46,274
Kneel down.

1773
01:34:46,775 --> 01:34:47,524
Kneel down.

1774
01:34:48,731 --> 01:34:50,313
I'll kill you, today.

1775
01:34:56,598 --> 01:35:00,427
You shot me in the toilet.

1776
01:35:01,468 --> 01:35:05,797
Why did Anantharaman come
to your toilet?

1777
01:35:05,797 --> 01:35:07,795
You've to ask him.

1778
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,288
Hey...

1779
01:35:15,288 --> 01:35:16,077
I'm coming.

1780
01:35:17,827 --> 01:35:18,534
Hey...

1781
01:35:20,282 --> 01:35:22,239
Hey...

1782
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:25,860
Oh, no!

1783
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:32,270
Dude, don't do like that.
He is getting tensed.

1784
01:35:36,057 --> 01:35:38,431
Hey...

1785
01:35:57,288 --> 01:35:58,619
Hang him.

1786
01:35:58,619 --> 01:35:59,827
Lock him.

1787
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:01,782
Dude, take that bottle.

1788
01:36:04,572 --> 01:36:06,610
Evidence... Evidence...

1789
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:07,819
No tension.

1790
01:36:15,685 --> 01:36:19,973
He has given money for
my daughter-in- law's marriage.

1791
01:36:22,886 --> 01:36:27,173
He has given money for
eye surgery too.

1792
01:36:29,171 --> 01:36:32,709
He'll give money for
the education too.

1793
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:34,375
Everything has gone.

1794
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:37,415
We've made him frustrated
and locked up.

1795
01:36:37,415 --> 01:36:41,076
If we get caught, he'll break
our neck and give to us.

1796
01:36:41,076 --> 01:36:44,241
Better, we'll go to Jammu and Kashmir
and sell blankets for livelihood...

1797
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:46,072
... rather than being here.

1798
01:36:46,072 --> 01:36:49,402
Why should we get scattered?

1799
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:51,192
Now, his tress is in our hands.

1800
01:36:51,691 --> 01:36:53,315
I wouldn't come anywhere,
without her.

1801
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,885
Hello!

1802
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:08,092
I'm Inspector Jayaraman, speaking.

1803
01:37:08,549 --> 01:37:11,546
Sir, do understand well,
what I'm saying.

1804
01:37:12,545 --> 01:37:15,292
You did a murder and
we've done too.

1805
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:19,289
It's good if either of us
don't reveal it.

1806
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:22,202
That's the deal.

1807
01:37:22,202 --> 01:37:23,368
Is it okay?

1808
01:37:27,904 --> 01:37:30,735
It's clear, you're managing
your best by laughing.

1809
01:37:30,735 --> 01:37:31,777
Straight away, come to the point.

1810
01:37:31,777 --> 01:37:34,273
Hey... Hey...

1811
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:43,056
I'll escape so easily, saying
he shot me due to past enmity...

1812
01:37:43,056 --> 01:37:45,845
...and for my safety
I had to shoot him back.

1813
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,925
Even God cannot save you.

1814
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,548
Only 15 minutes time for you.

1815
01:37:51,548 --> 01:37:53,671
Just 15 minutes left.

1816
01:37:53,796 --> 01:37:55,669
I'll finish you by that time.

1817
01:37:58,956 --> 01:37:59,749
What happened?

1818
01:38:02,579 --> 01:38:03,535
Everything is over.

1819
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:05,992
He will not leave us.

1820
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,699
That's all.

1821
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:10,529
Our life is over.

1822
01:38:11,736 --> 01:38:13,942
My family will be left in perils.

1823
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,105
Don't worry.

1824
01:38:18,563 --> 01:38:21,518
If we're blessed by our deity,
he would definitely save us.

1825
01:38:22,517 --> 01:38:24,724
Why are you staring at the poison?

1826
01:38:24,724 --> 01:38:25,680
Is it to consume and die?

1827
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,430
Keep it.

1828
01:38:26,763 --> 01:38:27,679
Keep it, inside.

1829
01:38:28,884 --> 01:38:30,175
Let's leave from here.

1830
01:38:31,841 --> 01:38:33,423
Wait, where are you going?

1831
01:38:34,714 --> 01:38:36,045
I'll tell Divya and come.

1832
01:38:36,045 --> 01:38:37,210
Don't you've sense?

1833
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:38,875
Come, we'll go.

1834
01:38:42,414 --> 01:38:44,495
I'm telling you to keep it, inside.

1835
01:38:44,495 --> 01:38:44,995
Come on.

1836
01:38:44,995 --> 01:38:46,659
Oh, no! wait.

1837
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:47,825
Oh, no! dude!

1838
01:38:48,366 --> 01:38:51,154
I betrayed you.
- What?

1839
01:38:52,153 --> 01:38:54,277
I didn't expect, this will happen.

1840
01:38:54,818 --> 01:38:55,651
What happened?

1841
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,106
How did I do that?

1842
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:01,270
I'll beat you to death and
make you lay along with him.

1843
01:39:01,851 --> 01:39:02,809
What did you do?

1844
01:39:03,518 --> 01:39:05,724
I went to the medical shop
for taking medicine, in the morning.

1845
01:39:05,724 --> 01:39:06,348
Yes.

1846
01:39:07,430 --> 01:39:09,428
I was inebriated that time.
-Yes.

1847
01:39:10,302 --> 01:39:14,131
I got this anesthesia drug
instead of poison.

1848
01:39:15,547 --> 01:39:16,878
Anesthesia!
- What?

1849
01:39:16,878 --> 01:39:19,459
It's given before surgery.

1850
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:21,957
It'll work for only three hours.

1851
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:26,744
So, he might wake up
in ten minutes.

1852
01:39:30,657 --> 01:39:32,530
Why did you do like this?

1853
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:35,236
You're neither leaving me
to live nor to die.

1854
01:39:34,986 --> 01:39:36,276
Why?

1855
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:41,063
I would've begged him
and got married.

1856
01:39:41,979 --> 01:39:43,685
You've blocked all the ways.

1857
01:39:55,216 --> 01:39:57,964
You've done all deeds
for sake of my love.

1858
01:39:57,964 --> 01:40:00,002
We've thrashed the policeman also.

1859
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,707
Henceforth, everything is done.

1860
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,455
I can't face Divya, ever.

1861
01:40:07,161 --> 01:40:14,446
On festival season,
he'll donate new attires.

1862
01:40:23,436 --> 01:40:28,224
My dear, how can you
leave me and go?

1863
01:40:28,224 --> 01:40:30,679
See, your son is calling you.

1864
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:32,969
Who is she?
- Aathish..

1865
01:40:32,969 --> 01:40:34,967
Aathish, call him.

1866
01:40:35,092 --> 01:40:36,841
Call him as 'dad'.

1867
01:40:36,841 --> 01:40:38,256
Aathish!

1868
01:40:39,213 --> 01:40:41,085
Aathish, see your dad.

1869
01:40:41,085 --> 01:40:42,668
Some thing is happening
in this world.

1870
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:44,000
Aathish, call him.

1871
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,166
Aathish.

1872
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:46,872
See your dad.

1873
01:40:46,872 --> 01:40:48,038
Aathish!

1874
01:40:48,204 --> 01:40:50,993
Your son is calling you.

1875
01:40:50,993 --> 01:40:53,406
I haven't seen this girl.

1876
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:57,361
Who told you to get
anaesthesia drugs?

1877
01:40:57,361 --> 01:40:58,610
Big cheese, he is!

1878
01:40:59,027 --> 01:41:03,148
Leave it. We'll plan some other
day to kill him.

1879
01:41:04,022 --> 01:41:06,185
First, I should kill you.

1880
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,517
Leave him.

1881
01:41:09,682 --> 01:41:13,803
Whatever it is, what to do
those people who are sitting...

1882
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:16,884
...next to him and weeping
without being aware he is alive.

1883
01:41:16,884 --> 01:41:18,216
Leave it.

1884
01:41:18,216 --> 01:41:22,211
Some people have come alive
at the time of their burial.

1885
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:26,374
You can still talk jovially.

1886
01:41:26,374 --> 01:41:27,665
Why are you coming dull?

1887
01:41:29,538 --> 01:41:36,364
Why it happened to uncle?

1888
01:41:42,441 --> 01:41:44,856
Dear, why did you abandoned me?

1889
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:50,850
Dear, why did you abandoned me?

1890
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:53,764
Why did you abandoned me?

1891
01:41:53,764 --> 01:41:55,096
What's this story about?

1892
01:41:55,096 --> 01:41:57,551
Dear!

1893
01:41:57,551 --> 01:41:59,258
See your uncle.

1894
01:41:59,258 --> 01:42:01,380
Dear!

1895
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,546
Your Saroja has come.

1896
01:42:03,546 --> 01:42:05,376
Who is she?

1897
01:42:07,594 --> 01:42:11,840
Only last week, we did
'house warming ceremony'.

1898
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,421
Has he built a new house?

1899
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:19,332
Dear, you said that I'm
the beauteous, in this locale.

1900
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:22,663
You left me saving all the property.

1901
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:25,118
See your uncle.

1902
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:29,739
You told, you'll take me
to the hotel tonight.

1903
01:42:29,739 --> 01:42:31,361
But, you've left alone.

1904
01:42:31,861 --> 01:42:33,109
See granny.

1905
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:36,356
Hey, what he did?

1906
01:42:36,356 --> 01:42:39,770
We're struggling for single bedroom.

1907
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:43,308
But, he has enjoyed his life
with triple bedroom.

1908
01:42:43,308 --> 01:42:46,222
You told to get job for your
brother-in-law in the harbour.

1909
01:42:46,222 --> 01:42:47,513
Did he say only that?

1910
01:42:47,513 --> 01:42:50,009
He told, he'll marry me
to his daughter.

1911
01:42:50,009 --> 01:42:52,799
Yes, he told that too.

1912
01:42:53,923 --> 01:42:55,338
Hey, no...no...

1913
01:42:55,338 --> 01:42:56,588
You've left.

1914
01:42:56,588 --> 01:42:57,794
What did you tell?

1915
01:42:57,794 --> 01:42:59,125
He'll get his daughter
married to me.

1916
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:01,665
Only if you're alive, isn't it?

1917
01:43:06,743 --> 01:43:08,075
What are you doing?

1918
01:43:08,075 --> 01:43:10,115
He is in running away by
smashing the fruit.

1919
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,192
See, how things are working?

1920
01:43:16,192 --> 01:43:17,857
Leave him, he is a lunatic.

1921
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:20,271
Was ten minutes over?

1922
01:43:20,688 --> 01:43:22,102
He didn't get up.

1923
01:43:22,602 --> 01:43:24,475
Is he eating snacks in his dreams?

1924
01:43:24,475 --> 01:43:25,599
His mouth is opened.

1925
01:43:27,597 --> 01:43:28,514
He woke up.

1926
01:43:28,514 --> 01:43:31,427
He'll surely die now.

1927
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,213
Someone give me coffee.

1928
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:42,417
Saroja!

1929
01:43:43,997 --> 01:43:45,122
Shreya!

1930
01:43:45,663 --> 01:43:46,829
What is this?

1931
01:43:46,829 --> 01:43:47,452
Pankajam!

1932
01:43:47,452 --> 01:43:49,409
What's this you've done?
-Did you all joined together?

1933
01:43:49,409 --> 01:43:51,281
Good, come on.

1934
01:43:51,948 --> 01:43:53,571
What the hell are you doing?

1935
01:43:53,571 --> 01:43:54,779
Where to come?

1936
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:56,402
You cheated us.

1937
01:43:56,402 --> 01:43:57,567
How many wives do you've?

1938
01:43:57,567 --> 01:44:00,231
I'll hit you.

1939
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:01,522
You've cheated us.

1940
01:44:01,522 --> 01:44:04,684
You shouldn't be spared.

1941
01:44:04,684 --> 01:44:05,601
You want to leave?

1942
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:07,392
Dare to call Saroja?

1943
01:44:09,222 --> 01:44:11,388
How many times I cooked
dry fish for you?

1944
01:44:11,388 --> 01:44:12,386
What fault I did?

1945
01:44:12,386 --> 01:44:15,800
If we don't do mistakes in life,
then we are gods.

1946
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,129
Those we do mistakes are humans.

1947
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:20,835
You've challenged me intensely,
to prove your father as a bad person.

1948
01:44:20,835 --> 01:44:23,416
But, I gave only a small test
and he got caught.

1949
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,081
See, he has tested him.

1950
01:44:26,747 --> 01:44:27,911
She might do something.

1951
01:44:27,911 --> 01:44:28,910
Divya! Stop.

1952
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:29,785
Leave it, dude.

1953
01:44:29,785 --> 01:44:31,866
She will fresh up and come.

1954
01:44:31,866 --> 01:44:32,699
Hey!

1955
01:44:35,821 --> 01:44:37,152
The movie was over.

1956
01:44:37,152 --> 01:44:39,318
You've got popcorn for us.

1957
01:44:39,318 --> 01:44:41,191
Look there, he hasn't died.

1958
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:41,815
It's enough.

1959
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:42,647
Stop it.

1960
01:44:42,647 --> 01:44:44,645
Uncle, he is very furious!

1961
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:46,310
Anantharaman!

1962
01:44:46,769 --> 01:44:47,476
I've told you, right?

1963
01:44:48,224 --> 01:44:49,930
Someone would die in the upstairs.

1964
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,263
Come on.

1965
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:52,886
Run away.

1966
01:44:55,343 --> 01:44:56,675
Hey, not so serious scene.

1967
01:44:56,675 --> 01:44:57,299
Relax!

1968
01:44:58,590 --> 01:44:59,838
Love!

1969
01:45:00,379 --> 01:45:03,668
Good selection.
-Thank you, sir.

1970
01:45:03,668 --> 01:45:08,996
Brother, you're the real 'A'.
- Thank you, sir.

1971
01:45:08,996 --> 01:45:10,369
He'll shoot again.

1972
01:45:10,369 --> 01:45:11,659
Oh, no!

1973
01:45:11,659 --> 01:45:12,326
Didn't I say?

1974
01:45:18,778 --> 01:45:22,441
At that time, he only
took him to the hospital.

1975
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:24,230
But, he died on the way.

1976
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,146
Not blessed enough!

1977
01:45:25,146 --> 01:45:26,313
Good soul.

1978
01:45:26,313 --> 01:45:27,311
He'll reach heaven.

1979
01:45:27,311 --> 01:45:31,640
At that time, he only
took him to the hospital.

1980
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,430
But, he died on the way.

1981
01:45:36,926 --> 01:45:38,133
Greetings!

1982
01:45:38,924 --> 01:45:41,463
Today, in our programme,

1983
01:45:41,463 --> 01:45:45,168
We're going to watch about a person
who cheated these three women...

1984
01:45:45,168 --> 01:45:46,583
...and ruined their lives.

1985
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:47,915
Excuse me, Madam.

1986
01:45:47,915 --> 01:45:49,205
Can I smoke here?

1987
01:45:49,205 --> 01:45:51,203
Don't talk, sir.

1988
01:45:51,203 --> 01:45:53,493
You've played in all these
women's lives.

1989
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:55,074
This is our family issue.

1990
01:45:55,906 --> 01:45:57,406
You don't interfere in this.

1991
01:45:57,904 --> 01:45:59,570
Oh, dear!

1992
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:00,859
What happened, sir?

1993
01:46:00,859 --> 01:46:02,109
What happened?

1994
01:46:02,109 --> 01:46:03,732
Sir, look at us.

1995
01:46:08,186 --> 01:46:09,602
Is it acting?

1996
01:46:09,602 --> 01:46:13,390
We'll fight today
and stay together, later.

1997
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:14,846
Why did you cheat me?

1998
01:46:16,388 --> 01:46:18,218
You know, he is such a rascal?

1999
01:46:21,298 --> 01:46:23,463
Are you doing like this?

2000
01:46:23,463 --> 01:46:24,586
Chill, baby.

2001
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:27,376
Did I do anything in this world,
not done by anyone?

2002
01:46:27,376 --> 01:46:29,123
She will not accept.

2003
01:46:29,123 --> 01:46:30,206
Leave it.

2004
01:46:30,206 --> 01:46:33,120
He is always like this.

2005
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,368
Why are you quarreling, unwantedly?

2006
01:46:35,368 --> 01:46:36,450
Leave it.

2007
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:38,822
Madam, three people are
in brawl outside.

2008
01:46:38,822 --> 01:46:40,446
Ask him.

2009
01:46:40,446 --> 01:46:41,695
Why are you holding me?

2010
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:43,276
Why are they indulged in brawl?

2011
01:46:43,276 --> 01:46:44,150
I asked them, madam.

2012
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,191
They're saying as your husband.

2013
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:47,481
What? Husband?

2014
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:50,935
Mani, don't go.

2015
01:46:54,681 --> 01:46:55,972
Oh, no!

2016
01:46:56,597 --> 01:46:58,719
Very good!

2017
01:47:33,268 --> 01:47:34,184
Hello!

2018
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:40,510
Sir, you've done the best.

2019
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:46,463
Pity! you shot him dead
in the washroom.

2020
01:47:47,588 --> 01:47:48,752
Who are you?

2021
01:47:48,752 --> 01:47:49,709
Let it be.

2022
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:56,120
Come to the place where I say,
pay five lakh rupees and get the video.

2023
01:48:00,991 --> 01:48:02,197
Hey, Jayaraman!

2024
01:48:02,197 --> 01:48:03,405
Is the money ready?

2025
01:48:03,405 --> 01:48:04,195
It's ready!

2026
01:48:05,069 --> 01:48:05,944
Very good.

2027
01:48:05,944 --> 01:48:09,524
Were four of our guys with cap
are coming in the boat?

2028
01:48:12,063 --> 01:48:13,478
Hey, go that way.

2029
01:48:14,102 --> 01:48:17,806
Hey, only three guys
are wearing the cap.

2030
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:21,428
Hey!
-Boss!

2031
01:48:21,927 --> 01:48:24,425
Why only three of you
are wearing the cap?

2032
01:48:24,425 --> 01:48:26,257
Another one fell in the water.

2033
01:48:26,714 --> 01:48:28,338
That's why covered with a sheet.

2034
01:48:28,338 --> 01:48:29,379
Is it?

2035
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,252
Look, how I'll manage.

2036
01:48:32,043 --> 01:48:33,291
Hey, Jayaraman.

2037
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:36,871
I've cheated you with one cap,
only three will be remaining, then.

2038
01:48:40,076 --> 01:48:41,367
Senseless!

2039
01:48:41,367 --> 01:48:42,948
Hey!

2040
01:48:43,614 --> 01:48:45,029
Enough of laughing.

2041
01:48:45,029 --> 01:48:47,069
Ask your guys to tell the password.

2042
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:49,899
Tell him the password.
-Okay, boss!

2043
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:52,729
Sir, it's Vambu bayanthara.

2044
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,018
Sir...

2045
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:00,223
No!

2046
01:49:00,223 --> 01:49:01,222
That one.

2047
01:49:01,222 --> 01:49:03,511
Sir, I got it.

2048
01:49:05,301 --> 01:49:06,757
Am I right? Through it.

2049
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,670
Hey, start the boat.

2050
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:12,876
Hey!

2051
01:49:13,418 --> 01:49:14,625
Hey, stop.

2052
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:16,457
They're leaving.

2053
01:49:16,457 --> 01:49:18,330
Wait, we'll come.

2054
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:23,532
If I get caught of you,
I'll thrash you.

2055
01:49:23,532 --> 01:49:25,115
Hang up the call, 'Bad word'.

2056
01:49:25,115 --> 01:49:26,821
Hey!

2057
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:29,235
You keep on talking...

2058
01:49:29,235 --> 01:49:30,193
Damn!

2059
01:49:30,193 --> 01:49:31,483
Oh, no!

2060
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:34,979
I forgot to say him the password.

2061
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:37,352
We've got the money.
-Yes!

2062
01:49:37,352 --> 01:49:38,143
Then what?

2063
01:49:38,143 --> 01:49:38,850
Leave it.

2064
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,099
That's right.

2065
01:49:40,099 --> 01:49:41,847
I'm the lord of death to you.

2066
01:49:41,847 --> 01:49:43,180
Sir, pizza.

2067
01:49:43,678 --> 01:49:44,927
Say the password and take it.

2068
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:46,843
Didn't he come?

2069
01:49:46,843 --> 01:49:50,006
He came, gave it and left.

2070
01:49:50,006 --> 01:49:51,005
Hey, you!

2071
01:49:51,005 --> 01:49:51,754
It's the right password.

2072
01:49:51,754 --> 01:49:52,545
Take it.

2073
01:49:54,294 --> 01:49:55,583
Password correct!

2074
01:50:12,443 --> 01:50:14,149
A vehicle is standing, isolated.

2075
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:20,309
Somehow, we must lift and dismantle
the parts and sell for profit.

2076
01:50:25,054 --> 01:50:27,094
Hey!

2077
01:50:28,633 --> 01:50:31,215
Inspector Jayaraman is a strict person.

2078
01:50:32,047 --> 01:50:37,292
I've never told anyone
the reason for my hairloss.

2079
01:50:37,292 --> 01:50:40,622
Once, I asked him whether
he is a big shot?

2080
01:50:40,622 --> 01:50:43,203
He tweaked every strand
of my tress.

2081
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:43,785
Oh, no!

2082
01:50:43,785 --> 01:50:44,868
That's Jayaraman.

2083
01:50:44,868 --> 01:50:46,033
A terrific person!

2084
01:50:46,033 --> 01:50:48,780
But, I made him tremble.

2085
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:49,697
That's what I'm!

2086
01:50:49,697 --> 01:50:52,111
Worst than him.

2087
01:50:52,111 --> 01:50:53,193
Leave it, boss.

2088
01:50:53,193 --> 01:50:55,441
How does he know
our whereabouts?

2089
01:51:03,516 --> 01:51:05,554
He is Jayaraman,
who I mentioned about.

2090
01:51:08,469 --> 01:51:09,718
It's gone!

2091
01:51:11,658 --> 01:51:12,491
Hello!

2092
01:51:14,946 --> 01:51:17,402
I'll close any case
in half an hour.

2093
01:51:18,234 --> 01:51:20,317
How long do you need?

2094
01:51:20,317 --> 01:51:21,440
Two years, sir.

2095
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:23,563
We'll settle by then.

2096
01:51:23,563 --> 01:51:25,311
I just started the construction
of my house too.

2097
01:51:25,311 --> 01:51:26,518
Hey, wastrel...

2098
01:51:27,642 --> 01:51:28,641
Take that bag.

2099
01:51:30,241 --> 01:51:33,364
Sir, take the money
we've grabbed from you.

2100
01:51:37,193 --> 01:51:38,025
You...

2101
01:51:39,316 --> 01:51:41,064
From me...

2102
01:51:42,355 --> 01:51:43,810
This cash!

2103
01:51:46,392 --> 01:51:47,806
Is this you?

2104
01:51:48,805 --> 01:51:50,096
Oh, no!

2105
01:51:50,471 --> 01:51:52,136
I've said by mistake.

2106
01:51:52,136 --> 01:51:54,842
Do I got caught by myself?

2107
01:51:54,842 --> 01:51:58,255
How do you know this place?

2108
01:51:58,255 --> 01:52:01,418
The jeep he has stolen was mine.

2109
01:52:01,418 --> 01:52:04,665
Hey, wastrel...

2110
01:52:04,665 --> 01:52:12,616
Sir, better excuse us.

2111
01:52:19,151 --> 01:52:24,645
Boss, I think we'll me immersed
in pool of blood as he is smiling high.

2112
01:52:24,645 --> 01:52:28,017
Don't panic me.

2113
01:52:28,017 --> 01:52:30,805
Damn! waste of five minutes.

2114
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:32,803
Come on.

2115
01:52:35,843 --> 01:52:38,548
Show him.

2116
01:52:38,548 --> 01:52:39,172
Go...

2117
01:52:54,781 --> 01:52:55,697
Attack!

2118
01:53:11,973 --> 01:53:13,846
Oh, good!

2119
01:53:21,172 --> 01:53:23,295
He is hitting hardly.

2120
01:53:23,295 --> 01:53:24,584
I can't.

2121
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:32,619
He is dancing like Nagini.

2122
01:53:58,884 --> 01:54:03,172
Hey, don't do overacting.

2123
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:06,793
I'll tweak out the brain
just like your tress.

2124
01:54:06,793 --> 01:54:07,792
No, sir!

2125
01:54:07,792 --> 01:54:08,541
Come.

2126
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:11,288
Sir!
