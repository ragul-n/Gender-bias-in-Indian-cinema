1
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,121
Uncle!

2
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,582
Where's dad?

3
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,465
See there!

4
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,863
Uncle!

5
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,367
See there!

6
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:17,354
Hail Goddess Durga!

7
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,977
Take.

8
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,993
Write letters for the
next 12 days. One each day.

9
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,208
What if I don't have
anything to write?

10
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,962
Then write the same.

11
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,464
And what if I forget?

12
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,721
Then you won't be forgiven.

13
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,473
Really?

14
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,102
What'll you do?

15
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,604
Dare to forget, first.

16
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,955
What happened?

17
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,210
Why are you leaving?

18
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,714
I have to attend college.

19
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,841
I've an exam.

20
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,094
I've to clear it.

21
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,348
What's the use?

22
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,850
Meaning?

23
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,733
You're doing all this for a job.

24
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,487
And a job means daily wages.

25
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,990
Yes.
- And daily wages means money.

26
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,368
Yes.

27
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,455
As if you're falling short of money?

28
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,085
Then?

29
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,214
When he was studying in England..

30
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,967
..was Raja Ram Mohan Roy,
short of money?

31
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,848
No.

32
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,979
Do you know?

33
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,482
How intelligent your husband is?

34
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,486
Do you know what the
professors say about me?

35
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,618
As if you can't be
educated without learning English.

36
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,080
Isn't your brother educated?

37
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,340
Yes,, he is. But it's
the same ancient thing.

38
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,849
There's a difference of an
age between me and my brother.

39
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,603
Do you understand?

40
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,484
You didn't understand?

41
00:10:56,114 --> 00:11:01,327
You won't understand.

42
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,724
Yes.

43
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,735
Suppose, I pass the exams.

44
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,488
And get an opportunity to go abroad.

45
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,241
Then I'll have to go.

46
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,205
Will you come with me

47
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:51,461
Why won't l? I'll
accompany you wherever you go.

48
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,466
Tell me.

49
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,101
What if father doesn't agree?

50
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,608
He won't be able to live without me.

51
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,737
Assume that I've convinced father.

52
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,615
Then?

53
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,962
How'll Khokha stay without me?

54
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,716
Khokha will stay.

55
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,593
Will he be able to?

56
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,222
As if there's only one small boy.

57
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,599
Whatever it is.

58
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,491
I won't call you
as 'mother' anymore.

59
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:10,957
You've given me, you've helped me.
You're the light of my path.

60
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:17,213
I won't call you
as 'mother' anymore.

61
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,594
I call out to you repeatedly..

62
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,222
..as mother. Mother!

63
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,351
Have you remained as a mother?

64
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:35,982
You've become my eye, guiding me
through, I call out to you repeatedly..

65
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,362
..as mother! Mother!

66
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,865
Have you remained a mother?

67
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,702
You've become my eye.

68
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,081
Provided me with knowledge.

69
00:13:51,831 --> 00:14:02,842
Mother, listen to
the pleas of your son.

70
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:12,602
Can a son survive if his
mother dies? I won't call you as..

71
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:17,232
..'mother' anymore. You've
given me, you've helped me.

72
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:23,488
You're the light of my path.

73
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,616
I won't call you
as 'mother' anymore.

74
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:40,964
I'll go from house to
house and beg for food.

75
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:50,974
I won't come to take
shelter in your arms.

76
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,102
I won't call you
as 'mother' anymore.

77
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,230
You've given me, you've helped me.

78
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:01,359
You're the guiding light of my path.

79
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:07,115
I won't call you as 'mother'.

80
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:15,206
Mother! Give me something.

81
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,836
Mother!

82
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,864
The load of work
that I've given to you..

83
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,076
..are you unhappy about that, dear?

84
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,084
What else can you do, mother?

85
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,837
This old son..

86
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,465
..can't do anything much for you.

87
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,852
Oh God!

88
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,355
Should I be paying
attention to you all the time?

89
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,360
As if I don't have
anything else to do.

90
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,364
No.

91
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,954
Don't call out to me when
I'm at work. Understood?

92
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,711
Aunt! Aunt!

93
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,215
Won't eat from my hands,
or do anything else.

94
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,614
Close you eyes.

95
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,577
Don't open it.

96
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,362
Open your mouth.

97
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,354
Wait a minute.

98
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,950
Give.

99
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,704
Whom will you give it to?

100
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,205
To the postman.

101
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,332
Give it.

102
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,959
Come back straight, after giving it.

103
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,211
Postman uncle!

104
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:16,216
You don't have to sing anymore.
Go to sleep.

105
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,722
Lie down properly.

106
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,476
Only then will I narrate stories
to you, like every other day.

107
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,603
Now, lie down properly.

108
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,105
What story?

109
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,858
That's a very good story.
You'll like it very much.

110
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,736
Stay there, I'll be back.

111
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,454
Jairam!

112
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,721
Mother! Give me some rest.

113
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,705
Give it.

114
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,583
Does mother appear before you..

115
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,711
..just because you call her name?

116
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,965
Can you tell me how many
people have such a mother?

117
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,600
5 years back.

118
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,605
When I wasn't able to
walk without a stick.

119
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,987
Hadn't mother been there..

120
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,074
..then I wouldn't have been
able to come back to this state.

121
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,830
Do you know what all I did, dear?

122
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:40,086
I couldn't find peace
of mind in this world.

123
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,215
So I thought..

124
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,969
..that going to the
pilgrimage spot in Tarapore would..

125
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,097
..be a good idea.

126
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,976
But that wasn't to happen.

127
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,482
You came into this house.

128
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,861
The house was brightened up.

129
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,949
Then the desire died down.

130
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,829
In this old age..

131
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,707
..when I've got a mother like you..

132
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,462
..she of course is
the Mother Goddess.

133
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,716
She can make the impossible,
possible.

134
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,220
What do you say?

135
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,724
Do you know what I'm afraid of?

136
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:40,105
I'm afraid about your husband.

137
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:45,235
Nowadays, it isn't easy to
handle such a fast paced boy.

138
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,072
You're the only one
who can control him.

139
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:55,328
He listens to whatever you say.

140
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,458
Does he?

141
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,212
Does he write
letters to you regularly?

142
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,218
Or does he miss that too? What?

143
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,847
Does he?

144
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,977
Does he write letters everyday?

145
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,101
What if I had died of shock?

146
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,104
Then it would've been very nice.

147
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,607
It would've been nice?

148
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,485
Then from where would
you listen to stories?

149
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,572
Mother. - And who would've
applied kohl to your eyes?

150
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,076
Mother.

151
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,828
And who would've fed you?

152
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,332
Mother.

153
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:26,086
Then go and sleep with your mother.
Why've you come here?

154
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,838
Tell me a story.

155
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,592
What story?

156
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,598
What story?

157
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,603
The story of a demoness.

158
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:47,482
Which demoness?
There're a lot of demonesses.

159
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,822
The one that savors the flesh..

160
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,575
..of small children.

161
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,083
There was a demoness.

162
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,711
One day she..

163
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,076
Mother!

164
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,713
Mother!

165
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,594
Mother!

166
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:06,444
Why didn't you tell this to
me for so many days, mother?

167
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,075
Father!

168
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:17,205
What are you doing?

169
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:25,964
Prostrate before her, son.

170
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:31,219
I was told through a dream that
she's the incarnation of the Goddess.

171
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:39,227
O Mother Goddess! O
mother of the world!

172
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,440
Bless me!

173
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,478
Mother!

174
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,441
What happened, mother?

175
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:23,326
Mother has entered into a state
of Samadhi (spiritual trance).

176
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,215
Mother!

177
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:03,968
How are you?

178
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,101
Which house is this, sister?

179
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,314
This is your house from today.

180
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,569
Why?

181
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:24,322
Because God has said so.

182
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,827
It's good for you.

183
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,579
A ground floor house. You
don't have to climb any stairs.

184
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,708
They'll worship you
in the morning and..

185
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,585
..the evening, as
you're an incarnation.

186
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,339
Where's Khokha?

187
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:45,343
He must be somewhere.
He doesn't come here.

188
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,347
He's terrified by the
antics of father-in-law.

189
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:54,978
I'm leaving. It's time for
the evening prayers. Ok?

190
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,942
Sister.

191
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,448
What?

192
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,956
Will you write a letter to him?

193
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:20,086
I will. Don't worry.

194
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:45,070
I've committed a mistake, mother.

195
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,947
I've committed a mistake.

196
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:51,451
Forgive me for my mistake.

197
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,704
Forgive me for my sin.

198
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:32,325
Dear brother-in-law.

199
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:36,204
Your wife has been reminded of
you due to an important reason.

200
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:39,958
I'm not writing much in the letter.

201
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,961
You'll be told
everything once you arrive.

202
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,345
So early in the morning?

203
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:55,223
Have you readied
everything for the priest?

204
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,824
If the
daughter-in-law is an incarnation..

205
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:18,079
..then why can't I be a boatman?

206
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,835
Where?

207
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,975
Oh God!

208
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:43,438
Everyone has slept off, today.

209
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:51,321
Why is every one sleeping quietly?

210
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:55,200
Blow the conch and yowl (to make
the 'Ooluk' - wolf like sound).

211
00:42:56,826 --> 00:43:01,331
What happened?

212
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,086
Don't you feel ashamed?

213
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,090
You're my wife.

214
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:13,593
An old man blabbers something,
and you'll listen to him.

215
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:17,597
Don't you have your own thinking?

216
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,082
Won't I listen to my father?

217
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,838
What's the use of
listening to him? Let me know.

218
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:53,717
Is it harming you,
or is it harming me?

219
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:58,972
Khokha is here, or else..

220
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,815
What an act! Incarnation, eh!?

221
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,818
I can't tolerate
this drama, any longer.

222
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:22,954
You're feeling jealous about that?
Here, I'll bow before you.

223
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:35,216
What do you want me to do?

224
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,060
Everything belongs to father.

225
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,814
The property.

226
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,818
His deeds.

227
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,573
His land.

228
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,954
And his money.

229
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,708
What do I have?

230
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,462
I have a wife..

231
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:15,340
..but she doesn't let me near her.

232
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,593
Will I let you? You're
always soaked in alcohol.

233
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:24,849
Alcohol? Not alcohol, dear.
It's an excuse.

234
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:29,187
Get up.

235
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:35,568
Alcohol is just an excuse.

236
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:43,827
What's your name?
- Gayen Ghosh.

237
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:47,580
What Ghosh? Dayaram Ghosh?

238
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,458
Dayaram Ghosh or Gayen Ghosh?

239
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,585
Gayen Ghosh.

240
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:57,340
Cunning! You're cunning!
Your father is cunning.

241
00:45:57,465 --> 00:46:01,219
Your father's father is cunning.

242
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:05,098
Your whole lineage is cunning.

243
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:08,560
Your whole clan is cunning.

244
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:14,315
What are you laughing at?
He's abusing my whole community.

245
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:20,447
Hey you!

246
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,699
How dare you abuse me?

247
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:28,580
Don't get angry. Ask me for a proof.

248
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,459
If I'm not able to give one, then
hit me with a slipper. On my head.

249
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:36,463
Hit my father with a
slipper on his head.

250
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:40,467
Hit my whole clan with a
slipper on their heads.

251
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:52,187
This isn't just a pre-exam training.

252
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:55,190
Exam..

253
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:04,574
That's just a formality.
Ultimately, they've to fail.

254
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,702
So instead of failing without writing
exams, they fail after writing it.

255
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:13,583
You're so serious
about the exam as if..

256
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:20,090
Then tell me what the matter is.

257
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:34,938
What can be your problem,
brother? You're so fortunate.

258
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:41,319
You've completed your B.A.
You'll get a job.

259
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:45,448
It doesn't matter even if you don't
get one, you've ancestral wealth.

260
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,576
You're the one who
has a lot of that.

261
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:52,956
Where do I have?
- You don't?

262
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:57,836
I mean, it won't be there.
- Won't it?

263
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,213
Father will be having it. I won't.

264
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,717
What are you saying?

265
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,722
Total disinheritance.

266
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,937
He has disowned me.

267
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:36,708
Is it anything about a girl?

268
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,087
Where's the girl?
- That isn't there, too?

269
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,846
She's a widow.

270
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:55,185
What's so great about her?

271
00:48:57,562 --> 00:49:02,192
Uma, if you see her..

272
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:10,450
Are you kidding?

273
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,833
Is this what you've known
about me, in all these days?

274
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,468
Ok. See you later.

275
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,808
Are you trying to get rid of me?

276
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,936
Listen. Have you heard me debate?

277
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,189
Will you debate with my father?

278
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:43,817
I'll try to convince him.

279
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:49,072
The arguments
regarding a widow are all here.

280
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:54,327
You just introduce me to him.

281
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:57,956
With whom? Father?

282
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:04,087
Both of them. Won't I meet
the one for whom I'm fighting?

283
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:10,093
Ok!
- Ok? - Yes. Alright.

284
00:50:57,307 --> 00:51:01,561
Hasn't any other letter arrived?
- No, sir.

285
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:05,565
Just one?
- Yes. Just one.

286
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,806
When do you wake up in the morning?

287
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:41,685
I don't know the exact time, sir.

288
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,438
When they wash the roads,
that noise, wakes me up.

289
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:48,817
When you wake up, tomorrow, wake me
up, too. I've to get up and study.

290
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:09,708
Mother!

291
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:33,815
Mother, I've come to you.

292
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:45,326
If you've some pity in your heart,
if you've any powers..

293
00:54:46,202 --> 00:54:50,457
..then cure my sick grandson.

294
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,339
What has happened to him?

295
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:02,719
He's been sick
since the past 8 days.

296
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,557
I did whatever I could.

297
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,063
Today morning, his boy gave away.

298
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,694
That's why I thought that
I should visit her once.

299
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:22,947
She's an incarnation.
All merciful one!

300
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:27,327
If she wishes, then
everything's possible.

301
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:30,955
Come up, Nivaran.

302
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:34,209
Since last night, he hasn't
opened his eyes, even once.

303
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:39,089
He's been lying like this.

304
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:42,967
Everything's
possible for you, mother.

305
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:47,555
I've no one other than him.
Show some mercy.

306
00:55:58,441 --> 00:56:01,319
Don't worry.

307
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:06,574
There's no greater medicine than
the mother's charnamrit (blessing).

308
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:35,455
Open your eyes, dear.

309
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:40,460
I'll be left all alone without you.

310
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,556
Open your eyes, dear.

311
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:06,444
I'll sing your praises
all my life, mother.

312
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:11,700
Cure him. Cure him, mother.

313
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,572
Father!

314
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:42,582
When did you come, dear?

315
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:57,180
Do you know, dear? - What's
the meaning of all this, father?

316
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:06,439
All these years of my penance,
have borne fruits, dear.

317
01:00:06,564 --> 01:00:08,817
The all powerful mother
has come to our..

318
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:12,570
..house in the guise
of a daughter-in-law.

319
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:16,700
What are you saying?

320
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:22,330
What am I saying? Are
you not able to understand?

321
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:27,585
No. - The merciful mother
is your wife.

322
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:35,176
She's the incarnation of
the Goddess. The Goddess!

323
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,929
You've gone mad.
- What did you say?

324
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,308
You've gone mad, father.

325
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:49,065
I've gone mad?

326
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,944
Definitely. You've lost your mind.

327
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:55,447
How did you imagine such
an extraordinary thing?

328
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:01,077
Really.

329
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:11,212
No. Have I lost my mind?

330
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:16,176
I'm mad.. No!

331
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:30,190
Will you listen? Will
you listen to something?

332
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:36,071
When I was of your age..

333
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:39,074
..it was written then..

334
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,953
..Iisten about Raguvansha.

335
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,443
Want to listen to more?

336
01:02:57,819 --> 01:03:00,196
Father, how did you know that
she was the Goddess's incarnation?

337
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:02,824
What evidence did you get?

338
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:06,453
Evidence?

339
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:13,460
Has a dream ever been evidence?

340
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:18,089
Dream? Did you dream?

341
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:26,306
Is all this the
result of your dream?

342
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,312
You're laughing?

343
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:55,085
I've been worshipping
her for the past 48 years.

344
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:02,801
I'm worshipping the
Goddess with such rigor.

345
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:07,681
I haven't left out on
celebrating any of her festivals.

346
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:11,559
You know all this.

347
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,939
It isn't that you don't know about
this. Even then, you're laughing?

348
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:20,318
Whatever you may say,
father. I don't believe you.

349
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:27,325
Am I lying?

350
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,079
You may have dreamt.

351
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:34,708
Since you're saying so, you
must've surely dreamt about it.

352
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:38,962
But Dayamayi is the Goddess.

353
01:04:40,588 --> 01:04:42,549
I can never believe this.

354
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,186
You don't believe in incarnations.

355
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:58,064
Is this what you want to say?

356
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:02,569
Father.

357
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:07,574
In these 3 years, you're not
the only one who has known her..

358
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:12,954
..I've known her, too.

359
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:17,959
I know that she's human.

360
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:24,799
I won't let this ritual take place.

361
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,052
Mother!

362
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:30,305
Father, let me go. You
won't benefit by stopping me.

363
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,307
I won't let this ritual..

364
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:40,315
Mother! Mother, have mercy! Mother!

365
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:05,048
Do you want any other evidence?

366
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,428
A dead boy has come to life.

367
01:06:10,553 --> 01:06:14,808
Is this possible if Dayamayi
isn't the Goddess herself?

368
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:21,189
Uma, go and prostrate before her.

369
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:27,570
Hail the all merciful mother!

370
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,074
O merciful mother!

371
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:11,322
What has happened, sister-in-law?

372
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:15,076
How do I know, brother-in-law?

373
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:21,583
I haven't seen such a thing before.

374
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,426
I didn't understand anything.

375
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,683
I hope that you're
able to see reason.

376
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:42,437
What does brother say?

377
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:49,194
Father started calling her
mother and fell at her feet.

378
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:55,200
And he did the same.
What else can he say?

379
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:01,081
He fell at her feet?

380
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:05,335
Watch the drama of the
ritual in the evening.

381
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,212
Uncle!

382
01:14:15,955 --> 01:14:18,333
Do you believe?

383
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:29,678
Tell me, Daya. Do you believe?
Do you believe that you're not..

384
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:36,685
..human, but the Goddess.
You're an incarnation?

385
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:45,944
Listen, Daya. You don't
have to tell me anything.

386
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,322
I know that you're tired.

387
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:55,078
Just nod your head once, and say no.

388
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:01,668
Do you believe in whatever happened?

389
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:04,796
And that whatever father
is saying, is the truth?

390
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:11,678
Just say no. Just say no, once,
Daya. I don't need anything else.

391
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:24,691
You're afraid, aren't you?
I know that you're afraid.

392
01:15:27,193 --> 01:15:30,071
But I don't believe this.

393
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,949
I know that you don't, too.

394
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:37,954
You were a child, that's why
you couldn't say anything.

395
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:45,920
But, I can't leave you.. Iike this..

396
01:15:57,432 --> 01:15:59,934
We'll elope, Daya.

397
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:09,319
We'll elope now, itself. To Kolkata.

398
01:16:11,696 --> 01:16:13,823
I've made all the arrangements.

399
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:22,082
There won't be any problem.
The boat is waiting.

400
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:27,545
You just have to go by the
riverside road, won't you?

401
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:31,299
C'mon. C'mon, Daya.

402
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:45,081
What happened?

403
01:18:04,684 --> 01:18:10,440
C'mon, Daya. We'll get late.

404
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:13,568
What if I'm the Goddess?

405
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:17,572
What if I'm the Goddess?

406
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:21,576
Have you, too, gone mad, Daya?

407
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:27,332
That boy was cured.

408
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,922
He opened his eyes.

409
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:38,551
So what? So many
people get cured that way.

410
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,184
This isn't right.
What if.. What if..

411
01:18:48,436 --> 01:18:52,691
Had you been a Goddess, then
wouldn't you've known it, yourself?

412
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:57,195
Can you feel any
change within yourself?

413
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,825
Don't you feel that you're human?
Aren't you my wife?

414
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:06,079
Suppose our going away like this..

415
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:11,042
..harms you in some way?

416
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:21,052
Listen, Daya. You're my wife,
I'm your husband.

417
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:29,811
This isn't false. We've
married according to traditions.

418
01:19:31,062 --> 01:19:33,565
These 3 years..

419
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:39,195
Have you forgotten everything, Daya?

420
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:52,292
I won't be able to
live without you, Daya.

421
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,547
Don't you love me?

422
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:01,051
Don't you love me?

423
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:07,307
Listen, Daya.

424
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:12,562
If you weaken now,
then you'll repent later.

425
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:17,317
Then I won't be with you.

426
01:20:19,694 --> 01:20:22,947
C'mon, Daya. If
we go away from here..

427
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:26,701
..then all your worries
will be removed.

428
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,455
C'mon, Daya.

429
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:35,293
No! Don't ask me to come!

430
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:42,300
I'm feeling scared!

431
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:47,931
Don't ask me to come!

432
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:51,559
I'm feeling scared.

433
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:11,705
Don't cry, Daya. Don't cry.

434
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:19,796
Look at me.

435
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:26,678
Don't cry.

436
01:21:44,696 --> 01:21:45,947
C'mon.

437
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:58,543
C'mon. I'll take you back.

438
01:22:16,686 --> 01:22:25,445
'This time, I've
recognized you, mother!'

439
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:37,165
'You're on my lips, O Kali!
You're in my heart, Kali!'

440
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:44,673
'You're in the core
of my soul, mother Kali!'

441
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:20,041
'The one who's the
essence of life..'

442
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:26,548
'..I believe in her
with all my heart.'

443
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:44,816
'l know in my heart, in my soul..'

444
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:57,203
'..your grace, O mother!'

445
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:40,914
'ln a new form, in a
new incarnation..'

446
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:47,170
'..come and see mother Shyama.'

447
01:25:22,163 --> 01:25:34,676
'The personification of mercy,
the river of love.'

448
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:52,944
'The personification of mercy,
the river of love.'

449
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:57,949
'There're no bounds to joy!'

450
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:03,788
'This time, I've
recognized you, mother.'

451
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:15,175
'You're on my lips, O Kali!
You're in my heart, Kali!..

452
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:20,055
'..You're in the core of
my soul, mother Kali!'

453
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:32,288
Are you made of clay?

454
01:29:39,295 --> 01:29:41,423
Are you made of clay?

455
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,434
Then why don't you talk?

456
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,785
Idol!

457
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,793
Daya!
- What happened?

458
01:30:18,793 --> 01:30:21,671
Look at this. This button.

459
01:32:18,913 --> 01:32:20,165
Mother!

460
01:34:58,698 --> 01:35:04,162
Isn't believing a big
question on your part?

461
01:35:04,662 --> 01:35:08,792
As far as I understand, you..

462
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:14,673
..and your wife are
facing a controversy.

463
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:18,677
Whatever the reason is.

464
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:22,931
You've been denied the
general rights of a husband.

465
01:35:24,182 --> 01:35:27,686
Isn't this your actual tragedy?

466
01:35:28,561 --> 01:35:32,691
I was thinking about myself. -
Don't think. Let me do the thinking.

467
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:40,532
317.

468
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:45,036
Does she believe in this?

469
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,791
No.

470
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:55,422
Why will she believe?

471
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:59,801
And how can she? Everything
has been forced upon her.

472
01:36:01,678 --> 01:36:05,932
And he isn't giving any
reason for his actions.

473
01:36:13,064 --> 01:36:16,443
But you? What are you doing?

474
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:22,282
The thing, which you're so
boldly declaring as false.

475
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:26,036
Don't you have the courage to..

476
01:36:26,161 --> 01:36:30,415
..oppose or falsify it?

477
01:36:52,437 --> 01:36:57,692
A young man, at the age of 1 9..

478
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:02,906
..I change my religion.

479
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:07,660
You didn't know my father.

480
01:37:07,911 --> 01:37:13,667
Had you known him, then you would've
known that it wasn't done so easily.

481
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:18,797
He wasn't a superstitious person.

482
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:29,307
But, my thinking wasn't
matching his traditions.

483
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:42,195
Doing something against
tradition means getting injured.

484
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:46,408
This is the rule.
This has to happen.

485
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:52,163
But I wouldn't have found peace,
hadn't I been injured.

486
01:37:52,914 --> 01:37:54,541
Your mind, your wisdom,
your conscience..

487
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:57,669
..if these can't accept
something as the truth..

488
01:37:57,794 --> 01:38:04,050
..then that..

489
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,930
You've to take a decision.

490
01:38:09,055 --> 01:38:12,809
You alone have to make that
decision. That is your test.

491
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:46,426
Come.

492
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,679
Dear!

493
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:53,933
I have a question.
- Tell me.

494
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:03,568
Does master know
that you've sent for me?

495
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:15,914
Dear, if I tell him once..

496
01:39:16,164 --> 01:39:20,168
My son is sick, take care of him.

497
01:39:20,293 --> 01:39:23,922
What's wrong in that?
You've done that before, too.

498
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:28,802
Dear, earlier and now..

499
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:34,182
Now, it's the all
powerful mother, herself.

500
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:37,686
Your Charnamrita(offering) has..

501
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:41,439
..cured me of a
dreaded disease, dear.

502
01:39:42,565 --> 01:39:46,319
If I come there and..

503
01:39:46,444 --> 01:39:50,031
..arrange for medicines..

504
01:39:50,156 --> 01:39:53,410
Dear, if I ask him..

505
01:39:57,914 --> 01:39:59,541
What happened, dear?

506
01:40:02,168 --> 01:40:04,045
What happened?

507
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:09,175
Since the afternoon, not
even a drop of water..

508
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:17,934
I'll attend to him, dear.

509
01:40:43,418 --> 01:40:49,299
Our medicines aren't false,
dear. We're doctors, too.

510
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:55,055
But, I would like to
tell you something, dear.

511
01:40:56,181 --> 01:40:59,184
If possible..

512
01:40:59,309 --> 01:41:02,437
..take him to her once, dear.

513
01:41:02,812 --> 01:41:05,565
There isn't anything wrong in
consuming the mother's offering.

514
01:41:07,442 --> 01:41:12,405
This too has happened
from that, and that, too.

515
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:07,168
Since when?

516
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:15,927
Does father know?

517
01:42:23,685 --> 01:42:26,813
He should know.
- Why?

518
01:42:27,814 --> 01:42:29,816
What are you saying?

519
01:42:30,942 --> 01:42:32,694
Why?

520
01:42:34,779 --> 01:42:36,406
I shall leave.

521
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:40,160
You won't go from here.

522
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:44,039
You don't believe, even now?

523
01:42:44,164 --> 01:42:47,792
Leave me!

524
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,551
Son!

525
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:42,931
Aunt!

526
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:50,290
Mother!

527
01:44:52,667 --> 01:44:55,920
Give Khokha to her.

528
01:45:02,427 --> 01:45:04,804
Khokha is ill, mother.

529
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:17,442
Believing in your mercy,
I've brought him to you.

530
01:45:18,902 --> 01:45:21,029
You know everything, mother.

531
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:24,032
There's nothing that you can't do.

532
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:27,160
Have mercy and cure him, mother.

533
01:45:28,411 --> 01:45:32,290
Taraprasad, you can go.

534
01:45:32,415 --> 01:45:36,169
Go and arrange for Charnamrita
that's to be fed to Khokha.

535
01:45:36,169 --> 01:45:40,298
I'm leaving him with you, mother.

536
01:46:44,904 --> 01:46:47,407
Will you be able to cure him?

537
01:46:53,913 --> 01:46:56,416
Promise me, dear.

538
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:58,918
Are you human or God?

539
01:47:02,297 --> 01:47:04,674
Tell me, dear.

540
01:47:04,799 --> 01:47:08,803
This is about life or death.
You've to answer.

541
01:47:13,683 --> 01:47:19,689
Will you take him away?

542
01:47:24,152 --> 01:47:27,405
I don't believe in you.

543
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:34,662
What can I do? I'm
not able to believe it.

544
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:40,418
I wouldn't have let
them bring to you.

545
01:47:43,546 --> 01:47:47,801
But even in this fever,
he's calling out to you..

546
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:53,807
..not once, but again and again,
'aunt!', 'aunt!'.

547
01:47:56,559 --> 01:48:00,063
I don't know about
the truth and the false..

548
01:48:00,063 --> 01:48:01,314
..but will you be able to cure him?

549
01:48:06,277 --> 01:48:11,032
If you don't return him to me, then
I can't snatch him away from you.

550
01:48:12,909 --> 01:48:16,538
Will you be able to?

551
01:48:21,418 --> 01:48:25,922
Let him be with me tonight.

552
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:39,936
Will you return him, tomorrow?

553
01:48:54,784 --> 01:48:57,037
Don't cry.

554
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:02,417
You're supposed to
be God. Don't cry.

555
01:49:42,415 --> 01:49:44,542
Mother Tara!

556
01:49:46,419 --> 01:49:48,797
Brahma Mahima!

557
01:51:25,185 --> 01:51:29,189
What's this that
has happened, mother?

558
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:37,280
Father!

559
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:43,286
What happened?

560
01:51:46,539 --> 01:51:48,416
He's gone.

561
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:54,673
Mother took him away.

562
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:03,682
My grandson went away.

563
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:06,059
Khokha!

564
01:52:09,938 --> 01:52:14,150
The one who cured so many diseases..

565
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:19,781
..I had handed him over to her.

566
01:52:20,407 --> 01:52:24,160
But she didn't return him.

567
01:52:28,665 --> 01:52:31,042
What wrong had I done, mother?

568
01:52:32,419 --> 01:52:35,422
What for did you punish me, mother?

569
01:52:35,922 --> 01:52:39,050
What for did you punish me?

570
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:42,554
Mistake?

571
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,932
Your chants.

572
01:52:47,434 --> 01:52:52,772
Your wisdom. Your thoughts..

573
01:52:52,772 --> 01:52:55,025
You have killed Khokha, father.

574
01:52:58,778 --> 01:53:01,406
You've killed Khokha.

575
01:53:01,531 --> 01:53:04,784
Did get him treated by a doctor?

576
01:53:10,915 --> 01:53:14,044
I had handed him over
to the mother, herself.

577
01:53:14,669 --> 01:53:19,174
At her mercy, at her holy feet.

578
01:53:19,799 --> 01:53:27,807
You're the one who has killed him.
You're superstition is the reason.

579
01:53:28,558 --> 01:53:30,935
What are you saying, Uma?

580
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:34,773
What are you saying?

581
01:53:35,273 --> 01:53:38,026
Do you want to hear
about your mistakes?

582
01:53:38,651 --> 01:53:40,528
By accusing my wife..

583
01:53:40,528 --> 01:53:42,405
..of Godliness..

584
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:45,033
..you've crushed her heart.

585
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:46,785
Don't say such things, dear!

586
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:52,665
I don't know what
you've achieved from it.

587
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:55,418
But her life is in ruins.

588
01:53:57,545 --> 01:53:59,673
Today, I'll save her.

589
01:54:07,555 --> 01:54:09,683
Uma!

590
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:46,302
Demoness!

591
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,559
The demoness ate my son.

592
01:54:58,023 --> 01:54:59,274
Daya!

593
01:55:29,929 --> 01:55:31,306
You?

594
01:55:34,684 --> 01:55:36,561
Have you come?

595
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:43,526
Daya!

596
01:55:49,657 --> 01:55:54,788
Put this on me.
Dear, put this on me.

597
01:55:56,164 --> 01:55:59,042
C'mon. Hurry up!

598
01:56:00,043 --> 01:56:02,295
I've to go.

599
01:56:02,545 --> 01:56:03,797
Put it on.

600
01:56:04,172 --> 01:56:06,675
Where do you have to go, Daya?

601
01:56:11,429 --> 01:56:12,681
I've to go away.

602
01:56:17,185 --> 01:56:18,436
Else..

603
01:56:22,524 --> 01:56:25,902
..they'll kill me.

604
01:56:32,659 --> 01:56:34,536
Khokha was..

605
01:56:38,915 --> 01:56:40,166
Daya!

606
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:46,047
C'mon!

607
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:51,302
Come soon!
- Where!
