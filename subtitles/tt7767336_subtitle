- Hey Shivers! Where are you off to?
- Come to the junction! There's trouble!

4
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,338
- Do you think Pushpa ran away?
- But she has dengue fever

5
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,108
How will she run when she can't walk?

6
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,746
-With her, you can't say!
- That's true!

7
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,580
- Come on! Let's go look
- Come!

8
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,687
Go home, girl! Let mommy go and take
a look

9
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,586
She ran away once when she had jaundice

10
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,318
She is something!

11
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,893
-Just come down, dad!
-You hellish boy! Go home!

12
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,890
Just lend me the money, dad! I swear
on mom, I'll pay it back!

13
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,932
You pest! Stop making a scene here!

14
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,225
-What's going on?
- Trouble, brother! Big trouble!

15
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,531
Go on to the junction! Big trouble!

16
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,630
- One of them will die today for sure
- Wait boy! I will come too! Wait!

17
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,675
It's looking real bad!

18
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,248
Not even a shrimp is biting

19
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,484
You sure there's bait on it?

20
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,715
- There is
- Hmm

21
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,312
How about... we try the stream
behind Sakuntala Chechi's house?

22
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,649
We'll get bites for sure

23
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,717
- If I go there, my mother will yell
- Just come now! Mother indeed!

24
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:06,524
Y'know, on my way here, I saw
Sakuntala Chechi washing clothes

25
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,733
- So what if she's washing?
- After a wash, there'll be a bath

-Why were you going that way?

Oh! Antappan Cheta!

Antappan Cheta!

38

Oh Shivers! It's you! What is it, son?

39
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,901
I've been looking all over
Arayanthuruthu for you!

00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,665
If you're looking forAntappan, you
should know where to look

41
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,264
Only then you'll find me. Now speak up.
What's going on?

42
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,477
Have you borrowed any money from
Joekuttan of Kochankary?

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,880
- From who?
- Joekuttan? Of Kochankary?

44
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,913
Yes I have borrowed from him also

45
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,006
When your daughter was on her way
home from tuition...

46
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,980
...he locked her up in his photocopy
store

47
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,884
What? My daughter?

48
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,685
Yes, your daughter! He says he won't let
her go till you have paid him in full

49
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,884
ls that so? Then his head is going to
roll in the mud today!

50
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,462
I will commit bloody murder today!

51
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,832
Set the child free, you monster!

52
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,994
Come down here if you are a man!

53
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,868
If you set foot in this soil...

54
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,374
...you will know who Antappy is!

55
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,706
If anything happens to my
child, you...! I'll...

56
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,007
You will do nothing!

57
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,912
Honey! Your mom and dad are right here!
Don't be scared!

58
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,984
Poor child! Straining her neck
like a crane from up there!

Don't cry!

60
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,752
Pay me my money with interest before
you bark, you fool!

61
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,883
-What if I don't you, you *&**?
- Then your child stays here!

62
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,292

later! Let the child go!

00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,416
I knew nothing about this

71
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,077
Besides, you really think Joekuttan
listens to me?

72
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,982
I had gone out for a cup of tea. When I
got back, he had the girl locked up

73
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,492
What could I have done?

74
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,694
I even called up his father

75
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,762
- He is at their estate in Mundakkayam
- Oh no!

76
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,593
And this guy is not answering his calls

77
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,097
He doesn't listen to his dad anyway

78
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,301
He'll stop this only if he gets bashed
up real good

79
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,664
Then come on! Stop me!

80
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,638
There was a fellow from Kizhakkel who
owed him some money

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,799
Last week when his mother was tying
up the cow...

82
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,638
...he locked up both the mother
and the cow!

83
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,678
He let her go only after his entire
money was paid -with interest!

84
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,471
- Come on! Let's go
- Shut up!

85
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,947
- Why are we hanging around here?
- Member!

86
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,984
- Hang on!
- Hmm

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,720

- Move, move!

Anyone who feels dizzy at the sight of
blood, go home!

00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,759
What are you up to, Member?

91
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,658
You! Set my child free, ****!

92
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,696
- Calm down!
-I won't!

If you had a child, you'd know what
this is like, you know!

That Joekuttan has locked up Antappy's
daughter in his shop

100
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,543
Really?

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,356
-Joekuttan of Kochunkary?
-Yes, the same

102
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,790
- ls the Priest around?
- The Priest is taking a Confession

103
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,658
- We'll be there right after
- Make it fast!

104
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,559
Ok

105
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,366
How about we get him to a Prayer
Retreat?

106
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,468
Yes, ok!

107
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,604
Lord! Looks like the numbers attending
Retreats are going up!

108

Antappy! Don't worry!

110
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,382
The Priest has been informed

111
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,081
-We will have a resolution in 5 minutes
- But my girl is still up there!

112
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,489
Who would borrow from upstarts
like him?

113
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,887
You idiot! Didn't I ask you first?

114
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,963
If you had lent me the money, would
all this have happened now?

115
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,662
Move away!

116
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,168
Open this door now!

117
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,461
I said, open the door! Or else
I will break it down!

00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,795
- Here!
- Are you giving it all?

170
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,597
Hove you enjoy <i>m</i>

171
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,069
That's all there is to it! And for this
you put up such a show!

172
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,774
You got the entire village involved

173
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,610
a Happy?
a

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,378
Then come to the Church at night for
Confession before you go home

175
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,049
mum

176
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,279
Life is like a crow sitting
on an electric line

177
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,787
It could get fried any second! And then
you do stuff like this!

178
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,325
- Come to Confession, ok?
- I'll be there

179
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,155
<i>_ AM Vow
Amy? ‘</i>

180
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:51,024
Every Sunday, pay Rs. 1000 back to the
Church

181
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,031
Till this is paid off, if I ever see you
in a toddy shop or bar...

182
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,828
I swear on my mother I won't drink again

183
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,768
I swear on my daughter... and
even you, Father!

184
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,103
Alright everyone go home now. Shows
ovefl

185
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,972
Yay! I told you the Priest would solve
everything!

186
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,976
Come on! Let's head to the
toddy shop

187
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,108
Looks like rain tonight, doesn't
it, Makkali?

188
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,309
- That's for sure!
- There'll be thunder and lightning too

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,126
- Do you think the Priest is asleep?
- No! Lights are on

190
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:25,688
- He might give you a lecture
- What a waste of time!

191
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,132
Joekutta, let your dhothi down

192
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,168
Now let him not get offended by that

193
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,864
- Father?
- Yes?

194
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,906
Joekuttan is here - for Confession

195
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,109
aim
a

196
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,713
He said to come inside

197
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,915
Be sure to repent your actions

198
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,180
- Do you need to Confess too?
- No

199
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,278
The Lord have Mercy!

200
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,156
What's this, Father?

201
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:59,225
There are some Confessions I can't take
when in my holy robes

202
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,422
It's a brand new item!

203
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,432
- Father!
-You...****!

204
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,235
You dared to pull such a cheap trick
on a little girl?

205
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,336
If you lend money to Antappy, get
it back from him!

206
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,844
Don't you dare get the family involved!

207
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,718
Come here! What business <i>is</i> it you do
in the junction anyway?

208
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,721
- Photocopy
- How many did you do this week?

209
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,155
- Nothing this week
- Nothing?

210
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,759
I know you have absolutely no business
happening there

211
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,864
What you do there is drugs, alcohol
and women

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,730
Elsa

213
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,232
Come here, you...!

214
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,031
When I ask you to open the lock, you
throw the key in my face, do you?

215
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,076
Dare to play games with me?

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,339
Once you are out of here, get straight
to thejunction

217
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,882
Take what you need from the store...

218
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,847
...and down the shutters. Today! Got it?

219
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,978
No more of photocopying and money-
lending in Arayanthuruthu. Enough!

220
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,457
At dawn tomorrow, head
to your father's plantation

221
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,254
Understood? Enough of playing around
here. It's my ruling.

222
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,760
Once a month or week, come and meet
your mother. Alright?

223
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,432
Get out!

224
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,470
Come, please

225
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,266
If you don't down the shutters today,

226
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,869
Will you?

227
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,804
If I rule on something in this parish,
it is final!

228
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,013
Or else...!

229
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,513
- Was there someone with him?
- Bobachan

230
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,106
-Who?
- Bobachan

231
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,185
- He's over there
- Come, come

232
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,289
You may leave now. It may rain

233
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,325
Go on then. Go.

234
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,457
Take care!

235
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,586
- What should we do with this nuisance?
- Hey you! Wait!

236
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,161
- Drop him off on your way
- Ok

237
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,894
-What now?
- Nothing at all, Father.

238
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,902
- See you tomorrow
- Sure you can handle tomorrow as well?

239
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,304
Before you came, I was in Confession

240
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,408
Good Lord! He really shook me up!

241
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,836
Where the notes of a melody...

242
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,849
...are scattered playfully
by the wind...

243
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,182
...the harvests are full and goodness
rules; such is my village

244
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,822
Where merry waves slip and slide...

245
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,857
...like a talkative mirror...

246
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,893
...and the water hyacinths bloom; such
is my village

247
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,829
Where treasures found
deep within...

248
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,831
...are safe in the golden vaults of
our hearts...

249
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,460
...we join hands to safeguard them;
such is my village

250
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,635
Where tiny dragon flies wake us
with their flitting and hopping...

251
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,466
...and float around in beauty; such is
this nice village

252
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,040
All around us is a charming lake...

253
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:33,209
...wherein every day...

254
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:37,081
...a moss-coloured sheath of
water plants...

255
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,557
...go round and round

256
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:45,361
Baby bats, in the dark of the
night...

257
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:49,161
...c:ome searching for tender coconut
scraps

258
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,998
And the stealthy black crows...

259
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:57,605
...are chased away with stones by
naughty little boys

260
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,072
For mischievous kids...

261
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:05,379
...its a place lovely to visit!

262
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:09,085
For the tiny crabs that sting
your feet...

263
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,680
...its a place full of fun!

264
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,993
Little ones and elders...

265
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:23,592
...share blisters from rowing
oars...

266
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,399
In tearful moments...

267
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,136
...they stand with you -that's the
kind of hearts we have!

268
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,236
United in vision; we stand as one

269
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,375
With kindness as deep as the lake

270
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,080
Our dreams are one and so is ourjoy...

271
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:47,521
With honesty up to the skies!

272
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,689
We are together in keeping
sadness away...

273
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:57,725
We shield each other with joy, such
is our way

274
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,669
See a festoon of clouds and we long
for thunder...

275
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,507
Quite like a wishful little girl

276
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,615
The rhythms of thunder weave
joy in our hearts...

277
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:15,517
And it has many tales to tell,
my village!

278
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,122
At dawn and at dusk...

279
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:23,593
...the sunlight throws bright
colours around

280
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:27,392
This lake and its tiny, gurgling ripples

281
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:31,368
...echo with the strains of a
boat-song

282
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:35,195
The lofty tops of coconut trees...

283
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:39,642
...look at themselves in the water!

284
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,180
There are calls from the opposite
banks...

285
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,514
And the circling around of nets

286
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:53,581
Mouths full of delicacies... and stomachs
full of drink...

287
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:56,422
Such are the folks in this island,
you'll find

288
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,583
E
E

289
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,748
I like your twisted ideas and shady
business deals

290
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,686
But keep it to the other side of
Venduruthy bridge

291
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,349
Don't bring it to this side

292
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,395
Brother Isaac, please listen to me

293
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,496
I was talking to both of you

294
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,363
I don't need any intermediaries
for this business

295
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,267
Brother! I can make it so this
benefits us both

296
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,099
Listen, son!

297
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:18,768
The reason I made you sit down is not
your whites or your MLA status

298
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,373
That old grandfather of yours?
It's only for his sake!

299
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,483
Who's that now?

300
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,252
Oh! He's here!

301
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,152
-You may leave. Go on!
- Come, let's go

302
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,582
- Uncle!
- Come, quick

303
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,693
- Looks like he duped us
-I don't care

304
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,429
Here comes the Priest-Goon

305
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,464
We just wasted time

306
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,168
Hi! Uncle!

307
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,203
Come here, you!

308
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,897
Here, take this! Where is everyone?

309
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,607
They've gone to the market. They'll
be back at noon

310
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:50,903
- Is it?
- Come on in

311
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,769
Don't you give her any food? She's
grown thinner

312
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,174
She's just growing taller

313
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,440
- Father?
- Yes?

314
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,483
Would you change out of those robes?
I need to talk

315
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,519
You can talk even if I am in my robes

316
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,415
Are you going to abuse me?

317
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:06,253
When you are in your robes, even your
own father has to call you 'Father'

318
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,293
- That you should. Shouldn't you?
- Idiot!

319
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,591
<i>Amy?</i>

320
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,256
Are you a Priest or a goon?

321
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,628
Haven't I told you not to get into
shady stuff?

322
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,433
I swear, dad! Sometimes when people
get out of hand, I advise them

323
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,531
Some of them listen. When they don't
I slap them around, just a bit

324
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,802
That's our system out there and they
like it!

325
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,709
Em
a

326
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,147
Isn't it a sin to use your fists on
those who come to Confess?

327
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,776
What sin? Jesus himself tells
me sometimes...

328
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,787
...to go ahead and rough some guys up.
I give it to them good in my Chambers

329
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:41,416
Look here! if I don't obey the Lord
then that is the sin!

330
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,329
The Priest does as the Lord says,
got it?

331
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,431
- And look who is talking, mom!
- Ok, ok. Stop it

332
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,726
Sherin - do you know how this one
ended up being a Priest?

333
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,836
So you're going to humiliate me now?

334
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,495
He was in 7th grade when his dad came
up with this idea

335
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,232
Wasn't it during summer vacation
of his 6th grade?

336
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,277
That's rig ht! 6th grade summer vacation

337
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,609
That is when dad got him tangled
into this

338
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,238
Will you get me something to eat,
mom?

339
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,749
-Yo, Beard! Come on inside!
- Come on kids! Come

340
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,283
- Walk on
- He is thinking of who to beat up next!

341
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,355
And he is trying to lecture me!

342
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,867
E
Em

343
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:27,497
I have something serious to
tell you, Vinny

344
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,005
- It's to not get into fights, isn't it?
- No!

345
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,344
You get into all the fights you want.
That's not what I'm saying

346
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,646
- What then?
- This... is from a long time ago

347
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,783
From before you were born

348
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,818
From when you were in your mother's
tummy

349
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,920
At that time... your grandpa and
grandma...

350
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,651
...wanted to take a vow... to
make you a Priest

351
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,284
But at that time, I said no!

352
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,430
Why would they decide something
you may not like?

353
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,523
But now... I have a wish

354
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,701
To take a vow that I will make you
a Priest

355
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,973
What do you think, son? Only if
you like the idea

356
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,908
No, dad! I want to be a Policeman.
I want to bash everyone up!

357
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,813
Who said Priests can't bash up people?

358
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,881
a
mm

359
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,584
But I still want to be a Policeman, dad

360
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,589
-Go on, tell him...
-Ok... maybe...

361
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,058
...I think I have an idea

362
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:23,827
First you grow up, finish your
studies...

363
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,625
...go for Police training, grow
big muscles...

364
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:27,722
<i>Eta</i>
a

365
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,428
Then you join the seminary and become
a Priest

366
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,729
<i>- on
m. on</i>

367
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,772
That way, my wish is fulfilled and so is
yours

368
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,600
- Hows that? Nice idea, right?
-Yes. Let's do that

369
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,339
So first you become a Policeman

370
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,415
A Policeman who bashes up the bad guys

371
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,585
You look great, son!

372
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,956
The uniform looks good on you!

373
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,559
For 18 years, I have sat in for
Passing-Out parades

374
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:02,961
Do you know how many officers wore
the uniforms I stitched...

375
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,037
...and turned into super officers?

376
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,339
- <i>Dear Ikka!</i>
<i>- May you do web', son!</i>

377
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,635
<i>Ikka,</i> does this <i>look a</i> bit tight?
Should it be loosened a bit?

378
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,003
What for? It should be like this.
That's what the girls like

379
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,738
Then it's alright

380
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,671
What's it, Jerry?

381
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,480
That Benny of Arakath has been fighting
with your Uncle again

382
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,348
- And?
- Your Uncle is in the hospital

383
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,389
His condition is slightly serious

384
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,061
I'll stick it in his throat for him!

385
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:44,538
- Hey! Benny!
- Aren't you the Kom banel lad?

386
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,578
When did you become a Policeman?

387
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,737
HEM
my

388
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,612
That's when I turned Police for
the first time

389
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,652
After that, many times! Get it?

390
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,586
- Benny! Come on out here!
- Hey you!

391
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,657
- Get out of the way, old man!
- What?

392
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,060
We gave your Uncle what he deserved

393
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,891
And when he is out, we will do it again.
Do you want some too?

394
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,030
What you gave my Uncle, I am here to
shove it down your throat!

395
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:10,091
We are not in the habit of taking back
what we have given away

396
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,038
I said, come out here!

397
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,766
Benny!

398
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,940
You!

399
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:20,809
-You!
- Get him!

400
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,848
Em
E

401
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,563
Josekutty! Smash his head in!

402
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,599
What a ****!

403
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,802
Go and get him! You...!

404
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,675
Get him! Beat him to death!

405
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,075
- Now what, dad?
- Leave the rest to the Officers

406
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,883
Are you done? Huh?

407
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,186
I've been waiting to get you in
this kind of a scene!

408
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,513
Come! Get in!

409
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,523
Now you can take me

410
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,525
And he wants to be a Policeman!

411
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,703
Looks like trouble

412
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,012
What's this, big guy? Do we need to
settle this on the road?

413
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:08,780
Let's talk over a cup of tea at
the Police Station

414
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,056
You mean at your dad's second
wedding?

415
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:15,585
Talk over tea? If you have anything
to say, say it my lawyer here

416
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,824
- You! Come and get in the car here!
- Leave me, man!

417
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,893
While I am still alive...

418
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,162
...you thought you would make it to
the Station with my boy?

419
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:26,761
a
an

420
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:31,801
You - go and change out of that uniform!
That's enough of it!

421
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,147
By the way... you can finish this...

422
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:38,239
...
 will be here. Right here. Ok?

423
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,985
Go the Station and get some more
officers -for help.

424
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,022
And then we will settle. I won't go home
till then

425
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,855
Good Lord!

426
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,967
The next day I took him to the Seminary

427
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,639
if I hadn't put him in robes then, he
would have gotten me on the cross!

428
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,538
Don't laugh! Your husband isn't too
far behind either!

429
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:06,805
That's true! You are a new bride
right now

430
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,177
- So many more stories to tell!
- Ya! Much bigger than this!

431
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,216
If you hear it all, you might
run back home!

432
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,177
And lastly, I have one more thing to say

433
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:18,916
There is an old custom of settling
scores during the Church Festival

434
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,855
- True!
- That can't happen this time

435
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,724
If you have anything to settle, do it
before the Festival

436
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,320
Seniors and women and kids are going to
be at the Festival

437
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,764
If anyone makes any ruckus amid
all that...

438
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,960
...the one hitting, the one getting hit
and the ones watching...

439
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:33,038
...will all get it from me!

440
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:35,106
That will be the Church's contribition.
For free!

441
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,810
Father Ponnezhan has specifically
instructed me...

442
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,275
...about this

443
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,974
So if anyone makes any trouble,
you will have it from me!

444
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,050
{mm}

445
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,709
If it's about eve-teasers, I will take
care of that too!

446
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,755
No, it's not that. This is something
we talked during the last Festival

447
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,323
Once the Festival flag is raised, we
should serve food to all devotees

448
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,393
a
Em

449
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,995
- That's true!
- Ours is not a rich parish

450
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:03,635
Once the flag goes up, there will be
devotees from both sides of the lake

451
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:07,969
Whoever turns up at whatever time,
we should be able to feed them

452
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:11,634
- True!
- We should take up the responsibility

453
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,678
Father -I would be happy to pay
forthat

454
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,313
Great! Write that down!
ForJoy!

455
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,942
Let's make it a decent lunch -
fish curry and everything

456
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:22,212
And if anyone stops at the toddy shop
on the way, they get toddy free

457
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,249
- What?
- Appams and beef curry...

458
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,325
I was just asking how that combination
sounds... just for fun

459
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,361
Appams and Beef curry sponsored
by Joy -write that down

460
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,327
You mean, one of the two, right?

461
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,797
- No, Joy!
- It's already written down!

462
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,994
- Let's have both!
- The curry at the toddy shop is good!

463
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,034
- Father?
- Huh?

464
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:43,641
Even with all this food, some people
can get nasty!

465
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:46,007
- So do you think we should do this?
- Let's do it anyway!

466
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,846
Alright then! Hope everything goes
smooth!

467
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,314
Father! Will our Senior Priest show
up for the Festival?

468
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:54,148
The Holy Father will be here the day
before. Happy?

469
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,188
- Ybs
- Alright then

470
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,189
We are all set. You can get going
now

471
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,225
Get up.

472
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,386
Joy -I shall be coming by your
toddy shop

473
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,895
You can come anytime, Father

474
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,432
See here? The Festival is on the 6th
and 7th

475
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,326
Be around at least then!

476
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,370
- Like I am not, usually?
-You are not!

477
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,039
Why do you always hang around with
your dad, girl?

478
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:16,765
She doesn't have class or anything
right now

479
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:19,740
It helps me get out of some situations
when she is with me

480
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,847
Alright, alright

481
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,277
- See you then
- How's your father?

482
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:26,045
He has started again. Has at least
4 drinks a day

483
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,179
He is feeling better. But the doctor
says his liver is in bad shape

484
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,984
At this rate, he will make it to his
grave before the Festival, I think

485
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,857
- Don't let him hear you!
- What am I to do, Father?

486
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:38,964
- Alright then. Be on your way
- Come, child

487
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:45,234
Father - Bobachan's wife is here with
her brother to see you

488
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,706
- Tell them to come
- Come on

489
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,833
- What is it, Salamma?
- Father...

490
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,006
...ever since you got Joekuttan to shut
shop, Bobachan is jobless

491
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,309
Now he's taken to spending all day
at the toddy shop

492
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:00,452
Why? Do they pay him to sit there?

493
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:02,253
No! Not at all!

494
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,982
Then what's he doing there all day?

495
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:06,024
Brother-in-law says it because he's
upset about being jobless

496
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,788
Maybe he is attending a Prayer Meet to
get over his grief

497
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,793
- Think he needs Confession?
-You do one thing

498
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:13,896
Tell him to come to Church after 7pm

499
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,194
Em
a

500
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,362
Happy or sad, everyone takes it
to the toddy shop!

501
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,733
Salamma -you should be happy he is out
of that twisted Joekuttan's clutches

502
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,504
<i>Nvakkah Cheta - however twisted he
was...</i>

503
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,512
...he was regular with wages

504
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:29,013
<i>- So his problem is joblessness</i>

505
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,173
As long as he works, he leads a
disciplined life, Father

506
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:35,015
-And he would take care of us too -I
said he could work with us, timber-logging

507
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,812
But he said the cold was too much
for him

508
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,284
- Mem ber?
- Yes?

509
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:40,882
Help the guy find a job

510
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,122
Father, for the past 5-6 years, I've
been telling him...

511
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,992
...he could work at my re
atives's
coir factory in Pollachi

512
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,033
He wouldn't listen! And why
would he?

513
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,069
He was too busy making merry
with Joekuttan!

514
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,872
Elks
E

515
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:57,035
Salamma - you tell him to meet this
guy tomorrow

516
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,205
He can leave for Pollachi tomorrow
itself

517
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,803
If you need money, get it from
Kunjoy Chetan

518
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,540
- Just repay what you can on Sundays
- Ok

519
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:05,242
Alright, Father

520
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:08,286
Could you talk to him, Father? He won't
listen to her

521
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,119
You can get going, Eldhose. I will
talk to him

522
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:15,022
We'll get him on track. He will
leave for Pollachi tomorrow...

523
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:17,527
...and he will start work at the mill
the day after. I promise.

524
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,831
- Thank you, Father
- We'll take your leave then, Father

525
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,467
That is one more person helped!

526
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:24,603
Hope you are not just making tall
claims

527
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,495
- You better get him a job
- I swearl will!

528
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:31,536
Didn't I get Eldhose his job at
the tim ber-logging site?

529
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,845
Member, is this guy telling the truth?

530
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:37,006
<i>Oi cuurse, Nkakka“ Che-tan is great
at getting people out of here</i>

531
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:39,384
Out forjobs, I mean!

532
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:42,249
Alright. Go on, then. I will
see you in the evening.

533
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:44,115
0k. Bye.

534
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,625
Come here! Are you going to fix
a transformer at her home?

535
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,519
I know what you are leading up to

536
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,995
I mean, you are shipping her brother
and now her husband off!

537
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:54,097
- Father?
- Yes?

538
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:54,963
- Father?
- Yes?

539
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,002
We need to get things right on this
island

540
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:59,037
-Ya sure, we should
- It's not all that easy

541
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,093
How com e?

542
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,073
Do you know who the usual trouble
makers around here are?

543
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,343
-Who are they?
- I'll tell you

544
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,313
First there is Ponnan, the Fox

545
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,382
Then there is Kolly Porce

546
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,417
...Suniyappan, Pradyugnan...

547
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:16,182
- What's this, the Mahabharata?
- These ones are the troublemakers

548
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,423
- Can you do something, Kunjoy Cheta?
- What?

549
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:22,086
Send each of them over at night
on some pretext

550
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,093
We will get them to Confess in a row

551
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,494
Em
a

552
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,497
- Guess its too late for today?
-Yes, that would be difficult

553
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,125
- Let's start tomorrow then
- Ok

554
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:34,070
And it's not just them, Father. There
are some other things to correct

555
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,476
- Father?
- What?

556
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,680
What is the idiot searching for?

557
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:46,247
I think it's some rotten Dushyantan
trying to get to Sakuntala

558
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:48,876
- What the hell!
- Shall we get him?

559
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:53,453
- He's getting a stone!
- Come on!

560
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:56,551
So he's the one!

561
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:00,896
(humming)
Here comes... at night...

562
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:03,268
...your lover..."

563
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,538
“my love!"
' Hey You!

564
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,573
gum
a

565
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,575
Emil
a

566
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:12,542
Here! Get him!

567
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,012
- Take the towel off!
- Got him, Father!

568
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,050
- Ybu?
- You old man?

569
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:20,084
- It's the Fox!
- Oh no!

570
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,280
- So you are the 'breaker'
-You are something, man!

571
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:26,984
No wonder they call you Ponnappan,
the Fox!

572
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,924
- He's not a mere fox!
- Out here for a drink in the dark?

573
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:32,622
- No
- What then?

574
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:35,428
-Just needed to get some kerosene
-What did you need to light, old man?

575
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:41,302
This woman is trouble! That's why
the Panchayat put a light bulb here

576
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:43,932
This is the 14th one you just broke

577
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:47,467
Go to the Panchayath tomorrow and pay
for all of them

578
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:51,012
But I broke... only four...

579
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,141
- 14! You broke all 14!
- Don't make me come there!

580
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,220
- But it wasn't me, I swear!
- It wasn't you?

581
00:32:56,543 --> 00:33:00,252
You Fox! So this is your cholesterol!

582
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:05,491
Father! I have seen him many times
at night

583
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:08,260
And when I asked him why he was out
walking at night...

584
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,767
...he said it was to prevent cholesterol

585
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:14,528
He said the doctor advised him to!

586
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,732
Anyhow, it's good you are here,
Member

587
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,307
He will pay you for all 14 light bulbs.
Agreed?

588
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,411
I said, agreed?

589
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,778
If you don't I will humiliate you in
public and tell your wife too

590
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,540
I will finish you!

591
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:26,607
- No, don't!
-What?

592
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,152
Don't finish me off!

593
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:30,415
- I'll pay
-Who? Sakuntala?

594
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,591
Hey! No! Not that!

595
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,321
The money for the bulbs..I'll pay

596
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,455
But... I broke only... four...

597
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,532
Stop talking! Go home!

598
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,303
Father! See where he is going again!

599
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,270
Hey you! I said to go to your home!

600
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,739
My house? Oh ya... this is her place!

601
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,168
Em
a

602
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,212
Kunjoy! Come here a second

603
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,710
-I will pay only for 4
- Go home, will you!

604
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,149
- Run! Go! And by the way...
- Ybs?

605
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,651
If you need to light something
urgently...

606
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,690
...take whatever kerosene remains
at home

607
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,758
The lamps don't light up at home
anymore. That's why...

608
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,695
Maybe they are out of oil... poor things

609
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,091
-Where are you coming from?
- The Party office, Father

610
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:19,797
Weren't you guys going to a black flag
march against a Minister tomorrow?

611
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,207
- I guess you had a meeting for that
- No

612
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:25,072
No that's on the 27th. The Minister will
be in Delhi tomorrow

613
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:28,375
If we wave black flags there, they will
probably drape it on us!

614
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,482
- Ok, go on then
- Ok

615
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,684
See you around, Kunjoy.
Good night, Father

616
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,196
Go on, hit send

617
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,694
Hi therel!

618
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,491
V?
_y°u?

619
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,364
-Were you around?
-Where else would I go?

620
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,406
What's up? What happened to
your forehead?

621
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:56,401
A dried coconut frond fell on me

622
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,841
They say coconut trees and coconuts
never fall on people.

623
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:01,436
It's true. I wasn't hurt by a coconut
tree or coconut

624
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,782
Maybe the frond did'nt know

625
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:05,679
- Was it really a frond?
- I swear!

626
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:07,786
Hit the right spot! My head almost
shattered!

627
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,589
- Let me sit down
- Go ahead

628
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,421
(whispers)
Call Lijo

629
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,497
- Me?
- No. Lijo

630
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,534
Hey! She's calling you

631
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:25,137
-Come here! -Go on
-Just come

632
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:27,763
- Oh no! I am done for! -Want me to come?
- No! Go jump in the lake!

633
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,603
Go on. Go on. Go and get
what she gives

634
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,471
What's that? A poster on your
forehead?

635
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,512
- Great!
- Could you move?

636
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,850
- Didn't you see my message?
- What message?

637
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:42,349
- You won't see anything urgent
-What is it? Just tell me

638
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:46,289
Next Sunday a prospective groom is
coming to meet me

639
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,360
Let him come. Why does it matter?

640
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:56,532
0k, let him come. And maybe I'll
get married to him too

641
00:35:56,623 --> 00:36:00,366
Do that and I'll sink the boat you are
on to the bottom of the lake

642
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:04,705
Go ahead! Everyone in these pans swim
like ducks in water

643
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:07,368
- We'll just swim to safety!
- Like hell you will!

644
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,713
I'll somehow get the idiot's number

645
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,647
You have to stop him coming home

646
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,913
Let him come and meet you! We
will have some fun with it!

647
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,421
EU
E

648
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:21,391
What if I like what I see? That would
make me a cheat!

649
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:32,428
Like ripples of moonlight on water...

650
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:36,498
The blue waterlillies bloom

651
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:41,403
The changing but unchanging
light...

652
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:43,709
u-playfully swings...

653
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:48,582
...on the branches of the night

654
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:57,462
When the first rays of the sun...

655
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,589
...strike the eyes...

656
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:03,532
...it's your face I see

657
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:06,234
In the gentle murmer...

658
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,398
...of the waves...

659
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:12,604
...it's your voice I hear

660
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:16,304
Upon the tiny white flowers that dot
the fields...

661
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:20,613
...tiny dewdrops slip and splash...

662
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:26,352
...they take on colours no one can see

663
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:35,367
...and in the arms of the wind,
dance light

664
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:42,404
Whether you are far or near

665
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:46,808
I will always be your shadow!

666
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,773
When the first rays of the sun...

667
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,908
...strike the eyes...

668
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:55,384
...its your face I see

669
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,748
In the gentle murmer...

670
00:37:57,811 --> 00:38:00,621
...of the waves...

671
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:04,025
...its your voice I hear

672
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,399
Like little fishes flitting in
the water...

673
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:45,334
...my eyes search for you

674
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:49,901
Like lightning flashes at night...

675
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:54,012
...you appear in my mind

676
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:58,745
Like little fishes flitting in
the water...

677
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:02,786
...my eyes search for you

678
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:07,526
Like lightning flashes in the night...

679
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:11,790
...you appear in my mind

680
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:16,996
Let's make a little palm leaf nest...

681
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:21,062
...if only you come away with me

682
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:25,338
Let's go to the shade of the big
flower tree...

683
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:29,142
...and swing on a rainbow

684
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,714
And from the great blue lake of
the sky...

685
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:37,847
...let's pick flowers

686
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,524
" Lijo?
_ Yes?

687
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:46,798
Are there snakes in here?

688
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:50,594
Stop it, will you? I am going mad and
you are thinking of snakes and ladders!

689
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:53,071
Why are you getting so worked up?

690
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,375
Could you maybe keep quiet
for a bit?

691
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,543
What's going on here? Go home!
Go!

692
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,813
Aren't you scared at all?

693
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,449
- When do you have to go?
- In the evening

694
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,379
- Drink! You've run a lot today!
-Will I need to run from here too?

695
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,045
- Hi! Had tea?
-I can't drink!

696
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,520
Give it to him!

697
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,022
- Is that the Priest's bike I hear?
- Oh no!

698
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:15,494
There! The bash-up train is here!

699
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,898
What son of a father are you?

700
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:31,609
If your son wants to marry that girl,
you, the father should talk to her folks

701
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:35,044
a
{Emma

702
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,177
- Why are you guessing?
- Father?

703
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:39,217
We thought we would stand by
the kids' wishes

704
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:42,153
Some guy came to meet her yesterday
and her folks are set on that

705
00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:44,222
- That's why she ran away
- Did I ask for your opinion?

706
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,751
You have two daughters. What would you
say if they ran away?

707
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:49,886
Does your father know about your
involvement with this guy?

708
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,556
E
EM

709
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:53,893
...that he agreed to the other
proposal, you fool?

710
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:55,934
- Did he mean to hurt you deliberately?
- No

711
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,070
Do your folks know about your running
away?

712
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,065
El
Ea

713
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:04,607
Father - it isn't as bad as you think.
My dad will resolve it

714
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,507
-I know my dad
- Shut your mouth, girl!

715
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,011
- Father... do something... please
- Don't you dare talk!

716
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:11,083
Go home, girl!

717
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,690
Whoever helped her run away from
home...

718
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,725
...you will take her home. Now!

719
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,462
You were the one who brought her.
You should go with her

720
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:27,163
You! Call me on the land phone when you
get home! Now go!

721
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:31,929
If the kids do something foolish, you
should show them the rig ht way!

722
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,733
Not cheer them on!

723
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,774
There is a girl here too

724
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,034
You fools usually come running to
me for every little thing!

725
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,180
Why the secrecy this time round?

726
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:45,115
- We thought you wouldn't agree
- I wouldn't!

727
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,519
As long as I am the Vicar of
Arayanthuruthu...

728
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,654
...you will need my permission for
certain things

729
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:53,657
This Sunday, you need to go to her house
and talk to her dad

730
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,727
- As is the custom. Understood?
- Ok

731
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,564
If they don't agree, come over to
the Church and I will take care of it

732
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,566
Alright, Father

733
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,562
If you dare overstep again, Lijo, you
won't get to marry her!

734
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,569
I have dealt with worse than this!

735
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:10,505
- Are your classes over?
- No

736
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,544
Then have your lunch and head back
to the hostel

737
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,713
I will take care of things here

738
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,611
Don't let me see you here again till
the engagement

739
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,911
Don't set foot on the island again
before that

740
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,580
I won't, but Father...

741
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:24,155
<i>mum</i>
a

742
00:42:24,278 --> 00:42:27,191
- Have some tea, Father
- Pour it down your husband's head!

743
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:29,887
And some down his brother's head too!
Idiots!

744
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:33,692
Why'd you do all this? When the Priest
is pissed off, he goes crazy!

745
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,805
Don't make us come again!

746
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:45,539
-I think it worked, right?
-You did good, Father

747
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:49,237
If you had gone on a bit longer, the
poor guy may have wet his pants!

748
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,241
<i>Kurfgoy Cheta - how was my performance?</i>

749
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:53,876
Alright. But you could have done better

750
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,952
- Really? 0k then. There is one more
scene to enact later. -Where?

751
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:59,183
- The toddy shop
- Oh! That's a great place for it!

752
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,259
- I'll step it up a bit there
- Right

753
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,700
- Hey! Shivers!
- Oh no!

754
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,667
Can't I have a drink in peace?

755
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:14,035
Someone seems to have messed
up his hand

756
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:20,208
There was nothing wrong with your hand
this morning

757
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,247
What to do, Father? I was waving down
an autoricksaw

758
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,681
The idiot crashed into my hand and says
he couldn't brake on time

759
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,718
- Why didn't you put your face there too?
- That's right!

760
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,684
Maybe you should do that!

761
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,017
-Come. Eat, Bijukutta!
-Are you two married or something?

762
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:32,614
- My dog wouldn't marry him!
-Jinka! What fish did you get today?

763
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,660
- A snake-head, Father
- And you have dried beef here?

764
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:36,695
Yes, we do. Also catfish...

765
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,855
mcobia...
- Have some fresh toddy?

766
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:42,196
Yes. Also, beef. Sabu - give some to
Father

767
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:45,735
- For me too
- It's good

768
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:46,837
Can I pack some for you?

769
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,237
-Where is the toddy barrel?
- Over there

770
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,234
Get a parcel - for the Sexton to taste

771
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,278
-We are done for!
- Come here!

772
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,347
lam coming! He's going to kill me!

773
00:43:57,704 --> 00:43:59,684
Alright! Open up!

774
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,721
It's all original, Father

775
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,390
Jinga, there was no delivery to your
shop today

776
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:08,627
- Then how come you have so much toddy?
- It's all original, Father

777
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:10,195
There's only one toddy tapper here

778
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,958
If he taps non-stop from every tree in
theland...

779
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:14,225
...there's still no way this
barrel would be full!

780
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,268
- Praise be to Jesus
- Ok

781
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:19,169
How many times have I said not to bring
the child to the toddy shop?

782
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,706
- She is just keeping me company
- Cling-on!

783
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,933
How many times have I said not to
mix your own toddy?

784
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:26,739
Lord! What! My own mix?

785
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:30,107
Jinga! How many times have Father and I
said not to mix your own toddy?

786
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:32,183
- But boss... I...
- Throw it out!

787
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,845
- Upturn the barrel! - 0k. I will!
- Go! - Come with me!

788
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,757
They don't even have the knowledge
to mix

789
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,156
If they get something wrong and someone
dies or goes blind...

790
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,695
WSW

791
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,764
Eli! [imam]
m

792
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:47,966
- Overturn it!
- Go on, Jinka! Just turn it to the side

793
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,659
This was my best mix ever!

794
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,738
The villagers didn't have the good
fortune to taste it!

795
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:54,736
- That's money flowing out there!
- Hey Joy! Come here!

796
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:56,705
Come on, child! Father!

797
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:58,777
If you mix again, I will have this
shut down!

798
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,346
E
Em

799
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,373
I will keep dropping in

800
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:05,417
You should come everyday! I mean it!

801
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:12,215
- Indayi! How about a Confession?
- Really?

802
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,025
(humming)

803
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,100
Get me a...

804
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:25,498
(muttering)
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

805
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:27,706
I came to get a take-away curry, Father

806
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:30,037
- Ok
- It's true

807
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,177
Guess he believed it

808
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,738
Em
m

809
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,791
I'll buy you another - later

810
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:51,363
-Come on, girl... get out of the husk!
- Father, what about the thief?

811
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:53,830
We need to find a solution

812
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:55,798
This has become a huge headache

813
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:58,166
At this rate, he will make off with the
whole village!

814
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,995
Father -my back is killing me

815
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:02,503
These coconuts are useless

816
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,175
- How about I come back in the morning?
- Don't speak, you fool!

817
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:07,439
- I will speak
- Not till you are done dehusking!

818
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:09,481
Or else it will be you that I dehusk

819
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:13,114
mm
a

820
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,844
I can make arrangements for you to potty
here

821
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,411
- That is to make me shit the truth
- How many people did you swear on?

822
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:19,354
- That you wouldn't drink again?
- It's your head, nof mine at stake

823
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,016
What were we talking about?

824
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:24,824
I am sure of 1 thing, Father. The guy
who got into all 4 places...

825
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:26,865
- ...is someone from these parts
- True!

826
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:30,401
For someone outside of the island,
it will be difficult to steal from here

827
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:33,436
Father, the thief got Lazar's kid's
necklace and bangles...

828
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:36,338
...and his mother's antique earrings
rig ht off her ears!

829
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:40,276
And because he couldn't get them off
he ripped her ears to get them!

830
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,074
_ Ream’?
_Yes!

831
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:44,082
And about our two policemen,
its useless to even talk of them!

832
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,084
True! The thief is a better bet
than them!

833
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,051
- We should find him and stop him
- Ybs

834
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:50,054
But who could it be, Kunjoy Cheta?

835
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,090
We are up and about most nights

836
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,316
Other than Ponnappan, the Fox, hanging
around Sakunta
a's house...

837
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,919
- ...we don't see anyone else about
- That's what I have been saying

838
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,363
That the thief is someone who knows
this place really well

839
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,401
- We shall see you tomorrow, Father
- Ok

840
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,097
He took off with 3 and a half sovereigns
of my wife's gold

841
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:08,264
If the thief ever strikes again, it will
be the end of me!

842
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,441
Praise be to the Lord. See you,
Kunjoy Cheta.

843
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,239
Alright. And Father, what do we do
about this soul?

844
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:17,105
If you're done feeding the fish, go
to sleep, Father

845
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:20,918
He's been at it every day for months now

846
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,578
Haven't snared even a baby fish yet,
have yo u?

847
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:24,884
They're biting, Father. I am just unable
to reel them in

848
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:27,391
Then don't reel. Why not dive in and
get them?

849
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:33,264
- Antappy
- Can I go potty, Father?

850
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,864
Put all of the coconuts back in the
store before you leave

851
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,832
There is a thief around

852
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:40,497
Looks like he won't rest till he
sees me dead

853
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:56,585
For God's sakes, dad! Remember you
have barely half a liver

854
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:58,857
I am always thirsty, son

855
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,121
Drink a little less and you can live
a little more

856
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,558
Or else the Lord will call you back
before the next rains

857
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:04,596
What on earth are you talking about?

858
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:08,592
The doctor says, have a drink or two
right after the tablets

859
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,930
Or they don't work well in my body

860
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,005
And you sure get them to work

861
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,110
- Come, join us, daughter
- She won't, mother

862
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:19,936
She's been fuming like this
all day

863
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,445
And she won't say what it is

864
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:23,482
-What is it, child?
- It's nothing, father

865
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,144
-Want another piece of fish, honey?
- Pour me one more, son

866
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,523
If you won't listen, do whatever
you wish!

867
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:35,594
The thirst just wont go away!

868
00:48:50,064 --> 00:48:52,340
For God's sake, Lissie - if you have
something to say, just say it!

869
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:54,413
You don't know what the matter is?

870
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,441
How would I?

871
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:58,483
Joy - don't play the fool!

872
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,919
What the hell are you talking about?

873
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:04,656
Why did you pay 35,000 rupees into
Leena's account?

874
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,286
You swore you wouldn't have anything
more to do with her

875
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:14,094
Speak softly! My dad's liver is damaged,
not his ears!

876
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,603
Anyway, who tells you these lies?

877
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:20,238
- Need proof?
- Yes. Bring proof. Then we'll talk

878
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:28,013
Here! Will this do?

879
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,576
Listen, it was her father who asked
to borrow some money

880
00:49:58,632 --> 00:50:01,545
- And I just paid into her account
- Don't start lying, Joy

881
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:05,011
I know how many women on this island
you are involved with

882
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:07,047
What are you talking about, Lissie?

883
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,087
Do you need proof for that as well?

884
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,619
- Lissie...
- Hands off!

885
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:33,506
(Humming) "How can we fulfill
our wishes if we are apart?"

886
00:50:34,435 --> 00:50:36,415
(humming continues)

887
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:44,288
(muttering)
I could fulfill those desires!

888
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,527
(humming continues)

889
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:25,525
God! These dogs and their howling!

890
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,862
They'll kill the mood!

891
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,136
Bloody strays!

892
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,141
(humming)
"When the blue-pea blossoms...

893
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,303
...
 think of you, Shakuntala..."

894
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,514
- Sweetheart!
- Oh!

895
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:49,719
Father!

896
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:51,815
Father!

897
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,387
Father! It's Kunjoy! Open the
door quick!

898
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,557
Father!

899
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,701
ls your phone on silent mode? I have
been calling for so long!

900
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,238
-What's up? -You know
Kattuthura Joy's wife, Lissie?

901
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:09,130
She consumed poison!

902
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,176
Yes! By the time they got to the
hospital, she was gone

903
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:13,642
- Oh Jesus!
- It's true - I just got the call

904
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:18,417
What a tragedy!

905
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,452
What gets into these women's heads?

906
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,878
Today you are...

907
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:56,716
...a gently melody that...

908
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,815
...makes my heart throb in pain

909
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:05,227
Far, far away...

910
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:07,765
...into what distant horizon...

911
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:12,166
...have you faded away?

912
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,433
Like a cloud...

913
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:18,670
...dispelling itself into rain...

914
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:20,768
...have you...

915
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:24,338
...gone far away?

916
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:27,280
Like a feather...

917
00:53:27,341 --> 00:53:29,912
...soft
y, have you...

918
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:34,390
...drifted away, my love?

919
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:38,429
Without you...

920
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:41,193
...my whole inner being...

921
00:53:41,255 --> 00:53:45,601
...has fallen silent

922
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,402
Today, you are...

923
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:52,273
...a gentle melody that...

924
00:53:52,366 --> 00:53:57,372
...makes my heart throb in pain

925
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:55,737
On this day, in this hearth...

926
00:54:55,863 --> 00:55:01,313
...
 am alone, without you...

927
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:06,748
Like moonlight, like a flower of
the night...

928
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:12,515
...are you gently fading?

929
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:17,892
Like a painful memory...

930
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:23,331
...right next to my ear...

931
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:29,066
...it's just you

932
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:35,774
It's... just... you

933
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:46,948
Today, you are...

934
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,858
...a gentle melody that...

935
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:54,694
...makes my heart throb in pain

936
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,109
We agree to it, Father

937
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,443
So now both your families can sit down
and decide the rest

938
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:13,576
That's up to you! Also what gifts you
want to give them at the wedding

939
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,348
- There should be no ill-will over that
- There won't be, Father

940
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,583
Good for you! Just don't force
me to step in!

941
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:20,625
a
Em

942
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:26,660
I'll take your leave now

943
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,733
- Thank you
- Hmm

944
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:34,638
Like the Priest said, let's set a date
for after the Festival

945
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:37,834
- Sure!
- What are doing, Suniyappa?

946
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:40,537
Father -this flex was gathering dust
at thejunction

947
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,011
ME
[mm

948
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,679
But my wife was feeling shy...

949
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:47,649
...to bathe with him looking on!

950
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,688
- Shy?
- Sol decided to turn it around

951
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,790
That's a good move. Hey you two!

952
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:54,756
Go find some work! Instead of loitering
around with that stick!

953
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:56,759
- Morons!
- 0k, Father

954
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:58,831
As if we are crazy! Here, hold this

955
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,600
Hold it

956
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:04,169
Hey! Do you hear someone washing?

957
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:07,198
- Who could be washing at this hour?
- Come on!

958
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:09,474
At this time, it must be Rani Chechi,
for sure!

959
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:14,007
That fox keeps hanging around
Shakunta
a's house...

960
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,444
...because he is so narrow-minded

961
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,879
We are the only decent ones around

962
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,518
You are not too bad yourself

963
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:22,554
- Who's there?
- Where are you guys coming from?

964
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:25,585
a
Ea

965
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:27,417
- Which movie?
- Pulimurugan

966
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:30,155
- Really? Was Lalettan good?
-Superb! -And?

967
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,997
- Good fights?
- Couple of smashing fights, Father!

968
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,033
And Lalettan does this thing
where he jabs the tummy...

969
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:37,465
- and beats people to pulp!
- Oh! I need to see it!

970
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:39,128
You certainly should!

971
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:41,638
And in that movie, the villain
is a Priest

972
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:44,470
And Lalettan punches him and throws him
into a river

973
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,169
We could make that the Churchyard...

974
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:48,110
Elm

975
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,148
No, Father. We didn't mean that

976
00:57:50,237 --> 00:57:52,217
- Ok. Go home now.
- Ok

977
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,112
-And by the way...
- There he calls again

978
00:57:54,174 --> 00:57:56,017
Don't loiter around here. Go home!

979
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:58,056
We will, Father. Why don't you go
home too?

980
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,661
Someone's there again!

981
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,797
Bloody... fox...

982
00:58:06,186 --> 00:58:08,166
...and his bloody electric... games...
at night!

983
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:11,668
I'll have his blood today!

984
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:14,796
(The 'fox' humming)
"Aren't you coming yet...

985
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:17,531
Lying old man! There he is - right at
the doorstep!

986
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,578
(humming continues)

987
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:23,773
Hey! Who's that? Shining a light
into my face?

988
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,817
I should be breaking your head instead!
Come here!

989
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:28,787
-Was it you, Father?
- Don't you ever sleep, old man?

990
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,547
-I was just taking a piss, Father
-Are there no bathrooms inside?

991
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:35,150
You know, standing outside...
enjoying the breeze...

992
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:36,751
...it's just a better feeling

993
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:39,058
Does your piss need the breeze to cool
it before it comes out?

994
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,859
It's just a habit from childhood

995
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:44,493
- It's difficult to change
- Weren't you at Sakunta
a's house?

996
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:46,569
What? Me?

997
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,607
- The light is broken again
- What?

998
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:51,643
- It wasn't me!
- You fox! I've caught you red-handed!

999
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,776
And I've never seen anyone else do it

1000
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,814
You better go to the Panchayat
tomorrow and pay for it

1001
00:58:55,936 --> 00:58:57,916
And get them to fix it!

1002
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:00,949
My dear Father! I swear on the Goddess,
it wasn't me!

1003
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:03,679
Say nothing more! Want me to talk
to your wife?

1004
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,724
- Lalithamma?
- Oh no! Don't!

1005
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:08,059
Don't rock my marriage!

1006
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,992
- Please don't upset my marriage!
- Hey!

1007
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,825
Then do as I said!

1008
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,293
Playing dirty games at this age?

1009
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:22,136
Some idiot gets horny and I have
to pay!

1010
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,577
I'll put an end to this!

1011
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:48,198
(muffled screams in the distance)

1012
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,272
Letme go!

1013
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,579
<i>Joy Cheta?</i>

1014
01:00:28,996 --> 01:00:30,976
Go on! Dig him a hole!

1015
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:46,249
- Yes, Hello, Father-Where on earth
are you? - My dear Father...

1016
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:48,286
(mm-Q
a

1017
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,914
- Where on earth have you been?
- Tell me what's going on!

1018
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,084
You are scaring me!

1019
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:57,220
- There's been a murder in our Parish!
- Oh!

1020
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,264
Wait, what? Murder?

1021
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:01,799
Jesus! Where? When?

1022
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:03,732
- I'll tell you all that later
- Huh?

1023
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,327
- Right now we need to go to the Station
- Ok

1024
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:38,435
Father -I need to Confess

1025
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,913
Father?

1026
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,430
Father...

1027
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:09,501
...
 have sinned...

1028
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:30,310
- I'm leaving now
- Ok

1029
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,417
Father... what is it you were saying?

1030
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:44,254
Who killed who?

1031
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:47,189
My hands and legs are shaking, Father!

1032
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,137
Merciful Lord!

1033
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:11,682
When we killed him, there was a
third person there

1034
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:35,604
Go on! Dig him a hole!

1035
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:11,947
Wow! Great! He wakes up wondering
who to bash up next!

1036
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:14,085
We are finished, Joy Cheta!

1037
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,490
Have you heard of the seal of
Confession?

1038
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,659
The lock on what we Confess in Church

1039
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:25,028
No Priest can break the secrecy
of Confession...

1040
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:28,096
...whatever be the circumstances

1041
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:31,529
Even the Law can't force him to

1042
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:36,034
<i>Joy Cheta... that Priest is no trivial
man</i>

1043
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:50,511
Don't be scared, man! I am in
the right here

1044
01:06:50,577 --> 01:06:53,353
The Lord has to stand with me
on this

1045
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:45,834
Dear Lord! Joy's Confession was no
sinner's repentance!

1046
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:50,281
He was just trying to trip me... it's a
key to lock me with

1047
01:07:51,338 --> 01:07:54,319
mu
Wm

1048
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:59,313
So for me to do anything, I'll need
to know who died

1049
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,385
There's only way to do that... Whatever
happens, I need to take that way

1050
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:08,200
Jesus! Please stand by me!

1051
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:26,518
Faﬁmrr‘?
E

1052
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:30,384
For now... I can't tell you
what's happened - 0k

1053
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:33,421
When it's time, you will understand
even if I don't tell you

1054
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:37,757
- Alright. - From today, I need you to
do some stuff for me

1055
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,399
-And you can't ask me why
-Just tell me what you need, Father

1056
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:44,860
Many things will happen unexpectedly
in this Parish from now

1057
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:47,239
Things that may completely surprise us!

1058
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:50,633
-Whatever it is, it has to stay between
the two of us. - 0k

1059
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:56,314
Tonight, after 10.30...you know that
property Belbychan has put up for sale?

1060
01:08:56,637 --> 01:08:59,208
- I need you to place a shovel there
- Ok

1061
01:08:59,406 --> 01:09:02,785
- Put it among the weeds under the
coconut tree. - Ok

1062
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:07,487
<i>_</i> Kunjoy Chem,
- yes? '

1063
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:09,561
We need to be real careful from now on

1064
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:12,431
Alright, Father

1065
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:17,202
What **** broke this again?

1066
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:20,305
Now this will be on my head too!

1067
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,513
This is a real nuisance!

1068
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:29,577
Hey! Who's that?

1069
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,150
Who's that? What idiot is shining
a light into my face?

1070
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:36,383
- Oh! It's you, Father?
- Who'd you think? Your son?

1071
01:09:39,713 --> 01:09:41,386
Here for more kerosene, are you?

1072
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:43,519
My dear Father! It's not me!

1073
01:09:43,584 --> 01:09:46,258
ME
Emmy

1074
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:49,299
- Whateverl say, you don't believe me!
- So stop saying shit!

1075
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:52,636
0k, I will pay for it tomorrow at
the Panchayat office

1076
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,366
- Yes, you should!
- Ok!

1077
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:56,408
Out playing throw-n-catch at night!

1078
01:09:57,264 --> 01:09:58,937
- Huh?
- Go home, man!

1079
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:02,645
If this doesn't end, I will go broke
paying the Panchayat!

1080
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:08,684
Which idiot is that?

1081
01:10:10,544 --> 01:10:11,955
What son of poison did you buy?

1082
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:13,582
That's all we can get for Rs. 150

1083

Em
<i>m</i>

1084
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,626
So hard to get down the throat!

1085
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:20,325
It burns all the way down! We should've
bought something to go with it

1086
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,367
- I had a hard timejust buying glasses!
- Don't get upset!

1087
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,594
Can we ask Sakuntala Chechi for some
pickles or fish curry?

1088
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:28,633
- Just for an accompaniment
- I'll come too!

1089
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:31,437
At this time of the night, Sakuntala is
not going to give anyone anything

Eta

1091
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:36,605

-And let her steal from this?

01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,910
- What's he...
- Hey!

1093
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:39,951
-Who's that?

- Traitor!
- It's the truth, isn't it?

1097
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,321
We were just enjoying the breeze,
Father

1098
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:50,419
People say the breeze from Kumarakom...

1099
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:51,986
...b
ows in these pans

1100
01:10:52,052 --> 01:10:53,963
And are you done enjoying the breeze?

1101
01:10:54,054 --> 01:10:56,500
- We were almost done when you came
- Go home!

1102
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,704
- I won't go without them
- All of you go home!

1103
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:00,965
Come on. Looks like the Priest
is on to us

1104
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:03,406
Hey! Take that stuff with you too!

1105
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,010
Don't waste it! It's all we have!

1106
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:07,007
_ Yes?

1107
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:09,976

1109
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:16,054
Go on, then

1110
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:19,549
Father! The boys are afraid to go this
way

1111
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,684
They say there are snakes and ghosts
out there

1112
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:24,453
Could you come with us?

1113
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:27,327
- Just up to Sakunta
a's house
- Can't do without my torch, can you?

1114
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:30,299
You're a Priest so you have a
crucifix and stuff

1115
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:32,860
-Just go, will you?
- Come with us, Father, please!

1116
01:11:32,993 --> 01:11:35,872
Please come, Father! Sakuntala is
actually a nice woman

1117
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:39,672
There are only two pegs left. I've only
had one, ok?

1118
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:48,417
- On your from Changanacherry?
- No Father. We were at the tailors'

1119
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:51,489
-We got a frock done for her
- Bobachan calls regularly?

1120
01:11:52,346 --> 01:11:55,555
It's been a couple of days. He was
supposed to come home this week

1121
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:58,489
Mamachan said he met him last week
at Pollachi

1122
01:12:03,324 --> 01:12:05,861
if I can find him some work here, I'll
try to bring him back

1123
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,895
You can go now

1124
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:10,033
Come

1125
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:25,554
Father, the first Sunday after the
FesﬁvaL"

1126
01:12:25,646 --> 01:12:28,490
...we would like to celebrate our
elder's girl's engagement

1127
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:32,496
- The groom's family also agreed
- No, not that Sunday

1128
01:12:32,787 --> 01:12:35,393
That is the day we set for
Be
bychan's son's wedding

1129
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:38,527
- Oh! Was that fixed?
- Yes it was

1130
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,605
And he didn't breathe a word!

1131
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:44,436
No wonder the whole family went on
pilgrimage to Velankanni

1132
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:46,512
They went to Velankanni? When?

1133
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,807
I met him at the boat jetty last night

1134
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:50,916
- They left early this morning
- Oh!

1135
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:53,781
I think they mean to invite people
when they get back

1136
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:57,579
So this time even after the Festival,
there'll be celebrations

1137
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:01,386
So you plan accordingly - any Sunday
after that

1138
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,054
I need to go across the river today.
I'll see you later

1139
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:08,032
We're leaving too. Today at 11.30 we are
changing the bulb near Sakunta
a's

1140
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:12,934
- The electricty board guys are coming
- This is a regular duty for them!

1141
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:23,174
-That's alright, Pappy Cheta!
- Oh no! The Priest!

1142
01:13:23,437 --> 01:13:25,110
Doesn't he have any work at the Church?

1143
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:27,174
- Have you started drinking now?
-Just came to get some curry. -What?

1144
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:29,388
Curry. Dad called me over

1145
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:31,683
Best dad! Go home, girl!

1146
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,726
- Father, I have something to tell you
- What?

1147
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:37,125
- Please call Lijo and lecture him
- Oh great!

1148
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:40,461
If you want, get him to Confession! He
is a bit wayward... and not calling me!

1149
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:43,161
- Go home, girl!
- I am serious, Father!

1150
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:45,204
It's been three days since he last
called me

1151
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:49,708
When I called his sister she said...

1152
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:53,175
...that he's gone on some trip... could
you talk to him, please?

1153
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:55,414
-I will. Leave now,
- Will you call for sure?

1154
01:13:55,502 --> 01:13:56,674
- So you'll call?
- I will

1155
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,750
Ea

mum
w

1157
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:14,427
This number can't be reached right now..

1158
01:18:41,522 --> 01:18:45,026
Who is it at this time? Is he born
of a bat or something?

1159
01:19:02,076 --> 01:19:04,716
What? He's leaving? Oh no!

1160
01:19:04,812 --> 01:19:08,885
He was not coming here? Has someone
else set up shop around here?

1161
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:12,486
Oh no, the Priest! Can't he ever sleep
in the Church at night?

1162
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:24,536
Praise be to Jesus, Father!

1163
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:27,801
So this is what you do? All day you go
around as a social worker...

1164
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:30,568
...and target homes to break into at
night? Fool!

1165
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:33,412
Father! Oh no!

1166
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,808
I am going to get you into Confession
tonight

1167
01:20:37,938 --> 01:20:39,918
And the rest in front of all the
villagers tomorrow

1168
01:20:39,974 --> 01:20:42,079
Father! You have to forgive me this
once

1169
01:20:42,243 --> 01:20:45,190
I will never do it again! Please don't
humiliate me!

1170
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:48,519
Member! Trying to have your cake
and eat it too?

1171
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:52,063
So you were the one to rip Lazar's
mom's ears off!

1172
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:54,632
- How could you, fool!
- ltjust happened!

1173
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:56,400
- I'll fall at your feet!
- No need

1174
01:20:56,457 --> 01:20:59,097
- What if I come to Confession?
- I will make you do that anyway

1175
01:20:59,193 --> 01:21:02,640
I can tell you every dirty little thing
that happens in Arayanthuruthu at night!

1176
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:06,333
All the men who are decent by
day and imbeciles by night!

1177
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,849
- I'm seeing that for myself!
- It's not just me! And I know them all!

1178
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:13,451
- Will you spare me?
- No!

1179
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:18,285
I know all the guys who break the bulb
at Sakuntala's place. Shall I tell you?

1180
01:21:18,412 --> 01:21:21,256
-I can find that for myself
- 0k. Then let me reveal something else

1181
01:21:21,349 --> 01:21:25,126
- Don't tell me anything!
- Father! I know how Joy's wife died!

1182
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:29,291
If you promise not to out me, I will
tell you everything about that night

1183
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:31,097
What?

1184
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:35,662
M!
mu

1185
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:38,043
That's what I think, I mean

1186
01:21:38,665 --> 01:21:40,645
It's true, Father!

1187
01:22:05,726 --> 01:22:08,605
Don't these people sleep? Jesus!

1188
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,550
Her father asked to borrow some money

1189
01:22:22,643 --> 01:22:26,022
-I paid it into her account, that's all
- Don't start lying, Joy!

1190
01:22:26,247 --> 01:22:28,488
I know how many women you have relations
with on this island

1191
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:30,687
-Afight? Let me see (from inside)
-What on earth are you talking about?

1192
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,355
Do you need proof for that too?

1193
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:51,040
When your proposal came up, everyone
said...

1194
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:54,242
...that you have affairs allover
the island!

1195
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:59,990
- It was just my bad fate...
- Shut up! Stop the blabbering!

1196
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:03,287
Do you have any sincerity towards me?

1197
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:07,024
Have you ever opened up to me?

1198
01:23:07,254 --> 01:23:09,234
Ever even smiled at me?

1199
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:11,997
- Except to pretend in public?
-I said, keep quiet!

1200
01:23:12,426 --> 01:23:16,101
With all your girlfriends out there, you
can't stand my voice now?

1201
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:26,380
Before I brought you here as my wife...

1202
01:23:26,474 --> 01:23:28,454
...
 had many affairs out there

1203
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,682
Give out a few names, please!

1204
01:23:30,745 --> 01:23:35,160
Even after, there have been a few

1205
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:38,395
I'm a man! I will do as I please!

1206
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:41,499
Don't you have everything you need?

1207
01:23:41,722 --> 01:23:45,260
- What do I have? Four meals a day?
- Yes!

1208
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,102
You better gobble that up and be
silent and invisible in here

1209
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:52,336
- Very bad!
- I might have many affairs! I'm a man!

1210
01:23:52,433 --> 01:23:55,107
If you can, I can too!

1211
01:23:55,736 --> 01:23:57,716
I was fed up of you, you useless
woman!

1212
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:59,751
Looks like she is asking for it!

1213
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:03,612
This child that you are..

1214
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:06,214
...pampering and parading
everywhere...

1215
01:24:07,147 --> 01:24:09,127
...she isn't yours!

1216
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:14,261
Wow! Terrible woman!

1217
01:24:16,624 --> 01:24:19,070
You will say any atrocity to win,
won't you?

1218
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:24,206
She isn't yours!

1219
01:24:28,135 --> 01:24:30,741
Then which *****'s is she?

1220
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:36,645
You better come out with it

1221
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,714
...or your dad and mom will have to come
here tomorrow

1222
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:42,521
And in front of the entire village...

1223
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:45,189
- ...you will have to say it (whispering)
- Say it! Say it!

1224
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:48,367
Say it! I said, say it!

1225
01:24:49,523 --> 01:24:51,503
(whispering)
-Just say it! - Say it!

1226
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,666
Shit! I couldn't hear it!

1227
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:59,711
At least give me a clue!

1228
01:25:22,456 --> 01:25:24,436
What a suspense!

1229
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:39,774
Do only the two of you know about this?

1230
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,495
Oh no!

1231
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:59,434
Will this idiot call everyone and get
me killed in the process?

1232
01:26:23,817 --> 01:26:25,524
Drink!

1233
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:45,584
Lissie

1234
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,820
I want my child

1235
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:55,823
This thing...

1236
01:26:58,486 --> 01:27:00,466
...a third person should not
come to know

1237
01:27:03,691 --> 01:27:05,671
So it's better you die

1238
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:09,374
Good Lord! Murder!

1239
01:27:10,364 --> 01:27:12,344
I will kill him too!

1240
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:20,647
First the kid's father! She is second...
and I am the third! I am out!

1241
01:27:26,247 --> 01:27:27,988
He must have killed her

1242
01:27:28,048 --> 01:27:29,652
I am sure!

1243
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:31,993
I couldn't hear who the original
father of the kid was

1244
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:34,833
Whoever it is, Joy is going to
kill him too!

1245
01:27:35,456 --> 01:27:37,766
It's not as we thought! Joy is evil!

1246
01:27:37,858 --> 01:27:39,769
Have you said this to anyone else?

1247
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:43,335
What are you talking about, Father?
How could I tell anyone about this?

1248
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,706
Wouldn't I also have to say why
I was there?

1249
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:47,904
Would anyone knowingly put their hands
on a live bomb?

1250
01:27:48,035 --> 01:27:50,242
- Don't let anyone else know
- No!

1251
01:27:50,337 --> 01:27:52,510
Never! In fact...

1252
01:27:52,673 --> 01:27:55,517
...
 feel better after telling you this

1253
01:27:55,809 --> 01:27:57,789
I was feeling so suffocated!

1254
01:27:58,312 --> 01:27:59,882
I would have gone mad!

1255
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:01,585
Now let me tell you something

1256
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:04,823
If even a dried up coconut goes missing
in this place, it's your responsibility!

1257
01:28:05,653 --> 01:28:07,633
Father? Father!

1258
01:28:07,821 --> 01:28:09,630
What son of a Priest are you?

1259
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,670
lam talking about murder and he talks
about coconuts!

1260
01:28:11,892 --> 01:28:13,667
Nonsense!

1261
01:28:14,862 --> 01:28:22,862
Father!

1262
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:30,923
What's this, Father? Blocking the
roads now?

1263
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,920
May be

1264
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:35,561
a
a Emma?

1265
01:28:35,616 --> 01:28:37,857
- You know about Confessional secrecy?
- Ybs

1266
01:28:37,918 --> 01:28:39,898
That's between Jesus and his Priests

1267
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:41,900
-We don't reveal it to anyone
-I know that, Father

1268
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:45,104
But before the flag is hoisted for the
Festival this year...

1269
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:46,804
...
 will have you on a cross, Joy!

1270
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,840
And I will make sure you are thrown
in jail...

1271
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,876
...without ever revealing the secret of
Confession, ok?

1272
01:28:54,401 --> 01:28:58,110
I respect Father Vincent Kombana, the
Vicar of Arayanthuruthu

1273
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:03,119
But not Kom ban Vincent, the lad
from Mattancherry

1274
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,589
Get it?

1275
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:10,321
So dear Father Vincent Kom bana...

1276
01:29:10,784 --> 01:29:12,786
...Praise be to the Lord!

1277
01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:14,833
Today and Forever!

1278
01:29:16,657 --> 01:29:18,637
Go on, then!

1279
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,990
a
E

1280
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,020
Tomorrowl need you to go to my
house in Mattancherry

1281
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:44,960
I have entrusted something there

1282
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:46,999
Varkey Chetan will hand over
Rs. 15 lakhs to you

1283
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:50,436
Elam?
E

1284
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:53,038
Belbychan has a property for sale

1285
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:55,107
Ea mm
a

1286
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:59,136
Get the 12 cents at the Western end,
close to the shrimp farm

1287
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,012
Buy that. 12 cents.

1288
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:04,049
- Hmm
- Arrange for the registration tomorrow

1289
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:06,416
- I have already spoken to Belbychan
- Ok

1290
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:09,188
Be ready in the morning. I will drop
you to the jetty.

1291
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:12,718
- If anyone asks anything...
-I can handle it

1292
01:30:13,013 --> 01:30:15,653
-I can just say I am going to my
wife's place. - Right

1293
01:30:18,485 --> 01:30:20,021
- Before the Festival...
- Ybs?

1294
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:22,067
...we need to have some fireworks in
Arayanthuruthu

1295
01:30:22,857 --> 01:30:24,666
Jesus!

1296
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,068
It's been a while...

1297
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:28,629
...sinc:e we had some real
fireworks

1298
01:30:33,534 --> 01:30:35,514
Oh no! It's the Priest!
The Priest!

1299
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:37,549
Wait, wait!

1300
01:30:37,838 --> 01:30:39,818
It's just the Priest!

1301
01:30:39,907 --> 01:30:41,784
- What's everyone up to?
- Nothing... I mean...

1302
01:30:41,842 --> 01:30:43,788
The Panchayath... building... you know...

1303
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:45,755
...above it... there's a room...

1304
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:47,190
- For rent...
-Yes, rent...

1305
01:30:47,248 --> 01:30:50,161
- Give it to someone good, ok?
- Alright, alright. - Ok?

1306
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:52,931
Father! Step out for a minute, will you?

1307
01:30:53,187 --> 01:30:54,996
-I need to talk to you
-What's it about, Stephen?

1308
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:57,035
Just get out here, Father!

1309
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:01,167
He may have been a wayward drunk but...

1310
01:31:01,495 --> 01:31:04,169
...my brother Joekuttan was happily
settled here with his business

1311
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:06,445
You interfered and forced him out

1312
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:09,773
He barely stayed for two days at the
plantation. - Huh?

1313
01:31:10,704 --> 01:31:12,684
After that, we have no idea about his
whereabouts

1314
01:31:13,507 --> 01:31:15,487
We are unable to get him on the phone

1315
01:31:16,711 --> 01:31:18,156
You were the one to turn his head!

1316
01:31:18,212 --> 01:31:20,954
A Priest should just do a Priest's job,
got it?

1317
01:31:22,716 --> 01:31:24,662
If anything happens to my boy...

1318
01:31:24,752 --> 01:31:27,562
...you will not see Mattancherry in one
piece again!

1319
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:31,597
Stephen! How old is your kid?

1320
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:32,997
Maybe 1 or 1 and a half, right?

1321
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,870
If you need this hand back so you
can feed him again...

1322
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:37,603
...take it back now!

1323
01:31:37,665 --> 01:31:40,202
If not you will have to feed him with
the hand you use to wipe your bottom

1324
01:31:43,537 --> 01:31:45,881
Your little brother was up to no good
here. That's why I sent him packing

1325
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,020
If he ended up somewhere bad, that's
his fate!

1326
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:51,282
You know only Father Vincent,
the Vicar of Arayanthuruthu.

1327
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:53,625
Got it? Now get home before it
rains!

1328
01:31:54,982 --> 01:31:57,724
Have some black tea and then ask
your fatherVarkeychan...

1329
01:31:57,852 --> 01:31:59,627
...who Vincent Komban is!

1330
01:31:59,687 --> 01:32:02,190
And if you are still not satisfied,
come to the Church after 7

1331
01:32:04,325 --> 01:32:06,100
I'll see you around

1332
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,640
- Move aside!
- What are you pushing me for?

1333
01:32:09,997 --> 01:32:12,034
So Joekuttan is missing!

1334
01:32:12,132 --> 01:32:14,112
Could he have been the secret lover?

1335
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:16,715
Then Joy will kill him too!

1336
01:32:17,304 --> 01:32:19,284
- Did you hear anything
- I did

1337
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:22,552
Well, I have said nothing and you
have heard nothing. Got it?

1338
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:24,590

- yes? '

1350
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:02,594
Hey! Sir! Wait for me!

1351
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:04,630
-What's it, Father?
-I have called Suniyappan

1352
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,698
Mark the boundaries and build a wall
around the property

1353
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:10,668
Suniyappan is good. He can bring the
material too

1354
01:33:10,925 --> 01:33:12,905
The foundation should be deep and strong

1355
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,270
- This property gets flooded in just two
days of rain. - That's true

1356
01:33:15,629 --> 01:33:17,768
Plan it so you can start work tomorrow
itself

1357
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:19,811
-Why delay it for no reason, right,
Member? - True

1358
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:22,381
It's always good to keep your property
closed and secure

1359
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,650
But we don't have to fear that thief
anymore

1360
01:33:25,206 --> 01:33:28,050
I think someone must have caught
him and stopped him

1361
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,088
- I guess we can get moving then,
shall we? - Sure

1362
01:33:30,678 --> 01:33:32,658
Come Makkali Sir... let's go

1363
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:39,662
- Belbychan... we need to meet
- I will come over

1364
01:33:39,754 --> 01:33:41,734
- For sure
- Good for you if you do

1365
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:43,902
I will come to the office. Ok, Sir?
Goodbye

1366
01:33:46,193 --> 01:33:48,173
Joy! What's up?

1367
01:33:48,262 --> 01:33:50,936
- ls the land division done?
- Yes, I just sent the officers off

1368
01:33:51,398 --> 01:33:53,071
Hello there, Joy!

1369
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,609
That's a beautiful plot you got for
Kunjoy Chetan, Father

1370
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:59,242
Why didn't you buy it whole? Why
just a portion?

1371
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,183
We only needed those 12 cents, Joy

1372
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,082
If you say so, Father

1373
01:34:03,244 --> 01:34:04,917
Today is the Festival flag hoisting
at Chathankary Church

1374
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,125
I was invited. So let me get going

1375
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:10,295
Go on, go on!

1376
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:15,958
Only one more week to our flag
hoisting, isn't it, Father?

1377
01:34:16,223 --> 01:34:18,169
So much to do before that, Joy!

1378
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:20,205
- It will be great, Father!
- Of course!

1379
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:22,274
- I'll see you around, Father
- Go on

1380
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:24,275
See you around!

1381
01:34:36,277 --> 01:34:37,654
It's nothing at all!

1382
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:40,385
I'll be on my way too, Father.
I need to go to Lijo's place

1383
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:42,792
a
Em

1384
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,830
...and he is staying away for a bit.
It's been a few days now

1385
01:34:44,985 --> 01:34:46,965
I can't get him on his phone

1386
01:34:47,688 --> 01:34:49,668
- Then it's better to go and enquire
- Ok

1387
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:53,137
Father... I...

1388
01:34:53,194 --> 01:34:55,174
...
 mean... may I...

1389
01:35:13,714 --> 01:35:15,694
- Father?
- What is it, Salamma?

1390
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:18,192
- I've been trying to call Bobachan for
many days now-And?

1391
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:22,098
His phone is switched off. I must have
called around forty times today

1392
01:35:22,323 --> 01:35:24,166
Maybe his phone is not working

1393
01:35:24,225 --> 01:35:26,068
No, Father. It's over 4 days since
he called

1394
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,936
Remember I told you he was going to
Pond icherry?

1395
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,736
He hasn't called since

1396
01:35:30,798 --> 01:35:32,778
Maybe he is at the mill. Don't get
worked up

1397
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,880
Hey Makkali - call up the mill and...

1398
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:37,506
...tell them to connect to Bobachan. Say
his wife is trying to get in touch

1399
01:35:41,275 --> 01:35:42,219
Come

1400
01:35:47,548 --> 01:35:50,461
For God's sake, Salamma! Stay calm!
Let him make the call

1401
01:35:51,785 --> 01:35:53,264
Father!

1402
01:35:53,454 --> 01:35:56,128
They say he left for home about 4 days
ago

1403
01:35:59,093 --> 01:36:01,039
Good Lord! Another missing person!

1404
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:04,442
Satheeshan tried calling him from the
mill too... but he was not answering

1405
01:36:06,834 --> 01:36:08,814
So were there two secret lovers?

1406
01:36:12,339 --> 01:36:13,818
And one more thing

1407
01:36:13,874 --> 01:36:16,184
-Joekuttan seems to be missing too
- Forget about him!

1408
01:36:16,343 --> 01:36:18,949

1409
01:36:19,013 --> 01:36:21,391
WEE

1410
01:36:25,453 --> 01:36:27,433
Father - shall we give a police
complaint?

1411
01:36:27,488 --> 01:36:29,832
I am sure they are up to no good,
Father!

1412
01:36:30,524 --> 01:36:33,095
Seems Joekuttan had showed up at
the mill once

1413
01:36:33,427 --> 01:36:35,407
Let's file a complaint

1414
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:38,811
Actually, it is Joekuttan's being there
that worries me

1415
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,046
You and Member go the Police Station
rig ht away

1416
01:36:42,503 --> 01:36:44,483
File a complaint

1417
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:48,086
- Say its a case of man-missing
-Yes, let's do that

1418
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:50,287
a
Em

1419
01:36:50,344 --> 01:36:52,324
Come with me... fast...

1420
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:06,338
mag;

1421
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:09,074
Come on, dear! Put some effort
into your job!

1422
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:12,140
-What accident of nature are you...?
-You should ask my dad!

1423
01:37:12,266 --> 01:37:14,246
- Would your father know?
- Kunjoy! - Yes?

1424
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:16,281
-Where does this go?
- They'll bring the stones by evening

1425
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,550
Do what seems logical to you!

1426
01:37:18,973 --> 01:37:20,919
It will take us all day to dig the pits

1427
01:37:20,975 --> 01:37:22,955
Alright

1428
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:26,316
I think it's going to rain. If it
does, everything will be a mess

1429
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:28,323
You fool, those are not rain clouds

1430
01:37:28,382 --> 01:37:30,328
It's not going to rain! Go and start
digging!

1431
01:37:30,384 --> 01:37:32,364
If things get messy, don't blame me

1432
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:35,867
- Kunjoy! - Yes?
- You entrusted this work to Suniyappan?

1433
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:39,264
- Yes. Why?
- He has never finished...

1434
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,234
- manything he started!
- Really?

1435
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:44,343
I will drag him from his home for
Confession if he doesn't!

1436
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:47,012
Start digging!

1437
01:37:47,068 --> 01:37:49,048
You take this basket to him

1438
01:38:05,286 --> 01:38:08,062
When I sought Your Help, You
gave me answers

1439
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:10,536
Emmy

1440
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:16,171
You light a lamp in me

1441
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:19,210
My
Elm

1442
01:38:31,445 --> 01:38:33,425
- Speak, Kunjoy Cheta!
- Father...

1443
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:36,258
...things are really messed up! In our
land...

1444
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:38,956
...when they were digging, they found
a corpse!

1445
01:38:39,019 --> 01:38:40,965
- Is there a crowd there?
- Yes

1446
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:44,134
- Have you called the Police?
- Member called

1447
01:38:44,492 --> 01:38:47,200
- They are on the way
-You can hang up now

1448
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:49,241
- I'll be right there
- Make it fast!

1449
01:39:28,168 --> 01:39:30,114
- Buddy! Look here, buddy!
- Give him some water to drink

1450
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:33,117
You should give the real thirsty
ones first, you know?

1451
01:39:33,173 --> 01:39:34,618
Are you such a coward, buddy?

1452
01:39:34,675 --> 01:39:37,656
- Have you ever seen a corpse when
digging a pit for a wall? - That's true

1453
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:43,295
- No fever or anything?
- No fever

1454
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:46,264
- The bash-up train is here
-ls he coming here too?

1455
01:39:46,354 --> 01:39:48,334
He won't spare anyone or anything! He
is everywhere!

1456
01:39:51,058 --> 01:39:53,038
-You! Move those people away
- Sir! Here is the Priest!

1457
01:40:02,236 --> 01:40:04,216
- So what's the scene?
- It's bad

1458
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:07,542
- Have you identified the victim? - It's
over a week old... so it's difficult

1459
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:10,381
But there was a purse and Id card
in the victim's pocket

1460
01:40:10,811 --> 01:40:12,791
_ Hey you!
_Yes?

1461
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:16,328
- Here
- Ok

1462
01:40:29,496 --> 01:40:31,703
- Note down the people who saw the body
first. - Ok

1463
01:40:41,308 --> 01:40:44,016
- Get statements from all of them, ok?
- Ok Sir

1464
01:40:44,745 --> 01:40:47,385
- Don't cry, Salamma
- Move the other women from there

1465
01:40:48,215 --> 01:40:49,694
- Please stop crying.

1466
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,424
- Do stop crying. - Tell her, sister
- Stop crying, child

1467
01:40:52,653 --> 01:40:54,599
- He was just starting to live his life
(background) - Make arrangements for the postmortem

1468
01:40:54,655 --> 01:40:56,635
I wonder what happened to him

1469
01:40:56,857 --> 01:40:59,770
What are you talking about, Father?
lam sure Joy murdered him

1470
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:03,641
I mean... Eldhose had 6 fingers on his
right hand

1471
01:41:03,697 --> 01:41:05,677
And Salamma identified him too

1472
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,456
- Sir, are there any hints?
- Huh?

1473
01:41:18,546 --> 01:41:20,492
He was killed for sure. There were
multiple stab wounds

1474
01:41:20,648 --> 01:41:22,423
And the knife used to stab him was
also found in the pit

1475
01:41:22,516 --> 01:41:24,553
Now we need to find the who and
the why

1476
01:41:24,651 --> 01:41:27,063
-A
right then, I'll leave you to it.
Call me if you need anything. - 0k

1477
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:35,741
I was across the lake at the bank when
I heard

1478
01:41:36,697 --> 01:41:38,677
And I was before the altar when I heard

1479
01:41:42,202 --> 01:41:44,182
Only two days left for the Festival
flag to rise, Father

1480
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:47,275
All that will work out fine, Joy

1481
01:41:47,575 --> 01:41:50,579
I have already taken care of stuff...
for before the flag hoisting

1482
01:41:51,211 --> 01:41:53,191
So don't you worry about that

1483
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:56,862
I can raise the flag today if I want

1484
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:01,494
Before the next rain, Joy...

1485
01:42:01,589 --> 01:42:03,626
...
 will have you on the cross

1486
01:42:03,758 --> 01:42:05,738
You can take that as Father Vincent
Kombana's words...

1487
01:42:05,793 --> 01:42:09,502
...or the words of Kom ban Vincent, the
lad from Mattancherry. Your wish!

1488
01:42:09,563 --> 01:42:11,543
Your building a wall around
these 12 cents...

1489
01:42:11,665 --> 01:42:14,839
...was your trap for me. You thought I
wouldn't see that, Father?

1490
01:42:15,469 --> 01:42:18,109
And by the way,
Father Vincent Kombana...

1491
01:42:18,172 --> 01:42:20,152
...may not dig a pit

1492
01:42:20,408 --> 01:42:22,513
But as for Komban Vincent...

1493
01:42:22,576 --> 01:42:24,556
...he will dig far more than a pit,
I know

1494
01:42:26,547 --> 01:42:28,652
So... Father...

1495
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:31,697
...
 need you to watch this

1496
01:42:59,213 --> 01:43:00,851
Come on, Joy! If anyone sees this,
I'll be the one to fall in the pit!

1497
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:02,894
All this will be on me! Please
don't do that to me!

1498
01:43:03,283 --> 01:43:05,263
Joy needs to save Joy's head first,
doesn't he, Father?

1499
01:43:06,687 --> 01:43:08,963
Don't push me into this to save
yourself, Joy!

1500
01:43:09,723 --> 01:43:12,465
If you are the one to hoist
the flag this time...

1501
01:43:12,659 --> 01:43:15,731
...
 will be right there in front,
clapping and cheering

1502
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,974
-A
right, then, Father. Praise
be to Jesus!

1503
01:43:22,936 --> 01:43:24,643
Listen guys! We need to be around
to step things up

1504
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:27,208
-We should try and speed up the
postmortem. - I'll come too

1505
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:30,385
-Jesus! I can't figure this out
-They should bring in the CBI

1506
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:32,591
Can you spare Rs. 50?

1507
01:43:32,846 --> 01:43:35,258
- Rs. 50? You...! . - It's ok, I don't
needit

1508
01:43:35,315 --> 01:43:37,295
- People are going crazy out here and
he... - It's ok... I don't want it

1509
01:44:16,657 --> 01:44:18,637
- Father? -Yes?
- Could you give me that register?

1510
01:44:18,826 --> 01:44:20,806
- I left out an entry from yesterday
- Oh ok!

1511
01:44:21,528 --> 01:44:23,508
Why did you need to meet me,
Kunjoy Cheta?

1512
01:44:24,398 --> 01:44:26,378
What can I say, Santocha?

1513
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:28,707
All I wanted was to build a house

1514
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:30,908
That's why I bought that property
from Belbychan. You know that

1515
01:44:31,705 --> 01:44:33,685
And see how that turned out!

1516
01:44:35,676 --> 01:44:39,021
You... I heard you have a property for
sale... next to the Jetty

1517
01:44:39,547 --> 01:44:41,493
I wanted to ask you about that.
That's why I asked you to come

1518
01:44:44,652 --> 01:44:48,065
A couple of prospects have
looked at it already

1519
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:51,434
If you really want it, I can
make that happen

1520
01:44:51,492 --> 01:44:53,403
EEK?
E

1521
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,406
You just need to give a little time

1522
01:44:55,496 --> 01:44:57,476
I need to get that graveyard
off my hands!

1523
01:44:57,998 --> 01:44:59,978
- Huh?
- Alright.

1524
01:45:01,602 --> 01:45:03,946
- We'll make it happen. - Deal?
- Kunjoy! -Yes!

1525
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:05,907
The Priest is calling. I'll be
rig ht back

1526
01:45:05,973 --> 01:45:08,283
- Don't go away. I'll be back
-Are you there? - Coming, Father!

1527
01:45:41,575 --> 01:45:44,613
Another murder is set to happen
in this village, soon

1528
01:45:45,145 --> 01:45:47,853
So even though it's wrong, I have to
reveal this Confessional secret now

1529
01:45:49,049 --> 01:45:51,029
Eldhose was murdered by Joy

1530
01:45:51,685 --> 01:45:53,665
And it wasn't just Eldhose

1531
01:45:54,055 --> 01:45:56,035
He killed Lissie too

1532
01:45:56,657 --> 01:45:58,637
Eldhose is the real father of
Joy's child

1533
01:45:59,627 --> 01:46:01,402
Joy killed Eldhose when he came
to know about that

1534
01:46:01,462 --> 01:46:03,442
It's because he is so overly
fond of the child

1535
01:46:03,731 --> 01:46:05,711
He didn't want anyone else to know

1536
01:46:12,807 --> 01:46:14,787
Only Eldhose and Lissie knew

1537
01:46:15,175 --> 01:46:17,155
That's why he killed both of them

1538
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:20,355
He told me about both murders
in Confession

1539
01:46:24,518 --> 01:46:26,054
And not just the two murders he
committed...

1540
01:46:26,153 --> 01:46:28,133
...he also told me about a Sin he
was about to commit

1541
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:33,405
its

1542
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:34,869
Santo!

1543
01:46:34,962 --> 01:46:36,942
Joy will kill him too

1544
01:46:39,133 --> 01:46:42,444
Forget about the ones he killed! But
Santo was so loyal to Joy!

1545
01:46:42,836 --> 01:46:45,783
its

1546
01:46:46,107 --> 01:46:47,780
That's why even though it's a
grave sin...

1547
01:46:47,842 --> 01:46:50,083
...I am revealing this Confessional
secret

1548
01:46:50,511 --> 01:46:52,491
It's something a Priest should
never do!

1549
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,610
- Walk out
- Ok

1550
01:47:12,699 --> 01:47:14,679
Father!

1551
01:47:15,503 --> 01:47:17,414
What are you doing here? Didn't
I ask you to stand over there?

1552
01:47:17,571 --> 01:47:19,551
Father! Please save me!

1553
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:21,552
mp?
a

1554
01:47:21,775 --> 01:47:23,448
I'll tell you everything

1555
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:25,490
- Don't let me get killed!
- What happened?

1556
01:47:26,513 --> 01:47:28,493
Joy is going to kill me. For sure!

1557
01:47:30,151 --> 01:47:32,131
m
[imp

1558
01:47:32,253 --> 01:47:34,529
-I will tell you everything
-About what?

1559
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:39,603
Everything that happened since the
night Lissie Chechi died

1560
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:46,076
If you are involved...

1561
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:48,113
...you can Confess your Sins
to me

1562
01:47:49,103 --> 01:47:51,083
But just because you do that, I
cannot save you

1563
01:47:51,171 --> 01:47:53,151
Or else you should reveal everything

1564
01:47:53,674 --> 01:47:55,449
Father... no Confession...

1565
01:47:55,509 --> 01:47:57,489
I will reveal everything

1566
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:05,030
Ea
{mm

1567
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:09,101
It's just a phone. Forget it! We
will get you a new one

1568
01:48:09,723 --> 01:48:13,034
I said I was going to Theni. My sister
will be so surprised to see me home!

1569
01:48:14,661 --> 01:48:16,641
Let's give everyone a surprise!

1570
01:48:18,499 --> 01:48:21,503
- How about another drink?
- No! No more for me

1571
01:48:21,969 --> 01:48:23,744
Oh look, it's Joy!

1572
01:48:24,037 --> 01:48:26,540
We were thinking of having a
drink in secret...

1573
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,720
...but you caught us!

1574
01:48:28,909 --> 01:48:31,150
What's that in your hand, Joy?
ls it a bottle?

1575
01:48:32,947 --> 01:48:35,154
-Are you on your way from the timber-
logging site? -Ah, yes

1576
01:48:36,116 --> 01:48:38,153
- Why didn't you come when Lissie died?

1577
01:48:38,218 --> 01:48:39,891
...came to know much later. Also...

1578
01:48:39,954 --> 01:48:43,299
-Wasn't that bad of you?
- I... don't like going to funerals

1579
01:48:44,124 --> 01:48:46,104
It makes me sad... that's why...

1580
01:48:46,894 --> 01:48:48,999
But you should have been there
before me, shoudn't you?

1581
01:48:56,003 --> 01:48:57,983
Before she died...

1582
01:48:58,772 --> 01:49:00,581
...she said your name out once

1583
01:49:00,641 --> 01:49:02,621
<i>Joy Chem...</i>

1584
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:05,690
I was standing there tall and steady
when she did

1585
01:49:10,017 --> 01:49:11,997
I am not really sure about it

1586
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,900
But that's what I like to believe

1587
01:49:20,294 --> 01:49:22,604
Or else every time I see you...

1588
01:49:22,663 --> 01:49:24,643
...
 will start losing my confidence

1589
01:50:03,971 --> 01:50:05,951
Go on! Dig him a hole!

1590
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:14,793
Kattuthara Joy?

1591
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,830
- Shall I lock him up, Father?
- Ok

1592
01:50:19,287 --> 01:50:21,267
Let's go, shall we?

1593
01:50:22,322 --> 01:50:23,733
Father...

1594
01:50:24,024 --> 01:50:25,594
...even if it was to save my life...

1595
01:50:25,693 --> 01:50:28,799
...wasn't it wrong to reveal the
Confessional secret? - Hey you! Enough!

1596
01:50:28,862 --> 01:50:31,843
No Priest ever reveals a
Confessional secret, Santo

1597
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:33,879
Whatever it may be for

1598
01:50:51,252 --> 01:50:54,961
- So what's going on?
- His questioning is on in full swing

1599
01:50:55,356 --> 01:50:58,860
Now do you realise who the real ****s
of Arayanthuruthu are?

1600
01:50:59,693 --> 01:51:01,866
When the body was taken out of the
pit...

1601
01:51:01,996 --> 01:51:04,067
mam
a

1602
01:51:04,131 --> 01:51:06,839
- Yes! -And you already are a
no-good!

1603
01:51:06,901 --> 01:51:09,347
- Get lost! -And you were not seen
around for a few days, that's why!

1604
01:51:09,436 --> 01:51:12,940
- <i>That's right!</i> - <i>Dear Belbychan Cheta..
for a week Bobachan and I...</i>

1605
01:51:13,107 --> 01:51:15,747
...were at Velankanni!
- Oh! ls it?

1606
01:51:15,809 --> 01:51:18,289
- Right! And here we were digging up
corpses! - Move away!

1607
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:20,325
Move away! Move!

1608
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:22,820
(Crowd m uttering)

1609
01:51:22,883 --> 01:51:25,022
lam not doing this job anymore!

1610
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:28,896
(crowd m uttering)

1611
01:51:32,793 --> 01:51:34,773
He should be driven away, the pig!

1612
01:51:34,928 --> 01:51:37,465
There he comes! Move! Move!

1613
01:51:37,698 --> 01:51:41,737
- There he comes! - ls there any place
in Arayanthuruthu that he isn't?

1614
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:44,110
Let the Priest come

1615
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:46,151
- Move! - ls he going to take
Confessions here?

1616
01:51:46,273 --> 01:51:48,253
- Move! Move!

1617
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:50,255
lam never setting foot in the
toddy shop again!

1618
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:52,290
The questioning is going on

1619
01:51:59,253 --> 01:52:01,824
- I need to talk to Joy for 5 minutes
- Ok

1620
01:52:02,089 --> 01:52:04,069
Go on. He is inside

1621
01:52:33,954 --> 01:52:36,434
mm
m

1622
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:38,470
That's why I came

1623
01:52:38,559 --> 01:52:40,505
its

1624
01:52:40,895 --> 01:52:43,171
Unfortunately you won't be around to
see it, Joy

1625
01:52:46,834 --> 01:52:50,008
But you also won't be around
to raise it...

1626
01:52:50,071 --> 01:52:52,051
...will you, my dear Priest?

1627
01:52:55,943 --> 01:52:57,923
Maybe they will take will take me
away now

1628
01:52:59,513 --> 01:53:01,493
But if I have committed this murder...

1629
01:53:02,483 --> 01:53:04,463
...you were the one to bury him.
Right?

1630
01:53:06,254 --> 01:53:08,234
You have to follow behind me,
won't you, Father?

1631
01:53:10,324 --> 01:53:12,304
You are the one who has to preserve
his own head, Joy

1632
01:53:13,127 --> 01:53:15,107
But mine?

1633
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:18,110
That is taken care of by the Lord!

1634
01:53:18,298 --> 01:53:20,403
What you showed me that day...

1635
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:22,581
...did n't a few things happen before
that too?

1636
01:53:23,137 --> 01:53:25,117
Take a look at this

1637
01:53:41,355 --> 01:53:43,232
You got there first...

1638
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:46,396
...because you were so sure I would
come and dig up the pit!

1639
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,069
Damn your video recording!

1640
01:54:22,997 --> 01:54:25,568
I said I'd have you on a cross before
the next rain

1641
01:54:25,666 --> 01:54:27,646
Vincent means what he says!

1642
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:42,323
Wm]

1643
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:44,326
...who was breaking the lights at night

1644
01:54:44,452 --> 01:54:47,365
He suggested we set up a camera

1645
01:54:47,488 --> 01:54:50,992
You know... on the jack tree there

1646
01:54:51,625 --> 01:54:54,299
We got the footage out today

1647
01:54:54,394 --> 01:54:56,374
And we were looking at it when...

1648
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:59,343
...we saw this! We were so shocked,
Father!

1649
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,438
lam still shaking... Aren't you, lad?

1650
01:55:17,918 --> 01:55:19,898
The Lord commands and the Priest obeys!

1651
01:55:27,928 --> 01:55:29,271
<i>JOY"</i>

1652
01:55:30,931 --> 01:55:32,911
Didn't you kill Lissie too, Joy?

1653
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:45,190
- Lissie?
- Huh?

1654
01:55:47,515 --> 01:55:49,495
I want my child

1655
01:55:55,756 --> 01:55:59,363
This thing...

1656
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:02,074
...a third person should not come
to know

1657
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:08,547
So it's better you die!

1658
01:56:11,438 --> 01:56:13,418
And I Will kill him too

1659
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:23,651
Honey... honey... I lied...

1660
01:56:24,485 --> 01:56:27,227
I just... said it to win the argument

1661
01:56:30,224 --> 01:56:32,204
That's the truth! Believe me,
please!

1662
01:56:40,234 --> 01:56:42,180
I was just really angry

1663
01:56:44,472 --> 01:56:47,180
imam

1664
01:57:10,764 --> 01:57:12,744
I think she said it to save herself,
Father

1665
01:57:14,568 --> 01:57:16,548
Or else why would she say
E
dhose's name?

1666
01:57:18,038 --> 01:57:20,018
She could have named a
stranger

1667
01:57:22,676 --> 01:57:25,316
You still didn't say whether you killed
her or not, Joy

1668
01:57:35,323 --> 01:57:37,303
I killed her, Father

1669
01:57:39,493 --> 01:57:41,473
When I unexpectedly heard all that...

1670
01:57:47,301 --> 01:57:49,281
The water she drank was poisoned

1671
01:57:51,839 --> 01:57:53,819
It was after that she said...

1672
01:57:55,309 --> 01:57:57,289
But I heard her name another guy,
didn't I?

1673
01:57:57,878 --> 01:57:59,858
I wanted my child

1674
01:58:01,315 --> 01:58:03,295
That's why

1675
01:58:04,151 --> 01:58:06,131
...even though I wasn't sure, I...

1676
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:09,768
killed... Eldhose too...

1677
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,366
Father...

1678
01:58:14,428 --> 01:58:16,169
...
 did all this...

1679
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:18,710
...so my child would never know

1680
01:58:20,801 --> 01:58:22,280
She...

1681
01:58:24,605 --> 01:58:26,585
...shouldn't ever know

1682
01:58:41,188 --> 01:58:43,532
- What's going on, Sir -Will anything
happen before the toddy shop shuts?

1683
01:58:43,624 --> 01:58:45,604
- Move away, you!
- Let us see him too, Sir

1684
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:49,640
- Just move! - There he comes!
- Look at him!

1685
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:52,540
(crowd murmuring)

1686
01:58:53,167 --> 01:58:55,147
Hey you! Move! Make way!

1687
01:58:58,206 --> 01:59:00,186
Come on, move!

1688
01:59:01,708 --> 01:59:03,688
- What are you trying to see?
-Just move!

1689
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:11,430
Move! Move away!

1690
02:00:05,973 --> 02:00:08,510
Father... I need to Confess...

1691
02:00:31,932 --> 02:00:36,347
lam an invincible fire

1692
02:00:41,642 --> 02:00:45,886
I hold the flames of battle,
within me

1693
02:00:51,485 --> 02:00:55,524
<i>Kimmy</i>

1694
02:00:55,923 --> 02:01:00,429
To destroy the darkness of injustice

1695
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,442
Earth-shattering roars...

1696
02:01:10,538 --> 02:01:12,711
...are heard here

1697
02:01:13,007 --> 02:01:15,453
Up to the skies...

1698
02:01:15,509 --> 02:01:20,288
...tidal waves are rising, here

1699
02:01:20,348 --> 02:01:22,487
This day..

1700
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:24,722
...and through the darkness
of the night..

1701
02:01:24,785 --> 02:01:26,765
Like a tornado...

1702
02:01:26,821 --> 02:01:30,394
...
 sweep through

1703
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:41,071
lam an invincible fire

1704
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:50,782
I hold the flames of battle
