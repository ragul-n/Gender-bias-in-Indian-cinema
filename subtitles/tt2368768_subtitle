1
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,534
Mr Marumakan
[Son-in-law]

2
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,392
Our Ottapalam branch has
failed to follow up the measures...

3
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,664
...suggested by the debit
recovery assessment committee

4
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,904
...against some people who have
not paid the arrears to the bank

5
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:18,941
Mr Buburaj of Ambalakara
Capital and interest totals Rs 3.78 lakhs

6
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,783
Ashokraj, owner of
the Bharathakala drama troupe

7
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,380
...Rs 97 lakhs which includes
capital + interest

8
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,921
Rs 55 lakhs liability for
just a drama company, eh?

9
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,690
lt's notjust any drama company
lts 'dramascope'

10
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,392
Helicopters land on stage
Vehicles scream across live

11
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,833
Banshees come
Scare people...oooh!

12
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:43,370
Action must be taken against
those who haven't repaid bank loans

13
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,444
That's the responsibility
of a bank manager

14
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,179
lt's not that l don't want to, sir

15
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,909
l am unable to even put up
a recovery notice on the Ambalakaras

16
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,915
They resort to goondaism

17
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,853
Our staff has been driven away often
by the owner Ambalakara Baburaj

18
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,119
He always uses swear words
And is stone drunk

19
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,386
That's a lie, sir

20
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:07,330
He doesn't touch a drop when asleep
Neither does he utter a word in that state

21
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,403
Details in these records
show him to be very educated

22
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,064
He holds a Masters degree
in Business admin from London

23
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,142
What does it matter when
his bank loan is so huge?

24
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,734
Mr Vijayan we have to
go in for legal action

25
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,746
We can seek help from
the panchayat president...

26
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,213
...and local police

27
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,688
Chakravarthi?

28
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,226
He's ready with his make-up on

29
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,817
l must see him right now

30
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,826
No, you can't

31
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,659
He will be in his world of dreams
for the next 10 minutes...

32
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,393
...after wearing
his costume and make-up

33
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,133
And that means?

34
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,294
lf he becomes a star
in movies after this...?

35
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,430
- lf so?
- And if he becomes a hero

36
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,767
- Gets many national awards
- lf he does?

37
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,313
That is his dream
Ashoka Chakravarthy's dream

38
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:34,081
Samurai, the star of stars,
here he comes Megharoopan

39
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,954
Like a melody filled with feelings
he's one of our own

40
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:43,825
Like a bosom friend, a magician
who created a rainbow for us

41
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,765
To the earth, sky, land, home
he is our darling hero

42
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:58,243
Samurai, the star of stars,
here he comes Megharoopan

43
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,886
A new performer on the silver screens
The new wave in story-telling

SAMURAl

45
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,290
An arena of knowledge and comprehension
like a golden glow glamour and ostentation

46
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,861
SAMURAl

47
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,808
The stage where new expressions,
dialogs with humor diverse are born

48
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,678
Continues yet anotherjourney
as you create a new history

49
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:41,709
Oh herol With thunderous applause
With music, welcome with warm accord

50
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:51,229
Samurai, the star of stars,
here he comes Megharoopan

51
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:29,400
A treasure house of art and acting
A face that stands out in movies

52
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,435
SAMURAl

53
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:39,269
The player of young hearts
youthful hero of the heavens

54
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,873
SAMURAl

55
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,751
Creating waves in campus-soul
Waves that touch Kerala whole

56
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:53,349
Occupying dreams of young damsels
Lord Krishna who danced on river Kalindi

57
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,419
Many greetings with auspicious rhythms
ln roles varied welcome him wholeheartedly

58
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:07,629
Samurai, the star of stars,
here he comes Megharoopan

59
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:12,708
Like a melody filled with feelings
he's one of our own

60
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:17,647
Like a bosom friend, a magician
who created a rainbow for us

61
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,414
To the earth, sky, land, home
he is our darling hero

62
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:34,889
SAMURAl

63
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,800
Oh God! He's fainted
smelling his own cap

64
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,309
Hey policeman!
Policeman?

65
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,971
ls the shooting over?
l mean has the drama begun?

66
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,105
Yes, it has!

67
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,913
Bank officers with policemen
have gone to your brother's factory

68
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,988
...to legally confiscate that property

69
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,955
Knowing your brother, it will only
end in arguments and a fist fight

70
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,927
Finally he might even be
behind bars for murder

71
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,955
Oh Lord! He was totally drunk
when l called him some time back

72
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,966
lf the officials meet him now...!
What shall l do!

73
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,969
Gopi sir?

74
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,966
Please begin the show
half an hour later, okay?

75
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,666
- Sure
- l am taking this vehicle also

76
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,036
- Aren't you coming?
- Surely not!

77
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,941
l'll deal with you
when you want a favor, okay?

78
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,876
When the laborers toil
turning blood to sweat...

79
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,972
...and employers earn in millions

80
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,019
ls it wrong if a worker
demands his salary and bonus?

81
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,349
Labor union zindabad!

82
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,016
Go and paste that recovery notice
Let me see who objects

83
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:38,895
Hey!

84
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,060
l am Visvambaran

85
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,139
Zonal Manager
State Bank Of Malabar

86
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,005
l am Babu, Baburaj
Also called Ambalakara Babu

87
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,137
You have not repaid
the loan availed from our bank

88
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,078
We are forced
to take legal steps

89
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,207
Please co operate

90
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,914
ln return, it'll be better
if you co operate with me

91
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,923
Employers who profit in millions
Down with them!

92
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:06,923
He's picked up a stone

93
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,221
- Drop the net
- These rascals

94
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,022
Mr Baburaj, what's all this?

95
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,964
Did you hear what he said?
He claims l am making millions

96
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,002
Doesn't that vagabond realize
that if did, l'd repay my loans?

97
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,298
The bank doesn't
need to know all that

98
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,303
Of course you should

99
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,035
This lorry is loaded with
the 1st product from my factory

100
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:29,740
These vagabonds have not allowed
a single load to go from here since 1 year

101
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,874
lf this had reached
the market on time...

102
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,248
...you wouldn't have come
here at all with this notice

103
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,257
Political vagabonds like him
aid workers to harass the owners

104
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,088
They stand by bank authorities
in cases of attaching properties

105
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,092
...never ever allowing
people to prosper!

106
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,153
You may have your arguments
but the bank must recover its money

107
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,632
Okay, the bank can take
that entire lorry load

108
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,259
...boil it and eat it

109
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,132
You can have some
machines too as accompaniments!

110
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,264
We are here to attach
collateral securities

111
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,706
Not some rusted products

112
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,072
lf you play with
my personal property...

113
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,373
l'll chop your head
and deposit it in the bank

114
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,277
Don't you dare speak rudely to him!

115
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,713
What will you do if l did?

116
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,957
Hey! What do you think
You can do as you please?

117
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,696
- Let me go!
- Stop it!!!

118
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,265
Cheyl Did l bungle it?

119
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,678
He must be arrested, sir

120
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,181
He is resorting to goondaism
when asked to pay back his loans

121
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,012
Hey listen!

122
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,678
l took the loan from the bank
Not your mother in law

123
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,085
- l'll beat the daylights
- Hey! Stand this way

124
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,055
- l said stand here
- He's fully drunk, sir

125
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,992
Sure l am!
Totally drunk!

126
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:54,726
The bars and beverage shops here
are places to booze not of worship

127
00:13:55,134 --> 00:14:00,231
We shall discuss all that later
Mr Baburaj! Get into the jeep 1st

128
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,237
Go!

129
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,069
Move away
White cockroach!

130
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,302
Sir, don't allow him to go

131
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,002
- This guy...
- You shut up!

132
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,907
Are you pointing
accusative fingers at the law?

133
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,039
Get away from here

134
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,216
Excuse me,
what's your name?

135
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,343
Vishvambaran

136
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,019
Come with me
Come, come

137
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,085
We have a shut down
factory on 1 side

138
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,685
On the other side
workers on strike

139
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,127
And to top it all
orders to confiscate

140
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,165
Anyone will go mad

141
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:31,192
You go back for now
l'll explain everything to him

142
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,634
- Give him some time
- But...sir

143
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:34,763
Oh thank you!

144
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,105
What l mean to say is
anyone can become a lunatic

145
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,771
But can a lunatic
already mad become mad?!

146
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,045
Why are you falling
all over him in respect?

147
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,709
Well he's a police officer
That too lPS

148
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,717
We must obey him

149
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,219
He's not a police man

150
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,153
He's Ambalakara Babu's
younger brother

151
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,155
Ashokan

152
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,419
Ashoka Chakravarthy
The drama artiste

153
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,218
Not bad!
A good actor after all

154
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,790
But he is oblivious to whom
he has shown his acting prowess!

155
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:10,665
l've gone past 4-5 pegs, da
Stop sipping yours and finish it

156
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,177
l am drinking this only for you

157
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,907
You'll never improve!

158
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,142
Enough! Stop it!
lt has gone past limits

159
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,220
Then don't continue

160
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,687
l'm talking about you not me

161
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,985
- Let me drink

- l will, l want to drink

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,818
Catch!

164
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,962
Celebrating your win

165
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,763
Then get ready for bad news
lsn't there any spicy snack?

166
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,700
No

00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,702
Tell us
What's the bad news?

168
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,774
Today's events
has hurt Visvambaran's ego

169
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:49,337
The bank has deputed an ombudsman
to carry out the attachment procedures

170
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,177
Ombudsman?

171
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,185
Yes, ombudsman, Balasubramanyan
A Brahmin from Palakkad

172
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:59,156
l don't care who he is
He steps in here l'll chop his feet

173
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,024
Hey! Sit there quietly
How is he responsible?

174
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,824
lf you hadn't interfered
he'd have destroyed me

175
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,332
l realize now that bank secrets
should never be divulged here

176
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,163
The remaining secrets
my dog will come and tell you

177
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,204
- Okay, you dog drink this now
- No! What???!

178
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,933
- l mean you drink this
- No l say!

179
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,371
Shakaranunni?

180
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,236
- Tell me the rest
- Pour out the rest

181
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,677
Here keep it

182
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,743
l will tell this only to you
Come with me

183
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,281
Balasubramanyam is very powerful

184
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,049
His verdict is almost
equal to a court verdict

185
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,281
His position is almost
that of a magistrate

186
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:38,227
He's powerful enough to either cut it
Or even write off the loan amount

187
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,764
He'll be here tomorrow from Chennai

188
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,197
- By flight?
- No by boat

189
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,665
Tell me! Seriously!

190
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:48,229
l am responsible to pick him up
and deposit him in the guest house

191
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,169
That you da!
Thank you!

192
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,970
Why thank me?

193
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:57,042
l accept the duty
allocated to you with pleasure

194
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,141
l go to receive him instead of you

195
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,152
What!?
lt will cost me my job

196
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,746
Job!
Our home is at stake

197
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,760
Shankaranunni! Tomorrow
it'll be me instead of you at the airport

198
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,337
Hey! Hold this for a second

199
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,181
Hello, l am Balasubramanyam
from Palakkad

200
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,051
Yes

201
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,652
Greetings, sir
May God bless...

202
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,192
What's your name?

203
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,124
Chakravarthy

204
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,423
- Sorry did you ask me my name?
- Yes

205
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,664
Shankaranunni

206
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,993
Aren't you the attender in the bank?

207
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,798
Yes sir, peon-cum-driver-cum...
Come, come...

208
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,999
Does a peon in a bank
come dressed in a dhoti?

209
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,838
l wore this to show
my respect for you, sir

210
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,271
How?

211
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:07,649
When l meet a person like you
l just unfold my dhoti in utmost respect

212
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,813
lf l wear a pant
will l be able to do that?

213
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,153
Won't it be vulgar?

214
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,816
Not bad at all!

215
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,027
You can pat me now, sir

216
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,617
Where is the car?

217
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,320
Welcome to lndia
l mean Kerala, sir

218
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,156
Sir, someone very close to me...

219
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,169
...took a loan from your bank
and is now facing confiscation

220
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,395
What's his name?

221
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,698
Mr Baburaj

222
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,109
What are you so deep in thought?

223
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,645
Ambalakara, factory owner, isn't it?

224
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,805
You recognize him, sir?

225
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,879
His brother, that rascal too
has a loan isn't it?

226
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,311
Don't you know him?

227
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,951
A drama artiste?

228
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,322
He's a simpleton, sir

229
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,419
He is a simpleton
and so is his brother

230
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,790
But that wasn't the report l got

231
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,662
He drinks and...Chey!

232
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,200
Sir, all those are pure lies

233
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,270
Sir, their situation is pitiable

234
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,000
l know them personally

235
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,665
He's a post graduate from London

236
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,074
He returned to lndia
to serve his motherland

237
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,772
The workers union
closed down his factory

238
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:18,687
The younger brother is all ready
to close down his drama troupe

239
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,289
That was when Visvambaran sir came
with his notice to attach the property

240
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,420
Desperate situations
demand desperate means

241
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,359
They retaliated
which affected our Visvambaran sir

242
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,432
lf their property and
home are confiscated...

243
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:36,834
...their parents and 5 sisters
will commit suicide en masse

244
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:46,648
You don't have to write off their loans
Just give them some time, please sir

245
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,047
Why are you so vehement
in supporting their case?

246
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,055
Sir, can't l plead for a good cause?

247
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,092
Let me go through their file in detail
l will see what can be done legally

248
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,361
Come out here, ombudsman!
You nutty brahmin!

249
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,924
What's that noise out there?

250
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,903
Must be some drunkard
Sir, you can be in your room

251
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,939
l will deal with him

252
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,306
Please, you can freshen up, eat ...

253
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,846
Oh my goodness!

254
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,415
Oh chakka...varty! Were you here?

255
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,243
l'm Chakravarthy!
Go from here without further noise

256
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,819
Don't utter a word you...!!

257
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,049
Be calm, l'm in the midst
of striking a deal with him

258
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,318
Don't kick up a fuss here

259
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,918
lf he comes to know
we are brothers, all is lost

260
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,688
Who is he?

261
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,855
What?

262
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,664
Oh Lord! He is the one
l was talking about

263
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,002
Sir, now that you realize the truth
Let's go, eh?

264
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,438
Who is he?

265
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,939
- He is the ombudsman
- Oh l see!

266
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,137
Listen you Brahmin!

267
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,340
lf you step into my factory
l'll knock your teeth off

268
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,416
No, you shouldn't do such things

269
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,674
What about a fishing rod?

270
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,609
Brother, get into the car

271
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,120
Stop! Let me see
what he'll do to me

272
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,817
What the heck
will you do, ombudsman?

273
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,291
Brother is a simpleton
Very simple

274
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,129
- lt's not him that's talking now
- ls it your father then?

275
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,629
lt's some dirty Rum talking

276
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,063
He won't bite even if you put
your finger in his mouth

277
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:08,963
He's very decent

278
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,433
Okay, put your finger in
Let me see

279
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,197
Not now, all that rum will come out

280
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,707
Why are you bowing your head to him?

281
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,408
Hey Brahmin! lf you interfere
in my family affairs, l'll kill you

282
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,778
Okay, then kill him
And then go to jail

283
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,422
Let everyone
in the family be satisfied

284
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,147
Come on, kill him and get going

285
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,320
Oh well! lts time let me go
l am in a hurry

286
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,656
Shall l leave Chakkra?

287
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,128
Chakravarthi!

288
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,391
Well, just say so

289
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,758
l understand this punch is for me

290
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,732
Come inside with me

291
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,167
Where the hell is the door?!

292
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,999
Let the bank go ahead
with its duty

293
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,811
We'll wind up everything
and brother can find a job

294
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,140
l shall also go practice law

295
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:04,316
l can live handling fraud cases
and earn a living at court

296
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:09,286
But l love art forms
and so gave it up

297
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,790
What's the use?
Father is the reason for all this

298
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,365
What has your father
got to do with this?

299
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,833
He got married
and we were born

300
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,871
lf not all this would
not have happened

301
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,172
That's true
What is your father's name?

302
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,211
A big name...Rajagopalan Thambi

303
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,076
Bharathakalakshetram
Rajagopalan Thambi

304
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,117
Bharatkalakshetram
Rajagopalan Thambi?

305
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:37,678
Ambalakkara Bharathakala...
But do you know him?

306
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,053
He also has a debt

307
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,855
What!? Father too has a loan?

308
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,256
No wonder we are like this

309
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,637
Sir, please come in

310
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,972
Avery good set up, eh?
Good enough as an asset to the bank

311
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,137
What do you gain
with a bank's assets?

312
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,239
Sit sir, l'll go call
the concerned owner

313
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,248
Go there, you can't hide
after taking loans

314
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,152
This is the loan-father
The father who's living on loans

315
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,994
- Hey you!
- Da!

316
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,365
Please don't pick up
a fight over this...please!?

317
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,830
- Balu!
- Thambi!

318
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,275
What's this, da?
You've become old

319
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,937
Why don't you dye?

320
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,345
Me? Dye? When l have
grown up fellows like this?

321
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,748
- He meant my brother
- You also

322
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,681
ls he the one
you were buttering up?

323
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,119
The Oo...ombudsman?

324
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,849
l see you are friends

325
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,724
lt was one word from him
that brought me here

326
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:50,727
Bharathkalakshetram

327
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,026
Heard? Bharathakalakshetram

328
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,156
l am the one maintaining it

329
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,131
Maintaining?
You are destroying it

330
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,360
Dad, don't spoil my image

331
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,102
- Ambika?!
- Ammaka?!

332
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,104
- What?
- Mother?!

333
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,935
Do you recognize him?

334
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,203
He's Balu

335
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,676
Remember, l always
talked about him

336
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,713
The Brahmin from Palakkad

337
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,881
What will you drink?

338
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,746
He doesn't drink

339
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,850
l'll have buttermilk

340
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,216
He'sjust the same
Not changed at all

341
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,846
Get him some buttermilk

342
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:23,960
Anyway, the situation old friends
have met is great...confiscation!

343
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,860
- This confiscation...
- Uncle has written off everything

344
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,932
Why is that?

345
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,127
Bro, come don't be shy
The bank has written off our loans

346
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,396
ls it?

347
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,933
Who has written off?
Why? And for what?

348
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,063
Oh so it's not, eh?

349
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,868
Look at them saying it
without batting an eyelid

350
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,873
Let me tell you something

351
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,943
You don't have to say anything

352
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,045
l don't want any
considerations from you

353
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,743
l have my own solutions
l only need a little time

354
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:51,346
l have a property in the town
lf l sell that, it will solve all this

355
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,721
l was just seeing how far
these fellows will go

356
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,761
This is father's nature
He never tells us anything

357
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,832
So our father has
saved our dignity, isn't it?

358
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,801
Oh! Who saved whose dignity?
l asked you a question

359
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,904
Okay, l am coming!

360
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,398
What? You want me to come?
l'll just come

361
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,803
Lunch is not ready yet
Wait there you, just wait

362
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,746
These are 2 rare pieces born to me

363
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,749
He means brother

364
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,409
Come, come

365
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,618
My only daughter, Rohini

366
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,381
- You have 3 kids right?
- Yes

367
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,024
But 5-6 daughters
yet to be married...

368
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,662
Father does not know

369
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,287
You mean you have sisters
without your father's knowledge?

370
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,732
Not that, l wasjust fibbing for
effect to get your sympathy

371
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,804
After all l am your friend's son

372
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,999
What are you studying for?

373
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,063
Completed my degree

374
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,838
1st rank holder
She's my hope for the future

375
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,977
Me too

376
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,274
His hope is not on her

377
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,746
But on the gold
she'll be married in

378
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:56,682
Why search for finance
when you have gold at home

379
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,757
Financiers deliberately
tempt you to take gold loans

380
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,952
She's my daughter-in-law, Meenu

381
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,359
Ateacher and belongs
to a very aristocratic family

382
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:13,301
Her family hunted
all over the world

383
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,772
...and finally found my son
as a husband for her

384
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,739
Babu

385
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,831
l just finished

386
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,937
Hey sit! You are yearning
for a couple of pegs, isn't it?

387
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,182
Don't be hasty
or you'll die starving

388
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,886
lt's father's day, you eat

389
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,947
We are yet to hear
about your friend's family

390
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,353
Haven't l told you?
He married an heiress

391
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,897
What else does he want?
Life'sjust a celebration

392
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,329
What's your daughter doing?

393
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:46,666
She finished fashion designing and
now in charge of the company...

394
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,829
See? Take lessons from that

395
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,364
She's only 18
This is called responsibility

396
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,976
lf you also had married an heiress
we'd also be in responsible positions

397
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,248
lf mother had married a millionaire
it would've been enough

398
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:07,087
A person's personality is not
judged by his financial position

399
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,125
The only thing l lost was
this friendship when l got married

400
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,896
l don't know
the actual reason for this

401
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,695
Today, l am not
the company you might seek

402
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,166
There is a yawning gap between us

403
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,361
What gap?

404
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,702
You won't understand that
l'll tell you a simple example

405
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,608
We've often discussed about
your daughter marrying my younger son

406
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,947
Do you think
that is possible today?

407
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,277
Will it?

408
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:41,817
No! That's the gap l mentioned
Come, let's wash our hand

409
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,825
Dad unnecessarily
has created a gap

410
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,056
He just destroyed my future

411
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,830
lf he had said it a bit cleverly
it would have happened

412
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,766
ls his head filled
with moonshine?

413
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,999
To accept someone as useless
as you as his son-in-law?

414
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,879
You are a fine brother
No wonder your factory shut down

415
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,118
Why are you so gloomy?

416
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:13,021
Didn't you ask me if l'd give
my daughter in marriage to your son?

417
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,691
l agree, 100%

418
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,062
Because he also
is an artiste like you

419
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:24,625
Awriter, creator of characters

420
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,661
l did not mean to hurt you

421
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:34,235
No, don't apologize
lt's not a happy life that l lead

422
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,342
l have enjoyed my daughter's company
only till she was 8 to 10 years old

423
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,614
Now she is with her mother

424
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,179
But don't you live together?

425
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,155
We haven't separated legally

426
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,162
My heiress wife has never
been able to accept me

427
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,265
Has not understood me

428
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,664
l too found it difficult
to live like them

429
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,662
Rajamallika

430
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,169
Rajas...Rajakokila's only daughter

431
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:09,177
She finds wealth and status
more important than me

432
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,976
- Keshu!?
- Yes, madam

433
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,052
Send the new Benz for service

434
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,919
The aircon in my room has a problem
Get it replaced

435
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,014
Shall l get it repaired?

436
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,618
l don't have the habit
of using repaired things

437
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:25,253
Where is lndu?

438
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,992
After my divorce l never bother
about my ex wife's whereabouts

439
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,968
You must! She has a right over you

440
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,868
Women have utmost priority here

441
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:35,598
lndhu?

442
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,935
l'm here, madam

443
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,635
- Where is mummy?
- She's having a sauna

444
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,803
Mummy, l'm going, bye

445
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,352
My dear
Eat your breakfast, my dear

446
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:53,948
A servant's duty is only
to get the breakfast on time

447
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,925
l will decide
whether to eat it or not

448
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,356
Bhavani, don't repeat this!

449
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,088
Hey brother?!

450
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,999
Oh! lt's that uncle's daughter
who's now in your dreams, eh?

451
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,967
Perpetual dreamer!

452
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,702
Will she have grown up?

453
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,071
l'm sure she has not!
She must be the same

454
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,337
Be quiet!

455
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,976
She's still the same
little girl of my memories

456
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,413
What's the idea, brother?
Love?

457
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:57,747
Hmm...childhood sweetheart after all
l feel like meeting her right now

458
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:08,125
Rajamallika has lost the casel
Rajamallika faces defeatl

459
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,791
What's all the celebration about?

460
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,063
Chief mechanic
Ramakrishnan won the case

461
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,001
The court verdict was in his favour

462
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,267
Driver! You carry on!

463
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,814
Good morning, madam

464
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,075
Why wasn't l informed about
the verdict of Ramakrishnan's case?

465
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,050
Sorry, madam

466
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,087
Where is that lawyer of ours?

467
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:34,124
He's studying the case to appeal
and didn't want to be disturbed

468
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,894
Mr Pannikker!

469
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,034
Under the circumstances, l humbly
pray for yourjustice, your honor...

470
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,298
Don't hang my client, please!

471
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,969
- Sorry, l thought l was in the court
- ldiot!

472
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,406
Thank you

473
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,341
Madam!

474
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,310
There goes my job
all because of a nap

475
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,914
Why did we lose the case
against Ramakrishnan?

476
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,922
l never imagined he had retained
a lawyer with such brains!

477
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,720
lf l'd known l would have
got us a cleverer lawyer

478
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,154
ls there anyone cleverer
than you, Pannikker?

479
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,126
Where were you
during the final arguments?

480
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,722
lt was the day Mega-star
Mamootty's movie was released

481
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,891
l went and saw the 1st show!

482
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,095
l am the new president
of his All Kerala Fans Association

483
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,309
You...are...dismissed!!!

484
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,154
Biddy! You've provoked a snake

485
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,989
That too, a poisonous,
vicious black cobra!

486
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,959
What's happened to your brother?

487
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,060
My dear man, what's wrong?

488
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,726
That vixen! She dared slap me

489
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,130
l'll make her beg
at my feet one day

490
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,329
You must!

491
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,639
She must realize
the severe loss of firing me

492
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,133
Yes, she must!

493
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,268
l will then proclaim
you are a 'man'!

494
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:05,146
What!? Did you have any doubt
even after sleeping with me?

495
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,046
l didn't mean that!

496
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,346
l was only expressing my angst!

497
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,415
Couldn't you have
slapped her back?

498
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,817
When a man slaps a woman
the case takes on a different hue

499
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,120
Haven't you heard...'molestation'?

500
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:20,823
Doesn't that Rajamallika have
a daughter who is most arrogant?

501
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,797
- Aworld beauty?!
- Yes she does!

502
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,664
She thinks the world spins
around her little finger

503
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,203
She is my target

504
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,398
Wow! You are
my true sister!

505
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,266
Rajamallika's daughter,
Rajalakshmi

506
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:36,814
Rajamallika, the stinking rich snob
who tramples men in utter contempt

507
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,782
Her daughter will be
our trump card to ruin them

508
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,920
Goodness! My head is
bursting with intelligence!

509
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,386
Suppose we see that a most vile
contemptible fellow comes into her life?

510
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,688
- Wonderful idea!
- Thank you

511
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,991
Just wait and see
how l shall avenge myself

512
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,655
l have to somehow find
such a vile fellow right away!

513
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,317
Ahl l just got a job

514
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,220
Look Shankaranunni!

515
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,219
Someone's running away
with our bag

516
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,087
Catch him!
Thief!

517
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,353
Move aside women!
Hindering my mission

518
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,835
Let it be safe here
Driver, it's me, let's go

519
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,034
- Police!
- l am not police

520
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,197
Aiyo! Thief! Police!

521
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,275
l am not a thief either
l am a porter

522
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,708
Just a coolie

523
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,279
Why did you run
with our suitcase?

524
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,712
Why did you then
keep it in this taxi?

525
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,249
We porters are habituated to this

526
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,409
When we see a suitcase
we are driven to take it

527
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,882
You can pay me
and go in this taxi

528
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,682
We don't want this taxi

529
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,856
Dai, these people
don't want your taxi

530
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,256
- Hey! He took off with our stuff
- Well you should have gone in it

531
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,989
Stop my boy, l have to
get back their suitcase

532
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,259
l'll be right back

533
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,031
You must be here when l return
with the suitcase, okay?

534
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,405
- Do they suspect l am a robber?
- Of course not

535
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,607
You can dismantle
this bike and sell its parts

536
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,771
- ls there anything in that suitcase?
- Let me see

537
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,974
Everything has a hole in it

538
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,346
Do they deal in 2nd hand
under wear business?

539
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,322
Oh Lord! Have they
come in search of me?

540
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,591
lsn't this our Vasuchettan?

541
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,188
He is the eligible
fellow l suggested

542
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,300
Oh so you are
a crooked fellow, eh?

543
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
No, actually l am on
the lookout for a crooked fellow

544
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,735
l will get you married to a girl
who is an heiress to millions

545
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,399
ls she your daughter or sister?
ls she in trouble? Pregnant?

546
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,406
Vasu! This fellow is
cheaper than cheap

547
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,210
The girl is his arch enemy's daughter

548
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,251
Cars, riches, bungalows everything
will be yours if you do as l ask you to

549
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,615
Then let's go right away

550
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,349
Doesn't matter
even if she's mother of 2

551
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,618
Things are not as easy as you think

552
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,160
- 1st you have to ensnare her
- Done!

553
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,695
She will never fall
for you with such looks

554
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,161
What do l lack?

555
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,893
- You lack most of everything
- That means nothing at all

556
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,334
l like your qualifications
But if the girl has to fall for you...

557
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:19,205
...your dress, your talk, your walk
everything has to change drastically

558
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,403
You have to look
like a millionaire, my boy

559
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,019
That robber took away
my most needed support

560
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,286
- What's that?
- My briefs!

561
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,954
What? So right now
you are not wearing...?

562
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,361
Correct! lt was all
in that bag he stole

563
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:41,898
Chey!

564
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,696
lt was sheer foolishness
hiring a room here

565
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,930
This is the place the Raja group
members frequent and play around

566
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,341
lf we stick around here l'll get
a chance to meet and know her

567
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,081
Look! Why don't we have
a couple of drinks before lunch?

568
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:02,050
Hello? Call later
l am in the midst of many meetings

569
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,383
Hi

570
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,352
Ladies and gentlemen
How old are you?

571
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,393
What?!

572
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:14,221
We seem to have met
somewhere, haven't we?

573
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,333
l never visit bus stands
railway stations or market places

574
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,697
l am a millionaire

575
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,771
They call me Hamsa, the rich man

576
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,394
Who?

577
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,161
Me, who else?

578
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,399
Sir, order please?

579
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,073
How can l run
when l'm talking to him?

580
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,074
Sir, your order

581
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,908
Please, let me order
go sit somewhere

582
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,175
Don't harass millionaires
like this, please!

583
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,080
Okay, okay!

584
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,080
Those fools have
not recognized me, l think

585
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,218
lsn't he the same fellow?

586
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,949
lt's him alright

587
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,094
Let's see how far
he goes with his act

588
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,786
My dear members of the Rose club

589
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,333
Where did that robber disappear?

590
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,162
Look there he is

591
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,739
To inaugurate this program...

592
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:04,110
...our lovable and revered
club president will soon be here

593
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,162
Thank you

594
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,233
Come, madam
This way

595
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,160
She's 55 years old
and look at her dress?!

596
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:30,972
Who's that?

597
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:35,043
An old dowager
being regally escorted in

598
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,146
Da! Look it's him

599
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,273
Catch him!

600
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,976
Haven't they gone?

601
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,986
Get away!
Hey! Leave me

602
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,829
Stop it!

603
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,799
You...!

604
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,335
What is the matter?

605
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,097
Didn't you see?

606
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,968
He has insulted
women in broad daylight

607
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,008
Who? Me?

608
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,177
These ladies have
destroyed my 'airport'

609
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:08,711
What?

610
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,008
My 'flight' will
never take off again!

611
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:11,945
Stop it!

612
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,644
lndhu, hand over these
vulgar fellows to the police

613
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,812
Charge a case on both of them

614
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:21,583
Madam, we do need
women empowerment

615
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,923
But you can't go around
accusing men as rapists

616
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,724
Let men also live
alongside in peace

617
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,958
For that we need
your co operation

618
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,363
Okay so what do
your highnesses want?

619
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:38,307
You protest vehemently against
prostitution and other women's issues

620
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,709
But at the same time women like you
please don't misunderstand me...?

621
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,371
Turn around right now?!

622
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,105
Haven't you crossed the age
when such attire should be worn?

623
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,152
Who do you want to impress
with all this paint on your face?

624
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,949
You idiot!
l'll get even with you!

625
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,952
You don't know
what our madam is capable of!!

626
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,184
lndeed? So tell me who she is!

627
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,122
Excellent!

628
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,594
This program may have stalled
But today l saw her cowering in fear

629
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,697
This fellow seems to be smart

630
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,096
lt will be to my advantage
to have him with me

631
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,164
Hi, you were great

632
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,828
You have proved yourself a man

633
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,735
We all knew it
as soon as he was born

634
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,869
We should be working together

635
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:12,840
What is your name?

636
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:13,841

Nothing so far
Looking out for ajob

00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,955
Usually you learn it as A B C D

643
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,092
You appear to have
gone in the wrong order

644
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:29,989
What about you?

645
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,220

Who is that girl?

Don't tell this to anyone

656
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,253
Why? ls she so bad?

The owner of this resort

659
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,953
What? You want to
marry Rajamallika?

660
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,893
No! Her only daughter Rajalakshmi

661
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,052
What nonsense
are you thinking?

662
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,284
Never try to control me
or my vehicle ever again!

663
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,155
Mind it!

664
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,033
Arrogant girl!
Who the heck is she?

665
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,100

Oh! Ombudsman!

677
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,934
Hey, Chakkavartti!

Chakravarthi

680
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,805
Ombudsman!

681
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,185
Uncle, why here?

682
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,650
Tell me why you are here

683
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,780
l came for some rest

684
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,325
Your father is highly stressed
You've been missing from home

685
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,026
Finally your sister
told me you were here

686
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,098
What are you doing here
with your mobile switched off?

687
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,027
Tell me the truth

688
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,398
He's come to see
his childhood sweetheart

689
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,000
Childhood sweetheart?

690
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,297
That book by Basheer
titled 'Childhood sweetheart'

691
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,276
...was out of stock at our place
Then he told me it was available here

692
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,141
Which bookstall was it?

693
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,841
ln his bookstall...where else
Your daughter is his sweetheart

694
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,945
Oh look how shy he's become

695
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,112
And playing hide and seek

696
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,746
Hey! l wish l could
disappear from here!

697
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,857
Why did you cover your face?

698
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,892
Answer him my boy

699
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,594
l feel shy

700
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,162
Why did you come
to meet my daughter?

701
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,662
l won't tell

702
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,288
l will tell you, sir

703
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,992
He likes your daughter very much

704
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,071
l told him to see
the girl 1st and then decide

705
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,038
lf she resembled you
we could simply return home

706
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,335
ls there anything wrong with me?

707
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,774
l don't have a face like yours
like that of a black monkey

708
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,312
Sir, what's the use of us
describing each other

709
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,642
Be quiet!

710
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,841
Uncle, just because
this fellow said all this

711
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,214
Uncle, don't take it seriously

712
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,220
Just because you are
my closest friend's son...

713
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,156
...l gave you certain liberties
but don't misuse it

714
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:25,160
Don't ever say
my daughter is not beautiful

715
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,163
Everyone thinks his or
her child is the best

716
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,596
So let's 1st see and then decide

717
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,757
l will show you

718
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,767
l will show you right now!

719
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,007
Oh Lord!

720
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,335
What is it?

721
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,266
l was forced to
meet your daughter

722
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,275
...in a most unexpected way

723
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,074
ls it?

724
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,706
Hi friends!

725
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,809
Hey, lawyer Chakravarthi

726
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:53,255
l've just got some news
that will be extremely useful to us

727
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,723
There's a vacancy
in the Raja's group of factories

728
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,885
ls it for Sundays?

729
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,689
Be quiet!
What vacancy?

730
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,061
They said something...some...word
l don't remember...

731
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,326
Something like adversary?

732
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,890
- Legal advisor
- Yes, that is it

733
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,768
Since l studied in London
l don't know such cheap words

734
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,635
Look, you have to somehow
get into their good books

735
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,232
l will then play my game

736
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,836
How will my getting in
help you to play games?

737
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:20,109
You have to constantly
praise me to Rajamallika

738
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,218
You have to tell them
about my millionaire status

739
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,344
You have to propose marriage
on my behalf to their daughter

740
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:28,284
You have to influence them
to get her married to me

741
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,620
And?

742
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,962
You'll soon see me
living like a prince

743
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,324
- Who is this new character?
- Father

744
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,732
l knew it, you look
so much like each other

745
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,803
After my marriage
l'll give you a promotion also

746
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,933
Just take care
you are not promoted tojail

747
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,111
This fellow will be
your downfall, always

748
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,375
l mean he'll defeat
all your well laid plans

749
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,209
Any way l take leave
Bye the bye!

750
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,150
Aiyo! Wrong way to go!!!

751
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,847
- Who is he?
- He's a fraud

752
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,619
Why do you tolerate such fellows?

753
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,118
Sorry! l forgot the route l came in
Don't repeat it, eh?

754
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,163
He's come with intentions
for your daughter in mind

755
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,632
There is an enemy
lurking behind him

756
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:17,264
Lets play his game
till we find that culprit

757
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,672
Anyway l agree with
1 suggestion he gave

758
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,938
You should somehow
get into their Company

759
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,377
You should get
closer to my wife

760
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:28,243
Their bad up bringing has made
my daughter too an arrogant girl

761
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,980
You should turn her
into a well behaved girl

762
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,846
l want my daughter back

763
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,182
Okay, l'll attend the interview

764
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,925
Please!

765
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,691
Good morning

766
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,392
Sit, please

767
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,027
Thank you

768
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,602
Your name?

769
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,965
Ashok Chakravarthi

770
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,971
Your credentials
says Ashok Raj

771
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,033
l had got it changed
A copy is there in the file

772
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,941
Why did you change your name?

773
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,674
l believe the name is
the 1st step in impressing people

774
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,224
For example, superstar Rajinikanth
lf his name had been Kandan Koran

775
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,292
Just think of it

776
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,624
lnstead of saying super star Rajini
Super star Kandan...!

777
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,591
lt would've been terrible for him

778
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,101
When l adopted the great
King Ashoka's name...

779
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,234
...my confidence level increased

780
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,671
How many strands of hair
will an intelligent man have on his head?

781
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,870
Hair? You mean hair?

782
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:34,816
Do you mean people
like Archimedes and Galileo?

783
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,113
Or is it someone like
Bharat Gopi, an artist

784
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,746
lf so these people have
sparse hair in spite of intelligence

785
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,882
Or if you mean someone
like Sai Baba, with plenty of hair

786
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,893
lf you are smartjust talk
about your own hair

787
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,021
My hair?
Okay, you can note it down

788
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,901
Ah! 836333 is the number
of hair l have on my head

789
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:02,975
How can you be so precise?

790
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,206
lf you have any doubts
you can start counting

791
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,283
You madam can begin in front
and you from the back

792
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,012
You can divide it
into sections and count

793
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,214
Shall l make it easier for you?
Shall l sit or lie down

794
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,717
Don't ask such
stupid questions

795
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,798
Mr Ashok Chakravarthi

796
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,926
As an advocate
what if you lose a case?

797
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,728
l will not lose

798
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,740
As an adept lawyer
who has mastered law

799
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:36,006
...l can spot a winner or a loser

800
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,172
Why should l accept a loser, huh?

801
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,806
Correct

802
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,112
This is a lawyer's smartness

803
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,313
lf one uses words with dexterity
one gains applause

804
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,255
There was nothing here to clap for

805
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,126
My answer was
not at all satisfactory

806
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,128
Just a clever wordplay
of what's right

807
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:59,327
With truth as a weapon
dissecting law points

808
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,336
...you can win any case

809
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,099
That much l am confident

810
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,233
You are appointed

811
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:07,677
Thank you, madam

812
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,110
Hello, my dear

813
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,676
Catch it

814
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,209
Hey, not bad, eh?

815
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,047
What's your name?

816
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:17,916
Minmini

817
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,147
Minnaminingi?
(fire fly)

818
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,214
Give this to madam

819
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:26,993
Chimney?
l mean Minmini, you are good

820
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:32,596
lf l am made Managing Director
l will also have a bedroom here

821
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,060
Why are you here?

822
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,638
This will be my place hereafter

823
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,267
This is the place
Pannikar sir used to sit

824
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,641
lf l am MD here, Pannikar sir
will return to his position

825
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,978
Oh! So Pannikar sir
has sent you here, eh?

826
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:50,850
Hmmm...No!
l came on my own

827
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:55,318
- l am a little busy
- l am not at all busy

828
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:59,023
l will decide what
your job is hereafter

829
00:49:59,129 --> 00:49:59,959
What is that?

830
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,394
Praising me

831
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:06,191
You must sing praises
about my good conduct

832
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:11,741
...my wealth and that l'm bigger
than Ambani, to your lady boss

833
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:16,176
She should then crave
to make me her son-in-law

834
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,809
- May l come in?
- Yes please

835
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,940
There is one more coming in

836
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,082
Please take your seat

837
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,813
No, l just ate

838
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:25,819
Come and sit here

839
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,190
Oh, l was asked to sit?

840
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,087
Tea or coffee?

841
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,353
Strong tea, that has not been
poured up and down like this

842
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,589
- Less sugar, okay?
- Okay

843
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,588
Madam, he wants to be
introduced to you

844
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,066
- Sure
- l am Hamsa

845
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,099
No...Hamsan
Hamsan MBBS

846
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,765
- Oh, a doctor?
- No a lawyer

847
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,569
Why should only
you be a lawyer!

848
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,205
Go on, say the rest

849
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,873
He's a rich millionaire

850
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,215
Almost as big as Ambani

851
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,979
More than Ambani

852
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,181
Oh with this year's
financial reports

853
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,347
...he's a richer than Ambani

854
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,092
He owns many factories,
hotels, resorts

855
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,992
He even owns the reserve bank

856
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,191
3 of them

857
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,790
- You mean 3 reserve banks?
- Yes, of course

858
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,200
1 is in Nedumangad
and the other in Kakanad

859
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:20,243
He asked me to praise him to you

860
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,210
Why?

861
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,248
He wants to marry
your only daughter...

862
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:30,684
...sit in that chair, and said
he'd kick you out from here

863
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:31,811
Right?

864
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:37,258
Madam, don't believe this fellow
He's a fraud

865
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,691
l will fall at your feet
and beg forgiveness

866
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:39,819
Just lift the saree a bit

867
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,257
l can't see your feet otherwise

868
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,663
Throw him out!

869
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,360
Go ahead and play
with that elephant

870
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,365
l will get back
Just you wait!

871
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,979
- Good morning, madam
- Very, very good morning

872
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,782
- You wanted to see me urgently?
- Yes, l did

873
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,641
Do you know them
Mr Ashok Chakravarthy?

874
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,285
Yes or no?

875
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,812
Yes

876
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,221
You are dismissed!

877
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,087
Madam

878
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:48,256
You! lt's of no use
Madam can't do a thing

879
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,357
Because my grand ma
is more powerful than her

880
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:56,368
- To tell you the truth
- No!

881
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,071
- What happened frankly
- No!

882
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,297
Both of you decline?!

883
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:03,710
There has been
no man in history

884
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,748
...to control or punish
me and my little one

885
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,579
Oh, so that is the whole
problem of your life-story

886
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,982
l say, you get out!

887
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,277
Lakshmi

888
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,657
Don't think it will stop with this

889
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:31,768
Aiyo! All gone
You wounded a snake, da!

890
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,241
- So you were the traitor
- Yes indeed!

891
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,336
l come in different
forms of betrayal

892
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,975
l set you up here

893
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,314
Now, l got you
thrown out from here

894
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,247
Madam, let me...

895
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,348
Aunty...

896
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,652
Aunty?
Get lost

897
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,265
What a pity!

898
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,337
Hey, Minmini?
Whatjustice is this?

899
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,599
Should they not inform me
before dismissal

900
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,368
Should they not listen
to my explanations?

901
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,133
- l can
- Not you, they should

902
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:08,870
They will not

903
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,675
Madam never goes back
on her decisions

904
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,874
They must show some patience

905
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,214
There is no such
word in her dictionary

906
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,086
Oh l see! Then, only after
it is included in her dictionary...

907
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,682
...shall this Chakravarthi (King)
remove his crown!!!

908
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,167
Hey! Move your vehicle

909
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,299
l don't have the strength

910
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,640
- lt's madam in there
- Which madam? Move aside

911
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,374
- Good morning, Minimini
- What's all this?

912
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,583
Madam has to reach
office on time

913
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,584
But you said
she has no patience

914
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:50,914
Please go and call madam

915
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,852
Go and call her

916
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:57,583
Madam won't get out, eh?
Then l shall get out

917
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,260
Madam

918
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,296
What the heck do you want?
Move your vehicle away

919
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,366
- Didn't you hear what madam said?
- You shut up

920
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,362
Let the tail not wag
when the head is there

921
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,569
- Tail?
- Madam, relax

922
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,228
- l want to talk to you in person
- l don't have time

923
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,567
l have time to
spare only now

924
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,163
Keshu, call the police

925
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,105
- Do you want the number?
- l know it

926
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,369
Madam

927
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,609
By the time they come here
after manipulating traffic

928
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,806
...it will be almost 3 hours

929
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,348
l need only 5 minutes

930
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,606
Then tell me what is it?

931
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,743
Not here, let's go sit
at home and talk

932
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,084
Not possible do you know
the value of my every minute

933
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,020
Then why are we wasting it here?

934
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,614
Come, come

935
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,817
ldiot!

936
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,790
This looks like a palace
set for a drama

937
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,196
What do you want to say?

938
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,599
Can't you ask your guest to sit?

939
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:41,871
Just tell me

940
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,734
What l intend to tell
sitting here won't be proper

941
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,740
...if you continue to stand

942
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,070
So l too will stand

943
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,269
You just tell me the matter

944
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,573
Only if l sit
l can tell

945
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,613
Look every minute is expensive

946
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,877
Ask me to sit, please

947
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:23,977
Can l?

948
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,780
No, not comfy

949
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,653
- Now, it is okay
- Tell me what the matter is

950
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,857
l am here for the 1st time
Let's have tea and talk

951
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,105
Now tell

952
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,641
Don't get all bothered

953
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,803
Let us drink tea
lt'll give energy

954
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,617
Hi! Grandma, so sweet

955
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,209
When madam gets angry...

956
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,948
...her face becomes all red
and her beauty vanishes

957
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,684
But grand ma is grand...

958
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:13,661
...when mad she reddens
like a tomato, really beautiful!

959
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,129
Lord! She needs
protection from evil eyes

960
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:20,360
Ah! Were you here?

961
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,164
l have seen only one other
person like this...superman

962
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,174
With briefs over the pants?

963
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,675
- Are you super girl?
- You...!

964
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,043
Why don't you wear
dress that suit you?

965
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,910
Don't you ever look
into the mirror?

966
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:39,384
Sorry, l got involved
talking to people l knew

967
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,624
A pure malayala simplicity
among all this ostentation

968
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,751
What is your name, mother?

969
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:45,691
Bhavani

970
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,626
Bhavaniamma
Nice name

971
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,288
Drink your tea
and come to the point

972
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,367
The tea is too hot

973
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,693
- Will you tell me or not!?
- Sure

974
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,162
Lovely tea!
Who made it?

975
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,240
- l did
- ls it?

976
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,935
- Do you make it every day?
- Bhavani, go inside

977
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,712
Madam, don't leave,
let me explain

978
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:05,372
This is my tea, please

979
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,014
Don't drink from it
Okay, grandma?

980
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,955
Madam, please sit
l can say it only when you sit

981
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,853
Now tell me what is it
that's going to affect my life

982
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:22,721
Are you aware of the word
'patience' in the dictionary?

983
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,627
No? lt's there in
the English dictionary

984
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,929
lf you don't have it
you could turn into a patient

985
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,267
A mental patient

986
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,871
So a little patience
is necessary for everything

987
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,736
lt is possible if you try

988
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:42,851
l came to test
and tell you that

989
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:43,916
You...!

990
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,257
Patience!

991
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,951
lt's as good
as mutton soup

992
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:09,035
You taught her patience?
What am l hearing?

993
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,248
My daughter is
a very simple girl

994
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,750
Uncle, don't crack jokes
while eating

995
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,320
What's the joke in that?

996
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:22,221
As far as l know your daughter
is not a human child

997
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,952
She's a ferocious tigress

998
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,288
Did you hear that, sir?

999
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:30,059
And you were thinking of
making him your son-in-law!

1000
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:30,928
Shankarnunni!

1001
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,265
l am now his ally and won't abet
in anything which will harm him

1002
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,099
Sir, can l serve
some more of this?

1003
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,833
Hey Mr cook, don't
turn into advisor, okay?

1004
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,376
Uncle, please tell me before
you give him a permanentjob, okay?

1005
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,843
l've already made him
permanent here

1006
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,471
What about his bankjob?

1007
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,081
That's going on excellently
because of his absence

1008
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,817
Then shall l get
the dough ready for dinner?

1009
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,185
Go, do it quickly

1010
00:59:56,492 --> 01:00:02,328
l have only 1 sorrow
when l think of my daughter!

1011
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,357
Uncle, take heart

1012
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:10,372
We'll cure the arrogance in her
Everything will be all right, uncle

1013
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:20,739

1019

With looks like a heavenly nymph
A she-devil when crossed

1020
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,939
Oh my girl, who looks like a little drum
l'll break you, don't dance too much

1021
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:55,974
You are trouble from head to toe
l oppose you with my bow and arrow

1022
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:01,079

That's itl You shrew
Haven't you seen enough?

1024

Just a look will suffice

1032
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:16,696
'Money bags' woman with horns
Queen of arrogance

1033

Apint sized hot rowdy

01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,399
You are a cart of log
that can't be hewn

1043
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:31,105
The one who knows no modesty
Who does not play by rules of the game

1044
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:36,235
To defeat you in your game
l just have to snap my finger

1045
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:41,112
One as young as a tender sugar cane
One who has lost her grip

1046
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:45,245
Setting out to cut the branch
you are sitting on most stubbornly

1047
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:50,087
You are trouble from head to toe
l oppose you with my bow and arrow

1048
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:55,290
Turning it into a duel
Like a volcano

1049
01:03:55,398 --> 01:04:00,301
That's itl You shrew
Haven't you seen enough?

1050
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:05,966
To bring down your style
hereafter shall be my struggle

1051
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:11,344
One who wears the skin of a doe
Ferocious as a tigress in anger

1052
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,080
Female fowl
sit down to hatch

1053
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,816
Female fowls
have started to crow

1054
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,155
Female fowl
sit down to hatch

1055
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,854
Female fowls
have started to crow

1056
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,191
Female fowl
sit down to hatch

1057
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,926
Female fowls
have started to crow

1058
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,332
Female fowl
sit down to hatch

1059
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,300
Female fowls
have started to crow

1060
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,272
Who asked you to serve tea
and entertain this fellow in here?

1061
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,071
How can your anger on me
be shown on that poor woman?

1062
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,077
Bhavaniamma, please go inside

1063
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,841
Who gave you permission
to come in here?

1064
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:59,183
l didn't find any suitable
authority out there

1065
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:03,313
Hi! Grandma?
l didn't notice you

1066
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,026
Answer me! What is
your business here?

1067
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,688
There is a bill which
needs your attention

1068
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:09,594
What bill?

1069
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,001
Your darling daughter
and her arrogance created it

1070
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,229
Rs 50 000, if you pass it
l'll leave right away

1071
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,236
l don't understand

1072
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,102
ls he mentally ill?

1073
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,043
lf you come outside
l'll show you who is mentally ill

1074
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,078
Please come

1075
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,044
Come, run out, please

1076
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,513
Look at the condition of my jeep

1077
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,914
lt used to be as old and dignified
as Amitabh Bachchan(actor)

1078
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,714
Now it looks like Vadivelu(comedian)

1079
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:35,082
Your daughter drunk
with power of arrogance, did it

1080
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:39,091
Young man! How much
will this rickety old tin-can cost?

1081
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:42,961
Pay him its price and burn it, Mallika!

1082
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:48,026
Hey! You can't burn all that's old
Grandma, you are also...eh?

1083
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,695
Don't they say old is gold?

1084
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,530
lf you arrange the money
l can leave

1085
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:57,806
Mummy! Don't pay him a single pie
l did it because he was harassing me

1086
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,815
Oh l see! lf that's the case
don't waste time talking

1087
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,112
Clear out from here
with your tin-can

1088
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:08,723
Grandma! Tin-can?
This is a Benz for me

1089
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,223
True, it does not have papers

1090
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,987
But it's got a steering wheel and tyres

1091
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:15,586
Look, either you repair it
or pay me compensation

1092
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,059
Otherwise, l'll become
a different person

1093
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,863
Da! You don't realize who l am

1094
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,197
l know you are a woman for sure

1095
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:24,671
Even the Director General of Police
will come here, if l just make a call

1096
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,235
lf l make a call,
no one's going to come

1097
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,808
That's why l have
come all by myself

1098
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,142
Please take a decision and
pay me so that l can leave

1099
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,239
l will not pay you a single pie

1100
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,075
- You won't pay me?
- No!

1101
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,177
So you've decided

1102
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,687
...and my tension
that l'll get money is gone

1103
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,821
So let me leave, eh?
Grandmajust move a bit

1104
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:54,600
Poor fellow, quit in fear

1105
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,393
Total fulfillment!

1106
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,985
Almost like swearing
to your heart's content

1107
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,529
- Now let me leave
- To hell with you!!!

1108
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,025
l don't want it

1109
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,525
ls he coming to me?

1110
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,342
Hope you recognize me

1111
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:42,384
The big millionaire, MBBS, remember?

1112
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:45,147
Now do you realize
he's a trouble maker?

1113
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,381
He will soon be picked up
by the police

1114
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,754
l have called the DGP

1115
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,085
What's the use?
He'll give them the slip

1116
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:57,121
He doesn't need a lawyer
to bail him out...

1117
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,758
...since he's one, LBW

1118
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:06,966
He has a few extra bones
which my thugs will soon set right

1119
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,776
Bye the bye!

1120
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,277
Who is he to interfere
in our issues?

1121
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,073
What do we care!

1122
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,147
Have you started
selling ambassador cars?

1123
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,279
Or are they all stolen?

1124
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:58,451
l bought them as scrap
to be used in stunt scenes

1125
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,391
Fight?

1126
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,827
Let's discuss matters
without beating around the bush

1127
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,091
l've accepted the quotation
to kill offered by Rajamallika

1128
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,562
Hey guys?!

1129
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,731
Hey! You startled me!

1130
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,500
Won't you also
take part in this?

1131
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,743
- Me?
- Yes, only then it will be fun!

1132
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:15,867
Come on give it to him!

1133
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,742
l belong to your team

1134
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,248
Look at whom you are beating, buddy!

1135
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,956
He will definitely kill me

1136
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,733
You guys, finish him

1137
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,811
- Not bad
- Thank you, sir

1138
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,887
You can give a complaint
against them, l will do the needful

1139
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,290
- l'm not the one to give a complaint
- Why?

1140
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:41,723
A millionaire was being harassed
by a bunch of thugs, l just saved him

1141
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,525
Where is this poor millionaire?

1142
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,258
Millionaire...there he is!

1143
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,927
Hey mister!!
Come here

1144
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,534
Come

1145
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,333
l'll claim sickness
They won't clobber me then

1146
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,501
- Namaskaram, sir
- Come and stand here

1147
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,511
- Why did the thugs attack you?
- Me?

1148
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,569
Was it me they attacked?

1149
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,375
lf so tell them,
it's a different case then

1150
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,009
l need to escape, that's all
l have no complaints

1151
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,953
Wasn't it for you
l bashed up these fellows?

1152
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,183
Well, that complaint does exist!

1153
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,451
Then take it in writing from him

1154
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:13,392
- lf l do that, won't they be put in jail?
- Otherwise, you will go in

1155
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,123
Just sign here,
l'll write out the rest

1156
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,329
Okay thank you, let's go

1157
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,798
Why didn't you betray me?

1158
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:25,899
l am not only a lawyer
but a dramatist too

1159
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:30,168
We always find
such cunning twists

1160
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,110
...which we later use
to our advantage

1161
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,444
You will understand all this later

1162
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,778
Understand?

1163
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,761
l am Rajamallika

1164
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,232
Was it an inconvenience
coming here?

1165
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,169
lt's okay

1166
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,362
Mr Ram, please sit

1167
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,804
Excuse me
George

1168
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,975
These are infamous goons
of this city

1169
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:12,542
They were arrested for attempting
to kill a man in broad daylight

1170
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:16,018
A smart young man came
just in time to save him

1171
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,150
We'd otherwise have had to
file a case for attempted murder

1172
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:25,428
But these fellows claim that
they did it on your orders

1173
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,358
l don't deny it

1174
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:33,467
l had informed the DGP about
a guy who was harassing my daughter

1175
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,973
He is the one l want

1176
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,014
The same guy who
these men tried to kill

1177
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,087
George, take them away

1178
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,356
Tell me if you need more of this

1179
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:57,831
l don't accept bribes
Especially from you, madam

1180
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:04,268
Just 1 petition from
your daughter against him

1181
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:08,072
l'll have him picked up
and locked inside

1182
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,013
l am ASP Madhu Ram

1183
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,955
l have taken him into custody

1184
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,156
l will bring him there
for further proof

1185
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,227
No! l don't want to
see his hateful face

1186
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,296
He should remain
inside for 5-8 years

1187
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,298
l will see he does
with appropriate charges

1188
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:36,962
You can level any charge
but please release my head

1189
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,903
May l come in, sir?

1190
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,408
l am advocate K V Panniker

1191
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,978
l've come to bail out an accused

1192
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,048
- Who is the accused?
- He's between your legs

1193
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,982
Under what charge
has he been arrested?

1194
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:54,021
What is he accused of?
l must know all this

1195
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,420
Molestation
Harassing women!

1196
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:56,354
Molestation?

1197
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:01,863
Yes! This arrest is based on
a petition given by the girl herself

1198
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,862
Who is this girl?

1199
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,402
Vasanthi from the market
or Mary from the bus stand

1200
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,995
But they are not the kind
to give a complaint like this

1201
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,471
Sir, you must be mistaken

1202
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:17,409
No, it's the daughter of the MD
of Raja's group who has complained

1203
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,946
- Who? Rajalakshmi?
- Yes!

1204
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,344
ls it true, Hamsa?

1205
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:23,350
- l have no idea
- Sir, no bail for him

1206
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,320
Panikker sir?

1207
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,149
Listen to me
Give us a minute please?

1208
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,985
Come here, my boy

1209
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:32,390
Hamsa my boy, l never thought
you to be capable of molestation

1210
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,395
Other than to pee
in the last 3 months l haven't...

1211
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,590
Don't say anything more
You have definitely molested her

1212
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:43,133
You fool! This is a golden opportunity
to marry her, so just accept the charges

1213
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,402
Do you think any decent guy
will marry the girl you messed with?

1214
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,500
Why, am l so bad?

1215
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,876
No it's not that, but be sure
they will beg at your feet

1216
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,383
Sir, he has admitted
to his guilt on all charges

1217
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,817
His acts of molestation
were not once but 9 times

1218
01:15:58,887 --> 01:15:59,410
l stand witness to it

1219
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,115
This is the truth
the whole and only truth!

1220
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,990
News continues

1221
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:08,461
Daughter of the MD, Rajamallika of
Raja's group of companies was harassed...

1222
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,590
...and on the basis of a complaint
ASPMadhu Ram has arrested Chanda Hamsa

1223
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,027
...who has admitted to the charges

1224
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,466
What kind of a question is this?

1225
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:19,200
Would l be able to molest
the girl in various places?

1226
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:22,937
l have no count
of the number of times

1227
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:26,446
May be the girl would know

1228
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,817
lf the girl agrees
l can give her a life...

1229
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,862
- lndhu!
- Yes, madam?

1230
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,365
Who mans the main gate?

1231
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,600
All kinds of people
walk in without permission

1232
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,239
Madam...

1233
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,606
Dismiss him,
whoever was there today

1234
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,910
Stop right there, di!

1235
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,181
Hey mister, mind your words

1236
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,808
Disrespectful 'di'
is not tolerated here

1237
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,011
She is my daughter

1238
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,523
She is my wife and
we have not legally separated

1239
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,455
The whole world knows

1240
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,460
...that l opted to live away
unable to tolerate you

1241
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,594
So have you come
to renew that bond?

1242
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:19,959
No, but to save
the child born of that bond

1243
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,002
lf you want to avenge yourself...

1244
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,038
...it shouldn't be by ruining
your own child's future

1245
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,040
You don't have to lecture me

1246
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,406
l know how to
look after my daughter

1247
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,479
Lakshmi was not a divine birth

1248
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,312
Half...no three-fourth
is my responsibility

1249
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:41,185
Hey! Will you get out now
Or should l summon the DGP?

1250
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:45,248
ls he living on your charity
to come every time you call him?

1251
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:49,487
l am talking about
my daughter, not yours

1252
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,858
Do you really think she will get
a good proposal hereafter?

1253
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,995
No one needs to bother
about my future

1254
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,808
My dear, l am your dad

1255
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,509
A dad dreams of
a good marriage for his daughter

1256
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,877
lt is his responsibility also

1257
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,208
l have come to a decision

1258
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:14,311
l will find a boy who
will love and cherish her

1259
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:20,160
l will prove to you what
a father can do for his daughter

1260
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,041
Greetings, l am
ASP Madhu Ram's father

1261
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:35,973
Please sit

1262
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:41,972
My son has never committed
such a blunder in all these years

1263
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:45,150
His guilt is so strong
he doesn't eat or sleep properly

1264
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:50,113
What's his name?
Ah! Chanda Hamsa

1265
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:57,161
My son accused him of all kinds
of charges and brought him to court

1266
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,063
He will not get out for
another 3-4 years

1267
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,361
But that will not compensate
the trauma faced by your daughter

1268
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,438
l will come straight to the point

1269
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,844
My son would like
to atone for his mistakes

1270
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,146
You can enquire and find out

1271
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,586
...that our family is
in no way inferior to yours

1272
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,381
He is my only son

1273
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:27,891
lf you permit, why don't you
allow him to marry Lakshmi?

1274
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,391
But this sudden
decision of marriage...?

1275
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,956
Yes, she's too young

1276
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:37,333
lf the officer who handled her case
marries her the public will be convinced

1277
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,203
...of her innocence

1278
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:41,969
Think it over and
give me your opinion

1279
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,041
l take leave

1280
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:53,210
l don't think
we should blindly reject this

1281
01:19:53,955 --> 01:20:00,121
lf we have an lPS in the family
to do as per our bidding

1282
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:04,221
...it will be a matter of pride for us
l am convinced about it!

1283
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,180
Hey! Atsunami is on its way

1284
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,343
- Tsunami?!
- Yes

1285
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,217
This is no tsunami
lt's a volcano

1286
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,261
Hide

1287
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:50,139
Why are you standing here?
Come in

1288
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:57,115
l have not come to visit
but to invite you for a celebration

1289
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,579
Wedding of my daughter,
Rajalakshmi has been fixed

1290
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:08,124
The bridegroom is lPS
ASP Madhu Ramachandra Menon

1291
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:13,062
An alliance that matches
our wealth and status

1292
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:19,903
Wedding will take place at
Raja's convention centre on the 18th

1293
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,877
Here is the invitation

1294
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:36,518
You should be there to witness
the grandeur and power of Raja

1295
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:47,298
The lPS officer marrying her will erase
the indignity the scandals have caused

1296
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,934
Do you realize the extent
of a mothers responsibility...

1297
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:56,567
...regarding her daughter's marriage?

1298
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:10,482
Don't forget to bring the card
Only then the security will let you in

1299
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:32,435
The treasure you had kept
so carefully is lost forever

1300
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,378
No, it has not
Neither will it go

1301
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:39,576
Uncle, with God's blessing
everything will turn to our advantage

1302
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:45,415
We have fixed the date and invited all
Why this demand all of a sudden?

1303
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:50,089
This is not a demand
lt's only a request

1304
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:54,528
50 % of the Raja's group of assets
must be written in my son's name

1305
01:22:55,437 --> 01:23:01,273
Dealings of the bank and assets
should be under my son's control

1306
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:06,912
Only 2 requests
lsn't it fair enough?

1307
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,481
No! You should've asked earlier

1308
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,987
We didn't know your details then

1309
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,424
What details have you got hold now?

1310
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,928
Don't get me wrong

1311
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:27,866
But your family has a reputation
of evicting men from your homes

1312
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,966
No one knows
if your husband is alive

1313
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:37,545
- He died in an accident
- Where?

1314
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,479
ln a foreign country
The funeral too was there

1315
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,476
l have no option
but to believe it

1316
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,189
This madam's husband
is alive but no one's seen him

1317
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,483
Not even for
the engagement

1318
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,085
There is not even
a photo in this house

1319
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:57,023
lf the daughter takes after this
then my son will be in a sorry state

1320
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,225
l believed you were
an aristocratic family

1321
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:03,168
That is true, but that does not
prevent us from asking dowry

1322
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,138
Especially when the girl
is a victim of scandals...

1323
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,571
...and we are giving her
a new lease in life

1324
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:08,107
Excuse me, sir

1325
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:14,175
Dowry was legally
prohibited on May 20th 1961

1326
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:19,117
lt is a punishable crime
to accept and give dowry

1327
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,189
lf you don't know the law
ask your father

1328
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,314
Who are you to interfere in this?

1329
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:25,484
l am their legal advisor
Ashoka Chakravarthi

1330
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,584
M.A., LLLB

1331
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,924
You are adding an extra L

1332
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,464
You can have that L if you want

1333
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,499
Was he not dismissed?

1334
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,898
Who dismissed, when was this?

1335
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:38,496
Such things is not done orally
You have to send a notice informing it

1336
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:42,098
l am continuing in this post
and functioning from outside

1337
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,008
l have not been paid salary
since the last 3 months

1338
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:46,945
lt's pending,
but l can easily get it

1339
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:48,208
By the way...

1340
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:51,149
...the son too may have
to go in and out of courts

1341
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,152
- Hey you!
- No madam, don't interfere

1342
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,414
l will deal with it

1343
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:55,511
You are playing games
with an lPS officer

1344
01:24:55,623 --> 01:25:02,085
Whoever has committed the crime
he has to bow down to the laws of court

1345
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:02,959
Whiplash!

1346
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,965
You will have to sweat it out
with the whip lash questions l will ask

1347
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:08,900
Sir, your son does not know
the value of the black gown

1348
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:10,971
What proof do you have against me?

1349
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:16,240
Engagement, photos, invitation card
All this is enough to go to court

1350
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:19,472
After that you will not have an inkling
of which way your ASP cap went Mr...?

1351
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:20,673
Oh Madhu Ram

1352
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,610
lt won't be sweet any more
though your name means sweet!

1353
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:25,311
Thank you for
counseling us with your lawyer

1354
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,578
- We are leaving
- Please!

1355
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,280
- See You
- Not necessary

1356
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,580
Madam

1357
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:32,992
What is your business here?
Did l ask you to interfere in this?

1358
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:34,994
No, no one told me

1359
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:38,554
But l don't like you
being defeated by anyone

1360
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,968
lf one lPS goes there will be
100 others to take his place

1361
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,039
There is no need
to use your assets as a basis

1362
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:50,568
Rajakokila, Rajamallika and Rajalakshmi
should live here like Ranis

1363
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,943
Sorry! You should
live like queens

1364
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,577
l committed a mistake
out of ignorance

1365
01:25:57,118 --> 01:26:00,281
l came here to apologize
That was when l saw them...

1366
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,549
Now, l cannot live with
the guilt l am facing

1367
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:08,153
l am now totally guilt ridden
Awedding has been put off due to me

1368
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,524
Forgive me!

1369
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:11,627
Forgive me!

1370
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:16,263
l don't know if l am
qualified enough to say this

1371
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,565
lf not, l ask forgiveness once again

1372
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:23,603
lf your daughter wants a husband
who will live in total submission

1373
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,703
...l am all for it, 100%
l will look after her like a treasure

1374
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,610
- No!
- Shall l take leave?

1375
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,450
- Grandma! Please bless me
- Hey!

1376
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:44,195
Wow! Grandma, you are looking so cute
lf it had been 25 years back...

1377
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:48,201
Don't ever give hopes...

1378
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:55,368
Grandma, l...would have
...married...you, my dear

1379
01:26:56,344 --> 01:27:02,283
That Ashoka Chakravarthi was
brought by the good Lord himself

1380
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:07,650
That lPS and his father
shivered in their shoes

1381
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,359
What are you thinking about?

1382
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:14,553
About him only

1383
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:19,427
l somehow feel we should
perform this wedding...

1384
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,661
...on the auspicious day
we already decided upon

1385
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:27,172
Otherwise you will not be able
to raise your head

1386
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,641
...in front of Balasubramanyam

1387
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,011
Did you ask my daughter?

1388
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,678
l heard everything

1389
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,119
What is your opinion?

1390
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:51,221
He will not marry me
l will marry him

1391
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:25,199
Ashoka Chakravarthi's father
Rajagopalan thambi?

1392
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,064
Yes
l don't recognize you

1393
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:31,102
Haven't you heard?
About Raja's group?

1394
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:37,037
- MD, Rajamallika
- My mom, Rajakokila

1395
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:37,907
Chairperson

1396
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:41,175
- Which municipality?
- Raja's group chairperson

1397
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:43,211
Please sit, Mr Thambi

1398
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:48,714
Your younger son has been
blessed with a great fortune

1399
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,220
- Did he win a lottery?
- Who is he?

1400
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,552
He is my older son, Baburaj

1401
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:59,490
Mr Thambi, we have arranged
an alliance for your younger son

1402
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,461
My daughter Rajalakshmi is the bride

1403
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:09,703
- You have decided my son's marriage?
- Yes

1404
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:11,705
What are they saying, son?

1405
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:15,278
That your son got a good job
The job of a husband

1406
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:20,410
So, he has become a salaried man
What will be his monthly salary?

1407
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,957
What does he need a salary?
Explain to him, lndhu

1408
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:28,222
Raja's company cars to travel
Our own petrol pumps

1409
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:32,959
- Our company hotels, resorts
- Our own textile shops for dresses

1410
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:35,661
Theatres, supermarkets, shopping mall

1411
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:40,067
He cuts his hair every month
ls that also done by you?

1412
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,172
Cultureless fellows

1413
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,306
We are also cultured
But we don't pretend so

1414
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:50,677
1 2 3 4 5
Why do 2 of you, need 5 cars

1415
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,317
ls it to show off?

1416
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,388
This will make
people here scorn you

1417
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:59,492
3 out of this will stay back here
to come for the wedding

1418
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:05,455
Such ambassadors and taxis
will not be allowed into our place

1419
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,725
Listen

1420
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,333
We shall bear the entire
expenses of the wedding

1421
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:10,597
- Minmini?
- Ma'am

1422
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:13,003
10 lakhs cheque as advance

1423
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,075
No! We haven't decided anything

1424
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:20,011
But we have, here is the card

1425
01:30:20,114 --> 01:30:23,413
The wedding will take place
as mentioned here

1426
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:25,986
Your son has already agreed

1427
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:28,681
We are leaving
See you at the wedding

1428
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,290
- See you
- This old...!

1429
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,431
How are we sure, my son
will not get the same treatment you did

1430
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:48,976
That will not happen
My backbone is twice as strong as his

1431
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:52,604
So you are prepared for anything, eh?

1432
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:57,043
l am your son, dad
After marriage she will live here

1433
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:04,046
Let my daughter live with
a decent guy in a decent home, my friend

1434
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:06,218
Don't object to this

1435
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:22,035
Mallika!

1436
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,676
Come here, that man has come

1437
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:27,213
- Who?
- That Balasubramanyam

1438
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:31,110
l invited him
Let him see all this

1439
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,286
Many taxis have come out there

1440
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,365
The bridegroom and
his people have arrived

1441
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:49,102
They must be some local people
They will come only in Benz cars

1442
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,296
lt is definitely
the bridegroom and his family

1443
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:08,713
Come in

1444
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,647
Didn't l ask you
to come in the Benz cars?

1445
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,523
There's no one there
who knows how to drive them

1446
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:16,563
Better bring them here
instead of letting them rust there

1447
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:17,995
True!

1448
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,084
- Who will give away the bride?
- l will

1449
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:19,455
No! Not when her father is alive
He should perform that ritual

1450
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:24,590
Go ask her father to come

1451
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:41,475
Come

1452
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:04,669
Here's the betel leaf

1453
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,371
One minute
Just a signature here

1454
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:09,532
What's all this?

1455
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:14,274
Marriage registration
This holds good in any court

1456
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:16,609
Now you

1457
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:23,357
How is the boy
l got for my daughter?

1458
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:24,685
Smart, eh?

1459
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:30,222
Of course he is
l found him much before you did

1460
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:42,264
My childhood friend
Rajagopalan Thambi's younger son

1461
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:46,674
l agreed to this for the only reason
that the girl was his daughter

1462
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,181
Mr Marumakan! (son-in-law)

1463
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,986
What's the relation between you?

1464
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:56,215
What is this, mother in law?
He is my father in law, right?

1465
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,190
Let's forget all the past

1466
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:02,592
Both you and uncle have got
a son-in-law as you wished

1467
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,959
Everything is okay

1468
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,999
Now you come together
and it will be the climax

1469
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,067
No!

1470
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,766
l don't want
the boy he's brought

1471
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,203
But l married your daughter
Not you, mummy

1472
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,108
Let my wife answer

1473
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,181
She will listen only to me

1474
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:26,176
l have grown up hearing
enough stories about you

1475
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,288
l hate to even look at you

1476
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:31,222
lf this is a drama
put up by 2 of you

1477
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:32,384
...l don't want this marriage

1478
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:34,290
- Lakshmi!
- Don't touch me

1479
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:40,589
A child brought up by a mother
will listen only to the mother

1480
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:44,430
Don't do this my dear

1481
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,598
Not immediately
after the wedding

1482
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:48,732
Move away

1483
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:50,234
Move aside

1484
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:56,482
She is ignorant
Go explain things to her

1485
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,184
Go

1486
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,520
Lakshmi

1487
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:02,989
Move

1488
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:06,657
People who scorn their husbands
wouldn't know about their value

1489
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,297
Who the hell
are you to teach me?

1490
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:14,564
You are dismissed!

1491
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:39,085
Don't be upset
l thought this would be the climax

1492
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:41,024
But this is only an interval

1493
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:43,292
Hereafter it is war

1494
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:46,228
A battle to get my wife
from my mother-in-law

1495
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:50,363
Before that let's take a break, eh?

1496
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:10,320
Just forget this marriage and
everything else that happened today

1497
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,550
Do you understand?

1498
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:15,990
Remove all this finery
Go shower and freshen up

1499
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:17,085
Go

1500
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,029
Poor little girl

1501
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:25,663
Just wait and see, l'll find her
a man who is far better in status

1502
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:32,572
What is it, dear?

1503
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:36,807
Hi! Grandma

1504
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,646
Hi! Mother-in-law

1505
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:43,314
Hi, my dear sweet wife!
l am here for you...come, come

1506
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:44,751
What are you doing here?

1507
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,157
What a foolish question!

1508
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:50,955
What does a husband
do in his wife's house

1509
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:52,794
lsn't that the point, grandma?

1510
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,097
That relationship broke
at the wedding itself

1511
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,191
Now you get out

1512
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:59,704
No! This is my wife's house
l can't get out

1513
01:37:59,807 --> 01:38:02,105
l have politely asked you to go

1514
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:06,009
Polite? The millionaire
Rajamallika...polite?

1515
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,205
ls this being polite?

1516
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:08,076
Da!

1517
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:11,379
Don't get angry like this
and spoil my mood, mother-in-law

1518
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:13,745
lt's our 1st wedding night
in a short while from now

1519
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,325
My sweet wife
the sun is about to set

1520
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:25,297
The flowers are wilting
Go bring some cool milk

1521
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:33,233
Go and come back quickly
Let's fly into our wedding night

1522
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,203
Mummy, call the police

1523
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:40,007
No! Don't let the police
take part in our first night

1524
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:41,308
lt will be a celebration of punches

1525
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,713
Hey! Lock me in
with the girl inside

1526
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:45,884
l will show you today

1527
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:57,593
Oh, it was you, sir

1528
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:00,594
Have you come
to spend the night with me?

1529
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,067
Stupid! Why are you here?

1530
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:04,396
They are harassing me
Locking me inside, here

1531
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:06,902
What else must we do to someone
who has barged into our house?

1532
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:08,565
Should we
shower him with flowers?

1533
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:09,676
What is your relationship?

1534
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:10,801
We don't know who he is

1535
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:16,008
Lies, all lies
l am their son-in-law

1536
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:20,280
Sir, our marriage took place
this morning...one minute

1537
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:24,881
This is the marriage certificate
This is the wedding photo

1538
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:28,117
Until we are legally separated
l will continue to be her husband

1539
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:32,729
Come stand here close to me
See, look at the photo and us

1540
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,995
Don't you dare touch my child!

1541
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:39,731
Sir, this is the problem
What's wrong if l touch my wife?

1542
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,966
l will not allow this

1543
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:43,805
Sir, should the husband
take permission...

1544
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:45,105
...from his mom-in-law
to touch his wife?

1545
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,079
You have to arrest
and take him away, mister

1546
01:39:47,147 --> 01:39:49,581
Sorry madam, we don't
have a right to do that

1547
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,242
You have to create a right

Ourjob is not to create 'rights'
whenever you want us to

1549

You can call the DGP or
the Home Minister

My decision will not alter

Your place here is pitiful, right?

Can you make me some tea?

1572
01:41:11,131 --> 01:41:13,622
Get lost! l'm not here
to make you tea

1573
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:16,134
This is exactly what
they say to me in there

01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:20,639
But l won't back off saying
l didn't get tea, paper or food

01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:24,074
l will struggle here till the day
my wife accepts me

1576
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:25,941
Aha! Dreams that
won't ever materialize

1577
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:26,945
- What?
- Get lost, you dog!

1578
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:30,983
Were you hurt she called you that?
Very good she's my wife

1579
01:41:58,312 --> 01:42:04,717
My dreams dance
to your footsteps

1580
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,219
Aren't you ashamed to do this?

1581
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,811
Hi! Grandma
You've come again?

1582

That is gone
And so has this

Okay

01:42:48,195 --> 01:42:51,926
Hey! Why are you here?
Didn't l dismiss you the other day?

Get lost!

Go find out where it is
and do what's necessary

1613
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,383
Oh my God, my father-in-law

Uncle, it's been 1 whole day
since we met

to be away from you

1621
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:09,401
When will you be coming here?

Hey you...come my honey pot

Hey you...with looks of stealth

1626
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:50,974
lf you bite into
a mango of sugar cubes

1627
01:44:51,084 --> 01:44:54,986
Swinging the net
over the sweet girl, don't pinch

1628
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:07,929
With all percussion instruments
give me the honey pot

1629
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:16,373
With all the wind instruments
don't look so stealthily

1630
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:58,117
Hey you, this is the age
to yearn for the Kozhikode halwa

1631
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:02,279
Oh tender floret,
with the country beauty Thulunad

1632
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:06,723
Not the bowl of auspicious milk
only words spilling over l want

1633
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:10,820
Don't eliminate me
with old words and new ways

1634
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:15,095
Jaggery peanut sweet
You are the from Sivakasi

1635
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:19,127
Aren't you the pollen
of sweet smelling Madurai jasmine?

1636
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:23,666
ln auspicious month of January
it is festival of harvest

1637
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:27,941
Waiting to witness
the Karakattan dance, heyl

1638
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:32,212
When the nomadic cook Nala comes
we'll have to find him

1639
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:40,893
Hey you...come my honey pot

1640
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:49,099
Hey you...with looks of stealth

1641
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:30,734
With welcoming plates of flowers
with waves of festivities

1642
01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:34,780
Lighting the fire of gigantic torches
why do you sit up there?

1643
01:47:34,848 --> 01:47:39,012
Hey you, your glass bangles jingled
Flowers on your dress blossomed

1644
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:43,215
Even if beauty fades
charm of your eyes forever shine

1645
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:47,350
Don't try to lock thejingle
of anklets within itself

1646
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:51,830
Don't try to sing notes
of music like the koel

1647
01:47:51,898 --> 01:47:56,164
lt is the harvest festival Onam
in a short while

1648
01:47:56,269 --> 01:48:00,433
Don't try to snare me
and tie me up and tame me

1649
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:04,804
Don't try to pacify me
and try to break me, oh Lordl

1650
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:15,286
With all percussion instruments
give me the honey pot

1651
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:05,428
My dear, don't think l am
advising or taking his side

1652
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:10,841
Any girl is lucky
to be happily married

1653
01:49:10,911 --> 01:49:15,211
He should be
the apple of your eye

1654
01:49:15,815 --> 01:49:19,478
You should not allow
even a tiny scratch to mar it

1655
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:25,018
Send that loose woman away
and look after your husband

1656
01:49:25,158 --> 01:49:30,824
Awife can make her husband
her slave with love and devotion

1657
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:32,831
Not by bossing

1658
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:39,261
Your stubborn grandma
or your arrogant mother...

1659
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:42,704
...will not be able to
guide you on the right path

1660
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,442
Who are you calling
arrogant, you old hag?

1661
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:48,340
Me arrogant?
ls my mom stubborn?

1662
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:51,174
What's the problem?

1663
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:56,052
You've allowed her to live here
saying she was your friend and an orphan

1664
01:49:56,156 --> 01:49:57,885
She is the problem

1665
01:49:57,958 --> 01:50:01,223
She has left the kitchen
to enquire into other issues

1666
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:03,694
- Keshu!
- Coming!

1667
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:06,322
Keshu, push her out
and close the gates

1668
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:08,899
She's also a woman
Let her stay here, somewhere

1669
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:14,839
Will you obey me or shall l
drag her out by her hair, myself?

1670
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:20,939
Wait!

1671
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:26,441
l don't want your service
of so many years as charity

1672
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:28,784
lt was not for money

1673
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:30,355
Get out, you old hag!

1674
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:42,465
Money is Mahalakshmi,
Goddess of wealth

1675
01:50:42,736 --> 01:50:46,763
lf you throw money, it will just
go away with those who love it

1676
01:50:51,277 --> 01:50:55,008
lf you refuse this Goddess
it may not come back

1677
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:57,709
This is the price
of your sweat and toil

1678
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:01,414
Come with me, mother

1679
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:10,327
Whose house is this?

1680
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:13,331
Come, mother

1681
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,393
- Keshu?
- This is my house

1682
01:51:16,536 --> 01:51:18,128
You can stay here
for the time being

1683
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:21,136
Put me in some old age home

1684
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:24,142
l will live there
without troubling anyone

1685
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:26,177
Old age home?

1686
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:31,082
l will look after you
like my own mother

1687
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:32,774
lndhu

1688
01:51:34,254 --> 01:51:39,214
We have not divorced
She continues to be my wife

1689
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:42,690
Our 3 kids are studying
lt is mighty expensive to exist

1690
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:47,090
Considering our qualification
we get well paid only in that place

1691
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:52,797
The job which we never got as a couple
we got, when we said we are divorced

1692
01:51:55,075 --> 01:51:55,973
Why is she here?

1693
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:59,375
She is not a loose woman
like you thought

1694
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:02,812
lt was all a trick
to give them a shock

1695
01:52:03,016 --> 01:52:04,711
l am their neighbor

1696
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:08,686
l am leaving now
Call me if you need anything

1697
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:18,463
Greetings

1698
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:24,460
Mr Panikker, you wronged me
l dismissed you

1699
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:28,307
Are you still having
a grouse against me for that?

1700
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,397
Yes

1701
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:31,309
No

1702
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,879
What's happened is
over and done with

1703
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:36,881
l need your help now

1704
01:52:37,383 --> 01:52:40,250
l have decided
to take you back

1705
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:44,014
Punish me in public
Forgive me in front of family

1706
01:52:44,124 --> 01:52:47,287
lt's alright! A lawyer
should be thick skinned

1707
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:49,384
You have been hearing
about what's happening, right?

1708
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:52,226
Sure, it's the talk of the town

1709
01:52:52,966 --> 01:52:56,925
Sorry, l meant
it was an open secret

1710
01:52:57,103 --> 01:53:00,300
Madam, we shouldn't
stop with just divorce

1711
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:02,806
Let's file some criminal
cases also against him

1712
01:53:02,909 --> 01:53:04,399
Let him be inside for 4-5 years

1713
01:53:04,477 --> 01:53:07,469
l don't have the patience
to wait till judgment

1714
01:53:07,747 --> 01:53:10,807
His entire family
should be ruined

1715
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:15,482
His tears should fall at my feet

1716
01:53:15,822 --> 01:53:17,050
Does he have sisters?

1717
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:18,886
1 , at their home in Ottapalam

1718
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:20,186
ls she unmarried?

1719
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:21,089
Yes

1720
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:24,121
l will deal with it

1721
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:25,262
How?

1722
01:53:26,366 --> 01:53:28,994
We should get
Hamsa out from jail

1723
01:53:33,206 --> 01:53:36,175
Who the hell brought me out?
Who has bailed me out?

1724
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:38,710
l was very happy
with 3 square meals

1725
01:53:38,778 --> 01:53:39,938
Who envied me that?

1726
01:53:40,013 --> 01:53:42,243
lt was me
l found it intolerable

1727
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:44,145
Why did you bring me outside?

1728
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,047
To get you married

1729
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:48,019
But l have only 1 month's parole

1730
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:51,419
After all the other activities, there won't
be time to even eat my meal in peace

1731
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:56,928
You must go with your father
to Ottapalam, to meet a girl

1732
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,464
- l don't have a father
- No?

1733
01:53:59,732 --> 01:54:01,029
l don't know actually

1734
01:54:02,268 --> 01:54:04,168
Well then, l am your father

1735
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:06,135
What?

1736
01:54:06,873 --> 01:54:12,140
My mother never told me
this truth even in her death bed

1737
01:54:12,245 --> 01:54:14,076
l said, l'll act as your father

1738
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:19,015
lt's a 'quotation' to ruin the life
of a girl, from a well to do family

1739
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:20,346
Here's the advance

1740
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:22,288
l misunderstood horribly

1741
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:28,520
From today, my wife is your mother
My sister is your sister

1742
01:54:28,795 --> 01:54:30,387
So l will be?
Father

1743
01:54:37,136 --> 01:54:39,969
My son
Daddy

1744
01:54:40,073 --> 01:54:41,768
Come out, my son

1745
01:54:42,075 --> 01:54:44,475
ls this the family
you were talking about?

1746
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:48,313
Who are you?
l don't place you

1747
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:54,045
l am Vishvanatha Pannikker
This my only son Krishnakumar

1748
01:54:54,153 --> 01:54:56,713
My only wife Sharada

1749
01:54:56,823 --> 01:54:58,916
This is my only sister

1750
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:01,485
Please sit

1751
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:03,251
Don't you dare take advantage!

1752
01:55:03,329 --> 01:55:04,762
What brings you here?

1753
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:08,391
My son is like me
A millionaire in business

1754
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:13,370
Recently on his trip here to buy
an estate, he saw your daughter

1755
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:14,871
He liked her

1756
01:55:15,508 --> 01:55:17,476
Oh! So you have come
with a marriage proposal, eh?

1757
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:20,212
We would like to see the girl

1758
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:30,819
She's more beautiful
than market Vasanthi

1759
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:31,788
What is it?

1760
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:35,286
He wants to talk to the girl

1761
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:37,226
Oh! Has it reached that level?

1762
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:38,888
Well, it would
anyway happen soon

1763
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:40,226
Go, my son go

1764
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:44,793
Come, let's go to the bedroom

1765
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:48,931
Go, what's the harm in talking?

1766
01:55:49,175 --> 01:55:51,302
Wooden bedstead, eh?

1767
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:54,777
Do you have something
to ask or tell?

1768
01:55:55,882 --> 01:55:58,476
Asking would be dangerous

1769
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,753
Let me ask

1770
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:04,156
Why is this here?

1771
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:05,417
He's my brother

1772
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:07,924
ls he a policeman?
Let me leave then

1773
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:10,086
A marriage proposal for my sister

1774
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,831
Loan in the bank
and marriage expenses

1775
01:56:15,201 --> 01:56:18,762
Dad says we must
sell the land in the town

1776
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:22,274
This land belonged
to our ancestors

1777
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,444
The place where
grandpa was laid to rest

1778
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:30,214
Dad used to say he too
wanted to rest here finally

1779
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:36,448
Poor man, desires
have to give way to needs

1780
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,984
The land should not
leave your hands

1781
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:41,287
At the same time
you need the money

1782
01:56:41,361 --> 01:56:42,521
lsn't that the issue?

1783
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:44,262
l didn't mean that

1784
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:49,131
Your smartness lies
in gaining without losing

1785
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:54,069
Madam, your son-in-law
will soon be a millionaire

1786
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:57,199
10 acres of land along the sea shore
in Puthenkara, is being auctioned

1787
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:59,210
They plan to get it cheaply
to start a factory...

1788
01:56:59,312 --> 01:57:03,214
that purifies sea water
to make it portable

1789
01:57:03,316 --> 01:57:06,012
A partnership deal
with a Dubai group

1790
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:06,949
Who told you?

1791
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:13,424
l overheard a private discussion
your so called husband was having

1792
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:15,424
The auction is on Saturday

1793
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:17,996
lt is disputed land
Hence this auction

1794
01:57:18,598 --> 01:57:20,361
He should not get
his hands on that land

1795
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:23,364
We should get it at any price

1796
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:28,303
lf the bid is fixed
the amount has to be paid in cash

1797
01:57:28,374 --> 01:57:30,103
Bidding begins now

1798
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:31,540
l crore

1799
01:57:34,013 --> 01:57:36,038
1 crore, 10 lakhs

1800
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:38,310
1 .5 crores

1801
01:57:38,384 --> 01:57:39,408
2 crores

1802
01:57:39,519 --> 01:57:40,781
3 crores

1803
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:47,982
Why are they here?

1804
01:57:48,294 --> 01:57:49,352
To take part in this auction

1805
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:53,193
An auction in this metro city
Without my madam's knowledge?

1806
01:57:53,299 --> 01:57:55,494
My dear Chakravarthy
You won't get this place

1807
01:57:55,768 --> 01:57:59,363
Our Mallika madam will fix it
with twice the amount you bid

1808
01:57:59,472 --> 01:58:03,306
We plan to start a factory
to purify sea water into mineral water

1809
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:06,310
- This is cheating
- l am a lawyer known for that

1810
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:08,539
Please help, it's a matter
of life and death

1811
01:58:08,815 --> 01:58:11,375
This is mine too
But let me ask

1812
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:12,076
Madam!

1813
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:15,814
You don't have to
advocate anybody's cause

1814
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:18,352
This will be in my daughter's name

1815
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:21,882
3 crore...once
3 crore...twice

1816
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,393
3 crore and 10 lakhs

1817
01:58:23,463 --> 01:58:29,891
4 crore
No, 5 crore

1818
01:58:32,438 --> 01:58:35,032
Crores are simply peanuts to us

1819
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:41,102
5 crore

1820
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:44,278
The price has been
fixed for 5 crores

1821
01:58:45,218 --> 01:58:46,845
What do you learn from this?

1822
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:49,854
A squirrel should never try
to open its mouth like an elephant

1823
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,491
Call the land owners immediately

1824
01:58:55,595 --> 01:58:57,358
We have to get
receipt of the money paid

1825
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:59,864
We are in a bit of a hurry

1826
01:59:25,124 --> 01:59:27,217
Count the cash first
Then comes registration

1827
01:59:27,493 --> 01:59:30,519
lt's from Raja's group
We have full trust in them

1828
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:39,461
Excuse me, this land
is in my father's name

1829
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:44,272
We couldn't get
even 2 crores for it

1830
01:59:44,377 --> 01:59:47,744
But with uncles hot idea,
it fetched us 5

1831
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:50,042
Where is your lawyer?

1832
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:57,478
He's really blundered and
made his client fall, isn't it uncle?

1833
01:59:58,391 --> 02:00:03,294
Mr Marumakan, the land which
your grandfather rests will not be lost

1834
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:09,192
This land in my daughter's name
actually belongs to you too

1835
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:10,858
After all, you are the husband

1836
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:15,999
Raja's group have no history of selling
They have always bought

1837
02:00:16,108 --> 02:00:18,508
So never fear
that it will be sold again

1838
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,471
Shut up

1839
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:28,115
l am Rajamallika
And l will show you

1840
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:34,449
We were ready to
pay back the loan fully

1841
02:00:34,527 --> 02:00:38,224
...since the last couple of days
But the bank had holidays

1842
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:43,894
Your papers along with the report from
the Ombudsman report should reach us

1843
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:46,963
lt may be delayed 2 days

1844
02:00:47,573 --> 02:00:48,562
Good morning, madam

1845
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,844
They are very close to me

1846
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:56,847
Please finish all
formalities immediately

1847
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:00,542
Let them pay the loan
amount today itself

1848
02:01:00,953 --> 02:01:03,513
You can transfer
the balance to their account later

1849
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:04,453
Yes, madam

1850
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:09,050
lt is dangerous
to keep cash in hand

1851
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:11,459
- Have you brought the cash?
- No, call him

1852
02:01:11,564 --> 02:01:14,556
Just a call, he'll bring
the cash in an hour

1853
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:18,861
Brother, dad is on line

1854
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:24,338
- Hello
- Son, the cash can be paid today

1855
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:25,876
Come to the bank
with cash right now

1856
02:01:25,978 --> 02:01:26,569
Quickly

1857
02:01:29,315 --> 02:01:31,340
May l have a word with you?

1858
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:40,559
You fooled me very cleverly

1859
02:01:40,826 --> 02:01:45,593
But l was happy,
because it was to close your loans

1860
02:01:45,865 --> 02:01:47,162
...and for your sister's wedding

1861
02:01:47,466 --> 02:01:50,299
l have to meet the GM, see you

1862
02:01:53,906 --> 02:01:56,568
All her transactions
are through our bank

1863
02:01:56,842 --> 02:02:00,300
Moreover 40 % of our shares
are with Raja's group

1864
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:03,179
What is your connection with them?

1865
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:05,245
We are related

1866
02:02:05,484 --> 02:02:08,783
l married her daughter

1867
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:11,356
Please sit inside, sir
Shall l get you something to drink?

1868
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:14,584
- l had enough
- Please come, sir

1869
02:02:16,462 --> 02:02:18,362
The phone is ringing
but he's not picking the call

1870
02:02:18,831 --> 02:02:20,321
Where the hell has he gone?

1871
02:02:27,807 --> 02:02:29,240
Haven't you paid the money yet?

1872
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:32,241
He has started
but not yet reached

1873
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:35,337
Must have been trapped
in some traffic block in this city

1874
02:02:43,022 --> 02:02:44,853
All the money has gone

1875
02:02:45,124 --> 02:02:46,352
The police took it all away

1876
02:02:47,126 --> 02:02:50,289
They stopped me on the way
and took it all claiming it as black money

1877
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:14,946
Without taking the culprit into custody
How can they take the cash alone?

1878
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:16,821
l don't believe it

1879
02:03:19,892 --> 02:03:22,986
Let me call the city
police commissioner

1880
02:03:28,567 --> 02:03:29,465
Commissioner?

1881
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:32,002
Tell me the truth
Did you get into a bar

1882
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:33,935
- No! l told you the truth
- Okay

1883
02:03:36,041 --> 02:03:40,000
Commissioner says
no such thing happened

1884
02:03:40,379 --> 02:03:45,840
lf you give a complaint
the truth will come out

1885
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:47,852
What did you say?
That l stole the money?

1886
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:48,614
What is the doubt?

1887
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:50,150
- l will...
- Hey

1888
02:03:56,162 --> 02:03:58,858
You blundered
and tried to attack her?

1889
02:03:58,964 --> 02:04:01,398
Are you playing a drama
after losing all the money?

1890
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:05,036
What are these children doing?

1891
02:04:05,137 --> 02:04:10,973
This is a public place, your boys
having a quarrel here is shameful

1892
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:12,304
Go separate them

1893
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,145
Not bad, Panikker!
Not bad at all!

1894
02:04:23,322 --> 02:04:27,053
Your crooked brain
has started working only now

1895
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:30,322
Those goons are asking us
the place to deliver the cash

1896
02:04:30,429 --> 02:04:31,191
They are trustworthy

1897
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:36,394
l will reach Raja's granites in 2 hours
Let them meet me there

1898
02:04:36,502 --> 02:04:37,935
What is happening to them?

1899
02:04:38,037 --> 02:04:42,303
The brothers are having a fist fight
Avery helpless father looking on

1900
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,074
What is all this?

1901
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:51,211
All that was a show

1902
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:54,476
Did you think l'd blame you
listening to her?

1903
02:04:54,587 --> 02:04:55,554
But you went
slightly overboard, okay?

1904
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:56,951
Hey! Take it easy

1905
02:04:57,323 --> 02:05:00,554
But l am sure of one thing
The police are not behind this

1906
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:02,824
lt is that she-devil's devious mind

1907
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:05,123
Let's give an actual complaint then

1908
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:08,195
Oh hell! They've taken
my phone also

1909
02:05:09,235 --> 02:05:10,896
Did they take your phone?

1910
02:05:14,974 --> 02:05:23,848
lt's ringing, we are lucky
We can now trace them

1911
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:34,988
Now the phone
is in Gandhi street

1912
02:05:40,499 --> 02:05:43,263
lsn't it where the Raja group granites are?

1913
02:06:03,522 --> 02:06:06,013
Hi! Mother-in-law

1914
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:10,985
She is notjust
an ordinary mother-in-law

1915
02:06:11,096 --> 02:06:14,088
She is well versed in
goondaism 'Quotation'

1916
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:18,362
Not only that, a good actress too
What fantastic acting!

1917
02:06:18,904 --> 02:06:20,496
Throw the 2 of them out

1918
02:06:20,606 --> 02:06:24,167
No, we'll come to you
The money is ours after all, right?

1919
02:07:43,455 --> 02:07:44,387
Catch it, brother

1920
02:07:47,893 --> 02:07:49,554
Look here, woman

1921
02:07:49,662 --> 02:07:51,857
lf l show you my true colors
l'll drag you by your hair and...!

1922
02:07:51,964 --> 02:07:56,060
Hey! Please don't do such things
l will lose my mother-in-law

1923
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:57,998
Why do you such things?

1924
02:07:58,103 --> 02:08:03,268
We'll only lose
our own family prestige

1925
02:08:05,277 --> 02:08:06,244
Stop!

1926
02:08:07,946 --> 02:08:10,210
Did you get
the money, madam?

1927
02:08:10,315 --> 02:08:11,407
We did!

1928
02:08:12,184 --> 02:08:17,622
lf l dealt with this in its right way
your madam will soon be counting bars

1929
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:18,618
l too am coming

1930
02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:23,360
lf you continue this
not only your Rajamallika...

1931
02:08:23,462 --> 02:08:31,426
...but Rajakokila and Rajalakshmi
will soon be doing this

1932
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:36,907
Then l will squeeze them
and send them like this

1933
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,392
Hey, beautiful women
come dance and sway

1934
02:08:57,696 --> 02:09:00,494
Take off your cloak of pride
and come away

1935
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:05,602
With the key to compromise
tied to your sarees

1936
02:09:05,704 --> 02:09:08,969
Bearing on shoulders
the deed of the universe

1937
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:16,571
Proud, haughty, stuck up and audacious
Even guns fear the edge of their tongues

1938
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:24,384
Don't be to this son-in-law, stubborn
For he is king of this house, for certain

1939
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:32,329
Don't be to this son-in-law, stubborn
For he is king of this house, for certain

1940
02:10:03,028 --> 02:10:10,992
Superiority complex is ancestral property
Cheapness as siblings is hereditary

1941
02:10:11,103 --> 02:10:18,566
They do not know the meaning of patience
Though l stuff it down their throats often

1942
02:10:18,677 --> 02:10:25,606
They just value money more and more
Only to bring troubles encore

1943
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:33,450
Charming Rajakokila, Mallika and Lakshmi,
all up in arms, will you clash?

1944
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:41,364
Don't try your tricks on this son-in-law
He is always the king of this home

1945
02:10:41,433 --> 02:10:48,669
Don't try your tricks on this son-in-law
He is always the king of this home

1946
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:53,310
Get all these medicinal herbs
And bring it in bulk to use

1947
02:10:53,378 --> 02:10:57,178
Bring all these herbs to make
A potion of magic

1948
02:10:57,249 --> 02:11:01,549
Grind all these herbs and
Apply it on your heads

1949
02:11:08,493 --> 02:11:12,554
Hey, they just sit like
queen bees within their homes

1950
02:11:12,631 --> 02:11:16,397
They pretend to spin
the world turning on its axis

1951
02:11:16,468 --> 02:11:20,336
Hey, they who give a cane
to spank will get it back

1952
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:24,501
They shake the earth
with their dance of fury

1953
02:11:24,576 --> 02:11:31,573
lf they cross limits, they shall be
destroyed forever, for sure

1954
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:39,482
Hey Raja Kokila, Mallika and Lakshmi
Daily you only live to threaten and bully

1955
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:47,327
Don't try your stunts with this son-in-law
For he is the only king of this home

1956
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:55,329
Don't try your stunts with this son-in-law
For he is the only king of this home

1957
02:12:16,495 --> 02:12:17,484
Why are we here?

1958
02:12:18,363 --> 02:12:20,558
This is our hotel
Daddy and mummy are inside

1959
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:23,999
- They are waiting for you
- But...

1960
02:12:24,403 --> 02:12:26,928
You will soon be
part of our family

1961
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:29,564
Come, my dear
Come

1962
02:12:29,675 --> 02:12:31,575
Laddu and jilebi together

1963
02:12:32,044 --> 02:12:36,538
Panikker sir, your sister
and my rape victim have come

1964
02:12:36,648 --> 02:12:39,310
Hamsa, now the ball is in your court

1965
02:12:39,418 --> 02:12:41,010
What?! Why do we
need a ball to rape?!

1966
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,519
Fool! They will be
in room # 101

1967
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:46,887
When you go in,
my sister will come out

1968
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:48,516
You can then start yourjob

1969
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:50,390
Don't show any pity

1970
02:12:50,495 --> 02:12:53,293
Okay, apart from pity
l will show everything else

1971
02:12:53,398 --> 02:12:57,391
Here is an advance for you
Take this auspicious offering

02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:16,418
Where are daddy and mummy?

1975
02:13:16,488 --> 02:13:17,955
Daddy and mummy?

1976
02:13:21,526 --> 02:13:24,427
Why like this?

1977
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:26,028
l said l must leave

1978
02:13:27,399 --> 02:13:29,333
Not a sound or l'll kill you

1979
02:13:30,736 --> 02:13:33,330
Your customer has come
Move aside!

1980
02:13:39,711 --> 02:13:40,609
May l?

1981
02:13:42,147 --> 02:13:44,377
Aiyo! lsn't this my sister?

1982
02:13:45,217 --> 02:13:46,047
Brother!

1983
02:13:46,952 --> 02:13:48,249
What happened?

1984
02:13:50,255 --> 02:13:51,882
Did she slap you?

1985
02:13:53,925 --> 02:13:55,449
What is this, my girl?
Aren't you a girl yourself?

1986
02:13:55,694 --> 02:13:57,958
How can you
harass another girl?

1987
02:13:58,063 --> 02:13:59,462
You didn't like this right?

1988
02:13:59,564 --> 02:14:00,656
Then return it to her

1989
02:14:01,566 --> 02:14:03,158
Why should we accept
stuff from strangers?

1990
02:14:03,268 --> 02:14:04,292
Go ahead,
give it back to her

1991
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:09,297
My dear girl! lt lacks a punch

1992
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,375
Give one more

1993
02:14:14,246 --> 02:14:16,271
That was a cracker!
Happy festival?

1994
02:14:17,616 --> 02:14:20,483
Aren't you advocate
Panikker's sister?

1995
02:14:21,086 --> 02:14:23,384
l will give him enough
work for today

1996
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:31,486
Come, our vehicle is

1999
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:39,659
Night, the night is auspicious

2000
02:14:39,971 --> 02:14:41,302
Sorry, l came to pee

2001
02:14:41,406 --> 02:14:42,998
Where is the bathroom

2002
02:14:43,141 --> 02:14:43,698

02:14:45,544 --> 02:14:47,102
Why are you here?

2005
02:14:47,212 --> 02:14:50,648
Brother's always keep
an eye on their sister's

2006
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:51,511
That's good

2007
02:14:51,616 --> 02:14:54,016
To save them from
vulgar chaps like you

2008
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:56,111
You rascal,
you want my sister, eh?

2009
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:57,119
Don't kill me

2010
02:14:57,222 --> 02:15:02,216
They promised me
5 lakhs to 'spoil' your sister

2011
02:15:02,327 --> 02:15:04,192
That Panikker sir, forgive me

2012
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:07,496
You will do anything
for money right?

2013
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:11,366
No...yes...do you want me to?

2014

Fix the rate

2015
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:18,235
Tell me, do you want to marry
Panikker's sister who is worth in crores?

2016
02:15:18,577 --> 02:15:20,602
l will tell you how

2017
02:15:22,547 --> 02:15:25,914
Catch!
Oh, got him!

2018
02:15:30,655 --> 02:15:32,953
- Greetings, sir
- Why are you here?

2019
02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:34,150
l came out
to have a couple of drinks

2020
02:15:34,259 --> 02:15:35,556
l came to know you were here

2021
02:15:35,627 --> 02:15:36,218
May l sit?

2022
02:15:36,294 --> 02:15:38,728
lsn't that why the chair is for, sit

2023
02:15:39,097 --> 02:15:43,329
On my way here
l heard a cry from room #101

2024
02:15:43,535 --> 02:15:46,629
Don't hurt me, please let me go
Please help, and so on

2025
02:15:46,938 --> 02:15:49,998
This is a lodge
We do hear such things

2026
02:15:50,108 --> 02:15:53,236
- Why don't we go enquire?
- Why? Not necessary

2027
02:15:53,445 --> 02:15:55,106
We'll regret

2028
02:15:55,213 --> 02:15:56,339
As long as
you don't have regrets

2029
02:15:56,481 --> 02:15:58,073
Why don't l call the police?

2030
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:02,517
Not when l,
such a big lawyer is alive here

2031
02:16:02,621 --> 02:16:05,249
Not you

2032
02:16:05,423 --> 02:16:07,220
Hello control room?

2033
02:16:08,093 --> 02:16:09,617
l am advocate Pannikker

2034
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:13,591
City hotel room # 101 has
immoral activities going on

2035
02:16:13,665 --> 02:16:17,499
No, you can come slowly
Okay

2036
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:19,263
But if they don't hurry up
everything will be lost

2037
02:16:19,371 --> 02:16:21,032
lt should, that's the idea

2038
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:21,639
Let me leave

2039
02:16:21,706 --> 02:16:23,606

Let's call a few papers also

2042
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:29,946
That will be shameful

2043
02:16:30,048 --> 02:16:32,016
That's the idea

2044
02:16:32,117 --> 02:16:34,608
Hello? 'Thee Kutty?'

2045
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:38,320

- ls it necessary?

02:17:13,491 --> 02:17:14,185
How was it?

2058
02:17:14,259 --> 02:17:16,227
S(u)excess!

2059
02:17:19,397 --> 02:17:21,331
Sister!

2060
02:17:22,767 --> 02:17:24,667
lsn't this your own sister?

2061
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:26,935
Did you insist
for me to watch this?

2062
02:17:27,038 --> 02:17:29,666
Don't rub it in, Chakravarthi

2063
02:17:37,515 --> 02:17:39,107
- What is this?
- Avial

2064
02:17:39,217 --> 02:17:40,411
ls this avial?

2065
02:17:40,518 --> 02:17:42,645
Don't you know
to prepare anything tasty?

2066
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:45,348
Then dismiss me

2067
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:47,658
You can forget such dreams

2068
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:51,256
The avial is not bad
Can't say he made it at all

2069
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:53,021
Then eat it

2070
02:17:54,466 --> 02:17:55,091
Shall l serve?

2071
02:17:55,166 --> 02:17:56,633
No, l wasjust being nice

2072
02:17:56,735 --> 02:17:58,259
l refuse to spoil my stomach

2073
02:17:58,370 --> 02:18:02,704
l can't find fault with
my own cooking, so l'll eat it

2074
02:18:02,974 --> 02:18:07,707
- What happened to uncle?
- lt's his daughter's birthday

2075
02:18:07,979 --> 02:18:10,971
He went early morning
with that sari

2076
02:18:11,082 --> 02:18:11,980
He came right back

2077
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:19,320
Like a dog that went to a market
Hejust sat there and cried

2078
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:21,619
l have seen Doberman moaning

2079
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:25,196
But 1st time l'm seeing
an ombudsman do it

2080
02:18:32,771 --> 02:18:37,299
Uncle she refused
to accept your gift, didn't she?

2081
02:18:38,043 --> 02:18:40,511
That's nothing new

2082
02:18:40,612 --> 02:18:47,040
Uncle, she will come
in this saree to see you

2083
02:18:47,952 --> 02:18:49,544
l will bring her

2084
02:18:57,362 --> 02:18:58,624
Don't undress please

2085
02:18:58,730 --> 02:19:01,096
There's a poor husband
sitting here

2086
02:19:01,199 --> 02:19:02,461
What are you doing
in my room?

2087
02:19:02,567 --> 02:19:03,761
l came to rape

2088
02:19:05,203 --> 02:19:07,763
l just came to wish you, my dear

2089
02:19:09,607 --> 02:19:11,302
Many, many happy
returns of the day

2090
02:19:11,543 --> 02:19:13,534
l never accept wishes
from people l dislike

2091
02:19:13,645 --> 02:19:14,202
But l like

2092
02:19:14,312 --> 02:19:15,540
- l don't
- But won't you?

2093
02:19:15,647 --> 02:19:17,012
- No
- No?

2094
02:19:17,182 --> 02:19:18,274
Okay

2095
02:19:21,052 --> 02:19:26,490
You dad bought you this gift
He wants to see you wearing this

2096
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:29,025
l've given my word
that l'll take you there

2097
02:19:29,994 --> 02:19:33,327
Every year
he spends 15-20000

2098
02:19:33,965 --> 02:19:38,664
And comes to wish me
with such low class items

2099
02:19:40,372 --> 02:19:42,363
Mummy severed
those bonds long back

2100
02:19:42,474 --> 02:19:44,942
Why should l want
what mummy doesn't want?

2101
02:19:45,643 --> 02:19:48,635
Why is he so anxious
in my affairs?

2102
02:19:49,447 --> 02:19:51,779
Because he is your father
responsible for your birth

2103
02:19:53,318 --> 02:19:57,721
lf your mom just lay looking
at the sky amidst all this wealth

2104
02:19:57,989 --> 02:20:00,514
...you wouldn't be born at all
A man is needed for that

2105
02:20:00,625 --> 02:20:03,753
The man who co operated for that
was that Palakkad brahmin

2106
02:20:04,028 --> 02:20:05,723
...Balasubramanyam

2107
02:20:08,032 --> 02:20:11,263
Afather too has rights like a mother

2108
02:20:11,369 --> 02:20:14,065
lf you'd had the love
and lessons of a dad

2109
02:20:14,172 --> 02:20:16,197
...you'd have been
a much better person

2110
02:20:16,608 --> 02:20:17,575
Get out

2111
02:20:17,675 --> 02:20:19,666
That can wait
Wear this first

2112
02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:20,972
No

2113
02:20:24,149 --> 02:20:25,616
Listen to what l say, my dear

2114
02:20:25,717 --> 02:20:27,480
No...no...no

2115
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:35,016
Wear...this saree

2116
02:20:53,945 --> 02:20:57,210
Come out

2117
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:14,121
Here she is in the saree
you gifted her

2118
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:15,964
My dear...

2119
02:21:16,067 --> 02:21:18,627
l've not come
to hear sweet talk

2120
02:21:19,571 --> 02:21:24,031
When no one was at home
l just gave in to his goondaism

2121
02:21:26,077 --> 02:21:28,545
This is no heroism

2122
02:21:28,646 --> 02:21:31,774
Both of you will
count bars for this

2123
02:21:33,151 --> 02:21:35,210
You don't know my mummy

2124
02:21:35,353 --> 02:21:40,154
True we don't know
about your mummy

2125
02:21:40,258 --> 02:21:44,661
But what do you know about her?

2126
02:21:45,363 --> 02:21:47,923
She has disowned
her own husband

2127
02:21:48,032 --> 02:21:50,227
Separated the daughter
from her own father

2128
02:21:50,335 --> 02:21:54,635
After doing all this
what goodness is she claiming?

2129
02:21:56,307 --> 02:22:01,836
What have l done
to deserve this hatred?

2130
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:11,811
Go ask your mummy and grand ma
what have l done to them?

2131
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:15,818
Why did they separate you from me?

2132
02:22:16,361 --> 02:22:18,886
lf you get an answer
and if you feel they are right

2133
02:22:20,565 --> 02:22:27,767
...don't ever see me again
or talk to me

2134
02:22:35,947 --> 02:22:41,249
Don't continue
punishing that poor man

2135
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:43,047
God will not forgive you

2136
02:22:48,826 --> 02:22:51,021
You've always thought...

2137
02:22:51,129 --> 02:22:56,965
l married you
for your wealth and beauty

2138
02:22:58,736 --> 02:23:03,867
Even if you were not wealthy
l would have found you

2139
02:23:07,612 --> 02:23:11,605
There is a long lost
love still within me

2140
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:20,179
That old achu'aettan who was
your old childhood friend...

2141
02:23:20,291 --> 02:23:24,227
...whose love was so pure
Just take it that way

2142
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:28,763
Now you can go

2143
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:34,638
Don't miss the party your mom
and grandma have arranged for you

2144
02:23:35,273 --> 02:23:36,763
Take it

2145
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:51,846
Where is Lakshmi?

2146
02:23:51,956 --> 02:23:56,655
She'll come, if she's early
the attraction is lost

2147
02:23:56,761 --> 02:23:59,161
lt has to be
a surprise entry

2148
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:01,230
As a fashion designer

2149
02:24:01,332 --> 02:24:06,031
An ltalian model dress
she has designed for herself

2150
02:24:19,717 --> 02:24:22,379
What is this?

2151
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:25,350
This is my dad's gift
for my birthday

2152
02:24:26,858 --> 02:24:28,621
Where were you all this while?

2153
02:24:29,827 --> 02:24:31,021
With dad

2154
02:24:32,096 --> 02:24:35,998
Can l ask you something?
What did dad do to you?

2155
02:24:37,035 --> 02:24:40,300
Why did you keep me away
from him for so many years?

2156
02:24:41,239 --> 02:24:43,605
Why are you both silent?

2157
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:44,868
Why all this here?

2158
02:24:44,976 --> 02:24:47,740
lt's public knowledge
so let me ask it here

2159
02:24:47,945 --> 02:24:50,345
He has given her
some magic potion

2160
02:24:50,615 --> 02:24:54,551
That's what both of you did

2161
02:24:54,852 --> 02:24:58,913
Since you don't have a reply
l realize my dad's innocence

2162
02:24:59,023 --> 02:25:00,888
- l am going
- Where?

2163
02:25:01,859 --> 02:25:04,828
To celebrate my birthday
with my dad

2164
02:25:21,412 --> 02:25:26,782
l never got a reply
to my questions

2165
02:25:29,721 --> 02:25:32,588
l don't know
what is right and wrong

2166
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,354
Come

2167
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:50,865
Dad

2168
02:25:50,942 --> 02:25:52,569
Come to me, my dear

2169
02:26:09,894 --> 02:26:11,623
lf l hadn't come?

2170
02:26:13,131 --> 02:26:17,693
l had a hope you'd come

2171
02:26:20,104 --> 02:26:25,667
l noticed you always wore this
even though you could break it

2172
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:32,911
lf you could do that
you can't hate me

2173
02:26:36,154 --> 02:26:39,920
Happy birthday to you

2174
02:26:40,024 --> 02:26:46,862
Happy birthday 3 you
Happy birthday 4 you

2175
02:26:46,998 --> 02:26:48,158
Enough

2176
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:54,062
What are you doing?

2177
02:26:54,172 --> 02:26:56,163
l was testing
if it was strong enough

2178
02:26:56,274 --> 02:26:58,970
Otherwise on your much awaited
wedding night, you'll break your back

2179
02:26:59,043 --> 02:27:00,340
- Get out
- No, l won't go

2180
02:27:00,611 --> 02:27:03,637
Get out, dirty fellow

2181
02:27:07,852 --> 02:27:09,376
l understood

2182
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:19,926
What?

2183
02:27:20,031 --> 02:27:22,022
Be quick, okay?

2184
02:27:22,133 --> 02:27:25,933
l can't bend over
the key hole for too long

2185
02:27:26,037 --> 02:27:28,005
You idiot, get lost

2186
02:27:34,378 --> 02:27:36,812
Have you taken permission...

2187
02:27:37,682 --> 02:27:40,014
...from your mom and
grandma for this bravado?

2188
02:27:44,989 --> 02:27:45,956
What is it, Keshu?

2189
02:27:46,057 --> 02:27:48,651
- That is...
- What is it, tell us

2190
02:27:48,759 --> 02:27:52,354
Mallika madam had a sudden
chest pain and admitted in hospital

2191
02:27:52,663 --> 02:27:53,721
They say she's seriously ill

2192
02:27:53,831 --> 02:27:54,923
Oh God! My mom

2193
02:27:55,032 --> 02:27:59,230
Hey, it'll be nothing
We'll go, get ready

2194
02:28:00,071 --> 02:28:02,904
Look here, don't say
serious and hide

2195
02:28:03,007 --> 02:28:04,269
When is the funeral?

2196
02:28:04,375 --> 02:28:05,637
Shut up you!

2197
02:28:10,948 --> 02:28:12,040
What's happened to mummy?

2198
02:28:12,917 --> 02:28:14,885
When you went off she...

2199
02:28:15,086 --> 02:28:16,815
l want to see her

2200
02:28:23,995 --> 02:28:25,019
Mummy?

2201
02:28:31,202 --> 02:28:39,769
Why did you get angry?
l can't bear it

2202
02:28:41,979 --> 02:28:45,073
- ls he here with you?
- Yes

2203
02:28:45,249 --> 02:28:47,012
Call him

2204
02:28:48,052 --> 02:28:51,681
l want to speak to him alone

2205
02:28:54,125 --> 02:28:55,422
Go dear!

2206
02:29:04,168 --> 02:29:06,227
Lock that door

2207
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,902
Come, my son

2208
02:29:13,945 --> 02:29:14,877
Sit

2209
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:24,711
lf l die, will you
look after my daughter?

2210
02:29:27,058 --> 02:29:30,084
Why no reply?

2211
02:29:32,697 --> 02:29:33,857
Of course

2212
02:30:05,363 --> 02:30:07,763
Why do l need you,
to look after my daughter...

2213
02:30:07,865 --> 02:30:09,162
...an heiress to millions?

2214
02:30:10,101 --> 02:30:14,800
This isjust a drama
Mr Marumakan

2215
02:30:19,143 --> 02:30:22,408
How was your wedding night?

2216
02:30:22,713 --> 02:30:29,084
Oh sorry, you had to
come running here

2217
02:30:32,656 --> 02:30:37,286
l will never allow
you to touch her

2218
02:30:45,269 --> 02:30:46,930
l don't know why

2219
02:30:47,238 --> 02:30:50,969
But God has given me
a peculiar gift

2220
02:30:52,243 --> 02:30:57,044
What my detractors think
l come to know beforehand

2221
02:30:57,248 --> 02:30:58,340
Didn't follow me?

2222
02:31:00,151 --> 02:31:01,175
l'll explain

2223
02:31:04,655 --> 02:31:08,785
Afew hours ago
when she was on her way back

2224
02:31:08,893 --> 02:31:13,796
...l waited on the way like this

2225
02:31:31,382 --> 02:31:36,251
Suddenly it rained
l didn't plan it

2226
02:31:36,787 --> 02:31:39,255
God...is great

2227
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:51,791
Together in the rain
l hugged her close to me

2228
02:31:53,204 --> 02:31:57,402
Took her to the jeep

2229
02:32:33,177 --> 02:32:40,447
As golden clouds turn into droplets of rain
Like a string of dreams showering on terrain

2230
02:32:40,718 --> 02:32:47,089
Like a silent melody on and on
in the blue sky like tender hillocks

2231
02:32:48,125 --> 02:32:53,791
Like those moments so precious and prized
when misty mountain melts in deep sighs

2232
02:32:55,232 --> 02:33:01,899
My girl, a flower to my touch like feather
bursts into honeyed thrills of pleasure

2233
02:33:02,072 --> 02:33:08,978
Let me look at you once more
my beautiful one, like never before

2234
02:33:09,213 --> 02:33:10,703
You are my Meera

2235
02:33:10,814 --> 02:33:17,879
As golden clouds turn into droplets of rain
Like a string of dreams showering on terrain

2236
02:33:39,877 --> 02:33:47,249
Under the adorned canopy of my dreams
l stand beside you waiting, my sweet

2237
02:33:47,318 --> 02:33:54,815
To place a kiss your forehead, l yearned
where the vermilion dot had faintly faded

2238
02:33:55,259 --> 02:34:02,665
As shyness envelops like dark ink diffusing
Come, like auspicious memento of memories

2239
02:34:02,766 --> 02:34:12,801
Far far away as the sky sleeps drawing
patterns, it's a new moment of awareness

2240
02:34:13,777 --> 02:34:21,411
As golden clouds turn into droplets of rain
Like a string of dreams showering on terrain

2241
02:34:43,173 --> 02:34:50,443
This birth is for wicks of ghee
within this body to burn

2242
02:34:50,714 --> 02:34:58,382
To turn into a season of flowers,
fragrant and dewy morn

2243
02:34:58,689 --> 02:35:02,284
Wearing flowers
in your curly hair

2244
02:35:02,359 --> 02:35:05,920
Come like a swan
with elegance and grace

2245
02:35:06,063 --> 02:35:16,029
Coquettish kisses kindle cupidity
Moments of hush...of utter secrecyl

2246
02:35:17,107 --> 02:35:24,946
As golden clouds turn into droplets of rain
Like a string of dreams showering on terrain

2247
02:35:40,531 --> 02:35:46,902
ln that car, everything was over
Oh, l feel so shy

2248
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:55,144
l didn't realize
how time has flown

2249
02:35:55,245 --> 02:35:56,212
l am going now

2250
02:35:56,413 --> 02:35:59,382
l don't know
how to fix those ECG thingy

2251
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:00,712
So put them on
yourself and go back

2252
02:36:00,818 --> 02:36:02,217
...to your position of
unconsciousness, okay?

2253
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:05,982
Our personal matters
l won't discuss with my wife

2254
02:36:06,457 --> 02:36:09,984
lf God blesses us
you'll be a grandma in 10 months

2255
02:36:10,094 --> 02:36:12,221
Let me go, grandma

2256
02:36:34,251 --> 02:36:36,719
You wanted to
see me urgently

2257
02:36:37,454 --> 02:36:39,718
Was it to stare at me
and frighten me?

2258
02:36:39,957 --> 02:36:41,686
l want my daughter

2259
02:36:41,925 --> 02:36:44,723
What do you want
to release her?

2260
02:36:47,364 --> 02:36:48,854
What will you give?

2261
02:36:51,769 --> 02:36:53,168
1 crore

2262
02:36:55,806 --> 02:36:57,171
2

2263
02:37:00,444 --> 02:37:01,502
3

2264
02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:08,440
1000 crores worth assets
offering me just 3 crores?

2265
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:12,284
4

2266
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:13,014
5

2267
02:37:13,223 --> 02:37:14,986
5 crores fixed

2268
02:37:26,003 --> 02:37:29,097
This is my personal cheque

2269
02:37:38,515 --> 02:37:43,077
You go back on your word
lt will no longer be local thugs

2270
02:37:43,454 --> 02:37:47,083
We have people in Mumbai also

2271
02:37:47,791 --> 02:37:49,691
l love Mumbai

2272
02:37:52,396 --> 02:37:55,160
My son and l know
what happened very well

2273
02:37:55,532 --> 02:37:57,363
A hasty wedding
without proper enquiry

2274
02:37:57,468 --> 02:37:59,959
...to prove your might
against your husband

2275
02:38:00,204 --> 02:38:01,466
lt wasn't necessary

2276
02:38:01,905 --> 02:38:05,238
My little girl has not spent
a single day with him

2277
02:38:05,442 --> 02:38:08,002
We all know it
But not the world

2278
02:38:08,846 --> 02:38:12,441
Your daughter will only
have a 2nd marriage

2279
02:38:12,816 --> 02:38:14,181
My son does not
have a problem

2280
02:38:14,351 --> 02:38:16,979
Yet there are legal aspects to it

2281
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:19,247
You have to legally
separate them

2282
02:38:19,456 --> 02:38:22,823
Ashok Chakravarthy is
ready to sign on any paper

2283
02:38:23,093 --> 02:38:25,152
l have settled him

2284
02:38:25,262 --> 02:38:27,958
Very good
Then it's easy

2285
02:38:28,732 --> 02:38:32,361
But a little change
from my old demand

2286
02:38:32,536 --> 02:38:34,504
A power of attorney
on all your wealth

2287
02:38:35,506 --> 02:38:39,670
lf you do that, we can find
the next auspicious day

2288
02:38:41,712 --> 02:38:45,808
l didn't find the need
for any more delay

2289
02:38:49,553 --> 02:38:51,851
ls it wise to delay this?

2290
02:38:51,955 --> 02:38:57,985
l believe he is a gentleman
Just sign it, my dear

2291
02:38:58,161 --> 02:39:01,426
Our daughter's life
is more important

2292
02:39:29,893 --> 02:39:32,919
We decide the wedding day
as soon as possible

2293
02:39:33,463 --> 02:39:34,452
Okay

2294
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,200
Come, my dear

2295
02:39:47,911 --> 02:39:52,245
l knew you'd return
understanding everything

2296
02:39:53,083 --> 02:39:54,141
What is he doing here?

2297
02:39:54,251 --> 02:39:55,718
l will explain

2298
02:39:55,819 --> 02:39:57,719
Before that, explain this

2299
02:39:59,122 --> 02:40:00,453
What is this?

2300
02:40:02,125 --> 02:40:03,854
This is my personal cheque

2301
02:40:03,961 --> 02:40:06,896
l had to settle that scoundrel
with a cash payment

2302
02:40:07,397 --> 02:40:12,096
Not worth Rs 5,
l had to pay 5 crore

2303
02:40:12,169 --> 02:40:15,730
You cannot decide
the price of my husband, l will

2304
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:17,907
How will you do that?

2305
02:40:18,008 --> 02:40:22,707
When you don't value
your own husband

2306
02:40:24,815 --> 02:40:27,477
A husband is not someone
to be eliminated with money

2307
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:28,877
Dear, you are...

2308
02:40:28,952 --> 02:40:34,288
Hereafter don't
interfere in my life

2309
02:40:35,859 --> 02:40:37,087
lf you do...

2310
02:40:55,479 --> 02:40:59,074
Sorry madam, l've been
asked not to permit you inside

2311
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:00,780
Who said so?

2312
02:41:00,884 --> 02:41:01,782
The new boss

2313
02:41:01,918 --> 02:41:03,909
Which new boss?
You just open the gate!

2314
02:41:03,987 --> 02:41:04,453
lmpossible madam!

2315
02:41:04,554 --> 02:41:07,387
These are orders
from advocate Ramachandra Menon

2316
02:41:22,239 --> 02:41:23,365
Wait! Wait!

2317
02:41:23,473 --> 02:41:25,464
Where are you
off to in a flurry?

2318
02:41:25,742 --> 02:41:26,106
Keshu!

2319
02:41:26,209 --> 02:41:27,972
Have you come
to see the new boss?

2320
02:41:28,111 --> 02:41:29,635
Have you got
prior permission?

2321
02:41:29,746 --> 02:41:31,008
New boss?

2322
02:41:31,481 --> 02:41:32,948
- Get out of my way
- Wait!

2323
02:41:33,050 --> 02:41:37,817
Excuse me, he's not the Keshu
you've been bullying all these days

2324
02:41:37,921 --> 02:41:39,980
He's Chief Security Officer
to the new boss

2325
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:41,114
l will deal with the 2 of you...!

2326
02:41:41,258 --> 02:41:42,987
What's happening here?

2327
02:41:46,263 --> 02:41:49,323
- Hey! Send them in
- Okay, you can go

2328
02:41:49,433 --> 02:41:51,833
What is it?
What are your intentions?

2329
02:41:52,002 --> 02:41:54,493
Sorry, l was too busy
to give you explanations

2330
02:41:54,938 --> 02:41:56,337
Were you busy
transferring everything

2331
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:58,908
...with the power of attorney
l had assigned you?

2332
02:41:59,242 --> 02:42:02,040
Not assigned me
To my boss

2333
02:42:02,145 --> 02:42:02,941
Which boss?

2334
02:42:03,046 --> 02:42:04,707
Who is this boss
you are acting for?

2335
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:10,150
He?

2336
02:42:10,554 --> 02:42:12,818
Not me
Sir is in there

2337
02:42:40,951 --> 02:42:44,079
l am Chakravarthy
Ashoka Chakravarthy

2338
02:42:44,387 --> 02:42:47,220
l got my scepter, crown
and kingdom only now

2339
02:42:48,091 --> 02:42:49,422
Why are you shocked?

2340
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:51,491
What's your business here?

2341
02:42:54,464 --> 02:42:58,491
You can laugh, but be warned
lt's only a prelude to sorrow

2342
02:42:58,835 --> 02:43:00,427
There is a court
and justice here

2343
02:43:00,871 --> 02:43:04,204
Later, when jailed don't come
begging for mercy at our feet

2344
02:43:04,474 --> 02:43:06,237
Me? At your feet?

2345
02:43:06,977 --> 02:43:10,879
ln the blink of an eye
you've lost an empire

2346
02:43:11,047 --> 02:43:13,277
You will be the ones
to beg at my feet, okay?

2347
02:43:13,383 --> 02:43:16,443
- You cheat
- Of course, l am

2348
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:19,947
Sudden millionaires
have behind them

2349
02:43:20,056 --> 02:43:22,320
...such stories of
betrayal and cheating

2350
02:43:22,926 --> 02:43:24,120
lsn't that right grandma?

2351
02:43:25,028 --> 02:43:27,189
l was busy scripting a drama...

2352
02:43:27,297 --> 02:43:29,231
...as to how to become
a millionaire suddenly

2353
02:43:29,332 --> 02:43:33,234
They are all good characters
in my story, not villains

2354
02:43:33,537 --> 02:43:34,799
Haven't you heard?

2355
02:43:34,971 --> 02:43:40,500
Life is a drama, the world a stage
God is the director, and we are all actors

2356
02:43:41,278 --> 02:43:44,736
This lPS here, he's
my childhood friend Madhu Ram

2357
02:43:44,948 --> 02:43:48,111
His dad, Ramachandran sir
l've practiced as a junior under him

2358
02:43:48,251 --> 02:43:49,377
He's actually my teacher

2359
02:43:51,054 --> 02:43:53,113
His proposal to marry Rajalakshmi

2360
02:43:53,557 --> 02:43:57,118
...and later withdrawing
because of wealth, was my script

2361
02:43:57,527 --> 02:44:00,121
When l got married
to your daughter...

2362
02:44:00,230 --> 02:44:03,529
...l brought them only
as guests in the first half

2363
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:06,360
But seeing
the twist after interval

2364
02:44:06,469 --> 02:44:09,199
l realized l needed them
in the 2nd half

2365
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:12,105
Now their roles
are over in this story

2366
02:44:12,175 --> 02:44:13,335
- Thank you
- We'll leave

2367
02:44:13,443 --> 02:44:14,774
Thank you

2368
02:44:15,011 --> 02:44:17,138
l have arranged
a family get-together

2369
02:44:17,214 --> 02:44:18,146
We will meet

2370
02:44:19,015 --> 02:44:20,243
You win

2371
02:44:21,318 --> 02:44:26,551
Chakravarthy, just her signature
or whatever the drama you put up...

2372
02:44:26,923 --> 02:44:29,016
...is not going to
make you own anything

2373
02:44:29,326 --> 02:44:32,022
lt will have
no value in the court

2374
02:44:32,596 --> 02:44:33,893
Why not?

2375
02:44:34,030 --> 02:44:39,525
Raja's group was solely owned by
Raja Venkateshwara Chettiar, your husband

2376
02:44:40,237 --> 02:44:42,364
After his demise
his only daughter

2377
02:44:42,439 --> 02:44:44,907
...Raja Mallika
inherited the entire wealth

2378
02:44:45,075 --> 02:44:48,943
No! lt is l who inherited it

2379
02:44:49,446 --> 02:44:53,314
Her signature has no value
l will prove it in the court

2380
02:44:53,850 --> 02:44:55,875
Don't try teaching
law to a lawyer, okay?

2381
02:44:56,219 --> 02:44:58,119
l will prove very easily

2382
02:44:58,221 --> 02:44:59,552
...that she is the sole
inheritor of all this wealth

2383
02:44:59,789 --> 02:45:02,019
- You cannot!
- l will! l can!

2384
02:45:02,125 --> 02:45:03,990
- No!
- Why not?

2385
02:45:04,094 --> 02:45:06,221
Because she is
not my daughter!

2386
02:45:32,255 --> 02:45:33,222
What did you say?

2387
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:39,228
- l...
- Say it again?

2388
02:45:41,031 --> 02:45:45,297
This Rajamallika is
not your daughter, right?

2389
02:45:49,406 --> 02:45:50,430
What are you saying, mom?

2390
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:51,905
Relax

2391
02:45:53,243 --> 02:45:56,872
lt was for this reply
l have struggled all this while

2392
02:45:57,247 --> 02:45:58,236
Didn't you hear?

2393
02:45:58,548 --> 02:46:00,209
That you are not the daughter of...

2394
02:46:00,283 --> 02:46:02,751
...Raja Venkiteshwara Chettiar
and Rajakokila

2395
02:46:03,219 --> 02:46:04,277
Then who are you?

2396
02:46:04,354 --> 02:46:06,982
- l said that simply
- Hey! Grand ma

2397
02:46:07,357 --> 02:46:10,417
You can't lie hereafter, please

2398
02:46:11,962 --> 02:46:16,262
You who ruled over the world
with your wealth and aristocracy

2399
02:46:16,333 --> 02:46:22,465
...should face the truth now
You are an orphan

2400
02:46:23,606 --> 02:46:25,767
But not really

2401
02:46:26,009 --> 02:46:27,909
You have a mom?
lsn't that right, grandma?

2402
02:46:28,244 --> 02:46:29,541
No! No!

2403
02:46:29,946 --> 02:46:32,244
Grandma!
Why become emotional?

2404
02:46:32,415 --> 02:46:35,179
You are not a bad character
Circumstances

2405
02:46:35,318 --> 02:46:38,048
That's what gave you
this role of wickedness

2406
02:46:38,321 --> 02:46:40,949
Grandma has a story
that you do not know

2407
02:46:41,458 --> 02:46:44,825
The story of Kokila
a poor middle class girl

2408
02:46:45,061 --> 02:46:47,291
Who was noticed
by a womanizer

2409
02:46:47,397 --> 02:46:49,422
...and middle-aged
Raja Venkatesha Chettiar

2410
02:46:49,566 --> 02:46:52,296
This story begins there

2411
02:47:07,484 --> 02:47:12,148
ln spite of Chettiar's efforts
Kokila never fell into his trap

2412
02:47:12,389 --> 02:47:16,325
But finally Chettiar used
threats and married her

2413
02:47:16,526 --> 02:47:20,360
Satisfied with his conquest
Kokila later became a burden

2414
02:47:20,430 --> 02:47:24,161
He harassed her no end
lsn't it, grandma?

2415
02:47:39,249 --> 02:47:43,185
Kokila who was pregnant
was hospitalized after he kicked her

2416
02:47:43,553 --> 02:47:48,320
Losing her baby and faced
with the truth that she'll never...

2417
02:47:48,892 --> 02:47:53,920
...bear a child again, she got out
of hospital hearing joyful news

2418
02:47:54,397 --> 02:47:56,524
That Chettiar had died
in an accident

2419
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:02,265
She realized that she'd
inherited all his wealth

2420
02:48:02,906 --> 02:48:07,240
Thus simple Kokila
became Raja Kokila

2421
02:48:10,814 --> 02:48:14,875
She was alone in this world
but with plenty of riches

2422
02:48:15,085 --> 02:48:18,885
She wanted a child to love
and to love her back

2423
02:48:19,422 --> 02:48:21,253
She adopted a child

2424
02:48:30,033 --> 02:48:33,059
That child
is this Raja Mallika

2425
02:48:33,236 --> 02:48:34,533
lsn't that correct, grandma?

2426
02:48:38,875 --> 02:48:40,433
The story is not yet over

2427
02:48:40,910 --> 02:48:46,405
That child's mother, years later
came claiming her daughter

2428
02:48:58,561 --> 02:49:03,260
She couldn't live
without her child

2429
02:49:03,399 --> 02:49:05,924
Neither could Raja Kokila
give up her adopted child

2430
02:49:06,469 --> 02:49:10,428
Finally she solved
that problem

2431
02:49:10,507 --> 02:49:12,600
...by appointing her
as a servant here

2432
02:49:12,976 --> 02:49:14,170
The mother could
see her daughter

2433
02:49:14,277 --> 02:49:18,111
But the child must
never know the truth

2434
02:49:18,448 --> 02:49:23,112
That mother's been with you
from the time you remember

2435
02:49:24,387 --> 02:49:28,949
The woman you bullied, beat
and abused...Bhavaniamma

2436
02:49:36,232 --> 02:49:42,137
Now you wish that the earth
would split and swallow you, eh?

2437
02:49:43,606 --> 02:49:49,841
l'd noticed Raja Kokila had
a soft corner for Bhavaniamma

2438
02:49:53,183 --> 02:49:56,619
That was how l found out
everything from Bhavaniamma

2439
02:49:57,053 --> 02:49:58,315
l would not
have said anything

2440
02:49:58,521 --> 02:50:03,857
But l wanted to
subdue your arrogance...

2441
02:50:03,993 --> 02:50:06,985
...and bring you down
into an ordinary woman

2442
02:50:07,163 --> 02:50:09,028
Only the truth could
make that happen

2443
02:50:09,599 --> 02:50:11,567
You are a nobody now

2444
02:50:21,411 --> 02:50:24,141
lf you have even
an ounce of regret

2445
02:50:24,414 --> 02:50:27,850
...first beg forgiveness
at the feet of your mother

2446
02:50:28,084 --> 02:50:29,779
And then your husband's

2447
02:50:31,387 --> 02:50:33,355
Grandma's fear
was the reason

2448
02:50:33,523 --> 02:50:35,184
...to separate you
and your husband

2449
02:50:35,525 --> 02:50:40,360
She believed all men
were like Chettiar

2450
02:50:40,563 --> 02:50:45,523
lncluding the man
you loved and married

2451
02:50:45,868 --> 02:50:47,096
She separated the 2 of you

2452
02:50:47,270 --> 02:50:53,038
Moreover her possessiveness, right?

2453
02:50:53,376 --> 02:50:55,844
lt was her 2nd reason

2454
02:51:00,583 --> 02:51:04,883
Take, l don't want
a paisa from you

2455
02:51:05,555 --> 02:51:07,352
l know how to live
without all this

2456
02:51:09,158 --> 02:51:10,523
Lakshmi!

2457
02:51:17,267 --> 02:51:18,529
l don't have wealth

2458
02:51:19,168 --> 02:51:24,333
But l have plenty of love
which no money can buy

2459
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:27,568
l got her only
with that wealth

2460
02:51:28,011 --> 02:51:30,241
l am taking away
only her from here

2461
02:51:31,214 --> 02:51:32,613
Come, Lakshmi

2462
02:51:40,089 --> 02:51:44,025
You always said you were
writing a drama based on life

2463
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:46,255
Doesn't it have a climax?

2464
02:51:46,529 --> 02:51:48,292
Climax is over, you fool

2465
02:51:49,265 --> 02:51:50,289
Over?
When?

2466
02:51:50,566 --> 02:51:55,230
So isn't there a scene where
everyone stands and smiles?

2467
02:51:56,239 --> 02:51:57,570
What you mean is tail end

2468
02:51:58,107 --> 02:52:01,440
For that many characters
who are scattered have to come

2469
02:52:09,652 --> 02:52:11,142
One of the character has come

2470
02:52:14,424 --> 02:52:16,619
That is not the arrogant
wife Raja Mallika

2471
02:52:16,893 --> 02:52:20,590
She is the ideal wife
you've always wanted

2472
02:52:20,830 --> 02:52:22,957
Go bring her in
Go!

2473
02:52:31,341 --> 02:52:32,638
!...

2474
02:52:33,976 --> 02:52:39,937
Whatever you may have lost
there is a position you'll never lose

2475
02:52:40,283 --> 02:52:43,150
The position as the wife
of Balasubramanyam

2476
02:52:44,921 --> 02:52:48,152
The wonderful moment of
a husband and wife reconciled

2477
02:52:59,969 --> 02:53:00,833
Mother!

2478
02:53:05,875 --> 02:53:08,935
A lonely mother who
gets back her own daughter...

2479
02:53:09,178 --> 02:53:11,510
...a dramatic moment

2480
02:53:13,850 --> 02:53:16,114
Next character has come

2481
02:53:19,655 --> 02:53:20,986
Why haven't you
got out grandma?

2482
02:53:21,124 --> 02:53:25,891
Come, grandma

2483
02:53:27,063 --> 02:53:29,190
All of you left me alone there

2484
02:53:29,465 --> 02:53:31,558
Who said you are alone?

2485
02:53:32,602 --> 02:53:34,331
l can't part from them

2486
02:53:34,871 --> 02:53:36,839
Who asked you to part?

2487
02:53:36,906 --> 02:53:41,206
We consider all this
just mischief on your part

2488
02:53:41,978 --> 02:53:45,539
When people get older
they behave like kids

2489
02:53:45,915 --> 02:53:46,882
ls that so?

2490
02:53:47,617 --> 02:53:50,848
Then all of you must
come to my house

2491
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:52,114
All of us will

2492
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:56,191
But for a few days grandma
should stay with us in this small house

2493
02:53:57,393 --> 02:54:01,853
Love and care
mixed together...

2494
02:54:01,964 --> 02:54:06,230
...and slammed into vital parts
will win you the girl of your life

2495
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:08,929
Most men don't know this

2496
02:54:09,372 --> 02:54:12,569
Sir, this son-in -law
you got is a treasure

2497
02:54:12,942 --> 02:54:14,432
Mr Marumakan

2498
