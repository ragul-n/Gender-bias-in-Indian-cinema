1
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:40,733
Brother, why are you so worried?

2
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:43,293
It's an auspicious day.

3
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:46,693
Well, I don't have to
worry as long as you're here.

4
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,646
I'm just a little nervous.

5
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,213
You're the one giving him advice?

6
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:56,014
You remember, when Jassi
was to be born, you were petrified.

7
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,039
You kept walking from here to there.

8
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,439
Dad, to be honest,
I'm feeling the same way.

9
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,119
He had no one to talk to.

10
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,439
But I've been asking Jassi
if it's going to be a boy or girl.

11
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,479
- But he doesn't tell.
- It's futile asking him.

12
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,599
He won't tell.

13
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:18,199
Sir, Jaddi is a Sardar's son.
It won't be so easy.

14
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,559
He'll speak only when he feels like.

15
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,759
Idiots! A child always
calls out to his mother first.

16
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,559
Nothing else. He'll say 'mother' too.

17
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,039
This is not done.
He's with me all the time.

18
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,679
He will call out to me first.

19
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,679
Sir, congratulations! It's a boy!

20
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,959
There you are! Congratulations!

21
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,319
Well done, sons! You've made
me very happy by giving me grandsons!

22
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,959
Sir, this means the neighbouring
villages will get the news..

23
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,559
..this year, on 'Lohri'.

24
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,319
- Gogi.
- Yes.

25
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,159
It's my brother's son.

26
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,399
It's a big deal. Forget
about the neighbouring villages..

27
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
..I'll spread the word
in the whole of Punjab.

28
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,799
That would be good.

29
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,359
My dear child.

30
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,439
His aunt has carried him,
he's mine now.

31
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,679
Really!

32
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,559
Shera, your son looks
nothing like you.

33
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,519
He's much more beautiful.

34
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,879
Don't you dare tease him!
Right, Sherry?

35
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,839
Absolutely, Sister-in-law.

36
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,919
- Here, hold your son.
- Watch it.

37
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,519
Careful. Careful.

38
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,879
Dad, all said and done,
it's a great feeling to be a father.

39
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,039
- Just hold him.
- Give me.

40
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,599
- That's true.
- Here. Take it.

41
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,279
My sweet child!

42
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,719
My sweetheart!

43
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,479
The children are drinking milk.

44
00:04:56,007 --> 00:05:00,439
Before they are done drinking it,
I want my first tractor.

45
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,439
Do you understand?

46
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,159
Hey!

47
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,519
Don't worry, Dad.

48
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,639
We did shoot a few of his men.

49
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,319
But we will send money
to his family every month.

50
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,559
Great!

51
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,119
Wow! That was a good one!

52
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,039
It went quite high.

53
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,319
This is nothing.

54
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,959
When I hit a shot,
it reaches the other village.

55
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,679
- Don't boast.
- Don't boast.

56
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,199
Okay, then, the next lane.

57
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,359
- Don't boast.
- I'm not boasting.

58
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,599
Come on, agree.

59
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,959
Brother, when you get married,
we're going to have a blast.

60
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,839
These firecrackers are nothing.

61
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,279
We'll light countless firecrackers.

62
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,759
The villagers should know
that it's Jassi's brother's wedding.

63
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,399
It's not an ordinary affair.

64
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,079
Listen, Brother!

65
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,199
When this one gets married..

66
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,239
..and his sisters-in-law
ask for a token to cut the ribbon..

67
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:19,719
..it doesn't matter what they ask for,
we'll give them Rs. 21,000.

68
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,599
People should know that
it's Jaddi's son's wedding.

69
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,199
Right?

70
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,919
Friends,
our village has been holding..

71
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,079
..tractor races for many years now.

72
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,279
I welcome all the
gentlemen present here..

73
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:59,559
..the chief guests,
and all the young men..

74
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,479
..participating in the race.

75
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,559
I think everyone's waiting
for a special person.

76
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,799
The wait is finally over.

77
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,639
Those two young men
have reached the ground.

78
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,799
Well, the sons of Jaddi Sardar..

79
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,599
..have reached the ground.

80
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,879
On one hand is Jassa,
and on the other hand, Jeeta.

81
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,679
The competition will begin.

82
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,319
We will soon have a winner.

83
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,799
The silencers of tractors
are emitting smoke.

84
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,839
The boys are all set.

85
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,399
Just some more time
until the race begins.

86
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,119
And the race starts now!

87
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,719
- "They have the same style."
- It's equal!

88
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,559
"Nothing can separate them."

89
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,639
Wonderful, boys! You two are great!

90
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:17,799
- "They are inseparable."
- Well done, boys! I knew it!

91
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,439
This has been happening
for the past five years..

92
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,999
..and it's happened again.

93
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,519
Both the sons of Jaddi Sardar
have won the race yet again..

94
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:29,119
..like they have been winning
for the past five years.

95
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,679
A huge round of applause for them.

96
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,879
I request the chief guest
to honour the winners..

97
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,439
- ..bless them and say a few words.
- Greetings!

98
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,399
A huge round of applause once again.

99
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,599
Wonderful! You're too good, boys!
God bless!

100
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,239
I had heard that
strength lies in unity..

101
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,119
..but I witnessed it today.

102
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,359
I'm so happy to see such
love between cousin brothers.

103
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,599
I bless you that you
to stay together always.

104
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:25,959
"The others hold no place before us."

105
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,679
"When Sikhs fulfil friendship,
it becomes a memorable one."

106
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:42,639
"We defeat death. Death!"

107
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:50,330
"We defeat death!
We make a name for ourselves!"

108
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:58,079
"We rule the world.
We can't be tamed!"

109
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:08,959
"We rule the world.
We can't be tamed!"

110
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,759
"Those who leave the
battlefield are weak."

111
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,559
"They give up before
the circumstances."

112
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,519
"They give up before
the circumstances."

113
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,279
"Those who fight the circumstances.."

114
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,439
"..emerge victorious
and leave a mark."

115
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,679
"Emerge victorious and leave a mark."

116
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,959
"They have no knowledge of weapons."

117
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,799
"They have no knowledge."

118
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,799
"They have no knowledge of weapons."

119
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,119
"They are weapons themselves."

120
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:06,679
"We rule the world.
We can't be tamed!"

121
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:17,479
"We rule the world.
We can't be tamed!"

122
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,759
Our sons won again.

123
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,719
Thank the Lord.

124
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,719
Both of you are together.

125
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,919
Are we going to get food tonight?

126
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,759
I can't help it, Father-in-law.

127
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,319
Sister-in-law Sukhi
doesn't let me work.

128
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,279
She wants to do everything on her own.

129
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,919
Look at you!
Why would you work when I'm here?

130
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,359
I'll manage everything.
And cooking isn't a big deal.

131
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,479
I'll cook in no time.

132
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,879
Tonight, we won't get what we like.

133
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,279
Our sons' favourite
food will be cooked tonight.

134
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:50,012
- Dessert is being prepared.
- Yes.

135
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,559
And they deserve it.
They've won, after all.

136
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,039
Yes. That's right.

137
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,039
Come, let's make
Rotis for father-in-law.

138
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,519
- Yes. Let's go.
- Come.

139
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,959
You make the vegetable quickly.
I'll knead the dough.

140
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,519
- Dad, I wanted to talk to you.
- Yes, tell me.

141
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:08,359
- There's 10 acres of land available.
- Okay.

142
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:13,079
It's worth 20 lakhs.
Do you want to buy it?

143
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,879
Sure. There's nothing to think about.

144
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:22,359
We'll buy it.
I've paid the token amount.

145
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,079
We'll pay the remaining
tomorrow and get it registered.

146
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,319
Okay.

147
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,159
- Greetings, Brother. Greetings, Dad.
- Bless you.

148
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,959
- Well, I need to talk.
- Tell me.

149
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,359
Bachan Singh came to the farm today.

150
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:44,279
He's offering a piece of land
for Rs. 30 lakhs. I said yes.

151
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,479
We'll pay him tomorrow and buy it.

152
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,919
The same is available for Rs.
20 lakhs.

153
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,959
He's paid the token amount for it.
We'll buy it tomorrow.

154
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
But Dad, I've given my word.
It's set in stone.

155
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,599
If you've given your word,
we'll buy it tomorrow.

156
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,919
But Brother,
you've paid him the token amount.

157
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,519
Silly, I've only paid the token.

158
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,599
But what you've given
is more valuable than money.

159
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,119
My brother's word
is greater than anything.

160
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,639
Thank You, God. I swear, Brother.

161
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,439
I pray to have you as
my brother in all my lives.

162
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,239
I won't find a brother like you.

163
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,119
"We're calm men."

164
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
"But if someone tries
to mess with us.."

165
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,839
"..we can teach them a lesson."

166
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,879
What's wrong with you?
I'm already late.

167
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,879
Why don't you start?

168
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,519
Turn it off.

169
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,199
Here you are.

170
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,279
- Hey, what's wrong?
- It broke down.

171
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,879
I told you, this isn't a child's play.

172
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,639
- It's difficult to get it repaired.
- Yes.

173
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,119
Why don't you make it
fall and try to start it?

174
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,279
This isn't a light scooter.
How can I make it fall?

175
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,519
You should have bought
a light scooter instead.

176
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,919
It would at least start.

177
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,519
Once, the tractor broke down.

178
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,719
I made it fall and then started it,
and it worked.

179
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,159
Dear Lord! You'll be sinned.

180
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,039
- You must have heard the idiom.
- Which one?

181
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,719
It looks good, but always buy
things that are convienent to you.

182
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,799
- He's talking nonsense.
- You never believe me.

183
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:21,159
I shook it a little and it started.

184
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,199
Don't boast early in the morning.
I'm getting late, I have a match.

185
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,559
What nonsense!

186
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,599
Will the match wait for you?

187
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,479
- Come, I'll drop you.
- On your tractor?

188
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,039
Of course,
the tractor is better than that.

189
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,159
- All right, then.
- Girls in college!

190
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,359
- Give me the key.
- Here.

191
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,719
Take this, park it inside.

192
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,679
Park it wherever you want.

193
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,799
There are no girls in my life.

194
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,679
- Okay.
- Okay.

195
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,319
"If someone comes for you,
I'll fight the world."

196
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,199
- "Come on, let's get going.."
- Nonsense!

197
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,879
Does it start from here?

198
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,399
Hey! It started!

199
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,269
All right, let me take a round!

200
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,799
Brother, my friends are looking.

201
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,719
Do I look weird in a tractor?

202
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,559
Why did you take a lift then?

203
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,799
Stop right here. Don't take it in.

204
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,199
I can do what I want.
Wait and watch, I'll land inside.

205
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,519
They'll stop you.

206
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,239
Hey, they saluted you!

207
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,079
They are like us.

208
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm getting a call.

209
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,839
I'm here.

210
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,559
- What is it now?
- I'm coming.

211
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,719
Leave the phone for some time.

212
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,119
All the time..

213
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,119
Oh, God!

214
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,119
Excuse me. Are you blind?
How could you just jump?

215
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,679
You scared her.

216
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,799
He's so shameless. Let's go, Roop.

217
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,679
- Yes?
- Let's go.

218
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,079
- I need to go to class.
- Fine.

219
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,159
I'm going.

220
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,879
This is too much.

221
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,199
This is not done.

222
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,679
This wasn't fair.

223
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,039
It's a big deal.

224
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,639
What's the matter?
Why did you call for the council?

225
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,759
We could have talked
amongst ourselves.

226
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,359
How could we have talked?
He abused publically.

227
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,399
Now the council will
take a call on this.

228
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,239
I abused, I didn't kill anyone.

229
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,799
Hey, it's the council!

230
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,639
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

231
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,719
Greetings. Greetings.

232
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,919
No one is allowed
to raise the voice here.

233
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,559
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

234
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,479
Yes, gentlemen.
Tell me, what's the matter?

235
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,119
I'll tell you, sir.

236
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,319
At the bar last night,
these two had an argument with Pindi.

237
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,719
It escalated and they abused Pindi.

238
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,919
Pindi wants justice.
He was abused publically.

239
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,359
He said he was drunk.
He didn't realise it.

240
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,199
Then tell him that he should
drink only how much he can handle.

241
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,759
If he misbehaves with
people in a drunk state..

242
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,439
..it will not be tolerated.

243
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,319
He just abused him.

244
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,519
What's the big deal?

245
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,079
A true man often abuses.

246
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,479
Don't insult your
family name by abusing.

247
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:39,679
A true man works hard,
he does not abuse.

248
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,639
If you are so hot-blooded,
go toil in the farm.

249
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,599
Why do you make the labourers do it?
Join the army.

250
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,319
You're trying to tell
me what a true man is!

251
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:53,159
He's become a teacher now.

252
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,239
Without much ado..

253
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:03,319
..Kanta,
tell them to apologise to Pindi..

254
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,119
..and make sure this
does not happen again.

255
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,159
Sir, what if I say that
my brother won't apologise?

256
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,559
You're in the council.

257
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,399
Or else, by now, your brother
would have fallen at his feet..

258
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:29,079
..and apologised to him by now.

259
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,599
We should have hit him instead.

260
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,159
I made a mistake, Pindi. Forgive me.

261
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,719
I made a mistake, Pindi. Forgive me.

262
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,639
One more thing.

263
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,599
We share an old alliance
with your family.

264
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,679
Hence, I'm being respectful.

265
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,599
Be careful. Okay?

266
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,359
All right, then. I'll leave.

267
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,879
Maintain peace, everyone.

268
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,199
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Bye.

269
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,199
- Greetings.
- Greetings. Greetings.

270
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,919
'Headman, you got away today.'

271
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,399
'The day I get you..

272
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,799
..I won't let you go.'

273
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:54,547
- Listen.
- Yes?

274
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,947
Get a glass and some water.

275
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,987
You've come drunk already.
That's enough now.

276
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,427
What are you so angry about?

277
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:03,347
Don't argue, just do as I've said!

278
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:06,627
What is it? Why are you scolding him?

279
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:09,587
You didn't raise your
voice when you should have.

280
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,427
You became a scaredy-cat.

281
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,128
You're trying to act smart here!

282
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,260
Just ask her to go in.
Stop irritating me.

283
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,660
Go in, Mom. I'll calm him down.

284
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,060
Right. He'll drink and calm down now.

285
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,820
That's why no one wants to
marry off their daughter to him.

286
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,660
Why do you say that?
His alliance is fixed now.

287
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,780
We'll have a blast at his wedding.

288
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,340
As if any alliance is going to remain,
seeing your behaviour.

289
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,860
You had an argument
with someone and you abused.

290
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,060
Moreover, you're going
around apologising to people.

291
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,860
It was my fault, not his.
And he didn't apologise.

292
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,900
We apologised because of Jagtar Singh.

293
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,060
He has made our lives
miserable already.

294
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,420
I thought my sons would take revenge.

295
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,540
I wish I had two
daughters instead of you.

296
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,540
Just wait and watch, Mom.
We will make him pay for this.

297
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,260
Get lost! You couldn't
even win the tractor race..

298
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,940
..and you want to beat them!

299
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,540
Just shut up, Mom! I'll shoot you!

300
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,300
Shoot them instead,
who shot your father and ruined us!

301
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,620
He's on the bed for years.
He's like a living corpse.

302
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,903
Shame on you.

303
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,220
Get lost!

304
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,540
Mom.

305
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,380
Mom, they shot dad and
put him on the bed for good.

306
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,260
But I'll shoot them and
put them on their death bed.

307
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,500
He'll be proud of me.
You'll be proud of your son.

308
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,580
Wake up, we've reached college.
Go and study.

309
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,780
I agree you're elder, but
it doesn't mean you can boss around.

310
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,260
You must reach college on time.

311
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,900
If you get late, it's your loss.

312
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,300
We must reach on time,
not before time.

313
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,420
It starts at 9. It's still 8 a.m.

314
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,220
When I was in college,
we used to reach college at 7 a.m.

315
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,460
We used to settle down first..

316
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,420
..and then we would go to class.

317
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,900
You know nothing about it.

318
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,140
Your master always
took short lectures.

319
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,740
Those who don't get alcohol
spread those rumours.

320
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,620
Ask those who got it.

321
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,100
Go on, then. Study.

322
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,820
I will study.

323
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,220
But I know what you're
doing these days.

324
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,180
Excuse me.
What will you study? Take your books.

325
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,940
Come home on time in the evening.

326
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,420
- Just go.
- Don't loiter around.

327
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,180
Where is she?

328
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,740
Let's go.

329
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,540
Oh, God! Why does he come?

330
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,420
Doesn't his family stop him?

331
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,300
Yes. They consider
this a matter of pride.

332
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,621
Nonsense!

333
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,420
Leave now,
or do you want admission too?

334
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm going. Why are you spying on me?

335
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,660
Trying to act smart!
Come home and you're done for!

336
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,140
What's wrong with him?

337
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,180
All of you have come together?

338
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,460
Well, the matter is, on your saying..

339
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,500
..we started the work to build
a home for the old and helpless.

340
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,660
Most of the work is done.

341
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,540
Some more work is pending,
but we've run out of money.

342
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,820
If you could ask the minister to release
the money for the grant sooner..

343
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,260
..we'll get done faster.

344
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,660
You know that the work
in our village has never been..

345
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,100
..dependent on government grants.

346
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,820
We started this on our own.

347
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,060
So, we have to complete it.

348
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,540
Swaran Singh, how much would it cost?

349
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,580
Around 4 lakhs.

350
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,820
4 lakhs?

351
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,100
It's okay.

352
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,340
- My elder son will take
care of 2 lakhs.. - Okay.

353
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,220
- ..and the younger one will
manage the remaining two. - Okay.

354
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
That's it.

355
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,900
This is a good deed.
It should not be interrupted.

356
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,780
And you know the current situation.

357
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,380
- Children don't take responsibility
of their parents. - Yes.

358
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,420
At least this will help.

359
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,860
Swaran Singh,
you should contribute too.

360
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,940
God knows what the children are up to.

361
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,780
I have a few fixed deposits.

362
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,300
The one who serves me will get it.

363
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,020
- I can contribute Rs. 50,000 too.
- Okay.

364
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,620
I'll teach you a lesson.

365
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
No!

366
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,420
- Don't..
- Hold on!

367
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,620
Listen to me! I'll thrash you!

368
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,620
Come here, you!

369
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,100
Come here!

370
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,420
Why are you after him? What's wrong?

371
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,180
Ask him, not me. He'll tell you.

372
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,460
- Well, I just..
- What is the matter?

373
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,500
What happened?
Why are you after his life?

374
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,060
How should I tell you?
It's obscene. Just leave.

375
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,500
What's obscene?

376
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,700
- Tell me.
- I can't. It's derogatory.

377
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,060
I can't tell you!

378
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,580
Dad, for God's sake,
don't tell mom even in private!

379
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,460
- Stop it!
- You idiot! Hold on!

380
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,620
Tell me!

381
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,580
- What is the matter?
- Tell me.

382
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,060
Go home. I need to tell him about it.

383
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,340
- Stop hitting my son. Tell me later.
- Go on!

384
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,060
This idiot box that he's roaming with,
that mobile..

385
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,140
..contains obscene stuff.

386
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,940
- Hey!
- It's not mine.

387
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,740
You know our friends' group.

388
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,220
Someone sent it on it and it
got downloaded on its own. That one!

389
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,620
- What group?
- Both of you are in it too.

390
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,380
- You want to download HD videos!
- You!

391
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,940
You rascal!

392
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,900
- You're putting the blame on me!
- Get him!

393
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Don't let him go! Get him!

394
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,380
What should I watch?

395
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Well, no matter what I watch,
it's all the same.

396
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,900
But one thing's for sure.
There's nothing better.

397
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,380
I think I should sleep.
I have to wake up early.

398
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,860
This is wrong.

399
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,420
When I open my eyes, you disappear.

400
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,140
I won't open my eyes now.

401
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,446
"Beautiful girl,
I won't leave your side."

402
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:57,798
"You're mine, and I will be yours."

403
00:32:57,878 --> 00:33:03,045
"You own my heart and soul."

404
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:08,517
"I won't utter anyone's
name but yours."

405
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,843
- How much does a glass cost?
- Rs. 10.

406
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,770
- Rs. 10!
- Yes.

407
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,757
They charge Rs.
10 for two glasses in our village.

408
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:17,820
We charge Rs. 10 per glass.
You better drink it in your village.

409
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:19,740
Isn't that too much?

410
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,034
- Is it?
- Yes.

411
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:26,406
- I'll tell you what,
divide one glass by two. - Okay.

412
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:38,580
"Beautiful girl,
I won't leave your side."

413
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,940
"You're mine, and I will be yours."

414
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,510
"Beautiful girl.."

415
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:59,399
"I've never spoken
to anyone other than you."

416
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:04,460
"You come to my dreams every night."

417
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:09,420
"My car seat is waiting for you."

418
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,100
"I'll take you on a drive.
I'll make you mine."

419
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:16,020
"You'll have fun with me.
I'll take you in my arms."

420
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,820
"He who loses is not a true Jatt."

421
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:29,220
"If you don't accept me,
I'll pick a weapon."

422
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,260
"Beautiful girl,
I won't leave your side."

423
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,580
"You're mine, and I will be yours."

424
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,940
"Beautiful girl.."

425
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,820
He's started following
you every day, Roop.

426
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,380
Why do you look at him? Just drink it.

427
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,300
- Here.
- No.

428
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,420
Why not?

429
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,220
It's good. We're getting free drinks.

430
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,540
- Let's go.
- Roop, let me drink at least.

431
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,300
So, did it work out?
Or is it still the same?

432
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,700
I'm just asking.

433
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,420
Please come.

434
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,620
Bhanu, get water and tea for him.

435
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,260
- Coming.
- Come, sit.

436
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,020
Dear, get water for your dad.

437
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,940
Bring some biscuits too, dear.

438
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:45,340
So, tell me, what's the news?

439
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,180
- Everything's great.
- Greetings.

440
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,340
Greetings.

441
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,060
Look, Gogi Singh, they saw your girl.

442
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,420
Here.

443
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,420
They like her too.
It's a yes from them.

444
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,140
- Thank God!
- But there's something.

445
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Look, I will give dowry
as per my capabilities.

446
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,380
It's all for my daughter, after all.

447
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,500
But if they have any demands,
let me know.

448
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,900
Go, Gogi, I'm not talking about dowry.

449
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,100
It's a sin.

450
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,580
We are against dowry.

451
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,020
I meant, the boy's family
wants the wedding to happen soon.

452
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,020
But how can I make arrangements
at such short notice?

453
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,380
Listen, just say yes to them.

454
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,100
- It's a yes from us.
- You..

455
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,420
Okay, then. I'll leave, Gogi.

456
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,820
Goodbye, ma'am.

457
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,060
- Goodbye. Greetings.
- Greetings.

458
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,060
- Why did you say yes?
- Don't worry.

459
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,060
I'll tell you what,
talk to the master first.

460
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,460
We'll find a solution. yes.

461
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,100
- Master?
- Yes.

462
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,900
Go.

463
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,380
Okay, I'll talk to him.

464
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,540
Sir, I've fixed my
daughter's alliance.

465
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,500
- That's great.
- Yes.

466
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,242
Congratulations, Gogi.

467
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,900
Congratulations to you too.

468
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,700
I just need your blessings now.

469
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,620
Please help me.

470
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,820
We can't help you.

471
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,860
Don't say that, sir.
I've served you all my life.

472
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,780
You've fed my family.

473
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,540
- Whose daughter is she, Gogi?
- Mine, sir.

474
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,180
- Then you should get her married.
- What?

475
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,340
Sir..

476
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,340
Who is your daughter's brother?

477
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,020
My son.

478
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,460
She considers your
sons as her brothers too.

479
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,580
So, then, that makes her our daughter.

480
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,020
Gogi Singh, tell me.

481
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,380
How are you going to contribute
at our daughter's wedding?

482
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,260
I? What can I do, sir?

483
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,620
Whatever little that
I have has been given by you.

484
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,580
I've been saving it,
and that's what I can give.

485
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,300
Save it for your old age.

486
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,060
She's like a daughter to us.
She'll marry in our house.

487
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,060
We'll get an excuse to celebrate too.

488
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,700
We'll have a blast.

489
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,060
You're all so great, sir.

490
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:40,260
"Boys, listen to what I have to say."

491
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,260
"Boys, listen to what I have to say."

492
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,620
"You've been blabbering
like a pigeon."

493
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,540
"This isn't your cup of tea."

494
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,620
"Watch me.
This isn't your cup of tea."

495
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,740
"Watch me.
This isn't your cup of tea."

496
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,740
"Your wig is from Lahore."

497
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,580
"You steal my heart
in broad daylight."

498
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,620
"Your wig is from Lahore."

499
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,340
"You steal my heart
in broad daylight."

500
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,900
"I feel happy to see you.."

501
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,580
"..when you dance."

502
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,860
"I am amazed to see you.."

503
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,580
"..when you dance."

504
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,860
"I am amazed to see you.."

505
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,900
"..when you dance."

506
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,820
"Flowers learn to bloom from you."

507
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,740
"If you could, you could
enchant the whole of Punjab."

508
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,900
"Your tantrums are amazing.."

509
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,620
"..when you dance."

510
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,820
"I feel proud to see you.."

511
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,620
"..when you dance."

512
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,860
"I am amazed to see you.."

513
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,540
"..when you dance."

514
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,780
"Our moustache is our pride."

515
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,100
"You have to come to
my house someday, girl."

516
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,820
"I'm proud to see you.."

517
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,580
"..when you dance."

518
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,860
"I am amazed to see you.."

519
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,580
"..when you dance."

520
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,820
"I am amazed to see you.."

521
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,700
"..when you dance."

522
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,434
I don't understand.

523
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,642
He hasn't eaten since two days.
I wonder what's wrong.

524
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,149
He doesn't even speak.

525
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:18,434
Greetings, aunt.

526
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,725
- Greetings. How are you?
- I am fine.

527
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,309
Aunt, where's brother?

528
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:23,725
In his room.

529
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:27,267
He hasn't eaten since two days.
I wonder what's wrong.

530
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:31,434
You make the same thing every day.
It's not his fault.

531
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:32,934
Okay.

532
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,767
- Are you going upstairs?
- Yes, Aunt.

533
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,642
Hold on. I'm giving you milk.

534
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,600
- Take a glass of milk.
- Okay.

535
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,184
Take this.

536
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:52,142
- Give me.
- Make sure he drinks it, okay?

537
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:54,309
If he doesn't drink it, I will.

538
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:57,850
I'll make him drink it.

539
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,809
Oh, my God!

540
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:28,975
What's wrong? Is Chamkila on leave?

541
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:37,517
'I'm yearning to
get a glimpse of you.'

542
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:42,767
'Where are you?
You seem like a dream.'

543
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,475
'I yearn to meet you.'

544
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,892
You haven't eat,
aunt has been troubling me.

545
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:49,850
Here, drink milk.

546
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,184
To heck with the milk.

547
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,229
- Laddu.
- Yes.

548
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:00,267
If you can get me a few
things written in the book..

549
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,475
..I can attain her.

550
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,934
I just read the book.

551
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:08,267
Leave my hand.
You'll get me into trouble.

552
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,182
What have you gotten into?

553
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:19,307
Have you ever felt like
you see someone all the time?

554
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:24,099
While bathing,
while sleeping, while eating? Tell me.

555
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:26,057
It happens with me all the time.

556
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:28,641
It happened a bit too much last week.

557
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,724
The policeman's daughter-in-law.

558
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:32,849
Since I've seen her..

559
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:36,349
..I can't seem to
get her out of my head.

560
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:39,391
While I read,
while I write, while I'm in bed..

561
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:41,682
..I see her everywhere.

562
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:47,474
The same thing is happening with me.

563
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:50,432
The policeman's daughter-in-law?

564
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,016
Get lost, you idiot!

565
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:57,349
- I'll tell aunt.
- Get lost! Idiot!

566
00:43:57,641 --> 00:44:01,016
You talk rubbish all the time!

567
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,724
I'll tell aunt.
She'll teach you a lesson.

568
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:15,849
Yes, Jeet. What are you looking for?

569
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:18,682
Who else? My brother is missing.

570
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:21,724
I wonder where he is.
He's not even taking my calls.

571
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:24,349
- He must be sleeping.
- No.

572
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:26,349
He's gone out.

573
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:30,849
But he's been upset since a few days.

574
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:32,724
He doesn't even eat properly.

575
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:35,724
He doesn't talk to anyone.
He stays alone.

576
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,974
- I just don't understand.
- Really?

577
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,807
So it has come this far.

578
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:41,932
What do you mean?

579
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:45,807
What are you talking about?
Tell me clearly. What is it?

580
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,307
Aunt, he's a young man.
He wants to get married.

581
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:52,682
Once his wife comes home,
he'll be absolutely fine.

582
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:54,516
But he doesn't even like any girl.

583
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,849
He's just like his father.

584
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:59,641
Like? He already likes someone.

585
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:01,766
What? Really?

586
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:03,307
Who is she?

587
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,224
She came to our house for the wedding.

588
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,849
- Roop.
- I see.

589
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:11,141
Yes, she's beautiful.
She's unmarried too.

590
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:12,724
She's the one.

591
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,391
And Aunt, she's a relative of mom.

592
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:19,641
That's even better.
I'll talk to Mindo.

593
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:21,974
You sit.

594
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,599
All right, then, it's done.

595
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:30,182
I'll call brother.

596
00:45:31,016 --> 00:45:33,307
What could be better than this?

597
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,474
She doesn't have a father.

598
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:41,016
My brother Jogi has
taken their responsibility.

599
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:45,016
They won't refuse.
She's her only daughter.

600
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:48,516
I'll talk to them. Don't worry.

601
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,516
So, should I take it as a yes?

602
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:58,057
But there's something, sister-in-law.

603
00:45:58,682 --> 00:45:59,682
What?

604
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:07,516
To make a dress for me,
you'll require extra material.

605
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,099
Look at you! You scared me!

606
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,224
In fact, you should get
dresses made for everyone.

607
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:14,641
He's like a son to you too.

608
00:46:14,724 --> 00:46:17,557
I will make for the others,
but you make it for me.

609
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,224
I'll make you two, not one.

610
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:21,682
Be seated. I'll get some sweets.

611
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:22,974
Yes.

612
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:46,349
I've told you everything.

613
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,599
They've asked for this alliance.

614
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:52,682
They have a good name in the village.

615
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,099
I shouldn't force you.

616
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:58,099
The decision rests on you.

617
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,224
This is great news.

618
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,766
Anyway, after Roop's father's demise..

619
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,307
..your wife and you have supported us.

620
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,099
Moreover, you'll always
think in Roop's best interest.

621
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:13,391
This is in Roop's best interest.
My sister lives there.

622
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:17,266
They are in affluent family.
Your daughter will live in luxury.

623
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,057
- Just get me some sweets.
- Sure. Here.

624
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:22,974
- No. Just a little bit..
- Please.

625
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:26,807
- Take the whole thing.
- No.

626
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:28,766
Congratulations.

627
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,766
I don't understand.

628
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:09,516
We have so many farmers and labourers.

629
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,224
Why do you still drive
the tractor on your own?

630
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:14,516
- Luxury cars can't give you..
- Yes.

631
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:17,141
- ..the pleasure that this tractor can.
- Really?

632
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:19,557
Well, I have another doubt.

633
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:22,307
- Your alliance has been fixed.
- Yes.

634
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,599
You'll soon get married.

635
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:27,224
Your ex-girlfriends
will be very upset.

636
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,474
I was just saying..

637
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:37,016
Friends like you make
sure to ruin their friends.

638
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,849
Listen to me,
you diehard fan of Sunny Leone.

639
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,557
I beg of you. It's a request.

640
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,682
Don't get me divorced
before my marriage.

641
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:46,891
I won't let you be ruined.

642
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:51,057
Give me all the numbers.
I'll handle all the other girls.

643
00:49:51,141 --> 00:49:55,599
I'll work hard to make
sure no one gets upset.

644
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:58,724
We have to plough this
land before we go home.

645
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:01,932
If we don't, dad will thrash me.

646
00:50:02,474 --> 00:50:03,224
You know that, don't you?

647
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:05,766
This isn't a big deal.

648
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,557
I used to plough huge
acres of land in a day.

649
00:50:09,766 --> 00:50:11,224
- Really?
- Yes.

650
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:12,391
Which tractor was it?

651
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:16,224
The old tractor we had.

652
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:18,141
You boast so much!

653
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:21,807
At least add some
logic to your statements.

654
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:25,016
It's no use anyway.

655
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:26,474
- Believe it if you want to.
- The rest is up to you.

656
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:30,141
That's up to you.
Well, you boast really well.

657
00:50:30,224 --> 00:50:32,641
- I won't talk to you.
- How are you?

658
00:50:32,724 --> 00:50:34,599
- How's it going?
- How are you?

659
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:36,016
- Come.
- Coming.

660
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,682
- Come.
- Let's go.

661
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:41,391
- You agreed on the tractor, didn't you?
- I did.

662
00:50:41,474 --> 00:50:42,557
Come.

663
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:45,349
- Coming. - So, how are you
back so early from college?

664
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:48,641
I'm back,
but what's going on with you?

665
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:51,724
Aunt said you've found a girl.

666
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:52,766
Not yet.

667
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,391
We haven't spoken since that day.

668
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:56,849
Just the alliance has been fixed.

669
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,224
- Why?
- I can't even follow her now.

670
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:03,307
If I had her number,
I'd have talked to her.

671
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:05,807
- Well, I have something for you.
- What?

672
00:51:06,224 --> 00:51:07,432
I got her number.

673
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,641
- You're lying.
- I swear.

674
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:14,057
That's not a big deal.
You could have asked me.

675
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:15,724
I have numbers of many girls.

676
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:18,016
Hey, I'm talking about Roop.

677
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:20,224
You're the best brother in the world.

678
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:23,432
He's an idiot.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

679
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:25,349
Give me the number.

680
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:28,974
Check your Whatsapp.

681
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,266
Talk here.

682
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:41,016
You'd make me turn on the speaker.

683
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:43,224
How can I talk in front of you two?

684
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:45,596
Nonsense! Idiot!

685
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:48,182
There's a network tower here.

686
00:52:09,105 --> 00:52:09,891
Get lost.

687
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:23,432
Stop it!

688
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,807
Move away!

689
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:25,849
You idiot!

690
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:27,431
- It's ringing.
- Okay.

691
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:36,227
Hello.

692
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:37,766
- Hello.
- Yes, who is it?

693
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,099
- It's me.
- Who?

694
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:43,682
- It's me, Jassi.
- Oh, God!

695
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,557
What happened, dear?

696
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:47,016
Please talk.

697
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,182
Give me.

698
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:54,016
Hello. Who is it?

699
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,557
- It's me.. Okay.
- What?

700
00:53:01,182 --> 00:53:02,099
He hung up.

701
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,599
Her mother is with her.
How will she talk?

702
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:14,311
What's the matter?

703
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,974
What kind of a girl is she!

704
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:17,516
She gave the phone to her mother.

705
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:18,807
What?

706
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:22,974
Her mother answered.

707
00:53:23,057 --> 00:53:25,766
How will she talk? She's petrified.

708
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,807
'Okay, I'm Jassi!'

709
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:35,224
Don't try to threaten her.

710
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:36,724
Of course.

711
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:39,682
Forget him. Give me the phone.

712
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:48,307
You've saved her name as your wife.

713
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:51,224
- All right, then.
- Call her.

714
00:54:03,182 --> 00:54:04,891
Hello. Who is it?

715
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:06,182
Greetings, ma'am.

716
00:54:06,432 --> 00:54:08,932
This is Jeet,
Jasjeet's younger brother.

717
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:12,641
Greetings, dear. Bless you.

718
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:15,807
Yes, what's the matter?
Why did you call?

719
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:20,224
Well, can I please talk to Roop?
Actually, brother wants to talk.

720
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:23,224
Okay. So, why didn't he call?

721
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:26,599
Well, brother feels shy.
Can he talk to her?

722
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,224
Okay.

723
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:30,974
Talk to him, dear.

724
00:54:31,391 --> 00:54:33,057
No, Mom, I don't want to.

725
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:39,224
Dear, just as your brother feels shy..

726
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:41,224
..she feels shy too.

727
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:45,766
Really? Okay, then. Goodbye.

728
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,349
Okay, dear. Bless you.

729
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,557
Silly.

730
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:56,057
- What did she say?
- What else?

731
00:54:56,432 --> 00:54:57,891
She's just like you.

732
00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:01,557
- He's useless.
- You rascal!

733
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,682
Oh, no..

734
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,724
Mom, are you asleep?

735
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:25,516
No, dear, I'm walking in the fields.

736
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:28,349
Just go to sleep.

737
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:55,084
"I was with my beloved at night."

738
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,793
"We got so late..

739
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:02,709
..I didn't realize it."

740
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,126
So, are you going to meet her?

741
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:07,084
I've somehow managed to convince her.

742
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:08,668
She was very nervous.

743
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:11,543
As if I'm going to kill her.

744
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,082
Look at your personality.
She's bound to be scared.

745
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:17,543
Okay, stop it.
I'll see you in the evening.

746
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,209
- Do your work.
- Drop me too.

747
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:22,376
Excuse me. Where?

748
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:23,668
Don't try to tag along.

749
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:25,376
I'll see you in the evening. Get out.

750
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:26,959
- Fine, Brother.
- Go.

751
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,293
You've forgotten your brother.

752
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:30,584
- Never mind.
- Okay, then.

753
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:42,834
We won't be spared. Come on.

754
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,418
We're done for.

755
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:47,626
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

756
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:57,959
Where are you headed?

757
00:57:58,501 --> 00:57:59,334
That..

758
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:01,709
You won't be able to drive
the tractor all decked up.

759
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:02,876
Tractor?

760
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,584
To spread the fertilisers.

761
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:05,918
I told you yesterday.

762
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:08,418
Fertilisers need to
be spread on the potatoes.

763
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:09,876
Let's go.

764
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:12,168
We have so many labourers, uncle.

765
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:14,963
They'll do it.
Why does brother have to go?

766
00:58:15,043 --> 00:58:15,959
- Right, Brother?
- Yes.

767
00:58:16,043 --> 00:58:19,084
We may have a hundred labourers, dear.

768
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:23,126
But they won't be able
to do it the way you do.

769
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,584
Hurry up now, and take him along.

770
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:30,467
But Dad, I was going to college.

771
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:31,918
College?

772
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:35,126
It's been years since
you completed your education.

773
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,876
What are you going there for?

774
00:58:37,116 --> 00:58:40,187
- Well, it's his convocation day.
- Yes.

775
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,376
He'll get his degree.

776
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:46,584
Yes, Dad. We'll wear black
coats and take our degrees.

777
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:49,834
Oh, that!
You're supposed to fling your hats!

778
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:51,126
Yes.

779
00:58:51,668 --> 00:58:54,459
Sir, please let me go with him.

780
00:58:54,543 --> 00:58:58,543
I'll click his pictures
when he flings his hat.

781
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:01,126
What's the point of the
event when there are no pictures?

782
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,918
- Just let me go with him.
- Shut up.

783
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:06,691
What will you do in college?

784
00:59:06,771 --> 00:59:08,168
You have nothing to do there.

785
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:11,959
Please tell him to take me.
I might find someone there.

786
00:59:12,043 --> 00:59:14,501
What will I do with those pictures?

787
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,584
- Save me.
- Tell me.

788
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:19,213
Who's going to spread the fertilisers?

789
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:22,575
Uncle, why do you worry?
Laddu and I are here.

790
00:59:22,655 --> 00:59:23,793
Right, Laddu?

791
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:26,751
Will Laddu and you do it?

792
00:59:27,293 --> 00:59:29,543
You're wearing pants too.

793
00:59:29,872 --> 00:59:31,043
How will you do it?

794
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:34,921
- I'll change and be back.
- Okay, then.

795
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:36,751
Take Laddu along.

796
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:38,584
- Jassi!
- Yes, Dad.

797
00:59:38,668 --> 00:59:40,834
- Come home soon.
- Okay, Dad.

798
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:50,001
- Go on!
- Stop it!

799
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:52,293
I'll see you in the evening.

800
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:56,043
You come with me.
I'll quench your thirst.

801
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,084
- Come on.
- Let's go.

802
00:59:57,164 --> 00:59:58,369
Get going.

803
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:00,543
I'm sorry, I'm late.

804
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:03,046
Dad stopped me.

805
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:04,459
It was very difficult for me to come.

806
01:00:05,626 --> 01:00:07,418
- Did you come by bus?
- What?

807
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:10,185
No, by car.

808
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,638
Why?

809
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:15,334
No. You said it was
difficult for you to come.

810
01:00:15,418 --> 01:00:17,584
I thought, maybe you
didn't get a seat in the bus.

811
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:21,955
My pass doesn't work here, so..

812
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:27,251
Is everything okay at home?

813
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:29,336
Yes, everyone is fine.

814
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:32,713
Mom is fine. Namo is fine too.

815
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:37,293
Lachi was a bit weak,
but she's okay now.

816
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:42,809
Are Namo and Lachi your friends?

817
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:49,762
No, Namo is our cow,
and Lachi is its calf.

818
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:50,918
Oh!

819
01:00:51,001 --> 01:00:52,054
What would you like, sir?

820
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,555
- I'll have a cappuccino.
- Okay, sir.

821
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:02,312
What about you?

822
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:05,478
I'll have a vodka.

823
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:11,084
No, two vodkas.

824
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,819
I-I'll be right back.

825
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,918
Ma'am, don't be angry..

826
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:34,111
..but you don't look
like you drink vodka.

827
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:36,584
I drink it every day.

828
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:38,429
The children in my house drink it.

829
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:41,334
My mom gives me one
right after I wake up.

830
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:42,715
Jeet.

831
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:46,721
I'm done for.

832
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,958
Roop is an alcoholic.

833
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,401
Ma'am, do you even know what vodka is?

834
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,430
Yes, it's a form of coffee.

835
01:02:00,543 --> 01:02:02,079
The rich drink it.

836
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,767
No, ma'am. Vodka is alcohol.

837
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:08,251
- What?
- Yes.

838
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,242
Oh, God!

839
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:13,882
That witch! She'll rot in hell.

840
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:15,991
I won't spare her.

841
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:20,907
What will he think of me?

842
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,176
What do I do now?

843
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:29,726
Couldn't you have told me this before?

844
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:32,981
Oh, God!

845
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:35,606
I'll talk to you later.

846
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:52,209
- Did you say something?
- No. I didn't say anything.

847
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:56,023
- Get two cups of coffee.
- Okay.

848
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:02,293
Is coffee okay for you?

849
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:07,923
Well, I didn't know what to order.

850
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:13,572
So, my friend said
I should order vodka.

851
01:03:14,193 --> 01:03:16,990
I didn't know vodka was alcohol.

852
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:56,602
- Sir, your bill.
- Give it.

853
01:03:57,088 --> 01:03:58,270
How much is the bill?

854
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:01,142
Why? Will you pay?

855
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:04,749
No, but we'll split.

856
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:07,795
Excuse me. We're going to get married.

857
01:04:08,501 --> 01:04:10,420
But we aren't married yet.

858
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:13,803
- How much is the bill?
- Rs. 430.

859
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:24,530
This is all I have.

860
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:27,932
I'll pay you the rest tomorrow.

861
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,328
Why? Are we meeting again tomorrow?

862
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:47,886
"The lake is full.."

863
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,661
Who the heck are you!

864
01:04:51,296 --> 01:04:54,783
- Move it away.
- Hold on a minute.

865
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,964
Why the heck are you in such a hurry?

866
01:04:57,388 --> 01:05:00,626
- Mind your language.
- You seem egoistic.

867
01:05:00,709 --> 01:05:06,291
If I slap you hard,
you'll come to your senses.

868
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:10,113
I know you.

869
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:13,726
But I'm no less.

870
01:05:13,806 --> 01:05:17,207
- You!
- Hey, you!

871
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:20,459
You're trying to act too smart,
aren't you?

872
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,876
You don't know me!

873
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:25,084
Hey, you!

874
01:05:25,164 --> 01:05:28,584
- Get lost!
- I am saying you, don't touch me!

875
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:31,550
- Get lost!
- I'll show you!

876
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,400
- Hey, you!
- Listen to me!

877
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,949
- Nonsense!
- Hey, listen to me!

878
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:40,987
People like you..

879
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:45,904
..are under my shoe.

880
01:05:46,832 --> 01:05:49,217
Sir..

881
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:56,293
"Your friend speaks up.."

882
01:05:56,376 --> 01:06:01,334
Tell your mother to birth a son who's
strong enough to stand in my way.

883
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:06,024
"Your friend speaks up."

884
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:11,988
"Your friend speaks up."

885
01:06:22,418 --> 01:06:24,959
- Greetings.
- Greetings, sir.

886
01:06:25,043 --> 01:06:26,479
What brings you here
early in the morning?

887
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,272
You should have called me.
I'd have come.

888
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,184
It's okay, sir.

889
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:32,839
We didn't want to bother you.

890
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:34,273
So, we came on our own.

891
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:35,518
Tell me, what's the matter?

892
01:06:35,598 --> 01:06:40,510
Sir, my servant Heera was bringing
some stuff on his cart at night.

893
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,586
His cart was stuck on the road.

894
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:45,793
And a responsible resident
of our village misbehaved with him.

895
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:49,819
Sir, he was only
trying to move his cart.

896
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:53,402
- Since it was heavy, he couldn't do it.
- Right.

897
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:55,005
He was helpless.

898
01:06:55,085 --> 01:07:00,918
For this reason, that drunkard
abused him and slapped him.

899
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:03,888
He took this incident to heart.
He wants to die.

900
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:07,589
We stopped him.
You have to take a call on this.

901
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:11,129
You don't even tolerate
someone abusing, sir.

902
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:13,250
But he abused him physically.

903
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,926
Tell me, what's to be done?

904
01:07:15,006 --> 01:07:17,126
The law is the same for everyone.

905
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:21,048
I will not let injustice
happen with anyone.

906
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:24,183
Tell me, who is it? We'll call him.

907
01:07:24,598 --> 01:07:27,800
Ask him if he's strong
enough to hear his name.

908
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,295
Listen.

909
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:38,787
Tell your younger brother
to stay in his limits.

910
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:41,366
No, all he was saying is..

911
01:07:41,446 --> 01:07:44,117
..he might change his decision
after knowing the culprit.

912
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:45,993
He might break the rules and laws.

913
01:07:46,073 --> 01:07:52,626
You know that our family
has never gone back on its word.

914
01:07:52,709 --> 01:07:57,368
We never change our
rules and laws for anyone.

915
01:07:57,664 --> 01:08:01,834
So, listen, sir,
the culprit is your younger brother.

916
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:03,294
Shamsher Singh.

917
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:12,126
We'll call him and
ask him to apologise.

918
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:15,646
Sir, he will have to
apologise in the council.

919
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,550
Not at home.

920
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:22,012
- Moreover, this is the council's matter
now. - Yes, he is right.

921
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,635
I never change my laws for anyone.

922
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:29,811
Even if the culprit is my brother.

923
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:35,950
The law was the same
for your brother and mine.

924
01:08:40,918 --> 01:08:43,891
I don't understand why
you refuse to believe me.

925
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:45,293
It wasn't my fault.

926
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:47,671
I was on my way, like always.

927
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:50,334
It's a government road.
He was in my way.

928
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:54,495
I asked him politely to move.
But he answered me back.

929
01:08:55,751 --> 01:08:58,165
And I can't tolerate
anyone answering me back.

930
01:08:58,245 --> 01:08:59,804
- Who the heck is he?
- I see.

931
01:08:59,884 --> 01:09:02,761
Are you trying to say he's not human?

932
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:06,857
This is our village,
and everyone is equal here.

933
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:11,833
Whether rich or poor.
Everyone is equal.

934
01:09:12,342 --> 01:09:15,492
You tell me, sir. What should be done?

935
01:09:18,662 --> 01:09:23,338
You all know that the village
head does not even approve of..

936
01:09:23,418 --> 01:09:25,834
..anyone abusing.

937
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:30,478
But he abused and slapped.

938
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:36,514
Let's see what the village
head has to say now.

939
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:48,773
Heera, you tell me.

940
01:09:49,276 --> 01:09:50,500
What do you want?

941
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:52,181
What else?

942
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:55,014
Heera wants an apology from him..

943
01:09:55,648 --> 01:09:57,615
..so that he gets
his lost honour back.

944
01:09:57,695 --> 01:09:59,084
Don't worry, Heera.

945
01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:01,678
Justice will be delivered.

946
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:03,842
Tell me, what you want.

947
01:10:03,922 --> 01:10:06,255
I didn't want to come to the council.

948
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:08,742
But I came because
the elders insisted.

949
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:11,651
Or else, the decision
would have been made by now.

950
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:14,491
Heera, you tell me.

951
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,909
What do you want?

952
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:18,897
Apology.

953
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,418
I won't apologise.

954
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:24,209
He made a mistake, and he got slapped.

955
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:26,182
If he speaks ill again,
I'll slap him again.

956
01:10:27,987 --> 01:10:30,302
You'll have to apologise, Shera.

957
01:10:30,918 --> 01:10:31,879
Yes.

958
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:35,366
Accepting your mistake is a big thing.

959
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:39,008
And the one who apologises
becomes the bigger person.

960
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,694
So..

961
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,436
Apologise to Heera.

962
01:10:56,427 --> 01:10:57,781
I'm sorry.

963
01:10:58,928 --> 01:11:01,071
What did he say? I didn't hear.

964
01:11:03,837 --> 01:11:04,683
What did you say?

965
01:11:05,296 --> 01:11:09,587
Apologise loudly, with a clear heart.

966
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,617
Tell him, sir.

967
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:17,085
Forgive me.

968
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:35,227
Are you happy now, Heera?

969
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:39,243
I told you that the village
head never violates the law..

970
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,857
..even when the culprit
is his own brother.

971
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:44,478
Let's go now. Get back to work.

972
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,936
It was my fault?

973
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,834
He thinks it was my fault?

974
01:11:58,515 --> 01:12:01,986
He asked me to apologise
in front of everyone.

975
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:09,562
It was never my fault.

976
01:12:12,377 --> 01:12:15,043
He had to show off, after all.

977
01:12:15,406 --> 01:12:17,832
I know my brother.

978
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:19,793
Don't try to act too smart.

979
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:21,043
Shut up.

980
01:12:21,126 --> 01:12:23,696
Since I've come to this
house I have been quiet.

981
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:26,052
But how will you shut the people up?

982
01:12:26,132 --> 01:12:27,676
How many people will you shut up?

983
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:29,010
Didn't you hear what I said?

984
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:31,294
Shut up and mind your own business.

985
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:33,758
I am minding my own business.

986
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,529
But you never did
what you should have.

987
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:40,420
We've been serving
your brother all our lives.

988
01:12:41,043 --> 01:12:43,879
He showed his true colours after all.

989
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,779
He boasted about loving his brother.

990
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:49,438
If he loved his brother,
why did he make you apologise?

991
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:53,563
He was the council head.
He could do what he wanted.

992
01:12:55,468 --> 01:13:00,387
Listen, I've told you umpteen
times not to talk nonsense to me.

993
01:13:00,736 --> 01:13:04,084
Even a member of the
council would save his family.

994
01:13:04,168 --> 01:13:05,333
And he's the village head.

995
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:09,728
Couldn't he have pardoned
the mistake of his younger brother?

996
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:12,074
Humans make mistakes, but no.

997
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,648
He embarrassed you
in front of the council.

998
01:13:23,908 --> 01:13:26,335
He could have taken a call at home.

999
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:28,296
We wouldn't have lost
face in front of the others.

1000
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:29,463
But no!

1001
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:31,718
He's the village head, after all.

1002
01:13:32,017 --> 01:13:34,449
Trying to be an honest man!

1003
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:36,084
What are you thinking now?

1004
01:13:38,242 --> 01:13:39,443
Where's Jeet?

1005
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,092
Must be serving them.

1006
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:46,754
You serve your brother,
and he serves his son.

1007
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:57,235
Laddu, the day you marry,
everyone will be stunned.

1008
01:13:57,315 --> 01:13:59,653
I don't think he's capable of that.

1009
01:13:59,733 --> 01:14:03,062
- Relax, boy.
- Throw a card.

1010
01:14:03,142 --> 01:14:06,567
- Go on.
- Come on.

1011
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:10,691
Laddu, you will lose.
Try all you want.

1012
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:13,861
You're going to get married.
What's he going to do?

1013
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:15,709
Let him keep the queen.

1014
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,501
Come on!

1015
01:14:17,584 --> 01:14:20,306
I won't get the queen in real life.
Let me keep this one at least.

1016
01:14:20,386 --> 01:14:21,673
Make your move.

1017
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,947
- Here you go.
- At least make a move.

1018
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,176
Come on.

1019
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:26,918
- Uncle is here.
- He's here.

1020
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:27,918
- Come.
- Come.

1021
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:29,187
Distribute for him too.

1022
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:32,375
Do we educate you
so you can gamble here?

1023
01:14:32,455 --> 01:14:33,709
What's the matter?

1024
01:14:33,998 --> 01:14:34,834
What do you care?

1025
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:39,046
No matter what happens,
all you want to do is have fun.

1026
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:41,129
Don't be angry, uncle.
He came with me.

1027
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:42,751
- Yes. I brought him.
- Shut up!

1028
01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:45,331
I know you pretty well.

1029
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:49,478
If I see you playing cards again,
you'll see the worst of me.

1030
01:14:49,558 --> 01:14:51,175
Until you tell me what's wrong..

1031
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:53,126
- ..I will sit right here.
- Don't speak.

1032
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:54,703
- Tell me, what's my fault?
- Quiet.

1033
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,063
- You want to know your fault?
- No..

1034
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:58,564
- You want to know your fault?
- Uncle..

1035
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:06,403
You slapped brother, Dad?

1036
01:15:06,813 --> 01:15:08,980
It's okay, never mind.

1037
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,407
He's my uncle.

1038
01:15:10,942 --> 01:15:12,674
He's raised us.

1039
01:15:12,981 --> 01:15:14,838
Go, take uncle home.

1040
01:15:14,918 --> 01:15:16,420
But how could he slap?

1041
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,625
He's drunk. Never mind. Go.

1042
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:22,128
Let's go.

1043
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:24,267
I won't spare you.

1044
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,263
Let's go.

1045
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:32,628
I.. Well..

1046
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:38,166
Sito, you're trying to say something,
but you aren't.

1047
01:15:38,246 --> 01:15:39,291
Tell me what the matter is.

1048
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:44,946
I was wondering whether
or not to tell you what I saw.

1049
01:15:45,026 --> 01:15:48,632
Look, this is your family matter.
You should sort it out.

1050
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,626
Our family matter?
We should sort it out?

1051
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:52,909
Be clear. What are you trying to say?

1052
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:54,524
Where do I start?

1053
01:15:54,839 --> 01:15:57,765
Your brother-in-law
slapped your son publically.

1054
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,609
He was angry about what
happened at the council.

1055
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,670
He couldn't blame
his elder brother for it.

1056
01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:06,241
So, he vented his anger
on the younger ones.

1057
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:10,734
Sherry slapped my son? Publically?

1058
01:16:10,814 --> 01:16:14,918
Yes, your son was sulking.
His face turned red.

1059
01:16:15,566 --> 01:16:18,056
Okay, then,
Kanta and Banta must be waiting.

1060
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:20,476
They must be hungry. I'll make a move.

1061
01:16:20,556 --> 01:16:22,934
Okay, bye.

1062
01:16:41,574 --> 01:16:42,810
What's the matter?

1063
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:44,367
You look angry.

1064
01:16:44,628 --> 01:16:46,682
You didn't even greet me.

1065
01:16:46,762 --> 01:16:48,545
I'm bound to be angry.

1066
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:50,793
When your brother made a mistake..

1067
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,051
..you made him apologise
in front of the council.

1068
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:58,633
But that doesn't mean
he can slap my son publically.

1069
01:16:58,713 --> 01:17:02,468
So what? He's his uncle.
He has the authority.

1070
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:06,273
Listen, my son matters to me the most.

1071
01:17:06,532 --> 01:17:08,608
What if he had retaliated?

1072
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,543
Or what if he had harmed himself?

1073
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:13,366
What would we have done?

1074
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:17,045
You have to talk to your brother.

1075
01:17:17,789 --> 01:17:19,090
Or else..

1076
01:17:36,493 --> 01:17:39,962
I can't seem to forget that scene.

1077
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,737
How could he humiliate..

1078
01:17:42,817 --> 01:17:45,834
..his younger brother
in front of the village!

1079
01:17:46,592 --> 01:17:49,327
He thinks he's the most
honest person on earth.

1080
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:54,690
Are you listening? Turn around.

1081
01:18:00,077 --> 01:18:02,065
It pierced you today..

1082
01:18:03,305 --> 01:18:06,527
..but I've been living
with it all my life.

1083
01:18:06,918 --> 01:18:08,767
I never said anything.

1084
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:14,615
I was suffering all these years
as I respect your elder brother.

1085
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,114
But think about it.

1086
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,607
What do we have?

1087
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:23,347
They have everything.

1088
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:30,128
A big tractor, cars, jeeps,
all the wealth is possessed by them.

1089
01:18:31,014 --> 01:18:37,030
We only get what's left, to spend.

1090
01:18:39,372 --> 01:18:44,889
You're sleeping soundly.
I've lost my slumber.

1091
01:18:45,738 --> 01:18:49,692
Listen, it's late at night.
Just go to sleep.

1092
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:54,680
Stop blabbering.
I have to go to work in the morning.

1093
01:18:55,348 --> 01:18:57,648
Gogi and his family is better than us.

1094
01:18:58,286 --> 01:19:01,014
At least they don't
have to beg before anyone.

1095
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:05,374
Until we beg, we don't get anything.

1096
01:19:08,789 --> 01:19:12,614
We don't even have an honourable life.

1097
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,983
'We have nothing left.'

1098
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:03,320
'How could he humiliate..'

1099
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,400
'..his younger brother
in front of the village!'

1100
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,008
'Gogi and his family
is better than us.'

1101
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,694
'At least they don't
have to beg before anyone.'

1102
01:20:13,983 --> 01:20:16,068
'How could he humiliate..

1103
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:21,212
'Gogi and his family
is better than us.'

1104
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:22,567
'How could he humiliate..

1105
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,612
..his younger brother
in front of the village!'

1106
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:27,478
'At least they don't
have to beg before anyone.'

1107
01:20:41,255 --> 01:20:44,601
What's this, Dad?
You were angry yesterday.

1108
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:46,977
And you've started drinking
early in the morning today.

1109
01:20:47,744 --> 01:20:49,774
If something's bothering you,
at least tell me.

1110
01:20:50,074 --> 01:20:51,962
What's bothering me? Nothing at all.

1111
01:20:52,675 --> 01:20:55,969
I'm not angry.
What would I be angry about?

1112
01:20:57,576 --> 01:20:59,437
If there was something,
I'd have told you.

1113
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:02,497
It's nothing.

1114
01:21:03,518 --> 01:21:06,534
I have to go to the farm.

1115
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:09,736
Take my lunch from your mom
and bring it later on.

1116
01:21:19,776 --> 01:21:21,911
You're all set to go
and serve them again.

1117
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:35,075
You'll continue to work, and
they'll continue to take advantage.

1118
01:21:35,444 --> 01:21:38,570
They'll make you and
us serve them forever.

1119
01:21:38,874 --> 01:21:41,716
This is what they want.

1120
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:46,240
What should I say?

1121
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:08,650
- Gogi.
- Yes.

1122
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,829
Water the fields properly.

1123
01:22:12,581 --> 01:22:14,778
Okay, I'll do it.

1124
01:22:14,858 --> 01:22:17,855
No need, you idiot. Get lost.

1125
01:22:22,835 --> 01:22:24,448
I'll leave.

1126
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:29,870
Don't do it.
There's no need to water the fields.

1127
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,862
Let me work.
This isn't the time to joke.

1128
01:22:32,942 --> 01:22:36,320
Am I joke?
You're the one who joked, Brother.

1129
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,806
What do you mean?

1130
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,498
You could have suppressed
the matter if you wanted.

1131
01:22:40,578 --> 01:22:44,195
You made a mistake,
that's why you apologised.

1132
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:47,403
If you make mistakes,
you have to pay for them.

1133
01:22:47,483 --> 01:22:51,067
I've been screaming since
yesterday and telling you..

1134
01:22:51,147 --> 01:22:52,817
..it was not my fault.

1135
01:22:52,897 --> 01:22:57,588
But you never listened.
You're too arrogant.

1136
01:22:57,668 --> 01:22:59,081
What are you trying to say?

1137
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:01,487
There's nothing left to say.

1138
01:23:01,567 --> 01:23:03,275
If you weren't my elder brother..

1139
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:07,884
..I would have taught you a lesson.

1140
01:23:07,964 --> 01:23:12,918
Mind your tongue,
Brother, or I'll have to punish you.

1141
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:17,520
You'll punish me? Will you!

1142
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:48,052
Go, let me know. Go on.

1143
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:56,067
Leave me.

1144
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:57,980
Leave me.

1145
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,503
Uncle!

1146
01:24:01,514 --> 01:24:02,971
Uncle!

1147
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,016
Dad! Stop!

1148
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:13,772
- You don't know me!
- Hey! There's been a disaster!

1149
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:16,998
Your brother-in-law is hitting
your husband in the fields.

1150
01:24:17,078 --> 01:24:20,998
My son called me and told me
the father and son are attacking him!

1151
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:22,420
- Dear Lord!
- Yes!

1152
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,298
See, I told you! Come on!

1153
01:24:24,378 --> 01:24:27,293
- Take me!
- I'll handle it, Mom. You stay here!

1154
01:24:27,373 --> 01:24:30,359
- What's happening with us!
- I know!

1155
01:24:30,439 --> 01:24:35,151
What are we going to do now!
Go and see what's happening!

1156
01:24:48,975 --> 01:24:51,008
Yes, Brother, they've left.

1157
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,778
As far as the house is concerned..

1158
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:28,291
..I've made two separate
ones for the two of you.

1159
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:34,316
You two have separate tractors
and farm machinery as well.

1160
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,486
But I did not divide the mansion.

1161
01:25:38,306 --> 01:25:42,727
If I had,
then there wouldn't be any unity.

1162
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:49,384
But if the situations are
such that a division is necessary..

1163
01:25:50,672 --> 01:25:52,592
..then we have the
village head right here.

1164
01:25:53,099 --> 01:25:55,704
Let there be a council meeting,
and divide it.

1165
01:25:56,546 --> 01:26:00,013
We don't abide by the village head.

1166
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:03,370
Just let me know who's
going to give me food.

1167
01:26:03,707 --> 01:26:04,766
Or else..

1168
01:26:05,129 --> 01:26:06,816
We will serve you food.

1169
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:08,317
We are capable enough.

1170
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,567
I know how capable you are.
I know you.

1171
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,530
I know you pretty well too.

1172
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:19,475
Listen, make sure there
are witnesses during the division.

1173
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:23,070
The village head isn't trustworthy.
He might not do it equally.

1174
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:28,022
When the women start to speak,
the men have nothing to do.

1175
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:32,037
Let me know your decision.

1176
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,381
Perhaps, God made me build
the old age home for this day.

1177
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,954
Maybe I will go there myself.

1178
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:09,778
Here. Tell me how it tastes.

1179
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:12,030
I'll finish it off today.

1180
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:15,158
Why have you brought three?

1181
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:19,491
Well, I thought the three
of us will sit together.

1182
01:27:22,335 --> 01:27:23,705
I'm not a child.

1183
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:25,716
Why are you so upset?

1184
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,312
Don't pretend, Laddu.

1185
01:27:27,707 --> 01:27:29,608
What if this had happened
with Uncle Gogi?

1186
01:27:31,009 --> 01:27:32,624
You think this could ever happen?

1187
01:27:33,266 --> 01:27:35,749
And Jassi loves you
and your dad a lot.

1188
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:39,092
- Don't try to defend him.
- He's not defending me.

1189
01:27:39,701 --> 01:27:41,226
He's telling the truth.

1190
01:27:42,613 --> 01:27:44,125
Try and understand, dear.

1191
01:27:44,397 --> 01:27:48,787
Yes, everyone's right here.
I'm the one who's wrong.

1192
01:27:48,867 --> 01:27:50,443
Or my father.

1193
01:28:20,933 --> 01:28:24,112
Listen, don't take him seriously.

1194
01:28:24,423 --> 01:28:27,512
You know he can't live without you.

1195
01:28:28,206 --> 01:28:30,405
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

1196
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:39,921
I don't know..

1197
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:42,729
..if everything will be fine now.

1198
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:46,148
Everything's messed up.

1199
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,920
- Never mind. Let's go.
- Let's sit for some time.

1200
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:56,863
Roop, I'm going to the market, okay?

1201
01:30:13,936 --> 01:30:19,257
'The number you have
called is unavailable.'

1202
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:41,010
- Hi, Roop. Greetings.
- What's wrong with you?

1203
01:30:41,328 --> 01:30:44,155
- Nothing.
- Then why do you sound low?

1204
01:30:44,506 --> 01:30:46,099
Did someone say something to you?

1205
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:47,768
No, no one said anything to me.

1206
01:30:48,203 --> 01:30:51,427
Yes, no one can dare say anything
to you when your brother is there.

1207
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:55,079
Listen, did your brother scold you?

1208
01:30:57,006 --> 01:30:58,134
Tell me.

1209
01:30:59,393 --> 01:31:03,146
Okay, consider me your
sister and share it with me.

1210
01:31:03,226 --> 01:31:04,621
You're like a brother to me,
aren't you?

1211
01:31:04,932 --> 01:31:07,365
I'll set your brother straight.

1212
01:31:07,897 --> 01:31:10,766
It's nothing, Roop. You tell me.

1213
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:12,470
Why did you call? Is it important?

1214
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:17,192
Yes, I tried calling your brother.
He didn't answer.

1215
01:31:17,272 --> 01:31:20,519
I thought you must be with him.
So I called you.

1216
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:22,311
Roop, I'll call you later.

1217
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:27,596
Mom is calling me. We'll talk later.

1218
01:31:27,933 --> 01:31:29,283
Okay, bye.

1219
01:31:31,683 --> 01:31:32,643
He hung up.

1220
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,778
I know everything, Laddu.

1221
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,308
What should I tell Roop
about why I'm not talking to her?

1222
01:31:41,974 --> 01:31:43,415
I'm not in the mood to..

1223
01:31:45,558 --> 01:31:47,106
I'll call you back.

1224
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:01,370
Dad, stop over-thinking.

1225
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:05,058
The land has been divided,
our hearts haven't.

1226
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:07,021
You're worrying for no reason.

1227
01:32:10,849 --> 01:32:12,905
Dad, I'm going to be like you too.

1228
01:32:13,262 --> 01:32:17,308
Whenever there is an issue
at the council, I'll go with you.

1229
01:32:17,391 --> 01:32:19,884
We'll resolve issues together.

1230
01:32:20,559 --> 01:32:23,802
And later on,
I can become a member of the council.

1231
01:32:35,728 --> 01:32:39,830
Jassi, come early to
the farm tomorrow morning.

1232
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:42,781
Your uncle won't be coming.

1233
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:20,750
Watch out.

1234
01:33:23,249 --> 01:33:25,558
Greetings, young Sardar!

1235
01:33:25,952 --> 01:33:27,405
Why do you say that?

1236
01:33:28,018 --> 01:33:30,487
He owns a separate land now.
He's the sole owner.

1237
01:33:31,016 --> 01:33:32,614
Call him sir!

1238
01:33:33,356 --> 01:33:36,563
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sit down.

1239
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:39,862
I'm glad you apologised.

1240
01:33:39,942 --> 01:33:42,354
Apologising makes
you the bigger person.

1241
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:44,892
Move out of his way.

1242
01:33:48,327 --> 01:33:50,268
Please go.

1243
01:33:53,823 --> 01:33:57,599
- So, was that fun?
- Absolutely!

1244
01:33:57,683 --> 01:33:59,634
I'm very happy!

1245
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:06,063
I'm not happy yet. I'll be
happy when their sons split too.

1246
01:34:06,143 --> 01:34:08,475
They are still connected somehow.

1247
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:10,353
Never mind, let's go.

1248
01:34:15,158 --> 01:34:20,706
Friends, as you all know,
there's going to be..

1249
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:23,197
..a tractor race once again.

1250
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:27,728
From all the surrounding villages..

1251
01:34:27,808 --> 01:34:32,144
..young men have reached
the ground with their tractors.

1252
01:34:32,224 --> 01:34:35,266
And the former champions
of this race..

1253
01:34:35,349 --> 01:34:40,474
..Jassi and Jeet and ready
with their tractors too.

1254
01:34:40,554 --> 01:34:44,891
So, let's watch if
this Jaddi Sardar pair..

1255
01:34:44,974 --> 01:34:49,486
..can repeat history or not.

1256
01:34:50,182 --> 01:34:53,641
Let the competition begin.

1257
01:34:53,724 --> 01:34:56,512
The race has begun.

1258
01:35:33,232 --> 01:35:37,599
So, friends,
victory doesn't remain with one.

1259
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,974
I have witness history changing..

1260
01:35:40,058 --> 01:35:42,646
..and it has changed yet again.

1261
01:35:42,726 --> 01:35:45,683
The young men who have won the race..

1262
01:35:45,766 --> 01:35:47,891
..have recreated history.

1263
01:35:47,974 --> 01:35:50,804
Their names are Kant and Bant.

1264
01:35:53,024 --> 01:35:58,774
I request the chief guests
to honour the winners.

1265
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,039
A huge round of applause, boys!

1266
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,022
Well done!

1267
01:36:05,102 --> 01:36:06,963
Wonderful!

1268
01:36:08,431 --> 01:36:11,259
We witnessed a pair winning before.

1269
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:13,547
We witnessed another
pair winning this time.

1270
01:36:13,921 --> 01:36:15,820
No one can survive alone.

1271
01:36:16,308 --> 01:36:18,866
They are two brothers in one soul.

1272
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:26,582
Greetings!

1273
01:36:28,508 --> 01:36:29,520
Yes, tell me?

1274
01:36:30,183 --> 01:36:34,189
It's been long. I thought
we should fix the wedding date.

1275
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:35,533
What wedding?

1276
01:36:38,706 --> 01:36:40,312
Why are you joking?

1277
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:42,641
Jasjeet and Roop's wedding.

1278
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:49,939
Stay right here.

1279
01:36:50,182 --> 01:36:51,138
Okay.

1280
01:36:53,086 --> 01:36:54,591
She must have gone to get oil.

1281
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:58,004
She'll drop the oil first
and welcome us. It's auspicious.

1282
01:37:01,276 --> 01:37:05,533
Here are your gifts.
We have nothing to do with you.

1283
01:37:06,578 --> 01:37:07,591
What's this?

1284
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:11,483
If something's wrong,
we can sort it out.

1285
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:13,341
I don't want to talk to you.

1286
01:37:13,425 --> 01:37:17,342
Your sister lives next door.
Go and talk to her.

1287
01:37:17,422 --> 01:37:18,575
Understand?

1288
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:21,567
But..

1289
01:37:45,521 --> 01:37:46,870
Oh, yes.

1290
01:37:47,181 --> 01:37:49,795
Yes. I saw it. Yes.

1291
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:53,133
Brother? I'll call you later.

1292
01:37:53,216 --> 01:37:55,879
Greetings!
I'm so happy, my brother is here!

1293
01:37:55,959 --> 01:38:01,023
Hey, bring water. Not water,
bring buttermilk for my brother.

1294
01:38:01,103 --> 01:38:03,470
I will drink buttermilk
and eat food too.

1295
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:07,042
First tell me, if there was
a tiff between the brothers..

1296
01:38:07,122 --> 01:38:09,422
..was it not your duty to inform me!

1297
01:38:09,716 --> 01:38:11,754
They threw the gifts on my face!

1298
01:38:12,466 --> 01:38:14,967
They've broken all ties with us.

1299
01:38:15,175 --> 01:38:17,883
We don't visit them,
and they don't visit us.

1300
01:38:17,966 --> 01:38:21,635
Your ties are broken,
and I'm being punished for it.

1301
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:23,894
What will I tell that family?

1302
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:26,249
Especially that kind lady..

1303
01:38:26,329 --> 01:38:29,633
..whose daughter I promised
to marry off on your word.

1304
01:38:29,716 --> 01:38:33,335
What would I tell you, Brother?
There was nothing left to say.

1305
01:38:33,415 --> 01:38:35,091
They broke all ties with us.

1306
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:37,766
Listen, Sister, I don't care.

1307
01:38:37,846 --> 01:38:41,452
If the alliance is called off,
people will blame the girl.

1308
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:45,216
I need an answer, a solid one.

1309
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:48,261
What am I supposed to do?
It's their fault.

1310
01:38:48,341 --> 01:38:49,550
Don't do anything.

1311
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:55,230
All you do now is forget
you have a brother.

1312
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:58,069
Why do you say that, Brother?

1313
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,508
Come in and have buttermilk.

1314
01:39:00,588 --> 01:39:03,323
- I need an answer first.
- I will tell you.

1315
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:06,675
- Come in first and have buttermilk.
- The answer first.

1316
01:39:06,758 --> 01:39:09,418
- Come in first and have buttermilk.
- The answer.

1317
01:39:10,664 --> 01:39:13,700
Okay, then. I'll do something.

1318
01:39:34,295 --> 01:39:36,925
Listen, give him the buttermilk.

1319
01:39:39,992 --> 01:39:40,930
Brother.

1320
01:39:41,383 --> 01:39:42,442
I want the answer first.

1321
01:39:42,675 --> 01:39:44,894
Come in and have buttermilk first.

1322
01:39:44,974 --> 01:39:47,374
- The answer.
- Okay, then, listen.

1323
01:39:47,454 --> 01:39:49,258
You want to get her married, right?

1324
01:39:50,175 --> 01:39:52,011
Forget their son.

1325
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,878
She'll marry our son.

1326
01:39:56,995 --> 01:40:01,308
But the wedding should
happen in the next 10 days.

1327
01:40:05,993 --> 01:40:07,322
Do you agree?

1328
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:17,517
Come in now, Brother.

1329
01:40:23,905 --> 01:40:25,849
Keep the fruits inside.

1330
01:40:26,175 --> 01:40:27,792
- Mom.
- Take these.

1331
01:40:27,872 --> 01:40:29,014
- Yes.
- Was uncle here?

1332
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:31,300
My son is back!

1333
01:40:31,837 --> 01:40:34,122
Have some sweets first. Take.

1334
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:37,834
That's okay, but what's all this?
And why was uncle here?

1335
01:40:38,349 --> 01:40:40,183
To fix your alliance.

1336
01:40:41,007 --> 01:40:41,845
We've done it.

1337
01:40:41,925 --> 01:40:44,470
You fixed my alliance?
Without asking me?

1338
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:47,842
We don't ask our kids
before doing all this.

1339
01:40:48,466 --> 01:40:50,407
If your parents can get you educated..

1340
01:40:50,487 --> 01:40:53,386
..then they have the authority
to get you married too.

1341
01:40:53,466 --> 01:40:54,886
That's not what I meant, Mom.

1342
01:40:55,405 --> 01:40:57,133
But you should have at least told me.

1343
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:58,668
Who's the girl?

1344
01:40:58,942 --> 01:41:01,720
You know her, and you'll like her.

1345
01:41:02,193 --> 01:41:03,268
But who is she?

1346
01:41:05,008 --> 01:41:05,874
Roop.

1347
01:41:05,954 --> 01:41:09,136
Are you out of your mind, Mom?
She's going to marry brother.

1348
01:41:09,216 --> 01:41:13,670
They love each other.
You got this alliance fixed.

1349
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,736
I agree that we're
not on talking terms..

1350
01:41:15,816 --> 01:41:18,228
..but I can't stoop to this level.

1351
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:21,510
Roop calls me her brother.
And I call her sister-in-law.

1352
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:25,038
- And you want me to marry her?
- They are the one who agreed.

1353
01:41:25,118 --> 01:41:27,758
- And I couldn't refuse my brother.
- But this is wrong.

1354
01:41:27,841 --> 01:41:31,475
I don't know all that,
but I've said yes to this alliance..

1355
01:41:31,555 --> 01:41:35,013
..and you must agree too,
for your mother's sake.

1356
01:41:35,093 --> 01:41:38,051
Mom, if you're stubborn,
then I am your son.

1357
01:41:38,131 --> 01:41:41,328
I will never agree to this alliance.

1358
01:42:26,671 --> 01:42:29,840
No one will know
unless someone sees it.

1359
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:33,950
Let me open the curtains.

1360
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:50,548
I am going to die!

1361
01:42:50,628 --> 01:42:55,466
- I don't want to live!
- Ma'am, open the door!

1362
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:59,178
Save me. I am going to die!

1363
01:42:59,258 --> 01:43:02,542
Ma'am, open the door! Ma'am!

1364
01:43:03,966 --> 01:43:05,452
Jeet! Jeet!

1365
01:43:05,773 --> 01:43:09,049
Jeet! Jeet! Jeet!

1366
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:19,565
- Jeet! Jeet! Jeet!
- Yes?

1367
01:43:19,645 --> 01:43:21,883
Your mom has locked herself
in the room! Come quick!

1368
01:43:21,966 --> 01:43:23,716
- Hurry up, dear! Come on!
- Come.

1369
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,209
I hope she's okay.

1370
01:43:26,139 --> 01:43:27,804
Come on!

1371
01:43:29,444 --> 01:43:33,569
Mom! Mom, open the door!
Open the door!

1372
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:36,467
- Mom, open the door!
- Ma'am, open the door.

1373
01:43:36,856 --> 01:43:38,720
- Mom!
- Please, open!

1374
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,211
- Mom! Open the door!
- Ma'am, please open.

1375
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:43,266
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

1376
01:43:43,346 --> 01:43:45,758
When the son starts
disrespting his mother..

1377
01:43:45,841 --> 01:43:48,941
..a mother doesn't
feel like living anymore.

1378
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:53,056
I don't want to live anymore.
I want to die.

1379
01:43:53,136 --> 01:43:55,779
Stop being childish, Mom.
Open the door.

1380
01:43:56,119 --> 01:43:59,047
- You can stick to your decision.
- Mom tell me, what's the matter?

1381
01:43:59,127 --> 01:44:01,390
- And I'll stick to mine.
- Mom, please open the door.

1382
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:05,817
I don't want to live.

1383
01:44:05,897 --> 01:44:08,596
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1384
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:10,962
- I don't want to live.
- Mom!

1385
01:44:13,537 --> 01:44:14,840
- Ma'am!
- Mom!

1386
01:44:15,409 --> 01:44:18,163
Mom!
Stop being childish!

1387
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:21,731
Why are you doing this?

1388
01:44:27,091 --> 01:44:28,396
What is it?

1389
01:44:30,133 --> 01:44:32,425
Why are you doing this?
Tell me what the matter is.

1390
01:44:32,508 --> 01:44:34,751
I'll do as I please.

1391
01:44:36,946 --> 01:44:38,735
I don't want to live anymore.

1392
01:44:39,404 --> 01:44:41,903
My son doesn't listen to me.

1393
01:44:42,472 --> 01:44:43,958
What do you want!

1394
01:44:45,523 --> 01:44:47,009
Say yes to the alliance.

1395
01:44:48,345 --> 01:44:50,807
You're asking me to kill myself.

1396
01:44:51,945 --> 01:44:57,424
No. I want you to say yes
to this alliance and get married.

1397
01:44:58,317 --> 01:45:00,704
Make us happy.

1398
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:08,570
If it's about your stubbornness,
then get me married.

1399
01:45:09,404 --> 01:45:10,587
I agree.

1400
01:45:11,667 --> 01:45:15,124
But don't ever ask me
why I don't smile anymore.

1401
01:45:16,935 --> 01:45:18,463
Bless you, my son.

1402
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:21,933
Hey, get me some sweets.

1403
01:45:22,278 --> 01:45:25,977
I'll do it.
I'll get you married in 10 days.

1404
01:45:44,808 --> 01:45:46,684
- Greetings, Uncle.
- Greetings.

1405
01:45:55,339 --> 01:45:57,178
The matter is awkward.

1406
01:45:58,398 --> 01:46:00,973
But I didn't want Roop to be accused..

1407
01:46:02,143 --> 01:46:04,160
..of her alliance being called off.

1408
01:46:06,298 --> 01:46:07,847
Roop is a wise girl.

1409
01:46:08,633 --> 01:46:12,376
I am certain that she will understand.

1410
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:16,917
Okay, I'll make a move.

1411
01:46:17,389 --> 01:46:18,936
Make arrangements for the wedding.

1412
01:46:19,714 --> 01:46:22,199
They want to marry
in the next 10 days.

1413
01:46:24,207 --> 01:46:25,707
Dear Lord!

1414
01:46:33,675 --> 01:46:36,502
Mom, what did uncle say?

1415
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:39,508
I'm sorry,
but I overheard him saying..

1416
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,581
..they want to marry
in the next 10 days.

1417
01:46:44,102 --> 01:46:46,581
What's wrong? Why are you sad?

1418
01:46:46,661 --> 01:46:49,469
Don't worry,
you won't have to spend much.

1419
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:55,197
I'll stitch my own clothes,
and we'll borrow the rest.

1420
01:46:58,134 --> 01:47:00,553
Mom, you're my friend, aren't you?

1421
01:47:00,633 --> 01:47:03,339
Tell me what it is.
Is there a problem?

1422
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:10,510
- You are marrying into
their family, but.. - Yes.

1423
01:47:10,962 --> 01:47:14,678
I know, Jass is a Jaddi Sardar.

1424
01:47:15,446 --> 01:47:17,800
Now you're getting
married into the family..

1425
01:47:18,164 --> 01:47:20,256
..of his younger brother.

1426
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:23,234
What do you mean? I don't understand.

1427
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:27,662
I mean, you won't marry
Jagtar Singh's son, Jass.

1428
01:47:27,932 --> 01:47:30,970
You'll marry Shamsher
Singh's son, Jeet.

1429
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,161
What!

1430
01:47:32,955 --> 01:47:35,310
Mom, how could you even think of that!

1431
01:47:36,515 --> 01:47:40,448
I think of Jeet as my brother.

1432
01:47:43,848 --> 01:47:48,683
I never looked at any boy all my life.

1433
01:47:49,263 --> 01:47:52,021
I studied with my head down.

1434
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:55,447
So that your honour
could remain intact.

1435
01:47:58,753 --> 01:48:01,101
Jass means everything to me.

1436
01:48:02,728 --> 01:48:04,095
I can't do this.

1437
01:48:04,691 --> 01:48:06,511
I was helpless, dear.

1438
01:48:06,591 --> 01:48:10,266
You know that after your
father's demise, we were miserable.

1439
01:48:10,561 --> 01:48:13,258
It was your uncle who supported us..

1440
01:48:13,341 --> 01:48:15,425
..and helped complete your education.

1441
01:48:15,788 --> 01:48:19,261
When it was about his word,
I couldn't have backed out.

1442
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:24,013
Mom, can you ruin my life
for the sake of uncle's word?

1443
01:48:25,001 --> 01:48:27,063
Can you see your daughter
unhappy for the rest of her life?

1444
01:48:27,143 --> 01:48:29,553
But what's our fault in all this?

1445
01:48:29,633 --> 01:48:32,494
Jassi and his family
have cancelled this alliance.

1446
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,633
They threw the gifts
at your uncle's face.

1447
01:48:35,807 --> 01:48:38,511
Ms. Mindo saved our honour.

1448
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:41,034
You tell me, what's our fault?

1449
01:48:42,055 --> 01:48:44,873
This is wrong. I won't marry him.

1450
01:49:54,738 --> 01:49:57,327
'The person you're calling is not..'

1451
01:50:05,341 --> 01:50:06,370
Take this.

1452
01:50:06,981 --> 01:50:08,940
It's your father's turban.

1453
01:50:09,818 --> 01:50:12,101
Get rid of it..

1454
01:50:13,376 --> 01:50:17,004
..and then, you can do as you please.

1455
01:50:23,404 --> 01:50:25,591
If it's about dad's honour..

1456
01:50:28,941 --> 01:50:30,203
..then I'm ready.

1457
01:50:41,622 --> 01:50:44,675
"I'm helpless."

1458
01:50:44,758 --> 01:50:49,496
- "I'm not disloyal."
- Don't cry!

1459
01:50:54,762 --> 01:51:03,656
"Don't reveal our secrets to anyone."

1460
01:51:04,132 --> 01:51:12,184
"I cried a lot and compromised
with the situation."

1461
01:51:14,063 --> 01:51:20,489
"I won't be happy with the one
my parents have chosen for me."

1462
01:51:20,569 --> 01:51:27,775
"I won't be happy with the one
my parents have chosen for me."

1463
01:51:29,133 --> 01:51:30,843
Greetings, Mom.

1464
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:37,581
I never imagined this
would happen with us.

1465
01:51:39,716 --> 01:51:40,753
What's wrong, Mom?

1466
01:51:42,633 --> 01:51:43,908
You look disturbed.

1467
01:51:44,481 --> 01:51:45,425
What happened?

1468
01:51:45,733 --> 01:51:48,556
I heard about lands being divided.

1469
01:51:49,392 --> 01:51:52,044
But our relatives
have crossed all limits.

1470
01:51:53,227 --> 01:51:55,079
Along with the land..

1471
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,448
..they took your wife too.

1472
01:51:59,055 --> 01:52:02,050
What are you talking about, Mom?
Are you all right?

1473
01:52:05,012 --> 01:52:09,341
I am all right,
but when you'll learn the truth..

1474
01:52:09,425 --> 01:52:11,428
..you'll be shocked.

1475
01:52:11,508 --> 01:52:13,439
You adored your aunt, didn't you?

1476
01:52:13,966 --> 01:52:15,800
She got your alliance called off..

1477
01:52:15,883 --> 01:52:17,513
..and is getting her
son married to her now.

1478
01:52:18,213 --> 01:52:19,137
Yes.

1479
01:52:38,176 --> 01:52:39,426
Aunt!

1480
01:52:40,911 --> 01:52:42,132
Aunt!

1481
01:52:43,602 --> 01:52:44,652
Aunt!

1482
01:52:47,295 --> 01:52:48,598
Aunt!

1483
01:52:51,749 --> 01:52:54,370
- Yes?
- Aunt, is mom telling the truth?

1484
01:52:54,758 --> 01:52:55,566
Why?

1485
01:52:56,416 --> 01:52:58,850
Don't you believe your mother?

1486
01:52:59,383 --> 01:53:01,008
Or do you want to hear it from me?

1487
01:53:01,088 --> 01:53:04,590
All right, then, listen.

1488
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:08,559
Yes, I fixed my son's
alliance over there.

1489
01:53:08,916 --> 01:53:12,212
But you know that
I asked for it first.

1490
01:53:12,635 --> 01:53:14,470
We like each other.

1491
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:16,778
Mind your tongue!

1492
01:53:16,986 --> 01:53:19,511
She's going to be my daughter-in-law.

1493
01:53:19,591 --> 01:53:24,372
And I won't tolerate anyone
talking like that about her!

1494
01:53:24,684 --> 01:53:28,303
Don't you dare even
think about her again!

1495
01:53:28,383 --> 01:53:29,675
I'll kill you!

1496
01:53:29,758 --> 01:53:32,114
Try touching my son
if you have the guts.

1497
01:53:32,194 --> 01:53:33,845
You'll see what I can do.

1498
01:53:33,925 --> 01:53:35,553
Mom, what are you saying?

1499
01:53:35,633 --> 01:53:40,264
First, you insult people,
and then come to talk to them!

1500
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:44,466
Shameless people! Get lost now!

1501
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:46,511
- Take him along!
- Aunt..

1502
01:53:47,063 --> 01:53:49,764
Dear Lord, bless me.

1503
01:53:54,805 --> 01:53:55,893
Dear Lord!

1504
01:53:56,633 --> 01:53:58,284
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

1505
01:54:00,216 --> 01:54:02,503
Why are you quiet, sir?

1506
01:54:03,602 --> 01:54:07,261
Staying quiet won't benefit anyone.
You'll be at a loss instead.

1507
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:08,696
Things will escalate.

1508
01:54:09,841 --> 01:54:13,782
The brothers fought first,
then there was the division..

1509
01:54:14,212 --> 01:54:15,359
..and now the marriage?

1510
01:54:16,216 --> 01:54:18,011
Am I right, sir?

1511
01:54:18,091 --> 01:54:23,641
Gogi, if things were in my control,
I would have handled it already.

1512
01:54:23,962 --> 01:54:28,303
I'm only waiting for the moment
where both my sons..

1513
01:54:28,383 --> 01:54:30,966
..will unite before I die.

1514
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:32,800
Don't say that, sir.

1515
01:54:33,216 --> 01:54:35,107
Sir, you're the eldest.

1516
01:54:35,509 --> 01:54:37,131
- Who can deny you?
- Yes.

1517
01:54:37,211 --> 01:54:38,845
At least try talking to them.

1518
01:54:38,925 --> 01:54:42,728
Gogi, when a person gets selfish..

1519
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:46,954
..they can only be
taught a lesson by time.

1520
01:54:47,327 --> 01:54:48,772
Only time will tell what happens.

1521
01:54:49,012 --> 01:54:51,153
Sir, I'm just afraid..

1522
01:54:51,931 --> 01:54:55,645
.. that it might be too late
and things might get out of control.

1523
01:54:55,725 --> 01:54:58,428
Silly, they are my sons, after all.

1524
01:54:58,508 --> 01:54:59,970
They are bound to be hot-headed.

1525
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:04,116
As they say,
one never forgets his roots.

1526
01:55:04,298 --> 01:55:06,659
Just pray to God.

1527
01:55:08,133 --> 01:55:10,598
- Dear Lord, have mercy.
- Dear Lord.

1528
01:55:15,751 --> 01:55:17,551
Here, drink milk, Jassi.

1529
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:19,823
No, Mom, I don't feel like it.

1530
01:55:20,218 --> 01:55:21,334
Drink it, dear.

1531
01:55:21,712 --> 01:55:24,339
Look at you.
You didn't sleep all night.

1532
01:55:24,419 --> 01:55:26,789
You went somewhere
early in the morning.

1533
01:55:26,869 --> 01:55:30,241
And now you're doing this.
Drink it, dear.

1534
01:55:33,765 --> 01:55:36,588
This is too much.
Boys are unpredictable.

1535
01:55:36,873 --> 01:55:40,236
They do what they feel like,
don't even eat.

1536
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:44,937
- Give it to me. I'll try.
- Okay.

1537
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:50,106
- Jassi. Hey, Jassi.
- Yes.

1538
01:55:50,454 --> 01:55:52,104
Why are you doing
it on your own, dear?

1539
01:55:52,374 --> 01:55:53,601
You should have called someone.

1540
01:55:53,681 --> 01:55:55,227
Or we would have
got it washed elsewhere.

1541
01:55:56,151 --> 01:56:00,899
They must be busy, Dad.
Anyway, I had nothing to do.

1542
01:56:01,246 --> 01:56:04,313
Okay, then, drink milk.

1543
01:56:05,938 --> 01:56:08,122
No, Dad, I don't feel like it.

1544
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:16,086
Jassi, dear, I can't see you upset.

1545
01:56:16,864 --> 01:56:19,673
No, Dad, you're misunderstanding.

1546
01:56:19,753 --> 01:56:22,950
You think such things can affect me?

1547
01:56:24,856 --> 01:56:26,815
Jassi, I'm your father.

1548
01:56:28,044 --> 01:56:33,171
When the child is upset,
the parents suffer the most.

1549
01:56:33,639 --> 01:56:35,987
And you look very upset.

1550
01:56:38,277 --> 01:56:39,775
Take my advice.

1551
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:42,804
Go live with your uncle.

1552
01:56:46,061 --> 01:56:48,182
You'll forget the past.

1553
01:56:49,389 --> 01:56:50,888
Don't do this, Dad.

1554
01:56:51,168 --> 01:56:56,375
- I can at least see..
- I don't want you to see things here.

1555
01:56:58,321 --> 01:57:02,199
For the last time,
dear, go to your uncle.

1556
01:57:04,495 --> 01:57:06,292
Consider this my order.

1557
01:57:15,677 --> 01:57:20,198
If it's your order,
Dad, then I accept it.

1558
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:28,607
Bless you.

1559
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:32,810
Land acquired. Sports makes money.

1560
01:57:33,153 --> 01:57:36,873
Well, I must say. Sports is addictive.

1561
01:57:37,127 --> 01:57:39,351
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1562
01:57:39,431 --> 01:57:42,461
Congratulations on
your son's wedding, sir!

1563
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:46,839
Congratulations to you too.
Everything happened in haste.

1564
01:57:46,919 --> 01:57:50,506
There's going to be a wedding
in your family after very long.

1565
01:57:50,586 --> 01:57:52,749
The village head will be ecstatic.

1566
01:57:52,829 --> 01:57:56,298
You're too much.
They are separated now.

1567
01:57:56,378 --> 01:57:57,544
Why would the village
head attend the wedding?

1568
01:57:57,628 --> 01:57:58,544
Right?

1569
01:57:58,628 --> 01:58:03,106
Well, brother will come.
He will definitely come.

1570
01:58:03,186 --> 01:58:07,381
Well, you know that
such tiffs are common.

1571
01:58:07,461 --> 01:58:12,294
Families don't fall apart
over such differences.

1572
01:58:12,378 --> 01:58:14,656
Look at what's happening
in the village.

1573
01:58:14,736 --> 01:58:16,666
Our dear ones are our own.

1574
01:58:17,044 --> 01:58:21,055
Make sure he doesn't miss his flight.

1575
01:58:21,378 --> 01:58:24,646
Come on time. Okay? Bye.

1576
01:58:36,168 --> 01:58:37,304
So..

1577
01:58:45,378 --> 01:58:49,857
- Have you packed?
- Yes, Dad, I have.

1578
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:55,336
Dear, keep this.
This contains 'Pinnis'.

1579
01:58:55,419 --> 01:58:57,794
Have some and give
the rest to your uncle.

1580
01:58:57,878 --> 01:58:58,891
Okay, Mom.

1581
01:58:59,218 --> 01:59:01,549
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1582
01:59:01,629 --> 01:59:03,836
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1583
01:59:03,919 --> 01:59:06,253
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1584
01:59:06,336 --> 01:59:08,807
- "Have it.
- We don't want it."

1585
01:59:22,429 --> 01:59:25,086
Go and stop him. Do something.

1586
01:59:26,751 --> 01:59:27,728
He's my son.

1587
01:59:27,808 --> 01:59:29,520
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1588
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,719
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1589
01:59:31,799 --> 01:59:33,995
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1590
01:59:34,075 --> 01:59:37,019
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1591
01:59:38,044 --> 01:59:40,389
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1592
01:59:40,469 --> 01:59:42,669
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1593
01:59:42,749 --> 01:59:45,128
- "Have it.
- We don't want it."

1594
01:59:45,211 --> 01:59:47,628
- "Taste it.
- We don't want it."

1595
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:49,669
- "Taste it.
- We don't want it."

1596
01:59:49,753 --> 01:59:51,961
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1597
01:59:52,044 --> 01:59:54,294
- "Taste it.
- We don't want it."

1598
01:59:54,378 --> 01:59:56,461
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1599
01:59:56,544 --> 01:59:58,753
- "Mango chutney..
- We don't want it."

1600
01:59:58,836 --> 02:00:01,086
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1601
02:00:01,169 --> 02:00:03,378
- "Have it.
- We don't want it."

1602
02:00:03,461 --> 02:00:05,669
- "Have it.
- We don't want it."

1603
02:00:05,753 --> 02:00:08,044
- "Have it.
- We don't want it."

1604
02:00:08,128 --> 02:00:10,417
- "It's delicious.
- We don't want it."

1605
02:00:17,052 --> 02:00:18,754
Let's go. What has happened?

1606
02:00:34,309 --> 02:00:39,805
'Brother, when you get married,
I'll fire bullets in the air.'

1607
02:00:41,798 --> 02:00:46,253
'We'll burst many more
firecrackers than these.'

1608
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:50,878
'The villagers should know
that it's Jassi's brother's wedding.'

1609
02:00:50,961 --> 02:00:52,892
'It's a big deal.'

1610
02:01:31,294 --> 02:01:34,128
He has started firing bullets!

1611
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:37,756
Get up! Do you want
to see us get killed?

1612
02:01:37,836 --> 02:01:41,433
Dear Lord!
He's still a servant of theirs!

1613
02:01:41,513 --> 02:01:44,080
He's still in agony!
I'll have to do something.

1614
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,831
I'll get a gun and show him.

1615
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:00,878
'My brother's word
means the most to me.'

1616
02:02:00,961 --> 02:02:02,457
'I swear, Brother.'

1617
02:02:02,992 --> 02:02:06,294
'I want you as my brother
for all my lives.'

1618
02:02:06,378 --> 02:02:08,382
'You're the best
brother in the world.'

1619
02:02:13,653 --> 02:02:18,835
I'll teach them a lesson.
Wait and watch.

1620
02:02:22,003 --> 02:02:26,071
How dare they! Here, take this!

1621
02:02:32,489 --> 02:02:35,516
It's okay, Mom.
Let them do what they want.

1622
02:03:58,987 --> 02:04:01,277
So, how's the atmosphere in the house?

1623
02:04:01,698 --> 02:04:04,935
She was going to marry Jassi,
now she's marrying Jeet.

1624
02:04:05,415 --> 02:04:08,594
She'll get a taste of both of them!

1625
02:04:10,072 --> 02:04:13,690
Well, both the brothers are miserable.

1626
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:15,917
They don't belong anywhere now.

1627
02:04:15,997 --> 02:04:20,802
They've lost face in
the village and their homes.

1628
02:04:22,844 --> 02:04:25,488
Well, it's now that we've
truly taken our revenge.

1629
02:04:25,568 --> 02:04:27,502
We've taught a lesson to our enemies.

1630
02:04:28,086 --> 02:04:33,336
Idiots! A revenge completes
not when you teach a lesson..

1631
02:04:33,419 --> 02:04:35,661
..but when you finish off the enemy.

1632
02:04:41,094 --> 02:04:43,200
Call him.

1633
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:47,294
Listen to me.

1634
02:04:47,378 --> 02:04:50,423
I asked you to get utensils.

1635
02:04:50,503 --> 02:04:56,206
Why do you mess things up?

1636
02:04:56,628 --> 02:04:59,714
You don't get it?
I'll explain to you later.

1637
02:04:59,794 --> 02:05:02,600
Listen.. What! You won't get it?

1638
02:05:02,923 --> 02:05:07,531
All right, then,
don't ask for work again. Go to hell!

1639
02:05:07,611 --> 02:05:08,954
Goodbye!

1640
02:05:09,773 --> 02:05:12,423
Hey, Laddu, you aren't ready yet?

1641
02:05:12,503 --> 02:05:15,336
I mean, why aren't you ready?

1642
02:05:16,447 --> 02:05:20,770
Weddings these days are weird.

1643
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,562
They want to have royal weddings.

1644
02:05:23,642 --> 02:05:27,130
I don't feel happy,
so I won't go, Dad.

1645
02:05:28,672 --> 02:05:30,469
- I'm not coming.
- What did you say?

1646
02:05:30,801 --> 02:05:34,336
Hey! We've been loyal
to them all our lives!

1647
02:05:34,416 --> 02:05:38,669
What will people say if we don't
participate in their happiness?

1648
02:05:38,753 --> 02:05:41,753
You're not going to the wedding
even when they've invited us.

1649
02:05:41,833 --> 02:05:46,211
They told you to drop Jassi
to the airport and you didn't go.

1650
02:05:46,291 --> 02:05:48,062
What do you want to do?

1651
02:05:48,418 --> 02:05:52,175
Dad, we were three friends, not two.

1652
02:05:52,454 --> 02:05:56,298
If I side with one,
the other will feel bad.

1653
02:05:56,378 --> 02:05:57,856
So I'm not going anywhere.

1654
02:06:02,032 --> 02:06:03,580
Your sister didn't come either.

1655
02:06:04,003 --> 02:06:06,544
Everyone must be waiting.

1656
02:06:07,044 --> 02:06:09,111
- I've told her not to come.
- Why?

1657
02:06:10,024 --> 02:06:13,628
I told her I'll forget her
if she attends the wedding.

1658
02:06:14,372 --> 02:06:18,306
She'll be at a loss.

1659
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:22,317
You can go, Dad. We won't go.

1660
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:26,253
Fine! It's up to you!
Do what you want!

1661
02:06:26,336 --> 02:06:27,961
I'm going to the wedding procession.

1662
02:06:28,044 --> 02:06:31,222
Go to the fields
and do some work then.

1663
02:06:31,302 --> 02:06:34,212
We don't want to starve. Understand?

1664
02:06:34,627 --> 02:06:36,304
- Dad.
- Yes.

1665
02:06:36,761 --> 02:06:39,919
Which field do I have to go to?
The field has been divided.

1666
02:06:40,003 --> 02:06:42,249
The cattle might have a dispute.

1667
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,620
Greetings, Grandpa.

1668
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:25,597
Bless you.

1669
02:07:27,253 --> 02:07:30,520
This is Jeet's share of the offerings.

1670
02:07:31,525 --> 02:07:32,628
Give it to him.

1671
02:07:36,253 --> 02:07:38,964
- Take care, dear.
- Yes.

1672
02:07:39,294 --> 02:07:43,297
Don't forget your old grandfather.

1673
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:39,964
Jassi.

1674
02:09:14,296 --> 02:09:19,131
"I've been shattered numurous times."

1675
02:09:19,211 --> 02:09:23,378
"I was punished for being in love."

1676
02:09:23,461 --> 02:09:28,343
"I am not at peace now."

1677
02:09:28,423 --> 02:09:32,997
"Who should I share my agony with?"

1678
02:09:33,077 --> 02:09:37,641
"There's something else in my heart.
I've lost my mind."

1679
02:09:37,721 --> 02:09:42,214
"Why did you change so soon?"

1680
02:09:42,294 --> 02:09:46,122
"Why did you change so soon?"

1681
02:09:46,874 --> 02:09:51,494
"Those who I loved at some point..

1682
02:09:51,574 --> 02:09:56,007
..have come to kill me now."

1683
02:09:56,087 --> 02:10:00,688
"Those who I loved at some point.."

1684
02:10:00,768 --> 02:10:05,003
"..have come to kill me now."

1685
02:10:06,211 --> 02:10:07,878
How much do you want, girls?

1686
02:10:07,961 --> 02:10:11,169
We want 5100 from him.

1687
02:10:11,253 --> 02:10:12,600
Right.

1688
02:10:13,336 --> 02:10:17,294
'Listen, dear,
when my younger son gets married..'

1689
02:10:18,044 --> 02:10:22,836
'..no matter how much money
his sisters-in-law demand..'

1690
02:10:22,919 --> 02:10:24,378
'..I wil give them 21,000.'

1691
02:10:25,878 --> 02:10:29,253
'People should know that Jaddi
Sardar's son is getting married.'

1692
02:10:29,336 --> 02:10:30,586
'Right?'

1693
02:10:36,508 --> 02:10:37,506
Here you go. 21,000.'

1694
02:10:37,586 --> 02:10:42,193
"I never thought that
a day like this would come."

1695
02:10:42,273 --> 02:10:47,148
"When suddenly,
from being happy, we'd be sad."

1696
02:10:51,378 --> 02:10:55,967
"I never thought that
a day like this would come."

1697
02:10:56,047 --> 02:11:00,669
"When suddenly,
from being happy, we'd be sad."

1698
02:11:00,749 --> 02:11:05,336
"What's happened!
As if everything's over."

1699
02:11:05,419 --> 02:11:09,836
"I'm distressed."

1700
02:11:09,919 --> 02:11:13,756
"I'm distressed."

1701
02:11:14,565 --> 02:11:19,151
"Those who I loved at some point.."

1702
02:11:19,231 --> 02:11:23,701
"..have come to kill me now."

1703
02:11:23,781 --> 02:11:28,348
"Those who I loved at some point.."

1704
02:11:28,428 --> 02:11:33,144
"..have come to kill me now."

1705
02:11:46,961 --> 02:11:51,444
"I prayed to have them.."

1706
02:11:51,524 --> 02:11:56,013
"..but I couldn't have them."

1707
02:12:00,751 --> 02:12:05,294
"I prayed to have them.."

1708
02:12:05,378 --> 02:12:09,669
"..but I couldn't have them."

1709
02:12:09,753 --> 02:12:14,586
"We're about to do something crazy."

1710
02:12:14,669 --> 02:12:19,044
"Our dear ones turned away from us."

1711
02:12:19,128 --> 02:12:23,423
"Our dear ones turned away from us."

1712
02:12:23,777 --> 02:12:28,367
"Those who I loved at some point.."

1713
02:12:28,447 --> 02:12:33,012
"..have come to kill me now."

1714
02:12:33,092 --> 02:12:37,642
"Those who I loved at some point.."

1715
02:12:37,722 --> 02:12:44,216
"..have come to kill me now."

1716
02:13:31,672 --> 02:13:33,582
Are you happy now?

1717
02:13:34,443 --> 02:13:36,140
You didn't listen to me, did you?

1718
02:13:36,436 --> 02:13:40,966
I told you not to do
it against Jeet's will.

1719
02:13:41,337 --> 02:13:43,894
You didn't listen. He's gone now.

1720
02:13:45,647 --> 02:13:50,163
I didn't know Jeet would do this.

1721
02:13:52,483 --> 02:13:55,169
If something was the matter,
you should have told me.

1722
02:13:55,675 --> 02:13:58,169
I would have endured the humiliation..

1723
02:13:58,253 --> 02:14:00,294
..of the alliance being called off.

1724
02:14:00,378 --> 02:14:02,094
The groom running away
from the wedding is even worse.

1725
02:14:02,869 --> 02:14:07,150
You too pressurised me, Brother.

1726
02:14:07,909 --> 02:14:09,503
I was helpless.

1727
02:14:10,378 --> 02:14:13,018
I couldn't have lost my brother.

1728
02:14:14,023 --> 02:14:18,428
You should have.
We would at least have our son.

1729
02:14:18,623 --> 02:14:23,721
Sir, don't worry.
Jeet has gone to the hospital.

1730
02:15:17,129 --> 02:15:21,793
Listen, we've called the men.
The wedding is happening there.

1731
02:15:22,179 --> 02:15:23,910
- What's next?
- Yes.

1732
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,276
You two are idiots.

1733
02:15:29,733 --> 02:15:34,382
Don't you know what happens
when the men get drunk at weddings?

1734
02:15:34,462 --> 02:15:37,030
Idiots. Don't they act stupid?

1735
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:38,661
Do you remember that incident?

1736
02:15:38,741 --> 02:15:43,973
The dancer almost got shot.
The same can happen today.

1737
02:16:28,617 --> 02:16:31,235
- Laddu! Laddu!
- Yes, Papa.

1738
02:16:31,315 --> 02:16:33,783
- Calling Jassi?
- Yes, Papa.

1739
02:16:33,867 --> 02:16:35,055
Get in.

1740
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:39,990
Stop the car. Stop.

1741
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:55,480
Come on.

1742
02:20:55,093 --> 02:20:58,075
No, Jassi, don't shoot him.
Please don't shoot him.

1743
02:20:58,158 --> 02:21:01,251
Please, for your brother's sake,
don't kill my brother.

1744
02:21:01,331 --> 02:21:03,408
You have a brother too.
Don't shoot him.

1745
02:21:03,492 --> 02:21:05,991
Don't shoot him. You idiot!

1746
02:21:06,071 --> 02:21:09,283
Why were you carrying a gun?
Please don't kill him.

1747
02:21:09,367 --> 02:21:12,090
He's like a brother to you.
Don't kill him.

1748
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:15,738
You! Please spare him.
Please, don't shoot. Please.

1749
02:21:15,818 --> 02:21:19,575
Please, don't shoot.
Let's go, come on!

1750
02:21:19,658 --> 02:21:21,966
You should have shot at his head.

1751
02:21:37,658 --> 02:21:39,872
The patient has lost a lot of blood.

1752
02:21:39,952 --> 02:21:41,876
- His blood group is O negative.
- Yes.

1753
02:21:41,956 --> 02:21:43,791
We need blood right now.

1754
02:21:43,871 --> 02:21:46,007
O negative is not available
in our blood bank.

1755
02:21:46,087 --> 02:21:49,648
Please arrange for it somehow.
We need to transfuse it urgently.

1756
02:22:32,595 --> 02:22:33,908
Father-in-law!

1757
02:22:54,571 --> 02:22:56,402
Wise men.

1758
02:22:56,874 --> 02:22:59,863
You did divide the land.

1759
02:23:00,491 --> 02:23:03,163
But you couldn't divide
the blood of your sons.

1760
02:23:09,347 --> 02:23:15,650
We made a huge mistake.

1761
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,741
Please forgive us, Father-in-law.

1762
02:23:21,208 --> 02:23:22,983
We made a mistake.

1763
02:23:26,367 --> 02:23:29,854
The patient is out of danger.
You can meet him if you want.

1764
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:33,113
- Thank God.
- Come.

1765
02:24:15,386 --> 02:24:18,627
Father-in-law, please forgive us.

1766
02:24:18,978 --> 02:24:23,815
Anyway, we have realised our mistake.

1767
02:24:23,895 --> 02:24:25,868
So, what would you call yourself?

1768
02:24:27,602 --> 02:24:31,081
Well, an idiot.

1769
02:24:33,219 --> 02:24:35,531
- Brother.
- What?

1770
02:24:36,564 --> 02:24:38,304
I'm an idiot too.

1771
02:24:47,813 --> 02:24:49,152
Greetings!

1772
02:24:52,327 --> 02:24:53,214
Son-in-law!

1773
02:24:53,294 --> 02:24:55,155
- Tell me.
- Come on.

1774
02:24:55,235 --> 02:24:57,325
- What happened?
- Come.

1775
02:24:58,568 --> 02:25:01,037
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1776
02:25:02,021 --> 02:25:04,118
- Come, ma'am.
- Yes.

1777
02:25:05,465 --> 02:25:07,338
Come. Come, dear.

1778
02:25:07,607 --> 02:25:10,062
- We'll sit out.
- Come.

1779
02:25:16,391 --> 02:25:18,992
Jassi, look who's here.

1780
02:25:50,924 --> 02:25:53,423
"Beautiful girl."

1781
02:25:53,503 --> 02:25:56,075
"I won't leave your side."

1782
02:25:56,158 --> 02:26:01,427
"You're mine, and I'll be yours."

1783
02:26:01,507 --> 02:26:06,706
"You own my heart and soul."

1784
02:26:06,786 --> 02:26:11,825
"I won't love anyone other than you."

1785
02:26:11,905 --> 02:26:14,658
"Beautiful girl."

1786
02:26:14,742 --> 02:26:17,325
"I won't leave your side."

1787
02:26:17,405 --> 02:26:22,668
"You're mine, and I'll be yours."

1788
02:26:22,748 --> 02:26:25,893
"Beautiful girl."

1789
02:26:35,908 --> 02:26:39,367
Why are you so worried, Jeet?
You're going to be a father.

1790
02:26:39,450 --> 02:26:42,917
I'm not worried, I'm just excited.

1791
02:26:42,997 --> 02:26:44,309
Be happy.

1792
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:48,751
Oh, my..

1793
02:26:49,929 --> 02:26:54,033
All right, I have the baby,
and he belongs to his aunt.

1794
02:26:54,117 --> 02:26:56,596
- Let me at least see him, sister-in-law.
- Look!

1795
02:26:56,676 --> 02:26:59,468
Isn't he beautiful?
Who is he? Who is he?

1796
02:26:59,548 --> 02:27:00,908
- Who is he?
- Brother.

1797
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:02,508
Brother.
