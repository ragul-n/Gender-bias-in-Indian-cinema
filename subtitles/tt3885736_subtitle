00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,500
It is a chance, no?

21
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,100
Is there any benefit for you?

22
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,200
On asking if there is any benefit.

23
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
If he gets impressed, then
there will be benefit.

24
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,500
It's a matter of luck, no?

25
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,400
He is an editor no? Watch out
when you enter the lift with him!

26
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,300
He better take care!

27
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Othenlvise, his lift won't go up!

28
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,100

Wait, wait...

34
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
Why peeping? Don't you know
your own vehicle's number?

35
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
It is not mine.
It belongs to a friend.

36
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,900
Oh, is that so?

37
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Then must see the
documents of the vehicle.

38
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,700
There are no papers, found in it.
Will it be a problem?

39
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
No. Just tell Sir. Go.

40
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
If you give me that phone.

41
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
The papers are not found in the car.

42
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,700
Before setting off in the morning...

43
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,000
"shouldn't you take
book and papers?

44
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
No papers, neither knows

45
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,100
Who knows if it is stolen?

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,600
That's what I, said. I will call owner
of the car. And sir can talk to him.

47
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,500
What is the use of that?

What will he say?
Will he say, it is his cal'?

49

blast. Who will be responsible?

Not with a news paper.

cards, saying they are freelancers.

58
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,400

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,600
If things continues like this.
An accident is certain.

94
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,800
Here.

95
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
If the papers were not in the car
Why didn't you tell me, earlier'?

96
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Sorry.

97
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
What sorry.

98
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,600
This pig had not raped
me with his tongue.

99
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Leave it, take it easy.

100
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,600
I'll call you later.

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Whether in the kitchen or in a car
Women can't stop talking.

102
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Finally when the tipper knocks
down, we will have to take them.

103
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
Didn't I tell initially?

104
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,800
First this has to be added.

105
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,500
Here.

106
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,600
To cook we must
have lot of ingredients.

107
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,300
But we must learn
how it must be put to use.

108
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,400
Swamy..l can understand.

109
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Anyway I knew he
is not an African

110
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,800
This is not what I told before.

111
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
Will, pick up one
from this, will that do?

112
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,200
You simply don't mess.

113
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
That is all very easy is it not?

114
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
Hey, not like that.

115
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,300
This time that must
be made possible.

116
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,800
MC Movie Channel

117
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,800
What is it sir?

118
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,400
Anjali Arakkal.

119
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,200
Are you on any important
assignment now?

120
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,400
Nothing like that sir.

121
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,900
One person wants to
write his service story.

122
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Who is it sir?

123
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Jail superintendent Rama Murthy.

124
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
We were together at school.

125
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,800
Everybody writes
autobiography, these days, no?

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,900
So he has also got a desire.

127
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,300
Murthy doesn't have
the skill to write.

128
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Must write and give.

129
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
The book won't have
your name but...

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,300
What do you say?

131
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Swamy, didn't I tell?

132
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,500
Now go on boldly
planning your autobiography.

133
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll give to your autobiography writer.

134
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Yes, Mr. KK has told.

135
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,900
That is not a problem.

136
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
Sir, you can tell your
convenient time.

137
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Without doing any crime.

138
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,700
The person was put on trial.

139
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
An unfortunate person Joesph. K.

140
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
I'll wait, when sir tells I'll come.

141
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
When the book gets
published, anyway...

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,900
...there will be lot ofjealous people.

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
In a way that is good for us.

144
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Even slander is publicity.

145
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,800
Then..For me there is only 4
more months left for retirement.

146
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
The book must be
released in tune with that.

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,700
Yes, take tea.

148
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
MC Movie Channel

149
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,700
For the prisoners there
are various schemes...

150
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,700
...which are devised by me.

151
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
That should be the
main high light in my book.

152
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you know
what are the schemes?

153
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,800
No.

154
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Even the journalists like
you, don't know that.

155
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Now for the convicts who go
out after along imprisonment.

156
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,800
For them.

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
A re habilitation program.

158
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
After all this years
being inside the jail.

159
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,900
When going out, being lonely in the
society, many will have to face that.

160
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,300
That is where this
scheme is relevant.

161
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,700
For example, this Raghavan,
who is standing here.

162
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,600
For several years he is in here.

163
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,500
While going out he
didn't know what to do.

164
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
But now it is not like that.

165
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
For Raghavan to
start a small business...

166
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,000
...a bank has told will
do the necessary help.

167
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,300
That will do for him to survive.

168
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,700
A sudden madness for a moment.

169
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,700
That is what happens norm ally.

170
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What has he done? To come here.

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Killed two people.

172
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,000
That too two ladies.

173
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,000
One is his wife.

174
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,000
And another one, a Marvadi
girl where he was working.

175
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
For the time being, let no one
know about this book writing.

176
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Raghava, take that tray.

177
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,900
I have not killed anyone.

178
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
Three tickets are booked,
one is a waiting list

179
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,700
It got okayed

180
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay then

181
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
The materials to
write is at the house.

182
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
When you come
conveniently, one day.

183
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,200
Will take and give everything.

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,700
The person who went now, his
name is Raghavan, which you told.

185
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,500
Yes, what is it?

186
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,900
No, he like this, told he has not
killed anyone came and told.

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
He is like that.

188
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,500
He won't agree that he is a killer.

189
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,600
Not us, it is court only
which told he is guilty.

190
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
As per the jail records.

191
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
He has killed two people.

192
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,500
HEW'

193
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,200
He is only tough outside,
he is a gentle person.

MC Movie Channel

195
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,100
During the emergency
time, when I was living...

196
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
...under cover
in my own house

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,700
Where were you people?

198
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,900
It is you people who are
the frogs in the well.

199
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
You guys have not seen the world.

200
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,000
Why you are not saying anything?

201
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,000
Will get 'off' soon.

202
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,000
Without mis-spelling 'Ka' and
'Ku' can you spell Kunhikannan?

203
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Hey man, can you do that?

204
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Leave that.

205
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Do you know who
Ku nth akaran Path rose was?

206
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,000
Or Kunnikkal Narayanan,
have you heard?

207
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,700
That is the name of an
elephant is it not?

208
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Heard, is it?

209
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,200
Says Kunnikkal Narayanan
is an elephant.

210
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,000
Hey fellow.

211
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
You guys who doesn't know...

212
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,300
...difference between
a pen and a yam.

213
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,900
At night by nine on putting
the coat and show off.

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
Telling it is news line and
teaching politics to compatriots.

215
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,800
There is no point in telling all
this to you, go, go get lost.

216
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Shall I go?

217
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Go fellow!

218
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
My Chandraji, leave him.

219
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,900
Daily he has to tell some stupidity
for at least half an hour.

220
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,200
Only then he can survive.

221
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,900
Sir, don't you have any otherjob?

222
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,100
Why simply crossing
with those people?

223
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
What am Ito do?
I'm an Angry Old Man!

224
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,000
Can't I not react?

225
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,100
It has been few days
that you are not seen here.

226
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,100
Where were you?

227
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
Ho! Nothing at all a small affair.

228
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,700
Is it own writing or as usual
is it for someone else?

229
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,100
My dear Anwar, let me
go on living like this.

230
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,900
Leave, leave.

231
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Anjali, why can't you stop this
at least now? What use of it?

232
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,700
You are all big journalists
and big salaried people.

233
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,900
She doesn't have
anything of that sort.

234
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,900
If it is ghost, then go on with ghost!

235
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
You boldly carry on writing.

236
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,900
No matter whatever other
say, I'm leaving this job.

237
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
There is no point in
talking to these girls.

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Again doing the same job
which has got no credibility.

239
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
For her, she wants only money, no?

240
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
Everybody knows who has written
the autobiography, for your editor.

241
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
So don't talk much on
credibility and all.

242
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,900
On while carrying on this cottage
industry, only then many people's...

243
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,900
...vehicle will run.

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,900
So because of that you
simply don't poke me.

245
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,700
Satisfied, simply it was lying
on the fence!

246
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,100
Anwar, you take a shot man.

247
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,700
Let that fatigue relieve.

248
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Never mind, take it cool.

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Where is our James?

250
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,900
He and all got better off.

251
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,900
Now at Madras, in some Ad agency.

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,300
Became a task, now
has got a service story.

253
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,900
Lot of materials are there.

254
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
Who else is there?

255
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,700
For a help.

256
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Can get the person and all.
But should pay well.

257
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Otherwise will have to
call some Orissa people.

258
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,400
All that for the comrade's
party convention, do that...

259
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,700
...to gather people.

260
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
This we will handle.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,900
Read the paper man.

262
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Leave it.

263
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,700
Okay, left.

264
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,100
Then whom to get?

265
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Othenlvise that Suresh
of ours is there.

266
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,300
Will that do?

267
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
Sister did you see
that Jacob Chettan?

268
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
Hey fellow did you
send that courier'?

269
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
My Mohanan Mash,(Tutor)
I have send long back.

270
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Sister Jacob Chettan(Brother)?

271
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Hey man, who is your sister?

272
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,500
Have I not warned you
several times, not to call sister?

273
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,300
Not that sister, sorry madam.

274
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,900
Jacob Chettan, has told that
three months rent is pending.

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,400
That is why.

276
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,100
I'll take care of Jacob
Chettan's things. Who are you?

277
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Are you his wife?

278
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
Superintendent sir has told that...

279
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,900
...madam will come
to interview Raghavan.

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
This application and all
is a government formality.

281
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,900
If it were in sir's office without all
this could have talked to Raghavan.

282
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,100
If it is here means,
Raghavan will be bit more free.

283
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,800
That is true. Is it a feature on
jail or is it a feature on Raghavan?

284
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,900
You people journalist will
not say anything, no?

285
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,100
It is suspense, is it not?

286
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
Little suspense is required is it not?

287
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,400
God, see this after all this years...

288
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,800
...madam is the first person
coming to meet Raghavan.

289
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,700
After all this years, no
one has come is it?

290
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,200
No one has come to see.

291
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,900
Has not gone on parole and
was not hospitalized either.

292
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,300
He likes this place, no?

293
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,700
More than 14 years no
one used to be here.

294
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
Do you know how many
years he is here?

295
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,900
20 years.

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,900
Why is that?

297
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,700
That is what Raghavan is.

298
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,100
The rule is when talking to
prisoners we must be near.

299
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Since this is superintendents case,
no problem. Must leave him fast.

300
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Yea, go.

301
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,200
MC Movie Channel

302
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,500
I..I'm coming as superintendent
Rama Murthy sir has told.

303
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Yes, I have met at the
office on that day.

304
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,000
On account of sil's service story
wanted to discuss some things.

305
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Do I have to talk standing
like this or can I talk by sitting?

306
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,400
Can sit and talk.

307
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,100
Then can I start asking?

308
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,700
While going out from here.

309
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,500
Through superintendents
benefit scheme...

310
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,100
...you are going to start a
new life, is it not?

311
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Are you happy on that?

312
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,300
Is there anything like
new life, old life and all?

313
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
We have got only one life, no?

314
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,400
Then what is this life?

315
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
A brief turbulence before death.

316
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Other than that, what is it?

317
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Not that on going out from here.

318
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,900
Anyway happiness will be there, no?

319
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,600
For that I don't have
any sorrows in here.

320
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Is it because of that even
after the expiry of the term...

321
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
...not trying to go out?

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,300
It has been 20 years, no?

323
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,300
During the childhood we...

324
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,900
Many of the things that
is felt as very far away.

325
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,900
On seeing later, doesn't
it feel it is near'?

326
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
The time is also like that.

327
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,900
At this age of mine, so called 20
years is not such along period.

328
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,300
Not that in between this 20 years.

329
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,500
They told me that I'm the
only first visitor, visiting you.

330
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,600
Till now no one has come
to meet you. Is it?

331
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,300
Told, you have not
gone on parole also.

332
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Is it because you are
not interested to meet anyone?

333
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
No, nothing like that.

334
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm a lazy guy, that's all.

335
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
What is this thing?

336
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,900
Brought to record
what we are talking.

337
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,300
It's a recorder.

338
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,900
Only our speech will
be captured in this, is it not?

339
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,300
Won't capture our thoughts, no?

340
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,500
No, no. Not at all.

341
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,800
Not that, is there any machines
invented to capture the thoughts?

342
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,100
To my knowledge,
not invented so far.

343
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,500
Any way that is good.

344
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,900
Now the age is
of inventing anything.

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,500
Then...

346
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,000
The other thing is...

347
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
...that you have not done any crime.

348
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
...used to say that you are innocent.

349
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
When we turn on a switch.

350
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,100
A bulb is capable of
spreading the light in dark areas.

351
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Similarly...

352
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,600
In a place like this,
where there is light.

353
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
On turning on a switch...

354
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,300
...is there any bulb invented
that can create darkness?

355
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,900
This light and truth they
are of the same meaning.

356
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
Both cannot be removed.

357
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
If you want you
can obstruct or cover it.

358
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,300
But it doesn't mean that,
it is not present there.

359
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Only thing is, we are
not seeing it, that's it.

360
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
So, there is a truth which
is there, not seen by anyone.

361
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,300
Nope!

362
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,700
I was not making any sort
of complaint like that.

363
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,200
Shall I take one picture.

365
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,200
This light and truth they
are of the same meaning.

366
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,500
Both cannot be removed.

367
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
If you want you

368

But it doesn't mean that,
it is not present there.

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Only thing is, we are
not seeing it, that's it.

370
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,700
All this is our materials.

371
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
This much is there?

372
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,100
Not only this, some
more are there, will give you.

373
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
For the time being
take this. Rukmini!

374
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,200
Did you get n?

375
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I'm searching that.

376
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
I had met Raghavan.

377
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,300
There is a draw near the bed no?
Check inside that one.

378
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,700
Raghavan?

379
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,500
Not that, I had met Raghavan.

380
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Then what did he say?

381
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Raghavan, is a great fan of sir.

382
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,500
He was only talking about sir.

383
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,800
That is the reason
why he is with me.

384
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Anyway he is a great help to me.

385
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
His way of talking and all
is in a special manner, no?

386
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,500
He's like that.

387
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,400
Earlier, itself great
deal of philosophy.

388
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,300
Heard that writing something
while inside the cell.

389
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,500
What is he writing?

390
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,700
Is it any sort of autobiography?

391
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I have not taken any efforts to
enquire on those kind of things.

392
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,800
This is the one, no?

393
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes, yes.

394
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,800
That has to be
established in a chapter.

395
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
These are some of the poems
that is written by me, long back.

396
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,800
If any corrections are required,
just feel free to do that, okay.

397
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,100
Take this one also.

398
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
It's a small advance.

399
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,200
No need of it sir.

400
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,500
A good thing is about to start, no?
Just keep it.

401
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,900
Sir, can I see what is
written by that Raghavan?

402
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,800
What is that for'?

403
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,100
Is there any benefit
for our book, with that?

404
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,900
Can say that only on seeing it.

405
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,200
That I'll tell him, will that do?

406
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,900
While writing something will
a person become a writer, like that?

407
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
That is not what I meant.

408
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,100
Then what is that, you meant?

409
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,100
Don't confuse me by
asking questions like this.

410
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,200
It would be good if I could just
read those ones which are written.

411
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,200
That is why asked.

412
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,600
But I have not written
anything about Murthy sir in it.

413
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,200
Anyway will have to write about
brother Raghavan in sir's book, no?

414
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,600
It will be good if anything
is obtained...

415
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,900
...from that is written,
that will support it.

416
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,100
Won't it be good?

417
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
My brother Raghavan,
please cooperate.

418
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,600
I was just scribbling all that. I was
never meant to show it to anyone.

419
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,400
I'll also not show anyone. Will that do?
Will just return after reading it.

420
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,600
Why is a person being jailed,
for committing a crime?

421
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,200
Is it for giving him a chance to
repent and become good, or...

422
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,700
...is it by avoiding him thereby
to give security to the society?

423
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,700
A prisoner has got only
'human rights' no 'citizen's right'

424
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,600
Without punishing human being
while only punishing a citizen.

425
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,800
Then how can a human being
have repentance?

426
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Sir, article for the open page
has to be sent, is it not?

427
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,300
There is again time for it, no?

428
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,500
No, it has to be sent today.

429
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Okay, do one thing
send a mail to Varma first.

430
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,900
After 22nd on which ever day,
tell him to fix the meeting.

431
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,800
Okay sir.

432
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,900
Yea, Anjali come and sit.

433
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have read that completely.

434
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,500
What was his name?

435
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,300
On reading some will feel like
a 'Hiaku'.(Japanese poetry)

436
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,700
At the same time on reading
some will feel like 'Zen Buddhism'

437
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
It's a mix of everything.

438
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,400
Certain things what we regularly see.

439
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,800
The way he interprets it, on see it,
will be astonished. Is it not?

440
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Anyway. In a police
officer's autobiography...

441
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,500
...he is not a person who should
be limited to one paragraph.

442
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,700
Especially from a person who
has got a criminal background.

443
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,000
One like this can
be never expected.

444
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,000
It is a genuine writing there
is no amount of trickery.

445
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
Not that sir.

446
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
My confusion is.

447
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,700
There is no need of any confusion.

448
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,400
Is it enough that always writing
like this, on behalf of others?

449
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,200
This is a big opportunity
that you are going to get.

450
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
One person who believes,
he has not done any crime.

451
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,500
Moreover he is jailed
for last twenty years.

452
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,800
Not having much education,
an ordinary person.

453
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,600
Can make any intellectual
astonished. In such a way...

454
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,500
...is his thought and perspectives.

455
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,100
To get a combination of this nature,
that is rare is it not?

456
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
We can publish this on
any of the national magazine.

MC Movie Channel

458
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,100
Did you read, in this
what was written about love?

459
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
What is it sir?

460
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,400
This love is not a big problem.

461
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,400
But a 'prostrate love',
that is a big problem.

462
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,400
That is an advice to
some of our tutors.

463
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,100
Now while looking at the mirror.

464
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
Reminds me of what
is written by Raghavan.

465
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,000
Just read that carefully and see it.

466
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,900
He is a guy who makes
the people confused.

467
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,100
While looking at the
mirror, my reflection is...

468
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,600
"Staying there itself looking at me.

469
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,600
When I move away from
the mirror will it stay there?

470
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Or will it come along with me?

471
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,900
Anyway if I again look at the mirror.

472
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,100
That is there itself, look at me.

473
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,400
I have read that entire note book.

474
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,900
It is really nice, then"

475
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,700
I did a mischief, okay.

476
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,200
I showed that to one or two people.

477
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,600
They all got really astonished.

478
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,000
Look, where are you
getting all this ideas?

479
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,900
There is nothing of that sort.

480
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
When sitting idle will
feel certain things like that.

481
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,200
Then will write it down,
not to forget, that's all.

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,600
Brother, you have written
lot of things like this, no?

483
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,000
But own matters, like those...

484
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
...about own life.

485
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,700
Not a word is written, why is that so?

486
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Why to write all those
things that is known to us, no?

487
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,100
APPuetta!

488
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
Going up, is it not?

489
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,700
I'll go only once you all leave.
You son of a dog!

490
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,900
Brother, did you get?

491
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,400
That will take some time.

492
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,800
Do it at leisure, I just
asked that's all.

493
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,200
Just move a bit away.

495
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Arakkal Anjali, how is
it connected to Arakkal Baby?

496
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Will be an aunty is a distant relation.

497
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,400
Then aunty catch this one.

498
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Do you want 'Karikkan Villa'?
A good case.

499
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,500
No need.

500
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,200
Then in that case, near my house
one guy has chopped 3 people.

501
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,800
On the last April 14th
on the day of 'Vishu'

502
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,000
If that is the one means, can
take it fast also. Why not that one?

503
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,200
My brother, you only
take the case which I told.

504
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,100
Only that is enough as if no
one else has murdered anyone.

505
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,900
Let me check this one.

506
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
This is the one.

507
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,700
'Double homicide life
imprisonment for the accused'

508
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,500
Is this the one?

509
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
'Double homicide life
imprisonment for the accused'

510
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,100
Brother, shall we ask
the route and go?

511
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Will ask this person.

512
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,200
Brother.

513
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,200
Which is the house
of lawyer Eppen?

514
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Told it is near the Deccan Agencies.

515
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,500
Oh yea! That one after going to the
front from here. After the bus stop.

516
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,700
It is the third house.

517
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
Just wait for a while okay.

Came to meet lawyer sir.

522
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,300
If it is case won't take.

523
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,300
It is not a case, just wants
to meet the lawyer.

524

If it is case, won't take okay.

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
Came to discuss a matter?

527
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,000
What matter?

528
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,700
Must clear off fast after discussing.

529
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Come.

530
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,900
What is it child?

531
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,600
What is it?

532
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,100
Sir, didn't you recognize him?

533
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,500
This is Raghavan, sir has
argued for his case, long back.

534
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,700
Take that spectacles.

535
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,900
Yes, yes Raghavan.

536
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,000
How is he related to you?

537
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
No one of mine.

538
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,300
For a study purpose his
case is being referred.

539
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Where is he now?

540
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
At the jail itself.

541
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,000
It has been quite long,
still now not released.

542
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,100
Not that.

543
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,000
What should I do now?
Should I release him now?

544
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,000
I have already told, if it
is case I will not take it.

545
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,000
It is all different.

546
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,100
Lawyer had not come
to release him.

547
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,200
Just wants to know some
details of that case.

548
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,400
What kind of details like?

549
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
I have met this Raghavan,
on going to jail.

550
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
He says he has not killed anyone.

551
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Is he still saying like that?

552
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
He is the guy who has told
I have not done any crime...

553
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,400
...then why lawyer for me?

554
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,900
Child you turn on that fan.

555
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,700
But case at last, by
turning in and out...

556
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,700
Came to my own hands.

557
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,100
Not that one, in the middle.

558
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,000
Then, one who was dead was
a Marvadi girl hailed from here.

559
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,800
He was their driver, is it not?

560
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,200
When that case was
conducted in between that...

561
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,900
...only came to know that his
wife, one year back was killed...

562
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,900
...in the same manner.

563
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,800
That also came on his head.

564
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,700
Frequently he used to
come to teach me the law.

565
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,200
When we ask something he will
counter us with many questions.

566
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
I haven't killed.

567
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,800
If it is repeatedly told,
will court hear all that?

568
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,700
Look, not because of my fault
failed in the case, okay.

569
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,700
All the evidences were against him.

570
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,600
Child, you take that wicks.

571
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,400
Lawyer on what ground is he saying
that he has not done anything?

572
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,900
That Raghavan always says.

573
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That is because he has
got strange reasons, is it not?

574
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,400
My things I know better than anyone
else. No one else knows it better.

575
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm saying I have not done it.

576
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,300
These are the kind of debates.

577
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,900
The forensic report is his
hands and legs prints are there.

578
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,400
On asking, Raghavan does
all this bear evidence?

579
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,100
He will ask in return is it due to...

580
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
...evidence human beings
believe in God?

581
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Who knows the truth.

582
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,800
Can we ask the dead ones?

583
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,500
Hey Kumara!

584
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,400
He is not the old Raghavan, now.

585
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,500
Ladies and all started
coming to visit him.

586
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Who? Brother Raghavan?

587
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Dress him up nicely.

588
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
Those who are coming to
visit are not silly parties.

589
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,000
They are media people.

590
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
Tell them to come to 'C' block.

591
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,900
There a new guy has come.

592
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,400
First poured acid into
the mouth of the wife.

593
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,100
Then after tying both legs and
hands poured kerosene and burned.

594
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
Like us, finishing in one stab.

595
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
That girl need not have
to bear anything.

596
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,000
Kumara!

597
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,900
You don't laugh.

598
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Just shave okay.

599
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,400
During that time along
with this Raghavan...

600
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,100
...the cops came in an old
jeep to take the evidence.

601
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,900
We all had gone to watch.

602
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,800
The girl who was killed by him no?

603
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
She was having asthma issue.

604
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
The com patriots thought
she was dead like that.

605
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
Because of that, at that time
did not do postmortem and all.

606
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Then who is going to check all
that, got dead buried that is it.

607
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
Now who is there at that house?

608
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,400
Only that girl's mother.

609
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,600
MC Movie Channel

610
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,300
When he came, we thought
we are saved.

611
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,000
That became like this.

612
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,100
What Raghavan says is he
has not done anything like that.

613
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,300
All that I don't know. On the
night when Ramani was dead.

614
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
He was here.

615
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,000
By morning had left also.

616
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,000
When I went and checked.

617
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,100
She is lying without life.

618
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,400
Later he was called by sending men.

619
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,300
After the death of the daughter,
does Raghavan come here?

620
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,500
Yea, some times used to come.

621
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,000
Sometimes will give
money to me and go.

622
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,600
After some time, police
came searching for him.

623
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,200
They only told Raghavan
has killed her.

624
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,600
On our national emblem the
Ashoka Stupa, what we see is...

625
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,600
...we see three lions
facing different directions.

626
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,200
But there is one more lion hidden.
A 4th lion that is not seen by anyone.

627
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,400
What the truth is, it is the 4th lion.

628
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,200
No one is searching that
and finding it neither.

MC Movie Channel

631
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,100
I've not become a big
journalist like that.

632
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,200
By God's grace, it looks like
the thing has become a click.

633
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,800
Those who are calling
has got high opinion on it.

634
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,600
Shall I call you later?

635
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
You can write something and
all I'm the one to answer all this.

636
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,400
Right from morning the TV and
newspaperjournalists are calling...

637
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,300
masking who is he? Where is he
from? Why is he not yet released?

638
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,200
Again the call will
come from ministefs office.

639
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,100
Not that sir, all this channel people
will be calling, out of their curiosity.

640
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
I don't find much curiosity in this.

641
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm seeing this for a very long time.

642
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,300
What about our book?
Will it happen?

643
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm writing that sir.

644
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,300
Now understood what
you were writing.

645
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Not that sir, we will
start that immediately.

646
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,200
Sir, I have brought a copy for
Raghavan, can I give that?

647
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,900
Then let alone Chandraji...

648
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,900
Let him say.

649
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,300
I know it.

650
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Started the bating, no?

651
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,100
Then what you can
just hoist a party.

652
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
All this liquor these people
will have to drink and finish, no?

653
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,800
I went and met Sasi Kumar sir.

654
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,400
That is why got late.

655
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,800
Then what did sir say?

656
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,200
Sir really liked it, told it is marvelous.

657
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,400
Yes, it is marvelous.
It must be like this.

658
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,200
Here there are lot
of other kind of people.

These son of dogs think journalism
is escorting the ministers.

00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,200
Let them learn from her.
Your kind of presentation.

661
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,700
The language of it.

662
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,400
Chandraji, did you read it?

663
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:35,900
No.

664
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,200
Did you see it?

665
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,900

Chandraji, not
Ram achand ran , Rag havan.

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,600
Yes that is it, Raghavan.

668

Don't play Chandraji, it really hurts.

676
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,300
Look, do you know a
company named Green Orange?

677
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,400
That is a literary agency, no?

678
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:50,800
What is it?

679
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,800

Hey, you don't leave

After all this years,
don't you know Das?

00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,600
No Leopards will catch journalists.

689
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,600
Is it true?

690
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,500

Kariachan from Bangalore had called.

703
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,000
What is that which
you have written?

704
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,700
What is written is all big, big, mighty
things. Will tell and that aftenivards.

705
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,600
Only when this Kariachan
and Avarachan calls.

706
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,900
We are getting a value.

707
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,200
They had criticized a lot when
you were send to study all this.

708
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,600
This is not the one,
yet is about to come.

709
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,200
Let all that come.
First you come here.

710
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,300
How long it has been
since seen you?

711
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,300
Oh! This week it is not
possible. Next week will see.

712
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,000
While coming take that weekly also.

713
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,500
Can't you clean this place properly?

714
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,500
How is that? Now you are
a big star is it not?

715
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,900
The way some people writes, as
if I have tied you here by force.

716
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,100
You are not interested, no?

717
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,500
If you wanted you could
be released earlier itself, no?

718
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,100
That is not possible, told
several times is it not?

719
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,900
No!

720
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,900
To meet you only, TV people.

721
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,800
All that let them see once
you go out from here.

722
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,500
Think of the ways for that.

723
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,800
Again let me think it over.
Whether you are to be fed...

724
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,400
...in here on the
government's expense.

725
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,500
No need sir, where will
I go after going from here?

726
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,000
I don't have to know
all those things.

727
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,800
Again if you stay here
it will not be proper.

728
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,500
Go where ever you want.

729
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,500
Anjali, hope you have
not discussed with...

730
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
...any other agencies
and publishers?

731
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,400
No, no.

732
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,100
But we have one or two conditions.

733
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,200
We will be having a dead line.

734
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,600
That is very important.

735
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,800
The matter in this is really interesting.

736
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,200
But it is scattered.

737
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,100
It is mixed up here and there, no?

738
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,100
We will have to put
this into an order.

739
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,600
Then there is no volume
to make it into a book.

740
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,400
This is not enough.

741
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,100
All that we can make
Raghavan to write it.

742
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,600
But now what Raghavan
has to write is.

743
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,400
Not things like this.

744
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,200
Then what?

745
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,900
What Raghavan has to write is.

746
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,400
On his life.

747
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,600
In your article it is said that,
there are certain things...

748
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,500
...that is not revealed to anyone.

749
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,000
That is what he has to write.

750
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,000
That is what we need.

751
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,000
ThatAnjali, you must
make him write that.

752
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,200
Madam you were seen
on TV and all, okay.

753
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,700
Now only we are knowing this
Raghavan is such a big person.

754
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,000
Now for 24 hours he is
sitting and looking at that weekly.

755
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,900
TV people and all had
not come to cover him?

756
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,800
That is because sir didn't allow.

757
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,500
Raghava, must reach
there on time, okay.

758
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,200
Then did you read that?

759
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
It is English only, no?
Only saw the pictures.

760
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,900
Brother Raghavan,
became really famous okay.

761
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,700
Everyone is asking where
did you get a person like this?

762
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,600
Look, is there anything
bad written about sir, in that?

763
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,000
No what happened?

764
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,800
Sir, is really on a bad
temperament with me.

765
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,000
Told no need to stay here again,
going to release me and all.

766
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,200
That is a good thing is it not?

767
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,600
It has been several years in
here no? Come out boldly.

768
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,600
Then one more thing.

769
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,200
Whatever that is written
by brother Raghavan.

770
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,100
Putting all that together it is going
to come out as a book in English.

771
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,900
But will have to write some more.

772
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,700
In English?

773
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,700
You write it in Malayalam
I'll translate that into English.

774
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,300
For all that I'm not a
writer and all, no?

775
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,600
So what? All this was written
by brother Raghavan is it not?

776
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,100
You just write and give all that.

777
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
I will tell you later what
all things to be done.

778
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,200
Then shall I take leave?

779
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,800
Look..A lady came from Delhi saying
she is a journalist from a paper.

780
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,800
She has given this.

781
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,800
Priya Joseph.

782
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,000
When did she come?

783
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,900
Yesterday morning.

784
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,900
Why did she come?

785
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,700
Told something has to be discussed.

786
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,900
Next time when she
comes don't entertain her.

787
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,000
Like this many will come.

788
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,700
Look, told about that release, no?
Don't plead with superintendent...

789
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,100
msaying no need and all.

790
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,000
Let it go ahead on its course.

791
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,100
What is it? Are you scared?

792
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,300
Not because of fear
and all, where will I go?

793
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,100
Coming with me is
there anything wrong in that?

794
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,800
Not because of that, still...

795
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,200
We have to do lot of things, no?
Come out boldly.

796
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Even if no one is there,
I'm there, is it not?

797
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,800
MC Movie Channel

798
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
How come you are serious?

799
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,200
For the sister's daughtefs marriage.

800
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,100
On asking whether I can
go and come, answered, no.

801
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If it is own daughter, it seems
only then parole is allowed.

802
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,100
For that where will I go
and create a child?

803
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,300
For brother Raghavan, there
is no need of all that.

804
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,200
No need of parole or anything.

805
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,800
Happy to be in here.

806
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,400
Who said like that? I'm going.

807
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,200
Yes, I got the release.

808
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,700
Is that so?
Then where are you going?

809
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,400
That is all there.

810
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,200
What?

811
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,400
Yea, yea, I understood.

812
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,900
It is because, the photo
came in the magazine, no?

813
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,700
Shall I reduce the
thickness of the mustache?

814
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
No need let him be there itself.

815
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:10,100
MC Movie Channel

816
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,900
Why is that lowered now?

817
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,500
The AC is turned on.
Outside it is all dusty.

818
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,400
Why? Not recollecting anything?

819
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,900
No, everything has changed a lot.

820
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,400
That is like that, no?

821
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,200
Is the present brother Raghavan,
is he like how he was before?

822
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,400
Has completely changed, no?

823
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,500
Look, where are we going?

824
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,500
Will reach just now.

825
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Look, car is coming.

826
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,100
No, I will take it.

827
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,400
Which is this place?

828
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,400
Get in, get in.

829
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
How is it?

830
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Did you like the room and all?

831
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,400
Lot of amenities are there is it not?

832
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,600
How can it be without all that?

833
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,400
Don't just stand there holding
that bag. Keep it somewhere.

834
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,700
Look, the money that is
received from thejail is with me.

835
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,600
What to do with that?
Should I keep it or..

836
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,100
Keep that with you,
when required I'll ask.

837
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,100
Okay then.

838
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,100
Look, regarding the food
and all it is arranged.

839
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,100
From tomorrow morning
it will reach promptly.

840
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,100
No need to go out for that.

841
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,100
Look, for tonight it is there in this.

842
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,100
In jail also it is like this, the dinner
will be given in the evening itself.

843
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,700
Oh, its like that, no?

844
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Look, yesterday also people
of that book had called.

845
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,700
They are telling it
is required urgently.

846
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,200
We are running out of time okay.

847
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,700
If we work hard only we
will be able to finish it.

848
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,300
What is there in that no? There
is no other engagements, no?

849
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,000
Can simply sit and write is it not?

850
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,800
Look, there is enough paper
and pen that is required.

851
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,700
Regarding writing there is no
need of any stinginess required.

852
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,400
Keep on writing as you wish.

853
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,400
Not that on saying writing,
what should Iwrite, really?

854
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,500
Other day, brother Raghavan
has told me, is it not?

855
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,100
The truth cannot be
removed, it can be only hidden.

856
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,800
It is like light and all,
do you remember that?

857
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,700
I have not done any crime, that is
what brother is saying always, no?

858
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,100
If it is like that?
Who has done the crime?

859
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,500
Not that, if anyone has
trapped brother into this case.

860
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,100
Who is that?

861
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,000
If that is not the situation.

862
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,200
If it is like taking the blame
of the crime for someone else.

863
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,600
If it is like that, for whom it is taken?

864
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,800
The things like this.
Nothing of that sort.

865
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,400
Brother had not revealed
to anyone, so far.

866
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,100
Those things have to
be mentioned from now on.

867
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,100
When it is presented through
brother's language.

868
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,500
It will turn out to be stylish.

869
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,400
It is 20 years gone from the life.

870
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,700
That is gone, no?
Can you get it back?

871
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,400
For all this let ourjudiciary answer it.

872
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,000
So because of that write boldly.

873
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,700

MC Movie Channel

879
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,400
At night how was the sleep and all?

880
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,400
The sleep did not come.
It is a new place. No?

881
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
Sleep will search and come slowly.

882
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,700
Yes mother, I'm in an another place.

883
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,400
Yes I understood, the one which
was told yesterday, is it not?

884
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,500
I understood that.

885
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,300
I'll call you, there.

886
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,500
It is mother.

887
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,300
She wants to marry
me off immediately.

888
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,700
Who and all are there at home?

889
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Mother is there.
Brother is at Chennai.

890
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,300
Then there are lot of
cows, chickens and goats.

891
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,300
Is it possible to make
curd from goat's milk?

892
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,800
No nothing at all.

893
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,200
The goat is poor mens cow,
is it not? That is why asked.

894
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,800
Then brother Raghavan.

895
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,900
So from today onwards
can we start writing?

896
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,900
Then start right away. I need not
come and trouble you always.

897
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,400
Okay then.

898
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,600
Close the door, close the door!

899
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,800
I was about to call you.

900
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,200
How are the things going?

901
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,500
He has already started writing.

902
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,700
Must go ahead in this speed,
only then it will materialize.

903
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,900
Then, I'll let you know by the time
of contract and things like that.

904
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
You will have to come up to Mumbai.

905
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,000
Hey boy wait there.

906
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,300

You come here.

908
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,700

01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,700
Let me see you. Come here.

910
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,700
What is it?

911
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,700
Thinking for some time to catch you.

912
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,200
After hanging the cover on
the door where are you running?

913
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,700
I have got job at shop.

914
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,900
Well, what is your name?

915
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,600

916
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,300
The name is KP Anil Kumar.

917
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500

918
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,700
My name is CK Raghavan.

919
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,900
Where is your house?

920
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,700
I'm staying at the shop.

921
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,900
Hey boy just don't go
like that. Let me tell one thing.

922
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,900
Hey, I have got work at the shop.

923
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Yesterday's 'kadala curry'
how hot it was?

924
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,500
Some days it is like that.

925
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,100
My Anwar, it is not
possible at any cost.

926
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,000
When we see he is not going
to lose his virginity, no?

927
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,700
He is sitting there and
peacefully writing.

928
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,500
In the middle of that, it
is not possible to disturb.

929
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,900
Even I never used to go there.

930
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,600
Next time when you
go, will you take me?

931
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,100
For what?

932
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,700
Not that I have not seen a person
who has killed two people.

933
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,100
That is why.

934
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,500
Don't talk about the killings
and all in front of him. Okay.

935
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,800
My Mohanan tutor, will I say?
Don't I have fear on my life?

936
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,500
It's Anjali, no?

937
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,400
Yes sir.

938
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,900
What is happening
on my work?

939
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,000
Sir I'll come to the office.

940
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,900
If you can't write just say that.

941
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,600
For that you don't have to
take trouble on coming here.

942
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,400
Not that sir, since
I have got an urgent work.

943
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Umm..Where is Raghavan, now?

944
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,900
Sir, I don't know exactly.

945
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,900
Why is that?

946
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,100
Aren't you the person who
took him out from here?

947
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,400
Not that sir he told he wanted
to meet some relatives.

948
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,400
Oh! Is it? Now has he got
new relatives and all, now?

949
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,100
Okay, okay then.

950
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,100
Sleeping, no?

951
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
You keep it there.

952
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,000
What is it today?

953
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,800
'Puttu and Kadala'

954
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,800
Sir, don't you have any job?

955
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,000
I'm on leave for some time.

956
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,700
Here there is no TV, no?

957
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,000
It is there in our shop.

958
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,900
Whose picture is this?

959
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,600
This one.

960
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:10,800
Yes.

961
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,800
He is a big DYFI member.

962
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,500
Who is he?

963
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,800
He is the one who brings food here.

964
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,100
Hey boy he is a big writer
you must leave the place fast.

965
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,100
On giving the food.

966
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,200
Must not disturb sir.

967
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,200
I'm goir19-

968
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,600
How is the writing going?

969
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,600
After all these days, what is this?
Nothing is written!

970
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,800
That is..How to write"?

971
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,100
Where to start and all?

972
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,700
Brother Raghavan, start from
somewhere, is it enough?

973
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,000
We can do the minor changes
here and there, later no?

974
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,900
That will do, no?

975
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,900
Why not?

976
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,700
Then one more thing.

977
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,500
I'm going to Mumbai.

978
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,000
There is a meeting with
the people of our book.

979
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,900
I'll be the person who signs
the contract with them?

980
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,600
That is okay, is it not?

981
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,200
That is enough.

982
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,100
In that case just sign
and give on this paper.

983
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'll come back after some time only.

984
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,900
By the time, you will
write, won't you?

985
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,000
So can I go boldly?

986
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,200
Then, I wanted to say one thing.

987
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,700
What thing?

988
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,900
I wanted one, small good broom.

989
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:33,900
MC Movie Channel

990
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,100
Sir!

991
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,700
While you go, throw that waste.

992
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,800
You are writing story, is it?

993
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yes, what is it?

994
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,300
Is it for a movie?

995
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,800
Not for movie, for that sister?

996
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,000
If it is for a movie, I have
got an apt story.

997
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,000
When it comes out with
it, it will be super.

998
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,500
What if it doesn't come out?

999
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,000
All that we can bring out.

1000
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,900
Shall I tell?

1001
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,500
Tell.

1002
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,700
Shall I tell?

1003
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,100
Come on, tell boy.

1004
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,300
A big ship.

1005
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,900
On that, Mohanlal is
coming like that.

1006
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,600
It is night time okay.

1007
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,300
Mohanlal, is coming like this.

1008
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,800
All around candle is lighted.

1009
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,600
How is that fellow? In the wind the
candle's flame will die out, is it not?

1010
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,300
Then I'm not saying the story.

1011
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,000
I'm goir19-

1012
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,100
Hey fellow, tell the remaining
part and go. Hey fellow!

1013
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,600
Sit and write yourself.

1014
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,900
I have got work at the shop.

1015
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Hey fellow, take that
waste and go, okay.

MC Movie Channel

1017
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:58,300
Sir!

1018
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,800
No need of candle bulb will do.

1019
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,000
When it is bulb, Dulquer Salman is
more handsome than Mohanlal.

1020
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:04,800
Who is that?

1021
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,400
As if sir doesn't know him?

1022
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Anyway you go on telling.

1023
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,800
DulquerSalman, is coming like this.

1024
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,900
At that time. It is night okay.

1025
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,800
Dulquer Salman is coming like this.

1026
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,900
At that time a sister is
singing at the shore.

1027
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,400
Who is that? Is it Jaya Bharathi?

1028
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,100
Who is that?

1029
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,500
As if you don't know.

1030
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,100
Okay anyway that sister.

1031
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,300
That sister is singing.

1032
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,200
On hearing the song, Dulquer
Salman feels like crying.

1033
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,800
Is the song that bad?

1034
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,700
Leave it, tell, tell.

1035
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,300
Okay, then the Dulquer
Salman is crying like that.

1036
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,100
He has been crying
for a very long time.

1037
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,300
(No, that is because)

1038
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
It is at night, okay.

1039
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,800
Hey fellow, if it is night or day.
Your story has got a moral.

1040
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,300
Don't create a story
which is not there.

1041
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,500
Yes mother.

1042
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,400
I'm coming from the airport.

1043
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,100
Yea, the things got okay.
For which had gone.

1044
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,900
No, no one had called.

1045
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,800
Those who are coming
from America and all.

1046
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,200
Will not be having any sense.

1047
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,700
No problem, I will bear it.

1048
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,300
My mother, first let him
come from America.

1049
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,500
What is this?
Is it spring cleaning or what?

1050
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,700
No nothing like that, just
cleaning the cobwebs that's all.

1051
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,000
Keep the broom there and...

1052
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,500
...come and take this, with grace.

1053
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,100
This is a huge money indeed.

1054
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,400
That is the advance.

1055
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,500
Being jailed in the whole
life, will you get this much?

1056
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,600
In case of ladies longevity also
it is termed as men's life, is it not?

1057
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,100
I don't know all that.

1058
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,100
Shall I open an account
in the bank and deposit it?

1059
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,500
Okay, let it be.

1060
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,600
Where is all that
paper that was here?

1061
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,000
While cleaning I kept it, over here.

1062
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Not that, where is that
which you have written?

1063
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,100
I couldn't write.

1064
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,600
Had not written anything?

1065
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,200
I tried but..Those things
at that time, the place...

1066
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,300
...time, then some names.

1067
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,600
All getting mixed up.

1068
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,200
Nothing is working out properly.

1069
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,800
Brother if you really intend,
all this can be set right is it not?

1070
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,900
But for that we must
also put our mind into it.

1071
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,900
That is not because of that.

1072
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,300
To tell the truth.

1073
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,100
I'm really upset.

1074
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,400
On my arrival, I had expected
that something will be written.

1075
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,200
No..I was...

1076
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,500
Not out of anything else,
we don't have any time to waste.

1077
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,700
Had given the word, we will finish
it within the time, told by them.

1078
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,200
On which this agreement
is signed and...

1079
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,800
maccepted this
advance, everything.

1080
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,300
When did you come from Bombay?

1081
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,300
I thought you might have
left, through that way.

1082
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,100
That was better.

1083
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:19,600
Why?

1084
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,600
Brother, one black coffee.

1085
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,200
What is it? Tensed?

1086
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,500
Bit problematic.

1087
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,400
Our sir should write something, no?

1088
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,100
What? Not yet started?

1089
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,900
How can it be?

1090
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,600
I have come after signing the
contract and collecting the money.

1091
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,000
Must complete it within the time, no?

1092
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,000
My Anjali, if it were
some DC or Current Books...

1093
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,000
...we can say something.
These are big wicks!

1094
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,100
They will swallow you. You try to
make him write that, somehow.

1095
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,600
What is he saying?

1096
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,000
Saying will write, will write and all.

1097
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,600
Then what is the problem?

1098
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,600
What problem?

1099
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,600
Will get food four times a day.
There is a decent room to stay.

1100
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,500
Will that do?

1101
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,100
Not like that.

1102
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,100
What you must do is? You must
handle him more tactfully.

1103
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,500
Or else the plan will not work out.

1104
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,900
Brother Raghavan!

1105
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,900
Where did this person go?

1106
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,200
He might have gone for
some needs, to the down stairs.

1107
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,100
What need?

1108
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
There will be some requirement, no?

1109
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,900
What requirement?

1110
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,000
That boy over here, is he not here?

1111
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,100
He is on leave today.

1112
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:44,700
Not that...

1113
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,400
...that Raghavan sir staying up
stairs has he come here?

1114
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,200
He along with that boy
in here went outside.

1115
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,000
On seeing that boy, I had felt
its asking for trouble.

1116
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,700
He is the one spoiling him.

1117
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,700
Then what?

1118
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,700
That persons age is
right to get spoiled or what?

1119
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,600
You don't talk stupidity.

1120
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,400
I have told a hundred times
not to go out from that room.

1121
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,200
It has been few days no?
He has been lying in that room.

1122
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,000
Let him just go out and come.

1123
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,000
After a going out and
breathing some fresh air.

1124
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,300
That guy will be fresh.

1125
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,700
But still where might
have he gone anyway?

1126
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,900
Neither has he got any money
with him nor any place to go.

1127
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,900
He will return to this
place you wait and see.

1129
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,000
Sir, here.

1130
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,400
Hey boy, do you know earlier
there was a bridge over here?

1131
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Where is that now?

1132
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,400
That is what I'm also thinking.

1133
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,400
Some robbers might have taken it.

1134
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,000
Look, why don't we
have Sharjah shake?

1135
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,700
For that I don't have money with me.

1136
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,600
That is because sir has got no job,
no? I have got money with me.

1137
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,100
Not that, while writing this story,
won't you get any money?

1138
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,600
Oh!

1139
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,600
If it is for the movie, you will get it.

1140
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,200
Who has told you all this?

1141
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,600
That I saw it on the TV.

1142
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,400
Then we will go and drink Sharjah.

1143
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,400
Okay then.

1144
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,400
Hey fellow, in your story for the ship
to come, will this sea be enough?

1145
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,300
Oh! I changed that story.
Now it is Danush.

1146
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,300
Inside the church,
candles are lighted fully.

1147
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,500
That is enough, even if the
wind blows, it won't die out.

1148
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,700
Other day when I came here.
Over there shooting was going on.

1149
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
It is not like we thought

1150
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Hey! Where are you going?

1151
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,100
Hey, ourjuice shop is over there.
Come here.

1152
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,400
Wait there sir.

1153
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,100
Sir.

MC Movie Channel

1155
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,200
If it goes on like this, it
is not going to come out.

1156
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,900
Telling will write today.
Will write tomorrow.

1157
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,400
How many days it has been?

1158
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,400
Why? Not writing a single sentence.

1159
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,400
I know the issue.

1160
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,900
A laziness to start, nothing else.

1161
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,500
Do one thing.

1162
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,300
Brother you come and sit here.

1163
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,200
Come.

1164
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,800
Sit here.

1165
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,600
Sit!

1166
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Here hold this pen.

1167
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:01,400
By sitting here, if it is one sentence,
one sentence come on write.

1168
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,500
Only after you start
writing, I'll go from here.

1169
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,500
Why looking like this? Just start.

MC Movie Channel

1171
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,600
Sir!

1172
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,000
Today afternoon Biriyani, is there
if you want m ust tell now.

1173
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,500
Why is that? Don't you want?

1174
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,700
On the other day as
you said you want it.

1175
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,800
Why you are not talking anything?

1176
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,300
Must tell now whether
you want it or not.

1177
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,700
I have got work to do at the shop.

1178
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,500
My heavens!

1179
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,600
Fellow, wait there!

1180
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,700
Didn't I tell you just come and give
food? No other business is required.

1181
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,800
For that I have not done anything.

1182
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,900
Then, how come you called
sir and went out for roaming?

1183
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,700
Now on listen to what I say.

1184
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,600
Give food and quit the place!

1185
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,900
Then clear off!

1186
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,600
What's up?

1187
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,400
I'll write.

1188
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,700
Then just do it!

1189
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,400
But..

1190
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,100
What but?

1191
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,900
My brother Raghavan only
after getting something written...

1192
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
...only then I can start my job.

1193
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,900
All this must be translated
to English. Must do the editing.

1194
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,800
You know, like that what
all things to do.

1195
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,500
I need some more time.

1196
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,100
In between that...

1197
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,700
I must not come here and trouble
you, is it not what you mean?

1198
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,600
Okay..l will stop coming.

1199
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:05,900
Will make a try like that.

1200
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,400
But next time when I come.

1201
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,900
Must give me an assurance
that something will be written.

1202
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Then I will go.

MC Movie Channel

1204
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,400
Ah! Have you purchased
the new car and all?

1205
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,500
This is not a new
one, a second hand.

1206
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,900
What is happening with
the knee pain and all?

1207
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,600
Child only told no? Will
bring something to apply.

1208
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,800
Sorry about it.
On the next visit will bring.

1209
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
Lucky if my knee is
there till that long.

1210
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,500
Why are you not eating anything?

1211
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,600
Aren't you hungry?

1212
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,500
What had happened to you?

1213
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,400
Right from the moment
you came the face is scorn.

1214
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,200
Look here.

1215
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,800
What is it? Is it on discussing
about the marriage?

1216
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,100
Not because of all that.

1217
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,700
What is wrong with you?
Do you want any money?

1218
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,700
My mother tensions
on my profession.

1219
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Mother, won't understand
saying all that.

1220
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,100
If it is a job that worries
you, just resign thejob.

1221
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,600
It is peace of mind that is
of higher importance to people.

1222
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,900
This is the reason why
I'm not coming here.

1223
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,600
Will start on coming here.

1224
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,900
You don't have to go there urgently.

1225
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,000
On Friday it is our
molly's child's baptism.

1226
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,300
After attending all that, stay
here for few days...

1227
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,100
...and you return after
being a smart girl.

1228
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,800
After fulfilling his need,
he went on his way.

1229
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,500
I have planned to commit suicide.

1230
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,400
Then on thinking about the
matter of postmortem, got scared.

1231
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,400
I canceled it.

1232
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,100
When did sir return from Chennai?

1233
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,900
That was yesterday afternoon,
in the Indian Airlines..My God, sir!

1234
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,200
Have you been
waiting for some time?

1235
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,400
Sir, came just now only.

1236
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,400
Please take your seat.

1237
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,200
Ahjali!

1238
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,700
Why I told you to come is, other
day Rajeev Thomas had called.

1239
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,400
When he called Anjali, is
not picking up the phone.

1240
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,800
Told, has not replied
for the mail and all.

1241
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,200
For few days I was
at the native place.

1242
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,300
Even if you are at native place,
can attend the phone is it not?

1243
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,100
Have you not send that matter
which was committed to sent?

1244
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,900
That is..Sir..Raghavan's
language is all very strange.

1245
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,800
To translate that it is bit difficult.

1246
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,300
After correcting all that,
thought will send it.

1247
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,200
That is why.

1248
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,700
Anjali, when you deal with
corporates like these.

1249
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,700
We have to be very careful.

1250
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,100
For them these kind of
excuses are not applicable.

1251
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,100
From our side, if
there is contract violation.

1252
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,100
Then, their legal department
will be talking to us.

1253
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,300
Don't make the matters to
reach that stage and all.

1254
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,700
Nothing of that sort will happen, sir.

1255
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,200
Okay, I just told that. By the way.

1256
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,000
How is Raghavan, is he happy?

1257
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,800
Yes sir.

1258
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,200
He is really involved on the work.

1259
01:22:55,700 --> 01:23:00,700
MC Movie Channel

1260
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,700
Are you that CK Raghavan
which came on magazines?

1261
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,700
Got released is it not?

1262
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:56,800
I had read it.

1263
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,700
Really lucky on seeing you.

1264
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,200
Can you just spare five minutes?
Will have a cup of tea and go.

1265
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,400
No, no I must go.

1266
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,800
Right after reading
it, wanted to meet you.

1267
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,900
This was never expected, okay.

1268
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,300
Just five minutes, will
sit and have tea.

1269
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,300
Will call an auto.

1270
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,300
Auto, auto, stop, stop.

1271
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,200
Sir please come.

1272
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,400
Please come sir.

1273
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,800
Get in, get in.

1274
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,400
Take the vehicle to
the ancestral home.

1275
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,300
Sir, you may sit, see how lucky I'm?

1276
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,200
Go, go!

1277
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,300
Sir, you come.

1278
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
Did you recognize this person?

1279
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,800
My heavens! Where are
you from, now? Come, sit!

1280
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:36,500
Come, sit!

1281
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,800
They are all my friends.

1282
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,300
Sir, sit.

1283
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,500
Please sit.

1284
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,800
I have read that it is really
a rocking stuff, okay.

1285
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,000
It is really great.

1286
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,200
Sir, what must we order?

1287
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:47,700
Brother.

1288
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,700
I don't need anything.

1289
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,100
Don't say like that.

1290
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,400
For our happiness.

1291
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,400
At least one beer.

1292
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,000
I don't drink beer and all, rum will do.

1293
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,200
That will do.

1294
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,400
One JK Pint.

1295
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,200
Will it be possible to
get some cashew nuts?

1296
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:00,800
Yea!

1297
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,500
Brother, one packet cashew nut.

1298
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,900
This jail and all, is a different
experience is it not?

1299
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,000
You are feeling like that
because you are outside.

1300
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,200
When you get time, get jailed
for some time and see it.

1301
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,300
My heavens! No, no need
thinking of it, itself scares me.

1302
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,200
Have you written
before going to jail?

1303
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,300
This so called writing, is not
a part of jailed punishment.

1304
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,000
Being able to write is
a great blessing of God.

1305
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
I have tried several times.

1306
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,400
But nothing will come out.

1307
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,400
As a light food, shall I
order one chilly chicken?

1308
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,500
No, no need.

1309
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,500
There in the jail will get
face book, is it not?

1310
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,900
Will get all kind of books, there.

1311
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Is it so?

1312
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,000
Doesn't he drink?

1313
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,400
My sir, he was a hard core drinker.

1314
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,400
Now after marriage
everything stopped.

1315
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,800
Afraid of wife.

1316
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,100
So, that is the thing, is it?

1317
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,500
No, not because of that.

1318
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,500
Thinking not to create
an issue in the family...

1319
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,300
...for the time being, stopped.

1320
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,900
A life filled with fear,
it is really boring.

1321
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,400
That will destroy our freedom.

1322
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,500
No matter if it is male or female,
should not succumb to that.

1323
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,400
Then what about all this years,
being jailed, without any freedom?

1324
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,400
This is the problem?

1325
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,900
The thing is, how we
interpret freedom.

1326
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,600
Your freedom what you see,
may not be my freedom.

1327
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,100
Certain things which come
as a hindrance...

1328
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,300
...at times we will have to
pluck it out and throw...!

1329
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,500
That is what is meant
by freedom, is it not?

1330
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,300
If it happens in the
family it is family quarrel.

1331
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,400
If it happens in the
society it is revolution.

1332
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,600
Even if it is in Cuba or in family...

1333
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,400
...whenever a
revolution takes place...

1334
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,100
Blood will be shed...!

1335
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,500
So all those things which
stood as a hindrance to sir...

1336
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,300
That is plucked off
and thrown, is it not?

1337
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,400
Did not...Understand?

1338
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,200
No, that is...

1339
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:58,000
That is..Those two were killed,
is it not? That what he is saying.

1340
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,200
Who killed?

1341
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,400
Did you see it?

1342
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,900
Did anyone see it?

1343
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,400
Don't talk about the things
which is not known to you.

1344
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,800
I have not killed anyone.

1345
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,400
Sir..Raghavan sir!

1346
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,100
Let me say one thing, sir.

1347
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,000
Sir, please don't go.

1348
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,600
Don't come here, stay there!

1349
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:25,100
MC Movie Channel

1350
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,000
Brother Raghavan!

1351
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,300
Brother Raghavan!

1352
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,300
Now she wants only that Raghavan.

1353
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,100
Since she is your
contact, that is why...

1354
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,600
...it is not that, I don't know
how to deal with her.

1355
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,600
You just relax, we
will find out a solution.

1356
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,800
If no other job is obtained,
then will become ajournalist.

1357
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,400
There are lot of girls with
that kind of attitude.

1358
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,500
She and all, will be one
among such of breed.

1359
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,800
What was thatAnjali said,
in which journalism school...

1360
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,200
...have you studied?

1361
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,500
What is it sir?

1362
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,600
There, it seems no has taught
you, what is professional ethics.

1363
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,500
On undertaking a work,
must learn to complete it.

1364
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,100
Not that, on seeing
something bigger than that.

1365
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,100
Shouldn't go after that,
that is not what you must do!

1366
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,700
No sir, I'll do that.

1367
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,500
It is better you do that!

1368
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,300
Othenlvise it is police men no?
They will do it.

1369
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,500
I don't like the theory of
annihilation, right from beginning

1370
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,500
It doesn't mean
that I'm not political

1371
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,400
I, know that

1372
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,600
I'm a violent Gandhian
and a non violent naxalite

1373
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,400
Actually this 'Nehruvian'...

1374
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:17,600
Yes!

1375
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,400
This Anjali Arakkal.

1376
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,600
Came to see Anjali.

1377
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,400
Is she here?

1378
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,500
Then where did I stop?

1379
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,800
Ho! To find this place, really
struggled a lot, you know.

1380
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,300
On the outside, there is
not even a board, kept.

1381
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,900
My heavens! Didn't you recognize
me? Didn't mother tell you?

1382
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,800
Chakkochan, one
who is in America.

1383
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,300
I, felt so.

1384
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,300
Yea, yea that is it.

1385
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,700
This place is cool!
What is going on in here?

1386
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,500
Is it a tea shop or a toddy shop?

1387
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,300
Everything is here. This is a
meeting place of we, journalists.

1388
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,400
An adjustment set up, is it not?

1389
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,400
If the meeting were in some ice
cream parlor or some coffee shop...

1390
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,800
...it would have been
very conventional like.

1391
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:11,700
Anyway it is really good the right
am bience to see the bride.

1392
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,200
Shall I order a coffee?

1393
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,700
I don't drink coffee or tea.

1394
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,300
Oh! My dear uncle, we were
discussing some family matters.

1395
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,900
After this I'll come to you.

1396
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,100
Which is this guy?

1397
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,300
Chandraji.

1398
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,900
An old Delhi journalist.

1399
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,700
Will start right from
morning itself, no?

1400
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Oh! He is like that.

1401
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,300
Now doesn't he have any job?

1402
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,600
All this is thejob.

1403
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,800
Good, should be like this.

1404
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
On the 50th birth day..I'll
also resign my job and...

1405
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,500
...like this will start boozing
right from morning.

1406
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,200
Won't go for any job, is it not best?

1407
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,700
What are you doing in America?

1408
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,900
Scientist at 'NASA'.
That was the plan

1409
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,700
Since I was not that brainy,
joined an IT company.

1410
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,400
How long you will be here?

1411
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,000
I'll go back only on 22nd.

1412
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,700
Before that should fix
someone is it not?

1413
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,800
I won't stand to fix
someone, like that.

1414
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,300
We also have our own
conditions, is it not?

1415
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,000
Financially sound back ground.

1416
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,000
Should make good fish curry.

1417
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,300
Should not refrain
from Sunday Holy Mass.

1418
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,800
Aren't these the conditions?

1419
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,300
Nothing of this sort.

1420
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,800
I'm a guy who just goes on in a flow.

1421
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:25,000
On that flow, must have a
companion, in perfect tune.

1422
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,000
Along with that, if there
is some amount of brain...

1423
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:29,300
...life will go on like that
without much problems.

1424
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,300
Those people with 'money and
'charismatic'. I will be trapped.

1425
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,000
Among this in which
one does I, belong?

1426
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,900
On asking in which one.

1427
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
There is a girl like this,
her name is Anjali.

1428
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,500
Telling she is a journalist,
when a proposal came like this.

1429
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,900
I checked that profile.

1430
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,400
Felt, the candidate
is good, then thought will...

1431
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,300
...directly see the candidate.

1432
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,300
At that time only, I, saw
your article on CK Raghavan.

1433
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,800
This Raghavan is a
deadly person, okay!

1434
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,600
Then which is the next
writing assignment?

1435
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,900
That is about that Raghavan only.

1436
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,500
Has not left him, so far?

1437
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,500
The CK Raghavan, what you
read, he is going to tell his real story.

1438
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,400
Sometimes people will get shocked.

1439
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,100
So when the book get published,
will become famous, is it not?

1440
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,700
That might happen some times.

1441
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,600
One minute okay.

1442
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,900
Do we have to sit here and talk or...?

1443
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,800
...do we have to go out?

1444
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,000
Can sit here, can't we?

1445
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,900
Now the situation is, there
is no possibility to contact you.

1446
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,000
That is the reason why,
I had to come here directly.

1447
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,100
Or...

1448
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,600
...have you decided to work
for some other publishers?

1449
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,700
In India, about ten prisoners who
are jailed in different parts, a book...

1450
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,400
...is planned by 'Black Bird'.

1451
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,100
On their book, the first chapter...

1452
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,600
...do you know about whom it is?

1453
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,000
About your Raghavan!

1454
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,500
A Malayalee only.

1455
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,600
She is trying to contact Raghavan.

1456
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:48,600
That won't happen!

1457
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,000
The problem is not
solved because of that.

1458
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,000
You have not submitted
anything that is written, so far.

1459
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,900
See..l will do that immediately.

1460
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,700
You have been saying the
same thing for some time now.

1461
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,400
Now there are only few more days.

1462
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,800
If you are not able to complete
this within that period.

1463
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,100
Don't you know?

1464
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:15,900
MC Movie Channel

1465
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,700
That person has left in a hot temper.

1466
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,000
Is it a case of giving beating?

1467
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,900
That is because of the book's time...

1468
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:10,900
Look.

1469
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,500
When two people talk.
To over hear that...

1470
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,800
...I know it is not
a good act of doing.

1471
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,700
But an un necessary curiosity.

1472
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,700
That is why attended to that.

1473
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,700
If you don't take it as an
advice, I'll tell you one thing.

1474
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,700
There is a lesson
learned from my life.

1475
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,000
Doing certain things that
will give us happiness...

1476
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,600
...then we can easily
live and go on like that.

1477
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,500
On taking un necessary
burdens on the head.

1478
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,900
The mind, the body, everything
will be..Sick like that.

1479
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,000
So when feeling not
needed, just leave it.

1480
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,800
The rest of the things we will see.

1481
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,200
Why not take one?

1482
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,000
First let it be 50 years old.

1483
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,900
Then will start from the morning.

1484
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,200
That is enough, is it not?

1485
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,100
That is enough.

1486
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,600
Then shall we fix?

1487
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,500
Okay fix it.

1488
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
This is our character.

1489
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,300
Just read and see, have written a lot.

1490
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,200
Nothing wrong with the pen and all.

1491
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,300
So that is not the issue.

1492
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:49,000
Then shall we shift to
a better room, with AC and all?

1493
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:51,800
Ahjali!

1494
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,300
I'm the one who has
signed the contract.

1495
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,900
If it doesn't take place, I'm the
one who is answerable for that.

1496
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,300
You may not be scared
of court or jail.

1497
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,000
I'm little scared, that is why saying.

1498
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,600
The previous day when I
came here, what did you say?

1499
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,900
My presence is the problem.
When I go, will write. Is it not?

1500
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,800
Then have written fully, is it not?

1501
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,100
Now..I'm going to sit here.

1502
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,100
I'm going after making you to write.

1503
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,600
MC Movie Channel

1504
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,000
I don't want anyone
standing as a guard.

1505
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,600
You are a person more
accustomed to that, aren't you?

1506
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,100
Anjali, enough. Stop it!

1507
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,000
Do you know how many
days are left, again?

1508
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,200
Only 1 days!

1509
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,800
It is said that, within six days
the earth was created...

1510
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,400
...on the seventh day it was rest.

1511
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,000
So because of that, if at
all intended there is time.

1512
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,200
For that I'm not God, no?

1513
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,400
We will think and decide
whether it is God or Devil!

1514
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,700
Anjali, you please come here!

1515
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,400
Let me talk.

1516
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,700
For the time being this
much talk is enough.

1517
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,000
Leave. Let me tell.

1518
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,800
There is no use of telling this person.

1519
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:04,900
A shameless person.

1520
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,900
You go downstairs and sit. I'll come.

1521
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,000
Look.

1522
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,900
She is really tensed.

1523
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,800
That is why like this and all.

1524
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,000
Don't feel bad, okay.

1525
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,100
There is again one more week, no?

1526
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,800
If brother takes effort, can do it.

1527
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,600
This is not a novel and all, no?

1528
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,100
It is all known things, is it not?

1529
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,400
Just start, we can all
together make it fine.

1530
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:33,300
That will happen for sure.

1531
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,800
How harsh have you
talked with him?

1532
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,400
While talking like this, won't it
deplete his remaining confidence?

1533
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,700
Then what else should I do? Do I
have to go and catch his leg?

1534
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,200
Or should I go and tell sorry.
That can be also done.

1535
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,000
It is my requirement, is it not?

1536
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,100
A person who is not
interested to come out ofjail.

1537
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,600
Calling and then locked
up in an another jail!

1538
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,800
And then pressurize
him telling write, write.

1539
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,300
Is it some kind of a job like
ploughing or chopping a tree?

1540
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,700
He is a thinker and a creative guy it
is, you who have written it, is it not?

1541
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,300
A person of that nature, to
the mental state of such a person...

1542
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,000
...must show a minimum respect.

1543
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,500
Not that saying, contract,
dead line showing...

1544
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,400
...a harsh behavior of yours.

1545
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,300
That is too bad!

1546
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,200
Where are you now?

1547
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,400
I'm there at the flat.

1548
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,100
What is it?

1549
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,400
Look, enquiring where is
Raghavan, where is Anjali?

1550
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,500
One girl from Delhi
is roaming out here.

1551
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,000
Who is it?

1552
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,200
Is it Priya Joseph?

1553
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,500
I have not asked whether
it is Joseph or Jacob?

1554
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,800
The name is Priya.

1555
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,000
Look, that is the room.

1556
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,400
Raghavan did you recognize me?

1557
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,100
It has been two days
on reaching here...

1558
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,000
...today only found outthe place.

1559
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,100
Bigger than jail, security over here.

1560
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,300
On coming out, there is
no peace, is it not?

1561
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,300
How far is writing going?

1562
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,600
No..Problem.

1563
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Are you sitting here and writing?

1564
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,800
I don't go out like that.

1565
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,600
Must go out and all. Is it
only sitting inside this place?

1566
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:01,000
Other day, who came to meet
at the jail...This is the person.

1567
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,500
Why are you here?

1568
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,100
I came to meet Raghavan.

1569
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,000
For what?

1570
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,000
Why is a journalist
meeting a person?

1571
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,300
For that only.

1572
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,000
No need of that.

1573
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,200
That has to be decided
by Raghavan, no?

1574
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,900
For the time being it is not
Raghavan, I'm the one deciding.

1575
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,600
You must leave this place, please.

1576
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,100
Okay Raghavan we will meet later.

1577
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,200
Why did she come?

1578
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,900
I don't know why.

1579
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,200
Asked how far is the writing going?

1580
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,800
Then, what did you say?

1581
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,100
Did you say wrote or
did you say not written?

1582
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,100
I didn't say anything.

1583
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,400
The way you talk, will feel like
I'm the one who told her the place.

1584
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,900
Did I say like that?

1585
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,500
Anyway it has become like an 'inn'.

1586
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,500
Anyone can come and go.

1587
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,400
Again he can't be lodged there.

1588
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,400
Must shift to some
other vacant place.

1589
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,700
Now, is there any need for all that?

1590
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,200
It is required.

1592
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,200
Here food and all you will
have to make by yourself.

1593
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,000
There is no one to bring it and all.

1594
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,600
When should I come again?

1595
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,200
Can come any time.

1596
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Again, only three more
days are left, is it not?

1597
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,100
What should I do now?

1598
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:40,200
Sir..On talking to Rajeev Thomas.

1599
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:42,500
If that date is extended
it would be great.

1600
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,300
What was the date told by them?

1601
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,100
Only two more days left.

1602
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,400
I'll try talking to them.

1603
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,600
How many days should I ask?

1604
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,300
That is, like 10 days.

1605
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,500
Can give within 10 days is it not?

1606
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,800
Yes. Can give sir.

1607
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,800
Till now how many
chapters have you send?

1608
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,700
That is...Nothing is send sir.

1609
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,700
Why is that?
Can't you send what is written?

1610
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,600
Raghavan..Has not
written anything sir!

1611
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,300
What? So far nothing is written!

1612
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,700
It was not like this, what
you told me earlier.

1613
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,700
What have you thought about me?

1614
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,300
For this kind of irresponsible acts...

1615
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,700
...do you think I'm a
person who supports?

1616
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,500
For this I don't have
the time to waste.

MC Movie Channel

1618
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:01,300
Tomorrow is the last day.

1619
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,700
I know miracles are
not going to happen.

1620
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,700
Do you have any
doubts on that?

1621
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,300
Can you hear?

1622
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,600
Ummm..Yes.

1623
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,600
Speak on.

1624
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,800
What more to say?

1625
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,500
There is no other solution, no?
Then we will meet at the court, no?

1626
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,700
Where are you?

1627
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,600
I'm out to go to a place.

1628
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,200
I have reached at the air port okay.

1629
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,400
The flight is delayed for two hours.

1630
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,200
If sir is free, come over here.

1631
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,900
We will have a cup of tea and talk.
What do you say?

1632
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,100
I must meet a person
and solve a small thing.

1633
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:01,200
After settling that
I'll come over there.

1634
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,300
If it is a whacking
case, just tell okay.

1635
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,500
No, it is that Raghavan's case.

1636
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,900
I dropped that, why
simply taking the burden.

1637
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,600
So, learned the things and all.

1638
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,700
Then in that case, we will write
on Raghavafls at American.

1639
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,700
What you say?

1640
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,400
So won't you come fast, over here?

1641
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,900
Why not? Will reach fast.

1642
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,700
Then come fast. I'll wait.

1643
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,800
I expected you yesterday.

1644
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:52,300
For not coming, there
was no problem, is it?

1645
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,300
Here, your money.

1646
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,800
What is the use of money to me?

1647
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,700
This is the wages to
you, for being in jail.

1648
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,600
That you, yourself keep it.

1649
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,900
Here, this one your great literature.

1650
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:05,400
This one also, you keep it with you.

1651
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,900
Now there is nothing left between
us to discuss and to do. Is it?

1652
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,900
What do you want again?

1653
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,300
Where do you want to go?

1654
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,300
If at all any where to go, I'll drop.

1655
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,700
Decide whatever it is.

1656
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,500
What are you fooling people?

1657
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,600
Basically you are a cheat.

1658
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:33,000
All these years what you
told, is it not a lie?

1659
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,500
Always saying, I have not
killed, I have not killed.

1660
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,000
Aren't you scared to tell the truth,
is it not, why you are not writing?

1661
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Why are you standing,
without talking?

1662
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
You have nothing to say.

1663
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,300
That is it.

1664
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,800
The time is going to finish, is it not?

1665
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:52,700
You leave all that.
Tell where you want to go?

1666
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,800
I don't have time. If you
are leaving, then leave.

1667
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,600
Go where ever you want.

1668
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,600
Before going just read this and see.

1669
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:20,100
Has written what
ever that is needed.

1670
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,600
I have decided where to go.

1671
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm going back to jail.
