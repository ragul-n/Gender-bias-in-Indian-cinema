1
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,360
'MOURYA,
NOBODY CAN DEFEAT HIM'

2
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I need you to sign here.

3
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Keep this inside.

4
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,680
Sir.. - Hey!
- Please, don't hit me!

5
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,520
Did you think we wouldn't find you
if you run away?

6
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
I'll cut you to pieces.

7
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll repay it, sir..
- Hey!

8
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,920
Repay.. - I'll return your money.
- Did you think you could get away?

9
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,960
We know what would make you
return the money. Get in! - Sir..

10
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,140
Is it what you want?

11
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,280
I found a groom for my daughter.
I don't have enough money.

12
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Even a basic wedding and feast
is costing me Rs. 50,000.

13
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
I don't have any other option
but to borrow money on interest.

14
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,480
You are borrowing money
as you are in need.

15
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
If you don't repay it

16
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,960
you won't be able
to tolerate their torture.

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,960
I'll repay it, sir.
- You think that's easy.

18
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,600
They are not as soft as you think.
They are demons.

19
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,200
Put your thumb print here.

20
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
I have never seen anyone

21
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,400
repaying the entire amount
and walking away with the document.

22
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,640
Sir, my husband ran left us alone,
you know that too.

23
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,440
So, I must take care of her future.

24
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,680
I can't bear it

25
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,840
if she follows her dad's
footsteps.

26
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
My daughter must live happily.

27
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Naidu, do you know her?

28
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Yes.
- Yes.. - Oh!

29
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
Hey, give me that money.

30
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
Quick!

31
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,840
Here, take this.

32
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,720
One, two, three, four, five, six..
- Hey!

33
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
What are you counting for?
- ...ten, eleven.

34
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,440
It is Rs. 12,500.
You can take it.

35
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,920
Sir, I asked for Rs. 25,000.

36
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
This is a lot less than that.

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Hey, give me that money.

38
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,160
Give it back now!

39
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Oh.. - Hey, how much do you need?
- You may give as you wish.

40
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
Sir, please forgive me.

41
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
My daughter's wedding
depends on this money.

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,200
I made a mistake. You may charge
any interest that you like.

43
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Give me the money, sir..
- Hey!

44
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
Sir!
- I heard everything..

45
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,820
I am here. Don't worry.
- Look at what he is doing.

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,500
You want money for your
daughter's wedding?

47
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,260
Hey!

48
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Order a gold nuptial chain and send
it to her. Did you understand?

49
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,660
Don't be scared. As long
as I am here, I'll help you.

50
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,140
Don't worry. Bye..

51
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,620
Just pay the interest on time.

52
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,100
I will see you, sir.

53
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,380
'What a heartless man!'

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,940
'You are throwing gold
as a bait to loot her.'

55
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,360
Hey!

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,760
What is this?

57
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,820
What is this?
- I'll repay you as soon as I can.

58
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,940
This month was difficult.

59
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,000
Else I would have paid.

60
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,280
I'm working.
Please leave me, sir.

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,620
You're working?

62
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,340
You think we're
scared of the police?

63
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,020
I am going to strangle you.

64
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,340
Sir! Oh, no!
Mr. Soori is coming.

65
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,820
Please ask him not to come.
I'll find a way to repay you.

66
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,580
Sir, please tell him. I'll repay it
once I get my salary. Sir..

67
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,520
The garbage
is spilling on the road.

68
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,580
I'll repay it, sir.
- Where is the money..

69
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,140
I'll repay it, sir..

70
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,340
You expect me to spare you
because you're a policeman?

71
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,500
Sir, I'll find a way to pay you.
- When will you do it?

72
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,960
Soori, is there any problem?
- Greetings, sir.

73
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,440
It's nothing.. You carry on..
I'll see you later. - Let's go!

74
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,560
Hey, what did I say
when I gave you the money?

75
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,680
Didn't I tell you to pay
the interests on time?

76
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
What an atrocity!

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
They are thrashing a traffic
constable in front of a minister.

78
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,760
We are low-grade workers,
they won't hesitate to kill us.

79
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,880
Make sure you secure the thrash
properly, it might fall on them.

80
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh, God!

81
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,920
Sulla..
- Sulla..

82
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,600
Hey, you can't run away!
This is a competition.

83
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,200
You can't quit in the middle of it,
wait until it's over.

84
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,280
Don't make me do it,
he looks furious.

85
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,880
He already told you that for ten
hits, he will hit you just once.

86
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,320
Face it and leave if you can.
- Look, he might bash me up.

87
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Hey! You can't say that now.

88
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,160
You should've thought about it
before accepting the challenge.

89
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,620
Did he restrict or resist
when you were hitting him?

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
Did he have preferences
as to what he wanted to fall into?

91
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,640
He kept his mouth shut
and took all your beating.

92
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
Now it's his turn. You must
do the same. Hey, come on!

93
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

94
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,560
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

95
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,600
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

96
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

97
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,340
One.

98
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Two.

99
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,660
Three.

100
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,260
Four, five.

101
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,180
Six, seven.

102
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,180
Eight.

103
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,140
Head is the strongest among
all the parts of the body.

104
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,160
Why would I hit elsewhere?

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,520
Be it anybody, one punch
is enough to make them dizzy.

106
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Now I am marking my spot.

107
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Oh, God!

108
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Did Sulla hit you?
- Yes.

109
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
He would have told you, isn't it?

110
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,760
Once he hits, all the craziness

111
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,360
shoots up right into your head

112
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
and makes you feel
like you are dying.

113
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
And then?
- Nothing much

114
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,360
I will massage the damaged area

115
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,080
with steamed oil and
give you relief.

116
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,700
He might look thin

117
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,420
but his punches are..

118
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,780
Here, swallow this
and apply this over your forehead.

119
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,080
He seems to have taken up
bashing people as a job.

120
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,600
Where is he now?

121
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,360
"A rooster is known
for its fight."

122
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,640
"A lion is known
for its ferociousness."

123
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,440
"Sulla is known for his punches.
Come on, whistle along!"

124
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,960
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

125
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,160
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

126
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,200
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

127
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,200
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

128
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,920
"A rooster is known
for its fight."

129
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
"A lion is known
for its ferociousness."

130
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,440
"Sulla is known for his punches.
Come on, whistle along!"

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

132
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,760
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

133
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,800
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

134
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

135
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,640
"Don't drive faster on bad roads."

136
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,600
"Don't underestimate
the banana peel and step on it."

137
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,680
"Don't."

138
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,600
"Don't."

139
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,960
"Don't underestimate my power."

140
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,760
"Don't boast about yourself.
- Don't."

141
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
"Don't."

142
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,560
"A small matchstick has the power
to burn a whole hut."

143
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,600
"A small matchstick has the power
to burn a whole hut."

144
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,680
"I can give you fun
like the giant wheel."

145
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,560
"I'll surround you like the
divine discus of Lord Vishnu."

146
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,200
"Sulla is known for his punches.
Come on, whistle along!"

147
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,840
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

148
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,880
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

149
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

150
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

151
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,800
"You will have no peace of mind
if you are wealthy."

152
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,040
"Though I'm poor, I'm happy."

153
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,040
"Don't see the garbage
outside in the society."

154
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,360
"Look into the clean hearts
of the humans."

155
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,680
"It feels like heaven
if we have people who love us."

156
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,640
"It feels like heaven
if we have people who love us."

157
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,400
"If I bash you,
you will get a sprain."

158
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,440
"I am the only one
who can cure it."

159
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,880
"Sulla is known for his punches.
Come on, whistle along!"

160
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,720
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

161
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,720
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

162
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,840
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

163
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,760
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

164
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,720
"A rooster is known
for its fight."

165
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,000
"A lion is known
for its ferociousness."

166
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,840
"Sulla is known for his punches.
Come on, whistle along!"

167
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,320
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

168
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,440
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

169
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

170
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,960
"Hey, Sulla! Come on."

171
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,180
Hey, you combed you hair all this
while. Why did you mess it up?

172
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,600
That is a style!

173
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,740
Do you think you are very handsome?
- Hey, don't say that.

174
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,300
If the neighbouring girl
hears this, she will tease me.

175
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,180
Hey, Sulla. - You!
- Have breakfast and go.

176
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,740
Hello. What is for breakfast?

177
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,660
Here, have this.

178
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,140
Can't you prepare
an omelette with this?

179
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Of course, I can!
As if your dad is earning a lot.

180
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,380
Why is this stinking?

181
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,580
Did you mix poison in my food
because you can't tolerate me?

182
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,540
I have been wishing for it,
but I doubt your mom would do that.

183
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,180
There's nothing wrong in it.

184
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,820
I can dump your body in my lorry
and burn you with all the trash.

185
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,860
Here he comes, now I know
where the stink is coming from.

186
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,660
I should be blaming you.

187
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,220
Pamper him, give him food and he
is never going to fend for himself.

188
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,700
Where is he?

189
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,980
Hey, you look so skinny.
How dare you threaten people!

190
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,060
You take ten hits and hit
them back once, isn't it?

191
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,740
I'll beat you with slippers till it
breaks. - I'll buy you a new one.

192
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,420
Hey, someday you are going
to end up in a huge mess.

193
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,780
Do you think I am some weakling?

194
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm fast and smart.
- Hey, shut your mouth!

195
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,740
Oh, God!
What kind of a family is this!

196
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,860
Ask her how to eat
with my mouth shut.

197
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,340
Hey, how are even able to eat?
- Oh, God!

198
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,940
Please let me eat peacefully.

199
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,820
Look at the way he is sitting,
like one of those beggars.

200
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,500
Get up! He is not going
to pay heed to my words.

201
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,580
What are you looking at?

202
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,100
This is such a good omen!

203
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,220
Lakshmi..

204
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Come in, why are you
still standing there?

205
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,220
She is shy.
- Come in.

206
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,460
I managed to find a groom for her,
here is the invitation.

207
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,620
Stay blessed, dear.

208
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,460
Sundari, you have dressed up well.

209
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,460
Is there something special again?
- Get out, you idiot! - Oh, my!

210
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,460
You have a lovely son!

211
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,700
Sir, don't get angry. They are
friends, so, he teases her.

212
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,380
I wanted to take a picture of her
before she leaves for her in-law's.

213
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,740
Sundari, you mom sacrificed
a lot to bring you up.

214
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,900
You mean everything to her.

215
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,180
I know the hardships
that parents go through

216
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,460
to get their daughter married.

217
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,300
Dad, I'm leaving.

218
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,740
Ma'am, good morning.
- Good morning.

219
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,780
Kalpana.. Give me Rs. 50.

220
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,940
Why?
- For your marriage.

221
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,060
Don't ask such questions. Actor
Rajinikanth's film has released.

222
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,420
Please..

223
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,620
I have money left
only for the bus pass.

224
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,780
I can steal it from dad
and give you tomorrow.

225
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,140
Thanks to my sister
who gave me Rs. 50!

226
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
"Oh, my God!
I have seen the girl."

227
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,940
"Looking fine and fit. Let me
praise the God." - What is it?

228
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,460
"Now let me follow you
wherever you go."

229
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,020
"Want to look at that
damn with so love!"

230
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,780
"Now let me get the
things all right. Girl!"

231
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,580
"Your body is so light and tight."

232
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,460
"Got to move it.."

233
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,940
"I just want to do it.."
- What, mister?

234
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Oh! I'm sorry.

235
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,140
"Oh, beauty!
Your gait is mesmerising!"

236
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,220
"Why is this.."

237
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,300
Hey, look. An angel is standing
at the bus stop.

238
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,100
The bus stop itself
is starting to look good.

239
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,760
Why are you all looking at me?

240
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,600
What's your intention?

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What will you do?

242
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,180
Oh, God!

243
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,420
Are you all going to rag me?

244
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Though we see many girls, it is
good to see such a traditional one.

245
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,460
It is beautiful to see you
walking in this attire.

246
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,280
The rose in your hair
reminds me of actress Sridevi

247
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
in the film 'Premabhishekam'.
Wow!

248
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,400
Do you all like my dress
and this rose?

249
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,920
My dad bought these.

250
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,120
Your dad has a good choice.
It is very nice.

251
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Thank you very much.

252
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,360
Don't look at me like that.
I feel very shy.

253
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,360
Oh, God!
Her sweet words are killing me.

254
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,680
Can you please hold this?
- Why?

255
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Please hold this.

256
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,280
Aren't you able to leave
this dress and go? - No.

257
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,400
Do you really like it that much?
- Yes.

258
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,640
Let me come through.

259
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Rita, can't you give me a seat
in your quota?

260
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,880
Hello, forget about it for now.
Dance like actor Rajinikanth.

261
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,840
Here?
- Yes. - Yes.

262
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Hey, Buddy!
- Yes! - Come on.

263
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,160
Go on..

264
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,940
"Oh, the beauty from Gajuwaka!
We are the bangle sellers." - Yes!

265
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,500
"Give me your hand,
I will help you with the bangles."

266
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,100
"We are the bangle sellers
from Gajuwaka.."

267
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,380
"Give me your hands.."

268
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,680
Oh, God!

269
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Buddy, listen to me.
Don't trouble her.

270
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,280
She created a typhoon in the middle
of the road. You can't resist it.

271
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,640
It is better if you move
from there. - Conductor!

272
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,640
Tell him that these seats
are for the ladies.

273
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,520
Stupid!
- He would have heard that.

274
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
I need not tell it again.
Ticket..

275
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,600
Look at him. He looks like one
of those good for nothing guys.

276
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
Buddy, please get up.

277
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
Get out of there.

278
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
What are you looking at?

279
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,800
'Senior citizen and handicapped.'
- What are you looking at?

280
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
Hey, mister! These seats are
reserved for the ladies.

281
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,280
Get up!
- "Though everything"

282
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
"goes upside-down.."

283
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,920
'He doesn't pay heed at all.'

284
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,040
"We will never give up."

285
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,760
"We will never give up.."
- Hello!

286
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh! Were you talking to me?

287
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,000
Sorry.. I thought you were
talking to someone else.

288
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,400
Is she the one
you were talking about?

289
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
You didn't tell me.

290
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
Sorry.
- When the girls are standing

291
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
how can you sit in those seats?
- Oh, no!

292
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,320
You need not be angry about this.

293
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
You want to sit, right?

294
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
Yes.
- One minute.

295
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Murali, please take it.

296
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
She is not able to stand
any longer.

297
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, my..
- "Punjabi!"

298
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,960
Oh, no! Sorry, sir.
I didn't know.

299
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,000
That's okay. - Please sit down.
- No, you sit down.

300
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,600
That's okay, just two more
stops before I get off.

301
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,400
You may sit down.
- Is that so? Okay.

302
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,960
"Punjabi!"

303
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,880
Oh! He is very smart!

304
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,240
Excuse me. If you don't mind,
can I sit here?

305
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,400
Of course, you may.
I'll make space for you.

306
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,880
Thank you.
- Wow! - He is very lucky!

307
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Oh, God!

308
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,480
Oh! I'm sorry..
- No, it's okay..

309
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
You can sit comfortably.

310
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,400
Wow! He is really lucky.

311
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,240
Ouch!

312
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,360
Be careful.. Okay?
- Thank you.

313
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,400
He is doing great!

314
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,480
I did not do it on purpose.
I'm a handicapped

315
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
so, I thought I can put my hand..
Sorry, it was by mistake.

316
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,760
Oh, okay.

317
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,840
He is smart, Buddy!

318
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,120
We have arrived.

319
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,040
You get down first.

320
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,600
Wait..

321
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,320
Move aside and give him way.

322
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
You may come.

323
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Hello! Are you surprised
that a handicapped did this stunt?

324
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,960
You acted smart by creating
a scene on the road.

325
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,000
I showed you that
I'm smarter than you.

326
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,680
You look sizzling hot!

327
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,720
You idiot!

328
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,520
Change the dialogues.
This is all old fashioned.

329
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,560
Move on.

330
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,680
Nowadays, there is no respect
for college students.

331
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,320
Why is that?
- Look, here comes a lean boy.

332
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,920
These people are a disgrace
to our name. Crap!

333
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,240
Hey!

334
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,400
Come here.

335
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Did you call me?

336
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,160
Yes, come here.

337
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,720
Oh!

338
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,720
What is your name?
- Sulla. - What?

339
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
You wanted to rag me, didn't you?
Is this enough? May I go?

340
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,400
Who is he?
- What's this?

341
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,920
Junior ragged the senior when it
should be the other way around.

342
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,400
Ask him to come here.
- Hey! - Yes, sir?

343
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,000
Come here!
- Of course, I will come.

344
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,040
What are you looking at?
- Oh, shouldn't I be looking?

345
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Here, hold this.

346
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,720
Hey, what is he doing?
- Hey..

347
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,100
Why are you doing this?
Get up and come here..

348
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Enough of swimming. Get up.

349
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,380
That person hit me on my head.
You might ask me to do this. So..

350
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,500
What's next?
Should I run around the college

351
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,700
while imitating a train?
Watch this.

352
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,820
He is over-doing this.
- I will teach him a lesson.

353
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,260
Hey, run!

354
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,580
Hey!

355
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,340
Does it look funny?

356
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,980
Did you think I will trip
and fall?

357
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,180
You can only aim at my leg,
but I can chop your head off.

358
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,860
Don't enrage me.

359
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,740
If you do, you will be dead!

360
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,900
Hey! Mister.

361
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,320
Who are you
and where are you going?

362
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,480
Greetings, sir. I work
in the corporation as..

363
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,480
Are you the commissioner?

364
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
No, I'm Mani, the driver
of the garbage truck.

365
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,080
My son is studying here.
I am here to meet him.

366
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,520
What?
Is your son studying here?

367
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,680
Should I believe this?

368
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Hey, that's enough. Now get out.,

369
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,600
It's true that my
son studies here.

370
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Hey, I told you. If that's true,
meet him after the college.

371
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,080
Go away.
- Hey!

372
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,560
Shouldn't poor children
study in the college?

373
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,280
You are just a peon. Don't
pretend like you are an officer.

374
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,160
You may go, sir.
He is a bumbling idiot.

375
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,120
Why should we get
into these elections?

376
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
You may ask someone
else to participate.

377
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,640
Though I refused,
they are forcing me to take part.

378
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,600
Tell them that it's impossible.

379
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,000
Sir, are you searching
for the office room?

380
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,360
No, my son studies here.

381
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
But I don't know where he is.

382
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,560
So, I'm searching for him.
- What is he studying?

383
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,280
I don't know.

384
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,040
He asked me money
for higher studies and I gave.

385
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,360
That is all I know. But I
don't know what he is studying.

386
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
He might be studying something
really important.

387
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,240
What is your son's name?
- It's Subramani.

388
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,160
student named Subramani..
- No.. It's Sulla..

389
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
All his friends call him that.

390
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Oh! You are Sulla's father.
Please wait here. I'll call him.

391
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,760
No.. Please don't.
If he finds out that I am here

392
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
he will not be happy.

393
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,200
Just show me where he is.
I'll see him from a distance.

394
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,240
That's the one.
The third room in the front.

395
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,440
Sir, did you see him?
- Thank you very much.

396
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,120
My son is studying.

397
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,920
My family will prosper.

398
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,080
I'll see you.
- Okay.

399
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Mister! - Yes?
- What is my son studying?

400
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,280
B.Sc. Chemistry.
- Oh! Is it?

401
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
My son is studying this. It might
be a great line of education.

402
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,040
Lakshmi, now I am confident that he
would do a better job than me.

403
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,040
Attention please!

404
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,640
The parking lots are going
to be auctioned by the city council

405
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,600
of Visakhapatnam for the year,
2006.

406
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,320
This auction is regarding all the
vehicles like cars, bus, lorry

407
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,360
two wheelers that enter the city
and their parking.

408
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,680
The previous year, it was
auctioned for Rs. 1.1 Crore.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,960
Now, we are going to start this
year's auction with the same rate.

410
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,200
Anyone interested
can quote their price.

411
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,000
The base price by the government
is Rs. 1 Lakh.

412
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,720
Rs. 10 Lakh.
- Rs. 15 Lakh.

413
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,520
Rs. 25 Lakh.

414
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,560
Rs. 30 Lakh.

415
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,600
Rs. 50 Lakh.
- Rs. 50 Lakh. - Rs. 60 Lakh.

416
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,800
Rs. 60 Lakh.
- Rs. 70 Lakh.

417
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,800
It has increased so soon
to Rs. 70 Lakh, sir.

418
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,280
This is one of the major places in
the city which gives more profit.

419
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,160
Not only that. It gives a profit
of Rs. 3 Crore per annum.

420
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,400
We need not bother about this.
Let's do our duty. Bye now.

421
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Rs. 1.2 Crore..

422
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,800
Anybody who wants to bid
may go ahead.

423
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,080
Rs. 1.2 Crore, once.

424
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Rs. 1.2 Crore, twice.

425
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,840
Rs..

426
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,320
Now try to ring the bell.
Hey!

427
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,120
What are you looking at?

428
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,280
Only after the third call
the auction will end.

429
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,720
If not, you must start
from the beginning.

430
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,120
If you get away with this,
what would be left for me?

431
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,360
Now, take a look at this.
Hey!

432
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,020
In the year 2006, the parking
area was bid for Rs. 10 Lakh

433
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,460
by Soori
alias Suryanarayana.

434
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,500
Hey, give me that money.
Take it!

435
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,540
Rs. 10 Lakh, once.

436
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,100
Rs. 10 Lakh, twice.

437
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,380
Rs. 10 Lakh, thrice!

438
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,660
Hey, first sign these documents.

439
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,860
If not, I'll thrash you
to your death. Sign it!

440
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,640
Come on! Sign it, you idiot!

441
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,200
Auction is over!

442
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,360
Anarchy..

443
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,720
Our country is filled with anarchy!

444
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,920
It has been 50 years
since we got our independence.

445
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,720
But we don't have the freedom
to question others.

446
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Those days, we were under
the rule of the British.

447
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Now we are under the rule
of our own people.

448
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,160
That's the only difference.

449
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,800
Starting the time that the
parliament was formed

450
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
till the auction held yesterday

451
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,320
there is corruption,
violence and anarchy involved.

452
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,260
Isn't there anyone who
can question them?

453
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,420
Isn't there anyone
to stop this injustice?

454
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,140
We must stop
these illegal activities!

455
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,420
We must..

456
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,140
Superb!

457
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,260
You did great! Continue..

458
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,140
No one responded to words.

459
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,660
The trend has changed,
they need the action.

460
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,460
Yes! Why are you so enraged?

461
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,900
Do you think you can talk anything
that comes into your mind?

462
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,620
What did you say? 'This must stop.'

463
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,620
'We must stop these
illegal activities.'

464
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,340
Yes, we must stop these.
Wait right there, I'm coming.

465
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,180
Hey, get away from here!

466
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,420
You are right. We must stop
whatever we feel is not right.

467
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,500
Hey! He is shouting since morning.
Did anyone support him?

468
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,420
Everybody is minding
their own business.

469
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,820
Okay, let's forget them.
You and I can sort this out.

470
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,980
I'll ask you something. Answer me.

471
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,600
You were talking on this mic.

472
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,560
Hello, mic testing..
One, two, three.. Hello..

473
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,200
The bass is good!

474
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,680
Tell me, on which side
to you is this mic?

475
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,280
Tell me!
- It is on my right.

476
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,040
I'll say, it's on my left.

477
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,720
Whose answer is right?

478
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
It's on left for you and
on the right for me.

479
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,240
What is right for me
is wrong to you.

480
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,080
What should I do about that?
Tell me, what can I do?

481
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,440
If a mic can cause such a clash

482
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,080
there would be many more
problems in the corporation.

483
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,640
So, we must stop
just like you said.

484
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,600
But sometimes we must.. - No.
- ...kill people like you.

485
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,240
'Gathering of the Revolutionary
Youngsters Association of India'

486
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
Excuse me?

487
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,880
What's the time?

488
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,620
It's 9:30.

489
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,740
Is it a.m. or p.m.?

490
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,940
Idiot! She clearly told me
to come at 9:30 p.m.

491
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,260
Why are you confusing her?
Dear, am I right?

492
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,180
Hey!
Call an auto rickshaw for us.

493
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,140
Find out how much she charges
and get her into an auto rickshaw.

494
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,980
If not an auto rickshaw,
call a taxi, I'm a busy man.

495
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
Sir, give me one cigarette.

496
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,020
This clock is giving me
a lot of trouble.

497
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,800
Why all this delay?
She is waiting, isn't she?

498
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,880
What time is it?
- Time.. Crap!

499
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,720
"Darling.." - It's not working.
It's troubling me just like my dad.

500
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,760
Sorry, sir. It's not working.
- "The secret of her beauty.."

501
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,180
I'll bring her. - Okay.
- You make all the arrangements.

502
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,240
Okay.
- What's the time, sir?

503
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
It is the same time as yesterday.

504
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,440
Go.. Go away..

505
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,740
He is a small boy
who is scared of us.

506
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,840
He shouldn't mess with us.

507
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,200
Dear, look here.
Tell me how this song is.

508
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,200
"Which place are you from?
Oh, beauty.."

509
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,400
"Which place.."
- There he comes again!

510
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,920
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings..

511
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,040
That's my friend's bike.
I didn't want to damage it. - Yes..

512
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,440
So, I just parked it aside
and came.

513
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,080
When I asked you the time you
said it is same as yesterday.

514
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
But you didn't mention the time.

515
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
It's a very bad time.
- Yes.

516
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,720
If I ask you, he is answering

517
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,320
and if I ask him,
you are answering.

518
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,200
Oh, wow!
You are playing around.

519
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,760
You said it is a bad time

520
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
but you forgot to mention
who it is bad for.

521
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,480
I think your time is bad.

522
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,880
Not mine, I think it's time
to teach you a lesson.

523
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,080
Oh, my God!

524
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,240
Excuse me, what's the time now?

525
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,040
Today is 2nd of February 2006.

526
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,760
To be more clear,
15th day of the month of 'Pushya'

527
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,320
in the year of 'Parthiva'.

528
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
I don't know the auspicious time.

529
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
But I think I started
in an inauspicious time.

530
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,760
There are no inauspicious
moments for today.

531
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,440
Everything is going to be all right
if we stay in our limits.

532
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,920
Now the exact time is 11:20 a.m.
Seconds, one, two, three.. - Hey!

533
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,020
I forgot. So, forgive me.
I might die if you hit me again.

534
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,140
She is under the hot sun.
Take her away from here. - Hey!

535
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,820
You told the exact time.

536
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,420
If you had told me this
half an hour ago

537
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,080
we would have gone
our separate ways.

538
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,680
Yes.
- Why did you mess it up?

539
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
What am I supposed to do?
That's my fate.

540
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,140
What is it?
- Actually, I'm scared.

541
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,180
Can you please drop me
near my hostel?

542
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,980
Hey, what do you mean?
What are you underestimating?

543
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,340
Me or my ability?

544
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,680
What is the point
in fighting all of them

545
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,480
when you are still scared?

546
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,040
Wait here till your bus arrives
and board it to go to your hostel.

547
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,000
I am going.

548
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,320
Hey! Why are you speeding?
You might die!

549
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,920
You would die if my vehicle
runs over you. Go!

550
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,360
No matter how fast I ride, I can
control it. Anyway, I'm sorry.

551
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Oh, my God!
- Quiet!

552
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,740
If you try to shout,
I will bite your lips.

553
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,840
Can you please move a bit?

554
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,380
No, I can't. Come with me.
- Where?

555
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,800
They are here again.
Come and fight them.

556
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,280
How can you ask me
to fight them now?

557
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,800
You are in love with me, right?
- No, I'm not.

558
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,700
Then why did leave me there?
- So what?

559
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,120
If you didn't have feelings for me

560
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,360
you should've let me
sit on your motorbike.

561
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,720
So, you are in love with me.

562
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,640
Not at all, now get off.
- Don't lie to me.

563
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
Don't you like me?

564
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,640
Swear to me.
- I swear that I don't like you.

565
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,000
Don't you like me..
- I don't like you..

566
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,880
Hey, what happened?
- Why did you shout?

567
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,280
Have you gone mad?
Idiot!

568
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,600
He is owlishly staring at us.
Get him an amulet from the mosque.

569
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,920
Yes, I have gone mad.

570
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,520
"Turn the computer on."

571
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,680
"Four, three, two, one."

572
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,280
"I want to rock you so tight.
It's going to be a longer night."

573
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,720
"You are going
to think it so hard."

574
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,080
"These beats are going
to hit you tight."

575
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,600
"Hey, beautiful!
Come, let's rock it down."

576
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,840
"Hey, handsome!
Are you here to kiss me?"

577
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,920
"Rain rain, don't go away."

578
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,560
"I'm shaking it down
with my girl today."

579
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,800
"Rain rain, don't go away."

580
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,400
"I'm breaking it down
with my boy today."

581
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,280
"Hey, beautiful!
Come, let's rock it down."

582
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,520
"Hey, handsome!
Are you here to kiss me?"

583
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,400
"Rain rain, don't go away."

584
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,120
"I'm shaking it down
with my girl today."

585
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,000
"One, two, three, four!
Four, three, two one!"

586
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,280
"Feelings grow in my heart
when you kiss me."

587
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,120
"If you come to me,
I will trip out of happiness."

588
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,800
"I will drink your beauty."

589
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,640
"Let me hold you tight
and kiss you."

590
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,640
"Don't show off
and try to intimidate me."

591
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,800
"I will not do it.
Face me if you can."

592
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,000
"Rain rain, don't go away."

593
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,680
"I'm shaking it down
with my girl today."

594
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,920
"Rain rain, don't go away."

595
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,120
"I'm breaking it down
with my boy today."

596
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,360
"Hey, beautiful!
Come, let's rock it down."

597
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,520
"Hey, handsome!
Are you here to kiss me?"

598
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
"All the people in the world"

599
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
"now you are watching,
hearing, feeling, grooving."

600
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,600
"It's the 'Bhangra',
hip-hop remix."

601
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,440
"Mr. Lover got a single flower
for the lady who says never."

602
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,800
"Mr. Lover says it's not over"

603
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,440
"and tries again
and again forever."

604
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,440
"This young age is burning me
with its intensity."

605
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,400
"Your love has pierced
my heart like a thorn."

606
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,520
"When fire helps fire,
it can overcome anything."

607
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,360
"You will find solace
in my embrace."

608
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,360
"It will be good for you to know
the measure of my beauty."

609
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,440
"We will be upset
if we miss this chance."

610
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,680
"Rain rain, don't go away."

611
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,480
"I'm shaking it down
with my girl today."

612
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,600
"Rain rain, don't go away."

613
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,280
"I'm breaking it down
with my boy today."

614
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,040
"Hey, beautiful!
Come, let's rock it down."

615
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,280
"Hey, handsome!
Are you here to kiss me?"

616
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,240
"Rain rain, don't go away."

617
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,640
"I'm shaking it down
with my girl today."

618
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,160
"Rain rain, don't go away."

619
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,960
"I'm breaking it down
with my boy today."

620
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,220
Kavya.

621
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,100
Don't get me wrong.

622
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,820
Actually

623
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,300
I have been wanting
to tell you something.

624
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,860
I have tried to express
it in this letter.

625
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,300
I mean, I have written it.
If you can read it once..

626
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,300
I'll kill you, idiot!

627
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,820
Sulla. What?
- What..

628
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,300
How dare you write a letter to her!

629
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,380
No..
- There are many girls here.

630
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,820
Why didn't you give it to them?
- Please, leave me..

631
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,100
I will kill you.

632
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,180
Hey, why were you smiling
when he was giving it to you?

633
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,980
I'll thrash you.

634
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,620
Give that here.

635
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,540
'Dear, Kavya. I wanted
to write a love letter to you'

636
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,060
'but it won't be as poetic as you.'

637
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,020
'You are not just Kavya.
You are the resemblance to love.'

638
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,660
Wow! Superb! I'm unable
to write anything like this.

639
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,140
'The sky turns into an umbrella
if it rains in my dreams.'

640
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,100
'When it really rains, the umbrella
turns out to be the sky.'

641
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,020
'You are my dream
and you are my love.'

642
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,420
Idiot! Sure..

643
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,380
Do you think she will fall
for such poetry?

644
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,500
Do you think she will accept
you for just this letter?

645
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,100
Did I ever betray you?

646
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,820
I'm struggling to write
such a letter to her.

647
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,740
You look fair and handsome.

648
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,140
Shouldn't a dusky people
fall in love? Do me a favour

649
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,140
I will tell you
how much I love her

650
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,180
and how important she is to me.

651
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,100
Write it in a paper
and give it to me.

652
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,500
I will give it to her.
If she rejects me..

653
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,620
Will you reject me?

654
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,620
If she rejects me,
I will give your letter to her.

655
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,140
Hey.. Please. I couldn't
write a letter like this.

656
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,740
That's why I just scribbled
in this entire book.

657
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,940
Sorry..
I apologise for hitting you.

658
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,260
There is nothing wrong
in writing a letter to her.

659
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,620
It's definitely not wrong.

660
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,700
I love her.
I couldn't sleep last night.

661
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,780
You know she keeps disturbing me.

662
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,780
Sorry..

663
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,140
Do you like me?

664
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,380
Did you fall in love with me?
- Yes.

665
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,940
Do you want to live
your life with me?

666
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,940
Tell me, do you want to live
your life with me? - Yes.

667
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,820
Since when have you
been having these feelings?

668
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,980
Since last night.
- But I started feeling this way

669
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,100
from the moment I saw you.

670
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,460
Do you think I'll fall for someone
who is fair and handsome?

671
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,220
You said you cannot
write a letter.

672
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,740
Those scribbling speak
a lot about your feelings.

673
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,140
You..!

674
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,200
Buddy, did Kavya respond
when you proposed to her?

675
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,560
That's none of your business.

676
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,480
Hey, Nayar!

677
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,080
Welcome, sir..
- Hold on to it, I'll come back.

678
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,980
Hey, get me two glasses of water.
- Okay. Would you like some tea?

679
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,340
Just get me some water.

680
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,200
People usually mix
liquor with water.

681
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,340
But I mix water with liquor.

682
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,140
That is my style.

683
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,620
Buddy, let's go from here.
- Why?

684
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,940
Look over there.

685
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,580
I don't think it's the right time.

686
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,660
He might mess with me
and I would end up in a fight again

687
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,740
and my dad will beat me up.
Let's go.

688
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,140
Nayar, give me two cups..
I will go to some other shop.

689
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,860
Sir, this is my business time.

690
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,060
There are chairs inside.
Can you please go inside and drink?

691
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,300
Why shouldn't I drink here?
It's just one peg.

692
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,580
Hey,
why the hell did you touch me?

693
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,260
No, I'm just trying to go out.
- So what?

694
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,700
Am I not standing here?
Come here.

695
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,940
I'm getting late for collage.
Let me go.

696
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,300
What will you do there?
- Let me go, sir.

697
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,740
Stretch your hand. - Sir, please..
- Put your hand out!

698
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,900
Sir, please don't do it.
I have to go.

699
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,580
Where do you want to go?

700
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,660
Sir, take it off.
- Hey, that's okay.

701
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,820
Take it off! - There is some
change in your tone. What is it?

702
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,820
Take it off. - Oh, look!
He is angry. - Take it off!

703
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,420
What if I don't?
- Hey! You, scoundrel!

704
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,180
Hey!

705
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,340
Stop it!

706
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,540
I will kill you!
- Hey.. Calm down!

707
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,300
I was minding my own business.
Idiot! I will slay you alive.

708
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,220
Hey, calm down.
- I didn't do anything. - Okay..

709
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,660
Let it be. - Hey, how dare you..
- I said stop it.

710
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,300
I'm sparing you
just because of him!

711
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,980
If not..

712
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,980
People should be terrified
to even talk to my goons.

713
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,020
Hey, are you trying to flirt
with him? He won't fall for anyone.

714
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,180
Right! Is he your master?
- Hey, what are you saying?

715
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,300
There is only one sun,
one moon and only one Rajini.

716
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,940
As if!

717
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,740
Why do you always wear a sari?

718
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,180
Why don't you dress up
in a modern dress?

719
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,420
Forget that.
Your friends are here for you.

720
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,300
Oh, my God! Hey, come here.
- What? - I said, come here.

721
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,780
What? Do you consider
yourself a hero?

722
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,420
Why are you showing off?
Let me go.

723
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,140
What did you do in Nayar's shop
yesterday? - I just drank some tea.

724
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,740
Don't be arrogant!
- Who told you?

725
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,660
Why do you care if someone drinks?

726
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,140
Look, you are skinny. Someday,
someone will break your bones.

727
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,100
Ask who got knocked out yesterday.

728
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,420
I know you knocked him down.

729
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,860
But do you know
what happened to Nayar?

730
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,060
They sent him to Kerala.

731
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,140
Why do you always
make a mess of your life?

732
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,180
Sneha, ask him to keep quiet.

733
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,740
What's wrong? - First,
answer me. - I have been asking you

734
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,300
but you never answer.
- They have nothing better to do.

735
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,260
Never will he have more
than this in his pocket.

736
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,860
I don't know when is he
going to be responsible.

737
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,480
Hey, we are late to the movie.
Come on! - Wait, I'm coming.

738
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,240
Hey!

739
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,840
Hey!
- Greetings, sir.

740
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,060
Why do you want
to be run over by my car?

741
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,480
Sorry, sir. You please go.

742
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,640
Go.. - You may go.
- He always cuts into my way. Go.

743
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,640
Take it and move.

744
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,680
Why did you catch a
running bus? - To meet you.

745
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,680
Who is going to buy the ticket
if you keep staring at her?

746
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,960
Take it.

747
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,400
Get down. - Why?
- I don't have change. Get down.

748
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,920
You will have it in your bag.
Give that.

749
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,200
Hey, what am I supposed to do
if I give you all the change?

750
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,720
First, give it to me. Take care
of them later. - Hey, get down.

751
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,520
I feel that today
is your unlucky day.

752
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,760
God! He is irritating me.

753
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,760
Driver, go to the police station.
- Let him go.

754
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,760
Is there any strict officer there?

755
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,640
What did you just say?
- Hello.

756
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,520
Get me a ticket to the campus.
- But you already have it.

757
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,200
That's none of your business.
Give me the ticket

758
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,160
and ask him to start the bus.
- This happens every day.

759
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,000
Why did you buy it for me?
We shouldn't spare them.

760
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,920
It was just going to be
inconvenient for everyone here.

761
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,000
So, forget it. - God!
Why are you so peace loving?

762
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,640
Ma'am, at least you be brave.

763
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,560
Hey, will you come?
- Yes! - Shut up!

764
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,880
I asked if you would
walk me to my hostel.

765
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,200
Why? Don't you have
money to buy a ticket?

766
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,640
No.
- I can buy a ticket.

767
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,000
Otherwise,
we can go without buying one.

768
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,160
I mean, I want to speak to you
while walking. Come on!

769
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,840
Do you watch award winning
movies all the time? - Why?

770
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,000
Because only they
show lovers walking

771
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,680
without speaking to each other.
That's why.

772
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,640
Hey, say something.

773
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,960
Hold this.

774
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,160
Dear friends,
ladies and gentlemen and activists.

775
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,960
Vote for our party and make it win!

776
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,080
You asked me to speak.
This is how we speak.

777
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,720
I asked you to speak only to me,
not to the entire world.

778
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,000
Hey, catch me if you can..
- Stop there.

779
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,560
You cannot catch me..
- I caught you.

780
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,760
The hostel life makes me miss home.

781
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,320
My mom who always scolds me.

782
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,360
My dad who is an easy going man.

783
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,000
My brothers who love me.

784
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,880
My sisters-in-law who always smile

785
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,880
and their cute kids.

786
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,920
Our home is always filled
with their smiles.

787
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,440
When I left home
to join this college

788
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,320
I used to feel really lonely.

789
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,480
But I saw that affection
in someone here.

790
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,760
Who is that?
- That's you.

791
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,200
Come closer. You shouldn't
get drenched in the rain.

792
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,600
Come closer..

793
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,920
'Come, let's get drenched.
- I won't.'

794
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,560
'Why? Don't you like it?'

795
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,040
'We might get cold
if we get drenched.'

796
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,320
'How boring!
I want you to come here.'

797
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,840
'Hey, go.
She is calling you.'

798
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,960
'If you don't, I will leave.
- I won't come. Go away!'

799
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,280
'I will seriously walk
away from here. - Go!'

800
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,040
I feel great when I'm getting
drenched with you.

801
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,000
"You are the poet
and I'm the poetry."

802
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,640
"But the fact is really unknown."

803
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,520
"I could feel, hear your feelings
and your poetry in my dreams."

804
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,440
"You are the poet
and I'm the poetry."

805
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,520
"But the fact is really unknown."

806
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,040
"I could feel, hear your feelings
and your poetry in my dreams."

807
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,480
"My heart literally demands you."

808
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,960
"My heart is asking me
to marry you."

809
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,280
"You are the poet
and I'm the poetry."

810
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,920
"But the fact is really unknown."

811
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,560
"I could feel, hear your feelings
and your poetry in my dreams."

812
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,320
"Rise from the darkness
to enjoy the light."

813
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:51,000
"Reach me with happiness."

814
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:57,480
"Always protect me
from the wicked eyes."

815
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,160
"Show me the light
that can guide me to you."

816
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,400
"Your smile drizzles on me
like the shower of gentle rain."

817
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:16,520
"When I take in your breath,
my heart rejoices."

818
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,720
"I could feel, hear your feelings
and your poetry in my dreams."

819
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,800
"The whole world should dance gaily
when you look at them."

820
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,440
"I can get all the men fall for me
with just a touch."

821
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:26,280
"You are so naughty. You can
teach people to be like you."

822
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,280
"In that case, I will gift my
naughtiness as a dowry to you."

823
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,080
"These moments of our love
will stay eternal."

824
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:44,920
"This love has agreed
to get us closer."

825
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,760
"You are the poetry
and I'm the poet."

826
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,360
"But the fact is really unknown."

827
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:57,080
"I could feel, hear your feelings
and your poetry in my dreams."

828
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,400
"My heart literally demands you."

829
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,240
"My heart is asking me
to marry you."

830
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,800
Idiot!

831
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,160
Damn it!

832
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm late.
The bus didn't arrive yet.

833
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,880
Hey, the bus has arrived.

834
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,800
Sir, could you move a little?

835
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,440
Sir, make some way.

836
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,240
Take this. Take this ticket.
Give me the money.

837
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,760
Do not stand there.
Come inside. Come on in..

838
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,960
Sorry.
- These guys started it again.

839
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,080
Go. Get inside.

840
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,480
Damn it! - Can you please get
me two tickets for Rs. 4?

841
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,720
Damn it! I think these guys
don't have anything better to do.

842
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,120
What are you staring at?
Don't stand there. Get inside..

843
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,640
Dear, come and stand here.
They come here only to misbehave.

844
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,920
Damn it!

845
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,740
Sir, can you please move a bit?
- Why? - Please, move a little.

846
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,260
Come here.
Come and face me.

847
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,460
Turn around!

848
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,580
This is what you've been
struggling for, right?

849
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,940
I have been noticing you. You
always want to stand close to me.

850
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,060
You are doing a good job.
- Do you want to marry me?

851
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,420
Let's get down at the next stop.
Will you marry me at the temple?

852
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,340
Tell me.

853
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Speak out!

854
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,460
I swear, I'm not joking.
Seriously, will you?

855
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,500
When you could like a girl like me

856
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,220
I don't want a handsome guy.

857
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,420
I can settle with you.
I don't expect anything else.

858
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,740
I just need food thrice a day
and two saris per year. That's it.

859
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,380
Will you marry me?

860
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,980
I don't even have
to tell my parents.

861
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,420
I will come with you right now.

862
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,580
Do you have the courage
to marry me? - No.. I..

863
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,460
You can't, right..

864
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,860
You just want to have
fun with me, right?

865
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,180
Then why do you misbehave?

866
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,760
We cannot afford
to buy our own vehicle

867
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,640
just because you do this to us.

868
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,760
We are forced to travel by the bus.

869
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,080
Because we really can't afford it.

870
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,560
We just want to support
our parents financially.

871
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,840
That's why we work.
- Poor girl.

872
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,960
Look at this.

873
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:20,320
Our dreams and our hopes are worn
out just like this bus pass.

874
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,960
Please don't trouble us anymore.

875
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,220
You should have thrashed
him with the slippers.

876
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,060
They will not change
even if you do that.

877
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,980
Parvathi, why are you running?
- They are here! - Who?

878
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,740
Those men who had lent me money.

879
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,920
I couldn't pay
this month's interest.

880
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,320
I'm really scared.
They will use abusive words.

881
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,600
I have led a respectful life,
I can't go through this.

882
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,060
Don't worry.
- What's are you scared now?

883
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,200
Shut up! She is scared.
Give that to me.

884
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,560
What is scaring you?

885
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,000
Drink water, I will talk to them.
- Go.. You can only abuse me

886
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,840
you would know better
once you talk to them.

887
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,200
Don't be so loud.

888
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,640
Wait! Where are you going?
- I don't have to tell you.

889
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,840
Why are you being so rude?
I just asked you a question.

890
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,400
Hey, just go.
- You are here for Parvathi, right?

891
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,400
She will pay the interest soon.
You can leave now.

892
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,000
Really? And then? - She lost
her husband. She is helpless..

893
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
So what? Do you think
I'm here to sleep with her?

894
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,580
Move.
- Please wait!

895
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,220
I said, move!
- Listen to me.

896
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,780
I said, move!
- Hey, wait! - Hey!

897
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,080
How dare you dictate me!

898
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,680
Hey!

899
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,320
Hey!

900
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,320
Hey!

901
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,240
Who did you think you manhandled?

902
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,560
I will kill you!

903
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,280
What are you staring at?

904
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,800
I will slash you.

905
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,880
Didn't she ask you to leave?
- Hey!

906
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,280
What's your problem?

907
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,160
I will destroy you.

908
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,920
Hey,
how dare you hold my collar!

909
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,280
Today, I am tearing this shirt.
Tomorrow, I'll rip you apart.

910
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,980
I'll not spare you today..
- Don't hit me, Dad..

911
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,300
Why do you get angry?
Why is that?

912
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,680
Oh, no! Don't hit him.
- Actually, I must hit you.

913
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,420
Mother and son went around
preaching to those people.

914
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,560
Do you know who he faced today?
- I don't care.

915
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,600
He hit my mother.
- Don't utter a word.

916
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,740
Dad, leave him..

917
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,200
I'll break your hands.
- What's all this?

918
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,940
For what mistake
are you hitting him?

919
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,920
If you feel so bad when I hit him,
what would happen if they kill him?

920
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,480
Yes, that's what I am scared of.

921
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,000
He is my only son. I thought
he would study well and prosper

922
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,600
but he is fighting
against all the rowdies.

923
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,520
Why did I nurture you both
by struggling so much?

924
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,040
Sulla, is it to see you die
at a young age?

925
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,840
Look at him..
He is standing like an idol.

926
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,200
Can't he say something?

927
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,240
Can't you apologise
and promise not to do it again?

928
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,120
When I haven't done any mistake,
why should I apologise?

929
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,720
Don't argue with me..
- Dad, leave him..

930
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,240
Hey, get in!
I told you to get inside.

931
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,960
It's all my fate!

932
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,240
I don't know what bad deeds I did.
He is turning into a rowdy.

933
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,680
Your support will spoil him.
One day, you'll see me dead.

934
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,600
Then you will be orphaned.
- So be it.

935
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,240
Hey..

936
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,560
I am cringing with shame..

937
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,800
He is such a little boy.
How dare he mess with me!

938
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,440
How dare he mess with me!
Hey, he held my shirt.

939
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,680
I'll go to his house right now
and break his hands and legs.

940
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,080
Hey, start the car!
- Soori, listen to me.

941
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,280
Where are you going?

942
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,120
You must not deal with him
for your dignity.

943
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,520
You might disgrace yourself.

944
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,160
Don't!
- Sir, calm down.

945
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,440
I'll take care of this.

946
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,120
I'll chop him into pieces
and feed him to the birds.

947
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,200
It's a simple matter.
You need not worry.

948
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,240
Hey, let's go!

949
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,800
'How dare he mess with me!'

950
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Hey!

951
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,920
Hey!
- Hey!

952
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,040
Stop!
- Hey! - Stop! - Hey.. - Stop..

953
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey! - Hey!
- Hey! - Hey!

954
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,120
Hey!
- Hey!

955
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,920
Hey! - Hey!

956
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,440
Hey..
- Hey.. - Hey.. - Hey..

957
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,520
Hey, who are you?

958
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,320
Subramani.
- I don't care.

959
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,280
Why are you sitting here?

960
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,840
I am playing hide and seek.
- What?

961
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,440
With whom?
- With them.

962
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,120
All the Sumos are coming..

963
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,600
Park them in a circle..

964
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,720
Hello, who are you, sir?

965
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,920
You are giving me respect
after looking at them.

966
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,560
Wait and watch the fight.

967
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,080
Do you know that if I hit them
in my area, Mani will hit me?

968
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,160
Who is Mani?
- My father. He will bash me up.

969
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,040
Sir!

970
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,400
Hey! You do fear us.
Should we spare you if you run?

971
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,400
I ran and came here,
but it was not to hide.

972
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,920
I brought you here
to break your bones.

973
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,720
Can you break my bones?
You better get into the car.

974
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,720
If not..
- Hey!

975
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,360
Are you mocking me?
- Catch him. - Oh!

976
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,520
Catch me if you can.

977
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,260
Hey, I may look like a little boy.

978
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,980
If you touch me,
you will be left broken.

979
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,100
What did you say?

980
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,660
I didn't say anything.
Watch me now.

981
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:14,180
Hey, we asked you to stop
the vehicle. Who is Sulla?

982
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,380
Can't you all hear me?
Who is Sulla?

983
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,700
Hey, are you Sulla?
Get down.

984
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,340
Hey, I told you to get down.

985
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,180
What are you looking at?
The whole department

986
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,340
is afraid of me. Get down.

987
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,580
Get down and come here.
- Where?

988
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,940
To the police station?
- Why?

989
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,020
We got a complaint
that you raped a girl.

990
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,020
Me? Who is that girl?
- Get down, ma'am.

991
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:52,540
He is the one.
- You heard it, now get down.

992
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,860
Hey, move aside.

993
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,460
Wait, buddy.
- Wait.

994
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,260
What is it?
- Sir, I'm not able to sleep

995
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:15,180
eat or study because of him.

996
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:16,660
I'm not able to do anything.

997
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,340
Did you hear that?
Now get into the jeep.

998
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,860
Did you stop our bus
for this silly thing?

999
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,100
If she is mad,
take her to the hospital.

1000
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,740
Why are asking me to come?
- You can ask them if I am lying.

1001
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,580
Oh! That's the matter.
- Yes, he is the one..

1002
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:35,740
Sir, he looks innocent,
but he is very dangerous.

1003
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,380
Hey, I think this isn't
a good time for you.

1004
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,940
Hey, how dare you threaten them!
Get into the jeep.

1005
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,780
How dare you touch me!
- Ouch!

1006
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,620
Oh, God! Ma'am, why didn't you tell
me that he hits the police as well?

1007
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,340
I was about to act in
actor Chiranjeevi's film.

1008
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,780
You got me here and he hit me..
- Are you are a duplicate police?

1009
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,360
You are dead. Hey, stop there.
- Save me..

1010
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,640
I was hurt enough with just one
blow. - Idiot, stop there.

1011
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,080
I cannot take another blow!
- I'll kill you.

1012
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,560
Hey, stop there.
- I'm begging you, leave me.

1013
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,980
Hey!
- Hey!

1014
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,100
This is why I like you.

1015
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,760
Subramani, your anger is what
I like the most in you.

1016
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:36,860
"Oh, my love!"

1017
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,780
"You are like the freshly fallen
snow with a lovely heart."

1018
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,740
"Oh, Sulla!"

1019
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:51,500
"You are my moon,
sun and rainbow."

1020
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,740
"I was happy with my
newly found strength"

1021
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:01,500
"but your love made
me a mad person."

1022
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:06,340
"When my lips can feel yours.."

1023
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,900
"Your image gets
etched on my heart."

1024
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,340
"Oh, my love!"

1025
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:19,780
"You are like the freshly fallen
snow with a lovely heart."

1026
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,820
"Oh, Sulla!"

1027
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,580
"You are my moon,
sun and rainbow."

1028
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,380
"At 12.
- You know what friendship is."

1029
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,780
"At 16.
- You know what love is."

1030
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,300
"This beauty nourished!"

1031
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,940
"The beauty of..
- First light."

1032
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,420
"The friendship..
- That makes us happy."

1033
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:14,140
"It's the age of grace!"

1034
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:19,060
"When I decide to win you"

1035
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:22,900
"my age should be of help."

1036
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:28,740
"In every moment of yours"

1037
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,860
"I shall infuse my love."

1038
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:41,140
"Accept my love towards you
like a honey bee."

1039
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:46,540
"Oh, my love!"

1040
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,540
"You are like the freshly fallen
snow with a lovely heart."

1041
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,740
"You waist..
- Is very beautiful."

1042
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,220
"Like a book..
- Completely."

1043
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:30,340
"It explains about love."

1044
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,340
"If that cloud..
- Becomes an umbrella."

1045
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,780
"The rain..
- From it.."

1046
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:40,060
"...invited me to play in it."

1047
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:45,460
"The words in which I expressed
my love, filled a book."

1048
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,780
"I dedicate it to you, my love."

1049
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,100
"The closeness of us made me glad"

1050
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,460
"and it makes me
tremble in happiness."

1051
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:07,580
"Your desires reached me
as the blush on your cheeks."

1052
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,100
"Oh, my love!"

1053
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,900
"You are like the freshly fallen
snow with a lovely heart."

1054
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,500
"Oh, Sulla!"

1055
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:28,020
"You are my moon,
sun and rainbow."

1056
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,080
Is this Kalpana's house?

1057
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,080
Who are you?
What do you want?

1058
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,200
Is no one else at home?
- Why? Can't you talk to me?

1059
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,640
Who is Kalpana here?

1060
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,000
Are you a friend of my sister?
- Hey.

1061
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,720
He is here.

1062
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,920
Who are you?
- My name is Satyanarayana Murthy.

1063
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,240
She's my wife.
- Greetings.

1064
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,400
He's my son Satya.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

1065
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,640
She is my daughter.

1066
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,440
We are here to ask your daughter's
hand in marriage for our son.

1067
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,520
Shall we discuss this inside?
- Come in.

1068
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,680
You came here unexpectedly.
Take your seat.

1069
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,440
Sit down.
- I'll be back. - Okay, sir.

1070
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,000
Is this a love affair?
- Hey!

1071
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,000
Tell me if there is something
like that, dear.

1072
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,400
That's fine. - Dad,
there is nothing like that.

1073
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,960
I don't even know that person.

1074
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,760
First,
go and find out their details.

1075
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,360
Why are you asking me without
knowing who they are?

1076
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,800
That's not it, dear.
- What do you mean?

1077
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,400
Go and ask who they are.

1078
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,200
It's nothing, sir. The thing is..

1079
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,440
Sir, do not take this the wrong
way. I'll come to the point.

1080
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,800
I work at government press.
I earn Rs. 4,500 a month.

1081
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,080
I like your daughter a lot.
But she doesn't know who I am.

1082
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,760
One day, she made a person
who's misbehaving in a bus

1083
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,280
realise his mistake
instead of humiliating him.

1084
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,800
I liked that quality in her a lot.

1085
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,520
I wanted a mature girl like her
as my wife.

1086
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,160
That's why, I convinced my parents

1087
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,640
and brought them to talk to you.

1088
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,420
Move in!

1089
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,940
Do you have a bike?

1090
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,120
Bike?
- Don't you have a bike?

1091
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:18,840
Great match!
- He's a little apathetic.

1092
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,880
I'm very glad after hearing your
opinion about my daughter.

1093
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,960
Dad, come here for a moment.

1094
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,280
She's calling me. I'll be back.

1095
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,000
What is it, dear?
You heard him, right?

1096
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,640
What should I say?
- What now?

1097
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,080
Should I go with them?

1098
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,200
What are you saying, dear?

1099
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,660
Stop it, Mom.
- That's not it, dear.

1100
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,080
How can you accept immediately
when someone comes with a proposal?

1101
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,200
Why are you talking
like that, dear?

1102
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,640
Dad, will you send them away
or shall I do it?

1103
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,280
Do not take this the wrong way.

1104
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,980
I'll inform you once we discuss
about this match more in detail.

1105
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,220
It's not right on my part

1106
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,780
to barge into your house like this.

1107
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:05,980
Please, forgive us. Bye.

1108
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,860
Bye, sir.
- Come on, Mom. - Good.

1109
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,080
It's very peaceful here, right?

1110
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,040
No matter how many
times I see it

1111
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,840
it feels new every time.

1112
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,120
This limitless sea

1113
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,640
amazing air

1114
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,960
stirring sea waves

1115
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,480
and the noise of these waves.

1116
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,760
They are all saying something,
right?

1117
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,120
Look over there.

1118
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,760
Those rays of sun at a distance
we can see.

1119
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,600
They are very beautiful.

1120
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,560
At the point where
the sky and sea meet

1121
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,520
there will be
another small world.

1122
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,320
In that world

1123
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,640
we both..

1124
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,600
Hey!
- Oh, no!

1125
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,240
Oh, no! Let me go.

1126
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,400
Did you go crazy on your way here?

1127
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,800
Hey, your name is Kavya, right?

1128
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,800
Your dad deserves the blame
for naming you that.

1129
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,960
You are torturing me in the name
of poems and songs.

1130
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,240
If you keep talking about
sun rays, sea waves and worlds

1131
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,360
you'll end up in an asylum.

1132
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,120
You are thinking too much about
unnecessary stuff.

1133
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:47,120
But I'm 100 percent indigenous
and the hero of Andhra Pradesh.

1134
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,580
What is it?
Don't you like them?

1135
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,740
No.. It's not because
I don't like them.

1136
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,340
I don't understand such things.

1137
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,260
All I know is sports,
quarrels and fights. That's all.

1138
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:04,620
Even now, I'll beat anyone
if you want me to.

1139
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,260
Will you beat anyone?
- Yes.

1140
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,100
Try hitting me.

1141
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,860
Hey!
Sorry..

1142
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,980
I-I slapped you by mistake.

1143
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,780
I'm always like this.

1144
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,700
I do anything if someone
I like asks me to.

1145
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,740
I'm sorry.

1146
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,440
Sir?
- Yes, tell me.

1147
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,200
I am here to meet Mr. Satya,
he works in the printing section.

1148
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,160
Just a moment..

1149
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,040
Sir, there's a lady
here to meet Mr. Satya.

1150
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,360
'Restricted Area'

1151
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,880
Hello?

1152
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,940
Do you want some tea?

1153
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,380
You drink tea, right?
- Yes.

1154
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,020
Come on.

1155
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,700
Vijay! - Sir? - Give me
two cups of tea. - Okay.

1156
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,620
You can wait there, I'll come.

1157
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,900
Mr. Satya,
I need to talk to you.

1158
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,820
I know. I don't think you came all
this way to play hide and seek.

1159
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,340
Drink your tea.

1160
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:53,860
Look, I like you a lot.

1161
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,780
Oh, no!

1162
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:58,340
I acted aloof thinking
you are here to apologise.

1163
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:02,660
Forgive me. - But I cannot
marry you right now.

1164
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,700
Do you watch a lot
of television series?

1165
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:07,140
Because you talk like
one of those actors.

1166
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,740
It's not that. I'm being serious.

1167
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,100
Why are you serious? You can
say that with a smiling face.

1168
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,980
Because if you tell me that you'll
not come into my life with a smile

1169
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,460
it wouldn't be so painful
as I will remember your smile.

1170
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:26,860
A girl can be happy only if she
gets a good husband like you.

1171
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,460
But my family's happiness is
more important to me than that.

1172
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:34,580
It's my father's hard work that
brings food to the table

1173
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:35,940
and a little bit of my effort.

1174
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:39,340
My father struggled a lot
to raise me and my brother.

1175
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,820
But my brother has
remained to be useless.

1176
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,940
The hopes of our family
are pinned on him.

1177
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,780
But I don't believe in him.

1178
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,060
He really is a great guy.

1179
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:53,220
But education didn't interest him.

1180
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,420
Our father will retire in a year.

1181
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,180
If he spends all his
saving on my wedding

1182
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:02,580
and I leave them and come
with you carelessly

1183
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,260
my family will not survive

1184
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,580
let alone have good life.

1185
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,580
I cannot do this.

1186
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,060
I can't leave them like
that and come with you.

1187
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,900
If I leave them on their own

1188
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,500
I'll be the most selfish woman
in this world.

1189
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,780
Do not look at me like that,
Mr. Satya.

1190
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:28,380
I don't want to be happy alone.

1191
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,900
Because my father didn't
raise me that way.

1192
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,180
P-Please forgive me.

1193
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,660
At first, I just thought
you are a good person

1194
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,180
but I now I know that
you are a great person.

1195
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,140
Bye.

1196
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,260
Hello, one moment!

1197
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,140
What if your brother changes

1198
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,700
and takes up the responsibility
of your family?

1199
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:01,500
I'll see you then.

1200
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,180
What is this?

1201
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,980
You left this place saying
you would destroy him, right?

1202
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:33,740
But you came back
running for your lives.

1203
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:35,500
What is it, pal?

1204
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,660
When you went to destroy him,
did he beat the crap out of you?

1205
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:39,580
N-No, boss.

1206
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,740
What do you mean, you idiots!
I can see it.

1207
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,940
You all came back like losers.
Damn!

1208
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,060
That's not it, boss.
Though he looks like a kid

1209
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,940
he beat up each one of us.
- Hey!

1210
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,820
Who are you talking to?

1211
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:53,100
If I snap a finger, even the sun
will rise in the west.

1212
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,820
That kid is nothing.

1213
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,340
Hey, start the vehicles.

1214
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,300
Sir, give three cups of tea.

1215
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:02,860
Subramani..
- Are these buns fresh?

1216
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:04,460
Hey, Sulla.

1217
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,140
Come here.
- Are you calling me? - Yes.

1218
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:09,180
I thought it was someone else.

1219
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:12,540
Why are you ignoring me?

1220
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:16,900
Do you like me?
- Why?

1221
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,180
It's nothing. Only my dad calls
me Subramani.

1222
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,740
You are the second person
to call me by that name.

1223
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,580
That's why.
- I don't know why

1224
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,660
you don't have a brother like me

1225
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,660
and I don't have a brother
like you. That's why.

1226
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,460
Fine, let it go. Hey, ma'am.

1227
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,700
Are you having fun with him?
- No, I'll go to some other shop.

1228
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,980
Yes, right..

1229
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,900
Everyone in our college
knows about you.

1230
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,220
Hey, stop it.

1231
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:43,060
Wow, you are blushing!

1232
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,540
Take good care of him, ma'am.

1233
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,860
If you let him go, you'll
regret it. Accept him.

1234
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,940
Hey.. Throw it.
- Hey, come on.

1235
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,900
Hey, pass it..
- Come..

1236
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,820
Hey, this way..
- Hey, cover him.

1237
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:57,260
Hey, pass it. - Hey, Raju, come on.
- Give it to me.

1238
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,900
Throw it here.
- Pass it. - Fast..

1239
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,500
Hey!
- Hey!

1240
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,660
Hey, where is Sulla..

1241
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,700
Tell me! Hey, where is he?

1242
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,180
I don't know, sir.
- Why don't you speak up?

1243
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,180
Will you tell me or not?
- He didn't show up yet, sir.

1244
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,900
Where is Sulla?
- Sit down.

1245
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:17,020
Wait! They are here to start
a commotion.

1246
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,020
I'll take care of them.

1247
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,400
Hey, listen to me.
- Look, you don't know about them.

1248
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,320
I'll take care of them.

1249
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,200
Listen to me.

1250
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,120
Do not let him out until they
leave the college premises.

1251
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,600
Let me go.

1252
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,640
Go. Go!

1253
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,080
Move!

1254
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,520
Hey, where is he? Where
is Sulla? - I don't know, sir..

1255
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,360
Tell me. - I don't know, sir.
- Sir, we don't know.

1256
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,040
Doesn't anybody know?
Tell me.

1257
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,440
Hey, where is he? - Sir?
- Where is he?

1258
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,280
I don't know, sir.
- Where is he? Hey! - Hey!

1259
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,840
Leave the college immediately.
- Hey, where is Sulla?

1260
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,560
Listen to me,
you don't know about Sulla.

1261
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,720
Hey.
- Hey! - Hey!

1262
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,480
Get out!
- Hey. - Hey.

1263
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,240
Get out..
- Don't..

1264
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,520
Get out of here.
- Don't..

1265
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,360
Do not interfere!
- Leave! Hey..

1266
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,640
Hey, get lost.

1267
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,520
Don't do this. Listen to me.
- Get the hell out of here.

1268
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,720
Do not interfere.
- Hey, go!

1269
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,440
Listen to me..

1270
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,400
You saw that, right?

1271
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,840
No matter who it is,
if you interfere

1272
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,920
this will be the result.

1273
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,980
Listen to me.

1274
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,480
Tell him

1275
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,980
this is what's going to
happen to him very soon.

1276
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,280
Hey, come on.

1277
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,960
Let me go..
- Listen to us.

1278
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,760
Don't go.

1279
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:59,320
Hey, no one should
move an inch from here.

1280
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,280
Soori must come here
and I should kill him.

1281
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,640
We should be here until then.
Right here!

1282
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,720
We must stay here..

1283
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,080
Hey, what is this?

1284
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,080
Why are you creating a ruckus
with a dead body on the road?

1285
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,700
Who are you?
- Hey! - Hey!

1286
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,800
Dead body?
Is he a dead body to you?

1287
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:20,140
Don't interfere! Go!

1288
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:21,900
Listen to me.

1289
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,800
Go!

1290
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,420
Go!

1291
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,220
No one will go back alive
if he tries to interfere.

1292
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:37,020
Tell that scoundrel Soori,
to come here.

1293
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:38,580
He must come here.

1294
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,540
We need to personally
sort our issues.

1295
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:42,380
Go!

1296
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:44,260
Get lost!

1297
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,900
Come on, get going.

1298
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,940
Soori!

1299
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,540
Hey! Who..

1300
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:29,940
Me?

1301
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,260
Should I go and
bow down to him?

1302
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,700
I will..

1303
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,140
Don't do this.

1304
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,180
Try to understand why
I am telling you this.

1305
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:39,340
Hey, the whole city
listens to me.

1306
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,300
Should I listen to you now?

1307
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,580
Do not talk without
understanding me.

1308
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:44,700
Hey, I locked up
many men by myself.

1309
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,860
Are you going to lock me up now?

1310
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:49,300
Look, you should come and leave
as if that's your job.

1311
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:52,140
I'm not an idiot to do
everything you ask me to.

1312
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:53,140
Who the hell is he?

1313
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,100
He doesn't even have the muscle
to lift a rock

1314
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,300
why should I go there when
such guy asks me to?

1315
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,500
Hey!

1316
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:00,220
Why are you being adamant
when I'm requesting?

1317
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,420
You are being impossible
because I took money

1318
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,820
for personal expenses from you.

1319
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,460
Do as I say.

1320
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,460
You do not know about
police mentality.

1321
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,220
He's creating problems
in Gajuwaka as we speak.

1322
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,860
He is standing in the middle of
the road with the dead body.

1323
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:22,540
We have to lose our jobs if people
like you start killing people

1324
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,140
and refuse to cooperate with us.

1325
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,500
The traffic is jammed
in the whole city.

1326
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,540
If I do not take you down there

1327
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,980
not just the minister, even
God cannot save you after that.

1328
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,780
Yes.. Let's see what's
going to happen.

1329
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,100
Hey, what the hell can you do?

1330
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,460
What can you do?

1331
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,020
Thousands of students will come
and tear you apart.

1332
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,140
I'm telling this
for your own good.

1333
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,780
Just come there and stay
in the jail for a month.

1334
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,020
I'll arrange all the facilities
for you there.

1335
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,260
I'll help you get released
after that. Come on.

1336
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,340
Hey!
- Come..

1337
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,220
Come on..
- Soori, do not get mad.

1338
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,540
Come on.. I'm here. - Soori, stop.
- Come on. - Hey, stop him.

1339
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:50,540
Hey..
- Hey!

1340
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:54,140
Hey..

1341
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,540
Hey!

1342
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:59,700
Is Soori a great man?

1343
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,320
I'm going to butcher you,
I don't care who you are.

1344
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,520
It's me, Sulla.
Hey! - Hey..

1345
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,600
Hey, mister.

1346
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,320
Any criminal who's arrested by the
police will be taken to the jail.

1347
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,120
But since this is a problem
with the students

1348
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,040
we brought him here.

1349
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,600
We've arrested him
like you wanted, right?

1350
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,680
Now, leave this place.

1351
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:19,240
That's good for you and everyone.

1352
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,680
Come on.

1353
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,760
Listen to me. Come on.

1354
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,280
Come on. Sit inside.

1355
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,440
Sir, where will you
go at this time?

1356
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,560
Somewhere far away, dear.

1357
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,120
We have struggled all these days
to raise this guy.

1358
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,040
Now we are leaving our house
to save him.

1359
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,140
Can't be helped.

1360
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,900
We have to bear it no matter
how far or tiresome it is.

1361
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:39,260
Give that box.

1362
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,080
Dad..
- That's enough.

1363
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,080
Do not say a word.

1364
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,520
You stood on the road
for someone's death.

1365
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,640
If something were
to happen to you

1366
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,760
I cannot do the same for you.

1367
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,960
That's not it, Dad. Bharat was..

1368
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,800
I had many hopes on you.

1369
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,800
That's the mistake I made.
A very big mistake.

1370
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,400
I thought you would help this
family once you graduate.

1371
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,480
But you are guarding
a dead body.

1372
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,720
They'll destroy our family
if we stay here anymore.

1373
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,080
Hey, Sulla.

1374
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,200
It's fine if you are not helpful
to this family.

1375
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,920
We just want you to be alive.

1376
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,480
Come with us. Get in the lorry.

1377
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,160
Listen to me.

1378
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,240
Listen to me.

1379
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,280
Get in the lorry.

1380
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,480
Fast!

1381
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,160
Hey!

1382
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,720
"That's it, my boy!"

1383
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,920
"You are the best."

1384
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,960
"He's dancing
and it is awesome."

1385
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:26,040
"Hey, look at the
beautiful girl coming"

1386
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,120
"with her grace and charm
to teach you a lesson."

1387
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:32,040
"Look at her big eyes
shooting bows of love!"

1388
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:35,120
"Look at her big eyes
shooting bows of love!"

1389
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:41,200
"That's how I am, you naughty
boy. I am in the prime of my life."

1390
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,280
"That's how I am, you naughty
boy. I am in the prime of my life."

1391
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,120
"My tenacity brought fourth
my strength and allure."

1392
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,080
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1393
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,360
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1394
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,920
"I go crazy the more
I think of you."

1395
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,840
"I go crazy the more
I think of you."

1396
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,840
"I go crazy the more
I think of you."

1397
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:29,280
"Learn to play with
flowers and swings."

1398
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:35,440
"Do not hesitate to waste time
as I'm ready for anything."

1399
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,240
"Shall I teach you how to play?"

1400
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:41,440
"Shall I make the arrangements
for you to play?"

1401
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,280
"Shall I kiss you on your cheek?"

1402
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,280
"Shall I offer myself to you?"

1403
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:53,040
"Hey, come to me, my love!
The amazing girl I love."

1404
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:58,760
"If you do not do it,
I shall do it for you."

1405
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:02,360
"Look at her big eyes
shoot bows of love!"

1406
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,440
"Look at her big eyes
shoot bows of love!"

1407
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,640
"That's how I am, you naughty
boy. I am in the prime of my life."

1408
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,600
"My tenacity brought fourth
my strength and allure."

1409
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:14,480
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1410
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,520
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1411
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:53,560
"I cooked a meal for you
that will make you happy."

1412
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:59,440
"I brought you something
that will make you happy."

1413
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,840
"Hey, my love. Eat up quick."

1414
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,600
"I cannot be happy unless
you are satisfied."

1415
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,640
"You are like a beautifully
sculpted statue."

1416
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,520
"You are the one who grants
my wishes."

1417
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,000
"Hey, get lost, you idiot."

1418
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,400
"You wouldn't listen
to your well-wishers."

1419
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:23,640
"My beautiful lady,
I'm blown away by your beauty."

1420
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,800
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1421
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,840
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1422
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,480
"That's it, my boy!"

1423
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,000
"You are the best."

1424
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,600
"He's dancing
and it is awesome."

1425
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,920
"Hey, look at the
beautiful girl coming."

1426
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,960
"With her grace and charm
to teach you a lesson."

1427
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,760
"This desire of mine
is very dangerous."

1428
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,880
"Look at her big eyes
shooting bows of love!"

1429
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:37,120
Hey, didn't you open this book
at least once?

1430
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,260
Excuse me.

1431
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,420
Why did you come here?

1432
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:59,140
The milkmaid told me that you
moved from that house.

1433
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,920
So, to see..

1434
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,800
Do you like him?

1435
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,960
Yes.

1436
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:17,340
Our family is an insignificant one.

1437
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:21,980
It's very hard to include
one more person in it.

1438
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:25,620
If you care about his well-being

1439
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,720
please forget about him.

1440
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,560
It's good for him

1441
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,040
and for you too.

1442
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,640
You are educated.
I hope you will understand me.

1443
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,080
Sister.

1444
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,120
Take this, Sister.

1445
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,920
I lied to you for this, Sister.

1446
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,640
Believe me.

1447
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,160
I'll study, Sister.

1448
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,240
I'll protect this family
from now on, Sister.

1449
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,280
Please believe me, Sister.

1450
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,880
Hey, it's time for you to start
your work.

1451
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:56,880
'Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.'

1452
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,560
Where is Sulla?

1453
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,600
Do you think we can't find out
if you move to another place?

1454
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,800
Where is Sulla?

1455
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,920
Where is that idiot!
- What the hell did you say?

1456
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,800
Hey!

1457
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,440
Don't you know?
- I know.

1458
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,800
Then tell me.
- I won't.

1459
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,520
Hey, tell me.
- I won't.

1460
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,720
Won't you?
- Sulla!

1461
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,240
Dad.

1462
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,040
Dad.

1463
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,440
Where are you, Dad?

1464
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,600
I'll study, Dad.

1465
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,400
I won't fight with anyone, Dad.

1466
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,460
I'll listen to you, Dad.

1467
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,960
Dad, where are you?

1468
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,780
Dad!

1469
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,240
Get lost..

1470
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,340
There is no one to stop you now.

1471
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:52,300
For us,
he worked in this garbage

1472
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:54,500
and died here.

1473
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:56,020
Get lost! Look Here!

1474
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:58,380
Mom too will not live long
because of this pain.

1475
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,700
Why would I be alive after that?

1476
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,840
You can perform all our last rites
at once. Get lost.

1477
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,880
Go!

1478
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,880
"I became angry."

1479
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:31,160
"I became the bad guy."

1480
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:37,640
"I made the heaven my weapon."

1481
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:42,640
"I'm here to tear
this earth apart."

1482
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:49,360
"Time will become my wrath
and destroy you."

1483
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:59,760
"The evil will no more prosper
and push people into despair."

1484
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:10,400
"This last ride of my father
ruled capital punishment."

1485
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,760
"I took the responsibility
to destroy evil this moment."

1486
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:30,880
"The anger which will burn the
evil came out of me as tears."

1487
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:41,440
"The weight of my heart is
drowning me in hatred."

1488
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:49,480
"As you infuse the
strength in you"

1489
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,960
"as you destroy the evil"

1490
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,040
"as you filter this earth
again and again"

1491
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,680
"justice is be once
again resurrected."

1492
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,640
"With the power of all the Gods
under the cosmos"

1493
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:11,440
"I'll destroy the evil
in its very roots."

1494
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,160
Hey! Pay for that.

1495
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,120
Hey, what's with that look?

1496
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:02,000
'BAR'
- Hey, get lost.

1497
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,200
Hey!
- Come on.

1498
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,320
Hey, come on.

1499
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,000
What is this?

1500
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,320
Hey, let me go. - Take him away..
- I'll kill you all.

1501
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,820
Hey, let me go.

1502
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,240
Hey, let me go.

1503
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,160
Hey, Sulla..

1504
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:30,820
Go in.

1505
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:33,420
Do you think you are a rowdy..

1506
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:35,780
What is your name?
- Sulla.

1507
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,820
Sulla! Stupid! Go there.

1508
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:40,180
Go and sit there.
Sit down.

1509
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,900
Sit down.
Bring me the ledger.

1510
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:46,020
How long is his remand?
- 15 days sir.

1511
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,100
What's with that look?

1512
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,260
Hey, what is your name?

1513
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,580
I am asking you.
- Sulla.

1514
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:59,740
How old are you?
- 18.

1515
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:01,100
What is your father's name?

1516
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:02,940
Mani.
- Take him to his cell.

1517
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:20,300
Hey, keep walking.

1518
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,000
Go on.

1519
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,320
Hey, what are you looking at?

1520
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:09,680
Go in. Hey, get in.

1521
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,120
Soori, Sulla is in this jail.

1522
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,680
He came in today, right?

1523
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,560
I'll kill him in two days.

1524
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,720
I'll kill him here.

1525
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:36,620

02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,360

1542
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,240

1543
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,120

Somu?

1547
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,040
Soori? - Present, sir.

1548
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,880
- Hey! Idiot!

1549
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:20,340
Catch them.

1550
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:35,000
Others come to the prison
after they commit a crime.

1551
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,040
But I came here only to kill you.

1552
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:40,920
I'll kill you no matter how many
police try to get in my way.

1553
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:42,880
Yes,
as if that's going to happen.

1554
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:44,900
I'll break all your bones

1555
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,220
and bury you in this jail.

1556
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,600
Or else, I'll stop
considering myself a man.

1557
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:09,120
Hey, stop this fight.
Do it right now.

1558
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,520
Why did you come, Sister?

1559
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:00,960
Didn't you go to work?

1560
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,160
Why are you all looking
at me like that?

1561
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:10,440
Yes..
This court looks daunting.

1562
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,360
Red coloured building
and lawyers in black coats.

1563
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,640
Everyone seems to be moody,
Sister.

1564
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,800
There is an old man sitting inside
like our principal in college.

1565
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,000
He's a very good person.

1566
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,480
Everyone but him is speaking,
Sister.

1567
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,360
They are not letting him speak.

1568
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,240
Sister, did I kill someone?

1569
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,320
I didn't do it.

1570
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,880
But everyone says I did, Sister.

1571
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,480
I don't know anything.

1572
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,960
Sister, shouldn't I perform
dad's final rites?

1573
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,080
Why did he light father's pyre?
I was angry and so I hit him

1574
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,480
and he died.

1575
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,160
What can I do about that?

1576
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,840
These people will let me go
and I'll come back home.

1577
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,720
But dad won't come back, right?

1578
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,600
That's why.. I beat him..

1579
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,200
and de died.

1580
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:04,640
What can I do about that?

1581
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:07,740
Hey, if he comes at you
with a knife

1582
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:10,020
will you be scared?
- Why would I be scared?

1583
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:12,060
I'm not afraid.
- That's right!

1584
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:14,300
Why would you be afraid?
Our whole family is brave.

1585
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:16,660
Even the God we worship
carries a weapon.

1586
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:18,220
That's what influenced you.

1587
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:20,520
Why does God Shiva carry a trident

1588
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:21,360
God Vishnu bear a discus

1589
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:22,920
and Lord Human carry a mace?

1590
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,600
They are to punish anyone
who commits a crime.

1591
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,880
Hey, if it's a murder when Lord
Narasimha killed Hiranyakashapa

1592
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,080
then what you did
now is also a murder.

1593
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,000
Hey, if it's a murder when
Lord Krishna killed Narakasura

1594
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:34,140
then what you did
now is also a murder.

1595
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:37,440
Hey, if it's a murder when
Lord Rama killed Ravana

1596
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:38,980
then what you did
now is also a murder.

1597
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:41,040
Sir, is he a murderer?

1598
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,560
They eradicated the evil.

1599
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,120
Same way, what you did
is also eradication of evil.

1600
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,040
I appreciate you.

1601
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,040
Mom, come on.

1602
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,320
He'll come back.

1603
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,120
You'll be back soon.

1604
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:14,940
"It's not a great thing to die
for good."

1605
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:18,780
"There is nothing wrong in
killing to punish the evil."
