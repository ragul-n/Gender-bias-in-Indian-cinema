1
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,922
Cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol
are injurious to health

2
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,117
No animal was hurt
or wounded in this movie

3
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,798
RICHA GANGOPADHYAY

4
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,339
SANTHANAM

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,075
JITHAN RAMESH

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,938
SONU SOOD

00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,881
VIJAYAKUMAR,
NIZHAGAL RAVI, NASSER

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,621
REVATHI
SARANYA MOHAN

9
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,958
Hey, look there

10
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,366
Hey

11
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,777
I am going to run faster than you
and pick up the movie pass

12
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,858
Wow!! Superstar's movie...
please give me a pass

13
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,595
- Here, take it
- Please give me one as well

14
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,062
I can give only 1 per poster,
isn't he your brother?

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,726
He may be my brother,
but this is my Father's house

16
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,860
The Movie pass belongs to me,
give it to me

17
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,409
Why are you complaining about him
forjust a movie pass?

18
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,082
He is a silly guy

19
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,753
Your father treats both sons the same way

20
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:13,087
Is that why he's made me sweep
while he is reading his son's horoscope?

21
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,027
Why are you talking like this?
He is your Father

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,690
He is not my Father
He is that silly guy's Father

23
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,569
Hey Velu, mind what you are saying

24
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,831
Do you even understand his greatness?

25
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,768
Your father died when you werejust a baby

26
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,978
We were on the Streets,
when he gave us a lease of Life?

27
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,777
Your son is going to become a
Bigger Businessman than you are

28
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,717
- Really?
- Will be loaded with money

29
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,390
I am not saying this,
his charts are saying it

30
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,720
I had the same thought

31
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,386
He's not good at studies,
can you check on what to do

32
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,393
Let me check

33
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,727
He doesn't know a thing
He's innocent

34
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,198
Very impressionable

35
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,532
He's my son, just like you are

36
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,799
Whatever it is, he's your brother

37
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,341
He's not my brother, he's that Man's son

38
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,933
Can you check for any "Vasthu" remedies?

39
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,069
Please check my horoscope as well

40
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,080
You don't need the horoscope
to predict your future

41
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,548
Can tell by your Face, you will be useless

42
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,212
Can't you see he is going to be useless?

43
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,482
If you can read his horoscope,
can't you read mine as well?

44
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,490
You have the cheek to talk back to me?

45
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,164
Father, I am ready,
let's go watch the Movie

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,501
There's another half hour to go, all right

47
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,899
Music: THAMAN. S
I am going to watch the movie

48
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,775
Did you get slapped fortalking ill of me?

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,644
- Serves you right
- Father!!

50
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,718
Are you and your Father going to
watch a Movie after making me cry?

51
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,851
Go ahead now

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,522
Let me grow up and teach
the both of you a lesson

53
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,201
Nellai District
15 years later

54
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,551
Brother...

55
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,092
To preserve the Environment,
the Kerala Government

56
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,564
has strict orders against sand quarrying

57
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:41,037
Kerala's progress in the field of
Construction is thanks to Tamil Nadu

58
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,971
This has 15 millions

59
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:53,316
I am a CB CID Officer,
I am here to get you red-handed

60
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,584
I am proud to see
an honest Officer like you, but...

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:04,861
You shouldn't be around where I am...

62
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,603
Put him down here

63
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,611
You will be gone, if Boxer Daniel hits you

64
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,349
I have been a Thug and a Hit Man so far...

65
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,149
And now, I am also stepping in to Politics

66
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,019
This is no ordinary money

67
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,152
This money is going to make me
win the upcoming By Elections

68
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,561
I will finish anyone
who dares to stop this

69
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,161
Distribute 7.5 millions across
to the 14 villages by today

70
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,431
- Go on
- Yes Sir

71
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:14,522
AVehicle has just hit and run 2 Constables
at the Kattupakkam Check Post

72
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,124
Were you sleeping till this happened?

73
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,870
What?

74
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,138
Go find out what happened

75
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,008
- What happened?
- Look over there

76
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,419
- Hey, look, there's a Bullet
- What? A Bullet?

77
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,680
Show me

78
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,416
- My God!!! He's going to finish us
- What is he blabbering?

79
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,424
Don't know

80
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,886
Send 10-15 people
to the old factory at Kattupakkam

81
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,692
Don't know if we are going to return alive

82
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,029
Why are you asking for more people?

83
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,365
Do you know where we are? In Kattupakkam

84
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,029
- What now?
- There's a guy here

85
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,630
He may seem as small as this Bullet
But a big risk

86
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,834
If we get caught,
he'll beat us Black and Blue

87
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,501
Who's that?

88
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,509
Haven't you heard of "Sivaji, the Boss"?

89
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,910
Similarly, this guy is Osthe,
"Osthe the Mass",

90
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,379
Man of the Masses

91
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,782
His bullet has hit the Jeep now,
we could be next

92
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,377
His punch is fearsome
We'll be history if he gets us

93
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,117
Can't even imagine

94
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,388
Oh my God!! He is here
He's immortal

95
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,057
- Shut up! Go see, where he is coming from
- Yes, please check

96
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:05,235
You have the guts to point a gun at me?!

97
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:10,646
If you shoot me,
you'll be behind bars for 21 years

98
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:18,054
With the treatment you get there,
there will be nothing left of you

99
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:26,455
Think before you act
But I will act before you think

100
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,333
Are you scared?

101
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:37,205
I can kill you if I want to
Cause, I am like a Mirror

102
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,473
Smile and I'll smile back

103
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,548
Snarl and I'll snarl right back

104
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,742
And if you even THINK of shooting me
I'll shoot you before you think

105
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,772
You were singing his praises
He has fled after we got his gun

106
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,647
Hey Osthe, where are you?
Come out

107
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,983
- Don't shout, he might come back
- He has gone

108
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,115
Let's take the money back in his Jeep

109
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,786
Bring the money, you Dunces

110
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,332
Oh My God!
Where are these guys?

111
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,468
How did you get them
without the slightest sound?

112
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,133
Do you have a sound proof mechanism?

113
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,238
There was one more Man left...
Where is he?

114
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:41,262
These guys are violent,
your tricks won't work anymore

115
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:46,236
You've only seen a sample of me so far

116
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,104
Wait forthe Real Fight to unfold

117
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,508
The phone's ringing

118
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,521
Your ringtone's nice,

119
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,323
forward it to me after our fight

120
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,925
Why are you interrupting our dance?
Go home

121
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,332
- Why are you going up? Throw it to me
- No, come up

122
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,669
- Throw it to me
- We'll be caught

123
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,267
- Throw it, I'll take care
- Take it

124
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,076
Gosh! We're caught

125
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,890
Where's so much of money coming from?

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,560
We've worked hard for it...
The Sand Business

127
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,434
- Who did you cheat?
- Didn't cheat

128
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,838
Illegal Sand Quarrying
I can see

129
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,648
Fool, can't you hear the phone ring?
Answerthe phone

130
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,187
- I thought you would dance
- Answer the phone, you useless fellow

131
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,848
- Ok Sir
- Who's it?

132
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,583
My Mother

133
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,920
- Your Mother?
- Yes Sir

134
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,459
Don't make her wait

135
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,122
- Give my regards to her
- Yes Sir

136
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,395
- That reminds me
- Sir

137
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:34,803
I want to ask your Mother...
Why has she brought you up as a Thief?

138
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,602
- That's not possible
- Why?

139
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,142
She's not alive

140
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,338
Thought as much...

141
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,744
You would have been a good Man,
if she were alive

142
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,282
I do good even now,
this money is for distributing to people

143
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,947
- This cash is to bribe people
for elections, right? - Can say that

144
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,492
Wrong to give or take cash for votes

145
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:59,223
Even worse, to take that money
and not vote at all

146
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,026
I'll show you how to caste a Vote

147
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,301
This is my "Osthe" Vote...

148
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,700
This is why I warned you earlier

149
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,640
Now, this is the Fearsome punch

150
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,133
You're late in the first place,
and now the "slow motion"

151
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,068
Hurry up!

152
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,538
I welcome "Osthe" Velan's Police Force

153
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,142
We are called the Rapid Action Force,
why are you late?

154
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,542
We had a leakage on the way

155
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,080
We got delayed in setting it right

156
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,740
The Vehicle ran out of diesel, Sir

157
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,015
We pooled in all we had and filled
half a liter of diesel and rushed here

158
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,488
These many reasons for
the Police to reach late all the time?

159
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,891
Don't discuss our secrets in Public
They will lose fear

160
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,226
They have a terrible impression as it is

161
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:10,359
Talking about being terrible,
what is your Father in law up to?

162
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,438
That's a good question,
He does terrible things of course

163
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,241
Don't make me angry with your comedy

164
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,375
Where's the Thief? Where's the Thief?

165
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,844
They've run away

166
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,916
I struggled to give you that Lead,
and you've let the 'Accused' escape

167
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,451
We don't need them,
we've got their Money

168
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,181
Would have got a promotion
if we'd handed them over

169
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,519
- You just want a Promotion, don't you?
- Yes Sir

170
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,650
Good Morning,
Today's Headlines

171
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,527
Following a clash between the
Kattupakkam Police and Rowdies...

172
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,657
Constable Masanamurthy
was shot at by the Rowdies...

173
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,531
This is a Big Lie

174
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,197
I am hale and healthy,
standing right in front of you

175
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,008
- Does anyone else need a promotion?
- I don't need one Inspector

176
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,670
Give it to these two guys

177
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,341
They are not likely to run
after thieves to get one

178
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,283
Getting shot is their only chance

179
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:06,552
No Commissioner, IG, DIG has given
me a promotion...

180
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:11,288
Despite me begging for it
I am proud to get a promotion from you

181
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:16,425
Why over act?
You're getting an award anyway

182
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,696
Take care of your Hand
You might kick the bucket

183
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,899
Let me say just one thing

184
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,770
There's no controlling this guy,
shoot him on the other hand as well

185
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,711
You're no ordinary Police,
you're the Best Police

186
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,382
We're going to buy
4 new Jeeps with this money

187
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,387
Everything's going to be
brand new from now

188
00:17:54,573 --> 00:18:01,342
Tamil Nadu Cops are
the "Top" in the World... The Best

189
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:06,680
The way I load bullets...
Am the Best

190
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,084
Even in Bollywood
Or here in Kollywood

191
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,488
No one's seen a Robin Hood
Like me before

192
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,823
I steal from a Robber
Give it to the Poor

193
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,090
I am the Brave heart
who is ready for any Dare...

194
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:26,434
The Best Buddy "Osthe"
the Best Buddy "Osthe"

195
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:38,983
Tamil Nadu Cops are
the "Top" in the World... The Best

196
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:45,517
The way I load bullets...
Am the Best

197
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,943
Have you seen
Jackie Chan's 'Police Story'

198
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,414
If you have,
you'll get to know about me

199
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,749
The Rogue's bringing
in Loot money

200
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,415
But he's gonna get it
across to the poor and needy

201
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,892
He's not gonna accept
anyone's wrong doing

202
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,158
He'll make mince meat
out of them

203
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,632
And break their bones
if they do

204
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,293
I am the Inspector

205
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,961
I know to handle Encounters

206
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,302
I am an All Rounder Always

207
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,035
I'll take out the Revolver

208
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,169
Get hold of the Defrauder and
Wring his neck

209
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,042
I am your
Action Hero "Arnold"

210
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:49,383
The Best Buddy "Osthe"
The Best Buddy "Osthe"

211
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:01,728
Tamil Nadu Cops are
the "Top" in the World... The Best

212
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,079
Hey, our Hero's gonna
shake a leg, make way

213
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,550
He's going to paint
the town red

214
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,350
Hey, our Hero's gonna
shake a leg, check him out...

215
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:42,035
He's a "Terror" to a "Terror"
A "Friend" to a "Friend"

216
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,439
He Mirrors
who you really are

217
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,105
There's No one
like me here

218
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,445
No stone is going
to crack this Mirror

219
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,918
I'll never ever
know a Fear

220
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,320
My Luck is at an
all time High

221
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,914
Everyone will warn
you about me

222
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,584
They'll sing
my Praise

223
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,993
Just saying my Name
Will evoke Fear

224
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,397
There are Rowdies in Town
There are Police in Town

225
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,798
Do you have Rowdies
and Police in One?

226
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,134
Well, that's Me
The Best Buddy "Osthe"

227
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,734
The Best Buddy "Osthe"

228
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,815
Mother, why am
I not getting water upstairs?

229
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,818
There's been no
Electricity since yesterday

230
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,013
The Lineman says
it will be back only tomorrow

231
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,156
I'll get the water,
you have a shower and leave

232
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,625
Why are you doing all this,
where's your Son?

233
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,427
Nayanthara

234
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,499
Big dreams of "Nayanthara" all right

235
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,227
Hey! What?

236
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,826
Mom's toiling away, go help her

237
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,564
Why are you bothering him?

238
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,006
He's been working hard at the Mill
till 2 in the morning

239
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,804
Let him get a few more hours of sleep

240
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,742
Give that to me

241
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,138
Have you shifted the Mill
to "Ram" Theatre?

242
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,479
- You went to watch a movie, didn't you?
- I didn't go there to watch a movie

243
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,212
Went to watch the news reel on Ambani

244
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,620
- Went to learn ways of making it big in Life
- You?

245
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,352
- Have to work hard he says...
- I'll whack you

246
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,155
You went to watch the Movie
"Boss (A) Baskaran"

247
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,163
If you worked hard,
we wouldn't run the Mill on Debt

248
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,630
Good for Nothing

249
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,966
Yes, we are good for Nothing,
the Mill is on debt

250
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,633
I can't provide for the House
What to do?

251
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,701
You think only you're Responsible
You're on duty all the time

252
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,906
You earn money through many ways

253
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,040
Why don't you take care of things
around the house?

254
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,983
You could buy a Generator,
if you wanted to

255
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,250
It's not enough if you merely talk
about your Mothertoiling

256
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,447
Show it in action

257
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,789
I know what I need to do for my Mother

258
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,863
Cause, I know her from before
both of you did

259
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,525
Hey... Mind what you say

260
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,726
I know what I am saying

261
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,327
There's no concern here, It's just sarcasm

262
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,928
His son has become useless

263
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,736
Gosh! He has begun his lecture... Scoot

264
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:03,475
He's jealous that I have turned out to be
a young and vibrant Police Officer

265
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:08,485
You're all grown up,
but show no respect to Elders

266
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,819
I can respect You
But you don't know something

267
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,481
What?

268
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,494
If you add loads of oil to his food,
Just because he has an oil mill...

269
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,497
His cholesterol will shoot up
Reduce the oil to begin with

270
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,695
Debts will come down
So will the cholesterol

271
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,700
If he kicks the chair, I'll kick him
Get up

272
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,101
I will buy a generator for sure

273
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,237
Not for the comfort of your Father or you

274
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,316
But for my Mother's comfort

275
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,855
My spare keys are with Mom, take money
from her and go buy a Generator

276
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,916
Don't sleep while I am talking to you

277
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,856
Didn't want to have a bath today...

278
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,191
But it's my fate that
I have to at your hands

279
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,663
- I am ill fated too
- Why?

280
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,927
I have to bathe a Buffalo like you

281
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,263
Government Medical College
and General Hospital

282
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,537
The tyres might wear out even before
we get past 400 Kms...

283
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,205
What's your problem, did you pay for it?

284
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,681
Let him do whatever he wants

285
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,274
This was bought with robbed money

286
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,411
- We can replace it as it wears out
- Only the tyres I hope

287
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,417
What's are you saying?

288
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,427
You're the First Policeman
to have robbed from a Robber...

289
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,363
and use that money to buy a Jeep
forthe department

290
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,095
You're the Best...
The Best Police

291
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,693
Now we don't have to arrive late

292
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,764
We can get there one reel before
the Climax and nab thieves

293
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,505
Talking about thieves, where is
your brother these days

294
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,309
- Last week, the Ambasamudram bank...
- He robbed that Bank?

295
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,713
No, they gave him a job as a Guard

296
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,512
A Thief gets to Guard the place...

297
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,644
Just the way we got Police jobs

298
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,589
- Hey Masanamurthy, are the nurses good?
- Excellent Sir

299
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,131
Were you enquiring about me
or asking about the Nurses?

300
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,204
- Weren't you looking at them?
- My woes are mine to deal with

301
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,330
I am struggling to do
everything with one hand...

302
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,068
Don't do anything for a change

303
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,406
We were asking you about the nurse

304
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,879
This man talks too much...
You should have shot him a little lower

305
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,677
- Lower where? - Lowered the gun and
shot you on your legs

306
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,478
- Greetings Sir
- Greetings, who are you?

307
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:25,352
- She's my wife
- Sir, take this

308
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,015
Give it to the other Policemen

309
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,685
Has the Government sanctioned
the money already?

310
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,227
This is not Government money

311
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,229
I am giving you this from what
I grabbed from the robbers

312
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,630
The Government'll give you Rs 50,000
if you get hurt and Rs 1 lakh if you die

313
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,227
But our Osthe sir, will give you Rs 1 lakh
if you're hurt and Rs 5 lakhs if you die

314
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:44,104
The Government will hand over Rs 1 lakh
to your wife only after you die

315
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,574
But I am giving you this
while you are alive

316
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,440
Do you want 5 lakhs or will this do?

317
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,243
- Rs 1 lakh is fine for us
- You hold your life dear I can see

318
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,647
Fine, get back to work in a week

319
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,585
Give the money to your wife,
not to the nurse

320
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,782
How can you get back to work in a week?

321
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,654
He'll say things like that,
but he is a very good man

322
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,921
A little different, but the Best!!

323
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,462
My God!!! So much money

324
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,739
We can buy generators
for the whole Town

325
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,935
Why did you come here?
This is his Department money

326
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:21,942
Here, take this

327
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,406
This is for the Generator,
what me?

328
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,680
What? Do you want a commission
from your own home?

329
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:34,282
So what? There's a lot of work
involved in buying this

330
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,826
Your brother has asked me to
give you only this, ask him for more

331
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,829
Is he the only son you have?
Am I not one too?

332
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:45,096
He hurts me with talk like this,
why are you up to the same thing?

333
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,299
You're very partial to him
You like him more than you like me...

334
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,840
That's enough

335
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,176
Take this

336
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,386
Hey, watch it

337
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,399
There are people around

338
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,093
Hurry up, quick

339
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,099
What?

340
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:24,397
Get down!!

341
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,604
- Why are you restless?
- It's my Father

342
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,202
Whoever it is...
I'll kill them

343
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,746
You'll kill me?

344
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,816
How many have you killed before this?

345
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,477
You watch movies and stupidly
think you can do all this?

346
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,144
Who's Stupid?

347
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,484
Don't get me angry,
The earth will tremble,

348
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,357
- There'll be a downpour
- Uh oh!

349
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,555
Nothing seems to be happening

350
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:57,692
So what? I got misled by the
weatherforecast on TV...

351
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,965
Don't pursue my daughter
in the name of love,

352
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,231
You can't marry my daughter

353
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,708
Your father wants
to get you married someone

354
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,041
who will give a dowry of Rs 1.5 millions

355
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,910
I don't have so much money

356
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:15,850
- Don't bother us, get going
- Are you threatening me?

357
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,048
He's acting too smart...
Shall I finish him?

358
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,120
Kill me, come on

359
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,594
Get going, go talk to your dad
with the same fervor

360
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,721
We'll see what happens

361
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,059
Foolish Girl!

362
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,930
I've told you this is not going to work out
You never listen

363
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,003
You embarrass me...
Let's go

364
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,809
The sweets

365
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,888
Party Office

366
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,693
Money hasn't reached
the People of Kattupakkam

367
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,567
Haven't heard from the Guys
who have taken it there

368
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,503
Can win only
if the money reaches

369
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,509
Find out what happened
to those idiots

370
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,579
Why the hell are they
not answering the Phone?

371
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,750
What are they doing
when the money's with them

372
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,445
Don't understand

373
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,457
Money has to be distributed
amongst those people by today

374
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,996
I'll rip all of you apart
if that doesn't happen

375
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,592
That's why we are scared to
answerthe phone

376
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,466
We can't leave without
handing over the money

377
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,005
Go... Find out where
the Inspector lives

378
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,733
Looks like I'll be dead

379
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,937
Where is Inspector
"Osthe" Velan's house?

380
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,015
- Hey Selvam
- Tell me Old Man

381
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,015
He's enquiring about Velan Sir's house

382
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,880
Yes, tell me! Velan Sir's house is
not up for Sale

383
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,147
There's some land available
near the Cremation Ground

384
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,688
Is he interested?

385
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,089
- He wants to know the Address
- Oh, that

386
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,094
Why do you need it?
Do you need to deliver anything?

387
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,164
He had come to see my sister
to seek her hand in marriage...

388
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,495
Your Sister!?

389
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:14,038
Didn't your dad give up
on life after having you?

390
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,901
I look like this,
but my sister is pretty...

391
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,568
- Like a parrot...
- Cage her then

392
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,441
- Why do you want to get her married?
- Why are you getting angry?

393
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,175
- Please tell me the address
- Sure

394
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:29,720
I'll tell you
Do one thing

395
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,855
Take a right from here,
you'll get the Sivan temple,

396
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,859
take a left and a right from there,
you'll find a Construction there

397
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,725
Again, take a left and then a right,
you'll find a shop,

398
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,459
It's opposite to that
That's right

399
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,057
Get lost

400
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:01,180
- Take a right, you Dunce
- Do you know it or not?

401
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,983
I know the address, shut up

402
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,388
Just go

403
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,788
Listen to what I am saying
Don't take my Life

404
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,857
Here we are!!!
The Shop on the right...

405
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,126
On the left...

406
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,132
Welcome buddies, come look
around the Groom's house

407
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,675
You can see an
old black telephone, a Globe,

408
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,404
Half a Dozen Rifles
that don't shoot,

409
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,207
Ajail with an attached shower...

410
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,544
- Come look around
- Who did you enquire with?

411
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,608
With the Policeman
who is giving us a warm welcome

412
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,210
- With him?
- Yes, of course

413
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:42,817
Your in laws have come to see you,
Please come here and meet them

414
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,760
You pushed us from
the frying pan to the fire, let's run

415
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,230
The thin ones move to the right

416
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,099
The heavier ones to the left

417
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,967
The ones who are fit,
come with me

418
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,641
No one to come with me?

419
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,911
There was so much excitement here,
where are they?

420
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,641
- Have they all left?
- What do we do then?

421
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,717
- Let's rush back with the same excitement
- Yes, let's rush

422
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,785
Move aside

423
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,937
- Go fast
- Follow me

424
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,474
He is chasing us

425
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,313
Hey stop!!
He doesn't seem scared of a Gun

426
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,387
Why has Osthe Frozen?

427
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,322
He's probably facing some
potent Weapons on the other side

428
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,520
- Hey Ins... Inspector...
- Yes... are they caught?

429
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,859
Not that easy
to get your hands on them

430
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,862
They're flying around like
the Ghosts in "Van Helsing"

431
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,730
Shoot below the feet...

432
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,667
Below the feet... Where? On the Ground?

433
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,399
Fine, I'll go this way
and you go the other...

434
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,873
Let's see if we can get someone
Hey... Stop

435
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:45,075
The whole street is abuzz with
a clash between the Police and Rowdies...

436
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,878
There's a shoot out too

437
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:50,613
Won't you bolt the door
before you button up?

438
00:34:52,123 --> 00:35:01,555
If public like you get hurt in this Crossfire,
this Cop won't be able to handle it...

439
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,502
- Well... are you married?
- No

440
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,366
- Are you by yourself?
- No

441
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,373
- Then?
- My Father's with me...

442
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,239
Father... Hmmm
Let it be

443
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,371
- What's your father doing?
- He's sleeping

444
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,248
Let him sleep
And when he's awake...

445
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,185
- Is he on the look out for a Match for you?
- No

446
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,451
A great Father!
God's Great!

447
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,392
I am in awe of
your courage

448
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,589
This Cop is heading
to do his duty

449
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,128
You are chasing Me!?

450
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,138
- Why?
- Who's on the phone?

451
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,401
My Girlfriend

452
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,008
Your Girlfriend
will be around... But

453
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,815
He has embarrassed me...

454
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,813
This Youthful, Beautiful,
Flourishing, Proud

455
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,681
Country of ours... I am going to defend it

456
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:15,089
I am not going to forgive those
who corrupt us with cash for votes...

457
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:20,494
That is such a powerful dialogue,
and you deliver it so meekly

458
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,558
I will uphold the
welfare of this Country...

459
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,235
- He's dead...
- No, he has fled

460
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,707
Yes, he has...

461
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:38,714
You're staring at her as though
you have never seen a girl before

462
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,113
You've wasted bullets

463
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,377
You missed your target

464
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:47,657
I might have missed it this time
I won't next time

465
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,125
I will definitely
safeguard this country...

466
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,720
However you want to do it,
you figure it out yourself

467
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,265
- Let's go now
- I will... most certainly...

468
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,928
Come on, let's go

469
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,932
Vote for me

470
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,874
Looks fabulous!!

471
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:13,412
You helped me sort out problems
with my wife's property at Thenkasi

472
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,417
I will support
you in all ways

473
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,282
You are sure to win

474
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,879
Why are you talking like
a stranger, Collector?

475
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,357
- Say you will make me win
- Daniel, they've come

476
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,897
How did you lose the money?

477
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,627
Didn't answerthe phone,
What about the money?

478
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,897
- There's a guy there...
- Who's it?

479
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,904
Daniel, stop it

480
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,442
They've lost the money
kept for Elections

481
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,976
- They should be killed
- Be patient

482
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,639
Don't lose your
calm till the elections are over

483
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,912
- You're not a Boxer now,
you're an MLA Candidate - So what?

484
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:55,447
Do you want me to plead with them,
the way I plead for votes? Fine

485
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,188
I need that Rs 7.5 millions now
What do we do?

486
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,265
- Where's this guy from?
- He's the Inspector from Kattupakkam

487
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,732
He's "Osthe the Mass",
just like "Sivaji the Boss"

488
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,735
People vote forthose they like

489
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,204
- But this guy votes forthose he doesn't
- Shut up

490
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,868
Why are you worried
when I am the Collector?

491
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,141
Such money has to be handed
overto my Office within 2 days

492
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,148
He's only an Inspector after all

493
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,742
- Let me give him a run for his money
- Wait till the money reaches me

494
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,758
When planetary positions
are looking good...

495
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,353
Yes, looking good...

496
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,376
Why is she wearing anklets on her waist?

497
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,241
Angels normally appear in the sky, but

498
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,779
This one is walking down the Road

499
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:54,977
You have the cheek to belt out poetry?

500
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,327
Sorry Sir, I called her
an Angel by mistake

501
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,995
- She's all set to get drunk
- Congratulations Inspector

502
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,473
You've found
a perfect partner for yourself

503
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:26,073
If not anything else, she can be your
drinking buddy after your Marriage

504
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:33,089
Am sure you want to stand up against
such cultural disintegration

505
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,954
Isn't your heart springing
to protect this youthful

506
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,224
Country Lass, I mean Country...

507
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,823
Aren't you dying to uphold
the welfare of this Country?

508
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,631
- How right you are!!!
- Keep quiet

509
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,038
Who's pouring water on me?

510
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,372
- Get up!
- Oh, it's you

511
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,380
Get up, why do you do
this all the time?

512
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,043
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali,
why did you pour water on me?

513
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,643
I am no longer on a High

514
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,882
Give me my drink

515
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,824
- He mixed too much water in it
- Just leave it! Come with me

516
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,556
Who's covering my face?
Neduvaali, leave me

517
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,962
- Neduvaali
- Just come with me

518
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:20,298
- Buy me a drink
- Who is this Alien?

519
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,837
Hey! Come here

520
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,375
Oh my God!! There's a Police Raid

521
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,774
- You go away
- He doesn't know the difference between

522
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,779
A government liquor shop and
an illegal arrack store

523
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,854
Give a complaint

524
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,119
What's the trouble?

525
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:49,389
Whatever it is,
this Cop will punish whoever is guilty

526
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,196
- Who is he?
- My Father

527
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,395
Oh!!

528
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:59,932
This horrible looking man has
such a beautiful daughter?!

529
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,205
He probably adopted her

530
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,678
Your investigation is on the right track

531
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,272
Go away

532
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,010
He kept saying "Neduvaali"...
what does that mean?

533
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,952
- Don't know...
- So, "Don't know" is what it means

534
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,954
- I said I don't know the meaning
- Let it be

535
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,558
A Drunk man has such a Desirable daughter!

536
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,495
- Hey!
- Yes

537
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,231
Such a Beautiful daughter and
a pitiable father like this

538
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,237
Unbelievable!!!

539
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,568
You have to believe it Inspector

540
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,440
This is the pathetic situation
with most beautiful girls

541
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,912
Talking about pathetic, I thought
he'd ask about your mother in law...

542
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,441
Don't make me angry with your comedy

543
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,316
Hey Send 40 tins to Murugesan's shop

544
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,721
37 to Gani Bhai's...

545
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,455
- Dad
- What is it?

546
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,055
I need to talk about something important,
and you're only talking about the Mill

547
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,657
What's more important than the mill?

548
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,930
Think about my Marriage

549
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,070
What's there to think about?

550
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,741
Speak to Nirmala's Dad and
get me married to her

551
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,076
What's your problem now?

552
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,677
I am working hard only
to give you a good future

553
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,752
You have been lazy,
but now you ask me about yourfuture?

554
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:22,220
Hey, this Mill doesn't run on electricity
It runs on debt

555
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,489
I have to offset the debts
with the dowry I get for you

556
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:29,555
And you want to pursue that
penniless girl in the name of love!

557
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,100
Can I not marry the girl I like?

558
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,296
I'll beat you black and blue

559
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,442
I decide your Life and Marriage

560
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,902
Do you even know anything about Life?

561
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:49,382
I have to set this place right and
then hand it over to you...

562
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,976
Only then can you
start living your Life

563
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,655
Shut up until then

564
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,789
Listen to me or else...

565
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:01,997
Go deliverthese items
and then call me

566
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,069
Nirmala sweetie

567
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,403
Now you give me one...

568
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,944
Let that be,
we still have last week's due

569
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:25,083
Am here to sing a song...
Am here to buy a pot...

570
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,156
You've left the store unmanned

571
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:33,161
If there's a theft,
this Cop will have to be answerable

572
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,424
- What do you want?
- A pot

573
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:41,093
- How much is it?
- Rs 250

574
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,438
She seems a bigger Robber than I am

575
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,647
I don't have change

576
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,977
It's fine
Give it to when

577
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,449
I come shopping the next time

578
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,262
The Pot looks nice...

579
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,141
I asked forjust one,
what's this?

580
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,679
I don't like being indebted
Let this be with you

581
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,407
I'll take it back
when I return the money

582
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,415
I am in awe of your sincerity

583
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,414
Will see you

584
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,816
Spent Rs 500 just to
say a few words...

585
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,623
Well, let me spend another 500 Rupees

586
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,296
Not my money anyway

587
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,560
Sorry, it slipped

588
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,303
Look at that

589
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,382
Take this

590
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,181
I don't take money
for accidents likes this

591
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,518
I am amazed by your Principles

592
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,659
But the loss is yours
Don't be stubborn, else

593
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,126
I might have to slap you

594
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:16,325
A Slap doesn't scare me Sir,
only Love does...

595
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:46,418
Hey... It's because of You
That the World spins around

596
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:54,695
Hey... It's through your Eyes
That the Rainbow touches me

597
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,169
Back then, I yearned to see an Angel

598
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,040
And now on seeing You,
that yearning is fulfilled

599
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,773
The Clouds rained Petals then

600
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,443
And now, it's just your thoughts
that drizzle on me

601
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:14,047
Hey... It's because of You
That the World spins around

602
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:30,130
She's got a generous heart
She's giving you a place in it

603
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,008
There's thoughts of you, dreams too
She's melting away thinking of you

604
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:47,348
Oh my! I can't put on
an act in a dream

605
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:52,156
Where is this going to lead to
Love is overflowing here

606
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,629
If you don't set your
glance on me

607
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,223
There's no reason to live
If I don't get to talk about you

608
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:04,035
I need no company,
I don't even need myself

609
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,837
Back then, I sauntered
around town all day long

610
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,572
But now, your smile
makes me saunter around You

611
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,313
I'd strike any guy back then,
But now, I am struck by Love

612
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,253
Hey... It's because of You

613
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,612
Oh No... My Heart

614
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,953
Wants to get lost,
just to find You everyday

615
00:49:55,058 --> 00:50:00,496
Here, Now
Everything seems Divine

616
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:05,967
Hey, What do I say
I see you in Everything

617
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,697
There's no Dagger, no Wound

618
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,706
Yet you kill without uttering a Word

619
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,572
Back then, I yearned to see an Angel

620
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,306
And now on seeing You,
that yearning is fulfilled

621
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,110
The Clouds rained Petals then

622
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,777
And now, it's just your thoughts
that drizzle on me

623
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,514
Back then, I sauntered
around town all day long

624
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,318
But now, your smile makes me
saunter around You

625
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:35,126
I'd strike any guy back then,
But now, I am struck by Love

626
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:42,195
Hey... It's because of You
That the World spins around

627
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:48,734
Hey... It's through your Eyes
That the Rainbow touches me

628
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,289
Let "Osthe" Velan come
Will call once I get the money

629
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,360
He's here
I'll take care

630
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,826
I thought we'd have
a good looking Collector,

631
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,294
like Arvind Swamy in "Thalapathi"

632
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,024
But he looks like a hawker
on the street

633
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,425
Come in

634
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,970
Don't dig into it

635
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,440
- The Biriyani will get spoilt
- Biriyani!?

636
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,704
Yes, we've boughtjust 10 packets

637
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,838
There was a complaint
about it the last time

638
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,382
- Where's the money?
- It's safe

639
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,577
This is for us

640
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,917
- And this for you... Rs 10,060
- Is that all there is?

641
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,322
I can give it to the beggar
and get them all as change

642
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,917
Why are you fooling around,
they said it is 7.5 millions

643
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,521
- Whoever told you that?
- The Informer did...

644
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,862
The same Informertold us as well

645
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,334
We were happy at
the thought of nabbing them

646
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,929
And getting an Award
for our bravery as well

647
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,068
- But he backstabbed us
- This is exactly how we reacted

648
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,476
We were thoroughly disappointed

649
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,142
We had an egg on our face,
just like you did now

650
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,411
Even if it's just 10 Rupees,

651
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,544
We're duty bound to hand it
over to the Collector

652
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:09,284
Oh yes, keeping Government money
with you is like skating on thin Ice

653
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,950
It might slip away

654
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,121
Now we are at peace,
can we take leave?

655
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,730
- Sir... Don't touch that
- Why?

656
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,529
We forgot an important detail

657
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,661
2300 for damage to the Check post

658
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,070
1500 for Diesel, 3500 for the Hospital

659
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:31,671
2759 forAllowances and Biriyani,
that's 10,059

660
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,806
That's the 1 Rupee balance

661
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,749
You could return this 1 Rupee
to the Government...

662
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,754
Or use it to for a Toss...
It's your choice

663
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,217
- We'll get going
- The Biriyani seems spoilt

664
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:49,560
Vote for Daniel

665
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,639
- Daniel, phone
- Who is it?

666
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,571
- The collector
- What's it?

667
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,233
He's no ordinary guy

668
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,712
He's citing rules and
is playing games with me

669
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,045
Bring the RC Book

670
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,992
Who's that?

671
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,196
He's "Osthe" Velan
Greetings Sir

672
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,598
- He is a candidate from our area
- So?

673
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,466
Check the Vehicle

674
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,337
I haven't come in to your limits
for you to check me

675
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,204
But you have come
in to my territory

676
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,744
What? Have I come
in to yourterritory?

677
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:40,416
Osthe doesn't have any limits!!!
It's unlimited access

678
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,486
Wherever in the world it could be

679
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:46,818
Where's the money
you took from my Men?

680
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,481
I have given the Accounts
to the Collector

681
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,288
Didn't the collectortell you?

682
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,827
I am not talking about what you gave him

683
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,489
I am asking about what you
took... Rs 7.5 millions

684
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,166
That's not just cash, they are Votes

685
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,704
I didn't cheat you
I caste my vote on your Man

686
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,297
Each vote of mine
is equal to a 10,000 votes

687
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:09,502
- Didn't you show him my Vote?
- I did even then

688
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,577
Isn't it enough?

689
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,981
Do you want me
to caste a vote on yourface?

690
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,576
- Hey!
- I am ready

691
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,120
You will cast a Vote on my Face?

692
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:22,658
I never bothertalking
to a policeman

693
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:27,662
I am talking to you cause
I am in the role of a Politician

694
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:32,133
I have concealed
the arrogance I am capable of

695
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,135
I have many sides to me

696
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,802
You won't be able to handle
all of them...

697
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,745
You can show me any side to you...
I am like a mirror

698
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,080
What you show is
what you get

699
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,153
I will show you...

700
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,346
That reminds me

701
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,222
You said your brother in law has
gone mad, did the Doctor see him?

702
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:00,160
Oh yes...

703
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:09,962
Look at how energetic he is...
That's "Osthe" for you...

704
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,445
I've handled Guns easily

705
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,714
But handling a Kitchen is quite difficult

706
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,323
Why don't you eat in peace
at least today?

707
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:33,724
How long will you cater
to the needs of everyone?

708
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,663
I have an idea for
this situation to change

709
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,794
The Government has
allotted a house for me

710
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:45,204
You can lead the life
of a Queen there

711
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,275
What about your
Father and Brother?

712
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,003
There you go

713
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,937
You worry about them
all the time

714
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,209
But they don't seem one bit
worried about you

715
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:55,284
Stop it

716
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,216
As a son, you can say
anything you please

717
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,687
As a mother, I can't differentiate
between the two of you

718
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:04,884
The family cannot be split in to two

719
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:10,694
Fine! If I come with you,
who will take care of the other two...

720
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,893
Mother...
Where is it?

721
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:18,234
Can't you keep this
small thing by your side?

722
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,365
Here, take it

723
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,245
Go slow... Watch it

724
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,721
You fall sick whenever
we talk about the family...

725
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,388
Hey, come here

726
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,656
Should I give you a suggestion
to improve things in the family?

727
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,388
Why don't you get him married?

728
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:42,329
This is the Best idea
he has given so far

729
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,196
- Fix the wedding date...
- Hurry

730
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,064
Date for the Wedding!!!!
Whack him

731
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,604
He says mindless things,
do you want to add to it?

732
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,607
How can we get the younger one
married, when the older one is around?

733
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,678
- So, you were only joking about me
- Get out

734
00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:00,348
There's just one way out, why don't you
get the elder one married?

735
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,419
- Who? - Your husband, Subbaiah Pillai,
get him married

736
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,425
- I am going to kill you
- Come on...

737
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,560
Chandramouli
Mr. Chandramouli...

738
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,834
Chandramouli,
Mr. Chandramouli...

739
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,372
- Hey, who's Chandramouli?
- Your father

740
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,702
His name is Thanga Perumal

741
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,505
- This is how Karthik would call out
- Karthik?

742
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,977
- In the film "Mouna Ragam"
- Gosh!

743
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,513
Forget that, let's leave...

744
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,574
My father has just gone to the
fields, will be dead if he's back

745
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,584
He's not going to come now,
he's at the Village Council...

746
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,124
Just saw him there

747
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,990
Why are you creating trouble
when there's no one home?

748
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,791
This is the best time to take you away

749
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:49,865
What are you saying?

750
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,662
I heard your father is looking
out for another Match for you

751
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,929
Let's elope!!

752
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,800
- I can't
- Why?

753
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,203
Where will you take me?
To your House right?

754
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,808
Your dad's not going to accept
me without the money

755
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,071
Do you think we can't
live in peace there?

756
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,946
Let me give you an idea

757
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,814
Why don't you talk to your
brother about this?

758
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,679
To my brother?

759
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,276
He'll shut my dad up

760
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,221
He'll be happy
if I am in trouble

761
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,488
I'll never ever ask him for a favor...

762
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,159
Don't even think about it

763
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,492
Are you going to come with me now?

764
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,626
I want our wedding to be accepted
by both sides of the family

765
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,303
Figure out a way for that

766
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,505
- Is this your decision?
- Yes

767
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,040
Is there a chance you'll
change your mind?

768
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,046
No, No, No

769
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:04,397
Why are we wasting time here,
might as well go plead for votes

770
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,941
'Osthe' Velan has
hijacked our plans

771
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,877
We have come here
to plot his End

772
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,948
Why is he here?
He's your sworn enemy

773
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:26,358
Either you should survive or I should

774
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,898
Don't throw your weight around in
front of "Annachi", show some respect

775
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:35,562
If you want to pay heed to my word,
hang in here, else go away

776
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,240
- I asked him to come here
- I don't understand

777
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,573
I sent word through
'Harbor' Arunachala Annachi

778
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,579
I have reached

779
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,649
Why?

780
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,381
Annachi told me... what should I do?

781
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,451
Need to kill an Inspector

782
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,322
What are you thinking about?

783
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,662
You've done this yourself,
why do you need me?

784
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,533
I can't do this,
I am a Politician now

785
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,198
Everyone knows we are enemies

786
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,401
No one will get you,
if I kill him... right?

787
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,810
Nor will you get caught...
I trust your work

788
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,214
You've assessed
your enemy quite well

789
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:26,418
You have around 17l18 Cases
filed on you

790
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,820
Including the 2 of
trying to kill me

791
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,620
I'll annul them once
I get to power...

792
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,294
- What do you say?
- Done

793
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:37,025
You've become a True Politician

794
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,732
- Hit him
- Here you go

795
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,845
Stop it,
Why are you hitting him?

796
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:50,776
You want to know why?

797
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,006
Constable No: 113

798
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,248
Your drunk father
went to the pawn broker

799
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,342
And pestered him to lend
money against his footwear

800
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,011
The Pawn broker fled the place

801
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,248
Constable No: 710

802
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,087
Your father put his head
in front of the Road Roller

803
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:07,185
Protesting for Liquor shops
to be kept open all night

804
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,160
That's not all

805
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,495
Your father robbed biscuits
from school going children

806
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:14,934
Do I have the looks of a Robber?

807
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,268
You don't look like the Owner of
Blackberry phones either

808
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:22,567
We can file any case against you
Your looks will suit it all

809
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,049
You are charging me falsely
And bringing me disrepute among people

810
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,881
You aren't some well known man
like Anna Hazare for me to do this

811
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:32,750
You bring a bad name to yourself

812
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,154
- My father would have done no wrong
- You're right

813
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,317
Please leave him

814
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:40,123
Whether girls know to make
or coffee or not

815
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,390
They can sure cry in an instant

816
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,554
Stop it girl

817
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:49,300
- Why are you crying?
- Oh, watch it

818
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,474
You want us to leave your father,
is that all?

819
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,510
This Cop takes something
before he gives away anything

820
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:02,307
You are asking for something...
What can I take from you?

821
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,749
Fine!!
Smile and I'll let him go

822
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:11,452
I only asked you to smile,
not sing a Duet with me

823
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,419
Hey constables

824
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:18,227
Whoever gets her to smile gets a
reward of Rs 1000

825
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,631
Wow, Rs 1000

826
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,161
You anyway scrounge
for small amounts outside

827
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,102
You're getting Rs 1000,
go for it

828
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,176
Smile...

829
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,800
That everlasting smile

830
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,539
You have got a horrible smile

831
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,478
Why are you scaring her with it?
She is frowning as it is

832
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,910
Why didn't the parrot fly away?

833
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,177
Don't you know?
Let me explain

834
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,586
Because, the parrot is
in a photograph

835
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,284
You better come back

836
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,192
He must be the guy who provides
bad jokes to Magazines

837
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,829
If you permit me...

838
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,599
There're different ways
a drunken man walks...

839
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,331
A man who's had one drink

840
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,074
Was that correct?

841
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,874
A man who has had a full bottle...
Put a full stop to this

842
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,849
Don't get us angry with your comedy

843
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,351
This is what he does everyday,
this is no comedy

844
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:15,287
Hey, Neduvaali means "lguana",
She's a tough girl

845
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,621
My daughter will smile
if I sing

846
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:28,535
My dear flower, Shenbagam,
My dear "Santhanam"

847
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,866
He's trying to make fun of my name!!

848
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,904
He's braying like a donkey

849
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,877
Come on girl, smile, let go
Don't hold on like an Iguana

850
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,775
You stay here

851
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,778
Neduvaali, Listen to your Father,
we'll get

852
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:42,908
Rs 1000, can buy
myself 16 drinks with that

853
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,549
Come on, Smile

854
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,383
Hey Inspector,
you imitate me quite well

855
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,960
- She has smiled at last
- Time for a song

856
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:11,406
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali

857
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,678
You hold my heart
in a tight clasp like an Iguana

858
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,080
Never letting go of me

859
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:20,485
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali

860
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:25,926
You're slowly taking away
a part of me

861
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:34,629
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

862
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,262
It's gonna be a Blast

863
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:41,399
The girl's gonna blow you
away with her glance

864
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:48,279
She's got gorgeous hair
We're awe struck by her Beauty

865
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:57,258
Two beautiful Pearl like eyes
You'll be way laid by her Charm

866
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:04,357
I want to talk to you, but when I see you,
I go berserk, I melt in my passion for you

867
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:08,631
Awe struck by his Charm,
you would want to worship him

868
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,605
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

869
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,975
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

870
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,710
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

871
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:27,221
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

872
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:31,987
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali

873
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,672
It's gonna be a Blast

874
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,945
You had the neighborhood
under your control

875
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,248
But now, You've lost
Control of yourself

876
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:03,849
My eyes would never miss a Target before
But I am blinded by your love now

877
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:12,766
He's Brave, He's Intelligent
Hard to beat this combination

878
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:17,329
The Cop is Lost...
Lost in Love

879
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,874
Let's file a complaint

880
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:24,239
Find a soul who can bring
back this Lost Cop right away

881
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:29,080
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

882
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:33,315
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

883
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:38,291
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

884
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:42,797
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

885
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:47,460
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali

886
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,916
He has lost his sleep
because of her

887
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,185
He has no appetite but for her

888
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,522
There's no more room
for Midnight Patrols

889
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,653
You're frozen in your room
with only thoughts of her

890
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:19,463
He kept bad company
All these years

891
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:23,664
But now he has turned
in to a new leaf

892
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:28,005
There's no thrill
In taking calculated risks

893
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,772
You have to scale a mountain
if you want to touch the Peak

894
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:35,040
As long as you are brave,
nothing can go wrong

895
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:40,087
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

896
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:44,285
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

897
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:49,126
It's gonna be a Blast
His Charm is gonna blow you away

898
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,531
It's gonna be a Blast
The girl's gonna blow you away with her glance

899
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:58,471
Neduvaali, Hey Neduvaali

900
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,249
Kattupakkam Police Station

901
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,333
Hey!
What are you doing?

902
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:39,178
What is the need to steal
from your own house?

903
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,843
I see no other way out
to marry Nirmala

904
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,080
Don't utter a word

905
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,988
Don't think of this as a theft,
I'll give this money to Nirmala's father

906
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,923
He will give it back to dad as dowry

907
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,759
- The money will come back to us
- Take your hands off

908
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,962
Your brother has
trusted me all this money

909
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:02,532
- What will I say to him?
- This is no problem

910
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,707
Will steal it from Father and keep it back
as soon as the wedding is over

911
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:12,213
What a wonderful idea!

912
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,443
I am not smart enough
to think like this

913
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:22,790
You want to steal again
to coverthis theft?

914
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:26,894
Tell me!! Do you have
any other plans to steal?

915
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,454
Forgive me this time

916
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,258
I see no other way to marry her

917
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,136
Please let me take this money

918
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,601
Take it!!

919
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:54,255
But I will regret having
given birth to a Thief

920
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:59,590
This will haunt me till my last breath

921
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,320
I don't agree with this,
but I will for my daughter's sake

922
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:51,644
Her brightness will blind a Mirror
What a Terror she is...

923
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,082
May I sit?

924
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:00,553
I like the respect you show
Sit

925
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,419
This Cop has decided
to marry you

926
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,220
What do you say?

927
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,027
- I don't intend marrying anyone
- Why?

928
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,065
You look beautiful,
all ready for a Man to marry you

929
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,672
- Do you plan to stay single all your life?
- Yes

930
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:30,951
A young, dashing, handsome Man
wants to marry you...

931
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,045
Why don't you agree?

932
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:38,024
Hey Neduvaali,
where have you hidden the bottle?

933
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:42,124
My father only has me
Can't leave him behind

934
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:46,591
So, you wouldn't get married
until your father dies?

935
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:52,699
- No, I won't get married
until my father is alive - Well!!!

936
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,873
- Did you buy this at the Store?
- No... I made this

937
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,348
So you are the artist
behind this piece of art

938
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:08,084
- I am awed by your creativity
- Neduvaali... What are you doing?

939
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,221
But I hate this useless Man

940
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,624
Take care of your father,
try and change him

941
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:21,897
I'll wait till he dies
Just for you

942
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:37,145
Mother, you're getting
a superb daughter in law

943
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,823
You keep chiding me saying
I don't have any affection for Dad

944
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,853
But she's not like that
Her dad's a drunkard

945
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,793
But she still loves him a great deal

946
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,955
She's a lovely person,
just like you are

947
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,569
But you women are full of
emotions and sentiments

948
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,095
I am telling you so much about her

949
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,538
Don't you want to know who she is?

950
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,121
Any father would be a little more
worried about the weaker son

951
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,258
Shows a little more interest in him

952
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,691
Doesn't mean he has
no affection for you

953
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:58,532
He was born to me,
just like you are

954
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:02,695
- He is your brother nevertheless
- He is not my brother

955
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:03,634
He is this man's son

956
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:11,874
If you stay angry with them
I am afraid that grief will kill me

957
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:16,441
Do you want to see me dead?
Don't you have any affection for your mother?

958
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:17,450
I do Mother

959
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:20,780
Then, listen to what I am saying

960
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,550
Please understand your father

961
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,391
I want to speak to you...

962
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:39,232
Let's stop the tug of war between us
Let us stay together

963
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:44,068
What do you mean by "us"?
It's just you

964
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:51,912
The only bond between us is
now turning into ashes

965
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:57,952
Don't ever come into our lives

966
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,426
You and me are
no longer one family

967
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,929
Don't interrupt us...
You'll see my wrath if you dare to

968
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,939
- Come
- Don't push me into the ditch

969
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,647
Don't drink that rubbish

970
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:23,616
Don't you call it rubbish,
you'll upset people

971
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:26,782
- Come dad...
- Leave me

972
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:31,053
I can't walk...
Oh my God, a Train!!!

973
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,626
I am going to put my head under a Train

974
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,136
Father, don't trouble me

975
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:49,876
Neduvaali, if you don't give me money
I will protest here

976
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,346
Are you going to give me money?

977
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:58,886
I am tired of this drama
Get up before the Train comes

978
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,562
I am leaving to Chennai
to see the Minister

979
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,662
Let's have a chat till
we reach the station

980
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,102
Yes Daniel,
where are you?

981
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,703
I am going to the Railway station,
where are you?

982
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:24,006
I am at the Railway station,
your Enemy's Life is a trigger away

983
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,241
See his dead body on your way

984
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,178
Good to hearthat,
do it well

985
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,881
When are you ever going to change?

986
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:38,917
Hey Inspector!!!

987
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,023
- Am not worried now
Someone's shooting - Come dad

988
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,890
He's running to buy a drink

989
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:22,736
Hey buy me a snack as well

990
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,232
Think someone
shot me on my head

991
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:38,309
- Long live our Brother!!
- Greetings

992
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:47,513
The Minister is coming here for an
Election Rally next week

993
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,168
Sir... Look at how violent he is in Public

994
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,712
Don't Velu, what are you doing?
Stop it

995
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,777
Who's this?
What are you doing?

996
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,880
- Who is it?
- Don't

997
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,090
Velu, you aren't answering
my repeated questions

998
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,417
Don't

999
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:38,204
I am a Commissioner and you show
no respect for my words

1000
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:40,206
If I had listened to you...

1001
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:47,237
We might have had to bid adieu
to our Candidate 'Boxer Daniel'

1002
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,813
- What are you saying?
- His name is Vadakarayan

1003
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,976
Belongs to Palayankottai

1004
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,884
They have a 6 year long hostility between them
Everyone knows this

1005
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,451
Am I right Mr. Shankaralingam?

1006
01:19:57,259 --> 01:20:01,195
He has in all 18 cases of Murder,
Cheating, Attempting to Murder

1007
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,957
Out of which 2 were to try and kill Sir

1008
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,731
Am I right Mr. Shankaralingam?

1009
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,069
He knew Sir was coming
to the Railway Station

1010
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:13,072
And was hiding around to Kill him
I got ahead of him

1011
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:17,143
- Do tell me now, was I wrong?
- No Velu

1012
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:21,011
You've acted diligently and upheld
the Department's reputation

1013
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,242
One more thing

1014
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,249
No one knows who is
at war with whom

1015
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:29,149
And who is being used
as a bait to get the other

1016
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:34,524
Notjust him, his people
could be anywhere

1017
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,756
They could even be here,
in this group

1018
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:41,262
It's better to frisk
them thoroughly

1019
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,300
They might have a weapon

1020
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:48,274
- He's quite a handful
- Check all of them

1021
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,171
Help me God,
hope this doesn't blow up

1022
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:04,791
Poor you,
you hoped to see me dead

1023
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,193
You didn't want to raise a suspicion

1024
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,854
You made a friend out of yourfoe

1025
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,227
But I finished him

1026
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:16,202
I will have a reaction
to every action of yours

1027
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:20,133
I have told you this before
I am like a mirror

1028
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,672
If you hit me
I will hit you back

1029
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,540
If you kick me
I will kick you

1030
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,614
And if you even THINK
of killing me

1031
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,773
I will kill you before that

1032
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,748
I am no ordinary Velan

1033
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,648
I am Osthe Velan "The Best"

1034
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,687
If you utter a word beyond this
I will kill you

1035
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,858
I will shoot you down
before that

1036
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:05,580
- Shankaralingam, will your plan work out?
- Why doubt it?

1037
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,583
Osthe Velan killed
the guy we sent to kill him and...

1038
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,352
earned a good name with the Commissioner
by saving a Candidate's Life

1039
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,085
Let's use his story to our advantage

1040
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:19,530
Let's say there's no better person to
safe guard the Candidate's life but him

1041
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,932
Let's take "Osthe" Velan to RK Puram in
the name of election campaigns

1042
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,629
While we are distributing
money at Kattupakkam

1043
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,535
His attention will be on us

1044
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,268
- We can pay attention to giving away money
- What do you say?

1045
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,104
The "Violent" Man is here
Keep quiet

1046
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,477
Please come Sir,
we werejust talking about you

1047
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:42,420
We are here to request the Commissioner

1048
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:47,052
To make you Daniel Sir's personal security
in charge till the elections are over

1049
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:51,861
With some one like you around,
not even a mosquito will dare to bite him

1050
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:52,931
What do you say?

1051
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,099
There was a mosquito nearthe cheek

1052
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,935
Thought I'll get him in advance,
before he bites you

1053
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,271
My God!! This man is fast indeed!!

1054
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:05,744
There is a statistic that this area has

1055
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:15,722
1, 43, 33, 219 mosquitoes in all
I have saved you from just 1 of them

1056
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,984
Don't you worry

1057
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:22,289
I will swat each and every one of them

1058
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:27,300
Whetherthey are on your Leader's cheek
or anywhere else

1059
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:31,304
I will squash them... Will squash the mosquito
Not your Leader

1060
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,636
Hurry up and get the order
from the Commissioner

1061
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:39,308
I am all set to be your Hit Man
What do you say?

1062
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,971
I have nothing to say

1063
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,515
- Greetings Sir!
- What's this on your Cheek?

1064
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:48,748
Is that a mosquito?

1065
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,485
No, it's not It's a mole
I'll take it out myself

1066
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:55,495
That's better! I'll get wild if I even
hear the buzz of a mosquito

1067
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,588
What do you say Shankaralingam?
Do we go ahead with the permission?

1068
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,500
No way! My ears are still ringing
with that slap of his...

1069
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,603
We'll have to think of some other idea

1070
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:12,239
Hurry up, don't walk in like a shy bride
Get going

1071
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:14,642
Have the tube, but don't have the Holder

1072
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,513
Move the Bulb, it looks like
it is fixed to the Holder

1073
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:21,144
Have you guys brought everything
I wanted from home?

1074
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:24,748
Have got everything you wanted,
but there's no money there

1075
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:25,950
Did you search for it?

1076
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,224
We searched the way an eagle
would search for it's prey

1077
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,228
There's not a single paisa there

1078
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,799
Unbelievable!! Did you guys help
yourself with the money?

1079
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,462
You're very generous with us,
we would never dream of it

1080
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:40,530
Don't make us laugh with emotional dialogues
Go and clear up the dishes

1081
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:41,705
Hey Mother

1082
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:47,445
Where did you hide such a big amount
from that father and son?

1083
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:55,149
- This chariot costs Rs 10,000
- How much is this?

1084
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,587
This costs Rs 15,000

1085
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,952
15,000 is quite a lot
Give me a better rate

1086
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,153
It's a fixed rate, Rs 15,000

1087
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,730
Greetings Sir!!

1088
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,335
- What are you doing here?
- I am getting married

1089
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,994
Did the horse agree to marry you?

1090
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,235
Nirmala and I are getting married

1091
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,533
It seems to be a grand wedding, with
chariots and all of that

1092
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:17,576
How come?

1093
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:21,004
Mother wanted it that way...

1094
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,744
Did Mother want it that way... or?

1095
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,945
- I want it too
- Will I get an Invite?

1096
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,089
I'm not sure you will come

1097
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:33,752
Why not? Will surely come,
with my wife!

1098
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,423
Are you married...

1099
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:39,757
When a useless man like you
can find a girl to marry...

1100
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,860
Won't an eligible man
like me find a girl?

1101
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,696
Hey Horse!! Am I right?

1102
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,071
I'll come... with your
sister in law

1103
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:53,375
Cause Mother wanted the older one to get
married before the younger one does

1104
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,081
This Chariot looks good

1105
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:59,244
- This costs more
- That's fine give him that

1106
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,787
I'll bare the cost of the chariot

1107
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,953
It's a wedding in our family after all!

1108
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:08,227
What are you doing?
Why are you drinking away irresponsibly?

1109
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,889
You have a young daughter at home
Poor girl

1110
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:14,626
She has to fetch you from the Liquor Store
or from the Streets each day

1111
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:22,636
I can't beat around the bush
I intend to marry your daughter

1112
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,974
Why are you looking like that?
What more can you want?

1113
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:30,750
I am able bodied, I have a government job,
I earn a handful and more

1114
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,084
Why are you laughing?

1115
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:37,318
My daughter is an obstinate girl
Neduvaali! How will she agree?

1116
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:42,658
She won't marry as long as I am around
She must have told you

1117
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,358
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

1118
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:46,092
Are you even talking like
the Father of a young girl?

1119
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:51,833
Most fathers are willing to beg or borrow
to get their daughters married

1120
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,567
And you are saying this!!

1121
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,975
Go and try and change your daughter's mind
She couldn't change yours

1122
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,341
You change her...

1123
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:02,515
You can't claim to be a father
if you can't do even this

1124
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,123
- Will you take good care of her?
- No! I will beat her every day!!!

1125
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,955
I will send herto your house and force
herto bring back things for me

1126
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,325
I am asking out of so much
of love for her!!!

1127
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,160
Fine then!! Make arrangements
for the wedding

1128
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:21,201
My daughter will agree,
I will get her to agree

1129
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:26,635
We'll have respectable people at the
wedding, don't be drunk there

1130
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:30,074
Will lose face
Give up your drink at least for that day

1131
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:30,872
Do you understand?

1132
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:34,039
Go ahead! I'll give up drinking
from this very minute...

1133
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,208
For my daughter

1134
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:19,756
Father!!!!

1135
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,855
You're very different Man
Cannot understand you

1136
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:51,686
You said you would give up drinking...
But you gave up your Life

1137
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:05,464
Get going all of you
None of you bothered when he was alive

1138
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:08,235
Now you come in large numbers and
mourn for him!!

1139
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,812
Get going once you've offered your
condolences

1140
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,843
Don't over do it
Get going now

1141
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,132
This Cop has taken a decision

1142
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:42,334
Elders say we should have something
joyous in a house that's in mourning

1143
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,343
Let's get married right away

1144
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:48,509
I might have left something behind
Go, Get everything you need

1145
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,747
Thank you Father in Law!!!

1146
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:58,752
I told you all to leave, Get going

1147
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,956
Have you got everything,
do you need anything else?

1148
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,831
We can start the rituals
if the flowers arrive

1149
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,769
Welcome! Hope you are doing good?

1150
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,869
Why are you playing with a child,
it's getting late, come on

1151
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,747
Hey, get that necklace
Wear these bangles

1152
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:23,714
Hey Nirmala, look at that saree

1153
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:27,879
That necklace looks good too

1154
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:43,067
Sad, he makes me wear a
Uniform even to a wedding

1155
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,072
Would you gift the couple
Rs 10,000 if you wore a Suit?

1156
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,742
Eat a free meal as usual and get going

1157
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:55,414
Please come I am really happy
that all of you have come

1158
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:59,243
- The arrangements are very grand
- Thanks to you!

1159
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:02,811
- But you've committed a sin
- What have I done?

1160
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,222
Would you get the younger
son married before the older one?

1161
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,419
Would you eat the desert
before the Main Course?

1162
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:11,323
Not enough if you are old,
Need to uphold some traditions

1163
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,297
Give me the orders Inspector,
I'll shoot them

1164
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:16,370
You heard that, didn't you?
I am the older one

1165
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,972
Let me get married first,
then my brother can

1166
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:45,398
Why are you trembling?
Chant them well

1167
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,524
Who asked for Police
to guard the place?

1168
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:49,125
- Why are you asking us? Look there
- What's happening here?

1169
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,205
Why is the place so quiet?

1170
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,639
Ask the Band to play, only then will
it feel like a wedding

1171
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,409
That's right Is this a Marriage Hall or an
Examination Hall?

1172
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,144
Why do they look like they've
been struck by a Ghost?

1173
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,652
That reminds me, what is your
Mother In law up to?

1174
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:08,388
Is that even important?

1175
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:12,984
Who is this? He looks like
Actor Premji in the movie "Goa"

1176
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,594
Who is this creature?

1177
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,494
The Inspector is in a bad mood,
play some music, quick!

1178
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:19,827
You paid me to play at 1 wedding

1179
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,834
Now you want me to play for 2
How is that possible?

1180
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,995
Play music, we'll take care
of the payment later

1181
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:27,268
Can't do that
My payment comes first

1182
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,468
AR Rahman belts out different tunes
all the time

1183
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:31,568
And even he takes his payment
only after composing

1184
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,672
You play the same tunes at all weddings,
You want your payment in advance?

1185
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:37,512
Let's not get in to that debate
Cannot play music

1186
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:39,477
You don't know about him

1187
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,078
Like you have "Sivaji the Boss",
he's "Osthe The Mass"

1188
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,384
- What does "Mass" mean?
- Master of "Jacking"

1189
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,289
- What does SS Mean then?
- Super Subbarayan

1190
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:51,923
If you don't start now
We'll take you to the Station

1191
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:56,970
And show you how we play music...
You'll never be able to play again

1192
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,632
We haven't settled this yet,
why did you start?

1193
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,642
I am not playing the music,
it's playing on its own

1194
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:06,406
Sir, it's only been a month
since I got married

1195
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,843
Then, why don't you play on

1196
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,043
Do you want me to give you the rhythm?

1197
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,246
Play on

1198
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:20,089
Why are you repeating the same Chants?

1199
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:21,991
Give me the Sacred Thread,
let me tie it

1200
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:30,663
Play the Music

1201
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,649
- Can I go around now?
- Go ahead!!

1202
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:00,734
Parents of the couple, come forward
Let them take your blessings!

1203
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:04,333
Hey priest!!

1204
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,532
There are no elders in herfamily...
and neither do...

1205
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,312
Am sure there are elders in yourfamily...

1206
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,879
I am the elder one at home

1207
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,475
I'll bless myself

1208
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,593
I am seething when I see you

1209
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:34,831
You have insulted me
in front of everyone

1210
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:38,697
If your mother were here
She would have spit on yourface

1211
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:40,330
She would have spit only on your face

1212
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:43,342
Fortrying to get him
married before me

1213
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,239
This marriage was performed
to fulfill Mother's wish

1214
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:52,081
You attempted to quell her wish...
It's me who fulfilled it

1215
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:54,750
Get out of here

1216
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:57,252
Who are you to ask me to leave?

1217
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,791
I didn't come here because
you asked me to

1218
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:02,759
I came on my own
I know how to go out

1219
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:10,034
It's over
It's all over

1220
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:16,636
I am humiliated
This wedding won't happen now

1221
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,047
Father...

1222
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,054
Get on

1223
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,730
Start the Chariot

1224
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,078
The girl I've selected is the Best

1225
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,654
Was it right that you behaved
that way at the Wedding Hall?

1226
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:02,916
What's wrong with that?

1227
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:07,923
- I did it to fulfill my Mother's wish
- But your dad was upset...

1228
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:11,093
Let him be
It's nothing new

1229
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:15,936
It's been a 20 year long tug of
war between him and me

1230
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:20,639
Neither of us know when this will end...

1231
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:21,605
I don't understand

1232
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:24,276
Live with me
And you'll understand

1233
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,674
You'll know why "Osthe"
Velan does all of this...

1234
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:30,114
- Who's "Osthe" Velan?
- Hey! That's me

1235
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,583
- Isn't "Cop" your name?
- Who evertold you that?

1236
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:34,051
You were the one who keeps
saying things like

1237
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:38,785
The Cop's getting angry
The Cop's gonna safeguard you...

1238
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:43,793
I thought your name was "Cop"

1239
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:47,458
Phew!! What a Life!!
That is not what "Cop" means...

1240
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:55,805
A Cop is a Policeman...
I am in awe of your sharp brain!

1241
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:56,808
Don't pull my leg

1242
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,277
What else to do?
You don't even understand this...

1243
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:02,372
- You didn't explain it to me
- I'll explain everything...

1244
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:07,551
I'll get you to understand
every inch of it

1245
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,582
Come hear, my dear wife

1246
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:32,104
Hey, come here my dear
'Cute' Wife

1247
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:35,908
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1248
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:39,850
Hey, come here my dear 'Hot' Wife

1249
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:43,720
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1250
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:53,462
My Wife, that's You

1251
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:55,364
My Sweets, I love You forever

1252
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:59,371
I'll never seek a Mistress

1253
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:10,713
My Wife, that's You
My Sweets, I love You forever

1254
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:14,515
I'll never seek a Mistress

1255
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:18,319
I'll be a good husband
I'll be a man of character

1256
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:22,156
I'll handle all your tantrums
I'll take away your problems

1257
01:38:22,263 --> 01:38:24,094
I won't let you shed any tears

1258
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:27,895
Hey, come here my dear 'Cute' Wife

1259
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:31,699
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1260
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:35,605
Hey, come here my dear 'Hot' Wife

1261
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:39,736
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1262
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:51,087
My Wife...

1263
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:20,448
I'll wake you up
With Coffee in the morning

1264
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:25,925
And if you don't know how to cook
I'll cook for you and feed you too

1265
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:30,024
I'll never ever doubt you

1266
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:33,293
Norwill I ever
give you reason to doubt me

1267
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:37,063
I'll be your Life and Soul
You're more precious than my Life

1268
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,967
I'll hold you very dear in my Heart

1269
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:40,904
I'll admire you each and every day

1270
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:43,033
I'll be your Shadow

1271
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:46,510
Hey, come here my dear 'Cute' Wife

1272
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:50,481
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1273
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:54,418
Hey, come here my dear 'Hot' Wife

1274
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:58,582
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1275
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,751
Hey... Wife...

1276
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:06,658
I need no Mistress...

1277
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:10,494
Wife...

1278
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:31,488
Hey, I promise, my Life isn't going
away before yours

1279
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:36,962
Cause I'd never want anyone to
see you sad without me

1280
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:40,693
No Man's going to take care
of you the way I do

1281
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:46,171
He can only falsely claim to
I'll be a Father to you

1282
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:50,073
I'll be a Mother too
I'll be a Friend to you

1283
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:52,077
I'll protect you the way God would

1284
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:54,545
I'll be born as your sweet Child

1285
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:59,715
Hey, come here my dear 'Cute' Wife

1286
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:03,517
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1287
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:07,424
Hey, come here my dear 'Hot' Wife

1288
01:41:07,528 --> 01:41:11,794
I am sleepless and restless without
You near me

1289
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:19,665
My Wife...
I'll love you till you are a Granny

1290
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:28,070
Hey... Wife...
I need no Mistress...

1291
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,283
I love you my Wife

1292
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:43,084
- Sir, Daniel has come to see you
- Come!

1293
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:45,955
- Greetings Sir!
- You stay here

1294
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,101
Why don't you get going?

1295
01:41:56,043 --> 01:41:58,773
We have 148 villages in all
in our constituency

1296
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,642
Money hasn't reached
14 of these villages

1297
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:04,449
The votes we get there are
important for us to win

1298
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:07,714
The Inspector grabs the money
wherever we take it

1299
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:10,381
I can't give these
excuses to Higher ups

1300
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:16,627
I am not merely a Minister
I am the District Head of the Party

1301
01:42:16,763 --> 01:42:19,459
That's why I am fondly
called "Nellaiyar"

1302
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:21,796
Why don't you finish the Inspector?

1303
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:23,460
That got messed up last week

1304
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:28,003
Why don't you keep him next to you,
as your Security?

1305
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:29,632
That got messed up too

1306
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:31,734
What do you want to do with him?

1307
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,504
Would be great if you
can suspend him

1308
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:35,673
How is that possible?

1309
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:40,147
That would be easy on a normal day
But it's election time

1310
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:43,087
Everything is under the control
of the Election Commission

1311
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:47,820
Get me one good reason to and then see
How I deal with him

1312
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,707
- What is it Dad?
- Are you still thinking about that girl?

1313
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:02,865
Forget about everything and
get going with work

1314
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:04,944
Else we'll be on the streets, begging

1315
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:07,213
I am heading to the Bank,
take care of things

1316
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:27,725
Who's wealth are you wasting away?
What are you thinking?

1317
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:29,425
Do you think this is some game?

1318
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:42,080
Look at how he has beaten up my son!!!

1319
01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:46,310
He has slogged for them for 10 years

1320
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,754
Look at the reward he has got for it!!

1321
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:52,853
Your brother has beaten him up

1322
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:02,662
He maybe a Policeman's brother,
but he can't do this!!

1323
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:06,937
- We need to get justice
- Stop it

1324
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:09,938
He'll get beaten till,
you ask for it to stop

1325
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:20,906
- Autocracy of the Police
- Down!! Down!!

1326
01:46:21,007 --> 01:46:22,907
Arrest Autocrat "Osthe" Velan!!

1327
01:46:29,282 --> 01:46:32,479
We need justice!!
Autocracy of the Police - Down!! Down!!

1328
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:37,285
Arrest Autocrat "Osthe" Velan!!

1329
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,755
Hey "Osthe", yourjeep is going
to be in a bonfire!!

1330
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:03,476
Poor guy, he's coming in an Auto
His Jeep has been burnt

1331
01:47:11,892 --> 01:47:14,452
I am the Victorious Candidate
of this place

1332
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:18,497
He has beaten up an Innocent Man
right in front of my eyes

1333
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:25,231
Should you beat someone up
if they lodge a complaint?

1334
01:47:25,338 --> 01:47:27,067
Need justice

1335
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:31,840
- Is this the way to use his authority?
- If we were to use authority the right way,

1336
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,207
You won't be spared

1337
01:47:33,346 --> 01:47:37,646
Haven't you read News articles
on Rowdies killed in Encounters?

1338
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:43,986
Haven't you read about
Policemen being attacked?

1339
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:46,558
Why talk about needless things,
please wait

1340
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,422
He will beat up someone each day

1341
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:53,727
I am no lay person to
put up with all of this

1342
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:56,894
I am the Election Candidate of this area
Suspend him

1343
01:47:57,337 --> 01:48:00,397
If you don't, there will be an
Outrage among the Public

1344
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:03,905
They'll burn buses, Kill Policemen

1345
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:06,771
Don't get emotional
Why are you making a big deal of this?

1346
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,444
This is theirfamily problem
Don't make Politics out of this

1347
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:11,645
What do we do Sir? You tell us

1348
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:16,882
Sir, a Policeman has hit my son
We've been deeply affected and hurt

1349
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:19,117
Daniel is here, you are here

1350
01:48:19,226 --> 01:48:22,923
Ask that Policeman to apologize to my son,
in front of all of you

1351
01:48:23,029 --> 01:48:24,189
Let's end the matter with this

1352
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:29,530
- Is this what we came for?
What are you saying? - Stay calm...

1353
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:34,430
What are you saying Sir...
He has saved your life

1354
01:48:34,808 --> 01:48:37,038
Velu, seek an apology

1355
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:46,748
Mr. Balan, It was wrong of me to
beat you up, forgive me

1356
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:49,547
He has sought an apology
The problem is over now

1357
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:05,830
We're staying away from each other
cause we can't get along

1358
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:09,067
Why don't you let us live in peace?
Why do you make things worse?

1359
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:14,076
I pray that this be
the last time I see you

1360
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:23,456
Too much of this mosquito menace

1361
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:27,988
- Why are you starting this again?
- This is our family problem

1362
01:49:28,328 --> 01:49:31,422
- I'll seek an apology again
- Forgive me Balan

1363
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:33,093
Go!

1364
01:49:39,472 --> 01:49:41,565
Hey!! Victorious Candidate

1365
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,940
- Rs 100 for you
- Why?

1366
01:49:45,045 --> 01:49:47,605
- For you to go in an Auto
- Why should I go in an Auto?

1367
01:49:47,714 --> 01:49:49,773
Daniel, both Vehicles are on Fire,
hurry up!!

1368
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,545
Put it out!!

1369
01:49:57,857 --> 01:50:00,087
The riot fires won't know
the difference between

1370
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:04,186
the Policeman's Vehicle
and the Politician's

1371
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:08,631
You're at the Commissioner's Office
Why don't you write out a complaint?

1372
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:12,769
Whoever it is, I'll produce them
in front of you

1373
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:16,899
I've told you before...
I am like a Mirror

1374
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,335
I'll snarl if you snarl

1375
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:22,142
If you start a fire,
I'll burn you down!!

1376
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,193
Hey Lucky!!

1377
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:41,166
Come

1378
01:50:43,403 --> 01:50:47,134
- Welcome, Mr. Sincere Policeman!!
- Greetings Sir

1379
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:50,767
I believe you cite a lot of rules
What are you thinking?

1380
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:53,175
Do you even know what
the Government can do to you?

1381
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:56,214
It's your Government that has
asked to follow rules

1382
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:58,247
Are you talking back to me?

1383
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:01,115
Is it talking back if I give you
an appropriate answer?

1384
01:51:03,289 --> 01:51:08,090
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, an Orderto suspend me for 3 months

1385
01:51:08,194 --> 01:51:11,891
- Do you know why I have got you here?
- I do Sir

1386
01:51:12,032 --> 01:51:14,899
While I am here getting this order,

1387
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:19,200
The money is going to go past my area
and get distributed to people

1388
01:51:19,939 --> 01:51:24,376
Don't make a noise,
start the vehicle

1389
01:51:24,944 --> 01:51:29,381
You've lost,
You've lost to a Politician!

1390
01:51:29,482 --> 01:51:32,474
Go! You're suspended for 3 months

1391
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:35,554
By then the Elections will be over
and the results declared

1392
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:40,551
You can then come pay your
respects to this Minister

1393
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,390
- And get back on Duty
- That won't happen

1394
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:46,423
- Why?
- You will by then be an "Ex" Minister

1395
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:47,557
What are you saying?

1396
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:50,601
You're going to have money distributed
in the area under my control

1397
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:52,838
Elections are scheduled on the 18th

1398
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:59,011
Your protege Daniel is going
to win by 25,000 votes

1399
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:00,238
And then,

1400
01:52:00,447 --> 01:52:03,280
Having won with the maximum
number of Votes...

1401
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:07,319
He will gain your Ministry
as well as your title

1402
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:10,082
And you, having won with just 512 votes

1403
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:13,091
Will walk along side him as a mere MLA

1404
01:52:13,593 --> 01:52:18,360
Mull over it... My Math will be right
Will be back in 3 months

1405
01:52:19,332 --> 01:52:20,856
Hey! Stop!

1406
01:52:21,434 --> 01:52:22,594
Give me that Order

1407
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:26,930
You gave me a valid point
What should I do now?

1408
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:31,168
Throw that away

1409
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:36,006
I'll take care of Boxer Daniel
Let this be between us

1410
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:37,174
Sit down Sir

1411
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:43,547
The Elections must happen
But he shouldn't win

1412
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:45,924
That will happen

1413
01:52:46,025 --> 01:52:48,892
What is this? Why have you worn
your glasses at the back?

1414
01:52:48,995 --> 01:52:53,329
There are many people who
backstab you...

1415
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,993
This is my 3rd eye to have
a watch over those guys

1416
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,905
Look at that!

1417
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,883
- The Inspector has asked us to mix this
in everything - What's this?

1418
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:16,581
This must be some soft drink
Mix it! Hurry up

1419
01:53:16,756 --> 01:53:19,350
- That's enough
- Have you poured it in all the Bottles?

1420
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:25,932
People vanish like Gods
if you ask them to buy you a drink

1421
01:53:26,065 --> 01:53:29,831
But you've bought us so many drinks
even without us asking for it

1422
01:53:29,936 --> 01:53:33,201
Have mixed the soft drinks as well
Would you like a peg or more?

1423
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:37,335
- This is not for us
- So near, yet unreachable

1424
01:53:37,443 --> 01:53:39,377
Can you tell me what the idea is?

1425
01:53:40,713 --> 01:53:43,273
Just do what I ask you to
You'll see why soon

1426
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,281
Did I wait so farfor this one ground nut?

1427
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:47,319
Hey folks, come in with the drinks

1428
01:53:49,722 --> 01:53:55,592
My dear brothers, my fellow citizens
who come together for a drink,

1429
01:53:55,695 --> 01:54:00,632
Be it Rain or Shine, my dear friends who
always find a reason to down a drink

1430
01:54:00,767 --> 01:54:06,103
Responsible citizens, who don't waste
too much water in a drink...

1431
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:09,872
There's good news for you

1432
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:15,312
Today being Masanamurthy 's birthday,
the drinks are on the House

1433
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:18,875
Selvam, It's not my Birthday!!

1434
01:54:18,985 --> 01:54:23,445
This is the Inspector's order
If you disobey, you'll be shot at

1435
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,781
Yes, It's my Birthday!!
Have a drink everyone!!

1436
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:42,335
- Oh my God!!
- My stomach's hurting!

1437
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:46,005
What happened?

1438
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,510
What did you ask me to mix in it?
A man's fallen unconscious

1439
01:54:49,616 --> 01:54:50,446
Let him fall

1440
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:53,041
- People are throwing up there Sir...
- Let them

1441
01:54:53,753 --> 01:54:55,618
They are suffering from a stomach ache

1442
01:54:56,322 --> 01:55:00,281
Hey! Just because you didn't get a drink,
how happy you are at someone else's suffering

1443
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:03,692
- Inspector, these guys are in pain
- Call the Ambulance

1444
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:07,830
- Put them in once it comes
- What did you ask to be mixed?

1445
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:10,428
- Poison
- Oh my God, Poison!!!

1446
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:15,632
- Why this Acid Test?
- For us to pass it...

1447
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:21,076
12 people who had liquor at
a particular liquor store...

1448
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:24,809
...have been admitted to a hospital on
complaints of severe stomach ache

1449
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:28,479
The Doctor, treating these patients,
says there is no danger to their lives

1450
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:31,056
The Police have taken possession of
the bottles they were drinking from

1451
01:55:31,157 --> 01:55:36,754
And are investigating the causes
We believe the guilty will be punished

1452
01:55:36,863 --> 01:55:38,262
Sudha reporting for Sigaram TV

1453
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:42,158
Because we might get caught
distributing money

1454
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:45,499
Our Leader is giving it away as cash
gifts for a Family function

1455
01:55:46,005 --> 01:55:49,668
Boxer Daniel has arranged
for a bomb shell of a girl!

1456
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:56,072
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala...

1457
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:02,085
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala

Ask the "Northies" about me
They'll tell you who I am

1462
01:56:14,901 --> 01:56:17,734
Chanting my name
is as sweet as Halwa

1463
01:56:17,837 --> 01:56:20,670
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala

01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:30,306
Chanting my name
is as sweet as Halwa

1467
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:33,385
Don't your dare think
Anyone can take her for a Ride

1468
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,455
She's the Cobra Queen
She'll strike you down with her "hiss"

1469
01:56:36,556 --> 01:56:39,616
A bite of Mallika
Is as hot as Paprika

1470
01:56:39,726 --> 01:56:42,718
If you lay out a soft bed for her
She'll break in to a Song

1471
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:45,855
The more you Cajole her
The more she'll ooze Honey

1472
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:48,900
Take her if you like Her
Seal her to your Heart

1473
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:52,028
She is as cool as a Cucumber
Is there anyone who wouldn't want her?

1474
01:56:52,138 --> 01:56:54,971
My Dear Darling,
Mallika's calling out to You

1475
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:57,907
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala

01:57:26,005 --> 01:57:28,166

Let Two become One

1482

The Mood is soaring
The Temperature's blazing

01:57:40,953 --> 01:57:44,320
Let's play naughty on purpose

01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:12,808
The Best Buddy

1491
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:24,286
Hey, Come Closer

Hey sing, Darling

1494
01:58:43,182 --> 01:58:49,143
This is a jolly Party
Mallika's a Beauty

1495
01:58:49,255 --> 01:58:52,247
She sets the floor on fire
with her stride

1496
01:58:52,358 --> 01:58:55,225
You're killing me softly each day

1497
01:58:55,328 --> 01:58:58,320
There's a right Match for you
A Budding Youthful Man's here

1498
01:58:58,431 --> 01:59:01,923
Hold him tight
Stick by Him

Pure Unadulterated Gold
Who can everwin a fight with you

1501
01:59:08,241 --> 01:59:11,472
Let's cool it off at Courtrallam
Let's set the drums on a roll

1502
01:59:11,577 --> 01:59:14,671
We're going to paint
the town red every night

1503
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:17,544
My Dear Darling,
Mallika's calling out to You

1504
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:20,551
Hey, Come here

1505
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,816
Mallika my Darling,
Come let's play the fool

1506
01:59:23,923 --> 01:59:26,949
Let's have fun with tricks in Bed

1507
01:59:27,059 --> 01:59:30,119
My mind has changed,
Turned pure as white

1508
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:33,357
It's getting Hotter
when I set my eyes on you

1509
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:36,299
You're a beautiful String of Flowers
Can't get to the wrong hands

1510
01:59:36,402 --> 01:59:39,166
Let me Adorn you
My dear Silver Moon

1511
01:59:39,272 --> 01:59:43,766
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala

1512
01:59:43,876 --> 01:59:58,086
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala
Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala Kalasala

1513
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:00,856
You've taken your money

1514
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:04,487
You'd better leave
Else you will be caught in the Raid

1515
02:00:06,465 --> 02:00:08,160
A Raid! What are you talking about?

1516
02:00:09,101 --> 02:00:10,898
The Doctor's report says
that 20 people's lives are in danger

1517
02:00:11,003 --> 02:00:14,769
After having liquor made by your Company

1518
02:00:15,374 --> 02:00:16,705
You are playing a game

1519
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:19,869
That's right We're playing
a Game, "Mankatha"

1520
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:23,774
I was the one who mixed poison
in the Liquor from your Company

1521
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:31,220
You don't have proof for that
But I have proof that your liquor was poisoned

1522
02:00:31,324 --> 02:00:32,882
This is "Mankatha"

1523
02:00:32,992 --> 02:00:37,156
- If this information reaches the Press...
- Are you threatening me?

1524
02:00:37,263 --> 02:00:39,731
That reminds me...

1525
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:43,461
There's this Deity called "Ayyanar"
at the Village Border...

1526
02:00:43,703 --> 02:00:47,469
with a menacing, threatening Moustache...

1527
02:00:47,573 --> 02:00:55,070
And in his hands there's this huge...

1528
02:00:56,048 --> 02:00:57,413
- What's that called?
- A Sickle

1529
02:00:57,683 --> 02:01:02,814
Yes... S I C K L E...!!! That's me!

1530
02:01:02,955 --> 02:01:05,446
And at the time of the Village Festival...

1531
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:09,187
They have this little thing,
they drag across the place,

1532
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:13,664
The one that wags its tail faintly...

1533
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:18,159
The one that bleats...

1534
02:01:18,337 --> 02:01:20,100
- What's it called?
- A Goat

1535
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:25,166
No... The Sacrificial Goat!!!
That's You!!

1536
02:01:25,778 --> 02:01:31,045
And when the Sickle moves up,
to fall on the Goat's neck...

1537
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:35,678
The Goat would be happy thinking
the Sickle is moving away from his neck

1538
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:40,816
But further it moves,
more the force!!

1539
02:01:40,926 --> 02:01:43,827
Now, if the Goat has to escape,
what should it do?

1540
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:47,763
- If it's a clever Goat, it will step aside
- Hey! What do you want?

1541
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:51,464
I don't want Anaconda Eggs,
I want Money of course!!

1542
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:51,968
Which money?

1543
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:53,504
The one that you dodged us
for at the Check post,

1544
02:01:53,606 --> 02:01:57,838
And are distributing in the name of
cash gifts for a family function

1545
02:02:05,685 --> 02:02:07,778
How much we have to toil to earn money!

1546
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:16,325
Aren't the pictures you see in this Mirror
a sight to Behold? It will be!

1547
02:02:17,697 --> 02:02:23,260
Hey!! Are you trying to stop me from winning
And earn a good name amongst people?

1548
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:27,735
How much longer can
I put on the Bad Man's Act? Let's go

1549
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:33,569
The Minister who promised to
control him, has given up

1550
02:02:35,047 --> 02:02:36,810
He has also taken away
the money we had in hand

1551
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:44,252
What do we say to those who're
waiting to for Election expenses?

1552
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:47,250
I've lost hopes of winning

1553
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,854
I have Hope... Hopes of Winning

1554
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:53,761
He turned the Minister on our side
to a Traitor

1555
02:02:53,866 --> 02:02:58,860
- I will turn one of his men in to a Traitor!
- I don't understand...

1556
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:01,098
There's two kinds of attacks in Boxing

1557
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:03,437
One -A direct attack

1558
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:05,806
The other, a Hidden one

1559
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:11,246
We took the legal way first,
then the Illegal one

1560
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:15,016
But we are taking a new way now

1561
02:03:17,123 --> 02:03:19,182
Have you shut the doors?

1562
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:21,521
- Yes I have!!
- Why are you sulking?

1563
02:03:21,627 --> 02:03:24,619
Nirmala's father gave the money
only for his daughter's Wedding

1564
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:27,889
The Wedding didn't happen...
Why don't we return...

1565
02:03:28,134 --> 02:03:32,764
I never stopped the wedding... He did

1566
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,540
Let him ask for it... We'll see

1567
02:04:04,003 --> 02:04:05,197
Come!!!

1568
02:04:10,476 --> 02:04:11,534
Pour it!!

1569
02:04:26,392 --> 02:04:28,292
Go on, quick!!

1570
02:05:15,975 --> 02:05:19,274
Hey! Why are you loitering around
like an orphaned child?

1571
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:22,939
Father's not well
Have admitted him in the Hospital

1572
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:24,538
The Mill has burnt down

1573
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:27,346
Am on the roads,
don't know what to do for money

1574
02:05:27,453 --> 02:05:28,545
Please help me

1575
02:05:28,654 --> 02:05:34,820
No way, I was humiliated at
the Commissioner's office the last time

1576
02:05:34,927 --> 02:05:38,954
- Start the Vehicle
- Sir, please trust me this time, help me

1577
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:41,624
Have to save my father somehow

1578
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:46,438
Get in

1579
02:05:48,073 --> 02:05:49,768
Hurry up, Come

1580
02:05:50,142 --> 02:05:56,103
The Man who is batting
is the Minister's Man

1581
02:05:57,483 --> 02:05:58,575
This is my Man

1582
02:05:58,684 --> 02:06:06,056
If I tell him to hit that guy,
He will finish him off with

1583
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:09,127
no further questions

1584
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:11,921
Now, you've asked me for a job

1585
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:15,933
If I tell you the same thing,
what will you do?

1586
02:06:22,908 --> 02:06:24,603
Throw the Ball

1587
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:56,370
- Daniel's vehicle is coming
- Stop!!

1588
02:07:00,346 --> 02:07:02,974
Looks like you have
joined Politics as well

1589
02:07:03,082 --> 02:07:04,515
Why? Shouldn't I?

1590
02:07:04,617 --> 02:07:07,177
Does your brother know
you've joined this Party?

1591
02:07:07,353 --> 02:07:11,847
Why should he know?
Was he there at my side always?

1592
02:07:11,957 --> 02:07:14,585
You were around when
he stopped my wedding

1593
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:19,390
- Why are you getting angry for this?
- I will get angry

1594
02:07:19,498 --> 02:07:22,126
Does he have to feel happy
seeing me struggle as a Driver?

1595
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:26,261
- Ask him to come
- Don't speak this way

1596
02:07:26,372 --> 02:07:28,067
Hey, Open the Gate

1597
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:30,535
Please go

1598
02:07:45,457 --> 02:07:51,225
- Why is he going with Daniel?
- He has joined him as a Driver

1599
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:55,429
Why with him?
Didn't he find anyone else to work for?

1600
02:08:02,074 --> 02:08:04,838
- What happened?
- He's cutting my call

1601
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:06,171
My brother has no brain

1602
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:08,974
He will never think about
what he is asked to do

1603
02:08:09,081 --> 02:08:10,571
lmpressionable guy

1604
02:08:10,883 --> 02:08:12,714
Am ashamed to call him my Brother

1605
02:08:12,818 --> 02:08:17,187
This is the first time I am hearing
you call him your Brother

1606
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:19,917
He would be really happy
to hear you say this

1607
02:08:20,025 --> 02:08:21,583
He should answerthe phone
to hearthis

1608
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,992
I am leaving for my Duty at
the Minister's Guest House

1609
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:25,393
Get going

1610
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:26,855
Hey Stop!
Show me your ID

1611
02:08:26,965 --> 02:08:30,594
- Greetings Sir
- Who are you? Your ID please

1612
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:44,214
This has Mangoes, the Minister's favorite...
Go and give it to him

1613
02:08:44,316 --> 02:08:46,409
Why should I go when
all of you are there?

1614
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:49,544
You are asking questions?

1615
02:08:49,655 --> 02:08:50,952
What did you say
when you asked for a job?

1616
02:08:51,056 --> 02:08:54,287
You go and give it
You can leave

1617
02:08:54,393 --> 02:08:55,360
Don't stay in front of me

1618
02:08:55,461 --> 02:08:58,430
I took pity on you because
your father was in the Hospital

1619
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:00,896
Let him die, what do I care
You take it

1620
02:09:00,999 --> 02:09:06,369
I questioned you by mistake
I'll deliver it myself

1621
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:10,106
Hey! Stop

1622
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:15,311
If anyone asks you about who this...
say it's from your brother "Osthe" Velan...

1623
02:09:16,281 --> 02:09:17,976
Start the Vehicle

1624
02:09:19,885 --> 02:09:23,981
Hey! Show me your ID
Fine! Go

1625
02:09:24,356 --> 02:09:27,382
- Who are you?
- I am "Osthe" Velan's brother...

1626
02:09:27,493 --> 02:09:30,792
No one can go inside

1627
02:09:30,896 --> 02:09:34,059
- One second, Who are you?
- I am "Osthe" Velan's brother

1628
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:37,067
- Are you doing good?
- Yes, thanks to you

1629
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:41,937
Inspector "Osthe" Velan
has sent fruits for you

1630
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,201
- This is his brother
- Hasn't your brother come?

1631
02:09:44,309 --> 02:09:46,743
- He has gone on duty
- Fine then!

1632
02:09:46,845 --> 02:09:47,869
Take it

1633
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:53,480
Why didn't you answer
your brother's call?

1634
02:09:53,585 --> 02:09:55,746
He takes your name
dime a dozen times

1635
02:09:55,854 --> 02:09:58,152
He may seem tough,
but has a soft heart

1636
02:09:58,257 --> 02:10:01,226
He felt really bad about
you joining Daniel

1637
02:10:01,326 --> 02:10:05,422
I must tell you,
the path you've chosen is not good

1638
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:07,362
Mind your Business

1639
02:10:11,603 --> 02:10:12,501
Will see you Sir

1640
02:10:32,691 --> 02:10:33,658
Government General Hospital

1641
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:51,943
I want to see my husband, allow me

1642
02:11:04,189 --> 02:11:07,420
Look at this

1643
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,751
How much ever money you
want to give me, I don't want it

1644
02:11:10,863 --> 02:11:13,161
I don't want your Crores of Rupees

1645
02:11:13,265 --> 02:11:15,631
I want my Husband alive!!

1646
02:11:15,734 --> 02:11:19,636
He would proudly say
you're the best!!

1647
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:22,434
My children need their Father

1648
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:24,907
I am really scared

1649
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:29,709
You have to save my Husband

1650
02:11:29,815 --> 02:11:34,718
I am very scared
You have to save my Husband somehow

1651
02:11:35,487 --> 02:11:40,584
I am very scared

1652
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:58,209
The Police is investigating
it very earnestly

1653
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,005
We have got some clues

1654
02:12:00,112 --> 02:12:03,411
We will be ruthless in our search

1655
02:12:03,515 --> 02:12:06,143
And make sure we hand over
the Guilty in the hands of Law

1656
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:07,548
This will happen soon

1657
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:13,956
Our condolences on the death of our
Honorable Minister Mr. Kalai Pandian

1658
02:12:14,393 --> 02:12:16,827
The Minister's funeral procession
is nearing the Cremation Ground

1659
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:19,625
Funeral arrangements are in progress

1660
02:12:19,731 --> 02:12:23,497
I will come, campaign for you
and make you win

1661
02:12:23,602 --> 02:12:27,902
These were his last words to me
My dear Leader!!

1662
02:12:28,006 --> 02:12:38,849
This soil bears yourflesh and blood...
How can we cleanse ourselves of this sin

1663
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:42,648
Victory! Only a Victory can
wash these sins away

1664
02:12:42,754 --> 02:12:45,780
This is a Promise
Notjust mine

1665
02:12:45,891 --> 02:12:48,724
This is the Promise of the
people of this Soil

1666
02:12:50,429 --> 02:12:53,193
Daniel, don't cry please...

1667
02:12:53,298 --> 02:12:55,926
We are moved to see the state of mind
of this Candidate

1668
02:12:56,034 --> 02:12:59,936
Let's now go over and speak to
the people of this Constituency

1669
02:13:00,038 --> 02:13:06,409
I swear on my late Leader,
we will make Boxer Daniel win!!

1670
02:13:06,511 --> 02:13:09,412
Boxer Daniel will become an MLA
He will be our next "Nellaiyar"

1671
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,072
There he goes!!

1672
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:14,479
There has to be a meaning to the death of
our Minister Our vote is for Boxer Daniel

1673
02:13:14,586 --> 02:13:18,317
We get a 24 hour water supply in our area,
only because of the Minister

1674
02:13:18,423 --> 02:13:19,856
Hence our vote is only for Boxer Daniel

1675
02:13:19,958 --> 02:13:22,927
How is that?
Am I not good as a Politician?

1676
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:26,657
There's no doubting it,
you're the next "Nellaiyar"

1677
02:13:29,901 --> 02:13:35,533
- There he comes
- Hey! Come on!!

1678
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,734
Why did you give me a bomb without
even telling me about it?

1679
02:13:38,844 --> 02:13:41,278
If you had known,
you wouldn't have done it... would you?

1680
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,543
You should know Politics

1681
02:13:44,649 --> 02:13:46,742
You should be public about your Generosity

1682
02:13:47,052 --> 02:13:48,542
Discreet about your Deceit

1683
02:13:48,653 --> 02:13:50,746
We should give Interviews
claiming we're One

1684
02:13:50,856 --> 02:13:53,017
But we should backstab each other

1685
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:56,288
Even if he is your Enemy,
you have to smile and ask for his Vote

1686
02:13:56,395 --> 02:13:59,421
And even if he is your Friend, you will
have to kill him if you have to

1687
02:13:59,531 --> 02:14:04,366
And if you have to escape...
Kill your Brother

1688
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:08,698
Your Brother is no ordinary guy

1689
02:14:08,807 --> 02:14:12,903
He will sieve through all the details
and surely find out that

1690
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:14,035
You are the Culprit

1691
02:14:14,146 --> 02:14:15,636
And if you're caught, you'll be gone

1692
02:14:15,747 --> 02:14:17,840
You might as well get
ahead of him and finish him

1693
02:14:18,417 --> 02:14:22,786
Why are you thinking so much,
as though he is your own brother?

1694
02:14:23,622 --> 02:14:27,456
He is anyway torturing
you all your Life

1695
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:31,918
- Why don't you end this in one go?
- That's right

1696
02:14:32,164 --> 02:14:37,067
Who will take care of your Father,
if something happens to you?

1697
02:14:37,969 --> 02:14:42,201
Go finish him off, I'll have a very
special gift for you

1698
02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:02,143
What's this?

1699
02:16:04,389 --> 02:16:08,155
Daniel gave this to me
to kill you brother...

1700
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:11,688
- Kill me then
- Please forgive me

1701
02:16:13,665 --> 02:16:17,294
I came to seek forgiveness from
Sister in Law and you

1702
02:16:17,802 --> 02:16:20,635
I made a big mistake unknowingly

1703
02:16:24,609 --> 02:16:27,305
I did this to save Father

1704
02:16:29,881 --> 02:16:31,781
I saw no other way out

1705
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:36,109
Please save our Father
Please save him somehow

1706
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:41,986
- I will die
- Listen to me

1707
02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:04,879
Nothing will happen to you

1708
02:17:06,918 --> 02:17:11,082
I've paid the money
The surgery will happen

1709
02:17:11,389 --> 02:17:12,822
It will go on well

1710
02:17:14,259 --> 02:17:15,487
Can I sit?

1711
02:17:18,863 --> 02:17:23,562
The anger and hatred
you've seen in my eyes...

1712
02:17:23,668 --> 02:17:25,101
Was not on purpose

1713
02:17:26,938 --> 02:17:30,965
It happened because of a lot of accidents that
happened to me since childhood

1714
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:34,779
It was an accident that my father died
when I was a baby

1715
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:38,246
You coming in to my Life
was another accident

1716
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:45,922
Now, Mother dying is an accident
What is the problem between us?

1717
02:17:46,024 --> 02:17:47,321
It's been a tug of war

1718
02:17:47,425 --> 02:17:49,791
I've never changed...
Nor did you

1719
02:17:49,894 --> 02:17:53,660
We never met each other's expectations

1720
02:17:54,766 --> 02:17:57,257
That's the biggest mistake
all of us make

1721
02:17:57,502 --> 02:17:59,663
We want the other person
to live up to our expectations

1722
02:18:00,505 --> 02:18:02,405
I guess we expected too much

1723
02:18:02,574 --> 02:18:06,943
But there was one person
who understood us right

1724
02:18:07,178 --> 02:18:08,076
My mother!

1725
02:18:08,847 --> 02:18:14,615
I won't say she has become God...
Why, no one should call a Mother "God"

1726
02:18:14,719 --> 02:18:19,884
after she passes away...
She is God even as she lives

1727
02:18:21,726 --> 02:18:26,220
She has gone
But I want you

1728
02:18:28,066 --> 02:18:31,695
Every man needs at least one person with
whom he has a right to fight with

1729
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:33,900
Life would be wasted without it

1730
02:18:36,474 --> 02:18:39,443
If you're gone, who can I go
fight with so rightfully?

1731
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:47,181
All this while, I've never uttered this word,
cause it will pain me

1732
02:18:48,219 --> 02:18:50,847
But now,
not saying it is even more painful...

1733
02:18:57,896 --> 02:18:59,124
Father...

1734
02:19:03,902 --> 02:19:04,926
Father...

1735
02:19:39,204 --> 02:19:45,632
Long live our Candidate!!!

1736
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:48,838
Long live our Brother Daniel!!!

1737
02:19:48,947 --> 02:19:50,380
What's it?

1738
02:19:50,682 --> 02:19:52,650
- He has finished him
- Is that so?

1739
02:19:52,751 --> 02:19:55,652
- He killed him brilliantly
- Come my Dear!!

1740
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:58,113
Did you see the crowds?

1741
02:19:58,223 --> 02:20:04,651
Fame and Money are already pouring in
It's all because of you

1742
02:20:04,896 --> 02:20:08,662
I am proud of you

1743
02:20:08,967 --> 02:20:11,868
What do I give you in return for this?

1744
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:16,737
Money, Authority...
I should give you something beyond that

1745
02:20:16,841 --> 02:20:21,471
I'd told you...
I have a special gift for you...

1746
02:20:21,579 --> 02:20:25,015
Take this

1747
02:20:34,192 --> 02:20:37,559
This is my Mother's...
How did this...

1748
02:20:40,465 --> 02:20:43,025
Hold him back
He might get worked up

1749
02:20:43,201 --> 02:20:46,762
I was the one who killed your Mother

1750
02:20:50,742 --> 02:20:54,576
Velu!!!!!
Where is he?

1751
02:20:54,679 --> 02:20:56,704
- Who are all of you?
- This is Velan's mother

1752
02:20:58,817 --> 02:21:00,444
Greetings
Bless me

1753
02:21:00,885 --> 02:21:02,443
I am the Area Candidate

1754
02:21:02,887 --> 02:21:08,325
When a man like me wants to do good,
Your son is stopping it

1755
02:21:10,428 --> 02:21:14,797
Where's the money?
Only that money can make me win

1756
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:15,991
Where's the money?

1757
02:21:16,367 --> 02:21:17,994
Search for it

1758
02:21:18,303 --> 02:21:19,463
Where's the money?

1759
02:21:20,238 --> 02:21:21,466
Where have you kept it?

1760
02:21:22,507 --> 02:21:24,475
I won't leave without the money

1761
02:21:25,243 --> 02:21:28,007
Where is it?
Get up

1762
02:21:30,315 --> 02:21:31,475
Where's the money?

1763
02:21:31,783 --> 02:21:34,411
Where have you hidden it?

1764
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:36,346
Tell me where it is

1765
02:21:36,921 --> 02:21:40,618
I won't leave without the money
Where is it?

1766
02:21:40,725 --> 02:21:46,357
Where's the money
Tell me where it is

1767
02:21:46,598 --> 02:21:49,624
Don't act

1768
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:58,706
Do you want this?

1769
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:01,176
Give me the money
and I'll give you this

1770
02:22:04,482 --> 02:22:07,315
Tell me where my money is

1771
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:18,454
Where have you hidden the money?
Tell me

1772
02:22:18,563 --> 02:22:20,326
Aren't you finding it difficult?

1773
02:22:21,566 --> 02:22:26,868
Should I end this misery?
Should I?

1774
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:28,131
I will

1775
02:22:28,773 --> 02:22:31,139
Look, it's Election time

1776
02:22:31,442 --> 02:22:35,811
There should be no trace
of me coming here

1777
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:38,144
Put everything back the way it was

1778
02:22:39,651 --> 02:22:42,415
I am taking this in your Memory

1779
02:22:44,856 --> 02:22:48,485
I brought this in Memory of her

1780
02:22:48,593 --> 02:22:52,359
Not only did I kill your Mother

1781
02:22:52,463 --> 02:22:54,954
I was the one who burnt your Mill

1782
02:22:56,734 --> 02:22:59,100
And if I kill you as well

1783
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:04,573
I will have the joy
of wiping out my Enemy's family entirely

1784
02:23:04,676 --> 02:23:09,113
What will you do by being
the only one alive?

1785
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:13,910
Shankaralingam is on line

1786
02:23:15,286 --> 02:23:16,253
Tell me my dear Father In Law

1787
02:23:16,354 --> 02:23:18,584
Father in Law?
That doesn't stand a chance now

1788
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:19,850
What are you blabbering?

1789
02:23:19,958 --> 02:23:23,689
Your man Sadha has turned Approver,
he has blurted out everything

1790
02:23:23,795 --> 02:23:25,763
Rather, "Osthe" Velan has
made him blurt it all out

1791
02:23:25,930 --> 02:23:27,955
- Osthe Velan?
- Who else?

1792
02:23:28,066 --> 02:23:29,363
He is dead!!

1793
02:23:29,467 --> 02:23:32,959
Put on the Television
See him standing triumphantly

1794
02:23:36,608 --> 02:23:39,577
My name is Sadha
Have been with Daniel for 10 years

1795
02:23:39,677 --> 02:23:43,704
Daniel killed the Minister in order
to gain sympathy votes

1796
02:23:45,617 --> 02:23:48,848
I know where he bought the Bomb and
the mangoes to hide them in...

1797
02:23:48,953 --> 02:23:53,652
Notjust here,
I will say this in any Court

1798
02:23:53,758 --> 02:23:55,919
Not only has "Osthe" Velan arrested
all your Political dreams

1799
02:23:56,027 --> 02:24:01,465
He's heading to meet you
with an Arrest Warrant

1800
02:24:34,599 --> 02:24:36,499
Osthe has come

1801
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:43,967
Put him in the Vehicle

1802
02:25:13,104 --> 02:25:15,800
- Hurry up
- Leave me

1803
02:25:24,182 --> 02:25:26,412
Start the vehicle quick

1804
02:26:38,456 --> 02:26:41,084
Cover him as well
Let him die by his brother

1805
02:26:56,274 --> 02:26:57,764
Finish him

1806
02:27:19,096 --> 02:27:20,188
Your time is up, die

1807
02:28:02,139 --> 02:28:03,163
Are you all right?

1808
02:28:25,029 --> 02:28:29,329
What's the fuss about being a mirror?

1809
02:28:29,433 --> 02:28:33,597
I trapped you with one

1810
02:28:36,974 --> 02:28:40,000
You're shattered to pieces

1811
02:28:45,182 --> 02:28:48,276
Not shattered
I've risen in hundreds

1812
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:01,481
Brother

1813
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:16,300
He has tortured our mom to death

1814
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:18,039
Don't spare him

1815
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:27,448
Where's the money?

1816
02:30:30,688 --> 02:30:33,122
Where is it?

1817
02:32:35,479 --> 02:32:38,039
It's got to be 3 knots when
you tie the sacred thread

1818
02:32:38,149 --> 02:32:40,140
Don't forget

1819
02:32:41,552 --> 02:32:43,713
Can't you wear your Dhoti right?

1820
02:32:43,821 --> 02:32:46,654
Why are you chiding him? Even you
wore trousers to your wedding

1821
02:32:46,757 --> 02:32:49,658
- Nevertheless...
- That's enough, be patient

1822
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:55,062
- Please go ahead
- He doesn't even know to wear a Dhoti...

1823
02:32:55,166 --> 02:32:56,861
How do I call him my Brother?

1824
02:32:56,967 --> 02:32:59,663
Come here Premji...
He has worn his Dhoti well...

1825
02:32:59,770 --> 02:33:01,135
Should we claim he is your Brother?

1826
02:33:01,238 --> 02:33:02,205
He is your Grand Father not Brother

1827
02:33:02,306 --> 02:33:05,742
You can fight later...
I need to know some thing

1828
02:33:05,843 --> 02:33:08,471
- Do you want to know who Premji is?
- What a torture!!

1829
02:33:08,579 --> 02:33:11,946
I can play on only if I know
whether there's 1 Wedding or 2

1830
02:33:12,049 --> 02:33:14,677
There's just 1 Wedding,
but the collection is double!

1831
02:33:21,659 --> 02:33:22,887
Play the nuptial drums

1832
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,365
The Wedding is Over!!!

1833
02:33:31,502 --> 02:33:34,130
Osthe has Won
