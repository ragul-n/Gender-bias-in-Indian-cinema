Every father inculcates good thoughts,
habits in their children.

'' Let's wish for eternal happiness too.''

Sheddhu!
- Uncle! Uncle!

109
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:04,771
One minute!

110
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,104
Dad!

111
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,635
Sorry guys.
Dad is not made the Dean.

00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,080
Thank you for coming.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

What actually happened?

115
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,524
They have made changes
in the last minute, uncle.

116
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,222
They have made
Dr. Philip as the new Dean!

117
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,488
lt is one of them again.

118
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,355
We always get the second class treatment.

119
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,492
Dad!
- Hey lndu! Where are you going?

120
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,594
Just leave him alone!

121
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,310
Hey lndu! Mental! Stop right here.
Dad!

122
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,146
Today's destiny is the
result of our past actions.

123
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:55,624
What we do today will
decide our future tomorrow!

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,656
Abhi! l don't wish to complain
about what happened to me today.

125
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,365
Serves me right for betrayal. Cheers.

126
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,065
Betrayal eh? What are you saying, dad?

127
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,201
What has happened now?

128
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:11,501
ln the interest of earning more money
and working for a foreign country...

129
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:13,767
..l went against my dad's wishes.

130
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:16,734
Nope!

131
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,113
Actually, l have betrayed him.
- What?

132
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,148
Did you cheat on granddad?

133
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,686
Whenever l have asked you
about Grand dad, you refused to talk.

134
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,582
What actually happened, dad?

135
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,085
l was scared that you
guys won't tolerate me...

136
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,656
...if l told you how l betrayed granddad.

137
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,460
That's why l have never
told you guys about it.

138
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,726
But, l feel it is time
that you guys know about it.

139
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,393
We have a huge family.

140
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,042
This is my dad.

141
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,078
Your grand dad.

142
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,586
Mom!

143
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:04,357
My brother Bangari.

144
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,187
They are my sisters.

145
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,132
Not just in my house, my dad
was the head person for our village too.

146
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,377
My dad was there for everyone,
every house.

147
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,848
Even deadly diseases...

148
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,615
...were cured with medicines or tablets.

149
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,412
However, natives of my town died
of simple and less serious diseases.

150
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,756
My dad felt very bad about it.

151
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,485
My dad tried very hard
in bringing doctors to our town.

152
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,255
But, you don't get money
here like you earn in a city.

153
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,130
Doctors refused to come.

154
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,967
To put an end to all this,
my dad made me a doctor.

155
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,802
Once l was done with education,
l left back to my town.

156
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,315
Take this.
This is from Lord Sai Baba's temple.

157
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,416
All will be fine. Take care.

158
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,991
Hey! Make sure to serve
buttermilk for the guests.

159
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,391
Sir!
- Go.

160
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,656
Please come.

161
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,260
How are you, dear?

162
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,891
Hey! Why do you wait?
Take her to the hospital in city.

163
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,935
We want the baby to
be born in our own hospital.

164
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,561
lf it is a boy baby,
l will give him your name.

165
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:22,935
lf it's a girl,
l will give her ma'am's name.

166
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,734
Wait for little more time.
My son will be here.

167
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,208
Brother in law is here!
l'll go receive him.

168
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,106
Carry on!

169
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,672
Brother! Greetings. Please come.

170
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:35,775
Look, son in law! l thought
you wouldn't complete this hospital.

171
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,986
However, you have done it now.
You have proved what you are.

172
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,521
lt is all God's blessing, Brother.
- Brother in law!

173
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:40,586
Chandrasekar is at home.

174
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,180
He is calling you.
- What is he doing there? Call him.

175
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,051
No. l think it is better you go there.

176
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,720
Oh! l will be back in sometime.
You please take care here.

177
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,958
Hey Chandu!
- Dad!

178
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,160
There are lot of people waiting for you.
Why did you call me here?

179
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,566
Come. Let's leave. Come on!

180
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,934
One minute, dad.
- The auspicious time will be over soon.

181
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,436
Dad, please listen to me.
- Everyone has come already.

182
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,634
Please dad. Listen to me.
- We can talk later.

183
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,267
Please listen to me, dad.
- What is it?

184
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,609
Who is this girl?
- She is Kausalya.

185
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,810
Oh!

186
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,750
You both are in love, right.
l will get you married.

187
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,547
Come! We'll lose the auspicious moment.
- Please listen to me.

188
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,347
This girl also studied medicine with me.

189
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:14,890
Her entire family has settled in America.

190
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,889
Okay.

191
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:19,792
l wish to get married
to her and settle in America.

192
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,689
America eh?

193
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,270
What will happen to this hospital then?

194
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:32,937
l didn't know that you
were building a hospital here.

195
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,034
You do need a hospital
for you to practice, right.

196
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:39,005
That is why l built this hospital.
This is why l made you a doctor.

197
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:42,451
lt is not just my investment.
lt has investments from Government too.

198
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:45,454
We have invested in the confidence
that you will take care of them.

199
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:46,916
Why do you say that
you want to go to America?

200
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,582
America is a huge nation, dad.

201
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,225
There are much more opportunities there.
l can have luxurious life.

202
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,723
Not just that,
l can earn much more than what l do here.

203
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,764
lf l go there,
l am sure l can become big and famous.

204
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,628
l am sure you will become a big man.

205
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,599
But, what will happen to this village?
- This village.

206
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,164
A compounder is more than
sufficient to handle this villagers...

207
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,499
...these wretched agriculturists...

208
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,277
Wretched agriculturists eh?

209
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,444
Don't forget that you were
born to one such agriculturist.

210
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:21,650
lt is because they work in
all those trench, we get to eat food.

211
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:26,557
lt is with their hard owned money...

212
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,462
...that you stand here as
doctor waiting to go to America.

213
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,726
Honey!
- You--

214
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,498
Stop all this. Why do you talk like this?

215
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,436
Don't say all this while
he is talking about his wedding.

216
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,939
Dear! Please come this side. Honey!
Come this side. Let's bless the couple.

217
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:41,441
Shut up!

218
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,039
What do you say finally?

219
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,381
l have given them word
that l will come there.

220
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,440
So!

221
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:52,680
l can't help, dad.

222
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,382
l have to go to America.

223
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,848
Get lost!

224
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,620
Dad!
- Don't address me like that.

225
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,193
One who is not useful
to his people and his town...

226
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,196
...is equal to being dead.

227
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:12,567
From this very moment,
you are dead to me.

228
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,038
Later, when you come
to know of my death...

229
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,748
...please don't come to
perform last rites as my son.

230
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,518
Honey!
- lf you want him...

231
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,611
...you can also get out with him.

232
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:38,161
Please wait, dear.
Doctor will be here in sometime.

233
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,201
Oh God! Looks like she
will deliver any moment.

234
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,101
Ma'am! Please hurry up.
Take her to the hospital.

235
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,163
Please take her to the
town hospital immediately.

236
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,569
Hey! Arrange for a vehicle immediately.

237
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,236
Hurry up!
- Careful.

238
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:50,540
Lakshmi! There's nothing to worry.

239
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,106
Lakshmi!

240
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,417
Lakshmi! Look at me.

241
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:07,695
First, try to control affairs at home.
After that, we can talk to public.

242
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,594
l'll take your leave. Thanks.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,491
Come man!
Half a day has gone utter waste.

244
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,735
l am unable to open
this hospital as promised.

245
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,806
Please forgive me.

246
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,493
Have you been away from Grand
dad all along, for a such a small issue?

247
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,661
You could have solved
it all with a simple sorry.

248
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,591
lt is a simple thing.

249
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:47,802
You don't know about
your Grand dad well enough.

250
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,564
He will give his life for
a person who believes in him.

251
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,542
He will never forgive the ones...

252
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,400
...who betray him.

253
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,277
He will never forgive me.

254
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,439
He will never let me in to his house.

255
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,787
ln the fantasy of working abroad...

256
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,251
...and lead a luxurious life...

257
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,491
...l have made a mistake
of coming here to work.

258
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,427
Dad!

259
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,742
Dad! Brother.

260
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:43,384
Abhi!
- Dad!

261
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,987
Hi dad! Just like you told last night.

262
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:49,361
Today's destiny depends
on our past actions.

263
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:52,628
Similarly, tomorrow's destiny
depends on our present actions.

264
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,793
lsn't it right, dad?
Tomorrow our future...

265
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,166
...is totally dependent
on what we do today.

266
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,106
So! l am going to
meet Grand dad tomorrow.

267
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,435
l am leaving to lndia today.

268
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,778
l know grand dad is angry with you.
l am sure he won't be upset with me.

269
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,043
Or do you think l will let him be angry?
l am after all his grandson.

270
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,314
l will go on your behalf
and apologize to grand dad.

271
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:16,384
l will try.
lf he does not accept, l will try harder.

272
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,627
But, l will make sure...

273
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,891
...to get you back with Grand dad.

274
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,131
Wish me good luck. Love you both!

275
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,768
Dad! l am getting scared.

276
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:29,764
What will happen now?

277
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,890
Excuse me! Can l take a picture?

278
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,452
Thank you!

279
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,060

00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,505
That means it is a cock fight!

381
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,338

Oops. Give it to me.

00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,996
''The brave one is here.''

399
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:21,002
''He fights injustice
and is like Lord Narasimha!''

400
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,089
Come. Let's go.

401
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,523

00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:55,070
Sir! What is this Pillipithru?

409
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:59,040
Ouch! Ouch!

00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:00,376
l will skin you alive!
- Ouch!

411
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:03,174
Will you stop with that?

412
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,084
Where is my Rs. 2 Lakhs?

He took money from me.
Why are you hitting me?

417
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,859

00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,732
Go catch him!

419
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,590
Where are you trying to escape?
Where? Take him away.

420
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:55,295
Arrest everyone.
Don't let them out till l tell you.

421
00:30:56,372 --> 00:30:59,341
During Sankaranthi Festival,
everyone will come home...

422
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,875
...get together and celebrate it.

423
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,638
These useless people have ruined it...

424
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,475
...the festivity by
engaging in cock fights.

425
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,242
Wastrels! Useless ones!

426
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:10,045
Hey! Who has flattened the cycle tyres?

427
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,584

430
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,115
l have never seen you
before in this village.

431
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:17,954
Did you come to participate
in this cock fight?

432
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,719
No, sir!

433
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,886
Oh! Did you come to see it then?
- Sir! You have mistaken.

434
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,827
Then, what have you come for?

Sir! l came to learn agriculture, sir.

436
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,891
Can't you speak in Telugu? Fashion eh?
- Agriculture--

00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,694
l am here to study about farming.

438
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:31,137
Are you here to learn farming?
- Yeah!

439
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,273
Go ahead and learn!

440
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,104
Sir! Sir! Bike.

441
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,674
Sir!
- Why are you following us everywhere?

442
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,082
Didn't we ask you to leave?
- Sir! Stop it. What is your problem?

443
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,487
Sir! Sir! Excuse me.

444
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,989
Oh my God! lt is all my ill luck.

445
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:50,885
l don't know what wrong l did...

446
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,620
...to be born to such a person.
- Hey Bangari!

447
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:53,888
Aren't you ashamed to
talk like this to your dad?

448
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:54,894
Keep quiet, uncle!
- What?

449
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,362
For all that you have done to us,
we have just pushed you out of house.

450
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:57,261
Dad!

451
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,959
We have let you stay here in this village
only because you are his son.

452
00:31:59,034 --> 00:31:59,591
So--

453
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:01,794
This should be my uncle then!

454
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:04,100
l don't gain much from staying here.

455
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,936
He want let me engage in cock fights,
bets, drinking.

456
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,032
How else can l earn my living?

457
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,509
Can l ask him to part
with my share of wealth?

458
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,939
This is how he chased out his other son.

459
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:16,210
l am the only son he has left,
to do his last rites.

460
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:18,309
l don't care about
who does my last rites.

461
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,649
Ask him to lead a righteous
life at least for a day.

462
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:26,724
lt is not important for your
name to appear on the voter's list.

463
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:29,288
We must strive hard and earn a good name.

464
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,423
Superb! Once more, sir!

465
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,660
Sir!

466
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,000

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,771
Grandfather!
- Papa!

468
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:42,937
Papa! Dad!

469
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:46,344

- Papa!

470
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,047

00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:35,587
Papa! We are all here.

485
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:45,201

Hey, ls it time to talk about sweetheart,

489
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,682
She is just a small girl.

490
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,984
Sir! Sir! Don't--
- Ouch!

491
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,694
Didn't l tell you that
l'll take care of it on my own?

492
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,593
Sir! You can't risk now.
She is a small girl. Please come back.

493
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,236
Papa! Papa!

494
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:18,803
Mom!

495
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:22,366

Have you gone mad?
Why did you take her to the terrace?

00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,241
Everything is fine now. Let it go.

516
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,441
Look, dad!
- Drink some water.

517
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:41,114
Papa!

518
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,155
Give way. Move aside.

519
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,754
Let the effects of evil...

520
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,698
...bad minded people, negativity...

521
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,869
...all be destroyed with this.

522
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:04,935
Hey man! Grand mom
is asking you stand here.

523
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:09,245
Today is Saturday. She will not talk.
l will do it on her behalf.

524
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,978
l am Chandrasekhar's son.
l am your grand son.

525
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,085
Hey! Why have you come here?

526
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,985
This old woman wants to know who you are.

527
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:52,060
Shut up!
- Grand mom.

528
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,564
Baby won't talk today.
That doesn't stop her from questioning.

529
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,395
This boy is from abroad.
He has come from London.

530
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:08,770
He has come to learn about farming.
He will stay with us for few days.

531
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:12,605
Yeah! Yeah! Go ahead and learn from him.

532
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:14,774
My dad indeed does
farming on large scale.

533
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,750
You leave, man.
- You!

534
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,611
You don't listen to him. He is like this.

535
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:22,449
Hey! Show him around the house
and arrange for his stay here.

536
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:23,285
Yes, Father in law.

537
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,258
Don't hesitate.
Think this as your own house.

538
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,096
What is your name?
- Abhi!

539
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:30,958
l mean Abhiram!

540
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:33,098
Ram! Okay.

541
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:34,896
Ram! Nice!

542
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,631
l will take my luggage.
- That's okay.

543
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,603
Wow! Your house looks like a palace.

544
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,231
This is our father in
law's ancestral property.

545
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,331
He sees this as a temple
and takes care of it accordingly.

546
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,775
Yeah... But you are--
- l am Kasi! His elder son in law.

547
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,044
He is another son in law.
- lntroduce me too!

548
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:46,910
Go do your work.

549
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,880
My father in law does not
stay with his sons.

550
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:50,246
How will he be happy,
if he stays away from his daughters too?

551
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,376
Hence both of us decided
to stay back here.

552
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:52,078
Yes!

553
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,320
l am the father of that little girl...

554
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,550
...you saved few minutes back.

555
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:09,031
Oh! Are you the one?

556
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:12,695
All here are extremely thankful
to you for saving her life.

557
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:15,937
She is Chitra. She is Balraju's niece.

558
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,204
She stays with us.

559
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,507
Take this sweet, uncle.

560
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,205
Thank you, sweetheart!

561
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:22,381
This is superb!

562
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:23,974
Hey! Come! Come! Come!

563
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,542
See what l got for
all of you from London?

564
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,718
Here you go, my favourite chocolate.
- Thank you, uncle.

565
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,154
Give me a kiss!
- Come here.

566
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,321
hank you, sweetheart!

567
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,882
Aunt asked me to give you all this.

568
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,652
Will you have these kind of stuff to eat?

569
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,127
Why do you ask like that? l will have.

570
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,392
You are from abroad right! That's why!
- Nothing like that.

571
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,831
My dad cooks this kind of stuff for us.

572
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,835
Why does your dad cook?

573
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:42,967
Won't your mom do the cooking?

574
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:46,638
My mother died long ago.
- Oh! ls it so?

575
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,276
l lost my parents too!

576
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,834
Oh! l am very sorry.

577
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,080
l am sorry too!
You have lost your mother, right.

578
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:57,209
Okay. Are we friends?
Then, let's shake hands like friends do.

579
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:59,714
Friends!
- Yeah!

580
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,149
But, l like the whole thing.

581
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:05,059
Big house!
Grand dad, Grand mom and lots of people.

582
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:09,059
l am very happy to know
that they are all our family.

583
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:11,028
Do you want to know a breaking news?
- What is it?

584
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:12,929
Grand dad has your garlanded photo of you
in the living room (lndicates dead person)

585
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,364
What? This is not funny.

586
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:20,166
Didn't l tell you before?
l know my dad well.

587
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,004
How is my mom doing?

588
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:25,276
Did you get to meet Bangari?

589
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,307
What is he doing?

590
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,742
He seems to be a mysterious person.
He doesn't stay at home.

591
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,783
l am not able to figure out why.

592
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,252
Please be careful. Grand dad
is quite sensitive and emotional.

593
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:44,020
Though l am miles apart, l feel
happy to know that they are all happy.

594
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,223
We shouldn't disturb that happiness.

595
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:50,500
Bye!
- Bye! Come back soon.

596
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,071
Good night, dad! Good night, lndu!

597
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:53,299
Good night!
- Miss you both.

598
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,734
Yes! Come back.

599
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,373
Useless fellow!!

600
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,506
My dad has been Member
of Parliament for 4 terms.

601
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,106
l am a Member of Parliament too!

602
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,778
l planned to make you Member of
Legislative Assembly in coming elections.

603
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:07,685
How dare you engage
in silly Cock fights like this?

604
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:08,949
Don't hit him!

605
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,116
All this is because
of your uncle Balaraju.

606
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,327
He let go of his son Bangari...

607
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,624
...and got your son alone arrested.

608
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:19,256
After all, he is my uncle.

609
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,737
So, last time, l fell at his
feet to support me during elections.

610
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:27,138
He didn't.
Everything went down the drain.

611
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:31,474
- He is my co brother.

612
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,882
He is just envious of our growth.

613
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,680
So, drink another glass of coffee!

614
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,683
Can we spare him just like that?
We'll have to do something.

615
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:43,485
Hey! You should never
mix anger and politics.

616
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,887
You should fall at their feet,
when necessary.

617
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:50,487
Once done,
you should throw them.

618
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,864
We must concentrate on
setting up the beer factory here.

619
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,139
First, let us pay attention towards that.

620
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:04,038
We can take care of my
brother in law on a later date.

621
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,872
Good morning Sir!
l mean ''Suprabatham'' (Good morning)

622
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:42,682
lt is ''Subhodayam.''
- Err...''Subhodayam.''

623
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:45,412
No matter where you are,
you shouldn't forget your mother tongue.

624
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:48,251
Sure. Master! ls this Karate?
- This is called ''Karasamu.''

625
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,481
Yeah! Can l learn it too?

626
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,649
You will break your bones!

627
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:55,321
No pain, no gain, master.
l can never learn without getting hurt.

628
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,657
Oh!

629
00:41:58,967 --> 00:41:59,934
Greetings, master!

630
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:02,060
You don't greet your opponent
like this in Karasamu.

631
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,434
Oh! Then, how do l do it?

632
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:04,597
Narayana! Show him.

633
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:31,593
He has learnt it in no time.
- l took almost 10-15 days to learn this.

634
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,366
He is no ordinary boy.

635
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:36,199
He is a genius boy!
- Please tell it in Telugu.

636
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:37,864
Oh! You did say it in Telugu, right.

637
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:42,739
Master!
- Hit me!

638
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:52,743
Master! Get ready.
- Wow!

639
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:55,152
Will you teach him as to, how to hit you?

640
00:42:55,223 --> 00:42:56,656
Teach him well.
- Look here.

641
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:57,816
Ouch!
- He should master it.

642
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:59,553
Master! He is--

643
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,598
Satya!
- Darling.

644
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,570
Sister!
- Hi Satya!

645
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,007
Hello uncle!

646
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,944
Grand dad!

647
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:28,014
l missed you!

648
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,557
Did you study that hard? Couldn't
you come home during festival too?

649
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,685
Why have you lost so much weight?
- Don't you eat properly?

650
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:37,390
l had to study day and
night for my semester exams.

651
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:40,124
Only then l will get good marks. Right?

652
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:42,830
Now, Balaraju can shape
up his moustache in pride.

653
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,165
What a logic!

654
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,434
Ram!

655
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,099
Yes, master.

656
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:54,609
This is Satya, my grand daughter.

657
00:43:54,682 --> 00:43:57,776
He is from London. He has
come here to learn about agriculture.

658
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:02,586
Hi!
- Greetings!

659
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,221
That's our culture. Learn it from him.

660
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:09,524
Hey! Get ready. We'll leave in sometime.
- Sure!

661
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:15,427
Stupid.

662
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:16,697
Where is grand mom?

663
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:21,934
This day is just boring.
- lt is always like that.

664
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,942
You are dumb.

665
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,672
Take this.
- Why are you giving me this?

666
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:27,077
You dumb fellow!
- Why do you look so dull, my boy?

667
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:28,638
Nothing at all.

668
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,613
When my dad threw me out of house...

669
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,585
...all the buffaloes in
my house kept looking at me.

670
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,282
They were looking at me as though,
this was something they expected.

671
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:41,094
However--
- lt must be because.

672
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:44,893
They felt bad that someone from their
group is being insulted. Poor thing!

673
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,365
How dare you call me a buffalo?

674
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,994
How many siblings do you have?
- We are just 2 of us.

675
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,435
l have a younger sister.
- Greetings, sir.

676
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:54,170
What does your dad do in London?
- He is--

677
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:56,139
What?
- He is a doctor, sir.

678
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:59,146
Hey! Hey!

679
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:01,546
Run! Run away! Take all this.

680
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:04,147
Run! Run!

681
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:10,057
Run now! l will kill you.

682
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,115
Useless idiots! Drunkards!

683
00:45:14,262 --> 00:45:15,559
They are jobless.

684
00:45:17,432 --> 00:45:20,663
Master! This looks like a big hospital.
Why is it locked like this?

685
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,197
The one who was supposed to be here...

686
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:26,236
...died before its inauguration.

687
00:45:26,608 --> 00:45:29,304
Useless ones!
- Oh God! Grand dad.

688
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:33,143
Enough. Stop singing his praises.

689
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:35,348
You guys haven't enquired
anything about him.

690
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,211
How will you let a stranger
like him stay in our house?

691
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:40,044
You husband is senseless!
- Shut up!

692
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,849
How can you talk like that?
- You stop it.

693
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,758
He is a good boy, dear.

694
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,260
Have you ever seen our
Balraju accept someone that easily?

695
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,454
Exactly. Tell her.

696
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:15,013
Hey! Why has everyone crowded here?
What has happened?

697
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:24,596
Hey! Stop it.

00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:25,663
Let me go deal this.

00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:29,569
Stop it.

700
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:34,775
You? What are you doing here?

701
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:37,868
Do you think l'll get scared,
if you bring people along with you?

702
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:41,240
Why do you get involved in all this?

703
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,414
There is no cock fight here.

704
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:49,456
This is all Government dealings.

705
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:52,523
Don't you dare get involved in this.
- Hey!

706
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,363
Hey! Stop it all of you. Stop it.

00:47:00,802 --> 00:47:01,996
Hey! Stop this.

709
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,359
l asked you to stop it.

710
00:47:03,638 --> 00:47:05,071
Why do you get involved in this fights?

711
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:07,437
Why do you come in?
Am l not talking to him?

712
00:47:09,544 --> 00:47:11,409
Hey! Hey! Shut up.

713
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:15,946
lt is our mistake, grand dad. He is still
a small boy and didn't know to talk.

714
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:18,381
That's fine. What is happening here?

715
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:20,218
Good morning, grand dad!

716
00:47:20,388 --> 00:47:23,880
According to lndian Constitution.
- What is wrong with Telugu people.

717
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:25,485
We do have our language, right.

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,591
Say it in Telugu.
- l feel talking in English is more...

719
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:29,890
...powerful and strong
than talking in Telugu.

720
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:32,064
How do you say this in Telugu?

721
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,963
''Pratyekantaka.. (lndian Constitution)''
- Say it in, Telugu.

722
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:34,967
l said it in Telugu, sir.

723
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:36,901
Grand dad, l find it a bit
difficult to explain it in Telugu.

724
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:38,972
lt is as provided in the section.

00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:52,647
lf you want to continue with your rules
and section, we will break your bones.

731
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:57,223
Do you understand? Please leave.

732
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,424
Ask your dad to meet me.
- Sure, grand dad.

733
00:47:59,494 --> 00:48:00,586
We'll take your leave, grand dad.

734
00:48:00,895 --> 00:48:01,884

You are a rock star! So nice.

Okay. Please don't tell about
our meeting at pub to my grand dad.

745
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:49,232

00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:55,377

Okay.

757
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:16,969
How much do you want?
Aren't you doing all this for money?

758
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:19,800
Can you buy me all
these lands in the town?

759
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:21,500
You won't be able to buy it.

760
00:49:21,943 --> 00:49:23,274
You can't buy it for me.

761
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:28,570
However, l wish to be happy everyday.

762
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,544

...l will delete these photos?

764
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,616
While l am trying to strike a deal,
don't you dare act smart.

765
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:39,824
Delete it. Else--

766
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:41,560
Master!

767
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,994
Disgusting!

00:49:58,346 --> 00:49:59,904
Tomorrow--
- Excuse me!

769
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,078
Wow!
- Look!

770
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,378
What is all this?
- Festival of lamps.

771
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:04,145
What does that mean?

772
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,446
We pray for the prosperity of the family.

773
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:07,248
Married woman offer prayers.

774
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,749
Oh! Then, why is this
unmarried girl doing this?

775
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:11,689
She is praying to get a ideal match.

776
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,248
Thank you!

777
00:50:12,326 --> 00:50:14,886
What should unmarried
men do to get good match?

778
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,356
Good question!
- We don't have any such thing for us.

779
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,762
That is why we are stuck with such wifes.

780
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:19,525
What?

781
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,468
Oh! We meant that, even without
such prayers we have got good wife.

782
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,698
We take such good care of you.
- Cool down.

783
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,241
He means to say that
no one is as good as you are.

784
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:28,808
Exactly.

785
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,741
l had gone to a pub in Hyderabad.

786
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:32,472
Do you know how girls come there?
- How?

787
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,912
They wear such short skirts
and drink almost a whole bottle.

788
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:36,174
Like this--

789
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,684
Ouch! They break legs too.

790
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,117
This is for grand mom.

791
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,179
This is for grand dad.

00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,014

00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,061
Oh! Those are just burns.
- What do you say?

796
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,229
Why didn't you treat it?

797
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:59,830
All this is normal for us.
Womenfolk get these burns while cooking.

798
00:50:59,941 --> 00:51:01,499
Wait here. l'll go bring the ointment.
- Hey!

799
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:04,601
lt's okay. l am used to this pain.

00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,507
This can't be done away with ointment.

As long as l am here, l won't let you
bear pain. l will come back soon.

You are such a good boy!

Baby! Are you going
to serve us food or not?

804

Oh God! l will arrange for it now.

805
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:27,992
Chitra! Come along.

806
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,626
Come quickly.

807
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:42,545
What is all this? Aren't you
ashamed to do this before everyone?

808
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:44,043
My God!

809
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,169

00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,936
''Will you rotate it like a top (Toy)?''

816
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:49,950
''How do l get you?''

817
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:55,978
''You make me happy with your
kisses and excite me with your hugs.''

818
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:01,389
''Within seconds, you slip away.''

819
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:04,397

''My life is filled
with this village girl.''

''With her beside me,

825
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:58,974
'' Unlike usual, this is as
special as a moon on full moon day.''

826
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:04,950
'' Happiness is getting
hug from the moon.''

827
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,888
''lf she appears like a flower
and pricks you like a thorn.''

828
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:16,795
'' There is nothing
more saddening than that.''

829
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:22,536
''Life teaches that
nothing lasts forever.''

830
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:30,645
''We must play the role of
guests and keep moving forward.''

831
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:37,722
''Without this girl,
the entire life will go waste.''

Don't you know that my brother

854
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,051
Dad! Don't come in between.
Am l not talking to him?

855
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:22,414
Uncle.. The point is--

856
00:57:22,957 --> 00:57:29,795
For years now, my dad has plans to do
something beneficial for the natives here.

857
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,294
So, he has struggled a lot to

863
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:45,708
After this-- Hold this.

864
00:57:45,779 --> 00:57:49,442
ln the surrounding we can
construct this shopping complex...

865
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:52,744
...multiplex, post office.
- Sir! lt is not post office.

866
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,215
They are lnternational lT corridors.

867
00:57:55,856 --> 00:57:56,618
Yes. The same.

868
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:01,718
This is it, uncle. By doing this,
we can develop our village big time.

869
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:03,592
What are you going
to produce in this factory?

870
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:04,459
Beer, uncle!

871
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:05,589
Beer eh?
- Yes. Beer.

872
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,293
Anyone who wants to drink beer in
neighbouring areas...

873
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,459
...will have to come here.

874
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,403
Brother! This is worth 2000 crores.

875
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,767
We offer you 10 percent
partnership in it.

876
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:18,538
Which means you get 200 crores, sir.

877
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:24,710
All this is for you to help
us in setting up this project.

878
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:27,352
That's why we are here.
- 200 crores!

879
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:33,318
Just for me to shut my trap.
That's like a great deal.

880
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:39,321
So, if we are going to set up
this factory, we will all have profits.

881
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,190
Yes, uncle.
- That's wonderful.

882
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,698
However, everyone of
them will get addicted...

883
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:49,500
...to the poison you propose
to produce in this factory.

884
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,805
They will all lay on roads in
inebriated state and create nuisance.

885
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,510
Acres of fertile land will be affected
by the drains released from factory.

886
00:58:58,652 --> 00:58:59,812
They will die.

887
00:59:01,655 --> 00:59:03,816
lf we spoil such kind of fertile lands,
cultivation is lost.

888
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:06,422
Then, what will our children get to eat?

889
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:10,694
Fertile lands are mother who feeds us.

890
00:59:11,498 --> 00:59:14,956
As long as l live, l won't let you
turn the fertile land into a graveyard.

891
00:59:16,503 --> 00:59:19,904
Come. Didn't l tell you earlier?

892
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:26,606
As long as my brother is alive, we will
never be able to set up this factory.

893
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,916
Even if l die,
l will not let it happen here.

894
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,751
Come, let's go.
We have wasted all our time here.

895
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:47,124
''Adoration to Lord Vishnu.''

896
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:50,199
Whose photo is this, grand mom?

897
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,898
He is your elder uncle, dear.
- Baby!

898
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:56,402
l am coming, dear.

899
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,221
My God!

900
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:12,118
He seems to have mastered the art,
father in law.

901
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,825
Sir! Careful!

902
01:00:22,436 --> 01:00:24,427
No need!
- He is too old for it.

903
01:00:24,505 --> 01:00:27,099
He is scared of losing
to an youngster like you.

904
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:29,506
You shut your trap.
Father in law!

905
01:00:30,644 --> 01:00:32,771
Wow! The old man has.

906
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:37,811
Come on! l am ready to wage bet.
ls anyone ready here?

907
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:48,958
Sorry! Sorry! l made a mistake.

908
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,223
Hit him on the head instead of his back.
lt can help us get rid of him.

909
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:52,822
Bangari Sir! Keep quiet for sometime.

910
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,431
l missed it.

911
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:57,499
What is all this, sir?
Master, please.

912
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:01,298
Father in law! Be careful.
- Uncle, you may get hurt. Stop it.

913
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:03,400
Not here. Aim to hit my head.
- Father in law!

914
01:01:05,512 --> 01:01:08,447
Ouch!
- Please! Stop this.

915
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,276
He is a small boy!
- Uncle!

916
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:12,714
Take this sweet. Aunt has made it.
- This side.

917
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:13,946
Chitra! Move this side.

918
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:15,785
What is this, master? You haven't
been able to hit me even once.

919
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:16,412
Father in law.

920
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,583
Shame! Shame, master.
- Please. We'll stop this.

921
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:23,419
Uncle!
- Don't come in between.

922
01:01:24,198 --> 01:01:26,257
What is happening here?
- Father in law!

923
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,231
Ouch! Ahhh!

924
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:30,760
Let's stop it. Please, father in law.
- Master, slow down.

925
01:01:30,871 --> 01:01:33,032
Dad! Please stop it.

926
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,301
Why do you come in between?

927
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:36,904
Satya, come this.

928
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,171
Master!
l guess you are too old for this.

929
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:41,043
Grand dad!
- You learnt the art from me...

930
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:42,775
...and you dare to call me for a fight.

931
01:01:45,152 --> 01:01:48,883
Let's stop it.
You are too old for all this.

932
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:03,763
Hey! Did you hurt yourself?
- Hold it.

933
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:07,005
Bring the medicine box.

934
01:02:07,908 --> 01:02:08,431
Thank you!

935
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:10,237
Didn't l warn you not to do this with me?

936
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:12,004
You are indeed great, master!

937
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,206
Master! Please forgive me.
- For what?

938
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,181
As l broke an important person's photo.

939
01:02:17,284 --> 01:02:19,980
Sigh! Who told you all this?

940
01:02:20,187 --> 01:02:22,849
Master, if you hang his photo among
all these important ones...

941
01:02:22,956 --> 01:02:24,321
...l am sure he is important too.

942
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,450
Hey! Remove that from here.

943
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:46,135
What is it, ma'am?
- You have resolved all our worry, dear.

944
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:10,929
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

945
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:16,372
Hey! Thank you! Thank you! Love you!

946
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:23,006
ls he gay?
- Sorry.

947
01:03:37,097 --> 01:03:38,257
Chitra!

948
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:41,731
Chitra! Chitra!

949
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,631
Come here for a minute!
- My God!

950
01:03:43,704 --> 01:03:44,728
Come fast!

951
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:46,768
Come and help me undo the buttons.

952
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:49,506
Come fast. The blouse is too tight.

953
01:03:50,377 --> 01:03:51,935
Undo it. Quickly.

954
01:03:54,214 --> 01:03:56,079
What is your problem? Do it quickly.

955
01:04:05,325 --> 01:04:06,587
Oh my God!

956
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:09,722
Ahhh! Mom!
- Silence.

957
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,424
Hey! Phone! Phone! lf you tell
about this, l'll show them your pictures.

958
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:16,063
What happened? Why did you scream?

959
01:04:16,503 --> 01:04:18,027
What happened?
Why did you scream so loudly?

960
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:19,705
l wanted to check if l can scream loudly.

961
01:04:19,806 --> 01:04:20,534
Huh?

962
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,436
She has gone mad.
- Do you think l am jobless.

963
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:26,240
Don't go complain to grand mom,
that l hit you.

964
01:04:26,313 --> 01:04:27,940
She is turning in to a devil,
day after day.

965
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:33,343
Did you wish to know how
it is if you scream loudly?

966
01:04:36,323 --> 01:04:37,415
Take that towel off.

967
01:04:38,392 --> 01:04:39,916
Please take that towel off, dear.

968
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:41,785
Now!

969
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:46,254
l think you should hit the gym soon.

970
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:51,534
There are girls, who are old
enough to get married in that house.

971
01:04:51,705 --> 01:04:53,639
We are on high risk in having
that guy around these girls.

972
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:56,732
Exactly, uncle.
You are right. Just like the elders say.

973
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,777
What? Do you still remember all those?

974
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:01,271
There's no use of getting
irritated with me, dear.

975
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:04,309
We must cut his tuft
and throw him out of the house

976
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,413
Let's promise on this.

977
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:08,486
This isn't alcohol. This is our blood.

978
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:10,146
l'll show what this Bangari can do!

979
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:13,723
He is been threatening me with
those photos. l don't know what to do.

980
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:38,649
When will you come? Don't delay, sweetie.

981
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:42,446
Do l tell your grand dad?
Do l show him all these pics?

982
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:45,056
Please! Please! Please! Don't tell him.
- Oh!

983
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,160
We'll do this. No one should see us.

984
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,829
Let's go out.
After that, you can do whatever you want.

985
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,291
Hey! What is this?
Your skirt has a pocket too.

986
01:05:57,804 --> 01:05:59,499
Wow! Beautiful!

987
01:05:59,673 --> 01:06:02,403
Dear! This place is looking so sexy!

988
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:05,836
This place is very romantic. Ain't it?

989
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,571
Should l give you?
Or will you take it on your own?

990
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,242
lf you give, l will take it from you.

991
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:15,077
Wow! You seem to be talented.

992
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:16,679
Are you that brave?

993
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:25,157
Uncle!

994
01:06:25,665 --> 01:06:27,428
Are you getting scared?
- What is all this?

995
01:06:27,534 --> 01:06:30,025
What are you doing here?
- Look, My dear boy!

996
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:32,194
You can play with children. That's good.

997
01:06:32,439 --> 01:06:35,101
You shouldn't play with your
cell phone as battery (charge) will die.

998
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:37,267
Return all pictures of her
that you have on your phone. Give it.

999
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:38,140
Which photo?

1000
01:06:38,345 --> 01:06:39,835
Give it. Give those pictures to me.

1001
01:06:40,013 --> 01:06:42,140
Hello! l don't have any phone.
- Give it at once.

1002
01:06:47,454 --> 01:06:48,887
Ouch!

1003
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,284
What is this?
- Two of our men have fallen down.

1004
01:06:54,127 --> 01:06:56,391
l am good at martial arts.

1005
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,129
Mar-- Karate!

1006
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:00,062
That's why, sir. l don't prefer fighting.

1007
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:02,358
You don't want fights, right.
Give me those photos.

1008
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,665
Mother promise.
l don't have my cell phone.

1009
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:06,137
See. You can check me.
- Oh God!

1010
01:07:06,406 --> 01:07:07,964
Do you plan to hit us
when we come close to you?

1011
01:07:08,842 --> 01:07:13,905
No! No! No! l will never hit you, sir.

1012
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:16,547
Why? lf you hit two people
you give one free, is it?

1013
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:18,150
Who are you?

1014
01:07:19,419 --> 01:07:20,545
Why have you come to my house?

1015
01:07:21,555 --> 01:07:23,955
He won't utter a word
if you ask him like this.

1016
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:29,394
Make him drink this.
He will spit out all the truth.

1017
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:34,495
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Please. l don't drink. Let's not do this.

1018
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:37,331
l have given word to my dad.
That's why.

1019
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:39,937
lf you want, l will inform
master immediately and leave this town.

1020
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:42,233
Get out. But, you first drink this.

1021
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,436
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Drink this before you leave.

1022
01:07:44,611 --> 01:07:45,407
Brother!

1023
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:49,741
Please sir!

1024
01:07:51,384 --> 01:07:52,783
Please sir! Please!
- Drink it.

1025
01:07:57,057 --> 01:07:58,786
Now he will blurt out all truth.

1026
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:01,090
Yes! We made him drink.

1027
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:02,423
Phone!

1028
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,799
How dare you click pictures
of her and black mail with it?

1029
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:09,126
Ouch! Ouch!
- Hit him.

1030
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:13,897
Brother! They have got me drunk.

1031
01:08:13,974 --> 01:08:15,601
Uncle!
- Please! Help me.

1032
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:18,968
Despite differences,
we are still from the same family.

1033
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:21,274
He is a third person.

1034
01:08:21,715 --> 01:08:23,114
No! Don't take all this to your heart.

1035
01:08:23,216 --> 01:08:24,410
This one time...
- l am sorry.

1036
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:26,315
...please leave him. l'll take care.
- What are you saying?

1037
01:08:29,222 --> 01:08:30,120
No! No! No! No!

1038
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:34,617
What a shot! Hit him again.

1039
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,708
Don't brother!
l am part of your family too.

1040
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:54,606
Don't hit me.
- How can you be part of our family?

1041
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:18,599
Oops!

1042
01:09:36,489 --> 01:09:37,353
Who is this guy?

1043
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:00,541
What is he doing?

1044
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:09,717
Where is he going?

1045
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,323
He is no ordinary man, brother.

1046
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:47,722
lt is not safe for
us to stay here anymore.

1047
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,491
Come. Let's leave.

1048
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:01,733
Get up!

1049
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:05,702
Didn't l warn you not to fight with me?

1050
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:07,610
Did you see what happened?

1051
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,743
So Mr. Pillipeethri (Useless)

1052
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,611
Go home, eat good food and sleep.

1053
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:19,490
You!

1054
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:23,553
Where did he keep his bloody phone?

1055
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,926
Darling! What are you doing here?

1056
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,964
Have you come for this?
- Hey!

1057
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,433
Master!
- Shut up!

1058
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:44,245
Raise it. Raise your hands.

1059
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:47,216
A little more.

1060
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,590
This is yours.
This is what you are searching for.

1061
01:11:57,664 --> 01:11:58,926
How did this come to my pocket?

1062
01:12:10,844 --> 01:12:11,708
You stupid!

1063
01:12:12,212 --> 01:12:15,648
You complain about me to Bangari,
then make him hit me...

1064
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:17,407
...and you thought you can
delete all theses pics on my phone.

1065
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:20,008
Do you think l am a small
kid to not understand all this?

1066
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,681
You are no ordinary item.

1067
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:25,450
You are a bigger criminal
than Osama Bin Ladan.

1068
01:12:25,725 --> 01:12:26,657
Shit!
- Hey!

1069
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,225
Do you think you can leave that easily?

1070
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,999
Give me a hug and kiss.

1071
01:12:34,968 --> 01:12:36,526
No!
- Master!

1072
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:40,462
What is this? Hug me properly. Hold!

1073
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:44,173
A little more tight.

1074
01:12:45,345 --> 01:12:46,607
Come closer.

1075
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:51,077
Will you hug any one who asks you for it?

1076
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,779
You seem to be a bit notorious.

1077
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:56,948
l will kill you if you
try all this drama again.

1078
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:00,120
From this evening,
no matter when l ask...

1079
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:01,753
...where l ask...

1080
01:13:02,262 --> 01:13:05,356
...1..2..3..4..5.

1081
01:13:06,032 --> 01:13:07,795
You have to kiss me 5 times. Okay?

1082
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:09,763
Else, l will call for master immediately.

1083
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:13,469
One!

1084
01:13:14,574 --> 01:13:15,404
One!

1085
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,276
One!

1086
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:25,045
Yuck! Hey! Hey!

1087
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:05,614
''Why do you turn your rosy
eyes into thorns and prick my heart.''

1088
01:14:06,726 --> 01:14:12,392
''You look like a big sweet
dish and l am getting tempted.''

1089
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:16,692
''Oh my lovely witch!
With your honey coated lips...''

1090
01:14:16,769 --> 01:14:20,364
''...you do seduce me.''

1091
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:27,141
''Oh my dear witch!
You lock me in your navel fold.''

1092
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:35,450
''Oh damsel!
lntoxicate me with your french kiss!''

1093
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:40,785
''Oh my dear!''

1094
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:12,654
''Why do you always
keep figthing with me?''

1095
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,956
''Do you do all this to kiss me?''

1096
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:22,132
''Why do you have this air of arrogance?
Give me a small kiss.''

1097
01:15:22,235 --> 01:15:28,799
''Get rid of all your despise
for me by kissing me hard.''

1098
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:35,775
''Stop all this anger and take my lips.''

1099
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:40,009
''Oh my miser girl! My Godavari (River).''

1100
01:15:40,086 --> 01:15:46,821
''Kiss me and let the
love for you flow in my heart.''

1101
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:53,696
''Oh beautiful one!
Kiss me till you get rid of your anger.''

1102
01:16:24,297 --> 01:16:27,391
''Not even drinking
alcohol gets me this high.''

1103
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:30,966
''Just one look at you
can make me go happy high.''

1104
01:16:31,037 --> 01:16:34,438
''lf Shakespeare had
caught a glimpse of you.''

1105
01:16:34,607 --> 01:16:37,041
''l am sure he would have
become Devdas (lcon of love).''

1106
01:16:37,143 --> 01:16:41,102
'' Your french kiss...''

1107
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,671
''...can take me to a foreign land.''

1108
01:16:43,783 --> 01:16:47,844
''Just to bear your kisses...''

1109
01:16:47,954 --> 01:16:50,752
''...l am here as a native guy.''

1110
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:58,457
''Oh little atom bomb! You seem
to break my heart with your curves.''

1111
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:07,996
''You are a nuclear reactor
and make me drown in your kisses!''

1112
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:21,951
''Why do you turn your rosy
eyes into thorns and prick my heart.''

1113
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:28,389
''You look like a big sweet
dish and l am getting tempted.''

1114
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:36,129
''Oh my lovely witch! Don't seduce
me with your honey coated lips.''

1115
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:43,164
''Oh my dear witch!
You lock me in your navel fold.''

1116
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:51,206
''Oh damsel!
lntoxicate me with your french kiss!''

1117
01:17:51,317 --> 01:17:57,119
''Oh my dear!''

1118
01:18:03,563 --> 01:18:06,293
These days, a man preys
on another man for money. Yuck!

1119
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:09,060
We must ensure and help
others to have a happy life too.

1120
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:11,366
Hasn't Government fixed wage rates?

1121
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:15,865
Why do you refuse to give it?
Why do you try to make profits out of it?

1122
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:19,071
This shouldn't happen again.
Do you accept?

1123
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,309
Go!

1124
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:22,040
Go tell him about proposal from America.
- lf l utter America--

1125
01:18:22,148 --> 01:18:23,080
What are you discussing there,
son in law?

1126
01:18:23,182 --> 01:18:23,705
Father in law!

1127
01:18:23,816 --> 01:18:26,182
That is--
- We attended a wedding recently, right.

1128
01:18:26,252 --> 01:18:28,049
Yes!
- Someone has seen our Satya there.

1129
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:30,315
NRl! He is a famous doctor in America.

1130
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:32,721
His dad is doctor too.
He has asked if we are interested.

1131
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:33,792
Why do you hurry.

1132
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:34,883
We'll have to get Chitra married
before Satya.

1133
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:36,120
We have been trying to...

1134
01:18:36,195 --> 01:18:37,389
...to get Chitra married
for the last 4 years?

1135
01:18:37,496 --> 01:18:39,361
Will our Bangari let us do it?

1136
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:42,425
Son in law!
- Yes, Father in law.

1137
01:18:42,768 --> 01:18:45,100
Have we sent hings required
for 100 weddings taking place...

1138
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:46,001
...at community hall today?

1139
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:47,299
l have sent it long back.

1140
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:49,601
He plans to get Chitra married there--

1141
01:18:50,109 --> 01:18:53,101
Nope! l will never make a Rummy!

1142
01:18:53,346 --> 01:18:54,813
l will never get Chitra too.

1143
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:57,246
Life is a waste.

1144
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,076
Hello!
- Uncle!

1145
01:18:59,151 --> 01:18:59,913
What is it?

1146
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:02,352
Grand dad intends to get
Chitra married immediately.

1147
01:19:02,555 --> 01:19:03,522
Please come quickly.

1148
01:19:04,423 --> 01:19:07,221
Oh my! How dare he goes so far?

1149
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:08,523
Let me show, who l am!

1150
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:20,904
ls Chitra getting married?

1151
01:19:23,743 --> 01:19:26,906
Yes. Fearing Bangari's
interruption again...

1152
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:29,379
...Brother in law has quickly arranged
fro her wedding today.

1153
01:19:29,448 --> 01:19:31,109
lf he comes to know of this...Ouch!

1154
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,042
How dare you get married to someone else?

1155
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,744
Brother in law!

1156
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:37,721
Hey! Wait! Bangari, wait!
- Please listen to me.

1157
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:41,089
Bangari!
- Don't do this stupid thing.

1158
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,058
Please listen to us.
- Hey! Get on the bike.

1159
01:19:43,562 --> 01:19:44,824
Hey! Bangari!

1160
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:47,388
Hey Bangari!
- What? Kidnap?

1161
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,365
Sir!

1162
01:19:52,305 --> 01:19:53,431
Sir!

1163
01:19:54,807 --> 01:19:56,172
Sir!

1164
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,204
Please listen to me.

1165
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:14,919
Oh God! l have to strain this much
to get married to you. Sit here.

1166
01:20:15,261 --> 01:20:17,661
Oh! Please!
Please listen to me this one time.

1167
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,591
Shut up! Give me the Mangal Sutra.
(Sacred thread binding the wedding)

1168
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:28,200
Stop this nonsense!

1169
01:20:28,808 --> 01:20:30,639
Chitra!
- Why are you here?

1170
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,142
Sir! You are making a big mistake.

1171
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:33,369
lf you do this,
you will get in to a lot of trouble.

1172
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:34,838
Who are you to say all this to me?

1173
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,563
l have made a mistake. Please forgive me.

1174
01:20:56,702 --> 01:20:58,135
How dare you raise your hands to hit me?

1175
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:01,602
lt is a big mistake, sir.
l am very sorry.

1176
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:05,477
Please talk to your dad just once.
Everything will be fine.

1177
01:21:05,544 --> 01:21:09,878
Who are you to interfere
between my dad and me?

1178
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,007
Bangari Sir!

1179
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,776
What are you laughing at?

1180
01:21:19,759 --> 01:21:20,851
Give that to me.

1181
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:23,058
Give that to me.

1182
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:24,995
Give that Mangal Sutra to me.

1183
01:21:25,064 --> 01:21:28,124
Even if you hit and kick me more,
l will not let this wedding happen.

1184
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:31,363
Let me just tell you one thing.
- What are you going to say?

1185
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,698
After that, it is your choice.
- What is it?

1186
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,464
There's no problem, master.
- Stop it.

1187
01:21:41,347 --> 01:21:43,474
Hey! Give me that Mangal Sutra.
- Hey!

1188
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:44,640
Sir! Please sir!
- Give.

1189
01:21:47,586 --> 01:21:50,783
Police!
- Dad! Dad!

1190
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:54,456
He has abducted this bride,
during her wedding.

1191
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,928
He has raised hands on my daughter.

1192
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,588
Arrest him!

1193
01:21:58,697 --> 01:22:01,222
Brother in law!
Please be patient. Think it over.

1194
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,927
l have thought it through!

1195
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:05,132
lt is only because of that l let him
stay in town despite his mistakes.

1196
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,034
Had l got him arrested the same day,
we wouldn't have faced this today.

1197
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:13,375
Book him under all cases!

1198
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:15,812
Case eh? Why?

1199
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:17,948
She loves me.

1200
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:20,578
lf you get her married to someone else,
she won't live.

1201
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,319
She will definitely die.

1202
01:22:22,755 --> 01:22:24,222
That's why l abducted her.

1203
01:22:25,491 --> 01:22:29,393
Shit! l don't understand
your grudge against your own sons.

1204
01:22:29,795 --> 01:22:32,923
You treat others well. However,
you fail to do the same with your son.

1205
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:35,756
Hey! See what l do to you!
You are responsible for all this.

1206
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:36,926
Take him away.

1207
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,697
Hey! You have come from somewhere...

1208
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,605
...and have caused a lot
of trouble to both of us.

1209
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:49,843
You may have stopped the wedding now.
Once l get back from jail...

1210
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:52,247
...l will kill you.

1211
01:22:53,919 --> 01:22:56,547
l will definitely kill you.
- Take him away.

1212
01:22:58,657 --> 01:22:59,681
Chitra!

1213
01:23:06,966 --> 01:23:07,762
Uncle!

1214
01:23:13,272 --> 01:23:15,536
Dad! Dad!

1215
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:39,595
l am getting back to my village.
- Stop behaving like a child, master.

1216
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:43,123
Grand dad, Wait! Come back.
- Let me go!

1217
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:45,135
Stop it! What is all this?

1218
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,369
They have prescribed for lnjections.
l don't want them.

1219
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,668
Just one. lt won't pain much.
- Come! Come!

1220
01:23:50,743 --> 01:23:51,767
lt is just a small one.

1221
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:53,734
That's all. lt's over.

1222
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:55,575
Finished, master.
- Grand dad, you have--

1223
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,748
Grand dad!

1224
01:23:57,082 --> 01:23:59,482
Are we done with it?
- lt will be done, soon.

1225
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:00,678
Master! Please wait.
- lt will be done now.

1226
01:24:00,753 --> 01:24:01,913
lt's over.
- My God!

1227
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:03,312
Hey!
- What is it?

1228
01:24:03,389 --> 01:24:04,720
Hey!
- That girl is here.

1229
01:24:04,823 --> 01:24:05,755
Master! She is here to fix this.

1230
01:24:06,025 --> 01:24:07,720
You do it instead of her.
- How can l--

1231
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,727
How can we fix this then?
- Sister, please leave. l'll take care.

1232
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:12,394
l am feeling shy.
- That's fine.

1233
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:25,209
Uncle! Why did you get us all tensed?
l have seen the reports.

1234
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:27,006
You are absolutely fine. You are
sure to be strong for next 10 years.

1235
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:29,441
You will hit century!
l will guarantee for it.

1236
01:24:29,548 --> 01:24:32,415
Yes! Didn't l tell all of you?
These people created all this fuss.

1237
01:24:33,018 --> 01:24:35,043
Baby! l am will get 10 years
for all your fasting (Religious).

1238
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:36,553
An additional 10 years
for all your prayers.

1239
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,384
l will get additional 5 years
of Chitra's marriage and hospital work.

1240
01:24:38,457 --> 01:24:39,890
He has given assurance
for all these years.

1241
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,050
Am l right Noka Raju?

1242
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,528
Everyone here call me N. Raju.

1243
01:24:43,629 --> 01:24:45,426
Does she call you like that?
- Yes.

1244
01:24:45,464 --> 01:24:48,490
He was born after his mother
prayed to name him after Goddess Noka.

1245
01:24:48,601 --> 01:24:50,466
N. Raju it seems.
What is wrong with Noka Raju?

1246
01:24:50,603 --> 01:24:51,695
You may go to the ward.

1247
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:56,439
Hey Noka Raju! Your hospital looks great.

1248
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:58,334
Why don't you start something
like this in our village?

1249
01:24:58,577 --> 01:25:01,569
Hey! Building is available.
l will bear the expenses for set up.

1250
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:02,810
Will you do it?

1251
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:03,973
Who will set up
a hospital in that village--

1252
01:25:04,617 --> 01:25:07,085
l have to manage 3 hospitals already.
- ln that village...

1253
01:25:07,386 --> 01:25:08,182
...l am sure you can't earn
as you do here.

1254
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:09,311
l didn't mean it that way, uncle.

1255
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,492
Doctor N. Raju!

1256
01:25:18,897 --> 01:25:23,357
Master! You want to set up a hospital
in our village. That's it, right?

1257
01:25:24,637 --> 01:25:25,831
How is it possible?

1258
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:33,077
Master! Didn't l tell you that
my dad is a famous doctor in London?

1259
01:25:33,412 --> 01:25:37,906
Every year, his medical team arranges
for free medical camps in poor countries.

1260
01:25:37,983 --> 01:25:39,382
We can call them here this time.

1261
01:25:39,585 --> 01:25:42,418
They will come here
with the best equipments.

1262
01:25:42,788 --> 01:25:44,483
They also have support
from World Health Organisation.

1263
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:48,226
lf you agree, l will talk
to my dad and arrange for this.

1264
01:25:48,527 --> 01:25:50,688
Are you serious?
- Yes, master.

1265
01:25:51,597 --> 01:25:53,394
Son in law! Let's go to the hospital now.

1266
01:26:02,341 --> 01:26:03,740
Son in law!
- Yes, Father in law.

1267
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,074
Please renovate this
building as per how he wants.

1268
01:26:06,145 --> 01:26:07,077
Okay.

1269
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:10,277
ls that okay?
- Yes! Yes!

1270
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,380
Where did l leave my phone?

1271
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:22,393
Oh God!

1272
01:26:22,628 --> 01:26:23,754
Where are you going?
- Hey!

1273
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:25,861
Why are you in such a hurry?

1274
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:32,731
Have you lost something
or you worried about this?

1275
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:34,596
Give my phone back.

1276
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,739
l will return it, if you hug me now.
- Get lost!

1277
01:26:38,177 --> 01:26:40,145
Give it to me!
- Okay.

1278
01:26:40,646 --> 01:26:42,341
Give me a kiss. l'll return your phone.
- Sigh!

1279
01:26:42,715 --> 01:26:43,909
Didn't you ask me for it?

1280
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:46,714
Are you going to kiss me or not?

1281
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:50,116
lf you are going to look at me like this,
l might fall for you.

1282
01:26:50,222 --> 01:26:51,780
You must have gone mad.
Give me my phone.

1283
01:26:54,193 --> 01:26:56,593
l dare you to take it from here.
- Confirmed mental case!

1284
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,731
Aren't you Chandrasekhar uncle's son?

1285
01:27:05,604 --> 01:27:08,198
lf Grand dad knows about this
he wouldn't let you stay here.

1286
01:27:08,273 --> 01:27:09,672
This is why you lied to him, right?

1287
01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:11,574
Yes!

1288
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,874
What will happen if
Grand dad gets to know this?

1289
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:19,173
l will kill you.
- Let's see. Grand dad!

1290
01:27:46,278 --> 01:27:53,946
''Oh Prince! l am royally yours.''

1291
01:27:54,286 --> 01:28:01,556
''Let the garland reach
my neck like honey.''

1292
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,494
''The air that you breathe.''

1293
01:28:05,597 --> 01:28:09,397
''l desire to be like that with you.''

1294
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:17,431
''l am sending my soul towards you.''

1295
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:26,012
''Oh Prince! l am royally yours.''

1296
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:34,420
''Let the garland reach
my neck like honey.''

1297
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:05,746
''l love thinking about you,
while l am all alone.''

1298
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:14,030
''l like every minute
that l spend with you.''

1299
01:29:14,233 --> 01:29:21,696
''l wish to open my eyes only
after all my dreams come true.''

1300
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:33,243
''l wish to forget everything
around me and dream about you all day.''

1301
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:42,217
''Oh Prince! l am royally yours.''

1302
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:50,201
''Let the garland reach
my neck like honey.''

1303
01:30:26,305 --> 01:30:34,110
''l feel burdened with my shyness
and wish to lose it in your hands.''

1304
01:30:34,313 --> 01:30:42,220
''Show me that leading
life with you is wonderful.''

1305
01:30:42,387 --> 01:30:49,884
''l wish to share my
heart and feeling for you.''

1306
01:30:50,362 --> 01:31:01,432
''l have no other wish
other than uniting with you.''

1307
01:31:40,846 --> 01:31:43,474
Heart attack eh?
- He didn't have heart attack.

1308
01:31:43,548 --> 01:31:45,175
His BP shot up when he got real excited.

1309
01:31:45,484 --> 01:31:47,349
l have got him to do all tests.
He is doing superb.

1310
01:31:47,619 --> 01:31:48,551
Thank God!

1311
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:51,053
But dad, Grand dad has not given up
his hope of setting up the hospital.

1312
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:53,187
This village definitely needs a hospital.

1313
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,026
l have given word to help
him in setting up a hospital.

1314
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:59,022
You will have to help me.
- Correct, dear. Good idea.

1315
01:31:59,664 --> 01:32:00,926
You are great, my son.

1316
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:04,658
l will arrange for equipments,
doctors and all that is necessary.

1317
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:08,564
No worries. l hope my dad forgives me,
at least after this.

1318
01:32:09,207 --> 01:32:10,174
Let's hope.

1319
01:32:11,877 --> 01:32:15,040
Love you, dad.
Please send the equipments.

1320
01:32:15,147 --> 01:32:19,049
After that, you and your team
can visit here. Grand dad will be happy.

1321
01:32:19,885 --> 01:32:23,184
Come on, Mr. Chandrasekhar.
Be strong, my boy. Bye.

1322
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:24,547
Grand dad might look for me.

1323
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,316
Yes!

1324
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,118
l am done with arranging
for hospital set up.

1325
01:32:28,927 --> 01:32:30,292
Let me go and get uncle on bail.

1326
01:32:43,575 --> 01:32:47,136
Hey! Why doesn't grand
dad let uncle stay here?

1327
01:32:48,246 --> 01:32:51,113
Since l got back from hostel,
Bangari uncle has been staying outside.

1328
01:32:51,283 --> 01:32:54,343
When l ask my mom,
she says l too young to know about it.

1329
01:32:54,753 --> 01:32:56,618
That's why.
l haven't asked anyone since then.

1330
01:32:57,055 --> 01:32:58,750
What would have happened, then?

1331
01:32:59,925 --> 01:33:04,259
l understood that there is
some problem between uncle and Chitra.

1332
01:33:07,299 --> 01:33:10,268
Who can we go ask to know about all this?

1333
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,131
Ouch!

1334
01:33:11,236 --> 01:33:12,134
Hi Chitra!

1335
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,101
l came here to apologise to you.
- What for?

1336
01:33:17,476 --> 01:33:20,912
l am kind of responsible
for your wedding to be called off.

1337
01:33:21,046 --> 01:33:23,412
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- lt's not you.

1338
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:25,115
My wedding has been called off
a number of times before.

1339
01:33:25,217 --> 01:33:25,876
Why so?

1340
01:33:25,951 --> 01:33:29,717
Once it was called off in the house.
Next time it was called off at the gate.

1341
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:31,345
Third time,
it has been called off at the temple.

1342
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:33,324
There is some problem with my horscope.

1343
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,653
l will never get married.
- Chitra!

1344
01:33:35,727 --> 01:33:38,321
There is no problem with your horoscope.
Bangari is your problem.

1345
01:33:38,463 --> 01:33:40,226
Please don't blame my Bangari.

1346
01:33:40,999 --> 01:33:42,660
Bangari likes me a lot.

1347
01:33:42,968 --> 01:33:48,372
l have high respects for
my Uncle who has raised me.

1348
01:33:49,007 --> 01:33:51,669
Uncle is very upset and angry
with Bangari's drinking habit.

1349
01:33:52,477 --> 01:33:54,968
On top of all this,
l have horoscope issues.

1350
01:33:55,313 --> 01:33:57,679
How will l be able to get married?

1351
01:33:57,782 --> 01:34:01,946
Despite all this, Bangari did
seek uncle's permission to marry me.

1352
01:34:02,287 --> 01:34:05,279
That's when all this fighting started.
- Fighting eh?

1353
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:10,885
Listen to me!
l wish to get married to Chitra.

1354
01:34:11,997 --> 01:34:15,057
l won't fight with you.
l will do as you say.

1355
01:34:15,433 --> 01:34:18,630
lf you want,
l will also offer prayers like this.

1356
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:21,697
He has started drinking again.

1357
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:26,106
This is how l believed my friend
and got my sister married to a drunkard.

1358
01:34:26,444 --> 01:34:29,607
He kept drinking and tortured my sister.
Finally, he orphaned this girl.

1359
01:34:29,814 --> 01:34:32,282
l will not repeat the same
mistake and ruin her life too.

1360
01:34:33,118 --> 01:34:36,645
As it is, l have been magnanimous

Get out!

1362
01:34:44,996 --> 01:34:50,024
Dear! Why have you locked the doors?

1363
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:51,799
Do you know what does rape mean?

1364
01:34:52,137 --> 01:34:54,867
Tomorrow (ln telugu- Rape) is Saturday.

1365
01:34:57,209 --> 01:35:00,440
l didn't mean that. Do you
remember the movie ''Rowdygaru Pellam''?

1366
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:04,609
Do you remember what actor Mohan
Babu does to Shobna to get married?

1367
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:07,413
Oh God! Did you mean that kind of rape?
- Yes. l did.

1368
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:09,276

...they will definitely get us married.

1370
01:35:11,089 --> 01:35:12,249
No need, dear! This is wrong.

1371

Trust me. l will rape you now...

1372
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,891
...and will marry you later.

1373
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:18,827
No need, dear.
No matter how difficult it is...

1374
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:20,659
...let us get uncle's
to consent for our wedding.

1375
01:35:20,765 --> 01:35:22,096
He will never accept to it.

1376
01:35:24,269 --> 01:35:26,794
See! Do you love me?

1377
01:35:28,206 --> 01:35:29,571
ln that case, we'll do this.

1378
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:32,038
We can get married tomorrow.
Please cooperate.

1379
01:35:32,577 --> 01:35:34,511
Please listen to me.
- lt is very simple.

1380
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:36,570
You stay calm for sometime.
l will take care of the rest.

1381
01:35:36,781 --> 01:35:38,305
Dear! Please!
- Just this once.

1382
01:35:38,383 --> 01:35:39,509
Just this one time.

1383
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:40,718
Please let me go.

1384
01:35:41,386 --> 01:35:43,251
Dear!
- Please listen to me.

Please get me married to Chitra.
She likes me too.

Yes! Throw me out.
This is nothing new to you. Throw me out.

1388
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,374
Earlier, you sent my brother out.
Now, you have sent me out.

1389
01:36:09,781 --> 01:36:14,343
Send everyone out. You can
lead a happy and peaceful life then.

1390
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,481
What are you guys looking at?

1391
01:36:18,657 --> 01:36:20,318
Don't you have any other work to do.
- Hey Bangari!

1392
01:36:20,392 --> 01:36:23,828
Hey Bangari! Stop it. What are you doing?

1393
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:26,027
l will get you married to Chitra.

1394
01:36:26,231 --> 01:36:28,222
Come. Let's go to my house.
- Your house?

1395
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:31,029
Do you have alcohol at your place?
- Why do you think l have that big house?

1396
01:36:31,169 --> 01:36:32,193
Come.
- l want to drink.

1397
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,842
Oh God! l have told you everything.

1398
01:36:39,077 --> 01:36:40,442
Please don't tell anyone about this.

1399
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:43,572
lt's okay. You have told
all this to the right person.

1400
01:36:43,782 --> 01:36:44,578
What do you mean?

1401
01:36:44,649 --> 01:36:46,310
Do you know who he is?
- Who?

1402
01:36:46,785 --> 01:36:49,049
He is Dr. Chandrasekhar uncle's son.

1403
01:36:49,454 --> 01:36:51,547
Oh God! ls he our uncle's son?

1404
01:36:51,623 --> 01:36:53,454
Hey! Shut up!
- ls he our uncle's son?

1405
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:54,956
l heard he is in America.

1406
01:36:55,593 --> 01:36:57,060
Can't he get ticket and fly to lndia?

1407
01:36:58,596 --> 01:36:59,528
What is it?

1408
01:37:00,265 --> 01:37:01,926
Rape!

1409
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:04,160
Rape!

01:37:05,503 --> 01:37:06,492
Rape eh?

1411
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:14,409
Why did you try rape?

1412
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,908
As discussed,
l have sent all the equipments.

1413
01:37:18,983 --> 01:37:21,975
Someone called Bunny.
- Bunny! Bunny!

1414
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,782
Yes!
- Has taken delivery of it.

1415
01:37:24,055 --> 01:37:27,115
Go and tell your uncle.
- What should l tell him?

1416
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,691
Does he know who you are.
- ls it brother on call?

1417
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:30,555
Brother!
- Have you told him?

1418
01:37:30,628 --> 01:37:33,620
l will tell him, dad.
- This is an important issue.

1419
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:37,091
You will find it difficult to
handle it all alone. Take uncle's help.

1420
01:37:37,502 --> 01:37:38,560
Hi!
- Ouch!

1421
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:40,831
Ask him to talk to me.

1422
01:37:41,206 --> 01:37:43,071
Yeah! Yeah! Okay. Bye.

1423
01:37:45,977 --> 01:37:47,535
They have arrested
him for abducting Chitra.

1424
01:37:49,547 --> 01:37:51,742
He is in Police Station, dad.
How do l tell you all this?

1425
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:55,977
Police Station!

1426
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:01,291
Bangari! He was released
long back on bail.

1427
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:02,991
Bail eh? l am sorry.

1428
01:38:03,261 --> 01:38:06,719
Who had applied for his bail?
- Why did he get you arrested?

1429
01:38:07,031 --> 01:38:08,293
What is his problem?

1430
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,858
l was ready to offer him
Rs. 2000 crores. He didn't accept.

1431
01:38:12,404 --> 01:38:15,840
He is calling you useless.
ln turn, you get upset.

1432
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:21,002
Who is that boy?
What is he transporting in lorry?

1433
01:38:21,212 --> 01:38:22,179
Do you know anything about it?

1434
01:38:23,548 --> 01:38:25,516
What is the connection
between him and the hospital?

1435
01:38:25,784 --> 01:38:27,342
What is happening in your house?

1436
01:38:27,886 --> 01:38:29,649
There are young girls in your house.

1437
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:35,656
lf you don't take action immediately,
he may engage in rape or such kind.

1438
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,798
lf we continue to ignore
this and shut our eyes...

1439
01:38:43,802 --> 01:38:44,996
...things will go out of control.

1440
01:38:56,114 --> 01:38:58,514
Oh God! You have turned
the son against his father.

1441
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,746
We have just used...

1442
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:04,446
...what was already existing.
We have just kindled his hatred.

1443
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,650
He will do the rest.

1444
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,658
Brother!
Your dad has sent all the equipments.

1445
01:39:11,763 --> 01:39:12,695
Who is this Bangari?

1446
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,890
He beat me up and has taken
all equipments along with him.

1447
01:39:16,134 --> 01:39:18,932
Where to?
- l don't know, brother!

1448
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:22,267
There are big fans here.
Yet, there is no air circulation.

1449
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,971
Who is he, brother?

1450
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:26,101
Uncle!

1451
01:39:42,494 --> 01:39:45,930
He is here.
Let us hit him down. Keep going.

1452
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:53,694
Sir! What are you doing?

1453
01:40:10,288 --> 01:40:11,755
Keep going! Hit him.

1454
01:40:13,791 --> 01:40:15,418
Go! Go! Hit him.

1455
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:18,225
Speeden up! Hit him.

1456
01:40:26,137 --> 01:40:30,233
Sir! Please stop the vehicle.
Sir! Turn the vehicle to left.

1457
01:40:51,729 --> 01:40:53,026
Ouch!

1458
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:02,802
Sir! Please listen to me.

1459
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,409
Sir! Please listen to me.
They are very expensive.

1460
01:41:10,715 --> 01:41:14,048
Sir! Please sir! Please!
- How dare you?

1461
01:41:22,794 --> 01:41:27,231
Stop him! Don't let him go.

1462
01:41:27,532 --> 01:41:29,432
Come on!

1463
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,694
Sir!

1464
01:41:44,449 --> 01:41:47,577
l spared you, just because
you happen to be my uncle. Else--

1465
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:50,084
Uncle eh? How am l your uncle?

1466
01:41:50,154 --> 01:41:53,555
Yes. l am your Elder brother's son.

1467
01:41:54,058 --> 01:41:55,719
Dr. Chandrasekhar's son.

1468
01:41:57,261 --> 01:42:01,664
Dad has sent all these equipments
to re open our hospital.

1469
01:43:20,311 --> 01:43:22,074
Sir wants soda immediately.

1470
01:43:22,814 --> 01:43:24,304
Hey! Bring it soon.

1471
01:43:25,983 --> 01:43:28,451
Sir! That guy is here.
- Beer factory--

1472
01:43:28,686 --> 01:43:29,778
Which boy?

1473
01:43:29,854 --> 01:43:32,186
That boy who beat your son
in cock fight.

1474
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:33,951
He has hit our boy
two at two other occasions.

1475
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,649
That London boy!
- Ouch!

1476
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,320
lf our boy hits someone,
you can boast about it like this.

1477
01:43:38,596 --> 01:43:41,429
You should never talk about
someone else hitting our boy.

1478
01:43:41,499 --> 01:43:44,332
You should never do negative publicity.
- l swear on my mother, brother.

1479
01:43:47,839 --> 01:43:50,967
Where is he? Where? Where is he?

1480
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,576
Where is he?

1481
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:55,305
Why did you scare us all? Useless fellow!

1482
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:59,944
He has got drunk at this early hour.

1483
01:44:03,254 --> 01:44:04,414
He is here.

1484
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:06,622
Who is it?

1485
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:08,323
Greetings, grand dad.

1486
01:44:14,932 --> 01:44:17,423
Grand dad! l am not sure as
to how much of bad things you have done.

1487
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,799
May be that's why God has paralysed you.

1488
01:44:20,104 --> 01:44:21,799
Why do you still engage
in such activities?

1489
01:44:22,774 --> 01:44:27,905
My master is reopening the hospital
in order to do good for the natives.

1490
01:44:28,146 --> 01:44:31,047
lf you can help him.
Else, stay calm and quiet.

1491
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:33,373
Don't try to act smart.

1492
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:37,279
Losing someone from
either of our family...

1493
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,180
...will not look good. l came here
to inform you of it, Grand dad.

1494
01:44:41,259 --> 01:44:42,021
Hey!

1495
01:44:42,226 --> 01:44:45,024
How can a foreign boy like
you give out statements like that?

1496
01:44:45,863 --> 01:44:49,196
l am not giving you any statements.
l will get into direct action.

1497
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:52,166
l'll take your leave.
- Mr. Pillikar Babu!

1498
01:44:52,403 --> 01:44:54,462
Actually, what l want to tell you is--

1499
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:57,099
Didn't my grand dad ask you to talk
in Telugu the other day?

1500
01:44:57,175 --> 01:44:57,937
Yes.

1501
01:44:58,009 --> 01:45:00,136
Why do you again do this then?
- Pillikar Babu!

1502
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:03,647
Your grand dad's second son
is faithful like a dog to this house.

1503
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:06,179
lf l offer biscuits to dog,
it will do as l say.

1504
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,218
So you give biscuits to get it done.

1505
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:09,512
Bangari Uncle!

1506
01:45:15,026 --> 01:45:18,723
Uncle! You may escape
from a gun's bullet.

1507
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:21,230
You can even escape from a bomb blast.

1508
01:45:21,332 --> 01:45:24,631
He is a missile!
You can never escape from him.

1509
01:45:24,702 --> 01:45:27,830
Uncle! We don't need such dialogues.
Come with me.

1510
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,007
Yes!
- l didn't call you. He did.

1511
01:45:31,108 --> 01:45:35,135
You are being too over confident.
You may lose.

1512
01:45:35,213 --> 01:45:36,874
Uncle!

1513
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:49,551
Dad!
- Didn't l warn you?

1514
01:45:49,794 --> 01:45:52,558
No statements. Only action.

1515
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,120
This is--
- Uncle!

1516
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:55,563
lt is our time now.

1517
01:45:55,633 --> 01:45:57,601
Only action. Come along.

1518
01:45:58,402 --> 01:46:01,894
Hey! Stop him.
- Why should we stop him?

1519
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,630
He is like a God to us!

1520
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:05,475
Shut up!
- Sir!

1521
01:46:05,509 --> 01:46:09,275
We have spent lakhs of rupees
to make you get up from the Chair.

1522
01:46:09,847 --> 01:46:13,112
While he did the same in few seconds.
He is our God!

1523
01:46:13,184 --> 01:46:14,947
Shut up!
- Hey!

1524
01:46:16,153 --> 01:46:19,088
We have seen people coming
to our place in need of something.

1525
01:46:19,757 --> 01:46:22,089
People have come asking for jobs too.

1526
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:26,988
There were few others who came
to ask for money. First time, a person...

1527
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:28,898
...has come to warn us.

1528
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:31,901
l thought my brother in law
will die in heart attack.

1529
01:46:32,203 --> 01:46:33,727
Who is he?

1530
01:46:34,438 --> 01:46:37,168
This guy has become just like him.

1531
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:42,602
No point waiting. Time has come.

1532
01:46:44,849 --> 01:46:48,410
We'll have to finish
them at the opportune moment.

1533
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:51,921
Please be careful. Slowly.

1534
01:46:53,024 --> 01:46:56,460
Keep it here.
- Carefully!

1535
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:59,630
Dear! Grand dad wants
you home immediately.

1536
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,025
What for?
- You sister has come down from London.

1537
01:47:02,266 --> 01:47:03,494
Has my sister come?
- Sister eh?

1538
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:05,569
Come. Lets go.
- What are you saying?

1539
01:47:06,037 --> 01:47:09,097
She doesn't know about this drama.
l am sure she must have told him.

1540
01:47:09,907 --> 01:47:11,499
By now, Grand dad would
have got to know everything.

1541
01:47:11,575 --> 01:47:12,837
How do we know if she told him or not?

1542
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,571
l know her very well.

1543
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,335
She must have told him definitely.

1544
01:47:16,881 --> 01:47:19,907
Everything is over.
Please go bring her here.

1545
01:47:20,718 --> 01:47:21,980
We will go back.
- Hey!

1546
01:47:22,219 --> 01:47:23,914
l am there. l will take care of it.

1547
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:25,750
Come with me.
- Uncle!

1548
01:47:26,157 --> 01:47:27,647
l feel really tensed.

1549
01:47:28,392 --> 01:47:29,381
Hey! Come along, man!

1550
01:47:34,932 --> 01:47:36,092
Your brother has come!

1551
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:56,379
Abhi!
- Wait!

1552
01:47:58,255 --> 01:47:59,381
Oh God!

1553
01:48:06,063 --> 01:48:08,657
Hey! Do you think
l don't know about it?

1554
01:48:13,137 --> 01:48:15,765
Master! l wanted--

1555
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,171
Didn't l tell you
that he will get scared?

1556
01:48:17,775 --> 01:48:18,799
Am l Hitler?

1557
01:48:18,943 --> 01:48:20,570
Do we have a world war between us?

1558
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:22,969
Couldn't you tell us
about your sister's coming?

1559
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:24,477
We could have sent vehicle
for her pick up.

1560
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:25,310
Come, dear.
- Master!

1561
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:27,577
She is very beautiful!
- l didn't have any idea too.

1562
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:31,645
Take her inside.

1563
01:48:31,956 --> 01:48:34,049
Hey! Am l a Hitler? Hitler eh?

1564
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:35,615
This is such a huge house.

1565
01:48:35,726 --> 01:48:37,751
l got real scared,
that you might blurt out the truth.

1566
01:48:37,862 --> 01:48:38,954
Why would l tell?

1567
01:48:39,397 --> 01:48:40,295
Don't l know?

1568
01:48:40,398 --> 01:48:42,161
Why did you come unannounced?
Who invited you here?

1569
01:48:43,167 --> 01:48:45,431
l also wanted to spend
time with grand parents.

1570
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:48,671
Pig!
- lf l ask you, you won't let me come.

1571
01:48:48,839 --> 01:48:49,567
Get lost!

1572
01:48:50,508 --> 01:48:51,839
Oh! Are you the one marrying my brother?

1573
01:48:53,177 --> 01:48:54,144
All are here. Quiet.

1574
01:48:55,379 --> 01:48:58,974
Okay. Tell me.
Does you brother have friends there?

1575
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:01,382
Girl friends eh?
- Generally.

1576
01:49:01,552 --> 01:49:02,849
Who does he hang out with?

1577
01:49:05,623 --> 01:49:08,091
Okay. Fine. Does he have girlfriends?

1578
01:49:08,926 --> 01:49:10,086
Yes, girlfriends--
- Baby!

1579
01:49:14,065 --> 01:49:15,532
Greetings, ma'am!
- Greetings! Please come.

1580
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,658
Our Shanthi has come of age.
lt is her puberty function.

1581
01:49:17,735 --> 01:49:20,829
You must come without fail.
lf you both bless her...

1582
01:49:21,005 --> 01:49:22,597
...she will have a good life.

1583
01:49:22,706 --> 01:49:24,298
Has Shanthi become that big girl?

1584
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:27,572
Girls grow very fast.
- All of you must definitely come.

1585
01:49:28,045 --> 01:49:29,808
Puberty function?

1586
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:33,478
Do all of you want
Bangari uncle to come home?

1587
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:35,414
Yes.
- Okay. Then you must do as l say.

1588
01:49:35,786 --> 01:49:37,515
What do we have to do?
- What is it, dear?

1589
01:49:37,721 --> 01:49:41,350
Grand dad! The ones who
came to invite us for function...

1590
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:44,017
Yes!
- Shanthi is my class mate.

1591
01:49:44,195 --> 01:49:46,322
l also want such function in our house.

1592
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:48,955
But ma'am told me that,
it will never happen in this house.

1593
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,732
l also want such function here,
grand dad.

1594
01:49:51,802 --> 01:49:53,770
Hey! Shut up!
You always want something or the other.

1595
01:49:54,138 --> 01:49:55,730
lt is not possible here.
Didn't l tell you?

1596
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,706
You keep quiet.
Why are you screaming at her?

1597
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:02,037
As it is, it is the first
auspicious event in a woman's life.

1598
01:50:02,913 --> 01:50:04,403
However, it won't happen in our house.

1599
01:50:05,116 --> 01:50:07,016
Why do you scream at her,
instead of explaining this to her?

1600
01:50:08,252 --> 01:50:09,378
No matter how much you cry...

1601
01:50:09,453 --> 01:50:11,216
...girls at our house aren't lucky
enough to have this function.

1602
01:50:11,789 --> 01:50:14,349
Why not? We did have it for Satya, right!

1603
01:50:14,425 --> 01:50:16,017
l have seen the album!

1604
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,358
Back then,
Bangari uncle used to be at home.

1605
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,521
Oh! That's all, is it?
We can invite Bangari uncle home.

1606
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:25,463
Hey Abhi!
- What?

1607
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,701
Father in law,
does not like Bangari coming home. What?

1608
01:50:27,972 --> 01:50:29,371
Bangari can't come here.

1609
01:50:29,473 --> 01:50:31,532
You are going to say master
will disapprove it.

1610
01:50:32,143 --> 01:50:34,475
Why will he say no, if it is
going to make this little girl happy?

1611
01:50:34,645 --> 01:50:36,875
We are not going to ask
Bangari uncle to stay back here.

1612
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:39,415
He will come here participate
in the rituals, bless her and leave.

1613
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:42,580
We have nothing to win or lose in this.

1614
01:50:42,786 --> 01:50:43,753
Ain't it, master?

1615
01:50:44,989 --> 01:50:46,820
Why do you argue over something
that is not going to happen?

1616
01:50:47,424 --> 01:50:48,220
You come, dear!

1617
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:51,455
Do you mean to say that there
will be no function because of master?

1618
01:50:51,629 --> 01:50:53,824
Oh God! When did l say that?
- Okay.

1619
01:50:54,498 --> 01:50:57,296
Let him come and do it.
- How will he come?

1620
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,598
l meant to say that Bangari
uncle is little fussy about all this.

1621
01:51:01,105 --> 01:51:03,573
He won't come without you inviting him.
l am sure you know this.

1622
01:51:08,979 --> 01:51:12,608
Come.
- Wow! Super, ma'am!

1623
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:14,076
Account for this too.

1624
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,488
How much have we made today?
- Around Rs. 50 Lakhs.

1625
01:51:18,989 --> 01:51:20,820
Wow! We have made so much.

1626
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:23,988
We will be able to
earn much more in this.

1627
01:51:29,233 --> 01:51:30,894
Master! Please wait!

1628
01:51:30,968 --> 01:51:33,459
Don't stop me. Did you see?
He insults me with that money.

1629
01:51:33,571 --> 01:51:35,801
Come. Let's leave.
- We haven't come to pacify him.

1630
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:39,009
We are doing this to make few people
happy. Shravani, Grand mom.. Think.

1631
01:51:39,343 --> 01:51:42,210
Won't they feel bad if we don't do this?
- Okay. You go and talk to him.

1632
01:51:45,082 --> 01:51:46,413
Okay. Master!

1633
01:51:47,051 --> 01:51:48,382
Give me that towel.

1634
01:51:49,019 --> 01:51:52,011
Won't you give it to your student?
Give it to me.

1635
01:51:53,157 --> 01:51:55,625
Oh! Wow!

1636
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:00,288
Give me your hand.

1637
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,192
Hey Bangari!
- How dare you call me Bangari?

1638
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:06,462
l am talking on behalf of Balraju sir!

1639
01:52:07,938 --> 01:52:09,303
Tell me, Balraju sir.

1640
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,904
We are hosting a puberty
function for your niece, Shravani.

1641
01:52:12,376 --> 01:52:14,674
lt is customary for
uncle to be present there.

1642
01:52:15,045 --> 01:52:18,879
Come along! Don't misuse
this invitation and try to act smart.

1643
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:21,549
You shouldn't see or talk to Chitra.

1644
01:52:21,885 --> 01:52:24,820
Once you are done with rituals
and blessing, you must leave immediately.

1645
01:52:24,989 --> 01:52:29,016
lt has to be this simple.
- Aren't you going to serve lunch?

1646
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:30,525
What?
- Master!

1647
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:37,167
Okay. Once you are done with
the rituals and blessing, you can eat.

1648
01:52:37,268 --> 01:52:39,759
You must leave immediately after that.
Do you agree?

1649
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:42,067
Hey dude!
lt is my niece's puberty function.

1650
01:52:42,139 --> 01:52:43,504
They are serving lunch too.
You go on my behalf.

1651
01:52:43,607 --> 01:52:44,164
Sir!

1652
01:52:44,275 --> 01:52:46,072
He will come.
- This wasn't part of our plan.

1653
01:52:46,277 --> 01:52:48,905
lf you are inviting on his behalf...

1654
01:52:48,979 --> 01:52:50,310
...l will send him on my
behalf to attend the function.

1655
01:52:50,414 --> 01:52:52,279
Your mother wants you there.

1656
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:54,975
She wants you to do your
role as Shravani's uncle.

1657
01:52:55,919 --> 01:52:57,250
She has been praying for this.

1658
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:04,118
Bike!

1659
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:13,692
Grand mom,
mom, aunt, Shravani and Chitra.

1660
01:53:14,672 --> 01:53:17,971
All are real happy.

1661
01:53:19,576 --> 01:53:23,342
When will you make me happy?

1662
01:53:24,114 --> 01:53:25,911
lf you are ready,
we'll get started immediately.

1663
01:53:25,983 --> 01:53:26,711
Sigh!

1664
01:53:27,451 --> 01:53:28,543
This is the right time.

1665
01:53:28,886 --> 01:53:30,649
Can't you talk about our wedding too?

1666
01:53:31,121 --> 01:53:34,113
lf Grand dad gets to know
about this he will kill me.

1667
01:53:34,792 --> 01:53:35,622
Oh!

1668
01:53:35,959 --> 01:53:38,359
You stupid, l will definitely tell him.

1669
01:53:39,897 --> 01:53:43,230
lf you are brave enough,
tell grand dad that you wish to marry me.

1670
01:53:43,834 --> 01:53:45,859
l will accept then,
that you are a real hero.

1671
01:53:46,036 --> 01:53:50,370
ls that so? Get lost.
- l am ready to do what you ask for.

1672
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:53,876
Bumper offer!

1673
01:53:58,048 --> 01:53:59,447
My God!

1674
01:54:07,191 --> 01:54:08,351
Aunt!

1675
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,420
Bangari!
- Bangari! Come!

1676
01:54:15,566 --> 01:54:18,000
How are you?
- Come! We'll go check--

1677
01:54:19,069 --> 01:54:21,936
Master!
- Hey! Wait here!

1678
01:54:23,741 --> 01:54:25,299
Master! Just this one time.

1679
01:54:27,511 --> 01:54:28,569
Come!

1680
01:54:57,875 --> 01:55:00,571
''Give the young girl a saree to wear.''

1681
01:55:01,879 --> 01:55:04,746
''The small girl has
become young women now.''

1682
01:55:05,783 --> 01:55:09,776
''Give the young girl a saree to wear.''

1683
01:55:09,853 --> 01:55:16,315
''Bangari uncle is here to
get the auspicious event started.''

1684
01:55:17,861 --> 01:55:21,797
''My heart blooms looking
at my groom's face.''

1685
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:25,801
''My groom's heart smiles
like a tender flower.''

1686
01:55:25,903 --> 01:55:29,600
''We have regained happiness.''

1687
01:55:29,907 --> 01:55:36,039
''Once the family unites,
there is happiness everywhere.''

1688
01:55:36,914 --> 01:55:41,180
''There is happiness everywhere.''

1689
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:45,845
''My heart blooms looking
at my groom's face.''

1690
01:55:45,923 --> 01:55:49,825
''My groom's heart smiles
like a tender flower.''

1691
01:55:49,893 --> 01:55:53,852
''We have regained happiness.''

1692
01:55:53,931 --> 01:56:00,837
''Once the family unites,
there is happiness everywhere.''

1693
01:56:00,904 --> 01:56:05,204
''There is happiness everywhere.''

1694

''A wonderful relationship

''This is the love the
queen has for the king.''

1696
01:56:37,875 --> 01:56:41,436
''This is a very special

''My heart blooms with
happiness on seeing you.''

1704
01:57:13,844 --> 01:57:17,780
''My groom's heart smiles
like a tender flower.''

1705
01:57:41,772 --> 01:57:45,503
''This bond strengthens
on the smile we share.''

1706
01:57:45,576 --> 01:57:49,774
''However, we get to know the real
strength of the bond during problem.''

1707

'' This a beautiful relationship.
This is sacred like a temple.''

01:58:01,558 --> 01:58:05,153
''l am a devotee here.''

1711
01:58:05,228 --> 01:58:09,255
''All this is l because of you,
l am very thankful to you.''

1712
01:58:09,433 --> 01:58:11,924
''l am a part of this house.''

1713
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:36,489
''l feel extremely happy
about being a part of this house.''

01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:41,395

''Once the family unites,
there is happiness everywhere.''

1719
01:59:00,417 --> 01:59:04,877
''There is happiness everywhere..''

1720
01:59:30,781 --> 01:59:32,442
Why do all of you look so dull?

1721
01:59:32,549 --> 01:59:34,141
Why are you all silent?

1722
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:37,709
He is feeling bad that we
were not invited to this function.

1723
01:59:37,788 --> 01:59:39,813
Only ladies participate
in such kind of function.

1724
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:43,120
All ladies in our
house are dead and gone.

1725
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:45,928
So? He is the eldest
person in the family.

1726
01:59:46,029 --> 01:59:47,428
Can't they invite him to bless the child?

1727
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:49,897
There will be another function
soon for him to go and bless them.

1728
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,025
What other function?
- Hospital.

1729
01:59:52,402 --> 01:59:54,893
They are going to inaugurate
that hospital soon!

1730
01:59:55,072 --> 01:59:57,006
Super speciality hospital.

1731
01:59:57,074 --> 01:59:58,735
They will definitely invite you then.

1732
01:59:58,842 --> 02:00:01,538
You should definitely go and bless them.

1733
02:00:11,455 --> 02:00:14,788
What has happened to Bangari?
He has done such a good job.

1734
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:17,654
There is a lot of difference in him.
- Yes, uncle!

1735
02:00:17,828 --> 02:00:19,352
We can definitely get
him married to our Chitra.

1736
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:21,593
Brother in law has
to make the final call.

1737
02:00:22,833 --> 02:00:24,460
''We pray to Lord Sridhara.''

1738
02:00:24,601 --> 02:00:26,125
Looks like he is interested.
- ''We pray to Lord Rishikeshwara!''

1739
02:00:27,404 --> 02:00:29,929
Okay dad!
He is praying. l'll call you later.

1740
02:00:30,107 --> 02:00:31,972
Hey Ram! Come here.

1741
02:00:32,409 --> 02:00:33,137
Just a minute!

1742
02:00:33,243 --> 02:00:34,733
ls it your dad on call?
- Dad!

1743
02:00:35,078 --> 02:00:36,602
Give the line to me. Let me talk to him.
- Balraju sir wants to talk to you.

1744
02:00:36,713 --> 02:00:39,682
Dad eh? No! No! No!

1745
02:00:40,951 --> 02:00:41,713
Give it to me!

1746
02:00:41,785 --> 02:00:43,082
Dad, l am giving the line to Balraju sir.

1747
02:00:43,587 --> 02:00:44,485
Master!

1748
02:00:44,688 --> 02:00:45,882
Greetings, sir!

1749
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:53,761
Greetings! - You have helped me
reopen this hospital.

1750
02:00:55,098 --> 02:00:57,225
How will l ever repay this help?

1751
02:00:59,302 --> 02:01:00,963
You have raised your son really well.

1752
02:01:02,038 --> 02:01:05,098
l am sure you wouldn't need anything
else, when you have a son like him.

1753
02:01:05,609 --> 02:01:07,543
Not everyone is lucky with this.

1754
02:01:09,546 --> 02:01:13,175
l don't understand why l am shedding
tears of joy, while l am talking to you.

1755
02:01:15,285 --> 02:01:18,777
l wish you and your son have a happy,
long life.

1756
02:01:20,824 --> 02:01:21,848
l will give the line to him.

1757
02:01:37,774 --> 02:01:39,173
My name is Kodukku.

1758
02:01:39,442 --> 02:01:42,138
lf you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask me.

1759
02:01:42,445 --> 02:01:45,573
ls that okay?
- Kodukku!

1760
02:01:45,782 --> 02:01:46,441
Who has come here?

1761
02:01:46,516 --> 02:01:47,778
Few guests have come to seek
our girls hand for marriage.

1762
02:01:47,918 --> 02:01:49,943
Yet again this trouble for Chitra!
- They haven't come to see Chitra.

1763
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:53,021
They are here to see Satya.
Groom is a doctor from America.

1764
02:01:53,123 --> 02:01:54,420
He looks like a cinema hero!

1765
02:02:04,267 --> 02:02:08,897
All this is mere formality. l feel lucky
to be associated with your family.

1766
02:02:09,306 --> 02:02:11,171
By God's grace,
l have got this wonderful opportunity.

1767
02:02:11,641 --> 02:02:14,974
By God's grace,
we are doing really good in America.

1768
02:02:16,046 --> 02:02:18,139
lf you agree,
we can get done with these formalities.

1769
02:02:19,649 --> 02:02:21,173
l have heard a lot about your family.

1770
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,579
Our grand daughter is indeed lucky.

1771
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:28,655
l am concerned about just one thing.
Your son is a doctor in America.

1772
02:02:29,593 --> 02:02:31,322
Do we have to send her that far--
- Oh! You don't have to worry uncle.

1773
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:33,089
Even my son refuses to stay there.

1774
02:02:33,296 --> 02:02:35,230
We are planning to
move to lndia for his sake.

1775
02:02:35,298 --> 02:02:38,131
l heard you are planning
to open a hospital here.

1776
02:02:38,268 --> 02:02:41,260
lf you agree,
he will help you set up this hospital.

1777
02:02:41,371 --> 02:02:44,534
Once they get married, he can
stay here and look after the hospital.

1778
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:47,668
Great! l always wanted someone
from my family to run the hospital.

1779
02:02:47,744 --> 02:02:49,609
l have got a solution to it now.
There is no more to think.

1780
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:51,570
You can accept this proposal.
Exchange the trays.

1781
02:03:06,663 --> 02:03:08,756
Shut up! This is no cinema.

1782
02:03:09,566 --> 02:03:11,761
For to confess our love before others...

1783
02:03:11,868 --> 02:03:13,529
...and marry you irrespective
of their consent.

1784
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:16,230
Just talk sense!

1785
02:03:19,042 --> 02:03:23,775
My dad has suffered for years. l will
not do anything to upset this family.

1786
02:03:28,251 --> 02:03:29,047
Hey!

1787
02:03:31,855 --> 02:03:34,619
Any day family's happiness
is more important than our happiness.

1788
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:40,887
Even now if grand dad
gets to know who l am--

1789
02:03:44,968 --> 02:03:47,129
No need. No!

1790
02:03:54,144 --> 02:03:55,111
No!

1791
02:03:58,181 --> 02:04:00,046
Everything is falling in place just now.

1792
02:04:02,052 --> 02:04:03,110
l will not destroy it.

1793
02:04:09,025 --> 02:04:11,493
Please forget me.
- l don't care about any of it.

1794
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:15,127
l love you and l want you.

1795
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:19,794
lf l get married to someone else,
only my corpse will go out of this house.

1796
02:04:21,504 --> 02:04:24,598
l am not trying to say any dialogues.
l am telling you the truth.

1797
02:04:27,077 --> 02:04:28,305
After this, it is your call.

1798
02:04:39,456 --> 02:04:42,789
Hey! Hey! Hey Bangari!
- Stop here.

1799
02:04:42,959 --> 02:04:44,790
Have you gone mad?
Did you get drunk again?

1800
02:04:44,894 --> 02:04:46,953
Yes l did. Move aside.
- Hey! Stop there.

1801
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:51,464
Hey! Where is mom? Where is she?

1802
02:04:52,102 --> 02:04:55,196
Hey! Do you have any sense?

1803
02:04:55,472 --> 02:04:57,235
What have you done?
- Have you got drunk again?

1804
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:58,238
What is wrong with you?

1805
02:04:58,341 --> 02:05:00,241
Please stop.
- l will kill all of you.

1806
02:05:00,577 --> 02:05:02,238
lf your dad gets to know if this,
he will kill you.

1807
02:05:02,345 --> 02:05:03,744
ls father in law at home?
- Call him.

1808
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:05,973
l will talk to him directly.
- What are you going to do? Get out.

1809
02:05:06,082 --> 02:05:08,107
Why should l get out? Call him here.
- Oh God! Hey!

1810
02:05:08,318 --> 02:05:10,809
What is wrong with you?
What is your problem?

1811
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:13,286
Hey! Why are you getting
Satya married to someone else?

1812
02:05:13,623 --> 02:05:14,453
l will not accept to it.

1813
02:05:16,693 --> 02:05:18,456
Who are you to object?
- Don't come in between.

1814
02:05:18,561 --> 02:05:19,789
Hey! Why do you feel so jealous,
you idiot?

1815
02:05:20,063 --> 02:05:21,997
lf you don't get married,
won't you let others marry too.

1816
02:05:22,165 --> 02:05:24,895
She has to get married.
- Oh God! You have misunderstood.

1817
02:05:25,001 --> 02:05:28,027
She is your daughter.
- l know that very well. Dad!

1818
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:30,436
Ouch! Leave me.
- Please understand. Call this off!

1819
02:05:30,573 --> 02:05:33,872
Dad!
- Stop this nonsense. l will kill you.

1820
02:05:34,644 --> 02:05:37,204
How dare you raise hands against woman?
Aren't you feeling ashamed?

1821
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:40,042
lt is an ideal match for her.
Groom is a doctor in America.

1822
02:05:40,150 --> 02:05:41,310
He has agreed to run the hospital.

1823
02:05:41,384 --> 02:05:44,285
We were able to reopen the hospital
only because of him.

1824
02:05:44,354 --> 02:05:44,979
Uncle!

1825
02:05:45,055 --> 02:05:46,545
lf that guy is from America,
this one is from London.

1826
02:05:46,756 --> 02:05:48,519
Uncle! Please stop.
- Get Satya married to Abhi.

1827
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:49,683
He is ideal match for Satya.

1828
02:05:49,793 --> 02:05:51,624
Shut your trap.
Have you lost your senses?

1829
02:05:51,795 --> 02:05:54,821
Stop saying such senseless things.
You can't burden him and his family.

1830
02:05:54,931 --> 02:05:56,728
Family eh? Do you know who he is?

1831
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,233
lf l tell you--
- Bangari Uncle! Please listen to me.

1832
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:00,792
Do you understand what you are doing?
Please listen to me.

1833
02:06:00,904 --> 02:06:03,168
Bangari uncle!
You will ruin the whole thing.

1834
02:06:03,273 --> 02:06:04,740
Hey! Give that here.

1835
02:06:04,808 --> 02:06:07,072
Satya! Take this. Show them his photos.

1836
02:06:07,343 --> 02:06:10,005
Show it to everyone.

1837
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:12,344
lndu! Go get it.
Satya! Please don't do it.

1838
02:06:12,415 --> 02:06:14,042
Please! Please! Satya! Stop this.
- Please give it back to me.

1839
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,217
Bangari uncle, please listen to me.

1840
02:06:16,653 --> 02:06:18,848
Hey Satya! Please stop.
- You go ahead.

1841
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:21,081
Satya! Please. You will ruin everything.
Please listen.

1842
02:06:21,257 --> 02:06:23,418
Please! Bangari uncle,
grand dad shouldn't know about this.

1843
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:26,693
Satya! Please don't open it. Please stop.

1844
02:06:26,796 --> 02:06:28,764
Bangari uncle! Please listen to me.
- Wait here.

1845
02:06:28,832 --> 02:06:32,393
She shouldn't know about it.
Please Satya!

1846
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:33,936
Please Satya! Please!

1847
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:35,971
Please stop it, Satya! Please!

1848
02:06:36,072 --> 02:06:38,302
Please stop it. Satya, please!

1849
02:06:38,408 --> 02:06:39,272
No need.

1850
02:06:42,145 --> 02:06:43,407
Brother!

1851
02:07:08,271 --> 02:07:09,602
He is our brother's son.

1852
02:07:28,491 --> 02:07:30,823
Why didn't you tell me, Abhi?
- Grand mom!

1853
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:42,736
Why didn't you tell me dear?

1854
02:07:48,344 --> 02:07:50,676
All of you come here.
- What for?

1855
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:53,141
Your dad shouldn't know about this.
- Why do we have to hide it from him?

1856
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:54,807
Please promise on me,
that you won't tell him.

1857
02:08:41,097 --> 02:08:43,190
l must not know, what you all know.
That's it, right?

1858
02:08:44,701 --> 02:08:47,898
So, will you make them promise on you?

1859
02:08:51,908 --> 02:08:52,932
Why?

1860
02:08:55,078 --> 02:08:57,444
You think l'll push him
out once l get to know who he is.

1861
02:08:59,082 --> 02:09:01,573
l am heartless beast. That's all l am.

1862
02:09:06,256 --> 02:09:08,486
He may be your elder son.

1863
02:09:08,925 --> 02:09:11,485
But, he did go against my
wishes in pursuit of his career.

1864
02:09:12,328 --> 02:09:14,262
He left us all behind.

1865
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:17,456
He didn't care to check, if we
are alive or dead in the last 20 years.

1866
02:09:18,534 --> 02:09:22,300
Now, his son comes here and fools me.

1867
02:09:22,972 --> 02:09:26,066
Yet, he means more to you than me.

1868
02:09:26,743 --> 02:09:28,335
All of you have come together on this.

1869
02:09:30,113 --> 02:09:32,047
All of you have orphaned me.

1870
02:09:36,019 --> 02:09:37,509
What should l do now?

1871
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:39,716
No matter what happens,
l must shut my trap...

1872
02:09:40,056 --> 02:09:41,887
...and get my grand
daughter married to him.

1873
02:09:41,991 --> 02:09:46,485
After that, l have to lose face before
others and look like a fool. ls that all?

1874
02:09:49,432 --> 02:09:52,196
l feel the ones who have made
mistake shouldn't stay in this house.

1875
02:09:54,437 --> 02:09:59,773
Till date, l didn't know that,
all of you disapprove that logic.

1876
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:01,838
ln that case...

1877
02:10:02,745 --> 02:10:07,375
...l having made a mistake,
l shouldn't stay here.

1878
02:10:07,817 --> 02:10:09,216
l will go out of this house.

1879
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:11,880
You can lead your life happily
with your kids.

1880
02:10:11,954 --> 02:10:13,888
Dear!
- Please forgive me.

1881
02:10:14,424 --> 02:10:16,289
You are a bigger fraud than your dad!
- Master!

1882
02:10:16,926 --> 02:10:21,295
He left me behind. But, you have
made my entire family go against me.

1883
02:10:22,098 --> 02:10:23,861
Thanks a lot (Sarcastically)! Sigh!

1884
02:10:24,167 --> 02:10:26,397
l didn't mean to do this, Grand dad.
- Who is your grand dad?

1885
02:10:26,469 --> 02:10:27,527
lt's you!

1886
02:10:29,839 --> 02:10:32,000
Whether you like it or not,
approve it or not...

1887
02:10:32,308 --> 02:10:34,401
...l am your grandson
and you are my grand dad.

1888
02:10:39,682 --> 02:10:43,379
l thought you will get angry
if l told you the truth. ls it wrong?

1889
02:10:43,786 --> 02:10:45,549
l have never tried to betray you.

1890
02:10:48,424 --> 02:10:50,449
l love Satya!

1891
02:10:52,462 --> 02:10:54,987
However, l want all of you
more than being married to Satya.

1892
02:10:59,602 --> 02:11:04,767
l came here on my dad's behalf.
But, l can't live without all of you now.

1893
02:11:06,442 --> 02:11:08,307
l feel like staying with all of you.

1894
02:11:12,215 --> 02:11:14,649
Why do you have to walk
out of the house for my mistake?

1895
02:11:17,787 --> 02:11:21,018
Just like you say, the one who
has made mistake shouldn't stay here.

1896
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,659
l have made a mistake.

1897
02:11:27,363 --> 02:11:28,796
l will leave this house.

1898
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:31,561
Abhi!

1899
02:11:34,137 --> 02:11:37,629
Abhi! Don't leave. Please listen to me.
- Grand dad needs all of you.

1900
02:11:38,374 --> 02:11:39,705
Please take good care of him.

1901
02:11:42,211 --> 02:11:43,269
Abhi!

1902
02:11:52,355 --> 02:11:53,686
Please don't go.

1903
02:12:19,282 --> 02:12:20,715
You haven't had anything
to eat since morning.

1904
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:24,611
Please have this.

1905
02:12:32,094 --> 02:12:33,356
l wish to tell you something.

1906
02:12:35,731 --> 02:12:37,631
My parents showed me your picture...

1907
02:12:38,534 --> 02:12:39,967
...and told me that you were my groom.

1908
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:43,002
l didn't understand. l started crying.

1909
02:12:44,173 --> 02:12:47,267
My mother convinced me and told that,
husbands are like Gods.

1910
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:49,600
You will have to lead
your life with them.

1911
02:12:50,346 --> 02:12:52,940
Keeping that in mind,
l got married to you.

1912
02:12:53,516 --> 02:12:55,950
No matter what you do,
l see it as God's actions.

1913
02:12:57,086 --> 02:12:58,713
Not even once...

1914
02:12:58,921 --> 02:13:02,322
...have l thought
you have made a mistake.

1915
02:13:02,792 --> 02:13:04,589
l thought so because you are my God.

1916
02:13:05,261 --> 02:13:07,627
Today, that small boy...

1917
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:12,563
...had come all the
way here to unite with us.

1918
02:13:13,169 --> 02:13:15,364
You have sent such a
good boy out of this house.

1919
02:13:15,872 --> 02:13:17,931
Not even once you attempted to stop him.

1920
02:13:18,975 --> 02:13:21,375
You are not a God anymore.
God won't keep quiet like this.

1921
02:13:21,644 --> 02:13:23,009
Your just another normal person.
That's it.

1922
02:13:24,947 --> 02:13:29,611
l want my children and grandchildren.
l am going to live with them.

1923
02:13:30,353 --> 02:13:33,220
Please have your food.
You have been starving from morning.

1924
02:13:36,092 --> 02:13:37,650
Has his grandson come?

1925
02:13:38,794 --> 02:13:42,195
So! The prince is here.

1926
02:13:43,799 --> 02:13:45,460
This is not right.

1927
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:08,615
Tell, dad!
- l have landed here.

1928
02:14:09,225 --> 02:14:10,783
You have won!

1929
02:14:11,661 --> 02:14:13,356
Dad!
- Abhi!

1930
02:14:14,964 --> 02:14:16,864
l am very anxious now.

1931
02:14:19,368 --> 02:14:22,929
Oh!
- l hope dad does not have a problem.

1932
02:14:24,173 --> 02:14:26,664
No matter what he says,
l will stay back here.

1933
02:14:27,043 --> 02:14:30,240
By the way, where is grand dad?
- Grand dad is--

1934
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,637
Why aren't you talking properly?

1935
02:14:32,882 --> 02:14:35,180
ls he around you? Do l call you later?

1936
02:14:35,251 --> 02:14:37,310
Dad! Everything is fine.

1937
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,680
l hope the hospital is ready.

1938
02:14:39,288 --> 02:14:40,186
ls it?

1939
02:14:40,623 --> 02:14:42,818
l am right outside the hospital.
You come.

1940
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:44,790
Bye!

1941
02:14:45,761 --> 02:14:47,092
Love you!
- Love you, too!

1942
02:14:57,139 --> 02:14:59,630
l am sorry, dad! Sorry!

1943
02:15:22,298 --> 02:15:24,664

1944
02:15:33,275 --> 02:15:34,435
Brother!

1945
02:15:45,121 --> 02:15:46,554

lndu!

1948
02:16:10,713 --> 02:16:11,907
lndu!

1949
02:16:19,622 --> 02:16:21,453
Brother!
- Hey!

1950
02:16:25,928 --> 02:16:27,156
Brother!

1951
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:36,195
Brother!

1952
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:39,735
Brother!
- lndu!

1953
02:16:41,077 --> 02:16:42,203
Save me!

1954
02:16:42,311 --> 02:16:43,676
Hey! Start the car.

1955
02:16:45,381 --> 02:16:46,279
Stop!

1956
02:17:02,965 --> 02:17:04,159
Brother!

1957
02:17:12,508 --> 02:17:13,372
Brother!

1958
02:17:52,414 --> 02:17:53,711
Brother!

1959
02:17:55,184 --> 02:17:56,446
Brother!

1960
02:18:01,891 --> 02:18:05,349
Please stop! l will never repeat it.
Sorry.

1961
02:18:08,964 --> 02:18:10,295
Do you know who she is?

1962
02:18:12,134 --> 02:18:13,294
She is your sister.

1963
02:18:15,604 --> 02:18:18,573
We are one family. Family!

1964
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:32,514
Brother!

1965
02:18:33,656 --> 02:18:35,055
Brother!

1966
02:18:38,027 --> 02:18:39,517
Brother!

1967
02:18:39,995 --> 02:18:42,225
Abhi!

1968
02:18:43,999 --> 02:18:44,966
Brother!

1969
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:48,828
How dare you.

1970
02:18:49,205 --> 02:18:50,604
Ouch!
- Get lost!

1971
02:18:53,609 --> 02:18:55,474
Yeah!
- Please let him go!

1972
02:18:58,414 --> 02:18:59,438
Pleas tell them, uncle.

1973
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:02,178
Let him go. Don't hit him.

1974
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,579
Abhi!

1975
02:19:10,559 --> 02:19:11,992
lndu!
- Dad!

1976
02:19:12,561 --> 02:19:16,292
Brother.
- Uncle! My dad is here.

1977
02:19:17,833 --> 02:19:18,822
Abhi!

1978
02:19:28,677 --> 02:19:29,905
Abhi!

1979
02:19:31,313 --> 02:19:32,507
Oh God! Abhi!

1980
02:19:36,185 --> 02:19:38,585
Ma'am! That Bachi has shot our Abhi down.

1981
02:19:38,654 --> 02:19:42,784
He is serious. Sir!
They have shot our boy down.

1982
02:19:44,493 --> 02:19:45,391
Please wait.

1983
02:20:32,508 --> 02:20:33,600
Chandra!

1984
02:20:38,714 --> 02:20:39,544
Grand dad!

1985
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:11,102
Whether you like it or no,
approve of it or no...

1986
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:13,471
...you are my grand
dad and l am your grandson.

1987
02:22:29,491 --> 02:22:33,393
Abhi! Abhi! Grand dad is here.

1988
02:22:34,897 --> 02:22:38,560
Please see! He has come for you.

1989
02:22:39,101 --> 02:22:41,535
Abhi! Please open your eyes.

1990
02:22:43,372 --> 02:22:44,236
Hey!

1991
02:22:45,908 --> 02:22:47,034
Abhi!

1992
02:23:04,593 --> 02:23:05,890
This is just a small problem.

1993
02:23:06,428 --> 02:23:07,895
There was a small fight.

1994
02:23:09,398 --> 02:23:12,492
As such, Bachi doesn't know who l am.

1995
02:23:16,105 --> 02:23:18,039
Once l get better.

1996
02:23:20,909 --> 02:23:22,809
l will leave immediately, master.

1997
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,008
Grand dad!

1998
02:23:27,749 --> 02:23:28,875
l am your grand dad!

1999
02:23:30,285 --> 02:23:31,343
Where are you going?

2000
02:23:33,555 --> 02:23:36,820
l didn't know who you were.

2001
02:23:39,995 --> 02:23:42,327
How did l fail to recognise you?

2002
02:23:44,733 --> 02:23:46,826
How did l hurt my grand son?

2003
02:23:49,805 --> 02:23:51,329
l am getting old.

2004
02:23:52,508 --> 02:23:56,569
lf you plan to leave,
l will hit you on your legs.

2005
02:23:58,514 --> 02:24:01,745
Come. We'll go home.

2006
02:24:02,117 --> 02:24:03,914
Okay. Where is your doctor?

2007
02:24:06,088 --> 02:24:07,146
Doctor!

2008
02:24:24,439 --> 02:24:27,704
Doctor sir! You are our God.

2009
02:24:29,645 --> 02:24:33,274
You have saved our grand
son and in turn made us happy.

2010
02:24:35,918 --> 02:24:37,613
How do l repay you for this help!

2011
02:24:39,621 --> 02:24:41,612
Our sincere thanks.
We are highly indebted to you.

2012
02:24:43,926 --> 02:24:45,291
Can l take my grandson home?

2013
02:24:56,405 --> 02:24:58,669
Dad! Please hug me just once.

2014
02:24:59,575 --> 02:25:00,701
That's enough!

2015
02:25:08,784 --> 02:25:09,944
My son!

2016
02:25:18,994 --> 02:25:20,291
Yes!

2017
02:25:30,405 --> 02:25:31,167
Come!

2018
02:25:33,875 --> 02:25:35,035
Come closer.

2019
02:25:37,379 --> 02:25:41,179
l blindly believed the fact that welfare
of village indicates our welfare too.

2020
02:25:42,384 --> 02:25:44,875
l am from the previous generation.
l will be like this.

2021
02:25:47,289 --> 02:25:49,189
However, l have understood that
the entire village is our family...

2022
02:25:50,892 --> 02:25:53,417
...and only if a family is united,
it can help the village.

2023
02:25:54,963 --> 02:25:56,828
l have learnt this
from my foreign grand son.

2024
02:26:01,103 --> 02:26:02,570
Have all your wishes come true, dear?

2025
02:26:11,046 --> 02:26:13,571
Hey! Please make a call to that
American based wedding proposal.

2026
02:26:13,682 --> 02:26:14,478
Grand dad!

2027
02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:17,148
We have to convey
our disinterest to them.

2028
02:26:17,386 --> 02:26:21,982
Son in law! Talk to the priest
and fix auspicious hour for 3 weddings.

2029
02:26:22,057 --> 02:26:23,285
