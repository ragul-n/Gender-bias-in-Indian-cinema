1
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:34,255
Granny, we are leaving her
safely to your place.

2
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,265
Not alone but with interest.
Your daughter has won the..

3
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,268
..the music competition trophy
this year too. Take this.

4
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:44,273
l knew that no one else could
win against my Shabbo.

5
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:49,270
Okay dear, we take your
leave now. Bye bye.

6
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,278
Granny! - Shabbo. - Today
l enjoyed a lot in college.

7
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,290
The boys in my college asked me
to sing over and over again.

8
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:06,287
Beti, the boys in college are like
that. Don't listen to them.

9
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:17,299
Then there was a crazy boy who said
he was madly in love with me.

10
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:22,303
Wretch! - Then he winked
and said: ''Darling!''

11
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,312
What? He winked at you?

12
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:30,319
Yes granny, but his style was so
romantic that l couldn't get angry at him.

13
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:34,326
Another flirt actually held my hand
and said let's elope and..

14
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,325
..get married. And if you won't
come l'll take you away by force.

15
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,327
And you kept listening
to all this quietly?

16
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,329
Didn't you tell him
anything?

17
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:45,337
l did. l told him there is
no need to carry me away.

18
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:50,339
l will come with you
willingly. - Shameless!

19
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,345
Couldn't you find anyone else
to play your jokes on?

20
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:56,344
Let your mother come, this time
l'm going to tell her that, ..

21
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:02,351
..l can't take care
of you any longer.

22
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,348
23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, only
four days left for mom to come.

23
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,362
This time l will not
let her go back.

24
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:14,363
l'll also go with her. l can't
live without her anymore.

25
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,364
And you think your mom
can live without you?

26
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,372
Just like you she also must
be suffering without you.

27
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,368
lf she wished, she wouldn't have
kept you away from her heart?

28
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:30,382
But what can she do?
She is helpless.

29
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,381
Your stepfather is
such a rascal.

30
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,389
Yes, l know. Sometimes when
Nissar comes to take mom..

31
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:44,393
..l don't like it.
He gives me dirty looks.

32
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,399
l get very scared
of him.

33
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,403
He must be also troubling
my mother a lot.

34
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:58,399
Because whenever she comes
here she looks very sad.

35
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:07,409
She says, ''You complete
your studies and get married.

36
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:10,422
So that l can die peacefully.

37
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,426
After that l'll not
show my face to anyone.''

38
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,429
Granny, why does she talk
like that?

39
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,432
Poor thing, she has gone
through a lot of hardships.

40
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,435
The world has troubled
her a lot.

41
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,439
Beti, she is living only
for you or else..

42
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,445
Telegram, madam.

43
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,451
You're unnecessarily getting worried.
See, it's from you mother.

44
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,465
Granny!
- What happened, Shabbo?

45
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,468
Mother is very ill.
- Mother is ill!

46
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,475
Come on, carry
my luggage.

47
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,478
Nissar hasn't come yet?

48
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,484
Shabana, how are you?

49
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,482
How is mother?

50
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,485
Not very well, but
now that you have come..

51
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,487
..everything will be fine.
- ls Najma in the hospital?

52
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,489
No, she is at home.

53
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,491
What? At home?!
- Yes, she is at home.

54
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,498
My home and my workplace
are one and the same.

55
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,503
Coolie! Coolie!

56
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:41,502
Granny, why is Nissar wearing
such strange clothes?

57
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,507
Beti, today he is dressed in
his true form. Be brave.

58
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,521
God knows what state
your mother is in?

59
00:11:56,562 --> 00:12:00,521
Come to the market of
the beloved's henna.

60
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,536
Come with the sweet
sound of money.

61
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:10,531
The henna of feet and the pink
color of the face are sold here.

62
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:14,546
Come here to buy love or
to lose your heart to someone.

63
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:21,542
Nissar, from where
did you bring her?

64
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,556
From the heaven!

65
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:31,552
You can see her
in the night!!

66
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,566
This is the place to
fun, come on!

67
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:38,570
Come to the market
of the beloved's henna.

68
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,653
Mother!
- Mother!

69
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:18,660
Najma, open the door. Look
what a beauty Shabana has brought with her.

70
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,673
Get up and sing a nice
song in her honor.

71
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,676
l have come to return
your youth to you.

72
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,674
l always praised you
for your youth.

73
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,681
Today you praise your daughter
for her youth.

74
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,685
No!! Mother, no

75
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,683
You've given life, now l can
also end it for you.

76
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:47,688
But, please don't deprive me of
your love, l'm feeling choked, mother.

77
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,703
Open the door, mother.
Let me come close to you.

78
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,706
Najma, open the door! lt isn't
good to be so stubborn!

79
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,710
Embrace her once and all
your sorrows will vanish!

80
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,713
Nissar Miyan! Nissar Miyan! Najma
has jumped from the window!

81
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,711
Najma fell down?
- Mother!

82
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:25,726
Shabana. - Granny, forty days
have passed since mother died..

83
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:31,740
..prepare to return
to Bombay tomorrow.

84
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,741
What are you going
to do in Bombay?

85
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,748
l have removed your name
from your college.

86
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,751
You removed my name
from college?

87
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:44,753
Yes, your name has been
transferred to this shop.

88
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,761
From today you will take your
mother's place in this brothel.

89
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:01,763
Your anger reminds me of your mother.

90
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,771
You scoundrel!
- Shabana!

91
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,788
l'm letting you go this time.

92
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:21,793
lf you ever try to move your limbs
l'll remove your skin and sell it.

93
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,796
Now, open your ears
and listen to me.

94
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,791
From today you're not Shabana.
You're Bai Shabana Jaan.

95
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,806
l have sold you to the rich
Jafar Ali for Rs. 10,000.

96
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:40,801
He'll come tonight
to inspect you.

97
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,815
No! Granny, what's nonsense
is he talking?!

98
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,810
He's right, where will you go
leaving your mother's brothel?

99
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:55,816
Granny! - Yes dear, by
leaving the beloved's henna..

100
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,825
..one doesn't lose the color
of this market.

101
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,832
One's background is always
written over one's face.

102
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,836
lf prostitute's daughter will
not become a prostitute..

103
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,834
..will she become
a Princess?

104
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,842
l'm not a prostitute's
daughter - My father was..

105
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,841
He was Nawab Anwar Kamaal,
am l right?

106
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,849
Tell me of which place
was he the Nawab?

107
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:24,845
All prostitutes make up such
stories, and your mother did the same.

108
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,859
Your father may not have had
a good background, but..

109
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,860
..your mother definitely
had one.

110
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:35,867
She was the best prostitute in this
market of the beloved's henna.

111
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:41,862
lf you won't keep up this tradition,
her soul won't rest in peace.

112
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,879
l have brought such a nice
dress for you,..

113
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,883
..wear it and see you'll
look like a fairy!

114
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,878
Wow! Such a beautiful dress!
At least look at it.

115
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:01,893
Granny, what has happened
to you today?

116
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,898
Beti, till yesterday l was
your mother's servant, and was..

117
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,899
..calling you Nawabzaadi Shabana,
but today l'm his servant..

118
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,900
..so l'll be calling you
Bai Shabana jaan.

119
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,909
Oh God! What am l hearing
today!?

120
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,911
l'm a servant and my job is to
listen to my master.

121
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:24,912
Please stop it, granny.

122
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,923
Jafar Ali Khan seems to be
a rich man..

123
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,921
..have you taken any advance
from him or not?

124
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:38,927
Yes, 2000. - Then give me my
reward - 100 - ls that all?

125
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:43,932
Okay take 200. - No, l'll take
full 500, 200 as my advance..

126
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:45,933
..my work is most difficult.

127
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:52,941
You're very smart. l thought
you'd be as innocent as her.

128
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:54,942
Take this. l'm going to bring
Jafar Ali,..

129
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:58,947
..see that when l return that girl
should be dressed well.

130
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,951
Leave that to me, but when will
you return? - Around 10.30 p.m.

131
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,948
Okay. What's the time now? 7.30 p.m.
- Please return soon.

132
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,974
Don't touch me with your filthy
hands. - To remove this filth..

133
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,975
..a lot of times you have
to become filthy, beti.

134
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,982
lt isn't easy to escape
from Nissar's clutches.

135
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,980
Come.
- What do you mean?

136
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,978
God is witness that whatever l've
said is for your good.

137
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,993
Keeping God as witness you are
sending me on this sinful path.

138
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,997
Only to save you l have used
such filthy words for you.

139
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:50,001
We have very little time left.
lt is 7.30 p.m now.

140
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:51,999
And Nissar will return
by 10.30 p.m.

141
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,001
Before he comes we must go
far away from this place.

142
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:59,007
Granny, forgive me. l have
hurt you. Forgive me.

143
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:02,009
Dear, if l manage to save you
from his clutches..

144
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:07,015
..l'll think l've done
the pilgrimage of Haj.

145
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,022
Granny, but where will we go?

146
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:16,016
Lucknow. My brother stays there.
We'll take shelter there..

147
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:20,028
..the rest depends on God.
Come my dear, come.

148
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:33,044
Beti, sleep for sometime.

149
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,038
ucknow, Granny
right? - Yes.

150
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:43,043
Mother had told me that my father
was also from Lucknow.

151
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:50,058
Shabbo, my daughter, don't cry.
Keep faith in God.

152
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:54,065
Just as good days didn't last
bad days won't last too.

153
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,068
Who knows, something
good might happen.

154
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:01,072
What good still remains to happen?
l have lost my house..

155
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:08,076
..my mother and now also
have a bad reputation.

156
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,077
You must not talk
like this, dear..

157
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:13,080
..one must not lose
hope in God.

158
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,087
The one who has given sorrows
will also give happiness.

159
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:19,086
God may have done all this so
that you go to Lucknow and..

160
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,089
..meet your father.

161
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,092
lf it was in my destiny
to meet my father..

162
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:29,097
..then why would my mother
have suffered so much?

163
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,103
Why should she had to go
through these days?

164
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,106
Your father too must have had
some problems.

165
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,110
He may have come to meet Najma,
but wasn't successful.

166
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:43,111
Searching for Najma
even now ..

167
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:48,116
..he may find you instead.

168
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:57,117
Beti, please open the door. l'm
hanging like this for a long time.

169
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:01,132
What are you doing?

170
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:05,133
You old fellow! Go away!
This is a ladies compartment.

171
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:08,135
Where will this poor man go in
this moving train? What if he falls?

172
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,138
Let him fall and die. What if he
steals something and runs away?

173
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:15,146
Can't you see? He seems to be a
thief, escaped from prison.

174
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:18,145
You mustn't simply doubt anybody
like that. Open the door Shabana.

175
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,170
Baba, why are you sitting
there? Please sit here.

176
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:45,173
No, you be comfortable. l'll sit
here. l'll be getting down..

177
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,175
..at the next station and go to
the gent's compartment.

178
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,199
Granny, you have come to Lucknow
after many years..

179
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,197
Will your brother
recognize you?

180
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:14,205
Why not. - Beti.
- Baba.

181
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:18,206
You have done me a great favour.
l'm grateful to you.

182
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,207
Baba, are you also getting down
at Lucknow? - Yes beti.

183
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:24,215
This is my hometown. Once upon
a time my house and..

184
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,213
..everything of mine belonged
to this place but..

185
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:30,218
..circumstances snatched away
everything and l was destroyed.

186
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:34,225
Beti, are you also
from Lucknow?

187
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:38,226
No, l have come here for the first
time. My father was from Lucknow.

188
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:44,224
Come on dear. - Okay
l take your leave. Good-bye.

189
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:47,234
Good-bye. May you
live long.

190
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,359
Excuse me, can you show me
Nawab Bandook's house?

191
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,357
There. - Thank you.
- Welcome.

192
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,359
Excuse me, is the Nawab inside?
- Yes, please go in..

193
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:05,373
..quietly, he is listening
to some songs.

194
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:12,372
Granny, you said that the Nawab
is your brother, but..

195
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,382
..this seems to be the house
of a very rich Nawab.

196
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,384
My mother used to work as
a maid in his house..

197
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:21,389
..when the prince was just
two months old, his mother died.

198
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:23,390
And then my mother
took care of him.

199
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,397
And that's why l
call him my brother.

200
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:45,416
l had sought my youth
from others!

201
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,248
Son, l want to meet
the Nawab Bandook.

202
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,250
ls it very important?
- Yes.

203
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,252
Then please go up
- Thank you.

204
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:59,260
Some l lost in fight and
the rest waiting for someone!

205
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:04,265
Where are you going?
- To meet Bandooksaab.

206
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:07,267
You told us to go up. - l didn't
mean this upstairs.

207
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:09,269
l meant upstairs
where God lives.

208
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:13,274
Are you saying that my brother
is no longer alive? - Right.

209
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:16,276
The gun has perished but the bullet
is still here.

210
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:22,276
Are you his son? - Yes, l'm his
foster son. They call me Miya Moobole.

211
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:25,290
Actually he had adopted me
because his wife couldn't..

212
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,287
..bear him a child. After
my foster mother died..

213
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:32,293
..my foster father
never spoke a word.

214
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:38,292
One day he climbed the staircase,
fell down, and died.

215
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:41,301
Now tell me how can l help you?
- l had come to meet him.

216
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:45,310
Who are you?
- l'm his sister.

217
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,313
But he didn't
have any sister.

218
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,311
l'm his foster sister.

219
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,320
l think your name
is Rashidan!

220
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:59,324
Father used to talk about you
when he was alive.

221
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,327
He has left a lot of wealth
for you in his will.

222
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:07,321
Why didn't you tell me that
you're my foster aunt earlier?

223
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:11,332
l'm sure she is
your foster daughter.

224
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,330
Very good, now l have
a foster sister too!

225
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,344
Until now there was a lot of
silence in this house.

226
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:21,341
At least say something
now.

227
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:24,344
This fool has been talking
for so long!

228
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:04,438
Anwar Kamaal is alive,
Safdarjung!!

229
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,453
He'll take his revenge.
- Safdarjung.

230
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:54,488
Safdarjung, what will l gain
killing a handicapped man?

231
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:58,503
lf l'll kill you, you'll be
relieved of your agony.

232
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,506
You will be free
from this life.

233
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:05,510
You should be tortured
in such a manner,..

234
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,510
..that you'll want death and
it won't be granted to you.

235
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,518
You should suffer
till you die.

236
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:18,523
Safdarjung, the way l'm
living a lifeless life,..

237
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:21,521
..l'll make your life
worse than mine!

238
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:24,529
Just as l'm missing
my father..

239
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,526
..and dying because
of my destruction..

240
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:30,531
..you too will die craving
for your son!

241
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:37,602
Who are you? Why have you
come here?

242
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:47,602
l am a thief. l had
come to steal.

243
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,619
You have real guts
to speak the truth!

244
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:57,622
You didn't even make
any excuse?

245
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,625
ls there any need
for an excuse..

246
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,623
..when caught in someone's
bedroom?

247
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:09,623
Would you believe if l tell you
l had come to ask how are you?

248
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,629
lf you had come to steal,
then why do you need a knife?

249
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:21,635
Not for others. Theives always
keep some weapon for their safety.

250
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:26,640
Bade Miya, your language
and mannerisms..

251
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,649
..does not allow me to
believe that you're a theif.

252
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,657
l'm sure you have come
for some other purpose.

253
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,661
Tell me, what has brought you here?

254
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,664
lsn't stealing enough reason?

255
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,661
Nobody steals for pleasure.

256
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:44,669
Bade Miya, you seem to
be a very honest man.

257
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,672
Maybe the world has
given you a lot of pain.

258
00:33:55,714 --> 00:34:02,677
Okay, if l let you live with me,
will you stop stealing? - What?

259
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,691
lf l make you my servant
will you stop stealing?

260
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:13,687
How can l.. work in a
house l came to rob?

261
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:18,692
Don't worry, nobody will know
that you had come to steal.

262
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:22,707
My father can't walk,
and his servant has left him..

263
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:25,705
..you will have to take care of him.

264
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,714
Me! - Why? - No, nothing

265
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:33,718
l'm astonished by
the way God treats us.

266
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:36,721
l had come here
to gain something but..

267
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,718
..l'm leaving with something else.

268
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,721
Thank you very much.
l'll report to work from tomorrow.

269
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:46,727
What's your name?
- My name is Khairuddin..

270
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,735
People call me Khairoo. - Good-bye.

271
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:59,734
Excuse me. Do you know the way out?
- No. l'll find my way.

272
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,741
Which way did you come?

273
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,749
From the window.
- Then you may leave the same way.

274
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:10,755
lf you're caught,
l won't be able to help you.

275
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:37,782
What happenned, Mrs. Albert?

276
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,779
Look at him!
How he is acting innocent!

277
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,781
Tell him what you have done!

278
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:50,795
What were you doing?

279
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,799
See, he stuck a cockroach
in place of a pagemark.

280
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,796
You're an ass, Phirangi Miya.

281
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,798
What have you done?

282
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:01,801
l marked it. Or l would've
forgotten where l had to read.

283
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,809
So you should kill
a cockroach and stick it?

284
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,806
Should l have killed
a fly and stuck it?

285
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,814
l can't teach a child like him.

286
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:11,811
Mrs. Albert, you will teach him.

287
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,813
Henceforth he'll
not behave like this.

288
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,815
Say sorry to teacher and
swear that you won't make..

289
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,817
..such a mistake in future.

290
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,819
Say sorry to her.

291
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,832
What's the matter?
Why is he apologising?

292
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,828
Daddy, he has become very naughty!

293
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,830
He keeps harrassing
his teacher a lot!

294
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,838
So, daddy has
explained you your job?

295
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:35,835
Yes son, l have explained it to him.

296
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,837
With God's grace,
he is very efficient.

297
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,839
lt feels as though he has
been working here since years.

298
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:41,841
He already knows all the
doors and windows of the house.

299
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:44,849
You have got used to
this house very soon!

300
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:50,844
Yes, it feels as
though this is my house.

301
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,859
l feel as though the
doors and windows know me.

302
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,856
And l know them well too.

303
00:36:57,896 --> 00:37:01,855
Khairu Miya l feel.. did you
come here for a job in the past?

304
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,869
No. - l feel as if l
have seen you earlier.

305
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:08,873
Well, take me to the hall. - Yes.

306
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:29,883
Moobole Miya!
l think the poet is still sleeping.

307
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,898
So, you're actually sleeping!

308
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:36,896
ls this the time to sleep? lt is 10 o'clock.
lt's time to go to college!

309
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,898
Come on get up!

310
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:53,907
Who..who..are..are..
- l'm..l'm..

311
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:08,933
What happened?
Have you left your eyes at home?

312
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,937
You rat! You got me
into trouble, isn't it?

313
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,934
What's the matter?
Are you lifting away something from here?

314
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,936
Yes, l'm lifting my legs
on my head and running.

315
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,938
What happened?
At least tell me something.

316
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:19,939
Pal, l barged into your bedroom..

317
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:21,941
l didn't know who was sleeping.

318
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:24,944
l thought you're still sleeping
so without thinking l bashed her!

319
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:28,953
l swear by you, when she
lifted her blanket.. - What happened?

320
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:31,956
l was so nervous. l had
hit her so hard that she must..

321
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,953
..be still massaging herself.

322
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,955
Miya, who is she?
From where has she come?

323
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,960
She is the daughter of
my late father's sister!

324
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,967
Whom did you beat?
Aunty or her daughter?

325
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,964
From her physical appearance
l think she must be the daughter.

326
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,966
Come l'll introduce you to her.

327
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:48,968
Take the name of God.
l can't face her!

328
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,971
l had come to pick you. You weren't
coming to college for four days.

329
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,973
l thought you were in some problem.

330
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,976
But when l come here,
l see an angel in your house!

331
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:58,978
How long will she stay here?

332
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,980
She'll be living here forever.

333
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:01,981
Poor thing, she's in great trouble.

334
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:03,983
Who? The sister or daughter.
- The daughter!

335
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,985
She is educated, and a poet.

336
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:08,993
She was studying in third year
of college and her fate changed.

337
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:14,988
And here l'm not clearing my
third year since last three years.

338
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,997
Yusuf Miya, l think that life's
all great events take place in the..

339
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:21,000
..third year. Even the famous poet,
Mirza Ghalib was thrown out of..

340
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,003
..the Rampur court in his third year.

341
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:27,006
Do one thing.
Take her tutions and you will pass.

342
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,008
What a great idea!

343
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,016
l never realised that the
teacher and the student are here!

344
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:34,013
She was also saying the same thing.

345
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:37,016
She wants to give tutions to
pass her time. She gets really bored.

346
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,017
Now you don't bore me.

347
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,019
Bring your books
and let's go to college.

348
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:42,021
Have l ever gone to
college with my books?

349
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:45,029
Never. - Never.
- Okay then let's go. - Come on.

350
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:59,032
Hello Rosy. Shut up!
- Hello Salma. - Shut up!

351
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,047
Hello Moonbole.
- Shut up! - ldiot!

352
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,044
Since morning every
girl is scolding me.

353
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,046
l don't know whose face
l saw in the morning?

354
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:27,071
Friend, l think this girl
hasn't seen the film 'Mere Mehboob'.

355
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,074
She must have
definitely seen the film.

356
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:32,071
But you mustn't
have seen your face.

357
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,073
There is a lot of difference
between the good looking..

358
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,075
..Rajendra kumar and your face!

359
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,077
But whatever you may say,
the slap was really a solid one.

360
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,079
The sound reveberated
in the whole college.

361
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,080
Moonbole has nothing to say.

362
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:44,083
But who is she?
Her slap has left my teeth shaking!

363
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,091
l must find out.
- Without even seeing her?

364
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:49,088
How will l recognize her in her viel?

365
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:54,087
l'll tell you. You at least know
the impact of her slap. - Very well, friend.

366
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:56,095
l can tell you the
weight of all her five fingers.

367
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,097
lt's very simple.
Tomorrow, when you come to college..

368
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:04,104
..beg every girl in the viel
to slap you in the name of God.

369
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,112
You keep track of the weight
and we'll keep track of the sound.

370
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:09,108
lt's alright.

371
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,110
Wow, what a wonderful idea!

372
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,139
lt means the crow
asked the mouse to come out.

373
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,143
No teacher, one crow
asked the mouse to come out.

374
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,149
The crow.. no.. no.. no.

375
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:52,156
Phirangi Miya, if you have a
cockroach, throw it on this fat cat.

376
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:55,159
Why uncle? Yesterday you were
siding the teacher a lot.

377
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,156
Young man, this teacher isn't nice.
She is a coward.

378
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,164
lf she is so scared of a cockroach,
what will she teach you?

379
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,162
But you had brought
this fat teacher for me.

380
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:06,170
She is big in size only.
Her heart is very small.

381
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:09,173
Make her run away. - l'll use
a mouse to make her run. - Mouse?

382
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,176
From where will you bring a mouse?
- See this.

383
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:14,178
Why are you holding this?

384
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,175
l was learning about a mouse today.

385
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,178
Phirangi Miya, you're very smart.
Come on, show your smartness.

386
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,207
Means, the mouse climbed the wall.

387
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,210
The mouse climbed the wall.

388
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,215
Means, the mouse climbed the wall.

389
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,212
lt isn't climbing teacher.

390
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,214
Why doesn't it climb. See this.

391
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,222
This is a photo teacher,
the real mouse isn't climbing.

392
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:03,216
Why won't it climb. You catch
a real mouse and l'll make it climb.

393
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,239
What happened?
- l'll not teach him at all.

394
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,243
You know that this idiot
left a mouse on me. - Mouse?

395
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,247
He is always up to his pranks!

396
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,250
You're very naughty Khalid.

397
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,247
You a small child and
you're playing such pranks!

398
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:31,250
Mrs. Albert just stop teaching
him. Leave this idiot.

399
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,259
Take 200 for your
salary and l apologize.

400
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,268
Naughty fellow,
you made her run away.

401
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:47,100
Never mind, tomorrow l'll bring
a better teacher than her.

402
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,102
Why uncle? l made the
fat cat run away,..

403
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:50,103
..so why another cat?

404
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,105
Now l'll bring a beautiful
cat for you..

405
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:59,113
..small, fair and innocent. And her
voice.. very soft and sweet voice.

406
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:04,118
And her eyes.. eyes like
angels. Anybody who looks into them..

407
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:07,120
..attains eternity!
- What is eternity?

408
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,127
Phirangi Miya, you ask
too many questions!

409
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:16,133
Okay, Moonbole l'm very pleased.

410
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:19,136
Let her come from tomorrow
to teach Khalid Miya.

411
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:20,133
We take your leave now.

412
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,135
Please be seated. l have
called for Khalid Miya.

413
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:26,143
Let her meet her student.
Here he comes.

414
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:34,141
Come Phirangi Miya. - Good day to
you, grandfather. - God bless you.

415
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:38,152
She is your new teacher. Say
hello to her. - Hello.

416
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,158
Please come and sit here.

417
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:44,161
See Shabana, he's such a sweet boy.

418
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,159
You won't find such an innocent
boy in whole of Lucknow.

419
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,161
What happened?

420
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:50,163
l remembered a heart-piercing poem!

421
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:52,165
l really felt the
pricking of the poem!

422
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,170
Pricking poem? Let me hear
it too! - lt goes like..

423
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,179
Granddad, may l show my
study room to teacher?

424
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:06,183
Sure, and also show
her your study books.

425
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:08,181
Meanwhile l'll listen to his poems.

426
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,183
Please come teacher.

427
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:14,191
So, what were you saying? - Moobola.

428
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:18,195
What? - l mean this mouth opened..

429
00:45:18,396 --> 00:45:22,196
..when l opened it,
it said something.

430
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:26,203
Very good! Even this is good!

431
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:29,206
So, let me hear your poetry.

432
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:32,205
lt was a rainy night
when l first met her.

433
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,208
And we both were under
the same umbrella!

434
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:38,215
l'm sorry! My mistake!!

435
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,222
Welcome teacher, this
is my study room.

436
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:52,218
This is my study table, and this
is your chair and this is mine.

437
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:55,232
And he is my uncle. - Uncle!

438
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:10,238
Oh God! - Hello. - Please sit down.

439
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:14,251
l'm very ashamed of my
behaviour on that day.

440
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,249
lt was a very big mistake.

441
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:19,252
Uncle, if anyboby makes a
mistake he should catch his..

442
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:21,254
..ears and ask for forgiveness.

443
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:24,257
Yes, l must ask for forgiveness.

444
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,268
lt's good that you've
come to teach Phirangi.

445
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:36,262
l also got an opportunity to
ask for your forgiveness.

446
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:41,267
Phirangi is a very strange name.

447
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:43,276
We have nicknamed him because..

448
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:45,278
..he's fair like the British,
and he's also very naughty.

449
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,279
Why are you standing? Please
be seated. - Thank you.

450
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:03,300
Actually, l was very
worried for this boy.

451
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:05,298
l was thinking if l could get
a nice teacher for him..

452
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:10,296
Uncle, l have got this teacher
for me or for yourself? Get up.

453
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:14,311
You're very insolent.
- Thank you.

454
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,314
Phirangisaab, you mustn't talk
to elders in this manner.

455
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,318
Uncle isn't elder, he is my friend.

456
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:29,315
Teacher, please say something?
- Why? - Please say.

457
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:35,321
You're very sweet, Phirangi Miya. - Uncle,
her voice is just like you described it.

458
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:40,337
Be careful of him.
He is very naughty.

459
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:42,335
Do you know what he did
with his previous teacher?

460
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,338
He threw a mouse on her, and
out of fright she ran away.

461
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,345
Uncle, don't talk like this.

462
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:52,346
You had asked me to drive
her away. - l told you?

463
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:56,353
You're a big liar, Khalid Miya.
- Didn't you tell me,..

464
00:47:56,554 --> 00:48:00,354
..''drive the fat cat away, l'll
bring a goodlooking cat for you.''

465
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:06,352
Please go out. - Didn't you
say she has angelic eyes?

466
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:09,362
You're very naughty, Khalid Miya.
- Thank you.

467
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:12,369
l'm leaving now. My brother
must be waiting for me.

468
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:14,371
Please wait.

469
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:19,365
You're very naughty. You told
her everything. Good.

470
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:26,383
What happened? Did you
burn your hand?

471
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:29,386
Batur Miya, how many times
l've told you to see where..

472
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:31,384
..you're walking. You
have burnt her hands.

473
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:33,386
No! lt's not his fault.
l banged into him.

474
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:09,416
Hello, Miya. - Mamujaan.

475
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:17,434
Oh God! - Beti, you? - You?

476
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,437
l'm a servant here.
And what about you?

477
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:23,436
l'm also a servant here.
l come to teach the small boy.

478
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,443
Fate makes us meet often as..

479
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,442
..it's trying to bring
lost ones together.

480
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:33,450
Whenever l meet you,
l too feel the same.

481
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:38,455
Shabana, come soon.
l have to get myself slapped.

482
00:49:38,656 --> 00:49:39,452
What did you say?

483
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,459
l meant l have to attend a party
after l drop you home.

484
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:46,463
Okay, baba l'm going. - God bless you.

485
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,470
Come fast.

486
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:07,484
Mamujaan, who are you shooting?

487
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:10,483
Some betrayer. You've got
any objection? - Never.

488
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:12,485
That betrayer is very pretty.

489
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,487
You're calling my teacher a betrayer.

490
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:19,485
Wait, l'll go and tell granddad.
- Nanajaan.. - Wait one minute.

491
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:22,728
O beautiful girls in the
veil, please slap me!

492
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,738
l pray that God take care of
your hands and my teeth.

493
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:28,745
Turn and slap me in the name of God.

494
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:33,750
Friends, what do you have to say?

495
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:37,754
No it's not her. The sound
wasn't that loud. - We agree.

496
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:40,753
You're right, it wasn't
hard. Never mind.

497
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:46,752
O beautiful girl in the veil,
please slap me in the name of God.

498
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:50,764
l pray that God take care of
your hands and my teeth.

499
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:53,766
Turn and slap me in the name of God.

500
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:57,774
Rukhsana, give him a real hard
one in the name of God.

501
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,779
No friends, l think today
she has bunked college.

502
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:07,784
O beautiful girl in the veil,
please slap me in the name of God.

503
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,788
This is it. - The same sound.
- The same sound.

504
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:13,790
Did you recognize her?

505
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:17,794
My foot, l recognized her. She
had slapped me on that ..

506
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:18,791
..day too. But who is she?

507
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,793
She is Gulkand, daughter
of doctor Berbundli!

508
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:22,795
Gulkand! - Good, your life is made.

509
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:26,803
Now become a Majnu and
go to her house.

510
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,812
Laila! Where are you Laila?

511
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,816
Laila! Where are you? Speak
out, Laila where are you?

512
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,824
Oh Majnu! You seem to be very thirsty.

513
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:49,822
Come, let me quench your thirst.

514
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:54,820
Shameless! Aren't you ashamed
of spoiling a girl's reputation?

515
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:57,834
Take, drown yourself in this water.

516
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:03,840
l've drowned myself, now
atleast show your face.

517
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:09,835
You're craving a lot to
see my face. - See.

518
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,849
ls your heart wounded?

519
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,852
Perfectly aimed at my heart.

520
00:56:16,053 --> 00:56:18,851
Shameless creature!
Just look at his guts!?

521
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:26,852
Who are you?-By profession l'm a doctor and
by relation how is this girl related to you?

522
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:29,866
She is a piece of my heart.

523
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:31,864
And l'm the father of that piece.

524
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,865
What nonsense you're talking?
Good-bye.

525
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,870
Where are you going.
l think you're not well.

526
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,871
Come to my clinic.

527
00:56:39,076 --> 00:56:41,874
l'm perfectly alright. l think
your intention isn't good.

528
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,880
Don't doubt my intention. Come
inside and l'll make you alright.

529
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:55,881
' Bedard Clinic'? Do you treat
your patients cruelly?

530
00:56:56,093 --> 00:57:01,895
Come here. Show me your pulse.

531
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:04,901
Are you seeing my
pulse or those sticks?

532
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,904
l have kept it here for my support!

533
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:09,902
What's your problem?

534
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:13,907
l'm getting scared of you and
my sight is on this stick.

535
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,909
Son, you don't look at it.
You look at me.

536
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:19,912
Very smart. So when l look at you,
you will hit me with that stick!

537
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:23,917
Son, your problem isn't
external, it's internal.

538
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,919
l'll have to cleanse you from inside.

539
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,927
Daughter Gulkand, please bring
the cleansing medicine..

540
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,925
..and a glass from inside.

541
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:34,931
l'll bring it right away, daddy.

542
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:37,930
What's this cleansing
medicine like, doctor?

543
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:41,935
lt cleanses your intentions
alongwith your system.

544
00:57:42,973 --> 00:57:44,941
lt will remove the worms from
your stomach as well as your mind.

545
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:47,944
Doctor, l didn't understand properly.

546
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:51,948
Once you take a double dose
you will understand by yourself.

547
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:56,942
Daddy, take this. - Give . - Gulkand.

548
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:00,957
Take it, son, swallow this.

549
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:06,952
Doctor, if l don't take it
will you bash me up?

550
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:10,964
No, l will thrash you! - Like a
launderer? - You're very clever!

551
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:16,970
Open your mouth fast, and
swallow it. Drink this water.

552
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:22,968
Doctor, at least tell me
now what medicine was it.

553
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:28,974
This was a laxative.
- Laxative! l'm dead.

554
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:30,983
Tonga! Car!

555
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:36,982
Miyan, take this water, you
will need it on the way!

556
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:42,988
Why are you laughing?
Get in! Shameless!

557
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,002
This was the laxative.

558
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:21,037
You're smilling in your dreams..

559
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:25,041
Are you actually sleeping
or is it an excuse?

560
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:31,047
Hello. - Oh God! lt's you!

561
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:39,055
Brother isn't at home. l don't
know whether he has gone..

562
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:42,054
..to college, to the cinema,
or at your house!

563
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:44,056
l don't know where he is.

564
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:46,058
l haven't come to meet him.

565
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:48,060
l have come to meet you.

566
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:51,063
l've got ointment for your hands.
You had burnt your hands.

567
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,065
Please apply it,
they will be cured.

568
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,072
My hand is perfectly alright.
lt isn't burnt from anywhere.

569
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:02,067
Generally, burns are from within,
they don't show externally.

570
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:05,081
Apply it, the burning
sensation will go.

571
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:12,077
lt's all right now, but if you
insist then please apply it for me.

572
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:18,083
Me.. ointment.. burn.. please
apply it yourself.

573
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:29,094
What happened to you? Are you
dressed like this for that girl?

574
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,109
The road to love is
very unpredictable.

575
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:37,110
lt either leads you to the desert
or to the municipality.

576
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:38,110
Towards the municipality?

577
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:42,118
Are you drunk? l had
gone to the cleaners!

578
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,120
Where you get cleaned! l will
be right back! lt's the 20th time!

579
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:56,121
Baba, hello. - God bless you.

580
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,135
Have you started teaching the boy?

581
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:04,129
Yes, baba. l've got something
for you. Please take it.

582
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,138
What's this dear?

583
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:08,140
See it yourself. Good bye.

584
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:14,139
Listen dear, l've never asked
you, your name till now.

585
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:20,145
l like it very much when
you call me your child.

586
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,268
Khalidmiyan!

587
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:18,274
Your receipt. - My receipt!?

588
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:32,288
Love is a fire over which
there is no control.

589
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:41,297
Love is a fire over which
there is no control!

590
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:44,300
Uncle has asked you to
sign on the receipt first.

591
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:46,298
You will get your fees later.

592
01:03:47,337 --> 01:03:49,305
Your uncle is very strange!

593
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,303
He takes the receipt first
and then gives the fees.

594
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:54,310
Yes, he takes a kiss from me
first and then he gives me a chocolate.

595
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:57,313
You must be giving him
a lot of kisses?

596
01:03:57,514 --> 01:04:00,312
He took four kisses before
he gave me a train.

597
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:05,310
Take this and give it
to your uncle.

598
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:08,320
Tell him that l'll take my fees
first and then give the receipt.

599
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,322
May l play with my train?

600
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:12,324
Yes. l'll teach you a
lesson on the train.

601
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:20,492
The train comes whistling. lt
runs and makes a lot of noise.

602
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:24,503
lt halts at stations.
lt throws black smoke.

603
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:38,510
ls your habit of drinking water
in the night very old?

604
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:43,515
Yes, Khairoomiyan, it's a childhood
habit given by my mother.

605
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:48,527
She would say, ''Son, if you
drink water before going to bed..

606
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:51,529
..monsters will not come
in your dreams.''

607
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:56,528
Yes, they don't come in your dreams.

608
01:04:57,574 --> 01:04:58,541
What did you say?

609
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,538
That they may not come
in one's dream but..

610
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:04,543
..definitely they're around
when they're being talked about.

611
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:07,550
Uncle! -You were correct. See
here comes the devil.

612
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,547
Come.. come.. - Take your receipt.

613
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,558
What's this?
You didn't take her signature?

614
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:20,552
Teacher isn't like me. l kiss you
first and then take chocolates.

615
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:24,563
Teacher says she'll take fees
first and then give you a kiss.

616
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:26,564
What did you say?

617
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:29,567
First you give her the fees
then you'll get the receipt.

618
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:32,570
At least tell me how did you
find your new teacher?

619
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,578
Very good. Today she taught me a song.

620
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:37,575
Let me also listen to the song.

621
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:41,584
The train comes!

622
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:44,587
Phirangi Miya,come sit here.

623
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:50,582
lf l teach you a song will you
sing it to your teacher?

624
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:54,597
Yes.- The heart beats louder..

625
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:56,594
What is a heart uncle?

626
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:57,595
You ask too many questions.

627
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,600
Heart is like a train, which
does not require a ticket.

628
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,607
Really? - The heart
beats louder inside.

629
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:06,604
Maybe my heart craves for you.

630
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:10,613
Very good, uncle.
-Thank you. - Bless you.

631
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:16,619
The heart beats louder for you.

632
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:18,616
Maybe my heart is craving for you.

633
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,618
You mustn't sing a song like this,

634
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:23,621
Why teacher? - Who taught
you this? - Uncle.

635
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:25,623
Uncle says that heart
is like a train..

636
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:29,628
..which doesn't halt
at any station.

637
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:33,636
You tell your uncle not to
teach you such songs.

638
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:36,639
Why teacher? Uncle says,
this is a very nice train.

639
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:39,637
He says, we don't have
to buy a ticket for it.

640
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:41,639
Then what do we have to do?

641
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,641
Sign on the receipt. - Really?

642
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,643
That's why uncle had
sent you the receipt.

643
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:49,648
You're very naughty,
Phirangi Miya. Come lets go.

644
01:06:57,694 --> 01:06:59,662
Finished teaching Phirangi Miya? - Yes.

645
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:03,666
Come, l'll drop you home.
- Thank you.

646
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:11,674
You musn't teach kids such songs.

647
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:16,668
Songs like My heart
beats louder for you.

648
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:20,679
Maybe my heart craves
for you. lt's true.

649
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:23,686
You're very naughty..

650
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:27,690
What am l? - l don't know.

651
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:59,712
Granny. - What is it? Why are
you so quiet? Speak up.

652
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:01,719
Will you keep your
happiness to yourself?

653
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:03,726
My heart beats louder!

654
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:06,729
Maybe my heart craves for you!

655
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:09,732
What? - lt's true!

656
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:08,090
How long will this world live?

657
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,087
You will live as long
as the world lives!

658
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:13,090
Come in, come in.

659
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:20,102
lf the fool recognizes me, l'll
have to take the laxative again.

660
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,107
Change the direction of this stick.

661
01:14:26,142 --> 01:14:28,110
lt's pointing towards the hermits.

662
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,108
lt's better to throw it
away. Come inside.

663
01:14:36,152 --> 01:14:38,120
Please sit down.

664
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:45,127
God bless you, son!

665
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:48,130
O Sage, what will you like to drink?

666
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,127
l am fond of gulkand.

667
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:55,126
l have heard that a very good quality
of gulkand is available here.

668
01:14:55,337 --> 01:14:58,135
Yes. l'll give it to you right away.

669
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:03,134
No.. No not this one. This has been
prepared by your impure hands.

670
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:06,143
Dear hermit, this is the only
gulkand that l have.

671
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:14,153
Don't lie, you have that Gulkand
which the Lord has made himself!

672
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:18,160
Wow! You're a great hermit.

673
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,158
You went straight into my house.
Very good. Very good.

674
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,159
Gulkand, dear daughter Gulkand.
- Yes daddy. - Come fast.

675
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,167
Look hermit, Gulkand has come.

676
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:35,177
Wait! Where are you going?

677
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:40,178
You need not feel shy of him.
Go take his blessings.

678
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:50,182
Sit near me. Come close. This
is what l have come here for.

679
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:54,196
The angels have sent me
to fix your marriage.

680
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:57,199
l have chosen a boy for you.

681
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:00,202
His name is Moonbola.

682
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:02,199
Yes, l too know a Moonbola.

683
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:05,202
Daddy, the same boy who
came here as Romeo and..

684
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,204
..you made him swallow something.

685
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:09,206
This mean man gave him a laxative.

686
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:12,209
Good lord! You know everything.

687
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:17,215
Even l have a wish. l will
say it if you permit.

688
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:21,219
Sure, go ahead. - You please go inside.

689
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,229
Sage, since you have found a boy,..

690
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:30,227
..please find a girl too.

691
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:33,235
How are you talking to a hermit?

692
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,232
l am feeling very ticklish.

693
01:16:35,437 --> 01:16:37,234
l am not saying this for you.
l'm saying this for myself.

694
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:40,242
Oh! O.K.l will try to
fix you up also.

695
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:44,246
There is a widow in
Moonbola's family.

696
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:47,244
Let her be a widow as
long as she is good.

697
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:51,253
Granny! Granny.. Granny..

698
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:54,256
Shall l give you some good news?
- Tell me, son.

699
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:58,256
Sit down, granny. l have got
a very good proposal.

700
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:03,254
Proposal? l was going to ask
you to find a nice boy.

701
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:07,269
Before l die, l would like
to have my wish fulfilled.

702
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:11,269
Why are you talking of dying?
Granny,you are still very young.

703
01:17:12,308 --> 01:17:14,276
You are talking of marriage.

704
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:16,273
You'll be playing with small kids.

705
01:17:17,313 --> 01:17:19,281
Someday show me the boy.

706
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,278
Why? You don't trust my choice?

707
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:23,280
l'll get convinced if l see him once.

708
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,288
Granny, you'll get excited
when you see him.

709
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:33,295
Really! What's his age?
- Around 55-60.

710
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:37,299
What are you saying? 55-60!

711
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:40,302
Granny, you are also not 15-16.

712
01:17:40,502 --> 01:17:42,299
What nonsense! For whom have
you got the proposal?

713
01:17:42,504 --> 01:17:44,301
For you. Who else?

714
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:48,306
Shameless fellow! He's going to
get me married at this age.

715
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:52,310
l thought you got a proposal
for Shabana. Fool.

716
01:17:55,351 --> 01:18:05,317
Six. - Six on six. - Phirangi Miya,
you are winning a lot.

717
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:18,330
Six.. two.. queen.
- Where is my queen?

718
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,338
She's gone away. You are
cheating grandad?

719
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,341
So what happened teacher?
Grandad is also elder to me.

720
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:27,349
So does it mean that
you must cheat him?

721
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:29,346
Come on, get up and go to your room.

722
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:31,348
Teacher, have your tea while
l'll complete an important work.

723
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:33,355
What is the important
work that you have?

724
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,358
l have some private work with uncle.

725
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:39,361
Sit down dear.
Have your tea and go.

726
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:49,360
Nawabsahab, your tea.
- Khairu Miya, offer tea to Shabana first.

727
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:51,373
You please take first.

728
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:53,370
The tea will get
cold in this formality.

729
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:56,373
The rule in Bombay is
ladies first. Take it.

730
01:18:58,414 --> 01:19:01,383
You were studying in Bombay.
Am l right?

731
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:05,387
Yes. - Did your father
have any business in Bombay?

732
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:10,392
No. - Then what was he doing? Service?

733
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:15,386
Daddy.. l have never seen him.

734
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:19,401
He died when l was very small.

735
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:22,404
Mom got me educated.

736
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,408
Mom had told me that
my father is from this place.

737
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:31,402
From lucknow?
- He was a Nawab here.

738
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:33,410
Really! What was his name?

739
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:41,412
Hello.. who..
Oh! Vihar Mohan.

740
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:45,427
You've thought of me
after a very long time.

741
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:48,430
l've heard you're very
busy with the elections.

742
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:51,433
God willing you
will really win.

743
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,439
Promise to come
again sometime.

744
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:13,444
My heart says even
you're disturbed like me.

745
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:31,473
Where are you taking this paper?

746
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:34,471
Uncle had said that you
would surely write something.

747
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:37,479
He asked me to bring
the paper immediately to him.

748
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,476
No.. no, l have not written anything!

749
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:40,477
Give me the paper.

750
01:20:40,682 --> 01:20:42,479
You have written.
l'll give it to uncle.

751
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:46,484
Uncle. - What happened
Phirangi Miya? - Uncle.

752
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:57,499
Please return me
what l had written.

753
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:04,495
You're so close to me,
l can't see you!

754
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,509
Khalid Miya,
come on remove your books.

755
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:09,506
Let me finish listening
to the poetry.

756
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:12,509
l only feel you
like my belief!

757
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:15,517
Please repeat it again, uncle.

758
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:19,521
you're so close to me,
l can't see you!

759
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:22,519
l only feel you
like my belief!

760
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:26,528
Come on Khalid Miya.
You please leave.

761
01:21:26,728 --> 01:21:28,525
Let me teach the child!

762
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:33,524
Khalid Miya, we'll go to
the Gomti in the evening.

763
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:38,529
l'll not come. - Uncle isn't telling
you. He's telling me, teacher.

764
01:21:39,575 --> 01:21:40,542
Oh God!

765
01:21:41,577 --> 01:21:45,536
lf you don't want to go with
me then go with Phirangi.

766
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:03,565
One sweet kiss, too.

767
01:22:13,609 --> 01:22:17,568
Go slow. l'm a human being
and not a piece of furniture.

768
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:20,577
Doctor, l'm massaging
and not polishing.

769
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,586
lf l'll not massage you well
then how will you become..

770
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:26,583
..young in this old age?

771
01:22:26,788 --> 01:22:27,584
But brother, go slow.

772
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:30,592
Doctor. - What is it?
- A lady has come to see you.

773
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:34,596
Ask her what is her illness..

774
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:37,594
..and ask Gulkand to mix
the medicine in an empty bottle..

775
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:45,604
..and tell the patient to have it
three times a day every four hours.

776
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:50,601
Take Rs.2.50 from her and ask
her to come again the day after.

777
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:54,616
She isn't a patient.
She has come from Moonbola's house.

778
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,613
She is a widow.

779
01:22:58,654 --> 01:23:02,613
She's a widow! Ask her to sit.
l'm coming.

780
01:23:02,824 --> 01:23:07,625
And you take your things
and push off from here.

781
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:20,642
Please sit down. Doctor
will be here in a minute.

782
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:23,640
Listen. Where is my Gulkand?

783
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:24,641
l'll send her in a moment.

784
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:27,649
Look here. She has come.

785
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:31,653
l pray that may God take
care of your youth.

786
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:35,653
Come, dear, come in my arms.
lt will give peace.

787
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:43,654
l feel like taking
you home in my arms.

788
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:44,661
l don't know you.

789
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:48,666
Good if you had known
me there would be trouble.

790
01:23:49,705 --> 01:23:53,664
Meaning? - Meaning that l'm
going to become your stepmother.

791
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,673
Are you Moonbole's granny?

792
01:23:57,713 --> 01:23:59,681
Yes.My Moonbola adores you.

793
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:02,679
Whenever l speak,
he talks only about you.

794
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:06,684
For him l have come to
surrender my youth to your father.

795
01:24:08,724 --> 01:24:10,692
l say, you look very beautiful!

796
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:15,686
Atleast feel ashamed to
say this before your daughter!

797
01:24:15,897 --> 01:24:18,695
What are you doing
standing here? Go inside!

798
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:39,721
You too seem to be quite young!

799
01:24:40,756 --> 01:24:42,724
lt's my fate that l'm a widow.

800
01:24:42,924 --> 01:24:45,722
l'm only little older
than your daughter.

801
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:47,558
What are you saying?

802
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:50,561
My daughter is of the same
age as your Moobola.

803
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,569
Actually, you too don't look too old.

804
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,567
Only that you are shapeless.

805
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:58,569
What do you mean by shapeless?

806
01:24:58,774 --> 01:25:02,574
l mean, at some places you
are fat and at some ..

807
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:06,578
..you're thin and at some
you're.. Well never mind.

808
01:25:06,782 --> 01:25:09,580
What else can l expect in this age?

809
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:18,582
Ma'am, you have a masculine voice.
Never mind, it's very sexy.

810
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:23,587
Honestly, l am quite slim. lt's
for Gulkand that l've put on weight.

811
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:27,602
Get Gulkand married off soon
so that l can come here.

812
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:31,603
You come and get your
daughter married.

813
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:33,604
l will not take this risk.

814
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,611
First let Moobole get
married to Gulkand.

815
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:38,609
l'm giving this sacrifice for him.

816
01:25:39,648 --> 01:25:43,607
l wanted you to see me properly
so that you are assured.

817
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:47,619
My eyes are assured, now let
my heart be assured too.

818
01:25:48,657 --> 01:25:51,626
You please sit next to me so
that l can see you properly.

819
01:25:51,827 --> 01:25:54,625
lt is better to see from a distance.

820
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:57,628
You are inspecting in such a
manner, my limbs have gone numb.

821
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:03,627
May l leave? - Listen to me.
When am l going to see you again?

822
01:26:04,673 --> 01:26:06,641
How long will this waiting trouble me?

823
01:26:07,676 --> 01:26:09,644
Actually, even l will feel restless.

824
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:13,645
But what can l do? Your
daughter worries me a lot.

825
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:15,646
l am looking at you but my
concentration is always on her.

826
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:20,652
Don't worry, l will get Gulkand
married as soon as possible.

827
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:22,653
God wishing, you will
get married soon.

828
01:26:23,692 --> 01:26:29,653
l am? When are you going to marry me?

829
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:33,668
My walk is very graceful.

830
01:26:34,703 --> 01:26:38,662
Leave my delicate hands.
lf l'll fall, l'll sprain my legs.

831
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:40,671
You're going darling mom?

832
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:42,673
Just say darling.

833
01:26:45,714 --> 01:26:47,682
Dad will remove the life out
of me if he knows this.

834
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:48,679
Just let the marriage
ceremony be completed.

835
01:26:48,884 --> 01:26:49,680
What do you mean?

836
01:26:49,885 --> 01:26:51,682
Means when you will
exposed of this act.

837
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:53,684
You think l haven't recognized you?

838
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,686
What an act you have put
on of being your granny.

839
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:56,687
Remove all this.

840
01:26:56,892 --> 01:27:00,692
What all l have become in your love.

841
01:27:00,896 --> 01:27:03,694
Sometimes Romeo, sometimes granny,
and sometimes the hermit.

842
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:05,696
Oh God! You had come
dressed like the hermit!

843
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:07,698
Who else, your father?

844
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:09,700
Daughter Gulkand! - God this
is your grace.

845
01:27:18,747 --> 01:27:25,710
l've never seen this kind
of love from a stepmother.

846
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:29,724
Gulkand has got so rosy cheeks.

847
01:27:30,759 --> 01:27:33,728
When she comes in my arms,
it gives me a lot of relief.

848
01:27:34,763 --> 01:27:38,722
Very good. You've already
won Gulkand's heart.

849
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:41,736
lt's because of my youth!

850
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:45,737
Why only Gulkand, her father too
has been won over by my youth.

851
01:27:47,776 --> 01:27:51,735
The sage must be really great that
he gave me this priceless gift!

852
01:27:57,786 --> 01:28:01,745
Shabana. - Yes. - l .. l..

853
01:28:01,957 --> 01:28:05,757
..l want some help from you.

854
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:08,763
How can l help you?

855
01:28:08,964 --> 01:28:11,762
lt's very simple. There is a
music competion in my college.

856
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:17,761
You're a very good poet.
Please help.

857
01:28:17,973 --> 01:28:20,771
Who told you that l'm a good poet?

858
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:25,769
l can simply tell what is inside
the letter by looking at it!

859
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:29,784
And what if the letter
tells about the courier?

860
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:33,788
Uncle, what do you
mean by a courier?

861
01:28:34,823 --> 01:28:37,792
A courier is a postman and
that's what you're. Naughty boy.

862
01:28:37,993 --> 01:28:40,791
You do your work and don't
pay attention to our talks.

863
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:43,798
Sorry, uncle.

864
01:28:43,999 --> 01:28:46,797
So tell me, will you help?

865
01:28:47,836 --> 01:28:50,805
l'll try. Tell me from where
do want me to help you?

866
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,809
What one says from the eyes
should now say it with the lips.

867
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:59,803
Why do you want it to loose its
charm? Some say with eyes ..

868
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:02,813
.. and some with lips.

869
01:29:03,852 --> 01:29:06,821
Great! You've replied
to me very smartly.

870
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:09,824
What? Replied? Meaning?

871
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:12,823
l used a poem to tell
you about my feelings.

872
01:29:13,028 --> 01:29:15,826
You came and l couldn't
even say anything.

873
01:29:16,031 --> 01:29:18,829
What one is saying with the
eyes may one day please..

874
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:19,830
..say it with it's lips.

875
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:21,832
Uncle, she isn't going to
be trapped in this manner.

876
01:29:22,037 --> 01:29:23,834
What nonsense you are
talking, naughty fellow.

877
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:26,837
See for yourself. The fish
keeps escaping everytime.

878
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:29,840
Come on, fix the bait. - Thank you
uncle. - God bless you.

879
01:29:45,894 --> 01:29:51,855
mething to me? - No.

880
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:51,155
Shabana. - Yes. - l want to
make you my wife.

881
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,167
Oh God!

882
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:57,171
Uncle, what does wife mean?

883
01:34:58,206 --> 01:35:01,175
Umm, wife means..

884
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,173
Teacher you tell me.

885
01:35:03,378 --> 01:35:05,175
Tell him. The child is asking you.

886
01:35:06,214 --> 01:35:10,173
Phirangi Miyan, wife means.. wife.

887
01:35:19,227 --> 01:35:23,186
Grandad, l want to make you my wife.

888
01:35:24,232 --> 01:35:26,200
What do you want to make me?

889
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:30,201
Wife. - Phirangi Miyan from
where have you learnt this?

890
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:35,198
Uncle told my teacher that,
''l want to make you my wife.''

891
01:35:36,244 --> 01:35:41,204
Oh.. Then what did your teacher say?

892
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,218
Nothing, she did this.

893
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:48,222
Do you know the meaning
of wife? - What's it?

894
01:35:49,257 --> 01:35:54,217
lt means that your uncle wants
to make your teacher your aunt.

895
01:35:55,263 --> 01:35:57,231
My aunt! But how?
- By getting married.

896
01:35:58,266 --> 01:36:02,225
Your uncle's wife will be
your aunty. Understood.

897
01:36:03,271 --> 01:36:06,240
Now l understood. l'll take
care of my friend now.

898
01:36:08,276 --> 01:36:10,244
l've understood your prank!

899
01:36:10,445 --> 01:36:12,242
What did you understand?

900
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:14,244
You want to make my teacher your wife.

901
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:16,246
You're very naughty.
What are you saying?

902
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:19,253
l have asked grandad
what a wife means.

903
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:21,255
What did you ask?

904
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:27,250
l told grandad that my uncle wants
to make my teacher his wife.

905
01:36:27,462 --> 01:36:28,258
What did daddy say?

906
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:31,261
Grandad said that you want to
get married to my teacher..

907
01:36:31,466 --> 01:36:33,263
.. and make her your wife.

908
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:39,262
Naughty fellow. You told
him everything! Very good.

909
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:42,276
Very good. You'd never have said this.

910
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:44,274
No.. no daddy. He's very naughty.

911
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:46,276
Yes, he is naughty, but hasn't
he spoken the truth?

912
01:36:47,315 --> 01:36:50,284
Say something. Now why are
you feeling nervous?

913
01:36:50,485 --> 01:36:52,282
Grandad, l'll tell you
all that he was saying.

914
01:36:54,322 --> 01:36:58,281
Yusuf, l'm proud of your choice.

Really! l'll get you

Aunty! - What sort of joke is this?

918
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:18,308
From today you're not
my teacher but my aunty.

919
01:37:18,513 --> 01:37:21,311
ls this a new joke that
your uncle has taught you?

920
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:23,317
Uncle hasn't said anything.

921
01:37:23,518 --> 01:37:26,316
Grandad is getting you married.

922
01:37:27,355 --> 01:37:31,314
Married! To whom? - Not
with me. With uncle.

923
01:37:31,526 --> 01:37:33,323

Caught you. - Leave me,
or l'll tell uncle.

925

Tell him that l won't
get married to him.

l'll get married to you!
- l'm very small!

927
01:37:49,377 --> 01:37:51,345
You're a big naughty fellow.

928
01:37:53,381 --> 01:37:56,350
Khairoo Miya has come!

929
01:37:56,551 --> 01:37:58,348
Tell me what news of
our romantic hero.

930

Granny, why are you so shocked?

Splendid!! Great!!

932

Uncle, teacher doesn't wish
to marry you. - Really!

940
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:04,414
She wants to marry me.

941

Oh! who told you this?

942
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:08,418
Your wife. She wasn't
leaving me at all.

943
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:10,420
She kissed me here, here and here.

944
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:12,422
She kissed you here too. - Yes.
- She kissed you here? - Yes.

Let me see where she had kissed you.

949
01:39:23,638 --> 01:39:25,435
Let me see. Let me see.

950
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:28,442
Shabana, congratulations
on your engagement.

951
01:39:29,477 --> 01:39:34,437
This is done. But still there is
no sign of the color of his love!

952
01:39:37,485 --> 01:39:40,454
They had sent henna for her!
Where's it?

953
01:39:41,489 --> 01:39:43,457
Take this, the beloved's henna.

954

01:39:47,495 --> 01:39:49,463
Yes. Your beloved's henna!

.. of your beloved's henna never
fade away from your hands!

..who my father was? Who my
mother was? Where l lived?

970
01:46:00,034 --> 01:46:02,832
Where's my maternal house?

971
01:46:03,871 --> 01:46:05,839

There is one, why else would
God make me meet you?

983
01:47:06,934 --> 01:47:10,893
Just like your pure heart, God

l'm leaving Lucknow.

988
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:40,930
Baba, why are you leaving Lucknow?

989
01:47:46,974 --> 01:47:52,935
l couldn't complete the motive
for which l had come here.

990
01:47:53,981 --> 01:47:58,941
Maybe it wasn't God's wish.
l've given up.

991
01:48:00,988 --> 01:48:06,949
Only if God wishes our
wishes get fulfilled.

992
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:27,970
Before leaving, l wanted
to embrace you.

993
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:44,998
ls there any letter for Yusuf Miya?

994
01:48:46,033 --> 01:48:49,992
lf you don't mind,
please deliver it to him.

995
01:48:50,204 --> 01:48:53,002
Sure! Goodbye!

996
01:49:05,052 --> 01:49:06,019
Goodbye.

997
01:49:07,054 --> 01:49:09,022
Sir. - What's it accountant?

998
01:49:09,223 --> 01:49:12,021
While cleaning the attic
l found this picture.

999
01:49:12,226 --> 01:49:14,023
lf it's any of your ancestors's,
l'll get a new frame made..

1000
01:49:14,228 --> 01:49:16,025
.. and get it put up on the wall.

1001
01:49:16,063 --> 01:49:16,859
Let me see.

1002
01:49:21,902 --> 01:49:23,870
This fellow is still in this house?

1003
01:49:24,905 --> 01:49:26,873
By now there should be no traces of
his grave too. Throw it away.

1004
01:49:47,928 --> 01:49:49,896
Why are you worshipping this
wicked fellow?

1005
01:49:50,097 --> 01:49:51,894
He isn't any of my ancestors.

1006
01:49:55,936 --> 01:50:00,896
Khairu Miya, throw this wicked
fellow in some dirty sewage.

1007
01:50:01,942 --> 01:50:03,910
Couldn't find this fellow's body.
Or l would have thrown too.

1008
01:50:20,961 --> 01:50:24,920
Anwar Kamaal is alive, Safdarjung.

1009
01:50:25,132 --> 01:50:26,929
He'll take his revenge.

1010
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,949
Anwar kamaal is alive, Safdarjung.

1011
01:50:43,984 --> 01:50:45,952
He'll take his revenge.

1012
01:51:05,005 --> 01:51:09,965
Give this glass of water to me.
l'll keep it.

1013
01:51:52,052 --> 01:51:57,012
Khairoo Miya!
- Yes.

1014
01:51:57,224 --> 01:51:59,021
What's happening?

1015
01:52:01,061 --> 01:52:04,030
Nothing. l'm doing my duty.

1016
01:52:08,068 --> 01:52:12,027
ln the name of duty, you have
showered a lot of love on us.

1017
01:52:13,073 --> 01:52:15,041
How will we ever repay your
love and affection?

1018
01:52:16,076 --> 01:52:19,045
Yusuf Miya, only you have given me
love and affection.

1019
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,048
So much love that l forget about
myself.

1020
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:27,042
Who am l? From where have l come?
What have l to do?

1021
01:52:29,089 --> 01:52:33,048
But when l'm myself, l think of
doing my duty.

1022
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:43,069
We too have some duty towards you.

1023
01:52:45,105 --> 01:52:47,073
You consider Shabana as your
daughter.

1024
01:52:48,108 --> 01:52:50,076
She also calls you baba.

1025
01:52:50,277 --> 01:52:56,079
Father and l have decided that you
will stay like us in this house.

1026
01:52:57,117 --> 01:52:59,085
From tomorrow, you won't have to do
all this.

1027
01:52:59,286 --> 01:53:01,083
Yusuf Miya, who has seen tomorrow.

1028
01:53:02,122 --> 01:53:04,090
lt's great if the present moment
passes well.

1029
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:07,093
Thank you for considering me
for this priviledge.

1030
01:53:08,128 --> 01:53:10,096
May God..

1031
01:53:12,132 --> 01:53:15,101
Your good wishes are always with me.

1032
01:53:15,302 --> 01:53:18,100
That's why a girl like Shabana is
becoming my wife.

1033
01:53:18,305 --> 01:53:20,102
l'm very lucky.

1034
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:23,109
We can't go against our destiny.

1035
01:53:24,144 --> 01:53:26,112
l take your leave sir.

1036
01:53:28,148 --> 01:53:31,117
Khairu Miya, if l'm not troubling
you...

1037
01:53:31,318 --> 01:53:33,115
..please wake me up at 6 a.m.

1038
01:53:35,155 --> 01:53:37,123
Tomorrow?
- Why?

1039
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:43,118
No - Nothing. l was just wondering
what if l don't..

1040
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:44,126
..wake up in the morning.

1041
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:46,128
Never mind. l'll set the alarm.

1042
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:25,160
Dear Nawab, by poisoning Yusuf
l've taken my revenge.

1043
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:32,167
l wanted you to go through the same
death that you've given me.

1044
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:38,173
You've forgotten. But l will never
forget my misfortune.

1045
01:54:39,219 --> 01:54:43,178
l'll remind you who l am.

1046
01:54:45,225 --> 01:54:48,194
Tell me. Who are you? How did you
enter without my permission.

1047
01:54:48,395 --> 01:54:49,191
But who ..

1048
01:54:49,396 --> 01:54:52,194
We tried to stop him a lot but he
pushed us and entered.

1049
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:53,195
Shut up!

1050
01:54:54,234 --> 01:54:57,203
Who are all these? Who are you?
Where's daddy?

1051
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:04,199
Who daddy? Are you Anwar Kamaal,
son of Sajjad Hussein?

1052
01:55:05,245 --> 01:55:07,213
Yes. l'm Nawab Sajjad
Hussein's son!

1053
01:55:08,248 --> 01:55:14,209
Oh, please sit down.
- Sit.

1054
01:55:17,257 --> 01:55:20,226
Though l've never seen you,
l'd heard a lot about you.

1055
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:23,229
l'm Haiderjung's son,
Safdarjung.

1056
01:55:24,264 --> 01:55:27,233
l have heard your name
before.

1057
01:55:28,268 --> 01:55:30,236
Unfortunately, l had
never met you.

1058
01:55:30,437 --> 01:55:32,234
The circumstances under which we
met is more unfortunate.

1059
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:35,237
You have come home thinking
it to be your home..

1060
01:55:35,442 --> 01:55:41,244
..but unfortunately, it's no
longer your home.

1061
01:55:42,282 --> 01:55:44,250
Yesterday morning, your father
auctioned this house..

1062
01:55:44,451 --> 01:55:45,247
.. to repay his debts.

1063
01:55:45,452 --> 01:55:48,250
Auctioned! To repay debts?

1064
01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:50,256
Whose debts?

1065
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:53,259
You maybe be knowing that,
about 7 -8 years ago ..

1066
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:57,260
..your father had made a huge loss
in a business dealing.

1067
01:55:58,298 --> 01:56:01,267
At that time my father had helped
him with a huge amount.

1068
01:56:02,302 --> 01:56:05,271
Yes, l know. - Your father had given
10 lacs.

1069
01:56:05,472 --> 01:56:06,268
Yes, that's right.

1070
01:56:07,307 --> 01:56:09,275
l used to be in Nainital most of
the time.

1071
01:56:09,476 --> 01:56:12,274
But since father has expired,
l've taken over the business.

1072
01:56:13,313 --> 01:56:15,281
l've recovered the amount from
Mr.Sajjad.

1073
01:56:15,482 --> 01:56:17,279
But daddy had returned the money
in instalments.

1074
01:56:18,318 --> 01:56:21,287
l've myself given 20-40 thousand
to your father.

1075
01:56:22,322 --> 01:56:25,291
Anwar Kamaal, this isn't a
child's play.

1076
01:56:25,492 --> 01:56:27,289
That l'll believe you've paid
the amount.

1077
01:56:28,328 --> 01:56:31,297
lf the amount was returned,
it should either have been ..

1078
01:56:31,498 --> 01:56:33,295
.. deposited in our bank account..

1079
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,297
.. or you should have had it's
receipt!

1080
01:56:36,336 --> 01:56:39,305
You're lying! Safdarjung,
you're cheating!

1081
01:56:39,506 --> 01:56:42,304
Anwar Kamaal, right now you're not
in your house..

1082
01:56:42,509 --> 01:56:44,306
.. but in my house!

1083
01:56:45,345 --> 01:56:50,305
lf l desire l can get you thrown out,
but l'm respecting you.

1084
01:56:51,351 --> 01:56:54,320
You're a fraud, cheater and a
selfish person!

1085
01:56:55,355 --> 01:56:57,323
Anwar! Think what you say..

1086
01:56:57,524 --> 01:56:59,321
..l'll strip you of your skin and
have it auctioned too!.

1087
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,327
You don't know me!

1088
01:57:01,528 --> 01:57:04,326
Now l know. You'll regret knowing
me.

1089
01:57:04,531 --> 01:57:06,328
Get out of here! Your cheater
father too, ..

1090
01:57:06,533 --> 01:57:08,330
.. had threatened before leaving.

1091
01:57:08,535 --> 01:57:10,332
How dare you use any filthy
language for my father!

1092
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:11,333
Get lost!

1093
01:57:11,538 --> 01:57:13,335
Tell me where my father is!

1094
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,337
He must be lying in some dirty
drain! Go find him!

1095
01:57:15,542 --> 01:57:16,338
Bastard!

1096
01:57:22,382 --> 01:57:25,351
You bastard! l'll take my revenge!

1097
01:57:29,389 --> 01:57:32,358
My father departed from this life
without fulfilling his desire ..

1098
01:57:32,559 --> 01:57:38,361
.. of taking revenge. His final
words always echo in my ears.

1099
01:57:39,399 --> 01:57:43,358
Anwar Kamaal is alive. Anwar Kamaal
will take revenge.

1100
01:57:44,404 --> 01:57:46,372
Today, l've taken that revenge.

1101
01:57:47,407 --> 01:57:50,376
Just the way l lived in grief..

1102
01:57:50,577 --> 01:57:57,380
..you too, will grieve for your son
for the rest of your life.

1103
01:58:51,471 --> 01:58:54,440
Mother's name was Najma!

1104
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:02,448
Anwar Kamaal was my father!

1105
01:59:06,486 --> 01:59:09,455
l'm a prostitute's daughter!

1106
01:59:36,516 --> 01:59:39,485
Oh God! What have you done!

1107
01:59:46,526 --> 01:59:49,495
Yusuf! Yusuf!!

1108
02:00:36,576 --> 02:00:43,539
God! When has one denied your
favours?

1109
02:01:04,604 --> 02:01:10,565
Baba. - Daughter.- Has the Jr. Nawab
read my letter?

1110
02:01:11,611 --> 02:01:19,575
Daughter, please forgive me!
l'm your sinner! Please forgive me!

1111
02:01:27,627 --> 02:01:31,586
What happened baba? Why are you
crying like this?

1112
02:01:32,632 --> 02:01:40,596
Please forgive me! l've read your
letter! l'm a sinner!

1113
02:01:42,642 --> 02:01:48,603
When l was read about your past,
l felt it was my story.

1114
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:56,611
How did you go through all the
sorrow?

1115
02:02:02,662 --> 02:02:06,621
We have to go through all that is
in our destiny, baba!

1116
02:02:07,667 --> 02:02:09,635
That's why l had sent the letter!

1117
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:13,639
l would have known what my fate
decided for me!

1118
02:02:14,674 --> 02:02:18,633
lf you treat me like your father,
then will you do what l say?

1119
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:20,646
What Baba?

1120
02:02:21,681 --> 02:02:25,640
Your getting married to such a
nice man, is also your destiny.

1121
02:02:26,686 --> 02:02:30,645
Promise me that you will not spoil
your destiny.

1122
02:02:30,857 --> 02:02:33,655
You will never tell anything to
Yusuf.

1123
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:37,660
Tomorrow, what if he knows who my
mother was?

1124
02:02:38,698 --> 02:02:41,667
Yusuf is getting married to you
because he loves you.

1125
02:02:41,868 --> 02:02:44,666
He doesn't need to know your
mother's past.

1126
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:47,669
What right does a prostitute's
daughter have to tarnish the ..

1127
02:02:47,874 --> 02:02:50,672
..reputation of such a nice family?

1128
02:02:50,877 --> 02:02:52,674
The world will never forgive them.

1129
02:02:52,879 --> 02:02:55,677
What right did the world have,
when it tarnished Najma's image?

1130
02:02:55,882 --> 02:02:59,682
Why, was she so helpless that she
could not lead a repectable life?

1131
02:02:59,886 --> 02:03:01,683
Why did the world push her into
a brothel?

1132
02:03:02,722 --> 02:03:05,691
This world is deaf and blind!

1133
02:03:06,726 --> 02:03:08,694
lt doesn't understand one's
circumstances!

1134
02:03:09,729 --> 02:03:11,697
lt doesn't listen to one's complaints.

1135
02:03:11,898 --> 02:03:13,695
Just as nobody could understand your
mother's helplessness..

1136
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:16,698
..nobody will understand yours.

1137
02:03:17,737 --> 02:03:21,696
Man can't decide what is good
and what is bad.

1138
02:03:21,908 --> 02:03:24,706
Leave it for God to decide.

1139
02:03:25,745 --> 02:03:28,714
lt's a good thing that you've read
my letter, Baba.

1140
02:03:29,749 --> 02:03:32,718
Atleast l could share my sorrow
with you.

1141
02:03:32,919 --> 02:03:34,716
The burden on my chest is reduced.

1142
02:03:35,755 --> 02:03:38,724
Beti, promise you will not tell
anybody anything.

1143
02:03:39,759 --> 02:03:41,727
Now l won't tell anybody anything,
Baba.

1144
02:03:42,762 --> 02:03:46,721
The person to whom l wanted to tell,
has already understood everything.

1145
02:03:47,767 --> 02:03:49,735
May you prosper, Beti.

1146
02:03:54,774 --> 02:03:57,743
Sir. - Nawab has
called for you.

1147
02:03:58,778 --> 02:04:00,746
Rehman.
- Yes Sir.

1148
02:04:01,781 --> 02:04:04,750
Last night Khairoo Miya had kept
a glass of water in my table.

1149
02:04:04,951 --> 02:04:06,748
Did you take it away?
- No Sir.

1150
02:04:07,787 --> 02:04:09,755
He kept it right in front of my eyes.
Call Khairoo Miya.

1151
02:04:09,956 --> 02:04:12,754
He's not at home. Even his room is
locked since morning.

1152
02:04:13,793 --> 02:04:14,760
O.K.

1153
02:04:15,795 --> 02:04:17,763
Bhabhi, tell me, what do you want
to order?

1154
02:04:18,798 --> 02:04:21,767
What can l say? l don't know about
today's fashions.

1155
02:04:22,802 --> 02:04:26,761
During our times, one would see that
jewellery is big and heavy.

1156
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:29,771
Bhabhi, that is no longer in fashion
and nor is it the law.

1157
02:04:29,976 --> 02:04:31,773
Now, the govrnment too does not
permit to keep lot of gold.

1158
02:04:32,812 --> 02:04:34,780
Then Miya, send Shabana
to his shop.

1159
02:04:34,981 --> 02:04:36,778
She will choose the jewellery
herself.

1160
02:04:37,817 --> 02:04:39,785
Goodday auntie.
- Bless you.

1161
02:04:39,986 --> 02:04:41,783
Goodday auntie.
- Bless you.

1162
02:04:41,988 --> 02:04:44,786
Yusuf Miya, do one thing.
Take Shabana to Parsuram's shop.

1163
02:04:44,991 --> 02:04:46,788
Let her decide what jewellry
she wants.

1164
02:04:46,993 --> 02:04:49,791
Me.. me.. - Yes why not?
- Me.. me..

1165
02:04:49,996 --> 02:04:51,793
This boy is getting
very embarrased.

1166
02:04:51,998 --> 02:04:53,795
lf you want to feel so shy,
wear my veil and go with Shabana.

1167
02:04:54,834 --> 02:04:59,794
Listen Yusuf Miya. We have to
change with the new generation.

1168
02:05:00,006 --> 02:05:01,803
Just as you have chosen your wife,
now let Shabana ..

1169
02:05:02,008 --> 02:05:03,805
..choose the jewellery of her choice.

1170
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:05,807
l'll see Daddy. l've to go to college.

1171
02:05:08,848 --> 02:05:11,817
See, l listened to you and went to
that doctor disguised as granny.

1172
02:05:12,852 --> 02:05:16,811
O.K. - And the old man also got ready
to get Gulkand married. - O.K.

1173
02:05:18,858 --> 02:05:20,826
Now l'll have to marry twice.

1174
02:05:21,027 --> 02:05:23,825
Once with Gulkand, and the other
with that old man.

1175
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,832
O.K. - What O.K.? lt's not O.K.

1176
02:05:27,033 --> 02:05:28,830
Who will l live with? With Gulkand
or with the old man?

1177
02:05:29,035 --> 02:05:30,832
With the old man.

1178
02:05:31,871 --> 02:05:33,839
Listen to her. First she put a noose
around my neck and ..

1179
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:35,837
.. she's making fun of me.

1180
02:05:36,042 --> 02:05:37,839
Show me a way to come out of this
mess.

1181
02:05:38,878 --> 02:05:40,846
Then brother, for three days you live
with Gulkand and..

1182
02:05:41,047 --> 02:05:42,844
.. three days with the old man.

1183
02:05:43,049 --> 02:05:44,846
You don't understand anything.

1184
02:05:45,051 --> 02:05:46,848
lt's not safe to live with the doctor
for even a single day.

1185
02:05:47,887 --> 02:05:49,855
The moment l'm exposed, my hair
will be in his hands ..

1186
02:05:50,056 --> 02:05:50,852
.. l'll be out of the house.

1187
02:05:51,891 --> 02:05:54,860
That's what we want. After that, where
will he take his daughter back?

1188
02:05:55,895 --> 02:05:59,854
That's right. By God's swear,
you're a genius.

1189
02:06:00,066 --> 02:06:02,864
Hello Mr. Farhad, when did you come?

1190
02:06:05,905 --> 02:06:10,865
Go Miya, you go too. - l've your
permission? - Most welcome.

1191
02:06:11,911 --> 02:06:13,879
Go and impress her! - Thank you!

1192
02:06:29,929 --> 02:06:32,898
Let me have this spectacle
sometimes..

1193
02:06:33,933 --> 02:06:36,902
..Let me unveil your face.

1194
02:06:37,937 --> 02:06:39,905
lf this Moon is unveiled..

1195
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:43,909
..l'll give a call to the dark
clouds!

1196
02:11:24,223 --> 02:11:27,192
How coy my bride is!

1197
02:11:30,229 --> 02:11:34,188
Okay, so he is your brother,
what job can he do?

1198
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:39,201
He can do anything.
He has got degrees.

1199
02:11:39,405 --> 02:11:41,202
Okay, take him to the
accountant..

1200
02:11:41,407 --> 02:11:43,204
..and ask him to replace him
with Khairu.

1201
02:11:43,242 --> 02:11:46,040
Thank you very much, Sir - Thank you
for the favor.

1202
02:11:59,091 --> 02:12:02,060
Greetings! - Greetings! Yes,
whom do you want to see?

1203
02:12:02,261 --> 02:12:06,061
The granny of Moobole,
who is a widow but a beauty.

1204
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:10,068
Why do you want to meet her?

1205
02:12:10,269 --> 02:12:12,066
Tell her that a heart-broken person
has come today, he has..

1206
02:12:12,271 --> 02:12:14,068
..come to his father-in-law's place,
if l could just meet her..

1207
02:12:14,273 --> 02:12:18,073
..just speak something to her,
my heart would be satisfied..

1208
02:12:18,277 --> 02:12:22,077
..or else l would go breathless.
- And your legs dangling in grave!

1209
02:12:23,115 --> 02:12:26,084
Miyan! You're a very shameless
person, shame on love and..

1210
02:12:26,285 --> 02:12:29,083
..that too in this old age.
- Who are you? Granny's sister?

1211
02:12:29,288 --> 02:12:33,088
Sister, no, l'm your mother-in-law.
- Please don't get angry,

1212
02:12:33,292 --> 02:12:36,090
l'm sad, if tears flow from my eyes
and roll down..

1213
02:12:36,295 --> 02:12:43,098
..will she see my lost beauty or
tears flowing down my face?

1214
02:12:43,302 --> 02:12:47,102
l've come to confess my crime to
you, l've come to marry her today!

1215
02:12:51,143 --> 02:12:54,112
Father, - Yes dear, l've come to
meet your mother.

1216
02:12:58,150 --> 02:13:02,109
Who? Okay, you've come to see our
granny who is a widow?

1217
02:13:03,155 --> 02:13:05,123
Oh! She left for Kashmir today
itself.

1218
02:13:05,324 --> 02:13:07,121
What? She went all alone without me?

1219
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:12,119
Let that brat come, just see how l
shut his mouth!

1220
02:13:12,331 --> 02:13:14,128
Now first granny will come and only
then will Gulkand go!

1221
02:13:15,167 --> 02:13:17,135
Come on! - Oh! Doctor, have some
patience.

1222
02:13:17,336 --> 02:13:19,133
l've had enough patience.

1223
02:13:19,338 --> 02:13:21,135
l've been waiting here peeling
groundnuts..

1224
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,137
..and she's gone to Kashmir to
eat apples!

1225
02:13:23,342 --> 02:13:25,139
No problem, she will
come back soon.

1226
02:13:25,344 --> 02:13:27,141
Listen, whenever she comes, tell her
that the doctor has..

1227
02:13:27,346 --> 02:13:28,142
..taken back his prescription.

1228
02:13:28,347 --> 02:13:30,144
Come on! l'm sorry, Greetings!
Come on.

1229
02:13:33,185 --> 02:13:36,154
Oh no! Doctor, what is this?

1230
02:13:37,189 --> 02:13:40,158
l gave them an excuse and went to
stay at your place.

1231
02:13:41,193 --> 02:13:43,161
But when l went there, l found
the house locked!

1232
02:13:44,196 --> 02:13:46,164
But darling, it was a matter of
life & death here!

1233
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:49,167
Please have some patience doctor!

1234
02:13:51,203 --> 02:13:53,171
Who is this girl?

1235
02:13:53,372 --> 02:13:55,169
So sister, how do you find the
groom?

1236
02:13:55,374 --> 02:13:57,171
Won't we make a nice pair?

1237
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:02,169
Hello! Dear Shabana, how are you?

1238
02:14:02,381 --> 02:14:07,182
Oh yes! l met Yusufmiyan on the way.
He was asking about you.

1239
02:14:10,222 --> 02:14:13,191
Oh! Doctor, why are you panting?

1240
02:14:13,392 --> 02:14:15,189
How should l tell you, darling?

1241
02:14:15,394 --> 02:14:17,191
Separation was suffocating me like
anything.

1242
02:14:17,396 --> 02:14:19,193
l was losing everything thinking
about you.

1243
02:14:19,398 --> 02:14:22,196
l could not control myself and
could not remove this obstacle.

1244
02:14:22,401 --> 02:14:26,201
ln this confusion,
l ran like hell.

1245
02:14:27,239 --> 02:14:29,207
Don't tell me, Oh! Sister,

1246
02:14:29,408 --> 02:14:31,205
.. you must have even not
asked him for water!

1247
02:14:32,244 --> 02:14:34,212
Water?! Now l'm going to ask you
about yourself, you rascal!

1248
02:14:34,413 --> 02:14:37,211
is all this? - Fashion!
Oh no! Granny, what's this?

1249
02:14:37,416 --> 02:14:39,213
You've spoilt an entire set,
give me back my property.

1250
02:14:40,252 --> 02:14:45,212
l'll give it to you right now, take
this! - Please forgive him.

1251
02:14:46,258 --> 02:14:49,227
This donkey has created a scene.
Just get aside..

1252
02:14:49,428 --> 02:14:50,224
..wait till l get you.

1253
02:14:50,429 --> 02:14:54,229
Bloody! Ditcher! Now let me see
how you marry Gulkand.

1254
02:14:54,433 --> 02:14:56,230
Come on, Come on l said!

1255
02:14:56,435 --> 02:14:58,232
Please leave me papa, please.

1256
02:15:00,272 --> 02:15:03,241
Doctor! You're taking away
your daughter.

1257
02:15:03,442 --> 02:15:06,240
What about me? - Now,
what's wrong with you?

1258
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:11,249
Sir, l've fallen in love with you.

1259
02:15:12,284 --> 02:15:17,244
The moment you glanced at me.
- Granny! - Children, ..

1260
02:15:17,456 --> 02:15:20,254
..nothing can stop one
from falling in love...

1261
02:15:20,459 --> 02:15:26,261
lt can neither be made to happen
nor can it be suppressed.

1262
02:15:26,465 --> 02:15:29,263
Wait! Have patience, l'm not going
to be ditched this time.

1263
02:15:35,307 --> 02:15:39,266
Moobole, l hope this isn't
your elder brother?

1264
02:15:40,312 --> 02:15:42,280
She's really genuine. Check her
if you want!

1265
02:15:44,316 --> 02:15:49,276
You're my Noorjahan and also my
world, you're my beloved..

1266
02:15:49,488 --> 02:15:52,286
..and also the mother
of my dear one.

1267
02:15:52,491 --> 02:15:54,288
You're anyway taking away
my child.

1268
02:15:54,493 --> 02:15:58,293
Damn it! Who am l to separate
the child from it's mother?

1269
02:15:59,331 --> 02:16:01,299
From now onwards Gulkand will stay
here, with her mother.

1270
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:04,302
And now l take your leave..
Greetings!

1271
02:16:04,503 --> 02:16:06,300
But yes, l hope you remember
the condition,..

1272
02:16:06,505 --> 02:16:10,305
.. once Gulkand gets married,
it's our turn.

1273
02:16:10,509 --> 02:16:12,306
Greetings! Greetings!

1274
02:16:19,351 --> 02:16:22,320
Oh! Granny, Come on, that was
truly romantic.

1275
02:16:22,521 --> 02:16:24,318
Move aside, l handled it this time
but henceforth you'll..

1276
02:16:24,523 --> 02:16:25,319
..have to take care of it.

1277
02:16:26,358 --> 02:16:28,326
What?! You mean to say whatever
you did was mere acting?

1278
02:16:28,527 --> 02:16:32,327
Oh yes! l'm going to win this year's
Filmfare Award for best acting.

1279
02:16:33,365 --> 02:16:35,333
Very well! Why are we here then?

1280
02:17:23,415 --> 02:17:27,374
Hello! Recite your peotry to us!
- Sure, why not?

1281
02:17:30,422 --> 02:17:34,381
Please take this knife - Why? Did
you recall something touchy?

1282
02:17:36,428 --> 02:17:38,396
Yes! l fear, it was
something like that.

1283
02:17:38,597 --> 02:17:39,393
Come on, let's see our groom.

1284
02:17:39,598 --> 02:17:44,399
Yes, as if nobody's seen, - lt's not
like that, he is the chosen one!

1285
02:18:21,473 --> 02:18:26,433
Shabana. - Nissar?! - Thank God,
you recognised me!

1286
02:18:27,479 --> 02:18:29,447
Otherwise who remembers near ones
once he holds..

1287
02:18:29,648 --> 02:18:32,446
..a status in the society.l know,
that unfortunate old lady ..

1288
02:18:32,651 --> 02:18:35,449
..mislead you but you're not
such a girl.l know you from..

1289
02:18:35,654 --> 02:18:39,454
..the beginning.But that old lady
turned out to be smart.

1290
02:18:40,492 --> 02:18:43,461
She's trapped a rich guy, she has
secured her old age.

1291
02:18:44,496 --> 02:18:46,464
Even the rich guy won't have
any doubts about you

1292
02:18:46,665 --> 02:18:48,462
.. , like who you're and where
you've come from.

1293
02:18:49,501 --> 02:18:53,460
You! What have you come here for?
- l've come to take..

1294
02:18:53,672 --> 02:18:56,470
..you, my darling. l think
this is the best time.

1295
02:18:57,509 --> 02:19:00,478
These jewels you're wearing
are more than enough.

1296
02:19:00,679 --> 02:19:05,480
Cover it and move out with me.
We can live happily everafter.

1297
02:19:06,518 --> 02:19:09,487
Nissar, have mercy on me, for
God's sake, please go away!

1298
02:19:10,522 --> 02:19:13,491
Don't ruin my life. - You've
always misunderstood me.

1299
02:19:13,692 --> 02:19:15,489
Shabana. l never wanted to ruin you,
l wanted you to..

1300
02:19:15,694 --> 02:19:18,492
..prosper at the brothel but you
weren't ready..

1301
02:19:18,697 --> 02:19:22,497
Now you want to make your life in
this palace, your wish!

1302
02:19:22,701 --> 02:19:25,499
When you prosper will it be good
for me, else how will..

1303
02:19:25,704 --> 02:19:28,502
..l spend my days?
- What?

1304
02:19:28,707 --> 02:19:31,505
What do you mean by that?
What do want to say?

1305
02:19:32,544 --> 02:19:34,512
The debt, the money l spent to look
after your mother and..

1306
02:19:34,713 --> 02:19:37,511
..also in bringing you up
and the interest..

1307
02:19:37,716 --> 02:19:40,514
..you can pay me
by satisfying me.

1308
02:19:43,555 --> 02:19:47,514
l beg of you, Nissar, please
spare me, please forgive me..

1309
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:55,523
..l beg for my life, l beg of you
for my husband.

1310
02:19:56,568 --> 02:19:58,536
Please don't ruin me!

1311
02:19:58,737 --> 02:20:01,535
..l'm not forcing you, if you don't
wish to go, don't go!

1312
02:20:06,578 --> 02:20:12,539
Just handover these jewels and some
1000-1500 rupees..

1313
02:20:12,751 --> 02:20:16,551
..every month, enough! Now you'll
have no difficulty in..

1314
02:20:16,755 --> 02:20:21,556
..repaying your mother's debt and also
for me to collect it.

1315
02:20:22,594 --> 02:20:24,562
You know something, Shabana,
l'm a servant at..

1316
02:20:24,763 --> 02:20:28,563
..your father-in-law's place and will
always be close to you.

1317
02:20:30,602 --> 02:20:33,571
These tears flowing
down your cheeks!

1318
02:20:34,606 --> 02:20:39,566
l've seen dew drops dancing
over fire.. Wow!

1319
02:20:40,612 --> 02:20:47,575
By God, you're looking gorgeous!
l feel like tasting these tears!

1320
02:20:51,623 --> 02:20:56,583
So your arrogance isn't over yet.
Your mother made you a..

1321
02:20:56,795 --> 02:20:59,593
..prostitute and you're trying
to be an angel?!

1322
02:21:00,632 --> 02:21:03,601
So let me break your illusion
that you're a virgin.

1323
02:21:04,636 --> 02:21:07,605
Let me fulfill myself
before you meet Yusuf!

1324
02:21:34,666 --> 02:21:36,634
Now run! Where will you go?

1325
02:22:00,692 --> 02:22:06,653
Bravo! There's nothing more
beautiful than the Moon!

1326
02:22:09,701 --> 02:22:14,661
One day your mother had also
surrendered herself to me.

1327
02:22:16,708 --> 02:22:20,667
You mean! Wicked! lf you
step ahead, l'll shoot you!

1328
02:22:21,713 --> 02:22:26,673
l know these hands decorated
with henna cannot shoot.

1329
02:22:26,885 --> 02:22:31,686
Nissar, l mean it! Go away, or l'll
shoot! - Go ahead, shoot!

1330
02:22:35,727 --> 02:22:41,688
You cruel! You shot me!
You really shot me!

1331
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:04,711
Baba, l've murdered him, l've
killed Nissar, Baba!

1332
02:23:05,757 --> 02:23:09,716
Swear on your mother. Don't tell
it dear, don't tell who he..

1333
02:23:09,928 --> 02:23:11,725
..was, how he was related
to your mother!

1334
02:23:12,764 --> 02:23:16,723
Najma was disgraced a lot in her life.
Let her soul rest in peace!

1335
02:23:18,770 --> 02:23:20,738
People should not come to know
that your mother was a..

1336
02:23:20,939 --> 02:23:22,736
..prostitute, a dancer.!

1337
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:44,751
Khairumiyan, You, Shabana,
Usman?!

1338
02:23:45,797 --> 02:23:48,766
Yes, Yusufmiyan, he was
my companion.

1339
02:23:50,802 --> 02:23:56,763
He wanted to have the whole loot
so l killed him! - Baba!.

1340
02:23:57,809 --> 02:24:00,778
This is true, l was caught
before trying to steal.

1341
02:24:00,979 --> 02:24:03,777
Yusufmiyan knows that. l had
sent Usman for the job..

1342
02:24:03,982 --> 02:24:07,782
..so that he can await
a nice opportunity!

1343
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,788
But, today when there was such
a golden opportunity..

1344
02:24:10,989 --> 02:24:13,787
..he didn't even inform me.

1345
02:24:13,992 --> 02:24:16,790
He didn't have a fair intention.
He wanted the whole loot for..

1346
02:24:16,995 --> 02:24:19,793
..himself. l finished him off.

1347
02:24:22,834 --> 02:24:26,793
Lady, can you tell what Khairu
& Usman spoke about..

1348
02:24:27,005 --> 02:24:28,802
..before the shot was fired?

1349
02:24:29,007 --> 02:24:30,804
And how the fight started?

1350
02:24:31,009 --> 02:24:34,809
There was no fight
between them because..

1351
02:24:35,013 --> 02:24:38,813
..the shot was fired
before Khairumiyan came!

1352
02:24:39,851 --> 02:24:42,820
Lady, what do you want to say?
What do you mean?

1353
02:24:43,855 --> 02:24:47,814
l mean, he was not killed by
Khairumiyan but by me.

1354
02:24:48,026 --> 02:24:52,827
This is a lie! this is false, this
girl is wrong! l killed him!

1355
02:25:03,875 --> 02:25:05,843
No, Mr.Dutt, this murder has been
committed by Khairumiyan..

1356
02:25:06,044 --> 02:25:06,840
..and not Shabana.

1357
02:25:07,045 --> 02:25:09,843
Shabana is taking the blame
on herself..

1358
02:25:10,048 --> 02:25:11,845
..just because Khairumiyan
saved her dignity.

1359
02:25:12,050 --> 02:25:15,850
And she cannot see the person whom she
is grateful to being hanged!

1360
02:25:16,888 --> 02:25:19,857
This act proves Shabana's honesty..

1361
02:25:20,058 --> 02:25:21,855
..and does not make her a criminal.

1362
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:23,857
But Shabana's statement proves her
to be the criminal.

1363
02:25:24,062 --> 02:25:25,859
So, doesn't Khairu's statement
prove him guilty?..

1364
02:25:26,898 --> 02:25:28,866
He has also confessed to his crime.

1365
02:25:29,901 --> 02:25:31,869
And everybody has seen Khairumiyan
firing the shots..

1366
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:33,867
..and not Shabana.

1367
02:25:34,906 --> 02:25:36,874
Khairumiyan has committed
the murder.

1368
02:25:37,075 --> 02:25:38,872
He had also twice attempted
to murder me.

1369
02:25:39,911 --> 02:25:43,870
But why? What for? Mr.Dutt!

1370
02:25:44,082 --> 02:25:47,882
lt's true that the first time when he
entered the house at night..

1371
02:25:48,086 --> 02:25:50,884
..he climbed on a pipe but was
caught in Yusuf Nawab's bed-room!

1372
02:25:51,089 --> 02:25:52,886
He had a sharp knife in his hand..

1373
02:25:53,091 --> 02:25:54,888
and pretended he had come
to steal.

1374
02:25:55,927 --> 02:25:57,895
Nawab showed mercy on him and
took him as an employee.

1375
02:25:58,096 --> 02:25:59,893
But never had Yusuf Nawab
thought that..

1376
02:26:00,098 --> 02:26:04,899
..he had come to his bedroom not
to steal but to murder him.

1377
02:26:05,937 --> 02:26:07,905
Does the criminal disagree
with this incident?

1378
02:26:13,945 --> 02:26:16,914
l confess it
- Baba!

1379
02:26:17,949 --> 02:26:21,908
During his period of work he made
a mark for himself at home!

1380
02:26:22,954 --> 02:26:24,922
He gained Yusuf Nawab's
confidence!

1381
02:26:25,957 --> 02:26:27,925
He became familiar
with his habits!

1382
02:26:28,126 --> 02:26:30,924
He came to know that Yusuf Nawab
had the habit..

1383
02:26:31,129 --> 02:26:32,926
..of getting up at night
and having water!

1384
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:35,929
He had even uttered this
to Yusuf Nawab and then..

1385
02:26:36,134 --> 02:26:39,934
..one night before placing a glass
of water beside his bed..

1386
02:26:40,138 --> 02:26:42,936
..he mixed poison in it!
He tried to kill him again!

1387
02:26:43,975 --> 02:26:45,943
Does the criminal
deny this incident?

1388
02:26:46,978 --> 02:26:49,947
No! l confess this also.

1389
02:26:50,982 --> 02:26:54,941
Can l know why the criminal had to
always attack Yusuf Nawab?

1390
02:26:55,987 --> 02:26:58,956
What was this enmity all about for which
he was trying to take revenge?

1391
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:05,952
This is my personal matter. l refuse
to tell it to the Court.

1392
02:27:06,164 --> 02:27:09,964
Which means he is trying to hide
his past criminal life!

1393
02:27:16,007 --> 02:27:20,967
My Lord! lf permitted,
Mr.Yusuf would like to..

1394
02:27:21,179 --> 02:27:23,977
..say something about this case.
- Permission granted.

1395
02:27:35,026 --> 02:27:39,986
Your Honour! This incident
of murder not only involves..

1396
02:27:40,198 --> 02:27:43,998
..Khairumiyan and Shabana, but
also a few more big people.

1397
02:27:45,036 --> 02:27:48,005
Which involves the most
important & special name..

1398
02:27:48,206 --> 02:27:52,006
..of my father,
Nawab Safdarjung.

1399
02:27:54,045 --> 02:27:56,013
What?!

1400
02:27:57,048 --> 02:27:59,016
Usman's murder isn't
a stray incident..

1401
02:27:59,217 --> 02:28:03,176
..but behind it lies a chain
of incidents.

1402
02:28:04,222 --> 02:28:06,190
one end of which is connected
to Usman's dead..

1403
02:28:06,391 --> 02:28:08,188
..body and the other end of
which connects to..

1404
02:28:08,393 --> 02:28:10,190
..Nawab Safdarjung's home.

1405
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:18,191
His cottage, where Nawab Sajjad
Hussain stayed before him.

1406
02:28:19,237 --> 02:28:22,206
Nawab Sajjad Hussain was indebted
to my father.

1407
02:28:23,241 --> 02:28:26,210
When he could not clear the debts
my father took legal..

1408
02:28:26,411 --> 02:28:29,209
..action and made him leave
the cottage.

1409
02:28:29,414 --> 02:28:31,211
Made him homeless.

1410
02:28:32,250 --> 02:28:35,219
Nobody can make out who was true
and who was false..

1411
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:37,217
..in that incident which took place
18 years ago.

1412
02:28:40,258 --> 02:28:43,227
But the Court decision
still lies on paper.

1413
02:28:44,262 --> 02:28:47,231
Nawab Sajjad Hussain got the shock
of his life after that..

1414
02:28:47,432 --> 02:28:51,232
..incident and he lost
his mental balance.

1415
02:28:52,270 --> 02:28:55,239
With a mood of revenge on his mind,
he finally faced death.

1416
02:28:56,274 --> 02:29:01,234
His son, Nawab Anwar Kamaal
had stayed with him..

1417
02:29:01,446 --> 02:29:04,244
..for a few months and in such a
situation he couldn't even..

1418
02:29:04,449 --> 02:29:07,247
..tell his father that he had
secretly married a girl..

1419
02:29:07,452 --> 02:29:09,249
..named Najma at Delhi.

1420
02:29:10,288 --> 02:29:13,257
After the death of his father
when Anwar Kamaal ..

1421
02:29:13,458 --> 02:29:16,256
..came back to his wife at Delhi
he found that Najma's..

1422
02:29:16,461 --> 02:29:18,258
..step-uncle had made her leave
the home.

1423
02:29:19,297 --> 02:29:22,266
He thought that Najma was going to be
a mother of an illegitimate child.

1424
02:29:23,301 --> 02:29:25,269
Anwar Kamaal couldn't control
his sorrow and anger.

1425
02:29:26,304 --> 02:29:31,264
He killed Najma's uncle and was
sentenced to life imprisonment!

1426
02:29:32,310 --> 02:29:35,279
Najma, left homeless and aimless
was found wandering..

1427
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:40,281
..by a trader and fetter,
whose name was Nissar Ahmed.

1428
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:44,288
Nissar took Najma to Hyderabad
and forced her..

1429
02:29:44,489 --> 02:29:47,287
..into a brothel. She was
compelled to do it!

1430
02:29:47,492 --> 02:29:52,293
Najma accepted this situation
but on one condition..

1431
02:29:52,497 --> 02:29:56,297
..that Nawab Anwar Kamaal's
legal heir, his daughter..

1432
02:29:56,501 --> 02:29:59,299
..will be kept away from
this place by Nissar..

1433
02:29:59,504 --> 02:30:05,306
..and will never let her know that
her mother was a prostitute.

1434
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:09,310
Keeping her daughter away from
herself, Najma educated..

1435
02:30:09,514 --> 02:30:13,314
..her, raised her and taught
her good things.

1436
02:30:13,518 --> 02:30:15,315
But when she started
to lose her charm..

1437
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:20,321
..Nissar tried to bring her daughter
into the same brothel.

1438
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:24,328
Najma could not take it
and committed suicide.

1439
02:30:24,529 --> 02:30:27,327
Nissar felt that things had
become easier for him.

1440
02:30:28,366 --> 02:30:32,325
But Najma's daughter ran off from
Nissar's trap with her old maid.

1441
02:30:34,372 --> 02:30:38,331
After sometime her life again took
a turn. Within a year..

1442
02:30:38,543 --> 02:30:41,341
..her marriage was fixed in
a good family.

1443
02:30:43,381 --> 02:30:47,340
She didn't disclose her past.
She didn't utter about it.

1444
02:30:48,386 --> 02:30:50,354
But right on the occasion of her
marriage Nissar came there..

1445
02:30:50,555 --> 02:30:53,353
..and threatened that he will
expose the secret..

1446
02:30:53,558 --> 02:30:56,356
..stole her jewellery, tried
to spoil her dignity!

1447
02:30:58,396 --> 02:31:07,361
The girl killed him with his own
pistol and that girl is, Shabana.

1448
02:31:07,572 --> 02:31:10,370
Tell me, where is Anwar Kamaal?
Where is my father?

1449
02:31:11,409 --> 02:31:14,378
When you know all this you must
surely be knowing..

1450
02:31:14,579 --> 02:31:18,379
..where my father is!
Where is my father?

1451
02:31:20,418 --> 02:31:23,387
Nawab Anwar Kamaal is none other
than the one you call..

1452
02:31:23,588 --> 02:31:33,395
..Baba and we all know him
as Khairumiyan. - Baba!

1453
02:31:36,434 --> 02:31:39,403
Respected Judge, l found these 2
letters from Khairumiyan's room.

1454
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:43,407
These are the pieces of the letter
that Shabana had..

1455
02:31:43,608 --> 02:31:48,409
..written to me and the other one
written to my father by Khairumiyan.

1456
02:31:49,447 --> 02:31:52,416
These are the proofs to testify
my statement.

1457
02:31:57,455 --> 02:31:59,423
Mr.Groom, Why are you feeling
so shy?

1458
02:32:00,458 --> 02:32:02,426
He knows that he is going to
lose today.

1459
02:32:03,461 --> 02:32:05,429
Anyway nowadays the college
is having holidays..

1460
02:32:05,630 --> 02:32:08,428
l know all that. - Anyway,
you will come to know about it.

1461
02:32:31,489 --> 02:32:33,457
God! How lucky l am!

1462
02:32:38,496 --> 02:32:41,465
Madam, why are you
so scared of me?

1463
02:32:45,503 --> 02:32:47,471
l don't trust you!

1464
02:33:13,531 --> 02:33:16,500
Dear uncle, what does
a veil mean?
