2
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:21,882
Where is it?

3
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,519
Here you go

4
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,323
Yeah, we're on our way, OK?

5
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,198
They won't wait

6
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,083
Alright, man! You're a good driver!

7
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:49,761
As the 1999 Cricket World Cup plays on,
from the Asian teams, only Pakistan remains

8
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,604
So how much cash have you wasted?

9
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:52,636
1 5,000

10
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,319
15,000?

11
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,447
You told me five!

12
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,280
Yeah, five on Sri Lanka,
five on lndia and five on Pakistan

13
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:04,958
You're crazy, man!

14
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:06,918
You're not even into cricket!

15
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,799
l'm into money though, ain't l?

16
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,717
- You paid the bookie?
- Nope

17
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,518
When Pakistan win, l'll pay him

18
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,684
Who is it?

19
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,683
lt's us. Open the door

20
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,565
l'm coming

21
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:50,124
You just clean the place?

22
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,163
My name's Ash. This is Sunny

23
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,840
They call me Scorpion

24
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,718
What's this?

25
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,677
l know it's a gun.
What do you need this for?

26
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,362
- Give it back!
- Chill

27
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,443
- How's it going?
- Scorpion

28
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,159
- Scorpion. And your surname?
- Just Scorpion, OK?

29
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,726
- Shall we start business?
- Let me check it first

30
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,837
- What for?
- For the purity

31
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,523
Fuck 'purity', get the cash out

32
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:30,522
Point it down

33
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,122
Where you from?

34
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,763
- You ever bought any gear before?
- Bought loads

35
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,476
- OK?
- No, it's not OK

36
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,322
lt's OK

37
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,116
No

38
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:05,955
lt's different
from what l tried before

39
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,998
l'll give you 450

40
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,676
lt's worth 500

41
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,323
Wait!

42
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,123
What you doing?
lt's good dope, buy it

43
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,920
l've only got 450

44
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:33,801
- lt's 500. He needs 500...
- l ain't got any more than that!

45
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,438
He ain't got more than 450

46
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,236
The gear's worth 500

47
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,038
We didn't come to listen to your shit

48
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,964
Have you got the 450 on you?

49
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,843
Pass me a paper

50
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,798
What you doing?

51
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,637
What are you doing?

52
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,487
Watch carefully

53
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,398
This is 450

54
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,516
That ain't 450!

55
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:14,036
- That's not worth 450
- Pass the 450

56
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,998
Give him the 450

57
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,117
l said give him the 450!

58
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,236
ls it for me?

59
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:10,883
How are you, Kabir?

60
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:12,796
What do you think?

61
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:17,443
l think it's big!

62
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,203
What are you gonna do with it?

63
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:27,159
l'll keep it with me
when you're not around

64
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,438
lt takes up too much space

65
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,443
ln future,
you'll have to pay me more...

66
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,362
...if you want to store
your stuff here

67
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,965
- What do you mean?
- No space

68
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,999
Celina, this girl who works
at the club with me...

69
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,685
...just got 4 years, solitary...

70
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:03,606
...for storing gear for some white guy

71
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,598
Hello? ls anybody there?

72
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,125
King, quiet! Come here!

73
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,157
Ask him nicely,
then maybe he'll come

74
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,684
Shall we give her an extra hundred?

75
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:30,360
We'll call it 200, OK?

76
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,120
So you two still doing the biz?

77
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,876
Me and Anita?
l check her occasionally

78
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,805
ls she 'the woman' or what?

79
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,678
l don't want a whore for my woman

80
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,647
- ls she wild?
- Yeah, she's pretty wild

81
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:56,481
- Does she moan a lot?
- l ain't telling you if she moans

82
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,204
You love her big time, man

83
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,203
You do, or you wouldn't
hold that shit back

84
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,923
What? Just cos l won't
tell you if she moans?

85
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,758
Shall l tell you who moans?

86
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,763
Celine. No, no, Nicki!

87
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:14,676
No. Sushmita!

88
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,638
Anita's friend!

89
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,444
- She was your girlfriend, wasn't she?
- They both were, man!

90
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:24,196
That's true pleasure in life;
two girls at one time

91
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,122
You ever try it?

92
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,964
What?

93
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,807
- Two girls at one time
- Of course l have

94
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,684
Who?

95
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,683
Don't lie, man. Who?

96
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,607
Your mother and your father

97
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,404
Cheeky fucker!

98
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,482
Y'bastard!

99
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,203
l really enjoyed it!

100
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,915
Yeah, l bet he grabbed it
and did you from behind!

101
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,158
Dam Square,
where you went last time?

102
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,959
Yes

103
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:20,807
Make sure you check the gear
and money in front of him

104
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:22,843
200 grams white. Here's 4,000

105
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,603
Get the gear before you pay him

106
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,365
- Anything else?
- Just my money

107
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,238
When you come back

108
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:35,240
- Huh?
- When you come back

109
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,238
Salim, l urgently need it now

110
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:39,958
l can't do it now

111
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,844
Forget it, l'll get someone else

112
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,843
l definitely must have it
when l come back

113
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,797
On Friday

114
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,598
Yeah, you go first

115
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:52,602
Don't forget!

116
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:11,716
This is Rachel

117
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,400
Why d'you put this lemon
in my drink, man?

118
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,245
Man, don't put your dirty fingers
in my drink!

119
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,523
Oi! Someone said hi to us!

120
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,246
l saw you on the dance floor

121
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,238
What's your name?

122
00:11:58,727 --> 00:11:59,796
So you from out of town?

123
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,684
Why? Does it look like that?

124
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,683
No, just never seen you here before

125
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,322
So where you from?

126
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,164
l thought you'd say Green Street

127
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,883
What are you drinking?

128
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,645
- Why don't you drink Tuborg?
- Don't like it

129
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:31,362
Man, it's a real cheap way
of getting drunk!

130
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,204
l don't come out to get drunk

131
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,999
Do you love me?

132
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,038
He's asking if you love him!

133
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:50,606
She popped you one!
She popped you one!

134
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,518
Listen, man, she hit me not you

135
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,438
And listen, she hits
harder than you as well!

136
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,324
Beautifully said, darling,
now come here!

137
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,917
Hello, it's me.
l didn't wake you, did l?

138
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:36,642
No, it's alright

139
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:40,600
That guy who stares at me from
the opposite flat is at it again

140
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:44,280
The bastard's at his window

141
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,319
What shall l do?
Shall l throw a bottle at him?

142
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:52,167
Try it. lf it doesn't work, call me

143
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,886
What if the freak gets angry?

144
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,918
Stick King on him

145
00:13:58,687 --> 00:13:59,756
Salim...

146
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,677
l'll sort him out, but not today

147
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,563
l know you, you're not going
to do anything...

148
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,318
...except doss around
with Kabir all day

149
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,085
l'll see you later, Anita

150
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:17,166
What you lost is down
to this patriotic bollocks

151
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,036
Didn't use your head

152
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:23,717
Leave the original money on Pakistan
and add another 4,000 each

153
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,637
But Pakistan lost to Bangladesh,
they're newcomers

154
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:33,406
They lost on purpose,
it was a tactical loss

155
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:38,123
So these bloated white guys
get lazy and pissed...

156
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,125
...and lose the game cos
they thought Pakistan were shit

157
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,044
Now let's do some business

158
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,723
OK, place the bet

159
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,565
Don't worry, it's a good bet

160
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,242
They agree?

161
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,960
OK, Singh. Tell him to put
another 20 on Pakistan. All of it

162
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,726
And what about the previous debt?

163
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,565
l'll settle up after the final

164
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,603
There's some guy outside
asking for you...

165
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,399
Hang on

166
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:25,321
This guy's a real low-life -
l don't like dealing with him

167
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:29,038
l'm sure. You place the bet

168
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,759
Some Scot...

169
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,876
Some spot?

170
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,645
Not a spot, a Scot

171
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:40,676
What's he say?

172
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,442
Dunno

173
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,279
- Where is he?
- Outside

174
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,998
lt seems you don't recognise me

175
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,559
You should recognise me, Salim

176
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,317
We were inside together 4 years
back in Manchester

177
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,316
You've grown your hair?

178
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,915
So can you help me out then?

179
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,844
Where'd you hear about me?

180

185
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:44,842
Can't do it. l need at least
2 or 3 days. Call me

Look, think about it. l can give you

00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:06,996
Come on, man, £60 a gram

00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,487
Sallu

197
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,364
You gotta try this

198
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,238
l made it myself

199
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,205
Made it yourself?. Tumbe?

200
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:50,158
Tolumbe!

201
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:54,996

203
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,679
Salim, man, just taste it.
Taste it

204
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,604
Shall l try any one?

205
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,399
This one here

206
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,324
lt's real tasty

207
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,196
What do you think?

208
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,883
Shall l teach you how to make it?

209
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:22,839
You can learn it too,
it's a real easy recipe, mate

210
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:29,565
Two cups of milk, two cups water,
add some oil, and then boil it

211
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:34,442
- l wanted to talk to you
- Six cups of flour into water, yeah?

212
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,084
That's it. Come on

213
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,083
Then fry it,
just like with French fries

214
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:53,518
You wanted to talk

215
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,240
- A guy from Scotland
- What guy from Scotland?

216
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:02,126
l met this Scottish guy,
he needs some gear

217
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:05,084
400 grams

218
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,883
He needs it tomorrow

219
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:13,560
400 grams, and tomorrow as well!

220
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,647
A little short notice, isn't it?

221
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:19,525
- What's the plan?
- l'll come here tomorrow...

222
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,159
...take the dope,
go down there, do the deal...

223
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,247
...and come straight back here
with the cash

224
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,126
Sallu, you still owe me
6,000 from last time

225
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,840
You're my friend,
but you owe me money

226
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:40,481
And you haven't brought it, have you?
lt's a problem, yeah?

227
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,323
- No?
- lt's no problem, you can just...

228
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:49,121
Sallu, you took it on credit.
You took credit

229
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:53,001
Said you would sell it,
and come straight back with the cash

230
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:54,964
Problem now, isn't it?

231
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,805
Sallu, you're my friend, it's alright

232
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,446
But now you come back
wanting another 400 grams

233
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,443
400 grams

234
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:09,398
That's quite a lot, isn't it?

235
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,035
lt's a big amount
but it's a good deal

236
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,759
OK. The gear'll be here
at noon tomorrow

237
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:53,596
Listen, Sallu

238
00:20:55,367 --> 00:21:00,236
Promise me you'll be right back here
afterwards with the money

239
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,078
And it's £50 a gram

240
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,798
- 40
- 50

241
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:14,646
For credit, it's 50,
and the previous 6?

242
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:17,437
Next week

243
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:22,201
l've got some gear and cash coming.
l'll pay you next week

244
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,407
And so?

245
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,238
'And so' what?

246
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,924
ls it a deal?

247
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,764
lt's a deal

248
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,842
OK

249
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:40,607
l bought this fridge for my daughter.
lt's a brand-new model!

250
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,484
lt's nice. Nice!

251
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:46,287
Not just nice.
lt's a fridge and a freezer

252
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:47,356
lt's nice

253
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,159
Hey, Davar, look,
l'll marry your daughter

254
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,918
You can forget about that 6,000

255
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,845
- Call it a dowry
- Careful, Salim

256
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,798
Oh, you rascal!

257
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,525
Listen, will you help us move it?

258
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,443
And don't damage the floor, yeah?

259
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,004
This is Joe

260
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,799
He's with me

261
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,917
l can get the gear,
but for 70 a gram

262
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:25,683
But we agreed 60

263
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,438
We discussed it,
we didn't agree

264
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:34,280
Let's just call it 65

265
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,120
70. lt's quality gear

266
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,998
Can l taste a sample?

267
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:42,003
That makes it 28,000

268
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:46,720
Kabir, give me a sample
of the brown, man

269
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,600
Man, you only just gave it to me

270
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,605
You know the car park
behind the supermarket?

271
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,484
You know it?

272
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:18,360
We'll be there tomorrow at two

273
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:31,960
Greetings, Mr Davar!
lt's 12 o'clock!

274
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,767
Sallu, you've arrived, my friend!

275
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,644
Grab a seat

276
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:39,679
Salim, my cousin Khan, from Denmark

277
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,478
Khan, my friend Salim

278
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:45,436
You want to eat some cake?

279
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:50,035
Nope, l tried it yesterday.
Tastes like shit

280
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:53,875
Keep the guy away from the kitchen,
he can't cook

281
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,918
His mum cooks great food

282
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:59,680
Lovely food at his house

283
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,325
- Thank you kindly, sir
- We'll meet in a little while

284
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,399
- Yep, 2 or 3 o'clock
- Sallu, be careful, yeah?

285
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,603
- What time is it?
- 1 ;30

286
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,326
Why did we need to get here so early?

287
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:32,402
ls it early?

288
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:35,200
We got half an hour till the meeting

289
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,040
What shall we do tonight?

290
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,965
Think of something.
Want to see a film?

291
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:45,963
Waste of money. Watch it on video

292
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,598
Man, you get thick watching videos

293
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,607
l went with a girl to the cinema
once...

294
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,563
...to watch a blue movie

295
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:00,206
- What happened?
- She ran off

296
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:03,998
So what do we do tonight?

297
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,884
l'm going to the video shop, man

298
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,798
How's Anita?

299
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,679
Anita and me,
we're not as close as you think

300
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:21,275
What do you mean?
She gives you love, doesn't she?

301
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,319
When you're paying for it,
what's the point of love?

302
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,244
What, she asks for money?

303
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,082
No, man!

304
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:32,801
l remember the first time
she was lying there stoned

305
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:37,640
But no...l couldn't do it

306
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:41,559
l don't mind. lt doesn't bother me

307
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:47,201
l kicked the shit out of one
of her customers once

308
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,247
Why?

309
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:52,035
l saw her coming out of some building

310
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,920
Some guy comes out 2 minutes later

311
00:25:56,967 --> 00:26:01,722
So l follow him in the car,
to the toilets up near the church

312
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:06,486
He's standing there taking a piss
and l say to him...

313
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:12,237
''With a face like that, you shouldn't
have aspirations for a girl like her''

314
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,164
Aspirations? OK!

315
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,086
He says, '';She's a whore,
you can have aspirations too!''

316
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:21,884
l slammed his head
into the wall... Bang!

317
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:27,477
He drops. l do a few Govinda moves
on his head. Job done

318
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:29,483
Should have kicked him!

319
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:32,360
l couldn't. lt's a small room,
no space to kick

320
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,318
l'll show you. Stay there

321
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,244
Hold these a sec

322
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,078
Should have kicked him like this

323
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:46,876
Fuck!

324
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:51,682
Sisterfu...

325
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:00,238
What happened?

326
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,922
What happened? Sisterfu...
Motherfu...

327
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,036
Sisterfu...

328
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:08,798
Open the door

329
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,560
Listen, we ain't got time
for your bullshit

330
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,445
l'm not joking, man,
it's really hurting me!

331
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,164
Does it hurt bad?

332
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,084
Let me see

333
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:29,963
Move, l'll do it myself

334
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,645
- l can't get it off
- l'll have a look

335
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:42,440
Sit still for a minute, will you?

336
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,364
They're here

337
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,124
l'm not going

338
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,004
Pass me the gear

339
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,205
- Why are we moving?
- lt's better this way

340
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,123
lt's more dangerous to stand still

341
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,838
You got the gear?

342
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,798
You got the money?

343
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:50,758
You feeling alright?

344
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,445
What do you mean?

345
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,280
l mean you look a little nervous

346
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,084
Shall l tell you how l feel?

347
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,885
- Show me the gear
- Money first

348
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,847
The gear first

349
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,882
The money

350
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:13,636
Look, you know
it's always the gear first

351
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,923
Get out!

352
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:53,438
Get out!

353
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,286
You want me, come in and get me

354
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:59,363

come have some

355
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:16,598
l ought to get more exercise

356
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:43,280
Who was it?
Who does the gear belong to?

357
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,245
You're talking too much.
Talk one at a time

358
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,006
Tell me about that 400 grams

359
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,162
l don't know nothing

360
00:31:56,007 --> 00:32:00,637
Four years ago,
you did 6 months in jail...

361
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:03,565
...for dealing cocaine

362
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:04,642
ls that correct?

363
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:09,235
l did two or three months.
l can't remember what for

364
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:16,117
You know,
the way you're talking...

365
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,876
...you're planning to go back inside!

366
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:34,360
You have a lot of people
on the outside waiting for you

367
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:38,195
You must owe somebody
quite a bit of money

368
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:46,799
Do you want to tell us something?

369
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:51,646
Can l get some private
bathing facilities next time?

370
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:00,362
Man, such a dirty cell

371
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:05,046
l know the police pays you shit, but
they must give you cash for cleaners

372
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,083
Where did the gear come from?

373
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:32,038
Who was buying it?

374
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:42,520
You can't keep me
longer than 24 hours

375
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:46,359
As a guardian of the law,
you know this

376
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,163
What time is it?

377
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:54,837
You got 2 or 3 minutes.
You want to say something, say it

378
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,720
You're a real expert on the law, yeah?

379
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,484
You don't know nothing

380
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,445
He's your business partner, Kabir?

381
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,439
Real solid friendship, isn't it?

382
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:34,204
Look at this!

383
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:39,167
Your friend Kabir's
freshly placed signature

384
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,927
And you two's blockbuster
life story

385
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:45,805
Real strong partnership, isn't it?

386
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:48,644
Tell me, Salim!

387
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,245
Look. There's no need to be a hero

388
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:11,682
Some real bad people
are waiting for you out there

389
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:14,560
Why can't you get it into your skull?

390
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,246
Silent. Still silent

391
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,158
Get out of here!

392
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,323
Are my eyes deceiving me, Sallu?

393
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:52,039
l know you'll say l promised

394
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,884
You promised something?

395
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:57,724
l can't recall any promise

396
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,883
Shamsher, can you recall any promise?

397
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:03,480
l was going to come
with the money yesterday

398
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,398
Come, sit

399
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,238
OK. Tell me

400
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,000
l haven't got the money

401
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,918
l haven't got the money
or the gear

402
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:21,804
Why not?

403
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,764
Why don't you have
the money or the gear?

404
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:33,317
The police got me.
l ran but they arrested me

405
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,921
Sallu got caught by the police
with 400 grams

406
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,923
Didn't they throw you in jail?

407
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,606
So you didn't go to jail, eh?

408
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:54,564
The gear's in the lake.
All the gear is in the lake

409
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:56,521
The gear's in the lake

410
00:36:57,327 --> 00:37:01,161
- Yeah, in the lake
- 400 grams in the lake

411
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:10,835
My best friend in
the whole of London, Salim...

412
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,765
...and my 400 grams
is in the lake

413
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,403
So the cops arrested you?

414
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,325
Yeah, man, l told you.
The cops arrested me

415
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,121
lf that's the case, they must
have given you some papers

416
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,158
Show me the papers

417
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,002
What papers?

418
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:33,800
Papers, arrest papers!

419
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,759
lf they don't charge you,
they don't give you any papers

420
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,684
What kind of bullshit is this?

421
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,478
That's just how it is

422
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,084
Not now!

423
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:59,678
Look at her, Salim.
Her father owed me 30 grand

424
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,716
30 grand!

425
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,565
Killed himself through drink and gambling

426
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:10,237
Left her to pay off
his debt to me

427
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,085
lf l put her on the street 24 hours a day...

428
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,836
...she could still never pay
her bastard father's debt off

429
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,523
l'll have to think of something

430
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:32,281
400 grams, and Sallu...

431
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:35,363
...you don't even have a daughter

432
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:43,795
Now you owe me £36,000

433
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:46,726
Not 36, it's 26

434
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,644
What was our deal?

435
00:38:48,687 --> 00:38:51,599
The deal was £20,000
and l owed you 6 from...

436
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:58,441
The deal was 20,000. Was!
Now it's 30,000

437
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:02,085
And the previous 6,
how much is that? 36!

438
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,920
Want to know why, Sallu?

439
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,763
Ask me. Go on, ask me

440
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,404
Why?

441
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:25,080
lt's for this colourful tale
you've so lovingly spun for me

442
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:29,996
That's why. But look...
the amount keeps rising

443
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:37,597
Sallu, what can you do now?.

444
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:41,565
Can you bring me
some money right now?.

445
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:50,084
l can do 5,000,
if Shamsher comes with me

446
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:54,960
But first l've got to do
something

447
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:56,838
5,000?

448
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:01,601
A guy owes me 5,000.
We can go there in a little while

449
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:06,445
You go with him

450
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,523
Make a pick-up from John's
on the way back

451
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:13,238
And the rest of it?

452
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,079
Next week

453
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,846
5,000 now, yeah?

454
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:24,758
Look, Sallu

455
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:26,682
Take care, yeah?

456
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:31,403
l'll be back in a bit

457
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:53,483
What's going on?
What's going on, you bastard?

458
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:57,236
What did you do?
You talk to the cops?

459
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:58,316
Bastard!

460
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:02,080
What did you tell the police?

461
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,684
What did you do?

462
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:16,518
Where you going?
Where you going?

463
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,885
- Let it go, Salim
- You wanna say something?

464
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:32,876
Nothing

465
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:57,766
ls he dangerous?

466
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,720
No, he's just one who keeps buying
but never pays

467
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,637
Either that, or he'll say
he'll pay tomorrow

468
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:15,000
24 hours, man, you gotta stay on
their tail. Reminding what they owe

469
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:19,996
The debt, the interest.
When it's due. All the time

470
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:25,646
There was this white guy,
he owed Davar 9 grand

471
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,401
Something went bad
and his business went down

472
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,402
So l had to go

473
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:40,042
l'd already been a few times
and spoken politely

474
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:45,003
ln the end,
the same thing always happens

475
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:47,723
l had to go to see him
with a knife

476
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,645
l whacked it so hard in his knee...

477
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:55,566
...his whole kneecap
popped out into my hand

478
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:03,001
Honestly, man, Salim.
l really think about leaving all this

479
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,802
l want to do something else.
l'm tired of it

480
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:09,844
What would you do?

481
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,765
Davar's a really good cook, yeah?

482
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:15,683
But l'm a real good cook too!

483
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:22,317
Shish kebab,
that's my special dish

484
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:27,955
l get special chillies and spices
from all over the world

485
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,806
Ah, the diner really enjoys it!

486
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,720
Really tasty, delicious stuff

487
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,641
Honestly, l'm thinking
of opening a restaurant

488
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:45,400
l haven't told anyone

489
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,244
Just you

490
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:51,080
l'll get Davar to do the sweets!

491
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:53,967
Listen, man, do you really
like his food?

492
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,959
Leave it out! He can't cook!

493
00:43:57,727 --> 00:44:00,799
Watch closely, he doesn't eat his own stuff
but forces it on others!

494
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:06,563
Do you have the money or not?

495
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,283
Look, bro,
l don't have it right now

496
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:13,115
- l need the money now
- You'll definitely get it on the 1st

497
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:17,005
- l need it now, not on the 1st
- Listen, bro...

498
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,043
Don't touch me!

499
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:24,636
You've owed me 5,000 for ages.
Why don't you pay me?

500
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:27,520
What can l say, bro?
l've got real troubles

501
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,558
You think l'm joking. This isn't a joke

502
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:33,316
Brother, can we sit down and discuss this?

503
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,247
lf you don't help me,
l can't help you. l need it now

504
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:42,037
Come on, Salim.
You used to play with my kid brother

505
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:44,043
Has your brother got the money?

506
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:48,685
Then why are you
bringing him into it?

507
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,687
Listen, Rahul, if you don't
somehow get hold of the cash...

508
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:56,367
...he's gonna take a knife
and rip out your kneecaps

509
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,437
What am l gonna do
with a watch, man?

510
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,078
Listen, Rahul, it ain't my money

511
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:14,524
Hold on, bro

512
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:19,355
A thief, eh? Like to party
on other people's cash?

513
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:21,363
Can you get the money or not?

514
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:24,285
l know this white guy.
He can get the money

515
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,046
You like kissing
the white man's ass?

516
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:30,875
This is my money. Understand?
My money!

517
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:32,997
Tell me! Can you get the money?

518
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,805
No? Then l also have
another way to get it

519
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:46,242
You'll get the money from the bank
with this!

520
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:49,321
He can't rob a bank

521
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,196
Anyone can rob a bank!

522
00:45:51,927 --> 00:45:53,963
He doesn't have the balls
to do that

523
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,884
lt's 4:15,
how's he gonna rob a bank?

524
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:59,840
Problem over. This is the best way
to get the money

525
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:04,601
He cannot raid a bank,
he does not have the courage

526
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:09,277
We haven't got much time.
What bank shall we hit?

527
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:10,362
What do l care?

528
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:13,287
Hey! Where do you bank?

529
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,084
NatWest

530
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,925
We can't go to his bank,
can we?

531
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,878
There won't be another one local

532
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:23,847
- We'll just hit the first bank we see
- Nope, it's gonna be his bank

533
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,566
Or the fucker loses his life

534
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,924
Even if you'd killed one of us...

535
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,925
...the other would have blown
your brains out, fucker!

536
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:48,676
Come on, get your bus pass,
it's time to go

537
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:51,683
Brother, just give me one line first

538
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:55,481
Yeah, we'll give you a line.
First you get us the cash

539
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:59,202
- Just give him a line, will you, man?
- He gets nothing!

540
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,164
Not until he does our little job

541
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:06,917
Come on, time to go,
whitey-lover. Let's go!

542
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:51,964
Now what?

543
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:56,797
l'll tell Davar. Make sure
you bring the money tomorrow

544
00:47:56,847 --> 00:47:58,724
Don't forget

545
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:14,636
How are you?

546
00:49:14,687 --> 00:49:16,484
How are you?

547
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,567
You OK?

548
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:20,478
Yeah, l'm OK. And you?

549
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,045
What's this l've heard?

550
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:29,076
What?

551
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,083
What you did to Kabir

552
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,798
What did you hear?

553
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:37,799
That you really beat
the hell out of him

554
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:40,441
What's going on?

555
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:42,398
You going to dance now?.

556
00:49:44,407 --> 00:49:47,205
King got real sick

557
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:50,087
He threw up all day yesterday,
didn't eat anything

558
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,087
l'm really scared

559
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:55,921
l took him to a really expensive vet
in the West End

560
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,525
There's a film party tonight.
Want to go?

561
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:08,478
Will there be any stars there?

562
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,236
l think so

563
00:50:10,327 --> 00:50:12,238
Of course!
l definitely want to go!

564
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,959
l'll come and pick you up
from the club at midnight

565
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:31,278
Stop it, man

566
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:37,242
You'll get him to put another 20,000
on Pakistan for the final

567
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:41,078
Firstly, he won't agree

568
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,886
You already owe him 40 grand

569
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:50,555
Right now, you're this close
to getting blown away

570
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:56,315
l've been doing this shit
since l was a kid

571
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,278
They can't kill me...

572
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:02,161
...because l've got
the good Lord on my side

573
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:06,123
You settled up with Davar yet?

574
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,359
Look, man, take the phone

575
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:26,205
You call him, l can't do it

576
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:32,042
Go on...make the call, man

577
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:36,718
l need the money

578
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,159
- What is it?
- Bolivian. How much do you want?

579
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:55,998
l want my money!

580
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,758
lt's not your money, it's my money

581
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:02,719
And if you want to see more money,
you'll place my bet

582
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:04,519
£60,000 on the final

583
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:08,361
What about what you owe me
from the last game?

584
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:10,244
Fuck the last game

585
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:14,206
Pakistan won't win.
They lost to Bangladesh

586
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:16,158
The tournament's until the final

587
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:19,916
Not the quarter-final.
Not the semi-final. The final

588
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,685
You place my bet

589
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,679
Pakistan, lndia.
They've all sold out

590
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:32,359
No one fixes the final.
Put my bet on

591
00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:34,238
We'll see

592
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:38,118
There's nothing to see

593
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:41,079
Put the bet on
or forget all of the money

594
00:52:42,087 --> 00:52:45,921
We'll see. l'm watching you

595
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,643
Just place the bet

596
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,247

00:52:58,247 --> 00:52:59,316

Give me a grand,
l'll make it 21 grams

600
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:11,796
Let me think about it

601
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:20,403
Let it go

602
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,324

605
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:44,405
OK, so you want the gun?

606
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,358
lt's amazing, man

607
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:50,036
That's what you call true power,

Yeah, if it's heroin

611
00:54:04,647 --> 00:54:06,558

00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,638
ln one hour

618
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:30,362
One hour?. OK, l'll be in the gym

You know what, just give me

That'll be 1,500 and

00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:47,358
Nothing

627
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:54,963
What did that photographer say?

628
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:02,565
- You really want to know?.
- Yeah

629
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:08,442
He said he'd give me 300
if l went home with him

630
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:13,080
He thought l was that type of girl

631
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,879
Aren't you? That type of girl?

632
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:39,041
ls there a difference?
Going home for 300 or for 1 ,000?

633
00:56:41,887 --> 00:56:43,843
There's a big difference

634
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:49,718

635
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:52,565

00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:20,518
Anita, let's go!

638
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:23,243

00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:41,605
- Whatever you...
- l don't want to talk about it

640
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:30,447
King must be out there somewhere

641
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:32,403
At the doctor's

642
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:55,356
- Hello, who's that?
- Me, Anees. Who's that?

643
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,245
Hello, Anees.
lt's Salim from London

01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:14,677
Yeah, man.
You should come next time!

648
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:20,438
l'll show you Holland,
it's not like your backward country

649
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:25,163
Manisha's a real good girl.
We really partied

650
01:01:25,207 --> 01:01:28,165
So she had to stay.
She'll be back tomorrow

651
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:30,084

01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:43,565

Man, she promised me

Got some real good gear in this time,
but l told her to wait

01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,797
- Don't wanna have her pay too much

Didn't he tell you what happened?

664
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:31,561
This is no good, yeah?

...you won't be able to walk
on your own legs again, OK?

670
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,845
You watching TV?

671
01:03:07,887 --> 01:03:09,764
What's on?

672
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:13,724
Some old lndian film

What's this?

678
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,680

690
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,280
The vet says he could die

691
01:04:57,447 --> 01:05:00,166
Salim, will you take me

692
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:02,004

693
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:04,083
Salim, stay with me

OK, but l've got something

01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:38,723
- What about me?
- What about you?

701
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:44,320
l can't stand out here

702
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:00,604
And my money?

703
01:06:02,527 --> 01:06:04,483
We're going to the hospital

704
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:06,558

705
01:06:09,327 --> 01:06:11,363

706
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,283
You know what?
You're taking the piss

707

He's dying

709
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:24,640
You want to come
to the hospital with us?

01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:30,523
Right now

712
01:06:31,527 --> 01:06:33,438
But l haven't got it, have l?

713
01:06:40,047 --> 01:06:42,117
Oh, great! Who's this character?

714
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,755
- What's in your head?
- What do you mean?

715
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:50,684
You gone mad?

716
01:06:53,527 --> 01:06:55,518
ls any one of us mad over here?

717
01:07:02,127 --> 01:07:04,038
l'm not going anywhere...

718
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:12,764
Watch it!

719
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:17,598
You didn't come yesterday

720
01:07:19,407 --> 01:07:21,318
l didn't have the money yesterday

721
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,203
Now what can l do?

722
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:29,877
When Davar says,
''Find Salim and get my money''...

723
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:32,803
...it's a serious problem

724
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:36,645
l'll come over in a day or two
and sort it out

725
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:40,480
You know l need the money today

726
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:52,002
l've got 200 grams of white heroin.
You can sell it for 15,000

727
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:55,840
You've got it?

728
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:57,798
Where did you get it?

729
01:07:57,847 --> 01:07:59,724
Will it do?

730
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:03,645
Course it'll fucking do. Pass it

731
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:24,645
You giving me sugar, Salim?

732
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:34,444

733
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:50,605
- So how you doing? Settled in OK?
- Pretty much

734

What you doing?

735
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,844
Lactose and baking soda?

736
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:10,767
l should rip your kneecaps out,
you bastard!

737
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:13,759
l'm giving you one more chance
for friendship's sake

738
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:17,485
l need the full 36,000
by tomorrow. Tomorrow!

739
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:44,318
What happened, Salim?

740
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:48,285
- Where's Manisha?
- l don't know

741
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,884
Shall we go?

742
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,644
Get a taxi

743
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,438
You owe me money

744
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:54,485
lf you'd phoned first,
l would have kept it ready

745
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:58,323
Your phone's always off

746
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:02,160
What have you got?
What have you got?

747
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:05,118

748
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:08,965

ln the office
l've got a TV and VCR

751
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:24,201
lf you'd phoned me earlier,
l'd have kept the money ready for you

752
01:12:29,487 --> 01:12:32,365
Take a seat.
l'll be back in a minute

753
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:01,796
Get out of my house

754
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:06,526
lf l'd got rid of you before,
my husband would still be alive

755
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,240
And now you're going
to kill somebody?

756
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:14,247
ls that why l gave birth to you?
To see this day?

757
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:18,957
Drugs, gambling, violence

758
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:24,603
You haven't done a single
good thing your entire life

759
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:26,638
You'll die the death of a dog

760
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:30,566
You'll see.
The way you've tortured me

761
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,447
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

762
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:35,403
Get out of my house!

763
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:40,160
Never show your face again!
Go! Get out of my house! Go!

764
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:05,997
- How are you?
- OK

765
01:15:07,047 --> 01:15:09,766
What are you doing these days?

766
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:13,595
Nothing, just looking for a job

767
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:16,478
- Are you hungry?
- No

768
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:18,438
- Do you want something to eat?
- No, Mum

769
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:22,241
- l'll make you something
- Have you got any money?

770
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:27,205
Somehow l need to gather
some money today

771
01:15:28,007 --> 01:15:30,043
- What for?
- l need to pay some people

772
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:32,838
How much?

773
01:15:32,887 --> 01:15:34,764
36,000

774
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:37,796
36,000!

775
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,400
Have you got it?

776
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:46,359
- l have to pay them today or...
- Or...?

777
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:52,155
These people,
can't you talk to them?

778
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:58,835
They don't want to talk.
They just want their money

779
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:06,485
l have 6,000. You can have all of that

780
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:27,676
Here you are, son

781
01:16:29,447 --> 01:16:31,438
You going so soon?

782
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:34,206
l've got a lot of work to do, Mum

783
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:42,918
lt was baking powder! Baking powder!

784
01:16:43,007 --> 01:16:45,840
- What are you doing?
- Did you check the gear?

785
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:48,685
Yeah, l did. l checked it properly

786
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:51,685
- Then why bring baking powder?
- l didn't!

787
01:16:51,727 --> 01:16:54,480
- Where were you yesterday?
- l don't know

788
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,485
- Where were you? Where were you?
- With Lakhan. l was with Lakhan

789
01:16:58,207 --> 01:17:00,163
- Lakhan from Green Street?
- Yes

790
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:10,716
- Where's my gear?
- l don't know! l don't know!

791
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:15,682
- l don't know! l don't know!

792
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,439
Salim! Your gear's in Amsterdam!
Salim! Your gear's in Amsterdam!

793
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:26,116
He doesn't know anything!
He doesn't know anything!

794
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,044
Salim, let him go!

795
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:30,998
My gear's in Amsterdam?

796
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,325
- l got your money
- About time

797
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:59,839
- Got any more Bolivian?
- l've got 25 grams

798
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:09,395
- Give me your money and your gear
- What are you doing?

799
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:12,200
You've gone mad

800
01:18:12,247 --> 01:18:15,080
People are right! Your head's fucked

801
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:23,803
He's taking my money!

802
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:05,087
Australia and Pakistan are playing
the 1999 Cricket World Cup final...

803
01:19:05,087 --> 01:19:09,847
...and what a performance it's been
from Pakistan

804
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:12,645
Take it easy, relax, relax...

805
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:19,402
Like '92, can Pakistan become
World Champions again this year?.

806
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:23,240
Hit a six, hit a six, man!

807
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:27,161
Pakistan is making an effort,
all the players...

808
01:19:27,207 --> 01:19:31,086
But whatever they try,
the team seems to have collapsed

809
01:19:31,887 --> 01:19:34,765
Whatever they do,
Pakistan cannot win this match

810
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:42,357
What's happened? They were
playing well at the start...

811
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:45,240
...but the team seems to have
now suddenly collapsed

812
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:48,080
Whatever they try,
they will not win this match

813
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,444
Alright?

814
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,918
lt's time, Salim

815
01:20:34,407 --> 01:20:36,363
You got a gun, Salim?

816
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,083
Never seen you with a gun before

817
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,838
What were you gonna do with a gun?

818
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:48,798
You want to go to war, Salim?

819
01:20:49,807 --> 01:20:52,526
Want to go to war with us?

820
01:20:54,487 --> 01:20:56,443
You ain't got anything else,
have you?

821
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,079
Were you going to do
something stupid?

822
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:09,798
l need more time

823
01:21:11,727 --> 01:21:13,683
Come on. lt's time to go

824
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:29,003
l'll give you 10,000, let me go

825
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:10,281

826
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:15,083
How you doin', Sallu?

01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:19,844
l can give you 8

828
01:22:21,927 --> 01:22:24,680
How much was our deal for, Sallu?

829
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:29,565
- Say it. How much was the deal?
- 36,000

830
01:22:29,607 --> 01:22:31,563
Right! 36,000

831
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,238
l'll give it you all in 2 days

832
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:40,158
l just need 2 days

833
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:46,961
OK, one day

834
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:51,679
What shall l do, Shamsher?
Should l agree?

835
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:57,244
OK

836
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:00,164
Listen...

837
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:03,157
You have a car outside, don't you?

838
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:05,923
Take out the keys

839
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:13,599
1 ,500. We'll call it 1 ,500
for the car, OK?

840
01:23:13,647 --> 01:23:15,683
That's alright, isn't it, Shamsher?

841
01:23:15,727 --> 01:23:20,357
lt's a fair deal. 1 ,500 for the car.
What else?

842
01:23:21,327 --> 01:23:23,238
- The watch
- Anything else?

843
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,156
The watch!

844
01:23:37,647 --> 01:23:39,717
lt's an expensive watch. Omega

845
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,358
James Bond wears one of these

846
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:44,318
James Bond wears this

847
01:23:46,207 --> 01:23:47,322
James Bond wears one!

848
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,925
OK. l think 500.
ls 500 enough?

849
01:23:57,727 --> 01:24:00,685
What about this? Remove it

850
01:24:03,527 --> 01:24:05,438
lt's real silver, isn't it?

851
01:24:06,447 --> 01:24:08,403
200 for this. That's OK, isn't it?

852
01:24:09,407 --> 01:24:12,160
200 is OK, yeah?
Anything else?

853
01:24:12,327 --> 01:24:14,238
You got anything else?

854
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:18,004
150 cash

855
01:24:19,047 --> 01:24:21,880
There we go!
Now we're doing business!

856
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:23,758
Now we're doing business

857
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:26,605
Taking his stuff,
we've got him started, eh?

858
01:24:26,647 --> 01:24:29,480
We should do this
with all of them!

859
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:32,283
That's true, that's true!

860
01:24:32,487 --> 01:24:35,240
- And that 8,000?
- lt's at the hotel

861
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:37,164
lt's at the hotel?
Down in your secret room?

862
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:39,158
Yeah

863
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:41,998
Hiding it from the cops?

864
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:44,967
Very smart, very smart!

865
01:24:44,967 --> 01:24:49,563
Shammi, you should always
keep stuff hidden from the cops

866
01:24:50,647 --> 01:24:53,480
But not to worry,
Shamsher will go and get it

867
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:56,325
He'll be back in a shot.
Don't worry about it

868
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:59,245
They won't deal with him

869
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:02,207
What?

870
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:04,118
She won't...

871
01:25:06,007 --> 01:25:07,884
...give him the key

872
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:13,636
Look, then that's another
problem then, isn't it?

873
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:16,520
Shammi will go.
You can phone, can't you?

874
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:22,315
Make the call.
Go, make the call!

875
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:43,363
There's another problem

876
01:25:44,327 --> 01:25:48,240
Hear that?
You've got a lot of problems

877
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:50,164
How many more problems
will you tell us about?

878
01:25:50,207 --> 01:25:52,004
The girl's not there

879
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:54,083
One problem...two problems...

880
01:25:54,847 --> 01:25:56,803
We'll have to go in a little while

881
01:25:56,847 --> 01:25:58,838
Three problems, four problems!

882
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,718
There's nothing l can do,
she's not there!

883
01:26:00,807 --> 01:26:02,604
Nothing you can do?

884
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:11,238
What shall we do now, Sallu?

885
01:26:16,967 --> 01:26:18,116
l didn't do anything

886
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:20,847
You didn't do anything?

887
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:22,758
You fraudster!

888
01:26:23,847 --> 01:26:26,600
- Didn't do anything?
- l didn't cheat you

889
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:29,366
£36,000!

890
01:26:29,407 --> 01:26:33,286
You owed me £36,000!
Where did my £36,000 go?

891
01:26:39,207 --> 01:26:42,040
Shammi, let him go.
Let the thief go

892
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:50,521
Did you say something, Sallu?
l can't quite hear

893
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:54,360
- What did you say?
- l didn't steal...

894
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:56,363
You didn't steal?

895
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,044
l have...

896
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:11,766
l have 6,000 at the hotel

897
01:27:11,847 --> 01:27:14,645
You said 8,000 before! 8,000!

898
01:27:14,727 --> 01:27:19,327
You think l'm a bastard, Salim?
You thought Davar was a bastard!

899
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:21,363
And decided to do away
with his bastard money!

900
01:27:46,247 --> 01:27:51,082
Put some foil in the fuse box,
and we can keep on going all night

901
01:27:52,047 --> 01:27:54,845
Or else Sallu here
can tell us a story

902
01:27:54,887 --> 01:27:57,924
Be brave, Sallu, tell us a story

903
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:05,480
- Davar...Amsterdam...
- What?

904
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:10,362
Your money...
sell gear in Amsterdam...

905
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:14,116
You were gonna sell it and run off
to Amsterdam, were you?

906
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:20,044
- You were gonna betray me, eh?
- l didn't betray you...

907
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,877
You did betray me!

908
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:33,361
Now l'm gonna show you
something, thief

909
01:28:33,407 --> 01:28:36,205
Now l'll show you.
So you remember Davar's friendship...

910
01:28:36,247 --> 01:28:39,159
So you can never steal
from a friend's house again

911
01:28:46,927 --> 01:28:49,725
Now l'll teach you!

912
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:53,478
You scared now?

913
01:28:53,527 --> 01:28:55,483
You scared now?

914
01:28:55,527 --> 01:28:58,447
Now you'll find out, you bastard!

915
01:28:58,447 --> 01:29:01,120
Now you'll find out!

916
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,478
What happened?

917
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:08,404
l got my head kicked in

918
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,159
By who?

919
01:30:12,327 --> 01:30:14,079
Some guys

920
01:30:15,247 --> 01:30:16,919
What now?

921
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:19,962
l'm leaving town

922
01:30:22,767 --> 01:30:24,564
King died last night

923
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,204
Want to come with me?

924
01:30:37,127 --> 01:30:38,242
Do you want me to come?

925
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:42,078
Yes, l want you to come

926
01:30:44,847 --> 01:30:45,882
OK

927
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:48,678
Where?

928
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:53,525
Anywhere. Just far away
from here

929
01:30:57,407 --> 01:30:59,398
Where do you want to go?

930
01:31:17,527 --> 01:31:20,360
Salim, l want to leave
all this behind as well

931
01:31:31,047 --> 01:31:32,958
l've got a few things at the club

932
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:34,876
l'll pick them up and we'll go

933
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:39,598
l'll meet you outside the club
in two hours

934
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:41,437
Alright

935
01:32:44,927 --> 01:32:46,758
What?

936
01:32:47,727 --> 01:32:50,685
You just going to stand there
or are you going to say something?

937
01:32:53,647 --> 01:32:55,444
What shall l do now?.

938
01:32:59,247 --> 01:33:01,078
Say something at least

939
01:33:08,847 --> 01:33:10,758
Where were you?

940
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:13,564
Where were you...

941
01:33:14,687 --> 01:33:16,598
...when l needed you?

942
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:22,284
When l needed you

943
01:33:23,407 --> 01:33:28,037
Not Mother, not the others, me

944
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:31,884
When l needed you...

945
01:33:31,927 --> 01:33:32,882
...where were you?

946
01:33:32,927 --> 01:33:34,758
Where were you?!

947
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:42,482
Forgive me

948
01:33:47,207 --> 01:33:48,242
Forgive me

949
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,920
l've done many bad things in my life

950
01:33:55,767 --> 01:33:56,961
l tried really hard

951
01:33:59,687 --> 01:34:01,678
l tried really hard to be good

952
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:08,323
Help me, Father. Father, help me...

953
01:34:10,407 --> 01:34:13,205
Forgive me...forgive me

954
01:34:22,887 --> 01:34:24,684
Forgive me

955
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:28,636
Forgive me

956
01:34:49,687 --> 01:34:55,444
My grand-daughter has worked
day and night for him for 3 months

957
01:34:56,447 --> 01:34:59,359
But Davar says that the debt
isn't being paid fast enough

958
01:35:00,207 --> 01:35:02,198
And now, to pay it off...

959
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:05,038
...he's going to introduce her to men

960
01:35:07,007 --> 01:35:10,795
He has her in a room
with a man right now

961
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:15,599
She said she'd seen you there

962
01:35:17,487 --> 01:35:19,443
That you may be able to help

963
01:35:19,487 --> 01:35:22,285
lt's been very difficult for me
to come here

964
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:26,125
We don't know anyone in the city

965
01:37:28,007 --> 01:37:29,122
Reduced to pimping now, Davar?

966
01:37:33,927 --> 01:37:35,724
Why have you stopped?

967
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:37,677
Dance!

968
01:37:44,487 --> 01:37:46,239
Send the girl down

969
01:41:02,127 --> 01:41:04,038
This is some money. You have it

970
01:41:07,087 --> 01:41:09,760
May every mother have a son like you

971
01:42:21,847 --> 01:42:24,725
You want to bet,
but you don't want to pay

972
01:42:24,726 --> 01:42:25,726
