1
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:31,792
Once more.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,958
Stop. Let's try something else.

3
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,625
Anything except this.

4
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,167
What about this?

5
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,708
Your tongue should touch your palate.

6
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,750
What do you want?

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,208
Bunty?

8
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,042
Bunny?

9
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,250
PK?

10
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,667
Bicky!

11
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,917
-Don't know what happens to me?
-Bunty?

12
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,500
And the other was Bunny?

13
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,458
No. He said his name starts with a "B."
Bunty and Bunny are common names.

14
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,583
And what's PK?

15
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,125
I thought of PK...

16
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,833
Whatever. He's very cute!

17
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,292
That's something fishy!

18
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,792
-Right. Rahul, hit it to the right side.
-Come on.

19
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,458
Pass the ball to left.

20
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,125
Hey, dude. What are...

21
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,167
Hey, man!

22
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,833
I told you, don't play solo.

23
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,583
-Come on.
-Rahul, come on. Pass.

24
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,792
-Pass!
-Come on, Rahul.

25
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,042
Don't play solo, Rahul.

26
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,625
-Take it...
-Hey, man. Block him.

27
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,958
-Hey, block him...
-Come on.

28
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,083
-Cover from the other side. Be quick.
-Come on. Keep going.

29
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,625
Hey, come on. At least try to defend.

30
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,083
-What is this? At least be defensive.
-Try to defend.

31
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,292
Why didn't you block him?

32
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,958
-Hey! Hey, no!
-Wait, no. Don't.

33
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,875
Rahul! Pass it forward. Come on...

34
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,250
Go towards the point...

35
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,375
-Pass it...
-Hey, you hit it with your hand.

36
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,167
-It hit my chest!
-No, it's your hand.

37
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,542
No, it was his chest.

38
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,958
-Hey, come on!
-That's cheating, man!

39
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,042
-Hey, Rahul. Wait!
-Wait, Rahul!

40
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on, Rahul. The game isn't over yet.

41
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,083
Come on, Rahul. Come back.

42
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,208
Rahul, the game is still on.

43
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,125
-Let's finish the game, at least.
-This is not fair.

44
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,917
Give it. Assholes!

45
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,708
They don't even know the game well.

46
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,500
Assholes.

47
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,458
Give me the money!

48
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,625
Take your T-shirt.

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,333
From now on, don't call for a game.

50
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,958
Return the money.

51
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,167
-What is it? Let go.
-Why are you taking the money?

52
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,292
Why are you taking the money?
You were on my team, right?

53
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,792
-Yes, I was with you.
-We lost the match.

54
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,917
-We lost? I played well.
-You lost the match on purpose.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,792
-You lost on purpose, didn't you?
-Let go of me!

56
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,125
Son of a bitch!

57
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,500
-Hey! What is it?
-Fuck off!

58
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,333
I'll hit you hard. Just sit there.

59
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,083
Bloody assholes!

60
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,292
Tell me. What's going on?

61
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,917
Why? Is he absent?

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,583
Just give it to me.
Why do you want to argue?

63
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,625
I gave you yesterday.

64
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,917
-You're mute.
-Where did you spend it?

65
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,958
You're mute. You cheat people
by acting dumb.

66
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,583
You cheat people.

67
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,583
Do you get it? You cheat
by acting that you're mute.

68
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,500
God will never spare you.

69
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,625
-Look, he's laughing.
-What a drunkard.

70
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,042
He was the same drunkard we met...

71
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,958
He even hit his wife yesterday.

72
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,250
Too bad.

73
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,792
-Really?
-Yes.

74
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,375
Give me the money.

75
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,625
I just got it and you're asking...

76
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,292
I have to buy rice. Give it to me.

77
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,458
Don't talk rubbish!
We still have some left.

78
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,917
Hey, listen! We had a match yesterday,

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,958
-and he was hit by Messi's shoulder.
-Messi...

80
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,042
-Don't fool around with my ball.
-Why?

81
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,333
Who got this for you?

82
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,625
-I said don't play with it...
-What don't play?

83
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,833
-It will burst.
-Stupid...

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,917
-Don't! I will twist your hand.
-Twist my hand? You cry like a child.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Hey, Prince.

86
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,000
Prince...

87
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,792
Let's go out and have fun.

88
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Prince.

89
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,833
-Bloody asshole.
-Hey!

90
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,375
-Hey! What happened?
-I won't spare you.

91
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,292
Ask him.

92
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,375
-Why did he come to my house?
-Why did...

93
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,292
-He came in slowly...
-Did I hurt you?

94
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,250
-Happy New Year!
-"Happy New Year"?

95
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,375
Get lost!

96
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,292
-Just ask him, why did he come to me?
-Just a minute.

97
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,125
She's scratched me, bloody wild cat!

98
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,458
-Wild cat...
-Hey! What's this?

99
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,125
-He's young. I'm saying sorry for him.
-Come on. Go.

100
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,125
Happy New Year, my child.

101
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,625
How are you doing?

102
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,000
I am fine.

103
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,875
Jasleen is fine, too.

104
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,292
I hope you are having a good time.

105
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,208
Good. Have fun.

106
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,375
Enjoy.

107
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,458
Celebrate the new year.

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,833
What's up?

109
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,750
What about my order?

110
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,042
The consignment hasn't arrived.

111
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:23,958
Stay mute, idiot!

112
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,917
Or else you'll lose your job.

113
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,333
It hasn't arrived yet.

114
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,083
It hasn't?

115
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,458
Then give me some information.

116
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,625
I won't go empty-handed.
Give me information.

117
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,792
Don't call anyone without informing me.

118
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,333
Give me some sugar.

119
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:56,625
I'm getting that one?

120
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
Is that what I'll get?

121
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,458
Who gave you my number?

122
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,375
Who gave you my number?

123
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,125
Tell me the location.

124
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,333
How much do you want?

125
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,125
-Hit him.
-Go ahead.

126
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,667
Bicky is a beggar...

127
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,708
Clean this shit up.

128
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,875
Anybody home?

129
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,667
Wake up!

130
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,875
Don't you have a game today?

131
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,375
It's in the evening.

132
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,583
Leave some cash behind.

133
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,958
I gave you money two days ago.
What did you do?

134
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:55,917
How much did you give me?

135
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,208
I gave you 200.

136
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,958
Why are you being fussy?

137
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,250
Fussy? You're just going to spend
on those losers...

138
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,042
I'll give you more
after two or three days.

139
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,583
Just leave some behind.

140
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,958
I don't have any right now.

141
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,083
And what about the phone?

142
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:12,625
What?

143
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,833
You said you'll buy me a new one.

144
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,500
Take one of the spares at home.

145
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,458
I don't want junk.

146
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,000
Get me a smartphone.

147
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,333
We'll get one next month.

148
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,292
That's never going to happen.

149
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,708
I'm leaving 100 rupees. Take it.

150
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,958
I don't want it.

151
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,083
How much did you score in Math?

152
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,083
Get lost!

153
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,000
You fool!

154
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,583
You idiot.

155
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,708
You could barely read a sentence,

156
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,917
even on the day before the exam.

157
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,458
Obviously, you were going to fail!

158
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,375
At least you could have copied
from someone.

159
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,917
It doesn't matter to me
if I didn't pass the exams.

160
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,542
But I'm in love with a girl who's going
to move up to tenth grade.

161
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,167
She's moving up,

162
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,375
while I'm going to stay in ninth grade.

163
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,625
I don't even cry at funerals!

164
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,083
Be quick.

165
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,292
I needed some water.

166
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,667
That's fine.

167
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,625
Can you do me a favor?

168
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,708
I've been trying to do online transactions
since morning,

169
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,917
but my card won't get through.

170
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,042
And now...

171
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:20,542
It's too late for a home delivery.

172
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,750
Not the one from coffee shops.

173
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,083
I can make some for you if you want.

174
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll be back.

175
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,750
Hey, Messi. What are you doing
with these losers?

176
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,292
What are you doing?

177
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,000
Is it Bicky?

178
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,583
Yes, Bicky!

179
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,833
Isn't he cool?

180
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,667
Now, act like Messi and ask me for money.

181
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:12,958
"Give me money."

182
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,500
"One thousand, two thousand,
three thousand, four thousand...

183
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,250
and peanuts for you."

184
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,542
Good one! Bloody beggar!

185
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,333
How is the cap?

186
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:29,667
Take your cap. Keep it.

187
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:42,375
I want to join you.
I want to work with you.

188
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,458
Very nice.

189
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:51,583
What happened?

190
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,167
Tell me.

191
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,917
You play football very well.
What's the matter?

192
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,583
Your practice sessions are going so well.

193
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,250
I'm looking after you.
What else do you need?

194
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,917
One moment, it's your passion,
and the next, it's not.

195
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,208
Do you want to waste your life?

196
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:40,417
You will soar the skies. You will do well.

197
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,375
All right.

198
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,708
Don't start sulking now.

199
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,083
Come on, man!

200
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,125
You think it's that easy?

201
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,458
That my life is a party?

202
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,542
With cops watching me at every corner?

203
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,708
It's actually very risky.

204
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,250
Don't sulk now, come on.

205
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,417
-Come on.
-Don't force me now.

206
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,250
-I'm done. Just continue.
-Come on.

207
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,875
-I'll leave.
-It's for your benefit. Come.

208
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,625
Come on. That wild cat is yours.

209
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,958
Come, you have that wild cat.

210
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,375
We'll tell her,

211
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,875
"You have Messi now."

212
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,458
And then you can make her scream.

213
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,417
"Messi...

214
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,250
Messi! Harder!"

215
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,375
Will you stop now?

216
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:12,875
Another lap?

217
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:14,667
You go ahead, I'll follow.

218
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,708
Ladies and gentlemen, our day to day life
is plagued with problems.

219
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,583
Health issues for the kids.

220
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,917
Issues of the water supply for the ladies.

221
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:54,083
Education for the kids,
getting rid of addiction too.

222
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,333
Hello.

223
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,500
Hold this.

224
00:26:57,042 --> 00:27:00,375
They are distributing clothes
to men and women.

225
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,125
They're distributing freebies to everyone.
Come on.

226
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:10,125
We will try our best
to clean the surroundings.

227
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,500
We will try to maintain
a mosquito-free environment.

228
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,917
Ladies and gentlemen,

229
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:25,583
very common household issues
like the health of our kids...

230
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,625
The performers for the party are here.

231
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:32,042
Everyone, there are two strange artists
among us.

232
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,542
They do something called rap,
and people appreciate them.

233
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,500
I welcome them on everyone's behalf.

234
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,958
LOKAAN PROGRESS CONFERENCE

235
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:55,875
Listen up

236
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,375
This is what India is going through

237
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,875
What's the use of sacrifice
Done by our leaders?

238
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,292
Corruption lurking in every corner

239
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,542
Listen, we don't need you

240
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,000
Hey, we don't need your politics

241
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,458
Enough of this deceit
You spread around the streets

242
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,708
Why don't you mention
Your sweet intentions?

243
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:16,083
Here come the elections
Your freebies are deceptions

244
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,458
Hey, we don't need...

245
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,375
Yes, sir.

246
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,833
Yes, I am doing what's necessary.

247
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:24,375
Okay.

248
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,750
What does this read?

249
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,875
"Listen to my rhythm divine."

250
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,583
Louder!

251
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,667
"Listen to my rhythm divine."

252
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,667
Now speak up.

253
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,500
What were you up to?

254
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,167
We were just performing rap.

255
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,000
Rape?

256
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,083
No, sir. Rap. We were singing a song.

257
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,792
You mean you were raping while singing.

258
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,667
Sir, it was rap.

259
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,042
Sing for me.

260
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,000
Superb!

261
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,458
Superb!

262
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,500
You are talented.

263
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,583
Get lost!

264
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,083
Listen.

265
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,917
It's my son's birthday tomorrow.

266
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:48,333
At seven o'clock.

267
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,625
Come and perform there.

268
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,208
We'll try to come, sir.

269
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:56,417
Mickey Mouse.

270
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,333
Come on!

271
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,125
I can easily get coffee delivered.

272
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,750
I don't need to make it myself.

273
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,125
It's just that, when I make it myself,

274
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,333
it feels like

275
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,333
something that...

276
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,375
at least is under my control.

277
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,292
It's nothing profound.

278
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,542
The power must have tripped. Let me check.

279
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,250
I probably haven't paid the bill.

280
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,042
No worries.

281
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,042
I've paid you for that day, right?

282
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:08,500
No, you haven't.

283
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,333
Obviously, I've paid you for the coffee.

284
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,208
Yes. You did.

285
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,625
Are you doubting me? I did pay you.

286
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,000
You did.

287
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,458
Yes, you did.

288
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:25,458
How is it?

289
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,333
It's good.

290
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,750
My first cold black coffee.

291
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,250
I would have given you a better one
if there was power.

292
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,500
Maybe not as good as your café's, but...

293
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,333
at least hot.

294
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,250
You should visit the café someday.

295
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,708
I don't step out.

296
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,500
Do you stay alone here?

297
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,167
When can we have it?

298
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,208
It was very hard to catch, you know.

299
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,750
Hey!

300
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:31,958
Catch it!

301
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,250
You idiot!

302
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,500
That was for dinner.

303
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,958
Clumsy fuck!

304
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,083
Get me my pigeon back.

305
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,250
I want to have that for dinner.

306
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,458
-My appetizer is gone.
-Where's my phone?

307
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:51,917
What?

308
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,875
My phone? The big one?

309
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,500
How would I know?

310
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,750
Atom?

311
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,000
Go ahead. He'll check everyone's pockets.

312
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,625
Speak up!

313
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,917
We don't have it.

314
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:20,958
Get lost!

315
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:22,792
Hey, you...

316
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,042
If I see my phone on any of you...

317
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:28,792
It's not with us.

318
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,500
Come, sit...

319
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,083
Who is it?

320
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:08,833
Messi. You have my phone, right?

321
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Say something.

322
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,042
Speak up.

323
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,542
I have been trying
to get in touch with you.

324
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,500
Okay, listen.

325
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,125
I need another 15. Is that possible?

326
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,417
Not me, my friend will come.

327
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,625
Wave your hand, dear. Wave it!

328
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,500
Cheers, my child.

329
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,625
May god shower you with all the happiness.

330
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,458
All of it.

331
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,500
Revel, celebrate life.

332
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,333
Rejoice!

333
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,125
I'm celebrating Jasleen's birthday today.

334
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,042
Please. Can't you get them right away?

335
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:53,833
Drink some water.

336
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:56,958
Come on, drink some water.

337
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:03,375
Your phone is ringing.

338
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,375
Oh, God! Just turn it off.

339
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,917
It's your mother.

340
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,250
It doesn't matter.

341
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,000
Just turn it off.

342
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:18,125
Just turn it off, please!

343
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,542
Do you want to eat something?

344
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,333
Do you need something?

345
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,583
Thanks, man.

346
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:22,375
My father died a long time ago.

347
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,500
Mom got married again.

348
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:33,250
I was not even aware, in a sense...

349
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,417
And suddenly some guy
began living with us in our house.

350
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:38,833
Go on...

351
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,083
Mom keeps calling me.

352
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,125
She calls a lot.

353
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,417
-That's it.
-But you don't answer?

354
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,667
No, it doesn't really matter.

355
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,917
But she's your mother.
She must be worried about you.

356
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,083
You can speak to her sometimes.

357
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,292
What happened?

358
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:04,875
Nothing.

359
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,625
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

360
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,208
I have defeated everyone here

361
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,250
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

362
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,167
“Bicky, I swear, I don't have your phone.

363
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,958
I don't have your phone."

364
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,250
Where is my phone? Tell me.

365
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,125
Speak up. Where is my phone?

366
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,500
You bloody liar!

367
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,833
Shove those bills up your ass!

368
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:07,917
Shameless fellow!

369
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,708
-Bye.
-Bye. See you later.

370
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,875
Messi?

371
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,458
Hey, Messi?

372
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,875
What's wrong?

373
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,583
What happened?

374
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:51,083
What's wrong?

375
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:53,792
Nothing.

376
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,417
Then why are you sleeping here?

377
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,833
Why are you troubling me at this hour?
Go back to sleep.

378
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,292
Why are you sleeping here?
You still mad at me?

379
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:10,667
Come back and sleep upstairs.

380
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,125
I don't want to.

381
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,375
Why? Come upstairs.

382
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
What's your problem?

383
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,792
Spit it out.

384
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:22,417
Go on.

385
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,083
Why are you sleeping here?

386
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,708
Because I want to.
I don't want to sleep on the bed.

387
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:28,958
What's gotten into you?

388
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,792
Nothing is fine. That's it.

389
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:33,250
Tell me what's wrong.

390
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,583
What do you want to hear?

391
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,083
Everything. Now, tell me.

392
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,208
That you treat me like a servant?

393
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,000
Just give Messi a few bucks and he's fine.
Do you think I am stupid?

394
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,708
You think that's my worth?

395
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:48,708
"Big brother."

396
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,458
People don't treat me well because of you.

397
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,958
Even my friends, they don't...

398
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,583
Big brother! Great!

399
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,542
"I am there for you. I care for you."
What do you do for me?

400
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:02,125
You are not my big brother.
We're just friends.

401
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,250
That's it.

402
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,167
Keep talking.

403
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,583
Tell me more.

404
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:06,875
Loving this, aren't you?

405
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:07,875
I am enjoying this.

406
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:11,333
Big brother!

407
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:13,583
You messed up my life.

408
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:17,458
I don't want to stay with you anymore.

409
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,458
Take your mattress.

410
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:21,875
Won't even let me sleep.

411
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:23,125
Just go to hell!

412
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,292
How is it, dude?

413
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,125
What the hell is this?

414
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,958
I painted a shoe.

415
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,958
The bigger the picture, the better it is.

416
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:50,875
You've painted a big shoe
on a small space.

417
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,417
Now where will you paint his face?

418
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,750
I'll manage with the space above it.

419
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,750
You idiot! We had to perform
at a birthday party because of you.

420
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,917
Are we clowns? Are we entertainers?

421
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,583
We've been together for so many years,
and you still don't get it.

422
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,417
Is this what you call a revolution?

423
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,583
Can we change the world this way?

424
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,375
Remember what Notorious BIG
and Tupac said?

425
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,417
Do you know what we are?

426
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,875
We are penniless.

427
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:36,792
And anyone can see that
just by looking at us.

428
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:41,125
But we are generous at heart,
and that reflects in our work.

429
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:42,375
Dude.

430
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:45,417
I'll reduce the size of the shoe.

431
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,292
-What's up?
-How are you?

432
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,542
Hey, Messi.

433
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,125
This is Tony. He's Rack.

434
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,750
They got the whole city buying from them.

435
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,250
They're going to supply us.

436
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:03,917
Just tell us the time and place.
We'll deliver the stuff.

437
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,375
-You guys don't deal with Bicky, right?
-Not at all.

438
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,250
I'm in a hurry, sir.

439
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:50,667
Just get in.

440
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,083
How are you?

441
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,042
I'm fine. How are you?

442
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:11,708
Wear the seatbelt.

443
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,375
I have to get off nearby.

444
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,750
I stopped doing that.

445
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:20,833
So where to, then?

446
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:21,958
I've to go, sir.

447
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,167
What do you want to have? Tea or coffee?

448
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you want beer?

449
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,667
I just had my breakfast.

450
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,917
Oh, come on.

451
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,125
I'm in a hurry, sir.

452
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:39,500
How is work?

453
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,667
Good.

454
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:44,292
Getting more clients?

455
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,000
Sir, I've quit all of that, I swear.

456
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,417
Your brother has taken over, right?

457
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,042
Your brother works for you, right?

458
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:58,208
You've stepped down, so he took over.

459
00:51:58,875 --> 00:51:59,708
Good.

460
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,333
I'll drop you. Should I take a left turn?

461
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,292
Give me my share and fuck off.

462
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,167
Quick. Give me whatever you have.

463
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:34,458
Where's the rest?

464
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:35,833
That's all I have.

465
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,083
Then let me take you
for a drive to the police station.

466
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,708
But that's all I have, sir.

467
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,125
Please let me get off.

468
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,375
Not yet. We're going for a drive.

469
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,042
I'm running late.

470
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:48,917
Why are you troubling me?

471
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,625
I've got my eye on both of you,
you and your brother.

472
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,250
One wrong move...

473
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,333
-Then I'll arrest you.
-I stopped doing it.

474
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:59,875
I told you. Why would I lie to you?

475
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:02,375
You've known me for years.
Why would I lie?

476
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:05,625
Get lost.

477
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,958
Don't let me catch you.

478
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:20,958
Hey, let me drop you home?

479
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:30,583
Where's Messi?

480
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,708
-No idea. It's been a while.
-We haven't seen him the past few days.

481
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:35,000
He hasn't gone to practice either.

482
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,708
-What about you? Have you seen him?
-No.

483
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:37,875
When did you last see him?

484
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:40,500
A couple of weeks ago.

485
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,750
I saw him with Shaggy once.

486
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,667
Wake him up.

487
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,000
Hey, Shaggy. Have you seen him?

488
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:49,125
-Get up.
-I haven't seen him for a while.

489
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,042
I didn't see him.

490
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,875
Thank God, you're here.

491
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,583
All well?

492
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:24,833
I don't have any.

493
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:32,958
I don't have any.

494
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,000
What do you mean, you don't have any?

495
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,458
The consignment hasn't arrived.

496
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,375
Bicky...

497
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:41,417
Bicky...

498
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,167
But I told you, I don't have it.

499
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,542
Bicky...

500
00:54:58,792 --> 00:54:59,958
Check your pouch.

501
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,333
No, I don't...

502
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:02,625
Bicky, please check your pouch.

503
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,958
You always have something.

504
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,583
I gave you some two days ago. Where is it?

505
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,000
Why are you behaving like this?

506
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,333
I don't have the stuff.

507
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,500
When I was throwing the stuff, I...

508
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,667
There's a bedroom upstairs.

509
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:14,125
I just slid some stuff into that room.

510
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,000
I slid some of it through the door

511
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,208
because I can't go there.

512
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:25,583
Go get it yourself.

513
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:43,500
When I go up, there are these photographs
and they are staring at me.

514
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:51,833
Jasleen's dad, he calls me up.

515
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:12,000
What are you waiting for?

516
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:18,917
Fine.

517
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,458
Don't do it. For some time, don't do it.

518
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:29,792
For as long as you can...

519
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,500
Go fuck yourself!

520
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,208
Let's leave.

521
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:43,875
Move.

522
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,375
Let go, fucker!

523
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,792
-Leave me.
-Asshole!

524
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,208
Motherfucker!

525
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:50,000
You rascal!

526
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:54,167
Now, let's do this right.

527
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,917
No waiting. We have to do it
day and night.

528
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,917
Wherever anyone demands it,

529
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,875
-they should get it.
-Yes.

530
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:00,792
-Did you get it?
-Yes.

531
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:01,708
Tell me the places.

532
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:03,542
-Andheri to Borivali?
-Siddhu will do it.

533
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,917
-BKC to the station?
-Fakir will handle it.

534
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,708
-Durwadi to Ramwadi?
-Javed.

535
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,667
-Sector six to sector seven?
-Sadma.

536
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:11,417
And that...

537
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:12,750
Holi Maidan to Kurla?

538
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,958
-Your girlfriend is there, right?
-You...

539
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,833
So obviously, you will go.

540
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:34,042
The number you have dialed is busy.

541
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,542
Please try later.

542
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:59,625
Mrs. Kunte, you can leave it there.

543
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:06,208
And you don't need to come
starting tomorrow.

544
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,042
Take this.

545
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:18,750
Are you not happy with my work?

546
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,583
It's nothing like that.

547
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,333
I'll manage.

548
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,583
Harsh, let's leave.

549
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,375
What's going on?

550
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,458
Spreading western culture?

551
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,333
Hey, fatty. Move!

552
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:52,000
-Come on, pack up. What's this?
-Hey, go on, leave. Get lost!

553
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,708
-Hey, catch him.
-Hey, wait!

554
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:56,042
-Wait.
-Catch them.

555
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,333
Sir?

556
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,833
What?

557
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,458
-Sir, there was a problem.
-What happened?

558
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,667
A group of people beat us up
at Andheri station.

559
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:20,458
Did you sing "Suck My Dick" again?

560
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,708
Actually, they were drunk...

561
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:23,792
Shut up.

562
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:25,875
Lock them up.

563
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,167
Hey, Yoku!

564
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,917
There is no "Yoku" here. Get lost.

565
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,625
-I told you to get lost!
-Hey, come out.

566
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:41,958
Get away from here.

567
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:44,083
And you, go back inside!

568
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:51,000
The cutting is done here.

569
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:52,417
Get it?

570
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,417
There is the log machine.

571
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:55,708
There as well.

572
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:41,958
Fuck it!

573
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,208
-Did you make it?
-Yes.

574
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,750
I was here for some work.

575
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,333
Can I use your bathroom?

576
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,167
You know what?

577
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,625
I felt really bad.

578
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,000
I tried calling you so many times.

579
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,833
You neither replied nor called back.

580
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,167
You like being alone.

581
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,333
You run away from everybody.

582
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,125
That's not the solution.

583
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:08,875
I got coffee for you.

584
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,542
-Listen, Atom.
-Yes.

585
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:27,667
Stay away from the one in Worli.

586
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,125
-He deals with Bicky?
-Leave it.

587
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,708
It's not about Bicky.

588
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:35,500
I have seen him with the police
a couple of times.

589
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:36,917
Keep that in mind.

590
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:40,667
Wait!

591
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:41,625
-Leave.
-Don't run.

592
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:44,333
-Wait!
-Run. Please leave.

593
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,083
-Atom, just run!
-Come back.

594
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,250
-Come back, or else...
-We didn't do anything.

595
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,208
Try to escape!

596
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,583
-Where's the stuff?
-I don't have it.

597
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,542
Hit him!

598
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:55,625
Give me the stuff.

599
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,958
What's this?

600
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:00,417
Go. Run!

601
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,083
Please leave me. I didn't do anything.

602
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,000
Just escape!

603
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:06,333
-Run. Try to escape.
-Leave me!

604
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,625
Messi!

605
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:39,500
How are you?

606
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:44,750
Give me money.

607
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:47,417
I need money.

608
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,667
I don't have any.

609
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:58,000
Bicky...

610
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,542
All of a sudden, I...

611
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,875
Give me some. I really need the money...

612
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,208
Just a little...

613
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't have any, Messi.

614
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,292
You don't get it.

615
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,625
You don't. Goons...

616
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:19,125
Goons are after me.
They are waiting outside the house.

617
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:20,792
You know...

618
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,000
They follow me everywhere.

619
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:27,000
Give me the money. Make it quick.

620
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,708
Give me the money.

621
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:35,500
Go home.

622
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,417
I will. Just give me the money first.

623
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:42,042
Give me the money.

624
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:45,917
Stop staring! Just give it to me!

625
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,083
I haven't eaten in two days.

626
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,542
Come home, I'll feed you.

627
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:54,250
I will, but give me the money first.

628
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,458
I'll give it back to you in a week.
Just give me money now.

629
01:10:58,792 --> 01:10:59,667
Give me money.

630
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,500
Just give me some money.
What are you waiting for?

631
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:08,583
Mr. Kamble is after me.
Just give me money.

632
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,542
You know how he is?

633
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:13,458
Quick. Give me money.

634
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:17,833
Give me money. I am not kidding.
Just give me some.

635
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:20,625
I swear, I'll kill you. Give me some.

636
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,500
Come on!

637
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,250
Give me money.

638
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,458
Give me money.

639
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,583
You won't?

640
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:33,833
Move.

641
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,000
I'll find it myself.

642
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,167
Let go.

643
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,208
Let go!

644
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:42,458
Give me money.

645
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,375
Give me money, or else...

646
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,708
Fuck off!

647
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:41,958
Jasleen?

648
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:20,167
Jasleen?

649
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,083
What?

650
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:26,458
What?

651
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:27,667
What will she say?

652
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:29,875
How will she say anything?

653
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,375
She can only breathe.

654
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:34,083
That's all.

655
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:40,417
There's no Jasleen now.
The only thing she can do is breathe.

656
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,083
That's it.

657
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:43,917
You understand?

658
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:46,083
That's how I live every day.

659
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:28,792
Get lost!

660
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,917
I put my trust in you.

661
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:37,625
I stood by you when no one else did.

662
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,000
And today, you make a joke out of me?

663
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,333
Stop fooling me.

664
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:56,833
What are you waiting for?

665
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,208
Get out! Get lost.

666
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,333
I don't even want to see your face again.

667
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,500
I only came to sing my new rap to you.

668
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,083
I am going for a hunt

669
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:28,667
Think before you mess with me

670
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,292
Come, sing along with me

671
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,708
Standing at the roadside shop

672
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,417
I am all prepared

673
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:41,250
I can read your lies

674
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:45,875
Touch my boys and I'll rip your chest

675
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,250
I went there...

676
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,833
It's bleeding... Blood.

677
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,625
Wait here. Don't go...

678
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:01,833
Just wait, I...

679
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,917
Don't go forward, it's dangerous.
Don't go...

680
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:10,500
Do you want to eat this?

681
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,833
Messi?

682
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,917
Yes?

683
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,125
What...

684
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:18,958
Hold this. Hold it.

685
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,667
I'll come, but I have too much work.

686
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,625
Take these tablets.

687
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:29,125
You'll be all better.

688
01:22:30,167 --> 01:22:32,375
What are you saying? Take it.

689
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:33,833
Bye, see you.

690
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,958
Emergency ward?

691
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:32,708
Worli.

692
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:34,625
Koliwada.

693
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:53,042
Yoku BIG, chant the name

694
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:57,250
In the jungles of Dharavi, my hunt begins

695
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,750
Thump your drums and hear me sing

696
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,583
My war cry, the dawn of my game

697
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:04,125
I stand where you see me, lower your eyes

698
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:07,500
I am all prepared, I can read your lies

699
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,125
This is my sky, this my nest

700
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,208
Touch my boys and I'll rip your chest

701
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:12,833
Rip your chest

702
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,500
Rip your chest

703
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:16,167
Rip your chest

704
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:53,833
My words are true

705
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:54,958
Listen to me

706
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,542
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

707
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:37,083
Fear me, I am far worse
Than what you have seen

708
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,750
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

709
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,333
Fear me, I am far worse
Than what you have seen

710
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:43,500
Who stands tall here?

711
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:44,708
And who takes the fall here?

712
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:46,125
Who is guilty of their sins?

713
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:48,375
This city engulfs me unyielding
Their talks are all deceit

714
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:49,625
All tricks learned in the circus

715
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:50,917
Unworthy of living

716
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,458
What a pointless reality

717
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,208
Lion of this street,
I am the undisputed king

718
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:57,917
Fear me, I am far worse
Than what you have seen

719
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,792
Switch to Tamil, go

720
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:08,083
One, two, three, four!

721
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:11,542
This game of life, what do I know of it?
I am just a kid playing on the street

722
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,375
The land is not your place
You were born to fly

723
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:14,542
I cut my wings through the sky

724
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:15,792
Reborn with my song

725
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:17,125
Behold! This is my revolution

726
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:19,458
Then I forget my resolve
Blowing the smokes out

727
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:21,083
My words are the sickle in this zoo

728
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:23,625
I am the only winner
In the garbage that I belong to

729
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,250
Keep your flow, it has wasted my life

730
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,833
I speak cleanly, our ways are unlike

731
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:30,167
Headbanger, heartbreaker

732
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,417
Corpse-maker, boon-giver

733
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,125
In the praise of BIG and Tupac
I sing and salute

734
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:36,667
My guardian angel has left
Now poison is my pursuit

735
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,958
Poison is my way out

736
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:39,292
Poison is my way out

737
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,708
Yoku BIG, chant the name

738
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,917
In the jungles of Dharavi, my hunt begins

739
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,167
Thump your drums and hear me sing

740
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,417
My war cry, the dawn of my game

741
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,000
I stand where you see me, lower your eyes

742
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,583
I am all prepared, I can read your lies

743
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:08,917
This is my sky, this is my nest

744
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,333
Touch my boys and I'll rip your chest

745
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,917
Touch my boys and I'll rip your chest

746
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,375
Touch my boys and I'll rip your chest

747
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:17,708
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

748
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:20,417
Fear me, I am far worse
Than what you have seen

749
01:33:20,542 --> 01:33:23,042
Lion of this zoo, I am the undisputed king

750
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:25,792
Fear me, I am far worse
Than what you have seen
