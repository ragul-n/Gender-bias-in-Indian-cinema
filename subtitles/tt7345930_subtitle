<font color="#ffff00"><b>Subtiltles Presented by Samaksh - Varsha - Pankaj Jain</b></font>

2
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,240
Reach at 7 AM sharp in the morning.

3
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,395
You've just started, huh?

4
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,241
I'll go take a bath and come!

5
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,874
Don't touch!

6
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,645
S.l. Joseph and his child succumbed
to death with just one strike.

7
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,347
Just like what we found
during the previous murder...,

8
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,339
He leads me beside
peaceful waters.

9
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,358
God commands Abraham to offer
his son Isaac as a sacrifice.

10
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,047
Let the one who does right
continue to do right;

11
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,963
I mean, tea, coffee, juice, soft
drinks or something like that?

12
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,980
To be frank, I consider myself lucky
to assist someone like you, sir.

13
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,512
and existing contradictions.

14
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,375
I'm silent, because I
have the responsibility!

15
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,023
Show some more responsibility!

16
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,578
Can't get through to him.

17
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,807
Johnny sir is a workaholic.

18
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,119
But you always keep ignoring them!

19
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,966
He'll just keep going around.
He won't shoot him.

20
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,191
You...

21
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,714
they're planning to hand over
this case to some big shot.

22
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,766
'By then, the killer would kill
everyone and finish his job'.

23
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,937
They're trying to bring someone
smarter, by humiliating us.

24
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,106
This is the problem. How is this
guy going to come up in life?

25
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,100
You go & find out if it's true!

26
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,113
If you're his fan, go and
blow trumpets for him!

27
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,930
I can see him with my own eyes.

28
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,862
If God performs a miracle,
you would recognize me.

29
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,721
There, near the hall,
the Satan's box is placed.

30
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,297
The Lord is showing me that an
X-Ray certificate is kept there.

31
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,982
Killer, stop your miracles right now.

32
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,359
and let the holy person
continue to be holy.

33
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,804
I caught him from the
junction next to the crime scene.

34
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,373
Where is Johnny?
- I don't know.

35
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,966
There is no sin in Him.

36
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,537
And how are you going to
source such a huge amount?

37
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,810
You can never release the child by sourcing
such a huge amount, within the given time.

38
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,110
Let's request them to
reduce the amount.

39
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,561
No.

40
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,150
The Nigerian.

41
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,062
But sir...

42
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,525
Derrick Abraham.

43
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,514
Where is he?

44
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,025
Have you seen the English
movie 'Training Day'?

45
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,054
3 people each were killed
during the two incidents.

46
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,693
The bloodstains used to jot down
the numbers are AB Negative.

47
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,244
While we're investigating a case,
I can't talk about my family, right?

48
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,944
I have some concepts about
the woman I want to marry.

49
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,786
Based on the letters, the killer also
belongs to a Christian background.

50
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,321
- Aren't you a Christian?
- Yes.

51
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,166
We had told this to the officer
who came before you too.

52
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,995
I can understand
what you're asking.

53
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,916
' Oh Redeemer of the weak'

54
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,759
' At the city of Betlehem '

55
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:51,044
' As a candle that lights up in darkness '

56
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,639
' Oh Redeemer of the weak'

57
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,445
' At the city of Betlehem '

58
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,194
' Oh Lamp of Love '

59
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,547
' Teach us Your wise words '

60
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:10,888
' As we tread the difficult
paths of Golgotha hill '

61
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:19,000
' The merciful Shepherd who came
to absolve us of our sins '

62
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,663
' Oh Jesus '

63
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,481
' Oh Jesus '

64
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:56,128
Come to Me, all those
toiling and being burdened,

65
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,088
and no one knows the
Father except the Son,

66
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,774
Religions and Revelations can
be construed in many ways!

67
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,431
It's said in the Bible, right Father?

68
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,229
Sir, did you find any clue about the
culprit, or the motive for the murders?

69
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,383
No more murders will happen.

70
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,369
.. a new age Abraham who
received the Revelation of God,

71
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,795
We couldn't find any provocation
like some vendetta,

72
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,139
10 year old Amelia didn't
participate in prayers in school.

73
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,189
A kind of self-imposed ostracization.

74
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,141
When I checked the admission register,

75
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,458
I found that all those
who were murdered,

76
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,937
None of their houses had
prayer rooms or crucifixes,

77
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,800
and killed by an extreme
believer or a blind believer.

78
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:10,155
A kind of delusion that he's the
incarnate of God, chosen by God himself.

79
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,687
There was a guy in California
long back - Charles Manson.

80
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,423
There will be such killers who go crazy
with faith all around the world.

81
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,949
We need to find out why he's
targeting ten people precisely.

82
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,724
Sniffer dogs won't reach
anywhere, sniffing for clues.

83
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,352
I need informations of all the people who
have proclaimed themselves as atheists,

84
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,231
If we find out who that is,
we can nab the killer easily.

85
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,971
The Revelation you
received was not from God.

86
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,035
were atheists or non-believers!

87
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,911
All my actions were deliberate,
while I was fully in my senses.

88
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,049
they insulted God.

89
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,437
Glory be to Jesus.

90
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,352
I will complete my sacrifice.

91
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,914
You are answerable, sir.
- You owe us an explanation.

92
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,798
As the Government and Home Ministry
are under tremendous pressure,

93
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,066
Your brother is here.

94
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,933
He is no one to me!

95
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,766
Consider this is as a payback
for whatever you've done.

96
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,200
- Yes. Come.
- Yeah.

97
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,874
Even if I wish for it really badly,
my brother won't take bribes.

98
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,174
I shouldn't have asked!

99
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:02,987
Who's that girl?

100
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,285
And, what did you tell Philip?

101
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,574
Sit down.

102
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,392
Does your family know that
you both are going out?

103
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,861
- For whom?
- Both of us.

104
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,351
You really love Philip, right?

105
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:32,375
' The glint of your smile,
like jasmine petals '

106
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:39,468
' Your sweet words are like the
fresh drops of rain '

107
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:52,619
' There's a desire in our mind,
to become one '

108
00:46:54,211 --> 00:47:00,480
' I'm lovelorn, like a
broken piece of a cloud '

109
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,690
' Oh my beauty '

110
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:19,922
' Oh my beauty '

111
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:34,760
' Oh my beauty '

112
00:47:55,772 --> 00:48:01,392
' Rain or sunshine?
I didn't bother '

113
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,763
' I gave you my heart '

114
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:15,512
' Are your eyes dancing
within my heart? '

115
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:28,644
' Where did you go,
without listening to me? '

116
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,005
' Don't go away from me '

117
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:10,567
' Oh my beauty '

118
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,753
- Yes, sir.
- Derrick...

119
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,800
- What happened?
- I don't know anything.

120
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,036
Come.

121
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,024
lchaya!

122
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,374
Hey! Leave him!

123
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,950
I must take your son
into custody, sir.

124
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,025
Derrick, please!

125
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,361
Your kids' friends circle
is dangerous, sir.

126
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,978
From the time we came to know,
his mother is really depressed.

127
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,589
Exempt both of them from this.

128
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,400
Oh dear!

129
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:23,991
My son!

130
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,851
Forging fake ID documents.

131
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,063
You know, IB, RAW, CBI...

132
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,930
But if you look at it in another angle,
it's right too!

133
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,369
But we sent him with a
different identity;

134
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,297
Sometimes, you will have to help
people, at certain instances.

135
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,290
I don't even have to
talk so much to you.

136
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,997
Likewise, how did all the circumstantial
evidence turn against Philip?

137
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:12,903
No. I didn't do it.

138
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,330
Aleena complained about
it to her parents.

139
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,516
And we used to fight
once in a while...

140
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,113
Had you asked for financial
help from Aleena?

141
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,067
debts to be repaid.

142
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,968
and you used to
beat her as well, right?

143
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:11,214
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '

144
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:21,275
' Not bidding goodbye,
all alone'

145
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:31,906
' Falling into the fire within my heart,
all our past dreams have turned to ashes'

146
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:42,778
' On the stone-cross of love,
relationships are like a wound that hurts'

147
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:54,804
' On the stone-cross of love,
relationships are like a wound that hurts'

148
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,703
There are some dogs which bite & rip apart
the prey, when they are sent to hunt.

149
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,190
They have put you in charge
of this investigation,

150
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,928
they will be able to claim that
you did it using your influence,

151
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,199
When they say that I killed the girl
I loved more than anything in this world..

152
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,089
You had nothing to do in this, right?

153
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,918
Even if the world is against you,

154
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,174
As you said, if Philip was
someone she trusted so much...

155
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,157
There are investigation agencies
above you as well, right?

156
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,162
it needn't be true
that he did it.

157
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,894
You're talking with the pre-conceived
notion that your brother is right.

158
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:09,933
You were the one who concluded,

159
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,950
You said that she left because he
called her, on the day she died.

160
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,290
Must have been a call requesting
to meet her in person.

161
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,624
'It hurts when the person that
made you feel special yesterday,

162
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,128
is abandoning me today.

163
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,050
If she had felt that he is going to
hurt her, wouldn't she say that first?

164
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,231
can't he reach a decision that it's not
enough and that she must be killed?

165
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,870
I don't feel any mismatch here, sir.

166
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,409
the cause of death was a breathing
difficulty while drowning in water.

167
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,158
We didn't find any fingerprints
from the steering wheel.

168
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:09,512
And the hair strands found from
Aleena's right hand, belong to Philip.

169
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,072
No, Madam.
The investigation is still going on.

170
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,017
Sir.

171
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,966
I have taught him to see every
woman through that perspective.

172
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,387
I was asked to sever
ties with my own blood!

173
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,049
But all the evidence is against you.

174
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,973
I had boozed quite
a lot that night.

175
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,483
Yes.

176
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:08,817
She had told her parents that she's going
to meet you, after she got your call.

177
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,515
Do you usually booze so much?

178
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,062
Everyone was there.

179
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,449
Nizam lkka, Arun and Salman!

180
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,160
It doesn't matter whether he
had boozed or used drugs then.

181
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:20,468
But...

182
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,778
There's proof that his mobile phone was
at your place for the whole night.

183
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,101
and came back around 4 AM in the
morning, took his mobile & left.

184
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,675
How will I face everyone else now?

185
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,048
You can do it!

186
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,542
lchaya!

187
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,222
Sir, the charge-sheet is ready.

188
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,819
DNA reports, circumstantial
evidence and witness statements...

189
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,718
Philip's car has been captured on
the CCTV footage at Beach Road.

190
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,642
When we were young,
we used to sleep on the same bed.

191
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,403
In that, he was the policeman
and I was the thief.

192
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,380
In the story...

193
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:51,909
No. An officer like you,
shouldn't have asked that.

194
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:29,917
Your Honour,

195
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,157
The girl who loved him & trusted
him more than her own life,

196
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,994
for the maximum punishment
prescribed by law.

197
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,794
The prosecution has been able to prove
beyond doubt that the accused is guilty.

198
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,777
The Court also congratulates
the Public Prosecutor

199
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:00,623
And you did it!

200
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:19,121
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '

201
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:50,872
' The memories that remain
in life, are sobbing '

202
01:11:52,308 --> 01:12:00,955
' As we see each other,
we are growing further apart '

203
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:12,946
' Where are the moments in which
we can see the light of truth? '

204
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:45,684
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '

205
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:56,128
' Not bidding goodbye,
all alone'

206
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:06,896
' Falling into the fire within my heart,
all our past dreams have turned to ashes'

207
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:17,309
'Relationships are like a wound that
hurts, on the stone-cross of love'

208
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:29,263
'Relationships are like a wound that
hurts, on the stone-cross of love'

209
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:43,470
It's true that our families will
suffer for the misdeeds that we do.

210
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,009
I thought why God is
crucifying me alone.

211
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,516
As 'lchaya'.

212
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,053
...I want to confess it to you.

213
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,015
- It's all pure luck, right?
- Of course!

214
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,792
Let's go meet her after this party.

215
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,380
- I'll be right back.
- Hey!

216
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,471
- Let me talk..
- You pervert!

217
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,038
She's dead, man!

218
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,036
Bloody swine plucked
out my hair...

219
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,032
We didn't do that while
we were in our senses.

220
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:57,359
It's always like this.
Don't drag me into this.

221
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:10,179
Diana, this is not the time
to take revenge for the past.

222
01:21:28,585 --> 01:21:30,450
What new evidence
have you found?

223
01:22:11,728 --> 01:22:14,413
I trusted your words,
more than my Philip.

224
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:32,441
You do whatever you want!

225
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:41,321
...you won't be alive.

226
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:33,030
Initially, he didn't want to meet you.

227
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,407
Didn't I tell you that I didn't do it?

228
01:24:23,326 --> 01:24:24,930
I feel vengeful when I see you!

229
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,128
You tortured me, without even
considering me as your brother.

230
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:54,116
It's the courage to finish you!

231
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,351
He's in jail for a kidnapping case.

232
01:25:33,563 --> 01:25:36,748
I had pleaded with him to
forgive my son just once.

233
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:48,726
I would have forgiven him if he proved
to me that he did something for me.

234
01:25:55,485 --> 01:25:58,318
If you help me...
I will also help you in return.

235
01:27:33,516 --> 01:27:36,667
From there, we will make the
arrangements for you to fly out.

236
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:43,159
He's completely all right, it seems.

237
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,591
After it's over,
you can escape to Nepal.

238
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:10,117
Yet...

239
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:01,799
...Philip wasn't the murderer; and
that Arun & Salman were behind it.

240
01:32:10,793 --> 01:32:13,102
Revenge. That's the only
thing on his mind now.

241
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:15,458
- Give protection to
Derrick and Arun. - Sir.

242
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,239
I don't know what kind of protection
I should arrange for you.

243
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:58,594
The decision must be to
shoot him at sight, right?

244
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:09,339
Otherwise, you'll finish him, right?

245
01:33:20,563 --> 01:33:22,201
I must be either the
prey or the hunter.

246
01:33:40,616 --> 01:33:42,447
Look! It's quite funny.

247
01:36:41,663 --> 01:36:42,482
Move!

248
01:37:22,638 --> 01:37:24,913
It's the CCTV footage from
the supermarket, sir.

249
01:37:32,414 --> 01:37:34,188
They are all so vindictive.

250
01:37:42,558 --> 01:37:44,514
To hide, and to track
Derrick sir's movements.

251
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:55,134
His main job now is abusing and hitting the
policemen who're standing guard to him.

252
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,385
Bloody police swine!

253
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,034
He has been shot on the head.

254
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,396
Let me see the body once.

255
01:39:25,494 --> 01:39:26,313
It's SP Sir.

256
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:53,140
Tell me the matter, sir.

257
01:40:01,797 --> 01:40:04,345
I'm not saying that you should
get ready for an operation.

258
01:40:13,742 --> 01:40:16,256
...and some people are putting a price
for a child's life using my name.

259
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:38,593
Don't keep the past in your mind.

260
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:50,151
Didn't you get anyone else
other than this drunkard?

261
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,853
Whatever you say, I can't
let this drunkard do this.

262
01:41:09,765 --> 01:41:14,065
But now, there's no one who can
save our child, other than him.

263
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:24,395
they are demanding that
he should go to them.

264
01:41:34,222 --> 01:41:35,507
You should deal this somehow.

265
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:57,061
...no one will have such a huge
amount as liquid cash with them.

266
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:21,348
Someone who precisely knows that you have
loads of cash with you, is behind this.

267
01:42:28,443 --> 01:42:31,048
Pay the money you have with you,
and try to save the kid somehow.

268
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:42,150
- I am ready.
- So much cash...

269
01:43:43,418 --> 01:43:45,557
All the phone calls I received
were from a satellite phone.

270
01:43:53,128 --> 01:43:56,222
That means, this is not an operation we
can do based on a pre-constructed plan.

271
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,066
I don't want anyone
trying out any heroism!

272
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:28,402
How long will you escape by making the
police stand guard all around you?

273
01:45:06,368 --> 01:45:07,414
He has escaped from the jail...

274
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:17,103
Keeping a safe distance.
- Sir.

275
01:47:05,153 --> 01:47:08,077
...to attend the
Holy Qurbana on Sundays.

276
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:19,873
Here, you've promised them several
times that you will protect me.

277
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,048
Do you remember this place?

278
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:11,968
When I had to stay away from you for
a short while for the first time,

279
01:48:46,387 --> 01:48:50,278
For your brother who trusted you,
who loved you more than his own life,

280
01:48:58,066 --> 01:48:58,703
Stop here.

281
01:49:19,254 --> 01:49:20,323
Accelerate at 120.

282
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,934
Then just leave the place.

283
01:49:47,315 --> 01:49:50,034
...that is to shut up and do
exactly what I ask you to do.

284
01:51:35,823 --> 01:51:36,642
Oh my God!

285
01:51:36,858 --> 01:51:39,019
Where's the cash you took from the
waste box? - We don't have any cash, sir.

286
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:46,134
Some guy came and told us to go around the
waste box at sharp 2 PM & reach Lulu Mall.

287
01:51:54,676 --> 01:51:55,961
Sir, didn't you ask
us to follow you?

288
01:52:05,486 --> 01:52:07,465
And check all vehicles.
Alert all stations. - Okay sir.

289
01:52:13,594 --> 01:52:16,108
When we were all running with our
tails on fire, where the hell were you?

290
01:52:34,716 --> 01:52:38,254
I requested to meet all of you,
to narrate a story to all of you!

291
01:52:47,829 --> 01:52:50,070
...is a story I reached through
certain speculations of mine,

292
01:53:09,417 --> 01:53:11,157
To Derrick sir who loved
you & then cheated you,

293
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:22,608
Listen to what I have
to say, completely.

294
01:53:41,783 --> 01:53:43,034
you let him out of the jail.

295
01:53:43,384 --> 01:53:44,612
No! You let him
escape from the jail.

296
01:53:52,627 --> 01:53:53,673
That's what I'm coming to.

297
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:04,793
My duty was only to
find Philip Abraham.

298
01:54:14,315 --> 01:54:15,270
Where is my Allen?

299
01:55:16,711 --> 01:55:17,530
Don't worry, Madam.

300
01:55:27,388 --> 01:55:29,162
Isn't his whole life a failure, man?

301
01:55:37,632 --> 01:55:38,963
All of us are being fooled.

302
01:57:34,782 --> 01:57:35,601
That money...

303
01:57:45,593 --> 01:57:47,322
Someone who came in those cars...

304
01:57:55,336 --> 01:57:57,440
That money will reach its
deserving hands safely.

305
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:27,658
A play that Isaac sir operated,
upon Derrick sir's command.

306
01:58:35,843 --> 01:58:38,710
The one who taught the younger brother to
shoot without causing any major injury

307
01:59:07,575 --> 01:59:09,349
Derrick sir, who's
such a good shooter;

308
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:22,080
My first suspicion arose from the tyre
prints I found near Salman's body.

309
01:59:28,696 --> 01:59:30,436
...and they were shot
dead at point blank...

310
02:01:02,423 --> 02:01:05,221
...because sir's shoe-prints
were already imprinted there.

311
02:01:12,566 --> 02:01:15,023
...and confirmed that it was
indeed sir's shoe-prints.

312
02:01:23,244 --> 02:01:24,347
The phone calls between them?

313
02:02:06,253 --> 02:02:07,538
That's why I told Madam,

314
02:02:16,263 --> 02:02:18,094
Where will he hide this Philip?

315
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,934
So he scr***d us, right?

316
02:02:47,661 --> 02:02:49,993
There would be so many similar
tyres & shoes, right?

317
02:03:09,783 --> 02:03:11,922
When you all tried to destroy
him through loopholes in law,

318
02:03:19,893 --> 02:03:21,201
Abraham's descendant!

319
02:04:01,769 --> 02:04:02,929
It's time for us to leave.

320
02:06:26,747 --> 02:06:28,578
I don't care if he's
Abraham's descendant!

321
02:06:37,357 --> 02:06:40,076
There's a ritual where the marsh is
destroyed, to destroy the mosquitoes.

322
02:06:59,813 --> 02:07:01,383
Finally, a chance to see you victorious!

323
02:07:11,692 --> 02:07:13,262
When you feel that you are too smart,

324
02:07:34,815 --> 02:07:37,033
Innocent children are going astray.

325
02:07:47,761 --> 02:07:49,774
Glory be to Jesus!

326
02:08:10,217 --> 02:08:11,912
Glory be to Him,
now and forever!
