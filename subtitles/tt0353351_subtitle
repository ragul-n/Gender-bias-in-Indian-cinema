1
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,446
Who's around...? Who...?

2
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,448
Who's around...? Who...?

3
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:46,439
What shadows are these?

4
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,449
A fog envelops all

5
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,448
A strange face on
this dark night..

6
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,448
The sight of which
takes your life away

7
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,442
A fog envelopes all

8
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,449
A fog envelopes all

9
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,447
Help! ls someone there...?

10
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,446
Help!

11
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,446
Help!

12
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,448
Let me go! Leave me alone, I say!

13
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,443
Get him!

14
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,444
Leave me, I say leave me.

15
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,443
Cut it.

16
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,444
Good job buddy.

17
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,446
Thank you..

18
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,776
Sameer, you were amazing

19
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,445
I think this ad is going
to turn out great

20
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,946
Really?
- What is it? - Oh no! . - Lets go.

21
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,442
Something's fishy.. fishy!
Everything's fishy!

22
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:14,442
So many pictures and not
a single nice face?

23
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,774
My God!

24
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:19,446
Girl, girl, girl..

25
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,776
Girl, girl, girl..

26
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,445
Girl?
- Yes. Girl

27
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,778
A girl whose picture I can
publish on the cover..

28
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,042
...of my magazine Nayaa Chehra

29
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,445
You have pictures of so many girls
lying before you, Mr Vaswani

30
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,447
Choose one of them. Each one is
more beautiful than the other

31
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,776
This isn't beauty, you moron

32
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,437
I know what real beauty is

33
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,447
Her hair ought to be
like Rani Mukharjee's

34
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,774
Her eyes ought to be
like Aishwarya Rai's

35
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,441
Red lips, like Kareena Kapoor's

36
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,778
And a lovely small nose
like Urmila Matondkar's

37
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:57,450
I wait for you to arrive..

38
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:04,446
I pine, so you will arrive

39
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,441
I pine..

40
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,442
When will you come?

41
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,449
I pine, so you will arrive

42
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:27,118
I pine, so you will arrive

43
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,941
A sweet pain awakens
in my heart..

44
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,446
There's a pining in my body

45
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,451
The fires of passion..
rage in my heart

46
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,777
A sweet pain awakens
in my heart..

47
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,439
There's a pining in my body

48
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,440
The fires of passion..
rage in my heart

49
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,449
A thousand desires will be
fulfilled when you arrive

50
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,440
I pine.. when will you come?

51
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,774
I wait..

52
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:54,439
For you to arrive

53
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,779
My hopes soar.. as
high as the skies

54
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:40,450
But the world mocks the
language of youth

55
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,779
My hopes soar.. as
high as the skies

56
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:55,442
But the world mocks the
language of youth

57
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,440
Every moment I spend in the
hope that you will come

58
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,440
I pine.. when will you come?

59
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,447
I wait..

60
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:18,442
For you to arrive

61
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,440
I pine.. when will you come?

62
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,440
I pine.. when will you come?

63
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,440
I pine.. when will you come?

64
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:47,783
I pine.. when will you come?

65
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,776
Simran..

66
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,442
Oh my God! This is my photograph

67
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,774
This is my photograph.

68
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,039
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

69
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,443
What happened?

70
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,446
Read that newspaper later, Uncle.
Take a look at this magazine first

71
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,446
Wow! What a beautiful picture.

72
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,444
This is a lovely picture of yours

73
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,449
This is the picture those
guys took! - Exactly

74
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,436
How dare they put my photo in print!

75
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:42,445
If I don't have them sent to
prison, I won't be proud of myself!

76
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,446
I'll telephone the
Inspector right now

77
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,781
Think of the devil.. and here he is

78
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,038
He was the just the
one we were missing

79
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,773
Come on in, Ashutosh

80
00:12:55,933 --> 00:13:03,442
How often have I told you at least
respect the uniform I wear?

81
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:09,445
Rise. And salute Inspector Ashutosh

82
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,950
Oh shut up! You look more of a
thug than a police inspector

83
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:20,446
Look who's talking!

84
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,943
Sit down and have some breakfast.
- Let's have some nice breakfast

85
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,446
Please stop talking and
leave with me right now

86
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,444
Right now...? Where to?

87
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,448
To teach this loafer a lesson.
- This is no loafer..

88
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,447
It's a female and I'll set her right

89
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,446
It's you! It's a lovely picture

90
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,446
You look very beautiful.

91
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,446
That's what I've been
trying to tell her

92
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,447
What will you tell me?
It's a crime..

93
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,448
To photograph a girl
without her consent!

94
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,777
To publish it in a magazine
against her permission..

95
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,109
Is a bigger crime!

96
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:06,448
Where is they...? Where
are the loafers!

97
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,446
Come with me..
- What happened?

98
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,446
Come on.
- But what has happened.

99
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,447
They are the loafers
who took my pictures

100
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,446
HI.
- Oh Hi!

101
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:24,442
Hi, hi!
- You too. - What is it kid?

102
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,776
Can't you see such a senior
Inspector standing before you?

103
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't be harsh on him, Uncle.
It was he who took the pictures

104
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,446
Him...?

105
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,448
Well hero...? You appear
to be a decent chap

106
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:48,445
And you do such third-rate things?
You know who she is?

107
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,941
She's Simran Malhotra..

108
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,446
The leading industrialist
Rajan Malhotra's niece

109
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,446
You took her pictures
without her consent..

110
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,440
And had them published in a magazine

111
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:10,116
For this crime, I'm
here to arrest you

112
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,773
Excuse me.. one moment

113
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,940
My friend he's too good, too good.

114
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,446
Great style!

115
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,776
Look at his personality.
- His whiskers! They're sexy!

116
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,443
What rubbish are you talking?

117
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,444
You don't know his worth!

118
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,778
She won't know, sir. Familiarity
breeds contempt

119
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,439
Wow! That's well said

120
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,778
Absolutely Sir. Only a connoisseur
knows a true gem.

121
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,940
A true gem...? Fine saying.
I love quotable quotes

122
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,446
Uncle..
- Let me talk to them

123
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,777
What are you talking about?
What gem? What connoisseur?

124
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,447
He's the true gem and
we re the connoisseurs

125
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,446
I knew it the moment I saw him, boss

126
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,448
Yes, he's going to play the hero
in our next ad film. The hero!

127
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,440
The man in the uniform!

128
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,946
You can't call a hero your uncle...
It'll ruin his image

129
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:23,778
They're flattering you and stopping
you from doing your duty, Uncle!

130
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,110
Flattering me...?
- Yes, flattering you!

131
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:34,115
You guys can't flatter me and
stop me from doing my duty!

132
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,777
Exactly! Exactly! That's just the
line you've got to say to the villain!

133
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,440
While you speak the line,
you've got to..

134
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,447
Pull out your revolver

135
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,446
Please, sir! Just once.
- You guys..

136
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,447
Can't prevent me from doing my duty!

137
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,436
Wow! Give him a big hand!

138
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,446
This is amazing!

139
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,448
I came here to arrest them and
they've given me a part in a film!

140
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,947
Uncle, you haven't scolded them!
- How will I scold them?

141
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,446
They're nice boys. How
could I scold them?

142
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,778
Was rightly said, When God
gives, He really gives

143
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,937
The hero! The man in the uniform!

144
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,444
Forget it, Simran.
- Shut up, Kajal

145
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,943
Hey listen to me clearly, I'm going
to destroy you.

146
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,775
I'll have you sent to prison.
- Let's go

147
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:47,448
I'll file a suit against you.
Should you not publish an apology..

148
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,779
In the magazine in
the next 24 hours..

149
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,938
...I'll be the worst yet.
You get that?

150
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,172
Let's go, Kajal

151
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,781
You can't be bad at all, Simran.
You're very sweet

152
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,444
Hi Buddy!

153
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,445
Here you are.
- What is it?

154
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,777
The apology. Simran wants
it published tomorrow

155
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,446
What are you doing?

156
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,940
Sameer this..

157
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,448
Once my plan succeeds, I'll have
Simran eating out of my hands

158
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:45,038
We won't need any apologies then.
- Really? So what's your plan?

159
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,446
When a girl leaves her home,
she always carries a purse

160
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,448
All right. So?
- Maybe Simran carries one too

161
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:58,944
There will come this thief who will
snatch the bag and run away with it

162
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:03,038
Won't she raise an alarm if
the thief runs away with it?

163
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,107
That's when the hero makes
his entry. Me, that is

164
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,446
I don't know let's go in.

165
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,941
We might get it.

166
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,948
There are those girls. And
this is your hour of test

167
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:46,113
Prove it that you are good
at bag-lifting too!

168
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:51,443
Pinch the bag! Go on!

169
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,774
And both must have been caught.

170
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,440
Actually you are right.

171
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,446
Something like this
must have happened.

172
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,037
Moron.
- Excuse me.

173
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,902
What do you think of this purse?
- It's nice

174
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,446
It's yours. Bye.

175
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,435
Hey you. Thief!

176
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,113
Somebody please catch him. Thief!

177
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,978
Thief!

178
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,440
He's going to get lynched!

179
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,772
I'm so happy you came, Sameer

180
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,973
Or the public of Bombay would
have given me a thrashing

181
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,638
You're still getting
a thrashing, my boy

182
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,777
Not from the public, however.
From the police

183
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:25,039
From the frying pan, into the fire!

184
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:31,772
Sir, I'm not a thief. Believe me..

185
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:37,442
I have never stolen in
my life! That purse..

186
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,777
I whacked for the heck of it.
- I see

187
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,781
And I've thrown you in the lock-up
just for the heck of it

188
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,780
Bloody tricksters! Haven't you
a new trick up your sleeve?

189
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:54,440
Don't you have another role for me?
- Let's forget the past, please

190
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:58,445
The kid is not to blame.
I'm the one to blame

191
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,446
He stole Simran's purse at my
behest. I'm the real culprit, sir

192
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:07,104
Please let him go!
- Constable.. Yes, sir.

193
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,638
Set him free

194
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,440
And throw this guy in.
- What have I done, sir?

195
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,781
The hero in the uniform! You
take me for a fool? Go on!

196
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,712
You've come to the right place.
- Never.

197
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,971
Don't ever set these loafers free!

198
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:31,437
Kajal, please make
Simran see reason

199
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,604
What will she say to Simran?

200
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,972
You can never turn an ass into a cow

201
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,970
You are guilty and you
will be punished

202
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:45,448
I'm in love with her, sir. If
falling In love ls a crime..

203
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,446
I'm indeed guilty! I'm a criminal!

204
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,443
Love ?
- Yes

205
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,442
Love...? My foot! Come Kajal.

206
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,644
Simran I love you.

207
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,774
I love you.. hear that?
- The whole world heard it

208
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:11,976
As someone truly said, you
don't fall in love..

209
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,774
It happens on its own

210
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,614
Love? You don't fall in love
just like that, do you?

211
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,772
Don't you feel sorry for
them at all, Simran?

212
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:26,779
Sit here and mourn if you're
really sorry for them

213
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,779
Why don't you admit that you're
in love with him too?

214
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,777
Why would I fall in love with him?

215
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,440
Because he's in love with you

216
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:46,613
You mean.. he was
speaking the truth?

217
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,771
Why ask me? Ask your own heart

218
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,941
My sweetheart is here, my God..

219
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,905
She has taken over
my heart, my God

220
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,642
My sweetheart is here, my God..

221
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:03,442
She has taken over
my heart, my God

222
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,448
My heart is aflutter,
I'll sway, I'll sing

223
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:12,438
My sweetheart is here, my God..

224
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,448
She has taken over
my heart, my God

225
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:20,442
My sweetheart is here, my God..

226
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,609
She has taken over
my heart, my God

227
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:28,782
My heart is aflutter,
I'll sway, I'll sing

228
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:16,438
What's in your heart?
- I'm not telling you

229
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,607
Come closer to me..
- I'm staying away from you

230
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:24,647
What ways are these...?
- I'm going to torment you

231
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,910
Heed my call..
- I'm not getting any closer

232
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:33,438
Mark my words. I'm going
to have you some day

233
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,605
Lay off, crazy one.
Stop bothering me

234
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,772
I'm going to stop you, I'm
going to bother you, my love

235
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,442
My sweetheart is here, my God

236
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,614
She has taken over
my heart, my God

237
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:55,441
My sweetheart is here, my God

238
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,909
What have you lost?
- Your beauty has left me stunned

239
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:03,438
What's special about me?
- You are the one I love

240
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:07,604
What sort of love is this?
- I've forgotten the world for you

241
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,840
What great thing have you done? -
I've given you a place in my heart

242
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,440
Listen my dear.. what's
the great hurry?

243
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:20,604
Let me have it from you..
what have you on mind?

244
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:24,909
You and I already belong
to each other

245
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,774
My sweetheart is here, my God

246
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,442
He has taken over my heart, my God

247
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:37,442
My sweetheart is here, my God

248
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:41,613
He has taken over my heart, my God

249
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:46,443
My heart is aflutter..
I'll sway, I'll sing

250
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:13,783
Rakesh is dead, but you are
the burden he has left for me

251
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,839
Looks like you're less interested
in your work..

252
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,779
and more interested
In our personal lives

253
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:26,613
But I've personally seen Kajal and
Simran with those two boys, sir

254
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:31,443
You're not talking about Sameer
and Kunal, are you?

255
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,844
Right, sir. It's those
boys I'm talking about

256
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,773
I've already met them

257
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,772
They're very decent boys

258
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,438
What?
- Oh yes

259
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,944
Here they come

260
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,843
Welcome.. sit down

261
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,609
Good evening uncle. How are you?
- How are you? - Papa!

262
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,648
Meet this gentleman. Mr. Vikram

263
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,445
He's terribly interested in our
personal lives and our business

264
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,974
Hello.
- Hello

265
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:14,613
Uncle, we came to you today
to ask for your permission

266
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,906
Go ahead. What is it about?

267
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:23,441
There's the Directors Special
beauty contest coming up next week

268
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,605
We want Simran to participate in it

269
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:28,441
If Simran wins this contest,
she'll get the opportunity..

270
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,446
To participate in the world
beauty contest, Papa!

271
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,707
Is that so?
- Yes!

272
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:37,443
In that case, Simran is surely
taking part in this beauty contest!

273
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,443
Thank you uncle. Thank you so much.

274
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,444
We'll have a photo-session
with Simran soon

275
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,639
For the photo-session, we'll
go to Uncle Tom's beach house

276
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:51,579
Ever since I can remember, Uncle
Tom has looked after me

277
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,839
He's quite an artistic man

278
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,781
Uncle Tom!
- Kunal.

279
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:02,777
Hello Tom uncle. - Hey Kunal.

280
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,910
My son! Kunal!
- How are you uncle?

281
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,439
How are you? You look fit!

282
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,607
But you are a rascal. You didn't
tell telephone to say you're coming

283
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:16,771
What happened was that..
- Hey! Sameer!

284
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,611
So you can see me too, Uncle Tom?
- Can't help it

285
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,976
When I see my Kunal, I
can see nothing else

286
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:27,981
Don't tell me you can't see these
two beautiful girls, Uncle!

287
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,507
The beautiful girls, I surely see.
- Oh yes!

288
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,707
You're a very interesting
man, Uncle Tom

289
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,637
And you're beautiful, my child

290
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,840
And we've brought her here to make
her look even more beautiful

291
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:43,778
So you're here to have
your portrait made?

292
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:47,973
No, Uncle Tom. We've come here
to shoot her photo-session

293
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,445
She's participating
in the beauty contest

294
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,446
Absolutely, and she's got to win it.

295
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,447
Undoubtedly. You will
surely win, my child

296
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,438
Wow it's amazing.
- Make up.

297
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,446
I mean, this is damn
Angle. It has been shut off.

298
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,606
Go and check out the exposure.
Come on. - Okay.

299
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:12,438
Simran, can we change now.
Left.. Left. Perfect.. Perfect.

300
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,436
Is full length okay.

301
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,438
Simran mid close.

302
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:22,445
Brilliant!

303
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:41,440
Hi!. Hello!
- Hi Tanya. Come..

304
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:47,441
Sameer, this is Tanya Khurana.
This year's upcoming model

305
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:51,441
Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,780
Who wouldn't know her?

307
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,436
You've kicked up quite a storm
in the modeling world

308
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,771
Yours is the face we see on the
cover page of every magazine

309
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:08,609
The Directors Special Black Beauty
Contest is coming up next week

310
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:13,442
I want to participate in it.
Which is why I'm here..

311
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,778
To have the latest and most
stunning photo session done for me

312
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,608
I'm telling you, Simran. Your
selection is guaranteed

313
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:25,772
I was stunned when I saw your
photographs. They are fantastic!

314
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,771
Hi Tanya! What a pleasant surprise!

315
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:34,508
We meet today after College.
How come you're here?

316
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,909
I had come here to get
my photo-session done

317
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,905
What are you doing here?

318
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:46,781
Actually, Simran is taking part in
next week's Black Beauty Contest

319
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:51,782
You say.. Simran's taking
part in this contest?

320
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,613
You're late, my child. The master's
waiting for you at dinner

321
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,613
Kaka, ask my brother
to go ahead and eat

322
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:28,772
I'm not hungry.
- Why's my baby not going to eat?

323
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,778
Brother, I'm not hungry

324
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,613
How did your photo-session go?
- It didn't take place

325
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,839
I didn't go through with it at all.
- Why not?

326
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:49,442
I'm not taking part in the
beauty contest. That's why

327
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,835
You're not taking part
in the beauty contest?

328
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,437
Why?
- Because..

329
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,844
Simran Malhotra is participating
in the contest

330
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:11,778
Simran Malhotra? Who's that?

331
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,609
She used to be with me in college

332
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:23,783
We often participated in
every contest together

333
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:30,944
Unfortunately for me, I
always lost out to her

334
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,780
And you think you will
lose out to her again?

335
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:46,613
As long as she's in the running,
I have no hopes of winning

336
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:51,613
And so I've decided that I'm
not participating at all

337
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,611
Let her win. It's a part of the game.

338
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:59,611
I'm very hungry, brother. Let's eat

339
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:17,614
I have an advise to give
you, Simran Malhotra

340
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:23,443
It's in your own interest
to follow my advise

341
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,840
Who are you?

342
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,773
A bad man

343
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,777
What rubbish!

344
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,846
No, no rubbish. This is an advise

345
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,440
You are not participating in the
forthcoming beauty contest

346
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,781
I'm not participating in the
beauty contest? Why not?

347
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,443
Because you want to live

348
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:49,113
If you participate in the
beauty contest, it means..

349
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,441
What?
- <i>I'll</i> kill you

350
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,606
It's for you to decide.
The beauty contest or...?

351
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:07,613
Don't be scared. Just think it over
with a calm mind. I'll call again

352
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:19,450
This is amazing! A stranger
threatens you..

353
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,947
And you decide not to take
part in the beauty contest!

354
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:30,910
Why don't you understand, Sameer?
That man said weird things

355
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:36,443
He said he'd kill me if I
participated in the beauty contest

356
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,443
He said that and you believed
him. Simran..

357
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:47,606
Can you think of a man who doesn't
want you participate in the contest?

358
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,437
I can't think of anyone like that

359
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,774
I think someone has played
a joke on Simran

360
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:01,610
Give Simran the telephone.
- Who are you?

361
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,838
She knows me

362
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,437
For you, Simran

363
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,614
You'll be happy to know that
I have changed my mind

364
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,440
I won't kill you

365
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,440
l Will..

366
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,947
Disfigure your face

367
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,436
I'll disfigure your face with acid..

368
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,777
...and you'll be scared
of your own looks.

369
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,848
Acid. I'll throw acid on your face

370
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,602
Oh! My God! Who are you?

371
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,443
Whom are you trying to threaten?
If you are man enough..

372
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,605
Come out in the open

373
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:52,442
And Simran will still give you
the reply she now gives you

374
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,444
She's taking part in the beauty
contest. She surely will

375
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,441
And know what? She's
even going to win!

376
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,446
She's going to win!

377
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,838
Please don't go

378
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:31,441
You're stopping me as if
I've never been away!

379
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,973
I have a business meeting
In Pune, my dear

380
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,775
As soon as it's over, I'll
return In a couple of clays

381
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,441
Couple of days...? No, Uncle. Please

382
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,771
After two days is my
beauty contest, uncle

383
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,441
I know that

384
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,609
And I already know the
outcome of the contest

385
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,442
You're the one who's going to win.
I'll do my best to be here..

386
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,776
Before the contest takes place

387
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,576
Now Come on give me a smile.

388
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,443
Yeah, That's nice.

389
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,438
What's his name?

390
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:26,841
Sameer, right? The way he spoke
to me over the phone...!

391
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:35,444
He was rude. It speaks of his
childishness. Yes, it does

392
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,773
Who are you? What do you want?
Why are you harassing me?

393
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:47,441
The way you drew your hair
with your fingers..

394
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,446
It's fantastic.. what style!

395
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:55,612
Who are you? What do you want?

396
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:00,841
Your uncle is away in Pune.
Kajal isn't back as yet

397
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,441
Such a big house, and you're alone.
I must say you are brave

398
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:14,783
But never forget to shut the main
door. Lest someone sneaks in

399
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,777
on! My God.

400
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:04,440
That was wise of you

401
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,611
But..
- But what?

402
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,642
I've been talking from inside.
- What...?

403
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,436
Where are you?

404
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,770
Who...?

405
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,780
Who are you?
- Ajit Khurana

406
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,771
Ajit Khurana...? Who?

407
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:03,450
I tried to give you a small
suggestion, over the phone

408
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,443
It's in your interest to heed me

409
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:15,443
Get this. This is no empty threat

410
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:21,442
You will not participate
in the contest

411
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:29,613
Bye

412
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:40,941
Well, I haven't seen your puppy

413
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,838
I hope he isn't in the refrigerator

414
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,771
Check it out

415
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:04,435
Go

416
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,580
Ladies and gentlemen.

417
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:23,448
The wait is over, the
judges have decided too

418
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,971
This year's Director's Special
Black beauty queen is..

419
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,602
Ms Simran Malhotra

420
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,835
Hi. I just came to meet you

421
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:04,441
She has done it uncle.
- Yes.

422
00:47:18,934 --> 00:47:20,436
Thank you.

423
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,443
Drop it!

424
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,605
What were you up to? What
the hell were you up to?

425
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,944
What if something had
happened to you?

426
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:17,615
Never do that again,
my child.. never

427
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,441
I'd warned her, hadn't I?

428
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,769
I'd warned her, hadn't I?

429
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,779
She didn't heed me

430
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:57,447
She won’t live. She
will live no more

431
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:09,773
Stop the car.
- What for?

432
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,781
Don't drive so fast, Sameer.
- You have won the contest

433
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:13,972
Now celebrate.

434
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,607
But where are we going?
- Khandala

435
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:20,646
Khandala?
- Yes. To your farmhouse

436
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,613
And there we're gonna have a ball.
- Only the four of us

437
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,440
Yes okay alright.

438
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:41,773
Listen girls, go in and freshen
up while I clear the car

439
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:48,607
The car! It's too hot.
It needs some water

440
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,940
Bye! See you
. Bye! See you. - Bye, - Bye!

441
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:57,440
Bholu kaka..
- I'll get water

442
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,776
Kaka, first hear us out.
- What is it?

443
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:04,436
Let's go to the corner.
- Sure

444
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:10,442
Here we are. Bholu kaka..

445
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:17,910
Don't you miss your wife and kids?
- I do, but I can't help it

446
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:21,779
So Bholu kaka, go home
tonight and have fun

447
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:31,118
Fun? Then who will serve you?
- We will help ourselves, Bholu kaka

448
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,776
All you got to do is have fun

449
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,976
Tonight you're free

450
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,446

tresses, inviting

451
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:32,779

Fair body, inviting

454
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,615
My heart's beating harder,
it's apprehensive

455
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:56,615
My heart stops me..
I don't feel like it

456
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:02,841
I'm desirous of you, my love

457
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,438
I love only you

458
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:11,944

This meeting, inviting

462

My heart is wayward, it's amorous

463
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:41,614
My heart beats harder..
It's on fire

464
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:47,978
I'm desirous of you, my love

465

Your cheeks flares up..

00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:39,774
Puts Spring to shame..
the night has blossomed

468
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:45,849
These moments of wait will pass

469
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:51,441
My youth, I have entrusted
to you.. I trust you

470
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:54,771
As I wait for you, the fire in
my heart lights up your path

You live in my heartbeats,
yet I call out for you

I have won over you, and I give in

475
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:16,615
Not even in my wildest
dreams will I desert you

476
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:22,615
Ours is a love that's
been since ages

477
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,643
In your arms, I have
forgotten the world

478
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,944
I'm desirous of you, my love

479
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:34,771

Wet-wet night, inviting

483
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,773
This meeting, inviting

484
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:04,442
My heart's beating harder,
it's apprehensive

485
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:10,610
My heart stops me..
I don't feel like it

486
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:16,774
I'm desirous of you, my love

487
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:19,838
I love only you

488
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,779
I love only you

489
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:43,774
What does this mean? - We heard
all that you told Bholu kaka

490
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:49,773
Now get up quietly ,
go out and get food

491
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:53,609
Simran, we're drenched and it's
raining outside. We'll freeze

492
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:59,446
No, you won't. Put the
jacket on and get going

493
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,447
Out!
- Hear us out, please

494
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,448
Get out.
- What are you doing? Hear me out..

495
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,447
Nothing doing. Just get out

496
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,906
Out, quick.
- Listen to me, Simran..

497
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:14,446
No way

498
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,976
Well! Back so soon?

499
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,440
You

500
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,773
I adhere to one principle

501
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,772
If I make a promise,
I make sure I keep it

502
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,442
Now look, you..

503
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:19,608
You've committed a mistake.
- What have I done?

504
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:25,605
I told you not to participate
in the beauty contest

505
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:30,440
I forbade you

506
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,441
Didn't I?

507
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,705
I forbade you, didn't I?
- Yes

508
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:49,838
I told you I'd kill
you if don't heed me

509
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:02,450
So here I am, to kill you.
- Hear me out, please..

510
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:22,441
Don't come near me.. don't
step forward, I say

511
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,610
Why did you do this?
I must kill you now

512
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:40,615
I can only assure you that it will
hurt the least before death comes

513
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,772
Oh my God!

514
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:50,437
Oh my God!

515
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,977
Let her go!

516
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,447
Let go of Simran!

517
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,440
Come on, Simran

518
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,910
C'mon Simran

519
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:34,839
Leave her. I said leave her.

520
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,602
Leave her. Leave her.

521
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,647
Simran! Help!

522
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:56,613
Simran! Help!

523
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,436
C'mon, Kajal

524
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,944
Stop there, I say

525
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:21,445
Oh my God!

526
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:37,840
What happened, Simran? Tell me.
- Why are you quiet, Kajal?

527
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,436
Why are you in tears?

528
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:44,769
Blood...? How come you are bleeding?

529
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:46,438
Sameer, he is..

530
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:58,446
Oh no.

531
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:18,614
Simran, he is..
- I killed him

532
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:21,443
What...?
- I killed him

533
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,615
What...? What are you saying?
- I killed him, Sameer

534
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:30,771
Else, he'd have killed me and Kajal

535
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,940
But who the hell was he?
- Ajit Khurana

536
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,778
He used to threaten Simran.
- Why was Ajit Khurana here?

537
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:41,710
To avenge.
- We must telephone the police

538
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,706
Right. Let's call up
your uncle Ashutosh

539
01:05:46,767 --> 01:05:51,841
Right, Simran. Let's inform him.
- No, don't tell him anything

540
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,902
Why not Simran. It's
not your fault.

541
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:56,846
Why not, Simran? Whatever you did,
you did only to defend yourself

542
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,905
He will understand.
- No, he won't understand, Sameer

543
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:03,948
He cares a damn for
friends and relatives

544
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:09,773
Then what do we do with this corpse?
- We got to do something about it

545
01:06:09,934 --> 01:06:13,438
Think up something.
- Yes

546
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:21,912
Go, wash yourself clean
and change. Go, Simran

547
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,438
Careful

548
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,440
Watch out, Kunal!

549
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,780
What have you thought up?

550
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:07,836
Where will we take it?

551
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:12,607
To the railway tracks.
- Railway tracks...?

552
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:18,442
Yes, so that his death
looks like an accident

553
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:24,612
In most of the cases train accident
victims are unidentifiable

554
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,974
I think you are right.

555
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:30,446
The railway tracks are nearby

556
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,772
Let's go.

557
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:15,604
Easy

558
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,443
Get in

559
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:08,941
Oh My God!
- What's wrong? - This car...?

560
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:15,942
Yes, it wasn't here when we came.
- It belongs to Ajit Khurana

561
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:20,940
Yet another hassle!
- He must've come driving

562
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,780
Should the police find this car
here, we'll come under suspicion

563
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:33,608
Must put the car out of sight.
- Where?

564
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:42,979
Kunal, we saw a lake: on
our way. Did you notice?

565
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:48,450
Right.
- Right! You and Kajal..

566
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,912
Will shove the car into
the lake. Simran and I..

567
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:54,846
Will take the corpse
to the railway tracks

568
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:59,610
Right. - Okay. - Come on.
Come on. Come on. Fast.

569
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:40,974
What say, Govind? How
long will it take?

570
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,602
I'm trying, sir

571
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,774
Oh My God!

572
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:55,610
Looks like it's your uncle, Simran

573
01:11:58,601 --> 01:12:01,445
Stop, please

574
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:10,615
Thank God it's you.
- Uncle, what are you doing here?

575
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:14,112
My car broke down. Govind has been
trying since half-hour, but..

576
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:17,774
He doesn't seem to know what's
wrong. - Let me check

577
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,946
Oh no, he'll set it right.
I'll go with you

578
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,773
Well.. you"?

579
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:30,943
Oh, I almost forgot to congratulate
you, my beauty queen

580
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:33,842
lam proud of you my child.

581
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:38,440
I had predicted, only you could
win the beauty contest

582
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:43,614
Uncle, how do you know?
- Ashutosh had called me up

583
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:48,773
He also told me that all of you
went to Khandala to celebrate

584
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:52,938
Where are Kunal and Kajal?
- Uncle, they..

585
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:59,443
Actually.. you see, we had
company, those two are with them

586
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:00,909
Oh! I see.

587
01:13:00,967 --> 01:13:05,712
Govind, I'm going with them. You
will find some mechanic around

588
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:07,974
Get the car repaired and drive
it home. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

589
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:12,444
Mess!

590
01:13:14,434 --> 01:13:16,607
What's wrong? Come on

591
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:22,644
Yes.. let's go.
- Get in

592
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:10,442
What's wrong, dear? All you unwell?
- No uncle, it's just a headache

593
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:17,441
I see. Bye Sameer, it's late now.
Time to part for the night

594
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,443
Let me have the keys

595
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:24,610
Yes.. the keys

596
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,605
Okay good night. Come, dear

597
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,614
Come on, it's good night.
Will you wait till morning?

598
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,442
Come, let me give you
a pill for the headache

599
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:44,605
Okay good night, Son.

600
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,602
I got an important meeting tomorrow

601
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:55,705
If my car doesn't arrive,
I'll take your car

602
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:56,939
All right, uncle

603
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:09,610
Job done? - Yes. We shoved
the car into the lake

604
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:13,907
Nobody can find it. - Sameer,
did you conceal the corpse?

605
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:17,847
How could I? Before we could even
reach the railway tracks..

606
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:22,042
We found uncle on the way. He
insisted on coming with us

607
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,945
The corpse is inside the
boot, and it's locked

608
01:15:26,834 --> 01:15:28,780
And the keys?
- With uncle

609
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,905
I wish Ajit Khurana had killed me

610
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:44,781
At least it would've saved
you guys from trouble

611
01:15:44,934 --> 01:15:50,941
What are you saying, Simran?
Never say such things

612
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:56,840
Had we not found your uncle on the
why, we wouldn't have faced this

613
01:15:56,901 --> 01:16:00,439
Add to it, Daddy took
the car keys with him

614
01:16:01,434 --> 01:16:05,905
Now you tell us what's to be done.
- How long can we keep the corpse..

615
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:10,440
Inside the boot? For the time
being, we must conceal it somewhere

616
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:14,944
But where?
- Somewhere nearby..

617
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:21,438
Where nobody suspects

618
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:46,047
Yes that's it. That's it.

619
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:56,044
Look at the swimming pool, Kunal

620
01:16:56,934 --> 01:17:02,782
The water is dirty. The pool seems
to be unused for months together

621
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,441
Should we shove the corpse into
it for the time being..

622
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,448
...It'll go unnoticed

623
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:49,307
I live in Khurana House,
Juhu Vile Parle Scheme

624
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:54,844
My elder brother Ajit Khurana has
been missing since 8 January

625
01:18:55,367 --> 01:18:59,474
He always informs mg before
leaving. I'm worried

626
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:05,710
It's wise not to worry. Worrying
will give you nothing, Ms Khurana

627
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:10,476
We're here to worry. We'll
surely find your brother

628
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:15,311
D'you have a picture of
your brother? - Yes

629
01:19:17,367 --> 01:19:18,641
Here

630
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:24,471
He smokes a lot.
- Yes

631
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:31,648
There's a reason behind
every incident

632
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:37,706
There sure must be some reason
for your brother going missing

633
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:44,478
Tell me.. had he enemies?
- None

634
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:50,312
When did you see him last?
- I told you. Three days ago..

635
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:55,316
While he was leaving.
- Where did he leave for?

636
01:19:56,767 --> 01:20:02,308
I don't know.
- Wrong. You just said..

637
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:06,313
Your brother always informs
you before leaving

638
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:10,310
But that night he left
without informing me

639
01:20:11,567 --> 01:20:17,313
Night? Which means he
left at night? - Yes

640
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:20,314
What time?
- It was quite late

641
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:23,641
He drove his car.
- Car number?

642
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:28,638
MMH 4680

643
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:56,639
Move

644
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,307
Same number, sir. Going
by the car's condition..

645
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:10,814
It doesn't look like an accident.
It was shoved into the lake

646
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:20,481
Which means, someone tried
to pull wool over our eyes

647
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:41,309
Today, they traced the car. Tomorrow,
they'll find the corpse too

648
01:21:42,634 --> 01:21:47,640
How the hell will they find it?
Now look, don't you worry

649
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,839
You don't know inspector
uncle, Sameer

650
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:55,313
What if he suspects us?

651
01:21:56,634 --> 01:22:04,314
And what if he finds the corpse?
That's what scares you, right?

652
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:07,974
We'll somehow clear the corpse
from the pool today

653
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:13,715
Sameer, but where will we dump it?
- There, where we planned

654
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:20,773
On the railway tracks. Come what
may, we got to rid this mess today

655
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:25,313
Oh my God! What is this?

656
01:22:26,467 --> 01:22:31,467
Uncle bal.
- An army of kids!

657
01:22:41,834 --> 01:22:46,510
Uncle, please get my ball

658
01:22:48,634 --> 01:22:53,777
Vikram, what are you staring at?
Get the ball out for the kids

659
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,310
Fast, uncle

660
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:20,307
Oh no! - What happened? - My
apartment's keys fell inside

661
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:24,574
There!
- It went down the drain!

662
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:28,810
What are you thinking? Jump into
the water, and get the keys

663
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:31,307
Jump...?

664
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:35,714
No I didn't throw it. She threw it.

665
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,806
What's up, Vikram?

666
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:48,305
I'm goin to get my
keys from te pool

667
01:23:48,367 --> 01:23:51,314
From the pool...? The
water is dirty, Vikram

668
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,308
How will you find the keys?
- You must be having duplicate ones

669
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:00,705
What are you up to? You have
duplicate keys, don't you?

670
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:02,303
I don't.

671
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:08,303
Come on

672
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:15,648
What's that? You dived for the
keys. And what's that you've found?

673
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,839
A lighter.
- Let me see

674
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:26,708
Whose lighter is this?
- No idea. I found it near the keys

675
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,475
What noise is that?

676
01:25:52,534 --> 01:25:57,313
C'mon, hurry up. Come on move.

677
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:03,480
That's inspector uncle.
- What is he doing here?

678
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,772
Empty the pool, right now

679
01:26:08,701 --> 01:26:10,647
I want the pool emptied right now.

680
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,906
Constable, turn on the pump.
- Right sir

681
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,640
Come on move constable.

682
01:26:24,701 --> 01:26:29,309
What's going on?
- Malhotra, make it quick.

683
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:32,710
Ashutosh, what are you up to
so early in the morning?

684
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,906
What are you doing?

685
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:40,712
Why are you emptying pool?
- Malhotra, the water is stinking

686
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,479
That's fine, but..
- I'll clean it up

687
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,476
Ashutosh, why are you
doing it anyway?

688
01:26:59,634 --> 01:27:01,910
Malhotra please let me do my job.

689
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:22,477
Inspector, the pool has
been dirty for months now

690
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,477
What makes you clean
it all of a sudden?

691
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:33,482
I think inspector uncle suspects us.
That's why he's emptying the pool

692
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:37,646
Kajal, what if he finds the corpse?

693
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:14,307
Found nothing from the pool...?
How could this happen?

694
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,705
If the entire pool was emptied,
where did the corpse go?

695
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:23,773
That's the mystery, Sameer. How can
a corpse vanish from the pool?

696
01:28:23,834 --> 01:28:30,479
Vanish...? You mean, someone
fished the body out?

697
01:28:30,634 --> 01:28:36,482
Sameer.. was someone watching us?

698
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:40,310
Who could it be?

699
01:28:40,467 --> 01:28:43,812
Whoever, but he has saved us today

700
01:28:44,467 --> 01:28:47,471
Saved for now, but..
- But what, Sameer?

701
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:49,774
That son of a gun, Khanna
suspects us. - Suspects?

702
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:52,310
I think you are
absolutely right, Sameer!

703
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,647
He suspects that Ajit
Khurana is missing

704
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:01,807
And he's not the one to stay quiet. 
He'll definitely try something

705
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:07,644
How could your brother go missing?
Where the hell did he go?

706
01:29:07,834 --> 01:29:12,647
Inspector, instead
of questioning me..

707
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:19,481
You'd rather ask Simran
Malhotra.

708
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:23,309
Simran?
- Yes, Simran

709
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:27,308
Because that night my brother
went to meet Simran

710
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:31,309
When?
- The night of 8 January

711
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:37,651
The night of 8 January? That's the
night Simran won the beauty contest

712
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:42,648
And to celebrate, she went to her
farmhouse in Khandala with friends

713
01:29:44,567 --> 01:29:50,574
Sameer! You are scaring us!
- I'm not. I'm only warning you

714
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:57,309
Could we have left some evidence
for Khanna to find?

715
01:29:57,634 --> 01:29:59,307
You are right, Sameer!

716
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:03,313
Think.. think well what
happened that night

717
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:15,317
That night.. reminds me
of Khurana and the tub

718
01:30:15,467 --> 01:30:20,467
The tub was full and Khurana
was bleeding profusely

719
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:31,316
The water changed to
the color of blood

720
01:30:31,701 --> 01:30:34,910
The tub would be still
full of blood - Yes.

721
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,648
And in haste, we forgot
to clean the tub.

722
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,704
Sameer, we got to leave
for Khandala right away

723
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:48,717
You go, Kunal, and clean
the tub. I'll stay back

724
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:52,475
I'll manage if Khanna tries
to cross-question the girls

725
01:30:52,634 --> 01:30:57,310
But the watchman won't allow Kunal
in. - I'll go with Kunal.

726
01:30:57,467 --> 01:31:01,313
Good idea.
- Kunal, be careful

727
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:03,313
Don't worry. Let's go.

728
01:31:15,467 --> 01:31:17,310
Move

729
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:28,313
Oh God!

730
01:31:28,834 --> 01:31:30,814
Oh My God!
- What's wrong?

731
01:31:33,567 --> 01:31:34,841
Inspector Ashutosh Khanna.

732
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:38,307
He'll stop me too

733
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,847
Could he too be going to
the Khandala farmhouse?

734
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:49,777
I think he suspects us. We
must reach before he does

735
01:31:58,767 --> 01:32:01,805
Hello Kajal! Kunal!

736
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:07,771
Come on move ahead..

737
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,442
Hey, come on move ahead.

738
01:32:11,634 --> 01:32:12,840
Sir, move ahead..

739
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:14,903
A thief always leaves
behind evidence

740
01:33:30,567 --> 01:33:33,309
Who the hell...? Stop the car!

741
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:35,708
Stop!

742
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:41,305
Why were you driving so fast?
Kajal, is anything wrong?

743
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:45,782
Kajal, listen to me.. Brother
Kunal why are you running?

744
01:33:58,701 --> 01:34:00,305
Come on hurry up.

745
01:34:18,701 --> 01:34:19,839
Goodness, a cop!

746
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:23,313
It's you, Mr. Khanna!
- Was someone come here?

747
01:34:23,567 --> 01:34:28,312
Kajal and her friend came. I don't
know why they were in a hurry

748
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:29,641
Come on

749
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:02,310
You Uncle?

750
01:36:03,701 --> 01:36:09,310
The name is Inspector
Ashutosh Khanna

751
01:36:09,467 --> 01:36:11,811
I am far-sighted

752
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:20,311
Tell me something. How long
have you known Ajit Khurana?

753
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:23,780
Ajit Khurana? This is the first time
we're hearing that name, Inspector

754
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:26,644
What say, Kajal?
- That's right

755
01:36:26,701 --> 01:36:30,308
And why are you asking
us about him, Uncle?

756
01:36:30,467 --> 01:36:34,779
Because your Uncle has been
looking out for Ajit Khurana

757
01:36:34,834 --> 01:36:37,713
He's been missing from Khandala
since the eighth of January

758
01:36:37,801 --> 01:36:41,715
We found his car in
a gorge in Khandala

759
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:46,310
And this lighter I found by the
swimming pool of your house

760
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,640
This lighter belongs to Ajit Khurana

761
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:55,651
How can you say for sure that this
lighter belongs to Ajit Khurana?

762
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,714
Because the lighter
bears his initials

763
01:36:59,801 --> 01:37:03,305
A.K. ..
- Aamir Khan

764
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:08,309
What I mean to say is that the
initials A.K. could be anyone's

765
01:37:08,467 --> 01:37:11,311
Anil Kapoor.
- Akshay Khanna

766
01:37:11,567 --> 01:37:16,312
Akshay Kumar. What you must
think of Inspector is that..

767
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:21,476
Your initials for Ashutosh
Khanna also is A.K.

768
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:29,483
Kajal, I think we must arrange for
some tea and snacks for your uncle

769
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:31,478
Okay?
' okay- Bye,

770
01:37:33,701 --> 01:37:37,478
Snacks, I will feed you my boy

771
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:41,478
And you'll remember
them all your life

772
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,306
Hello!
- Hello Sameer.

773
01:38:10,367 --> 01:38:12,711
Go on, Simran

774
01:38:12,801 --> 01:38:16,977
I'm terribly scared, Sameer.
I'm all alone at home

775
01:38:18,567 --> 01:38:20,478
Kajal and Kunal ought to
have been there by now

776
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,479
Aren't they there yet?
- No, I can't get this

777
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:27,644
Uncle's not at home either

778
01:38:29,467 --> 01:38:32,914
Hello. Hello Sameer.
- Simran. Simran Hello.

779
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:36,573
Hello. Hello.
- Hello Simran.

780
01:38:40,901 --> 01:38:42,312
Simran

781
01:43:14,767 --> 01:43:18,909
Simran, it's me! What happened?

782
01:43:18,967 --> 01:43:22,312
Sameer! He was here! He's alive!

783
01:43:22,467 --> 01:43:24,640
He wants to kill me!
- Who?

784
01:43:24,701 --> 01:43:27,773
Who are you talking about?
Who wants to kill you?

785
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:31,782
That.. That..
- Who? - Ajit Khurana. - What?

786
01:43:31,834 --> 01:43:36,305
Believe me, Sameer. I've
seen him with my own eyes

787
01:43:36,634 --> 01:43:39,638
He's going to kill me!

788
01:43:40,634 --> 01:43:44,639
What's wrong with you, Simran?
What's gotten into you?

789
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:48,476
Get a hold on yourself.
Ajit Khurana is dead

790
01:43:49,634 --> 01:43:52,581
You've only been imagining
things! Nothing else

791
01:43:52,634 --> 01:43:55,638
I wasn't imagining things!
Believe me

792
01:43:55,801 --> 01:43:59,715
I've seen Ajit Khurana
for myself! He..

793
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,304
Ajit Khurana...?

794
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:19,641
How can I believe he's alive?

795
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:22,773
Believe me, Sameer. He's
alive! I've seen him!

796
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:26,474
You're talking rubbish! Rubbish!
- It's true, Sameer

797
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,646
Kajal and I have seen him too

798
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,304
What?
- It's true, Sameer

799
01:44:37,767 --> 01:44:41,476
Simran is right. He's alive

800
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:46,774
Ajit Khurana is alive.
- What's gotten into you guys?

801
01:44:46,834 --> 01:44:49,974
Ajit Khurana lay in the
water for so many days

802
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:55,716
How can he be alive? He
was dead, you know that

803
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,476
There wasn't any life left in him.
We hid his body in the pool

804
01:45:00,634 --> 01:45:04,776
I agree with everything you say .
But what we have seen...

805
01:45:04,834 --> 01:45:06,643
how can we deny?

806
01:45:07,767 --> 01:45:13,479
It's impossible! And how am
I to believe the impossible?

807
01:45:13,567 --> 01:45:15,808
I've seen the impossible
happening, Sameer

808
01:45:16,767 --> 01:45:20,772
Kajal has seen it too. And Simran
says she has seen it too

809
01:45:21,701 --> 01:45:24,307
Simran was hallucinating

810
01:45:24,467 --> 01:45:30,315
How could three people hallucinate
about the same thing?

811
01:45:31,467 --> 01:45:33,310
What do you say to that?

812
01:45:35,634 --> 01:45:41,312
No. He's alive. Ajit
Khurana is alive

813
01:45:41,634 --> 01:45:45,309
That is the truth. And now..

814
01:45:46,634 --> 01:45:49,478
He's baying for our blood

815
01:46:16,634 --> 01:46:21,777
What's the matter, dear?
Why were you startled?

816
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:26,305
No, Uncle. It's just that..
- What, my dear?

817
01:46:26,634 --> 01:46:29,581
Ever since you've won
the beauty crown..

818
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:32,478
I've found you more sad than happy

819
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:36,773
What is the matter?
- It's nothing, Uncle

820
01:46:36,834 --> 01:46:39,314
Well, never mind all that

821
01:46:39,567 --> 01:46:42,810
Just prepare for the celebrations
this evening

822
01:46:42,867 --> 01:46:46,314
Celebrations. - To celebrate your
victory at the beauty contest..

823
01:46:46,367 --> 01:46:51,715
I have thrown a grand party.
It's going to be a big blast!

824
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:55,649
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

825
01:47:55,701 --> 01:47:58,648
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

826
01:47:58,701 --> 01:48:01,307
I've come of age

827
01:48:01,634 --> 01:48:11,316
The whole of India
is talking about me

828
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:20,306
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

829
01:48:20,767 --> 01:48:23,475
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

830
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:26,648
I've come of age

831
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:36,486
The whole of India
is talking about me

832
01:49:18,634 --> 01:49:22,707
Some give away their hearts,
yet others give away riches

833
01:49:28,301 --> 01:49:32,477
Some give away their hearts,
yet others give away riches

834
01:49:32,634 --> 01:49:37,481
But I've spurned them all.
That's the storm I am

835
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:45,313
It's my beauty..

836
01:49:45,368 --> 01:49:48,315
That takes their breath away

837
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:59,474
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

838
01:49:59,767 --> 01:50:02,475
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

839
01:50:02,701 --> 01:50:05,307
I've come of age

840
01:50:05,367 --> 01:50:10,476
The whole of India
is talking about me

841
01:51:36,701 --> 01:51:41,480
I'll give my heart to someone
with a big heart

842
01:51:46,634 --> 01:51:50,912
I'll give my heart to someone
with a big heart

843
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:56,308
But I've yet to come
cross my beloved

844
01:51:56,634 --> 01:52:03,779
I'll find him someday..

845
01:52:03,834 --> 01:52:06,474
The one who craves for me

846
01:52:13,701 --> 01:52:17,581
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

847
01:52:18,634 --> 01:52:21,308
I'm a carefree soul,
lost to pleasures..

848
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:23,711
I've come of age

849
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,647
The whole of India
is talking about me

850
01:53:08,301 --> 01:53:09,644
Lovely bouquets

851
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,304
Who sent this one?

852
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:17,477
Dear Simran from Mrs. Monika.

853
01:53:17,767 --> 01:53:21,305
She's the principal of our
junior college, isn't she?

854
01:53:21,634 --> 01:53:22,704
So sweet of her!

855
01:53:23,701 --> 01:53:25,703
And who has sent this note?

856
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:32,473
To dear Simran. With love and
Hugs and kiss and best wishes.

857
01:53:33,634 --> 01:53:37,480
Kajal stop it. Stop it.

858
01:53:38,467 --> 01:53:41,710
Sameer is the limit! Why did
he send these flowers?

859
01:53:41,767 --> 01:53:43,474
And a love-letter to boot!

860
01:53:44,467 --> 01:53:46,640
Here's another love-letter

861
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:55,477
I know everything
about Ajit Khurana

862
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:05,308
I know everything
about Ajit Khurana

863
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,839
About Ajit Khurana...?

864
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:20,319
If you wish to know about him,
at 4 this evening..

865
01:54:20,367 --> 01:54:24,315
Meet me at the hilltop

866
01:54:32,467 --> 01:54:39,476
I can't understand who'd know
everything about us and Ajit Khurana

867
01:54:41,701 --> 01:54:43,703
That's just what we have
come here to find out

868
01:55:13,367 --> 01:55:14,778
You and here?

869
01:55:14,834 --> 01:55:20,785
You thought nobody would know if you
put the body in the swimming pool

870
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,306
You put the body in
the swimming pool

871
01:55:24,634 --> 01:55:30,312
Inspector Ashutosh got suspicious
and he had the swimming pool emptied

872
01:55:30,634 --> 01:55:33,808
But he couldn't find the body.
It had disappeared

873
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,805
Where could it go...?

874
01:55:38,634 --> 01:55:40,477
I took it away

875
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,475
So you saw the body in the pool?

876
01:55:55,701 --> 01:55:58,648
Why didn't you tell anyone about it?

877
01:55:58,701 --> 01:56:02,308
The moment I got the ace,
it was obvious to me..

878
01:56:02,367 --> 01:56:04,472
That I would win the round

879
01:56:05,634 --> 01:56:08,843
And now's the time to use the ace

880
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:13,482
Ajit Khurana's body is in my custody

881
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:19,514
To keep my lips sealed,
I want 2.5 million

882
01:56:21,701 --> 01:56:27,481
You're blackmailing us?
- Yes, of course I am

883
01:56:28,634 --> 01:56:31,706
The remote control to your
lives is in my hands

884
01:56:32,367 --> 01:56:39,478
Anytime I wish to, I can show
Inspector Ashutosh the truth

885
01:56:39,567 --> 01:56:42,707
You scoundrel! You're doing
nothing of the sort!

886
01:56:42,767 --> 01:56:44,804
Leave him alone, Sameer!
- Relax, Sameer

887
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:54,482
We have no other way but to
give in to this scoundrel

888
01:57:02,467 --> 01:57:07,314
Have 2.5 million ready
for me tomorrow

889
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:18,913
Try to make it in 1000-rupee bills

890
01:58:08,634 --> 01:58:10,307
Hey!

891
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,573
Can't you hear anything?

892
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:23,702
You own the bloody roads?

893
01:58:25,767 --> 01:58:29,476
Why have you blocked the road?

894
01:58:44,467 --> 01:58:46,310
Are you deaf?

895
02:00:04,301 --> 02:00:09,478
You're right, but what enmity
could Vikram have with anyone?

896
02:00:09,634 --> 02:00:12,808
Who could kill him so mercilessly?

897
02:00:13,467 --> 02:00:16,311
And I don't even know
whether Vikram knew..

898
02:00:16,367 --> 02:00:19,314
...the Ajit Khurana you talk about

899
02:00:20,634 --> 02:00:24,639
There's a difference in knowing
and recognizing a man, Malhotra

900
02:00:25,701 --> 02:00:27,647
What does that mean?
- I mean..

901
02:00:27,801 --> 02:00:31,578
...even if Vikram knew Ajit
Khurana or not..

902
02:00:32,967 --> 02:00:36,471
Simran surely knew him

903
02:00:37,701 --> 02:00:38,839
I';

904
02:00:38,901 --> 02:00:43,850
He was your friend's brother.
Tanya Khurana

905
02:00:44,834 --> 02:00:49,476
She's your friend, isn't she?
- We used to study together

906
02:00:49,634 --> 02:00:53,309
And she must surely have introduced
you to her brother?

907
02:00:53,634 --> 02:00:56,808
No, I never met him

908
02:00:57,701 --> 02:01:02,309
I don't know him! I don't!

909
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:16,313
What happened to her suddenly?
- I've never been married, Malhotra

910
02:01:16,367 --> 02:01:18,711
But I've been to several weddings

911
02:01:20,701 --> 02:01:23,477
Simran is hiding something.
- What?

912
02:02:11,634 --> 02:02:13,841
It's 9, Simran. The health
club is closing down

913
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:17,313
Everyone has left. I'm going
away too. Okay Bye! - Bye!

914
02:03:21,801 --> 02:03:25,977
No.. let me go!

915
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,973
Help! ls somebody there?.

916
02:03:40,801 --> 02:03:42,974
Help! ls somebody there?..

917
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:46,973
Help!

918
02:03:50,467 --> 02:03:51,810
Simran.

919
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,972
Help!

920
02:04:54,801 --> 02:04:58,977
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.

921
02:05:24,468 --> 02:05:28,644
Four rounds were fired from Mr.
Rajan Malhotra's revolver, sir

922
02:05:28,701 --> 02:05:31,978
Looks like someone pushed
him off the top floor

923
02:05:33,467 --> 02:05:35,811
Where's Simran?
- She had passed out, sir

924
02:05:35,867 --> 02:05:38,973
We've had her admitted
to the City Hospital

925
02:05:42,467 --> 02:05:44,811
He's.. going to kill us

926
02:05:46,467 --> 02:05:51,815
He'll kill all of us.
He won't spare anyone!

927
02:05:51,867 --> 02:05:54,973
Nothing's happening to you.
No one is doing you any harm

928
02:05:56,468 --> 02:05:58,812
No, doctor. He's
going to kill me

929
02:05:59,467 --> 02:06:03,973
He killed Vikram.
He killed Uncle too

930
02:06:05,467 --> 02:06:09,973
He now wants to kill me.
- Who wants to kill you?

931
02:06:11,467 --> 02:06:16,974
He'll come.. he'll come here

932
02:06:17,467 --> 02:06:20,812
No one is coming here, Simran.
You're imagining things!

933
02:06:27,467 --> 02:06:31,643
Doctor, what are you
talking about?

934
02:06:31,701 --> 02:06:35,808
To talk incoherently like
this and be scared..

935
02:06:35,867 --> 02:06:40,976
Are signs of insanity.
- No, doctor

936
02:06:42,467 --> 02:06:45,812
Nothing’s happening
to Simran. Nothing?

937
02:06:46,467 --> 02:06:49,641
I have a suggestion. Take
Simran away from this city

938
02:06:50,467 --> 02:06:52,640
She'll relax if she goes away
from this atmosphere..

939
02:06:52,701 --> 02:06:53,805
...for a few days

940
02:06:54,468 --> 02:06:56,971
Come, doctor

941
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:05,976
Sameer, why don't we take
Simran to Uncle Tom's beach-house?

942
02:07:07,467 --> 02:07:09,970
Sameer, Kunal is right

943
02:07:10,467 --> 02:07:13,812
Take Simran to my beach-house
immediately

944
02:07:14,467 --> 02:07:16,811
She's bound to like it there

945
02:07:40,467 --> 02:07:41,969
Sweetheart..

946
02:07:44,467 --> 02:07:45,969
Sweetheart..

947
02:07:48,467 --> 02:07:51,971
Do not treat me
like an outsider

948
02:07:52,467 --> 02:07:55,971
You and I share the same story

949
02:07:56,467 --> 02:07:59,641
You and I shall never part..

950
02:07:59,701 --> 02:08:04,980
God will never
be angry with us

951
02:08:07,467 --> 02:08:08,969
Sweetheart..

952
02:08:27,467 --> 02:08:30,812
Why do you suppress
your sorrow?

953
02:08:30,867 --> 02:08:33,973
Why don't you speak
your heart?

954
02:08:38,801 --> 02:08:41,975
Why do you suppress
your sorrow?

955
02:08:42,467 --> 02:08:45,971
Why don't you speak
your heart?

956
02:08:46,367 --> 02:08:50,474
Every dream of love
shall come true..

957
02:08:50,534 --> 02:08:54,641
The world will be ours
for the asking

958
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:58,808
Our love shall bear fruit..

959
02:08:58,867 --> 02:09:00,972
O sweetheart

960
02:09:01,467 --> 02:09:02,969
O sweetheart

961
02:09:03,467 --> 02:09:08,974
You and I share the same story

962
02:09:09,467 --> 02:09:16,646
You and I shall never part.
God will never be angry with us

963
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:18,805
O sweetheart..

964
02:09:21,467 --> 02:09:22,969
O sweetheart..

965
02:09:52,467 --> 02:09:56,643
What's going to be,
we don't know..

966
02:09:56,700 --> 02:10:00,807
So why must we sacrifice
what we have today?

967
02:10:03,468 --> 02:10:07,644
What's going to be,
we don't know..

968
02:10:07,701 --> 02:10:11,808
...so why must we sacrifice
what we have today?

969
02:10:12,468 --> 02:10:15,642
Let's share our happiness..

970
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:18,807
And be together for a lifetime

971
02:10:18,868 --> 02:10:21,974
Come, linger in my breath

972
02:10:22,467 --> 02:10:23,969
O sweetheart..

973
02:10:24,467 --> 02:10:25,969
O sweetheart..

974
02:10:27,467 --> 02:10:33,816
You and I share the same story

975
02:10:34,467 --> 02:10:41,646
You and I will never part. God
will never be angry with us

976
02:10:41,701 --> 02:10:43,977
Sweetheart..

977
02:10:46,467 --> 02:10:47,969
O sweetheart..

978
02:11:11,467 --> 02:11:16,644
Sameer, there was a call from
Inspector Ashutosh Khanna

979
02:11:17,467 --> 02:11:22,644
He has called you and Kunal to
the police station immediately

980
02:11:23,467 --> 02:11:27,973
So late in the night?
- What could it be?

981
02:11:28,467 --> 02:11:30,640
He has got to know something..

982
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:33,806
...about the Rajan Malhotra
murder case

983
02:11:34,467 --> 02:11:36,640
Very well then. We'll
leave immediately

984
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:38,805
Please look after Simran
and Kajal. - Certainly

985
02:11:38,867 --> 02:11:39,971
Let's go

986
02:12:02,467 --> 02:12:04,640
What happened?
- I don't know

987
02:12:06,467 --> 02:12:08,970
It was doing pretty well. I
wonder what's wrong suddenly

988
02:12:09,467 --> 02:12:10,810
Let's take a look

989
02:12:16,467 --> 02:12:17,810
What a nuisance

990
02:12:39,467 --> 02:12:41,811
Can't understand what went
wrong with the car all of a sudden

991
02:12:43,468 --> 02:12:44,811
We can't fix it.

992
02:12:46,468 --> 02:12:48,812
Needs a mechanic. I don't
think we'll find one here

993
02:12:49,468 --> 02:12:54,645
I think we'll find one around.
- Go on, find

994
02:12:56,467 --> 02:12:59,971
Stay here, I'll be right back

995
02:13:25,467 --> 02:13:26,810
Who's there?

996
02:14:38,467 --> 02:14:41,812
Who's around...? Who...?

997
02:14:43,467 --> 02:14:46,812
Who's around...? Who...?

998
02:14:47,467 --> 02:14:51,813
What shadows are these?

999
02:14:52,467 --> 02:14:56,813
A fog envelops all

1000
02:14:57,468 --> 02:15:01,814
A strange face on
this dark night..

1001
02:15:02,467 --> 02:15:06,813
The sight of which
takes your life away

1002
02:15:07,467 --> 02:15:12,644
A fog envelops all

1003
02:15:16,467 --> 02:15:21,644
A fog envelops all

1004
02:15:29,801 --> 02:15:30,905
Simran.

1005
02:15:34,467 --> 02:15:35,810
Kajal.

1006
02:15:46,467 --> 02:15:54,818
Kajal, Kajal, Kajal.

1007
02:16:24,467 --> 02:16:25,810
Kajal.

1008
02:19:27,467 --> 02:19:28,810
Anybody there?

1009
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:49,978
Inspector, you? Here? - What're
you doing here at this hour?

1010
02:20:51,467 --> 02:20:53,640
We were going to meet you.
- Me?

1011
02:20:54,467 --> 02:20:56,640
Yes. You called up uncle
Tom and asked us to meet

1012
02:20:57,467 --> 02:21:01,643
But I never called anyone.
- You never called...?

1013
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:04,806
Then the phone call...?

1014
02:21:16,467 --> 02:21:17,969
Simran.

1015
02:21:28,467 --> 02:21:29,969
Simran.

1016
02:25:16,467 --> 02:25:17,969
Kunal...? You?

1017
02:25:23,467 --> 02:25:26,641
You've been doing all this?
- Yes, I

1018
02:25:27,467 --> 02:25:29,970
But why? What for?

1019
02:25:30,467 --> 02:25:33,812
I want to avenge uncle Tom's
Insults from Simran

1020
02:25:34,467 --> 02:25:36,811
From me...?
- Yes, from you

1021
02:25:37,467 --> 02:25:42,815
Because your father was once
uncle Tom's partner in business

1022
02:25:44,467 --> 02:25:48,813
For his avariciousness,
he duped uncle Tom

1023
02:25:49,467 --> 02:25:53,813
What are you saying, Kunal?
I don't understand a thing

1024
02:25:54,467 --> 02:25:56,640
But I understood that very
day.. .. and elicit millions

1025
02:25:58,467 --> 02:26:04,816
when Vikram came home to
meet me and uncle Tom

1026
02:26:05,467 --> 02:26:10,815
This is Rakesh Malhotra.
Simran's father. A licentious man

1027
02:26:12,467 --> 02:26:14,640
I worked for him, and Tom
was his business partner

1028
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:20,810
Tom made wax mannequins,
and Rakesh exported them

1029
02:26:21,467 --> 02:26:24,812
Due to Rakesh's lax, they
began to suffer losses

1030
02:26:25,467 --> 02:26:28,812
That's when he thought
up an evil plan

1031
02:26:30,467 --> 02:26:35,815
He planned to set the warehouse
afire.. In insurance money

1032
02:26:36,467 --> 02:26:41,644
That night Tom and Rakesh
fought over it

1033
02:26:53,467 --> 02:26:56,971
The warehouse blazed, and
Rakesh Malhotra died

1034
02:26:57,467 --> 02:27:01,813
But the millions in insurance
went to Simran

1035
02:27:03,467 --> 02:27:08,815
Frankly, the money belongs
to you and uncle Tom

1036
02:27:10,467 --> 02:27:12,970
You can get your money back..

1037
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:18,976
If Tom heeds me

1038
02:27:20,467 --> 02:27:24,813
What will I have to do?
- You are a genius

1039
02:27:25,467 --> 02:27:30,815
You have the expertise. You
must've created many faces..

1040
02:27:31,801 --> 02:27:38,980
But you got to make one more.
The face of death

1041
02:27:41,467 --> 02:27:46,974
I and Vikram masked ourselves
with the face of death

1042
02:27:48,801 --> 02:27:53,978
I and Vikram took turns
in wearing the mask

1043
02:27:54,467 --> 02:27:57,641
But why?
- The intention was..

1044
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,977
To drive Simran crazy if
not to commit suicide

1045
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:04,973
Commit suicide...?
- As per the will..

1046
02:28:05,467 --> 02:28:08,812
In case of Simran's death, or
In case she goes insane..

1047
02:28:08,867 --> 02:28:14,977
Kajal will have the right
to her entire wealth

1048
02:28:15,467 --> 02:28:20,974
In other words, the entire
estate will belong to me

1049
02:28:21,467 --> 02:28:28,976
But how did uncle harm you?
- He unmasked me once

1050
02:28:35,467 --> 02:28:38,971
That is why I was
forced to kill him

1051
02:28:40,467 --> 02:28:42,811
Vikram tried to blackmail me

1052
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,974
The bastard asked
for 2.5 million

1053
02:28:48,467 --> 02:28:54,645
So.. so l made
him rest in peace

1054
02:28:57,467 --> 02:28:58,639
Hold it.

1055
02:29:02,467 --> 02:29:08,816
My destination was at hand..
so near, but you..

1056
02:29:09,467 --> 02:29:10,969
You unmasked me

1057
02:29:12,467 --> 02:29:15,641
And now, you must die, Sameer

1058
02:29:16,467 --> 02:29:17,639
No Kunal!

1059
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:20,806
No Kunal, you can't do this

1060
02:29:20,867 --> 02:29:22,972
I can! And I will!

1061
02:29:25,467 --> 02:29:33,818
Kunal, don't! Stop it, Kunal!

1062
02:29:35,467 --> 02:29:42,817
Are you crazy? Stop it, Kunal

1063
02:29:43,467 --> 02:29:44,969
Sameer.

1064
02:29:45,467 --> 02:29:47,811
Kunal, don't!

1065
02:30:00,467 --> 02:30:04,813
Kunal! No, Kunal!

1066
02:30:06,467 --> 02:30:11,974
What have you done, Kunal? How
could this happen to you?

1067
02:30:12,467 --> 02:30:16,973
How could this happen, Kunal?
- Why did you do this, Kunal?

1068
02:30:17,467 --> 02:30:21,813
Had you even asked once, I'd
have given you all my wealth

1069
02:30:22,467 --> 02:30:24,640
Why did you do this, Kunal?

1070
02:30:27,467 --> 02:30:30,812
Oh, how could this
happen, Kunal?

1071
02:30:34,467 --> 02:30:38,973
Simran.. forgive me.
- Don't, Kunal! Don't!

1072
02:30:39,467 --> 02:30:46,646
No Kunal! Why did you do this?
Tell me my friend, why?

1073
02:30:47,467 --> 02:30:50,812
Speak, Kunal.
