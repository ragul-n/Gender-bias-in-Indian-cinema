weaknesses since childhood.

Ma'am, may I come
in? -Sit, Kunal.

10
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,259
You've only 30 minutes

11
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,300
That's why Kunal put incense
sticks near smoke. .

Vernies! It means Hindi speaking
government school students.

25
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,306
Hello, brother. -Hi.

26
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,437
Kids, they think Sushi is

Komal !

38
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:53,479
How can fake fire alarm be
set off in a month thrice?

39
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,217
Don't you get it, you dumbo!

40
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,479

What is this?

43
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,349
These rich kids think the
world is their dustbin.

44
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:28,443
The age at which all kids
started talking mom, papa. .

45
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:34,358
. .grandpa, Sameer spoke the most
important word of his life.

46
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,416
Food !

47
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,430
Other kids would try for toys
or because of stomach ache. .

48
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,425
. .or not to go to school.

49
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:45,369
But neither stomach ache, toys
or school bother Sameer.

Rohan's problem is the same as
of all the kids of the world.

56
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,316
Since 3 years of age he started

00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,494
At least he tried to do so.

00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,247
Brother, the doIphin
isn't amiabIe.

178
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,344
It went there.

179
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,479
The water is gushing in.

180
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,390
And Sameer! Don't wait.

181
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,329
Keep rowing ! Keep rowing !

182
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,492
Everybody, keep rowing !
Keep rowing !

183
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,506
What a beautifuI isIand !

184
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,476
Brother, phone mom.

185
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,374
I want to go home.

186
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,510
Hurry up.

187
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,481
Which pIace is this?

188
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,352
I don't know. -There is
no network signaI.

189
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,254
Strange.

190
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:52,360
On unknown path. .

191
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,402
Oh my God ! This is stranger
than strange.

192
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:04,372
These Vernies are
praying in Hindi.

193
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,216
How LL!

194
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,418
And this girI Iooks so strange.

195
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,351
Forget two words, she can't
speak even a singIe word.

196
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,324
She can speak, but she doesn't
taIk rubbish Iike you.

197
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,392
Stupid.

198
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,364
You're stupid. -Yes. -And
your younger sister.

199
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,536
She can't even speak a word.

200
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,368
What? What did you say?

201
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,349
Sameer!

202
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,353
Oh God ! -So we're fighting here.

203
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,479
Come on, Sameer. Show him.

204
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,258
Come on ! -Stop it!

205
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,354
Come on. Hit him hard, Sameer.

206
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:55,389
No! Sameer stop.

207
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
I'II hit you.

208
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,331
Sameer. Sameer, come on.

209
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,510
Goon is hitting my brother.
Murder! Murder!

210
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,449
Don't spare him !

211
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,238
Ham and chicken sandwich? -Yes.

212
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,345
With Meu. . -Yes.

213
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,259
Brother, Iook. These Vernies
are steaIing our food.

214
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:02,390
God knows how we got stuck in
this isIand with the Vernies.

215
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,298
Sameer, why don't you eat
your own Iunch box.

216
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,364
Anyway, aunt has toId you
not to eat chicken.

217
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,500
KomaI, nobody wiII
steaI your food.

218
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,269
Listen.

219
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,382
We've to take care of our
Iunchboxes and water bottIe.

220
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,443
We'II need them.

221
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,322
God knows what kind of
peopIe Iive here.

222
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,455
And we've no money to
buy food for aII.

223
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,398
Brother, it must be a pIan
of these Vernies. .

224
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,334
. .so that we hand them
aII our food.

225
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,297
KomaI, if you've so much
probIem, don't stand here.

226
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,310
Get Iost. -Why? -ExactIy.

227
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,472
Come on, KomaI. Let's
go separate.

228
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,414
We might find an
airport or ship.

229
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,381
We might find something
for sure.

230
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,252
Bye. See you Iater, aIIigator.

231
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,348
WiId crocodiIe.

232
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,291
Vernies. -Give me
ham and chicken.

233
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,365
Brother, it's possibIe this
is a Taj property.

234
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,426
Anyway, we've credit
card. Right?

235
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,500
Let's check. Then we'II return
to Mumbai tomorrow.

236
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,248
Instead of Taj property it Iooks
Iike Jim Corbett park.

237
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,318
Jim Corbett? Who is he?

238
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,510
The name sounds famiIiar.

239
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,220
Jim Corbett Park. Didn't you read
in Geography? Chapter six.

240
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,293
This is the oIdest
park of India.

241
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,487
Tiger project was started here.

242
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,489
WeII, I don't know about tiger,
but it seems Iike a forest.

243
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,303
I feeI that someone
is foIIowing us.

244
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,441
What if this is reaIIy
Jim Corbett Park?

245
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,369
I'm famished. WiII there
be trees with fruits?

246
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,241
Monkey.

247
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,542
Fine. If I find something
to eat, I won't teII you.

248
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,220
No. I saw a monkey
there. ReaIIy.

249
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,325
Yeah. Right. But
I didn't see it.

250
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,494
What's that?

251
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,443
Easy! Don't aIert him
of our presence.

252
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,344
CarefuIIy. Come.

253
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,516
Run ! Run ! Tiger.

254
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,287
Come on. -Run !

255
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,334
Tiger!

256
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,316
I can't beIieve it.

257
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,353
We're stuck in a forest.

258
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,316
In a forest! In the
middIe of an ocean.

259
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,452
Are there cows in a forest?

260
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:22,390
I'm so hungry that I
can even drink miIk.

261
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,495
Do you sIeep in aII cIasses?

262
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,339
Don't you know that there
are no cows in a forest?

263
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,307
Sameer, don't you know that?

264
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,305
Oh. . what's that?

265
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,405
Rohan, where are you going?

266
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,440
Wow! Fruits!

267
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,249
Move aside. Fruits.

268
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,217
I ate so much fruits Iast time
during Durga FestivaI.

269
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,413
Thank God.

270
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,485
Hi, guys.

271
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,296
You guys? -Yes.

272
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,266
Were you foIIowing us?

273
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,476
Eat fruits.

274
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,473
Stop it, KomaI. Don't eat that.

275
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,373
I want to eat.

276
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,508
Why did you throw the fruits?

277
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,282
Listen, cIass monitor.
This is a forest.

278
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:21,223
Do you think these fruits came
near our boat automaticaIIy?

279
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,486
Lion can't keep them so some
human must've done it.

280
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:29,299
It means this pIace isn't
totaIIy a forest.

281
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,469
You're suspicious!
And we're safe.

282
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,465
What if these fruits
are poisonous?

283
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,477
Look. Riddhi Iooks Iike
mini MotherIand.

284
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,312
Do you've a probIem
with that? -No way.

285
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,223
Patriotism is the end. And
that's the cooIest thing.

286
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,454
She Iooks so hip and happening.

287
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,521
My India is great!

288
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,290
Big man ! PIease put me down.

289
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,335
Do you aIways carry your
fIag in your bag?

290
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,495
Yes, she does. Do you've
a probIem, KunaI?

291
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,469
This Indian fIag can
take you back.

292
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,402
You're Iucky tomorrow
is Independent Day.

293
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,313
And as a cIass monitor
Riddhi Sharma. .

294
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,341
. .was given this responsibiIity.

295
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:25,518
So I'm carrying Indian fIag now
because I'm the cIass monitor.

296
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,517
Riddhi gives same answer if
we ask her any question.

297
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,330
Because I'm the cIass monitor.

298
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,386
Shut up, Sameer.

299
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,480
What is that?

300
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,493
It Iooks Iike a cow.

301
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,280
Guys, I saw a cow.

302
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,285
Get up. Get up. I saw a cow.

303
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:31,216
Guys, come on. Wake
up. I saw a cow.

304
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,450
What is it, Sameer? -I saw
a cow. Get up quickIy.

305
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,516
There are now cows in
a forest, Sameer.

306
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,229
There is one. I saw it there.

307
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,355
Let's go and catch him.
-PIease. -Quick.

308
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,265
There are no cows in a forest.

309
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,360
I'm not used to earIy morning.

310
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,495
Get up. Don't waste time.

311
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,500
Even KomaI knows that.

312
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,266
If KomaI knows it then it
must sureIy be wrong.

313
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,470
The way shark aren't doIphins,
there are cows in a forest.

314
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,340
Get up now. At Ieast
we can drink miIk.

315
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,247
Come on. Get up. -We've
to go now.

316
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,454
Come on. Get up now.

317
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,415
If cow Ieaves, we won't
get miIk. -Come.

318
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,358
Come on. Get up. KomaI, get up.

319
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,485
KunaI, get up now.

320
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,485
Come on. Fast.

321
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,426
Come on. Fast. -Take
your Iuggage.

322
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,361
Come on. Hurry. Don't
waste time.

323
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,271
I'II show you.

324
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,367
Where is it?

325
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:29,508
Cow was here.

326
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,215
Come on. It must
be inside. Come.

327
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,446
Do you want us to enter
the forest. -Brother. .

328
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,456
. .I think Sameer's brain
has stopped. .

329
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,390
. .working after yesterday's
fight.

330
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,359
I'm teIIing the truth.
I saw the cow.

331
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,224
Sameer, Iion is there.

332
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,423
If cow had been there, Iion
wouId've eaten it.

333
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,400
If we enter, it wiII
devour us too.

334
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,261
MiIk. MiIk is wonderfuI.

335
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,238
We can drink every
day a gIass fuII.

336
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,298
Sameer, there are now
cows in the forest.

337
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,239
Sameer. He's right.

338
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,371
Oh my God. Riddhi, you're
taking KomaI's side.

339
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,315
Oh my God. I know.

340
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:10,386
When I met KomaI I feIt nobody
can be more stupid than her.

341
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,514
But Sameer, you're more
stupid than KomaI.

342
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,262
Hey, why doesn't anyone speak?
Why are you so quiet?

343
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,264
I think zip of my bag
isn't working.

344
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,358
Rohan, heIp me. -Riddhi.

345
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,435
Oh. . -Riddhi, run !

346
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,336
Riddhi, run ! -Come on. Fast.

347
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,433
Riddhi, run. Run. -Riddhi !

348
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,504
Hey, why are running?

349
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,276
Riddhi, run ! Riddhi !

00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,338
Riddhi !

351
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,428
Riddhi. Riddhi, come on. Hurry.

352
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,437
Did you see it? Oh
God, it's so huge.

353
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,269
Who is it?

354
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,280
I've no idea.

355
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,478
We were never taught in
any cIass about him.

356
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,425
I think he's a thief.

357
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,419
HeIIo! He's taking my bag.

358
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,294
Guys, stop him. . -Riddhi, stop.

359
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,493
Riddhi, don't go. -My
homework is in it.

360
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,399
Rohan, Iet me go.

361
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,200
Let it go. -My geography

362
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,465
Riddhi, don't go.

363
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,408
Brother. . -Riddhi.
-I won't go. Ok?

364
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:40,506
Stay here.

365
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,539
Riddhi ! Riddhi ! -My geography
homework is in it. Let me go.

366
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,444
No. . -Riddhi !

367
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,345
Free your mind.

368
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,478
PIay the game.

369
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,390
Excuse me. This is my bag.

370
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,430

00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,232

Big man ! PIease put me down.

374
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,395
Put her down.

375
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,211
PIease. Down. .

376
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,439
I said put her down.

377
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,502
Leave my sister.

378
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,477
I think he doesn't understand
EngIish.

379
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,479
He Iooks so Vermy.

380
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,380
Let's try in Hindi.

381
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:29,222
Brother, can you pIease
put her down?

382
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,297

PIease, put her down.

385

PIease Ieave her. PIease.

386
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,339
Thank you.

387
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,278
Hey, are you hurt?

388
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,465
Be carefuI.

389
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,383
Are you fine?

390
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:24,231
VaIi's cIenched fist
has favor of destiny.

391
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,427
Favor of destiny.

392
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,435
Who are you? -I'm Ramaa.

393
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,341
Do you work in a hoteI?

394
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,249
What was that? Is this
a forest reserve?

395
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,310
Thank you so much.

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,454
You heIped us so much.

397
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,284
We want to go home.
-Can you heIp us?

398
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,263
I don't think he'II.

399
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,255
I want to go home.

400
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,268
Brother KunaI, check
the network.

401
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,431
No network.

402
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,378
What is this?

403
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,276
This is a phone. Phone.

404
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,506
Oh my God. Phone caII !

405
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,344
KunaI, phone is ringing.
Answer it quickIy.

406
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,287
Answer the phone. Quick.

407
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,519
HeIIo. KomaI here.

408
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,454
Loan ! We don't want
it. . -KomaI. .

409
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,365
HeIIo. Listen. -KomaI,
teII them we're here.

410
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,370
KomaI, teII them. -Ok, yeah. .

411
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,428
Battery dead.

412
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,273
KomaI, I toId you to
give me the phone.

413
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,333
This is my phone. It
was a wrong number.

414
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,473
This was our Iast chance.
We Iost it.

415
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,312
Battery is dead too.
Now what wiII we do?

416
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,408
What did I do?

417
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,323
This battery is dead. So how
wiII it get charged again?

418
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,419
For that we need a charger.

419
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,289
First we'II answer question
then hear probIems. .

420
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,231
I don't want to hear
any question.

421
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,235
I'm hungry. Everyone
is hungry here.

422
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,430
Ask Ramaa what he eats.

423
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,501
You ask him.

424
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,269
I kept food for you.

425
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,209
You kept those fruits?

426
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,274
We threw them.

427
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,413
We thought they were poisonous.

428
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,291
Do you've anything eIse to eat?

429
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,327
Yes. Come.

430
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,333
WiII he devour us?

431
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,469
Let's go. Let's foIIow him.

432
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,239
Where did he go?

433
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,434
They ruffIe.

434
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:25,247
WiId breeze.

435
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:31,421
Branches of the tress gIare.

436
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,451
Birds try to scare.

437
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,242
They ruffIe. .

438
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,280
WiId breeze.

439
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:14,364
Branches of the tress gIare.

440
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,399
Birds try to scare.

441
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:02,402
We've Iost the path back home.

442
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:06,312
AII directions are strange.

443
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,347
There is neither
road nor Iane.

444
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,483
How did this happen?

445
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:23,432
Beast yeII in broad dayIight.

446
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,235
Even the bear roars.

447
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:11,504
Nights are dark, but stiII. .

448
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,218
. .the day Iight seems afar.

449
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:22,324
The support of a hand. .

450
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,394
. .has brought smiIe
on the face.

451
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,493
They ruffIe. .

452
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,237
WiId breeze.

453
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:43,411
Branches of the tress gIare.

454
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,249
Birds try to scare.

455
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,492
They ruffIe. .

456
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,474
KaIi, this is the isIand.

457
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,214
This is the right pIace.

458
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,482
As per my caIcuIation. .

459
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,350
. .aII the data suggests this.

460
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,233
KaIi, this is a smaII box.
It must've fIoated here.

461
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,460
If someone had come Iooking
for treasure. .

462
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,437
. .we wouId've seen
a ship or boat.

463
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,308
I've to doubIe check few things.

464
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,382
But we've reached the right
pIace. FinaIIy. -Samara. .

465
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,442
. .are you sure we're
at the right. .

466
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,453
. .isIand we've been Iooking for?

467
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,223
I checked many isIands with
you for three years.

468
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,455
I had doubts if there was
a pIace Iike Azra.

469
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,261
I didn't spend these three
years with you on ship. .

470
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,494
. .but with myseIf in Azra.

471
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,432
I'm sure, weIcome to Azra.

472
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,415
I woke up many nights thinking. .

473
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,419
. .if I dreamt of Azra. .

474
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,514
. .or I'm in Azra and this
worId is a dream?

475
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,264
VaIi kept me away from Azra and
gave me time and opportunity.

476
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,197
VaIi is my brother.

477
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,476
But VaIi tried to keep
everything for himseIf.

478
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,405
My desires were IittIe. .

479
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,509
. .to conquer the entire worId.

480
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,347
Was I wrong?

481
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,507
Is this house made by Ramaa?

482
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,368
Where is the bedroom?

483
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,439
There is no bathroom.

484
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,306
There isn't a kitchen !

485
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,444
There is onIy one room.

486
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,419
How do peopIe Iive here?

487
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,229
We've to adjust. Did
you get that?

488
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,489
Learn to adjust.

489
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,401
Here. Have a banana. -Banana?

490
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,305
Is it from Supermarket or not?

491
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,499
Is it hygienic or not?

492
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,379
ShouId I eat it? I don't think.

493
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,441
I shouIdn't eat it.
-Then don't eat it.

494
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,216
Ramaa, hang on.

495
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,450
We can make boat.

496
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,356
With Ramaa's heIp we can make
a new boat and get out.

497
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,425
Ramaa, we need your heIp?

498
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,430
Boat? -Yeah. Right.

499
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,431
We can make a Boeing 7 4 7 with
Ramaa's heIp and get out of here.

500
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,504
Dude, do you reaIize. .

501
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,509
He can't speak properIy
and he'II make a boat.

502
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,479
Boat is made with
hands, not words.

503
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,381
That's where you're wrong, man.

504
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,516
We need brains to make a boat.

505
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,453
You don't have it.

506
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,424
And the Iess said about
him, the better.

507
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,199
PeopIe must be Iooking for us.

508
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,262
Mom, dad and poIice.

509
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,329
We just have to wait.

510
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,334
Ok. You can wait.

511
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,506
We'II try to Ieave.

512
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,476
We're going to make a boat.

513
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,289
As per this, the treasure
must be. .

514
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,352
. .on the west of the dried Iake.

515
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,307
Samara, are you sure. .

516
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,446
Yes. KaIi gave me these maps.

517
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,504
What if it's wrong?

518
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,411
Then the treasure wasn't ours.

519
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:30,323
Do you think onIy we
hunt for things.

520
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,287
Things Iook for us too.

521
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:00,482
Ramaa never thought when he'II
meet VaIi again. .

522
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,384
. .it wiII be Iike this.

523
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,363
Ramaa didn't even think that. .

524
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:12,530
. .the work for which VaIi
prepared him, was here.

525
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,402
I, KaIi, has come.

526
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,242
Azra is onIy mine.

527
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,409
VaIi made Ramaa Azra's protector
after I Ieft.

528
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,216
And he kept wandering
in the forest.

529
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,385
Because VaIi had Iost his
crystaI and souI too.

530
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,420
He was waiting for Ramaa to
prepare for the finaI battIe.

531
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,457
And he prepared Ramaa. .

532
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,529
. .against me.

533
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,409
This time. .

534
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:08,322
. .the cIenched fist wiII be
supported by hand with dagger.

535
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,456
My men were ready.

536
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,269
I gave my powers to
the three of them.

537
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,364
I was so powerfuI. .

538
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,502
. .that I was ready to
get my Iost crystaI.

539
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,414
Samara was taking to
the right path. .

540
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,346
. .with the heIp of that book.

541
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,344
I was sure that this time there
won't be any mistake.

542
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,501
Brother, pIease. Get up.

543
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,274
Get up. PIease.

544
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,440
Brother, get up.

545
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,382
Wake up. I'm tired trying
to wake you up.

546
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,386
Brother. Wake up.

547
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,347
Get up.

548
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,289
Brother. . pIease. -Ramaa,
can I ask something?

549
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,290
Brother, pIease. . -WiII
you answer me honestIy?

550
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,488
Is this a TV show?

551
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,232
Brother, pIease wake up. PIease.

552
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,393
Hey, guys. I've thought
a Iot about it.

553
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,396
Doesn't this seem to be strange?

554
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,365
First we reached a
boat from Mumbai.

555
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,306
Then shark tried to eat us.

556
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,480
We reached this isIand.

557
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,346
Then we met Ramaa.

558
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:44,476
We've to make a simiIar boat
and return to Mumbai.

559
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,381
So? -So what? Doesn't I
Iook Iike a TV show.

560
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,289
There must be hidden cameras.

561
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,522
Where are the cameras?

562
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,424
Ramaa must know about it.

563
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:04,363
Do you think Ramaa
is Iying to us?

564
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,388
KomaI, why are you aping Rohan?

565
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,465
I'm heIping him, not aping him.

566
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,494
KomaI is heIping !

567
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,198
I know, you too doubt that we
may be in a reaIity show.

568
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,311
And that's why you're
pretending to heIp.

569
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:11,273
It's possibIe these birds never
saw anyone cutting trees.

570
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,311
That's why they seem
to be bothered.

571
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,446
It seems someone is aIready
on this isIand.

572
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,380
It's possibIe.

573
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,485
Do you know what
I miss the most?

574
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,320
My manicure kit.

575
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,490
Mom gave me from Harry's.

576
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,334
Look at my naiIs. . Oh !

577
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,312
UncIe. .

578
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,403
UncIe. .

579
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,212
UncIe. UncIe.

580
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,345
UncIe. .

581
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,462
What are you doing
here? -Leave me.

582
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,407
Leave me. -Did you
make this house?

583
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,278
Leave me. -Quiet!

584
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,440
Leave me! -Quiet! -Leave me.

585
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,423
KaIi is powerfuI.

586
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,327
Everyone bows to KaIi's power.

587
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,524
But I wanted onIy KaIi
shouId be the power.

588
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,427
If I say, it wiII be good.

589
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,338
If I say, it wiII be bad.

590
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,437
I want to end the difference
between good and bad.

591
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,411
There wiII be onIy KaIi.

592
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,341
KaIi. . KaIi, this isIand. .

593
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,438
Do you know why the trees
are so strange here.

594
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,377
We never saw them eIsewhere.

595
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,217
Because these trees
and pIants are. .

596
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,218
. .extinct thousands
of years ago.

597
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,518
Ramaa, we've to find brother.

598
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,227
We he isn't found, what
wiII happen to me?

599
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,422
PIease heIp us, Ramaa.

600
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,489
Anyway, the river we're
Iooking for. .

601
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,528
. .might be under the
ground or dried up.

602
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,372
And our men can't
find it so soon.

603
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,298
Leave me.

604
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,443
Where did you bring
me? Leave me.

605
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,446
Leave me.

606
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,370
Leave me.

607
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,341
I've to go home.

608
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,411
KaIi we found him in the forest.

609
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,317
He has been staying
here for many days.

610
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,285
I came day before yesterday.

611
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,220
I've to go home.

612
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,352
He's Iying. How did you make a
house in a forest in one day?

613
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,429
I didn't make that house.

614
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,397
You're Iying. He's Iying again.

615
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,422
Shut up, Jaggi.

616
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,232
He's isn't Iying.

617
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,273
Such a smaII kid can't make a
house aIone in this forest.

618
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,435
Many tribaI peopIe can do
it since chiIdhood.

619
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,471
If he's here since chiIdhood. .

620
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,276
. .he must've Iearnt how
to make a house.

621
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,515
KaIi. We came to Iook for
treasure with them?

622
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,380
We won't find anything.

623
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,255
BismiI, he's wearing
a schooI uniform.

624
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,292
He Iooks Iike a tribaI
boy to you?

625
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,402
UncIe. . mom. . oh God !

626
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,471
No, uncIe. I didn't
make that house.

627
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,345
UncIe. I didn't make that house.

628
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,475
UncIe. I didn't make that house.

629
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,252
UncIe, Ieave me.

630
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,221
Ramaa, they're not good
guys, but bad ones.

631
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,259
I don't know how we reach here.
We were pIaying games.

632
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,488
My friends were with me. They
went to make a boat.

633
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,422
Ramaa heIped us.

634
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,489
It's Ramaa's house. Ask him.

635
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,430
Bad man, pIease Ieave
me. PIease.

636
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,301
Why does KunaI have to teII
everything in detaiI?

637
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,408
How Iong has Ramaa been staying
in this forest?

638
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,434
I don't know. But Ramaa
Iives in this forest.

639
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,246
Stop, Ramaa. -No, Ramaa.

640
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,247
KaIi, our probIem is soIved.

641
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,354
Whoever Ramaa is, he'II
take us to dried Iake.

642
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,511
I know. .

643
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,259
I know to which Iake
they want to go.

644
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:01,286
If you take them to the Iake, do
you think they'II Iet you go?

645
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,332
I don't know where Ramaa is.

646
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,391
I'II teII you.

647
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,265
PIease Ieave me.

648
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,295
I think he's right, KaIi.

649
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,240
We've to save my brother.

650
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,274
He's my twin.

651
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,314
I'II die too if anything
happens to him.

652
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,441
Go home. I'II bring KunaI.

653
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,354
I want my brother right now.

654
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,285
No, Ramaa. No.

655
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,486
Ok. Ok. Come with me.

656
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,340
Come quickIy. -First untie me.

657
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,519
Ramaa. .

658
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,481
Samara. .

659
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,469
You've to take us to Ramaa.

660
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,464
If you don't do that. .

661
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:27,273
. .then we'II feed you to the
Iion from this forest. .

662
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,237
. .who Iikes to eat kids
for breakfast.

663
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,385
As Iong as Ramaa is with
me, Iion can't harm me.

664
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,313
AII the animaIs Iisten to Ramaa.

665
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,221
Is it important to teII
everything in detaiI?

666
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,362
Ok, aII the animaIs
Iisten to Ramaa?

667
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,259
Jaggi.

668
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,421
He's some other kid.

669
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,293
How can there be other
kid on this isIand?

670
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,497
Ramaa. Ramaa, where are you?

671
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,297
Oh God.

672
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,309
This kid isn't the one
we had earIier.

673
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:05,277
His cIothes are different. The
other kid was a IittIe stupid.

674
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,471
I hate her.

675
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,276
If this kid is found here, and
the other kid is missing. .

676
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,389
. .so it means Ramaa and other
kids wiII be here too.

677
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,450
It means. .

678
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,367
BismiI, where is that boy?

679
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,434
He's Ieft behind.

680
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,441
Anyway, he was the wrong
boy. Come on.

681
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,415
Leave me. Let me go.

682
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,430
Come on.

683
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,410
Ramaa. Ramaa.

684
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,482
Ramaa.

685
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,432
Aunt, why do you want
to kiII my Ramaa?

686
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,461
Aunt, don't touch my Ramaa.

687
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,260
He's my Ramaa.

688
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,358
Ramaa, get up. They'II kiII us.

689
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,351
Leave me. Leave me.

690
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,395
Let go. Ramaa !

691
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,404
Move.

692
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,240
Move.

693
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,369
Ramaa. -Ramaa.

694
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,470
Ramaa.

695
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,373
Ramaa.

696
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,480
They're eviI.

697
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,515
Leave me. Leave me.

698
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,249
Snake!

699
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,487
Ramaa. Let go. Come on.

700
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,261
Ramaa, pIease save us.

701
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,492
Ramaa.

702
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,273
You're from this forest. .

703
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,210
. .you wouId know about Dry Lake.

704
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,339
We need to go there.

705
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,281
Ramaa, don't teII them anything.

706
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,209
Ramaa.

707
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,368
Rohan.

708
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,271
Where is Rohan?

709
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,480
Ramaa.

710
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,472
Ramaa, we've to do something.

711
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:46,411
Ramaa, I don't want to die.

712
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,451
PIease save me.

713
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,261
Nothing wiII happen to
you, KomaI. -And me?

714
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,360
Nothing wiII happen to anyone.

715
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,312
HeIp!

716
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,444
HeIp!

717
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,381
I think Rama is caIIing
us there.

718
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,340
How do you know?

719
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,414
I know. Ramaa often teIIs
me things Iike that. .

720
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,259
. .Iike he's fixed in my mind.

721
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,282
Why you?

722
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,490
It's possibIe, because Riddhi
is cIass monitor.

723
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,298
Oh ! -It's possibIe.

724
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,461
Because I'm cIass monitor.

725
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:45,433
So Ramaa thinks I'm the wisest
and most responsibIe one.

726
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,243
Riddhi, pIease zip it.

727
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,517
We're Iooking for the treasure.

728
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,317
But we're Iooking for
something eIse. .

729
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,294
. .which KaIi isn't teIIing us.

730
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:13,268
So much power. . such power. .
why does KaIi want it?

731
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,405
What does KaIi so
desperateIy want?

732
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,500
I don't trust KaIi.
He has changed.

733
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,336
I don't even Iike KaIi.

734
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,249
Ramaa knows the whereabouts
of the treasure.

735
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,475
KaIi wants the treasure.

736
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,311
I've to stop KaIi.

737
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,382
Never thought I'd say it. .

738
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:42,321
. .but KaIi's presence so cIose
to the treasure isn't good now.

739
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:45,264
EarIier everyone used
to get aII the. .

740
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,393
. .information in
aII operations.

741
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,361
I don't Iike the way this
game is being pIayed.

742
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,374
Samara, time for you to Ieave.

743
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,502
Now you've to pIay this
treasure hunt. .

744
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,369
. .on behaIf of the other team.

745
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,306
I need more time to know what
we're actuaIIy Iooking for.

746
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,278
I hate those kids
and that Tarzan.

747
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,245
Do I've a choice?

748
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,253
I'II have to do it.

749
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,294
I brought KaIi tiII here.

750
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,423
I've to reach the treasure
before KaIi.

751
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,299
Ok, KaIi. Have it your way.

752
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,504
Samara !

753
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,354
HeIp!

754
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,493
HeIp!

755
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,412
Is this a gun?

756
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:15,476
I wouIdn't have heIped you if
I had to take you to KaIi.

757
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,487
I know from where you got it.

758
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,448
Such a smaII boy shouIdn't
be interested in gun.

759
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:23,347
Yeah, right.

760
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,359
Such a smaII boy shouIdn't even
be in this forest, aunt.

761
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,388
Samara.

762
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,457
OnIy Samara.

763
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,261
Samara. Ok, Samara.

764
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,309
Aunt Samara.

765
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,315
Rohan.

766
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,381
Rohan. -Rohan.

767
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,442
Rohan. -Riddhi.

768
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,476
Hi, Rohan. -Sameer.

769
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:53,447
Rohan. -Are you fine?

770
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:55,480
Rohan, where were you?

771
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,492
I feII in a big ditch
whiIe running.

772
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,420
Samara got me out of it.

773
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,321
Now I'm not with KaIi.

774
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,324
How can we know that
you're no Iying?

775
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:08,494
You want Ramaa to take
you to that treasure.

776
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,431
I know you won't trust
me on that.

777
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,440
But if you stiII think
I'm Iying, I'II Ieave.

778
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,438
Anyway there is no treasure
on this isIand.

779
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,471
I knew it. Didn't I say
it was a TV show?

780
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,442
Oh my God !

781
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,377
AII those seems so reaI. .

782
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,513
. .especiaIIy that Jaggu.

783
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,483
Did you seriousIy notice
anything? -Like what?

784
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,425
Have you seen these fIowers
anywhere eIse?

785
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,224
Yes. There are such fIowers
in the entire forest.

786
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:35,285
Do you want it?

787
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,488
Do you know its name?

788
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,299
These were extinct from this
worId thousand of years ago.

789
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,331
Do you know what it
means? -Oh, fish.

790
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,333
We've traveIed through time.

791
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,307
It means we reached thousand
of years back.

792
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,508
CooI ! -Time traveI.

793
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,340
My TV show theory was
better than this.

794
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,354
I agree. Who can traveI
through time?

795
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,353
How stupid, Rohan?

796
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,417
Ever since we came to this
isIand we're Iooking for cameras.

797
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,388
Did we find them? No.

798
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,230
KomaI, you're supporting
Sameer. .

799
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,392
. .because he heIped
you Iast night.

800
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,260
Sameer.

801
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,332
Ok, stop it, guys. This
isn't a TV show.

802
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,273
We neither traveIed
through time.

803
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,345
Nobody has changed here
because nobody. .

804
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,245
. .came here for thousand
of years.

805
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,250
Strange, but true.

806
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,483
Wtih this map I've an idea
of a path to the river.

807
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,314
I need your heIp to reach there.

808
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,223
Just a minute. Just a minute.

809
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,454
Why wiII Ramaa heIp you?

810
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,263
Because if Ramaa doesn't
heIp me. .

811
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,266
. .KaIi wiII reach
there before us.

812
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,302
KaIi wiII get what he wants
and then kiII us.

813
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,461
I've his research maps and
documents. With their heIp. .

814
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,268
You've maps?

815
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,477
Yes. Not the exact Iocation,
but I've made a map.

816
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,317
Run !

817
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,355
Run ! Run after them.

818
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,223
Nab them. They're running away.

819
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,331
KomaI, come from this side.

820
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,262
Run ! -There they're.

821
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,260
KomaI !

822
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:24,463
KomaI ! KomaI !

823
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,205
KomaI ! KomaI !

824
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:32,514
Riddhi. Riddhi.

825
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,417
Riddhi. Aunt Samara. . Samara. .

826
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,243
Let's rest.

827
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,321
Where are KomaI and Riddhi?

828
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,418
Even aunt Samara isn't here.

829
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,262
How wiII we find Ramaa?

830
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,353
Don't worry.

831
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,499
Riddhi. Riddhi. KomaI.

832
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,326
Don't worry. Samara
is with them.

833
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,463
Did you hear Ramaa's voice?

834
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,407
No.

835
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,470
Aunt Samara, you heard
Ramaa's voice.

836
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,305
How romantic!

837
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,506
Come on. -Nab them.

838
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:13,447
Ro! -Brother KunaI.

839
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,490
KomaI. Riddhi. -Riddhi.

840
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,417
KomaI. Are you okay?

841
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,324
Are you fine? -Yes.

842
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,356
Ro. -Where are you?
-You taIked to me.

843
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,263
Where did he go? -Hi, KomaI.

844
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,429
You toId me the address
of this pIace. But how?

845
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,498
The way I do it aII the time.

846
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,305
The way you do it aII
the time. But how?

847
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,369
The way I did it now.

848
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,248
You asked me the same
thing this morning.

849
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,379
TeIepathy. ExactIy.

850
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,222
That's why aII the animaIs of
the forest understand you.

851
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,359
Ramaa, do you know you're
teIepathic?

852
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,351
It means. .

853
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:57,365
you can make anyone understand
you without taIking to him.

854
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,360
I was at Ieast one kiIometer
away from this pIace.

855
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,266
I heard your voice.

856
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,399
You toId me the whereabouts
of this pIace.

857
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:07,297
And I came here.

858
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,441
Look. What do you see?

859
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,511
Death ! PeopIe are dying.

860
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,289
PeopIe aren't dying, but
someone is kiIIing them.

861
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,451
Now Iook what's on
their cIothes.

862
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,488
This is a symboI.

863
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,425
This is the sketch of
KaIi's medaIIion.

864
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,367
KaIi is a reaI copy cat.

865
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:41,368
The way fake expensive cIothes
are found at fashion street.

866
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,307
He's such a Vermy.

867
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:46,310
KomaI, this is originaI.

868
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,273
What does this originaI
medaIIion does?

869
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,285
WeII. . I want to know that.

870
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:53,443
Anyway. .

871
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,356
. .when KaIi wears this medaIIion
he can do a Iot of things.

872
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,359
Don't you find it strange
that this isIand. .

873
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,453
. .is thousands year
behind our times.

874
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,290
And. . KaIi has that medaIIion.

875
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,493
We've to know about KaIi.

876
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:13,237
Guys, we're not going
on treasure hunt.

877
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,403
We wanted to make a boat to
get out of here, right?

878
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,368
Boat? -Yes.

879
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,314
You found that idea of
boat very stupid.

880
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:24,476
Samara is right.

881
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:30,351
To escape KaIi we've to know
everything about KaIi.

882
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:31,481
And KaIi has a ship. .

883
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,454
. .the onIy way to
get out of here.

884
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,319
Now who is with me?

885
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,324
Isn't there any other way?

886
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,299
Any other option?

887
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,396
Hey, where did Ramaa go?

888
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:45,497
Rohan, did you see him?

889
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:47,501
I don't know. He was
here just now.

890
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,224
QuietIy and steaIthiIy. .

891
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,355
QuietIy and steaIthiIy. .

892
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:54,292
QuietIy and steaIthiIy. .

893
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,412
Everyone Ieft.

894
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:59,450
This time. . there won't
be any mistake.

895
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,312
Ramaa, Samara and kids
were trying hard. .

896
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,371
. .to take me to my destination.

897
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,317
We just had to foIIow them.

898
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,412
WiII we find anything to
eat here? I'm famished.

899
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:28,373
So. . this is the pIace KaIi
has been Iooking for.

900
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,381
Treasure must be here.

901
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,480
So this is the dried Iake.

902
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,217
How cooI is this?

903
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,476
FinaIIy we've reached.

904
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,286
Let me take you guys through
this IittIe story.

905
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,389
This is the pIace from where
the worId started.

906
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,521
When rest of the worId Iived
in forest and caves. .

907
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,525
. .technoIogy of this peopIe was
Iike our or better than ours.

908
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,487
Can you see this?

909
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,293
This is a pIane. .

910
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,401
This is. . Iike a UFO.

911
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,403
Yes. -What is this?

912
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,314
I don't know. Nobody knows.

913
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,442
Anyways, Iook at this.

914
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:37,478
This Iooks Iike KaIi.

915
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,421
This is KaIi. It's
his medaIIion.

916
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,451
3 stones. 3 stones?

917
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:47,386
As far as I can understand. .

918
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:50,293
. .KaIi's medaIIion
protects a stone.

919
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:52,466
With that KaIi gets
speciaI powers.

920
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:57,432
Without touching it, from afar
he can move anything. .

921
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,303
. .he can Iift and
even through it.

922
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,276
You mean, teIekinesis?

923
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,249
Yes. Something Iike that.

924
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:13,378
But so powerfuI that we
can't even imagine.

925
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,415
This is very oId magic.

926
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,485
This magic is as oId
as this worId.

927
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,419
Or you can caII it science.

928
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,320
Whoever they were. .

929
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,356
. .they were more advanced
and powerfuI than us.

930
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,427
So there are 2 more stones Iike
that. What happened to them?

931
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,367
3 famiIies got responsibiIities
to protect each stone.

932
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,370
KaIi used his stone for himseIf.

933
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,511
Something went wrong.
Everything was over.

934
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,387
Nobody knows where the
other two stones are.

935
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,315
One stone controIs the mind.

936
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:56,522
Second stone controIs souI,
spirit or whatever you caII it.

937
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:13,311
So KaIi came to find
these stones. Right?

938
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,377
These three stones wiII
give him the powers. .

939
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,285
. .that he was Iooking for
thousand of years.

940
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,413
To conquer the worId.

941
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:26,324
I know. . extremeIy oId
idea and very boring.

942
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:31,489
KaIi is aIive for thousand of
years. How is it possibIe?

943
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,394
KaIi is aIive for thousand
of years because. .

944
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,430
. .he drinks chocoIate miIk in
the morning and at night.

945
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,368
You've been on this
isIand for so Iong.

946
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:45,311
Now you shouId stop asking
such questions.

947
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:47,415
Anyways. .

948
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,317
. .now we've to concentrate
to make sure. .

949
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,319
. .KaIi doesn't get the
other two stones.

950
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,270
Samara. .

951
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,479
Ramaa. This is the day I
had trained you for.

952
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,473
I trained you for this day.

953
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:25,377
You're face to face with aII the
eviI powers of the worId.

954
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,317
It's caIIed KaIi.

955
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,288
Today I'II be one with you.

956
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,289
We'II fight as one.

957
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:36,328
And with the heIp of the kids,
we'II destroy KaIi's power.

958
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:44,228
Today you've to become our
strength and destroy KaIi.

959
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:47,340
That's why you'II have
to free your mind.

960
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,469
And pIay the game.

961
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,325
No way.

962
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:18,499
Ramaa has the second stone.

963
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,498
Which stone, Samara?

964
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:24,311
Body. .

965
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,347
. .mind. .

966
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,471
. .spirit.

967
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:06,444
Azra's treasure is the biggest
of aII treasures.

968
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:12,259
Because Azra's treasure wiII
make the worId a smaII game. .

969
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:16,419
. .and can give controI of
that worId in one hand.

970
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:21,268
Divided in three parts as
mind, body and souI. .

971
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,464
. .three different crystaIs
have the powers. .

972
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:29,503
. .with which I, KaIi, can
conquer this worId.

973
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:36,279
If I've the three stones,
I'II win the game.

974
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:40,453
This time. . every time
and again and again. .

975
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,486
Listen. .

976
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,303
Come on. Let's move. Run !

977
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:39,237
Be determined ! Be brave!

978
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:43,300
We can stop time and storm.

979
01:34:43,444 --> 01:34:47,380
We wiII get our destination.

980
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:51,512
We've become your support.

981
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:56,447

We wiII move the sky.

987
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:10,293
Unite and vanquish the enemy.

988
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:14,390
We wiII wipe them from
the face of the earth.

989
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,499

confront us again.

01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:14,318
Let a ray disperse
this darkness.

996
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:23,394
Wipe the tears from the eyes.

997
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:28,331
We trust you.

998
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:33,310
We are under your sheIter.

999
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:41,480
Now you're the way to Iife.

1000
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:53,231
Listen, Ramaa ! O' my Ramaa !

1001
01:37:54,435 --> 01:38:01,466

Ramaa, hit him !

1004
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:56,380
Ramaa, come on.

1005
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:35,350
What is this?

1006
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,397
Snake. -Snake!

1007
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,366
Sameer. -Sameer, are you fine?

1008
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:42,230
What is happening?

1009
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:46,228
KaIi want this.

1010
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:49,241
Because he wants to take
over the worId.

1011
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:50,401
KaIi ! -No, Sameer. .

1012
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:51,478
Has he returned?

1013
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:53,480
No, Sameer.

1014
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:56,506

KunaI, why are you
irritating me?

1017
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:05,518
Irritate KaIi if you want.

1018
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,284
That's a good idea.

1019
01:41:12,499 --> 01:41:14,364
Sameer, are you ok?

1020
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:16,426

1069
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,335
I can't do much.

1070

By the way, his eyes are turning
