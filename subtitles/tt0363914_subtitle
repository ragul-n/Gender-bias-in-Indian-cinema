00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:24,891
Fall in love and see!

2
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:46,884
30 for 15, hurry up, bro!

3
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:51,882
30 for 15, hurry up!

4
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,882
30 for 15 is too high, it's double
the amount, reduce it a little.

5
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:56,880
Go to the backside and see, madam,
they're selling it at 3..

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
..times the price. I'm just
selling it at double the amount.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,878
Moreover, it's the show of the
one and only Ravi Kumar.

8
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:16,835
O the delicate,
delicate flowers of love.?

9
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:22,833
O the new springs of beauty!

10
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:36,829
how is it possible that l
won't sing, if you call me??

11
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:57,802
You've loved me.
have loved you.?

12
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:12,798
new songs of love,

13
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:17,796
dance! Dance!?

14
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:21,795
sing! Dance!?

15
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:11,779
l look at you and sing,
you?re the queen of my songs.?

16
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:19,776
Your beauty is my melody.
You are the youth of music!?

17
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,749
have sung songs
and stolen your hearts.?

18
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:49,747
have been accused of theft.
Thank God that..?

19
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:54,745
..that l achieved
your love at least.?

20
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:35,732
Hello?

21
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:39,731
You?re a magician Ravi!
Since the time your voice..

22
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:42,730
..has gone down in my heart,
through my ears..

23
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,729
..every heartbeat
takes your name! Ravi!

24
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,728
So go and consult
some heart specialist.

25
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:52,727
He?ll cure your heartbeats.
Stupid.

26
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:55,726
Ravi, l?m walking on fire.
Your sweet voice..

27
00:08:55,726 --> 00:09:02,724
..your fast paced youth
is killing my every nerve.

28
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:07,721
Ravi, please accept me,
Make me a servant at your feet.

29
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,721
Otherwise l?ll take
poison and commit suicide.

30
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,720
Ravi, please
accept me, please Ravi.

31
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,718
No. This is not possible.
We cannot be united at all.

32
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:25,716
All the girls in this
India are crazy after me.

33
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:28,714
So, should l make all
of them my life companion?

34
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:31,713
Go, go and mind
your own business.

35
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,713
Come to your senses, open
your eyes, and take rest.

36
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:37,712
Go. ? First you open your
eyes and come to your senses.

37
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,712
This bus is to go
from here till there.

38
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,710
it's not for
someone to watch any dreams.

39
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,710
Hey, get up. Get up. ? Hey,
what is it, what is it?

40
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,710
it's day time,
and this is a bus.

41
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,709
That?s all right,
but where is the public?

42
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,708
They have got down
on the previous stop.

43
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,707
O not that public. That
which had come to see my show.

44
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,707
Which had come to see
my dance, to hear my songs?

45
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:56,706
Hey, are you drunk
in the early morning?

46
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,704
l was dreaming that my show
was going on, on the stage.

47
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,703
Hey, where is my darling?

48
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,702
Your darling has run away
with someone else to Darjeeling.

49
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,701
This. l?m saved.

50
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,698
Okay, let?s go.

51
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,697
Sampat Shrivastav.

52
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,693
Excuse me.

53
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:36,693
You?re excused.

54
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:38,692
Do you stay
around here somewhere?

55
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,691
No. l live on the
land of the Moon.

56
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,691
When Armstrong
had gone up there..

57
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,690
..on his return, he
had brought me with him.

58
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,689
Excuse me. l have
committed a mistake.

59
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,688
The poor man seems to be crazy.
- Hey, you. Come here.

60
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,687
Do you think that l?m crazy?

61
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,687
Oh, no sir. How can l
think that you?re crazy?

62
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:58,685
Can l be that daring?

63
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,685
Don?t lie. l read the
message of the heart..

64
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,685
..very clearing on the
letter of the face, son.

65
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,683
What you think about me,
you?re not explaining it.

66
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,683
What you understand,
you?re not explaining it.

67
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,682
l understand everything, yes.

68
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:15,680
Actually, actually, you
seem a strange type of person.

69
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,679
What do you mean
by a strange type?

70
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,679
ls my head down
and are my legs up?

71
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,679
Do l wear
spectacles on my lips..

72
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,678
..and read
newspapers with my ears?

73
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:22,678
Do l look like a leader
who has lost an election?

74
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,677
What?s the matter?
Give me an answer.

75
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:27,676
You don?t have an answer.
l?ll answer. Listen.

76
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,676
Have you ever seen a two
- in - one?

77
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:32,675
Which plays both the
radio as well as a cassette?

78
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,674
Japan?s factory has made a two
- in - one.

79
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,674
The Almighty?s
factory has made me..

80
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:38,672
..hundred - in - one
and sent me down here.

81
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:40,672
l can make
people dance, l can turn them..

82
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:43,671
..l can play them, l can
move them. l can throw them down.

83
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:46,670
That is, in all the work,
that ?can be done? is added..

84
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,669
..l can do all of them.
By the way, where can you do?

85
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:49,670
l mean, where do you stay?

86
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,668
l am not from the
land of the Moon.

87
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,668
l know. You're not
worth Jaslok Hospital..

88
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:55,667
..then how will you
reach the land of the Moon?

89
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:56,667
Where are you going?

90
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,666
Can you tell me
where this man resides?

91
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,665
How is this man related to you?

92
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,664
How are we related?
There?s no relation.

93
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:07,663
it's just that l
know him very well.

94
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,663
Since when do you know him?

95
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:13,662
What? Him? l
know him since ages.

96
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,661
Okay. l can take you to him.
But after going there..

97
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,659
shouldn't be that
he won't recognize you..

98
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:19,660
..and you?ll turn into
water even as you stand there.

99
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,659
l won't turn into
water or anything.

100
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,658
Please take me to him.
Please. It will be a good deed.

101
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,657
Okay. Come. Let?s see. Come.

102
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:30,656
What?s your work with him?

103
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,655
I've been called
by the All Indian ..

104
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:33,655
..Talent Association for
an interview. ? Oh, Okay.

105
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,654
I heard that
person has huge contacts.

106
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,653
That's why I have
come and ask for his help.

107
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,652
Then you have come to the right place.
He has really huge contacts. - OK.

108
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,651
From a minister to a sentry,
he knows everybody.

109
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:47,650
That means, the lock
that doesn't open by a key..

110
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,650
..this man opens
it with his finger.

111
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,649
See, this is house.
Go, go inside.

112
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:52,648
Just ? What is it now?
? Just a minute.

113
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,648
inside, Will be there?

114
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,648
See, my job was to
show you the house.

115
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:57,647
Now it?s your job to
see if he?s inside or not.

116
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,646
By the way, if the stars of
your luck are not in a crowd.

117
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,645
if your boat of luck
doesn't have a hole drilled in it..

118
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:05,644
..by the drill of bad luck, then
this man will definitely be inside.

119
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:09,644
You didn't understand? My
words are a little high level.

120
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,642
Let it go.

121
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:27,637
Mr. Sampat, Sampat Sir,
Brother Sampat.

122
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:31,636
What is it? What is it? Yes?

123
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,636
Does Mr. Sampat reside here?

124
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:37,634
Sampat Shrivastav. ? Yes. ?
You want to meet him? ? Yes.

125
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,634
The person who?s
sitting outside..

126
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,633
..you?re searching
for him in side the house?

127
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:42,632
Yes?

128
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,631
There. That person
who?s sitting on the bench..

129
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,631
..and neighing like a horse,
he is the one.

130
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:50,630
Him?
- Yes. - Him?

131
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,629
Yes. He is the one.
Hearing your shouts of brother..

132
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,628
..Brother,? l came
out of the kitchen.

133
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,628
But he could not do so much as..

134
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,627
..moving his lips a little
bit and ask what the matter is.

135
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:02,626
Why? You won't mend your ways?

136
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,625
You won't do anything
correctly in the world, is it?

137
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,624
Did you feel ashamed to
tell him that you are the one?

138
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,624
You?re sitting here
uselessly and swatting mosquitoes..

139
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,622
..and l was
called from the kitchen.

140
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:14,622
Please forget it,
sister-in-law. ? Hey, you shut up!

141
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,622
Big people don?t meet directly.
Even if they?re sitting at home..

142
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,620
..and swatting mosquitoes,
whenever they have to meet..

143
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
..they meet
through the secretary.

144
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,619
What? Am l your secretary?

145
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:27,618
You are my wife isn't it?
The wife knows every..

146
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,617
..secret of her man,
therefore she?s his secretary.

147
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,616
This is a high level thing.
You won't understand. Go inside.

148
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:35,615
Okay, don't eat my brain now.
I put the food on the stove.

149
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:37,615
Don?t you dare
call me again now..

150
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:39,614
Unemployed and useless,
and the enemy of the grain.

151
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:41,613
The served public.

152
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,613
Should l tell you a secret?

153
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,612
Till date, who ever
has sat on this chair..

154
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,611
..all of them have
reached the heights of the sky.

155
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,610
Actually, Mr. Ravi.
For your job, there?s..

156
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,609
..an expense of thousand rupees.

157
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:56,609
Hey, where have you flown away?

158
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,608
Don?t you want to
reach the heights?

159
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:02,606
But, your friend had told that
this work will be done for free.

160
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,606
For free? For free, even
bugs don?t bite nowadays.

161
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:06,606
Who will arrange a job for you?

162
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,605
But your friend had told me..
? Hey don?t you want to sit

163
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,604
.. on that chair and reach
the heights of the sky? Sit there!

164
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,603
Actually, my friend
is a bit old fashioned.

165
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,602
He prepares his own meals.
He shaves with his own razor.

166
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:17,602
What does he know,
in the car of life..

167
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,601
.how important the
Tyre of money actually is.

168
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,600
In today's life, without money,
a woman won't allow her ...

169
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
..husband inside the house,
children don?t respect the father..

170
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,599
..and the public doesn't
give votes to the leader.

171
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,599
In today's world, one
man can remain without air ...

172
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,597
..but he can't
survive without money.

173
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,597
This job that you want,
where is its office?

174
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,597
in Delhi. ? Tell me now.
Bombay to Delhi ..

175
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,596
..Delhi to Bombay, Bombay
to Delhi, Delhi to Bombay.

176
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:36,596
l?ll have to make
so many calls, that..

177
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,595
..thousand rupees will only
bear the telephone expenses.

178
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,594
But, at this time, l
don?t have this much money.

179
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:44,593
Okay. it's a debt. When you
get a job, give it at that time

180
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,592
Move your hand. From there too.

181
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,592
You better give it, okay? ? Yes.

182
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:49,591
Because a man can't
die taking my money..

183
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:52,590
..then dying is
another matter altogether.

184
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,591
When is your interview?
? Tomorrow.

185
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,589
At what time? ? 10 O?clock.

186
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,589
Oh, I'll have to talk
on the hotline for this.

187
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,588
There will be
more expense for that.

188
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:01,588
Okay, l?ll call up the
office and do something.

189
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:09,585
The Talent Association?s
director is here. Drama start.

190
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:26,579
What are you looking
at sir? l?m a handicap.

191
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,578
That?s all right. l?m busy now.
You meet me at 3 O clock.

192
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,578
Please don?t do like this sir.
God has broken my limbs.

193
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,576
Please, you
don?t break my heart.

194
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:39,575
l?m the chairman of All
India Handicapped Association.

195
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,575
We?re holding a
program on the 16th.

196
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:43,574
if you help us in that,
then all the handicapped..

197
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:46,572
..people will be indebted
to you. l touch your feet.

198
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,572
Okay. l?ll do that.
We?ll surely help you.

199
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:52,571
Give us a written application.
We?ll do your work, okay.

200
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:58,569
Sir, sir, sir. My work
will be done, isn't it?

201
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,569
Didn't l tell you
that it?ll be done?

202
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,568
Hundred and one percent? ?
l?ll do your work first now.

203
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,566
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!

204
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,564
Did you listen? Our
work will be done first.

205
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:16,563
That's why last night
I had called the president in Delhi.

206
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:18,563
l told him, that sir, this
work should certainly be done

207
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:20,562
He said, Sampat, how
can your work not be done?

208
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,560
Okay, but, what
questions will they ask inside?

209
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Hey, why do you
worry about questions?

210
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,559
Let them ask anything,
you just wink.

211
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
They?ll understand
that you are my man.

212
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,556
Okay, so you are Raghuveer?
? Yes. -will you dance?

213
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:37,537
Have you brought your
certificates with you?

214
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:44,535
Yes
- Okay, perform for us then.

215
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,530
Hey, sir has told you to
perform and you?re winking?

216
00:18:57,531 --> 00:19:01,529
No, this is my habit.

217
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,527
Hey, you?re lost again?

218
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:14,525
Yes? No. l?m not lost. l
was remembering my teacher.

219
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,524
Why? To reduce your tension?

220
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:29,501
That fatso winked at you?

221
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,500
She?s a big wretch. She
chases around for me too.

222
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,499
l was the one who fixed up her
job in that office. ? ls it so?

223
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,499
Whoever works there, l
have fixed their jobs there.

224
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:39,497
That office
works on my strength.

225
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,497
Okay. Those people, how did
those people like your dance?

226
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,496
They liked it immensely.

227
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:46,495
How would they not like it?
You are such a good dancer.

228
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,495
Even if you
dance in a cemetery..

229
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,493
..the dead will come
out and start dancing.

230
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:55,492
Brother, l?m a Paras. if l
touch a stone, it will turn into gold.

231
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,491
if l touch a crow,
it becomes a cuckoo.

232
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,490
if l touch the Amavas,
it'll become a full moon.

233
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,490
See, there it?s become now.

234
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,490
What you are
saying is right, sir.

235
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,489
it is because of you,
that my work has been done.

236
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:07,488
Please, do one more mercy on me.

237
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:11,487
Yes, tell me. have a
printing press of mercies.

238
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,486
l print mercies and distribute
them among st the public.

239
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,486
Tell me, what is to be done?

240
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,485
Please arrange a
house for me, please.

241
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,485
An apartment? ? Yes? ?
And that too in Bombay?

242
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,484
Yes, why not? ? What
are you talking about?

243
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:21,484
You don?t get a
taxi on rent in Bombay..

244
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:23,483
..where will you
get a house from?

245
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,482
Here, many people take out
a railway pass and stay there.

246
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:29,481
The train move and they
sleep standing, do you know?

247
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:34,480
Yes,have an idea. Why
don't you stay in my house?

248
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,479
No. What are you saying,
sir? What you are and where l am?

249
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,478
That?s all right. But l have
a very big heart. Come with me.

250
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:44,477
No. First of all,
you have a family.

251
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,476
And then, you have a wife too.
That?s a big problem.

252
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:48,475
Am l telling you
to stay with my wife?

253
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,474
l mean to say, come with me,
stay in my house. have a wife!

254
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:56,472
it's not that. Actually,
l?m a celibate. l?m a bachelor.

255
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:59,471
Staying with a family..
? You don?t have a..

256
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,471
..single penny in your pockets,
but you act like a billionaire.

257
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,470
This is where India is
defeated. Come, let?s try.

258
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,468
Sir, your parcel. ? Yes. Give
it. You.. ? Here is your bill.

259
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:12,467
Want a house on rent, isn't it?

260
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,467
Then pay this bill, l
don?t have any money.

261
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,465
Oh, only that much, Mr. Sampat?

262
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,465
For you, not only the bill,
but even my heart is present!

263
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:21,465
Thank you. ? You stupid rogue!

264
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:27,462
Will this apartment do?

265
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,462
Why are you shaking your head?

266
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:30,461
The queen of
England had come here..

267
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,461
..with my recommendation,
do you know that? ? ls it so?

268
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:34,460
it is an excellent house,
even the people are excellent.

269
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,459
it is all the price of my
ideas. ? That?s excellent sir.

270
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,459
Have you brought that money?
- Yes.have brought it.

271
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,459
How much money have you brought?

272
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,458
it is near about
something 3000 rupees.

273
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,456
Three thousand? You came to
Bombay with three thousand?

274
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,456
You don't get three hizaars
in three thousand.

275
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:48,456
And you have come to
buy a house and settle down?

276
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:49,455
Okay, give it
to me. ? But that..

277
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,455
Yes, if you keep it
with me, it will be safe.

278
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,454
Come, follow me. ? This means..

279
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:56,453
See how l?m welcomed here.
? This means my work is done.

280
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:01,452
Yes, what is it?

281
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:03,451
Call your mother.

282
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:04,450
She?s not here.

283
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,450
That?s strange. ls
your father at home?

284
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,450
He?s not at home too.

285
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,449
He?s a strange donkey,
stupid, good for nothing man.

286
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:11,449
He gives a time and
does not stay at home.

287
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,448
Let him come home. l?ll
give him two tight slaps.

288
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,447
Don?t you feel ashamed?
What rubbish are you speaking?

289
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:17,446
it?s been three years
that my parents have expired.

290
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:21,445
Hey, Sampat!

291
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,443
Hey, Sampat? Till yesterday,
you called me, Sir, Mr., etc..

292
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,442
And today you
regard me as Hey Sampat?

293
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,442
Has the air of betrayal
of Bombay bitten you too?

294
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:35,441
have not been bitten by any
air; your air has been punctured.

295
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,440
You announced with
drum rolls that you would..

296
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,440
..arrange a house
for me in a snap.

297
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,439
You weren't even made
to wait at the door..

298
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,439
..and he says that the
household people know him.

299
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:43,438
l?ll show you just
now that they know me.

300
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,437
How will they not recognize me?

301
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,437
l?m the one who
arranged this house for them.

302
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,436
What can l do if
they have expired?

303
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:49,436
But how can they
expire just like that?

304
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,435
At least they should
have informed me and died.

305
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:52,435
l think that it must have slipped
out of their minds. ? What?

306
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:53,434
Come, let us see another flat.

307
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,432
Hey, Ravi, Ravi.

308
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:02,432
Mr. Sampat, did you get a house?

309
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,431
No, Actually, my
petrol pump has come.

310
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,430
The petrol of
ideas is exhausted in..

311
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,430
..the tank of my brains.
l?ll have a quarter and come.

312
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,429
Why don?t you say that the
den has come? Do you drink?

313
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,428
No. l just fill up,
to charge this up.

314
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:14,427
l?ll go and come quickly.

315
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:19,426
it's okay, come back soon. ?
l?ll be back. ? Don?t go, okay?

316
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:22,425
O God, with which
conman have you trapped me?

317
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:27,423
He lies, he drinks, he
brags and he makes me wait!

318
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:32,422
Please save me, please.
Hey. Where has he gone?

319
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:36,421
The flat is rather huge.
? it?s very good.

320
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,420
The construction as well as
the decoration is very good.

321
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,419
You've not let even a
single foot of space go waste.

322
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:42,419
Hey, what are you doing?

323
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:44,418
Have you seen the place?

324
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:45,418
Yes, We've seen the place,
it is rather good.

325
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,417
Madam, advance, advance,

326
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,416
What will be the advance
that will have to be given?

327
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,416
Something like, a month?s
advance will have to be given.

328
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:56,414
One month, one month.
And what will be the rent?

329
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,414
it?s just two hundred rupees.

330
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,413
Only two hundred rupees? it?s
such a lowly amount. Give it.

331
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:01,412
You have the money. ?
Do you remember that?

332
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:02,412
Give it to me.

333
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:06,411
Here is your advance.

334
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:09,410
Of the flat.
Don?t speak in between.

335
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,409
Will you two stay together?

Yes. No, no. No.
l?ll be staying alone.

337
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:18,408
And like the sun in the sky,
l?ll be coming during the day..

338
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:21,406
,,and going during the night.
isn't it? ? Yes.

339
00:25:21,406 --> 00:25:26,405
Okay, one thing more.
Are you married?

340
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:29,404
Yes. l?m married.
l?m already married.

341
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:30,403
Right now, she is
at her mother?s house.

342
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,402
She?s in her mother?s house.

343
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:35,402
Take this money, and
please go away from here. - Yes?

344
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:38,401
l don?t keep married
people as a tenant. ? What?

345
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:41,399
Yes, l keep only
bachelors as tenants.

346
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,399
You can go. ? But that.. ? No,
you have misunderstood it.

347
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:48,398
He?s unmarried,
it?s me who?s married.

348
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,396
He?s not born properly as yet,
where will he be married?

349
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:53,396
OK. ? Actually, l
used the razor wrongly..

350
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,395
..and therefore
his beard is evident.

351
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:57,394
it?s not even time for his
mustaches to come out yet.

352
00:25:57,394 --> 00:25:59,394
He?s a kid yet. ?
l?m a celibate as yet.

353
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,393
Then please give me the advance.

354
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,393
Then his work is done,
isn't it? ? Yes.

355
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,392
You won't remove
him now, will you?

356
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:05,392
Come now, l fixed you up here.

357
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:07,391
l want a quarter, The effect
of the alcohol is lessening.

358
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:10,390
Shut up. So, l?ll come in
the afternoon with the luggage.

359
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:19,388
Darling, you've got
the house, isn't it?

360
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:25,386
Eh What happened?

361
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,382
Sampat, where
have you trapped me?

362
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:37,381
She?s staring at me
with such bulging eyes!

363
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,377
Here, please drink it.

364
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,377
l don?t have the
habit of drinking milk.

365
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:56,375
You don?t have the habit?
l?ll put you in the habit.

366
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,374
How will you put
it just like that?

367
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:05,373
l won't let you put it
at all. l don?t like milk.

368
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,371
ls it so? So then,
do you like me?

369
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:12,370
See, please don?t
inflict this injustice on me.

370
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,368
l?m not inflicting
any injustice, my king!

371
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:21,367
Then, what are you doing?
? l?m making love!

372
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:26,366
See, l had told you even
before giving you the advance.

373
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:29,365
That l?m a celibate man.

374
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,363
I have become many
celibate men into family men.

375
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:38,361
At least try it once
and see. ? Hey, move it.

376
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:41,360
Hey, what are you doing?
Do you have any..

377
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,359
..brother or father or not?
O Goddess, live come here..

378
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,358
..to become a singer, not
for unlocking my dignity.

379
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:52,358
Just unlock it once and
see. - O God.- You?ll not want..

380
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:55,356
..to attach any locks
throughout your whole life.

381
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:59,355
That?s bad. You
are talking nakedly.

382
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:04,353
if you can't clothe yourself,
at least clothe your words.

383
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:08,352
This is not the time
to wear clothes, Raja.

384
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:14,350
See, l?m a kid yet. Giving
bad toys in my childhood?s hands..

385
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,349
..please don?t
make my childhood bad.

386
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:21,348
A singer?s
throat should always..

387
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:24,347
.. be clean,
clear, pure and virgin.

388
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,346
immersing my throat
in the vat of sin..

389
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:28,345
..please, please don?t
ruin my throat.

390
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:31,344
Please, let me go.
Please let me go.

391
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:34,343
No, today, l?ll
break your celibacy vows.

392
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:37,343
No, please let me go. What you
are doing. Please let me go.

393
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:43,341
O Run Ravi!O hail Bajranga!
Why did l come here!

394
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,339
Where are you going? ? Run,
run. Leave the bag.

395
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,338
Leave the bag. ?
Hey you celibate!

396
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,337
Hey, you Sampat!

397
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:56,337
Oh! Who is it?

398
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:02,335
Hey, Ravi, what is
this state of yours?

399
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:04,334
Have you come after
performing cabaret?

400
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:06,333
if l had not run
away from the today..

401
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,332
..then my dignity would
have performed a cabaret.

402
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:11,331
And Sampat, what did you say?

403
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:14,330
That woman is not a woman.
She is a Goddess incarnate.

404
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,330
She is a form of
the Goddess Mahalaxmi.

405
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,329
Look at her face while
leaving the house in the morning..

406
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,329
..and all the work of
the day will be successful.

407
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:22,328
l had told you
everything correctly, friend!

408
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:23,328
What ashes had you said correct?

409
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,326
That woman is rouge.
She tried to rape me.

410
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,325
She tried to rape you? ? Yes.
Then you should have let her.

411
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:34,324
What? ? Yes. You should've
closed your eyes and lay.

412
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:36,324
You should have let her,
what would your father have lost?

413
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,323
Do you have any shame or not?

414
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:42,321
l?m a celibate, and you
want to ruin my bachelorhood?

415
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:45,320
Where your
bachelorhood would be ruined?

416
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
God knows from which
college you've got your degree.

417
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
if you put your hand
on someone?s dignity..

418
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,318
..then your
bachelorhood is ruined.

419
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:55,317
Because it was your mistake.
But if a person tries himself..

420
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,317
..then how does your
bachelorhood be ruined?

421
00:29:58,316 --> 00:29:59,316
What kind of a person are you?

422
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:01,315
if l would be in your place,
l would have..

423
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:03,315
..closed my eyes and
folded my hands behind and lay.

424
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:07,313
And l would say, O God,
see how these people..

425
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:09,313
..of the world are looting
the dignity of a honest man.

426
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:11,312
The wretchedness
would be done and the..

427
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:13,312
.. honesty would have
been untouched too, you know.

428
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:20,309
Sister-in-law, yes hit him,
yes hit with this.

429
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,308
You keep quiet.
Why are you hitting me?

430
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:23,309
What were you saying, yes?

431
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:27,307
You teach an honest boy,
all these bad and vulgar things.

432
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:30,306
At least let someone
stay honest in this world.

433
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,306
At least throw away the broom.

434
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:32,305
You keep on
hitting me with the broom.

435
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,305
You had hit me with the
broom in the afternoon too.

436
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:37,304
A husband is God. ls
a God hit with a broom?

437
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,304
God? You are the devil himself.

438
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:43,302
Hey Ravi, l?ll tell you
one thing. This man, who..

439
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:46,301
..unfortunately is my husband,
isn't all that straight.

440
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:50,300
Collecting the
mud of 17,000 devils..

441
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,299
..God has made this statue. l
tell you, leave his friendship.

442
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,298
Otherwise, whatever
respect you have left..

443
00:30:55,298 --> 00:30:57,297
..even that will be
auctioned in the market. Be ware.

444
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:01,296
Hey, Ravi, Here,
there?s a letter for you.

445
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,290
Hey, l got the job.

446
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,289
The All India Talent
Association has selected me.

447
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,289
See, did you hear that?
You say that l?m a rogue.

448
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,288
And on this
rogue?s recommendation..

449
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:29,286
..he has got this job.
There?s no worth for me at all.

450
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:32,286
No, Mr. Sampat, you
are a very big man.

451
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:36,285
l swear, you are
really a very great man.

452
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,284
l?m a big man.
But people say that..

453
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:41,283
..behind the
greatness of every man..

454
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:43,283
..there?s the
hand of some woman.

455
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,281
But the woman?s
hand that is behind me..

456
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:49,280
..that hand wields a broom.
Speak slowly, or else she?ll hit.

457
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,279
Ravi, you doused water on
my lifetime?s hard work..

458
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,278
..and were selected in the
All India Talent Association.

459
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:03,276
l?ll not spare you, too.
l?ll shatter all your hopes!

460
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:09,273
Hey, teacher, the money
I gave you, then delete them.

461
00:32:09,273 --> 00:32:10,274
The money is exhausted.

462
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:13,273
Exhausted? But what about
the advance that l gave you?

463
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:15,272
Didn't l tell you,
that it's exhausted?

464
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:17,271
That?s all right,
but why are you crying?

465
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,271
Today, for the
first time in my life..

466
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,269
..l stole from my house,
do you know that?

467
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:28,268
Stealing, do you steal?
- l was helpless.

468
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:32,266
Yesterday, l bet on a
horse race with your money.

469
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,265
Race, you race too?

470
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:37,265
What can l do? l?m helpless.
l felt very bad.

471
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:39,264
l thought that my
friend?s money is being wasted.

472
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:42,263
l felt very bad. ? O, is it so?
My friend?s money is going waste.

473
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:44,263
You remembered this
on the ninth horse.

474
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,262
You didn't remember this on
any other horse before that?

475
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,262
l didn't remember it.
Otherwise l wouldn't have played.

476
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:48,261
He?s acting smart.

477
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:52,260
See, that's why I stole
this tape recorder from the house.

478
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,258
See, l hid this from my
wife?s eyes and brought it.

479
00:32:56,258 --> 00:33:00,258
You?re a very big wretch.
You should have..

480
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,256
..you should have been born
in some other country, friend.

481
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:03,257
You shouldn't have taken
birth his country at all.

482
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,255
When l was being born, l
shouted and told my mother..

483
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:10,254
..from the womb, Mother,
don?t give birth to me in India.

484
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,253
l am a very high level thing.

485
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:15,252
if you need, give
birth to me in America.

486
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:18,251
Give birth to me in Germany,
give birth to me in France..

487
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:19,251
Or give birth to me in Europe.
She didn't listen at all.

488
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,250
She gave birth to me in
Bombay?s municipal hospital.

489
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,250
l even remember
that doctor?s face.

490
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,249
He was totally bald.
He was a baldy.

491
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:31,247
Sometimes you lick my
brains so much.. ? Hey, teacher..

492
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:35,246
What happened? ? He took
away the symbol of friendship!

493
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:08,197
Hey, Sampat, how
did you become so far?

494
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:11,196
Seeing you fight, my
chest puffed with happiness.

495
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:14,195
What?s the use of fighting?
The tape recorder is gone.

496
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,194
No. it?s not gone. it?s there.
? it?s there, where?

497
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:17,194
Bring your hand down.

498
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:24,192
Teacher, is this a
house or a woman?s committee?

499
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,191
You mind your own business,
let it go.

500
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:37,188
Greetings to all the ladies.
? Greetings, greetings.

501
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:40,186
Who is the
landlady out of all of you?

502
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:45,185
Can't you
recognize when you see?

503
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,184
ls it you?

504
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:50,182
Do l not seem the
mistress of this house?

505
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:54,182
What a dangerous
mood drips from you.

506
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:57,181
Therefore, double
greetings to you. ? Greetings.

507
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,179
Please sit. ? No, we

00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:05,178
Sit down,

00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:21,173
That?s not the case.

my brother?s daughter.

522
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:51,163
Yes. He is my son ? in ? law.
- That?s excellent.

523
00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:56,161
l give my rooms
only to married people.

524
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:59,160
Go, and see the
room with your own eyes.

525
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
if you like it, then
please give the advance.

526
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,159
Look at this bed room.
it?s exactly like King Akbar?s.

527
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,158
Son, praise God. in Bombay,
where people..

528
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:12,156
..don?t get standing place to
sleep, you got such a big flat.

529
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,156
All this is my
influence do you know that?

530
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:16,155
l accept that teacher.
But saying that..

531
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,155
..I'm married, you've
trapped me again, isn't it?

532
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:19,154
Who says that live trapped,
haven't you?

533
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:20,153
There are so many
girls sitting outside.

534
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:23,152
Make anyone of them your
wife and make them show her.

535
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:26,152
What? ? No, you
don?t understand.

536
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:30,150
This life is like a five
year plan. One plan is finished..

537
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,150
..then put it?s on the other
plan. if the second is done put..

538
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,148
..it's burden on the third. Third
is done then put it on the fourth.

539
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:41,147
This is high level talk,
you won't understand it. Come.

540
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:49,144
Why are you
neighing like a horse?

541
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:52,143
Well, actually he has a
habit of neighing like a horse.

542
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,143
Okay, did you
like the apartment?

543
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:57,141
Yes, it is exactly like a
stable. No. it?s a very good room.

544
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:58,142
Okay, calculating Rs.1000
as the monthly rent..

545
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:00,140
..give me the
advance for three months.

546
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Yes, l?m giving it.
l?m giving it.

547
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,139
This, is that, three..

548
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:09,138
You gave everything. ls
money left for my quarter?

549
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,137
Keep quiet, keep quiet.

550
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:13,136
l?ll ruin everything.
? it?s left, it?s left.

551
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:16,135
Oh, yes. When will
you bring your wife?

552
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:22,134
Actually, actually..
? Mourning, mourning.

553
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:23,133
it?s the month of mourning.
As soon as it?s over.

554
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,133
..he?ll bring his wife here.
it?s a normal thing. ? What?

555
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:27,132
Just say yes to whatever l say.

556
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,131
He looks so nice, doesn't he?

557
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:33,130
Okay, seeing
some auspicious day..

558
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,129
..you people bring
your luggage too, okay?

559
00:39:57,122 --> 00:40:03,120
How is it prepared? Let
me see. O it?s hot! O my God!

560
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Hey, what?s all
this going on here?

561
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,118
Yes? That vessel was hot.
So it slipped from the hands.

562
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,117
Shut down this
music first. ? Yes!

563
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:17,115
Food is not cooked
while dancing like this.

564
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,115
Cooking food is a
woman?s job. Not a man?s job.

565
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:24,113
Listen, till the time
your wife comes back..

566
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:26,113
..l?ll prepare
food for you. ? Okay.

567
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:29,112
Oh yes, when will the
month of mourning be over?

568
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:31,112
Just, Just. ? What?s this
just you?re talking about?

569
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,110
it will be over in
just a few days now.

570
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,110
Okay, call your
wife back quickly okay?

571
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,109
Yes but.. ? What
live said, so live said.

572
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,106
What is this? There?s
only your photo in this frame.

573
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:48,106
Why isn't there a
photo of your wife in this?

574
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:52,105
Actually, l had only
a single photo?s frame.

575
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,103
The day l buy a
double photo frame..

576
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,103
..l?ll put her
photo in that too then.

577
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,103

photo?s frame with me.

578
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:01,102
You bring your wife?s photo,
l?ll put it in it. - Okay.

579
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:04,100
Give me the photo.
? Actually, Actually..

580
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,099
l have given the photo
for enlargement yesterday.

581
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,099
Okay, bring it in the
afternoon okay? ? Yes, sure, sure.

582
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,098
Okay, when do
you go for your job?

583
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,097
10 o?clock. ? in the day,
or in the night?

584
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,096
in the day. ? So
what is the time now?

585
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:21,095
Now, it?s 10:30 now.

586
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:24,094

reach by 10:00? - l?m going!

587
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:28,093
Mother, today is the first
day of my job. Please bless me.

588
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:30,092
Be happy. Hey listen.
Don?t forget..

589
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:33,091
..to bring the photo in the
afternoon. ? Yes, sure, sure.

590
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,090
it?s very difficult to
go home, friend. ? Why?

591
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,089
My luck is very bad.
That landlady..

592
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,088
..has told me to
bring a photo of my wife.

593
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:44,087
When there?s no wife, where
will l bring her photo from?

594
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,087
So why are you
so scared in this?

595
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,087
l?ll give you my wife?s photo,
you take that and go.

596
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,086
What? ? No, she?s too
elder to you, isn't it?

597
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:55,084
Therefore l told you, don't
lie, You trapped me now, isn't it?

598
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:57,083
Hey, l didn't
trap you or anything.

599
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:01,082
Why do you worry so much? l?ll
generate a wife for you. - What.

600
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:05,081
See, son, don?t worry, till
the time Sampat is there, come.

601
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Come, sir, please come,
what do you want?

602
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,078
A full or a half? ? No, l want
a quarter, with soda and ice.

603
00:42:13,078 --> 00:42:17,077
Hey, this is a photographer?s
shop, not a wine shop.

604
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,076
Hey, it seems a wine
shop to me. ? Shut up!

605
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:24,074
A few days ago, l had
taken a photograph here.

606
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:28,074
if you have it?s negative,
then l want it enlarged.

607
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:31,072
Okay, was it your photo? ? No,
it was his wife?s photo.

608
00:42:32,072 --> 00:42:33,072
Okay, had you
snapped it together?

609
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,071
No, She has snapped her alone.

610
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:38,071
Okay, can you
describe her face to me?

611
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:40,069
Look at his face. His
wife?s face is similar to him.

612
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:42,069
See, l can't
understand anything like this.

613
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:45,068
live an idea. Please
go through this album.

614
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:48,067
Take out whichever photo
it is. l will enlarge it.

615
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,066
Hey, it?s perfect.

616
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:56,064
Yes, brother, this is his wife?s
photo. ? Yes, this is the one.

617
00:42:57,064 --> 00:42:59,064
What rubbish are
you speaking about?

618
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:01,062
This is my wife?s photo!

619
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:04,061
You misunderstood.
This is not the finger.

620
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:06,061
it?s this thumb,
- Okay, okay. Near this thumb.

621
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:10,060
Yes, this thumb is there. ?
it?ll be twenty five rupees.

622
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,059
How much?

623
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,059
Give it.

624
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,056
What a nice couple!

625
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:26,055
if God meets the couple,
then it's one out of thousands.

626
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:45,049
Hey my heart, come
lets go some where else.

627
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:52,047
Ravi, before she throws you
out of the house, fly away.

628
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:57,044
Ravi? ? Yes, yes, mother?

629
00:43:58,044 --> 00:44:00,044
This is your wife, isn't it?

630
00:44:01,043 --> 00:44:04,042
Yes, this is my wife.

631
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,042
You have an excellent choice,

632
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:11,040
When l was of her age,
l looked exactly like her.

633
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,039
She?s very beautiful.

634
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,037
That?s strange. l?m going
on complimenting your wife.

635
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:22,037
And you?re not
answering me at all.

636
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:25,036
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
When are you bringing her?

637
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,034
Mother, should l
tell you something?

638
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,034
Tell me, what is the matter?

639
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,032
This is not my wife.

640
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:39,031
What, this is not your wife?
That means you tricked me?

641
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:41,030
You lied and took
this room on rent?

642
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,030
l?ll call the police right now.

643
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,029
No, no. l didn't say like that.
l didn't mean that.

644
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:49,028
l said, that this is not
my wife, she is my enemy.

645
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:51,027
Enemy? ? Yes, please come
here and sit. l?ll tell you.

646
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:53,027
There is too much
of a trouble here.

647
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:56,026
Yes. Sit here comfortably,
l?ll tell you.

648
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,024
As soon as you
gave me this room..

649
00:44:58,024 --> 00:45:00,024
..l immediately
wrote a letter to my wife.

650
00:45:00,024 --> 00:45:02,024
And l wrote to
her in that letter..

651
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:07,022
..that live got an excellent,
beautiful and good room.

652
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:09,022
And even better than the room..

653
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:13,020
..live got a landlady who's
like a mother, Goddess incarnate.

654
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,019
l feel like pressing
her legs. ? That?s enough.

655
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,019
Yes, really. l did
tell her. l told her..

656
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:19,018
..to treat my letter as
a telegram and rush here.

657
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:20,018
Do you know what she answered?

658
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:22,017
What did she say?

659
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:24,016
She told me to leave this
room as soon as possible.

660
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,016
She told me that she
has heard about you..

661
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,015
..this room?s landlady,
that she?s..

662
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,014
.. a fighter-cock,
and a meddlesome woman.

663
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:32,014
She meddles in
every one?s matter.

664
00:45:32,014 --> 00:45:34,013
She said so many wrong
things about you, you know?

665
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:37,012
What? - Yes. ? Did she
say like this about me? ? Yes.

666
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:39,012
And l got angry, because
anger resides on my nose.

667
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:41,011
And in this anger, l
wrote another letter to her.

668
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:43,010
And in that l told her
very clearly, that if..

669
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,009
..you don?t like my
Goddess like and mother like..

670
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:50,008
..landlady, then even l
have no need of such a wife.

671
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:53,007
l?ll live my whole life,
alone in this room.

672
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:54,007
Didn't l say what
was right, mother?

673
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:57,006
No, please tell me. No, you
hit me with slippers, but tell me.

674
00:45:57,006 --> 00:45:59,005
Yes, yes, you
said the right thing.

675
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:02,005
Very good. l?m saved. ? Listen,
give me her address.

676
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:05,003
l?ll bring here by the
ear and straighten her up.

677
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:06,003
How will she come
here just like that?

678
00:46:07,002 --> 00:46:09,002
What live said, that l've said.

679
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:12,001
Hey, even though she
has insulted you so much..

680
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,000
l'll straighten her, isn't it?

681
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:18,999
l?m trapped, l thought that
the story would be done with.

682
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,998
And here, she?s thinking
of bringing here herself.

683
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:22,997
What did you say?

684
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:24,996
No, where did l say anything?
What l was saying was..

685
00:46:24,996 --> 00:46:26,996
..that is this month
of mourning, isn't it?

686
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:28,996
So, as soon as
this month passes..

687
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,994
..l?ll bring her myself
and offer her at your feet.

688
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:33,994
l think this is all
the thing of the stars.

689
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:36,993
l've an idea. it's
grahan day after tomorrow. - Yes.

690
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,992
You beg alms from five houses.

691
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,991
Everything will be all right.

692
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:43,990
l?m dead. l?m dead.

693
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,989
Give me alms,
drive away the eclipse!

694
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:51,987
Where do these hermits
come in the early mornings?

695
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:54,987
Why doesn't the police
arrest them and take them away?

696
00:46:54,987 --> 00:46:58,986
Here, go, and don't shout.
l've a head ache.

697
00:46:58,986 --> 00:46:59,985
l haven?t had my hang over her.

698
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:02,985
Hey, give me alms and
drive away the eclipse!

699
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:05,984
Hey, go away, don?t
stick your eclipse to us, go!

700
00:47:05,984 --> 00:47:06,983
Sampat!

701
00:47:07,982 --> 00:47:10,982
Hey, how did these
hermits come to know of my name?

702
00:47:10,982 --> 00:47:13,981
l?m very famous.
Everyone must be knowing my name.

703
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,979
Who is it brother?
- Hey, Sampu, Sampu?

704
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:19,979
He?s dropping the
level and speaking.

705
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:21,978
Who is it?

706
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:23,977
Ravi.

707
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,976
Have you started to
beg in the part time?

708
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:34,974
Sampat, everyone who
accepts you as his teacher..

709
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:36,973
..he will start
begging for alms!

710
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:39,972
What do you mean?

711
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:43,971
l mean that, you lied, and
l?m the one who?s reaping it.

712
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:47,969
You, Sampat thief! ?
Tell me what it is properly.

713
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,969
Why are you just
beating around the bush?

714
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:50,969
What should l tell you?

715
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,968
That day, while taking
the house from the land lady..

716
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:55,967
..you had lied to her, that my
wife is your brother?s daughter,

717
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:58,967
Now she goes to go
and bring the wife.

718
00:47:58,967 --> 00:47:59,966
From where should l bring her?

719
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,965
l've an idea now.
Bring that girl from..

720
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,965
..any where and
present her as my wife to her.

721
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,964
l should bring a girl for you?

722
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:07,963
Do l look like a pimp to you?
? if you don?t act like..

723
00:48:08,963 --> 00:48:10,962
..a pimp, then l?ll
be slaughtering you.

724
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:11,962
Give me some idea immediately!

725
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:14,961
Yes l?ll give you an idea. Let
me think about it a little bit.

726
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,959
Yes, l got it. ? Yes?
? it?s such an idea..

727
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:23,958
..l feel like kissing
my cheeks with my own lips.

728
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,958
That?s enough. Tell me further.

729
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,956
Yes, it?s an excellent idea.
You go and tell the Landlady..

730
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:31,955
..that ëLandlady,
my wife has expired.?

731
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:39,953
All these are old,
childhood ideas.

732
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:41,952
When l used to
bunk school, then l..

733
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:42,952
..would go the next
day and give these..

734
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:44,951
..ideas as
excuses to the teacher. -fine.

735
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:47,950
Before the death of my father,
l'd killed him twenty times.

736
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:57,947
Hearing about the
death of the wife..

737
00:48:58,946 --> 00:49:00,946
..the landlady will be quiet,
and it will be this..

738
00:49:01,945 --> 00:49:03,945
..troublesome
matter?s the end for ever!

739
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:13,942
Give me alms, let the
eclipse be driven away.

740
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:15,942
May you remain happy, forever!

741
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:19,940
You? Since when did
you start this business?

742
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,939
No. l gave this idea to someone.

743
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,938
And he gave me
this sack as fees..

744
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:25,938
if you continue giving
your rotten ideas to people..

745
00:49:26,938 --> 00:49:27,937
..this will be
your state. One day..

746
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:29,937
..you?ll be hanging
this sack by your neck..

747
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:31,936
..and begging for
alms at every road.

748
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,935
So what? That?s the
state of the whole country.

749
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:36,935
The whole country is
moving around with sack.

750
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:37,934
First they used to tell,
do something good..

751
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:39,934
..and drown it in the river,
now they tell..

752
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:41,932
..to give an idea and
take care of the bundle.

753
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:55,928
Who is it? l?ll be right back.

754
00:49:56,928 --> 00:50:01,926
l?m very happy. What happened?

755
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:05,925
Don't know why!?
Why is my heart beating so?

756
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:07,924
Who has come, on
the roads of love?

757
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:09,924
Why is my heart
beating so, today?

758
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:37,915
Hey, hey!

759
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:47,911
This seems like a ghost.

760
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,911
What is this?
Does a husband bless..

761
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:51,910
..his wife with a single finger?

762
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,909
Hey, this ghost speaks too!

763
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:57,908
Who are you?

764
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:58,907
You stayed away from me for a..

765
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,907
.. few days and you
even forgot my face? ? Face?

766
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:03,906
Does a husband speak like
this to his wife? ? Husband, wife?

767
00:51:04,906 --> 00:51:07,905
Just to listen to hear
two words love from you..

768
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,904
..l came here secretly,
without telling anyone anything.

769
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,903
Just like Rekha had
come to Amitabh for his love.

770
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:16,902
Amitabh, Rekha! ? Now,
l've come to you.

771
00:51:16,902 --> 00:51:21,900
All the distances are covered.
Now it?s just you, and me.

772
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,899
Me, and you. There is
no third person between us.

773
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:28,898
Now, the both of us
will roam around together.

774
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:32,897
We?ll talk about love, it?ll be
great fun, and it?ll be great fun!

775
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,896
But first, let me
have a look at my house.

776
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:40,894
Wow, We've got such a huge
house. it's such a huge hall.

777
00:51:40,894 --> 00:51:44,893
it?s so airy. There is
no need of any fan here.

778
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:47,892
You have made my
photo and kept too? -but madam..

779
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:50,891
From this, one comes to
know how much you love me.

780
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:52,890
if anyone
should have a husband..

781
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,889
..he should exactly be
like you. You look so sweet.

782
00:51:56,889 --> 00:52:00,888
But, but please
listen to me, Miss.

783
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:03,887
Not a miss, but kiss.

784
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:07,886
The whole
program has been ruined.

785
00:52:07,886 --> 00:52:08,885
Sampat, where have
you trapped me now?

786
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:10,885
l've come from so far,
and you haven't..

787
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:13,884
..even asked me whether
l?ll have tea or coffee.

788
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:16,883
You don?t even know how
to look after your wife.

789
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,882
it's doesn't matter.
l'll prepare it myself.

790
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,880
O, l had just
brought the girl?s photo.

791
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,880
O God! You sent me a
real and live girl.

792
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,879
O Ma?am, what are you
doing in the kitchen?

793
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:34,877
You have already
prepared all the food and kept.

794
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:36,876
How did you
know that l?m coming?

795
00:52:37,876 --> 00:52:42,874
Oh yes, your heart must
have told you. isn't it?

796
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:48,872
Do you know whose house
this is? ? No, l don?t.

797
00:52:48,872 --> 00:52:50,872
Then, are you swatting
flies here. Get lost from here.

798
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:53,871
Wow, what excellent
food has been cooked!

799
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,870
See, now l?m getting angry now.

800
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,869
l?m getting angry now.
You get lost from here..

801
00:52:57,869 --> 00:52:59,869
..or else l will
throw you out from here.

802
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:02,867
Wow, l?m enjoying it so much.

803
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:04,867
in one film,
Kamal Hassan had held..

804
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:06,867
..Sridevi's hand
exactly like this.

805
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,866
See, see. l?m
telling you the last time.

806
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:11,865
You go away from here silently..

807
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,864
..or else, l?ll hold
your pig tail, and drag you..

808
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:16,864
..and throw you out on
the road in the dust bin, yes.

809
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:19,862
Hey, you?re
scolding me like a villain.

810
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,861
Why will l go out from here?
This is my house.

811
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:23,861
No, this is not your house.
it?s your father?s house. Get lost.

812
00:53:23,861 --> 00:53:27,860
it?s my husband?s house. ?
Get lost from here. Get lost..

813
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:33,858
What has happened to your neck?

814
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:35,857
ls it a rash due to the heat?

815
00:53:35,857 --> 00:53:38,856
Ravi? You were saying
that she won't be coming?

816
00:53:38,856 --> 00:53:40,856
She has come. ? Yes,
she has come.

817
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:43,855
Hey, the land lady that you
had written about in the letter..

818
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:44,854
..she?s the one,
isn't it? ? Yes?

819
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:46,854
Yes, yes. l?m the one.

820
00:53:46,854 --> 00:53:49,852
Mother! Please bless me.

821
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:54,851
May God bless your marriage!
May he fill your womb quickly!

822
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:58,849
See, mother, since l've
come here, he's scolding me.

823
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:01,848
Why, Ravi, why
are you scolding her?

824
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:06,847
l?ll tell you. Listen to me
first. She?s a very troublesome..

825
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,846
Mother, listen to me first.
The both of us had decided..

826
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:10,846
..that when we will
have our own house..

827
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:12,845
..then we?ll
celebrate our honeymoon there.

828
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:15,844
He went and told my
father that he can't keep..

829
00:54:15,844 --> 00:54:18,843
..me with him for six months.
Because he doesn't have time.

830
00:54:18,843 --> 00:54:20,843
When l couldn't
stand it any longer..

831
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:22,841
..l took the permission if
my father and came here myself.

832
00:54:22,841 --> 00:54:25,841
Now, you tell me, What wrong
did l do? What is my fault?

833
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:28,840
Mother, she?s lying.
You don?t know who she is.

834
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,839
l?ll tell you.. ?
l know everything.

835
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,838
She?s your wife, what else?

836
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:35,837
And how can the car of
life work without a wife?

837
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:37,837
That?s perfectly right.
The husband and wife..

838
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:39,836
..are the two
wheels of the car of life.

839
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:43,835
if one wheel doesn't exist, then
the car of life can never work.

840
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:45,834
Anyway, l?ll explain all
these things to you later.

841
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,833
You've from a long journey.
You wash up and rest, okay?

842
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,832
l?ll meet you later again. See,
don?t trouble her again, okay?

843
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:55,831
You forgot the matter of the
letter. ? What l've said.

844
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:03,829
Oh God, where
have l been trapped!

845
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:09,826
Listen, where is the bath room?
- There.

846
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,826
Bathroom? You want a bathroom?

847
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:13,826
At the crossroads,
there is a barber?s shop.

848
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:16,824
Next to it is a public bath.
You get water in one rupee.

849
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:18,824
Go, and have a bath there.
Go, go there.

850
00:55:18,824 --> 00:55:20,823
Why should l go there?
This house is mine.

851
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:22,822
The bathroom and water
of this house is mine too.

852
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:23,822
He?s come to send me there.

853
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:25,821
Hey, where are you going there,
get lost from here.

854
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,820
l?m going to the bathroom,
to have a bath.

855
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,820
And listen, by the time
l come back from my bath..

856
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,819
..put some more salt in
the food and keep it ready.

857
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:35,818
You have made it
completely plain.

858
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:38,817
You! You daughter of an owl!

859
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:41,816
O God! What is this problem?
Why did..

860
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:42,816
..such a Phoolan
Devi had come to my house?

861
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:44,815
Please take her
away from here, please.

862
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:47,814
Hey, what are you doing outside?

863
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:50,814
l?m crying over
my fate, come out.

864
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,813
Cry over your fate later,
first do one thing.

865
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:55,811
in my bag, there is
a red colored sari..

866
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,811
..and it?s matching blouse.
Please give it to me.

867
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:00,810
You wretch, am l your servant?

868
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,809
Am l your slave? Come out,
or else l?ll drink your blood.

869
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:05,808
Yes. it?s a blood
red colored sari.

870
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:08,807
When you had come to
see me for the first time..

871
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:10,807
..l'd worn that sari.
Please give it to me.

872
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:12,806
Are you coming
your silently or not?

873
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,806
My blood is boiling
because of my anger.

874
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,804
You come out, or else l?ll throw
you naked out in the streets.

875
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:22,803
What did you say? You?ll
throw me naked in the streets?

876
00:56:22,803 --> 00:56:24,802
Don?t you feel ashamed
speaking to your wife..

877
00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:26,801
..in such a way. Come, throw
me out, l?ll see. Throw me out.

878
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,801
Where did l say
that you are naked?

879
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,801
Where did l say that?
But l?ll throw you out.

880
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:31,800
Will you go or not? You
won't accept it like this.

881
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,799
l?ll show you, l?ll
show you right now.

882
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,799
l?ll take your
luggage and throw it away.

883
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:37,798
What do you think you are?
? Hey, what are you doing?

884
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:39,797
l?ll throw out your luggage..

885
00:56:44,796 --> 00:56:47,795
What is the matter?
Where are going with this bag?

886
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:54,793
Going, who?s going? l was
weight lifting, exercising.

887
00:56:54,793 --> 00:56:56,791
Yes. The husband
who lives away from..

888
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,791
..his wife for a month
goes through this same state.

889
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:01,790
ls it so? - Now, a small
toy should come in this house.

890
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,789
it's been quite a
while that we've heard..

891
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:05,789
..the voices of lullabies
in this house. - Correct.

892
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,788
Please do one thing.
That old antique manger..

893
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:11,787
..bring one and
keep it in our house.

894
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:13,786
All of us will
sing lullabies then.

895
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:15,786
Ravi, on Monday, it?s
our marriage anniversary.

896
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:17,785
The both of you
should surely come.

897
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:19,784
Why not, why not? if some
trouble doesn't rear it?'s head..

898
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:21,784
..and if l?m alive
till then l?ll surely come.

899
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,782
May God not send
any problems to us!

900
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:33,779
We?ll live together
and we?ll die together.

901
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:40,778
Wow. You both are an
example for this world.

902
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:42,777
We are not an example,
we are incomparable.

903
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:46,775
Please forget this example; l'll
go to the office. l've to work.

904
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:48,775
it?s ten O?clock.
l?ll leave now.

905
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:52,774
He?s very mischievous, isn't he?

906
00:57:52,774 --> 00:57:56,772
Come, sisters. Both
of them are the same.

907
00:57:57,772 --> 00:57:58,772
They keep on
fighting all the time.

908
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,769
Wretch.

909
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:10,768
Listen, my friends like
your color, hairstyle..

910
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:13,766
..and your personality too much.

911
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:17,766
ls it so? Now with you,
even your friends have seen me?

912
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:19,765
Ask them that all
they like is my color..

913
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:22,764
..my hairstyle and my
personality, isn't it?

914
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:23,763
They don?t like
anything else, do they?

915
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:27,763
Yes, and they say that
your husband is pure gold.

916
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:30,761
Yes, why not? Go and
mortgage me with them.

917
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:31,761
You?ll get some
money or something.

918
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,760
O Go away! Will l mortgage you?

919
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,758
You are the valuable of my
life. You?re the pride of my eyes.

920
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:45,757
You?re the peace of my heart.
You?re a pure diamond.

921
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,755
Okay! Now l understand
why you are chasing me.

922
00:58:49,755 --> 00:58:52,754
You think, that l'm some
billionaire?s son, isn't it?

923
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:55,753
What do you think that
you?ll loot money from me?

924
00:58:55,753 --> 00:59:00,751
But listen, l?m not a
billionaire?s son. l?m a pauper.

925
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:05,750
And also, also, l don?t
even have a place to stay.

926
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,750
l, myself am
staying in a rented house.

927
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,749
See, l?m just a
common singer and dancer.

928
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:12,748
For, God?s sake,
quit chasing me around.

929
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:15,747
Whatever you are, what
is my business with that?

930
00:59:15,747 --> 00:59:20,745
l just know that you?re my
husband, and me, your wife.

931
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:24,744
See, listen to me, or
else you?ll repent later.

932
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,743
Why should l repent?
What is my fault?

933
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:28,743
Since the time l've come
here you've been threatening me.

934
00:59:28,743 --> 00:59:30,742
As if l?m not your wife,
but someone else.

935
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:31,742
if l?m not your wife,
then why have..

936
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:33,741
..you attached my
photo with yours?

937
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,740
Oh, so if l attach our photos,
you become my wife?

938
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,740
in this house, l've put
the photos of fifty heroines.

939
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,738
Fifty heroines. That doesn't
mean that they are my wives.

940
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:43,737
They can never be your wife.
Till the time l?m alive..

941
00:59:43,737 --> 00:59:45,737
..how can someone
else be your wife?

942
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:46,737
See, keep quiet, or
else l?ll break your face!

943
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:49,736
You?ll break my face? Break it.
l?ll see how you break my face.

944
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:51,735
Hey, do you go or not? ? Ravi!

945
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:54,735
What is all this happening?
l had told you, didn't l?

946
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:56,733
That there shouldn't be any
kind of fights or noise here?

947
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:01,732
Are you remember? - l remember.
Please forgive me.

948
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:04,731
Okay. if any fight or
noise occurs the next time..

949
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,730
..l?ll remove you
from this house right away.

950
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,729
Yes, yes, yes. l understand.

951
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:18,727
l understood. Today l
kept silent because of her.

952
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,725
But l?m warning
you for the last time.

953
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:22,725
if you don?t go away from here,
till evening, till the time..

954
01:00:22,725 --> 01:00:24,725
..l return from the office,
then today..

955
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,724
..will be last day
of your whole life.

956
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,723
Never. Till the time
the guardian of my life..

957
01:00:29,723 --> 01:00:32,722
..is with me, you
can't harm me in any way.

958
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:35,721
Okay, so you've prepared a
fake symbol of marriage too?

959
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:37,720
Who has tied it
for you, tell me?

960
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,720
O God, you?re the
one who tied it..

961
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,719
..and now, you?re
asking me who tied it?

962
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:45,718
l feel that my brains will
blast with a huge explosion.

963
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:47,717
Should l massage your head?

964
01:00:47,717 --> 01:00:49,716
Good for nothing! Let me
come back in the evening.

965
01:00:49,716 --> 01:00:50,716
Then l?ll show you.

966
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:52,715
Listen, what?ll you show me?

967
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,715
Good for nothing! You?ll know
in the evening what l?ll show.

968
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:57,713
Take your food Tiffin at least.

969
01:00:57,713 --> 01:01:02,712
Good for nothing!
Sticker! l should your!

970
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:05,711
l should!

971
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,710
You've not
understood me at all, as yet.

972
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,708
Ravi, there?s a
very good chance for you.

973
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,707
The singers and dancers
of all over the country..

974
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:21,706
..will be
competing in a competition.

You don?t get such
chances again, Ravi.

Just like that? Do you want
to make my life hell here too?

you?re scolding her?

Look in your pocket.

1037

Only milk, l had asked

Why didn't you bring

A little bit of poison.
l?ll drink that too.

1044
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:39,603
Oh no. it?s such
a great night today.

1045
01:06:39,603 --> 01:06:41,602
Why are you talking
such inauspicious things?

1046
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:45,602
Don?t touch me, don?t touch me.

1047
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,600
Because the matter
always starts from the hand..

1048
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,600
..and God knows till
where it reaches then.

1049
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,589
hey, where are
you running off too??

1050
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:23,589
come here!?

1051
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:43,582
l?m incomplete without you,
you?re incomplete without me.?

1052
01:07:43,582 --> 01:07:49,581
O beloved, meet me,
so that l become yours.

1053
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:54,579
Let us hug each other tightly,
come let us play like this.

1054
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:59,577
Let us be lost in
the dreams of love.

1055
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:05,575
The first night,
of love for sleeping..

1056
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:10,574
..don?t waste them
in just words.

1057
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,570
Hey, keep quiet.

1058
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:16,552
my wishes have
been unfulfilled.?

1059
01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:34,546
even though l?m a bride,
l?m yet a spinster.?

1060
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:50,541
nor did my earrings fall,
nor did my bangles smile.?

1061
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:56,540
even the kohl of my eyes
has not been cleared yet.?

1062
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,539
Please go!

1063
01:11:13,515 --> 01:11:21,512
O beloved, please
don?t run away from me.?

1064
01:11:21,512 --> 01:11:28,509
please keep asleep
and awake with me.?

1065
01:11:49,502 --> 01:11:51,502
what?s to be ashamed in this??

1066
01:11:51,502 --> 01:12:00,499
it's the duty of a husband.
Tie me in your embrace.?

1067
01:12:01,499 --> 01:12:02,498
Oh, shameless!

1068
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:07,478
There is surely
some secret in this.

1069
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:09,476
Secret? What kind of secret?

1070
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:11,476
She knows your weakness,
and therefore she?s..

1071
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:15,475
..playing you
like a toy with a key.

1072
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,474
Should l give you an idea?
? What? What? What?

1073
01:13:17,474 --> 01:13:21,473
if she?s a she devil,
then you become a devil.

1074
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:25,471
if she?s a she ghost,
then you become a ghost.

1075
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:27,471
With a bottle of
liquor in your hand..

1076
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,470
..acting like a drunkard,
and laughing..

1077
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,469
..reach there,
and then she?ll run..

1078
01:13:33,469 --> 01:13:35,468
..just like the thief
runs when he sees the police.

1079
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:42,466
l?ll show you, right now!

1080
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:50,464
Hey, girl, tell me,

1082
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:57,461
Tell me the truth, who
are you? Will you tell or not?

1083
01:13:57,461 --> 01:13:58,461
Have you drunk and come?

1084
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:01,460
Yes, l've drunk
too much and come.

1085
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:07,458
l've drunk pot-fulls and come.
Just because of you.

1086
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:12,456
With all the
money of my salary..

1087
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:17,455
..l've drunk so much, in
which people could have bathed!

1088
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:22,453
You blew away your salary? ?
Yes, now l?ll blow you off too.

1089
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:26,451
Tell me, tell the truth! Who
are you? Otherwise l?ll ruin you!

1090
01:14:26,451 --> 01:14:27,452
How many times
should l tell you?

1091
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:28,451
l?m your wife, l?m your wife!

1092
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,451
No. l've told
you so many times..

1093
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:33,449
..that you aren't my wife,
you aren't my wife.

1094
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:36,448
Tell me, you wretch,
will you tell me or not?

1095
01:14:39,447 --> 01:14:41,447
Hey, what are you doing?

1096
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:45,445
That what, l should
l have done earlier.

1097
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:48,445
Wait, l?ll show you.
Just a minute.

1098
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:57,442
To kill you, l bought a
Rampuri knife from the flea market.

1099
01:14:57,442 --> 01:15:05,439
But before that, before that,
l?ll rape you. l?ll rape you.

1100
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:15,436
After that, l'll kill you.
You've troubled me a lot.

1101
01:15:16,435 --> 01:15:18,435
Please don?t like this.
Please don?t.

1102
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:24,433
Which one should l not do?
The first or the second?

1103
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:27,432
Kill me if you wish, but
please don?t do the first one.

1104
01:15:27,432 --> 01:15:34,430
Set up. l?ll do that too,
and l?ll do this too.

1105
01:15:39,428 --> 01:15:43,426
l?ll present every
item after an item!

1106
01:15:44,427 --> 01:15:49,425
The sparrow is
writhing in the cage!

1107
01:15:55,423 --> 01:16:01,421
Hey, okay, so
this is your tailor.

1108
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:04,420
Pankaj Lal Chabbria, Panku!

1109
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:12,417
With the blouse made
with such a rotten cloth..

1110
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:17,416
..do you think that he can
save your dignity? it?s gone!

1111
01:16:19,415 --> 01:16:21,415
Please don?t do
like this. This is sin.

1112
01:16:22,414 --> 01:16:31,411
There is no sin or anything.
This will make Pappu.

1113
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:35,410
You want Pappu,
don?t you, yes, yes?

1114
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:43,407
And after the birth of Pappu,
l?ll be called Pappu?s papa..

1115
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:47,406
..and you'll be
called Pappu;s papi.

1116
01:16:47,406 --> 01:16:51,405
Give me a kiss, hey
what are you doing?

1117
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,404
Why do you push me, you wretch?

1118
01:17:02,401 --> 01:17:03,401
What is she doing?

1119
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:13,397
Sampat, l'd come to rape her,
but l think she?ll kill me.

1120
01:17:13,397 --> 01:17:18,396
She?ll murder me! Sampat!

1121
01:17:18,396 --> 01:17:21,395
Why are you
acting like a wild beast?

1122
01:17:21,395 --> 01:17:23,394
Yesterday, when l cam
close to you myself..

1123
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:25,394
..you ran away from me,
and today under..

1124
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:29,392
..the influence of alcohol,
you?re trying to rape me?

1125
01:17:29,392 --> 01:17:33,391
What will you rape anybody?
One needs to be..

1126
01:17:33,391 --> 01:17:36,390
.. stone heated for this.
Guts are needed. Do you dare?

1127
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:42,388
I'll surrender myself.
You'd come to loot your treasure.

1128
01:17:42,388 --> 01:17:46,387
isn't it? Take this,
and loot it.

1129
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:51,386
Hey, Sampat get up! ?
Who is it? ? Your father!

1130
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:53,384
My father? l've killed
my father twenty times.

1131
01:17:53,384 --> 01:17:55,384
How has he been born again?

1132
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:58,383
Open your eyes and see.
it?s me, Ravi.

1133
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,382
Why are you
sleeping outside here?

1134
01:18:00,382 --> 01:18:01,382
Has the wife kicked you out?

1135
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:04,382
No. She has been habituated
to the smell of alcohol.

1136
01:18:04,382 --> 01:18:07,380
l didn't get to drink today,
so she kicked me out here.

1137
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,380
But what are you doing here?

1138
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:12,379
What a rotten idea you
gave me! What a rotten idea!

1139
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:17,376
Drink alcohol, become a devil,
go rape her, she?ll run away!

1140
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,376
Yes, l'd said that.
Did she not run away?

1141
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:22,375
Where did she run away?
She made me run away.

1142
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:25,374
She stripped
herself and stood in front.

1143
01:18:25,374 --> 01:18:28,374
And she said, take it,
loot the treasure.

1144
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:32,372
O my God! l think she
is a very shrewd woman.

1145
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,372
Whether she?s
shrewd or not, but..

1146
01:18:34,372 --> 01:18:36,371
..today l?ll surely
reach you to the cemetery.

1147
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,369
What are you doing up there?
Get down here!

1148
01:18:40,369 --> 01:18:41,369
Have l gone crazy to come down?

1149
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:45,368
if l come down, you?ll
remove my knickers beating me and..

1150
01:18:45,368 --> 01:18:49,366
.. send me to the cemetery.
l've not drunk as it is.

1151
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:51,366
Hey, please give me some money.
l?ll go and drink some alcohol

1152
01:18:51,366 --> 01:18:52,366
..l feel faint.
Please give me.

1153
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:55,365
Where did he go? ? l don?t know.

1154
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,363
He must have gone to an
alcohol shop ? Drunken wretch!

1155
01:19:06,361 --> 01:19:10,359
Uru. ? Who is it?

1156
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:13,359
You've come with a
guitar to sing? ? Me?

1157
01:19:14,358 --> 01:19:17,357
Urvashi.. ? What is it?

1158
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:22,356
Hey, please change your
facial expression a bit.

1159
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:23,355
ls that enough?

1160
01:19:32,353 --> 01:19:36,351
l've come ask for
forgiveness from you.

1161
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:39,350
For the
undisciplined behavior yesterday.

1162
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,349
if you don?t feel bad, can l
tell you something? ? Tell me.

1163
01:19:44,348 --> 01:19:47,347
Do you think that l'd
drunk and come? ? Yes.

1164
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:52,346
No. l'd sprinkled alcohol on
my clothes, and acted as a drunk.

1165
01:19:52,346 --> 01:19:55,345
l swear upon you, even a single
drop hadn't gone down my gullet.

1166
01:19:56,345 --> 01:19:58,344
Really?

1167
01:20:00,343 --> 01:20:03,342
l swear upon you.
- Hey, don?t cry.

1168
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,341
You love me too much, don?t you?

1169
01:20:09,341 --> 01:20:13,339
You tell me first. ? l
love you more than my life.

1170
01:20:13,339 --> 01:20:16,338
ls it so? Yes? ls it so?

1171
01:20:16,338 --> 01:20:21,337
Okay tell me, if a girl,
if a girl, loves me..

1172
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:27,334
..with all her life and soul,
then what?ll you do?

1173
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:29,334
l?ll give up my own life.

1174
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:32,333
Wow. l got the idea of
releasing my life from her.

1175
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:39,331
Urvashi, We've
fought too much till today.

1176
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,330
From today,
we?ll make love okay?

1177
01:20:45,329 --> 01:20:47,328
First we?ll go to
a picnic. -Okay.

1178
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:50,327
Then we?ll go to swimming,
okay? ? Okay.

1179
01:20:50,327 --> 01:20:53,326
Then we?ll go for dinner
in some nice hotel ? Okay.

1180
01:20:53,326 --> 01:20:58,325
And then, at night,
at night, at night, that.

1181
01:20:58,325 --> 01:21:00,324
That? What?

1182
01:21:00,324 --> 01:21:01,323
Oh that same thing, not
the first kid right now..

1183
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,323
..and after the
second kid, never again.

1184
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:04,322
There, did you feel shy?

1185
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:08,322
Okay. l've an idea.
That swimming pool..

1186
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:11,320
..opposite the Association,
meet me there in the evening.

1187
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
l?ll fit the whole
matter there, okay.

1188
01:21:32,314 --> 01:21:34,313
Oh! l?m dead!

1189
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:20,298
????????
. . . . . . . .

1190
01:22:22,298 --> 01:22:28,295
l am fortunate,
you became my beloved.?

1191
01:22:30,295 --> 01:22:39,292
O beloved, O chinamma.
O chinamma!?

1192
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:46,290
O Lakshmaya, O Lakshmaya.?

1193
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:55,287
You're very spicy, My
heart dances a flutter.?

1194
01:23:48,269 --> 01:23:50,269
You?re beautiful
from head to toe.?

1195
01:23:50,269 --> 01:23:52,269
You're an ocean of beauty.?

1196
01:23:52,269 --> 01:23:54,267
what?s so special about you??

1197
01:23:54,267 --> 01:23:57,267
my heart just..

1198
01:23:57,267 --> 01:24:03,265
..waits for you! O mother!?

1199
01:24:06,264 --> 01:24:10,263
when you laugh, when
you settle in my embrace.?

1200
01:24:10,263 --> 01:24:17,260
all my nerves smile, l
don?t have peace without you.?

1201
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:29,237
You are so supple,
you are my queen.?

1202
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:31,236
water doesn't
settle on your body..?

1203
01:25:31,236 --> 01:25:39,234
looking at the body,
even fires burn! O mother!?

1204
01:25:42,233 --> 01:25:44,232
now that you and
l have fixed up.?

1205
01:25:44,232 --> 01:25:46,232
the whole world
has lost it?s likes.?

1206
01:25:46,232 --> 01:25:48,230
the world has
moved away from the road.?

1207
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:52,229
we dance and
make others dance..

1208
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:57,228
..?till they tire! O mother!?

1209
01:27:03,207 --> 01:27:09,205
Hey, hey , hey! What is it?
Let me go! Let me go!

1210
01:27:09,205 --> 01:27:13,203
What are you doing? Honest
people don?t act like this.

1211
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:16,203
l know very well what l?m doing.

1212
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:22,200
l love this girl, and very
soon, l?ll be marrying her.

1213
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,200
Marriage?

1214
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,199
Yes marriage. What is
so shocking about it?

1215
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,198
No, you can't marry her.

1216
01:27:30,198 --> 01:27:32,197
Why, why can l marry her?
Who are you to stop me?

1217
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:36,196
l am your wife. You can't
do such an injustice to me.

1218
01:27:36,196 --> 01:27:39,194
if you can't tolerate injustice,
then go and commit suicide.

1219
01:27:39,194 --> 01:27:41,194
But, you better don?t
meddle in my matters, understood?

1220
01:27:43,194 --> 01:27:51,191
it's okay then. Tell me truly,
do you really want to marry her?

1221
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:53,191
Yes, surely.

1222
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:55,189
it has been the
tradition of our country..

1223
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:58,188
..that the husband and
wife are bound to each other..

1224
01:27:58,188 --> 01:28:01,188
..with the strings of love.
But since the time witches like..

1225
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:04,187
..you've come like scissors,
the strings have been cut.

1226
01:28:05,186 --> 01:28:09,185
Hey listen. l didn't go
and call him my darling.

1227
01:28:09,185 --> 01:28:12,184
He himself called me
darling and fell in my lap.

1228
01:28:12,184 --> 01:28:15,183
isn't it darling?
isn't it correct?

1229
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:22,181
Anyway, if your
happiness lies in this..

1230
01:28:22,181 --> 01:28:24,180
..then what problems can l have?

1231
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:30,179
it?s the duty of every wife
to bow to her husband?s wishes.

1232
01:28:31,178 --> 01:28:36,177
Sister, if you can
give him the happiness..

1233
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:41,175
..that l can't give, then
undoubtedly, you marry him.

1234
01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:43,174
Really?

1235
01:28:46,174 --> 01:28:47,173
This plan has failed too!

1236
01:28:50,172 --> 01:28:52,171
Let us go home and make
preparations for the marriage.

1237
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:57,170
Yes, honey, let's go home.
if not honey? -go from here.

1238
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,168
Wasn't you the malaria enough..

1239
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:01,168
..that you?re talking
about taking this cancer home?

1240
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:08,166
Yes, and you. ihad
given you 500 Rs to act.

1241
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:10,166
And you started sticking to me?

1242
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:14,164
Hey, please give me a chance
of becoming the wife and see.

1243
01:29:14,164 --> 01:29:17,163
ls it so? Go,
get lost from here.

1244
01:29:19,162 --> 01:29:22,161
Hey,darling's kid, what are you
calling me as darling?

1245
01:29:22,161 --> 01:29:25,160
l?ll give you such a kick that
you?ll face Darjeeling, get lost!

1246
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,159
Okay. Bye, sister! Ta-ta!

1247
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:34,158
Ta-ta, I'll give her one kick
with Bata, I'll smash her face.

1248
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:37,157
Come, let us go home.

1249
01:29:37,157 --> 01:29:39,156
Which house, whose house?
What house? l've no house.

1250
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:42,155
l?ll stay here, l?ll
sleep here and eat here too.

1251
01:29:42,155 --> 01:29:44,154
And l?ll go to
my duty from here..

1252
01:29:44,154 --> 01:29:46,153
..and return here
directly from duty. That?s it.

1253
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:49,152
ls it so, what will
you do for your meals?

1254
01:29:49,152 --> 01:29:53,152
For my meals? l?ll
eat fodder and grass.

1255
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,150
Oh no! l?ll bring
food everyday for you here.

1256
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:01,149
That means, that means
you won't leave me here too?

1257
01:30:01,149 --> 01:30:06,147
No. ? O God! What sins had l
committed in my previous life?

1258
01:30:06,147 --> 01:30:09,146
Why have you stuck this
forcible tail behind me?

1259
01:30:10,146 --> 01:30:13,145
See, my mother, my father,
my whole family!

1260
01:30:13,145 --> 01:30:16,143
You won, and l lost. Please
go away, please go away. - No

1261
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:23,142
You won't go? You won't go?
l?ll strangle you! l?ll be back.

1262
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:26,140
Go, run away. ?
Listen to me please.

1263
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:30,140
l told you not to follow me.
? Listen to me for a minute.

1264
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,139
She?s still
following me, go run away.

1265
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:35,138
Please wait, where
are you going? ? Leave me!

1266
01:30:36,137 --> 01:30:38,137
Please listen to me.
Listen, please listen to me.

1267
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:52,132
Wait. Leave me! Ravi, help!

1268
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:55,131
What kind of husband are you?

1269
01:30:55,131 --> 01:30:59,130
l?m being raped here and
you?re just staring! Help!

1270
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:04,129
Oh, husband? Who husband?
Which husband? What?

1271
01:31:04,129 --> 01:31:05,128
Where did this
husband come from?

1272
01:31:05,128 --> 01:31:07,128
Wretched trouble! Yes,
take her, take her away.

1273
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:18,124
Ravi, so what if
she?s not your wife?

1274
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:21,123
She?s a woman, and it?s
the duty of every man..

1275
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:25,122
..to save the dignity of
a woman, Go, save her, Ravi!

1276
01:33:16,085 --> 01:33:21,084
Ravi, Ravi, Ravi.

1277
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:30,081
Ravi?s leg has
been taken care of.

1278
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:34,080
There?s none who can
defeat me in the competition now.

1279
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:39,078
Sir, how is he now?

1280
01:33:41,078 --> 01:33:42,077
Firstly, his leg
has been fractured.

1281
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:45,076
Secondly, due to a
serious wound in the head..

1282
01:33:45,076 --> 01:33:46,076
..too much of
blood has been shed.

1283
01:33:46,076 --> 01:33:49,075
He needs blood.
Because the hospital..

1284
01:33:49,075 --> 01:33:51,075
..doesn't have O negative blood.

1285
01:33:51,075 --> 01:33:53,073
Please arrange
for it immediately.

1286
01:33:53,073 --> 01:33:56,072
Sir, my blood comes
in the O negative group.

1287
01:33:56,072 --> 01:33:58,072
Please take my blood quickly.

1288
01:33:58,072 --> 01:33:59,072
Please come with me.

1289
01:34:43,057 --> 01:34:46,056
How is Ravi now? ? He?s
all right now. ? ls it?

1290
01:34:55,054 --> 01:34:58,053
You are very brave.
You?ll be all right soon.

1291
01:34:58,053 --> 01:35:05,050
Be brave, and listen,
l?ll leave now, okay?

1292
01:35:16,047 --> 01:35:19,046
Everything will be
all right. l?ll leave now.

1293
01:35:25,044 --> 01:35:27,043
Ravi has had a serious accident.

1294
01:35:28,043 --> 01:35:30,042
Looking at the
state that he?s in..

1295
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:33,041
..l don?t think that he can
take part in this competition.

1296
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,041
Yes. This is a
national level competition.

1297
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,040
And then, it?s the question
of our Association?s honor.

1298
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,039
Yes. Therefore, l
think that someone else..

1299
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:43,038
..should be chosen
for this competition.

1300
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:47,036
But yes, remember, that
Ravi shouldn't know about it.

1301
01:35:48,037 --> 01:35:50,035
He?ll be very
sad if he knows it.

1302
01:35:53,035 --> 01:35:56,034
Sir, l wish to speak
to you about something.

1303
01:35:56,034 --> 01:36:00,032
Please come with me. ? Mrs.
Kapoor, just a minute.

1304
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:09,030
Sir, l pray to you.
You've given such..

1305
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:15,028
..a huge opportunity to Ravi,
don?t snatch it away from him.

1306
01:36:15,028 --> 01:36:17,027
l?m helpless,
child. There are only..

1307
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:20,026
..ten days left for the program.
Ravi?ll be unable to perform..

1308
01:36:20,026 --> 01:36:22,025
..a program on the
stage after ten days.

1309
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:25,025
it?s very difficult for
him to be cured in ten days.

1310
01:36:25,025 --> 01:36:27,023
Then dancing is a
very far off thing.

1311
01:36:27,023 --> 01:36:30,022
Ten days is too much
of a time if God wishes..

1312
01:36:30,022 --> 01:36:33,022
..he can change a
man?s luck within a day.

1313
01:36:33,022 --> 01:36:36,021
My heart says that
Ravi?ll surely be cured.

1314
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:40,019
He has thought
that this program..

1315
01:36:40,019 --> 01:36:43,018
..is a dream of his lifetime.
Please don?t break this dream.

1316
01:36:44,018 --> 01:36:46,018
Otherwise, he
will be heart broken.

1317
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:49,017
We, even we want
that Ravi should..

1318
01:36:49,017 --> 01:36:51,016
..participate in this
competition. But what can we do?

1319
01:36:51,016 --> 01:36:54,015
Do whatever you want.
l fall at your feet.

1320
01:36:54,015 --> 01:36:56,014
Get up, child.

1321
01:36:57,014 --> 01:37:00,013
Sir, please let Ravi
lose this opportunity.

1322
01:37:01,013 --> 01:37:03,012
Please don?t let
him lose this chance.

1323
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:07,010
l take the
responsibility to cure him.

1324
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:12,009
it?s good then, dear.
if you take the responsibility..

1325
01:37:13,009 --> 01:37:15,008
..if you have
so much belief in your prayers.

1326
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,007
if you believe in
your God so much..

1327
01:37:17,007 --> 01:37:19,007
..then Ravi will surely
take part in this competition.

1328
01:37:20,006 --> 01:37:24,005
Okay, are you happy now?
Can l leave now?

1329
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:27,004
Thank you very much.
? God bless you.

1330
01:37:51,996 --> 01:37:56,994
Teacher! Hey Teacher!
What is all this?

1331
01:37:57,995 --> 01:38:03,992
This is strange! l was in Delhi.
l was in the Budget Session.

1332
01:38:03,992 --> 01:38:06,991
l can to know about this there.
l took off from Delhi..

1333
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:09,990
..and landed here in Mumbai. You
had such a huge accident..

1334
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:13,989
..and you didn't even
inform me? l won't spare you.

1335
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:15,988
l?ll send all the
ruffians on a vacation.

1336
01:38:15,988 --> 01:38:17,988
l?ll make the
police beat half of them..

1337
01:38:17,988 --> 01:38:19,987
..and l myself will
beat the other half.

1338
01:38:19,987 --> 01:38:21,987
Like that, everything
is all right, isn't it?

1339
01:38:21,987 --> 01:38:23,985
There is no danger, isn't it?

1340
01:38:24,986 --> 01:38:26,985
What kind of a
donkey am l? The person..

1341
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:29,984
..who was in the hospital,
if he?s come home..

1342
01:38:29,984 --> 01:38:31,983
..it means that his
danger has passed over.

1343
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,983
When a person drinks less,
this is what happens with him.

1344
01:38:34,983 --> 01:38:36,981
All kind of wrong things
are uttered from his mouth.

1345
01:38:37,982 --> 01:38:40,980
l drank three quarters,
how many, three.

1346
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,980
But l got the
intoxication of only one quarter.

1347
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,979
Nowadays they mix
too much of water.

1348
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:48,978
l was in Delhi. l
shouted in the Parliament.

1349
01:38:48,978 --> 01:38:51,977
When will the
ruffians of this country stop?

1350
01:38:52,976 --> 01:38:56,975
Mothers are being raped,
sisters are being widowed.

1351
01:38:57,975 --> 01:39:00,973
Orphans are shedding
their blood like water.

1352
01:39:00,973 --> 01:39:03,973
And my friend is
writhing with wounds.

1353
01:39:03,973 --> 01:39:06,972
When will those wounds be cured?

1354
01:39:06,972 --> 01:39:09,971
l shook the whole of
Delhi and kept it in my pocket.

1355
01:39:09,971 --> 01:39:11,971
And now, hey you
didn't eat the fruit?

1356
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:13,969
Please have it,
it is very sweet.

1357
01:39:13,969 --> 01:39:15,969
Uncle,
- Yes? ? Please take this tea.

1358
01:39:15,969 --> 01:39:19,968
Daughter, please don?t call
me uncle, he gets angry on me.

1359
01:39:20,967 --> 01:39:22,967
Daughter, it?s not
time for me to have tea.

1360
01:39:23,966 --> 01:39:24,966
My time for
drinking tea is different.

1361
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:27,965
in the morning, from getting
up from the sleep till sleeping..

1362
01:39:27,965 --> 01:39:30,964
..again in the night, l don?t
drink tea. l drink tea after that.

1363
01:39:30,964 --> 01:39:32,963
Now, it?s time
for me to drink this.

1364
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:38,962
Ravi, Seeing your state,
I'm very sad, friend.

1365
01:39:38,962 --> 01:39:41,961
if you permit, can
l have some of this?

1366
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,959
Let it be, l?ll not drink.
Daughter, don?t worry.

1367
01:39:45,959 --> 01:39:47,958
if you've any problem, call
me in the middle of the night.

1368
01:39:48,959 --> 01:39:51,958
l?ll come on my head.
l?ll come walking on my head.

1369
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:54,957
You don't worry. And Ravi, you get
well soon. l?ll just..

1370
01:39:54,957 --> 01:39:58,955
..drown his quarter in
the drain of my gullet.

1371
01:39:58,955 --> 01:39:59,955
Just l go and return.

1372
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:02,954
Don?t worry, as soon as l go,
l?ll come back.

1373
01:40:03,953 --> 01:40:04,954
Where is he going?

1374
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:13,950
What place is this? it?s
stinking here. Where is the door?

1375
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,949
it?s there. ? it?s there?
While coming it was here.

1376
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:19,948
How did it go there?
Okay, I'm going.

1377
01:42:20,909 --> 01:42:25,908
Urvashi!
Urvashi! You have fever.

1378
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,906
Did you eat anything or not? -
l had eaten the God?s offering.

1379
01:42:29,906 --> 01:42:33,905
God?s offering? You have only
God's offering from next tomorrow!.

1380
01:42:33,905 --> 01:42:35,904
Have you decided to die?

1381
01:42:36,904 --> 01:42:40,902
See, daughter, life and
death is in the hands of God.

1382
01:42:40,902 --> 01:42:43,901
What?s the use in
getting so worried about it?

1383
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:47,900
l just pray to God,
that he gets well soon.

1384
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,900
So that he?s able to
compete in the competition.

1385
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:56,897
So that he goes there, he
sings, wins and gets an award.

1386
01:42:56,897 --> 01:43:00,896
He becomes famous. His
life?s ambition is fulfilled.

1387
01:43:01,895 --> 01:43:05,895
For that. God make me
ill forever for that.

1388
01:43:05,895 --> 01:43:09,893
Yes, Mother, this is what
l want. This is what l want.

1389
01:43:23,889 --> 01:43:25,888
My name has been
printed in the invitation card.

1390
01:43:25,888 --> 01:43:27,887
l can participate
in the competition.

1391
01:43:27,887 --> 01:43:29,887
l will dance, l
will sing. l will..

1392
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:36,884
..but my leg's fracture band
hasn't been opened yet.

1393
01:43:38,884 --> 01:43:46,881
My leg has been broken.
And with my leg breaking..

1394
01:43:46,881 --> 01:43:50,880
..all the ambitions of my
life have been broken too.

1395
01:43:57,877 --> 01:44:02,876
l won't take any steps hastily
and make him a cripple for life.

1396
01:44:02,876 --> 01:44:06,875
Have patience, everything
will be all right. Go, go home.

1397
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:09,874
Till the time you don?t open
his plaster, l won't go home.

1398
01:44:09,874 --> 01:44:13,872
impossible. Till today,
this hasn't happened in medical..

1399
01:44:13,872 --> 01:44:15,872
..history. Try to understand me.

1400
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,871
l don?t know anything
about your medical history.

1401
01:44:18,871 --> 01:44:21,869
l have full faith in my God.
He will never disappoint me.

1402
01:44:21,869 --> 01:44:22,870
impossible. This can't be done.

1403
01:44:23,869 --> 01:44:26,868
if you don?t open his plaster,
then l?ll do it myself.

1404
01:44:28,868 --> 01:44:30,867
l can't do
anything in this matter.

1405
01:44:32,867 --> 01:44:36,865
At least try for me.
l beg of you.

1406
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:54,859
But remember, if
anything happens to him..

1407
01:44:54,859 --> 01:44:58,857
..you?ll be responsible
for that, okay? ? Yes. ? Come.

1408
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:28,848
Daughter, your God
has listened to you.

1409
01:45:29,848 --> 01:45:31,847
Daughter, l've lost and you
have won. ? What?

1410
01:45:31,847 --> 01:45:33,847
The bone has connected!

1411
01:49:26,771 --> 01:49:29,771
l?ll break dance!?

1412
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:33,769
l?ll leave only after
making everybody dance!?

1413
01:49:40,767 --> 01:49:44,765
l?ll break all the records!?

1414
01:52:15,716 --> 01:52:19,715
come let us dance,
come let us love.?

1415
01:52:24,714 --> 01:52:28,712
there are so many
beautiful and lovely faces here.?

1416
01:52:28,712 --> 01:52:33,711
our life is here,
dancing, singing and being happy.?

1417
01:52:33,711 --> 01:52:35,710
'Dance! Sing! ? Dance! Sing!'

1418
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:37,709
'Dance, Sing! Wow! Wow!'

1419
01:53:17,697 --> 01:53:20,696
even the heart
works with rhythm.?

1420
01:53:20,696 --> 01:53:22,694
heart beat is
the name of rhythm.?

1421
01:53:26,693 --> 01:53:31,692
the world works on rhythm,
The name of rhythm is life.?

1422
01:53:31,692 --> 01:53:33,691
even the stars as
well as the light dances.?

1423
01:53:33,691 --> 01:53:35,690
the earth as well
as the sky dances.?

1424
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:37,690
the flowers as
well as Babban dances!?

1425
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:51,666
Ravi, Ravi!

1426
01:55:01,663 --> 01:55:03,661
Ravi.

1427
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:10,659
Congratulations.

1428
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:16,657
Ravi, winning this award,
you've kept our name high.

1429
01:55:16,657 --> 01:55:18,657
All this is your mercy,
sir. if you hadn't given me a..

1430
01:55:18,657 --> 01:55:21,656
..chance, then forget about
this award, even that a singer..

1431
01:55:21,656 --> 01:55:24,655
..named Ravi existed in
this city wouldn't be known

1432
01:55:26,654 --> 01:55:29,653
But the truth is that,
We've not given you this chance.

1433
01:55:29,653 --> 01:55:32,652
it was your wife who forced
us to give you this chance.

1434
01:55:33,652 --> 01:55:37,651
What? ? Yes, when you
were in the hospital..

1435
01:55:37,651 --> 01:55:39,650
..we had decided that you
would not be taking part in the.

1436
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:41,650
..competition, because
you weren't able to dance

1437
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:44,649
But your wife, cried,
requested, and even fell..

1438
01:55:44,649 --> 01:55:47,648
..at our feet, requested us,
that we shouldn't snatch..

1439
01:55:48,647 --> 01:55:50,646
..this golden
opportunity of your life.

1440
01:55:51,647 --> 01:55:54,646
She took the full responsibility
of curing you and bringing..

1441
01:55:55,645 --> 01:55:57,645
..you on stage. We were
forced to give you this chance.

1442
01:55:57,645 --> 01:56:02,643
Therefore the real heir of these
thanks is not us, but your wife.

1443
01:56:03,642 --> 01:56:04,642
Yes, Ravi!

1444
01:56:05,642 --> 01:56:07,642
Urvashi!

1445
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:16,638
Where has she gone? Urvashi?

1446
01:56:28,635 --> 01:56:30,633
When did you come back?
? Greetings mother.

1447
01:56:31,634 --> 01:56:36,632
Bless you. ? Mother, l won this
competition by your blessings.

1448
01:56:37,631 --> 01:56:40,630
l got this gold medal.
? Congratulations son.

1449
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:42,630
May God give you more success!

1450
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,629
l would have come myself,
but l was ill.

1451
01:56:47,628 --> 01:56:49,627
l saw your
program on the television.

1452
01:56:50,627 --> 01:56:52,627
The country?s such a
great artist lives in my house..

1453
01:56:53,626 --> 01:56:56,625
..knowing this, my
head was high with pride.

1454
01:56:57,624 --> 01:57:00,624
Mother, where
is my wife? ? Wife?

1455
01:57:01,624 --> 01:57:05,622
Say it again. ?
Where is my wife?

1456
01:57:05,622 --> 01:57:09,621
Today, for the first time,
listening the word ?wife?..

1457
01:57:09,621 --> 01:57:12,620
..for Urvashi,
l feel very happy.

1458
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:16,619
Son, very lucky
people get such a wife.

1459
01:57:17,618 --> 01:57:19,618
Everybody makes
a show of serving.

1460
01:57:19,618 --> 01:57:23,616
But the real service is
which the husband won't realize.

1461
01:57:23,616 --> 01:57:26,615
Since the time you had
gone to the hospital..

1462
01:57:26,615 --> 01:57:28,615
..like a crazy girl,
that girl has been..

1463
01:57:28,615 --> 01:57:31,614
..going to temples,
mosques, and churches.

1464
01:57:31,614 --> 01:57:39,611
She kept praying and fasting
for your health and success.

1465
01:57:39,611 --> 01:57:41,611
Otherwise, dancing and
singing is another matter..

1466
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:42,610
..you wouldn't
even be cured by now.

1467
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:44,610
Even the doctors
themselves are surprised.

1468
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,609
Mother, where is Urvashi?

1469
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:51,608
To pray for your health, she
has gone to Bholenath temple.

1470
01:58:27,595 --> 01:58:34,593
Urvashi. That?s enough.
Please stop this difficult vow.

1471
01:58:34,593 --> 01:58:36,593
God has
listened to your request.

1472
01:58:37,592 --> 01:58:40,591
Only l got the first prize
in such a huge competition.

1473
01:58:41,592 --> 01:58:44,590
l got this prize,
this medal and this shawl.

1474
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:51,588
But, but whatever Ravi got,
he got it only because of you.

1475
01:58:53,587 --> 01:58:58,586
See, Urvashi, see,
open your eyes. Please.

1476
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:16,580
Take this. All this yours, yes.

1477
01:59:34,574 --> 01:59:39,573
l sung on the stage. But
every word of my son was..

1478
01:59:39,573 --> 01:59:43,571
..indebted to you. The
hall was echoing with applause.

1479
01:59:43,571 --> 01:59:46,570
But from every applause,
bless Urvashi?..

1480
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:48,570
..?May Urvashi live
long!? That was what being heard.

1481
01:59:50,569 --> 01:59:53,568
l don?t even know you.
for an stranger..

1482
01:59:53,568 --> 01:59:58,567
..you served me so, you
served me so, that rarely..

1483
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:03,565
.. must a wife would
have served her husband such.

1484
02:00:05,564 --> 02:00:11,562
You worshipped this God
from morning till evening.

1485
02:00:12,562 --> 02:00:17,560
But l, l should
pray to this Goddess.

1486
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:26,557
Urvashi, you've given me a
new life, you are my Goddess.

1487
02:00:40,553 --> 02:00:44,551
God, you've
succeeded my penance.

1488
02:00:44,551 --> 02:00:48,551
You've fulfilled my ambitions,
you've heard my prayers.

1489
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:53,548
You've proved today,
that you keep the respect..

1490
02:00:53,548 --> 02:00:55,548
..of real love and real penance.

1491
02:00:56,548 --> 02:00:58,547
You've kept a
woman?s dignity today.

1492
02:00:58,547 --> 02:01:01,545
You saved my love
from being ruined.

1493
02:01:03,545 --> 02:01:08,544
Ravi, you, do you?

1494
02:01:08,544 --> 02:01:12,543
Yes, Urvashi, to which
God you have been praying..

1495
02:01:12,543 --> 02:01:16,541
..l keep him as my witness
and tell you that l love you.

1496
02:01:18,541 --> 02:01:23,539
l have faith in your words.
l don?t need any vow.

1497
02:01:24,538 --> 02:01:31,536
l've faith in my love.
Today, you've confessed your love.

1498
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:37,534
l shall tell you, in my mind,
the truth of your love.

1499
02:01:40,533 --> 02:01:46,531
it was a Diwali Night. l
had seen you singing alone.

1500
02:02:05,526 --> 02:02:13,523
since the time l've seen you,
l've asked you from God.?

1501
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,519
'You're the reason to live.'

1502
02:02:25,519 --> 02:02:31,516
You?re so beautiful, l
could see you all my life.?

1503
02:03:06,506 --> 02:03:14,503
'That closeness,
you gave it to me.?

1504
02:03:14,503 --> 02:03:21,500
'You won my heart.?

1505
02:03:42,494 --> 02:03:49,492
Your eyes shied away,
my heartbeats stopped.?

1506
02:03:50,491 --> 02:03:53,490
"My love was awakened."

1507
02:05:18,462 --> 02:05:32,458
let the story start at least,
let the lips touch the flower.?

1508
02:05:54,451 --> 02:06:01,449
the silky hair moved there,
the light shone somewhere.?

1509
02:06:02,448 --> 02:06:05,447
my house was brightened.?

1510
02:07:18,424 --> 02:07:22,422
Your song has become
the support of my life.

1511
02:07:23,422 --> 02:07:24,422
l've begun to
fall in love with you.

1512
02:07:25,421 --> 02:07:28,420
l feel, that l
should run towards you.

1513
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:31,419
l should cut my chest up,
and place my heart at your feet.

1514
02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:35,418
When l couldn't tolerate
my love for you any longer..

1515
02:07:35,418 --> 02:07:39,417
..then, one day, l came to
your house to confess my love.

1516
02:07:41,416 --> 02:07:45,415
Okay, father. ? Ravi,
l've become old now.

1517
02:07:47,415 --> 02:07:50,414
l want that you should
marry and settle your house now.

1518
02:07:51,413 --> 02:07:52,412
No, Daddy. l don?t
want to be trapped..

1519
02:07:52,412 --> 02:07:55,412
..in the trap of
house and household now.

1520
02:07:56,412 --> 02:07:58,411
First, let me fulfill
the ambition of my life.

1521
02:07:58,411 --> 02:08:02,409
l want to become a
famous singer and dancer.

1522
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:07,408
l don?t want to bury my
voice beneath stoves and vessels.

1523
02:08:08,407 --> 02:08:13,406
Okay, as you wish. Ravi, when
my old eyes close themselves..

1524
02:08:13,406 --> 02:08:18,404
..who will take care of
you and look after you?

1525
02:08:19,404 --> 02:08:22,403
No, daddy. Don?t say such
inauspicious things. ? Why?

1526
02:08:22,403 --> 02:08:25,402
in this city of Bombay,
thousand and millions of people..

1527
02:08:25,402 --> 02:08:29,400
..stay unprotected and orphans.
l?ll stay just as one of them.

1528
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,399
ls this your final decision?
? Yes father.

1529
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:35,399
The All India Talent Association
has called me for an interview.

1530
02:08:36,398 --> 02:08:39,397
l?m going to Bombay today.
Yes, if you know anyone in Bombay..

1531
02:08:39,397 --> 02:08:42,396
..then please give me
his name and address.

1532
02:08:42,396 --> 02:08:47,395
l?ll take his help. One
needs support in an unknown city.

1533
02:08:51,394 --> 02:08:55,392
Here, this is my friend.
He is quite a working wheel.

1534
02:08:55,392 --> 02:08:58,391
He?ll be of some help to you.

1535
02:08:58,391 --> 02:09:01,390
Okay, l?ll go now.
Greetings. ? Bless you.

1536
02:09:08,388 --> 02:09:10,388
Write a letter, surely okay.

1537
02:09:18,385 --> 02:09:22,383
You went to Bombay from there.
When l returned..

1538
02:09:22,383 --> 02:09:24,383
..sad to my place,
what did l see there?

1539
02:09:24,383 --> 02:09:27,382
That my father was
confirming my marriage proposal..

1540
02:09:27,382 --> 02:09:29,381
..to a Thakur's son,
without even asking me.

1541
02:09:30,381 --> 02:09:31,381
The one to whom l
had given my heart..

1542
02:09:31,381 --> 02:09:33,380
..leaving him, how
could l leave him and..

1543
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:35,379
..tie the nuptials
with someone else..

1544
02:09:35,379 --> 02:09:37,379
..and take the sacred
rounds around the sacred pyre?

1545
02:09:37,379 --> 02:09:40,378
The funeral pyre
would be better than that.

1546
02:09:41,377 --> 02:09:44,377
Then l decided to
leave the house..

1547
02:09:44,377 --> 02:09:46,375
..and decided to come
here to you in Bombay.

1548
02:09:46,375 --> 02:09:49,375
My aunt Y was surprised on
seeing me there all of a sudden.

1549
02:09:50,375 --> 02:09:52,374
But she supported
me like her daughter.

1550
02:09:52,374 --> 02:09:55,373
Actually, Sampat
Shrivastav is my real uncle.

1551
02:09:56,372 --> 02:10:00,372
And just like a crazy girl,
without thinking anything..

1552
02:10:00,372 --> 02:10:04,370
..leaving my parents,
l came to you.

1553
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:10,368
And l started living with you,
forcibly acting as your wife.

1554
02:10:10,368 --> 02:10:13,367
But today l?m
very happy, on seeing..

1555
02:10:14,367 --> 02:10:17,366
..that you've succeeded
in your ambition in life.

1556
02:10:17,366 --> 02:10:19,365
Your ambition has been
fulfilled. But due to me..

1557
02:10:20,365 --> 02:10:22,364
,,you had to face
too many problems.

1558
02:10:23,363 --> 02:10:26,362
For that, l beg
your forgiveness.

1559
02:10:27,363 --> 02:10:30,362
No, Urvashi. You've
given me any trouble.

1560
02:10:30,362 --> 02:10:33,360
You've given good sense
to a stupid person like me,

1561
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:39,358
You?re not my fan from today,
you?re my wife. You?re my life.

1562
02:10:40,359 --> 02:10:44,357
in front of this God,
accept you. -

1563
02:10:58,353 --> 02:11:01,352
Daddy! - Silent! Shameless!
Loose girl! Before..

1564
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:06,350
..crossing the limits of
the house, why didn't you die?

1565
02:11:06,350 --> 02:11:10,349
Daddy, l.. ? Silent!
Speak in a low voice, or

1566
02:11:10,349 --> 02:11:12,348
l?ll snatch your tongue.

1567
02:11:12,348 --> 02:11:14,348
Firstly, without
any marriage, you..

1568
02:11:14,348 --> 02:11:16,346
..stayed as the
fake wife of a rogue.

1569
02:11:16,346 --> 02:11:19,345
Also wore a fake
symbol of the marriage too?

1570
02:11:19,345 --> 02:11:21,345
You have turned the
father?s dignity into mud..

1571
02:11:21,345 --> 02:11:22,345
..and on top of that,
you?re showing me your eyes?

1572
02:11:23,344 --> 02:11:26,343
l?ll shatter your eyes and
make you blind, understand that.

1573
02:11:28,343 --> 02:11:32,341
The people who would
shatter the eyes are dead.

1574
02:11:32,341 --> 02:11:34,341
This is my
brother?s daughter understood?

1575
02:11:34,341 --> 02:11:37,340
Sampat is alive as yet.
Let anyone just..

1576
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:40,339
?touch my child and see. l?ll
uproot the hands like dry grass.

1577
02:11:40,339 --> 02:11:43,337
Sampat! ? Lower your
eyes and speak in a low tone.

1578
02:11:44,338 --> 02:11:48,336
if l start shouting, then
how the glass cylinder bursts..

1579
02:11:48,336 --> 02:11:51,336
..just like that the cylinder
of your fake dignity will be burst.

1580
02:11:53,334 --> 02:11:58,333
Uncle! ? hey,
why are you crying.

1581
02:11:58,333 --> 02:12:01,332
Your father is a very
cheap man. Why are you wasting..

1582
02:12:01,332 --> 02:12:02,332
..your precious
tears for that cheap man?

1583
02:12:03,331 --> 02:12:06,330
And your uncle is
alive yet. He has uprooted..

1584
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:08,330
..the pillars of so
many people. What is this ..

1585
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:09,329
..without wall poster
do to us, don?t cry. Come.

1586
02:12:11,329 --> 02:12:15,328
Yes, so what were you
saying to my brothers? daughter?

1587
02:12:16,327 --> 02:12:18,327
That you?re her father?
With what right..

1588
02:12:18,327 --> 02:12:20,325
..do you say that
she is your daughter?

1589
02:12:20,325 --> 02:12:22,325
What have you
given her till today?

1590
02:12:23,325 --> 02:12:26,324
Love, respect, did
you give her anything?

1591
02:12:27,324 --> 02:12:30,322
Just like a cow's kid,
you've given her to servants..

1592
02:12:30,322 --> 02:12:32,322
..and you yourself have
been accumulating notes.

1593
02:12:32,322 --> 02:12:34,322
You've been a leader to
fool the innocent people.

1594
02:12:34,322 --> 02:12:36,320
And have played the
political strategies.

1595
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,320
Did you sit with her
for even a day and ask..

1596
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,319
..Daughter, what is your
problem, why are you sad?

1597
02:12:40,319 --> 02:12:45,318
What problem? l never gave
her a chance to ask anything.

1598
02:12:45,318 --> 02:12:47,318
Even before she asked,
l fulfilled all her needs.

1599
02:12:47,318 --> 02:12:50,316
Food, drinks, money,
valuables, what didn't l give her?

1600
02:12:50,316 --> 02:12:52,316
See, in the
orphanages of America..

1601
02:12:52,316 --> 02:12:54,315
..the children
there get more than this.

1602
02:12:54,315 --> 02:12:57,314
So the trustees don?t
become their parents.

1603
02:12:57,314 --> 02:12:59,313
Just as this woman
can't become his wife..

1604
02:12:59,313 --> 02:13:01,313
..by wearing his
symbol of marriage..

1605
02:13:01,313 --> 02:13:04,312
..just like that, you can't
become her father by feeding her.

1606
02:13:04,312 --> 02:13:07,311
A father is that person who gives
his kids the morsel of advice.

1607
02:13:07,311 --> 02:13:09,310
A father is one
who gives his kids..

1608
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:11,310
..the treasure of love
from his mind? safe of honesty.

1609
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,309
What have you given her?

1610
02:13:12,309 --> 02:13:16,308
Sampat, l haven?t come
here to take your advice.

1611
02:13:16,308 --> 02:13:19,307
Even l don?t want to ruin
my advice by giving it to you.

1612
02:13:19,307 --> 02:13:21,306
l ask you just one thing.

1613
02:13:21,306 --> 02:13:23,305
When this girl loves him,
why have you come..

1614
02:13:23,305 --> 02:13:25,305
..here to meddle your scary leg?

1615
02:13:25,305 --> 02:13:31,303
Mr. Sampat. Please let me
speak. l?ll tell father in law.

1616
02:13:32,303 --> 02:13:34,302
Don?t you dare call
me your father in law!

1617
02:13:34,302 --> 02:13:38,301
Yes, call me smaller
father in law and answer him.

1618
02:13:38,301 --> 02:13:40,300
There, not me.

1619
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:47,297
l love your girl. l really
love her, and she loves me too.

1620
02:13:49,297 --> 02:13:54,296
l?m poor. l can't
give you big promises..

1621
02:13:54,296 --> 02:13:58,294
..but l can promise you that
l will keep your daughter happy.

1622
02:13:59,294 --> 02:14:02,293
All we need is your permission.
Because it is..

1623
02:14:02,293 --> 02:14:06,291
..our duty to marry
according to your permission.

1624
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:12,290
l request you, and beg
you for your permission.

1625
02:14:13,289 --> 02:14:17,288
See, this is
honesty , true lovers.

1626
02:14:17,288 --> 02:14:19,287
You?re not worth to
be asked permission..

1627
02:14:19,287 --> 02:14:21,287
..but even then, he is
asking for your permission.

1628
02:14:21,287 --> 02:14:23,286
Otherwise, as it is
they are half tied in the..

1629
02:14:23,286 --> 02:14:25,286
..bonds of marriage in
the eyes of the world..

1630
02:14:25,286 --> 02:14:26,285
..the other half will
be tied by me. After that..

1631
02:14:26,285 --> 02:14:28,285
..you will be the grandfather
of the child that is born..

1632
02:14:28,285 --> 02:14:29,284
..but l will be
called as his grandfather.

1633
02:14:29,284 --> 02:14:32,283
Don?t talk rubbish,
Sampat. How do l permit?

1634
02:14:32,283 --> 02:14:36,282
How do l knowingly push my
daughter in the fire of hunger?

1635
02:14:36,282 --> 02:14:39,281
What is his worth? ls
he worth my daughter?

1636
02:14:39,281 --> 02:14:44,280
Why is he worth your daughter?
ls he blind, lame or a beggar?

1637
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:47,278
He is a very strong and
healthy man. He is famous singer.

1638
02:14:47,278 --> 02:14:49,278
He is the star who will
shine in art?s sky tomorrow.

1639
02:14:49,278 --> 02:14:52,277
l?m not talking about tomorrow.
l?m talking about today.

1640
02:14:52,277 --> 02:14:55,276
What does he have?
First of all he is orphan.

1641
02:14:55,276 --> 02:14:58,275
He has a common
government job, with a salary.

1642
02:14:58,275 --> 02:14:59,274
He doesn't even
have a house to stay.

1643
02:14:59,274 --> 02:15:02,274
Where will he keep my daughter?
- On the foot path? ? No.

1644
02:15:02,274 --> 02:15:05,273
Mother? - When this
mother?s huge house is present..

1645
02:15:05,273 --> 02:15:07,271
..why will he
stay on the foot path?

1646
02:15:08,272 --> 02:15:10,271
Mother? - Yes. Mother

1647
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:17,268
l am alone in
this world. l've none else left.

1648
02:15:19,268 --> 02:15:23,266
Therefore,
accepting Ravi as my son..

1649
02:15:23,266 --> 02:15:26,266
..l?m naming my house,
wealth and bank balance to Ravi.

1650
02:15:28,265 --> 02:15:32,264
Therefore, he
isn't a beggar any more.

1651
02:15:32,264 --> 02:15:34,263
He is rich, and he is
dignified, did you understand?

1652
02:15:35,263 --> 02:15:37,262
Did you understand or not, or
should l make you understand?

1653
02:15:38,262 --> 02:15:44,259
Whether he agrees or not,
they will be married.

1654
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:50,258
They are mature adults, Nobody
can stop them from marrying.

1655
02:15:53,257 --> 02:15:58,256
Okay, it will happen as you wish.
l am agreeable to this marriage.

1656
02:15:59,255 --> 02:16:01,255
Are you telling the truth,
or are you looking..

1657
02:16:01,255 --> 02:16:02,254
..at the chance and
chancing your party?

1658
02:16:02,254 --> 02:16:05,253
No, l?m telling the truth,
Where the daughter agrees..

1659
02:16:05,253 --> 02:16:07,252
..there the father agrees too.

1660
02:16:08,252 --> 02:16:11,252
And as Lilavati
has said correctly.

1661
02:16:11,252 --> 02:16:13,250
Where do you get such
a boy in today?s world.

1662
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:17,249
See, l have a sincere request.
The marriage..

1663
02:16:17,249 --> 02:16:20,248
..should take place at my place.

1664
02:16:20,248 --> 02:16:22,248
if this marriage
takes place at my place..

1665
02:16:22,248 --> 02:16:24,246
..then my dignity will
be restored. Otherwise..

1666
02:16:24,246 --> 02:16:26,246
..the world will say
that the daughter married..

1667
02:16:26,246 --> 02:16:27,246
..against her father?s wishes.

1668
02:16:28,246 --> 02:16:32,244
l agree, what do
you say Sampat? - Okay.

1669
02:16:32,244 --> 02:16:36,243
Okay. l?ll find an auspicious
occasion and inform you.

1670
02:16:36,243 --> 02:16:38,243
Come them daughter,
let us go home..

1671
02:16:38,243 --> 02:16:40,241
..and make
preparations for the marriage.

1672
02:16:41,242 --> 02:16:44,240
Brother Sampat, for
the first time in life..

1673
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,240
..you did a good
thing by opening my eyes.

1674
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:49,239
l've always done good things,
what can l do if you understood..

1675
02:16:49,239 --> 02:16:52,238
..it for the first time?
l?ll leave you till the car

1676
02:16:52,238 --> 02:16:54,237
Okay, mother, l?ll leave now.

1677
02:16:54,237 --> 02:16:56,236
Okay. ? Okay. ? Come now!

1678
02:16:58,236 --> 02:17:02,235
Urvashi! ? Let me go!
-What is this dad?

1679
02:17:02,235 --> 02:17:06,233
Silence! l acted sincerely
there and brought you here.

1680
02:17:07,233 --> 02:17:09,232
Otherwise, how can l
accept defeat so easily?

1681
02:17:09,232 --> 02:17:12,232
l?ll allow your marriage to
that two bit worth boy? Never!

1682
02:17:13,231 --> 02:17:16,230
Listen to this. if you marry,
you will marry only this boy.

1683
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:18,230
Otherwise, you?ll not
marry anyone. Understood?

1684
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:21,228
Never daddy. l have
accepted Ravi as my husband..

1685
02:17:21,228 --> 02:17:24,227
..through my heart. if l marry,
l?ll marry Ravi, or nobody else!

1686
02:17:24,227 --> 02:17:26,227
No, Urvashi, please
don?t say like this.

1687
02:17:27,226 --> 02:17:30,225
Today is our marriage; the
invitation cards've been distributed.

1688
02:17:30,225 --> 02:17:34,224
Shut up. l?ll die but
l will not marry you.

1689
02:17:35,224 --> 02:17:37,223
l just have to marry you off.
Do whatever you want after that.

1690
02:17:38,223 --> 02:17:42,222
Please, let our
families be united.

1691
02:17:43,221 --> 02:17:45,221
Shameless, how dare
you raise your hand..

1692
02:17:45,221 --> 02:17:47,220
..on your would be husband?

1693
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:50,219
Come! Come with me!
- Father!

1694
02:17:51,218 --> 02:17:53,218
Come, dare you move from here!

1695
02:18:04,214 --> 02:18:05,215
Hello!

1696
02:18:06,214 --> 02:18:09,213
Ravi. Urvashi here. - Urvashi!

1697
02:18:10,212 --> 02:18:13,212
He has brought me here forcibly.
That was his entire trick.

1698
02:18:14,211 --> 02:18:17,210
He is marrying me off
to another boy today.

1699
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:19,210
You come..

1700
02:18:20,209 --> 02:18:22,209
Hello!

1701
02:18:33,205 --> 02:18:37,204
Listen, Ravi has come
to know about the wedding.

1702
02:18:38,204 --> 02:18:40,203
He will try to reach
here under any circumstances.

1703
02:18:41,202 --> 02:18:42,202
But you don?t
let him reach here.

1704
02:18:43,202 --> 02:18:46,201
Send your boys on all the sides.
if he tries to come even then..

1705
02:18:46,201 --> 02:18:48,200
..then kill him.

1706
02:22:53,121 --> 02:22:55,120
Priest, do it fast.
Please hurry.

1707
02:23:13,115 --> 02:23:16,114
Now, stand up for the rounds.

1708
02:23:35,107 --> 02:23:38,106
Chandu, finish off this rogue!

1709
02:24:51,083 --> 02:24:55,081
if any one moves, l?ll kill him!

1710
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,080
Urvashi!

1711
02:25:17,074 --> 02:25:21,073
Priest, read the hymns.

1712
02:25:58,061 --> 02:26:00,061
Wait, or else l?ll kill you.

1713
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:04,059
Kill him, what else can you do?

1714
02:26:04,059 --> 02:26:05,058
After the election,
you kill promises made..

1715
02:26:06,058 --> 02:26:07,058
..and the rights
of the poor people..

1716
02:26:08,058 --> 02:26:10,057
..and after marriage,
kill your son in law.

1717
02:26:10,057 --> 02:26:12,056
Son in law! What
nonsense are you talking?

1718
02:26:12,056 --> 02:26:15,055
l?m not talking nonsense, but
announcing it for your benefit.

1719
02:26:15,055 --> 02:26:18,054
See there. He has
just made your daughter..

1720
02:26:19,054 --> 02:26:20,054
..his wife, and you
want to shoot him..

1721
02:26:21,054 --> 02:26:23,053
..and make your
daughter a widow?

1722
02:26:23,053 --> 02:26:25,052
l..l don?t believe
in such a marriage.

1723
02:26:26,051 --> 02:26:28,051
What will your belief
or non belief harm now?

1724
02:26:28,051 --> 02:26:30,051
But, in my eyes, he
is not her husband.

1725
02:26:30,051 --> 02:26:32,050
But in the eyes of the religion,
he is, in the eyes of society..

1726
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:34,049
..he is, he is in
the eyes of the law.

1727
02:26:34,049 --> 02:26:35,049
This is not a political post,
that you sit on it..

1728
02:26:36,048 --> 02:26:38,048
..whenever you want, and
get up whenever you want.

1729
02:26:38,048 --> 02:26:40,048
This is the seat of
an Indian girl?s fate.

1730
02:26:40,048 --> 02:26:43,047
Whoever she allows
to sit there once..

1731
02:26:44,046 --> 02:26:46,045
..he becomes her God. And you
have no right to shoot her God.

1732
02:26:47,045 --> 02:26:52,043
Go, my blessings are with you,
Gods blessings are with you.

1733
02:26:52,043 --> 02:26:56,042
What will this person
stop you? Go, l?ll see.

1734
02:27:05,039 --> 02:27:07,039
Shoot! Why don?t you shoot?

1735
02:27:08,038 --> 02:27:10,038
Till when will you see
the world the eyes of money?

1736
02:27:11,037 --> 02:27:16,035
if you have the eyes of
your heart, then see there.

1737
02:27:18,035 --> 02:27:20,035
Love and see!
