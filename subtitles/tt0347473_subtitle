1
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,572
Can we hope for the same gesture
of humanity from Pakistan?

2
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:42,379
I can't speak to the Indian Army
General like this...

3
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,619
let's simplify it...
- Sir, General Bakshi has arrived!

4
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,855
Already?
- Should I ask him to go back?

5
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,179
Cameras off! No cameras
before the show begins

6
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,516
Are you in charge here?
- Yes sir!

7
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:13,527
Not anymore!
I'm Brigadier Shekhar Sharma.

8
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:15,728
The General's security
is my responsibility

9
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,566
Any problems with that?
- Not at all sir!

10
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,870
Good!

11
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,563
Capt. Vikram, Major Abbas...
over there

12
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:24,042
Major Karan, in position.

13
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,043
Come with me

14
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,449
Sir, security camera is in position.
- Good!

15
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,294
All positions secured?
- Yes sir. All positions secured

16
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,496
Good. Let the show begin

17
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,601
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to 'People's Voice'

18
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:48,005
I'm your host, Rajat Saxena
and today's issue is:

19
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:55,046
Project Milaap (Unity), a historic
step or a historic mistake?

20
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:03,164
The dawn of 15th of August,
our Independence Day...

21
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:08,531
will see 50 Pakistani prisoners
in Indian custody released...

22
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:10,871
at the Indian border

23
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:16,344
Let's meet the man
behind Project Milaap

24
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,786
Please welcome General
Amar Singh Bakshi...

25
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,455
the Commander in Chief
of the Indian Army

26
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,937
We'd first like to
congratulate you sir, because...

27
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:41,215
the Parliament actually agreed
to Project Milaap this very morning!

28
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:48,455
General Bakshi, do you really
believe that Project Milaap...

29
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,062
will lead to friendship
between India and Pakistan?

30
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:56,564
It's not so simple.
A chasm of fifty five years...

31
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:59,835
cannot be bridged
by releasing fifty prisoners

32
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,210
Then why Project Milaap?
- It's a step... towards crossing the chasm.

33
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,457
- So according to you they are all innocent!
- Station 3, come in. Over.

34
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,885
- Station 3 secure, sir.
- Good.

35
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:14,086
None of them are terrorists
or ISI agents?

36
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:17,964
If we had a shred of doubt that
they are dangerous to India...

37
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,836
we would never have
taken this step

38
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,841
Most of them
are poor villagers...

39
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,512
who didn't even know
they had crossed the border

40
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:32,080
After all the border is not
completely sealed

41
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,988
They didn't even have weapons...

42
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:39,925
yet they have been in our prisons
for years... some since 1971

43
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:45,804
We feel it's time to
send them back home

44
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,977
But not everyone agrees
with you General

45
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:54,947
Some even want to stop you

46
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:59,789
Everyone has the right to
free speech in a democracy!

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,492
But some people
don't want to merely speak

48
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,197
Sir, I'm talking about Raghavan

49
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,909
The people would like to know
who Raghavan is...

50
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:17,744
and is it true that
he has sworn to stop Project Milaap?

51
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:24,185
Raghavan is a mask. He hides
his face because of his shame

52
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:28,230
He's a coward - a terrorist...

53
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:31,736
so used to violence
that he now fears peace

54
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:34,472
Project Milaap
will be successful

55
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:39,870
The prisoners will certainly be
released on the dawn of 15th August

56
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,951
Damn! Back up!
We need back up immediately

57
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:19,770
Come in

58
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,071
Major Ram reporting, sir!
I'm outside the studio

59
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:26,943
Maj. Ram, hold position for
two minutes! Back up is arriving

60
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,475
It's too late, sir.
I'm going in

61
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,070
Hello General. I'm Raghavan.
I'll ask you the remaining questions

62
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:56,915
So General, I'm sure Pakistan is also
releasing our poor villagers, right?

63
00:07:57,257 --> 00:08:00,618
Exactly what
I was going to ask him!

64
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:06,029
When elders speak,
learn to shut up!

65
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:16,308
So General, what about
Pakistan's show of good will?

66
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:20,015
We haven't heard anything
from Pakistan yet

67
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:23,152
Then why are we being
so damn foolish?

68
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:26,056
Because someone has to
take the first step

69
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:30,326
If we all behave like you,
there will never be peace

70
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:34,832
We've thought about this a lot

71
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,406
And we are certain
that Pakistan will reciprocate

72
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:43,051
Pakistan! Pakistan is going
to laugh at us...

73
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,356
because they don't want peace.
- Why?

74
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,261
Don't the Pakistanis
love their children?

75
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:56,031
You do, General!
You love your daughter a lot

76
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,650
Too bad!

77
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:10,288
She will really miss you, General

78
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,792
No one can save you now

79
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,292
Ram!

80
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,140
Easy. Easy now.
You'll be all right, Sharma

81
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,711
Ambulance is on the way

82
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,147
I want to speak to my son

83
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,159
Ram...

84
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:55,202
Father...

85
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,068
Ram...
- Father...

86
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Please...

87
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,106
Was I a good father?
- Yes father, but right now...

88
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,685
No, tell me!

89
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:58,017
You're the best father
in the whole world

90
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:01,185
I'm guilty son!
- No, father

91
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:04,131
Ram, listen please!

92
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,935
There's something
I've always hidden from you

93
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,911
You...

94
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:26,351
You're not my only son

95
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:45,221
I have a wife, Madhu

96
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,322
And a son, Lakshman...

97
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:54,560
your step... your brother!

98
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:58,806
Who I haven't seen
for twenty years

99
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:14,955
It's been twenty years
since she left me

100
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:21,228
Twenty years I have lived
away from them

101
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:27,037
It's time I pay for my deeds.
- Don't say this father

102
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,220
I knew you'll forgive me Ram.
Your heart is big

103
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,330
But until she forgives me
I will not find peace

104
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:51,041
My family will remain broken...
scattered

105
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:57,217
Promise me Ram, that you will
not immerse my ashes alone...

106
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,754
Promise me that both my sons will
do my last rites

107
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,108
Where is father's family?

108
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:39,172
Son, they left
nineteen years back...

109
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:45,418
Because I came here, right?

110
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,140
Dear Shekhar, I know you consider
what happened between us...

111
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:56,035
ten years back
a big mistake

112
00:16:56,508 --> 00:17:01,608
I stayed away from you as I knew
how much you loved your wife

113
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,946
But today I'm helpless

114
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:09,386
By the time you get this letter
I may not be alive

115
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:14,057
I leave our son in your care

116
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:19,798
Please look after him.
He is your son, too

117
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,406
What's your name, son?
- Ram Sharma, sir!

118
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,221
Madhu... please

119
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:36,392
It was just a mistake

120
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,130
It was just a mistake.
- Mistake?

121
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,501
After marriage
it's called Infidelity, Shekhar

122
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm leaving. I can't live
with this lie anymore

123
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:52,043
Lie? Are you calling
our marriage, our son a lie?

124
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,183
And what about the one
who is sitting outside...

125
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,822
your illegitimate son?

126
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,727
He's a truth too

127
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:05,359
And if he enters the house,
I am leaving

128
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:09,037
Where will he go?
It's not his fault

129
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:12,137
You're right Shekhar.
It's not his fault

130
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:15,844
It's my fault
for having trusted you

131
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,526
For my sake...

132
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:52,130
because of me, father
stayed away from his family

133
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:59,474
I will bring them home

134
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:05,312
They won't come home, son,
not till you're here

135
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:14,128
You can't go anywhere
at this stage, Ram

136
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:17,501
I need you till 15th August.
- I know, sir

137
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:21,166
But I made a promise
to my father

138
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:26,574
Then go ahead.
Project Milaap was his dream too

139
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:32,185
Ram, this is the photograph
Raghavan gave me

140
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:36,326
It's my daughter Sanjana,
in her college in Darjeeling

141
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:39,095
This picture was taken
from her college

142
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,866
A gun can reach where a camera can.
And it's my worst fear

143
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:47,065
Sir, why don't you call her back?
- Because she won't agree

144
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,074
Even if her life's in danger?
- You don't know my daughter, Ram

145
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:55,248
I haven't seen her
for two years

146
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,688
She hates me

147
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:05,696
Of course, it's my fault entirely.
I never let her come close to me

148
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:12,003
I wanted a son. A son,
who would join the army like me

149
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,049
That's why I never loved her...

150
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,421
like I would've loved my son

151
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,522
I was wrong.

152
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:28,164
Today I can give anything
to catch her glimpse...

153
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,534
but she won't let me

154
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:34,603
Sir, can we not send a 24 hour
Protection Team for her surveillance?

155
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:37,902
Sanjana will never let anyone
in a uniform come close to her

156
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:43,247
If anyone does, she will run away
...she's done it before

157
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:47,618
So what do you recommend sir?
- I want you...

158
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:52,127
to go to Darjeeling,
under cover to protect Sanjana

159
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,234
I don't trust anyone else
- Sir, I...

160
00:20:56,604 --> 00:21:01,504
I'm sorry, sir. It's impossible for me
to go to Darjeeling right now

161
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,780
I thought you may be interested
in this mission...

162
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:12,136
as there's another student
studying there - Lakshman Sharma.

163
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:19,013
Your father and I've been friends
for 25 years. I know everything

164
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,695
Call it fate or co-incidence...

165
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:26,031
but his wife Madhu and
his son Lakshman live in Darjeeling

166
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:29,639
You are now officially on leave
till 15th August

167
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,243
I've already spoken
to the Principal of St. Paul's

168
00:21:32,244 --> 00:21:35,244
You are joining the college
from Monday

169
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:38,499
And what subject
will I teach there?

170
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,689
You are not going there as a teacher
...you will be a student

171
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,863
I'll look really strange
as a student, sir

172
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:49,368
I think I'm better off as a teacher.
- You can't stay with Sanjana...

173
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,136
all the time as a teacher.
- But I just don't look like a student

174
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:56,175
Besides, it's been ages since I
attended the national Defence College

175
00:21:56,176 --> 00:22:01,417
Don't worry. Even the principal
will say that you are there...

176
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,686
to complete your graduation
which was left incomplete

177
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:07,482
But sir, the current generation?
I've never even seen a civil college

178
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,022
I'll be caught in a day!
- Ram, no matter what...

179
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,166
Project Milaap cannot stop!

180
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,167
Those prisoners have to be released
on 15th August

181
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,175
But Sanjana's safety?
- Sir...

182
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:23,176
No harm will come to Sanjana

183
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:26,681
I promise you, sir.
- Thank you, Major

184
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:12,140
"Like the winds sigh..."

185
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:16,146
"and the birds fly..."

186
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:20,350
"like the bumble bee's affair..."

187
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:24,155
"I roam without a care"

188
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:36,174
"I'm the queen of hearts!
What sadness is, I know not"

189
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,615
"With no fear,
I do and I defy"

190
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:48,256
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."

191
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:19,764
"They can halt, they can try,
they can stop and ask me why..."

192
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:22,974
"but do I listen,
oh no, not l"

193
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:27,178
"I'm stubborn,
I'm crazy..."

194
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:30,687
"They say my mind is hazy..."

195
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:38,531
"but no one knows
where my dreams lie"

196
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:46,206
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."

197
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:54,214
"Like the bumble bee's affair,
I roam without a care"

198
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,164
"I'm the queen of hearts,
What sadness is, I know not"

199
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,601
"With no fear,
I do and I defy"

200
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:18,102
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."

201
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,030
It's odd, I've never seen my brother,
I've no clue what he looks like

202
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:35,806
But I'm certain
his eyes will be like mine

203
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:44,624
Actually I think he'd be
exactly like me...

204
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,325
calm, shy, decent, disciplined

205
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,742
And my heart says I will
recognize him instantly...

206
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:02,846
my little Lakshman

207
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,896
"Let the nymphets
come to lure me"

208
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:20,871
"And know that I'm no worker bee"

209
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:25,071
"For when I look into their eyes,
I'll steal their hearts, their minds"

210
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:28,315
"No matter how gorgeous..."

211
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:36,189
"they'll be mine
without a fuss"

212
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:39,923
"Like the winds sigh..."

213
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:44,102
"and the birds fly..."

214
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:48,034
"Like the bumble bee's affair..."

215
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,273
"I roam without a care"

216
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:04,023
"I may be mad, a little strange,
and wilder than most..."

217
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:07,669
"but the most lovable,
am everybody's toast"

218
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:11,508
"Like the winds sigh..."

219
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:15,409
"and the birds fly..."

220
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:19,314
"Like the bumble bee's affair..."

221
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:23,319
"I roam without a care"

222
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,120
"Like the winds sigh..."

223
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:31,221
"and the birds fly..."

224
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:58,837
Friends, it's a truly blessed day
as today we have amongst us...

225
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:02,347
the famous student
of St. Paul's - Lucky!

226
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:08,755
When I came to this college
four years back, Lucky was my senior

227
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,087
When we first got here,
Lucky ragged us a lot, didn't he?

228
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:18,002
In the canteen, he stripped me and
made me sing 'My heart will go on... '

229
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,277
He's so smooth, so charming,
smooth and perky

230
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:24,347
We wanna be as cool as Lucky!

231
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:26,416
I love Lucky!

232
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:30,683
Despite having failed his class
thrice, Lucky is still with us

233
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:34,256
And God willing,
Lucky may fail again...

234
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:37,293
and bless our juniors
with his presence too

235
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,299
And now, here's Lucky.

236
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,377
Yes, it wasn't easy!

237
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:50,378
To fail thrice in a row,
is not an ordinary feat!

238
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:56,781
But friends, with hard work,
perseverance and dedication...

239
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,159
you can all get here

240
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:06,026
And if I have your blessings,
I will continue to be with you...

241
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:10,671
right here, in this college,
for eons to come

242
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,578
That's a promise

243
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,829
Don't you feel any shame?
- Shame, Sanju?

244
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:30,061
Just look at these faces,
full of love, respect

245
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,807
And I won't need to study
this year as well

246
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:37,639
I've got you to copy from!
- Yeah, right

247
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:40,653
Irritating!
- Sanju...

248
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,183
Lucky, is Sanju your girlfriend?
- Avoid, man!

249
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:48,159
When Lucky has a girlfriend,
the whole college will turn to her

250
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:51,957
Who wants to look at Sanju?
- Hey, I only look at Sanju

251
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:55,835
Do you think she'll be my girlfriend?
- Are you?

252
00:29:55,908 --> 00:30:02,003
Oh yes. Why not? What a face!
What muscles!

253
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,685
What style!
- Oh stop!

254
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:06,721
You're perfect!
- I know

255
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:11,524
I have an idea! Let's arm wrestle.
I'll beat you and impress Sanju, okay?

256
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:14,829
Meet me outside

257
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,517
Stop it. You'll hurt yourself, Percy.
- Pain's my middle name, Sanju!

258
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,588
You think you look cool smoking?
- Yeah, yeah

259
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,789
Please! Give it to me.
- Avoid, Sanju!

260
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,998
Hi Mini.
- Hi sweetheart

261
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,936
Where's your miserable boyfriend?

262
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,438
Right here!

263
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:42,141
Quit playing with fleas!
Wanna fight a man for a change?

264
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:46,245
Would love to fight with a man.
But I don't mind fighting you either!

265
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:49,353
Who are you calling a flea?
- Scram!

266
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:53,258
The loser gets punished!
- And Mini will kiss the winner

267
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,261
Have you gone mad, Sanju?
- What'd I do?

268
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:22,262
You lost, Lucky!
- Time for punishment!

269
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:25,266
Whoever walks in first
through that gate...

270
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,270
push the person
and make him fall down. Simple

271
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:31,342
Hey what if it's a teacher?

272
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:35,815
Or the principal?

273
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,952
Whatever... man!

274
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,957
It's the principal!

275
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:51,403
Scared, Lucky?

276
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,458
Come here! Where was I going?

277
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:10,597
Home, sir!

278
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:53,559
Hi.
- Hello

279
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,330
Can you tell me
where's the principal's office?

280
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:59,331
First floor,
third door to the left!

281
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:02,334
Thank you.
- You're welcome

282
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,981
Sorry man, it was a bet!

283
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:18,288
What's your name?
- Wanna complain to the principal?

284
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:21,627
Avoid being a pain!

285
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,302
I asked you what your name is

286
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:32,640
Okay uncle, if you don't like
your face I can change it for you!

287
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:43,124
C'mon! You think you are tough?
C'mon let's fight, uncle

288
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:49,432
C'mon, let's go man

289
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,505
Is he our new Chemistry prof?
- What? Oh God, Lucky!

290
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:57,278
C'mon man, you are mine!
- I'm sorry

291
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,279
Behave yourself!
We were just playing a game

292
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:04,890
Lucky, say sorry. C'mon!
- Sorry

293
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,358
It's okay

294
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,430
Can you take me to
the principal's office? I'm new here

295
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:12,100
Hey, did I not say first floor,
third door to the left?

296
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:15,101
He's deaf too! Come on, Sanju.
- Excuse me, Sanju

297
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,305
Hello. I'm Ram

298
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:21,409
And I'm Lucky.
Now beat it

299
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:28,221
Tough guy!

300
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:37,332
Mrs Kakkad!

301
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:42,773
I'm going to fail them all!

302
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,346
Uncle, leave my hand,
grab it later!

303
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:47,849
I'm off, bye!
- The hag bores us to death

304
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,485
Shameless!
What are you up to?

305
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:53,486
Lemme go, uncle!

306
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,752
Hi handsome! Are you
the new Chemistry teacher?

307
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,069
No... I'm a student.
- Student?

308
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,070
I could just die!
I'm Mrs Kakkad, the Hindi teacher!

309
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,974
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning

310
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,975
Meet me in the back side
when my period is empty!

311
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:12,316
I'll teach you everything

312
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:15,317
Oh! Such strong muscles!

313
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,324
What?
- She means you have strong muscles!

314
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,325
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mention not

315
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,457
Finally I've found an oasis!

316
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:27,338
Very good ma'am! Excuse me!
- Sure

317
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:30,339
Everything is "squeezed" for you

318
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:33,408
Excuse me, sir

319
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,350
Major Ram Prasad Sharma, sir!
General Bakshi may have spoken to you

320
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:41,424
Of course. Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

321
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:44,425
Lieutenant Ram, right?
- Major Ram, sir

322
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:50,824
What can I do for you, General?
- Not General. Major

323
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:55,874
Look, no one except you know that
I'm not a student here

324
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:59,412
So no saluting!
- Right

325
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:02,683
No saluting

326
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,855
The thing is Captain...
please sit down

327
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:09,194
I had really wanted to join the army.
But I couldn't remember the ranks

328
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,564
So, what can I do
for my country, Sergeant?

329
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:19,005
Okay!

330
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,210
I'd like to be
in Sanjana Bakshi's class

331
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,651
Done! What else, Wing Commander?

332
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:29,152
And please stop saluting every second.
- Top secret, I know!

333
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,659
May I leave, sir?
- Bye, Cadet Ram!

334
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,976
Don't salute, please.
- Top secret

335
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:45,578
Sir, there is a student in
your college. Lakshman Prasad Sharma

336
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,579
Do you know him?

337
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:52,050
Just a distant relative!
You must know him

338
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:56,121
No, I don't.
I can't even remember names

339
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:02,491
Don't worry. Go to the ID office
at 9:30 sharp

340
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,837
You'll get all the information.
Okay? All the best

341
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,140
Over and out.
Tango and Cash!

342
00:37:09,346 --> 00:37:12,646
Each man for himself!
- Okay!

343
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:23,428
Roger!
- Major, sir

344
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:26,899
Come on, Comrade

345
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,243
"Oh brother! Where art thou?"

346
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:59,014
"My dear..."

347
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:02,015
"I look for you..."

348
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:05,587
"night and day..."

349
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,825
"in every way"

350
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,632
"My dear..."

351
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:15,833
"I look for you"

352
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:19,371
"night and day..."

353
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,510
"in every way"

354
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,980
"Call me..."

355
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:29,387
"show me where
you're hiding"

356
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:35,958
- "Where are you?" (2x)
- "I'm here feeling blue" (2x)

357
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,133
What do you say, Bro?

358
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:50,034
"My dear, I look for you,
night and day, in every way"

359
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:56,940
"Call me,
show me where you're hiding"

360
00:38:56,941 --> 00:39:04,335
- "Where are you?" (2x)
- "I'm here feeling blue" (2x)

361
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,060
Hello.
May I sit with you?

362
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:26,401
You, here?
- Hello uncle

363
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:29,502
The senior citizen bench is there.
- Shut up

364
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:42,154
What? What are you doing?
Please make yourself comfortable

365
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:44,859
Three years of house-warming
should qualify this as your home

366
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,430
In fact, please consider
this your bedroom

367
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:50,431
Thank you, sir. You're too kind!
- That's me!

368
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,443
Sanju, a round cap today, eh?

369
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,544
I'll get you
a cowboy hat tomorrow, okay?

370
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:03,115
And why are you sitting?
Please lie down

371
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:06,653
In fact, on her lap.
I won't mind, and neither will she

372
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,462
You?

373
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:13,463
Sit, sit

374
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:15,637
You're new?
- Yes sir

375
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:17,938
Then get comfy!
- I'm okay, sir

376
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:21,433
Relax. No, this isn't
a Temple of Knowledge

377
00:40:22,112 --> 00:40:25,112
This is a club.
Am I not right?

378
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:27,251
Please put your feet up.
- No, sir

379
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:30,815
No I insist that you keep
your feet up. Please

380
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,825
Up?
- Please

381
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:36,456
My feet?
- Come on, please!

382
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:40,069
Okay, if you insist, sir.
I'll be fine

383
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,070
How dare you!

384
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,471
How dare you!
I'm going to set you right!

385
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:50,547
But sir?
- Come with me to the principal

386
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:53,852
Follow me. I said, follow me!

387
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:57,461
Sir, if you walk ahead,
I'd be able to

388
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:00,462
Oh! You will teach me, eh?
Come on!

389
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:03,497
And quiet!

390
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,943
And no talking while I'm gone...
It's the principal

391
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,545
I was just coming to you

392
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:13,546
I want to expel this
not-so-young man immediately!

393
00:41:13,817 --> 00:41:16,817
Go to my office and collect
your Leaving Certificate immediately

394
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:20,258
Mr Rasai, there is a new student
in your class. Ram Sharma

395
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:23,259
Sir, I'm Ram Sharma.
- Major!

396
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:26,696
I mean, Majoring in physics.
Follow me

397
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,441
Class! This is
our new student Ram Sharma

398
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:38,477
Ten years back due to
some family responsibilities...

399
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:40,920
he had to abandon his education

400
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:44,321
But now he's back to complete
his graduation

401
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:46,822
We are very proud of you,
my son - Thank you, sir

402
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:49,864
I want you all
to be friends with him

403
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,967
Now who will be his friend?

404
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,475
Sanjana!

405
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,183
I hope she doesn't know
you're shadowing her

406
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:29,184
No, sir. Not at all

407
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:37,528
How is she?

408
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:43,707
What have I done?
- She's different

409
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:47,408
Are you two friends?
- May I? Please?

410
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:52,842
Ram, I don't like being
forced to be friends

411
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,554
OK.
- I choose my own friends

412
00:42:56,726 --> 00:43:02,456
And they are very special. But
you're not. Do you understand?

413
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,740
Are you two friends, Ram?

414
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,728
Not yet. But we will be

415
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,232
There are two commandos
stationed outside the hostel at night

416
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,733
Even my best officer needs sleep.

417
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:23,646
You don't have to worry
with me around, sir

418
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:27,084
Everything is just fine here

419
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,956
And father,
you don't worry too

420
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,125
I'm here now

421
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:40,049
I'll find them,
I'm sure they are close by...

422
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:42,323
near me...

423
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,799
Lucky, did you speak to anyone?
- Yeah. I've put an advertisement...

424
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:49,228
up on the notice board.
We'll find someone real soon

425
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:51,666
Fix the fuse, Lucky!
The lights keep going out

426
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:55,237
Didn't I ask you already?
What about your dinner?

427
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,829
Welcome to Darjeeling, Raghavan

428
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:09,264
It was a choice I had to make
for the sake...

429
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,191
of my little brother's education.
I had to quit college

430
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,597
But I always felt incomplete

431
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:21,596
And one day as I ticked
'undergraduate' in a form...

432
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,241
I decided that as soon
as my brother finishes his studies...

433
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:26,609
I don't want to hear your saga

434
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:29,707
I'm not interested in you
or your brother

435
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:34,608
Fine! Let's talk about you.
Where you from?

436
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:37,112
What does your dad do?

437
00:45:38,613 --> 00:45:41,413
My dad's dead.
Okay?

438
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,727
What's up, Sanju?
- Lucky...

439
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:02,903
Ram has turned into my shadow!
- Who? Our uncle?

440
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:06,568
It's the first time
a guy's after you. Enjoy, baby

441
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:09,902
What are you saying?
- Maybe she wants another guy, Lucky

442
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:15,910
Mini darling.
I'll be back in a blink

443
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:20,042
Hey micro-mini! Watch it

444
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:33,854
Hey Uncle!

445
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,926
Bell Bottoms!

446
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:39,926
Dude...

447
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:45,594
Are you deaf?
- Selectively, yes!

448
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:49,605
What's up, man? Why don't you stick
with people your age?

449
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:53,974
Hang on!
There aren't any here

450
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,101
Is this how you talk to your elders?
- Look Mr Geriatric...

451
00:46:58,414 --> 00:47:01,547
go do what old people do.
Sanju's my friend

452
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:04,877
So stop bugging her, or else...

453
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,884
Else what?

454
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:15,224
For you, I'll shut eyes and count
till ten... not the usual three

455
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,229
And when I open my eyes,
you better have disappeared

456
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:25,567
I think so.
- Thinking's good for you

457
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,568
Where are you running?
Am I a witch?

458
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:45,247
I'm coming... don't go away

459
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,850
Uncle, I hope
you've left for good

460
00:47:57,225 --> 00:48:00,524
That's Sanju!
- You failed again!

461
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,191
Yet again! And this time
you've broken even my record

462
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:07,963
How did you manage
to get 3.5% in Hindi?

463
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:12,127
Tell you what, if you pass this year
I'll give you a "Cadabury"...

464
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:14,537
that too a milky one!
- Come again

465
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:18,262
She means Milk Cadbury.
- Yes, milk one!

466
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:21,871
Sweet boy!
And where's the other one?

467
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:24,211
Student name?
- Lakshman Prasad Sharma

468
00:48:24,578 --> 00:48:26,205
Your name?
- Ram Sharma

469
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,548
Can't give another student's
information to you

470
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:30,882
Just find out if...

471
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:36,883
Want information? We'll take it out
from the college computer...

472
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:39,880
during the lunch break!
Piece of cake

473
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,701
How much longer?
- Almost done, two minutes

474
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,936
This is a race between
Lucky and Vivek

475
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,506
Lucky, who is our favourite

476
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,806
And Vivek, who is a bit angry

477
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,107
So whoever runs upto the roof...

478
00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:22,517
and gets the college flag
for Mini gets a huge...

479
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,850
Are you mad?
I'd just said race!

480
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,525
You guys will be expelled!

481
00:49:32,131 --> 00:49:34,297
Why? Are you scared, Lucky?

482
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,709
Done!

483
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,563
What's going on?
- Sir, a race is on

484
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,906
No one told me it's Sports Day!
Yeah! Race!

485
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:28,208
Lucky!

486
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:33,046
Lucky hold on! I'm coming!
Someone do something

487
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,096
Who's that?

488
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,175
Captain Ram!

489
00:52:04,879 --> 00:52:07,273
I mean, I want to make him
the Captain of the Athletic Team

490
00:52:07,348 --> 00:52:09,944
See how fit he is!
Come on Captain, come on

491
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:19,382
Who is this "Makko" man!
- Macho man, macho

492
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:32,797
Ram turned out to be Rambo!
- Look at him move.

493
00:53:00,755 --> 00:53:02,153
Let go, Lakshman

494
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:05,718
Don't look down. Let go

495
00:53:05,924 --> 00:53:08,484
No! Are you mad?
I'll die if I let go!

496
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:10,861
Give me your hand.
- No...

497
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:13,657
Don't be scared

498
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:16,156
I'm here now

499
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,234
Let go

500
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:18,479
I didn't know you were so fit.
Were you in the army?

501
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:23,142
Hey, stop that!
You're okay now

502
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:27,484
No, no, why do you keep
calling me Lakshman?

503
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:29,481
Because Lakshman your name

504
00:54:31,824 --> 00:54:34,087
But no one knows my real name
in the college

505
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:38,488
It doesn't go with the image!
You will not squeal, okay?

506
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:41,492
Okay. Image!
Stop trembling first

507
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:45,824
And what do you think of my image?
- Your image is set

508
00:54:49,004 --> 00:54:52,164
Idiot! You freaked me out!
Didn't I say it's too dangerous?

509
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:54,637
What 'Okay'?
What if something had happened?

510
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:56,707
You didn't even think about
what your mother would go through

511
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,773
How do you know mom?

512
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:03,443
I don't. I mean...

513
00:55:04,814 --> 00:55:07,783
you must have a mom,
- True. Everybody has a mom

514
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:13,884
Not everyone.
You are very lucky

515
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:19,460
Ram...

516
00:55:21,496 --> 00:55:25,553
The other day I had said that
my friends are special people

517
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,465
Well, you are extremely special

518
00:55:39,608 --> 00:55:40,973
What's that?
- Hey uncle...

519
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:43,068
Okay... come on

520
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,916
Youth! Wonderful thing

521
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:10,762
Isn't it, Khan?
- Yes, sir!

522
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,433
Such joy! Innocence!
Look at this boy

523
00:56:18,471 --> 00:56:21,731
Has he even thought about
his future...

524
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:25,435
its dangers?
How it's rife with enemies?

525
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:28,271
No kid thinks
about these things, Raghavan

526
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:34,215
It's time to send another message
to General Bakshi

527
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,618
Shoot that boy

528
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,819
Shoot him
while Sanjana is around

529
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:42,785
And I want a recording of this!

530
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:48,093
Any problems, Khan?

531
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:52,662
But he's a kid

532
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:59,560
This is war, Khan.
Any war needs sacrifices

533
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:04,735
Our war was for the country
ten years back and still is

534
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:07,172
Remember?

535
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:18,416
We found some villagers
at the border...

536
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:21,241
who claim they got lost searching
for water. They are Pakistanis

537
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:28,514
You know very well that you are
standing on Indian soil

538
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,226
So get ready for a trial!

539
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,199
Are you Pakistani?

540
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:43,126
Don't be afraid. Answer calmly

541
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,903
Are you Pakistani?

542
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:48,172
Yes, sir

543
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:52,105
Trial over

544
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,498
Major Datta, on what basis
did you kill those eleven Pakistanis?

545
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:25,833
They were Pakistani spies!
- All of them?

546
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:28,669
Perhaps.
- Is it possible that...

547
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,267
some of them weren't spies?
- It's possible

548
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:35,138
And it's also possible that none
of them were spies

549
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,068
They were Pakistanis!

550
00:58:53,756 --> 00:58:55,948
I feel ashamed of having ever
called you a friend

551
00:59:13,737 --> 00:59:14,863
Ten years!

552
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:21,038
It's taken me ten years
to create my own army

553
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:30,373
I've handpicked each soldier

554
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:34,787
I never said it would be easy...

555
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:38,178
never claimed victory would come
without losing something

556
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,821
If blood must be shed,
then it must, Khan!

557
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:49,184
It could be ours, the enemies'
or a little boy's. Right Khan?

558
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:49,184
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

559
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:54,286
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

560
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:59,465
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

561
01:01:00,066 --> 01:01:04,566
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

562
01:01:05,138 --> 01:01:09,900
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?

563
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:15,010
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

564
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:20,242
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

565
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:25,583
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

566
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:30,245
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

567
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,382
"When you think,
when you see..."

568
01:02:06,718 --> 01:02:10,976
"how much I love you..."

569
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:13,557
"Don't stay silent"

570
01:02:13,957 --> 01:02:22,519
"Tell me, you have
that special friend..."

571
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:32,924
"who will give you his heart,
give up his soul" (2x)

572
01:02:33,304 --> 01:02:37,773
"And I will say, true,
for I'm here now"

573
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:42,672
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

574
01:02:43,413 --> 01:02:47,938
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

575
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:53,680
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?"

576
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:58,620
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

577
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:03,862
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

578
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:08,796
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

579
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:14,194
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

580
01:03:55,868 --> 01:04:00,098
"If there's something
in your heart..."

581
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:02,771
"tell me"

582
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:07,827
"No matter what time
of day or night..."

583
01:04:08,034 --> 01:04:10,260
"tell me"

584
01:04:11,236 --> 01:04:15,836
"If problems plague you..."

585
01:04:16,274 --> 01:04:20,834
"or you feel down and out..."

586
01:04:21,377 --> 01:04:23,740
"tell me"

587
01:04:24,815 --> 01:04:34,911
"If you have a wish,
a little want..." (2x)

588
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:40,255
"don't ever be apprehensive,
for I'm here now"

589
01:04:40,256 --> 01:04:44,956
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

590
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:50,020
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

591
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:54,791
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?"

592
01:04:55,603 --> 01:05:00,132
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

593
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:05,705
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

594
01:05:06,209 --> 01:05:10,868
"Who are you waiting for?
"I'm here now"

595
01:05:11,312 --> 01:05:15,975
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

596
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:42,395
What is this now?
- The loser must face punishment

597
01:05:42,603 --> 01:05:45,071
No look,
I just lost because...

598
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,406
Sit!

599
01:05:47,774 --> 01:05:49,401
And I sit here till when?

600
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:51,576
Until a girl walks
towards you from there

601
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:54,073
Girl?
- And until you serenade her!

602
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:56,844
Girls, singing...
I've never done that

603
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:01,480
Someone's coming!
- I hope it's not Mrs Kakkad!

604
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:04,011
Sanju! I can't sing

605
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,946
What the hell am I to sing?

606
01:06:08,389 --> 01:06:14,119
"I'm just a little brave
tin soldier, sing with me..."

607
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:18,563
I should have stuck to the army.
I need a fresh new song... yes

608
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:22,355
"Buffalo soldier
...in the heart of..."

609
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,982
I got it!
She's the new Chemistry teacher

610
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,845
Ram, don't sing

611
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,584
No singing...

612
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,414
Swan song baby!

613
01:07:00,628 --> 01:07:02,422
Wow! What a lovely sari

614
01:07:11,968 --> 01:07:15,964
"My heart is the moon"

615
01:07:20,109 --> 01:07:24,036
"You are the moonlight"

616
01:07:24,677 --> 01:07:27,209
Just remembered!
Her name is Chandni (moonlight)

617
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:32,347
"Why is the moonlight..."

618
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:38,777
"so far from the moon?"

619
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:54,561
Is it my imagination?
Or were you just singing to me?

620
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,733
No! 'I'm just
a little tin soldier... '

621
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:07,030
Whatever! Go ahead
and finish the song.

622
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:15,178
"You have no choice..."

623
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:19,313
"but to return to my sphere"

624
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:28,020
"So go where you will,
go my dear"

625
01:08:29,492 --> 01:08:31,423
"Go on, my..."

626
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:34,760
Don't watch!
You won't be able to bear it

627
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:38,331
No way! Such behavior
in this college, I will never bear it

628
01:08:38,764 --> 01:08:40,833
By the way, which song was it?

629
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,996
'My heart is the moon... '
- My favourite!

630
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,003
'You are the moonlight... '
- What song is this?

631
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:52,502
'Why is the moonlight so... '

632
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:58,039
So old, and a student!
Disgusting!

633
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:01,838
So young and a teacher! Amazing!

634
01:09:02,382 --> 01:09:04,883
Colonel, do you know
who her father is?

635
01:09:05,318 --> 01:09:07,545
No. Who, sir?
- How the heck do I know?

636
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:10,947
Admiral, I know she is relevant
to your mission...

637
01:09:11,322 --> 01:09:14,049
No, no...
- But apologize, you must! Go now!

638
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:40,435
A moonlight!
And what am I? An eclipse?

639
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,280
"Makko" man!

640
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:55,621
You?

641
01:09:56,388 --> 01:09:58,913
How dare you enter
the staff room? No...

642
01:09:59,358 --> 01:10:02,985
don't stop me... I will have you
thrown out of the college, get that?

643
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,657
You punk!

644
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:21,072
Hey, this was in the 'Matrick'?
- You mean Matrix?

645
01:10:21,074 --> 01:10:22,040
Shut up fatso!

646
01:10:23,376 --> 01:10:26,931
Ms Chandni, if you command me
I'll throw him out!

647
01:10:27,714 --> 01:10:28,679
No, thanks

648
01:10:33,482 --> 01:10:36,449
Shoot!
- Actually they made me kneel...

649
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,716
and so I did because I'm a brave
little tin soldier!

650
01:10:40,388 --> 01:10:43,685
They said a girl will come
and then 'when I saw you I felt... '

651
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,448
'like a blooming rose,
like a poet's prose... '

652
01:10:47,795 --> 01:10:54,023
'like a deer in flight,
like a full-moon night... '

653
01:10:54,398 --> 01:10:56,397
'like an endless search... '

654
01:10:56,665 --> 01:11:02,331
'like the flame of a candle
in a far away church... '

655
01:11:04,505 --> 01:11:07,907
'I saw a girl... '

656
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:13,073
In front of everyone?

657
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:16,841
Every time I see her,
I want to sing!

658
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:20,579
Must be our Chemistry!
- Shut up! Madame Curie!

659
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,650
Go and get the tickets!
- And we'll get the chips

660
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:25,011
I'll have popcorn

661
01:11:25,354 --> 01:11:27,447
Guys, please stick together!
This place is new to me...

662
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,016
I may get lost

663
01:11:29,691 --> 01:11:31,659
"I'll get lost"
What crap!

664
01:11:39,732 --> 01:11:41,995
Why'd you push?
- Sorry!

665
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:49,863
Hold this.
How long are they taking, man?

666
01:12:00,914 --> 01:12:05,172
No mistakes, Khan.
I want Gen. Bakshi to know that...

667
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:07,852
the bullet could be
for his daughter too

668
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,085
Record it. The girl should be
in the frame

669
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:51,181
What did I do?

670
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:02,622
In a hurry, my friend?

671
01:15:46,444 --> 01:15:48,909
Looks like
your friends abandoned you

672
01:15:48,981 --> 01:15:50,845
What's to become of you now?

673
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,190
What is he doing here?

674
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,184
He's a student, sir

675
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:10,620
Since?
- About ten days old here

676
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:11,831
Really?

677
01:16:13,232 --> 01:16:16,401
Major Ram has been protecting her
for the past ten days, and you...

678
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:22,064
Because of your stupidity,
Khan has been caught

679
01:16:23,006 --> 01:16:25,935
Commander, give me a chance

680
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:32,936
No Captain.
You don't know Major Ram Sharma!

681
01:16:33,914 --> 01:16:35,675
He's the best

682
01:16:39,652 --> 01:16:45,351
My departed friend Shekhar's son.
Looks I'll have to deal with him myself.

683
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:47,223
It's going to be fun.
Gentlemen...

684
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:51,484
I promise you victory, and
that we will celebrate it with Khan

685
01:17:10,607 --> 01:17:12,439
Who is Raghavan?

686
01:17:14,011 --> 01:17:15,841
Our commander.
- A terrorist!

687
01:17:16,746 --> 01:17:19,771
A soldier who can die
for his country!

688
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:22,582
No! He can only kill

689
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,780
What war is he going to win
by killing a young boy?

690
01:17:26,218 --> 01:17:29,517
And what war are you fighting
by garlanding the enemies?

691
01:17:29,787 --> 01:17:31,751
We don't want war,
we want friendship!

692
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:36,851
It's shameful that you have
sold yourself to friendship...

693
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:39,393
and we have to do your job

694
01:17:39,395 --> 01:17:41,861
You may be in the army
but we are the true soldiers

695
01:17:42,632 --> 01:17:44,562
You and your army is useless!

696
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:48,966
You are fortunate, Khan, that you're
in front of an officer of the Army

697
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:52,866
If we were like you, then
you'd have been dead by now

698
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:58,475
We have orders to take him
to the headquarters

699
01:17:58,776 --> 01:18:00,944
Put it on hold!
Keep interrogating him

700
01:18:01,879 --> 01:18:04,047
Though, I doubt if he'll talk

701
01:18:04,615 --> 01:18:06,581
Is my jeep ready?
- Sir, where are you going?

702
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:09,917
To college.
To complete my studies

703
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:14,253
If the atomic weight of Oxygen
is sixteen...

704
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:19,519
can anyone tell me
the atomic weight of Calcium?

705
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:57,120
The atomic weight...
- Oh please let them be

706
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:00,616
Your hair look beautiful
when you let them fly

707
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:05,721
Really! When your hair falls
on your face it's like...

708
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:12,630
'I saw a girl and felt..."

709
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:15,528
'like a blooming rose... '

710
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:49,586
"Now that you're here,
and so am I..."

711
01:19:50,392 --> 01:19:54,027
"come a little closer
so I could try..."

712
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:58,794
"to tell you
how madly I love you"

713
01:20:02,204 --> 01:20:10,666
"When I first saw you and
began to get to know you..." (2x)

714
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:14,844
"I lost my sense of time"

715
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:19,644
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"

716
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:24,372
"And I lost my heart"

717
01:20:29,173 --> 01:20:33,473
"When I first saw you and
began to get to know you..."

718
01:20:33,474 --> 01:20:40,074
"And I lost my heart"

719
01:21:10,518 --> 01:21:14,087
"Why are you this beautiful?"

720
01:21:14,187 --> 01:21:18,244
"It makes us all wonder
and believe in things like fairies"

721
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,757
"Though your beauty
pales them to a blur"

722
01:21:21,192 --> 01:21:25,021
"So, why are you beautiful?"

723
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:30,023
"That makes one speechless.
I'm lost and in a mess..."

724
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:31,994
"I'm obsessed"

725
01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:36,032
"I worshipped you,
I desired only you"

726
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:40,533
"When I first saw you,
and began to get to know you..."

727
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:46,766
"I lost my sense of time"

728
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:24,632
"Now that you're here
and so am I..."

729
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:29,040
"come a little closer
so I could tell you..."

730
01:22:29,509 --> 01:22:33,307
"what magic came over me
when I first met your eye"

731
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:38,242
"My first thoughts of you,
when I realized you..."

732
01:22:38,883 --> 01:22:43,013
"when I really saw you,
and began to know you..."

733
01:22:43,486 --> 01:22:47,744
"I lost my sense of time"

734
01:22:47,856 --> 01:22:52,024
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"

735
01:22:52,626 --> 01:22:56,725
"And my heart slipped"

736
01:22:59,326 --> 01:23:17,145
"When I first saw you and
began to get to know you..." (4x)

737
01:23:30,888 --> 01:23:35,186
Violins are playing.
In college

738
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:40,517
Ram? With a teacher? These will
turn into your funeral trumpets

739
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:43,488
Look at that.
- You saw that?

740
01:23:43,563 --> 01:23:45,391
Nobody can see that

741
01:23:45,532 --> 01:23:48,325
I've had this up for so many days
with no response

742
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:51,626
This is the problem of our college.
No respect, no discipline

743
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:53,871
Whoever did this has had it

744
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:01,269
Lucky needs a tenant!
I'm here now

745
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:05,508
Are you sure you won't have
any problems with me at home?

746
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:09,510
No problems. Grandpa's room is empty
and money's a bit tight right now

747
01:24:10,116 --> 01:24:12,084
And if you're around,
mom will love you

748
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:14,784
Mom will love me?
- She always wanted a son like you...

749
01:24:15,187 --> 01:24:19,517
Clean. But got me instead!
You two will get along superbly

750
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:22,587
And wait till you
taste her cooking

751
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:27,757
Mom's cooking!
- Yeah, she has only two missions

752
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:31,297
One, to reform me.
Two, to feed everyone

753
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:35,434
And your dad?

754
01:24:40,471 --> 01:24:45,834
Ram, you're my friend
and all my friends know this

755
01:24:46,943 --> 01:24:49,374
Do not speak to me
about my father

756
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:51,479
Never

757
01:25:01,854 --> 01:25:03,821
That's our home

758
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:07,317
Lakshman,
there's no electricity?

759
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:14,023
I'm history! Mom had asked me
to repair the fuse

760
01:25:14,096 --> 01:25:15,822
I'll go and get
the fuse repaired, buddy...

761
01:25:16,097 --> 01:25:18,065
you go and calm mom down.
- I'm coming with you...

762
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:20,166
I'll be back in two minutes!
- No Lakshman, how will I?

763
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:22,058
Just two minutes!

764
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:26,801
But how will I? Your mom...

765
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:08,202
Are you back, son?

766
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,234
What took you so long?

767
01:26:21,352 --> 01:26:23,637
And why are you so quiet?

768
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,250
I knew you'd forget again

769
01:26:26,298 --> 01:26:29,244
Do you know how long I've been
in darkness? We have a blown fuse

770
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,374
Forget it, I'll scold you later,
but first take the Lord's blessings

771
01:26:32,824 --> 01:26:36,413
Oh Lord, I hope
he passes this year...

772
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:40,786
makes his mother proud
finds every joy in life

773
01:26:43,589 --> 01:26:46,174
Who? Who are you?

774
01:26:49,978 --> 01:26:52,696
I thought it's my son...
- I...

775
01:26:53,712 --> 01:26:55,178
I'm...

776
01:26:57,177 --> 01:27:01,671
This is Ram, mom, my friend,
and your new paying guest

777
01:27:02,561 --> 01:27:04,944
Ram, this is mom

778
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:07,696
I know

779
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,053
He's just your type

780
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,629
Bless you, son

781
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,007
Ram...

782
01:27:52,782 --> 01:27:55,175
here, have it hot

783
01:27:55,318 --> 01:27:58,181
Enough, aunty.
I just had loads... please!

784
01:27:58,452 --> 01:28:00,721
Enough already? You're young,
you need more. Come on

785
01:28:01,122 --> 01:28:03,190
I'm not as young you make me out be.
If I continue eating like this...

786
01:28:03,258 --> 01:28:06,020
I'll have a paunch in a week's time.
- Good! A little paunch is appealing

787
01:28:06,259 --> 01:28:08,426
Oh no aunty!
- It's a sign of prosperity

788
01:28:10,128 --> 01:28:12,694
I'll get one more
- No, no... absolutely not

789
01:28:13,397 --> 01:28:15,394
Why? Aren't they nice?

790
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:19,428
It's not that aunty.
They say...

791
01:28:19,902 --> 01:28:22,195
mother's hands create magic
no matter what

792
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:25,699
Yes. Lucky told me

793
01:28:27,807 --> 01:28:29,633
I'm sorry, son

794
01:28:31,143 --> 01:28:33,770
So, did your father bring you up?

795
01:28:34,145 --> 01:28:38,305
Yes. He nurtured me,
brought me up

796
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:42,584
My father was... is
a really nice man

797
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:46,579
Never let me feel
my mother's absence

798
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:50,316
But yes, he could never
cook like this

799
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:55,151
Actually aunty, I am what I am
because of my father

800
01:28:56,827 --> 01:28:59,955
You're very nice, Ram!
Your father must be a nice man too

801
01:29:00,363 --> 01:29:01,330
Yes

802
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:04,833
Fathers are so important

803
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:14,470
Sometimes I feel if
Lucky's father was with us...

804
01:29:17,108 --> 01:29:19,435
Aunty, if you don't mind my asking...

805
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:22,744
I mean, Lucky's father?

806
01:29:22,947 --> 01:29:24,743
We don't live together

807
01:29:25,783 --> 01:29:29,381
We had a fight and I left home

808
01:29:31,486 --> 01:29:33,653
But didn't he come
to take you back?

809
01:29:34,322 --> 01:29:36,855
Several times

810
01:29:38,325 --> 01:29:43,290
It's been seven years now, Madhu.
Please come back now

811
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,419
Haven't you forgiven me yet?

812
01:29:48,732 --> 01:29:50,699
It's not about forgiveness
any more, Shekhar

813
01:29:51,734 --> 01:29:54,661
Even if I reconcile
with your infidelity...

814
01:29:56,338 --> 01:29:59,100
I cannot bear to live
with that boy at home

815
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:00,802
Madhu, please

816
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,141
He needs me

817
01:30:06,743 --> 01:30:10,343
Just him? What about me, Shekhar?

818
01:30:12,849 --> 01:30:15,742
And is Lakshman not your son?

819
01:30:20,955 --> 01:30:23,221
You will need to choose, Shekhar

820
01:30:23,756 --> 01:30:26,286
Lakshman and I will
come with you right away

821
01:30:27,758 --> 01:30:30,027
But only if you want it this way

822
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:48,234
Mom...
- His Highness has arrived

823
01:30:52,844 --> 01:30:55,676
Lucky, you're a walking mess!
- Where are my shoes, mom?

824
01:30:55,879 --> 01:30:59,278
Why don't you cut your hair?
And why're you a wearing doggy leash?

825
01:30:59,783 --> 01:31:03,782
Your jeans are torn!
And your shirt... son, give it to me!

826
01:31:04,019 --> 01:31:05,984
I'll stitch it up in two minutes!
- Torn?

827
01:31:06,153 --> 01:31:08,279
I sat up since morning with a blade
to get it this way and you say...

828
01:31:08,488 --> 01:31:10,980
Mom, it's fashion!
- Don't call me 'mom', Lakshman!

829
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:16,284
Then don't call me 'Lakshman', mom!
Lakshman - I hate the name Lakshman!

830
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:19,293
Why? It's a lovely name.
Lakshman Prasad

831
01:31:19,797 --> 01:31:22,286
And goes well with your image.
- Oh, don't you just love it?

832
01:31:22,731 --> 01:31:25,096
Ram-Lakshman, seems like Mahabharat
started in this very house!

833
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:29,167
The Ramayan!
- Whatever! I'm off

834
01:31:29,803 --> 01:31:31,395
Lakshman, you won't be able
to get up tomorrow as well

835
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,262
I will mom...
- Tomorrow's Tuesday

836
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:35,506
I have to go to the temple.
- And we will, mom

837
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:37,798
I know you won't wake up.
- Temples are so boring, mom

838
01:31:38,009 --> 01:31:38,975
Ok, Ok, Ok!

839
01:31:39,209 --> 01:31:41,743
I'll take mother... I mean aunty,
to the temple

840
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:46,436
Ram, you're godsend!
See, problem solved

841
01:31:58,458 --> 01:32:03,624
May I call you 'mother'?
- Only if you eat my food every day

842
01:32:04,695 --> 01:32:06,321
Then forget it, aunty

843
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,090
Bye mom!

844
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:11,159
He'll come back late in the night.
This boy hardly sleeps

845
01:32:14,918 --> 01:32:17,476
Wake up. Wake up, you morons!

846
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:23,288
I had given you an assignment
on Physics 3 days back...

847
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,458
Heat and Pressure

848
01:32:29,928 --> 01:32:33,123
And I would be delighted
if someone has not done it

849
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,988
Why sir?
- Because...

850
01:32:35,365 --> 01:32:38,791
then you'll have to do
the same assignment five times

851
01:32:43,672 --> 01:32:45,502
Why does he spit?
- Take out your homework

852
01:32:45,873 --> 01:32:47,940
You too... you too...

853
01:32:48,241 --> 01:32:50,501
And ah! Lucky!

854
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,141
Lucky!!

855
01:32:55,545 --> 01:32:57,012
Homework?
- I have it

856
01:32:57,213 --> 01:32:59,340
Trying to con me, eh?
- No, sir

857
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:02,510
Today we'll separate the wheat
from the chaff

858
01:33:02,884 --> 01:33:03,850
One second, sir!

859
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:05,919
Yes, do search below as well.
Maybe you dropped it there

860
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:09,849
But if it's not there
I suggest you start praying...

861
01:33:10,289 --> 01:33:14,246
as only Lord Ram can
save you today

862
01:33:18,495 --> 01:33:20,519
I know that your homework...

863
01:33:22,499 --> 01:33:24,192
is done!

864
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:26,060
I don't believe it!

865
01:33:31,972 --> 01:33:35,873
And have you done your home work?

866
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:38,133
No, sir!

867
01:33:39,911 --> 01:33:40,877
Got you!

868
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:54,676
I miss the army. I've to get down on
my knees at the drop of a spit-ball!

869
01:33:55,289 --> 01:33:57,782
If anyone sees me here,
I'd definitely be court martialled!

870
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:26,172
You?

871
01:34:27,076 --> 01:34:28,838
You're up to something again?
- No ma'am!

872
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:32,042
I'm going to have you expelled!
- No Ma'am, I wasn't singing

873
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:34,950
Then what?
Why are you on your knees?

874
01:34:35,484 --> 01:34:40,984
I've been...
punished by Mr Rasai!

875
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,486
Really?
- Really

876
01:34:46,825 --> 01:34:48,651
I know it is very silly

877
01:34:51,995 --> 01:34:56,497
"Oh lord! This boy
is nutty as a pie..."

878
01:34:57,165 --> 01:35:01,224
"why is it so hard
to make him realize..."

879
01:35:01,502 --> 01:35:06,001
"that first the heart pines,
but slowly..."

880
01:35:06,839 --> 01:35:10,534
"and only on the way one finds love,
then you fall freely"

881
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:21,606
Rohan, have you seen Lucky?
- He's in the library

882
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:22,873
Library?

883
01:36:17,823 --> 01:36:19,290
You're Lucky, right?

884
01:36:19,825 --> 01:36:22,322
Why don't you go and put it up
on the college notice board?

885
01:36:27,396 --> 01:36:31,057
You're Sanju's boyfriend, right?
- Hey double battery, single power!

886
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,965
Sanju? My girlfriend?
Are you mad?

887
01:36:34,534 --> 01:36:37,901
Lucky's girlfriend will be
the world's most beautiful girl

888
01:36:38,337 --> 01:36:41,837
Not a plain Jane like Sanju.
Now buzz off

889
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,171
I have to study

890
01:37:03,589 --> 01:37:06,621
My dad is not dead, Ram

891
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:09,418
I know

892
01:37:17,799 --> 01:37:20,725
He never loved me

893
01:37:23,803 --> 01:37:25,771
He always wanted a son...

894
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:31,372
who would make him proud,
join the army like him

895
01:37:37,814 --> 01:37:42,412
Are sons everything?
And daughters mean nothing?

896
01:37:45,419 --> 01:37:46,386
Sanju...

897
01:37:53,825 --> 01:37:57,092
Even as a child I tried to be
my father's 'son'

898
01:37:59,828 --> 01:38:02,096
And look, I've succeeded

899
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:06,428
No one even remembers
that I'm a girl

900
01:38:08,636 --> 01:38:13,098
Sanju, you're fine the way you are

901
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,670
It's time we remind everyone that
you're the most beautiful girl...

902
01:38:20,977 --> 01:38:23,244
not only in the college,
but the world

903
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:27,248
Come with me.
- No Ram, please

904
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:33,118
I'm here now

905
01:38:36,855 --> 01:38:40,290
Yes Ram!!
- Good evening ma'am!

906
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,959
Can you make me
look exactly like you?

907
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:49,052
What???
- Yes... not me. Sanju

908
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:56,431
Hi Sanju!
- Hello ma'am!

909
01:38:56,869 --> 01:39:00,138
Come on... Come, come!

910
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:05,307
See you then!
- When, Ma'am?

911
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:22,787
Physics assignment.
Five exercises!

912
01:39:24,522 --> 01:39:29,681
You did my physics assignment?
All five? I don't believe it

913
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,453
I thought I'll do three
but by the third time...

914
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:36,426
it actually started to make sense,
so I decided to do the rest as well

915
01:39:37,164 --> 01:39:38,926
By the way, you're welcome!

916
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:44,291
Oh, thank you!
I was about to say thank you!

917
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:48,832
I said, you're welcome. Just do me
a favour, don't tell anyone

918
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:52,208
I got a reputation to protect.
- Of course. School, Lucky and all

919
01:39:53,843 --> 01:39:56,942
Actually, you can
tell Sanju about it

920
01:39:58,145 --> 01:40:02,171
She keeps chewing brains. This will
shut her up for at least two weeks

921
01:40:02,781 --> 01:40:04,442
You know what I mean...
- Yeah, I know what you mean!

922
01:40:04,785 --> 01:40:06,909
You mean you like Sanju a lot
- Like?

923
01:40:07,185 --> 01:40:09,982
Yes. Like.
- As in?

924
01:40:10,189 --> 01:40:13,156
As in... you know as in...

925
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,419
You are crazy man!
- No, no! You are crazy about Sanju!

926
01:40:16,792 --> 01:40:18,759
No, no! You are crazy!
- No, you are crazy about crazy Sanju!

927
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:24,791
Ram, when Lucky will fall in love
the entire college will hear violins

928
01:40:27,799 --> 01:40:29,625
Sanju? No

929
01:40:33,805 --> 01:40:36,102
Sanju...
No way, Ram

930
01:41:08,864 --> 01:41:10,554
Shut your mouth, uncle

931
01:41:19,772 --> 01:41:23,430
"Love is such a tornado,
Love is such a storm"

932
01:41:23,906 --> 01:41:27,839
"Love takes away the power
of every life form"

933
01:41:28,209 --> 01:41:32,267
"Everyone in love is crazed,
anyone in love is in a daze"

934
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:36,241
"Love makes it all so difficult,
yet it's all so easy in love"

935
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:38,277
"Look at these visions, these
lovesick souls, these smoking coals"

936
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:40,885
"Look at the follies of love"

937
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:46,113
"The woes of my heart
having glimpsed you..."

938
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:49,955
"It's like a magical spell,
what can I say"

939
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:54,559
"The woes of my heart
having glimpsed you..."

940
01:41:54,996 --> 01:41:58,691
"It's like a magical spell,
what can I say"

941
01:42:42,396 --> 01:42:45,223
Check that! Like that!

942
01:42:45,699 --> 01:42:50,028
"The heart is but a traveller,
and you are the oasis it seeks"

943
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:53,962
"The heart is but a canoe,
and you are its bank with mystique"

944
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:58,428
"What more can the heart desire,
if it has you"

945
01:42:58,874 --> 01:43:00,773
"My heart is
a lonely place, my dear"

946
01:43:00,975 --> 01:43:02,838
"Come, I need your light
and your sparkly cheer"

947
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:06,978
Check that!
Wicked!

948
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:11,277
"Love brings all the joy,
Love has the power to destroy"

949
01:43:11,715 --> 01:43:15,444
"It is its own limitation,
but frees one like the sky"

950
01:43:16,087 --> 01:43:19,880
"In the Land of Love,
live millions of dreams each day"

951
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:23,688
"Lucky are those who get lost,
for love has shown them the way"

952
01:43:24,192 --> 01:43:26,352
"Look at these visions pal, these
lovesick souls, these hopeful ghouls"

953
01:43:26,726 --> 01:43:28,694
"Look at the follies of love"

954
01:43:30,295 --> 01:43:46,700
"The woes of my heart having glimpsed you.
It's like a magical spell, what can I say" (2x)

955
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:14,854
Check that! Like that!

956
01:44:23,434 --> 01:44:26,193
"I worship you"

957
01:44:26,703 --> 01:44:33,965
"You are my prayer"

958
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:37,236
"If I have loved..."

959
01:44:37,711 --> 01:44:44,113
"I have loved only this way"

960
01:44:45,048 --> 01:44:47,708
"If I have loved..."

961
01:44:47,985 --> 01:44:54,243
"I have loved
only this way"

962
01:44:55,823 --> 01:44:58,792
Check that!
Wicked!!

963
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,317
"My heart is going insane,
you are its only balm"

964
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:07,491
"Why is my heart all aflutter?
Tell me, love, what is the matter"

965
01:45:07,865 --> 01:45:11,824
"Let your perfume
waft over and find me"

966
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:16,066
"Let your hair rain
their dark clouds over me"

967
01:45:17,172 --> 01:45:20,001
Check that! Like that!

968
01:45:20,675 --> 01:45:24,504
"Sweetheart, I have
crossed the beyond..."

969
01:45:24,945 --> 01:45:28,911
"Sweetheart, you and
only you are my dawn..."

970
01:45:29,147 --> 01:45:33,205
"Sweetheart, alas. You can't see
what's in my heart"

971
01:45:33,683 --> 01:45:37,084
"Sweetheart, you'll remember me
only when I fall apart"

972
01:45:37,686 --> 01:45:39,586
"Look at these visions pal, these
lovesick souls, these hopeful ghouls"

973
01:45:39,788 --> 01:45:41,755
"Look at the follies of love"

974
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:46,990
"The woes of my heart
having glimpsed you..."

975
01:45:47,626 --> 01:45:50,924
"It's like a magical spell,
what can I say"

976
01:45:51,296 --> 01:45:55,355
"The woes of my heart
having glimpsed you..."

977
01:45:55,966 --> 01:46:00,094
"It's like a magical spell,
what can I say"

978
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:18,013
Hi Sanju!

979
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:20,946
Ma'am, it worked!
- I can see that

980
01:46:21,152 --> 01:46:23,618
You're looking very pretty!
- Ma'am it's all because of you!

981
01:46:23,987 --> 01:46:25,614
Thank you so much!
- You're welcome!

982
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,251
But you should thank
someone else for this

983
01:46:33,726 --> 01:46:35,725
Ma'am, isn't he different?

984
01:46:35,927 --> 01:46:37,724
Do you know he's actually older
than you are?

985
01:46:39,664 --> 01:46:43,296
I do. But he's still my student

986
01:46:57,676 --> 01:46:59,577
Hi Sanju.
- Hi

987
01:46:59,944 --> 01:47:02,573
Sanju, I want to... I have
to say something to you

988
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,575
But I don't know how to...
- I know what you want say

989
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:06,915
Really!!!

990
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:09,236
That I'm looking really nice today

991
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:11,974
You feel this sudden
attraction towards me

992
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:14,672
Well, I did this all for you.
- Me?

993
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:19,181
Well, I feel like I'm cheating you

994
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:23,218
Because this isn't the real me

995
01:47:23,785 --> 01:47:26,386
Tomorrow when I go back to
my old clothes...

996
01:47:26,889 --> 01:47:29,786
and when Mini comes to you
wearing those micro-minis...

997
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,695
Percy!

998
01:47:35,698 --> 01:47:38,195
Lucky, do you know
the difference between Percy and you?

999
01:47:39,836 --> 01:47:42,802
At least Percy's feelings
weren't for my clothes

1000
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,333
What's up, Lucky?
- Nothing

1001
01:48:14,338 --> 01:48:16,305
You could talk to me

1002
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:17,799
No thanks

1003
01:48:21,677 --> 01:48:24,978
Hang on... Army...

1004
01:48:34,691 --> 01:48:36,990
Food's here

1005
01:48:41,632 --> 01:48:43,601
Ram, are you interested in the army?

1006
01:48:47,637 --> 01:48:48,832
A lot.

1007
01:48:49,807 --> 01:48:53,936
Army guys are different
Don't you think?

1008
01:48:54,645 --> 01:48:59,947
I mean, their style
or anything...

1009
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:16,029
My father used to say
"It's a man's life"

1010
01:49:16,334 --> 01:49:19,833
Medals on the chest,
discipline, guns, tanks...

1011
01:49:21,772 --> 01:49:26,273
giving up life for the country...
They are so distinguished

1012
01:49:26,744 --> 01:49:28,208
Aren't they?

1013
01:49:29,012 --> 01:49:30,981
Mom, I'm going out

1014
01:49:31,382 --> 01:49:32,450
Mom...

1015
01:49:33,918 --> 01:49:35,986
Mom why do you do this
to yourself.

1016
01:49:36,754 --> 01:49:38,584
Sorry pal, I hate the army

1017
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:41,788
I'm not interested in their style
or their uniform

1018
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:44,555
They and their problems
can go take a hike

1019
01:49:44,929 --> 01:49:47,591
Lakshman!
- Mom, you know I hate their display

1020
01:49:47,898 --> 01:49:51,399
What is all this 'uniform,
patriotic duty... ' all bullshit!

1021
01:49:51,637 --> 01:49:53,804
Speak with some respect Lakshman!

1022
01:49:54,072 --> 01:49:56,798
My father is in the army.
I know how much he has sacrificed

1023
01:49:57,977 --> 01:50:01,103
We never met for months because
he was protecting the border...

1024
01:50:01,347 --> 01:50:04,812
so you, me and people like us
could sleep peacefully

1025
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,312
You know what...

1026
01:50:06,652 --> 01:50:09,251
Even my father's in the army
and he's sacrificed a lot

1027
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:11,114
He's even given up his family

1028
01:50:11,657 --> 01:50:13,725
I haven't seen him
for twenty years...

1029
01:50:14,192 --> 01:50:16,285
not because he was
serving the country...

1030
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:20,223
but because he left my mother and me
to bring up his bastard son

1031
01:50:23,468 --> 01:50:25,968
Lakshman, not in front of...
- I'm just speaking facts, mom

1032
01:50:26,672 --> 01:50:28,740
It won't affect him one bit

1033
01:50:29,741 --> 01:50:31,275
You know what...

1034
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:33,740
My mother hasn't slept peacefully
for twenty years

1035
01:50:33,847 --> 01:50:37,248
It doesn't matter to him.
It hardly matters to army men

1036
01:50:37,783 --> 01:50:41,683
They have no feelings.
They are inhuman you know.

1037
01:50:43,689 --> 01:50:45,590
You don't believe me!

1038
01:50:48,694 --> 01:50:53,698
Dad, do you hear me?
I'm talking to you

1039
01:50:53,966 --> 01:50:56,264
Lakshman, please Lakshman!
- No, don't worry mom.

1040
01:50:56,902 --> 01:50:59,436
It won't affect him
He can't hear me

1041
01:51:00,638 --> 01:51:02,266
Can you hear me, dad?

1042
01:51:02,642 --> 01:51:03,969
He never hears me

1043
01:51:05,644 --> 01:51:07,613
Nothing matters to him, mom

1044
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,047
Dad, I'm talking to you

1045
01:51:12,985 --> 01:51:14,954
You don't care, right?

1046
01:51:15,655 --> 01:51:18,053
When I fail, you don't care

1047
01:51:19,692 --> 01:51:21,626
When I don't come back home
in the night...

1048
01:51:21,994 --> 01:51:23,621
you don't worry about me, right?

1049
01:51:24,664 --> 01:51:27,230
Why don't you scold me when
I don't cut my hair? Scold me, please

1050
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:34,204
Why don't I fear you
when I secretly smoke, dad... Why?

1051
01:51:35,676 --> 01:51:37,403
Do you care?

1052
01:51:37,978 --> 01:51:39,946
You love me?

1053
01:51:40,614 --> 01:51:42,681
Do you hate me?

1054
01:51:43,617 --> 01:51:45,244
Anything... anything

1055
01:51:48,622 --> 01:51:50,249
I hate you

1056
01:51:50,892 --> 01:51:52,860
I hate you, dad

1057
01:51:53,693 --> 01:51:55,594
And I hate that swine

1058
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:03,335
I hate him, Mom and
I hate his bastard son!

1059
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,086
Are you okay?

1060
01:52:22,722 --> 01:52:24,924
Can you both not forgive him?

1061
01:52:27,995 --> 01:52:29,963
It's too late, Ram

1062
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,269
It's too late for him

1063
01:52:54,623 --> 01:52:56,590
What are you watching, Lucky?

1064
01:52:58,026 --> 01:52:59,955
The most lucky guy in college

1065
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:10,300
Lucky really misses
his father a lot, right?

1066
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:14,569
Yes. He is helpless, but you...

1067
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:22,014
Life passes by and we get used to
living without love

1068
01:53:23,252 --> 01:53:27,149
Why don't we give love a chance?
Why don't we trust our feelings?

1069
01:53:29,992 --> 01:53:32,619
Why don't you speak to
your father, Sanjana? Give him a call

1070
01:53:32,894 --> 01:53:36,461
No, he always preferred
to keep me away from him

1071
01:53:37,667 --> 01:53:39,568
So now you're having your revenge?

1072
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:42,960
Sanjana, people change,
love changes them

1073
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,998
You fear that he hates you.
Perhaps he fears the same thing

1074
01:53:50,346 --> 01:53:52,314
Why do we fear the ones
we love so much?

1075
01:53:53,616 --> 01:53:58,776
Speak to him once, Sanjana.
Life's too short for hatred

1076
01:54:06,328 --> 01:54:09,598
How are you, darling?
It's me

1077
01:54:10,735 --> 01:54:14,030
I heard your husband
is out of town

1078
01:54:15,637 --> 01:54:21,800
Where are you calling from?
- From a booth opposite your home

1079
01:54:24,647 --> 01:54:25,840
What say?

1080
01:54:27,051 --> 01:54:29,050
Looks like someone wants to die

1081
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:33,382
Gun, pistol... who are you?

1082
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:36,392
Quietly come with us

1083
01:54:37,995 --> 01:54:38,962
Hi

1084
01:54:39,596 --> 01:54:40,754
Oh Ram!

1085
01:54:42,266 --> 01:54:44,234
I thought it was mom

1086
01:54:46,603 --> 01:54:49,772
So what are you giving mom tomorrow?
- Why? What's tomorrow?

1087
01:54:50,942 --> 01:54:52,268
Her birthday

1088
01:54:54,611 --> 01:54:58,670
Oh shit! I forgot again.
This is too much

1089
01:54:59,016 --> 01:55:03,348
Ram, kick me, I deserve it.
- Yes, you deserve it

1090
01:55:05,623 --> 01:55:06,589
Thank you

1091
01:55:06,957 --> 01:55:09,126
Ram, think of something quick

1092
01:55:11,795 --> 01:55:12,863
Done

1093
01:55:34,652 --> 01:55:36,819
Happy Birthday, Ma

1094
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:41,759
You... you cut your hair?
- Avoid, Ma

1095
01:55:42,959 --> 01:55:46,028
I didn't know
I have such a handsome son

1096
01:55:46,297 --> 01:55:49,462
That's me. I love you, Ma

1097
01:55:50,935 --> 01:55:52,904
I love you too, son

1098
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:14,691
Good morning class!
- Good morning sir!

1099
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:18,220
Class, I have some good news and
some bad news.

1100
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:21,693
The bad news is that Prof. Rasai
has resigned

1101
01:56:24,902 --> 01:56:29,128
The good news is that Prof. Rasai
has sent a replacement himself

1102
01:56:32,644 --> 01:56:36,803
So class please welcome
Prof. Raghavan Datta!

1103
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:50,261
Greetings disciples

1104
01:56:50,929 --> 01:56:52,655
Who is this 'ciples'?

1105
01:56:52,831 --> 01:56:55,431
I leave them
in your care professor...

1106
01:56:56,803 --> 01:56:59,995
Raghav.
- Raghav, right. I'm off

1107
01:57:07,211 --> 01:57:10,580
My name is Raghav, and
you can call me by my name

1108
01:57:11,117 --> 01:57:13,684
No sir, no professor, because...

1109
01:57:13,852 --> 01:57:17,684
What an ape. Won't last a week.
Am glad I cut my hair!

1110
01:57:18,392 --> 01:57:20,255
I'll learn new things from you

1111
01:57:20,793 --> 01:57:23,125
I'm fascinated by
your generation's perspective

1112
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,293
Who's 'Percy-pective' now?

1113
01:57:26,634 --> 01:57:31,592
We may have an age gap, but not
in our thoughts

1114
01:57:32,004 --> 01:57:34,939
Not much gap in age too, sir.
Right, Ram?

1115
01:57:36,074 --> 01:57:37,367
Hey Vivek, watch it

1116
01:57:37,977 --> 01:57:39,137
Ram

1117
01:57:40,646 --> 01:57:41,271
Sir

1118
01:57:41,713 --> 01:57:43,944
Did you fail, or start
your education really late?

1119
01:57:44,217 --> 01:57:47,918
Sir, actually Ram had to give...
- No one asked you

1120
01:57:50,856 --> 01:57:54,494
When elders talk, learn to shut up

1121
01:57:55,094 --> 01:57:58,453
Has your father not taught this much?
- That's not fair, sir

1122
01:57:59,665 --> 01:58:03,924
Interesting class.
Everyone speaks for each other

1123
01:58:04,737 --> 01:58:06,837
What's your name?
- Lucky

1124
01:58:07,675 --> 01:58:08,641
Stand up.

1125
01:58:09,677 --> 01:58:12,445
Full name?
- Lakshman Prasad Sharma

1126
01:58:16,684 --> 01:58:18,652
Sit.
Not you Ram

1127
01:58:20,019 --> 01:58:24,950
Ram, you look intelligent
and disciplined

1128
01:58:25,759 --> 01:58:28,727
Didn't you teach them
some manners?

1129
01:58:29,797 --> 01:58:34,996
Anyway, now that I'm here you will
learn everything. It'll be fun

1130
01:58:35,369 --> 01:58:38,565
Raghav... permission to sit, sir?

1131
01:58:39,305 --> 01:58:40,703
Any doubts?

1132
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:47,449
What a horridly rude guy!
- Avoid, Sanju

1133
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:50,354
Avoid what? How dare he say
anything about my dad?

1134
01:58:51,558 --> 01:58:54,527
Will his saying anything
affect your dad? It won't, right?

1135
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:57,197
But the guy's got attitude

1136
01:58:57,664 --> 01:59:00,388
By the way, you look really cute
with this short haircut

1137
01:59:02,637 --> 01:59:06,737
Sanju, will you be my date
for the Prom Night?

1138
01:59:08,976 --> 01:59:12,407
Lucky... I'd promised Percy
that I'd go with him.

1139
01:59:12,846 --> 01:59:17,174
Oh Percy. I completely forgot.
No problem. See you

1140
01:59:18,686 --> 01:59:21,652
Lucky, last few tickets left
for the Prom Night. You want?

1141
01:59:22,022 --> 01:59:24,819
No dude. Not going this year.
- What? Are you mad?

1142
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:27,258
How can we have
a Prom Night without you?

1143
01:59:29,297 --> 01:59:31,560
Hi, Sanju.
- Hi, Percy

1144
01:59:32,266 --> 01:59:34,733
Sanju, I can't come with you
for the prom night

1145
01:59:35,036 --> 01:59:36,102
What???

1146
01:59:36,204 --> 01:59:38,701
Thing is I get bored
with you, Sanju

1147
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:42,134
And what's with
this lipstick?

1148
01:59:44,545 --> 01:59:47,644
So better luck next time...
baby.

1149
01:59:54,553 --> 01:59:57,581
But I think
you should go with Lucky

1150
02:00:04,564 --> 02:00:06,533
Percy, I'm so sorry!

1151
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,725
Better luck next time Percy!

1152
02:00:10,571 --> 02:00:12,937
Oh Percy, you're so sweet!

1153
02:00:13,907 --> 02:00:15,199
Sweet? Who?

1154
02:00:15,976 --> 02:00:18,145
I'll be at the Prom with
the other teachers

1155
02:00:18,645 --> 02:00:20,644
Everybody check your transmitter.

1156
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:23,811
And this time there should
be no mistake

1157
02:00:25,286 --> 02:00:27,352
I can't go to the Prom.

1158
02:00:27,686 --> 02:00:29,652
I don't know how to dance
- What?

1159
02:00:31,191 --> 02:00:33,659
Sorry.
- Okay. Dance here

1160
02:02:05,554 --> 02:02:06,783
Hello Papa

1161
02:02:11,559 --> 02:02:13,187
How are you, Papa?

1162
02:02:33,917 --> 02:02:35,543
Hasta La Vista, baby

1163
02:02:51,067 --> 02:02:53,492
Welcome ladies and gentlemen,
to Sports Day

1164
02:02:54,537 --> 02:02:56,732
Boys team in black
and girls team in red

1165
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:00,270
What are you saying? Not Sports day,
it's the Prom Night

1166
02:03:00,543 --> 02:03:01,609
Prom?

1167
02:03:03,213 --> 02:03:06,682
Welcome to the Prom Night

1168
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:10,275
Like last year, no kissing
on the dance floor

1169
02:03:10,553 --> 02:03:12,748
Especially boys and boys!
Okay?

1170
02:03:18,162 --> 02:03:21,690
Ram, this is your chance.
Go ask Ms Chandni For a dance

1171
02:03:21,899 --> 02:03:23,929
No, no
- Come on, Ram! Be a man

1172
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,366
No, I'm not a man.
I mean not!!

1173
02:03:25,569 --> 02:03:27,866
Ram, if you don't ask her to dance
with you tonight...

1174
02:03:28,304 --> 02:03:30,135
I won't speak to you.
- No, Sanju...

1175
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:32,206
Me too, Ram.
- Lakshman?

1176
02:03:32,575 --> 02:03:33,735
Me too.

1177
02:03:34,578 --> 02:03:35,905
Listen guys

1178
02:03:39,516 --> 02:03:42,584
The Major's attention is somewhere
else. You guys go ahead

1179
02:03:42,953 --> 02:03:45,478
Sir, we're in position.
We have the target in sight

1180
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:56,797
"Everybody get down,
this party is going to town"

1181
02:03:57,067 --> 02:04:00,804
"Rambablula, Ram Bamboo,
there is only one thing to do!"

1182
02:04:15,252 --> 02:04:19,518
"Baby, baby, let's rock,
Dance all night long till 12' o'clock!"

1183
02:04:39,678 --> 02:04:41,674
"Hey fair maiden..."

1184
02:04:41,846 --> 02:04:44,114
"sometime, somewhere, secretly..."

1185
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:46,278
"let's meet sometime in secrecy..."

1186
02:04:46,517 --> 02:04:48,485
"let's talk
sweet nothings endlessly"

1187
02:04:48,586 --> 02:04:53,018
"But please oh please
don't meet others similarly"

1188
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:55,455
"Hey handsome..."

1189
02:04:55,526 --> 02:04:57,595
"sweet, naive and such a rookie"

1190
02:04:57,862 --> 02:05:00,030
"Look, we're made for each other"

1191
02:05:00,198 --> 02:05:02,164
"Can you hear our hearts flutter?"

1192
02:05:02,533 --> 02:05:06,594
"But I hope no other
can hear our private chatter"

1193
02:05:07,005 --> 02:05:09,198
"Hey fair maiden..."

1194
02:05:09,541 --> 02:05:11,268
"sometime, somewhere, secretly"

1195
02:05:11,609 --> 02:05:13,609
"Hey handsome..."

1196
02:05:13,877 --> 02:05:16,106
"sweet, naive and such a rookie"

1197
02:05:43,575 --> 02:05:45,576
"Now that you're here..."

1198
02:05:45,678 --> 02:05:47,646
"my dreams seem so close, so near"

1199
02:05:47,947 --> 02:05:50,015
"And if you feel generous..."

1200
02:05:50,115 --> 02:05:52,115
"the weather will be marvellous"

1201
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:54,450
"Now that we are one..."

1202
02:05:54,587 --> 02:05:56,855
"everything seems like fun"

1203
02:05:57,456 --> 02:06:01,316
"Now that we're together,
say bye-bye to cold weather"

1204
02:06:01,794 --> 02:06:03,726
"The breeze is soft and dewy..."

1205
02:06:03,863 --> 02:06:06,058
"the night is lost and sleepy"

1206
02:06:06,332 --> 02:06:08,400
"What's come over us so slowly"

1207
02:06:08,666 --> 02:06:10,598
"We've lost our senses entirely"

1208
02:06:10,736 --> 02:06:14,833
"Just so you won't remember
anyone but me"

1209
02:06:15,174 --> 02:06:17,342
"Hey fair maiden..."

1210
02:06:17,709 --> 02:06:19,709
"sometime, somewhere, secretly"

1211
02:06:20,612 --> 02:06:22,080
"Hey handsome..."

1212
02:06:22,449 --> 02:06:24,677
"sweet, naive, such a rookie"

1213
02:06:38,198 --> 02:06:41,964
"Everybody get down,
this party is going to town"

1214
02:06:42,569 --> 02:06:46,967
"Lets rock lets shock,
Gonna be together till 1'o'clock!"

1215
02:07:14,868 --> 02:07:18,998
"These wretched distances
lead to such restlessness"

1216
02:07:19,539 --> 02:07:23,697
"But if you come a little close,
you can have my life"

1217
02:07:23,977 --> 02:07:28,304
"If you're so restless,
then hear this, I confess"

1218
02:07:28,547 --> 02:07:32,707
"If you're in my heart, my dear,
how can we not be near?"

1219
02:07:32,753 --> 02:07:37,421
"Her eyes look down ever so shyly,
I caught it though it was so flighty"

1220
02:07:37,625 --> 02:07:39,525
"I don't mind getting a bouquet"

1221
02:07:39,793 --> 02:07:41,862
"But like a gentleman stay away"

1222
02:07:41,963 --> 02:07:46,394
"Just a few more days without me"

1223
02:07:46,632 --> 02:07:48,733
"Hey fair maiden..."

1224
02:07:48,935 --> 02:07:51,104
"sometime, somewhere, secretly..."

1225
02:07:51,272 --> 02:07:53,439
"let's meet sometime in secrecy..."

1226
02:07:53,608 --> 02:07:55,641
"Let's talk sweet nothings endlessly"

1227
02:07:55,675 --> 02:08:00,245
"But please oh please
don't meet others similarly"

1228
02:08:00,582 --> 02:08:02,309
"Hey handsome..."

1229
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:04,750
"sweet, naive and such a rookie..."

1230
02:08:04,986 --> 02:08:07,153
"we're made for each other"

1231
02:08:07,356 --> 02:08:09,352
"Can you hear our hearts flutter?"

1232
02:08:09,589 --> 02:08:13,852
"But I hope no other can hear
our private chatter"

1233
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:18,640
"Hey fair maiden...
sometime, somewhere, secretly..."

1234
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:23,441
"Hey handsome...
sweet, naive and such a rookie."

1235
02:08:30,947 --> 02:08:33,239
Your mere touch nearly killed me

1236
02:08:33,383 --> 02:08:35,447
OK! Good night then! Bye-Bye!
- Bye-Bye!

1237
02:08:35,617 --> 02:08:37,877
Ms Chandni, you dance
very well indeed.

1238
02:08:37,986 --> 02:08:39,680
Thank you. Good night.
- Good night

1239
02:08:39,889 --> 02:08:41,615
Who is dropping you home by the way?

1240
02:08:41,723 --> 02:08:43,520
I'm a big girl, I'll drive myself
home in my car.

1241
02:08:43,724 --> 02:08:46,294
True. But a lay should be
escorted to her car

1242
02:08:46,628 --> 02:08:49,859
Please don't take the trouble
- Oh no. I don't mean me

1243
02:08:50,166 --> 02:08:52,632
I mean your favorite student. Ram

1244
02:08:52,902 --> 02:08:54,627
Sir.
- Come here

1245
02:08:55,571 --> 02:08:57,198
Won't you escort
Ms Chandni to her car?

1246
02:08:57,574 --> 02:08:59,641
Really, there's no need for you to...
- No, no.

1247
02:08:59,908 --> 02:09:01,535
I...
- Actually

1248
02:09:01,979 --> 02:09:03,978
Please go with her
- Yes, sir

1249
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:13,217
Target approaching door. Handle it.
- Yes, sir

1250
02:09:15,105 --> 02:09:18,804
I'm sorry you were
forced to escort me, Ram

1251
02:09:19,012 --> 02:09:22,010
I love it, ma'am.
I mean, it's my duty

1252
02:09:24,118 --> 02:09:27,483
You really dance superbly.
Where did you learn?

1253
02:09:27,859 --> 02:09:30,587
Actually, whenever I see you,
I feel like a fish out of water...

1254
02:09:30,928 --> 02:09:33,589
A nut without a cracker...
- Oh no. Not again

1255
02:09:33,867 --> 02:09:36,368
Actually Sanju, Lucky,
Vivek and Mini forced me...

1256
02:09:36,637 --> 02:09:38,466
Your sari is lovely

1257
02:09:44,882 --> 02:09:49,888
Ram, do you drive
as well as you dance?

1258
02:09:51,825 --> 02:09:53,795
Won't you drop me home?

1259
02:10:52,579 --> 02:10:53,479
Ram!

1260
02:10:56,952 --> 02:10:58,419
C'mon!
- Ram!

1261
02:10:59,089 --> 02:11:00,386
Get out!

1262
02:11:02,158 --> 02:11:04,591
Stop! Put the gun down
or I'll blow her brains out

1263
02:11:05,029 --> 02:11:06,828
Ram, listen to him!

1264
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,835
Down!
- Down...

1265
02:11:27,696 --> 02:11:30,057
Sorry about the sari, ma'am

1266
02:11:31,701 --> 02:11:32,769
It's no problem

1267
02:11:35,941 --> 02:11:38,237
Thanks for the lift, sir.
But you needn't have bothered

1268
02:11:38,845 --> 02:11:40,913
We would have managed.
- Don't be silly

1269
02:11:41,282 --> 02:11:43,251
How would you go back
home alone, and at this hour?

1270
02:11:43,852 --> 02:11:47,482
Son, you never know
who you might meet on the way

1271
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:51,029
Sir, I get off here

1272
02:11:55,302 --> 02:11:57,300
Thank you, sir.
- Sure

1273
02:11:59,209 --> 02:12:01,507
Won't you get out and
thank your friend Sanju?

1274
02:12:02,045 --> 02:12:03,943
Go ahead. It's okay

1275
02:12:05,884 --> 02:12:08,045
Good night, Lucky!

1276
02:12:16,601 --> 02:12:17,567
Hold it!

1277
02:12:19,904 --> 02:12:22,465
What the hell is happening?
Ram, a gun?

1278
02:12:22,908 --> 02:12:25,307
Sir, please just keep driving.
Move it!

1279
02:12:26,581 --> 02:12:28,551
What's going on, Ram?
- Towards the hostel! I'll explain

1280
02:12:28,985 --> 02:12:30,213
Pull over, sir

1281
02:12:40,334 --> 02:12:43,596
Sanjana, your dad is here.
Go and talk to him

1282
02:12:55,891 --> 02:12:59,592
I'm sorry, Papa.
- No, my dear. I'm sorry

1283
02:13:04,233 --> 02:13:07,165
Thanks for dropping us here, sir.
- It was my duty

1284
02:13:10,042 --> 02:13:12,175
So you're in the army?

1285
02:13:14,918 --> 02:13:16,284
Major Ram, sir

1286
02:13:17,923 --> 02:13:20,489
Major, impressive

1287
02:13:21,461 --> 02:13:26,357
Glad to know that country's security
is in such able hands

1288
02:13:28,002 --> 02:13:30,595
Any doubts, sir?
- Absolutely not

1289
02:13:31,341 --> 02:13:32,668
Good night.
- Good night

1290
02:13:40,889 --> 02:13:42,516
Papa... Ram?

1291
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:46,526
I had sent Ram,
for your protection

1292
02:14:09,630 --> 02:14:10,892
So...

1293
02:14:15,538 --> 02:14:17,506
you're in the army, right?

1294
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:19,668
No... yes ma'am

1295
02:14:22,282 --> 02:14:25,110
You're here to protect Sanjana?

1296
02:14:26,955 --> 02:14:29,581
Yes... yes ma'am

1297
02:14:32,996 --> 02:14:37,331
So you never really were my student?

1298
02:14:38,603 --> 02:14:42,764
Yes ma'am... I mean, no ma'am

1299
02:14:51,323 --> 02:14:53,252
Happy Teacher's Day

1300
02:14:58,066 --> 02:14:59,898
Thank you, sir... ma'am

1301
02:15:01,269 --> 02:15:03,238
Ram! Come in, come in, Ram!

1302
02:15:04,008 --> 02:15:07,544
Sir, we should congratulate
Major Ram on his successful mission

1303
02:15:07,946 --> 02:15:10,115
Has he succeeded?
Very good

1304
02:15:10,282 --> 02:15:12,280
So you finally
found Lakshman Prasad Sharma

1305
02:15:15,491 --> 02:15:18,927
No sir. Sanjana Bakshi.
General Bakshi's daughter

1306
02:15:19,162 --> 02:15:21,162
General Bakshi? Does he want
admission to the college as well?

1307
02:15:21,232 --> 02:15:23,197
No, General Bakshi is not joining

1308
02:15:26,674 --> 02:15:29,138
Sir, I have a request.
- Feel free to speak, Maximus

1309
02:15:30,545 --> 02:15:32,713
I'd like to stay here a bit longer

1310
02:15:33,316 --> 02:15:35,945
Then you must have lunch and go
- No, I mean...

1311
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,051
I'd like to stay in college
for a few more days

1312
02:15:38,256 --> 02:15:40,587
Then stay till graduation.
- Okay

1313
02:15:41,261 --> 02:15:44,798
But please don't
mention this to anyone

1314
02:15:45,266 --> 02:15:46,461
Top secret?

1315
02:15:49,005 --> 02:15:53,009
Sir!
- Of course. Anything for the army

1316
02:15:54,714 --> 02:15:57,110
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

1317
02:16:01,055 --> 02:16:03,183
Lakshman Sharma. Lucky, right?

1318
02:16:03,426 --> 02:16:06,791
His distant relative. Had come
all the way here to find him

1319
02:16:08,433 --> 02:16:09,501
Lucky me

1320
02:16:10,437 --> 02:16:12,337
You have 6 hours

1321
02:16:12,773 --> 02:16:16,465
Find out the relationship between
Major Ram And Lakshman Prasad

1322
02:16:17,112 --> 02:16:19,445
So, when do you plan to
tell your mother?

1323
02:16:19,982 --> 02:16:22,381
Even Sanjana has agreed
to protection

1324
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:26,053
You must reveal your identity...
- I know, Chandni

1325
02:16:27,494 --> 02:16:29,154
But I'm apprehensive

1326
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:35,739
So Lucky Sharma is
Shekhar Sharma's son

1327
02:16:36,273 --> 02:16:39,343
Ram's step-brother.
Sweet

1328
02:16:39,712 --> 02:16:42,611
Look Ram, if they find out
from elsewhere...

1329
02:16:42,950 --> 02:16:45,449
then they are bound to feel that
you deliberately deceived them

1330
02:16:47,289 --> 02:16:51,689
And once they know who you are
I'm sure they'll love you even more

1331
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:57,028
I see. So once you found out,
you loved me even more, eh?

1332
02:16:57,637 --> 02:16:59,206
Any doubts?

1333
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,676
Gentlemen, get ready for action!

1334
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:06,641
Tomorrow Major Ram will leave
for a long exile

1335
02:17:12,425 --> 02:17:15,686
Keep watching dad,
this time mom will accept me

1336
02:17:17,233 --> 02:17:19,301
Lakshman will, too

1337
02:17:40,633 --> 02:17:41,998
Hello Ma

1338
02:17:42,403 --> 02:17:43,470
Lucky...

1339
02:17:46,041 --> 02:17:47,008
Mother...

1340
02:17:48,377 --> 02:17:51,006
I want to say some thing...

1341
02:17:52,049 --> 02:17:55,119
to both of you actually

1342
02:18:02,130 --> 02:18:04,623
Ram, you're Shekhar Sharma's son?

1343
02:18:12,077 --> 02:18:14,807
And you never even mentioned it to me?
The army officers told me

1344
02:18:15,482 --> 02:18:18,043
He's quite a wretch,
but a very dear friend

1345
02:18:18,419 --> 02:18:21,219
We were in the same college.
Can you give me his address?

1346
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:23,420
Or a contact number?

1347
02:18:28,836 --> 02:18:30,836
Is everything okay, son?

1348
02:18:38,382 --> 02:18:41,211
Looks like I've come
at the wrong time

1349
02:18:42,389 --> 02:18:43,354
Goodbye

1350
02:18:53,069 --> 02:18:56,732
Mother I... I was just going
to tell you this...

1351
02:18:57,076 --> 02:18:59,145
Just don't say anything!
Not a word! Shut up

1352
02:18:59,413 --> 02:19:01,382
Mother, I hope you understand
why I behaved like this

1353
02:19:01,648 --> 02:19:05,882
One more word Ram and...
- No Lakshman. Let him speak

1354
02:19:07,090 --> 02:19:09,359
I do want to know
why he behaved like this

1355
02:19:10,162 --> 02:19:13,531
Tell me, why did you sneak
into our lives?

1356
02:19:17,173 --> 02:19:22,073
Did you think we'd accept you, and
forget everything?

1357
02:19:24,348 --> 02:19:27,848
Will I forget the twenty years
I spent like a widow?

1358
02:19:29,456 --> 02:19:31,824
Twenty years,
which will never return

1359
02:19:34,563 --> 02:19:37,659
Did you think that if you
escort me to the temple once...

1360
02:19:38,134 --> 02:19:41,165
and touch my feet,
everything will be set right?

1361
02:19:41,874 --> 02:19:43,272
No, Ma

1362
02:19:44,075 --> 02:19:48,342
Wounds twenty years deep do not
get filled in twenty days, Ram

1363
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:54,254
Go, tell your father that
we don't need him anymore...

1364
02:19:55,092 --> 02:19:57,161
we're used to living without him

1365
02:19:57,530 --> 02:20:00,800
And this is his penance too,
to live without us...

1366
02:20:01,101 --> 02:20:02,863
and die without seeing our faces

1367
02:20:05,673 --> 02:20:08,607
Pack up and leave

1368
02:20:11,817 --> 02:20:14,282
There's no place
in my home for you even today

1369
02:20:46,098 --> 02:20:47,826
Just a minute, Ram

1370
02:20:51,173 --> 02:20:52,866
What were you hoping to achieve?

1371
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:58,879
Why did you do all this?
Why?

1372
02:21:01,355 --> 02:21:03,956
I had come here to fulfill
my father's last wish

1373
02:21:11,804 --> 02:21:18,945
You were right. His penance was
to live without seeing the two of you

1374
02:21:21,149 --> 02:21:23,419
And... he died without seeing
the two of you

1375
02:21:36,171 --> 02:21:38,340
He loved you a lot

1376
02:21:40,112 --> 02:21:42,939
Lucky, he gave me his ashes

1377
02:21:46,687 --> 02:21:51,416
I just wanted to untie the family.
That's all

1378
02:21:53,596 --> 02:21:56,188
Even though I knew
I would never be accepted

1379
02:21:59,136 --> 02:22:00,765
I'm sorry

1380
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:18,848
"Bonds that break..."

1381
02:23:19,521 --> 02:23:22,517
"loved ones ache"

1382
02:23:23,994 --> 02:23:28,724
"I hope the miles finds a bridge"

1383
02:23:29,401 --> 02:23:32,169
"Why does this happen?"

1384
02:23:32,672 --> 02:23:35,669
"Why does the heart bleed?"

1385
02:23:36,912 --> 02:23:42,118
"Why am I tongue-tied?"

1386
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:55,866
"I leave my dearest here
and how..." (2x)

1387
02:23:57,573 --> 02:24:03,138
"I walk alone, I'm here now"

1388
02:24:03,951 --> 02:24:09,157
"It's me who found love,
yet lost it"

1389
02:24:10,394 --> 02:24:16,159
"Here I am...
restless and unsettled"

1390
02:24:37,967 --> 02:24:38,865
Sir

1391
02:24:39,235 --> 02:24:41,203
Yes, sir.
What?

1392
02:24:43,875 --> 02:24:47,813
Sanju, look up.
Say hello to your dad

1393
02:24:48,282 --> 02:24:51,150
So what now, General Bakshi?
Sanjana's with me now

1394
02:24:51,787 --> 02:24:53,721
Are you still ready
to sacrifice her...

1395
02:24:54,289 --> 02:24:55,257
him...

1396
02:24:56,528 --> 02:24:57,594
him...

1397
02:24:59,531 --> 02:25:00,624
and all the others?

1398
02:25:00,833 --> 02:25:03,860
I don't think so, Gen. Bakshi.
Project Milaap (Unity) is finished!

1399
02:25:04,539 --> 02:25:05,838
I have a few more demands

1400
02:25:06,209 --> 02:25:09,339
My soldier Khan's release,
a helicopter...

1401
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:12,616
and my favorite student Major Ram

1402
02:25:18,492 --> 02:25:21,090
His education is still incomplete

1403
02:25:38,255 --> 02:25:40,485
Check the corridors again
- Sir

1404
02:25:47,668 --> 02:25:49,159
Breaking news this evening!

1405
02:25:49,336 --> 02:25:52,469
The Pakistan General has announced
that on 15th August...

1406
02:25:52,474 --> 02:25:57,504
they will reciprocate by returning
Indian POW's to India as well

1407
02:25:57,914 --> 02:25:59,779
If one extends such a warm hand
of friendship...

1408
02:25:59,985 --> 02:26:01,886
even Pakistan isn't so cold as to
not reciprocate

1409
02:26:02,289 --> 02:26:06,991
It's a pity that
we didn't take the first step

1410
02:26:07,630 --> 02:26:10,529
We've won. Now he'll have
to release those kids

1411
02:26:10,832 --> 02:26:13,803
Nothing has changed, General.
Pakistan can do what they want

1412
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:16,907
You will not release the enemy

1413
02:26:18,146 --> 02:26:22,213
And by the way, I hope Khan
is near the helicopter...

1414
02:26:22,951 --> 02:26:25,380
and Ram has been tied up

1415
02:26:26,156 --> 02:26:29,819
Because Sanjana and her friends
have very little time left

1416
02:26:30,495 --> 02:26:33,226
But sir, didn't we say that
if Pakistan releases our prisoners...

1417
02:26:33,433 --> 02:26:38,235
An old habit of theirs. One hand
tries to put balm on the wound...

1418
02:26:38,774 --> 02:26:41,334
and the other hand hides a dagger
for the attack

1419
02:26:42,212 --> 02:26:44,181
Now you guys, get back
to your stations.

1420
02:26:44,649 --> 02:26:46,845
We're expecting guests

1421
02:26:57,868 --> 02:27:02,031
Call the Prime minister's office,
and tell him that...

1422
02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:05,375
Project Milaap has been
indefinitely postponed

1423
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:08,704
Inform the Pakistani Ambassador as well

1424
02:27:10,447 --> 02:27:11,641
No, sir

1425
02:27:13,116 --> 02:27:15,316
Sir, please don't do this.
- No Ram

1426
02:27:15,719 --> 02:27:19,819
There's a mother out there
who waits for her son

1427
02:27:20,522 --> 02:27:23,020
Tomorrow there will be
several mothers sitting outside

1428
02:27:26,495 --> 02:27:29,318
What will I possibly tell them?
That for fifty Pakistani prisoners...

1429
02:27:29,631 --> 02:27:31,324
I had to sacrifice their children?

1430
02:27:32,332 --> 02:27:35,660
Not fifty Pakistanis, sir.
It was you who used to say that...

1431
02:27:36,036 --> 02:27:41,835
it's not about ten Indians or
Pakistanis but thousands of soldiers

1432
02:27:42,676 --> 02:27:46,336
It's about the common people
in these countries. It's about us

1433
02:27:47,178 --> 02:27:50,347
It's a question of a feud which
neither of us chose voluntarily

1434
02:27:50,482 --> 02:27:52,743
I know, Ram.
I understand this very well

1435
02:27:54,651 --> 02:27:58,778
But maybe we need to wait
for that friendship a bit longer

1436
02:27:59,023 --> 02:28:01,353
Sorry sir, but how long?

1437
02:28:02,091 --> 02:28:05,020
Today, after eons, Pakistan has
extended a friendly hand towards us

1438
02:28:06,363 --> 02:28:09,794
If we retract now, it would mean
another fifty years of feuding

1439
02:28:10,767 --> 02:28:13,033
And this time sir,
we would have chosen it

1440
02:28:13,268 --> 02:28:16,926
What happens to those children, Ram?
- Don't worry about the kids, sir

1441
02:28:17,471 --> 02:28:21,974
I promise you. Tomorrow, before dawn,
all the kids will be free

1442
02:28:22,643 --> 02:28:25,969
Please cancel your order, sir.
Prepare for Project Milaap

1443
02:28:32,318 --> 02:28:35,382
Didn't you ask if Pakistan was ready
to release our prisoners too, Khan?

1444
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:39,852
You believed that Pakistan
would laugh at us...

1445
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:45,920
but Pakistan is reciprocating.
Like us, Pakistan also wants peace

1446
02:28:47,497 --> 02:28:50,429
Yes, Pakistan is
releasing our prisoners

1447
02:28:53,369 --> 02:28:57,669
Now what can Raghavan achieve
by killing those innocent children?

1448
02:28:58,106 --> 02:29:00,075
Whatever he's doing,
it's for the country, Major Ram

1449
02:29:00,441 --> 02:29:04,102
No, Khan. Major Raghavan Datta,
ex-army, court-martialled...

1450
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:06,870
is doing nothing for the country.
Nothing

1451
02:29:08,083 --> 02:29:11,351
Did you know that he had son
who was killed in Kashmir...

1452
02:29:11,653 --> 02:29:13,346
by terrorists such as you

1453
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,787
But Raghavan believes that
Pakistanis killed him

1454
02:29:16,489 --> 02:29:18,047
Raghavan is doing nothing
for this country

1455
02:29:18,391 --> 02:29:20,358
He is just carrying out
a misplaced vendetta

1456
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:23,358
It's just revenge, Khan.
- Impossible, Major Ram. You're lying

1457
02:29:23,962 --> 02:29:26,360
Raghavan had said...
- Raghavan lied to you, Khan

1458
02:29:26,866 --> 02:29:30,028
Didn't you say your war
is for the country?

1459
02:29:31,436 --> 02:29:33,703
Well, tomorrow the gun will be
in your hand

1460
02:29:35,107 --> 02:29:40,468
Choose. Will you fight
for you country or for Raghavan?

1461
02:30:06,066 --> 02:30:08,895
You lost your home, your husband
because of me once

1462
02:30:10,703 --> 02:30:12,671
I won't let you lose your son

1463
02:30:15,073 --> 02:30:17,342
I assure you,
Lakshman will not be harmed

1464
02:30:19,377 --> 02:30:21,342
I'm here now

1465
02:30:29,185 --> 02:30:30,346
Ram...

1466
02:30:34,590 --> 02:30:38,350
I want both my sons back

1467
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:56,627
Khan...

1468
02:31:58,129 --> 02:32:00,298
Are you okay?
- I'm fine, sir

1469
02:32:05,336 --> 02:32:07,861
Major, I thought you are
the very best

1470
02:32:08,505 --> 02:32:11,735
I was right in front of you
and you couldn't even recognize me

1471
02:32:12,508 --> 02:32:13,998
Let the children go, Raghavan

1472
02:32:15,244 --> 02:32:19,303
You've got what you wanted and
Pakistan is also cooperating with us

1473
02:32:20,348 --> 02:32:22,317
Yeah, yeah. I heard

1474
02:32:23,685 --> 02:32:26,650
It is this naivety
that will sink us eventually

1475
02:32:26,988 --> 02:32:29,988
No Raghavan. People like you
will sink us

1476
02:32:30,791 --> 02:32:34,023
You only know to hate, shed blood

1477
02:32:35,027 --> 02:32:37,826
You are so used to violence that
you can't bear the idea of peace

1478
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:41,260
But there will be peace,
there will be understanding

1479
02:32:42,101 --> 02:32:44,929
And there will be friendship
- No friendship with Pakistan, Ram!

1480
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:50,866
Only war.
And one result. Pakistan's defeat

1481
02:32:51,875 --> 02:32:53,942
Only then can the blood
on their hands...

1482
02:32:55,312 --> 02:33:00,716
wipe away all the blood shed,
our soldiers, my son...

1483
02:33:01,118 --> 02:33:04,286
who had nothing to do with the war.
Why did the Pakistanis kill him?

1484
02:33:07,323 --> 02:33:10,883
His body lay atop a hill
in Kashmir for two days...

1485
02:33:12,993 --> 02:33:15,618
on ice.
No one ever knew

1486
02:33:17,564 --> 02:33:20,961
Ram, there will be no friendship
with Pakistan. I won't let it happen!

1487
02:33:21,534 --> 02:33:23,828
You should think real hard
before you hate, Raghavan...

1488
02:33:24,403 --> 02:33:26,894
because one day you will become
exactly that what you detest the most

1489
02:33:27,339 --> 02:33:28,305
Shut up, Ram

1490
02:33:28,272 --> 02:33:30,972
Now you are going to kill
these innocent kids...

1491
02:33:31,343 --> 02:33:34,008
and become what you once
hated the most. A filthy murderer!

1492
02:33:34,345 --> 02:33:35,311
Silence!

1493
02:33:37,147 --> 02:33:39,844
He has the blood of innocent people,
kids, on his hands

1494
02:33:40,283 --> 02:33:41,978
I say shut up, Ram.
- Project Milaap won't stop.

1495
02:33:43,286 --> 02:33:45,512
Project Milaap won't stop.
You've lost, Raghavan

1496
02:33:45,554 --> 02:33:46,486
Silence!

1497
02:33:47,755 --> 02:33:50,050
Go on, kill these kids
and avenge your son

1498
02:33:51,893 --> 02:33:54,589
It won't stop Project Milaap.
You have lost, Raghavan

1499
02:33:56,564 --> 02:33:57,530
Khan!

1500
02:34:00,033 --> 02:34:02,263
No Khan. No, don't Khan

1501
02:34:04,771 --> 02:34:06,766
Khan, don't

1502
02:34:07,307 --> 02:34:09,274
Khan don't shoot. Damn it!

1503
02:34:11,676 --> 02:34:13,937
Not now, Khan.
Put your gun down

1504
02:35:15,532 --> 02:35:18,524
My war is still for my country.
- Khan...

1505
02:35:18,702 --> 02:35:20,869
Fulfill the promise you made
to your mother

1506
02:35:22,071 --> 02:35:23,936
We may not meet again.

1507
02:35:26,407 --> 02:35:28,272
I wish you peace, Major

1508
02:35:32,312 --> 02:35:33,939
You too, Khan

1509
02:35:39,619 --> 02:35:43,016
Until Project Milaap
is cancelled, we will stay here

1510
02:35:43,155 --> 02:35:44,917
And what if it doesn't stop?

1511
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:49,229
We'll have to kill the kids, Khan

1512
02:35:49,895 --> 02:35:51,223
Shoot them

1513
02:36:10,612 --> 02:36:12,046
Major Ram... Major Ram!

1514
02:36:17,352 --> 02:36:20,252
Hey shut up. Major Ram is dead!

1515
02:36:20,655 --> 02:36:22,623
They killed Major Ram!
Murderers!

1516
02:36:23,323 --> 02:36:26,623
You are a very bad man.
- Shut up and sit there!

1517
02:36:27,761 --> 02:36:29,593
Captain Roy, go check outside

1518
02:36:38,002 --> 02:36:39,469
There's no one outside

1519
02:36:42,307 --> 02:36:43,274
Sit quietly

1520
02:36:43,709 --> 02:36:45,869
Captain Mahesh,
there's no one there

1521
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:29,246
Let go!

1522
02:37:40,391 --> 02:37:41,857
Calling all stations.

1523
02:37:42,193 --> 02:37:45,261
Come in. Rai... Rai...
Mahesh

1524
02:37:47,197 --> 02:37:48,491
What the hell!

1525
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:00,835
What about you?
- Please, please... go away please go

1526
02:38:01,309 --> 02:38:02,936
Move it! Go

1527
02:38:09,383 --> 02:38:12,283
I have to do something for father.
Please go!

1528
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:14,987
Go

1529
02:38:50,618 --> 02:38:52,586
Go. Find him now.
Quick

1530
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:58,256
Why did you do this Khan?
Why did you deceive me?

1531
02:38:59,292 --> 02:39:02,891
No, it was you who
deceived us, Raghavan

1532
02:39:03,995 --> 02:39:07,265
I supported you for our country...

1533
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:11,034
not to avenge your son.
- Khan!

1534
02:39:12,104 --> 02:39:16,940
It's not a personal war, Raghavan.
It's not a personal war, damn it!

1535
02:39:18,008 --> 02:39:21,466
It always is, Khan. It always is

1536
02:39:43,062 --> 02:39:45,754
Ram... Ram

1537
02:39:46,766 --> 02:39:48,934
What happen?
- I saw them escape, Commander

1538
02:39:49,268 --> 02:39:52,237
I was fixing explosives on the roof.
- Major Ram can't escape!

1539
02:39:53,239 --> 02:39:54,930
Go find him damn it!

1540
02:39:58,577 --> 02:40:00,844
You won't come out
like this, Ram

1541
02:40:10,354 --> 02:40:11,912
Lucky! What are you doing?

1542
02:40:12,388 --> 02:40:13,946
Sanju, I can't leave my brother
alone in there

1543
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:16,257
Lucky, don't go... please don't go

1544
02:40:16,891 --> 02:40:18,861
Sanju, he's my brother

1545
02:40:20,295 --> 02:40:23,056
Don't go... please.
- He's my brother

1546
02:40:26,267 --> 02:40:28,735
Ram... Ram

1547
02:40:33,106 --> 02:40:36,672
Why scream? If you call from
your heart, you will even find God

1548
02:40:38,744 --> 02:40:42,645
The sun is rising. No one can stop
Project Milaap now. Not even you

1549
02:40:44,717 --> 02:40:47,214
In five minutes the army will be here
to arrest you, Raghavan

1550
02:40:49,153 --> 02:40:51,221
You have truly lost

1551
02:40:51,656 --> 02:40:54,886
I'm the one with the gun, Ram.
How can I lose?

1552
02:40:56,360 --> 02:41:00,922
I can finish you off in a second and
parcel you to your father if I wish

1553
02:41:02,365 --> 02:41:07,903
But, I'm sure he can wait
another five minutes

1554
02:41:11,173 --> 02:41:12,900
Five minutes, Ram

1555
02:43:09,709 --> 02:43:11,267
Hurry up, Captain!

1556
02:44:01,587 --> 02:44:05,583
General Mohammad lbrahim.
Congratulations on Project Milaap

1557
02:44:06,224 --> 02:44:06,987
You too

1558
02:45:21,123 --> 02:45:25,691
Your five minutes are up, Ram.
Wish we could play a bit longer

1559
02:45:26,828 --> 02:45:28,495
I was enjoying myself

1560
02:45:29,663 --> 02:45:32,960
Alas, I must leave now

1561
02:45:36,837 --> 02:45:39,496
Major Ram, your father beckons you

1562
02:45:40,906 --> 02:45:42,975
The count down has begun!

1563
02:45:44,976 --> 02:45:46,307
Three...

1564
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:49,147
Two...

1565
02:45:50,948 --> 02:45:51,915
One

1566
02:46:31,284 --> 02:46:32,842
Sorry, Major

1567
02:46:46,763 --> 02:46:48,321
Where are you running now, Major?

1568
02:46:49,899 --> 02:46:51,127
Turn around, Major

1569
02:46:51,334 --> 02:46:52,562
Turn around damn it!

1570
02:46:52,803 --> 02:46:54,770
I want you to face your death

1571
02:46:55,170 --> 02:46:57,138
Ram, get away from that God damn roof

1572
02:46:57,506 --> 02:46:59,474
How will you face
your father otherwise?

1573
02:47:00,176 --> 02:47:03,144
He took his bullet
right on the chest. Turn around

1574
02:47:04,079 --> 02:47:08,842
What a pity! This story
has a sad ending, Major. Death

1575
02:47:11,785 --> 02:47:14,146
What a pity, Raghavan!
Have you forgotten?

1576
02:47:15,422 --> 02:47:18,152
It's always the bad guy
who dies in the end

1577
02:47:33,204 --> 02:47:34,329
Two...

1578
02:47:35,339 --> 02:47:36,499
One

1579
02:48:23,881 --> 02:48:27,113
Don't let go, Ram.
Don't be scared. I'm here now

1580
02:48:27,452 --> 02:48:30,519
That's what I'm afraid of, idiot.
Now shut up and pull me up

1581
02:49:38,979 --> 02:49:42,809
Welcome parents, teachers and students.
And welcome to Prom night!

1582
02:49:44,784 --> 02:49:49,151
What are you saying? Not Prom Night,
it's Congratulations Day

1583
02:49:51,191 --> 02:49:54,158
Welcome to Convocation Day.

1584
02:49:55,193 --> 02:50:00,352
And this year finally
Lakshman Prasad Sharma is graduating

1585
02:50:00,999 --> 02:50:06,031
And a very, very, special student -
Major Ram Prasad Sharma

1586
02:50:15,959 --> 02:50:22,389
"Can you hear the air,
and the songs it's singing..."

1587
02:50:22,792 --> 02:50:29,056
"about how life is youthful
and charming"

1588
02:50:31,094 --> 02:50:34,493
"Every moment is liberal"

1589
02:50:34,994 --> 02:50:37,391
"Every second is a thrill"

1590
02:50:38,729 --> 02:50:44,684
"Looks like this caravan did find
the oasis of true love"

1591
02:50:45,696 --> 02:50:48,991
"If the days are bright..."

1592
02:50:49,562 --> 02:50:52,155
"the hearts will delight"

1593
02:50:53,435 --> 02:51:07,998
"If the days are bright,
the hearts will delight" (2x)

1594
02:51:09,665 --> 02:51:16,326
"Can you hear the air,
and the songs it's singing?"

1595
02:51:48,203 --> 02:51:51,431
"It's a musical season,
and dreamy is the mood"

1596
02:51:51,869 --> 02:51:54,936
"How can one ever stay subdued"

1597
02:51:55,637 --> 02:51:59,133
"In life's chase,
you'll stay in my eyes..."

1598
02:51:59,436 --> 02:52:02,528
"I'll always feel you
in my embrace"

1599
02:52:03,337 --> 02:52:06,496
"Every heart is crazy
and now I know why..."

1600
02:52:07,304 --> 02:52:09,931
"this evening feels so hazy"

1601
02:52:10,971 --> 02:52:14,097
"Every moment is liberal"

1602
02:52:14,871 --> 02:52:17,268
"Every second is a thrill"

1603
02:52:18,673 --> 02:52:25,036
"Looks like this caravan did find
the oasis of true love"

1604
02:52:25,606 --> 02:52:28,937
"If the days are bright..."

1605
02:52:29,641 --> 02:52:33,107
"the hearts will delight"

1606
02:52:33,340 --> 02:53:13,870
"If the days are bright,
the hearts will delight" (5x)
