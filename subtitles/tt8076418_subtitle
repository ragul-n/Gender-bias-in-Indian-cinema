2
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:14,676
Smoking causes cancer!
Smoking kills!

3
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:18,689
Smoking causes cancer!
Smoking kills!

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:21,717
Liquor drinking is injurious to health!

5
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:24,879
Liquor drinking is injurious to health!

6
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:20,242
She suspects me all the time.

7
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:22,891
All she does is suspect me,
father-in-law.

8
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:25,770
Son-in-law,
you say my daughter suspects you.

9
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,270
Are you trying to say you're innocent?

10
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,175
Father-in-law,
you are suspecting me too.

11
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,607
I know what kind of a man you are.

12
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,607
I gave you wealth;
I got my daughter married to you

13
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:36,783
and you betray me?
- Sir!

14
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,770
Just a minute. Come in.

15
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,864
Put her on line.

16
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:52,769
She doesn't want to talk to you.

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,093
I will send her in a couple of days,
behave yourself.

18
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:59,175
If it happens again,
I won't spare you.

19
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,972
I shouldn't allow her
inside my house

20
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,323
only then she will learn a lesson.

21
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,713
Those who give missed calls
should be jailed

22
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,308
only then they will see sense.

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,577
I wonder who he is,
he's messing with me.

24
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:16,914
Who are you?

25
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:23,102
You seem to be very angry.

26
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,116
Wear your shirt first.

27
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,954
Don't be so scared

28
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,373
this will continue for another week.

29
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,589
After that, you will die.

30
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,563
Sir, nice shirt.

31
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,536
Button your shirt properly.

32
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,171
Didn't your wife come back home?

33
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:20,954
She visits her hometown frequently
saying her parents are unwell.

34
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,535
Give me one 'Dosa'.

35
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:44,130
'You seem to be very angry.'

36
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,441
'This will continue for another week,
after that, you will die.'

37
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,131
Who ordered 'Dosa'?
- Give it to me.

38
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:58,996
Take it.

39
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,172
Get water.

40
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,914
Give me soap and toothpaste.

41
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,361
Rs. 50. - Did you see any suspicious
person near my house?

42
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,888
No, sir. Take it.

43
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:15,159
Sir, my mother is unwell.

44
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:19,212
I need to take her to the hospital,
please give me Rs. 200.

45
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,212
I have no money.

46
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,266
Take your mother to
a government hospital

47
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,631
it is better than a private hospital.

48
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,753
Give me fairness cream.

49
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,766
He is right there.

50
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,361
Look, old due Rs. 70 and Rs. 30 now,
give me Rs. 100 and go.

51
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,861
You didn't give me change
the last time

52
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,834
so I needn't pay any due.

53
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:27,322
Chappani.
- Tell me, sir.

54
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:36,120
After getting drunk, I spoke against
your wife to you that day

55
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:39,944
please forgive me.
- Never mind.

56
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:43,120
Even I did the same after getting drunk,
forgive me too.

57
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,930
Hello. Kumar, it's me.

58
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,983
On the day of the festival, I didn't
ram into your sister intentionally.

59
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,713
Where is the snake?

60
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:24,172
Where is it?

61
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,715
Focus the torch there.

62
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:10,688
If it was a python,
it wouldn't have gone away so fast.

63
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:14,944
Did you take rat snake to be
a python after getting drunk?

64
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,878
You're the most dangerous
living being in our village.

65
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,674
Shut up.

66
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,863
The snake got scared
seeing him and fled.

67
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,161
Shut the doors and windows
and go to sleep. Let's go.

68
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,026
Let's go. Hold the old man's hand,
he is blind. - Let's go.

69
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,742
Come on. - Let's go.
- Come on.

70
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,062
Let's go.

71
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:58,104
Give me a detergent soap.
Greetings, sir.

72
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,982
You are always absent.

73
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,793
He will take over your store someday.

74
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,131
The telephone number you have
called is currently switched off.

75
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:37,469
The telephone number you have
called is currently switched off.

76
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,996
If you're a Vodafone customer,
you can now leave a voice SMS

77
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:42,888
by dialing star...

78
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:12,722
Mani.
- Sir.

79
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,265
Give me tea.
- Okay, sir.

80
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:05,821
Hey! What happened?
- He is trying to kill me.

81
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,564
There's nobody.
- Take a look.

82
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,105
There's nobody.

83
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:18,741
Get up.

84
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:23,916
What happened?

85
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:31,618
I don't know him.

86
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,888
I haven't seen him before.

87
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:37,483
He tried to attack you only
after knowing everything about you.

88
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,050
He is right here!
- Hey!

89
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,929
He is right here!
- What are you saying?

90
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,983
I am sure he is right here!

91
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:02,780
Don't talk rubbish.
- Hey! Look there!

92
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,915
There's electricity there,
but there's no electricity here.

93
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:10,982
He is right here!
- Don't panic.

94
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:13,590
He is right here!
- I am with you! We will deal with him.

95
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,253
He is right here!

96
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,294
He disconnected the power supply
in the electric poll outside.

97
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:28,686
I told you he is right here!
- Be quiet.

98
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,592
Take it, stay right here.

99
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:38,389
He might be somewhere inside;
I will go and deal with him.

100
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:41,470
If he is inside, kill him.
- Be quiet.

101
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:54,511
Where is the torch?
- Beside the television.

102
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:43,889
Why did you come here?
- I am scared.

103
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,376
Come.

104
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:57,808
Did he get scared seeing you?

105
00:25:58,741 --> 00:26:01,364
I don't think so.

106
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,187
He attacked you with a dagger.

107
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,349
If he is here,
he will surely come looking for you.

108
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:11,552
Buddy...
- Come.

109
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,782
I am with you, come.

110
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,457
Do you have cigarette?

111
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,230
Hello!

112
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:47,543
Don't! Please don't kill me!

113
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:34,260
Be alert! Take position!

114
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,260
What do you have to say
about the security?

115
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:41,476
Come. People should fear
to even look at your store.

116
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,868
You have no idea how powerful I am.

117
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:47,326
If I get a hold on him...

118
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,651
Cheers!

119
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,111
Darn it.
- Who is it?

120
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,151
It's her.

121
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:04,773
Hello.
- Who is this?

122
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:06,606
It's me.
- Who are you?

123
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,879
You often see me in his store.
- It's Pandi sir.

124
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,721
Please don't trouble him.

125
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:17,199
Then what do I do?
- Trouble me if you want.

126
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,401
When I returned home,
it was very dark.

127
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,899
Those who accompanied me got scared.

128
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:27,808
When I entered the house
bravely looking for him

129
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,411
I found something moving
inside the sack

130
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:33,666
I thought it was the attacker

131
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:37,378
and went close and removed the sack

132
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:40,131
our friend screamed
'Please don't kill me'.

133
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,893
'Please don't kill me'.

134
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:44,733
It was so funny.

135
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:48,014
He is such a coward.

136
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,666
But the only wise thing
our friend did was

137
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,913
he called me.
- That's right.

138
00:31:56,993 --> 00:32:00,036
Else he would've died.
Am I right, buddy?

139
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:02,172
Anything might've happened yesterday

140
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,037
but it's not the same today.

141
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,172
Nobody can enter your house

142
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:09,807
because I am the one
who is guarding you.

143
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,563
What do you say?
- You're right.

144
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,928
Will you listen to what I say?

145
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:16,145
Don't be scared.

146
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,009
Will he get to my younger brother

147
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,469
until I am alive?

148
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,199
If I catch him today

149
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,496
I will hack him to pieces.

150
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:37,158
I will hack him to death.

151
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,307
I am ready to sacrifice my
life for my younger brother.

152
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:44,726
Come, I was talking about you.

153
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,388
I want to pee, please guard me.

154
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,902
But I don't want to pee.

155
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:54,253
Never mind, please guard me.

156
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,523
Do any of you want to pee?

157
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:03,279
Go on.

158
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,427
Nobody can change decisions.

159
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,428
Brother.
- I am coming.

160
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,009
I will go and bring the sword.
- Brother.

161
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:22,048
Buddy!

162
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,954
He has come, wake up! Wake up!

163
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,480
Wake up!

164
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:17,061
Attack!

165
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:23,236
Hack him to pieces!

166
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:41,872
Don't spare him! Kill him!

167
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,710
Oh, my God!

168
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,738
Run!

169
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,588
I am putting my life at stake
in the greed for liquor.

170
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,935
I will quit drinking liquor.

171
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,579
Go!

172
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,396
Come on!
- Come!

173
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,007
Will you listen to me?

174
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:54,623
You went out without my security,
that's your first mistake.

175
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:59,396
Your second mistake is

176
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:01,731
you ruined my plot.

177
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:07,655
Buddy,
I got very angry when I saw him.

178
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:10,693
You know how short-tempered I am.

179
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:17,591
Tell me, father-in-law.
- I will send my daughter today

180
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:19,223
you better treat her well.

181
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:22,888
Tell her to call me when she reaches
the bus station, I will go and receive her.

182
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,644
Buddy, can it be my father-in-law
behind the attack?

183
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:33,536
Why would he hire
someone to thrash you?

184
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:36,335
He himself would've thrashed you.

185
00:41:41,924 --> 00:41:43,924
Will you listen to me?

186
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:48,757
Greetings, Karupaiah!

187
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:51,081
Greetings, sir.
- You're still a constable.

188
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,340
People use guns these days.

189
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,184
Gun?
- Yes. You're not aware of anything.

190
00:41:56,378 --> 00:42:00,399
We the villagers ourselves
have to safeguard each other.

191
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:06,280
How dare you?
- Don't, sir!

192
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,685
Oh, my God!
- I won't spare you today.

193
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:14,960
If the police nab him
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

194
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,371
he will be finished.
- Take him away.

195
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,830
I will come back and deal with him.

196
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:32,539
We want to file a complaint.
Last night...

197
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:40,410
Hello.
- You're Inspector Rasathambi, right?

198
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,799
How dare you talk to me like that?
- Shut up.

199
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:47,210
Do you think you're a dignified man?

200
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:49,145
Who are you?

201
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,929
You're an inspector, right?

202
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:53,588
I will give you 60 seconds,
catch me if you can.

203
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,819
What are you thinking?
You have a big mustache

204
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:00,788
then why have you become a policeman?

205
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,291
If I get you, you are finished.

206
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,703
If you have the guts,
tell me where you are.

207
00:43:03,783 --> 00:43:05,242
I am outside the police station.

208
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:07,426
If you have the guts, come out.

209
00:43:07,642 --> 00:43:12,075
I am coming. I will show you my power.
- Hello. - How dare you!

210
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:32,583
Hello!
- Do you think I will get scared

211
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:34,475
if you report to the police?

212
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,648
Look outside the window.

213
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,281
If you report against me

214
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:44,702
she will report against you.

215
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,231
You will be jailed for
seven years for rape.

216
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,334
Go ahead and report against me.

217
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:02,140
No matter who he is
or wherever he is

218
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,718
drag him to the police station.

219
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:06,139
He has messed with me.

220
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:10,011
What's the complaint?

221
00:44:10,703 --> 00:44:13,384
Inspector Rasathambi, Vadipatti.

222
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:19,178
Your first mistake is, you ignored
the victim who came to file complaint.

223
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:21,535
Buddy...

224
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:24,876
Your second mistake is

225
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:29,817
you pushed the VIP without
knowing who I am.

226
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:33,244
You have made two mistakes.

227
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,611
Three mistakes.

228
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,974
Will you listen to me?

229
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,716
Don't stop me!

230
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:44,952
Hey!

231
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,931
Kasturi, don't get into his vehicle.

232
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:51,103
Hey! Kasturi!

233
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:53,266
Kasturi!

234
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:56,628
Hey! Stop!

235
00:45:57,469 --> 00:45:58,813
Stop!

236
00:45:58,893 --> 00:46:00,910
Stop! I said stop!

237
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,623
Dear!
- Hey!

238
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:09,396
Who are you? Stop the vehicle!

239
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,071
Who are you? I said stop the vehicle!

240
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,606
Don't!

241
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,590
Don't! Please don't!

242
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,028
Don't! Please don't!

243
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,802
Please don't! Don't!

244
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:57,229
Please listen to me! Please don't!

245
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:00,450
Please don't!

246
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,024
Please don't!

247
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:33,953
Don't!

248
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,938
Kasturi!

249
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:17,769
Hey! If you do something to her,
I will kill you!

250
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,104
If you touch you, I will kill you!

251
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:41,921
Hey! Don't! Don't touch her!

252
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:46,840
Don't touch her!
Take your hand off!

253
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:49,813
Take your hand off!

254
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,467
Take your hand off!

255
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:55,769
I won't spare you alive!

256
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:58,180
Take your hand off!

257
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:07,218
Don't! Take your hand off!

258
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:10,796
I will hack you to death!
I will hack you to pieces!

259
00:54:11,023 --> 00:54:14,363
Take your hand off!

260
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:20,979
I won't spare you alive! Take your
hand off! I will sever your head!

261
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:33,550
Don't! I will kill you!

262
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,604
Don't!

263
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:39,550
Hey!

264
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:44,976
Hey! I will kill you!

265
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:48,133
My dear!
- Untie me!

266
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,117
I will kill him today!

267
00:54:51,197 --> 00:54:54,836
Hey! Hurry up!

268
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,615
Untie me! Come on!

269
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,528
Untie me! Fast!

270
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:05,020
Untie me! He is coming!

271
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:08,588
Don't!

272
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:14,414
Hey! - My dear!

273
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:18,004
Dear! - Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

274
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:22,284
Dear!
- Hey!

275
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:27,030
Let go of me! - Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

276
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:30,814
Let go of me!
- Let go of her!

277
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:35,279
Dear! Let go of me!

278
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:38,068
Let go of me!

279
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:42,814
Let go of me! Dear!

280
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,874
Let go of me!
- Hey!

281
00:55:45,954 --> 00:55:48,825
Let go of me!
- Hey!

282
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:51,095
Let go of me!
- Let go of her!

283
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,301
Let go of her!
- Let go!

284
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:55,269
Hey!

285
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,366
Let go of me!
- Let go of her!

286
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:01,334
Let go of me!
- I will kill you!

287
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:04,999
Hey!
- Let go! Don't!

288
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:09,637
Let go of her!
I will hack you to death!

289
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:12,469
Let go of her?

290
00:57:29,204 --> 00:57:31,561
Why are you torturing me?

291
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:35,063
Who are you?

292
00:57:35,734 --> 00:57:37,096
Who are you?

293
00:57:37,939 --> 00:57:39,572
Tell me! Who are you?

294
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:49,291
Who are you?

295
00:57:57,334 --> 00:58:00,372
Ask your wife who I am.

296
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:01,831
She will tell you.

297
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,615
Hey! I won't spare you alive!

298
00:59:25,064 --> 00:59:26,859
Dear!

299
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,648
He's not here! Get up! Dear!

300
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,703
Let's go! Get up!

301
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,670
Hey! I won't spare you!

302
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:54,038
Dear, where are you going?
He's not here!

303
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:57,475
Let's go!

304
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:01,259
Listen to me! Let's go!

305
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:04,210
He might come back!

306
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:08,005
Dear!

307
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:13,010
Dear! He is not her! Let's go!

308
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,837
Hey!
- Dear! Listen to me! He's gone!

309
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,264
Let's go!
- Come on!

310
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:25,572
I told you he's gone!
- Come and fight me if you have the guts!

311
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:29,637
Dear! Stop!

312
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:32,102
Come on!

313
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:51,054
Die!
- He might come back! Let's go away!

314
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,994
Die!

315
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:58,123
Where are you?
Come and fight now!

316
01:00:58,203 --> 01:01:00,858
He might come back! Let's go away!
- Wait!

317
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:04,891
Let him come.
One of us has to die today.

318
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:07,507
I won't leave until I kill him.

319
01:01:07,587 --> 01:01:10,404
Let it be! Let's go away!
- Leave me!

320
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:17,853
You want me to spare him?

321
01:01:20,795 --> 01:01:23,832
When I asked him who he was

322
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,714
he told me you know him.
Tell me. Who is he?

323
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:30,146
How would I know?

324
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:32,968
You got into his vehicle
without knowing who he is.

325
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:34,535
You slept with him
without knowing who he is.

326
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:36,159
What kind of a man you are!

327
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:37,627
You slept with him
because you don't like me.

328
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:40,372
You lost control...
- Hey!

329
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:46,654
I am not like you.

330
01:01:49,022 --> 01:01:52,298
How dare you talk to me like that?

331
01:01:53,249 --> 01:01:54,893
Who is he?

332
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,417
Go and sleep with him.

333
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:07,972
I want to hack him to pieces.

334
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,188
If I get a hold on him

335
01:03:10,522 --> 01:03:14,306
I will hack him to death.

336
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:17,506
I will kill him brutally.

337
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:22,328
I won't spare him!

338
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:28,490
Where are you?
- Buddy, he can't get away.

339
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:31,787
We will get him.
We won't spare him alive.

340
01:03:33,604 --> 01:03:37,258
I asked him who he is

341
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,734
he said 'Ask your wife'

342
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:42,176
'she will tell you who I am'.

343
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:47,160
'She will tell you who I am'.

344
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:04,347
Tarasu. - Sir.
- Did you feed all of them?

345
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:05,564
I am doing it, sir.

346
01:04:05,644 --> 01:04:08,415
Check if you have served water.
- Okay, sir.

347
01:04:22,835 --> 01:04:25,565
Greetings. - Greetings.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

348
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:27,551
How is your sister?
- She is fine.

349
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:29,159
Come.

350
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:37,538
Uncle, he is my friend Samaya,
I have told you about him.

351
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,187
What's the matter?

352
01:04:42,268 --> 01:04:44,295
I want to kill him.

353
01:04:47,227 --> 01:04:49,403
Uncle, a man molested
his wife right before him. - Hey.

354
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,362
I did tell you over the phone

355
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:54,281
that a man is troubling him a lot.

356
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:57,633
Please help him kill him.
- No, I want to know who he is.

357
01:04:57,713 --> 01:05:00,673
I want to know, if I don't,
I won't be at peace.

358
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:03,565
I won't be at peace.
I want to know who he is.

359
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:07,213
After I come to know who he is,
I will rip his body into pieces

360
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:10,118
only then I will be at peace.

361
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,956
Have you seen him before?

362
01:05:19,172 --> 01:05:20,672
No, sir.

363
01:05:21,456 --> 01:05:23,077
Try to recall.

364
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:27,213
Sir, I have only been
thinking about him

365
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:30,334
I won't be able to recognise him even
if he came in front of me.

366
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,510
Uncle, he doesn't know him

367
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:34,659
but he told him that his wife knows him.

368
01:05:36,524 --> 01:05:38,173
Do you have doubt on anybody?

369
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,348
No, sir.

370
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,767
Then, has he been troubling you
for no reason?

371
01:05:49,972 --> 01:05:53,281
We will be able to catch him easily only
if you tell us what happened.

372
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:03,565
Forget that, sir. Take this.
Just help me kill him.

373
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:16,820
Don't worry.

374
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,834
I will take this as advance money.

375
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:30,671
Sir.

376
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,699
You may go, sir.

377
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:46,302
I am unemployed through I am young.

378
01:06:46,454 --> 01:06:51,793
I am unemployed through I am young.

379
01:06:51,873 --> 01:06:57,114
I am unemployed through I am young.

380
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:00,036
Go inside.

381
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:08,265
How will I confront my husband?

382
01:07:26,131 --> 01:07:28,834
How will I confront my husband?

383
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:57,861
How will I confront my husband?

384
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,442
Sir, time up.

385
01:09:46,306 --> 01:09:49,022
Please don't tie her up in chain.
- We don't chain her all the time.

386
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:52,103
We're not able to control her
when she goes into depression

387
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:53,846
that's why...

388
01:09:58,496 --> 01:10:00,806
Please don't torment her.
- Okay, sir.

389
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:49,074
He could've killed you on
the very time he called you.

390
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:54,250
He has spared you

391
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:58,727
so that he feels happy seeing
you go through immense pain.

392
01:10:59,169 --> 01:11:02,250
I guess he must be somewhere
around watching you.

393
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:06,953
I didn't mean that. Don't be afraid.

394
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:11,791
We will finish him in a couple of days.

395
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:16,305
He's been keeping
a watch on you since days

396
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:19,710
that's why you're not
able to do anything to him.

397
01:11:26,777 --> 01:11:32,196
To catch him, we must first
get you out of his sight

398
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:35,939
and then keep a watch on him.

399
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:39,209
Uncle.

400
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,737
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

401
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:47,575
You will surely nab him, won't you?
- Yes, I will.

402
01:12:15,009 --> 01:12:16,604
They are my men.

403
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:21,050
I have summoned them because he
might become alert if we came with you.

404
01:12:23,832 --> 01:12:26,400
It's just 3 lakhs extra
than the estimated amount.

405
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,373
3 lakhs?
- Your life is more precious.

406
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,318
Come.
- Go.

407
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,264
You will stay in this room.

408
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:40,575
This is the special room given to me.

409
01:12:41,129 --> 01:12:43,169
I usually stay here for some pleasure.

410
01:12:44,589 --> 01:12:46,075
Come in, sit down.

411
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:52,292
My men will guard you.

412
01:12:53,089 --> 01:12:54,157
Okay, sir.

413
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:58,630
Amitabh, bring liquor.
- Okay, sir.

414
01:13:01,103 --> 01:13:02,711
Go fast.

415
01:13:06,318 --> 01:13:09,400
Only the two of you have seen him.

416
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,265
Keep a watch on people
who come to the lodge.

417
01:13:13,548 --> 01:13:17,007
If you happen to see him,
call me.

418
01:13:17,197 --> 01:13:18,737
Okay.
- I will deal with him.

419
01:13:18,817 --> 01:13:22,305
Don't alert him by doing
something hasty.

420
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,211
None of them must come here.

421
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:27,306
He shouldn't know that there are
so many people here. - Okay.

422
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:31,386
Nothing should stop him
from coming inside. - Okay.

423
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:33,467
He will surely come.

424
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:54,157
Everything has been organised.

425
01:13:54,237 --> 01:13:56,184
Drink liquor and enjoy yourself.

426
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:58,157
I will be in the reception.
- Sir. - Yes.

427
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,076
Please stay with me.

428
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:06,834
Who do you think they are?

429
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:09,199
Every man here has committed
4 to 5 murders.

430
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,415
If he comes inside,
they will hack him to death.

431
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:14,091
Don't be afraid.

432
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:20,118
This is the security
I have organised for you.

433
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:23,037
He can come inside

434
01:14:23,862 --> 01:14:25,564
but can't go back.

435
01:14:27,325 --> 01:14:28,997
Will he come, sir?

436
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:38,794
Hello. - Is it Kurunji Lodge?
- Yes, sir.

437
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,429
Greetings. My name is Senthil.
- Tell me, sir.

438
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,889
We have organised my brother's
wedding in PS wedding hall on 20th.

439
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:46,861
Are rooms available? - Sir, just a minute,
I will check and let you know.

440
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:48,794
Sir, please get me liquor.

441
01:14:52,443 --> 01:14:54,470
Rooms are available on that date.

442
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:56,835
If you pay token advance,
I will book the rooms.

443
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:58,997
I will come there in some time.
- Okay, sir.

444
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:01,525
I will teach you after I get drunk.

445
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:02,998
Buy two bottles of liquor.

446
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:08,524
One for you.
- And the other for you.

447
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:11,118
No, both the bottles are for you.

448
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,794
Sir.

449
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:38,103
I will do anything for you

450
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,711
because you're my God.

451
01:15:41,968 --> 01:15:45,617
Watch. Come here. - Let go.
- Shall I beat him?

452
01:15:45,846 --> 01:15:48,387
Let go! I said let go!

453
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:50,413
I will beat him if you want me to.
- Let go.

454
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,594
I will beat him if you want me to.
- I said let go.

455
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:56,724
Because you're my God.

456
01:16:11,252 --> 01:16:12,644
Sir!

457
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:14,806
Sir!

458
01:16:15,982 --> 01:16:19,751
Where are you going? Sir, wait.

459
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:36,765
Hey!

460
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:39,495
Come here!

461
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,778
I didn't have
a single penny to buy liquor

462
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:53,157
but you got me two bottles of
liquor and made me happy.

463
01:16:53,237 --> 01:16:55,590
Hereafter, you're my God.

464
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:29,064
Sorry. Did I disturb you?

465
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:33,524
God is speaking

466
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:35,889
don't make noise.
- Where are you?

467
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,349
Hi!

468
01:18:06,701 --> 01:18:07,876
Hi!

469
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,618
I want to do something for you.

470
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:19,781
Shall I beat the driver?
Answer me, God.

471
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:31,456
Why did you come here?

472
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:34,226
You called and
kindled feelings in me.

473
01:18:34,565 --> 01:18:37,645
I was yearning to see you again.

474
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:39,361
Don't lie.

475
01:18:39,726 --> 01:18:41,591
I am lying? Come here.

476
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:03,673
This room has been given
to me specially.

477
01:19:05,065 --> 01:19:07,524
I had called you for rooms
for the wedding.

478
01:19:07,604 --> 01:19:10,254
Yes, sir. Have you brought
advance money? - Yes.

479
01:19:13,984 --> 01:19:16,160
Write your address and phone number.

480
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,390
Who is he? He is staring at God.

481
01:19:21,997 --> 01:19:23,943
I want two rooms for now.
- Okay, sir.

482
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:29,618
Hey! Why are you staring at him?

483
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:33,470
Sir, please be quiet.

484
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,916
You be quiet.

485
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:37,511
I will thrash you, stop staring.

486
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:40,551
You!

487
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:45,835
God, shall I thrash him?

488
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,794
Please.
- Okay, beat him.

489
01:19:50,591 --> 01:19:52,172
Sorry, sir. He is drunk.

490
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,212
Take the bottles.

491
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:56,793
He is staring at you.
- Go.

492
01:19:57,645 --> 01:19:59,780
Go.
- Palani, walk them to the room.

493
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,632
You got me liquor and
also booked room for me to drink.

494
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:14,376
Go.
- You're really God.

495
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:19,881
I am unemployed
through I am young.

496
01:20:27,024 --> 01:20:29,308
Open the door.

497
01:20:29,768 --> 01:20:32,893
God is coming.

498
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:39,835
"You're my God."

499
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:45,780
It is the culture of Tamils
to offer God first and then eat.

500
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:51,225
So, I wish that you join me too.

501
01:20:51,415 --> 01:20:54,875
Make me a drink too, I will be back.
- Okay, God.

502
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:58,631
God, would you like water or soda?

503
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:29,564
Stop. Who are you?

504
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:31,321
I am Samaya's friend.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

505
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:34,576
He told me 'I have come to your
hometown, I have strangers with me'

506
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,131
'come and accompany me'.

507
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,927
There's nobody named Samaya.
- He himself told me to come here.

508
01:21:39,589 --> 01:21:41,360
I didn't inform the policemen downstairs

509
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:43,873
but he let me go
because he knows me.

510
01:21:44,056 --> 01:21:45,643
Call and ask him.

511
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,157
Call him.

512
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:52,130
Okay, I will go and get him.
- Don't. You call him.

513
01:22:11,778 --> 01:22:13,076
The number you're trying...

514
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:53,993
There's petrol in this,
as soon as I come there...

515
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:54,741
It's him! Catch him!

516
01:24:04,683 --> 01:24:05,818
Come on!

517
01:24:13,408 --> 01:24:15,635
Where did he go?
- Go inside and check.

518
01:24:15,715 --> 01:24:17,841
Open the door!

519
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:30,672
Break the door!
- Break the door!

520
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:41,916
God, dance with me.
- I will be back.

521
01:24:42,089 --> 01:24:43,127
Okay.

522
01:24:46,965 --> 01:24:48,911
Break the door!

523
01:24:49,246 --> 01:24:51,441
Break the door!
- Break the door!

524
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:57,667
Catch him! Hurry up!
- Come on!

525
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,550
Catch him!

526
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:39,293
Kill him!

527
01:27:29,386 --> 01:27:31,040
Kill him!

528
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:33,235
Catch him!

529
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:39,635
Go and thrash him! Don't spare him!

530
01:27:39,715 --> 01:27:41,494
Don't spare him!

531
01:29:20,607 --> 01:29:23,624
Tell me! Who are you?

532
01:29:27,202 --> 01:29:29,959
Tell me! Who are you?

533
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:33,904
Tell me!

534
01:29:36,898 --> 01:29:38,173
Tell me!

535
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,006
Tell me!

536
01:29:46,271 --> 01:29:47,903
Who are you?

537
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:54,217
Tell me!

538
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:59,610
Who are you?

539
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:04,054
Die! Tell me!

540
01:30:04,822 --> 01:30:08,205
Tell me!

541
01:30:11,427 --> 01:30:15,308
Hey! Who are you?

542
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:20,497
If I told you, you will get angrier.

543
01:30:30,455 --> 01:30:31,882
Tell me!

544
01:30:32,174 --> 01:30:35,439
Ask your wife who I am

545
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,569
she will tell you.

546
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:43,882
You're dead meat.

547
01:30:43,962 --> 01:30:46,779
Stop! Listen to me!
- Sir, I will kill him!

548
01:30:46,952 --> 01:30:48,282
Calm down.
- I will kill you.

549
01:30:48,362 --> 01:30:50,444
We will get in trouble
if we killed him here.

550
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:00,985
You want him dead, right?

551
01:31:01,947 --> 01:31:03,234
Do what I say.

552
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:06,120
Summon your wife and have her
file rape case against him.

553
01:31:06,531 --> 01:31:09,060
We will put him in jail,
electrocute him

554
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,990
and then report that
he committed suicide.

555
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:14,682
We won't get into any trouble.

556
01:31:32,412 --> 01:31:33,320
Look, sir.

557
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,141
He might run away, be alert.
- You idiot!

558
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:39,536
You idiot! I should've killed my daughter
rather than getting her married to you.

559
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:42,163
You can still do that, kill her.

560
01:31:42,243 --> 01:31:45,136
Talk with respect.
- That's how I will talk.

561
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:48,876
What will you do?
- What's going on? Move back!

562
01:31:48,956 --> 01:31:50,488
Go and sit.

563
01:31:50,823 --> 01:31:53,472
I said sit. Go and fight in your house.

564
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:54,985
What...
- Sit down.

565
01:31:56,423 --> 01:32:00,380
We have arrested the person
who killed and raped you.

566
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,565
File a complaint,
we will put him behind the bars.

567
01:32:02,978 --> 01:32:05,439
Sir, he didn't do anything to me.

568
01:32:06,758 --> 01:32:07,969
Darn it.

569
01:32:11,514 --> 01:32:14,758
Don't hesitate because
people will find out.

570
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:16,822
Nobody will find out.

571
01:32:17,038 --> 01:32:20,725
File a complaint.
- He didn't do anything to me, sir.

572
01:32:20,897 --> 01:32:22,584
Don't lie to him.

573
01:32:22,664 --> 01:32:24,000
File a complaint against him.

574
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,388
May you be ruined.

575
01:32:26,468 --> 01:32:29,665
Shut up!
I saw your behaviour with him.

576
01:32:33,037 --> 01:32:36,767
How dare you!
- Please stop it!

577
01:32:36,847 --> 01:32:39,296
I said stop it!
- I won't spare you!

578
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:40,907
Stop it!
- Don't mess with me!

579
01:32:40,987 --> 01:32:43,091
Will you stop it!
- What does he think of himself?

580
01:32:46,637 --> 01:32:49,264
Will you do what I say or not?

581
01:32:49,718 --> 01:32:54,215
Sir, I will be able to file a complaint
only if something happened.

582
01:32:54,295 --> 01:32:57,123
Does anyone know
what happened there?

583
01:33:03,513 --> 01:33:05,945
No! Don't do anything to me!

584
01:33:06,302 --> 01:33:09,545
I beg to you! Don't!

585
01:33:34,757 --> 01:33:36,249
Let me tell you.

586
01:33:36,519 --> 01:33:38,627
I don't who he is

587
01:33:38,974 --> 01:33:42,347
but he a good man.
All of you are bad.

588
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,839
Father, let's go.

589
01:35:18,834 --> 01:35:19,980
Kill him!

590
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:24,974
Give it.

591
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:16,862
You are going to die.
Tell me at least now. Who are you?

592
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:20,732
Who are you?

593
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:46,699
Father!

594
01:36:49,035 --> 01:36:50,235
Look there.

595
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:02,712
Hey!

596
01:37:06,148 --> 01:37:09,251
Father, she plucks it
as soon as the flower blooms.

597
01:37:10,645 --> 01:37:13,964
Fearing her,
I sleep only after she falls asleep

598
01:37:14,233 --> 01:37:16,331
until then,
I keep a watch on the flower.

599
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:19,769
I check on the flower even
before she wakes up in the morning.

600
01:37:20,374 --> 01:37:22,536
I am at peace only
if the flower is there.

601
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:25,433
I see.
So many things have happened.

602
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:27,217
Why didn't you tell me
on the very first day?

603
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,049
Let's go and deal with her.

604
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:34,752
Dear!

605
01:37:35,693 --> 01:37:36,903
Stop!

606
01:37:38,882 --> 01:37:41,249
Dear! She's a little girl

607
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:43,681
just don't listen to her.
- I can't.

608
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,790
Let's give that girl a plant.

609
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:48,373
I won't give her my plant.
- Then she's bound to steal.

610
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:53,607
Isn't it wrong to steal?
- Yes, it is.

611
01:37:53,687 --> 01:37:56,093
You had told culprits
shouldn't be spared, didn't you?

612
01:37:56,482 --> 01:37:58,363
Did I tell you that?

613
01:37:58,601 --> 01:38:02,007
You told me the last time
you visited us. Did you forget?

614
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:05,575
My little girl. Let's go.

615
01:38:05,834 --> 01:38:07,683
Come fast, father.

616
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,251
Please come.

617
01:38:13,121 --> 01:38:14,429
What happened today?

618
01:38:18,397 --> 01:38:19,576
Ask him, father.

619
01:38:19,943 --> 01:38:22,116
Let me grasp some air, please wait.

620
01:38:26,063 --> 01:38:27,998
Ask him.
- Wait.

621
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:32,506
Would you offer us tea?

622
01:38:32,755 --> 01:38:34,668
Sarvana is here, get him tea.

623
01:38:51,815 --> 01:38:53,459
I am leaving to Qatar today.

624
01:38:55,588 --> 01:38:58,464
I will miss my daughter very much.

625
01:39:10,864 --> 01:39:12,010
Pavi!

626
01:39:34,562 --> 01:39:36,508
Pavi!

627
01:39:44,789 --> 01:39:47,124
Like you're sad that father is leaving

628
01:39:48,269 --> 01:39:50,507
father will be sad too.

629
01:39:54,519 --> 01:39:57,675
He will be able to take good care of us
only if he works, isn't it?

630
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:02,302
Only for few days

631
01:40:02,382 --> 01:40:04,270
he will be back and stay with us forever.

632
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:09,740
You have your grandparents

633
01:40:09,988 --> 01:40:11,642
but father has nobody there.

634
01:40:20,572 --> 01:40:25,318
It is because of us
he is going through hardships.

635
01:40:29,772 --> 01:40:32,680
Don't cry. Do you understand?

636
01:41:22,701 --> 01:41:25,123
Don't worry. I will look after her.

637
01:42:12,486 --> 01:42:14,886
You will see this only
after boarding the flight.

638
01:43:29,266 --> 01:43:30,564
Did you have a safe journey?

639
01:43:30,844 --> 01:43:33,277
Yes. I came to the site as soon as
landed here.

640
01:43:33,796 --> 01:43:35,028
How is Pavi?

641
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:37,558
She was crying constantly after you left.

642
01:43:39,309 --> 01:43:41,190
I was feeling sad too.

643
01:43:47,396 --> 01:43:49,083
It's a holiday today

644
01:43:49,396 --> 01:43:51,191
that's why we came to my father's house.

645
01:43:52,077 --> 01:43:53,926
Don't cry in front of Pavi

646
01:43:54,466 --> 01:43:55,634
she will be very hurt.

647
01:43:55,714 --> 01:43:58,099
Give me two soaps.
- Do you have henna?

648
01:44:01,148 --> 01:44:01,969
I will give you.

649
01:44:12,726 --> 01:44:14,174
I am packing things

650
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:15,742
come inside and take it.
- Okay.

651
01:44:25,287 --> 01:44:27,071
Where is it?
- On top.

652
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,946
I can't reach.

653
01:44:34,692 --> 01:44:37,232
Shall I lift you?
- Okay.

654
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:58,757
Sir, give me lentil 250 grams

655
01:44:59,243 --> 01:45:01,719
five eggs and four bananas.

656
01:45:01,968 --> 01:45:03,168
Please hurry up.

657
01:45:20,303 --> 01:45:23,654
Pavi. - Yes, mother.
- Father has called.

658
01:45:57,069 --> 01:45:59,047
You said you will stay
with me for 20 days

659
01:45:59,127 --> 01:46:01,328
but you left in 15 days.

660
01:46:01,408 --> 01:46:03,004
You fooled me, didn't you?

661
01:46:03,084 --> 01:46:05,458
My dear...
- You asked for henna, right?

662
01:46:05,739 --> 01:46:07,610
Just a minute. Yes.

663
01:46:08,301 --> 01:46:09,685
Henna powder is not good

664
01:46:09,765 --> 01:46:12,161
there's henna paste inside.
Will you take it yourself?

665
01:46:15,242 --> 01:46:17,847
The henna is of good quality,
it's inside, go.

666
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:27,199
Pavi.

667
01:47:31,209 --> 01:47:32,171
Pavi?

668
01:47:35,274 --> 01:47:36,236
Pavi?

669
01:47:38,982 --> 01:47:41,112
Hey!

670
01:47:43,522 --> 01:47:45,112
Hey!

671
01:47:45,976 --> 01:47:47,912
Let go! Hey!

672
01:47:50,669 --> 01:47:52,961
Hey! Let go!

673
01:47:53,923 --> 01:47:55,339
Hey!

674
01:47:56,669 --> 01:48:01,231
Pavi, run away! Let go of her!

675
01:48:02,106 --> 01:48:05,198
She's a little girl! Let go of her!

676
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:09,653
Pavi!

677
01:48:11,144 --> 01:48:12,604
Hey!

678
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,776
Hey!

679
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:20,074
Let go of her! Pavi!

680
01:48:21,415 --> 01:48:23,047
Let go of her!

681
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:28,875
She's a little girl! Let go of her!

682
01:48:29,577 --> 01:48:31,653
Hey! Pavi!

683
01:48:32,324 --> 01:48:33,761
Pavi!

684
01:48:35,837 --> 01:48:37,502
Pavi!

685
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,129
Pavi!

686
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:10,076
Pavi was here to by henna.
- She bought it and left.

687
01:49:11,967 --> 01:49:13,286
She left?

688
01:49:15,221 --> 01:49:16,324
Where did she go?

689
01:49:25,415 --> 01:49:27,502
Ma'am, did Pavi come here?

690
01:49:27,582 --> 01:49:29,081
No, she didn't.

691
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:44,184
Hey!

692
01:49:45,416 --> 01:49:47,751
Hey!

693
01:51:24,627 --> 01:51:26,119
Pavi!

694
01:52:08,585 --> 01:52:11,373
Mother!

695
01:53:26,519 --> 01:53:30,324
How do I confront my husband?

696
01:53:35,428 --> 01:53:38,120
How do I confront my husband?

697
01:53:39,082 --> 01:53:43,071
How do I confront my husband?

698
01:54:02,195 --> 01:54:04,357
He is going to die,
but he is still being arrogant.

699
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:08,767
I have been asking him,
but he is not willing to answer.

700
01:54:08,847 --> 01:54:10,638
Tell me. Who are you?

701
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:41,318
Give it to me!

702
01:54:47,059 --> 01:54:49,610
Darn it. Go and find him

703
01:54:51,275 --> 01:54:54,854
Don't spare him! Go and get him!

704
01:54:54,934 --> 01:54:56,703
Go and look there.

705
01:55:05,373 --> 01:55:06,995
What happened?

706
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:24,163
Hey! Go and find him!

707
01:55:25,082 --> 01:55:28,119
Hey!

708
01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:31,806
Go!

709
01:55:32,887 --> 01:55:35,471
I said go. Go and find him.
