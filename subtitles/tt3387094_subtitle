Long back, Lord has told to
Adam notto eatthe apple.

00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,197
Lord thought,
Adam will not eatthe apple.

You see howthings are
going to be worked out.

it may end up in practicality.

67
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,528
No need of it.
Remembering the grandmother.

68
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,072
Before grandmothers death, that
chain was given to grandfather.

69
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,801

He isthe one, behind all this.

75
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,014
Simply luring father,
whowas remaining quite.

76
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,420
Don't createtension uncle Poly,
by saying flash back, when a good...

There with the left leg. Place it.

84
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,944
Don't pull my hand, leave my hands.

85
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,676
Really un comforable, as not
being used to wearing this jeans.

86
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,013
Must have worn waist cloth.
Gracy, loves the jeans.

87
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,315
Is it?
How is my look now?

88
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,789
Is the first impression okay?
Completely okay, you come.

89
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:26,593

Look, here. Do you have
children in the first marriage?

104
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,134
No.

105
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,703
Do you want children? I will
produce and give, if required man?

106
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,531
Hey Grandpa.

107
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,970
He doesn't know my temperament,
he will not understand theworry...

108
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,633
...of a person, who is
marrying forthe second time.

109
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,972
All that I can understand.
You give that to me.

Put here.

111
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,279

112
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:56,912
Uncle!
Who has expired, registrar?

113
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,283
Neighbour.
What had happened?

114
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,789
He was a person
who had no problems at all.

115
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,552
Yesterday, like this
had come here and...

116
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,491
...signed and gone
forthe second marriage.

117
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,925
Didn't reach home,

118
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,928
My Lord!
What is it grand pa?

119
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,157
Nothing for me.

120
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
Tell that contemptible,
fellowto shut the mouth.

121
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,927
That pig, is simplytelling
all this and scaring people.

122
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,370
Jealous of marriage.

124
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,948
I have no problem,

125
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,524
After crossing an age,
must conduct regular check up.

126
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,560
The problem is, everyone
will feel they are healthy.

127
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,756
See, grandpa
the benefit of getting a nurse?

128
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,460
Gracyamma is an angel who
had come to grand pa's life.

129
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,061
Look, I will breakthis.
That is required.

130
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:53,236
Look atthe acts ofthis grandpa.
Now all ofyou, have some sweets.

131
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,676
It should have been a ceremony,
which must be conducted at church...

132
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,009
...with pomp is it not uncle?

133
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,817
Slowly.
I have the powerto stand all by myself.

134
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,782
My mother!
My god!

135
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,889
Have some, isn't it a ceremony?

136
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,834
Look, he is a festival freak.

137
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,562
When you go to South Africa, you
must be missing our Thrissurtemple...

138
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,106
...festival a lot, is it not grandpa?

139
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,302
Father, shall we then take leave?

140
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,776
It is really busy hours atthe shop.

141
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,315
If it is really busy hours atthe shop,

142
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,181
Boy, shall we go?
Okay then.

00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:32,875
You lady, come.

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,715
Ifyou are also buay,

145
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,518
Not at all in a hurry.
Joy, my office.

146
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,252

Okay well.
Devils have gone!

149
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,142
Uncle Poly hasn't liked the event.

150
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,112
Here no one has gotthe time to
understand thefeelings ofthe aged.

151
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,708
Hey lady, we arewith the
grandpa, whatever ittakes.

152
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,216
Uncle wants to snatch
the ancestral house...

153
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,255
...saying he has looked afterthe grandpa
in the lasttimes, I will not allow that.

154
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,357
That means, next month
along with grandma,

155
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,789
...grandpa will go to South Africa.

156
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,792
Then in that case, hey girl the
house must be partitioned is it not?

157
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:21,025
My Christ, was it, forthis you told
grandpa, that must see the entire world?

158
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,725
Notjust living only at Thrissur.

159
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,463

167
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,514
Didn't I tell you girl, itwill
look good? Has become superb.

168
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,751
Hey shall I come and
pickyou up in the evening?

169
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,090
Will you come?
Why not, I must come don't l?

170
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,223
Haveyou turned little more brighter?

171
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,100
As atemporary adjustment.

172
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,069
I havetransferred 5,000
moneys from your account.

173
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,163
What is thisJoy?

174
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,833
That money was left
behind to pay offthe rent.

175
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,969
It has been quite long after coming
from Kottayam, still what is this joy?

176
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,273
Cutthe joke, Joy.

177
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:47,517
Hey girl wait, the rentwill be paid
on 1st, before thatwill return this.

178
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,951
Hasn't paid the salary atthe factory.

179
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:54,456
So the sly love, was forthis is it not?
Look, you don't question my love.

180
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,096
When we do some inevitable things,
in the beginning stage there...

181
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,062
...will be some hardships.

182
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,696
It's tough period for us, one day
will come for us you wait and see.

183
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,031
Our 'Punnyalan Agarbathis'(Saintly
joss-sticks) will be a click.

184
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,402
I have been hearing this,
for a very long time now.

185
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,509
Kurian sir had called from the bank.

186
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,144
Told that, Joy is not
picking up the phone.

187
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,009
That guy is not clear, just on
defaulting 4 months EMl...

188
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,706
...will call 40 times.

189
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,046
Diry fellow! People must support
is it not? Like whatyou do.

190
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,446
Go and meet sir, called
on getting really upset.

191
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,887
The loan was given on
sir's risk, is it not?

192
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,826
Hey girl, is it necessary to meet?
Leave Joy. I'm already late to go.

193
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,522
These are also inevitablethings.

194
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,757
It has been a month.

195
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,268
Is grandpa's marriage
and all got over?

196
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,337
It had finished in a greatway.

197
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,463
Yourjoss-stick, thing is good,

198
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,236
...good smell on burning
there is no mosquito at all.

199
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,336
Sister Shanta, that is it, we are
using hi-tech technology is it not?

200
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,212
Then Joy, bring 5 or 6 packets
can give to all family members.

201
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,517
There will be a delay forfew days,
raw material is shortage.

202
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,782
The case with the Devasom
(Administrative body of temples)...

203
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,788
...is not overyet.

204
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,552
Okaythen will meet in the evening.

205
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,026
Will meet.
What is this raw material?

206
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:14,934
Satyam Audios

207
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,267
It's not dying.
Kill!

208
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,338
Simply playing is it not?

209
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,103
No brother Joy,
will not get anotherworkers.

210
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,113
Son ofthe boss,
will you move a bit, can I go?

211
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,615
Is the job getting heavy?

212
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,413
Without the elephant dung,
what's the workfor us to do?

213
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,351
Most probably, I will kill these two.

214
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,217
Not at all hesitantto askthe salary.

215
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,256
That is true.
Must arrange it by begging anywhere.

216
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,019
That is correct.

217
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,321
Hey man, give that key.

218
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,023
Filled petrol by collecting
Rs. 500from mother.

219
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,396
Today, to see the girl at Ollur,
had told brother Joy will also come.

220
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,299
Don't you rememberthat?
That is in the afternoon, is it not?

221
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,166
There was the list of
elephants, where is it?

222
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,002
Here.
You have kept it wrapping.

223
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,281
Hasthis person and all expired?

224
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,210
What kind of coconuts are there?

225
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,322
Why man, none ofthe elephant
owners hailing from Thrissur?

226
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,085
Again, if on going tothese guys,
will whack nicely.

227
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,988
Oh! Gift of god.

228
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,530
Forthetutorand ladyteacher,
dothey still thinkyou are a gift?

229
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,762
Brother Joy, I'm a golden son after
waiting for 16years, don'ttouch on that.

230
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,532
Golden son get in to the vehicle,
otherwise will become burned...

231
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,570
...child, because of the sun light.

232
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,505
Should I take, brother Joy?
On getting down at a place,

233
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,440
...there will be some pride and all.

234
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:31,379
That is all old fashion, oursmart guy,
actor Mammootty, even he is self driving.

235
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,381
Driverwill sit near as if like a dung.

236
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,613
You get inside, my Lord.

237
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,420
Hey man, shall we reverse
the vehicle and kill them?

238
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,291
Atramp owner has come!

239
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,457
To sit herewithout any job,
is it assembly orwhat?

240
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,069
Ifwe goto some other place,
don't knowwhether...

241
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,195
...we have to do thejob orwhat?

242
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:04,272
All this candles are of old fashion,
Oh Saint! Create a re-thinking in everyone.

243
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,910
Take this boy and lure him nicely.

244
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:12,351
This is foryourmarriage,
and this is for ourcompany...

245
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,185
...elephant owners
associations suppor.

246
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,193
For Rs. 20!
All thiswill really materialise!

247
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,264
Hey man!
Why does hewant moneyfor?

248
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,625
Once Saints also
asks for money, then...

249
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,633
...what is difference between
us and the saint?

250
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,135
This is notfor him.

251
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,761
For his routine expenses.

252
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,840
Kindly adjust, slightly tight.

253
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,670
Okaythen, will meet.
Did you put the money?

254
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,350
Greeno, thistime everything will
be okay, my mind is saying that.

255
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,850
To seethe girl once brother Joy,

256
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,443
...is notthere means my
half confidence will be lost.

257
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,112
Haven'tyou seen 5 or 6?

258
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,883
Forthis one, you takeyour parents.

259
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,185
We learn lessons from
the failures is it not?

260
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,795
Hey man, this
marriage is an accident,

261
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,089
...thatwill happen when
it is supposed to happen.

262
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:00,936
She is the one who is working
as my wife now, Anu.

263
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,934
Satyam Audios

264
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,540
Itwas when I was studying in
10th, my mother died.

265
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,705
Then lastyear, my father
also became 'pressed'.

266
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,880
In case if at all we marry,
you should continue with the job.

267
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,081
Because I'm planning to resign my
job and enter in to a business...

268
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,556
...in the nearfuture.

269
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,321
So, we must have a
permanent income is it not?

270
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,760
Butthis business and all,
is a risk is it not?

271
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,631
It is riskonly, that is
whytelling in advance.

272
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:38,136
By looking my neck is aching.
What isthe height?

273
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,006
Will you stay here?
Get down from that.

274
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,708
Notthat much problem is it not?

275
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,913
What is thethrill in it? On doing
the same job throughoutthe life...

276
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,253
...and finishing the day.

277
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,589
We must put a signature here,
and go is it not?

278
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,862
On marrying me, child
you will have two options.

279
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,196
May, live likewife ofAmbani.

280
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,428
Or else?

281
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,334
May bewill haveto live
as awife ofa lunatic.

282
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,804
Either onewill happen
among thetwo, for sure.

283
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,003
Ifyou are interested to livethe life
of a common man comfortably.

284
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,580
Then, you betterselect
someone else.

285
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,843
Finally after marrying me,
don't blame.

286
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:24,521
Satyam Audios

287
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,350
Brother Joy, you are a big genius.

288
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,551
She has taken that risk,
and got married, is it not?

289
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,962
Since we have openly discussed,
everything will not come blaming.

290
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,225
That is correct.

291
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,402
You go and see boldly.

292
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,700
Punnyalan Agarbathis, operational
manager Greeno Sharma.

293
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,103
The rest ofthe things
are all a dignity,

294
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,643
...exceptthe silly name
which yourfather has put.

295
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,440
But brotherjoy,
education is a real problem.

296
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,776
There are some nut-ties, who
askthe degree certificates.

297
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,680
Tell them it is lost man.
Will saythat, is it not?

298
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,183
What is the use
of degree certificate?

299
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,289
Have you heard of Bill Gates?
What is his education?

300
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,415
Some thing was heard of face book.
Whatwasthat? Mark..Sukkam Berg!

301
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,756
Some nuts like that.
He is a college drop out.

302
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,261
You get inside the car.

303
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,323
Lucky if, studied in that college.

304
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,228
Then Greeno.

305
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,732
Don't blurt out any dialogue,

306
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,132
...dowry not required and all,
by looking at the dignity.

307
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,671
Will happen, what happened to me.

308
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,000
What isthat brother Joy?

309
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,507
Sister Anu'sfather is a person
who has retired from PWD...

310
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,169
...after receiving lot of bribes.

311
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,470
All coconuts man!

312
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,779
Not to reduce our status,
just blured out a dialogue.

313
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,219
Thought, he will give something.
He made it an excuse.

314
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,256
That idiot is living peacefully,
with his son at Dubai.

315
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,520
If l, see a gutter in the road,
it reminds me of his face.

316
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,057
'JoyThakkolkkaran'

317
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,975
The stuff is grant. But still to
create a thing like joss-sticks...

318
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:57,809
...from elephant dung, it is
very difficultto believe.

319
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,510
It is a proven technology.

320
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,777
It has got a process.

321
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,819
First of all this elephant dung,
should be dried like this.

322
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,519
Then it should be crushed. Then with
aform it should be packed like this.

323
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,563
Is it not, on a large scale
production at Sri Lanka and all?

324
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,188
Is it?

325
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,426
No one has come out an
idea like this ever before.

326
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,436
On hearing a newthing, firstwill
scorn thefore heads, that's all.

327
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,835
But still, Joy what smell
itwill be having, the joss-sticks...

328
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,134
...made from elephant dung?

329
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,906
Right, right question. Haven't
we not come with the item?

330
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,781
He is our hero. Shall we burn it?

331
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:56,832
Satyam Audios

332
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,506
The thing is a marvel.

333
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,911
But from the business like joss-
sticks, what profitwill be there?

334
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,850
Yes.

335
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,011
This is yet another mis
conception which we all have.

336
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:11,987
In lndia alone it's 4000
crore industry, this agarbathis.

337
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,890
It is only enough to get 1% ofthat.
It is completely exported.

338
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:16,425
Is it?

339
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:23,797
It is not Thrissurtown, nor Kerala
nor lndia butworld market.

340
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,462
Malayalee in America,
Dubai, London.

341
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,631
The nostalgia is all
belonging tothem, is it not?

342
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,105
When a Hindu lightsthis,

343
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,576
...does it not carry afeeling of
going to Guruvayoortemple...

344
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,577
...and making an offering,
brother Krishnan?

345
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,546
Without burning this, has any
funeral taken place among Christians?

346
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,845
For Muslimsthis joss-stick,
it is a par oftheirreligion.

347
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,980
Doyou knowthat?
I didn't askforyour money and all.

348
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,491
Just dung ofall your elephants
thattoo, onlytill that casewith...

349
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,595
...Deevaswom (Administrative
body oftemples) ends.

350
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,322
A humanitarian service.

351
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,366
Can'tyou do that Brother
Krishnan, Jiby, Jayan?

352
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,777
Yes man, what is more
to think in this?

353
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,382
My elephantwill bethere
forthe nextyearsfestival,

354
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,179
...that's a decision of Kattaalan.

355
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,718
I'm coming, Jayan.

356
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,521
Justwrite a consent
in your letter head.

357
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,888
Thatwill be beneficial atthe court.

358
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,893
Shall I take leave? Will meet again.

359
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,724
Okay then.

360
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,155
Whotold 60 in between that.

361
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,061
I didn't give, when they
asked from Pakistan.

362
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,863
Then I will give 65,
I wantthe elephant.

363
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,265
You just put that thing down.

364
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,166
Justtake care ofthat.

365
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,740
BrotherThomas, are you coming
now, on saying will come at 10 o 'clock?

366
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,009
Does brother Thomas know him?

367
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,511
He is a real kind oftiger,
justtake a look atthis.

368
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:48,745
Satyam Audios

369
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,119
During these timeswhen hearing
cycle rickshaw, Kattaalan boss might...

370
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,725
...think it is not practical.

371
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,323
Butjust take a look atthis.
Something likethis one,

372
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,488
...is our new business idea.

373
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,931
For passengers to sit,
a good top cushion.

374
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,060
Magazines to read
and then soft drinks...

375
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,399
...but forthat, must pay extra.

376
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,804
This is our Kattaalan rickshaws.

377
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,612
On comparing with an auto rickshaw
what all facilities are we giving?

378
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,272
All thiswon't work out,
boy you take this and go.

379
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,542
Let me say.

380
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,514
First of all we will introduce
five Kattaalan rickshaws...

381
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,519
...in the country side rail way stations.

382
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,918
Should pay only one
third of auto rickshaws.

383
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,752
Our compatriots are ones,
who will jump in the sea,

384
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:28,825
...on getting one rupee profit.

385
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,158
They will fall on it.
There is no city traffic, is it not?

386
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,321
That's true.

387
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,960
We mustflythe flag of Kattaalan all
over lndia within ten years.

388
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,329
Our Kattaalan rickshaws
will create a revolution...

389
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,872
...in the transpor sector out here.

390
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,670
So it is not only money involved, there
is also social service in it, is it not?

391
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,640
That is only thething in it.

392
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,213
No, we should only shed
out an image like that.

393
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,575
Profitwill come.

394
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,615
Ifwework honestly, the
management principle is saying...

395
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,118
...the profitwill come.

396
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,685
Then what happened?

397
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,662
After making 10 to 500 vehicles,
his mother's Kattaalan rickshaws.

398
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,290
I sold itfor scrap.
Thatwas really un fair.

399
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,926
His market is not in Thrissur, Kerala
nor in lndia, is this not what he told?

400
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,739
His market is in Uganda..Balls.

401
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,267
I had given case on
his name, for cheating.

402
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,210
If onefalls preyto his dialogue, the
fallen ones lifewill be licked by dog.

403
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,682
Hearit ornotwhat I'm saying.
All the money also gone, coconuts.

404
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,809
I will get him in my hands.

405
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,281
Satyam Audios

406
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,316
Hey lady!

407
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,192
You are sitting here. When l
came to the office from the factory.

408
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,490
Told that you had come here.

409
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,123
Should have waited
there, till I came.

410
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,202
Ifyou had fainted on the way,
what will happen?

411
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,565
There is nothing that much.

412
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,866
Atthis time rest is required,
keep the leg like that.

413
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,135
Hey girl, you made a big surprise.

414
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,005
What is it?

415
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,841
When you give a surprise, there
is one more surprise in return.

416
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,348
Joy, what are you saying?

417
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,890
What iswrong with you man?

418
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,659
Will tell all that,
you take the sweetfirst.

419
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,931
I have been noticing for one
month, a paleness on yourface.

420
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:19,497
Do you know how long I have
been waiting for a day like this?

421
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,968
To see a baby.

422
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,095
You eat this.

423
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,471
Leave that desire in your mind
only, had cometo see a baby!

424
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,274
Have you notfainted
because of pregnancy?

425
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,608
That pregnant lady, who
was working along with you,

426
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,580
...told you had vomited.

427
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:37,177
Forthe last 2 days, I have been
working for 18 hours atthe office.

428
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,516
Apartfrom this, pressure
of monthly targets.

429
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,455
Joy, do you know
anything ofthese?

430
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,824
Only that much.
Hey lady, I simply saw lot of dreams.

431
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,327
Saying, only that much is it not?

432
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,125
If I faint and fell,
only that much to you?

433
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,029
Wants to see the baby, it seems.

434
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,102
Now onlythat's lacking, to bring one
baby in the mist ofthese problems.

435
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,138
I will nottake that risk,
whatever it is.

436
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,572
I also thought, sinceforthetwo
months nothing had happened also.

437
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,302
You eatthis, anyway
itwas brought, is it not?

438
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,504
Whatwasthatyou told,
when cameto see me?

439
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:06,015
Either Ambani's wife
or lunatic'swife?

440
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,911
Most probably itwill be other one.

441
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:15,257
Hey lady, you take someten
days leave on account ofthis...

442
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,052
...will get some rest also.

443
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,025
My God.

444
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,959
And afterthat, the job in
hand will be also ruined.

445
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,928
What is there left? Only this
salarythat is received monthly.

446
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,329
That istrue.
Brother Joy.

447
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,499
Hey lady, that is how I learned
swimming, really has got speed.

448
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,673
SisterAnu is everything okay?

449
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,971
There is vehicle downstairs,
to go to the hospital.

450
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,876
I will showyou today..
You wait, you come.

451
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,777
Anu, you take rest.

452
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,852
Ifyou want tender mangoes,
that is there in the house.

453
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,885
Is there any probes man?
Joy aren'tyou keeping fine?

454
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,954
Whatever it is, brother
Joy is happy is it not?

455
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,694
Now happy, got scared
thinking itwas otherthing.

456
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,524
So, nothing is there orwhat?

457
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,689
No coconuts, only
because of over strain.

458
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,498
Greeno, do you know the condition that
I placed with Anu on the first night?

459
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,331
What'sthat?

460
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,770
DaughterAnu, before
we have the first child,

461
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,172
...we must at least have
one crore in the bank.

462
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,643
This is myfinal decision, on saying
this dialogue, must see herface.

463
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,579
It had became a bulb!
Only, brother Joy can be like you.

464
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,709
By imitating you and going
to seethe bridegroom,

465
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,481
...it became completely a disaster.

466
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,317
Hey man, forgot to askthat.
Howwas it like, man?

467
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,785
I also triggered one
ortwo dialogues,

468
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,984
...Iikeyou said to Anu sister long back.

469
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,026
Then it must have hitthe targets.

470
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,289
All coconuts!
The girl got scared and started crying.

471
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,922
My luck, that I didn't get the
whackfrom the girl's father.

472
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,932
Doesn't matteryou still
have gotthetime.

473
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:35,233
Greeno, do you knowthe reason
why I got married atthis young age?

474
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,532
Why is it?

475
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,041
When children gets older, brother
Joywantsto getyounger, is it not?

476
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,804
Go man you buffalo.

477
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,506
Is it not, to take the responsibilities
ofthefamily attheyoung age?

478
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,475
Then what is it?
Let brother Joy itselfsay that.

479
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,519
When we marry at a
young age, the advantage is.

480
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:55,022
Ifat all that relationship doesn't get
worked out, we can marry another one.

481
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,320
Aren'twe still young?

482
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:01,022
Look keep that in mind, don't
say that there. Will whackyou.

483
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,668
Daughter Anu, child do
you have Rs. 200with you?

484
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,327
The money ofthe ladoo
(A sweet) is not paid.

485
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,472
My brother Joy.

486
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,446
Who isthat? Is it Sudhakaran?

487
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,911
No.
It is me sister Giri.

488
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,605
What are you doing in the dark?

489
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,308
Oh! It was you, is it not?

490
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,043
How come Joy at this time?

491
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,020
Only atthis time, advocate
can be seen peacefully.

492
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:25,781
Where is the person?

493
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,221
She has gone for a movie
and had just come now only.

494
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,726
Alone?
Yes, If I tell, won't listen also.

495
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,424
If at all to hand over herto someone
means, she will not like anyone.

496
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,399
Is it not modern times Giri sister?

497
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,630
We can nab out a smary from some
where, ideally fitfor advocate.

498
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,104
Sister Giri, you get down now,

499
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,405
...only that is lacking falling
from here atthis old age.

500
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,307
My mother.
Hold this.

501
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:53,209
When sitting leisurely, a numbness
for hands and legs, my Joy.

502
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,784
Can'tyou see the T.V and sit?

503
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,716
Now, is it not the time ofsister Giri's
'mandarapoo'(A name of a serial)

504
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,288
It has only reached
8,000 episode is it not?

505
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,015
Stopped watching
T.V serials and all.

506
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:00,657
Why?

507
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,784
Showing the same thing over and
again. Really had become fed up.

508
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,793
At night I will watch the news night.

509
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,560
Look, when it isthe
time of assembly,

510
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,759
...morning I will watch the live also.

511
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,666
Will die by laughing my Joy.
That's true.

512
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,207
Boss.
What is this, calling boss and all?

513
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,402
Told that, advocate had
gone forsome movies and all.

514
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,809
I reallyforgotthetime, I last
saw a movie my sister Giri.

515
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,609
Is it so? Mothertell, that
I don't takevegetables asfees.

516
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,378
What all areyou saying, asfess?

517
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,353
Thiswas cultivated at
the company enclosure.

518
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,285
Look, as the case is
not given a judgment,

519
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,823
...this is what is taking
place atthe company.

520
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,586
Look, all fresh vegetables
without spraying any toxins.

521
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,720
So what?
Justtell my sister, Giri.

522
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,391
Advocate is saying,
only wealth is required.

523
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,867
After all its our Joy, is it not?
Mother, you just go inside.

524
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,234
Then what?
Keep thatthere itself.

525
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,000
Take itwhen I go.

526
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,637
What is with this girl?

527
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,478
Advocate, really bad time.
For me also.

528
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,055
When that Kattaalan Thomas, entered
atthe righttime elephant owners...

529
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,953
...association really got bundled up.

530
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,751
Really good.

531
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:15,389
Just look here. Tomorrow advocate
must be present atthe court.

532
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,127
I will give the fees
immediately, which is pending.

533
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,930
You go and tell
thatto the new church.

534
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:20,402
Forwhat?

535
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,564
It's not simply why, compatriots
say it's not Joy Thakkolkkaran,

536
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,072
...it's Joy, the fraud.

537
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,336
Don't say like that. It is deliberately
not giving on having it.

538
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,503
If it is agreeable to advocate.

539
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,981
Instead of a fixed fees, I'll offer a
profit share of 'Punnyalan Agarbathis'.

540
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,882
Then up on that, myfamily will be
completely starved. Tell something...

541
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,784
...which is going to happen, boss.

542
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,015
Her mother's, lawyer's
gown will be burn that!

543
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,695
Nothing at all, if advocate doesn't
attend the courttomorrow,

544
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,335
I will commit suicide.

545
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,928
What?
Nothing, told out of pain.

546
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,315
Look, it's notthat I don't know
whatyou are doing is complete play.

547
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,518
Still let me see.

548
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,984
That is enough, that is more
than enough for me to hear.

549
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,520
Then, which movie did
you go? Is it Dracula?

550
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,646
Boss, you better go.

551
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,021
On going take this sack also,
if not nexttimewhen you come,

552
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,527
...I will have to hearthe
mere expenses of that also.

553
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,632
On getting such kinds
of clients, like these

554
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,858
It's betterto end the
lawyer profession.

555
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,867
Don't forgetto take the sack.

556
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:35,975
Satyam Audios

557
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,243
Kizhakekotta Dineshan, the one
who is standing as defendant...

558
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,715
...on which cheek, did he slap you?

559
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,512
Speakoutwithoutthinking.
On the left cheek.

560
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,954
The defendant has told in the
police statement, it's right cheek.

561
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:55,592
I've seen what is there to see.
Now it would be fine on covering it.

562
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,773
Even if left or right you
had bet, is it not?

563
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,067
Had bet, your owner.

564
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:08,138
Proclaims a fine of Rs. 2,000.
Notthat sir?

565
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,281
Is it to waste court's time,
by saying all this things?

566
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:18,486
Case number 301/279 plaintiff
Joy Thakkolkkaran.

567
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,955
Defendant, Trichur
Devaswom President,

568
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,252
...Vadakkeveettil Ravindran Nair.

569
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,163
Yes, areyou keeping
well Thakkolkkaran?

570
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:34,828
Really in great dismay, at leastthis
time a favourable decree may be granted.

571
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,416
Two years back, to my client,
Joy Thakkolkkaran was granted...

572
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,520
..with permission to collect
elephant dung as much as...

573
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,814
...required from the Devaswom.

574
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,115
This is the permission order
given by Devaswom committee...

575
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,951
...which was prevailing atthat time.

576
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,023
With the support ofthis permission,
substantially a big amount as...

577
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,227
...financial assistance as loan
from the bankwas taken.

578
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,635
My clientJoy, to produce 'Punnyalan
Agarbathis' renovated the factory.

579
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,674
The committee which
came afterthat,

580
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,267
...without any reason
canceled the permission.

581
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,312
Your owner, there is a reason
forthat. What is the reason?

582
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,178
To make Punnyalan Agarbathis,
a Christian taking elephant dung...

583
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,275
...from the Devasom
gods will not like that.

584
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,011
Did god come and tell you that?

585
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,316
President, don't bring
religion inside the cour.

586
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,755
This is nothing relating
to god and all.

587
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,860
This person, who is
standing, BrotherRavi.

588
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,554
Devasom President. Is bringing
hurdles for my Punnyalan Agarbathis.

589
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,426
The orderfor possession
came from the bank,

590
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,862
...do you know how difficult
itwas to postpone that?

591
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,432
What mistake did I do forthis?

592
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,468
Forthe last one and a half
years, this case is simply...

593
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,968
...balled here and there.

594
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,131
I must get an answerforthis today,
or else I'll hang here on thistress.

595
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,472
Here?
Not here.

596
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,108
Your owner,

597
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,771
...my client should be awarded with
a decree to collectthe elephant...

598
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,077
...dung from Devasom board
on an immediate date.

599
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,083
I humbly request, to proclaim
a decree granting an equal...

600
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:00,520
...amount of compensation from
Devasom's behalfto him.

601
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,985
There is no point in simply objecting.
Is it not point, whatthey are saying?

602
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,995
Isthis old letter, belonging
to Devasom board?

603
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,494
As per mentioned in this, if
elephant dung can't be given to him.

604
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,698
Is Devasom board ready to give an
equal amount as compensation...

605
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,832
...forthe losses
incurred by him?

606
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,237
My dog will give.

607
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,607
Is it contempttowards cour?

608
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,510
No need to give your dog,
elephant can be given.

609
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,385
By next month before 5th, this cour
issues a verdictto give first load...

610
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,286
...of elephant dungs
to Joy Thakkolkkaran.

611
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,118
My heavens.

612
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,293
Soon afterthat, every
Monday Joy, can collect...

613
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,767
...elephant dungs from the Devasom.

614
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,928
Where is this decision from?

615
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,667
From here, ifyou utter a word,
you will end up in jail.

616
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,175

00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,378
...one trip to take the packing case
by the time when it becomes 4th.

680
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,577
Are you mad?

681
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,912
Notto lose the dung.

682
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,979
What is the problem in that? Till 4th,
the dung put by Devaswom is ours.

683
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,058
Not onlythat ifwe combine
thistrip, our profit is Rs. 10,000.

684
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,217
Boss.
Will yourfather give you that?

685
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,851

00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,961
Boss, look boss.

689
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:48,833
Onething.

690
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,465
At night ifwe go to Ernakulam
and next day morning to run...

691
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,075
...means it's difficult.

692
00:41:54,345 --> 00:42:01,046
After all you are very young, ifyou
are lazy like this, how will it be?

693
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,281
In your mind,

694
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,448
...are you notthinking yourthree
days running cut shortto one day?

695
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,790
Ifyou thinklikethat,
therewill no progressforyou.

696
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,624
Ifyou run thistrip decently,
then thisfactories regular...

697
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,064
...trip is forAbaya Kumar.

698
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,103
If I run regularly, likethis
my boss I will end up in bed.

699
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:30,169
Abaya, I find you not as a
human being but like a machine.

700
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,613
Like this vehicle, on putting
on switch, which will fly.

701
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,981
Only ifthose kind ofworkers
arethere, all thiswill flourish.

702
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,020
Did you get it?
Boss, oneway.

703
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,713
What is it?
Go man.

704
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,985
Look howthey arefluttering?
They are 'angry birds..Angry birds'

705
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,686
Is it not Sudhakara?

706
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,923
Nothing man go and
doyourwork, man.

707
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,067
What is it boss?
What is it?

708
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,169
Willwhack, go and
workyou fellows!

709
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,263
Can'tyou hear phone coming? Idiots
simplywalking withoutdoing work?

710
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,203
'The girl had given the
statement against the leader...

711
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,109
...atthe cour on sexual abuse'

712
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,077
Anu.

713
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:09,275
When we have children don't
show news channel to them.

714
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,887
What, is it?

715
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,991
Will get spoiled. In olden days
"Kaanana Sundari, Tuition teacher"

716
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,320
...where seen discretely.

717
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,487
Today, all the children are
in front ofthe T.V news channel.

718
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,429
Everything became straight,
it is all shown openly, my lady.

719
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,432
What do you know ofT.R.P?

720
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,403
Long live, just now told about
'Kaanana Sundari'..It's Greeno.

721
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:39,708
Greeno, is it? Come carefully.
Don't stop forfood, hey make it mute.

722
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,248
Straight away come to factory.

723
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,717
I'll reach early morning.

724
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,688
I was tensed whether packing
cases will reach from Bombay on time.

725
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,558
That is also okay and
nowthis is also okay.

726
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,598
Joy, everything is successful,
then whythis tension?

727
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,795
Hey girl, isn't it a
part of my character?

728
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,031
By tomorrow morning on taking
thefirst load from Devaswom,

729
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,005
...thattension is also over.

730
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:10,203
Within two years, the
turnover is4 crores.

731
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,113
Anu, you will die on
counting the money.

732
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,481
Hey Joy take a look!
It's harthal (strike) tomorrow.

733
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,018
God, Harthal.

734
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,485
Put sound.

735
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,984

00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,265
What to do now? Tomorrow

It's my one and a
halfyears hard work.

749
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,430
My sweat, you won't
understand all this.

750
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,540
Must have the luckto enjoy.

751
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,313
Where is this, vehicles key kept?

752
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:23,442
Where is it?
Shouldn't have done this to me.

753
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,217
Today, I'll..

754
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,054
Will you stop the song?

755
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,629
Oh! So my song is the problem.

756
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,163
I'll break his toy bugle.

757
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,835
Brother Joy, it is said that,
harthal will be strong.

758
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,337
Will it create a problem?
What should I do forthat? Should I die?

759
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,738
Said like vehicle,
I'm also a machine is it not?

760
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,274
Go man, you dog!

761
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,844
Ifthere is harhal, both vehicle
aswell as me, will not move.

762
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,606
Thisvehicle is purchased on
pledging the house, that is left.

763
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,181
There is no case, on touching this.

764
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,717
If dung was there, it can be
stuffed in his mouth!

765
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,786
Brother Joy, why don't
we call that President?

766
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,477
Forwhat?

767
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,384
Is it necessary man?

768
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,325
Call. Will knowwhat his stand is?

769
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,463
Only, then we can
take any decision.

770
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:18,468
Satyam Audios

771
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,111

00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,645
'Joy Thakkolkkaran'
What isthe matter?

774
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,088
Nothing, as Ravi sir's party is
undertaking a harthal (strike) tomorrow,

775
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,317
...justwanted to show support.

776
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,622
Is it not absurdity that
K.F.C has shown?

777
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,890
Hey fellowtell what matter is?

778
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,926
I'm with Ravi sir and the party.

779
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,535
So because of that, tomorrow
it is decided thatwe are not...

780
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,002
...taking dung from Devaswom.

781
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,003
I'll come and take day after
tomorrow morning itself.

782
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,199
With whom are you
playing this drama?

783
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,243
Drama? Ravi sir,
what are you saying?

784
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,538
Hey fellow, stop it!

785
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,843

786
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:04,283
Afterthat, on coming there,
saying this I'll breakyour knees.

787
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:08,589
Then..Ravi..Sir..Why not
I come, now itself?

788
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,824
Is yourfather staying there, to open
up Devaswom foryou late at night?

789
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,033
Hey fellow, there is
no harthal fortemple.

790
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,669
There is absolutely, no
harthal for elephant and dung.

791
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,236
Cutthe phone and go man!

792
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,734
Dog, had cut.

793
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,676
What is it brother Joy?

794
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,111
He is a real filth..Filth.

795
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,379
Tomorrow ifwe don'ttake the
load, things will be lurched!

796
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,427
Ifthis 'Thoo..Thuru' idiot intends,
anything can be made possible.

797
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,630
Why notwe ask?

806
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,189

How come these people have
washed cloths on top of dung?

826
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,695
There are people on it, brother Joy.

827
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,819
It is brother Narayan.

828
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,294
My god, who has burned
all this dungs?

829
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:36,737
Brother Narayan.
Who has burned all our dungs?

830
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:40,673
Hey boy lot of mosquitoes, any
way you have to dry this, is it not?

831
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:41,802
You scoop it.

832
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:47,506
Are you sleeping on this? Get
up I say, this is my daily bread.

833
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,753
Joy, are you eating this now?
Don'tworry, wewill scoop it.

834
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,821
You, first ofall scoop that
thing and remove it.

835
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,922
Lying like a frog!

836
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,491
Do you wantto ring
any other bell, Sudakara?

837
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,150
Boss, we also have
got harthal and all.

838
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,661
Then we came to help
you in a time like this.

839
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,230
Angry birds, will you please help?

840
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,597
Make itfasttears is myweakness,
that isthe only reason why I came.

841
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,897
BrotherNarayan, will you
not drink by moving away?

842
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,736
Heart is like a sponge, this is
enough to make you permanently sick.

843
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,776
Sick man, will you move?
Yourwaist cloth is going.

844
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,846
I'm also going to 'Mundure'
(Name of a place in Kerala)

845
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,004
Sitting like a buffalo in water.

846
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,943
Shall we take eastfort route?

847
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,850
Why is thatfor?
Take the river route.

848
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,820
There, the party is strong.

849
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,255
Look, here comes
idiotic brother Ravi.

850
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,725
Brother Ravi, are you celebrating
attemple, since it's harhal?

851
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,056
We had taken our load.

852
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,698
Hisface is changed. He is the one
who had cut phone yesterday.

853
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,390
You take that phone.

854
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,281
Will you not stop that
dry song ofyours?

855
00:50:56,653 --> 00:51:00,020
Here, people are tensed,
atthattime his 'Thoo..Thuru'

856
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,387
Why are you tensed Abaya, after 2
kilo meters, it's ourfactory is it not?

857
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,357
Brother Joy,

858
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,462
...I had promised a 'Thulabaram'
(offering to deity) with this dung.

859
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,961
I'll kill you, Greeno.

860
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,432
What is happening here?
What isthat noise, nothing is heard?

861
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,561
Because of dung's smell can't sleep.
Don't stamp over it, and spoil it.

862
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,608
My mother, brother
Joy, look party men!

863
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,575
Here, they are coming.

864
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,709
Boss, it's trouble.
Abaya, accelerate.

865
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,182
I'll not accelerate,
theywill break vehicle.

866
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,877
Accelerate man.
They have got tools and all.

867
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,479
On reaching near, it's trouble.
Accelerate man.

868
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,025
What are you doing? Take off leg
from hand..No, take off hand from leg.

869
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,125
Speed up.

870
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,031
Hey fellows, blockthe vehicle.

871
00:51:49,873 --> 00:52:08,157
Satyam Audios

872
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,890
Go man.

873
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,693
Finally reached brother Joy.

874
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,598
Boss, what have you done?

875
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:20,065
What is it?

876
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,465
Instead of stopping there, putting
hand on top of accelerator...

877
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,004
...don't make me talk more.

878
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,232
Ifwe stop there,
itwill be problematic man.

879
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,341
Now everything is safe is
it not? Go and close gate.

880
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,071
Don't know how many fell down.

881
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,971
Hey Abaya, come here.

882
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:35,278
Shall we take dungs which
fell down? After harthal.

883
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,716
That boss, go and scoop it all alone.

884
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,515
There is no case taking
vehicle, until harthal gets over.

885
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,987
What is this? Had purchased
vehicle by pledging house.

886
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,151
Abaya, I don'twantyour vehicle,
you don't have to say this always.

887
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,763
Go, go unload all the materials.

888
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,956
Take that basket also.
On getting a small gap, shitting on head.

889
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,227
Make it on the move man.
It's fresh indeed.

890
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,800
Hey you! Won't stop vehicle
during harthal, is it not?

891
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,966
Come down.
What areyou doing?

892
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,509
Don't beat me.
Move, you fellow.

893
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,418
No, don't break vehicle.

894
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,617
Move, man.

895
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,558
I'll kill you fellow, today.
My plantain trees.

896
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,127
I'll show you today.

897
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,865
Today, I'll breakyour bums.

898
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,937
Move backyou fatty.

899
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,468
Come here you fatty.

900
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,008
I'll sit on your chest and..

901
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,108
Hey you!

902
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,183
Don't beat.

903
00:53:46,389 --> 00:54:10,202
Satyam Audios

904
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,412
What is this dung orwhat?

905
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,374
Oh, this was a person.

906
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,149
How is itfeeling now?
Really feeling well.

907
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,658
When did advocate come?
Just now.

908
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,853
Is it?
Anu?

909
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,123
What did doctor say, girl?
Are there any brains?

910
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,460
Nothing at all.
No.

911
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,468
Tomorrow can be discharged,
that's what doctor said.

912
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,933
Forthe time being there is only
one case, booked againstJoy...

913
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,530
...on environmental
protection committee.

914
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,870
There are chances that, thing
will getfurther complicated.

915
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,969
Advocate, what is the
connection between me and...

916
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,205
...environmental protection?

917
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,708
The elephant dung from vehicle,
fell offto the road, is it not?

918
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,318
What more, is it a small offence?

919
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,216
Is it me, who threwthat
on road, itfell by itself.

920
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,446
10 to 12 had fallen down.

921
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,421
Sai, shall we discuss
this some othertime?

922
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,323
Notthat, since recovery
notice has come from bank,

923
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,986
...if something has to done.
That must be done now itself.

924
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,358
That is reason fortelling.

925
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:06,666
Recovery notice?
Advocate, what are you saying?

926
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,738
Everything coming
bundled together.

927
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,931
God!

928
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,143
How come, answering like this?

929
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,248
So, this thing was here is it not?

930
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:27,753
Brother Joy.
Sound ofVarghese, who is dead.

931
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,523
I'm here only.
Greeno.

932
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,823
Son, you lye down calmly.

933
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,432
Doctor, has told full rest is
required, is it not?

934
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,191
You drinkthis horlicks.

935
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,532
Will you give some water?

936
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,665
Look, in my opinion letthe bank's
recovery on factory be carried on.

937
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,870
After paying offto bank, some
amountwill be left in hand is it not?

938
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,573
Advocate, don't talk
with words piercing heart.

939
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,273
After all, there is only one
factory that is left behind.

940
00:55:54,417 --> 00:56:00,014
Ifthat is gone, I'm notthere.
Advocate, what can we do now?

941
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:05,025
On asking, whatto do..?

942
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:10,088
Last month, at Kodungallor on
harthal day, party members...

943
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,030
...had vandalised a readymade shop.

944
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,933
Butchers.
Againstthat, they had given a case.

945
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:18,632
Then what?
Boss, my vehicle.

946
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:23,108
Abaya, I'll come there now, can't
you see I'm discussing a matter?

947
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,807
Okay, my god.

948
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,510
On vandalising a shop at
Kodungallor, what happened?

949
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,313
As a compensation he
got 2 lakhs rupees.

950
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,285
Is it?

951
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:37,491
Ifwe give a case against party,
saying ourfactory was rampaged.

952
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,025
Can this recovery
against us be removed?

953
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:47,703
There is no big chance.
But still..Boss, my vehicle.

954
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:52,566
My dearAbaya, you lye down
withouttalking, let me think.

955
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,811
Nowwhatto think?

956
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,252
Good sweet confectioneries.

957
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,753
As grand pa and grand ma
was going to South Africa.

958
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,194
She took one day leave.
And had prepared all this.

959
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,491
Is it so?

960
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,691
Tell.

961
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,031
On going to South Africa, next
week don't knowwhetherthere...

962
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,535
...will be any coming back.

963
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:26,199
Whatever it is, to your
father Sunny and Poly,

964
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:27,639
...had given whatwasthere to give.

965
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,802
For Poly there is
another houseto stay.

966
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,378
In your case, you have flat also.

967
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:35,279
Grand pa my flat is rented, is it not?
But still there is one, is it not?

968
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,383
No one has got major liabilities.

969
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,284
So, we have decided to
sell this ancestral home.

970
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,625
Roy, hailing from Vellani
hastold a price.

971
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:49,926
My decision is before going,
it must be registered.

972
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,069
What do you have to say Poly?
What's your opinion?

973
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,172
Grandpa, I'm with you only.

974
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,104
Whatyou told is right. In life,

975
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,906
..throughout good times, lived by
saving and stingy, what use of it?

976
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,608
One day, must go all alone.
With the money got afterselling...

977
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:12,754
...this house, I and Gracy
had put some plans.

978
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:17,222
In the forth coming Christmas,
thinking to for a Europe trip.

979
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:22,129
On selling this ancestral home,
one sharefor me in that.

980
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:28,794
I've got problems up to neck here.
This ancestral home is my last hope.

981
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:33,841
Grandpa must help.
Must face the problems boldly.

982
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,879
Atyourage, I had more problems
thatthis. Do you knowthat?

983
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,916
It's not likethat grand pa,
entireworld is against me.

984
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,417
I alsofelt the same, long back.

985
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,990
The skill ofa business person, is to
win by challenging this entireworld.

986
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,695
All thiswhatyou see around was
made likethat, by me in a hard way.

987
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,629
No one expect a share from this.

988
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,441
Uncle, can we leave this simply?

989
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,772
What isthe value of
this ancestral home?

990
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,006
Crores, it is crores.

991
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,116
She doesn't know
any coconuts to make,

992
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,911
...that one was purchased
from the bakery.

993
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,779
Now, whatever happens,
I'm with uncle.

994
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,786
Nowwhat more to happen man?

995
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,916
Home is in father's name,
he can do whatever he likes.

996
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,288
Joy, are you happy now on
marrying father at an old age...

997
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,454
...and reaching to this point?

998
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,362
Never expected such a bouncing
back likethis, uncle.

999
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,902
Son Joy, did you try to
play with me, isn't it?

1000
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,438
Now, what had happened?
Both, didn't get it.

1001
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,065
Without saying anything,
leave the place that is good.

1002
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,472
Give that key.

1003
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,512
Then son Joy,

1004
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:49,277
...you might be remembering Rs.8
lakhs borrowed from me, is it not?

1005
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:51,545
I had written that, on
the stamp paper is it not?

1006
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:56,987
Now beforeyou get ruined on debts,
I'm going to enactthat stamp paper.

1007
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,651
All this time, I didn't make a
move thinking aboutthe share,

1008
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,922
...you have in this home.

1009
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,156
Now that expectation is also gone.

1010
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,698
The rest ofthings, we
will see atthe court.

1011
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:05,830
Uncle.

1012
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:10,028
Son Joy, money is needed.
Bi-election is going to come.

1013
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,607
Ifthe ruling in the co-operation
is changed, the place where...

1014
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,074
...our shop is situated it will be gone.

1015
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,509
That is why son.
Shall I go daughter?

1016
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:32,661
Satyam Audios

1017
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:37,926
My god, here comes that
Abaya Kumar, brother Joy.

1018
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:46,035
My Christ. Just tell Greeno, aftertwo
days on my funeral itwill be there.

1019
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:54,712
ComeAbaya, sit.
No need boss, I'll stand here.

1020
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,010
May be came out for
a walk, is it not?

1021
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,816
This was given by our
Gireesh, from workshop.

1022
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,821
It is the estimate of
the vehicle's work.

1023
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:17,736
He hastold on giving Rs.10,000
advance thework can be started.

1024
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,901
I don't have..
Didn't I pay your hospital bill, Abaya?

1025
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,659
What isthe use ofthat boss?

1026
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,920
Without thatvehicle,
this body is it not awaste?

1027
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:45,692
My life is doomed, is it not?
You don't cry like this.

1028
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,393
You do one thing go and
come day aftertomorrow.

1029
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,868
Will find an answer.

1030
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,834
Day aftertomorrow means,
is it not.. Day aftertomorrow?

1031
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,568
Will he puke now?

1032
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:59,512
What brother Joy says, is final.
My Abaya, you go man.

1033
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:03,382
Okay.
What is owner's zodiac sign?

1034
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,716
Abaya, you may please go man.

01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,119
Itwill be done, on
day aftertomorrow.

1036
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,925
Brother Joy, from where will
you take and give Rs.10,000...

1037
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,620
...day aftertomorrow?

1038
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,063
I have no idea man.
Brother Joy, shall we give a case?

1039
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:24,606
Againstthe party?
Anu, what else to do?

1040
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,901
Joy, will that be a blunder?

1041
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,176
Hey girl, people should have
some hope in life is it?

1042
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:33,281
When I givethe case,
will you stay with me?

1043
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,576
Are you getting fed up with me?
Why Joy, like children?

1044
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:42,817
Brother Joy, I'm with you.
No use, but still I'm with you.

1045
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:48,794
Afterthe accident, my parents
scolded me a lotforjoining with you.

1046
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,092
But still, I'm with you brother Joy.

1047
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,135
Onlythething we have
got some bad times.

1048
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,728
Wewill make Punnyalan
Agarbathis here.

1049
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,464
I'm sure.

1050
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:15,085
Had a problem with the pary
people, that became a case now.

1051
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:19,024
On this coming 20th, the court
has called for it's first hearing.

1052
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:22,290
Afterthat, everything will be okay.
Till then, sir must excuse.

1053
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,194
Joy, will anything of
this sort happen?

1054
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,999
Are you going to close this loan,

1055
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,797
...on getting compensation
from the party members?

1056
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:33,933
Not much, sirsomehow must
arrange an extension of 3 months.

1057
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:38,376
Within that, ifa remedy is not made,
sir can recoverwhatever it is.

1058
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,176
Joy, you understand my position.

1059
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:44,616
I can understand that, have got
the confidence it can be paid back.

1060
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,416
Long time back, a guy from Thrissur,

1061
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:52,085
...had invented 'good night'
for us to sleep well.

1062
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,162
Now millions of rupees
are, it's assets.

1063
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:59,224
My Punnyalan Agarbathis,
has also got a future like that.

1064
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:05,205
We had dreamt a lot. If sir,
intends itwill take place.

1065
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,635
Sir, you just intend.

1066
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,412
He is there.

1067
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,284
Kurian sir, one 3 months.
Hey man, what is this?

1068
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:24,118
Will find a solution get up man.
Sir, you had not putthe zip.

1069
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,164
Brother Joy, there was no
need of catching his leg.

1070
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,000
But got 3 months time.
That is true.

1071
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,303
Can get parents on rent,
but will not gettime on rent.

1072
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:46,104
Did, you understand that? Give
that bag. Brother Joy, next hurdle.

1073
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,513
Is today, day aftertomorrow?

1074
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,777
It has been 3 weeks,
since that day's,

1075
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,250
...day aftertomorrow got
over, brother Joy.

1076
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,218
My god, he has seen.

1077
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,222
You take the vehicle
and come there,

1078
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,088
I will be in front of the
Mani's. -With this hand?

1079
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,526
Brother Joy!
Abaya, that is not brother Joy.

1080
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:08,102
No man, that's him.
Boss, it'sAbaya Kumar.

1081
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,568
It's Apaaya(Dangerous) Kumar.

1082
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,068
Don't run, owner.

1083
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,107
No need to run means, you go man.

1084
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,236
Where are you going, like a bullet?

1085
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,008
Owner.
Why can't he sit at home?

1086
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,879
My leg is not in good form like
before, no much pulling like before.

1087
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,614
Owner it's regarding the vehicle's
case, will get the gods curse.

1088
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,723
So, you are fooling me, is it not?

1089
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,792
Owner? How can he run
like this, with this leg?

1090
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,986
In the middle of globalisation
and consumerism,

1091
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:40,569
...the political heads here
what value is given to people's life.

1092
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:47,972
It is one of the finest example to
prove that, this totally secret...

1093
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,704
...move to produce B.T. Brinjal.

1094
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,814
By defying the fences
of bureaucracy.

1095
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,418
We can do whatever possible,

1096
01:05:56,552 --> 01:06:00,579
...to bring this agitation of
people to the bureaucracy.

1097
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:06,288
More and more youngsters coming
to this agitation tent, by knowing the...

1098
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,623
...seriousness ofthe issue.

1099
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:14,999
More and more flowing, isthe sign of
success forthis people's movement.

1100
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,539
On running reached up to
Ponkunnam.(A place in Thrissurcity)

1101
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:24,112
Rendering special creditsto Sabu
Parathadathil, R.I.P's young leaderand...

1102
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,716
...K.F.C's youth wing general
secretary Ullas Mohanan.

1103
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:35,914
Today, at Thrissur, a small

1104
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,549

01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,475
You come this side,
let me tell one thing.

1109
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,452
Joy, you don'tworry, oncewe
are here Sabu will nottouch you.

1110
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,784
Why is he here?
Simply, just a show off.

1111
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:15,157
In this peoples agitation, some pary
must proclaim support, is it not?

1112
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,194
Leave that behind.

1113
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,359
Actually, I was about to
come there and meet joy.

1114
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,333
Whatwasthatfor?

1115
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,404
Joy had given case
againstthe ruling party,

1116
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,031
...which our party has
conducted the harthal.

1117
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,440
Yes.
In a way we are both on the same side.

1118
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,877
The case, which is going to be
stared tomorrow onwards,

1119
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,573
...Joy will have full suppor
and protection of K.F.C.

1120
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,685
On hearing that, really happy.

01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,014
Forthe help whatwe are doing,

1122
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,554
Joy must donate a small
amountto the party fund.

1123
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,360
Bi-election is going to come,
don'tyou know that?

1124
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,086
On wining this, then the
co-operation is in our hands.

1125
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,722
Then whatwe say here, are the
rules. How much do you expect?

1126
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,234
Mere Rs. 2. Foryou, is it a sum?

Even the bag couldn't bearthat.

01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,604

Where has this Poly gone?

My old friend isthere,
Ayyappan, he is an old mahout.

1139
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,968
At Thrissur, there is no

1140
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,409
...is not available, if he desires.

1141
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,672
You call Ayyappan.

1142
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:42,147

01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,849
This is your grand
mother's prayer chain.

1155
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,946
Now on, you should safe guard this.

1156
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:01,691
Then on my Annama's day of
remembrance, all ofyou without...

1157
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,459
...forgetting must go to the church.

1158
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,736
I'm very sure that Punnyalan's
Agarbathi'swill be worked out.

1159
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:16,712
Son, because ofyour good heart,
I got an angel like Gracy.

1160
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:22,046
Don'tjust con, hubby.
Not angel, a devil.

1161
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,778
Grandpa, shall I take leave,

1162
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,480
...shewill very well like this.
Is it not a surprise?

1163
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,919
Both ofyou, hold firmly
and sit in the flight.

1164
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,731
Brother Joy, what
isthatyou are doing?

1165
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,033
The case in the court
will be called now.

1166
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,436
Nothing more to tell, had to
drop grand pa atthe airport.

1167
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,735
Lucky didn't die byfalling in
the potholes at Cochin.

1168
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,640
Should seethat, the matter doesn't
cometothe state committee.

1169
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:50,710
Rest ofthe things we will manage.

1170
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,508
Brother Joy, did you see those men?

1171
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:58,484
Thatfat one is the R.I.P, Thrissur
district secretary, K.C. Mathews.

1172
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,111
He is the prime
defendant in our case.

1173
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,419
It is heard that he is the R.I.P's
candidate in the forth coming bi-election.

1174
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:07,154
On winning will become Thrissur
Mayor, really a smart Turk.

1175
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,957
Have seen in the T.V.

1176
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,828
Next to that is second defendant.

1177
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,232
R.I.P district president,
Pappan Kottappuram.

1178
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,431
Is he also a tiger?
- Real class tiger.

1179
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,007
On seeing, it's mouse like.

1180
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,201
That tall one, A.D.B district
conveyor, Nandan Kavilkootta.

1181
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:29,010
Don't be scared on
seeing the size, worthless person.

1182
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,048
It is their party advocate,
who is along with them.

1183
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:35,088
Hassan Marakkar. That I'll manage.
You don't go afterthat.

1184
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:40,161
He is not atiger, but a lion.
Did they give you any money?

1185
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:40,988
No.

1186
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,188
Then how come man,
killing by giving tension?

1187
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,608
So, all are present,
K.C aren'tyou doing fine?

1188
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,549
Had an inauguration at 12 o'clock.
Itwill be finished just now.

1189
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,311
Finishing just now.

1190
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:08,421
Then, Thakkolkkaran
what isyour new issue?

1191
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,387
I wantjustice your owner.

1192
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,222
Few days back,
had given you justice is it not?

1193
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,320
How is it possible on
asking always like this?

1194
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,523
Is it not K.C?

1195
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:24,066
This case is against democracy
and misleading to the court.

1196
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:24,696
Why, is that?

1197
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:30,404
From a foul smelling thing like elephant
dung, a product like joss-sticks...

1198
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,376
...cannot be made.

1199
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,710
That is possible. It has been some
years, he is a regular visitor out here.

1200
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,478
It's a proven technology.

1201
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:40,622
Is it not advocate?

1202
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:51,325
Along with that, the list of
damages my client had incurred...

1203
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,334
...due to strike lead - by R.I.P (A),
R.I.P (B) &A.D.B jointly.

1204
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,634
Will read it.

1205
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:04,576
On saying 1 crore as compensation,
is equal to insulting the court.

1206
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:08,080
The harthal(strike) is the onlyway of
reacting, forthe people ofthis county.

1207
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,742
Only an anti-social being can
give, case against harthal and...

1208
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,752
...the men who conduct harthal.

1209
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,517
What Thakkolkkaran, what
Hassan says is correct is it not?

1210
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:22,027
No, your owner, it is out offear
that people don't come out on harthal.

1211
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:24,291
What social cause are they saying?

1212
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,934
No, your owner, this is the list of
harthals that is carried out in Kerala...

1213
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,596
...by parties forthe last one month.

1214
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,942
What is the social justice,
through these strikes,

1215
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,204
...the compatriots had received?

1216
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:46,477
On checking that list, this party
members have conducted 13times...

1217
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,953
...harthal, this year on
account of petrol price hike.

1218
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,389
And did petrol price fall? No.

1219
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:55,156
What more, these people had
conducted harthal againstfever?

1220
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,730
Your owner, do you
know one morething?

1221
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:07,502
A party has demanded
2 lakh rupees...

1222
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,578
...as bribe for support extended
to me on this case.

1223
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,713
I had applied for a personnel loan,
on getting it, I'll bring it toyourhouse.

1224
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,421
Itwas from here only, a decreewas
produced that elephant dung must be...

1225
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,818
...collected from Devaswom
before 5th, is it not?

1226
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,688
Is it a big mistake,
that I tried to do that?

1227
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,523
As each oftheir leaders in
Delhi and Hyderabad...

1228
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,224
...were arrested on corruption - all
lndia harthal, was on account of it.

1229
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,734
Your owner, there was no harthal
at Delhi nor Hyderabad on 4th.

1230
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:41,575
All overthe world, only in our state
such a practice is being followed.

1231
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,178
Theywill announce harhal,
a complete state sits...

1232
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,904
...at home buys bottle and drinks.

1233
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:49,609
What coconut is this?
Is this all correct?

1234
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,851
Have you called, us
here to insult us?

1235
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:57,355
Don't get angry K.C, what he
says is also a point, is it not?

1236
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,930
R.I.P &A.D.B activists
jointly attacked...

1237
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,057
...my client as well as his organisation.

1238
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,965
As mentioned in this,
'ldivettu(thunder) Sabu, Paylo Porinju,

1239
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:09,934
Ayyanthol Shibu.

1240
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,006
These defendants must be
produced before the cour...

1241
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,129
...and be questioned, your owner.

1242
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,037
That is unnecessary, your owner.

1243
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,338
How is it possible, if both
starts saying like this...

1244
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,776
...things must advance is it not?

1245
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:21,815
Letthe case get little
more interesting,

1246
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,747
Sabu and Porinju, aren't
they simply sitting at home?

1247
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,819
Letthem, cometo cour and go.

1248
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:40,502
Satyam Audios

1249
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,134
The talking and
defending was good.

1250
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:49,768
Long back, I also gave a case
against harthal. Nothing materialised.

1251
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:53,075
What I couldn't do,
letJoy be able to do it.

1252
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:57,217
If, at all any help is required,
always can call me.

1253
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,911
Don't have any kind of hesitation
for it. Shall I take leave?

1254
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,785
He is Gandhi, of this era.

1255
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,624
We've not met each other,
I'm K.C Mathews.

1256
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:16,059
Not as expected, really a smart guy.
Really drained us in the court.

1257
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,604
Your playwith R.I.P, will take you
to R.I.P,(Rest In Peace) hey kid...

1258
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,871
Just rememberthat.

1259
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:28,813
Leave man, he is ourkid is it not?
Joy, we will meet again.

1260
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:37,781
New seeds are sprouting.
Brother Joy, only one hand is left.

1261
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:48,603
Hey Greeno, have you heard
ofstory of rabbit and tortoise?

1262
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,668
Why not?

1263
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:54,832
Tortoise, participated in the game by
knowing rabbit is strong, is it not?

1264
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,408
We'll also run this race
and see, man.

1265
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,549
What man?
Is it required?

1266
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:14,022
What man? Are you scared?

1267
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:18,826
No, a kind of numbness.
Thatwill be okay.

1268
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:23,098
'Will come in a moment..'

1269
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,607
The saying is lizard head, snake
dung, scorpion equally mixed...

1270
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,476
...with cow's urine and placed
on elephants head...

1271
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:39,383
...with a long pole, the
madness will be subdued.

1272
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:43,548
That is, it's a tight rope play
between the legs of an elephant.

1273
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,627
The life ofa mahout.

1274
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,389
Along with ourgovernment,
declaring elephant as a heritage animal.

1275
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,898
The mahout should be given
with lifelong pension,

1276
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,402
...grativity, loan, accident claim.

1277
01:17:56,538 --> 01:18:01,601
Until, we succeed in getting that,
we will agitate at collectorate.

1278
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:03,176
Did you understand that?

1279
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,907
Kerala Mahout association Ki..Jai..

1280
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:09,083
'Kapa', ki..Jai..

1281
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,785
Come grandfather, yesterday
had leftfrom home, is it not?

1282
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,115
You dog, watch carefully and drive!

1283
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,849
Simply coming outwith
a fish pot on head!

1284
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:18,650
Hey fellow, stop there!

1285
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,795
Brother Joy, the
mentioned place is this one.

1286
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,691
That is why, we came here.

1287
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:27,031
Brother Joy, look atthe spelling of
'Kapa' (tapioca) one more 'P' is not seen.

1288
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,966
'P' and all will be inside
only, you just come man.

1289
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,902
Careful, there is a step.
Go, fellow.

1290
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,336
Is there Ayyappan here?
One who is..Elephant's..

1291
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:36,672
That is the thing, going.
That one?

1292
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,175
You come man.

1293
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:43,885
Elephant brother, no,
brother Ayyappan. I'm..

1294
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:44,677
Who is it?

1295
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:49,189
I'm Joy. Joy Thakkolkkaran.
My grandpa is John Thakkolkkaran.

1296
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,916
Which mahout? Whose mahout?

1297
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,253
Not mahout.
Then what?

1298
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,222
My grandpa, John Thakkolkkaran.

1299
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,229
He went to South Africa, by placing
me in brotherAyyappan's hand.

1300
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,130
What do you want now? What?
Elephant dung.

1301
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,327
Are you teasing people?

1302
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,963
I'm the president of'Kapa' will
kill you, by elephant stamping.

1303
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,268
No, I didn'ttease, brotherAyyappan.

1304
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,876
Then what?
Whatwe need is elephant dung.

1305
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,969
Grandpa, had told that, it be
arranged by brother Ayyappan.

1306
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,582
Some how.
Then go and come next week.

1307
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,913
Let me meet ministerand let me talk.

1308
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,577
Just move back. Elephant,
to the left. Come here, I say.

1309
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:24,953
Can I go home and come?
Ifyou go home..Will slap..

1310
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,358
Brother Joy, is there
ministerforthis elephant dung?

1311
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,760
The place and the time when
we came, weren't right, man.

1312
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:31,921
Really high, is it not?

1313
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,035
Ifhe intends, thingswill take
place. We had checked that.

1314
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:38,570
He isthe Beeshmer, of
all the Mahouts atThrissur.

1315
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,902
Because ofthis piles of mine,
doesn't get the time to...

1316
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,100
...come from the enclosures.

1317
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:42,903
Is it?

1318
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:49,239
Satyam Audios

1319
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,114
Joy, to meet you, has it reached
that one should come to toddy shop?

1320
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,113
Uncle, to make the things done,
sometimes we will have to enter and...

1321
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,690
...go through the hell.

1322
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,657
Even those who arethereto help,
atthese times will send legal notice.

1323
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,889
Did you createtussle
with R.I.P people?

1324
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,395
What problem?

1325
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:05,659
That matter is in the court,
right now, is it not?

1326
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,860
All the supporters are agitated.As
I'm a party supporter called me and...

1327
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,665
...asked what isto be done.

1328
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,832
Joy, areyou mad to give
case against party?

1329
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:18,503
Uncle, can book case on me. So,
why can't I give case against party?

1330
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,113
Greeno, what a condition is this?

1331
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:24,048
Yes.
You are the only one, spoiling him.

1332
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,880
Didn'tyou hear? Take pride in that.

1333
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,555
What isthat I should do?
Astold byyour party members.

1334
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,158
You must succumb to party.

1335
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,159
I had promised to K.C,
that I will bring you.

1336
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,895
That isfor compromisetalk,
didn't I tell you that man?

1337
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,134
Brotherjoy, hold itfirmly.

1338
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:44,397
My uncle, what isthe problem
with meand the party?

1339
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,372
I'll come. Here it isthetime, even
brotherAyyappan solves the problem...

1340
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,976
...sitting acrosstable.

1341
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,112
I'll come.

1342
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:59,378
Satyam Audios

1343
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,115
Is pary's official drink, 'fruity' now?

1344
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,555
What is the price of sugar
and all, these days, is it not?

1345
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:10,994
Shall we inform party heads,
that K.C is the candidate...

1346
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:13,600
...proposed by us for bi-election?

1347
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,669
To take a decision,
we are already late.

1348
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:17,964
There K.F.C men had
started the propaganda.

1349
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,904
Leader, there is no chance of
winning, if anyone else stands.

1350
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,068
The corporation, is in our hands,
on account of majority of one seat.

1351
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:27,808
I'm ready, forthat Porinju. The
decision is from the top, is it not?

1352
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:28,779
Let the party say.

1353
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,486
For pushing from here, we
just do the pushing. That's all.

1354
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:37,053
As, there is no different
opinion in the party.

1355
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:40,855
OurK.Cwill be nominated forthe
bi-election and decision, to inform...

1356
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:46,229
...thatto the central kindly, clap
hands and pass that resolution.

1357
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,165
That's it.

1358
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:57,205
So, the next agenda is saying pardon
for giving case against pary...

1359
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:02,011
...by Joy Thakkolkkaran
out of ignorance.

1360
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,480
What saying pardon?

1361
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,121
Forthat, welcoming
Joy to the gathering.

1362
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,916
Go, Joy.

1363
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:16,423
Tomorrow itself must
withdraw the case.

1364
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,465
Committee will decide, whether
pardon should be granted or not.

1365
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,104
I can say how much pardon,
as required by pary,

1366
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,297
...but itwill be a great help if
I know how much and when the...

1367
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,964
...compensation dueto
me will be paid.

1368
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:31,709
On getting this, must
pay off lot of debts.

1369
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:35,475
Compensation..You, being alive
is the biggest compensation.

1370
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,084
Say the pardon and get lost, fellow.

1371
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,010
Then, what for saying pardon?

1372
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,056
For contempt against party,
for giving case against pary.

1373
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:46,751
I don'tthink, it is a big
mistake to say pardon and all.

1374
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,665
Leader K.C, isn't son Jonny,
studying in America?

1375
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:51,730
Yes.

1376
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,193
From where isthis money for all this?

1377
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,564
Aren'tyou digging from here?

1378
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,172
Can't you give a portion
ofthat and settle us?

1379
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:01,706
Even, I also don'tthink
any social welfare behind this.

1380
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,401
Get lost, you fellow.
Hey you!

1381
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:07,612
Leaders don't scare,
will be frightened.

1382
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:11,385
There is nothing to thinkforeword.

1383
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,283
I'm the one who is walking,
with sky above and earth below.

1384
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:20,121
Now, only I understood how terrorist
are being born. It is a struggle only.

1385
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:27,094
Okay, will meet.
Uncle, has he slept?

1386
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:34,008
Sorry K.C, from now on there is
no relation between him and me.

1387
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,474
Pary can do anything.

1388
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,202
K.C, shall we chop off his tongue?

1389
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:42,373
Forwhat? He is only a kid.
Ifwe beat, he will simply grow.

1390
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,577
Advocate, will do what
isforhim atthe cour.

1391
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,220
Okaythen.

1392
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:57,789
I'm hearing forthe firsttime, a
person will have this much problems...

1393
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,422
...with this elephant dung.

1394
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,764
True, brotherAyyappan, even started
calling atthe officewhere my wife is...

1395
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,668
...working and started the battle.

1396
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,031
My friend, there is no
point in saying all that.

1397
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:12,669
Truly, I didn't recognise the person
when we met afterthe 'Kapa' meeting.

1398
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:15,681
I understood that. Brother
was really drunk on that day.

1399
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:20,181
Go man, that is the reason,
why I'm sitting before you like this.

1400
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,019
Do you know, bottle relation
is biggerthan blood relation?

1401
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,126
Thatwas the relation
I had with your grand pa.

1402
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,420
What's that bottle relation?

1403
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:30,428
A relation started atthe age of 20,
on an 'arrack'(Local alcohol) bottle.

1404
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:35,663
Then when he became rich,
itwas 'scotch bottle'.

1405
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,931
But, your grandpa, didn'tforget me.

1406
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,201
That isthe power of
bottle relation between men.

1407
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:47,406
Here comes the stuff.
You are really his grandson.

1408
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:51,113
Blacktea only! There is
no other means forthe time...

1409
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,220
...being to re-establish
the relationship.

1410
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,252
The situation is real, tragedy.

1411
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,981
It doesn't matter, man.

1412
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,555
Can'tyou put some sugar in it?

1413
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,090
How many kilos of elephant
dung, do you require daily?

1414
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,234
No matter, how much
we get, brotherAyyappan.

1415
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,331
Is it?

1416
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:12,701
Lucky, harthal men didn't
destroy any of our machines.

1417
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:18,177
On getting the material, can startthe
production like before on a small scale.

1418
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:21,578
All the mahouts here,
are all my children.

1419
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,675
The problem, is howto bring
the elephant dung here?

1420
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:28,084
Can we bring elephant,
and makethem dung here?

1421
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,087
What?

1422
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:32,283
That is avery good
point brotherAyyappan.

1423
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,429
Astheelephants passthis area, tie
them here, dung will come is it not?

1424
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,021
There are lot ofspace
in here, is it not?

1425
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,827
The same arrangement
can be done on ourflat also.

1426
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:45,735
My Joy, will it work out on a
daily basis? Not practical man.

1427
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,669
Then let brother Ayyappan
say, a practical way.

1428
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:55,781
Daily, can you collectthis by calling
a vehicle to Thrissur-Palaghat route?

1429
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:59,315
If that can be made possible, I will
getyou how much dung you want.

1430
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,114
BrotherAyyappan, as one
vehicle was called, still now not...

1431
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,722
...refrained from the set
back received on that.

1432
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:04,857
BrotherAyyappan.

1433
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:08,484
On calling the vehicle daily
means, thatwon't be profitable.

1434
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:12,862
As BrotherAyyappan, told this
confidently we can lookfor an...

1435
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:14,559
...alternative arrangement.

1436
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:18,796
You lookfor it, along with brother
John's grandson, I'm there.

1437
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:24,411
I say, I'm there.
BrotherAyyappan, will be a real help.

1438
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:28,070
If it's a bottle relation with grandpa,
with us it's a dung relationship.

1439
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:29,409
Of course.

1440
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:42,056
Satyam Audios

1441
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,424
When, did you reach?

1442
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:46,825
Hey girl.

1443
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:51,135
Can you arrange a vehicle
loan on your salary?

1444
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,469
What for? To take
a B.M.W orwhat?

1445
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:57,170
Hey girl, seriouslyto take a
minidor, on taking that we can...

1446
01:26:57,312 --> 01:27:00,008
...restar the production at ourfactory.

1447
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,978
Whyworrying like this?

1448
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,449
Joy you wait and see, by this month
end all thethings may be set right.

1449
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,512
One, 'may be' slang.

1450
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:13,349
Anu.
Doyou want tea?

1451
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:18,622
Lorry, to get a mini lorry,
hey girl what is the way out?

1452
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,034
Can we go and steal?

1453
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:23,693
During night, therewill be many
parked atthe 'pattalom' road.

1454
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,636
Was yourfather having thatjob?

1455
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,801
Go, you idiotic girl.

1456
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,477
Where isthis letterfrom girl?
It'sfrom abroad.

1457
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:35,079
South Africa, hey girl,
it's grandpa's letter.

1458
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:39,277
Is sisterGracy, planning any
tourto moon afterthe world tour?

1459
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,320
Hey girl, hold this. Don't
know what is the nexttrouble.

1460
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:48,451
Satyam Audios

1461
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,559
Hey girl.
Lookat the smarty's photo.

1462
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,691
What is this? Lot of it.

1463
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:59,338
Son Joykutta.
Are you notfeeling well, there?

1464
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:01,600
Grandpa, really fine.

1465
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,904
Gave such kind of trouble
and left. Is it not?

1466
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,808
Here, I'm extremely happy son.

1467
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,076
What is happiness, in life
is understood now only.

1468
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,116
As, perwhat is planned,
this yearfor Christmas,

1469
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,952
...we are going for a Europetour.

1470
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,650
At Paris, there is Gracy's
brother, is it not?

1471
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,059
If possible on the way
will visitthere also.

1472
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:24,823
Saying, in a manner
just going to a pan shop.

1473
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:28,595
There won't be a return to
Thrissur. That's also decided.

1488
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,729

01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:32,162
Lorry, will come elegantly tomorrow.

1490
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:36,263
Grandpa, my mistake,
I spoke ill ofyou.

1491
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:47,510
What kind ofa sitting is this?
Aren'tyou eating anything?

1492
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:50,344
No, by afternoon

1493
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,576
...in that case before
sleeping at night...

1494
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,654
...something had to be
putto the stomach.

1495
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:55,585
Okay fine.

1496
01:29:55,990 --> 01:30:02,452
Satyam Audios

1497
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:06,292
What is this man? Like dog
sitting in front of ration shop.

1498
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:09,028
Brother Joy, sometimes
he may get violent.

1499
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,501
Must handle neatly.

1500
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,741
After coming from hospital, it was
heard that, guy is living here only.

1501
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,172
Can't go home, fearing the debtors.

1502
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:18,345
Same situation like us.

1503
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,073
Hammer in the hand, has he
become a ripper orwhat?

1504
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:24,607
Son Abaya, have
you become white?

1505
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,617
Kanna, where were you?

1506
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,984
Where all I searched?

1507
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:29,612
Was atAntarctica.

1508
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:33,750
Who is staying there?
Owner, don't make me talk.

1509
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:36,988
How many times did
I come afteryou?

1510
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,928
Is it? Coming after me? Why
man, didn't you say that to me?

1511
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:43,195
Forgot that.
Greeno, you are not attentive at all.

1512
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:48,331
Owner, don'ttest my patience.
You don't make me a murderer.

1513
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,502
You don't become violent like this.

1514
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:54,775
How much will be the
cost, to dust it off man?

1515
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,975
Is it not ourdung?
Will come to Rs. 40,000.

1516
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,177
Areyou going to
give it and help me?

1517
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,821
Greeno, take that.

1518
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:04,420
Hey man, are you not
going to temples as before?

1519
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,719
Nothing is seen, on forehead,
as crow shits on the survey stone!

1520
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,493
Hold it.

1521
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,231
Owner, is itfor me?

1522
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,636
Why not, who else man?

1523
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:23,401
This Joy Thakkolkkaran, has not
cheated anyone who is working for him.

1524
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:27,972
Abaya, how much is the CC
left as balance on yourvehicle?

1525
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:31,448
There will be Rs. 1.5 lakhs as
balance. Forthe last4 months...

1526
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:32,813
...has not paid any CC.

1527
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:36,022
Only that much, that can
be paid, you take the cheque.

1528
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:46,830
You come here, liftthis, this is the
best placeto keepthe money.

1529
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:48,126
Here.

1530
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,578
Is the zeros all correct? If
gone wrong, will be duped man.

1531
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,011
Here, you pay offthe CC.

1532
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,917
Owner, pardon me.

1533
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,316
What is this? What are you doing?
Will the compatriots see all this?

1534
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,013
You wipe offthe tears.

1535
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:15,088
Abaya, on clearing off the CC,
we will change the vehicle name,

1536
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,925
...in a small manner.

1537
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:19,690
To 'Punnyalan Agarbathis'

1538
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,529
Owner, didn't understand?

1539
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:25,638
Nothing man, we have
purchased your vehicle, that's all.

1540
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,901
Otherwise bank people
will take yourvehicle.

1541
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:28,804
Why not?

1542
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:32,174
This vehicle is more loving
to me, than my mother.

1543
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:33,371
Poorfellow.

1544
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:35,778
What is in that? You are the one
who is driving, onlythe thing...

1545
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,579
...the name will be changed that's all.

1546
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:41,254
Can I drive without
changing the name..Owner?

1547
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:43,822
Abaya, then will I not be a fool?

1548
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,859
You think and decide, if
thethings getworked out,

1549
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:51,123
...you are the permanent
staff of Punnyalan Agarbathis.

1550
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,323
Profit sharing, that is the
line of brother Joy, like...

1551
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,993
...Narayana Moorhy of lnfosis.

1552
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:58,571
The deity in which temple?

1553
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:03,472
Forthe time being,
can't give a big salary and all,

1554
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,910
...but once we have a good
time all will have good time.

1555
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:08,413
That's sure.

1556
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:19,851
Satyam Audios

1557
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,156
What man a starting trouble?

1558
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:32,869
Will anything happen?

1559
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,337
Itwill come out for sure.

1560
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,967
Hey mister mahout, does it have any
specific timings to putthe dung?

1561
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,373
Can weforcethe
elephantto putthe dung?

1562

But itshould havethe mood for it.
Does it havethe back?

1564
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,548
Brother Joy, thiswill turn to
a problem, must not parkhere.

1565
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:51,924
Forthat, no one has parked here.

1566
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:54,391
Can't you see an
elephant tied here?

1567
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,998
Where is this security coming from?
Shall we put him to elephant?

1568
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,894
BrotherVarghese,
itwill be over now.

1569
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:01,525
Have been telling
this for a long time.

Brotherjoy, shall wefix an

01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:19,784
That is only an expense of cloths.

1577
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,820
By evening, can
collectthe thing also.

1578
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:22,650
What's your opinion?

1579
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:25,248
Brother Ayyappan, that'strue,
what's your opinion?

1580
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:29,453
That means thatwont suit.

1581
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:30,961
Joy, to make children
do it in the morning,

1582
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,589
...is not as difficult as this, is it not?

1583
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,066
Brother here comes the material.

1584
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:45,372
Brotherwerewas it, all this time?
How long had been waiting forthis?

01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:53,449
Put..Closed the shutter orwhat?

1586
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:57,516
Fortoday, this much is enough,
when you dream till mountain...

1587
01:34:57,658 --> 01:34:58,886
...will gettill dungs.

1588
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,153
Real good stuff indeed.

1589
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:15,840
Owner, this is the
fight ofthe oppressed.

1590
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:18,836
We are there with you.

1591
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,808
On seeing your piteousness,
I feel like committing suicide.

1592
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,350
Owner, don't say like that.

1593
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:26,043
Shall we go and startthe job?

1594
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:27,814
The wages can be paid later on.

1595
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:30,582
Hey man, look, go to 'Thirprayar', (A
temple in Kerala) on reaching atthe...

1596
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:36,527
...front oftemple askforAnto,
by evening will get a full load.

1597
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:38,059
I've arranged everything.

1598
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:53,275
By tomorrow, if not a favourable
verdict is received from the court.

1599
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,280
The money which is send by grandpa
going, like this is also a waste.

1600
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,982
Then, we will not be able to
save our Punnyalan Agarbathis,

1601
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:01,712
...brotherAyyappan.

1602
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:14,624
Your owner, these are
the 3 R.I.P, activist...

1603
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:16,794
...who had attacked my
client Joy Thakkolkkaran...

1604
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,063
...and destroyed thefactory.

1605
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:22,302
'ldivettu(thunder) Sabu, Paylo
Porinju,Aiyanthol Shibu.

1606
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:27,175
Arethese men who
had beaten you?

1607
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:30,578
Yes, your owner.
Do you have any evidence?

1608
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:34,754
Yes, your owner. While they
were physically abusing me.

1609
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:39,085
I have also given a whack in return.
The guy, who is standing in the middle.

1610
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:41,285
On his buttocks l
had given a stroke.

1611
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,157
That must be verified
bythe respectful cour.

1612
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:47,596
Hey you!
My job is notto checkthe buttocks.

1613
01:36:47,768 --> 01:36:50,202
Do you have any solid evidence?

1614
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:52,498
Nothing will be thereyour owner,
ifat all anything is there...

1615
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,541
...that will not be sufficient for
the development of this case.

1616
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,611
Because, on the harthal day 4th,

1617
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:01,442
...these men had been dismissed by
party one and a half month before,

1618
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,606
...on the ground of disciplinary action.

1619
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:14,761
This isthe party minutes,
dismissing these men.

1620
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,495
The thing is right.

1621
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,433
Which means, when Joy
Thakkolkkaran was attacked...

1622
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,197
...they were not pary members.

1623
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:30,207
Because ofthat, relationship with
party and this case has come to an end.

1624
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,418
If, pary had nottold,
then why did you beat him?

1625
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:45,719
We, have not beaten any one.
Silent, it's an old building.

1626
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,327
They are saying they
had not beaten you,

1627
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:49,452
You don't have any
evidence to produce also.

1628
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,962
Thakkolkkaran,
case will be nullified.

1629
01:37:52,132 --> 01:37:55,329
Your owner, whatthey are saying
is lie, in the name of pary only,

1630
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:56,731
...they had beaten me.

1631
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:59,931
Mister Joy Thakkolkkaran,
what courtwants is proof.

1632
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,008
Not the kind of emotions like this.

1633
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:15,014
Satyam Audios

1634
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:20,452
If respected cour will allow,
I have to confess certain things.

1635
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:22,694
Tutor, you may say.

1636
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:35,607
Whatthey, and their party and their
advocate is saying, is a big lie.

1637
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:39,342
Tutor, say it properly.

1638
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,711
Afterthe so called harthal on 4th, all
3 ofthem have paricipated in the...

1639
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:49,449
...Brinjal agitation, representing
R.I.P, this month of 10th.

1640
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:56,223
If, they were dismissed from the
pary one and a half month back,

1641
01:38:56,397 --> 01:39:00,834
...how can they participate in a
function representing the party.

1642
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:02,332
Do you have any evidence forthat?

1643
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:05,961
Yes, that agitation which was
covered in the media report...

1644
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,006
...photographs are all there
as evidence.

1645
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,372
Must not take in to
consideration this witness.

1646
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:14,379
Without prior permission, how can a
witness be produced before the cour?

1647
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:18,678
If you want, you can
negate all my claims.

1648
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,444
Butwhat I'm saying is true.

1649
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:25,422
I feel ashamed in sharing the dais
with the political eunuchs like these.

1650
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,116
You have been doing itfor so long.

1651
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:31,025
What areyou doing?
I'll showyou, old man today.

1652
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:32,757
Police, movethat person away.

1653
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:33,696
Go and stand there.

1654
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:35,425
Get lost you magistrate.

1655
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:47,673
Porinju, break everything.
Police is merely grass for us.

1656
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:49,882
Tutorwhat is this, all about?

1657
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:01,722
Afterwinning this case, getting
money from the party members...

1658
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,690
...my problem is not going to get
resolved, brother Ayyappan.

1659
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:08,356
That became very sure,
for metoday.

1660
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:11,198
How many elephant
dungs do you want?

1661
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:13,136
As much asyou want,
I'll bring it here.

1662
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:18,438
Or else I'll bring there.
Here come your driver, greetings.

1663
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,271
What is going on here, a new thing?
Do you knowwhat is thetime?

1664
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:27,045
You go, I'll come.
It seems it's a serious matter.

1665
01:40:27,221 --> 01:40:29,018
Do you want any of
my help on the case?

1666
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:32,522
Ifyou want I can take, complete
phone records of K.C. Mathews...

1667
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:34,991
...and Pappan Kottappuram
from the office.

1668
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:36,891
Taking it, from office you go girl,

1669
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:38,726
...then afterthat job what

1670
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,728
Anu.

1671
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:46,032
Hey girl, we were thinking of
a thing, on a cooperate line,

1672
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:48,334
...why can we take group 'S.I.M'
for all the mahouts out here?

1673
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:53,378
So, on putting the dung, they can
send the message, saying got it.

1674
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:54,673
What is your opinion?

1675
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:59,181
They keep forgetting an elephant,
then why not a crap phone?

1676
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:01,753
When I was an mahout..

1677
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:08,027
Joy, we will go.
I got somejob here.

1678

Why, is he calling at this time?

1685
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:47,125

01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:00,174
Don't knowwhat all
troubleswill happen?

1693
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:05,212

1694
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:06,546

Elephant dung.

1696

Joy, it's all framed,

1697
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:10,714
Didn't I tell you atthattime itself?

1698
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:12,348
During thetimewhen casewas
going on no need ofsuch stuffs...

1699
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:13,551
...and headaches like
elephant dungs.

1700
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:14,524
You all come inside.

1701
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:17,061
Snake is dancing on the head
ofthunder strucked person.

1702
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,334
Doyou think, thatthis elephant
dung is something you...

1703
01:42:23,437 --> 01:42:25,905
...can roll to and fro on the road?

1704
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:31,275
To bring a thing, withoutthe
consent ofthe owners, that iswhat...

1705
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,779
...we police people call it 'smuggling'.

1706
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:36,680
Do you have the permission from
the respective elephant owner's...

1707
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,181
...to take the dung in the vehicle.

1708
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:42,146
Boss, save me boss.

1709
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:43,881
After some time.

1710
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:47,016
Apartfrom that complaint, from
environment board in addition to it.

1711
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,686
Sir, as the elephant is going
through the road, is it notthe...

1712
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:51,458
...dung which is simply put?

1713
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:53,122
On that account,
do you arrest elephant?

1714
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:56,532
Ifthe dialogue is in this manner
means, you will be also put...

1715
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:57,865
...inside, do you want to see that?

1716
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:01,197
Supporter of pary,
no need of saying.

1717
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:04,971
Sir, after all it's not a criminal
offence, can't you give bail?

1718
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:08,980
What?
I wantto see my mother.

1719
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:10,446
Keep quite you!

1720
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:19,619
This is a case, directly told by party,
if something has to be done...

1721
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,387
...K.C sir must intend.

1722
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:23,087
My dog will catch his leg.

1723
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:25,892
You will present him to the court is
it not? I'll take bail from there.

1724
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,295
Advocate, you come.

1725
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:31,895
Abaya, you take rest.
Boss, take me also.

1726
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:34,133
Gone.

1727
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:40,071
You don't worry, brother
Joy will arrange everything.

1728
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,078
Yes man, will arrange everything.

1729
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:45,480
By joining with you people, my life
also became like an elephant dung...

1730
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:48,281
...that is stamped by an elephant.

1731
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:51,918
I want to see my mother.

1732
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:54,322
Is it possible, that
I bring mother here?

1733
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:57,225
Hey boy, try to quit
the place. Go, go.

1734
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:01,425
Here he goes.

1735
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:16,982
Look at the manner
my dungs are lying.

1736
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:21,410
Afterthat incident atthe court,
I was really down, advocate.

1737
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:22,920
Now became charged.

1738
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,726
Advocate, you wait and see
I will fry them atthe court.

1739
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:29,226
If it is their phone
record ortheir visual,

1740
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,593

1742
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:36,800
You wait and see.

1743
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:40,098

vehicle for advocate to go.

Daughter's education,

01:49:22,756 --> 01:49:24,018

1803
01:49:24,157 --> 01:49:24,851
Whose?

1804
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,586
My daughter's and your son.
Whose else?

1805
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:31,820
Ifthere is any change in that
promise, then myfacewill change.

1806
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:36,526
Don'tyou know me?
That's forsure, letthe time come.

1807
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:41,505
When we become relatives, then
we can play any number offancy dress.

1808
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:44,672
Go man.

1809
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:47,109
Same like what Obama
did to Binladan, man.

1810
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:48,976
Is it not Bush, you fool?

1811
01:49:49,215 --> 01:49:51,046
Was it not in 2012, Obama's..?

1812
01:49:51,518 --> 01:49:53,042
Hey fellow, you lookthere.

1813
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:56,381
Shall I showyou, daughter's
new photo on the Facebook?

1814
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:58,123
No, I wantto see your photo.

1815
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,259
Look, that guy has
worn ladies nighty.

1816
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:02,017
Fool, keep quite.

1817
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:06,631
Brother Joy, everything is okay,
today this idiotwill be pulled out.

1818
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,633
Photo, is being liked by
son Jonny from America.

1819
01:50:09,769 --> 01:50:10,565
Enough ofseeing photo.

1820
01:50:10,704 --> 01:50:14,105
Saw!
Who is that? Someone ran from here.

1821
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:16,505
Why should we run?
To getthe cup. Go and catch man?

1822
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:17,836
Brother Mathews.

1823
01:50:20,413 --> 01:50:21,675
Catch him.

1824
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,510
Close the door, brother
Mathews. My god.

1825
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:25,914
Go to other side.

1826
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:27,112
Where to, brother Mathews?

1827
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:28,811
To hell.
You go somewhere.

1828
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:29,978
Now became like that.

1829
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:31,817
Will come here, I know
I'm used to it.

1830
01:50:32,392 --> 01:50:43,166
Satyam Audios

1831
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:45,700
Move back man, with
whom are you playing?

1832
01:50:45,839 --> 01:50:47,204
Move back man.

1833
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:48,968
What will you do? If not
moved back, you pot-bellied.

1834
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:52,476
Nighty is good, did she
make you pregnant?

1835
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:56,082
What the leaders can do,
any kind of roguery orwhat?

1836
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:57,706
Thatwill nottake place in Thrissur.

1837
01:50:57,917 --> 01:51:04,550
Don'ttarnish me.
Will do anything, no, don'ttake.

1838
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:14,324
Sorry K.C sir, since compatriots has
not got dispersed, that is why kept...

1839
01:51:14,401 --> 01:51:15,629
...you in lock up all this time.

1840
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:16,895
Give me awaist cloth,
to change man.

1841
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:17,401
Remove and give man.

1842
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:20,064
In a dire situation,
I'm always with you K.C.

1843
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:23,300
This cannot be ignored just like that.

1844
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:27,447
Why can't we call for harthal
tomorrow protesting on K.C's arrest?

1845
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:29,915
Keep quiet and go and sit inside
the vehicle, trying to cover-up this...

1846
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:30,812
...without any one's notice.

1847
01:51:30,984 --> 01:51:33,817
The bi-election is just overthe
head. Did you understand that?

1848
01:51:34,988 --> 01:51:38,014
Must be careful with medias,
can't get hold overthem.

1849
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:39,385
Rest of the things, I'll manage.

1850
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,459
Had that channel people
shot me in this attire?

1851
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,821
People have gone to
fish out channel people.

1852
01:51:42,996 --> 01:51:43,758
K.C, you don'tworry.

1853
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:46,161
K.C sir, our leaders are walking
cool, after doing greaterthings...

1854
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:47,924
...than this, what is thereto worry?

1855
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:52,663
I can't bearthis K.C, my
body is all to you, you take this.

1856
01:51:52,839 --> 01:51:55,171
K.C sir get in.
Areyou not coming, man?

1857
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:58,368
Must light a candle for K.C, at
church and afterthat I'll come.

1858
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:03,779
Pardon, my Lord..Pardon.

1859
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:06,248
I can't stay and watch this. I will
just die myself, by beating my head.

1860
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:13,823
Lord, this will not be repeated. Save.
Straight away go to the party office.

1861
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:23,058
What, is Lord'sjob to safe guard,
these kind of rouges at night?

1862
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:27,506
No news is going to come out side.

1863
01:52:27,674 --> 01:52:29,869
Even iffallen down,
will fall on 4 legs.

1864
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:34,776
K.C is the birth of a cat,
contemptiblefellow!

1865
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:42,418
You go, I'll call you.
This is not at all enough.

1866
01:52:42,555 --> 01:52:45,388
The newswhich was brought
was also not at all enough.

1867
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:46,991
We should have some use out of it.

1868
01:52:47,127 --> 01:52:49,618
You go, I'll call, no one
must seeyou.

1869
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:54,624
Go.
Okay..Then.

1870
01:52:56,069 --> 01:52:59,095
Aftertwo days, courtwill be
called, with the evidence with...

1871
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:01,796
...us everything will be materialised.

1872
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:04,703
Hey fellow, no use with those things.

1873
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:09,005
We don't have that much money
and influence as they have.

1874
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:26,895
What is the balance amount left,
from the money send by grandpa?

1875
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:28,533
Forwhat brother Joy?

1876
01:53:29,836 --> 01:53:33,294
That rabbit, forthe time being we
had kept it on sleep. Is it not man?

1877
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:43,739
It is the last chance forthe tortoise.
I'm going to take a decision now.

1878
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:48,380
Because there is no other
way seen, atthe front.

1879
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:55,953
Now, if I'm not supported means,
then wewill be completely scorned.

1880
01:53:56,462 --> 01:53:58,487
Keep that in mind.

1881
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,164
Hey man, told here only.

1882
01:54:13,146 --> 01:54:15,376
Tomorrow harthal(strike)

1883
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:17,683
God letthere be no problems.

1884
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:19,383
Take that gum.

1885
01:54:19,619 --> 01:54:22,053
It became a hard core political play.

1886
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:25,191
Really must appreciate owner's
brain. You paste this.

1887
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:29,852
Brother Joy, pasted the thing.

1888
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:33,626
Will people support harthal,
tomorrow only on seeing the poster?

1889
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,926
A kind oftension.

1890
01:54:35,468 --> 01:54:37,732
This is ourfirst step, is it not?

1891
01:54:37,904 --> 01:54:42,273
We have to catch hold of correct
point, that is spreading the news.

1892
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:45,707
How is that?
Here comes two points.

1893
01:54:45,845 --> 01:54:47,506
What is going on there man?

1894
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:49,205
Oh! Sister Sarala.

1895
01:54:49,415 --> 01:54:52,407
Where to? Tomorrow it's harthal,
that K.C Mathews was napped...

1896
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:54,679
...by police from that house
ofthatfat lady.

1897
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:57,312
Abaya, ifthese people enterthe
field, then we will be out of job.

1898
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,581
That's true.

1899
01:54:58,758 --> 01:55:01,693
Nowtoday itwon't happen, from
early morning onwards it's harhal.

1900
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:03,090
I'm going home, come will go.

1901
01:55:03,263 --> 01:55:07,757
The necessary commodities
are avoided from harhal.

1902
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,199
Hey man, see howthings
are getting worked out?

1903
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:14,070
Son, let the dawn risetomorrow.

1904
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:32,890
Satyam Audios

1905
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:36,386
Got it, got.

1906
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:41,357
For one and a half rupees,
the thing got suppressed.

1907
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:43,401
The thing has not gone
to any other channel.

1908
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:47,198
We can lockthis, atthe
pary's safe locker.

1909
01:55:47,373 --> 01:55:49,466
What for? Foryou to eat or
what? When you are hungry...

1910
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:50,769
...he and his tape.

1911
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:54,175
Hey boy, had children
taken it on their mobiles?

1912
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:55,508
They will put it on thetube.

1913
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:57,580
Tube? Whattube?

1914
01:55:57,717 --> 01:56:03,155
Hey, ourtube is, there no?
Lord, YouTube?

1915
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:03,651
Yes.

1916
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:05,824
Even the Jonnykutty
atAmericawill see.

1917
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:12,661
Look, whatwas K.C's business at
late night, in members house?

1918
01:56:13,032 --> 01:56:15,967
Wentto discuss on home affairs.

1919
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:19,194
Home affairs..K.C, don't
make me to talk.

1920
01:56:19,339 --> 01:56:22,001
What, is it by putting nighty?
Discussing home affairs.

1921
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:24,200
Will it come in news paper?

1922
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:25,811
Then betterto hang and die.

1923
01:56:28,047 --> 01:56:30,277
Paper has come.
See anything is there, in that.

1924
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,815
Give it, here let me
check..Don'ttear.

1925
01:56:39,959 --> 01:56:43,087
Give, give one piece here.

1926
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:47,058
Not on front page.
Not on this side.

1927
01:56:47,233 --> 01:56:48,393
Let me see, no.

1928
01:56:57,577 --> 01:57:03,516
What harhal? Notice?
Let me see. K.P.A.C?

1929
01:57:03,716 --> 01:57:08,449
K.C, what is this? I understood
the K.C in this, who is this P.A?

1930
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:10,714
K.C are you trying to
bifurcatethe party orwhat?

1931
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,586
I don't know anything Papa.

1932
01:57:12,759 --> 01:57:15,956
Lord, Reena might have
read the paper now.

1933
01:57:16,129 --> 01:57:19,565
K.C, don't lure to become Mayor.
Even forfew days, it's betterto move...

1934
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:22,532
...away from here,
which is betterfor body.

1935
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:32,002
The dear one ofThrissur,
also treasure of our native...

1936
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:35,512
...dear K.C Mathew sirwas framed by
police in a false case and the...

1937
01:57:35,648 --> 01:57:38,708
...media which suppored this.

1938
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:41,820
Against other unions, the harthal
conducted by K.P.A.C must...

1939
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:44,754
...be made successful
pleading to all natives of Ollur.

1940
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:48,327
We thankwith words of heart.

1941
01:57:50,029 --> 01:57:58,198
Satyam Audios

1942
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:04,607
It's harthal today.
It's problem, tell to others.

1943
01:58:06,846 --> 01:58:11,374
There is no one on the road, now l
understood K.C has got public support.

1944
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:12,983
My mother.

1945
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:15,450
In a women case, I won't be
there for beating and murdering.

1946
01:58:15,621 --> 01:58:17,088
It is a foul case.

1947
01:58:20,193 --> 01:58:23,629
However on hiding it,
itwon't stay hidden.

1948
01:58:23,763 --> 01:58:26,823
That is the age, son. Must
be leaked from the tube.

1949
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:35,438
Hey fellows, stop it.

1950
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:37,802
It is mere grass for us.

1951
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:41,040
I'm the president of'Kapa'.

1952
01:58:41,214 --> 01:58:42,806
Not tapioca butjackfruit,
getthem in to the vehicle,

1953
01:58:42,915 --> 01:58:43,973
...take him to the vehicle.

1954
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:46,241
Take the vehicle.

1955
01:58:51,691 --> 01:58:56,025
Issue became a success, Brother
Ayyappan and all will easily get bail.

1956
01:58:56,195 --> 01:58:59,062
There is nothing to hearfrom
advocate, because of our harhal, even...

1957
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:00,393
...the courtwas not opened.

1958
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:10,372
It is not enough, that I have to kill
him..Must chop him, advocate.

1959
01:59:10,543 --> 01:59:13,273
K.C don't talkfoolishness.

1960
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:18,111
Asmall foul case at Ollurward,
without any exact evidence.

1961
01:59:18,317 --> 01:59:21,548
That can bejustwashed off,
after a bath with soap.

1962
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:27,325
We musttrap him with law.
That is where our success is.

1963
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:29,519
Forthat he had dug
the holeforthat.

1964
01:59:29,662 --> 01:59:31,630
You must come to
the courttomorrow.

1965
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:37,736
K.C, the leaderwho hides in the
cave, only has got something to hide.

1966
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:39,462
Did you understand?

1967
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:45,706
Your owner, these are ones which
proves, they are the party goons.

1968
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:48,405
After attacking my clientJoy,

1969
01:59:48,548 --> 01:59:51,142
...afterthat only for a name
sake dismissal from pary.

1970
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:56,686
Satyam Audios

1971
01:59:56,856 --> 02:00:01,020
It is an interesting development,
which had occurred yesterday.

1972
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:08,496
Is itthis one?
This I had seen yesterday.

1973
02:00:08,668 --> 02:00:10,260
K.C' s woman's case
harthal, is it not?

1974
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:14,404
Joy, do you know who are the
people behind this false harthal?

1975
02:00:16,776 --> 02:00:19,438
Misterjoy, you cannot keep away.

1976
02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:22,605
From your e- mail only, that
soft copy of the notice was

1977
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:24,079
received to Thrissur printers.

1978
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:28,309
Yesterday, many who weretaken
to custody by Ollur policewas...

1979
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:30,854
...men who were with you.

1980
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:33,219
Is it Thakkolkkaran?

1981
02:00:38,965 --> 02:00:42,230
Yes, it's true I wasthe
one who conducted it.

1982
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:48,939
This harthal was a success, is it
out of K.C Mathews mass support...

1983
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:51,600
...who was dead locked
in awomanising case?

1984
02:00:51,711 --> 02:00:52,200
No.

1985
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:55,178
Our compatriotsjustwants to hear
harthal, not bothered about which...

1986
02:00:55,348 --> 02:00:56,679
...party is conducting that.

1987
02:00:56,816 --> 02:00:58,875
These peoples guts to declare
harthal, daily with some reasons...

1988
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,417
...it is because ofthat.

1989
02:01:02,054 --> 02:01:03,988
Are they thinking, because of
this coconut, what all losses are...

1990
02:01:04,123 --> 02:01:05,988
...faced by the people who are here?

1991
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,454
To think and act
such big, big things,

1992
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:12,223
...there is governmental
machinery here.

1993
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:18,932
Forthe existence ofa big society,

1994
02:01:19,071 --> 02:01:21,665
Joy has turned to be
social threat forthat...

1995
02:01:21,741 --> 02:01:23,800
...it's being proved by
himselfatthe court.

1996
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:27,174
Mister Joy has done a criminal
offence for conducting harthal,

1997
02:01:27,246 --> 02:01:29,806
...which can grant
imprisonment up to 3 years,

1998
02:01:29,982 --> 02:01:33,645
...for creating hindrance to the
living condition ofthe masses.

1999
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:36,988
To setfree a dangerous
person like him,

2000
02:01:37,089 --> 02:01:39,284
...it can be a threat
to this country itself.

2001
02:01:45,331 --> 02:01:47,060
Humbly request, thatthe court
must take the case against...

2002
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:50,431
...Joy Thakkolkkaran atwill
who is standing before here.

2003
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:59,909
The harthal conducted by Joy
Thakkolkkaran, protesting against...

2004
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:01,274
...the government is a
serious infringement ofthe law.

2005
02:02:01,414 --> 02:02:05,350
Hence forh, this cour proclaims
to send Joy Thakkolkkaran,

2006
02:02:05,484 --> 02:02:08,214
...under police custody till further
proceedingstaken on this case.

2007
02:02:09,388 --> 02:02:16,521
Satyam Audios

2008
02:02:17,063 --> 02:02:19,725
We should really appreciate
Nelson Mandela and all, the so...

2009
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:23,233
...called jail is a differentfeeling.

2010
02:02:23,436 --> 02:02:27,896
The entire world is outside,
we are in the 6 feet room.

2011
02:02:28,074 --> 02:02:31,271
We are moving forthe bail.
Then what isthere?

2012
02:02:32,912 --> 02:02:38,316
Then, what isthere? Ifyou again
talk Kottayam slang, I'll divorceyou.

2013
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:43,750
What's up advocate,
isthere any hope?

2014
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:48,458
Bail will not be granted, after
producing atthe courtwill be...

2015
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:49,959
...shifted to Veyoor(Ajail in Kerala)

2016
02:02:56,168 --> 02:02:59,604
Is this Veyoor, jail smallerthan this
tutor, tutorwas there while being...

2017
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:02,366
...engaged in strikes, and all is it not?

2018
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:13,085
Oh! 3 years, Greeno,
will be really bored is it not?

2019
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:17,048
Why are you crying?

2020
02:03:17,623 --> 02:03:22,117
Everything is positive, on going
there can peacefully think.

2021
02:03:22,261 --> 02:03:26,129
No onewill come to disturb, I will
come outwith a greater idea...

2022
02:03:26,298 --> 02:03:28,266
...than Punnyalan Agarbathis.

2023
02:03:28,434 --> 02:03:30,129
You wait and see.

2024
02:03:34,106 --> 02:03:38,440
There is only one grieftutor, after
living all this years in thisworld...

2025
02:03:38,577 --> 02:03:42,206
...couldn't leave a mark of our own.

2026
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:43,746
By the time got inside this.

2027
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:47,352
Joy, in thefaultwhatyou did,
there is a big rightness in that.

2028
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,750
Tutor, whowantsthe
rightness in here?

2029
02:03:49,922 --> 02:03:51,355
This country needs it.

2030
02:03:51,524 --> 02:03:55,585
I will not allowyour effortto
perish, without any one's notice.

2031
02:03:55,728 --> 02:03:59,164
Tutor, what can we do, the law and
the police is on theirside, is it not?

2032
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,562
At all times and all agitations,
was likethat only.

2033
02:04:02,735 --> 02:04:08,037
The existing practices were up
rooted, by bold thundering voices.

2034
02:04:08,207 --> 02:04:12,576
The voice that you stopped in
between, I'm going to take overthat.

2035
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:16,476
I'm going to star an
indefinite hunger strike...

2036
02:04:16,615 --> 02:04:20,244
...till this bureaucracy delivers
justice to you.

2037
02:04:20,386 --> 02:04:21,648
Those with the eyes, letthem see.

2038
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:23,516
Thosewith the ears, letthem hear.

2039
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:29,286
If my destiny is to die in thattent of
agitation, I'll accept itwith pride.

2040
02:04:32,431 --> 02:04:34,558
I'm there with you.

2041
02:04:55,988 --> 02:04:59,856
Poor guy, does he want
some nibble to eat?

2042
02:05:00,025 --> 02:05:02,823
Abaya, this is real hungerstrike.

2043
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:03,826
Is it?

2044
02:05:09,468 --> 02:05:12,028
Will there be any hope advocate,
on moving in the line of...

2045
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:13,229
...Anna Hazare
(Afighter against corruption)

2046
02:05:13,339 --> 02:05:18,777
Let it succeed or not, we will
do whateverwe can for him.

2047
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:31,221
4th day..

2048
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:52,401
Satyam Audios

2049
02:05:53,546 --> 02:05:54,877
Even though conducted harthal,

2050
02:05:55,014 --> 02:05:58,108
...exposed the roguery
done by K.C Mathew.

2051
02:05:58,317 --> 02:05:59,909
What is done Joy is right.

2052
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:04,317
Earlier also he used to say, his aim
is not Thrissur, or Keralam, or lndia.

2053
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:06,287
Not only that, I'm having
pride in being a parner of...

2054
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:08,519
...son Joy's first business.

2055
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:11,488
He is my dearest son, Joy.

2056
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:19,836
J.P, what are you saying,
what had happened that much?

2057
02:06:20,005 --> 02:06:22,200
Iftutor intends, didn'tyou
havethe memory ofthat before?

2058
02:06:22,341 --> 02:06:24,866
Asthe days goes on,
more peoplewill gather.

2059
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:27,110
Then channel people
will come and ride.

2060
02:06:27,346 --> 02:06:30,713
For, bi-election we will fail. The
cooperation will be also lostfrom hand.

2061
02:06:30,916 --> 02:06:33,510
Without releasing him, tutor,
will not stop hunger strike.

2062
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:36,120
J.P, is it necessary to fail,
in front ofa meek person?

2063
02:06:36,255 --> 02:06:38,621
Iffailure is the path forsuccess,
hey fellowwhy contempt,

2064
02:06:38,724 --> 02:06:40,282
...to walkthrough it?

2065
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:43,823
There is nothing
...permanent in politics.

2066
02:06:43,929 --> 02:06:45,954
If that is you or me.

2067
02:06:46,098 --> 02:06:50,432
He is a smart guy, in the
commotion oftutor's hunger strike.

2068
02:06:50,636 --> 02:06:55,903
For K.F.C people, who desires to
win, we are going to give them a blow.

2069
02:06:57,943 --> 02:07:02,380
Atrump card, which they
have not seen in dreams.

2070
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:39,282
Satyam Audios

2071
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:47,992
A smart person, what do
you wantto end this protest?

2072
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:51,991
Leader, I also knowwhat
is happening out side.

2073
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:55,729
In this business,
what is the gain for me.

2074
02:07:56,902 --> 02:07:59,700
Your bank loan will be
taken over by party.

2075
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:04,169
The permission for Punnyalan
Agarbathis, from Devaswom board...

2076
02:08:04,343 --> 02:08:06,004
...that is also taken over by us.

2077
02:08:06,445 --> 02:08:11,439
In exchange what I want is,
in thisforth coming bi-election

2078
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:15,217
You are the R.I.P candidate.

2079
02:08:20,192 --> 02:08:25,129
There is no other candidate in front
of me, presently to win this election.

2080
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:31,033
If it is okay to you, by today
tutor's strike is finished.

2081
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:34,298
Your problems are also getting over.

2082
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:37,307
Our big head ache
is also getting over.

2083
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:39,434
Think over it.

2084
02:08:40,913 --> 02:08:44,110
In life only once, chance
will come and call like this.

2085
02:08:45,584 --> 02:08:47,347
Think over it.

2086
02:09:00,132 --> 02:09:08,665
What is the option left, when we are
offered with wine and poison to select?

2087
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:12,468
Is politics away like thatto select?

2088
02:09:12,911 --> 02:09:15,175
Tutor, era is likethat, is it not?

2089
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:21,409
With the play what we see outside,
we cannot survive like that.

2090
02:09:22,855 --> 02:09:29,158
It's a golden opportunity,
to playfrom inside.

2091
02:09:29,294 --> 02:09:34,061
If succeeded, minimum a standing
committee chair man. For sure...

2092
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:36,895
Our business can be changed
to Anu's name is it not?

2093
02:09:37,202 --> 02:09:40,194
Politics of modern age.

2094
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:42,907
I won't understand that, child.

2095
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:49,206
Do you knowwhy I had put a
name called Punnyalan Agarbathis..

2096
02:09:49,348 --> 02:09:52,977
...Ietthere be a saints
name fora support?

2097
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,449
Thatwas the attitude,

2098
02:09:55,988 --> 02:09:59,355
...now understood there is
no use of such bribes tutor.

2099
02:09:59,725 --> 02:10:04,492
The original saints, are thosewho
stand beside us during the hard times...

2100
02:10:04,663 --> 02:10:07,188
...and in time of a danger, are
one's who helpswith a hand.

2101
02:10:07,299 --> 02:10:19,700
Tutor, really saying you are those
teams. Tutor shall I take leave.

2102
02:10:20,946 --> 02:10:24,609
Must givethe nomination tomorrow,
ifwon will change the face...

2103
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:28,241
...ofThrissurwith in 2 or 3 years.

2104
02:10:28,453 --> 02:10:31,479
That is a promise
given by me to tutor.

2105
02:10:33,292 --> 02:10:45,864
Satyam Audios

2106
02:10:47,339 --> 02:10:53,676
Aftertwo years.

2107
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:13,060
Poorfellow, was hard core
drinking, look atthe pot-belly.

2108
02:11:16,602 --> 02:11:57,641
Satyam Audios

2109
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:02,145
As per R.P's practice,

2110
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:06,081
...as mourning shall we not declare 24
hours harthal on account of K.C's death?

2111
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:08,811
What is there mourning, by
conducting harthal man?

2112
02:12:08,954 --> 02:12:12,014
And so called practice,
that is there to change.

2113
02:12:12,157 --> 02:12:13,283
You come.

2114
02:12:16,261 --> 02:12:21,597
Forthe well running ofthe Punnyalan
Agarbathis, brother Mathews...

2115
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:23,598
...was only there as my
suppor and shelterto me.

2116
02:12:24,002 --> 02:12:31,170
On this 'moral conduct day' let our
children plant 100 saplings. In his name.

2117
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:34,278
To sponsorthis by
Punnyalan Agarbathis,

2118
02:12:34,446 --> 02:12:37,472
...whatto say, I find this as a destiny.

2119
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:41,116
On saying whatever, will come
to his Punnyalan Agarbathis.

2120
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:43,710
I can't bear all that, after demise
of brother Mathews, without...

2121
02:12:43,855 --> 02:12:44,981
...conducting a single harthal.

2122
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:47,717
What kind of a coconut's event is
this, the soul of brother Mathews...

2123
02:12:47,859 --> 02:12:48,917
...will not tolerate this.

2124

He and his newthought.

2130
02:13:03,909 --> 02:13:07,675
None of us can fill that gap,
when brother Mathews was gone.

2131
02:13:13,285 --> 02:13:16,550
Punnyalan, a Christian name for

Brother Joy, Papettan and teams are
really angry. Will they create mess?

2158
02:14:33,999 --> 02:14:35,523

behind, why some of our politicians and...

2160

becoming younger, as they grow old?

2161
02:14:43,742 --> 02:14:46,006

I'll die on that day
because of happiness.
