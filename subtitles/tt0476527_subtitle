1
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,664
Camera... Action!

2
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,705
Don't worry at all, madam.
It will be arranged.

3
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,571
Please do come. Thank you.

4
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,512
Movie stars...
They're no better...

5
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,549
...than cheap lap dancers...

6
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,177
Throw some money at
them and they dance!

7
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,915
But no money,
no action. Whores!

8
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,183
But something's got to be done.

9
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,827
How will the shoot
continue otherwise?

10
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,763
It is the first day of
your son's career.

11
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,833
You're the producer and
your son, the director.

12
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,099
If the star doesn't show up,
it will be so humiliating.

13
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,205
Become anything,
but not a producer.

14
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,567
I swear!

15
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,333
It's like one is made
the sacrificial goat all the time.

16
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,912
Don't get upset.
Go and talk to him calmly

17
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,174
Give him 2 million and say that...

18
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,443
...3 million will follow
the day after tomorrow.

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,512
Take this. - Okay.

20
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,695
Hello. Ok, listen...

21
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,376
No you listen to me.
I can't do it.

22
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,540
But this phone call...
- I had to. I didn't have a choice.

23
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,411
I cannot pay 10 million. Please!

24
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,450
You've got the wrong man.

25
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,418
No... You're the right man.
You are the godfather...

26
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,319
Even Rasul said that
you were the one to talk to.

27
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,927
I can't pay more than
4 million. - 4 million!?

28
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,462
Okay, 5. In cash!

29
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,363
I cannot pay more than that.
We don't even have to meet...

30
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,097
But please spare my dance bar.

31
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,401
Tonight at 11 pm,
Horniman circle.

32
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,775
You will find the cash
in the garbage bin there.

33
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,537
Hands up.
- I haven't done a thing!

34
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,501
Sir, we found the phone.

35
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,695
Sir, I haven't done a thing!

36
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,375
I'm not involved in all this.

37
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,811
That's always the case,
isn't it? One guy is the brain...

38
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,247
Another guy is the brawn...

39
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,085
And you are the ass.

40
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,386
Write this down: As per the rules,
we fired the first shot...

41
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,762
...in the air.
From there. Mark it.

42
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,169
Bajaj fired a retaliatory shot...

43
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,574
Mark that too.

44
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,147
Then Bajaj started running.

45
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,617
I'm not running!
I'm not running.

46
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,017
We chased him.
Hey, run after him.

47
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:33,864
Then, as per the rules,
we fired at his legs.

48
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,133
But he kept running.
- No, I'm standing still...

49
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,244
...And kept firing at us

50
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,416
Write this bit in capital letters.
It's the medal-clincher...

51
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,578
One of his shots hit our constable.

52
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,225
Now write the name
of the constable...

53
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,621
Hey, who wants
a medal this time?

54
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,860
Sir, it is my turn now.

55
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,323
C'mon over.

56
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,260
No Sir, not here.
The medal will come here...

57
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,997
Fire at his shoulder.

58
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,776
Sir, I carry my kids on my shoulders.

59
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,938
Fire at his leg.
- But how will I go out to fetch the milk?

60
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:25,676
Will the hand do?

61
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,912
But I'll need it to accept
'under the table' bribes?

62
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,521
Should I shoot you in the head?
Then your wife can...

63
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,523
...collect the medal.
Shut up and turn around.

64
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,792
Sorry sir.

65
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Write: The bullet hit
Ghorpade in the thigh...

66
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,382
And then as per the rules,
we fired at Bajaj.

67
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,175
No sir!

68
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,144
Sir, I have a wife and kids.

69
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,514
Please let me go.

70
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,590
I have a family.

71
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,653
Sir, I have a lot of money.

72
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,690
You can take what you want. - Hey!

73
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,629
What do you think?

74
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,431
All policemen aren't for sale...

75
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,572
But some are. Like me!

76
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,075
"Create your own destiny..."

77
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,645
This is for the fake uniform.

78
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,440
This is for the fake policemen.

79
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,447
And this for the police vans.

80
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,710
Thank you, boss.

81
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,587
And this is yours Omar.

82
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,358
I've heard a lot of praise
about you, Roy.

83
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,251
Dog, swine, beep... beep...

84
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,969
Everyone says the
same thing about you.

85
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,102
Everyone warned me
not to trust you.

86
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,775
That's why I came prepared.

87
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,652
Omar, people short
on brains need bullets.

88
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,150
Put it down.

89
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,222
If you strain your finger...

90
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,689
...it'll be hard to count the bills.

91
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,628
Take that away.

92
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,900
What will you do with all this money?

93
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,896
I'll use some to stuff a pillow...

94
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:31,904
...some for the blanket.
I'll sleep with it and wake up with it.

95
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,142
It's all thanks to you...

96
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,371
Er, that's enough!

97
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,416
No boss, you're the best! The best!

98
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,416
That I am.

99
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,724
"...save your destiny
from getting wiped away"

100
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,919
His brain is lightning fast!

101
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,165
Hey babe! Come here.
I'm rich today...

102
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,762
...I need you...
Come with me tonight...

103
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,768
...l'll give you a share of what I've got.

104
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,507
Roy, you beep... beep

105
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:21,083
UTV

106
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,762
"It's not your wife nor
your child who matter..."

107
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,127
"...nor your father or your mother..."

108
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,895
"The whole thing is that, my man..."

109
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,402
"...money is everything."

110
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,173
"Without money my man..."

111
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,381
"Even your mother's love..."

112
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,551
"...could not have..."

113
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,515
"breathed life in to you."

114
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,739
"The doctor would have quit"

115
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,971
"If he wasn't paid."

116
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,676
"And you would have stayed
Right there in the womb."

117
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,717
"The One who brought you to life."

118
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,288
"Isn't God or your mother."

119
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,752
"The whole thing is that, my man."

120
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,588
"Money is everything."

121
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,464
"It's not your wife nor
your child who matter..."

122
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,933
"...nor your father or your mother..."

123
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,364
"The whole thing is that, my man."

124
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,803
"Money is everything."

125
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:26,475
"Money is everything."

126
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,818
"Bluff Master!"

127
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:40,328
Tina, money isn't everything.
But love... that's something.

128
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,697
18000 rupees? On a man you
met barely 18 times!

129
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,875
Madam, these negatives are
really old, and damaged.

130
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,172
That's why it costs more. - It's okay.

131
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,880
Excuse me one minute. Simmi!

132
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,113
Think about how you could
spend those 18000 rupees...

133
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,348
Some new outfits,
ten visits to the beauty parlour...

134
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,220
...six pairs of shoes

135
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,022
You spent your money on
what made you happy, right?

136
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,163
Now consider this.

137
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,698
If Roy likes these photos,
how happy would I be...

138
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,802
Please... what syrupy lines.

139
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,705
Look, you never know with men.

140
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,035
At least the shoes will last
six months, maybe more.

141
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,474
No, Roy is not like that.

142
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,542
I trust him completely.

143
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,883
He is a very decent
and straight forward guy.

144
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,421
Where did you find these?

145
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,989
In your house,
when we were cleaning.

146
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,725
I thought I'd make you
some re-prints.

147
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,898
You don't like them,
do you? I knew it.

148
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,673
Tina was right.
I should've got you something else.

149
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,504
No. It is not that...

150
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,974
They are really very nice.

151
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,308
But I hope you didn't spend
a lot of money on them.

152
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,818
No! Not at all...

153
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,650
Thank god!

154
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,851
Why?

155
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,250
Because they're not mine,
they're my roommate's.

156
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,051
Roy!

157
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,163
So you did spend a lot. Right?

158
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,177
I was just kidding. They're mine.

159
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,102
Roy...

160
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,304
Thank you!

161
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,117
But why did you bother?

162
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,524
For this stupid smile of yours.

163
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:55,230
Sim, I've never been given
such a wonderful gift.

164
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,627
Thank you.

165
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,568
It's no big deal.

166
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,264
It's just a few old photos.

167
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,801
They're not just any photos.

168
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,745
It's my childhood you
brought back to me...

169
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,555
I hope your friend isn't a
stock broker like you?

170
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,658
Otherwise, we'll spend the evening...

171
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,798
...analyzing stock
prices and the sensex

172
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,762
He was a stock broker.
But not any more.

173
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,560
He did well for himself and got out.

174
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,800
Don't worry. I think you'll like
them both, him and his wife.

175
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,445
Is it a girl or boy?

176
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,654
Both... and they are planning
to adopt 2 more!

177
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,017
My friend loves children.

178
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,627
It's beautiful! - Isn't it?

179
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,254
He retired at the right time.

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,868
Now his wife is his life.

181
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,639
You never told me
about them earlier.

182
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,633
Are they very close to you?

183
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,373
Yes, very close.

184
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,840
Come on, I'll introduce you.

185
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,094
I love you, Simmy.

186
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,669
I know we've known
each other for just 6 months.

187
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,069
But since the first day I saw you...

188
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,735
...you've been on my mind constantly.

189
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,749
I can't see beyond you...

190
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,777
So...

191
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,594
Marry me... please!

192
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,197
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

193
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,563
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

194
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,932
"Play the drums with all
you've got."

195
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,700
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

196
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,741
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

197
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,175
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

198
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,474
"Play the drums
with all you've got."

199
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,675
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

200
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,156
"With her simple elegance..."

201
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,521
"...the village girl dances
among city slickers."

202
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:40,495
"And the drums start to play..."

203
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,723
"Yes, the drums start to play."

204
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,731
"All you gorgeous
women, listen to me"

205
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,200
"It's god that puts
two people together..."

206
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,168
"And the drums start to play..."

207
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,638
"Yes, the drums start to play."

208
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,986
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

209
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,452
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

210
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,716
"Play the drums with all you've got."

211
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,860
"Let yourselves go:
Just dance!"

212
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,587
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

213
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,993
"Do once more what you did to me..."

214
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,293
"Play the drums with all you've got."

215
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,529
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

216
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,846
"All you fly girls in the house"

217
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,040
"If you're feeling what I'm saying."

218
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,241
"Then shout it out."

219
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,116
"Say"Let the drums play...
yeah, let the drums play"

220
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,312
"Let the drums play!"

221
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,516
"All you desi boys in the house."

222
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,786
"Just put your hands up n join the crowd."

223
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,228
"Say"Let the drums play...
yeah, let the drums play"

224
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,574
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

225
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,043
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

226
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,341
"Play the drums with all you've got."

227
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,281
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

228
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,182
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

229
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,584
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

230
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,918
"Play the drums with all you've got."

231
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,789
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

232
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:28,163
UTV

233
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,082
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

234
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,445
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

235
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,712
"Play the drums with all you've got."

236
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,652
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

237
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,724
"Say once more
what you said to me..."

238
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,088
"Do once more
what you did to me..."

239
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,389
"Play the drums with all you've got."

240
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,625
"Let yourselves go: Just dance!"

241
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,732
You've forgiven me, right?

242
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,705
You're not upset any more?

243
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,743
I can't explain how hard it was...
this time without you.

244
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,849
We'll never be apart again.

245
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,387
Sometimes it feels like a dream.

246
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,496
It is a dream!

247
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,561
Yes, it's Sardarji...
yes, it's Jassi...

248
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,795
You at the office?
I've got the agreement and the cash.

249
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,940
Yes... cash... cash...

250
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,600
Why has it stopped now?

251
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,432
Isn't there a standby generator?

252
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,803
Isn't there an alarm?

253
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,710
See if there is an alarm.

254
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,438
I don't find any such thing.

255
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,679
What have I got myself into?

256
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,612
Is anyone there?

257
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,085
There's no reason to panic;
I'm here, aren't I.

258
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,416
I'm stressed out and
you're playing the hero.

259
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:16,391
Just Chill! I'll get you out of here.

260
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,396
He's opened it!

261
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,939
...He's like Superman...
a real saviour!

262
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,745
Give me your hand.
- Who are you talking to? - You!

263
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,977
First give me your bag.
- He's asking for my bag.

264
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,353
Be careful...

265
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,586
...otherwise I'm in big trouble.

266
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,057
Thank God! I am through.

267
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,165
Give me your hand.
- Ask for the bag.

268
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,338
No, give me your bag first.

269
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,371
Go ahead...
he's trustworthy after all...

270
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,340
Hey, what are you doing?

271
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,519
Shut your mouth. If you move,
you'll be chopped in two.

272
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,720
Do you think I am a fool?
I'd figured out your plan...

273
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,055
You think I'll give you my bag
so you can take off with it?

274
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,557
Listen brother,
you've misjudged me.

275
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,265
I don't even know this Sardar.

276
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,438
Shut up.

277
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,701
I'm the Bill Gates of
this kind of technology.

278
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,912
Meaning... you're one of us?

279
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,948
We're finished!

280
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,323
You're Aditya Shrivastav
- Call me Dittu.

281
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,355
Shut up and give me your other hand.

282
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,989
Dittu, leave it. Let's go home.

283
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,293
It is no fault of yours.

284
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:03,334
You're leaving me sandwiched here?

285
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,767
Jassi! Do something.

286
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:14,274
Next time, aim at the
prey and not the hunter.

287
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,185
Jassi, help! Get me out of here.

288
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,304
Cash or card?

289
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,407
No, 2 more cups of coffee.

290
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,882
You have ordered
10 coffees in the past 6 hours.

291
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,209
Yes, the coffee here is very good!

292
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,908
But you haven't drunk any.

293
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,810
I didn't find anyone
to drink it with.

294
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,185
You can't just sit here like this.

295
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:56,784
Okay.

296
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,800
This is getting really silly now.

297
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,836
What!? I'm enjoying the view.

298
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,338
What view?
There is nothing to look at.

299
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,009
Stop it!

300
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,209
Sometimes a person may
not like the view. That's normal.

301
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,546
But it's the first time
I've come across a view...

302
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,687
...that does not like a person.

303
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,589
Roy, what do you want?

304
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,622
Forgiveness. - You won't get that.

305
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,760
Okay, how about a cup of coffee.

306
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,165
I don't drink coffee.

307
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,924
No problem.
We can order tea.

308
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,592
Look Roy, I work here...
please leave.

309
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,497
Go ahead and wrap up your work.
We'll leave together.

310
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,731
Enough, Roy. Don't create
a scene! Just get out!

311
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,465
Is there a problem, Sir?

312
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,078
No sir. He was just about to leave.

313
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,481
I have to meet someone for tea.

314
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,580
I'll leave as soon as that's done.

315
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,613
Oh! That's fine.

316
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,415
One last cup.
Tonight 8 o'clock.

317
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:05,756
After that you go your way,
I go mine. - See you.

318
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,423
"You are King Kong...
You can do it!!!"

319
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,658
"You are King Kong...
You can do it!!!"

320
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,802
You are about to die.
No, you have no time...

321
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,235
No, you have very little time left.

322
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,152
Are you a doctor?
I am a doctor. Dr. Bhalerao.

323
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,224
I have to speak at a
conference on hypochondria.

324
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,387
It is a very dry subject.

325
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,330
I like to warm up with a joke...

326
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,395
Can I try this joke on you?
Just a minute!

327
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:54,643
It goes like this.
A patient goes to the doctor.

328
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:59,306
The Doctor says,
"You will not live long."

329
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,513
The patient asks how long?

330
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:07,281
The doctor says five.

331
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,559
The man screams
"Five... what five?"

332
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,758
"Five years?" The doctor says no.

333
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,731
"Five months?!" The doctor says no.

334
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,594
"Five weeks?" No!

335
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,496
The patient asks
how much time he has.

336
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:23,397
The doctor counts down...
5,4,3,2... 1. Done! You're done!

337
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,608
Didn't you like it?
My God, what should I do now?

338
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,410
Calm down, okay.

339
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,247
Good evening,
Ladies and Gentlemen!

340
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,391
I am Dr. Bhalerao,
I am going to talk about hypochondria.

341
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,789
It is just the cover for my spects.

342
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,560
Agreed... bye.

343
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,899
Relax! Relax!

344
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,198
Down! Down! It's war... bombs...

345
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,876
W're being attacked.
By Bangladesh!

346
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,203
There's gun shots!
Down! Get down!

347
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,538
Wait! You are hurt!

348
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,314
You were hit by a bullet. - Where?

349
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,781
Look... blood.

350
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,784
Its is your own blood!

351
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,684
Lallan! Lallan!

352
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,187
You idiot, lift this man up.

353
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,692
Where am I? - On top of me.

354
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:26,961
What happened?

355
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,297
A bullet hit you.

356
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,368
O God! Call an ambulance.

357
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,969
We don't have a phone.

358
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,074
Use mine. Take my card from
my wallet... call the hospital.

359
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,143
Tell them that Dr. Bhalerao has
been hit... they must hurry.

360
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,143
Tell them it's an emergency.

361
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,982
I need a handkerchief
to stop the bleeding.

362
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,849
We will do that later.

363
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,880
Easy! Easy!

364
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,290
But I can't feel any pain.
I don't feel anything.

365
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,087
In that case it's no point.
Let's go home.

366
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:03,165
Try now. - Okay.

367
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,729
Where is the bullet wound? - Here.

368
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:07,370
Let me look at it.

369
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,666
Don't do that.
You won't be able to bear it.

370
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,207
Check my pulse.

371
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,378
Where's the watch to time
the pulse? - Here.

372
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,276
My son, what's your name? - Lallan.

373
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,818
Lallan, please loosen my tie.

374
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,182
It is very tight.

375
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,895
Please do it slowly.

376
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,392
What's that noise? - Nothing.

377
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,795
I hear some strange noises.
- What noise?

378
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,569
I do hear some strange noises.

379
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:49,304
That's the sign of your mind
losing control... before death.

380
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,314
Got it! The ambulance is here!

381
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,813
What we must do is...
- I am a doctor. I know it.

382
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,048
Please take care of yourself. Okay.

383
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,289
Lallan! Take care of my briefcase.

384
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,896
Because I don't trust anybody.

385
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,298
Purse... Hey, bring the stretcher!

386
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:21,168
Take deep breaths...
Breathe in! Breathe out!

387
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,839
Will I... will I make it?

388
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,511
You will. But I can't say
the same about your shirt.

389
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,423
They did a post-mortem
on you and left.

390
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,025
Police! Police! Come with me,
you are my witness!

391
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,400
Relax. Forget the police, I'll tell you...

392
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,869
...where to find them.

393
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,873
Sim, I know I made a mistake.

394
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,917
But that life is behind me now.
I've changed.

395
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,550
I will do exactly what you say.

396
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,055
I've even returned all of
Mr. Bajaj's money.

397
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,456
You know you're so lucky
we didn't press charges.

398
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,323
Otherwise you would
be in jail right now.

399
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,468
I don't think so.
I would have escaped just to meet you.

400
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,605
I can't live without you, Sim.

401
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,473
And I can't live with you, Roy.

402
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,344
You're not able to forget any of it?

403
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,214
I am trying to forget... you...

404
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,293
It's not going to be possible.
Because you love me.

405
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,520
Do you even know what love is?

406
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,867
There are no lies
and betrayal in love.

407
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,999
But you obviously
don't know anything about that.

408
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,463
Roy, each time
you cheat one person...

409
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,568
...a lot of people suffer.

410
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,541
This time our relationship suffered.

411
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,147
You're capable of deceiving
anyone you like...

412
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,344
But if you think that
we'll ever be together again...

413
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,125
...you're only deceiving yourself.

414
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:23,264
Sim! - Thank you!!! Thank you!!!

415
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,931
It's because of you that
I recovered my stuff!

416
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,994
I told them not to mess with me.

417
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,639
The ketchup guy escaped,
but his partner was caught!

418
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,245
I am Bhalerao. Dr. Bhalerao.

419
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,972
Holy Spirit hospital.
For everything from a cold...

420
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,549
...to AIDS, I'll treat
you free of charge.

421
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,881
I'll get this one for you. Waiter!

422
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:56,961
Hey you... who claims
to be my father.

423
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,337
Hello, papa! Boss.

424
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,069
I'm sorry...
It was a very serious accident.

425
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,102
We had to amputate both your legs.

426
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,868
Otherwise your life
would have been in danger.

427
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,703
Are you back to your senses?

428
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,876
You! - You recognized me?

429
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,585
I thought you forget people
after you ruin their lives.

430
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,211
It's bound to hurt if you
pour a gallon of diesel...

431
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,947
...into your pint-sized petrol tank.

432
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,820
Why do you drink so much
when you can't hold your alcohol?

433
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,052
I didn't drink so much.

434
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,993
Everyone says the
same thing the morning after.

435
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,599
Anyway, I should have
let that car run you over.

436
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,230
Why did I bring you here?

437
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,840
But what can I do?
I have a big heart...

438
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,206
I can't see anyone in pain...

439
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,409
Neither a friend...
nor even an enemy.

440
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,446
Thanks to you I'm down 40,000

441
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,622
My partner's arrested, and...

442
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,291
The police are on my trail.
Even my jeans are torn.

443
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,084
This is the sort of thing...

444
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,989
...that would make Snow White
into the evil step-mother.

445
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,552
But what did I do?

446
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,996
I took you home, took care
of you, gave you my bed...

447
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,864
Sacrificing my own sleep,
so that you could sleep.

448
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,705
I'm the evil Step-mother
who became Snow White.

449
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,210
Thank you... I am very sorry.

450
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,614
But that doctor just
wouldn't let go of me...

451
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,275
I would like to cover your losses.

452
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,218
What will you recover?

453
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,650
My money... my friend.
My jeans... my time... my sleep?

454
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,085
What all will you pay for?

455
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,089
My pity for you...
that brought you here?

456
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,557
Can you pay for that?

457
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,164
I have promised.

458
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,833
Stuff got messed up because of me...
I want to set it right...

459
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,333
Please! What will you set right now?

460
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,903
You're just the wrong kind
of person to bother about.

461
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,367
My life isn't always
going to be this way...

462
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,404
My day will come.

463
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,179
Boss... boss...
I'm trying to apologize...

464
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,850
...but you're hammering on at me.

465
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,553
Forget the money.
Tell me what you really want

466
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,482
and I'll do it.

467
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:32,479
Really!?

468
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,717
Partners? Don't think so.

469
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,328
Ok, you are the guru and
I the devoted student. Happy?

470
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:42,955
Think about it boss!

471
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,260
All the great people
in our line of work...

472
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,664
Started off as partners. - Like?

473
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,670
Bonnie and Clyde...
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid...

474
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,842
Give me Indian names.

475
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,169
Billa and Ranga?

476
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,844
They were murderers!

477
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,672
Jai and Veeru?

478
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,178
They were fictional.
Give me real names.

479
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,009
Raman and Raghav!

480
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,011
Raman Raghav was one guy.

481
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,187
That's why he got caught.

482
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,352
That's my point!
You've got to listen to students sometimes...

483
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,350
Why are you sitting sideways?
Sit straight.

484
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,690
I have a revolver with me.

485
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,023
It needs space...

486
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,201
...so that nothing goes wrong.

487
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,032
If it goes off,
it'll blow a hole in your side.

488
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,211
Now listen carefully!

489
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,042
Lesson number 1.

490
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,712
In our profession
we don't use guns or bombs or knives...

491
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,882
All we use is... - Money!

492
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,715
The brain. - Right!

493
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,221
And that's always with you,
always loaded.

494
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,551
Only those people
who don't use their brains use bullets.

495
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,062
Guru, please...
Show me how it's done. The trick!

496
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,065
The trick does not lie
in how you con someone.

497
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,238
The trick is choosing who to con.
- What do you mean?

498
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,401
You must have heard
that it is very difficult...

499
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,737
...to fool an honest person.

500
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,911
Yes, that can be hard.

501
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,411
Lesson no. 2
What I just said is rubbish.

502
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,421
Exactly! What!?

503
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,087
There is nobody in the
world who cannot be fooled.

504
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:20,094
Meaning... rich or poor,
big shot or small fry, fat or thin...

505
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,762
If the bait is well-hooked...

506
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,768
The fish show up on their own.

507
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,263
Look around you, Dittu.

508
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,104
This world is an ocean.
And man is a fish.

509
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,611
The problem is that most
of these fish are all dried up.

510
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,280
You can chew all you want
but you'll stay hungry.

511
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,449
So it's better to leave those alone.

512
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,619
First is the 'Maandli'.

513
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,287
'Maandli' are those small ones.
Yes, I know them.

514
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,115
They taste great with a drink.

515
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,952
But you need at least
15 or 20 to feel full.

516
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,962
Right... Maandli.

517
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,960
To fill your pockets
you need 15 or 20 of them.

518
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,828
And that guy...
what type of fish is he?

519
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,296
He is a Goldfish. Flashy on the outside,
but really, a struggler.

520
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,302
Cheap cigarettes in an expensive pack!

521
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,973
So which fish are we interested in?

522
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,975
In Mumbai,
the Bangda Is a popular fish.

523
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,651
Sales executives,
marketing executives...

524
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,651
...9 to 6 office-going types...

525
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,648
If you get into that scene...

526
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,324
...you will have to work hard everyday.

527
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,993
The daily grind is not
my scene. I'd rather...

528
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,992
...catch a big one and chill
out the rest of the month.

529
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:27,994
Then the Pomfret's the one for you.

530
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,327
TV stars, doctors, lawyers,
bosses of small companies etc.

531
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,837
If you rob them then
you can take a month off.

532
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,333
And what if I want to
chill out for a year?

533
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,843
The whale then...

534
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,174
Big industrialists,
stockbrokers and the like.

535
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,783
They rule the world like
the whale rules the ocean.

536
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,179
So why don't we go for
the whales right away?

537
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,350
They are out of your reach...

538
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:59,188
Whales don't wander the
streets or take buses or cabs!

539
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,522
So forget it.

540
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,029
So we'll have to manage
with the pomfret...

541
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,363
You think you can manage even that?

542
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,435
If you can't manage
that much in Mumbai...

543
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,900
...then all you can do is
eat cheap, and pray hard!

544
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,384
Guru, what are we doing here?

545
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,382
Today's menu features:
Pan-fried Malhotra!

546
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,057
Mrs. Malhotra?
Good afternoon Madam.

547
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,560
We're from the Standard Bank,
Credit card division.

548
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,396
This is a small gift for you from us.

549
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,065
For me?! What for?

550
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,570
As per our offer...
Can you please open the door?

551
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,401
You will just have
to sign a few papers.

552
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,237
Hey Boss, I thought that
you would pull something big.

553
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,913
But you seem to be a saint.

554
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,246
If you don't dangle the bait
how will you catch the fish?

555
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,918
It's a lovely ring.
- Not as lovely as you are.

556
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,421
It must be expensive
- It is worth Rs. 7500.

557
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,927
Not a penny less or more.
It's all part of the offer.

558
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,434
But where is Mr. Malhotra?

559
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,270
Mr. Malhotra! - Please come in.

560
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,772
Mr. Malhotra! Mr. Malhotra,
right this way, sir.

561
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,448
Who are you? Excuse me!

562
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,277
We did not order a ring.

563
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,120
I know that. This is a gift from
our bank as per the offer.

564
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,620
What is this offer all about?

565
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,125
You'll get a gift worth 5o/o
of the total amount...

566
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,124
...you spend on this card.

567
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,796
If this ring is worth
Rs. 7500 it means...

568
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,295
...that you have made
purchases worth 150,000.

569
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,800
150,000! - We did?
- From your card? - Impossible!

570
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,803
Is this your statement?
Then this ring is yours.

571
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,142
How could there be
so much expenditure?

572
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,647
Let me tell you the details.

573
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,980

Mumbai - Bangalore by Jet Airways.

575
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,326
On the 28th again a return
ticket from Bangalore.

576
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,827
Yes, for company work
I do travel frequently to Bangalore.

577
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,159
All the expenses should
not be more than 25000.

578
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,335
Let me see it.

579
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,834
There's a lot more, sir.

580
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,673
In Bangalore a carpet worth
3200 from Kashmir bazaar.

581
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,836
A dining table set worth
Rs. 35440, a double bed...

582
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,175
...and an easy chair
from Indoor Furnishings.

583
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,013
And Sleep well pillows
and mattress worth 7400.

584
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,846
You have a house in
Bangalore too? Nice weather!

585
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,852
Speak out...
why don't you say anything?

586
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,523
Ma'am, there's no reason to get upset.

587
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,189
He's spent on the home...
not a thing for himself.

588
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,869
A maternity dress from
Just Moms for 3000.

589
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:01,200
A maternity dress!
- You must have bought it for her.

590
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,708
He bought a pram of Bonny
Baby worth 13200. - A pram too!?

591
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,386
By the way, ma'am I must say,
you are in excellent shape...

592
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,520
After the baby.

593
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,718
Is it a boy or a girl?

594
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,725
Why don't you call
Bangalore to find out!

595
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,062
Sunita, pack the luggage.

596
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,891
Darling, it's all a misunderstanding.

597
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,226
Don't leave, please.

598
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,403
I'm not the one who's going - you are!

599
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,067
To Bangalore, to her who
on whom you spent 150000.

600
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,402
And I get the ring worth 5o/o!

601
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,076
I didn't buy all this stuff.
They must have made a mistake.

602
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,417
You don't have a second
house in Bangalore?

603
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,581
No. - No baby girl or boy?

604
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,921
No! Not at all!

605
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,455
Swear on your child
and tell the truth.

606
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,559
When I don't have a child,
what do you want me to do?

607
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,588
I think he is telling the truth, sir.

608
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,094
Someone else is responsible.

609
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:55,765
For the children?

610
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,593
No... - The credit card fraud!

611
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,429
Have we been robbed of 150000?

612
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,602
You've been saved
by the skin of your teeth.

613
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,776
Your credit card is insured
for 200,000. - Thank God!

614
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,447
Sir, please show me
your credit card. - Why?

615
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,611
Give it to them.
They are such nice people.

616
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,114
Just as I thought.
This has to be destroyed.

617
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:18,947
Just sign here please.

618
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,153
Your signature is very impressive!

619
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,458
We're all set. - What?!

620
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,461
Sir, I mean you're all set.

621
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,480
"I don't want to drink tea."

622
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,820
"I don't have the habit."

623
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,984
"Since I am a lonely bird..."

624
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,817
"...this trap has been laid out for me."

625
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,157
"That's why my mother..."

626
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,494
"...invited you over for tea"

627
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,003
Thank you Mr. Malhotra.
Let me remove the security tags.

628
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,848
My looks may be 5 on 10.

629
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,854
My physique... 7 on 10.

630
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:32,359
But when it comes to style
I'm 50 on 10! What do you think?

631
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,858
A white cane and a tin
cup is all that's missing.

632
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:42,864
Take it off...

633
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,204
This looks good.
- Did you like anything?

634
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,880
What do you think of this? - No.

635
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,548
So go and get it for me then!

636
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,893
That one's better.

637
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,564
Why are you following me, Roy?

638
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,903
I didn't follow you.
I had some work here.

639
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,068
Oh! So you are here for work!

640
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,241
Will you show me something in gold?

641
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,569
What are you today?

642
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,071
A lawyer? A doctor? An Inspector?

643
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:33,753
I came to tell you that you
and that guy look great together.

644
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,427
Okay, thank you!

645
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,263
Like brother and sister.

646
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,760
Amit is my fiance.

647
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,765
Does he make you laugh?

648
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,441
At least he doesn't make me cry.

649
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,782
He can't make you laugh or cry...

650
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:12,127
Which means he
doesn't move you at all...

651
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,956
And you're going to marry him?!

652
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,967
Sim, I don't know
how much he likes you.

653
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:33,810
But I do know that
no one can love you more than I do.

654
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,654
I'm getting late.
I've got to go. - Sim!

655
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,667
You can go as far as you like...

656
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,834
But I'll never be far from you.

657
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:05,003
Give me one last chance.
I've really changed.

658
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,017
Mr. Malhotra, your bill is ready.

659
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,678
Mr. Malhotra...

660
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:22,192
Mr. Malhotra...! You have changed?

661
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,698
Roy, do you know
what your problem is?

662
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,498
You will change not once,
but over and over again.

663
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,380
Move!

664
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:14,913
Just a minute sir.

665
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:15,584
Hey Roy!

666
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,588
Perhaps you've forgotten
to pay for something

667
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,256
I haven't purchased anything.
What do you want me to pay for?

668
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,099
Roy! I'll get you!

669
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,772
Larsen must have thanked
Toubro some time...

670
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,445
At least once.

671
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,118
What's wrong with saying
thank you just once?

672
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,951
Guru... can I tell you something?

673
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,613
That girl is not your type.
I don't think you both fit.

674
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,627
I mean, Gabbar may make
Basanti dance all he wants...

675
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,625
...but he can't marry her, can he?

676
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,127
Only Veeru can do that.

677
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,460
Do I look like Gabbar to you?

678
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,465
100o/o. The way you were
lying to that girl!

679
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,969
'Give me one last chance!
I have really changed! '

680
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,477
She's got a place in your heart,
that's obvious.

681
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,637
But conning people is in your blood.
You know what I'm saying.

682
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:38,324
Sunil, its Roy. MH 14P 1713...
Maroon Mercedes...

683
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,670
I want the name and address quickly.

684
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,508
I want popcorn and some sandwiches.

685
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,677
And two glasses of
something cold to drink.

686
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,681
Listen. He is a senior Income Tax officer.

687
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,052
Be careful, or this theatre will be raided.

688
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,986
Hurry up.

689
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,019
Sir, how was Mulchandani caught...

690
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,691
...Despite all his contacts?

691
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,859
That is history now!
His big contact landed him in big trouble.

692
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,694
He warned him about
the raid and advised him...

693
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,028
...to stash all his cash somewhere.

694
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,529
Then...?

695
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:18,369
The fool stashed the money
in his neighbour's house.

696
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,873
And where did the raid take place?
In his neighbour's house!

697
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:36,719
Hello... Namaste Yes sir...
We're just watching a movie.

698
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,720
A raid? No problem.
It'll be done. 20-25 officers...

699
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,901
Tell me the name and address.
Hey, take it down.

700
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,572
Pratish Shah! And his address?

701
00:51:53,944 --> 00:52:01,407
1411, Gulmohar Building, Pali Hill.
He has a Mercedes too!

702
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,744
Don't worry, sir.

703
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,081
He'll be begging for change
for his bus fare after this!

704
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,915
We'll be at his house at 3.
I'll hang up now.

705
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,759
The difficult part is over.

706
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,429
Now the lamb will come
to the butcher.

707
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,772
He is going to enter the
lift with his money...

708
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,067
...and we will take him for a ride!

709
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:36,342
UTV

710
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,627
"Once, I was in love with you"

711
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,130
"I was very happy with you"

712
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,632
"But then you played around"

713
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,304
"Don't come close to me"

714
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,133
"Go away, I don't want you anymore"

715
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,366
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

716
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,807
"Go away, I love someone else"

717
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,311
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

718
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,143
"We are the original bad boys"

719
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,649
"All you people better watch out"

720
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,152
"We are the original bad boys"

721
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,483
"All you people better
not come in our way"

722
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,320
"We are the original bad boys"

723
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,655
"All you people better
not come in our way"

724
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,173
"Once, I was in love with you"

725
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,675
"I was very happy with you"

726
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,178
"But then you played around"

727
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,179
"I do not desire you anymore"

728
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,182
"Once, I was in love with you"

729
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,685
"I was very happy with you"

730
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,358
"But then you played around"

731
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,753
"Don't come close to me"

732
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,691
"We are the original bad boys"

733
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,024
"All you people better watch out"

734
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,701
"We are the original bad boys"

735
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,029
"All you people better
not come in our way"

736
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,706
"We are the original bad boys"

737
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,034
"All you people better watch out"

738
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,871
"We are the original bad boys"

739
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,047
"All you people better
not come in our way"

740
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,422
"Go away, I don't want you anymore"

741
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,592
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

742
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,394
"Go away, I love someone else"

743
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,756
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

744
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,498
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

745
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:06,760
"Go away, I love someone else"

746
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,404
"I don't wish to see you anymore"

747
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,165
The tumor is quite big already, Roy.

748
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,171
This is the control center of the body.

749
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,832
If it functions, we do.
And we function only if it does.

750
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,345
What do you mean?

751
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,844
Chemo, surgery, lasers... what?

752
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:35,855
None of that can help you.
You're beyond treatment.

753
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,524
There has to be something.

754
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,355
We're in the 21st Century, damn it.

755
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,532
Had we known earlier,
we could have done something.

756
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,365
But now...

757
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,368
Now? What happens next?

758
00:56:54,611 --> 00:57:05,215
As the tumor grows...
various organs will start to malfunction.

759
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,722
Taste and smell are the first to go...
your vision will blur...

760
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:23,901
And when the tumor grows to here...

761
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,907
...it's your respiration...

762
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,908
How much time do I have?

763
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,586
You could ask for a second opinion.

764
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,253
Come on doc, how long will I live?

765
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,931
Three months.

766
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,441
What happened to you,
Boss? Wait a second!

767
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,614
I found this card in your
pocket and brought you here.

768
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,114
Turns out this doctor is the
one who was looking for me...

769
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:09,944
...so waited outside.

770
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,415
Stop it!

771
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,283
I've seen people pass out after drinking.

772
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,120
But this is the first time...
I've seen two pegs knock a man out.

773
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,462
Stop it!

774
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,125
Why? I'm the one who
had to take care of you.

775
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,462
It was like the Qutub Minar
resting against the Taj Mahal.

776
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,295
Didn't you hear me?

777
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,639
Don't shout brother.
You're my teacher and all but...

778
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,810
It's a question of self-respect.

779
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,980
Your lessons are done. Understood?

780
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,010
You go now. I will see
you tomorrow, okay? - Okay.

781
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,183
Bye! - Bye, sweetheart.

782
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,690
Roy, what are you doing here?

783
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:28,353
Sim! Hi!

784
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,860
Go home, Roy. You're drunk.

785
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:38,200
But I am more sober than ever. Really!

786
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,239
What do you want?

787
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:50,844
They say that when
God gives, he gives generously...

788
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,922
But when he takes... - So what?

789
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,563
I can trick any one.

790
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,667
You're the one who said that.

791
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:19,172
But how do I pull this off?
- What do you mean?

792
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:25,714
How do I trick Death?

793
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:32,151
Sim... I'm dying!
And I can't do anything about it.

794
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,227
How can you stoop so low?

795
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,359
What did you think?

796
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,961
This melodrama would work?

797
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,900
That I'd burst into tears
and rush into your arms?

798
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,006
Why would you believe me?

799
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,973
Just stop it now

800
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:01,986
He's my doctor.

801
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,262
What are you paying him for this?

802
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:16,338
If a cheat gets cheated,
who cares, right? - Exactly!

803
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,542
And even if this were true,
I wouldn't be crying.

804
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:26,341
Because I'm done crying over you.

805
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,863
You're very lucky,
Roy... very lucky.

806
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,835
Anyone can count
the days they have lived...

807
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,868
But nobody knows
how long they will live.

808
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,105
Except for you, Roy.

809
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,669
I hope you get to know
that about yourself soon too.

810
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,277
You don't understand...
A famous poet once said:

811
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:13,658
"O life, wait!" No. He said,
"O life, stop!" Or was it "Sit."

812
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,988
No, no. Life can't sit

813
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,864
Mine is heading for the eternal sleep...

814
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,172
Please, I have very
little time left. Spare me.

815
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:26,307
Sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot the poem.

816
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,076
My daughter is very fond of poetry.
She shared it with me.

817
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,644
Urvashi... She is 22 years old.

818
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,983
All the guys in college
are crazy about her.

819
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,516
She's very beautiful... my genes.

820
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:47,429
Do you know when
I found her most beautiful?

821
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:52,801
The day she was born.
I was right there in the delivery room.

822
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,199
And they handed me this baby...
all bloody and slimy...

823
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,670
She was so beautiful.

824
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,105
I will never forget that day.

825
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,844
You must have many similar memories...

826
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,678
Doctor, I'm not married,
I don't have kids...

827
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:14,988
...and I will never have any.

828
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,251
You don't understand,
Roy. Look, Roy!

829
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:25,125
Roy! You still don't get it.

830
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,870
It's these precious moments
that constitute a life.

831
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:33,337
...that transform the
mundane into the unforgettable...

832
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,070
When I was little...
the first time that I rode a bicycle...

833
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,716
...my father ran alongside,
holding the seat.

834
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,750
Listen to me. He was running alongside...

835
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:47,914
...and I kept turning back, asking...

836
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,785
'Dad, are you there?
Dad, are you there? '

837
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,857
He said 'You've got to look
ahead... look ahead.'

838
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,859
After a few moments
I turned my head again to see...

839
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,621
...that he was standing quite
a distance away, smiling.

840
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,089
And I had learned to ride a bicycle.

841
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:02,635
I'll never forget that day.
Never. Do you understand me?

842
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,834
The amazing thing is,
I got to relive that day...

843
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,138
Only this time
I was holding the seat...

844
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,548
...and my daughter
Urvashi was riding the bicycle.

845
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,515
"No... no turning back...
Look ahead. Look ahead.'

846
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,213
'Dad, are you there?
Dad, are you there? '

847
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,621
And I let go.

848
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:30,732
When she turned back
and looked at me...

849
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:34,562
...she was smiling.
Just like you are, Roy.

850
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:39,202
Tell me, how many such
days do you remember?

851
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,478
Your first job! Your first suit!
Our first salary!

852
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,947
The first time you held
a girl's hand? Your first kiss?

853
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,244
Your first love?

854
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,649
How many such days
do you remember? Tell me!

855
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:08,031
15... 20... 25... 30?
Thirty special days, right?

856
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:12,968
You've lived 30 years and
you remember just 30 days?

857
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,671
What happened to the other days?

858
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,972
Now, you have 90 days to live...

859
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:26,685
You can kill that time
thinking about death,

860
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,857
Or you can live 3 lifetimes
in those 90 days.

861
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,556
Is he a parking valet or

01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,420

Follow that car, fast!

864
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:53,273
"We can do anything we want"

865
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,673
"We can achieve the impossible"
