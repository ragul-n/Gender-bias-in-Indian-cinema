Yes, your honour

28
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,673
Had been a pleasure
listening to you as a lawyer

29
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,475

Every one is fine

36
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,543

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,744
Yes, dad?

42
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,508
- Be cautious
- Yes, dad

43
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,310
So will meet in person

44
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,045

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,147
And with him
his better half...

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,115

Congratulations, sir

63
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,504
Markos tried his best
to get this judge post

64
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,739
Relax Markos
You can try later

65
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,976
Friends! I remember
when our Krishna lyer...

66
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,377
was offered a judge post...

67
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,345
declining the offer he said...

68
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:30,237
'I would rather speak
sense once in a while...'

69
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,577
'...than hearing
nonsense all the while'

70
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,635
Anyway I am not
going to lose this

71
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,373
I would not reject it

72
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,642
I am accepting it
with all humility

73
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,745
I hope it is fun...

74
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,144
To hell with
your honesty man...!

75
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,613
And I am humbled

76
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,669
- Let's go
- Didn't have dinner?

77
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,508
Will only this dinner
digest for you?

78
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,978
We would go
to some hotel

79
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,444
Come...let's go

80
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,209
Come on

81
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,543
He thought he would
get extension

82
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,307
If he shells out
lots of money

83
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,176
Blackguard has no integrity

84
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,977
But even at those days...

85
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,740
...you had focus
and fortitude

86
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,070
He started from
the Betheri court

87
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,445
Now Bangalore High court's
most successful lawyer

88
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,037
And now he has
become a judge too

89
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,340
Right on top

90
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:40,108
The day he passed LLB
he joined me

91
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,114
I made him do all jobs
except the lawyers...

92
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,976
...he did the clerk's job,
fetching ration provisions

93
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:49,037
and even mending
my footwear?

94
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,012
I considered it as
'Gurukula' education sir

95
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,139
Hello...welcome
welcome

96
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,777
Now we can't complain
there are no police officers

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,741
My friend
Neil George IPS

98
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,403
Greet you

99
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,242
Now on special
duty in Bangalore?

100
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,075
As lawyers we had worked
together in many cases

101
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,111
My best friend

102
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,304
He is Sangee's
classmate too

103
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,006
You need not stay here

104
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,205
You are a misfit
in this gathering

105
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,404
All others are blind drunk

106
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,707
Let me take him inside

107
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,575
He doesn't drink
He used to drink long ago

108
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,475
Sangee...

109
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,508
- Get him an Horlicks
- Horlicks?

110
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,241
Aravindmcongrats
on your judgeship?

111
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,505
No formalities...

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,136
You can even abuse
me as you did

113
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,702
When I came to see her as
the would be bride

114
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,075
I was in tipsy then

115
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,111
I was just kidding

116
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,544
How long is your
stay in Bangalore?

117
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,635
- What about your family?
- They are at my place

118
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,701
I would stay
hardly for a month

119
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:45,472
Aravind...

120
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,171
- I am leaving
- Sir is soaked

121
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,211
I will be back now?

122
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,644
- Bellicose?
- Could be

123
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,740
Don't hold me

124
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,336
Sir, let's go?

125
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,970
You be careful
about Markos

126
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,603
That's nothing, sir
I will take care

127
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,741
Salim will you
take him home?

128
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,744
No problem

129
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,211
Shall I tell you a truth?

130
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,507
Even now when I see you
lam in a quandary

131
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,342
Why? You have
a family and kids

132
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,243
It was just
a college day's crush

133
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,074
True, it was
a college day's crush

134
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,305
But let me tell the truth

135
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,973
Even now when I see you...

136
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,704
after a break
lam in a quandary

137
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,269
You really haven't changed

138
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,643
I can't change
Neither can you...

139
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,110
Go...get me a tea

140
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,271
I will get you Horlicks

141
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,334
If you give me Horlicks...

142
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,605
I would be again
in a quandary

143
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,770
- Go man
- Tea

144
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,340
Does he sleep with the cap?

145
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,044
Because you made an offering
to tonsure his head

146
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,678
He lost his hair

147
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,543
lam going to bed
I'm damn tired

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,046
Will our life change
to a great extent?

149
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,438
Come on
Silly

150
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,739
What about police, media
political pressure...

151
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,610
Nothing of that son
It's like any otherjob

152
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,977
If you are good to the job
the job will be very good to you

153
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,273
In case I face problems...

154
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,539
...anyway I have
the gavel with me

155
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,544
I would just throw it

156
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,511
Aravind...please don't joke

157
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,410
This is because of
planetary changes?

158
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,174
Is that the reason?

159
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,707
I am serious

160
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,773
Your last birthday forecast
said about these changes

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,172
Because of that...

162
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:36,241
Look madam...

163
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,370
Don't waste time
talking about astrologers

164
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,276
Tomorrowl have
a long drive

165
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,437
Retire to bed now

166
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,036
At the temple festival
at our place

167
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,646
I may sing
a devotional song

168
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,710
The judge can't give
a harsher punishment than this

169
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,643
Then let's sing a duet

170
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,202
What do you say?

171
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,782

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,471
Decide on the land quickly

203
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,513
It's on the road side
and is in great demand

204
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:14,602
What do you say, dad?

205

When I retired
I gave my terminal...

But he has not done
anything with this share

That's why he has
suggested this?

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,536
Think and decide

211
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:30,103
Else after retirement
go for a good house

212
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,077
What do you say?

213
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,703
Will think about it

Happiness, appreciation...

235
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,478
But because of them
some others feel the hell...

236
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,012
Do you know about that?

237
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,569
Nonsense

238
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,581
Who was it?
Why are you disturbed?

239
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,975

Where is Arya?

268
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,310
Must be somewhere there

269
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,173
- What is it, dear?
- Where is Arya?

270
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,440
I saw her playing
hide and seek with kids

271
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,140
She can do this
only in country side

272
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:42,973
My goodness

273
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,307
Were you scared dad?

274
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,778
What are you doing here alone?

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,775
We were playing
hide and seek

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,037
But you were scared dad

277
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:50,736
Ok

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,207

279
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,278
Hello

280
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,505
Aravind, sir

281
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,671
Are you intimidating me?

282
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,212
Your daughter
intimidated you

283
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,109
Not me

284
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,305
She played hide
and seek with you

285
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,244
Hide and seek
is a good game

286
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,406
What do you say, sir?
What if we play that?

287
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,310
A game of hide and seek

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,041
Just you and me
Let's play

289
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,373
Get lost

290
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,506
Long long ago...

291
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,977
Grandpa has started the tale

292
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,343
There was an emperor
called Dasarathan

293
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,243
Do you know the number
of children emperor Dasarathan had?

294
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,472
- How many?
- Four children

295
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,345
All the four were
most handsome male children

296
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,704
I was telling them a story

297
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,211
Arya, don't you want to sleep?

298
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,211

301
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,713
Grandpa will narrate
the remaining story now

302
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,103
All the four children
were very studious

303
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,111
Do you know who
was their guru?

304
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,012
- No
- Sage Vasishta

305
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,439
Greet you
Greet you

306
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:12,671
Aravind...wait

307
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,269
When did you come?

308
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,206
I heard you have
become ajudge

309
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:20,269
- What would you get?
- No, nothing like that

310
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,108
lam asking out of curiosity...

311
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,477
Will you hang people?
All of them say so

312
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,976
I am going to
the reading room

313
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,034
Will meet later

314
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,711
Aravind
wait for a while

315
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,771
Then we will meet at
the folklore performance

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
How can you be so occupied?

317
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,711
I am busy

323
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,434
Hello

324
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,774
Hello

325
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,509
Is it not King?

326
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,579
Which idiot is at
the other side?

327
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,544
What is the issue now?

328
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:35,345
Kings from 8 directions
have started coming

329
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:39,613
I said Kings and not monkeys

330
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,305
King can have them too

331
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,641
Here Panchala King's...

332
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,143
What happened Aravind?

333
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,577
Nothing happened
You may sleep

334
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,411
After putting me to sleep
are you planning to drive rashly?

335
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,605
No

336
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,574
Once you are at the wheels
you imagine you are a teenager

337
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,476
You drive zig zag
and take sharp turns

338
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,570
Aravind
Aravind stop it

339
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,306
There is no speed limit here

340
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,369
But our kids are behind

341
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,104
We have no issues, dad

342
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,010
Just press the pedal
Be safe

343
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,545
Dad...dad
Dad...

344
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,376
I am scared

345
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,235
Aravind...

346
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,504
Aravind enough
Can't you stop it now?

347
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,044
Please...

348
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,677
Don't bejudgemental

349
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,744
Aravind, stop it

350
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,308
Aravind, enough

351
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,678
Do you want to know the person
following us with so much troubles?

352
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,238
What happened?

353
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,441
Private defence

354
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,977
Aravind, stop it

355
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,637
so guys"

356
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,541
Once Aravind sir's
swearing in is over...

357
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,238
...we are all on our own

358
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,343
But the firm continues
to be as usual

359
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,969
Based on the nature of the cases

360
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,637
we divide among
us like clusters

361
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,303
That's what
Aravind sir suggested

362
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,143
So constructions apartments
and contracts provides you

363
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,042
Ok

364
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,478
May not have
big workloads

365
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,639
Liqour cases
is Venkitu's section

366
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,769
Venkitachalapathy
doesn't drink

367
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,012
He is a Brahmin

368
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,410
How will a teetotaler
argue liquor cases?

369
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,413
That must be handled
by some Malayali

370
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,275
We'll do one thing

371
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,744
Let it be handled
by our dear Anne

372
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,279
- How is it?
- That is apt

373
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,574
For research she has
a sample at home

374
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,271
Her husband is
a great soaker

375
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:49,243
You...

376
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:50,574
That may not fructify

377
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,408
So this case goes to Venkitu

378
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,536
So will I take up
tussles between Gounders...

379
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,045
Family issues and
undesirable cases

380
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,134
- Sir
- What man?

381
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,146
I have bundled old case files

382
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,144
What to do with it?

383
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,508
Keep it in chamber office

384
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,102
I'll let you know after
talking to Aravind sir

385
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:04,975
Yes, sir

386
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:07,472
Simply enviable
Is it not?

387
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,171
I mean Aravind sir's career

388
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,714
Every advocate's
dream run he has had

389
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,075
God bless him

390
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,577
Hide and seek

391
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,471
What...?

392
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,338
What is hide and seek...?

393
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,572
Nothing

394
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:50,999
Linto...

395
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,740
Linto...

396
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,040
Where has he gone?

397
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,176
Who is it?

398
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,311
Who is that?

399
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,505
Who are you?
What do you want?

400
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,307
Who are you?

401
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,176
Why are you
harassing me like this?

402
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,772
What do you want?

403
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,239
Can't you hear me?

404
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,206
That's a good one

405
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:53,612
Will the high counjudge know...

406
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,237
...the route to homes
of poor guys like me?

407
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,412
What do I owe to
the owner of this visit?

408
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,045
Stop it Markos...

409
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,579
The game you are playing now

410
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,340
Stop it
Stop it now

411
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,208
Why?

412
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,602
Is it not an interesting game?

413
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,073
Don't you play PS3 and
NFS underground?

414
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,510
Why should I stop?

415
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,102
It's quite interesting

416
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,675
Look Mr.Markos...

417
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,504
Tutored calls...

418
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,602
Chase by film stunt men

419
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:26,044
and the sloppy
hide and seek game

420
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,273
But yesterday
was the limit

421
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,504
If you lay hands
on my family...

422
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,302
I don't understand
anything Mr.Aravind

423
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,538
What are you talking?

424
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,601
See Mr.Markos

425
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:38,236
If you have any issue
on my posting

426
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,439
you complain at
the Judges collegiums

427
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,514
But this is not the way
to find an end to your emotions

428
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,677
You have defeated me

429
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,074
Good game

430
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,135
Bingo

431
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,245
Mr.Aravind
what were you saying?

432
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,643
I couldn't
understand anything

433
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,010
What would you like to have?
Coffee or Tea?

434
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:55,704
Rieta

435
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:59,341
Hey

436
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,712
Stop it now

437
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,309
Hello
This is not Olympics

438
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,074
Why are you so worked up?

439
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,340
Just to get relief
from tension

440
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,703
Bye Papa

441
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:32,641
Come fast

442
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,573
Go go

443
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,603
<i>Empty y our (“fin box
Heard me'?</i>

444
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,701
Go go

445
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,041
Take this bag

446
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,670
Has Benson not come?

447
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,373
- He is not feeling well
- 0k, ok

448
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:50,741
Bye
Bye

449
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,206
Bye Adi

450
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:55,304
Bye bye

451
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,246
I have sent him to school
It was a new driver

452
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,007
He said Benson is sick

453
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,306
They called from
the service station

454
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,277
The car is ready

455
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,074
Let me go and get the car

456
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,079
On the way I would
visit the temple

457
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,273
After sending him to school
I planned to go in an auto

458
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,710
Bye
See you

459
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,303
Good morning baby

460
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,108
How are you feeling today?

461
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,503
Your fever is gone

462
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,443
Enjoy
So go to school today...

463
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,036
After the first period

464
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,110
Ok...ok
Shall I give you Horlicks?

465
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,202
Baghya
Give her Horlicks

466
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,337
Go go

467
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:52,742
I am feeling sleepy

468
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,004
- I am going to sleep
- Ok

469
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:59,272
Adi
Adi

470
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,708
Uncle, Adi is still sleeping?

471
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,669
He has gone to school

472
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,041
Why? You didn't go?

473
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,111
Are you not well?

474
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,044
I am ok
But there is no school today

475
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,010
School peon died
or something like that

476
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,138
I thought Suman
would have told Adi

477
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,176
He didn't tell him

478
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,077
-0k, bye uncle
- Bye

479
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,638
The school people
are irresponsible

480
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:22,341
They would not give
timely information

481
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,471
His sleep was also spoiled

482
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,310
Then howdid the school bus come?

483
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,077
My God,"

484
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,610
Hey”

485
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,775
- Is it you?
- What sir?

486
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,378
Whom did you send
to pick my son to school?

487
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:33,469
- I didn't send any one
- Didn't you?

488
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,477
No school today...

489
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,104
So I am taking
the bus to workshop

490
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,670
- What happened?
- Is there no school today?

491
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:12,508
PaPPa

492
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,375
Adi...

493
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:16,505
<i>Paw“
Paw'</i>

494
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,739
PaPPa

495
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,980
PaPPa

496
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,238
Wait

497
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:25,602
PaPPa

498
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:26,702
Wait

499
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,710
Move to that side

500
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,510
Com e com e
Don't cry

501
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:44,637
Nothing

502
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:46,645
Don't cry
You are safe

503
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,407
Don't cry

504
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:02,107
When there was
no one at the school...

505
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,169
...driver uncle said
he will find out and went

506
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,338
Why is there no
one at the school?

507
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,708
There is no school
today dear!

508
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,269
We came to
know only now

509
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:10,402
Are you ok?

510
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,639
I was a bit scared

511
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,372
Seeing you
I became ok

512
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:17,074
It is mom's mistake
She should have checked

513
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:18,607
Where is mom?

514
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,509
Something
wrong with car

515
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,303
Best...

516
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:37,344
What's this new problem?

517
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,371
Hello
Hello Aravind

518
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:06,707
Sangee
Where are you?

519
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,713
I am now near
New Horizon school

520
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,041
Something
wrong with the car

521
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,046
Stay there
Wait...wait there

522
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:13,272
Will you come soon?

523
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,506
I am coming

524
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,110
What happened?

525
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,508
The carjerked and stopped

526
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:31,739
When I checked...

527
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,076
I got something like
an electrical shock

528
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:35,677
The service is just done

529
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,407
Now a new problem
has cropped up

530
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:38,741
Have you informed
the service station?

531
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,574
I did

532
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,975
Then they would
take the car

533
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:41,978
Get on to the bike

534
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,206
How come Adi is here?
Shouldn't he wait till evening?

535
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,440
There is no school today
Papa came and took me back

536
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,638
Why is there no school today?

537
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,680

00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,678

543
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,105
Where is Arya?

544
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,647
She has gone to
Forum Mall with Baghya

545
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,035
ls Arya not here?

546
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,272

547
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:31,712
She has come
here on her own

548
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,541
Papa

549
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,536
From where did you
get this ice cream?

550
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,671
That uncle got this for me

551
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,239
Don't eat ice creams
given by strangers

552
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,506
I would get you one

553
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:56,510
When you got the judge post...
there was a specific...

554
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:59,138
...instruction for
security cover

555
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:02,078
Then you declined security cover
Now you say you want it immediately

556
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:04,375
You could have told me when
you received those phone calls

557
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:06,105
You are saying this
from yesterday

558
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:06,770
I told you...

559
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,570
Initially I took it
as a prank call

560
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,046
Sprouted from a cheap ego
that too a cheap publicity stunt

561
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:13,340
What did the commissioner say?

562
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,277
I have briefed
the commissioner

563
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,209
- Hello
- Hello Aravind

564
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,779
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning

565
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,638
Why is Mr.Markos here?

566
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,271
Actually he has filed
a complaint against you

567
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:28,538
Alleging trespass
breaking of furniture...

568
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,341
And terrorising his family

569
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:32,539
I just called him to
discuss about that

570
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,209
From the initial prank calls
and intimidations...

571
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,213
I thought it
could be Markos

572
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,212
About the drama that
took place at his house

573
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,143
It was just out of
my frustration

574
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:44,138
I am sorry...

575
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,543
I hope you can
understand my situation

576
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,079
It's ok
It's ok Mr.Aravind

577
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:48,135
I can understand you

578
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,305
Any one in those circumstances
would behave like that only

579
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,177
Besides...l felt my
behaviour was bad

580
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:54,371
It's ok

581
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,580
Great...that takes
care of it

582
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:59,012
Now the question is...
who is the real culprit?

583
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,047
Be assured Aravind
We will track

584
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,409
'Once again on behalf of
all teachers and staff'

585
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,641
'We thank Aravind sir
for gracing this occasion'

586
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:28,748
Someone is desperately
after me for something

587
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,438
You have a nice campus...

588
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,003
Thank you, sir
Thank you for your compliment

589
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,977
Thank you
What's your name baby?

590
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,738
You are not fit
to be ajudge

591
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,213
Resign and leave this place

592
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,206
That day the girl
said in Kannada...

593
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,143
lam not fit to be ajudge

594
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,636
Somebody thinks
lam not fit for this job

595
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,737
Your bonafides are
to be decided by...

596
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,043
State governor Chief justice
and Indian President

597
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,171
So every one else
can go to hell

598
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:09,144
Menon sir...

599
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,678
Please don't
look at me like this

600
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,714
lam not behind this...
Even Aravind has understood it

601
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,009
To physically harass
Aravind and his family...

602
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,408
I would never even dream

603
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:20,344
These people too
Whoever they are

604
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:23,539
They haven't tried to harm
me or my family

605
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,635
How do you say that?

606
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:27,304
They confined
Adi in school bus

607
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,675
He was locked
inside school bus

608
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,611
But they didn't switch off AC
He could breathe

609
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,011
The same thing happened
in the case of Sangeetha and Arya

610
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:34,239
But definitely...

611
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:37,508
Someone is trying to give
me a shock and disturb me

612
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,102
But why?

613
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,545
May be to get
something out of you

614
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,070
Could it be some old case?

615
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,314
Old clients or...
a defeated lawyers client...?

616
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,679
Such people would not
go for a round about way

617
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:54,579
They would tell
that on his face

618
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:58,582
Here they play a hide and
seek game and harass him

619
00:44:58,634 --> 00:44:59,738
That's not required

620
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:02,708
I thought I had a pretty
decent law career g uys

621
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:06,176
What could be the fault
from my side to hunt me?

622
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:08,275
I don't know
I really don't know

623
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:10,439
Chances for faults
from your side are less

624
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,343
No one can hate you...

625
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,276
To the best possible extent...
you have done justice

626
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,644
To court and conscience alike

627
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:20,506
What we can do immediately

628
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,410
If he calls you again
we can nab him

629
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,080
I have coordinated
with cyber cell

630
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,644
And you look in to
your files man

631
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,304
Deep
Real deep

632
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,075
Give me...

633
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:44,105
What are we looking for?

634
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,078
Without knowing that
did you grab the file from me

635
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:47,511
Give it to me

636
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,601
Raja n

637
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,438
What and where
do we start?

638
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,480
Aravind sir has
made a factual error

639
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:55,205
An error of facts

640
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,178
Will he commit
such a mistake?

641
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,675
That's what
we are looking for

642
00:45:58,767 --> 00:46:01,179
Anyway let's start
from the beginning

643
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,042
Especially criminal cases

644
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:18,543
- Sir
- Any updates?

645
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,044
Family calls and calls from
juniors for clarification

646
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,171
And then about 100
congratulation calls

647
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:25,713
There were prank
calls in between

648
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:27,974
I checked them
They are harmless

649
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:30,480
Wherever the call comes from
trace the exact location

650
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:31,409
Defenitely sir...

651
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,038
With in 30 seconds
land phone, duplicate...

652
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,410
...or stolen sim or
anything we trace

653
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:40,439
Sir...

654
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:45,979
Dear, what's the problem?

655
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,603
Neil says there
are no issues

656
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,179
Some professional rivalry

657
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,678
- That's all
- Is it?

658
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,680
He assured me
it's all sorted out

659
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:54,144
I will ask dad
to come there

660
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,477
Mom please, don't tell this
to dad and increase his BP

661
00:46:57,534 --> 00:46:59,241
Then what about
the offering to temple?

662
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,506
It's pending for a long time

663
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,103
He is very sloth in fulfilling...

664
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,202
It's a family call

665
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,211
- I will call back
- You carry on

666
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,008
- Sir
- Keep me informed

667
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:08,205
0k, sir

668
00:47:09,634 --> 00:47:12,672
Hello get the line fast

669
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:29,775
- Greet you
- Greet you

670
00:47:30,034 --> 00:47:32,446
I was about to visit you

671
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,444
But you said you were...

672
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,108
...fed up with felicitations
and citizen's receptions

673
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:41,976
In foreign lands
for all the problems...

674
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,378
...the church and
the parish faced

675
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,004
...you gave timely support

676
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:51,173
The parish would always
be grateful to you

677
00:47:52,134 --> 00:47:54,444
At the personal level...

678
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,107
I can't thank you enough
for what you've done for me

679
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,771
If you were not
there at that time...

680
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:07,449
Always in our prayers
you and your family

681
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,771
Will find a place
God's mercy will...

682
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,413
...always be with you in
your hean and abode

683
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:16,978
- 0k fine
- Please...

684
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,080
- Hello Aravind
- Hello, sir

685
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,677
It's long time
since I called you

686
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,141
Oh you are back...

687
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:10,536
Pradeep GPS track now

688
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:13,513
Ajay, call Neil sir
Quick

689
00:49:15,634 --> 00:49:17,443
Since you didn't
call for some days...

690
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,036
I thought you
have dropped the idea

691
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:20,511
Super sir
Super, keep talking

692
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,477
You have now understood
it is not lawyer Markos

693
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:24,104
Whom are you
going to target now?

694
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,271
You started the game
You tell me

695
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,570
- Are you sure?
- Closer to you, sir

696
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:30,612
Brigade Road area

697
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,170
Closest land mark
Levi's square, church street

698
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:34,746
Connect me to
Ashok Nagar Cl

699
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,071
Get the whole team there

700
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,241
One second...

701
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,408
Aravind, he is in Brigade road

702
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,136
Levi's square, church street

703
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,235
You keep on talking

704
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:52,472
Ok

705
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:56,474
Sorry George...

706
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,637
- Hello
- The talks end here sir

707
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,145
Soon you will know...

708
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,372
Who we all are
Soon

709
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:03,640
Very soon

710
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:27,606
I am almost there

711
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:00,511
Where is this guy?

712
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,707
Down Brigade road...
they are chasing him

713
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:11,634
Where is he?

714
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,373
See, they have
spotted him

715
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,071
You go home
I will handle this

716
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:16,703
My son is in the car
I will also come with you

717
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,143
Ask your men to
take care of him

718
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,110
Come

719
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,271
- 0k dear
- Papa

720
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:21,642
Take the car with you

721
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,112
Don't do that...

722
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,235
In hide and seek game...

723
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,644
...once the person is found
the game is over

724
00:53:32,634 --> 00:53:35,513
This game is not over yet

725
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,070
Clear off

726
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,737
Who the hell is this?

727
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:07,567
<i>Tiff </i>

728
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:37,580
Give me a fag

729
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,044
Who is this man?

730
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:44,112
Who is he?

731
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,608
Rather who was he?

732
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:49,511
Rem ember to have
seen him anywhere?

733
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,238
Like...think out of the box

734
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:53,974
Not connected to
your profession

735
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:56,173
Someone from
an oblique memory

736
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:58,672
No, not someone
I recollect

737
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,976
Could get nothing that
would reveal his identity

738
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,308
From his body

739
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:09,342
Without knowing who and why
he played hide and seek...

740
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,279
...he was after me
harassed and troubled me

741
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,479
...and finally in front of me

742
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:17,577
He is dead
It is all over

743
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:18,611
Let's leave it at that

744
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:20,704
What ever it may be
You leave it

745
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:23,410
How can I leave it?
It's about me

746
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,203
What's my role in his life?

747
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:28,371
What did I do?

748
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:32,179
What did I
I don't know

749
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,175
Did I do something?

750
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:37,645
Or did I failed
to do something?

751
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:39,270
Or is to make me
do something?

752
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,376
I am confused
I don't know

753
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,609
Where did I go wrong?

754
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:49,211
Aravind...

755
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,006
You...

756
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:58,467
<i>tiff </i>

757
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,577
You need not
trouble yourself

758
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:36,975
You may go home

759
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,306
What troubles I have...?

760
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,314
Until dad's tour is over
I have no work there

761
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:42,777
How are you lawyer sir?

762
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,774
All 0k?

763
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,071
All of you made me
stay here for 2 more days

764
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,271
Are you all happy now?

765
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:50,315
Reports look fair
Nothing to worry

766
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,108
Everything is normal

767
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,578
This is the problem
with doctors

768
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,146
They would not
say anything fully

769
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:56,770
Reports have come
They would give a pause there

770
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,377
What for
For no reason

771
00:57:58,467 --> 00:58:00,469
Aravind please
Doctor tell me

772
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:01,410
Tomorrow itself...

773
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,174
Why...even today
if you want you can go

774
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:06,475
Two days rest has done
a world of good to you

775
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,740
Check out any time
Take care

776
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,480
This is a stress induced
ischemic response

777
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:12,477
What do you mean?

778
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:13,706
That means nothing

779
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:16,008
I said he should
not strain much

780
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,307
If he strains...?

781
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,742
Mrs Aravind...he is
perfectly alright

782
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,476
My Aravind
you can do anything

783
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,342
- You have no issues
- Thank you...thank you

784
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,744
After me getting up from here
she should be treated here for 2 days

785
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,070
For anxiety neurosis

786
00:58:30,134 --> 00:58:32,136
Aravind, stop it

787
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:34,304
Take care, bye

788
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:37,278
Did you hear what
the doctor said?

789
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:39,574
It's all because
of my prayers

790
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:42,114
You should go to our place
and fulfill my prayers

791
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,113
Mom...going to our place to fulfill
prayers is tedious

792
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:47,148
We can fulfill prayers at
local Jalahalli Ayappan temple

793
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:48,975
Don't fiddle with God...

794
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:51,105
Ok, let me first
get up from here

795
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,679
Sangee take mom home

796
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:54,178
It will be troubles
for her here

797
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:55,575
Else she will again
start making offerings

798
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:57,773
- Go
- Come mom

799
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:12,510
Neil...Aravind sir only wanted
the dead guy's id and history

800
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:14,035
What sir?

801
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,340
On the same day
The day he was admitted

802
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:18,004
I got a message

803
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:19,974
No sir...we are checking

804
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:22,068
0k sir

805
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:23,771
Rajan bhai

806
00:59:24,267 --> 00:59:26,474
You are not going
to believe this

807
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:51,343
Roy stephen
Case number 1183

808
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,243
Resident of a place
near Puthanpuzha

809
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:04,245
Liji KattingaFs
harassment case's...

810
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,075
...seventh accused is this guy

811
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:12,978
Out of the 38 accused persons
only 8 persons were convicted finally

812
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:14,707
One among
them was Roy

813
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:20,267
<i>tiff </i>

814
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:59,141
So this case was handled by Aravind

815
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:00,712
And some mistakes
by Aravind in this case

816
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,076
Aravind has no
connection with this case

817
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:05,113
Then
Why do they...

818
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,745
In the harassment case...

819
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,246
court punished all the 8 persons
for rigorous imprisonment

820
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,109
After 2 to 3 years
of the judgment...

821
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,373
Liji got married

822
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,572
She went for
counseling to a church

823
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:17,046
John of the counseling
centre married her

824
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,981
Father Kuriyedathu helped
them to get married

825
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:26,642
"Did memories..."

826
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:32,778
"Shower delicately"

827
01:01:33,034 --> 01:01:38,575
"At a distance..."

828
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:44,540
"Did it sing melodies of pain?"

829
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,973
"In the damp little eyes"

830
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:56,985
"Did the other half travel?"

831
01:01:57,067 --> 01:02:02,779
"Was it full moon or mist?"

832
01:02:03,134 --> 01:02:08,641
"Did memories..."

833
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,006
"Shower delicately"

834
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,169
On the 3rd day
Roy and company...

835
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:22,770
...were released from jail
Liji went missing

836
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,671
Missing...

837
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:26,146
But in all probability
she was murdered

838
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,372
Her blood was spread
all over the bedroom

839
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,105
With so much blood loss...

840
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,373
...chances of survival
would have been remote

841
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:35,674
That was the Forensic report

842
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:38,510
The body hasn't
been found till date

843
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,077
But tell me...

844
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,373
How is Aravind
connected with this?

845
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,447
On suspicion
the first person...

846
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,343
...to be arrested was John
Liji's husband

847
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:48,471
Court punished him
on charges of murder

848
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:50,639
Then the case came
to the higher court

849
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,045
Aravind appeared forjohn
at the appellate court

850
01:02:54,134 --> 01:02:55,579
For a criminal case...

851
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:58,706
...that was Aravind sir's
last appearance

852
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,543
I appear for the accused John
in crime 32110 your honour

853
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:10,208
John was an inmate of
an orphanage run by the church

854
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:14,206
I know him from
his younger days

855
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:16,177
John would not do this

856
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,372
Aguy like him
can't do it

857
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:23,141
This society excluded that girl

858
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,770
John brought her back
to mainstream life

859
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,071
Will he ruin that?

860
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:33,547
My and the parish's
hope lies with you

861
01:03:33,634 --> 01:03:35,170

864

Hide and seek
Is it not?

865
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,671
Yes, sir
Hide and seek

866
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:14,409
To prove my client is
completely innocent

867
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:16,378
I want to present
one more witness

868
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,271
I request the permission of the court

869
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,081
To the court, John
and to all of us...

870
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,074
Liji was playing
a hide and seek game

871
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,044
Ason of hide and
go seeking game

872
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,637
Hide and seek game

873
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,310
- What is all this Aravind?
- Yes, your honour

874
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:43,338
She will end the hide and seek game
and appear before the court now

875
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:49,546
Suspected to be
dead or murdered...

876
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:51,977
...or believed to be so
at least by some people

877
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:55,480
My client John's wife
Liji alias Liji John

878
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:58,274
I hope you are serious

879
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,574
Absolutely your honour
At the count of 3...

880
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:03,104
Before I count 3...

881
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,511
Liji John Kattingal would
enter through this door

882
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,570
May I...?

883
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,170
One

884
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:17,504
Two

885
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,272
And three

886
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:35,176
What's happening
counsel Aravind?

887
01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:37,077
Liji John is not there

888
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,344
Mr.Aravind
Is this a place for fun?

889
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,504
No your honour

890
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:47,241
There is a suspicion that
Liji John is not yet dead

891
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,404
A belief

892
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:51,715
That's what made every one
including the honourablejudge...

893
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,002
...to look at the entrance

894
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,511
And that's my point

895
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,171
Those present here
are not sure about a death...

896
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,507
My client is accused of such a murder
and the proceedings are on

897
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:09,771
The real culprits are playing
this hide and seek game

898
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,776
People who mercilessly
torn Liji's innocence in the woods

899
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:14,637
They are still roaming free

900
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,712
They are the people
your honour playing...

901
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,110
...hide and seek with
the court and justice

902
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,703
They should be
brought before justice

903
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,677
When we were
appearing for him

904
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:27,247
John was let free
But when reinvestigation...

905
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,337
was ordered all the 8 guys
were arrested again

906
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,075
Because evidences were not clear
many times they were let out

907
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:35,977
One fellow committed suicide
ne guy called Rajasekaran

908
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:37,375
And now Roy...

909
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,538
So because the case was
redirected against them...

910
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,170
...they are hunting Aravind

911
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,542
May be they are innocent

912
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,277
It is clear John did not do it

913
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,506
Then who did it?

914
01:06:47,134 --> 01:06:52,379
Liji disappearance or murder
is anyway in cold storage now

915
01:06:52,534 --> 01:06:54,013
An unresolved case

916
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:57,443
Crime branch could not
get her body until now

917
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,441
One guy committed suicide

918
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,669
Another guy died
in an accident now

919
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,071
This would not end here

920
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:11,482
Markos, can you file a petition
to reopen the Liji Kattingal missing case?

921
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,274
Should we do that Aravind?

922
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:17,709
That would embarrass you
especially in your present status

923
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:21,571
You are risking
your career man

924
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,442
Youngest judge to High Court

925
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,070
Clean track records

926
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:27,010
Should you
disregard all these?

927
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:29,142
That is a sure risk Aravind

928
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,043
- Let's leave it
- How?

929
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,572
There are 6 more guys
left out to hunt me

930
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,774
Elsel should prove
they are not the accused

931
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:41,037
Ideally Aravind
You shouldn't have to do this

932
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:44,740
But unfortunately in this case
we don't have a good handle...

933
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,440
...on your old cases
That's our problem

934
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:50,438
Not only your career

935
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:53,480
It's also about the future
of yourjuniors and firm

936
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:56,005
Then I will do it myself

937
01:07:56,067 --> 01:07:57,341
Will you not be at our place?

938
01:07:57,434 --> 01:07:59,414
I will be there
But what I say is...

939
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,970
...don't take the entire
load on your head

940
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,009
It's ajudgemental
error on my pan

941
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,169
If there's a mistake
it should be corrected

942
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:11,478
Else if you appear before my court
though you may not think so...

943
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,204
...my conscience will bark at me
that I am not fit for this job

944
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,313
Bury your past my friend

945
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:19,671
Past is like your shadow

946
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:22,213
It will always be with you
for the entire life

947
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,614
But I want to clear
certain things for myself

948
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,477
Good morning madam

949
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:36,236
When did you come?

950
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:39,170
Yesterday I had
a deep cerebration

951
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,475
We will get back
to our village

952
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,638
You can make all
your temple offerings

953
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:46,373
I also have to settle
some old commitments there

954
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:48,573
Oh my God
Seriously

955
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:51,444
Everything is ready

956
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,276
We will leave the kids
with your parents

957
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,346
Everybody needs
a reason to pray

958
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,104
Me too

959
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:11,543
Aravind wants this case
to be re investigated

960
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,010
Who knows
the ways of Jesus

961
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,374
He is still at Puthanpuzha

962
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:23,084
He does sundry jobs at the dam
runs a ferry boat anticipating her return

963
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:27,013
John still believes
she is alive

964
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:04,669
Relax

965
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,014
Those days my priority was
to save you from the case

966
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:10,375
Then no one thought about...

967
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:13,175
...your point of view or
what you had in mind

968
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:13,972
That's why...

969
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:16,571
I never accused
those 8 guys

970
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:20,112
Then why are they
after you, sir?

971
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,043
Their view is that...

972
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,407
I have redirected
the case against them

973
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:26,777
Sir, you are going to
become ajudge

974
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:30,982
If you go after this case again
will not they harm you and your family

975
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:32,978
I can take care of that

976
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:35,410
How about you?
Are you ok?

977
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:38,744
I am ok sir
I can't leave this place

978
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,981
Because she is here

979
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:43,773
Somewhere here
in this nature

980
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:48,512
Did you ever feel
Liji was afraid of someone...

981
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:51,375
...or was trying to hide
something from you

982
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:53,413
Any change in her behaviour?

983
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,173
<i>She was W“! “"19?!
V9“! 'WNW</i>

984
01:10:59,234 --> 01:11:00,577
What was the reason?

985
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,374
Those guys only
killed my daughter

986
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:43,504
But poor John was trapped

987
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:46,445
DySP Sajan was
colluding with them

988
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:49,639
Could not even
see her dead body

989
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:53,606
Who knows where it is?

990
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,141
Did they say anything to you
regarding their suspicions?

991
01:12:29,634 --> 01:12:31,341
Might be my fault...

992
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,145
If they have anything to tell me
ask them to meet me in person...

993
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:36,673
...or ask them to call me

994
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:37,768
Clear?

995
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,107
Have you guys
swallowed a pumpkin?

996
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:48,769
Come out man

997
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,479
We have said it in court

998
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:52,775
We raped her
But we did not kill her

999
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,241
After the first punishment...

1000
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:57,076
...on the 4th day we went to meet Liji
to seek her pardon

1001
01:12:57,167 --> 01:13:00,376
The dead Rajasekaran sir
the person who committed suicide

1002
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:02,606
...was a senior
government official

1003
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:06,237
For the wrong we did
we were punished with a jail term

1004
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:08,972
But it does not end there

1005
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:13,077
We say this for the sake
of our conscience

1006
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:15,577
Please tell this
specially to John

1007
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:18,578
I assure you both a job...

1008
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:23,541
...with a permanent income
and pension a government job

1009
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,576
Rajettan promised
this to Liji and John

1010
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,412
When we did all this
Why should we kill Liji?

1011
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:33,111
If you accept the job
and live happily

1012
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,510
We would get some
peace of mind

1013
01:13:38,134 --> 01:13:39,511
We did not kill Liji

1014
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:41,205
Aravind sir himself
must prove this

1015
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:42,405
It's for that...

1016
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,971
However you justify
there's no reason to harass...

1017
01:13:46,034 --> 01:13:47,775
...or haunt Aravind

1018
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:49,277
Is it?

1019
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,243
I only arrested John

1020
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,109
For circumstantial evidences

1021
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,740
As you guess I wanted
to save those 8 guys

1022
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,571
Was the dead...sorry the guy

1023
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:04,978
...who committed suicide
Rajasekarn your relative?

1024
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:06,045
Yes...

1025
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,280
When he got bail
in the murder case...

1026
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:09,642
...he committed suicide

1027
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:12,003
You saved John
But you did not stop there

1028
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:14,103
You redirected
the case against them

1029
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,337
They have suffered a lot, sir

1030
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:18,574
For what they did
and what they did not do

1031
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,077
They lost everything

1032
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,414
When they knew about
your appointment as judge they regrouped

1033
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:26,103
They m ust get justice

1034
01:14:26,234 --> 01:14:28,646
Roy and Rajettan
died for that sake

1035
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,138
They don't know
who killed Liji

1036
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,407
They did not do it

1037
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:35,514
They trust you to
clear their names...

1038
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:38,748
Only for that
they were after you...

1039
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,446
They would not
trouble you anymore

1040
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:43,577
Trust me

1041
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:48,305
Thank you

1042
01:15:23,134 --> 01:15:24,772
Hello Menon sir

1043
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:27,406
I am at the record
room of the court

1044
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,377
No sir
Neil met all 6 of them

1045
01:15:29,534 --> 01:15:33,505
This could done
by somebody else

1046
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:34,511
Otherwise...

1047
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,102
Yes, can think
on those lines too

1048
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,678
Hope Aravind sir would
have informed you

1049
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:52,542
Why all on a sudden
this development?

1050
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:54,103
Just a recheck
That's all

1051
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,613
Father...where were
you on that day?

1052
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:17,546
Adi...have you done
your home work?

1053
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,205
Very good

1054
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,604
Papa...

1055
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:25,637
Papa has gone out now

1056
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:30,671
Mom could not
reach his phone

1057
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,571
I would ask him to call you

1058
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:49,641
Aravind pick up...

1059
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:32,303
Is that not
the way to reservoir?

1060
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,437
Sir, that is the old
road to reservoir

1061
01:17:34,634 --> 01:17:36,614
Now no one uses that road

1062
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:40,376
If we go straight and turn
to the left we would reach reservoir

1063
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,407
From this point
vehicles don't go

1064
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,378
Better to walk from here

1065
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:13,010
That was the house
where Liji and John lived

1066
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:16,976
Now some Bengali plantation
workers live there

1067
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,546
I'll clear them now

1068
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:24,307
Guys...come out

1069
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,442
Come
Go from here

1070
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:28,371
Quick
Quick

1071
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,745
Go there

1072
01:20:58,267 --> 01:20:59,211
No...tell me

1073
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,337
That...Aravind

1074
01:21:01,434 --> 01:21:02,970
What happened to Aravind?

1075
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,011
Where are you now?

1076
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:06,479
We are now at
a Puthenpuzha guest house

1077
01:21:06,534 --> 01:21:09,140
Of late Aravind
is very aloof

1078
01:21:09,234 --> 01:21:11,077
Haven't you finished
your offerings?

1079
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,612
That's all done

1080
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:16,044
But frequently
he goes somewhere

1081
01:21:17,301 --> 01:21:20,248
When I ask him
he gives vague replies

1082
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:24,340
While at Bangalore
you said there are no issues now

1083
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:25,742
Could there be
anything else?

1084
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,241
What else could be
there Sangeetha?

1085
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:30,211
He has some
official commitments

1086
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:31,143
That's all

1087
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,008
Commitments
Aravind also said this

1088
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:36,439
Neil tell me the truth

1089
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,669
ls Aravind having an affair?

1090
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:41,576
Affair?
For Aravind?

1091
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:45,578
No use in being
the wife of an high court judge

1092
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:47,647
A woman is always a woman

1093
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:49,736
Sangeetha there is
nothing like that

1094
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,138
I assure you

1095
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,111
Aravind is a one woman man

1096
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:57,011
I was tensed
Shall I hang up?

1097
01:21:58,501 --> 01:21:59,571
Jesus

1098
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:05,078
Best
Next one...

1099
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,006
Hello

1100
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:32,111
She was the only one for me

1101
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,407
But we didn't kill her

1102
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:41,108
lam sure guys who
raped her killed her

1103
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,646
Severe blood loss
Death is sure

1104
01:22:44,034 --> 01:22:46,412
All evidences are
fully against John

1105
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:49,011
But could not
locate the body

1106
01:22:49,134 --> 01:22:52,547
No body no murder
is the judicial dictum

1107
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:56,648
After John left for night duty
me and Lizi had dinner together

1108
01:22:56,734 --> 01:22:58,441
She was very happy

1109
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:00,275
Even otherwise
there were no issues

1110
01:23:00,367 --> 01:23:02,472
Night around 2 AM...

1111
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:05,138
I sawa bike going
through that way

1112
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:06,473
John does not own a bike

1113
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:10,174
For bringing disrepute to family
her dad said in the liquor shop

1114
01:23:10,267 --> 01:23:11,974
...he himself would kill her

1115
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,480
That guy cannot do this, sir

1116
01:23:14,534 --> 01:23:15,512
He is a good QUE!

1117
01:23:15,567 --> 01:23:17,274
This is done by the black man

1118
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,369
I know him
from his childhood

1119
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,606
He was brought up
in my orphanage

1120
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,442
Local MLA is involved
in this case

1121
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,344
But so far no action is
initiated against him

1122
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,436
Before I count 3...

1123
01:23:28,501 --> 01:23:31,607
Liji Kattingal would come
through this entrance

1124
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:32,739
May I?

1125
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,138
- Neil
- Where are you?

1126
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:40,608
- I am here
- At the court?

1127
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,236
Yes at the district court

1128
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:43,971
Nothing
I am alright

1129
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:46,007
You need not come

1130
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:50,343
Neil, I think the killer is here

1131
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:55,580
When I was arguing John's case
he was in the courtroom

1132
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:58,314
Following me
like my shadow

1133
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,075
All his attention was on me

1134
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:03,568
lam sure

1135
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,180
123 Right

1136
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:49,271
456Left

1137
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:51,533
123 Right

1138
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,605
456Left

1139
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,112
123 Right

1140
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:58,204
456Left

1141
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,474
123 Right

1142
01:25:00,534 --> 01:25:02,639
456Left

1143
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,273
At the count of 3

1144
01:25:11,134 --> 01:25:12,772
When I count 3

1145
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:16,141
Liji John Kattingal will come
through this entrance

1146
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,302
Aravind...

1147
01:25:50,134 --> 01:25:52,080
Good morning
Get ready quickly

1148
01:25:52,134 --> 01:25:53,636
We have to go
to a place

1149
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,639
Take milk and paper
Make a tea for me

1150
01:25:56,767 --> 01:25:58,542
Come, let me
tell you something

1151
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:01,045
I got him

1152
01:26:02,267 --> 01:26:04,110
- Whom?
- Hide and seek

1153
01:26:05,134 --> 01:26:06,613
I said when I count 123...

1154
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,543
Liji would come
Do you remember that?

1155
01:26:08,634 --> 01:26:10,272
He was there in
the court room

1156
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:12,438
He was in
the very court itself

1157
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:13,668
Really?

1158
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:16,747
She will end
the hide and seek game...

1159
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:18,571
...and appear before
the court now

1160
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:20,009
1

1161
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:26,606
When I finished counting 3
all of them looked at the entrance

1162
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:34,343
Judge, bench clerk, advocates
police officers visitors all of them

1163
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:36,146
...except one person

1164
01:26:37,634 --> 01:26:41,309
Everybody everybody
except one

1165
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:43,669
When everybody was
looking at the entrance...

1166
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:45,769
One person alone looked down

1167
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,405
Because he knew
no one would come

1168
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,480
He alone knew
she is not alive

1169
01:26:52,567 --> 01:26:56,208
Because he is the one
who killed her

1170
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:02,675
That was him...

1171
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,037
The guy whom I saved
from the noose

1172
01:27:05,134 --> 01:27:07,011
My client John

1173
01:27:30,634 --> 01:27:33,615
Though DySP Sajan
tried to save his relative...

1174
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:36,204
...all his circumstantial
evidences were right

1175
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:38,076
When it was evident
the case would be lost...

1176
01:27:38,134 --> 01:27:39,306
Father Kuriyedathu met me

1177
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:41,711
Because of my acquaintance
and closeness with Father

1178
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:44,043
I took that brief
and won the case

1179
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:47,741
And that case happens to be
my last criminal case

1180
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:53,047
May be because the court left him free
there was no investigation on him again

1181
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,203
It was because of
an error on my pan

1182
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:59,976
An error, a mistake
and a negligence

1183
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:02,474
Without any reason
two persons have died

1184
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:04,478
Should we not
find out the truth?

1185
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,305
For what?

1186
01:28:05,401 --> 01:28:06,709
Just out of curiosity

1187
01:28:06,767 --> 01:28:08,974
No, for justice

1188
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,103
But still a question
remains unanswered

1189
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:13,975
Body...

1190
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:16,246
I have a guess

1191
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,450
Don't know if he said that knowingly
or unknowingly other than deliberate...

1192
01:28:23,134 --> 01:28:25,011
...utterances
he divulged this also

1193
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,981
She is here living
somewhere in this nature

1194
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:34,278
We have to find out that
Shall we?

1195
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:38,138
His childhood was not good

1196
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:41,774
He was treated for
psychological disorder

1197
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:45,410
After that he was counseled
at the church's counseling centre

1198
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:47,572
John was not
interested in marriage

1199
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:50,137
Specially because
Lizi was a rape victim

1200
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:52,339
Because of Father
Kuriyedathu's compulsion

1201
01:28:52,434 --> 01:28:54,311
John agreed for marriage

1202
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,438
Father thought after marriage
everything will become alright

1203
01:28:57,567 --> 01:29:00,605
If John was caught
that would embarrass the Diocese itself

1204
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,304
Probably because of that...

1205
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:04,345
Father would have
hidden all these

1206
01:29:04,434 --> 01:29:06,436
This is a very old case

1207
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,108
Diagonised with
bipolar disorder

1208
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:13,477
He was discharged after
complete recovery

1209
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:21,582
Ok
Right

1210
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,279
The place where
John now lives is locked

1211
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,505
He has not yet
gone to the resort

1212
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:29,739
Don't allow

1213
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:32,710
Just a casual inquiry

1214
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,713
We need him
So no action

1215
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:39,207
Tell me Kurup

1216
01:29:42,534 --> 01:29:43,604
What's it?

1217
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,412
John met Liji for first time
at the church's counseling centre

1218
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,377
He was her counselor

1219
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:53,643
Irony is that he had also gone
there for counseling...

1220
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:55,246
Really?

1221
01:29:55,467 --> 01:29:58,243
For delinquent behaviour
Bipolar disorder

1222
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:02,148
- Don't tell me
- Ya, he was insane

1223
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,407
An insanity that
can't be cured

1224
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,338
- Wait
- What?

1225
01:30:09,234 --> 01:30:10,474
Back

1226
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:16,568
This way?

1227
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:18,104
Sure

1228
01:30:20,734 --> 01:30:23,271
If my suspicion is right

1229
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,572
After the arrest of John

1230
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:28,045
Sajan prepared
a case diary

1231
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:29,409
I went through it

1232
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:33,240
His observation on how
the murder could have taken place

1233
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:35,974
Liji, I am going
Bolt the door

1234
01:30:36,034 --> 01:30:38,275
As planned
with everyone noticing...

1235
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,404
John goes to
resort for night duty

1236
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,175
But without anyone noticing
he gets in to house...

1237
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:45,578
...through back door and hides

1238
01:33:12,601 --> 01:33:13,671
I told you...

1239
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:15,569
John unwittingly uttered this

1240
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,146
But I am sure
this is where he brought her

1241
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:20,744
There is no water current here

1242
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,404
Hence the body did not
surface anywhere

1243
01:33:22,467 --> 01:33:24,105
If she was tied to
some heavy stone...

1244
01:33:24,234 --> 01:33:26,305
...the body would
go down deep

1245
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:18,178
She is here

1246
01:34:24,067 --> 01:34:25,546
Liji is here, Neil

1247
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:28,169
Playing hide and seek with us

1248
01:34:40,034 --> 01:34:42,480
At any cost
we must take her out

1249
01:34:42,567 --> 01:34:43,978
At least her remains

1250
01:34:44,034 --> 01:34:45,604
Then only we can
bring an end to this

1251
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:47,475
- Can you orgainise?
- Sure

1252
01:34:47,567 --> 01:34:49,513
- <i>Now?
- Ya</i>

1253
01:34:49,567 --> 01:34:52,480
But I can't do it
staying here with a mobile phone

1254
01:34:52,534 --> 01:34:54,241
We have to deal
with our police team

1255
01:34:54,334 --> 01:34:56,143
We have to go
and collect them

1256
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,178
Come, let's go

1257
01:34:57,267 --> 01:34:58,746
0k, I will wait
You go

1258
01:34:59,001 --> 01:34:59,979
Sure

1259
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,008
Sorry Sangee

1260
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,977
lam sorry I left
without informing you

1261
01:35:32,067 --> 01:35:34,638
Anyway when I return
there will be an interesting story

1262
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:36,771
A story that you can
never forget in life

1263
01:35:37,034 --> 01:35:37,774
It's true, sir

1264
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,707
This story can't
be easily forgotten

1265
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:40,609
Who is it?

1266
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,475
Story of a mad guy
killing a whore

1267
01:35:42,567 --> 01:35:43,307
Isn't it?

1268
01:35:43,367 --> 01:35:45,005
Where are you?

1269
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:47,339
John what you want?

1270
01:35:47,434 --> 01:35:49,004
What is your idea?
Where is Sangee?

1271
01:35:49,067 --> 01:35:51,445
She has also become
a pan of the story, sir

1272
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,079
John, don't try
to deceive me

1273
01:36:01,134 --> 01:36:02,238
Where are you?
Tell me

1274
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,973
Head straight to west

1275
01:36:04,067 --> 01:36:06,069
How to find west and
east in a forest?

1276
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:08,977
Look at the sun, sir
That's the way

1277
01:36:41,334 --> 01:36:42,711
Ask them to come fast

1278
01:36:45,701 --> 01:36:46,611
Fast fast

1279
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,407
- Hello...
- Quick Fast

1280
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:51,311
Sir we would start with what is
available in the range office

1281
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:54,007
We would get some
help from reservoir staff

1282
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,104
Besides tomorrow upper Managala dam
huttters are to be opened

1283
01:36:57,201 --> 01:36:59,147
So we need to
do it tonight itself

1284
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,604
John

1285
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:03,439
John

1286
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,670
You...

1287
01:37:12,734 --> 01:37:13,644
Where is she?

1288
01:37:13,734 --> 01:37:14,712
Where is Sangee?

1289
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:16,144
She is here, sir

1290
01:37:16,201 --> 01:37:18,147
I don't know
boxing or wrestling

1291
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:20,145
But your wife is with me

1292
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:21,235
Let's go there

1293
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:22,143
Where?

1294
01:37:46,734 --> 01:37:48,270
That's not working

1295
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,612
It's for you
So start rowing

1296
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:10,710
It's all your mistake...

1297
01:38:10,767 --> 01:38:12,678
I was about to
run away from this country

1298
01:38:12,734 --> 01:38:14,441
Father made
all arrangements

1299
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:16,708
Ticket, visa and other things

1300
01:38:16,801 --> 01:38:19,407
All of us could have
moved forward in life

1301
01:38:19,534 --> 01:38:24,483
But I was trapped
by those 8 bastards

1302
01:38:25,067 --> 01:38:26,705
Havel not lost
everything, sir?

1303
01:38:26,801 --> 01:38:29,008
Should have
left those dead

1304
01:38:38,301 --> 01:38:40,372
Your comfort woman
is in that boat

1305
01:38:40,467 --> 01:38:41,343
Stop it man

1306
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,504
Row fast, sir

1307
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,304
It's better to
reach there fast

1308
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,708
It's an old boat

1309
01:38:46,234 --> 01:38:48,236
Water must have
started seeping in

1310
01:39:07,067 --> 01:39:09,069
What you need
is treatment John

1311
01:39:09,267 --> 01:39:11,247
Fear out of illusory
perception is a disease

1312
01:39:11,334 --> 01:39:15,282
For 2 years I exhibited
my love to her that was not real

1313
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:21,476
I tolerated a lot, sir

1314
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:25,114
But that day
it was intolerable

1315
01:39:26,434 --> 01:39:28,277
She was so happy...

1316
01:39:28,401 --> 01:39:30,210
Blissful as though
she got something

1317
01:39:30,267 --> 01:39:32,474
Second day out of the jail
those guys came there...

1318
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:34,171
...along with the pimp-her dad

1319
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:36,305
That too when I was away

1320
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,547
She said those
8 guys raped her

1321
01:39:49,634 --> 01:39:51,375
But she invited
those 8 guys to home

1322
01:39:51,434 --> 01:39:54,040
And entertained them
That wench should be...

1323
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:01,544
- Santhosh
- Sir

1324
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,037
Has the divers come?
They have come

1325
01:40:04,134 --> 01:40:04,771
Come here

1326
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,070
Sangee

1327
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:11,043
Sangee

1328
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:15,241
Sangee

1329
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:23,580
I told you sir it is an old boat
and water would seep in...

1330
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:26,045
But I was talking
about this boat

1331
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,043
It is time for parting, sir

1332
01:40:36,134 --> 01:40:38,114
All these time
she was with you

1333
01:40:38,201 --> 01:40:39,441
She was near your feet

1334
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:40,707
But you never noticed it

1335
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:43,111
That's your wife's fate

1336
01:41:03,067 --> 01:41:05,069
That will not work, sir

1337
01:41:05,367 --> 01:41:07,244
There is no oar too

1338
01:41:08,534 --> 01:41:09,774
Sangeetha...

1339
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,308
Dam is very deep

1340
01:41:11,367 --> 01:41:13,574
You can't escape
by swimming, sir

1341
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:15,672
Sangeetha, don't panic

1342
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:17,236
I am there
I am there

1343
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,176
Relax

1344
01:41:24,567 --> 01:41:25,637
Relax, sir

1345
01:41:25,734 --> 01:41:27,771
Seeing us
going down to depth...

1346
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,240
Sit there, sir

1347
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,171

the wretched corpse would...

1348
01:41:44,234 --> 01:41:46,077
...surface again and again

1349
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,540
Sorry madam
I am a bit...

1350
01:41:50,734 --> 01:41:52,736
But your husband is normal

1351
01:41:53,034 --> 01:41:55,105

Not to blackmail
you and escape

1357
01:43:05,534 --> 01:43:07,207
All these days she
has betrayed you

1358
01:43:07,301 --> 01:43:08,712
At a time when
you were away...

1359
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:11,077
She secretly invited
her college days lover

1360
01:43:11,134 --> 01:43:12,670

Do you know...?
What was it?

1371
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,506
Was it the apology
by those 8 guys?

1372
01:44:28,567 --> 01:44:29,204
No...

1373
01:44:29,267 --> 01:44:31,269
Was that the promised job?

1374
01:44:31,367 --> 01:44:31,970
No

1375
01:44:32,034 --> 01:44:34,674
I have heard all these sir
It was all a drama

1376
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,475
Would you call
her pregnancy through...

1377
01:44:37,534 --> 01:44:39,275
...an insane guy
like you a drama?

1378
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:41,040
She came happily
to share that with you

1379
01:44:41,101 --> 01:44:42,444
Would you call it a drama?

1380
01:44:42,534 --> 01:44:43,444
Sir...

1381
01:44:43,534 --> 01:44:45,172
What are you saying, sir?

1382
01:44:45,234 --> 01:44:46,372
Haven't you understood?

1383
01:44:46,467 --> 01:44:48,970
She was pregnant
bearing your child

1384
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:51,739
She came running to
share that with you

1385
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:53,974
She came to know
about it that day

1386
01:44:54,034 --> 01:44:57,072
You had neither patience
nor time to hear her

1387
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:58,669
You were brainsick

1388
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:01,038
You killed her

1389
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:10,509
I didn't know about it, sir

1390
01:45:12,701 --> 01:45:14,703
She did not say
anything to me

1391
01:45:16,001 --> 01:45:17,674
You are merely
telling some stories

1392
01:45:17,734 --> 01:45:19,338
I saw the autopsy report

1393
01:45:19,434 --> 01:45:21,345
The report says
she was pregnant

1394
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,737
She wanted to share this
as a surprise news to you

1395
01:45:25,034 --> 01:45:28,572
But that poor girl did not know
you had a different surprise for her

1396
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,542
How did you come to
know she was pregnant?

1397
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:43,603

Where was the body
to do postmortem?

1401
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,211
Body is lying here

1402
01:45:55,301 --> 01:45:57,372
I only dropped her here
