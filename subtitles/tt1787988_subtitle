1
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:22,971
lt's only the night that
brings the forbidden to life

2
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:30,416
The streets open their arms
to whoever passes by

3
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,959
This is the path for lost souls

4
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,966
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye

5
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:50,061
A mask is worn to cover the lie

6
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:54,069
lt's so festive all around

7
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:57,675
Even then only loneliness abounds

8
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:03,249
Yesterday in these very lanes,
in these crushed flowers

9
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,254
There was such a high

10
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:10,951
Now only thirsty spirits,
wracked in agony

11
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:14,962
Seem to wander by

12
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,898
All searching for the same thing

13
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,733
Not knowing the futility it will bring

14
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:42,282
This is the path for lost souls

15
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:45,986
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye

16
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,997
A mask is worn to cover the lie

17
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:54,297
lt's so festive all around

18
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:57,805
Even then only loneliness abounds

19
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:03,272
Between the lights
and among the shadows

20
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,008
An unhappy secret exists

21
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:09,011
Why is it here?

22
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:14,916
What has happened
for such anger to persist

23
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,949
Tell me oh dark night

24
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,758
Nothing escapes your sight

25
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,012
This is the path for lost souls

26
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:46,014
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye

27
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:50,314
A mask is worn to cover the lie

28
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,328
lt's so festive all around

29
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,025
Even then only loneliness abounds

30
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,996
Here a smile doesn't reach the eye

31
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,297
A mask is worn to cover the lie

32
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:10,333
lt's so festive all around

33
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,314
Even then only loneliness abounds

34
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:57,909
Good morning, sir.

35
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,317
Devrath Kulkarni.

36
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,610
So what happened here?

37
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,918
An accident, sir.
The car crashed into the sea.

38
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:06,824
l've heard a lot about you...

39
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,726
it's an honour to work with you.

40
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:27,373
The car came speeding down the road...

41
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:28,813
and then it swerved...

42
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,510
like... like this...

43
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:32,913
straight into the sea.

44
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:34,284
Where were you?

45
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,822
l was sitting over there.

46
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:37,386
Sir...

47
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,722
Pinky knew something
was about to happen.

48
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,022
She warned us...

49
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,854
but we ignored her.

50
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,422
Who is Pinky?

51
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:53,501
- Another witness.
- Hello, sir.

52
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,469
That was the only car on the road.

53
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:57,838
Anything else on the road?

54
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,811
There was absolutely
nothing on the road...

55
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,008
l saw it...

56
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:25,401
Sir, please come here.

57
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,276
- Get a stretcher.

58
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,471
That's Armaan Kapoor.

59
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,707
Check if there's any lD.

60
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:35,907
The doors were locked...

61
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,918
he was also wearing the seatbelt.

62
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,586
lt is him.

63
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,477
Thank you.

64
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,940
What's going on here?

65
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:11,349
Move away... all of you.

66
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,684
We'll get to the bottom of this.

67
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:17,421
Here.

68
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,802
What happened to Ramu, our driver?

69
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:30,800
ls he...

70
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,063
Mr. Kapoor was driving...

71
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,338
he was alone.

72
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,500
Alone?

73
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:39,945
What about Yuvraj?

74
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,072
His spotboy...

75
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,946
he accompanies Armaan everywhere.

76
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,753
There was no one else in the car.

77
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,452
But, Armaan...

78
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,524
Armaan was never on his own.

79
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,959
l don't get it...

80
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,035
why was he driving?
He hates driving.

81
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,000
Get Ramu and Yuvraj's number...

82
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,267
talk to them.

83
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:17,876
Good morning, mom.

84
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:20,715
What's wrong, mom?

85
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,692
- Film star Armaan Kapoor
met with an accident...

86
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,928
last night on Seaface road.

87
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,767
He died in the crash.

88
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:41,468
- Seaface road is part
of Mumbai's underbelly...

89
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:44,443
famous for the red light area nearby.

90
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:47,640
lt is not clear what Armaan Kapoor...

91
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,615
- was doing here last night.

92
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,649
- Meanwhile Sonya Kapoor's brother,
Teji Singh has stated that...

93
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,621
- the family is not satisfied
with the police statement...

94
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,920
- that it was merely an accident.

95
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,460
Right now, we need time to
deal with this tragedy...

96
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:02,894
- only then can we
take any legal recourse.

97
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:05,296
- We still don't know
what really happened.

98
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,596
What's wrong, Juhi?
Lost your husband?

99
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:11,897
Bhai...

100
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:13,932
Bhai...

101
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,042
Armaan Kapoor is dead.

102
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,605
What?

103
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,443
Armaan Kapoor, the actor...

104
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,273
here on Seaface road.

105
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,686
Are you serious?

106
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,483
That's where l'm coming from...

107
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:29,523
it's chaos down there.

108
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,684
The press is all over
questioning the junkies.

109
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,354
So, you really met him last night?

110
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,598
l thought you were bluffing.

111
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:38,495
Whom did you meet?

112
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:39,498
Shut up!

113
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,364
You have only one good leg...

114
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,767
how about l break that too?

115
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,772
Jinxed bastard...
always arrives with bad news.

116
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,438
Here, get us breakfast.

117
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:50,544
Move it!

118
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,676
Poor guy, you are so mean to him.

119
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,787
Never repeat what l say to you...

120
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,348
in front of others.

121
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:06,715
Get it?

122
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,595
Sorry.

123
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,766
l said, l'm sorry!

124
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:27,574
- Sir, is the underworld involved in
Armaan Kapoor's death?

125
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,651
- That's all the information
we have right now.

126
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,286
l'm here outside
Armaan Kapoor's place...

127
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,379
he lived in an apartment
on the top floor.

128
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:38,721
People have been pouring in
to offer their condolences...

129
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:50,699
Where is Sonya?

130
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,635
She's upstairs.

131
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:18,424
Come in Devrath.

132
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,302
Sit.

133
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,439
Tell me.

134
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,802
Armaan Kapoor was shooting at Filmcity
on the night of 4th March...

135
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,709
for producer Deepak Lalwani's film...

136
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:34,576
they were shooting on floor number 4.

137
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,617
They wrapped the shoot at around 2 AM.

138
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:41,478
- Pack up!
Good shot, Armaan.

139
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,280
- Both his driver and spotboy
were with him at that time.

140
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,850
- Did you talk to them?

141
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,622
- Yes, sir.

142
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,892
- They said Armaan took
15 minutes to change.

143
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:54,696
- His staff went about
routinely packing his things.

144
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,793
But, then something unusual happened.

145
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,771
- Armaan sent them both home
from the studio...

146
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,932
- and he drove himself.

147
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:01,997
- Ramu...

148
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,677
you go home, l'll drive myself.

149
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,003
- Come on...

150
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,738
- They also thought it was odd because
Armaan didn't like to drive.

151
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,580
When did he leave from Filmcity?

152
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:13,950
At 2:20 AM.

153
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,620
The accident occurred at 4 AM.

154
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,993
How long does it take to
get to Seaface road from Filmcity?

155
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,821
Probably 30 minutes, at night.

156
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,758
Even if you give it 45 minutes...

157
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,826
where was he for an hour
before the accident?

158
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,939
We don't know that yet, sir.

159
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,733
And Seaface road where
the accident occurred...

160
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,573
is not on his way home.

161
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:41,815
lnspector Shekhawat...

162
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:45,545
- Sir, l'm calling from The Times of lndia
to confirm a story.

163
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,316
- Sources tell us that there's an unidentified
number on Armaan Kapoor's mobile.

164
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:52,621
- ls it true that his last call--

165
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,594
His phone was destroyed by the water,
it's in the workshop.

166
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,790
Who speaks to the press here?

167
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:11,241
Come on guys,
who here knows journalists...

168
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:13,940
you know, to help me leak a story?

169
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:15,845
Sir!

170
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,682
Devrath, confiscate their mobiles.

171
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:21,679
Your phones.

172
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:23,312
Quick!

173
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,020
This is a high profile case.

174
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,720
No talking to the media.

175
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,522
The autopsy and forensics details...

176
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,897
any evidence we get...

177
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,265
none of it is to be made public...

178
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,597
until this case is solved.

179
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:37,763
ls that clear?

180
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,937
l said, no talking to the media...

181
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,478
you can talk to me.

182
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:48,676
Alright, back to work.

183
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:52,980
Sir!

184
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,446
l'm Rakesh Rane.

185
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,285
Yes, Rane?

186
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,918
l don't think this case
will ever be solved...

187
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:01,461
it's an A-final case, sir.

188
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:03,821
l mean...

189
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:08,267
there have been similar accidents
on that road in the past few years.

190
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,237
All freak accidents...

191
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,903
put down as acts of providence...

192
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,407
all unexplained.

193
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:17,410
We didn't get any evidence, whatsoever.

194
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,405
Finally one mystery is cleared...

195
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,849
l know why so many officers
transfer out of this station.

196
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,757
How's it going?

197
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,392
What's up?

198
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:55,042
Madamji.

199
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,850
Shashi bhai, where did you flick...
l mean buy the belt from?

200
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,285
You again!

201
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,517
Where you off to, Nirmala?

202
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,989
My clients want young girls...

203
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,392
not old hags.

204
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,402
The rest of you... let's go.

205
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,901
- Today's clients have
flown in from Goa.

206
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,412
Don't listen to him.

207
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,374
You look really nice...

208
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,479
l know.

209
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,603
What's the matter, Shashi?

210
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,305
You look tense...
something bothering you?

211
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:29,500
- Hey!

212
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,566
- Open up!

213
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:32,970
Shashi...

214
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:38,384
What were you doing?

215
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,277
Nothing... just trying to rile you up.

216
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:42,850
Look at you...

217
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,591
guess l managed to!

218
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,490
- Shashi bhai, it's me... Tehmur.

219
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,665
Here's the new SlM card, Shashi bhai.

220
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,828
Take that in.

221
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,607
You changing your number?

222
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,610
You ask too many questions...

223
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,051
are you a lawyer?!

224
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,819
l'm off to my village for a few days.

225
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,017
That's your answer if anyone asks.

226
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,985
Now get lost!

227
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,865
- Take me with you.

228
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,877
- lt's a work-trip...

229
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,345
- not a vacation.

230
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,375
Once it's done,
l'll rush back to you.

231
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:49,888
But until then...

232
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,755
No one must know anything.

233
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,366
- But what was
Armaan doing on Seaface road?

234
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,735
Suri, stop being secretive...

235
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,931
give us the scoop.

236
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:07,268
lt was an accident.

237
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:08,273
That's it.

238
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:09,768
Pass the water, please.

239
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,706
You actually met Sonya Kapoor?

240
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,375
- ls she as beautiful in real life?

241
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:19,712
- lt is so sad.

242
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,318
He was so young... no?

243
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:24,513
- He shouldn't have died.

244
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,685
Young people die all the time...

245
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,625
but frankly no one--

246
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:38,328
Sorry.

247
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,032
Don't be silly...

248
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:42,468
you don't need to apologise to us.

249
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,345
How's she doing now?

250
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:49,305
She's better.

251
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,045
l've spoken to a psychiatrist...

252
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,377
Anjali Punjabi.

253
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,319
Yes, she is quite good.

254
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,948
Yeah, l think it will help Roshni--

255
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:05,760
Can l get you something?

256
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,024
No, thanks.

257
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,553
Go back.

258
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,692
Stop.

259
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,338
The car was in perfect condition.

260
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,577
- The power brakes were working fine.

261
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:28,542
He braked
here and then swerved...

262
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,516
and crashed through those steps
into the sea.

263
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:41,960
Seems like he was trying to
avoid hitting something...

264
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,029
but there was
nothing on the road.

265
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:46,932
He wasn't drunk either.

266
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:48,432
Yes, sir.

267
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,834
The reports don't show
any traces of alcohol or narcotics.

268
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,465
His lungs were filled with water.

269
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,767
- Cause of death is drowning.

270
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:54,773
- Sir...

271
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,967
it seems like one of those
A-final cases...

272
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:58,776
- none of it makes any sense.

273
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:12,456
Come on.

274
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,023
- Thousands have gathered on the streets
to pay their last respects...

275
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,265
- to beloved Bollywood actor
Armaan Kapoor...

276
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:32,036
- Yes?
- Hello.

277
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:33,040
l'm Frenny Mistry...

278
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:34,678
l live in the neighbourhood...

279
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,012
thought l'd welcome you.

280
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:38,751
There was no need for this...

281
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:41,852
Darling, everybody needs cheese cake!

282
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:43,715
You need any help?

283
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,519
Oh no...

284
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:45,959
l'm fine...

285
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,051
just some boxes left to unpack.

286
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:50,626
Call me if you need anything...

287
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,722
l have a number for everything.

288
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,463
Carpenter, electrician, plumber,
anything you need...

289
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:57,629
l know them all!

290
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,902
Thank you.

291
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,777
l would love some tea.

292
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:06,872
Of course, please sit.

293
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:16,583
So, you're alone at home all day...

294
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,989
while your husband is out
chasing robbers?

295
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:25,859
How long have you been married?

296
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:26,991
12 years.

297
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,753
- Milk and sugar?

298
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:22,685
Yes, dear...

299
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,389
- two spoons.

300
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,988
Hello, Karan.

301
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,036
Hello, lnspector.

302
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:45,801
Hello.

303
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,440
This is Sanjay...

304
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:48,981
Armaan's best friend.

305
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,311
Hello.

306
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:52,375
- Please have a seat.

307
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,441
Thank you.

308
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,755
Sonyaji, we still don't know where
your husband was heading that night...

309
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,494
or why he was on that road.

310
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,329
And the accident?

311
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:09,399
lt's still a mystery why
he steered the car off the road...

312
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,360
and crashed into the sea.

313
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:15,866
Sonyaji...

314
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,504
may l ask you something?

315
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,435
Sure.

316
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,507
Was something bothering Mr. Kapoor?

317
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,481
l mean, was he depressed or disturbed?

318
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:33,422
Armaan did not kill himself, lnspector.

319
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:35,693
- Why would he kill himself?

320
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:39,399
Because you can't figure out
what really happened?

321
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,280
Just this morning
my accountant told me...

322
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:58,042
he had given Armaan 2 million rupees
in cash that day.

323
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:02,384
Why?

324
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,390
We don't know.

325
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,817
- l gave him the money...

326
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,691
at around 7:30 in the evening.

327
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,391
- Why didn't you inform Sonyaji
about this before?

328
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,628
Sir, l did try...

329
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:18,432
but she was in a state of shock,
so l couldn't speak to her.

330
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,534
- Was the money in 500 rupee bills?

331
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,734
No, sir, 1000 rupee bills.

332
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,338
The money was
in a green Puma bag.

333
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,246
But we didn't get
any such bag in the car.

334
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:33,385
- Didn't you pack
Armaan's stuff that night?

335
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:36,789
What all was there?

336
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:39,019
His gym bag...

337
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,487
music system, lunch box...

338
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,489
and...

339
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:46,498
a bag that the accountant gave him.

340
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,692
A red bag?

341
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:49,730
No, sir, a green one.

342
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:51,998
What was in it?
Did you open it?

343
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,730
No, sir, l never open his bags
unless he asked me to.

344
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:56,839
Sure?

345
00:28:58,311 --> 00:28:58,936
Yes, sir.

346
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:02,209
Did Mr. Kapoor tell you
who the bag was for?

347
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,476
No.

348
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:04,775
Has this ever happened before?

349
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:08,711
Twice.

350
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:10,956
And once...

351
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,449
about a year ago,
on Mr. Kapoor's instructions...

352
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,428
l personally dropped off
1 million rupees at Hotel Lido.

353
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:20,523
lt's quite close to where...
the accident took place.

354
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,567
Why?

355
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,365
l don't know, sir.
l was instructed to...

356
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:27,399
give the bag to the receptionist.

357
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,473
- Hello, sir.
What's the problem?

358
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:34,335
Anand Murugan used to work here,
l want to know his whereabouts.

359
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:36,912
Murugan?

360
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,417
He was a receptionist here
for 4 years.

361
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,320
Of course!

362
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:46,656
He quit and...
we haven't heard from him.

363
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:47,825
- ls it extortion?

364
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,928
- Sir, blackmail seems more likely.

365
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,931
lf it were extortion he would've told
someone about it...

366
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,594
but, neither his wife nor his friends
know anything.

367
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,695
ls the blackmail
connected to his death?

368
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,599
l don't think so...

369
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,404
but there are a lot of
unanswered questions.

370
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,506
Today Armaan's wife has filed an FlR.

371
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:09,005
That's all we need right now.

372
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,013
Do we use the entire police force
to solve this hero's case?

373
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:16,912
Sir, l think once we get to Murugan
we'll have a lot more answers.

374
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,753
- Then find him quickly.
- Sir.

375
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,292
- Sir...

376
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,858
Shashi here.

377
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:26,921
- Where the hell have you been?

378
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,661
- l have been trying desperately
to call you.

379
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,566
l had to change my number...

380
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:32,870
need to lie low.

381
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,600
- What happened with Armaan that
night?

382
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:35,800
How should l know?

383
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,036
l wasn't there.

384
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,470
- Don't bullshit me.

385
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,513
- The police know about the 2 million!

386
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,740
You handle them...

387
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:43,339
now back to business...

388
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,380
l was promised 5 million...

389
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:47,451
you owe me 3 more.

390
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:28,358
Why are kids made to dance
to film songs?

391
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,690
ls there nothing better to do?

392
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,356
The kids were good.

393
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:33,894
- Roshni...

394
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,798
- Roshni!

395
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:37,629
- Roshni!

396
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,498
Who is this lunatic?

397
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:41,740
- Hello dear.
- Hello.

398
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,873
This is my husband, Suri.

399
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:44,638
Hello...

400
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,645
This is Frenny, our neighbour.

401
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:49,580
She lives with her brother,
lnspector Billimoria.

402
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,048
l've met your brother.

403
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:52,442
Poor you, dear.

404
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:56,512
Are you heading home?

405
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,557
Yes.

406
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,486
How are you, Surjan?

407
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:08,324
l'm fine, why?

408
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:09,732
Nothing... well...

409
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:13,336
Actually, l wanted to meet you.

410
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:15,531
For a while now.

411
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:17,401
Well...

412
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,704
l have a message for you.

413
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,544
Message? From whom?

414
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,050
From your son...

415
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,378
Karan.

416
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:32,484
He wants me to tell you that...

417
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,457
ls this a joke?

418
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,323
No, please hear me out...

419
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:38,296
Karan wants me to tell you that
he wants to talk to you.

420
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:39,332
Shut up!

421
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:40,593
Just shut up!

422
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,491
We don't want to hear anything.

423
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,298
Stay away from us.
Get it?

424
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:45,864
l mean it!

425
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:51,544
Let's go.

426
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,707
Karan said...

427
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,646
'Tell Dada l am fine'.

428
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,014
'Not to worry.'

429
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,312
'Tell Dada l want to
talk to him.'

430
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,397
How does she know
Karan called you Dada?

431
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,832
Didn't you say...

432
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,499
she barged in and
asked personal questions.

433
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,503
But...

434
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,970
l didn't mention anything
about Karan to her.

435
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:29,482
l can't believe the things
people do for money.

436
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,483
But what if it's true?

437
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:35,417
What?

438
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,358
What if...

439
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:42,418
she really did talk to Karan?

440
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,887
Karan is dead, Roshni.

441
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,663
He can't talk to anyone.

442
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:52,562
Some people can talk to spirits...
l have read such things happen...

443
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,664
Don't believe in such stuff, Roshni.

444
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,333
That's nonsense.

445
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:58,977
Please don't do this
to yourself and me.

446
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:02,606
Suri, all l am saying is...
can we hear her only once--

447
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:05,583
l'm sorry,
l can't have this conversation.

448
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,381
lt's too ridiculous,
l'm leaving.

449
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:08,978
Suri, please... only once--

450
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:11,014
Suri!

451
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:54,856
Dada...

452
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:01,938
Mom, can we go for a walk?

453
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:06,904
Okay.

454
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:12,480
- Karan, don't wander too far off.

455
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:13,875
- Okay.

456
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,946
- Karan!

457
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:49,320
- Karan!

458
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,523
Karan!

459
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,032
- Suri, find him.

460
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,715
Karan!

461
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,267
- Karan!

462
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,842
Looks like you need some love.

463
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:27,384
l can take your pain away.

464
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,518
Save it for someone else...

465
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:32,619
l'm a cop.

466
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:36,725
l've always had shitty luck...

467
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:40,526
l'm only getting started for the night
and you call it a day!

468
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,768
But, it's okay, officer...

469
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:45,770
take me with you.

470
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,773
Arrest me!

471
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,364
How will that help?

472
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:51,471
When you're already in hell.

473
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,378
Perhaps...

474
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,647
but l know the way to heaven.

475
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,283
- Right down this road...
Hotel Lido.

476
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:04,256
There's heaven in every room.

477
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,587
Hotel Lido, that place nearby?

478
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:10,925
The receptionist is a friend...

479
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,864
he won't charge a thing.

480
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:18,267
Get in.

481
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,642
You men are all the same.

482
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,881
How long have you been
working in Lido?

483
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:31,543
Seven years.

484
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:33,951
Do you know Murugan?

485
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,319
Anand Murugan?

486
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,857
He was a receptionist there.

487
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,822
Why?

488
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,428
l'm looking for him.

489
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,395
But...

490
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,662
no one seems to know where he is.

491
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:51,326
Everyone know he is dying in Melur...

492
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:55,338
AlDS is bad for business.

493
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,708
So, the manager sent him away.

494
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:07,942
Thank you.

495
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,650
That's it?

496
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:13,255
That's it.

497
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,220
Don't shoo me off...

498
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:17,952
l can really help you.

499
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,766
l'll find you when l need you...

500
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:24,326
now go.

501
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:46,420
Missing me already?

502
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,725
What's your name?

503
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,766
Rosie.

504
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:56,926
Good night, Rosie.

505
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:17,950
Where can l find Anand Murugan?

506
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:18,888
That way.

507
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:25,829
Anand Murugan?

508
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,358
Sir, Devrath here.

509
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,530
- You were right,
Murugan has AlDS.

510
00:40:33,906 --> 00:40:36,534
- About a year ago he got a bag
from Armaan Kapoor's accountant.

511
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:37,701
- For a guy called Shashi.

512
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,874
Now who's Shashi?

513
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,513
He's a pimp.
He works out of Hotel Lido.

514
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,941
Shashi gave Murugan
Rs. 2000 for the bag.

515
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:48,017
l hope Murugan isn't lying.

516
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,385
l don't think so.

517
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:50,945
He is dying,
why would he lie?

518
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:52,854
- Where is Shashi?

519
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,894
- He told me he was going to Sangli
for some work.

520
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:57,560
What work?

521
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,561
That he didn't tell me.

522
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,565
When is he expected?

523
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,025
l don't know.

524
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:07,605
Listen to me...

525
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:10,472
Shashi is in trouble.

526
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,335
lf you want to help him,
tell me where he is.

527
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:17,972
Sir, l really don't know.

528
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:22,683
Did Shashi ever mention
anything about Armaan Kapoor?

529
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,356
- Where is Shashi?

530
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:35,923
- l don't know.

531
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:37,333
- Haven't seen him around.

532
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,969
l heard he went back to his village.

533
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,438
Where is that?

534
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:45,342
You know, a place that has
cows and bullock carts.

535
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,002
A village.

536
00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:51,413
You're quite a good comedienne.

537
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:53,349
But, unfortunately for you...

538
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,683
it's not easy to make me laugh.

539
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,359
You have two options.

540
00:42:02,295 --> 00:42:04,855
Either you give us Shashi's address...

541
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:07,523
or we can take a drive to the station.

542
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,297
Hold on.

543
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:14,272
You can't just arrest me.

544
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:20,536
Devrath, she really is funny...

545
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:24,540
she's made me smile too.

546
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:35,592
Christina, get me my diary.

547
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:52,807
- Sir, Shashi didn't come here
to Sangli.

548
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,780
Just as l thought.

549
00:42:56,582 --> 00:42:58,015
You can come back.

550
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:00,416
Tell the cops there
to keep an eye on his family.

551
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:02,850
We have to find this guy
no matter what!

552
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,891
l need these pills.

553
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,321
Karan liked to play in water.

554
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:14,924
Ever since he was little.

555
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,562
When l'd get the water
ready for his bath...

556
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,502
he'd be so happy.

557
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,674
He would fill his mouth
and spout water on me.

558
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:29,681
He wouldn't stop laughing!

559
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,723
Karan loved to be in water...

560
00:43:43,796 --> 00:43:46,731
did he have to drown and die?

561
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:54,930
Losing a child is a very
traumatic experience.

562
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,842
l empathise with you...

563
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,878
but life does take unexpected turns.

564
00:44:00,546 --> 00:44:04,414
Sometimes we end up
losing people that we love.

565
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,308
But we have to carry on.

566
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:09,849
Be patient, Roshni.

567
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:14,348
l can assure you that with the help of
these sessions and medication...

568
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:15,860
you will get out of this.

569
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:19,326
And you have your husband
for support as well...

570
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,493
Along with Karan...

571
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:24,934
l also lost Suri.

572
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:30,407
The fact is Suri needs your help
more than l do.

573
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,810
l don't know what he thinks...

574
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,470
or what he feels.

575
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:36,606
He doesn't talk to me.

576
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,508
You know...

577
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,552
he never talks about Karan.

578
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:43,049
Never.

579
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:49,724
Do you feel Suri doesn't care?

580
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,031
No, he does care.

581
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,631
lf he didn't...

582
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,431
he'd be able to sleep.

583
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:25,625
My sadness is met with
a silence from you

584
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:31,803
Time is to blame and that is the truth

585
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:35,601
Beat after beat a sorrow
continues to stay

586
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:42,973
Then why does the heart
still seem to say

587
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:48,487
Live a little

588
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:55,517
The heart says live a little

589
00:45:56,028 --> 00:46:00,897
My fellow traveller, my soul mate

590
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:06,497
Come a little closer and live a little

591
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:21,649
Yes this life has been full of pain

592
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:27,851
But there is a solace too
that it contains

593
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:33,627
l am yours and you are mine

594
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,432
And we hope that
this won't ever change

595
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:46,867
Then why has the road that
leads me to you broken down

596
00:46:46,946 --> 00:46:52,851
Why are we meeting life
with a frown

597
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:58,015
Come let's open the doors,
let it all go

598
00:46:58,324 --> 00:47:03,887
Let's cry our hearts out,
let the tears flow

599
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:08,730
Live a little

600
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:15,464
The heart says live a little

601
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:21,743
My fellow traveller, my soul mate

602
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:28,012
Come a little closer and live a little

603
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:44,492
Let the pain clouds drift away

604
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,974
Allow life to blossom
a little each day

605
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:55,344
Leave the past where it belongs

606
00:47:55,414 --> 00:48:01,011
And listen to what
the heart has to say

607
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:06,953
Live a little

608
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:13,961
The heart says live a little

609
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:19,403
My fellow traveller, my soul mate

610
00:48:19,972 --> 00:48:24,671
Come a little closer and live a little

611
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:34,914
- Sir, the guy in the yellow t-shirt
is Tehmur, Shashi's confidant.

612
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:36,545
- He's walking towards you.

613
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,452
Alright.

614
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:46,562
Tehmur!

615
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:48,366
Me... sir?

616
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,297
You are Tehmur, right?

617
00:48:56,609 --> 00:48:57,598
What do you do?

618
00:48:58,711 --> 00:48:59,939
l'm a beggar.

619
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:02,911
l'm very poor...
don't even have enough to eat.

620
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,780
Sir, l haven't done anything...

621
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,488
- Sir, where are you taking me?
- Get him in!

622
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:21,925
- Speak up!

623
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:28,699
He's not talking.

624
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:35,404
Sir, l really don't
know where Shashi is...

625
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:38,644
Sir, l swear l don't know anything.

626
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:40,681
Shut up!

627
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:42,920
Sir is an encounter specialist.

628
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:45,286
A few days ago
he shot dead some goons!

629
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,819
You better talk.

630
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:51,419
Sir, trust me,
l really don't know anything.

631
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:55,426
What will you do
if Shashi calls you?

632
00:49:58,404 --> 00:49:59,496
l'll inform you.

633
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:01,499
What if you don't?

634
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,040
You can chop off my legs!

635
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,736
You can go.

636
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:09,939
Really?

637
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:12,341
Now get lost!

638
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,449
Shashi has never treated you well.

639
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:18,956
He treats you like a dog!

640
00:50:19,425 --> 00:50:23,418
l suggest you come clean
to lnspector Shekhawat.

641
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:25,486
And save yourself.

642
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,330
Pande, you know me well.

643
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,802
l'm not trying to help Shashi...

644
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:35,868
nor am l being a hero.

645
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:38,367
l want to stay away from it all.

646
00:50:38,711 --> 00:50:41,407
Shashi is into something big.

647
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,647
Shashi took 2 million
from Armaan Kapoor.

648
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,715
He can't escape...

649
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:49,845
sooner or later we will get him.

650
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:30,653
We're sorry.

651
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:33,391
The number you've reached
is not in service.

652
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:48,011
Tehmur, give us some water.

653
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,804
- Shashi, You better listen to me.

654
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:20,003
- Stop calling me so many times.

655
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:22,737
- l told you that
you'll get the money tomorrow.

656
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:25,450
- Come to the Mahim carnival
at 8 pm tomorrow.

657
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,781
- lf you want the money,
don't call again.

658
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,523
Seen Shashi around?

659
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:44,796
No, sir...

660
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:26,540
l knew you would be back.

661
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:27,601
Why?

662
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:32,442
Everyone gives in to my charm...

663
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:34,008
how would you escape?

664
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:39,614
You were right about Murugan.

665
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:41,382
Why would l lie?

666
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,426
People here don't really help the cops.

667
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:48,298
Because cops don't really
help the people here.

668
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,429
Cops treat everyone alike.

669
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:52,832
You're really funny, you know that?

670
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,574
Where are you going?

671
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:01,512
Where do you think?

672
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,578
That's not why l'm here.

673
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,408
Then, why are you here?

674
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,248
Don't lie to me.

675
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,987
l can sense you are lonely.

676
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:18,795
No fun with the wife anymore.

677
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:21,723
Am l right?

678
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:26,294
l am not here to play games.

679
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,571
Do you know Shashi?

680
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:30,606
Shashi?

681
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,470
What's there to know?

682
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,438
He is a jerk.

683
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,272
Do you work for him?

684
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,975
l am one of his top girls.

685
00:54:45,424 --> 00:54:46,356
Where is he right now?

686
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:48,523
l don't know.

687
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:51,055
l'm looking for him...

688
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:53,693
will you help me?

689
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:57,899
Get your team to fill in for me...

690
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,732
and l'll step in for them...

691
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,966
as a cop.

692
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,548
lf you want,
l can figure something out for you...

693
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,948
Really?

694
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,383
What can you do for me?

695
00:55:31,003 --> 00:55:33,335
l suggest you keep
your beautiful eyes open...

696
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:36,498
l don't know where Shashi is...

697
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:39,908
he's probably in a drunken haze
drowned in somebody's arms...

698
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:44,639
but how long can he stay submerged...

699
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:49,446
sooner or later
he'll have to surface.

700
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,330
Shashi is playing
a big game this time...

701
00:56:05,437 --> 00:56:06,495
it involves millions.

702
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,338
So, tell the cops...

703
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,432
to arrest him and
chop his balls off!

704
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:15,746
No, it's time for my payback...

705
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,447
l've done enough dirty
work for him.

706
00:56:21,653 --> 00:56:23,848
Shashi won't do anything for you.

707
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,856
He better.

708
00:56:27,392 --> 00:56:28,859
He owes me.

709
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:35,867
l want to ask you something.

710
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,840
l need you to be sober
when l say this...

711
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:47,378
l need to be drunk to do my job.

712
00:56:48,747 --> 00:56:49,714
Ask me...

713
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:51,974
Nirmala...

714
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:02,723
lf l hit the big time...

715
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,261
and make lots of money...

716
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:08,328
will you marry me?

717
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,707
Did the cops hit you
on your head?

718
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:20,934
Come on, answer me...

719
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:22,811
will you come with me?

720
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,749
Stop building these castles in the air.

721
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,852
l'm a whore and l'll always be one...

722
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,014
and you'll always be
a whore's lame son!

723
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,758
Stay away from Shashi's rackets
if you want to stay alive...

724
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,761
Mom, can we go for a walk?

725
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:21,571
Okay.

726
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,305
Karan...

727
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,366
wait... don't go...

728
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:27,541
Dada...

729
00:58:27,612 --> 00:58:28,408
Let's play checkers instead.

730
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,504
Alright!

731
00:58:30,248 --> 00:58:31,237
Who wants red?

732
00:58:31,316 --> 00:58:32,248
- l...
- l!

733
00:58:36,688 --> 00:58:38,383
- Mom, can we go for a walk?

734
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:39,013
- Okay.

735
00:58:39,925 --> 00:58:40,789
Karan...

736
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:41,689
wait...

737
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:43,416
l'll come with you.

738
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:54,602
- Mom, can we go for a walk?

739
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,596
l'm Karan Shekhawat...

740
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:00,531
l need your help.

741
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:03,799
Can you call my mom and dad?

742
01:00:03,942 --> 01:00:06,035
l want to talk to them...

743
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,905
their names are Roshni and Surjan.

744
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,939
Please tell them,
l want to talk to them.

745
01:00:13,018 --> 01:00:14,781
l'm Karan Shekhawat...

746
01:00:14,853 --> 01:00:17,447
l want to talk to my mom and dad...

747
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,907
Concentrate, my dear.

748
01:00:48,453 --> 01:00:50,387
l am here to speak to Karan...

749
01:00:52,624 --> 01:00:54,922
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?

750
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:01,422
l am here to speak to Karan...

751
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:05,334
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?

752
01:01:06,972 --> 01:01:08,872
l am here to speak to Karan...

753
01:01:10,475 --> 01:01:12,602
Can the spirits help me reach Karan?

754
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:44,074
Hello mom...

755
01:01:44,342 --> 01:01:47,607
l'm right here with you...

756
01:01:47,979 --> 01:01:51,710
l'm happy that
l'm speaking with you.

757
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:54,541
Thank you, mom.

758
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:58,988
Please tell dad that...

759
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,923
l really want to talk to him...

760
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:07,264
l know you and dad are sad
because of me.

761
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:10,393
l am always with you...

762
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:15,268
Please don't cry, mom.

763
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:20,736
l want to see you smiling
like this always.

764
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:38,928
l can sense you are lonely...

765
01:02:38,997 --> 01:02:42,489
no fun with the wife
anymore.

766
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:43,397
Am l right?

767
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:52,642
l knew you would be back...

768
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,974
everyone gives in to my charm...

769
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:56,911
how would you escape?

770
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,608
l am not here to play
games.

771
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:01,017
Then, why are you here?

772
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:02,718
Do you know Shashi?

773
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:07,619
l suggest you keep
your beautiful eyes open...

774
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,524
l don't know where Shashi is...

775
01:03:09,594 --> 01:03:12,654
he's probably in a drunken haze
drowned in somebody's arms...

776
01:03:12,897 --> 01:03:13,659
- What is it?

777
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:17,428
Some creep tied stones to a girl's body
and threw it in the sea.

778
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,868
But how long can he stay submerged...

779
01:03:19,938 --> 01:03:21,906
- The body did not
surface for four days.

780
01:03:22,974 --> 01:03:25,442
Sooner or later
he'll have to surface.

781
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:29,004
Have you sent it for post-mortem?

782
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,373
No, sir, we're trying to
get identification.

783
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:33,579
- What did you just say?
- Sir!

784
01:03:33,785 --> 01:03:36,447
A girl's body has
surfaced in Mahim Creek...

785
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:40,422
the killer tied stones to her body
before drowning her.

786
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:42,622
She was killed four days ago.

787
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:44,554
Devrath!

788
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,324
Send Shashi's photo and description
to all morgues and hospitals...

789
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:49,696
immediately!

790
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:56,930
- Last evening at approximately 8:30...

791
01:03:57,008 --> 01:03:58,566
- a clean shot through the head...

792
01:03:58,643 --> 01:04:01,874
- the killer was at a distance
of almost 300 metres.

793
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:07,384
- The shell casing and gunshot wound
prove that a .315 calibre rifle was used.

794
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,514
- Definitely a professional hit.

795
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:15,457
- We got these keys from his pocket,
of a room at the Golden Eyes hotel.

796
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:17,518
We recovered these things
from his room...

797
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:19,722
he had checked in as Krishna Nair.

798
01:04:20,832 --> 01:04:24,427
He didn't have anything
apart from his clothes...

799
01:04:24,502 --> 01:04:25,867
nothing to identify him.

800
01:04:30,642 --> 01:04:31,700
Why is this so heavy?

801
01:04:39,684 --> 01:04:41,777
When your time comes...

802
01:04:42,687 --> 01:04:45,713
there's nothing you can do about it.

803
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:49,716
What's with the long faces, guys?

804
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:52,390
Shashi bhai is dead.

805
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:54,287
What?!

806
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,298
What rubbish?

807
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,299
lt's true, he is dead.

808
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:02,302
Someone shot him
last evening at the Mahim carnival.

809
01:05:02,974 --> 01:05:07,502
But what was Shashi
doing at the carnival anyway?

810
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,857
Shashi, you better listen to me...

811
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,866
stop calling me over and over again.

812
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,033
l told you that
you'll get the money tomorrow.

813
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:36,333
Come to the Mahim carnival
at 8 pm tomorrow.

814
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:37,701
You ask too many questions...

815
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:39,470
are you a lawyer?!

816
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:42,412
So, you really met him last night?

817
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,311
l thought you were bluffing.

818
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,718
Shashi is into something big...

819
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:51,846
he took 2 million
from Armaan Kapoor.

820
01:05:51,923 --> 01:05:53,584
Did Shashi have a green bag?

821
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:55,548
Did he?

822
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:17,711
l don't want to go back to that life...

823
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:21,518
Sorry, Mallika.
Madam is calling you.

824
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:28,288
Shashi paid her for me...

825
01:06:28,926 --> 01:06:29,984
Move it.

826
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:33,356
- Shashi paid her for my freedom...

827
01:06:33,898 --> 01:06:37,595
- tell them Shashi paid her
for my freedom...

828
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:39,268
- Tehmur!

829
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:08,826
Armaan Kapoor?

830
01:07:18,443 --> 01:07:19,239
Shashi bhai...

831
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:21,338
Come in, doctor...

832
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:23,403
the bleeding hasn't stopped.

833
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:26,708
- Shashi, she needs
to be taken to a hospital...

834
01:07:26,784 --> 01:07:28,547
- No, no hospital...
fix her up here...

835
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,482
lf you ever say a word about this...

836
01:07:34,525 --> 01:07:35,856
l will break your face.

837
01:07:35,893 --> 01:07:36,621
Get it?

838
01:07:37,562 --> 01:07:40,998
Shashi bhai, thanks for the payback.

839
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:46,694
We had to report to the income-tax department
because the 2 million was in cash.

840
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,763
You'll have to apply for a refund.

841
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:54,338
How did Armaan know...
that guy Shashi?

842
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,607
l'm afraid l still don't know.

843
01:07:58,383 --> 01:07:59,907
Why was he blackmailing Armaan?

844
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:02,919
Sonya, he said he doesn't know.

845
01:08:04,322 --> 01:08:06,756
You think it's possible that...

846
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:10,385
Armaan was using prostitutes?

847
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:12,724
Sonya, please...

848
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,526
l want to know the truth.

849
01:08:18,903 --> 01:08:21,269
l'm not really sure...

850
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:24,866
but, yes it's possible.

851
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:36,976
Hello?

852
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,952
l'm Shashi's friend.

853
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,021
Excuse me.

854
01:08:49,434 --> 01:08:50,025
Who is this?

855
01:08:50,268 --> 01:08:51,257
- l just told you!

856
01:08:51,536 --> 01:08:52,662
Remember Shashi?

857
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:55,329
You called him to the carnival...

858
01:08:55,373 --> 01:08:56,567
and you killed him.

859
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,809
l'm in a meeting right now...

860
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,472
let me call you back
in some time.

861
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:06,540
Please, don't bother...

862
01:09:06,617 --> 01:09:08,847
l'll call you back in an hour...

863
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,684
you better answer
or you will regret it.

864
01:09:17,395 --> 01:09:18,362
Okay.

865
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,732
He's taken the bait!

866
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:28,702
Jackpot!

867
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,468
Who would have thought
you were so smart, Tehmur?

868
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:02,494
Tell me...

869
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:04,390
l want five million.

870
01:10:04,698 --> 01:10:05,665
What?

871
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,267
What for?

872
01:10:07,568 --> 01:10:09,627
To keep your secret safe.

873
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:11,597
What are you talking about?

874
01:10:12,406 --> 01:10:14,738
Listen to me,
don't waste my time.

875
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:17,003
Okay then,
you'll hear from the cops...

876
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:20,513
once they get Shashi's phone SlM
and the DVD.

877
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:22,541
- lf that's not good enough...

878
01:10:23,617 --> 01:10:25,278
l know about the girl too.

879
01:10:32,893 --> 01:10:34,485
l'm in trouble, dad.

880
01:10:36,697 --> 01:10:38,892
lt's a real mess.

881
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:40,725
What is it?

882
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:45,531
Armaan and l...

883
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:50,505
some people have been
blackmailing us.

884
01:10:51,245 --> 01:10:51,939
What?

885
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,642
Who are these people?

886
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,547
Do you remember Nikhil's accident?

887
01:10:58,619 --> 01:10:59,517
Of course.

888
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:04,290
He didn't fall from the balcony
of our Juhu bungalow...

889
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:07,455
l lied to you.

890
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,831
Actually, he fell off a moving car...

891
01:11:14,335 --> 01:11:15,996
it was an accident, dad.

892
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:31,678
How come you're home so early!

893
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:34,649
Are you complaining?

894
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:36,346
Suri!

895
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,418
Do you have to go back?

896
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:43,687
No.

897
01:11:43,764 --> 01:11:45,288
Then let's go out.

898
01:11:45,766 --> 01:11:46,357
Where?

899
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,492
Let's go for a movie...

900
01:11:47,568 --> 01:11:49,502
and then we'll eat out...

901
01:11:49,903 --> 01:11:51,734
Please, Suri... come on...

902
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:53,371
Please!

903
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:23,935
l couldn't stop laughing!

904
01:12:24,705 --> 01:12:26,434
How did you like the film?

905
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,008
l was watching you, actually...

906
01:12:30,277 --> 01:12:31,835
it's good to see you happy.

907
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:35,772
Thank you, Roshni...

908
01:12:37,618 --> 01:12:40,246
For seeing the therapist...

909
01:12:41,822 --> 01:12:44,222
l know it can't be easy for you...

910
01:12:44,525 --> 01:12:46,516
but l think it's really helping you.

911
01:12:48,495 --> 01:12:50,292
- Hi Roshni aunty...

912
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:52,889
- Samar!

913
01:12:58,872 --> 01:13:00,362
What brings you to Mumbai?

914
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:02,375
My cousin is getting married
next week...

915
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:03,808
l was going to call you...

916
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:07,312
Samar's been looking forward
to seeing you.

917
01:13:14,321 --> 01:13:16,846
lf you're free one evening,
come over...

918
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:17,879
have dinner with us.

919
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,220
Sure, why not!

920
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:20,419
How about Friday?

921
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:22,458
l'm working late on Friday.

922
01:13:24,498 --> 01:13:25,658
What about Saturday?

923
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:27,728
Actually, l'm busy all week...

924
01:13:28,602 --> 01:13:31,435
l'm working on a new case,
sorry, l'm really pressed for time.

925
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:35,399
No problem...

926
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:37,740
you cops do work long hours.

927
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,347
l can't believe you did that!

928
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:54,524
They must have felt so bad...

929
01:13:55,662 --> 01:13:57,323
they are our friends, Suri.

930
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:00,591
That doesn't mean
l have to meet them...

931
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:03,660
l'm not stopping you
from meeting them.

932
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,270
Every time l look at Samar...

933
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,398
He is only a child, Suri...

934
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:11,836
what happened wasn't his fault.

935
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:13,437
l know...

936
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:15,509
the fault was mine.

937
01:14:18,418 --> 01:14:20,249
lt was an accident, Suri.

938
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,385
No, it was negligence...

939
01:14:23,257 --> 01:14:24,383
on my part.

940
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:26,984
lnstead of keeping an eye on them,
l fell asleep.

941
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:29,986
So did l...

942
01:14:30,464 --> 01:14:33,490
we didn't know the kids would do
something like that.

943
01:14:34,468 --> 01:14:36,663
Please, Suri.
Don't blame yourself.

944
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:41,307
You can say
what you want now, Roshni...

945
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:45,612
but l know how you look
at me sometimes...

946
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:47,643
But...

947
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:49,443
l've never blamed you...

948
01:14:49,716 --> 01:14:51,911
l've never thought like this...

949
01:14:53,186 --> 01:14:54,653
But l do... every single day.

950
01:14:55,689 --> 01:14:56,849
Don't...

951
01:14:57,758 --> 01:14:59,350
you mustn't blame yourself...

952
01:14:59,426 --> 01:15:00,358
come on...

953
01:15:00,427 --> 01:15:01,485
let's go in and talk.

954
01:15:01,562 --> 01:15:02,824
No, l've got some work.

955
01:15:04,598 --> 01:15:05,690
Please, Suri.

956
01:15:08,435 --> 01:15:09,493
Suri...

957
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:17,902
This illness you have of the heart

958
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:29,718
l don't seem to understand at all

959
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:38,464
You abandon everything
that's near and dear

960
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:47,937
And what remains distant
you seem to call

961
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:55,872
My heart is listless!
Without you.

962
01:15:55,949 --> 01:16:01,581
My heart is listless!
Without you.

963
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:17,963
l don't know why

964
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:20,798
And l don't know how

965
01:16:20,874 --> 01:16:25,504
There exists an invisible tension

966
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:29,241
One that tugs

967
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:32,318
One that leads

968
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:37,551
One that tugs
One that leads

969
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:42,254
Me in your direction

970
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:46,265
l am the mystery

971
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,858
l am that story

972
01:16:48,935 --> 01:16:52,871
That doesn't have an end

973
01:16:54,675 --> 01:17:00,307
Come closer and you shall see

974
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:05,943
Come closer and you shall see

975
01:17:06,219 --> 01:17:09,416
The distance remains
and is meant to be

976
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:14,961
My heart is listless!
Without you.

977
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:20,723
My heart is listless!
Without you.

978
01:17:56,903 --> 01:18:02,569
What l haven't been able to unravel

979
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:06,578
ls the riddle that you are

980
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:13,776
No one knows the secret

981
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:19,315
No one knows the secret

982
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:23,920
The secret who's friend you are

983
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:30,568
l smile, and hide from the world

984
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:35,336
How restless l am day and night

985
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:41,905
lt's been a while
since l shut my eyes

986
01:18:42,182 --> 01:18:47,210
lt's been a while
since l shut my eyes

987
01:18:47,587 --> 01:18:50,920
Been a while
since l felt peace inside

988
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:56,686
My heart is listless!
Without you.

989
01:18:56,763 --> 01:19:02,360
My heart is listless!
Without you.

990
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:24,323
Don't you ever go home?

991
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:30,323
And when do you sleep?

992
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:31,560
Hmm?

993
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:33,693
l need to ask you something...

994
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,598
l'll come back later if you are busy.

995
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:53,349
Look at them staring at us...

996
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,412
They probably think...

997
01:19:56,489 --> 01:19:58,616
l'm picking you up.

998
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:00,587
How does it matter?

999
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:03,386
Let me take you to a place...

1000
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:06,423
where no one will bother us.

1001
01:20:33,526 --> 01:20:34,720
What is this place?

1002
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:37,594
lt's my secret spot...

1003
01:20:38,932 --> 01:20:40,593
hardly anyone ever comes here.

1004
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:43,963
lf you can't find me anywhere else...

1005
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:45,898
you'll probably find me here...

1006
01:20:58,785 --> 01:21:00,446
lsn't it peaceful here?

1007
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:13,927
Why are you so sad?

1008
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:16,901
What makes you say that?

1009
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:21,001
Fine, you don't have to talk about it.

1010
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:24,371
Let's talk about something else...

1011
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:26,774
how's the investigation going?

1012
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:30,449
l heard Shashi was killed.

1013
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:38,849
l don't know what l am
looking for.

1014
01:21:40,493 --> 01:21:43,428
Every clue seems to lead to a blank...

1015
01:21:45,932 --> 01:21:48,799
l feel like the answers are
staring me in the face...

1016
01:21:50,904 --> 01:21:52,804
but l can't see them.

1017
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:01,208
Can l ask you something?

1018
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:03,746
Sure.

1019
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:07,882
Did Shashi ever make you meet...

1020
01:22:07,954 --> 01:22:09,285
anyone famous?

1021
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:11,681
Meet anyone famous?

1022
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:14,521
You want to know
if l slept with Armaan Kapoor?

1023
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:20,265
Then ask me straight...

1024
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:22,967
l won't be offended...

1025
01:22:23,603 --> 01:22:24,900
it's my job.

1026
01:22:27,374 --> 01:22:29,740
The answer is no...

1027
01:22:29,809 --> 01:22:31,868
but his friend was a regular client.

1028
01:22:34,414 --> 01:22:36,405
And l met Armaan once with him.

1029
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:40,819
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1030
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:43,187
You never asked me.

1031
01:22:43,623 --> 01:22:44,783
When was this?

1032
01:22:45,558 --> 01:22:47,253
Three years ago...

1033
01:22:47,794 --> 01:22:50,194
Armaan wasn't as famous back then...

1034
01:22:51,431 --> 01:22:54,889
He came with Nikhil, his friend.

1035
01:22:56,302 --> 01:22:58,202
There was another guy with them.

1036
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:01,406
We went for a drive...

1037
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:05,571
That's all.

1038
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:08,540
This other guy...

1039
01:23:09,516 --> 01:23:11,984
was his name Sanjay Kejriwal?

1040
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:15,413
l don't know his name...

1041
01:23:16,423 --> 01:23:18,357
but l'd recognise him
if l saw him.

1042
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,577
What are you doing here, Rosie?

1043
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:49,418
You don't belong here.

1044
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:53,819
l've been waiting for you...

1045
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:58,520
to come along and rescue me.

1046
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:03,565
lf you want to get out...

1047
01:24:04,437 --> 01:24:06,234
l can help you.

1048
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:07,732
l know.

1049
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:10,533
But not yet...

1050
01:24:11,644 --> 01:24:13,771
there are some things l need to
take care of...

1051
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:16,838
let me get done with that.

1052
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:21,879
And who knows...

1053
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:26,790
someday l might end up
doing something for you.

1054
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:41,373
l have to say...

1055
01:24:42,775 --> 01:24:44,868
you're really different.

1056
01:24:45,778 --> 01:24:48,838
Trust me,
you don't belong here either.

1057
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,876
How's that?

1058
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:57,548
Well, you actually care about people...

1059
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,883
without wanting anything in return.

1060
01:25:01,394 --> 01:25:03,419
Not too many people
like that around here.

1061
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:07,657
Three years ago a friend of mine...

1062
01:25:08,401 --> 01:25:10,460
went out with some guys...

1063
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:13,904
She never came back.

1064
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:17,432
No one's heard of her since...

1065
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:19,912
no one knows if
she is dead or alive...

1066
01:25:21,347 --> 01:25:22,939
and no one cares.

1067
01:25:24,951 --> 01:25:26,816
l mean, think about it.

1068
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:29,818
A girl just vanishes...

1069
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:33,348
and it makes no difference to anyone.

1070
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:36,219
Did you report it to the cops?

1071
01:25:42,602 --> 01:25:44,331
Are you crazy?

1072
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,936
l think l should remind you
about the laws in our country.

1073
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:52,703
Prostitution is still illegal.

1074
01:25:54,647 --> 01:25:56,842
We don't even exist...

1075
01:25:58,518 --> 01:26:00,383
and if we don't exist...

1076
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,751
how can we go missing?

1077
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:20,766
Hello, l'm lnspector Shekhawat...

1078
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,308
and l'm here to see
Nikhil Deshpande.

1079
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:27,844
He wants to meet Nikhil.

1080
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:33,276
Nikhil...

1081
01:26:33,586 --> 01:26:35,884
look, someone's come to see you.

1082
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:49,729
Doctors are not sure
how much he can understand...

1083
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:52,669
He understands everything, l know it.

1084
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,544
- He hasn't spoken since the accident.

1085
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:12,781
The profits recorded
went up by 8 percent...

1086
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:15,293
and, this trend indicates that...

1087
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:18,728
there is a substantial growth
in this sector.

1088
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:19,628
And, according to--

1089
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,631
Hello?

1090
01:27:21,534 --> 01:27:23,195
hold on for a second...

1091
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:26,635
Guys... l have to take this call so...

1092
01:27:27,573 --> 01:27:28,631
please continue...

1093
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,232
Okay, as l was saying...

1094
01:27:30,777 --> 01:27:31,835
according to this trend...

1095
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:34,237
l want to meet with you.

1096
01:27:34,447 --> 01:27:35,709
You got the money?

1097
01:27:36,382 --> 01:27:37,610
Are you listening to me?

1098
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:38,742
l want to meet--

1099
01:27:38,818 --> 01:27:40,445
You think l'm an idiot?

1100
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:43,152
l know what happened to Shashi.

1101
01:27:43,656 --> 01:27:45,385
l didn't kill Shashi.

1102
01:27:45,758 --> 01:27:47,225
l was at the carnival with the money...

1103
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:48,760
waiting for Shashi.

1104
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:51,194
l've been paying him off for years,
why would l have him killed?

1105
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,600
l can ruin you in a matter of hours...

1106
01:27:56,669 --> 01:27:58,398
What will you get out of it?

1107
01:27:59,906 --> 01:28:01,305
Think about it...

1108
01:28:01,374 --> 01:28:04,207
- lf you're ready to meet,
l will bring the money...

1109
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:06,603
at a place and time of your choice.

1110
01:28:16,255 --> 01:28:17,552
Why are the lights switched off...

1111
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:20,418
Come... Devrath, come in...

1112
01:28:23,429 --> 01:28:24,760
This way, Devrath...

1113
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:25,789
Nice house, sir.

1114
01:28:26,199 --> 01:28:26,790
Roshni...

1115
01:28:31,838 --> 01:28:33,271
Looks like my wife is out...

1116
01:28:33,473 --> 01:28:34,440
Would you like a drink?

1117
01:28:34,674 --> 01:28:35,606
l don't mind...

1118
01:28:36,509 --> 01:28:37,407
Whisky, right?

1119
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:38,238
Yes, sir.

1120
01:28:43,316 --> 01:28:44,248
Soda or water?

1121
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,281
Water, sir...

1122
01:28:46,152 --> 01:28:46,811
And ice?

1123
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,209
Okay.

1124
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:54,417
Sorry, Devrath...

1125
01:28:54,494 --> 01:28:56,724
l think Roshni forgot that
you were coming over for dinner...

1126
01:28:57,497 --> 01:28:59,158
she's out for a film
with a friend.

1127
01:28:59,232 --> 01:28:59,926
lt's okay, sir.

1128
01:29:04,637 --> 01:29:06,332
Hello Suri, how're you doing?

1129
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:10,242
Sorry to disturb your film,
but l need to speak with Roshni...

1130
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:11,901
- l can't get through her phone.

1131
01:29:12,378 --> 01:29:13,345
What film?

1132
01:29:14,547 --> 01:29:16,447
- Roshni's not with me, Suri.

1133
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,742
- ls everything okay?

1134
01:29:18,785 --> 01:29:21,720
Yeah... l'm sorry...
l got it wrong...

1135
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:24,180
it slipped my mind, sorry...

1136
01:30:15,475 --> 01:30:17,875
Devrath, do you know
where Billimoria lives?

1137
01:30:19,011 --> 01:30:20,842
Sir... block-2, ground floor...

1138
01:30:22,281 --> 01:30:22,975
What's wrong, sir?

1139
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,308
Sir...

1140
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:32,947
Where is Roshni?

1141
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:35,357
She's inside...
you have to wait here.

1142
01:30:36,496 --> 01:30:37,758
You can't go in there...

1143
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,229
Sir... you can't...

1144
01:30:43,503 --> 01:30:44,299
Suri...

1145
01:30:46,372 --> 01:30:48,272
l warned you to stay away...

1146
01:30:48,341 --> 01:30:48,898
didn't l?

1147
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:49,606
Suri...

1148
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,301
Suri...

1149
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:52,305
stop it...

1150
01:30:52,378 --> 01:30:53,777
Have you lost it, Roshni?

1151
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,472
What are you doing here?

1152
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:57,982
Karan is dead,
he can't talk to you.

1153
01:30:58,251 --> 01:31:00,276
l don't blame you for your anger,
it comes from the pain within--

1154
01:31:00,386 --> 01:31:01,648
That's enough!

1155
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:05,756
lf you can really talk to Karan,
tell him to appear now...

1156
01:31:05,825 --> 01:31:07,520
l want to see him...
where is he?

1157
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,788
l can't do that.

1158
01:31:09,529 --> 01:31:13,693
Only trapped spirits can
manifest themselves in human form...

1159
01:31:14,267 --> 01:31:17,464
but Karan didn't have a problem
moving to the afterlife...

1160
01:31:17,537 --> 01:31:18,663
he had a smooth passage.

1161
01:31:19,372 --> 01:31:19,997
Unbelievable!

1162
01:31:20,406 --> 01:31:21,600
A smooth passage?

1163
01:31:21,674 --> 01:31:24,006
He was only 8
and he drowned to death!

1164
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:25,972
How smooth is that?

1165
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:29,547
There are many things in this world
that can't be explained.

1166
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:32,417
l didn't choose this life...

1167
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:34,350
it chose me.

1168
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:37,413
- Let's go...
- No, Surjan...

1169
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,787
listen to me...

1170
01:31:38,858 --> 01:31:41,725
deal with your pain,
or you will attract more of it.

1171
01:31:41,861 --> 01:31:44,386
When my husband died,
l was very depressed...

1172
01:31:44,797 --> 01:31:48,255
and that's when the spirits
started communicating with me.

1173
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:48,857
Let's go!

1174
01:31:49,302 --> 01:31:52,567
Disturbed spirits are attracted to
people in pain...

1175
01:31:52,638 --> 01:31:54,629
they feel a kindredness.

1176
01:31:54,874 --> 01:31:56,466
- Stop it, Suri, let go of me!

1177
01:31:56,842 --> 01:31:57,774
Stop it!

1178
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:00,410
Suri!

1179
01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:02,911
How could you lie to me?

1180
01:32:03,382 --> 01:32:04,349
You hid all this from me?

1181
01:32:04,417 --> 01:32:06,612
How can l tell you the truth?
You are never home.

1182
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:08,853
Don't change the subject.

1183
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:11,319
Do you really believe in that stuff?

1184
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:14,351
You're highly educated...
you taught science to kids...

1185
01:32:14,427 --> 01:32:16,691
think about it, Roshni,
use your head...

1186
01:32:17,229 --> 01:32:18,958
how can you believe this
nonsense?

1187
01:32:19,565 --> 01:32:21,726
l don't know what l believe...

1188
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:23,860
but l know she has told me things...

1189
01:32:23,903 --> 01:32:25,598
that only Karan knew about.

1190
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:28,540
lt makes me happy...

1191
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:30,473
why don't you understand?

1192
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:31,934
Suri...

1193
01:32:32,011 --> 01:32:34,241
Karan wants to talk to you!

1194
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:36,540
You've lost it completely, Roshni.
You need help.

1195
01:32:36,616 --> 01:32:37,776
l don't need help...

1196
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:39,477
l need to talk to you...

1197
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,315
Can you talk to me?

1198
01:32:41,387 --> 01:32:43,787
Can you stay home
one night with me?

1199
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:49,355
Can we live like a couple
and not like strangers?

1200
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:51,619
l'll see you later, sir.

1201
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:53,429
Hold on!

1202
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,195
You work with him, right?

1203
01:32:56,769 --> 01:32:59,795
Are you also out every night?

1204
01:33:00,306 --> 01:33:03,241
ls your wife okay
that you never come home?

1205
01:33:06,412 --> 01:33:07,902
Where do you go, Suri?

1206
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,607
Have l ever asked you?

1207
01:33:11,517 --> 01:33:12,916
Who are you with every night?

1208
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:16,278
l know you are
not working...

1209
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:19,247
l know you are with
someone.

1210
01:33:23,863 --> 01:33:26,297
l don't know where you go
or what you do...

1211
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:28,299
but it keeps you going...

1212
01:33:28,401 --> 01:33:29,595
it makes you happy.

1213
01:33:30,236 --> 01:33:33,603
So why can't l do something
that gives me peace and happiness?

1214
01:33:43,649 --> 01:33:44,707
See you later, sir.

1215
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:09,969
All couples go through phases...

1216
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:13,572
Suri and you have been through hell...

1217
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:17,306
give it time...
this too shall pass.

1218
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:19,612
l don't think so.

1219
01:34:26,559 --> 01:34:28,959
Have you thought about
having another child?

1220
01:34:32,331 --> 01:34:33,798
Suri would not hear of it.

1221
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:36,528
l tried bringing it up but...

1222
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:38,734
he didn't want to talk about it.

1223
01:34:46,345 --> 01:34:48,540
l think he is having an affair.

1224
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:50,847
What?

1225
01:34:52,618 --> 01:34:53,380
No way...

1226
01:34:53,886 --> 01:34:55,183
that's impossible...

1227
01:34:56,756 --> 01:34:59,623
Roshni, we're talking about Suri.

1228
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:02,327
l asked him straight out...

1229
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:04,253
he didn't even deny it.

1230
01:35:28,921 --> 01:35:30,411
What are you doing here?

1231
01:35:37,429 --> 01:35:38,828
l had to see you.

1232
01:35:43,235 --> 01:35:44,862
Are you falling for me, officer?

1233
01:35:58,651 --> 01:36:00,175
l'm kidding!

1234
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:03,622
What do you want to ask me?

1235
01:36:12,598 --> 01:36:13,622
Are you...

1236
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,698
are you okay?

1237
01:36:26,879 --> 01:36:28,813
l am very tired...

1238
01:36:39,425 --> 01:36:40,722
Come with me...

1239
01:36:45,798 --> 01:36:46,730
come on...

1240
01:37:40,219 --> 01:37:42,551
Please don't misunderstand...

1241
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:44,350
l just want to talk.

1242
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,289
lf someone says that to me...

1243
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:52,460
l suppose, l should be offended.

1244
01:37:58,904 --> 01:37:59,666
Come here...

1245
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,505
l won't bite.

1246
01:38:31,837 --> 01:38:34,533
This is my wife, Roshni...

1247
01:38:35,607 --> 01:38:36,596
and this is Karan...

1248
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:39,636
my son.

1249
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:42,608
Your wife is very beautiful.

1250
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:47,546
Roshni and l were very happy...

1251
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,147
What happened then?

1252
01:38:52,358 --> 01:38:53,552
Karan...

1253
01:39:15,714 --> 01:39:17,614
ls anyone really happy?

1254
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:22,175
Are you happy?

1255
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,317
l have my moments.

1256
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:40,335
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.

1257
01:39:42,374 --> 01:39:44,308
lt's not that simple...

1258
01:39:45,844 --> 01:39:46,970
Why not?

1259
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,316
You wouldn't believe me,
if l told you.

1260
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,553
Try me...

1261
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,552
Some other time perhaps...

1262
01:40:06,465 --> 01:40:08,524
Can you do me a favour, please?

1263
01:40:12,438 --> 01:40:12,961
What?

1264
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,399
Remember Mallika?

1265
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:18,007
Shashi's girlfriend?

1266
01:40:19,912 --> 01:40:20,810
Yeah...

1267
01:40:21,447 --> 01:40:22,880
She is in a mess...

1268
01:40:23,449 --> 01:40:25,576
can you help her?

1269
01:40:27,252 --> 01:40:28,913
What happened to her?

1270
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,452
Close your eyes...

1271
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:45,855
Hey you...

1272
01:41:46,398 --> 01:41:47,524
get Mallika.

1273
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:48,764
Okay, sir.

1274
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:02,869
Where's Mallika?

1275
01:42:04,449 --> 01:42:06,280
For today l'm Mallika...

1276
01:42:06,351 --> 01:42:07,409
what do you want?

1277
01:42:08,253 --> 01:42:09,811
Police business, get her.

1278
01:42:09,888 --> 01:42:11,287
She's out.

1279
01:42:13,825 --> 01:42:16,487
Call her out or
l'll come back with a warrant...

1280
01:42:16,929 --> 01:42:18,726
and that will be the end of you.

1281
01:42:43,922 --> 01:42:45,446
Who did this to you?

1282
01:42:46,425 --> 01:42:49,394
Shashi paid her off for me...

1283
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:50,826
now she denies it...

1284
01:42:50,896 --> 01:42:52,796
and is forcing me back to work.

1285
01:42:53,732 --> 01:42:55,723
lf you want to get out of here,
sit in the car.

1286
01:43:00,572 --> 01:43:02,437
They won't let me leave...

1287
01:43:02,908 --> 01:43:05,502
Don't worry about them...
get in the car.

1288
01:43:07,879 --> 01:43:09,210
Trust me...

1289
01:43:10,282 --> 01:43:11,681
don't be scared.

1290
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:22,225
Where do you think you're going?

1291
01:43:22,294 --> 01:43:23,386
Go stop her!

1292
01:43:23,629 --> 01:43:24,926
Come back here...

1293
01:43:50,489 --> 01:43:52,582
Let me file these papers.

1294
01:43:58,897 --> 01:44:00,262
She is a good woman.

1295
01:44:01,433 --> 01:44:02,627
She will help you.

1296
01:44:05,337 --> 01:44:05,962
Sir...

1297
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:09,765
thank you.

1298
01:44:13,445 --> 01:44:15,242
Don't thank me, thank Rosie...

1299
01:44:15,947 --> 01:44:17,710
she told me about you.

1300
01:44:18,617 --> 01:44:19,549
Rosie?

1301
01:44:20,485 --> 01:44:21,679
Who's she?

1302
01:44:21,953 --> 01:44:23,784
She is one of Madam's girls.

1303
01:44:26,325 --> 01:44:28,384
l don't know
who you're talking about...

1304
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:31,827
That's how it is with us girls...
today Rosie, tomorrow Jasmine.

1305
01:44:32,297 --> 01:44:33,559
That's how we play it.

1306
01:44:41,707 --> 01:44:42,605
Sir...

1307
01:44:44,476 --> 01:44:47,741
l... lied to you earlier.

1308
01:44:47,779 --> 01:44:50,543
Shashi knew Armaan Kapoor.

1309
01:44:51,383 --> 01:44:53,442
Shashi met Armaan Kapoor...

1310
01:44:53,485 --> 01:44:54,918
on the night of his accident.

1311
01:44:57,723 --> 01:44:59,315
Do you know why?

1312
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:02,360
l never meddled in his work.

1313
01:45:04,629 --> 01:45:06,221
But, you know what...

1314
01:45:06,398 --> 01:45:08,662
you should get hold of
that slime Tehmur...

1315
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:10,668
l'm sure he knows something.

1316
01:45:11,403 --> 01:45:13,394
After everything Shashi did for him...

1317
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,837
Tehmur... help me...

1318
01:45:14,906 --> 01:45:19,468
- The creep didn't raise a finger
to help me.

1319
01:45:20,512 --> 01:45:22,275
Tehmur, don't do this...

1320
01:45:22,347 --> 01:45:24,508
Shashi was like a brother to you.

1321
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:27,552
- He was trying to steal Shashi's stuff.

1322
01:45:27,919 --> 01:45:29,216
What stuff?

1323
01:45:30,756 --> 01:45:32,724
lt was a green bag...

1324
01:45:32,924 --> 01:45:34,949
which Shashi had got home that night.

1325
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,666
Tomorrow morning at 11:15
at Churchgate station, come alone.

1326
01:45:46,271 --> 01:45:47,898
- Bring the money with you...

1327
01:45:48,373 --> 01:45:50,864
l'll call you with more instructions...

1328
01:45:51,743 --> 01:45:53,404
One more thing...

1329
01:45:54,279 --> 01:45:56,372
- if l meet with Shashi's fate...

1330
01:45:57,582 --> 01:46:02,212
whether you're responsible for
it or not, the cops will get the stuff.

1331
01:46:04,189 --> 01:46:04,951
Fine.

1332
01:46:06,725 --> 01:46:08,716
l've to work...
what is it?

1333
01:46:09,327 --> 01:46:10,817
l need your help...

1334
01:46:10,896 --> 01:46:11,885
My help?

1335
01:46:12,731 --> 01:46:15,222
l can't trust anyone but you.

1336
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:15,857
Hold it!

1337
01:46:15,934 --> 01:46:18,266
l don't want to get into any mess.

1338
01:46:18,336 --> 01:46:19,428
Nirmala...

1339
01:46:19,905 --> 01:46:21,896
lf this plan works out...

1340
01:46:21,973 --> 01:46:24,441
you and l can get out of here.

1341
01:46:24,509 --> 01:46:25,840
Free as birds...

1342
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:27,739
think about it.

1343
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,923
l don't know who is the bigger fool...

1344
01:46:43,195 --> 01:46:44,389
you or l...

1345
01:46:47,232 --> 01:46:48,256
Tehmur!

1346
01:47:05,617 --> 01:47:06,379
Hello?

1347
01:47:06,585 --> 01:47:07,677
Listen carefully...

1348
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,381
there is a restroom
to your right...

1349
01:47:10,455 --> 01:47:13,515
you'll see a blue bag under the basin,
dump the money into it.

1350
01:47:13,592 --> 01:47:14,616
- Get it?

1351
01:47:14,693 --> 01:47:15,455
Yeah...

1352
01:47:15,527 --> 01:47:17,518
- Then head to platform number 4...

1353
01:47:17,596 --> 01:47:19,962
the train for Virar
leaves in 5 minutes...

1354
01:47:20,232 --> 01:47:22,257
- get into the compartment
next to the first class.

1355
01:47:22,334 --> 01:47:24,268
Hurry up, you don't want to
miss the train.

1356
01:47:38,216 --> 01:47:41,652
l don't know

1357
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,486
And neither do you

1358
01:47:45,557 --> 01:47:48,822
At which point

1359
01:47:48,894 --> 01:47:52,796
What time will choose

1360
01:47:52,864 --> 01:48:00,293
ln this gamble called life

1361
01:48:00,372 --> 01:48:03,637
What will we win

1362
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:05,369
And what will we lose

1363
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:08,844
Hi darling!

1364
01:48:08,914 --> 01:48:10,814
That's a... nice bag...

1365
01:48:15,287 --> 01:48:16,618
Who you are working for?

1366
01:48:16,888 --> 01:48:17,786
Tell me...

1367
01:48:17,856 --> 01:48:19,448
l'll make it worth your
while.

1368
01:48:21,793 --> 01:48:23,260
l can give you a lot more.

1369
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:24,325
Listen!

1370
01:48:24,396 --> 01:48:25,522
You're making a mistake.

1371
01:48:37,275 --> 01:48:40,802
l don't know

1372
01:48:40,879 --> 01:48:44,508
And neither do you

1373
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:47,882
At which point

1374
01:48:48,186 --> 01:48:51,815
What time will choose

1375
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:59,353
ln this gamble called life

1376
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:02,696
What will we win

1377
01:49:02,767 --> 01:49:06,635
And what will we lose

1378
01:49:29,628 --> 01:49:33,530
Where there is happiness

1379
01:49:33,632 --> 01:49:36,499
ln its shadow l reside

1380
01:49:36,601 --> 01:49:40,867
And those who smile

1381
01:49:40,939 --> 01:49:44,375
Also have a tear in their eye

1382
01:49:44,442 --> 01:49:48,208
Wherever you go

1383
01:49:48,279 --> 01:49:51,715
Beneath you the same ground will lie

1384
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:54,885
And above you the same sky

1385
01:49:54,953 --> 01:49:58,684
l don't know

1386
01:49:58,757 --> 01:50:02,420
And neither do you

1387
01:50:02,494 --> 01:50:05,827
At which point

1388
01:50:05,864 --> 01:50:09,732
What time will choose

1389
01:50:09,801 --> 01:50:17,230
ln this gamble called life

1390
01:50:17,308 --> 01:50:20,607
What will we win

1391
01:50:20,679 --> 01:50:25,013
And what will we lose

1392
01:50:46,705 --> 01:50:48,366
l need your help...

1393
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,408
l can't trust anyone but you.

1394
01:50:50,842 --> 01:50:53,936
l don't know who's the bigger fool...
you or l...

1395
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:55,677
Listen...

1396
01:50:55,747 --> 01:50:57,305
You have to pretend...

1397
01:50:57,382 --> 01:50:59,247
not to know me.

1398
01:50:59,617 --> 01:51:01,278
Don't talk to me...

1399
01:51:01,486 --> 01:51:03,249
in fact, don't even look at me.

1400
01:51:32,317 --> 01:51:33,341
Corner him!

1401
01:51:39,924 --> 01:51:41,186
Catch him!

1402
01:51:44,929 --> 01:51:46,419
Where's the money, you jerk!

1403
01:51:52,804 --> 01:51:54,431
This guy is operating on his own...

1404
01:51:54,939 --> 01:51:56,372
- he confessed everything...

1405
01:51:56,441 --> 01:51:57,703
- he worked For Shashi...

1406
01:51:57,776 --> 01:51:59,937
and happened to stumble upon this...

1407
01:52:00,211 --> 01:52:01,838
- he doesn't even know your name...

1408
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,878
- he got your number
from Shashi's SlM card.

1409
01:52:07,719 --> 01:52:09,277
Finish him off...

1410
01:52:09,621 --> 01:52:11,680
- You will get the rest of your money...

1411
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:14,390
and don't call me ever again.

1412
01:53:01,206 --> 01:53:02,639
Did you ever think of me?

1413
01:53:03,374 --> 01:53:04,534
Did you... even once?

1414
01:53:04,609 --> 01:53:05,940
l haven't done anything...

1415
01:53:06,244 --> 01:53:08,235
You claimed to be my friend...

1416
01:53:10,415 --> 01:53:11,541
l did nothing...

1417
01:53:21,726 --> 01:53:23,523
Over there...
they pushed him...

1418
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,412
l will join you on the train.

1419
01:53:50,488 --> 01:53:51,819
But if l don't get there...

1420
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:54,188
don't wait for me.

1421
01:53:56,594 --> 01:53:58,858
Get on the train,
come what may.

1422
01:54:01,299 --> 01:54:02,732
You've got to be on that train, okay?!

1423
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:37,630
Simran...

1424
01:54:37,702 --> 01:54:39,795
- He said Simran...
- Simran?

1425
01:54:39,938 --> 01:54:42,566
Yes, sir, he said Simran...

1426
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,198
and died.

1427
01:54:44,275 --> 01:54:45,765
Sir, the hospital called...

1428
01:54:45,843 --> 01:54:47,401
that goon is conscious...

1429
01:54:47,478 --> 01:54:48,877
we can take his statement,
should l go?

1430
01:54:48,947 --> 01:54:50,380
No, l'll go.

1431
01:54:50,448 --> 01:54:51,540
Now listen...

1432
01:54:51,616 --> 01:54:53,481
you and Rane go to the brothel.

1433
01:54:53,785 --> 01:54:56,754
Apparently Tehmur mentioned a 'Simran'
before he died...

1434
01:54:56,821 --> 01:54:59,449
Find out who this girl is
that Tehmur knew...

1435
01:54:59,891 --> 01:55:01,950
probably one of Madam's girls,
bring her in.

1436
01:55:04,195 --> 01:55:06,857
lt's in your best interest to
cooperate with me...

1437
01:55:08,833 --> 01:55:10,630
or else,
the lockup is where you'll be.

1438
01:55:12,303 --> 01:55:13,270
Sir is talking to you...

1439
01:55:13,338 --> 01:55:14,202
Sir!

1440
01:55:14,472 --> 01:55:15,564
the patient is still critical.

1441
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,834
- Leave the room...
- But, sir...

1442
01:55:16,908 --> 01:55:18,603
Let me do my job.
Get out!

1443
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:20,377
Out!

1444
01:55:24,749 --> 01:55:26,410
No one can help you now!

1445
01:55:26,484 --> 01:55:28,577
lf you are lucky enough to survive...

1446
01:55:28,653 --> 01:55:29,881
here's what will happen.

1447
01:55:29,954 --> 01:55:33,287
l'll take you into my custody
and question you...

1448
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:35,551
and l have a way of getting the truth.

1449
01:55:37,362 --> 01:55:39,296
Then l'll file a case against you...

1450
01:55:40,398 --> 01:55:41,888
for Tehmur's murder...

1451
01:55:42,633 --> 01:55:45,659
and l'll make sure you get
the death penalty for killing him.

1452
01:55:47,372 --> 01:55:48,839
l guarantee you that.

1453
01:55:49,374 --> 01:55:50,841
Tehmur was a key police witness...

1454
01:55:51,442 --> 01:55:53,342
and you were caught red-handed.

1455
01:55:54,278 --> 01:55:55,404
Think about it...

1456
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,879
if you cooperate...

1457
01:55:56,948 --> 01:55:58,916
l'll save you from the death penalty.

1458
01:55:59,283 --> 01:56:01,808
Tell me, who hired you
to clear their mess?

1459
01:56:05,957 --> 01:56:08,357
Ghorpade, take him into our custody.
l think he prefers to be there.

1460
01:56:08,426 --> 01:56:09,358
Sir...

1461
01:56:09,761 --> 01:56:11,854
the doctor said
he can't be discharged...

1462
01:56:11,929 --> 01:56:13,863
Tell the doctor
he didn't say anything like that.

1463
01:56:13,931 --> 01:56:16,866
l want this man in my custody today.
Do whatever it takes.

1464
01:56:16,934 --> 01:56:17,696
Yes, sir.

1465
01:56:18,403 --> 01:56:19,392
Gokhale...

1466
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,596
get started...

1467
01:56:20,872 --> 01:56:22,601
remove these pipes and tubes...

1468
01:56:22,974 --> 01:56:24,339
Sanjay Kejriwal!

1469
01:56:27,745 --> 01:56:28,769
What?

1470
01:56:28,946 --> 01:56:30,311
Sanjay Kejriwal.

1471
01:56:33,284 --> 01:56:34,615
Sir, there's no Simran here.

1472
01:56:36,254 --> 01:56:37,278
No, sir...

1473
01:56:37,555 --> 01:56:40,217
a few girls said there was
someone called Simran...

1474
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:41,553
but she ran away
some years ago.

1475
01:56:41,626 --> 01:56:43,457
Where could she have gone?
Someone has to know...

1476
01:56:43,528 --> 01:56:44,927
it's possible that
she is still there...

1477
01:56:45,196 --> 01:56:46,754
and the other girls are
trying to protect her.

1478
01:56:46,831 --> 01:56:49,561
Tell Rane to stay
there and keep looking.

1479
01:56:49,634 --> 01:56:50,464
Okay, sir.

1480
01:56:50,535 --> 01:56:51,900
- You go to the police station...

1481
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:54,502
and meet me at Sanjay Kejriwal's
bungalow with a team.

1482
01:56:54,572 --> 01:56:55,300
Hurry up!

1483
01:56:55,373 --> 01:56:55,771
- Yes, sir.

1484
01:56:56,274 --> 01:56:57,298
This way, sir.

1485
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:14,883
lnspector Shekhawat!

1486
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:17,587
What brings you here?

1487
01:57:17,662 --> 01:57:19,721
Mr. Kejriwal, l have a warrant
for your arrest.

1488
01:57:20,298 --> 01:57:21,287
What?

1489
01:57:24,268 --> 01:57:25,428
On what basis?

1490
01:57:25,837 --> 01:57:28,203
For getting Tehmur and Shashi murdered.

1491
01:57:29,273 --> 01:57:30,205
Babu Tipnis...

1492
01:57:30,808 --> 01:57:32,298
you know him already...

1493
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:34,610
He has signed
an affidavit implicating you...

1494
01:57:34,879 --> 01:57:36,710
you have to come with us.

1495
01:57:41,152 --> 01:57:42,642
Hand over your mobile phone, please.

1496
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,709
Now!

1497
01:57:44,589 --> 01:57:45,817
Let's go.

1498
01:57:49,827 --> 01:57:51,454
Come on, stand up.

1499
01:57:53,264 --> 01:57:54,595
- l said stand up!
- Please...

1500
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,233
just a minute.

1501
01:57:59,737 --> 01:58:01,227
Can we talk?

1502
01:58:03,774 --> 01:58:04,832
Go ahead.

1503
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:06,907
ln private?

1504
01:58:07,445 --> 01:58:08,935
l'm afraid not.

1505
01:58:13,684 --> 01:58:15,618
He was blackmailing us...

1506
01:58:17,355 --> 01:58:19,619
lt all started three years ago.

1507
01:58:20,892 --> 01:58:24,384
Armaan, me and our friend, Nikhil...

1508
01:58:24,662 --> 01:58:25,526
- were out one night.

1509
01:58:25,596 --> 01:58:27,791
l know what we can take to
the bachelor party...

1510
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:30,391
Nikhil knew Shashi...

1511
01:58:30,468 --> 01:58:31,492
- go to Hotel Lido...

1512
01:58:31,702 --> 01:58:32,464
Hello Shashi...

1513
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:35,200
- We went with him to Hotel Lido...

1514
01:58:35,506 --> 01:58:37,531
- and there we picked up a girl.

1515
01:58:39,343 --> 01:58:40,901
l wasn't happy about it.

1516
01:58:42,246 --> 01:58:43,440
What was the girl's name?

1517
01:58:46,284 --> 01:58:47,251
Simran.

1518
01:58:50,855 --> 01:58:52,755
Nikhil started messing
with the girl in the car...

1519
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:55,921
How about a trial...

1520
01:58:58,629 --> 01:58:59,596
- What happened next?

1521
01:59:00,631 --> 01:59:01,563
l don't know...

1522
01:59:02,633 --> 01:59:05,329
- probably the back door
wasn't locked properly...

1523
01:59:07,238 --> 01:59:08,262
lt was an accident!

1524
01:59:15,813 --> 01:59:16,837
Nikhil!

1525
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:19,638
Shit!

1526
01:59:20,218 --> 01:59:20,809
Nikhil!

1527
01:59:20,885 --> 01:59:21,852
Be careful...

1528
01:59:22,753 --> 01:59:24,311
- Easy...
- Okay...

1529
01:59:30,528 --> 01:59:32,723
Armaan, get into the car now!

1530
01:59:32,797 --> 01:59:35,391
Sanjay, we can't leave her
in this state...

1531
01:59:35,466 --> 01:59:36,694
Dude, you're asking for trouble...

1532
01:59:36,767 --> 01:59:38,394
we'll get screwed
because of this hooker.

1533
01:59:38,469 --> 01:59:39,367
Get in the car...

1534
01:59:39,437 --> 01:59:41,837
- Please!
- Sanjay?

1535
01:59:42,373 --> 01:59:44,705
- Sanjay, we can't leave her here...
what if she dies...

1536
01:59:44,775 --> 01:59:46,299
Call that guy, Shashi...

1537
01:59:46,377 --> 01:59:48,311
Call Shashi, he will handle it...

1538
01:59:49,647 --> 01:59:50,671
Oh God!

1539
01:59:58,990 --> 02:00:01,424
Shashi called Armaan a week later...

1540
02:00:01,826 --> 02:00:03,794
and sent him a DVD...

1541
02:00:04,895 --> 02:00:08,296
it had footage from
the security camera at Hotel Lido...

1542
02:00:08,366 --> 02:00:11,927
of the three of us
leaving the lobby with the girl.

1543
02:00:13,738 --> 02:00:15,968
Shashi told us the girl was dead...

1544
02:00:16,707 --> 02:00:18,937
and he had buried her body somewhere.

1545
02:00:20,378 --> 02:00:21,606
Where's the DVD?

1546
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,521
l know her, she's the one
who has been helping me.

1547
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:35,022
You mean, she is... alive?

1548
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,558
Yes, Mr. Kejriwal,
l've met her several times...

1549
02:00:39,363 --> 02:00:41,854
l think Shashi and the girl
conned you.

1550
02:00:42,366 --> 02:00:45,392
But sir, if that's the case,
why would she help you?

1551
02:00:49,473 --> 02:00:51,304
Only she can answer that.

1552
02:00:53,277 --> 02:00:54,835
Devrath,
head to Hotel Lido right now...

1553
02:00:54,912 --> 02:00:56,311
she might be there...

1554
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,280
she goes by the name
of Rosie nowadays, not Simran...

1555
02:00:58,349 --> 02:00:59,680
and inform Rane as well.

1556
02:01:00,217 --> 02:01:02,344
Get her to the police
station immediately.

1557
02:01:02,453 --> 02:01:03,579
Yes, sir.

1558
02:01:03,654 --> 02:01:04,552
Let's go.

1559
02:01:16,834 --> 02:01:19,928
lf you had informed the police
right at the beginning...

1560
02:01:20,004 --> 02:01:21,596
it would've saved many lives...

1561
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,831
probably your friend, Armaan's too.

1562
02:01:26,911 --> 02:01:28,435
So much happened...
and all for what?

1563
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,384
Look out!

1564
02:05:20,377 --> 02:05:21,275
- Sir...

1565
02:05:21,512 --> 02:05:23,503
- l think only l can see her...

1566
02:05:25,583 --> 02:05:27,244
Have you lost your mind, Shekhawat?

1567
02:05:28,886 --> 02:05:32,549
Next thing you'll tell me...
is that you saw a ghost!

1568
02:05:38,462 --> 02:05:40,293
Don't misunderstand me...

1569
02:05:41,799 --> 02:05:44,927
l and the police department
value you tremendously...

1570
02:05:47,271 --> 02:05:51,173
but there's talk going on about you
that could ruin your career.

1571
02:05:53,677 --> 02:05:57,272
Your subordinates have been saying
that you don't sleep at night...

1572
02:05:57,848 --> 02:05:59,679
keep driving all night...

1573
02:06:00,551 --> 02:06:02,212
you talk to yourself...

1574
02:06:03,554 --> 02:06:05,545
Look at them staring at us...

1575
02:06:05,723 --> 02:06:07,486
They probably think...

1576
02:06:07,558 --> 02:06:09,458
l'm picking you up.

1577
02:06:10,494 --> 02:06:12,257
Why would l lie?

1578
02:06:12,396 --> 02:06:14,489
People here don't really help the cops.

1579
02:06:30,814 --> 02:06:32,645
Think about your future, Shekhawat...

1580
02:06:33,384 --> 02:06:36,512
if you mention this
in your official report...

1581
02:06:36,587 --> 02:06:38,282
you know what's going to happen...

1582
02:06:40,457 --> 02:06:42,755
you'll be the laughing stock
of the department.

1583
02:06:48,432 --> 02:06:50,923
l think... you should
take a break for two months...

1584
02:06:51,468 --> 02:06:52,560
you really need it.

1585
02:06:55,272 --> 02:06:56,637
But what about the truth?

1586
02:06:57,207 --> 02:06:58,765
The truth is that...

1587
02:06:58,842 --> 02:07:02,642
Sanjay Kejriwal decided to end his life
instead of going to jail.

1588
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,177
Armaan Kapoor died in an accident
that can only be an act of providence.

1589
02:07:07,484 --> 02:07:09,782
And the two men blackmailing them...

1590
02:07:09,853 --> 02:07:11,218
they're dead.

1591
02:07:11,288 --> 02:07:12,448
Case closed!

1592
02:07:14,391 --> 02:07:16,723
This is the truth and this
will go as your official statement.

1593
02:07:17,795 --> 02:07:18,853
Am l clear?

1594
02:07:21,965 --> 02:07:23,227
Yes, sir.

1595
02:07:23,967 --> 02:07:25,195
Good.

1596
02:07:50,761 --> 02:07:52,752
What are you doing here, Rosie?

1597
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:54,388
You don't belong here.

1598
02:07:54,465 --> 02:07:56,262
l've been waiting for you...

1599
02:07:56,667 --> 02:07:59,898
to come along and rescue me.

1600
02:08:00,471 --> 02:08:01,768
No, Surjan, listen to me...

1601
02:08:01,839 --> 02:08:04,603
deal with your pain,
or you will attract more of it.

1602
02:08:04,675 --> 02:08:07,439
Disturbed spirits are attracted to
people in pain...

1603
02:08:07,544 --> 02:08:09,774
they feel a kindredness.

1604
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:12,813
l can take your pain away.

1605
02:08:14,284 --> 02:08:18,345
Some people can talk to spirits...
l have read such things happen...

1606
02:08:18,422 --> 02:08:20,890
Think about it, Roshni,
use your head...

1607
02:08:20,958 --> 02:08:22,858
how can you believe this
nonsense?

1608
02:08:34,805 --> 02:08:37,706
There are many things in this world
that can't be explained.

1609
02:08:40,144 --> 02:08:44,740
You can still get out of here...
start a new life.

1610
02:08:44,815 --> 02:08:47,249
lt's not that simple...

1611
02:08:47,317 --> 02:08:48,375
Why not?

1612
02:08:49,153 --> 02:08:51,348
You wouldn't believe me,
if l told you.

1613
02:08:55,659 --> 02:08:58,355
Let me take you to a place...

1614
02:08:58,462 --> 02:09:00,396
where no one will bother us.

1615
02:09:09,173 --> 02:09:11,641
lf you want,
l can figure something out for you...

1616
02:09:11,842 --> 02:09:12,934
Really?

1617
02:09:13,577 --> 02:09:14,942
What can you do for me?

1618
02:09:17,948 --> 02:09:19,415
l knew you would be back.

1619
02:09:30,194 --> 02:09:35,427
Only trapped spirits can
manifest themselves in human form.

1620
02:09:35,699 --> 02:09:37,291
lf we don't exist...

1621
02:09:37,367 --> 02:09:39,198
how can we go missing?

1622
02:09:43,574 --> 02:09:45,508
Three years ago a friend of mine...

1623
02:09:45,576 --> 02:09:47,544
went out with some guys...

1624
02:09:48,545 --> 02:09:49,842
She never came back.

1625
02:09:51,215 --> 02:09:52,910
l mean, think about it.

1626
02:09:54,284 --> 02:09:56,252
A girl just vanishes...

1627
02:09:56,787 --> 02:09:58,880
and it makes no difference to anyone.

1628
02:10:08,599 --> 02:10:09,725
What is this place?

1629
02:10:11,535 --> 02:10:12,832
lt's my secret spot...

1630
02:10:13,537 --> 02:10:14,868
hardly anyone ever comes here.

1631
02:10:15,305 --> 02:10:16,829
lf you can't find me anywhere else...

1632
02:10:16,907 --> 02:10:18,568
you'll probably find me here...

1633
02:13:14,618 --> 02:13:16,483
Why don't you understand, Suri?

1634
02:13:16,553 --> 02:13:18,748
Karan wants to talk to you!

1635
02:13:23,326 --> 02:13:24,520
And who knows...

1636
02:13:25,796 --> 02:13:28,526
someday l might end up
doing something for you.

1637
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:03,729
Hello dad, l miss you...

1638
02:14:04,468 --> 02:14:08,598
l know you miss me a lot too...

1639
02:14:11,475 --> 02:14:14,842
What happened that
day was not your fault...

1640
02:14:15,445 --> 02:14:17,310
it was my fault, dad...

1641
02:14:18,448 --> 02:14:19,745
l am sorry.

1642
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:26,616
There was nothing
you could have done to change it...

1643
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:28,681
this is what l had to tell you...

1644
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:33,623
Please don't blame yourself...

1645
02:14:34,464 --> 02:14:36,728
because that makes me very sad.

1646
02:14:38,535 --> 02:14:42,494
Please don't fight
with mom because of me.

1647
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,868
l can never be happy
if both of you are so unhappy.

1648
02:14:57,287 --> 02:15:00,916
Dad, do you remember telling me...

1649
02:15:01,324 --> 02:15:04,691
that you always wanted
to see me happy?

1650
02:15:04,761 --> 02:15:09,323
l know l can count on you
to make everything okay...

1651
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:12,266
because you are the
best dad in the world.

1652
02:16:35,418 --> 02:16:38,387
The world may say

1653
02:16:38,455 --> 02:16:42,414
You are gone

1654
02:16:42,492 --> 02:16:46,360
But you are here

1655
02:16:46,429 --> 02:16:49,728
You are right here

1656
02:16:51,368 --> 02:16:54,394
The world may say

1657
02:16:54,504 --> 02:16:58,406
You are gone

1658
02:16:58,475 --> 02:17:02,343
But you are here

1659
02:17:02,412 --> 02:17:06,610
You are right here

1660
02:17:06,683 --> 02:17:10,585
ln my every thought

1661
02:17:10,654 --> 02:17:14,613
Every word spoken

1662
02:17:14,691 --> 02:17:18,650
ln my every feeling

1663
02:17:18,728 --> 02:17:22,357
My every emotion

1664
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:25,458
There is only you

1665
02:17:25,535 --> 02:17:29,471
You are everywhere

1666
02:17:31,474 --> 02:17:34,409
The world may say

1667
02:17:34,444 --> 02:17:38,312
You are gone

1668
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:42,317
But you are here

1669
02:17:42,385 --> 02:17:46,583
You are right here

1670
02:17:46,656 --> 02:17:50,387
The world may say

1671
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:54,692
You are gone

1672
02:17:54,764 --> 02:17:58,393
But you are here

1673
02:17:58,468 --> 02:18:02,768
You are right here

1674
02:18:10,613 --> 02:18:18,679
You never really left my side

1675
02:18:18,755 --> 02:18:26,628
You hold my hand even today

1676
02:18:26,696 --> 02:18:34,535
No matter what the destination is

1677
02:18:34,637 --> 02:18:42,476
You will be my fellow traveller

1678
02:18:42,545 --> 02:18:49,644
All the way

1679
02:18:49,719 --> 02:18:58,593
The world may say you are gone

1680
02:18:58,661 --> 02:19:02,597
But you are here

1681
02:19:02,665 --> 02:19:05,600
You are right here

1682
02:19:05,668 --> 02:19:14,804
The world may say you are gone

1683
02:19:14,844 --> 02:19:18,507
But you are here

1684
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:20,515
You are right here
