00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,354


3
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:41,956


4
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,115
Jai Hind, sir.

5
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,288
Sir ..

6
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:14,727
What is the matter of police officers?
 in the army camp?

7
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:18,620
My name is Imasuangi.

8
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:21,997
Police inspector in Balarum area.

9
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:28,268
Last night the pub was under care area
I had a fight.

10
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:33,511
A soldier involved
in the incident.

11
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,270
Proceed.

12
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:43,287
Midnight last night, I have been
received a call from the pub.

13
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,087
It is an emergency call.

14
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,871
- Why?
- I do not know, sir.

15
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:00,724
From the beginning it all goes with
 smooth, suddenly a fight broke out.

16
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,828
It ends up quickly.

17
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:04,028
What?

18
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,515
I always see 10
people hit one.

19
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,279
But he was just one
has hit 10 people.

20
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,919
This is my lifetime
I first saw it.

21
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,685
Who is he?

22
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:16,241
Where are he?

23
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,868
- Constable, go find him.
- Sir, sir ..

24
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:20,356
Where are you looking for?

25
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,633
He did not go anywhere.

26
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,607
She was sitting inside
alone while drinking alcohol.

27
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,898
Who are you?

28
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:03,479
Who is ..

29
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,464
Who are you?

30
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,902
Why are you hit them?

31
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,413
You ..
Why are you hit?

32
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:41,731
Because I'm angry.

33
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:43,985
What?

34
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,359
Because I feel angry.

35
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,658
If you're angry,
You're a little stupid

36
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,978
He is the son of the minister.

37
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,497
What minister?

38
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:55,245
Not his only son, the minister
 I was willing to hit.

39
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:01,144
Tell me why are you angry?

40
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,884
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

41
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,610
Sorry yes ??

42
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,746
You dare to touch me.

43
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,424
- Excuse me.
- sorry?

44
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,801
Beautiful woman
I, you all touched ..

45
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,762
Just look at it instead
tell me I'm sorry.

46
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,619
What's on you
to see me?

47
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,827
Release me.

48
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,104
Apologize. Speak!

49
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:47,423
Speak!

50
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,019
Sorry.

51
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,458
Go.

52
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:09,123
Hey! Who are you?

53
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,588
You shame my girlfriend?

54
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,256
You better leave her.

55
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:16,570
Because he told me everywhere
the man at this disco looked at him.

56
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,688
Baby

57
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,496
Who are you?

58
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,290
What's your name?

59
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,101
I never saw
he's here. Who are you talking to?

60
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:26,200
From the conversation
as he is not from the north.

61
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:31,913
South? Come from the south
to the north why brazen?

62
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,572
South India, go!

63
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,198
South India.

64
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:45,378
North India.

65
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,490
East West.

66
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,172
Is not it all
is in india?

67
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,305
India is just one.

68
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,120
Let me tell you now.

69
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:04,178
My name is Surya.

70
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,140
My home is Indian.

71
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,758
Little things like that,
should you hit them

72
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,534
That's my real problem.

73
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,999
I do not like to pace slowly.

74
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:41,228
Actually to enjoy it is not
just an appointment, but a fight.

75
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,400
Sir, I did that.

76
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:48,283
If I'm hungry, I'll be full.
If I'm sleepy, I'll sleep well.

77
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,925
If I'm angry,
I'm going to hit me enough.

78
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:10,938
I refrain from this.

79
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:12,728
There is a notice board there.

80
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:16,620
But since you even smoke,
I think the board is worthless.

81
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,969
Babu, bring a cigarette ash.

82
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,438
You're getting more interesting.

83
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,668
But this is a problem
with the minister.

84
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,358
It's not interesting anymore.

85
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:36,441
Okay, let's go.

86
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:42,328
For me 10 thousand, write a letter
apologies and signatures.

87
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,558
You're sorry ...

88
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,345
Or want to get bribes?

89
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,450
Why, you can not
give a bribe?

90
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:51,978
He knew he was not talking
with whom?

91
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:56,368
Hey, you know you're in
where now? You know no?

92
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:57,978
My police station.

93
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:05,198
Just listen to me, write a letter,
for me 10 thousand and you go back.

94
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:08,180
I will not give a bribe.

95
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,528
I will not apologize.

96
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,184
You want me to show
 polythe's power?

97
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,690
Raise your hand.

98
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:29,778
Beretta M9

99
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:36,374
Five inches for 50 miles.
The total amount is 170 grams.

100
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,758
Sir, he told me
I am early.

101
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,154
He will not hit
people without reason.

102
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,288
But I did not understand
warning him.

103
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:15,463
Now, I'm not coming
come here to find a problem.

104
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,094
I came to take my gun back.

105
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,581
So now, uniform police
I lost my gun.

106
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,421
Sir!

107
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,278
Where is Surya soldier?

108
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,912
5 minutes before I arrived
I see him in block B, sir.

109
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,592
Tell him to see me soon.

110
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,218
Wait, wait!

111
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,912
Block B, is not it
terrorist prison?

112
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:42,328
What did Surya do there?

113
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:26,638
It's very tasty.

114
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,508
Only tomorrow please bring me

115
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:34,606
.. with shrimp once.

116
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,491
You will not have that chance.

117
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,833
That's your last straw.

118
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:40,965
When you finish eating,
I will kill you.

119
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,902
You trying to scare me?

120
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,178
You remember I'll break the secret ..

121
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,328
..and betray my country?

122
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:59,002
You've betrayed it
your country.

123
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,218
Actually if you
really love your country.

124
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:04,928
You'll think like that
how to advance the country.

125
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,228
Not thinking what
to destroy India.

126
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:15,603
Actually I want to know,
 You put a bomb in India ..

127
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,058
.. but why do not you bomb
your own country.

128
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,212
Are you weak?

129
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:25,036
So why are you a school bomb and
kill innocent children?

130
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:31,318
Your fate is not so good, you're right
terrorists and I have to kill you.

131
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,158
If I see you at the scene ..

132
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,698
..i sure I killed you first
before the explosion occurred.

133
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:42,605
Your fate is not very good
but you know ..

134
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:47,508
..you'll die like a fool,
and you should not die killed ..

135
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,538
..by a soldier.

136
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:25,832
Who gave directions to shoot?

137
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,981
Tell me who
who shot a shot?

138
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:32,068
Nobody, sir.

139
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:33,288
So why are you firing?

140
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:34,938
Because I was very angry.

141
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,468
What?

142
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:41,255
Because terrorists are trying to destroy
my country has been well served.

143
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:43,248
That's what made me angry.

144
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,688
You remember we purposely gave it
good service to her?

145
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:48,568
You know no terrorists
 have evidence.

146
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,424
Sir, what evidence is there?

147
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:52,978
Previously we held one
the criminals for months.

148
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:58,160
We wrote a letter to Pakistan
 about his detained people.

149
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:01,833
And they easily answer, address
not worthy and they do not recognize it.

150
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,636
So you killed him?

151
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,268
In the army there is a rule!

152
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,808
Can not follow emotionally.

153
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:11,221
There are 600 military personnel in this camp.

154
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,999
How many awards? is that
 one achievement? How many medals?

155
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,770
 And in all that just
there is a black dot.

156
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,288
You!

157
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,248
I noticed
 you for 7 years.

158
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,528
Every day there is
 complaints about you.

159
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:30,231
The book is full of reports
Your name is in red ink.

160
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:34,695
As a soldier,
You can not control yourself.

161
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:39,478
Always fight and you're not
anyone is just a human being.

162
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:43,188
I'm a normal human but I'm there
 explanation for each complaint.

163
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,998
We have no time to
hear your explanation

164
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:46,183
You do not deserve to be here.

165
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,868
From my first day here,
I told you sir.

166
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:51,238
I'm not worth it here.
Send me to the border.

167
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,692
But nobody is
hear my request.

168
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:58,693
Did you hear that?

169
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,118
Borders?

170
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:05,221
If Surya is a soldier available
Defend the country, I'm willing to send you.

171
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:07,889
But if I send you,
you are the one who will start the war.

172
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:12,330
Not surprisingly you are
which started a third world war.

173
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:15,746
If your dream is to go to the border.

174
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:19,668
Forget it. Because it's not
will happen in your life.

175
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:23,618
Because you've been
beyond that border, Surya.

176
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:27,372
Because kill the suspect below
military detainee without instructions.

177
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:29,007
You did not
can be controlled, Surya.

178
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,238
Out of control is meaningful ..

179
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,458
Out of the army.

180
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:35,268
Tuan.

181
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,078
You're no longer a military officer.

182
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:38,248
You are fired.

183
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:39,498
Sir, sir, for a moment.

184
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,108
Indian Army Gate
is closed for you.

185
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:42,188
I can explain, sir.

186
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:43,788
Shut up !!

187
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,838
You know your ability, Surya?

188
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:57,968
You can be a great soldier.

189
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,464
Now go out.

190
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,968
We hit you up
the commander of the Colonel.

191
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,556
Do not keep it
all this in the heart.

192
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,188
We just run the instructions.

193
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,345
Why are you doing it?
Your job is so honest?

194
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,588
Go.

195
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:09,410
Mak ..

196
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:12,614
Mak ..!

197
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:14,838
You do not mind?

198
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:17,078
- Dad (Dad Lift)
- You still do not change?

199
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:20,563
The Colonel instructed you to come out,
dare to kick the door firmly.

200
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,784
He's the Colonel!

201
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,336
Actually all my mistakes.

202
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,891
10 years ago I was
 see you at the curb ..

203
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:32,560
I suppose you like
your own child and make you a soldier.

204
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,652
That's my fault
the biggest.

205
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:36,938
Wake wake. Let's go.

206
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,678
Why sit back, let's go.

207
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,028
Where?

208
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,708
Where are you?

209
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,568
You still do not know?

210
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,238
You've been removed from
military troops.

211
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:54,288
Now you are like me,
only ordinary soldiers.

212
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:55,788
Let's go.

213
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:57,048
Dismissed?

214
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:00,648
How much can they get rid of
me? Can they do it right?

215
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,238
If they throw me off,
I still do not want to go.

216
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,791
- Do not want to go?
- No, do not want to.

217
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:09,988
- You behave like slaves.
- I do not want to go.

218
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:14,558
If you continue this way
in a few days you will die.

219
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:18,328
Let me die, dad.

220
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:21,438
But not here.

221
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,317
I will die at the border.

222
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,977
Borders, borders, borders.
What's in there?

223
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:31,758
What is there?

224
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:37,168
I do not know what the response is
You're against India, dad.

225
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,948
But to me, India is my home.

226
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:46,448
Alone maintaining
border.

227
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:51,448
Billions of people will be brave
because I'm on the border.

228
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,758
They will sleep so much.

229
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:58,980
Not enough feeling
I'm that, dad?

230
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,468
So say, why
I need to go to the border.

231
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,715
Yesterday, Hanumanta's father died.

232
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:12,278
After the war on the border.

233
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,960
Everyone is sad,
and I was crying too.

234
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:19,748
Everyone was crying
because of his death.

235
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:26,292
I'm just wondering why
I'm not in his father's place.

236
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:30,428
He is very beautiful, dad.

237
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:33,968
That's my dream.

238
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:39,508
What else is a soldier?
need more than that all.

239
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:44,771
This is the problem.

240
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,458
How big is your dream,
so is the magnitude of your weakness.

241
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:52,318
- Really?
- Yes.

242
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:56,621
I will change.

243
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:58,468
I will change.

244
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,338
That's what you said first.

245
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:02,958
- Really?
- Yes.

246
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:05,394
This is the last time.

247
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,458
Oath to father.

248
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:07,708
Oath to father.

249
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:09,507
Oath to father.

250
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,358
Move your hands
from my head first.

251
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,068
Maybe not the last one for
You, but it's the last one for me.

252
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,533
Oath to you!

253
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:25,218
Colonel, Surya there's a weakness, sir.

254
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:29,332
But he has the advantage
as a soldier.

255
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:33,324
He's good at controlling
all the problems.

256
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:37,492
He can be the leader.

257
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:41,768
I'm not sure.

258
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:47,668
Sir, he is a shooter
best and reliable

259
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:52,718
That I know.

260
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,143
But I'm still not sure.

261
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,898
Sir, more than that.

262
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:03,404
He loves the country very much.

263
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:05,712
And he's willing to die for it.

264
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,570
- Soldier.
- Yes sir.

265
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:13,578
Are you willing to die because
defend the homeland?

266
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:17,617
- Sir, I'm ready to receive instructions!
- Thank you.

267
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:24,341
I know you do not exist
better reason than this.

268
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:27,798
Good day, sir.

269
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:29,692
Yes sir.

270
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,764
It's great to chat with you.

271
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:39,868
Tuan.

272
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:45,088
We always give you a chance
Pakistan to change.

273
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:48,658
Surya urang man.

274
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:51,978
Last chance, sir.

275
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,718
Last chance.

276
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,853
- I'm sure.
- Thank you sir.

277
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:04,918
But with one condition.

278
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:19,394
When did Colonel want me to report?

279
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:23,038
Forget it.

280
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:26,648
99% you will not have a chance.

281
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:27,818
1% is there?

282
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,678
My appeal did not work this time.

283
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,248
Colonel Kenken asked for a signature.

284
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:35,798
Well we go and
get it. Who?

285
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,468
You can not.
 Forget it.

286
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,998
Dad, do not act anymore.

287
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:45,800
Who? Chief Minister?

288
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:48,976
Prime Minister?

289
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,848
If PM is okay,
because before this PM Modi ..

290
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,135
..have fun with the assignment
I was when he was here.

291
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:55,190
If he is, it's easy.

292
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,262
I can find him alone.

293
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:59,920
CM. PM.
Not both of them.

294
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,306
He's an ordinary person.

295
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:07,599
Professor of Psychology
number one in india.

296
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:14,560
One of the three
best in the country.

297
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,089
Head of Psychology.

298
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,224
Dean of UPFL.

299
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:25,840
University of Psychology and Foreign Languages.

300
00:30:28,088 --> 00:30:31,398
Many figures
got his signature ..

301
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:34,798
..and served as a
important people in the country.

302
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:39,424
He could easily read
one's thinking, from face to face.

303
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:42,198
Her name is ..

304
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:44,568
Professor Rama Krishnam Raju.

305
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:07,397
You remember no longer, he's a father
which you have removed 10 years ago.

306
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:10,468
Easy conditions.

307
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:14,915
Your progress report
need to be signed by him.

308
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:17,731
In conclusion, you need
your father's signature ..

309
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:20,286
For you to go back to your post ..

310
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:23,085
And continue to be placed at the border.

311
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:26,517
One signature only.

312
00:31:27,838 --> 00:31:30,198
And your dreams will come true.

313
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,748
It might be easier to
get signature PM Modi ..

314
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:40,066
But it's hard to get you
your father's signature.

315
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:07,977
He said the master was his father.
So this is a confirmation.

316
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:23,278
Dad remembered to sign
your report book.

317
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:26,828
But I did not think it
it is in the police station.

318
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:30,698
I'm shy to look at you
your face again.

319
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:53,378
Fights and anger
at this age is not good.

320
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,504
Everyone finds father
if they have problems.

321
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,348
How much do you have if you have a problem?

322
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,269
Dad did not think that dad
Learn this way.

323
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:06,498
Not educating dad,
but i am great.

324
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:11,232
Actually I want to know, my dad
as what? Grass in the lawn or dog?

325
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:31,515
Not me alone, anyone
will do this in my place.

326
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:34,648
Listen here, anyone can
act like that.

327
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:37,198
But the son of Krishnam Rama did not
can do that.

328
00:33:37,828 --> 00:33:40,668
Oh, so the problem is because
son of dad behave like that?

329
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:42,008
Yes.

330
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:45,715
Okay. I understand.
So suppose my father had no children.

331
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:47,591
Suppose the father has no children.

332
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,600
I will go.
I'll get out of here.

333
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,638
I will not look in the face
father of my life again.

334
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:59,140
I want to see you
Professor Rama Krishnam.

335
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:00,688
- Are you a soldier Surya?
- Yes.

336
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:02,028
Major Kishore.

337
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:04,710
Why, is it because I'm Major?

338
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:06,670
Serious joke.

339
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:49,620
Get in.

340
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:51,468
Thank you.

341
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:55,168
Sit down.

342
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:05,028
Hello

343
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:07,278
Hello

344
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:15,302
You want me to call
what are you

345
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:16,486
Surya.

346
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:19,995
How about you?

347
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:23,470
Everyone calls me sir.

348
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:25,425
- Sir.
- Sir.

349
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:26,480
Good.

350
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,210
So, come back
on our business.

351
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:32,686
Tell me about
yourself.

352
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:36,961
I mean,
who are you.

353
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:38,685
I am a soldier.

354
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:43,434
I asked who you are,
Do not ask your job.

355
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:46,710
I asked who you are.

356
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:51,347
Now tell me.
Who are you?

357
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:52,538
I am a soldier.

358
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,843
In others, who are you,
who are you different?

359
00:35:58,078 --> 00:35:59,496
But to me both are the same.

360
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:03,189
Surya is a soldier.

361
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:05,304
On you Surya is a soldier.

362
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:09,115
But in society
Surya is anger.

363
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:12,671
So as a change,
what we said about Surya.

364
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:15,537
Now tell,
who are you

365
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:18,677
Tuan.

366
00:36:19,558 --> 00:36:21,283
Sir, I just need to
your signature.

367
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,657
If you want to answer me,
First I have to understand your questions.

368
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:28,061
From who you are, who you are,
Ask a simpler question.

369
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:30,328
I will try to answer as much as possible.

370
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:35,620
Well, Mr. Surya.
Time is up.

371
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,326
- Sir?
- We're talking tomorrow.

372
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,002
At 11 o'clock in the morning.

373
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:41,578
If you can ask now
and signature ...

374
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:43,595
Listen.

375
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,632
It's time for family. I do not want
compromise for any case.

376
00:36:49,388 --> 00:36:52,356
11:00 am right.

377
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,928
What he did best
about the case?

378
00:37:01,248 --> 00:37:03,545
He remembered me by that chicken
caught in a prostitute?

379
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:07,448
Ask the right questions,
and a signature where it should be.

380
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:08,938
I can go back tonight too.

381
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,458
You mean, see him early in the morning,
get her signature ..

382
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,062
..whether and move from
here at night?

383
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:17,388
That's a joke, Major?

384
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:19,027
I've been waiting for a year.

385
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:22,778
And I still hope.

386
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,731
You mean you're not his personal assistant?

387
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,188
PO.
Passport officer.

388
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:31,105
I used to be the signature
at all that's in need.

389
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,931
But now I'm the one
he got his signature.

390
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,263
Know how hard it is?

391
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:39,132
I see him every day.

392
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:41,321
Look.

393
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,475
I'm not feeling well, Kishore

394
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:08,931
Where do you get the berry?

395
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:12,848
If you do, there's a shop
Blue Mirror is there.

396
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:13,878
What we said to the bar first.

397
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,938
Thinking where to get it
best berriesi.

398
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:36,550
Where do you want to run?

399
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:42,548
Do you all see?

400
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:45,549
Go on!

401
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,920
Oh god.
Good luck safe.

402
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:59,166
Yes. Good luck he is safe.

403
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:03,611
Hey, you know who he is?
He's the Challa kid.

404
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,211
Challa, who is it?

405
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:32,518
Serve for me too.

406
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:36,208
Serve.

407
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:47,666
What's the problem now?
Is the land problem?

408
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:50,558
The land belongs to you.
It's your business, PC.

409
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:52,438
And it is not wrong.

410
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,508
But then you're there
Say something to my kid.

411
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,364
Challa tu orang apa?

412
00:39:57,558 --> 00:40:00,716
He lives because people are afraid of him.

413
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:02,844
But no one
who are afraid of it here.

414
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:03,488
Go.

415
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,774
You've dropped my ego and my face, PC.

416
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:10,828
My courage is because of myself.
My courage is also because of me.

417
00:40:12,428 --> 00:40:14,422
That's why I'm brave
come alone.

418
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:20,308
My dad always said no
too much ego.

419
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:22,342
Fear of death
 will fly.

420
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:21,858
This food is very good.

421
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,958
After eating if
 I do not sleep for a moment ..

422
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,001
I can not move back.

423
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,108
Brother does not include ego. Please.

424
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:03,078
Okay, this is for recording the report.

425
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:08,105
Well, how's the relationship
you with your family?

426
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,858
We've been separated for 10 years, sir.

427
00:42:13,178 --> 00:42:14,081
Why?

428
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,208
My dad and me
not so good.

429
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:20,878
That's why I got out of the house.

430
00:42:22,238 --> 00:42:23,593
Have a friend?

431
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,074
Friend.

432
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:29,128
Surya, he's our friend.

433
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,638
Friends or not I can
hit anyone.

434
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:35,098
Hey, just drink it. Put a glass.
Get up. You go!

435
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:36,128
Get out.

436
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:41,188
Cis! Wrinkled glasses too.

437
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:45,838
Girlfriend?

438
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:47,836
Sir?

439
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,200
Who's Joty?

440
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:54,348
He only..

441
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:55,472
What is it?

442
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:56,598
Happiness ...

443
00:42:57,938 --> 00:43:01,165
Actually, it's just
the attraction then.

444
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:04,142
Sapna.

445
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:07,518
No sir, that's all
during the camp.

446
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,128
Who is Varsha?

447
00:43:13,398 --> 00:43:14,798
A girl who ..

448
00:43:15,788 --> 00:43:17,478
..i love full heart, sir.

449
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:22,800
Actually it is a relationship
very beautiful love, sir.

450
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:24,613
I want to hear
story about it.

451
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:30,542
I do not think that's good
telling me about my love story.

452
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,898
I do not feel shy about the story
You are so romantic anyway.

453
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:35,138
If love must have a fight.

454
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,571
That's right.

455
00:43:39,128 --> 00:43:40,914
My love story.

456
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:43,478
Start with a fight.

457
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:03,202
Friend, I stretched out a hand
to help you.

458
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:05,680
One hand given is
to help others.

459
00:44:06,738 --> 00:44:08,863
And one hand for
upholding the national flag.

460
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:12,430
Not for
touching women.

461
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,208
Apologize.

462
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:18,775
Sorry brother.

463
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:27,398
It's for you.

464
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:30,758
This uncle is Surya.

465
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:31,438
Hello

466
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,006
Do not you?

467
00:49:33,128 --> 00:49:34,477
My boyfriend, uncle.

468
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:40,157
And I want to marry her.

469
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:44,691
Then, keep it safe
food for him.

470
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:47,043
Unwilling
want to part with it.

471
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:50,810
If you can not part with it,
go in and bring coffee first.

472
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:52,588
Go.

473
00:49:52,748 --> 00:49:55,258
Can connect last post
You brought out coffee.

474
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:56,438
Go.

475
00:49:57,548 --> 00:49:58,938
Come here, sit down.

476
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:05,438
My nephew's just a month
 come here for a holiday.

477
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:07,048
You are clever enough to fasten it.

478
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:09,896
Not my uncle, I'm charming
Varsha for 10 days.

479
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:14,995
Is that a guitar?

480
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:16,038
Aunt very clever.

481
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,008
Aunt really fast.

482
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:21,754
Save my speed first.
But you slow down your speed.

483
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,278
Do not cross the border.

484
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,428
Borders.

485
00:50:28,628 --> 00:50:29,628
I do not know.

486
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:34,128
I am always looking forward when
I will step foot on the border.

487
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:35,348
Youngsters..

488
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,018
Do not stop me.

489
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:42,170
I was a breeze. Actually
 24 hours is just what I think.

490
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:44,397
My goal is
to the border.

491
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:46,058
Is there a goal like this?

492
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:49,077
Huh! What do you think?

493
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:50,429
I do not mean anything.

494
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:52,248
You know the situation on the border?

495
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:53,068
I do not know.

496
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:55,551
Blood boils.

497
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,243
- Ever seen borders?
- Never.

498
00:50:58,938 --> 00:51:01,475
Actually, it's hard to go see
border at this age.

499
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,554
If you go see it, it's hard too
for you to stand up.

500
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:08,688
It's very dangerous,
do not try it occasionally.

501
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:09,563
Oh god.

502
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:13,223
Is there coffee or not? Fast
take out. She will continue to drink it.

503
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:20,278
Have you lost your mind? Why
break home?

504
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:21,907
Because I can not
break his head.

505
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:23,568
Why would he have to beat him?

506
00:51:23,608 --> 00:51:26,128
6 months ago he was hit by the head
father in the middle of town.

507
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:36,454
Go!

508
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,108
- Where's Daddy?
- Yes.

509
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,548
But Surya did not even remember dad

510
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:43,729
People who do not usually remember

511
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:45,753
But that was to hit
always remember it.

512
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:50,718
And dad will make him remember
on his father's lifetime.

513
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:53,176
My love story
starts with a fight.

514
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,208
She walks romanticly, sir.

515
00:51:56,088 --> 00:52:00,368
Every day with a song, morning song,
evening song, night song ..

516
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:03,398
Midnight with the song.

517
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:04,881
Apologize.

518
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:07,592
I am not interested
with your song.

519
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:08,572
Tuan.

520
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,174
So why are you separated?

521
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:13,839
We parted because of it
the fool among us.

522
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,378
Why is he here?

523
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,759
What is his relationship with the soldier?

524
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,485
He's a soldier, do not know?

525
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:26,508
Baba, Baba, Baba ..

526
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:33,428
After this no more
the song in your life.

527
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,537
Why are you uncle?

528
00:52:35,038 --> 00:52:37,540
Not as you suppose,
he's a soldier.

529
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,229
- Surya is not a musician.
- What?

530
00:52:40,468 --> 00:52:43,197
I am a soldier,
army is my life.

531
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:46,628
This is just to waste time.

532
00:52:46,908 --> 00:52:48,669
I will come back
serving a week again.

533
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:50,656
Why?

534
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:52,123
Varsha.

535
00:52:53,758 --> 00:52:54,758
Varsha.

536
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:02,248
Can I give a cigarette?

537
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:03,706
No, you can not.

538
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:10,188
I do not know why Varsha
just go away.

539
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:11,876
He did not answer the phone.

540
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,586
He did not reply to the message.

541
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:15,904
Feel like crazy, sir.

542
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:20,142
After a few days, one morning
I open the door. And Varsha appears.

543
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:30,706
- Surya ..
- Do not talk.

544
00:53:31,038 --> 00:53:32,758
Varsha, do not say anything.

545
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:37,218
Surya, I'm sorry.
Please hear, please.

546
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,618
Do not touch me.
Do not hold me.

547
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:40,960
Please listen.

548
00:53:42,348 --> 00:53:44,527
You're a very good one, Surya.

549
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:47,914
I can not
fight with you.

550
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:53,558
Because I love you
is because of your work.

551
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:57,065
I suppose I own
the life I want.

552
00:53:57,938 --> 00:54:02,798
But suddenly you say music is a hobby,
I do not know you're a soldier.

553
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:04,448
I feel very sad.

554
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:07,509
That's why I'm silent.

555
00:54:10,588 --> 00:54:11,634
Crazy right

556
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,415
I can not live without you, Surya.

557
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:22,476
I want you.
At any rate, I want you.

558
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:37,312
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

559
00:54:37,312 --> 00:54:39,788
I really miss you Varsha.

560
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:46,751
- Do not leave me anymore.
- No, it will not happen again.

561
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:52,728
It was 4 days I was in this house.

562
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:54,976
Feel like crazy

563
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,036
I just want to get out.

564
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,515
I want to get ready for a moment.

565
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,728
I'll play the song for you.

566
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:03,988
Surya.
- Yes.

567
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:09,005
You do not want to talk
with my dad?

568
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:10,161
About what?

569
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:11,407
About us.

570
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,118
Okay, we're talking after
I shower and get ready.

571
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:16,668
Actually Surya ..

572
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:19,822
We have to talk now.

573
00:55:21,888 --> 00:55:23,583
- Now?
- Yes.

574
00:55:23,808 --> 00:55:26,757
If we talked with
it is clear then we will feel calm.

575
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:28,068
Clearly?

576
00:55:30,548 --> 00:55:31,548
Explain what?

577
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:35,049
Surya, please understand.

578
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:38,744
Anything ..

579
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:41,762
You're a soldier.

580
00:55:43,168 --> 00:55:45,918
I took the time
long time to receive it.

581
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:47,780
Either my dad will
agree or not.

582
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,400
Hey, stop, stop ..

583
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:52,098
Do you all consider soldiers
is it like a criminal?

584
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:53,478
- Surya do not be angry.
- Shut up!

585
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:56,508
As a soldier
should we explain it to all?

586
00:55:56,638 --> 00:55:58,048
Do not be angry, Surya, please.

587
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:00,201
How angry? I'm not angry.

588
00:56:00,225 --> 00:56:01,989
I asked calmly.
Look at me.

589
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:05,188
If I go ask your dad, I will
explain about soldiers, if you do not agree?

590
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:06,618
Talk first.

591
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:08,443
Move your hands. Move it!

592
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,725
I'll talk to her, if she's
agree, okay. Otherwise, how?

593
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:14,978
- If not what?
- Why do you think so?

594
00:56:15,168 --> 00:56:16,698
Do not want to dance.
Answer my question.

595
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,438
Surya, you hurt me.

596
00:56:18,518 --> 00:56:20,291
- Answer!
- Please, release your hand.

597
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,678
You've got my question first.

598
00:56:22,383 --> 00:56:24,662
Varsha, if it's okay,
 if not what?

599
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,855
- If it's okay?
- Forget me!

600
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:29,121
Forget me.

601
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:32,448
Forget you

602
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:40,239
You need your father's permission
to get married?

603
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,318
Every day into the room,
up on my bed ..

604
00:56:43,428 --> 00:56:45,661
- Surya, stop it.
- Which do not need permission?

605
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:48,293
Do not say that,
keep your speech.

606
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:51,158
If I'm angry,
right. I will not act.

607
00:56:56,468 --> 00:56:58,867
What has happened?

608
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,891
Who told you to go?
Get out!

609
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:03,178
He's my uncle.

610
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:06,658
That I do not care.
This is our personal problem.

611
00:57:07,028 --> 00:57:09,588
You do not have any dignity?

612
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,228
You do not understand?

613
00:57:16,408 --> 00:57:19,699
Surya, you hit me aunt?

614
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:22,138
I've hit a comedian
this is 6 months ago.

615
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:24,068
It's not difficult
I want to hit him again.

616
00:57:24,338 --> 00:57:26,448
So you remember the incident?

617
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:28,328
How can I get it?
forget your face.

618
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:33,109
I came to introduce myself,
but can you ask this guitar?

619
00:57:33,728 --> 00:57:35,068
Stupid question.

620
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:38,758
I guess I'm just like that
 my dad but you hit him.

621
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:40,228
I will not forgive you.

622
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:42,858
As long as you do not prostrate on your feet
My uncle and apologize.

623
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:46,619
I'll just look at your face
if my father accepted it.

624
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:51,848
He's a comedian,
and he's got a brother.

625
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:56,031
So imagine her brother
What kind of comedian?

626
00:57:56,668 --> 00:57:59,528
If for this,
I do not have to bow at their feet.

627
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:01,678
Nevermind.

628
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:03,378
Hey

629
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:07,288
We break up.

630
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,502
That's the reason for separation.

631
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,376
All fights started
by women.

632
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,455
But lastly,
man is also wrong.

633
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:21,109
Be smart, sir.

634
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:23,309
Surya, enough for today.

635
00:58:23,318 --> 00:58:24,618
We'll continue tomorrow.

636
00:58:24,618 --> 00:58:26,542
- At 11 am?
- At 10.30am.

637
00:58:34,738 --> 00:58:36,115
Beautiful jacket.

638
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,422
My former girlfriend
more beautiful.

639
00:58:38,908 --> 00:58:40,609
I miss her very much.

640
00:58:41,198 --> 00:58:45,158
Look at that girl, similar
my ex-girlfriend.

641
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,412
If you remember that, you will
Looks like all the girls like him.

642
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,182
She's just one
which looks like that?

643
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:52,008
Right, Major.

644
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:55,898
Is he real like that?

645
00:59:14,878 --> 00:59:15,878
Hey Kishore!
- Yes.

646
00:59:17,598 --> 00:59:18,858
Hey Kishore, here it is!

647
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:19,788
Surya.

648
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:21,028
Kishore, here.

649
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:22,318
Surya.

650
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:23,818
Hey soldier!

651
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:29,708
Hi

652
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:33,728
Hey ... that's my friend.

653
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:39,118
This is your sandwich.

654
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:42,698
This sandwich ..

655
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:44,504
There is no cheese in it.
Do not worry.

656
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:48,998
I can not believe it.

657
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:50,458
What?

658
00:59:52,108 --> 00:59:56,382
You'll come to talk when
Looks like I'm here. Invite me to eat.

659
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:58,129
You are very good.

660
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:00,011
It's ok.

661
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:06,402
Actually, I was
Looks like you're in the beginning.

662
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:08,160
Really? When?

663
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:10,528
2 minutes before
You see me.

664
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:12,115
<i> Why is he in a hurry? </ i>

665
01:00:12,348 --> 01:00:14,341
Why not call me?

666
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:18,128
Actually, I did
want to call you ..

667
01:00:20,508 --> 01:00:22,308
.. but dignity
prevent me.

668
01:00:22,478 --> 01:00:24,878
We had a big fight before.

669
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,598
so what I want to be
face to face with you.

670
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:29,088
Fear later ..

671
01:00:30,158 --> 01:00:32,788
.. they will assume
 I have no dignity.

672
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:35,278
<i> Do not count the old story. </ i>

673
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:41,339
I mean, it's a fight, up
What is the reason I want to talk to you?

674
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:46,440
- Varsha?
- Do not say anything.

675
01:00:46,558 --> 01:00:48,977
Do I have no self-esteem?

676
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,598
Varsha, I told you accidentally.

677
01:00:52,598 --> 01:00:54,375
You remember me a slut?

678
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:00,578
After seeing you,
I tried to control myself.

679
01:01:00,998 --> 01:01:04,018
But I dislike shame and
come see you.

680
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:07,278
Why? Because I love it.
I care.

681
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:08,265
What?

682
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:13,293
I have a karektor and
finally i'm not you.

683
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,118
That's the day you asked for a break.

684
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,668
This time let me talk.

685
01:01:23,218 --> 01:01:24,218
I do not need it.

686
01:01:25,438 --> 01:01:26,454
We break up

687
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:28,915
When did it break, boy
what's wrong?

688
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:31,536
Varsha, look,
I wear the jacket you give me.

689
01:01:31,698 --> 01:01:33,365
Varsha, I can not
lost you again.

690
01:01:36,058 --> 01:01:37,168
Varsha wait.

691
01:01:37,978 --> 01:01:38,658
Varsha

692
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:40,788
Varsha

693
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:42,143
For a living person
among the people ..

694
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:46,228
.. family, career, best friend, love,
all that needs to be.

695
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:49,513
But in your case,
all of it does not exist.

696
01:05:49,718 --> 01:05:51,281
There are many ..

697
01:05:51,998 --> 01:05:55,099
..december what your problem is,
but can you understand it?

698
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,618
I understand, sir.

699
01:05:57,778 --> 01:06:00,057
- Do you accept it?
- No.

700
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:05,068
I admit that I'm hot in temper
but I do not think it's wrong.

701
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:07,551
Ego ..

702
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:10,996
Your ego is already there
 in the first stage, Surya.

703
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:16,077
If anyone is willing to accept it ..

704
01:06:16,077 --> 01:06:18,757
.. it means that person already
used to his condition.

705
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:22,264
I'm right, I know everything ..

706
01:06:22,264 --> 01:06:25,706
egoism,
my good temperament ..

707
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,149
..and people like you
will be alone.

708
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:34,086
Go, father will not stop.

709
01:06:35,048 --> 01:06:38,304
But you will not achieve anything
if you continue to behave like this.

710
01:06:38,598 --> 01:06:39,598
In fact ..

711
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:42,868
..you will be alone
forever.

712
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:45,858
Hello, pardon me ..

713
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:48,348
- Why are you laughing?
- There's nothing to you.

714
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:51,178
Listen here, Surya.

715
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:54,390
If you do not like it
my words, you can go.

716
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,165
If you do not understand,
ask me.

717
01:06:56,928 --> 01:06:58,265
But do not laugh.

718
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:01,088
All right sir,
you may resume.

719
01:07:01,348 --> 01:07:02,542
No.

720
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:10,132
Tell me why are you laughing?

721
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:14,843
Actually when you speak
so, i think ..

722
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:17,406
.. something and I am laughing because
the same words.

723
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:18,528
What do you think?

724
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,399
Sirs will ask you a lot
and finally sir ..

725
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:24,332
.. touching personal and
my family thing.

726
01:07:24,768 --> 01:07:25,953
What's personal?

727
01:07:25,953 --> 01:07:29,262
Yes or no, you have a question
my relationship with my family?

728
01:07:29,688 --> 01:07:32,528
When you ask, you know
what's the feeling?

729
01:07:32,698 --> 01:07:35,008
Why? You do not know
my relationship with me

730
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:36,118
It's my job.

731
01:07:36,498 --> 01:07:37,521
Help me sir

732
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:41,615
I want to know what your signature is about
with my love and family stories.

733
01:07:41,638 --> 01:07:44,247
Everything is in this file
but why want to ask me?

734
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,837
That's the procedure, Surya.

735
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:47,518
Not a procedure, sir.

736
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,695
Personal satisfaction.

737
01:07:52,108 --> 01:07:56,708
Sir, I'm happy when I'm alone
told me about my failure.

738
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:57,977
You love it.

739
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,908
The reason ..

740
01:08:00,248 --> 01:08:02,706
All this time the master refused
someone in your life.

741
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,978
But I'm the only one
reject me, yes.

742
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,514
And you do not like it.

743
01:08:08,078 --> 01:08:11,097
I do not know why the sender
I'm here to get a signature.

744
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:15,318
You make it a personal excuse
to repay my deeds.

745
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:18,708
You do not think that non-
not and be ego with me.

746
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:20,700
Ego!

747
01:08:21,008 --> 01:08:24,084
What are you talking about?
I'm in the first stage of the ego?

748
01:08:24,228 --> 01:08:27,068
But the master noticed, the ego
are you in the final stage?

749
01:08:27,348 --> 01:08:29,190
After years
we both did not meet.

750
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,878
The other person's father will ask
on his son ..

751
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,838
..speed, not you who, sir.

752
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:39,212
Everyone thinks Prof.
Rama Krishnam ..

753
01:08:39,237 --> 01:08:41,966
Great, talented Psychology
but I do not see anything.

754
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:45,057
I only see
a regular dad.

755
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:52,247
Sir is not nobody,
is just a regular father.

756
01:08:56,718 --> 01:08:58,109
Who are you?

757
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,129
Now I speak
as a father.

758
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:04,704
Who are you for me?

759
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:08,034
Surya, you know?

760
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,177
Since you came out of life
me, same day ..

761
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:15,580
..when you came out of me,
you know why

762
01:09:16,748 --> 01:09:20,249
Because, I never
need you.

763
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,028
Marriage requires
commitment.

764
01:09:24,408 --> 01:09:26,160
But I do not need a child.

765
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:28,318
But it happens.

766
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:32,967
But you're not born so,
you just exist.

767
01:09:34,148 --> 01:09:38,411
If you are the son of Rama Krishnam,
of course you are the same as me.

768
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:40,428
Now you understand not?

769
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:42,704
You are a kid
not needed.

770
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:45,030
Do you understand what I mean?

771
01:09:45,688 --> 01:09:47,828
You exist on this earth ..

772
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:49,783
..not a blessing.

773
01:09:57,658 --> 01:09:59,467
Who sent me?

774
01:10:02,568 --> 01:10:03,728
Who was born

775
01:10:08,418 --> 01:10:10,032
I'm what?

776
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:12,666
Am I asking?

777
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:17,902
If you're freaking out, you're
apply what's right.

778
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:21,083
Read a variety of books, but you do not read
book about pregnancy prevention?

779
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,035
Useless psychology.

780
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:25,659
Surya, you're not
can smoke here.

781
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,688
I can,
and I'll suck too.

782
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,448
I will smoke here.

783
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:35,398
Needless to fix the lives of others,
but you fix your life first.

784
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,018
Crazy psychology!

785
01:10:50,468 --> 01:10:52,878
What are you saying?
Did you say that?

786
01:10:52,938 --> 01:10:55,378
I'm not in your memory?
Mr. lieutenant!

787
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:58,014
I am your life!

788
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,453
You're ashamed to suppose
I'm your son and ..

789
01:11:02,478 --> 01:11:05,042
..you feel your name is scratched and
afraid to admit it.

790
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:07,108
I fear in you.

791
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:11,723
You're ashamed to confess before
Your student I'm your child.

792
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:13,104
I'm embarrassing you.

793
01:11:13,104 --> 01:11:15,588
I was a failure
the biggest in your life.

794
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:18,680
My mom was pregnant with me for 9
months only, but you 're pregnant' ..

795
01:11:18,705 --> 01:11:21,209
..in for 27 years inside
heart to last breath.

796
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,448
You'll just think of me.

797
01:11:24,578 --> 01:11:25,578
You are right.

798
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:28,766
I am

799
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:34,406
And it's time for me
throw it all away.

800
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:41,298

801
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:44,168

Congratulations all students.

803
01:11:57,698 --> 01:11:59,585
Surya ..

804
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:01,538
You all know ..

805
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:06,741
Surya came here to get
my signature as a soldier.

806
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:10,344
What are you all
do not know is ..

807
01:12:11,288 --> 01:12:12,589

809
01:12:19,388 --> 01:12:23,914
She's my son but I'm shy
to admit it.

810
01:12:31,828 --> 01:12:33,143
Are you happy?

811
01:12:34,968 --> 01:12:38,019

Now, have you got it

Unfortunately, I've been
 better than you.

Whether you're trying to fix it
myself or not, ..

And have you ever wondered

01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:23,302
Actually I do not understand you.

01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,283
Press the bell, call all students,
Make my announcement of your child.

827

You have no feelings for me,
I also have no feelings for you.

828
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:33,996

Sir, the only obstacle to
I'm going to the border is my dad.

835
01:13:51,158 --> 01:13:53,419

01:21:02,092 --> 01:21:03,886
From tomorrow, you will
fighting with her.

889
01:21:06,468 --> 01:21:08,280
It's a fight
life, Kishore.

890
01:21:08,628 --> 01:21:11,133
Not with her dad
or my dad.

891
01:21:13,628 --> 01:21:15,213
But with me.

892
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,114
I am my enemy.

893
01:21:20,818 --> 01:21:22,889
Fight with me.

894
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:46,318
What are you talking about?

895
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:50,118
What are you doing fun for?
to call the name Challa?

896
01:21:51,518 --> 01:21:52,948
To do this all
you need him?

897
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:54,850
There is no father.

898
01:21:54,968 --> 01:21:56,600
I can handle it myself.

899
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:04,670
Surya already started
the first day challenge.

900
01:23:28,528 --> 01:23:29,528
Varsha.

901
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:31,008
What is all this?

902
01:23:31,338 --> 01:23:34,378
Shopping. Bracelet. Buddha statue.

903
01:23:34,788 --> 01:23:36,444
That's good. Good for you.

904
01:24:03,558 --> 01:24:05,418
Finally the first day
it's over.

905
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:13,858
What does it feel, soldier?

906
01:24:14,168 --> 01:24:16,587
Feel like a gun without a bullet.

907
01:24:16,587 --> 01:24:18,763
Can only clean
but can not shoot.

908
01:24:20,118 --> 01:24:21,909
Eat unspeakable food.

909
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:23,370
Go to class laugh.

910
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:25,813
Use this object,
I do not understand.

911
01:24:25,868 --> 01:24:27,391
This is your real problem.

912
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,039
You're on the other side,
or even here.

913
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:30,857
You know nothing
the road in the middle?

914
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:34,379
There's a way right or wrong,
where's there a way in the middle?

915
01:24:34,418 --> 01:24:37,705
There is, the street name is that
which we call 'management'.

916
01:24:37,758 --> 01:24:40,375
Often, my boys are
follow that way. Cute right.

917
01:24:42,098 --> 01:24:43,618
Management?

918
01:24:49,473 --> 01:24:50,819
Hey! Close shop!

919
01:24:53,728 --> 01:24:55,327
They started again.

920
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,689
- Who?
- Challa people, let's go back.

921
01:25:03,188 --> 01:25:05,968
Come on, come on!

922
01:25:10,058 --> 01:25:14,669
The Challa people always
troubles others on the road.

923
01:25:14,669 --> 01:25:15,502
Children ..

924
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,044
Emak ..

925
01:25:23,464 --> 01:25:25,673
Debarry only lives 1
months to give birth.

926
01:25:25,673 --> 01:25:28,197
But he's got a sense
sick to give birth.

927
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:31,490
She can not give birth now,
 the risk is very high.

928
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:34,335
Her dad is not here too.

929
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,851
Give us a doctor
injection immediately.

930
01:25:36,851 --> 01:25:39,846
So please do not
buy the medicine now?

931
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:42,738
There was a riot outside.
There is alcohol, not medicine.

932
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:47,904
- I'll bring her medicine.
- Be careful.

933
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:49,748
Hurry up ..

934
01:25:49,968 --> 01:25:51,700
Take care, outside the crowd
Challa people are hanging around.

935
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,285
Danger, soldier!

936
01:26:34,406 --> 01:26:36,975
- How did the riot elsewhere?
- Everything goes well.

937
01:26:36,975 --> 01:26:38,384
Our people
is there a talifon?

938
01:26:39,188 --> 01:26:39,838
Hey

939
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:43,728
Come here.

940
01:26:48,548 --> 01:26:50,438
Who are you? Never
Looks like you're here.

941
01:26:50,588 --> 01:26:51,588
I am a new person.

942
01:26:51,608 --> 01:26:54,248
Now riots happen, you're not
Did you know that you can not go out?

943
01:26:55,188 --> 01:26:56,856
That's why I want to go back.

944
01:26:56,918 --> 01:26:58,234
Go.

945
01:27:02,638 --> 01:27:03,845
Hey

946
01:27:06,928 --> 01:27:08,288
What is that?

947
01:27:11,468 --> 01:27:12,951
What's inside
Your hand

948
01:27:14,928 --> 01:27:16,315
Open your hands!

949
01:27:28,218 --> 01:27:29,516
What is this?

950
01:27:30,608 --> 01:27:33,715
There is anxiety, a woman
 pregnant needs it.

951
01:27:33,868 --> 01:27:36,562
There is a riot here, who
who sells medicine to you

952
01:27:37,988 --> 01:27:40,688
No one
sell, I take it myself.

953
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:43,768
If everyone can take it alone,
why we want to make a riot too?

954
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:57,901
Not dead or not,
riot remains riot.

955
01:27:57,901 --> 01:27:59,760
I'll guess it's up to 10.

956
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:01,780
I do not want to see you again.

957
01:28:01,898 --> 01:28:02,658
1

958
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:04,558
2

959
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:08,438
3

960
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:11,268
I still see you again.

961
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:20,298
Is there no medicine?

962
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:23,669
He wants to bring it, Challa dah
block him and break the bottle of medicine.

963
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:26,518
I said, nobody
which can survive from ..

964
01:28:34,459 --> 01:28:35,726
Thank you.

965
01:28:38,388 --> 01:28:39,715
Where did you get the bottle from?

966
01:28:41,938 --> 01:28:44,925
I think it's better to grab more
just for safety.

967
01:28:49,868 --> 01:28:52,428
What ..? You?
Looks like you're thinking.

968
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:55,973
This is what is called
management.

969
01:28:57,218 --> 01:28:58,298
What kind of management?

970
01:28:58,558 --> 01:29:01,585
One bottle to remove attention,
and one more bottle for injection.

971
01:29:01,698 --> 01:29:03,778
No loss,
no fight.

972
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:05,878
I guarantee you will succeed
can sign.

973
01:29:09,228 --> 01:29:12,268
All right, he just brought it
medication on time.

974
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,912
How did he get the medicine?
despite the riot?

975
01:29:16,098 --> 01:29:20,048
I told him, he brought the medicine,
but what are you asking?

976
01:29:20,798 --> 01:29:23,602
You behave like that
professor at this house, Raj.

977
01:29:26,488 --> 01:29:27,894
I love him.

978
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,894
Invite her to eat here.

979
01:29:34,998 --> 01:29:36,109
No need.

980
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:38,716
He only did little help,
no need to pick up home.

981
01:29:38,716 --> 01:29:41,175
I have cooked with
 Janaki's brother's attitude.

982
01:29:41,469 --> 01:29:43,902
That's why I make it
stock food for him.

983
01:29:46,898 --> 01:29:48,178
Please give her, Raj.

984
01:29:48,638 --> 01:29:49,407
Hello ..

985
01:29:49,407 --> 01:29:51,235
You remember who I am?

986
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:53,594
Why I want to bring food for
the person I'm not familiar with?

987
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:55,518
Then, pick it up
he came home.

988
01:29:55,818 --> 01:29:57,618
Satya, are you weak?

989
01:29:58,538 --> 01:30:01,198
You want to invite or you
Want to bring this food?

990
01:30:24,328 --> 01:30:26,168
He did not
do nothing but ..

991
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:27,863
..out watching
food container.

992
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:29,887
If hungry, eat only.
Who is blocking anyway?

993
01:30:32,758 --> 01:30:34,549
It does not matter, Kishore.

994
01:30:35,303 --> 01:30:37,223
There is another problem somehow.

995
01:30:39,078 --> 01:30:40,406
That's a real mess?

996
01:30:41,688 --> 01:30:45,659
Ban the food
because I buy drugs?

997
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:47,625
Yes.

998
01:30:50,148 --> 01:30:51,440
For you

999
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:54,588
You know?

1000
01:30:55,185 --> 01:30:57,341
I am a willing man
give food to the enemy.

1001
01:30:57,341 --> 01:30:58,417
So do I.

1002
01:30:58,611 --> 01:31:01,010
I am a person
able to eat at enemy home.

1003
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,400
Extremely correct.

1004
01:31:04,998 --> 01:31:07,379
Wash this container and then eat
and send home.

1005
01:31:09,818 --> 01:31:11,736
Congrats, soldier!

1006
01:31:11,736 --> 01:31:14,784
If he brings food today,
 tomorrow he must sign.

1007
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:19,852
I just bring it, sir.

1008
01:31:28,388 --> 01:31:32,588
I remember I finished
Surya problem but the fact is ..

1009
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:36,278
..he still have not faced
with the real problem.

1010
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:38,030
It even if it exists.

1011
01:31:42,938 --> 01:31:45,087
Hey, 'medicine', you?

1012
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:46,490
Good luck you came.

1013
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:50,364
The red car is a problem, so you
take him with caution.

1014
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:53,698
Hey you. Get off the train.

1015
01:31:53,698 --> 01:31:55,527
- Okay sir. Good luck.
- Kishore.

1016
01:31:55,527 --> 01:31:56,653
- Kishore.
- Good luck.

1017
01:31:56,653 --> 01:31:57,881
Get down!

1018
01:31:59,048 --> 01:32:01,050
Brother Challa, the car is ready.

1019
01:32:36,388 --> 01:32:39,098
Hey, get ready.

1020
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:29,813
You know what's most difficult
in this world, Mustapha?

1021
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:34,124
When you have to agree
 with someone else.

1022
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:35,973
No sir ..

1023
01:33:36,248 --> 01:33:41,750
The most difficult is when we are
can not or do not agree, sir.

1024
01:33:43,028 --> 01:33:44,927
The daughter who
already married.

1025
01:33:47,418 --> 01:33:49,894
An aspiring boy
to become a doctor.

1026
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:54,702
Family dependent
You, but you can not walk.

1027
01:33:56,408 --> 01:34:01,376
Only money can keep away
distress is not self-respect.

1028
01:34:01,698 --> 01:34:03,141
Please use this land ..

1029
01:34:04,358 --> 01:34:06,218
..with the best, Mustapha.

1030
01:34:06,218 --> 01:34:08,037
Maybe this is just the land for the lord.

1031
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:10,185
But it's like a mosque for me.

1032
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:14,596
This is the award given
by country for soldiers like me.

1033
01:34:17,478 --> 01:34:19,569
What i sacrifice ..

1034
01:34:19,575 --> 01:34:22,078
..and what i am collecting ..

1035
01:34:22,078 --> 01:34:25,485
..I will remember it
when I stood on this land.

1036
01:34:26,108 --> 01:34:28,206
Please do not ask for help
I sell this land again.

1037
01:34:29,358 --> 01:34:32,764
Mustapha, you do not know about me.

1038
01:34:33,078 --> 01:34:36,052
If I want it,
I'm willing to do anything.

1039
01:34:39,658 --> 01:34:41,304
That's it, sir.

1040
01:34:41,878 --> 01:34:46,872
Now comes four,
previously with 400 people.

1041
01:34:47,608 --> 01:34:50,480
You've said to take this land,

1042
01:34:50,504 --> 01:34:53,025
The gentlemen used to say
 want to take my leg.

1043
01:34:58,218 --> 01:35:00,262
I lost my leg.

1044
01:35:01,258 --> 01:35:04,810
But they can not plunder
even a handful of this land.

1045
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:09,735
I am familiar with war, sir.

1046
01:35:09,735 --> 01:35:11,847
You want to fight with Challa?

1047
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:13,388
Can you stand?

1048
01:35:32,138 --> 01:35:35,271
I once risked
 life before the country before.

1049
01:35:36,138 --> 01:35:38,608
If my house is in trouble ..

1050
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,251
..I believe in the country
and willing to sacrifice a life.

1051
01:35:45,918 --> 01:35:48,708
All this time I remember you only
 stay away from town

1052
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:51,649
But apparently you are far from the community.

1053
01:35:51,908 --> 01:35:55,292
Go anywhere, I will
give you 4 days only.

1054
01:35:55,538 --> 01:35:59,768
If anyone believes in deeds
I'm wrong, I'll let you go.

1055
01:36:03,108 --> 01:36:05,327
I heard you're a former driver
Subash Chandra Bose.

1056
01:36:06,528 --> 01:36:10,309
Your son's car is not moving
Smooth, please teach him a little.

1057
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,951
Father and son?

1058
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,810
Young people, what grandpa
and your dad say ..

1059
01:36:18,835 --> 01:36:21,246
... about India,
everything is not true.

1060
01:36:21,298 --> 01:36:25,615
India depends on
people like me.

1061
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:28,683
Do not listen to them,
you will be gone soon.

1062
01:36:31,588 --> 01:36:33,355
You're too poisonous.

1063
01:36:36,088 --> 01:36:37,968
Hey, ready!

1064
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:53,522
Kishore, Kishore!
Where are you?

1065
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:54,928
What happened to Surya?

1066
01:36:55,358 --> 01:36:58,948
Challa ride my car and I'll take it
she even places a dog like today.

1067
01:36:59,068 --> 01:37:00,352
What are you doing now?

1068
01:37:01,428 --> 01:37:03,314
Kishore, he sat next to him
I, he runs ..

1069
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:05,117
business, fraud,
threats and everything.

1070
01:37:05,128 --> 01:37:07,795
Let it be, is he
ask you to help him

1071
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:10,298
- Did he tell you to bluff anyone?
- Do not have!

1072
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:11,654
So why are you worried about it?

1073
01:37:12,798 --> 01:37:15,740
How much do I worry about?
She made it all beside me!

1074
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,627
That's his business. Well done
our business here. Then let's drink.

1075
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,356
- Drink?
- Yes.

1076
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:24,368
Kishore, you do not understand the pressure on
in my brain head now.

1077
01:37:24,508 --> 01:37:25,796
What pressure?

1078
01:37:25,796 --> 01:37:28,644
You remember you're alone
who is depressed? No one else?

1079
01:37:28,828 --> 01:37:31,457
Everyone in this country
 can feel stressed.

1080
01:37:31,481 --> 01:37:33,047
That's why there is wine.

1081
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:35,515
Drink .. drink!
- No.

1082
01:37:38,858 --> 01:37:43,514
Now, take your drink
your feelings and your stress.

1083
01:37:43,688 --> 01:37:47,237
The next morning you wake up your mind will
fresh and think management only.

1084
01:37:47,578 --> 01:37:50,329
You're noisy.
Are you so special?

1085
01:37:53,328 --> 01:37:55,266
Soldier, you're an ordinary person.

1086
01:37:57,368 --> 01:38:00,753
- You do not understand Kishore.
- You want to go to the border or not?

1087
01:38:02,048 --> 01:38:06,065
Many people like Challa will exist
everywhere, when you go.

1088
01:38:06,065 --> 01:38:09,563
- But Challa got my car.
- He's up, you're not telling me.

1089
01:38:09,563 --> 01:38:11,258
Drink, drink ..

1090
01:38:22,888 --> 01:38:25,388
- Good morning, soldier.
- Good morning, Major.

1091
01:38:25,978 --> 01:38:26,978
How do you feel?

1092
01:38:27,648 --> 01:38:30,381
Actually last night
I'm too emotional.

1093
01:38:30,478 --> 01:38:31,678
That's a great development.

1094
01:38:32,108 --> 01:38:37,198
Challa's car broke down, he asked for help,
I share him over. That's all.

1095
01:38:37,518 --> 01:38:39,398
Welcome to the club!

1096
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:41,686
Now I understand something about Kishore.
.

1097
01:38:41,686 --> 01:38:44,828
We have to accept this life as it is.

1098
01:38:45,608 --> 01:38:47,221
- Are we special?
- No.

1099
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:48,127
That is why..

1100
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:50,669
..I want to see you daddy
Varsha right now.

1101
01:38:50,669 --> 01:38:53,308
- If anything happens then
- There are two more bottles in storage.

1102
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:55,963
- That's a good development, Major.
- Thank you.

1103
01:38:56,888 --> 01:38:58,547
If every day there is
problem, i already exist ..

1104
01:38:58,572 --> 01:39:00,192
..long to finish it
every night.

1105
01:39:00,888 --> 01:39:02,474
A stunning Indian.

1106
01:39:13,628 --> 01:39:17,578
Hey, medicines. Very poor brother
love your car.

1107
01:39:18,128 --> 01:39:21,077
So I want to take it.
You're riding a motorcycle.

1108
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,735
You will complain in
Karghil every time ..

1109
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,176
..there is a problem. I'm not
is there any other work?

1110
01:42:09,518 --> 01:42:11,283
I advise you as
a Muslim.

1111
01:42:13,418 --> 01:42:17,658
I did not come here as
Muslims, but as ordinary people.

1112
01:42:18,478 --> 01:42:19,478
You will not change.

1113
01:42:24,748 --> 01:42:28,258
Challa is not an arbitrary person,
better you just sell your land.

1114
01:42:31,288 --> 01:42:34,058
Sir as a policeman did not want to
helping pensioners like me.

1115
01:42:34,588 --> 01:42:37,049
Why are you talking about soldiers?
red. I want to tell ..

1116
01:42:37,074 --> 01:42:39,302
..would you go in soldiers? You are so
soldiers because you're interested.

1117
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:41,340
You're talking like you
sorang yang pergi ..

1118
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:42,782
..great and community
live because of you.

1119
01:42:43,128 --> 01:42:47,008
If it's a fight, the police are fighting
every day, we go every morning.

1120
01:42:47,568 --> 01:42:50,598
Go and take it back
your medal.

1121
01:43:26,148 --> 01:43:29,128
One time he was an officer
but now he's a traitor to the country.

1122
01:43:29,888 --> 01:43:33,671
A retired army,
Mustapha suicide ..

1123
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:38,350
.. after knowing
his betrayal is uncovered.

1124
01:43:53,368 --> 01:43:54,708
- Oh you.
- Hey Medicines ..

1125
01:43:55,168 --> 01:43:56,782
- How are you?
- Healthy.

1126
01:43:57,918 --> 01:44:01,728
He's a brother of Challa, he's
will stay here for 2 days.

1127
01:44:02,008 --> 01:44:03,008
Please keep him all right.

1128
01:44:03,068 --> 01:44:04,068
Think of your own home.

1129
01:44:04,298 --> 01:44:05,978
- No drinks?
- Yeah, there's a beer.

1130
01:44:06,228 --> 01:44:08,068
Do not want a beer, Brandy is there?

1131
01:44:08,098 --> 01:44:09,698
Brandi does not exist ..

1132
01:44:10,038 --> 01:44:11,038
Buy it.

1133
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:13,218
Okay. Give me 5 minutes.

1134
01:44:30,148 --> 01:44:33,068
- Did you buy beriani?
- You did not order anything.

1135
01:44:33,218 --> 01:44:35,248
What do you mean?
Buy it!

1136
01:44:36,468 --> 01:44:37,468
Two minutes.

1137
01:44:54,398 --> 01:44:57,218
I can not sleep if I do not
friend, so he's my friend.

1138
01:44:57,218 --> 01:44:58,437
Wait outside an hour.

1139
01:44:58,437 --> 01:44:59,829
See what else,
close the door.

1140
01:45:32,008 --> 01:45:33,008
Anwar ..

1141
01:45:34,018 --> 01:45:35,488
Anwar, what are you doing?

1142
01:45:35,718 --> 01:45:38,111
My father is gone. Mak nak
what's going on with all these medals?

1143
01:45:38,111 --> 01:45:39,191
Just throw it away!

1144
01:45:39,191 --> 01:45:43,481
Anwar, it's not an ordinary medal.
That's a sign of your father's warning.

1145
01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:45,806
- He..
- Silence. Enough! Shut up!

1146
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:48,331
Grandpa ruined my dad.

1147
01:45:48,358 --> 01:45:50,775
And my dad broke me!

1148
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:53,137
See what happened?
He's dead!

1149
01:45:55,638 --> 01:45:59,388
My father used to be an officer now
is considered a traitor!

1150
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:04,532
Mom, my father did not have to worry about it
because this country will help us.

1151
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:07,288
But our father's body
 not honored.

1152
01:46:09,508 --> 01:46:13,468
One day, this country
will know the truth.

1153
01:46:13,748 --> 01:46:19,090
There's no soil there. Challa
will get it later too.

1154
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:26,828
You will not understand,
because you are angry.

1155
01:46:26,848 --> 01:46:29,778
Do not understand a grandfather
how are we doing?

1156
01:46:30,138 --> 01:46:32,786
This country does not care about us.

1157
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:40,808
Again you say
so, be prepared.

1158
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,958
Not once would I say,
this is not my homeland!

1159
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:51,524
Enough so far
that pride!

1160
01:46:52,138 --> 01:46:54,838
I'll show you a way out,
and I will go from here!

1161
01:47:15,218 --> 01:47:19,598
<i> His mother sent food
because Surya helped him. </ i>

1162
01:47:20,798 --> 01:47:25,695
<i> So now I help Surya
to get his / her mother back. </ i>

1163
01:47:33,838 --> 01:47:35,315
What did you say?

1164
01:47:35,498 --> 01:47:36,783
Your son will come.

1165
01:47:37,638 --> 01:47:39,231
What? Will he come here?

1166
01:47:42,128 --> 01:47:43,535
Do you know

1167
01:47:46,038 --> 01:47:47,038
How much does it look like?

1168
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,186
Your son, you think
how it looks

1169
01:49:34,638 --> 01:49:35,638
Emak.

1170
01:49:41,868 --> 01:49:42,868
Emak.

1171
01:49:50,038 --> 01:49:53,395
Not one, not two ..

1172
01:49:54,738 --> 01:49:56,224
But 20 years ..

1173
01:49:57,358 --> 01:49:59,206
Mom would not ask
 why are you running

1174
01:49:59,648 --> 01:50:00,922
I will not ask.

1175
01:50:01,808 --> 01:50:04,511
But why are you
do not tell mum

1176
01:50:05,598 --> 01:50:09,424
Your problems and your dad,
what is the relationship with mama

1177
01:50:12,098 --> 01:50:16,853
During this time you are in front of a mak,
but you can not say anything.

1178
01:50:18,198 --> 01:50:20,737
How are you and your dad
can you survive?

1179
01:50:23,713 --> 01:50:25,849
The men are
always great.

1180
01:50:26,188 --> 01:50:27,258
Mom, please.

1181
01:50:27,698 --> 01:50:29,721
Do not touch mom.

1182
01:50:31,348 --> 01:50:33,283
Never once did the phone call ..

1183
01:50:33,283 --> 01:50:37,418
.. to tell your mom that you are healthy.
- Mak, please.

1184
01:50:40,494 --> 01:50:42,735
Do not you remember me?

1185
01:50:42,735 --> 01:50:45,638
Mother please.
Not like that, man.

1186
01:50:45,638 --> 01:50:48,226
Go! Go! Go!

1187
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:52,900
Do not go back anymore.
Do not go back. Do not go back ...

1188
01:51:13,888 --> 01:51:15,649
<i> When this challenge starts .. </ i>

1189
01:51:15,649 --> 01:51:19,474
<i> .. I remember Surya only
will survive a day. </ i>

1190
01:51:20,098 --> 01:51:23,775
<i> But now,
just a day away. </ i>

1191
01:51:24,328 --> 01:51:27,148
<i> His dream will be achieved. </ i>

1192
01:55:27,028 --> 01:55:29,281
- Are you by Surya?
- Yes.

1193
01:55:29,328 --> 01:55:31,400
Our ACP wants to see you.

1194
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:47,485
His son Mustapha, died last week
at the MRW shopping center.

1195
01:55:48,248 --> 01:55:50,908
During the investigation, we found out
CCTV recording has been deleted

1196
01:55:51,228 --> 01:55:53,414
But we see you
on another camera recording.

1197
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,452
You did not notice anything
that strange happens there?

1198
01:56:04,288 --> 01:56:06,138
- No.
- Youngsters..

1199
01:56:10,328 --> 01:56:13,809
They killed my son,
but they said he committed suicide.

1200
01:56:13,809 --> 01:56:17,065
You are just one
evidence I have.

1201
01:56:17,518 --> 01:56:19,108
Please remember to go back ..

1202
01:56:22,598 --> 01:56:26,918
There is no one there,
Challa or her child?

1203
01:56:32,638 --> 01:56:34,995
- No, no ..
- Try remembering again.

1204
01:56:34,995 --> 01:56:36,845
Grandpa, he did not remember.

1205
01:56:37,898 --> 01:56:41,384
He's not like anybody else, when it seems
but lie and say no.

1206
01:56:43,638 --> 01:56:44,828
I know very much with him.

1207
01:56:47,548 --> 01:56:49,218
- Ramesh.
- Sir!

1208
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:51,328
You too.

1209
01:56:53,088 --> 01:56:56,173
You do not remember, I always have a story
someone important in my life.

1210
01:56:56,173 --> 01:56:58,083
Yes sir. Surya Soldiers.

1211
01:56:59,668 --> 01:57:00,668
He is the person.

1212
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:05,756
He is my inspiration
with its karektornya.

1213
01:57:07,598 --> 01:57:10,304
You remember again. 2 years
last time during training in ..

1214
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:12,932
..Delhi, our group is there
session with you there.

1215
01:57:18,078 --> 01:57:20,470
There are all the stories about
dream of each ..

1216
01:57:20,824 --> 01:57:24,951
.. but only masters are telling stories
about the meaning of dreams.

1217
01:57:24,998 --> 01:57:25,858
Dreams!

1218
01:57:26,778 --> 01:57:28,378
Everyone has a dream.

1219
01:57:29,328 --> 01:57:32,498
One day it will be achieved but ..

1220
01:57:32,948 --> 01:57:37,465
Are you still the same person
as before when your dreams come true?

1221
01:57:39,178 --> 01:57:41,193
Is it satisfying enough?

1222
01:57:42,448 --> 01:57:45,663
When your dreams come true,
and you got back ..

1223
01:57:46,178 --> 01:57:51,733
..you will only see the trip
your life, not the previous character.

1224
01:57:53,328 --> 01:57:57,777
When you forget your karektor
Just like you're dead.

1225
01:57:59,408 --> 01:58:02,089
Die before dying.

1226
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:24,284
Although there are many
work pressure,

1227
01:58:24,309 --> 01:58:26,395
..I never change
my master is master.

1228
01:58:29,033 --> 01:58:30,517
No compromise.

1229
01:58:32,918 --> 01:58:35,911
Sir, one picture ..?

1230
01:58:37,182 --> 01:58:38,962
Yes of course.

1231
01:58:42,378 --> 01:58:43,958
Sir, smile a little, sir.

1232
01:59:50,328 --> 01:59:51,670
You?

1233
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:55,393
This is a small world.

1234
01:59:55,393 --> 01:59:56,820
Soldiers ..!

1235
01:59:57,981 --> 02:00:00,625
I had just known about you recently.

1236
02:00:00,649 --> 02:00:03,082
I'm really angry with you.

1237
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:17,931
Situation does not permit.

1238
02:00:19,337 --> 02:00:21,636
On you are important for
You go to the border.

1239
02:00:22,166 --> 02:00:25,529
To me, it is important for me
Get my job done smoothly.

1240
02:00:25,908 --> 02:00:28,420
All right, I'll forget it.

1241
02:00:30,292 --> 02:00:31,994
And you have to forget all this.

1242
02:00:33,368 --> 02:00:37,298
If you can see it
death on the border ..

1243
02:00:37,688 --> 02:00:40,649
.. you will not be able to
 see death in Wizaq?

1244
02:00:41,198 --> 02:00:42,778
Will you forget or not?

1245
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:46,788
Will you forget or not?

1246
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:50,638
Will you forget or not?

1247
02:00:51,298 --> 02:00:55,886
Show your weaknesses
is your strength. Prove it.

1248
02:00:55,898 --> 02:00:57,278
Will you forget or not?

1249
02:00:58,165 --> 02:00:59,763
Answer it, useless!

1250
02:01:02,528 --> 02:01:03,825
Will you forget or not?

1251
02:01:14,728 --> 02:01:16,097
I'll forget it.

1252
02:01:55,838 --> 02:02:00,587
The students, Alexander have
conquer the world.

1253
02:02:00,848 --> 02:02:04,263
Mahatma Gandhi won without
using force.

1254
02:02:05,608 --> 02:02:09,329
Surya anyway, won
 against yourself.

1255
02:02:16,558 --> 02:02:17,708
You're right, Surya.

1256
02:02:19,958 --> 02:02:21,304
I lost.

1257
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,718
No one can block you
to the border again.

1258
02:02:30,188 --> 02:02:31,558
I will sign it now.

1259
02:02:35,878 --> 02:02:37,304
No sir.

1260
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:39,627
Do not sign.

1261
02:02:41,298 --> 02:02:42,675
I did not win.

1262
02:02:44,468 --> 02:02:47,941
In the process for me to win,
I've broken my own karektor.

1263
02:02:52,727 --> 02:02:54,823
People say I'm not worth it, sir.

1264
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:56,991
But I did not confess it.

1265
02:02:57,395 --> 02:02:59,670
But now I confess
which I did not deserve.

1266
02:03:02,878 --> 02:03:04,753
I'm without a karektor ..

1267
02:03:05,968 --> 02:03:08,238
I'm no longer useful
as a soldier.

1268
02:03:14,968 --> 02:03:16,808
There's a time ..

1269
02:03:18,529 --> 02:03:22,505
I can see
crime is done before the eyes.

1270
02:03:24,788 --> 02:03:26,304
But now..

1271
02:03:27,615 --> 02:03:30,888
I'm afraid to see
myself, sir.

1272
02:03:33,548 --> 02:03:37,540
You always say that
I will be alone.

1273
02:03:37,768 --> 02:03:40,438
But I never felt that way.

1274
02:03:41,348 --> 02:03:43,971
My self is my good friend.

1275
02:03:44,678 --> 02:03:46,820
Myself is my friend.

1276
02:03:47,998 --> 02:03:52,478
Now I have everything,
family, love ..

1277
02:03:53,458 --> 02:03:55,784
..and career is fixed ..

1278
02:03:56,394 --> 02:03:57,759
.. but ..

1279
02:04:00,108 --> 02:04:01,565
Where am I, sir?

1280
02:04:09,448 --> 02:04:13,495
Now, I'm right
loneliness, sir.

1281
02:04:15,288 --> 02:04:20,050
For a long time, good friend
I own ...

1282
02:04:20,649 --> 02:04:22,343
..he was gone.

1283
02:04:23,166 --> 02:04:24,209
Myself..

1284
02:04:25,778 --> 02:04:29,354
He's not in
myself again.

1285
02:04:30,718 --> 02:04:32,722
I'm tale when I'm
lose yourself.

1286
02:04:33,305 --> 02:04:35,150
But I do not care
lose someone else, sir.

1287
02:04:38,028 --> 02:04:39,648
What's my dream, sir?

1288
02:04:40,013 --> 02:04:42,321
I want to go to the border and
save the lives of others.

1289
02:04:42,718 --> 02:04:45,056
Not to step
dead body.

1290
02:04:47,148 --> 02:04:51,527
But I can not
do it here.

1291
02:04:56,408 --> 02:05:00,328
Although there are people fighting
his life in my eyes.

1292
02:05:01,248 --> 02:05:03,324
I can not do anything.

1293
02:05:05,908 --> 02:05:12,558
First time, I think
angry with yourself.

1294
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:14,221
And it burns you.

1295
02:05:17,028 --> 02:05:19,219
Out there, there are people
able to maintain ..

1296
02:05:19,244 --> 02:05:20,782
... the carrier because
my words

1297
02:05:21,938 --> 02:05:26,037
But why am I this way?
And I do not mind!

1298
02:05:27,668 --> 02:05:30,308
I do not want this job.

1299
02:05:39,258 --> 02:05:43,870
No sir. I do not want this job
if I can change who I am!

1300
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:47,026
I do not know whether it is correct or
wrong. But this is my self.

1301
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:48,906
My real self!

1302
02:05:50,678 --> 02:05:52,610
Now I do not think
my dream, but i ..

1303
02:05:52,635 --> 02:05:55,145
.. think how to
get my karektor back.

1304
02:05:55,668 --> 02:05:56,989
I'll get it back, sir.

1305
02:05:57,528 --> 02:06:01,150
Although I died,
I'm still dead with my character.

1306
02:07:15,898 --> 02:07:16,898
Hey soldier.

1307
02:07:18,618 --> 02:07:20,526
Why are you here?

1308
02:07:45,988 --> 02:07:47,564
You want to
how to go to?

1309
02:08:02,808 --> 02:08:03,908
Hey! Hey! Soldiers!

1310
02:08:04,228 --> 02:08:08,209
What? What is hey soldier?

1311
02:08:26,858 --> 02:08:27,858
Do you want to forget

1312
02:08:30,218 --> 02:08:31,958
Can not see the killings in Wizaq ..

1313
02:08:31,958 --> 02:08:36,951
Can not see the killings in Wizaq ..

1314
02:08:41,888 --> 02:08:44,908
Grandpa, yesterday
there's a question i'm asking

1315
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:49,258
I lied then.

1316
02:08:50,898 --> 02:08:51,898
Those who kill.

1317
02:08:53,418 --> 02:08:56,936
They killed him
in front of me, in the morning.

1318
02:08:58,448 --> 02:08:59,767
I see myself.

1319
02:09:02,628 --> 02:09:05,317
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
Very sorry.

1320
02:09:15,328 --> 02:09:17,988
I've made a mistake
did not kill you that day.

1321
02:09:18,018 --> 02:09:19,778
Kill me today. Kill it.

1322
02:09:29,378 --> 02:09:30,938
Kill it!

1323
02:09:33,668 --> 02:09:37,138
He is willing to die for
country at age 70.

1324
02:09:38,668 --> 02:09:40,416
Nothing wrong with her now.

1325
02:09:41,528 --> 02:09:44,314
Kill it. You kill it!

1326
02:09:57,748 --> 02:09:59,469
You can hold a knife
now because of freedom ..

1327
02:09:59,494 --> 02:10:01,012
.. which is fought by
people like them.

1328
02:10:02,158 --> 02:10:03,588
You dare to kill him?

1329
02:10:09,338 --> 02:10:11,654
You're weak?

1330
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:18,158
All controlled.

1331
02:13:19,108 --> 02:13:24,083
From now on, home and people in it
is under the control of Surya soldier.

1332
02:13:29,698 --> 02:13:31,499
Who are you talking about?

1333
02:13:31,499 --> 02:13:34,220
The driving youth
car rental?

1334
02:13:35,388 --> 02:13:36,785
Is that what you see?

1335
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,947
Where is it?

1336
02:14:35,918 --> 02:14:37,380
Mom, I want to
eat the same.

1337
02:14:41,148 --> 02:14:42,148
Serve it.

1338
02:14:43,788 --> 02:14:44,788
Serve it.

1339
02:14:56,188 --> 02:14:59,132
He said nothing,
and I can not believe it.

1340
02:14:59,132 --> 02:15:00,263
I believe.

1341
02:15:01,228 --> 02:15:04,126
You know what will happen
if you hit my man

1342
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:05,468
Not at

1343
02:15:06,148 --> 02:15:07,294
.. but I kill.

1344
02:15:09,488 --> 02:15:12,076
You do not tell me right?

1345
02:15:13,778 --> 02:15:15,065
Kill?

1346
02:15:15,731 --> 02:15:16,716
Why?

1347
02:15:18,218 --> 02:15:19,395
Because I feel angry.

1348
02:15:20,438 --> 02:15:21,895
Why angry?

1349
02:15:22,414 --> 02:15:24,227
Anger is not a special quality.

1350
02:15:25,093 --> 02:15:27,369
Everyone in the world will be angry.

1351
02:15:28,888 --> 02:15:31,658
In India there are 110 billion people.

1352
02:15:32,358 --> 02:15:33,778
Everyone was angry.

1353
02:15:34,148 --> 02:15:35,420
That's right.

1354
02:15:36,558 --> 02:15:41,201
But the anger of 110 billion people
it was felt by a single person. How?

1355
02:16:17,938 --> 02:16:19,778
I put salt on it.

1356
02:16:19,778 --> 02:16:23,047
But I used to eat
salty and spicy.

1357
02:17:32,948 --> 02:17:34,318
Delicious cuisine

1358
02:17:35,878 --> 02:17:38,413
I've never been sleeping for a long time.

1359
02:17:40,518 --> 02:17:42,134
I want to sleep a second here.

1360
02:18:21,428 --> 02:18:23,919
Do not, Challa.
Do not include ego.

1361
02:18:29,108 --> 02:18:31,478
Your son is there
in his custody, Challa.

1362
02:18:34,408 --> 02:18:37,779
Negotiate with him,
not a fight.

1363
02:18:55,498 --> 02:18:56,498
Get up! Get up!

1364
02:18:57,198 --> 02:18:58,338
You're enough to sleep.

1365
02:19:00,168 --> 02:19:01,198
Why are you?

1366
02:19:02,568 --> 02:19:04,053
What do you want?

1367
02:19:08,668 --> 02:19:10,627
All this because of Mustapha's land?

1368
02:19:11,708 --> 02:19:13,564
Just because of 5 acres of land.

1369
02:19:14,518 --> 02:19:17,484
I will stop it.
Including you too.

1370
02:19:19,678 --> 02:19:22,807
I will take care of his family.
You help stop this.

1371
02:19:23,898 --> 02:19:27,375
Apart from the life of Mustapha,
what else do you want

1372
02:19:29,138 --> 02:19:30,685
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1373
02:19:30,685 --> 02:19:33,887
I told you everything.
Why is he still silent?

1374
02:19:36,938 --> 02:19:38,260
What do you want

1375
02:19:40,298 --> 02:19:41,442
India

1376
02:19:57,138 --> 02:19:59,765
I want India.
Give it!

1377
02:20:02,588 --> 02:20:03,955
You do not understand?

1378
02:20:05,788 --> 02:20:08,393
India I have two
different names.

1379
02:20:09,248 --> 02:20:10,784
Anwar

1380
02:20:15,068 --> 02:20:18,289
You remember, you just kill
Mustapha only one.

1381
02:20:19,938 --> 02:20:23,248
But you forgot, murder
the biggest thing you did.

1382
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:28,694
You've got to have a land, and you
has killed India in Anwar.

1383
02:20:28,694 --> 02:20:30,118
This is not my homeland.

1384
02:20:32,248 --> 02:20:34,410
He wants to be a doctor and
serving in this country ..

1385
02:20:34,435 --> 02:20:36,355
.. but he left it.

1386
02:20:40,928 --> 02:20:42,416
Where is Anwar now?

1387
02:20:43,948 --> 02:20:45,316
What does he do now?

1388
02:20:46,558 --> 02:20:49,341
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
What a decision he made.

1389
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:52,152
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
Anyone who knows?

1390
02:20:55,978 --> 02:20:57,886
Every criminal who
choose the wrong way ..

1391
02:20:57,911 --> 02:20:59,862
.. and make mistakes in the country ..

1392
02:20:59,978 --> 02:21:03,892
..and want to destroy the country, I'm as
soldiers were forced to kill them all.

1393
02:21:08,778 --> 02:21:10,309
Very bad!

1394
02:21:11,018 --> 02:21:14,889
But people like you have been destroyed
country, and what do i want to call you?

1395
02:21:19,368 --> 02:21:22,384
Pakistan. Traitor.

1396
02:21:24,858 --> 02:21:26,351
Who is the Paksitan?

1397
02:21:27,118 --> 02:21:28,399
Who is the Paksitan?

1398
02:21:28,828 --> 02:21:29,698
I am an Indian!

1399
02:21:29,828 --> 02:21:31,718
What's the proof?
Where is the proof?

1400
02:21:31,998 --> 02:21:33,551
Proof yes, proof?

1401
02:21:33,898 --> 02:21:39,142
Look at this. Look! Identification card,
ballot cards, bank cards and even passports.

1402
02:21:39,708 --> 02:21:43,888
..and I was born in India. Now
I was standing on the ground of India.

1403
02:21:46,288 --> 02:21:48,253
India is not what it stores
in the pocket.

1404
02:21:49,018 --> 02:21:50,341
But in the heart.

1405
02:21:52,448 --> 02:21:56,727
If you live in India,
not necessarily you Indian.

1406
02:21:57,048 --> 02:22:00,996
Is India in your heart?

1407
02:22:06,048 --> 02:22:07,818
You have 24 hours.

1408
02:22:09,088 --> 02:22:10,972
You're looking for Anwar.

1409
02:22:12,018 --> 02:22:14,368
Where are you looking for?
 That's all I do not care.

1410
02:22:14,768 --> 02:22:19,284
For the first time, your power
will be used for the country.

1411
02:22:22,148 --> 02:22:23,148
You hear it here.

1412
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:28,379
If anything happened to Anwar.

1413
02:22:30,128 --> 02:22:33,076
Your child will receive the consequences.

1414
02:22:41,918 --> 02:22:43,948
Not a traitor,
but the national officer.

1415
02:22:44,158 --> 02:22:47,842
Mustapha did not commit suicide,
but he was killed.

1416
02:22:48,438 --> 02:22:53,550
Interrupted by death
his father, Anwar ran away from home.

1417
02:22:53,578 --> 02:22:56,758
To be responsible for all,
to find Anwar.

1418
02:23:20,458 --> 02:23:23,903
I do not care what you have to do,
facebook, whatsapp. Distribute it.

1419
02:23:23,958 --> 02:23:26,895
I want the news of Anwar's presence.

1420
02:23:31,758 --> 02:23:33,885
The soldier is a man
which protects others ..

1421
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:36,236
..and others are
to protect her child.

1422
02:23:37,928 --> 02:23:43,803
Hundreds of people were killed inside
 bomb incident in Delhi. According to official news.

1423
02:23:44,858 --> 02:23:47,928
Who is responsible?
in this incident?

1424
02:23:50,628 --> 02:23:52,697
What does he do now?

1425
02:23:52,697 --> 02:23:55,555
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
What a decision he made.

1426
02:23:55,555 --> 02:23:58,018
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
Anyone who knows?

1427
02:24:16,198 --> 02:24:20,823
I've been looking around country,
but still no information about Anwar.

1428
02:24:20,823 --> 02:24:23,887
Is Anwar not your family all?

1429
02:24:23,998 --> 02:24:27,243
The whole country is waiting
you, come back.

1430
02:24:31,068 --> 02:24:34,297
You say, this is first
When do you kill people?

1431
02:24:34,498 --> 02:24:38,149
Just kills first.
But many times I have seen it.

1432
02:24:39,068 --> 02:24:40,325
Who am I to kill?

1433
02:25:12,728 --> 02:25:14,046
You..

1434
02:25:14,668 --> 02:25:15,926
Anwar is right?

1435
02:25:59,958 --> 02:26:00,998
Anwar

1436
02:26:03,098 --> 02:26:05,442
Justice will be implemented over
the crime that struck you.

1437
02:26:06,214 --> 02:26:07,806
Offenders will be punished.

1438
02:26:08,918 --> 02:26:10,553
What are your reactions?

1439
02:26:13,758 --> 02:26:15,373
Why do not you say Anwar?

1440
02:26:16,908 --> 02:26:19,065
Hello Anwar.
You do not feel happy?

1441
02:26:19,448 --> 02:26:20,714
No.

1442
02:26:26,848 --> 02:26:28,145
She is not happy.

1443
02:26:28,448 --> 02:26:30,658
Justice is upheld.

1444
02:26:31,048 --> 02:26:33,806
Helps during the incident,
it is called justice.

1445
02:26:33,806 --> 02:26:36,685
But after the devastation took place,
it is called sympathy.

1446
02:26:38,168 --> 02:26:42,507
What we do now also
same. Missed consciousness.

1447
02:26:47,758 --> 02:26:50,405
You all remember Kapil
Win the dev ..

1448
02:26:50,430 --> 02:26:53,279
..cricket fight 30
years ago for India.

1449
02:26:53,898 --> 02:26:59,184
But you all do not remember Mustapha
who fought for you all.

1450
02:27:02,829 --> 02:27:05,438
People like him
we need to keep in mind ..

1451
02:27:05,463 --> 02:27:08,240
.. but we did not keep it
he's even in the brain.

1452
02:27:09,108 --> 02:27:11,779
For that, we are not
just lose Mustapha.

1453
02:27:13,158 --> 02:27:15,223
But Anwar's conviction
against our country as well.

1454
02:27:16,648 --> 02:27:20,262
You're right, Anwar.
I'm with you.

1455
02:27:29,348 --> 02:27:31,178
I used to be hotter
like you, Anwar.

1456
02:27:32,668 --> 02:27:35,644
I was out of the house at the age of 14 years.

1457
02:27:35,828 --> 02:27:37,968
It might have been my journey
such as Abdul Kalam ..

1458
02:27:39,178 --> 02:27:41,553
..or bin Osama bin Laden ..

1459
02:27:42,448 --> 02:27:44,681
.. and maybe more
people like me now.

1460
02:27:49,268 --> 02:27:53,625
Anwar, in life if
 you want to achieve something ..

1461
02:27:53,888 --> 02:27:56,211
..you have to choose.

1462
02:27:57,848 --> 02:27:59,788
Not because
by your situation.

1463
02:28:01,538 --> 02:28:04,165
Because the situation is constantly changing.

1464
02:28:05,106 --> 02:28:08,052
But our character is not
should have changed.

1465
02:28:10,908 --> 02:28:12,620
Yesterday what's your situation, Anwar?

1466
02:28:13,128 --> 02:28:15,745
During the death of your father,
no one comes.

1467
02:28:15,745 --> 02:28:17,184
Today.

1468
02:28:17,184 --> 02:28:18,854
Thousands came because of you.

1469
02:28:18,855 --> 02:28:21,558
It's too late.
It is wrong.

1470
02:28:21,698 --> 02:28:24,189
Even slow, but they are
come also, Anwar.

1471
02:28:28,598 --> 02:28:29,749
Try to tell me.

1472
02:28:30,228 --> 02:28:34,554
In God's command there is only one
light instead of darkness.

1473
02:28:37,628 --> 02:28:41,825
Now, if you think
this is not your homeland ..

1474
02:28:42,718 --> 02:28:44,763
That's your choice.

1475
02:28:52,958 --> 02:28:54,167
Tear it.

1476
02:29:51,888 --> 02:29:53,902
<i> Surya passed the exam, Professor. </ i>

1477
02:29:57,348 --> 02:29:58,521
He failed.

1478
02:29:59,388 --> 02:30:03,092
He can not change his train
and he lost his dreams.

1479
02:30:04,758 --> 02:30:07,559
He made everything to realize
 his dream to the border.

1480
02:30:07,559 --> 02:30:09,062
And he wants to celebrate.

1481
02:30:10,208 --> 02:30:12,808
He saw the passion of love
country of every human being.

1482
02:30:15,148 --> 02:30:17,000
Surya is not my son, sir.

1483
02:30:18,136 --> 02:30:20,886
But I'm proud of it
will say that he is my son.

1484
02:30:23,598 --> 02:30:28,766
The best book I've ever had
read in my life is SURYA.

1485
02:30:35,058 --> 02:30:35,488
Tuan.

1486
02:30:39,358 --> 02:30:41,307
Now Surya where, Professor.

1487
02:30:51,978 --> 02:30:52,814
Hello

1488
02:30:56,668 --> 02:30:57,570
Hello

1489
02:30:59,028 --> 02:31:01,130
There's a blank job in my place.

1490
02:31:01,348 --> 02:31:02,370
Work?

1491
02:31:39,438 --> 02:31:43,091
Sir, but this is ..

1492
02:31:44,528 --> 02:31:45,626
Thank you.

1493
02:31:49,308 --> 02:31:50,627
Thanks dad.

1494
02:31:51,758 --> 02:31:52,858
Thank you.

1495
02:31:58,168 --> 02:32:01,219
I miss my father ..

1496
02:32:02,858 --> 02:32:05,834
Dad also miss you very much ..

1497
02:32:12,558 --> 02:32:16,525
Hey, you always talk about borders.

1498
02:32:17,138 --> 02:32:18,623
How are the conditions at the border?

1499
02:32:29,278 --> 02:32:30,935
Borders.

1500
02:32:35,268 --> 02:32:37,768
While setting up
feet on the border.

1501
02:32:40,298 --> 02:32:44,049
You will be happy no matter
how high it is.

1502
02:32:48,188 --> 02:32:52,108
Your eyes will shrink during
watch it.

1503
02:32:55,248 --> 02:32:59,964
When your heart shouts the name of the country.

1504
02:33:03,008 --> 02:33:07,486
When you arrive at the top
and you look back.

1505
02:33:08,818 --> 02:33:13,592
And there you will only see
the effect of your soles.

1506
02:33:17,098 --> 02:33:18,968
Besides that..

1507
02:33:20,928 --> 02:33:26,388
The music will be heard
first time you hear

1508
02:33:26,788 --> 02:33:32,755
When music is a joy of 110 billion inhabitants
heard because you were there.

1509
02:33:32,779 --> 02:33:34,779
