1
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:08,923
The human who was roaming around
as a nomad and wild inhabitant,

2
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,869
Began to believe in the great
power,'the God'to bind his clan.

3
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,967
Earlier, the human race began
to believe nature as God.

4
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:23,869
Later some idols were created and
worshipped to their convenience.

5
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,181
In that respect,
some centuries ago...

6
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,926
A tributary King who ruled
under the Chola dynasty,

7
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,626
Upon adviced by a great Siddha,

8
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:40,621
By melting the solar particles and
along with gold and panchaloha

9
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:43,919
he made the divine
idol of Lord Murugan.

10
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,461
During the invasion of British,

11
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:51,657
The King buried the idol in the
soil, in order to protect it.

12
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,681
When time passed,

13
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,622
during an excavation,
the idol was taken out again.

14
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:02,141
For the manner it was made
and for it's value

15
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,460
the idol was handed over
to a foreigner for money.

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,219
The concerned officers
who were aware of this,

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,742
recovered the idol
and handed to the museum, safely.

18
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:18,100
The idol of Lord Murugan
which spoke the mythology

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,362
and the past has been stolen again.

20
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:41,819
The Panchaloha idol,

21
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,804
which belongs to Tamil Nadu
was retrieved at Australia.

22
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,845
The idol stolen few months
ago, has been retrieved now.

23
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,964
This has been announced by
the department of Police.

24
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:52,664
And is the latest news.

25
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,245
The Panchaloha idol which went
missing from Chennai Museum

26
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:57,935
many days ago,
has been found.

27
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,205
This has been informed by
the department of Police.

28
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,484
How many have been arrested
regarding to idol smuggling

29
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,085
and with more information,
will be known shortly.

30
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,725
Shivani, reporting
from sun news.

31
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,765
The four hundred and fifty years old
Panchaloha idol has been retrieved,

32
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,405
This is the hot topic, today.

33
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,524
The era has changed, God is
the saviour of the people...

34
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:15,524
But now, we have to
save the god from people

35
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,484
Hey, hold it.

36
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:20,545
Sir, open the gate.
- Sir, show us the idol.

37
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,484
Always, these people will
set the alarm and be ready.

38
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,285
Whatever happens, they
arrive immediately. - Sir.

39
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:31,304
Just wait.
- Sir, first news is our's.

40
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,244
Sir, why have you covered
the idol with cloth?

41
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,645
Dust shouldn't get
deposited, that's why.

42
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,565
What a stupid question.
- Where was this idol so far?

43
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,644
Has the culprits involved in
this were arrested? - Be patient.

44
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,745
Sir will come and
answer your questions.

45
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,265
Excuse me. - Sir.

46
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:49,724
Sir, who smuggled the idol?

47
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:51,145
Sir, who has been
involved in this?

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,724
Did you take photos of the idol?

49
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:53,850
Sir, who has been involved in this?

50
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,324
Is it the business men
or the politician?

51
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,869
Is this the Panchaloha idol
went missing from the museum?

52
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,925
Why is he giving same
expression for everything?

53
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:03,125
Thought he will say
something, - Sir!

54
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,324
Without answering my
questions, you're leaving.

55
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,364
Are you trying to help the
culprit to get escaped?

56
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,830
The reason behind

57
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:12,745
leaving without any response is that
the culprit should not escape.

58
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,245
He isn't saying anything.

59
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:14,965
Sir, Please wait.

60
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,985
He is leaving without
answering my questions.

61
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:27,869
Sir!
- What Rajamanikam?

62
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,245
How was the press meet?

63
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,145
Okay, sir.

64
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,869
Press people got convinced.

65
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,445
Will they all believe
that we have found out

66
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,764
four hundred and fifty
years old archaic idol?

67
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:37,869
The one who is having
the original idol

68
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:41,283
must be laughing that
we have closed the case.

69
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,364
If they believe we're
defeated, that's enough.

70
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,223
We will win, sir.

71
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,164
Now they will be in confusion
whether the idol they’ve

72
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:49,445
is original or duplicate.

73
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:53,005
In this profession, they will
not believe anyone so easily.

74
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,824
So, by the time they find out
whether it's original or not.

75
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,205
We will find the idol.

76
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,764
I've accepted this
plan since you said.

77
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,205
We have just one week.

78
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:03,285
Within that time, if
we don't get the idol,

79
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,964
Then, we will be in trouble.

80
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:05,869
Trust me, sir.

81
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:07,869
I'll definitely nab the culprit.

82
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:40,625
Musical lines from the film.
"Vettaikkaran".

83
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:50,885
It's like looking my own face.

84
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,285
Did you say, you will not cut?

85
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:53,869
Yes, I said I can't.

86
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,624
Why can’t you do it?

87
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,324
I'll not do the things
which I don't like.

88
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:02,204
Whether you like or not
but we like you doing it.

89
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:03,385
You should cut.

90
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:09,044
Once I have decided, I'll
not listen to my own words.

91
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:11,285
When you can’t, then why
should I listen to you?

92
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:12,365
You'll ask question if I say.

93
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:15,869
If you keep on talking like this,
you'll exist but not your mouth.

94
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:18,965
Many people are waiting
to shut my mouth.

95
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,705
Better I'll go.

96
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,784
I'll do.

97
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:24,685
Hey! - What?

98
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:26,605
Hey, don't come with bare body or
else you will become a corpse.

99
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:27,785
Wear the attire and come.

100
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:30,944
Just wait for five minutes.
I'll come.

101
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,245
Pullingo saloon If you
come, we will do cutting.

102
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,564
For dog, monkey, goat,
horses and all animals

103
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,364
haircut will be done here.

104
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,304
Note : If time permits, haircut
will be done for humans too.

105
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,023
His mouth is like a dry well.

106
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,284
Sir, go out and spit.
- Hey, what?

107
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,365
Sorry, sir. You spit here
where people move around.

108
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,345
Will you accept if I
spit in your house?

109
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:57,663
This was used for that!

110
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:00,644
Hey, don!

111
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,325
Finish the work quickly,
I have to leave.

112
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,544
Will apply this for him too.

113
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:09,764
Hey, what’s this?

114
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,204
It's not the usual fragrance.

115
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,764
This is used for animals, so
the fragrance differs. - What?

116
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:15,869
It was from Amazon forest, that's
why the fragrance is good.

117
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,285
It's meant for VIP's.

118
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,445
Hey, the fragrance is nice,
you continue with this.

119
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,485
Okay.

120
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,325
Hey, you're with zest
from the time you came.

121
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:22,924
What’s the reason?

122
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,405
Hey, being a PA of the councillor,
how can I be without zest?

123
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:27,784
What good you do for
people to be busy?

124
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:29,305
Raise your neck up.

125
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,585
Who turned the table fan?

126
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,869
Hey, where are you coming from?

127
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,869
I can’t tell you, get lost.
- Okay.

128
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,245
Good brought up!

129
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,585
Hey, take the razor
blade and get excited.

130
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:50,584
He got excited for
Nayanthara and screwed up.

131
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,124
Don...why are you dragging?

132
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,869
Sing like it suits us

133
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:22,285
"Hey, though torn and damaged,
you don't show up to your babe "

134
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:26,765
"Hey, Kamakshi, Meenakshi, chatter
box, you're the big hand in home "

135
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,164
"I was wandering around "

136
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:31,605
"She is creating scenes "

137
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:35,845
"She is installing a
tent in my humpy heart "

138
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,885
"My mother is your
mother-in-law "

139
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,125
"You step inside with
your right leg "

140
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,085
"It's a 20- 20 game "

141
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,565
"Shall I win you and
lift the cup? "

142
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,869
"She cheats by
nodding her head "

143
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,725
"My titanic is going back "

144
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,265
"I'm not lying, it's the fact "

145
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,869
"Alagesa, Maanik Batsha "

146
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,869
"He is the locale don "

147
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:20,565
"Picasso, it's the
breaking news "

148
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,345
"Your moon walk "

149
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:29,444
"Hey, the candy and burfi
I bought her with kindness "

150
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,765
"She is turning down "

151
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,524
"My Sachinolophia"

152
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,525
"Are you degree coffee?"

153
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,404
Hey, stop.

154
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:37,869
Hey, Reena.

155
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,124
You've roamed with
me for five days.

156
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,984
I'd have done
anything if I wished.

157
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,645
I was by- hearting the
dialogue of the film Minnale.

158
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:44,565
Hey, take it.
- Hey, what’s this?

159
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,265
From which trash did
you bring this?

160
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,285
This is not taken for trash,
select one out of it.

161
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,544
For what?

162
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,628
If you select one,
I'll print our names in the

163
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,445
wedding invitation
and distribute to all.

164
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:56,365
Hey, you fatso.

165
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:59,645
Are you a big shot?

166
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:02,284
I'm getting engaged to a foreign
bridegroom in next two days.

167
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,325
Do you know that? - What’s
the bridegroom's name?

168
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,565
Ramaswamy.

169
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,869
Is Ramaswamy a
bridegroom from foreign?

170
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:09,245
Without knowing who am I,
you dare to propose me.

171
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:10,964
Are you a big shot?

172
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:11,869
I'm not a big shot.

173
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:12,644
I'm a Don.

174
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:15,025
For which locale place
are you the don?

175
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,045
Not for any place.
My name is Don.

176
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,203
I'm not bothered whether
you're don or sweet shop bun.

177
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,364
Listen, I'm on my way to the
temple to meet the god.

178
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,785
If not, you will be in trouble.

179
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:27,104
It's a mere waste going
behind her all these days.

180
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,705
This generation is very worst.

181
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,505
How can I get married,
If she is like this?

182
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,544
Sir, what you said is right.
Olden days are the best.

183
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:48,545
Wonder, he is yet to leave.

184
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:49,544
Greetings, sir!

185
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,204
If you shave today,
it'll grow tomorrow.

186
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:52,725
What?

187
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,124
Girls are like that,
don't feel for it.

188
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:55,764
Do you understand?

189
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,625
Girls should feel for missing
good person like me.

190
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,165
Damn it. I'm telling to you.

191
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,224
What, sir?

192
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:02,984
Hello!

193
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:08,945
What, brother!

194
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,525
Your love too was broke up.

195
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:11,645
No, dude.

196
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:16,844
Boss said to take photos like
doing good deeds to the grannies.

197
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,205
It seems, there is death ritual
scene in sasikumar's film, today.

198
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,764
They have taken
all the grannies.

199
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,085
What to do, now?

200
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,869
Sasikumar sir take
city based films soon.

201
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:26,444
Now, you need grannies, right?

202
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,024
Will you come? - Not
that, Arvindswamy.

203
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,785
Now, you need grannies, right?

204
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:32,504
I'll will arrange immediately.

205
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:47,084
(Lyric from Kanda
Shasti Kavasam)

206
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,685
Wonder, I'm reciting
all film names.

207
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:51,869
Lord Muruga, somehow
save me from my wife.

208
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:56,464
Who will it be?

209
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,425
Project two?

210
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,945
For Shankar sir film they've
asked for junior artist.

211
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,225
The manager is calling for that.

212
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,305
I'll switch on the
speaker, speak now.

213
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,485
I'm trapped.

214
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,484
Hello! - Tell me, sister.

215
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:20,785
Sister?

216
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:25,845
You said to cast me in a new film
and asked me to call you as,'dear'.

217
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,869
I asked you to call
during the night.

218
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,725
Dear, reply me.

219
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,285
Have you changed my character?

220
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:34,844
I didn't change, looks like
director will change me.

221
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,804
Okay dear, tell me whatever
may be the character.

222
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,869
Then, for the condition
you told me

223
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:42,824
Oh, condition too? - Hey,
hang up the phone.

224
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:45,869
Dear!

225
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,865
Don’t you know about me?

226
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,564
I reckon all the
girls as my sister.

227
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:55,525
Even if she is sister,
you will look.

228
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,104
Don’t I know about you!

229
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,644
Muruga… Muruga… - Hey!

230
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:03,604
Muruga… Muruga… - Hey!

231
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:05,665
I'll keep the weapon
ready, come soon.

232
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:06,965
You...

233
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:09,605
Hey, my nose! don’t
tear my shirt.

234
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,869
Hey, don't poke.

235
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,024
Oh, gosh! just missed.

236
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:19,345
Always she is targeting me.

237
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,869
Her father had sent her to
karate class, it seems.

238
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:27,869
She is thrashing me badly.

239
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,704
I'm struggling getting
caught to her.

240
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,125
Tell me, dude.

241
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,445
AJ, you’re sounding dull?

242
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:41,869
Looks like, got punched
in the morning?

243
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,364
Hey, it's routine.

244
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,869
Okay, our councillor JB requires
four grannies for photo shoot.

245
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:48,764
Send them immediately.

246
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:51,423
Hey, I'm late to the shooting.

247
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,964
I'll send them
through Pandi's cab.

248
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:55,000
Instead of sending them in that cab,

249
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,765
You can send them through
the freezer box.

250
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,869
Dude, no other option.

251
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,365
Try to understand.

252
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:00,925
Okay, did Anbu call you?

253
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,284
Yes, dude.

254
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,165
He is getting engaged on 15th.

255
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,844
A video was posted portraying me
and your wife, that's not right.

256
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,684
He is hosting a
liquor party, today.

257
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,724
I'm telling you seriously,
aren't you ashamed?

258
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,869
Hang up the call.

259
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:13,869
Shameless.

260
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:18,785
Four grannies are coming.

261
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:39,745
A cintong guy taking the
grannies to cemetery.

262
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,869
Hey, at the age of dying,
you're making noise.

263
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:45,849
Hey, you brought us for shooting

264
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,681
and now making us to
push under the hot sun,

265
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:48,925
You stupid.

266
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,245
- How long we’re pushing!

267
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,613
What to do, only newly wed
have been in this car,

268
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,884
now going along with
the grannies because of AJ.

269
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,444
- Oh no, it’s paining.

270
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,684
Threw the stone in the water,

271
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:01,425
without asking anything
making us to push the car.

272
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,164
Hey, you shouldn't be
allowed to push

273
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:04,165
instead, you must be tied
with stone and dropped at sea.

274
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,444
Hey, I'll throw you up.

275
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,869
Hey, is there an engine in this
vehicle or not, you wastrel.

276
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:09,204
Don't know whether
you have a tooth,

277
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:10,285
But teasing me whether
the car has an engine?

278
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,963
Hey, Chandi! no point
blaming this guy.

279
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:15,685
The agent who brought us
here should be squeezed.

280
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,125
He made us to push the
vehicle and killing us.

281
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:20,125
Yesteryear Andrea, is that
a ear or ear ring stand?

282
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,404
You have pierced all over.

283
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:23,005
Hey, have this.

284
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,780
I was supposed to go in Audi car,

285
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,845
but because of AJ going along
with these grannies.

286
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,885
Hey wastrel. - Wait, I'll get
the petrol and smack you.

287
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:31,105
- They’re not revealing
what’s happening.

288
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,525
What are you looking,
I said for you too.

289
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:40,445
Death is ultimate, for your death
also my vehicle will arrive.

290
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:45,869
Give me the fuel, I should
get and leave soon.

291
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:56,545
To whom should the
fuel to be filled?

292
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,384
To the car or to sir!

293
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:01,384
If it's filled to sir, then
only car can be driven.

294
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:04,725
I'll get fuelled up.

295
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:05,869
- If I ask you a peg,
you’re not buying me.

296
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,605
Hey, freebie Yamadharma
Raja, how are you?

297
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,004
You didn't come
yesterday for boozing.

298
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,124
Dude, I didn't have money.

299
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,869
Brother, give me Rs. 105 stuff.

300
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:12,704
Thank you, Patti.

301
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,785
Bye. - Give me a beer.

302
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:19,244
Hey, who is this wastrel?

303
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,204
Who’s that?

304
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:22,645
Hey, what kind of head is this?

305
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,225
It's like stones thrown
in water to pass by.

306
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:26,665
Okay, go.

307
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,869
Cool, dude. - Did you
guys watch the match?

308
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,869
Everything is betting.

309
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:34,684
Hey, you don't have
money to buy a quarter,

310
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,045
So, sharing a peg
among four of you.

311
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,644
Why are you talking
about betting?

312
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,085
Hey, soggy pickle head.

313
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,165
Dude, next world cup is for us.

314
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,045
Don't worry.

315
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,125
Surely, for us.

316
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,444
Sir, what did you say?
- World cup.

317
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:49,484
Sir, what did you say?
- Dude, world cup.

318
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,869
Hey, you don't have money
to buy water and a glass,

319
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,869
you pick up the used
glass, clean it and drink.

320
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,445
You’re talking about
the world cup!

321
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,704
You egg head.

322
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:05,869
Hi, sir!

323
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:06,925
I'm Anbu. - Tell me.

324
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,204
Blue berry Interiors. - Yes.

325
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:10,124
I’m standing in front of your house.
- Standing in front of the house?

326
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:10,904
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,505
Dude, look this side.

328
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,285
This side, behind the saree.

329
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,365
Behind the saree?

330
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:18,224
Hi, sir!

331
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:21,224
Come on.

332
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:29,524
This place looks
like a graveyard!

333
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,085
What is he doing here!

334
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:31,869
Hi, sir!

335
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,604
Sir, can we take a
look at the site?

336
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:37,044
Wait, why are you in a hurry?

337
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,545
Don't be in a hurry.

338
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:40,844
This one. - Oh, god!

339
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,565
This is the place, where my
palace has to be constructed.

340
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,824
The judgment is on January and
I'll buy this place on February.

341
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,725
So, you didn't buy
this place yet?

342
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,405
If case gets over, then
only I'll get the money.

343
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:51,085
You're speaking without
understanding the logic.

344
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:52,085
I understood.

345
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:53,564
What job are you doing?
- I'm jobless.

346
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,223
Instead of being jobless, you can
keep your head on the railway track.

347
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:57,605
Hey, why do you tie
it on his head?

348
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:59,869
Come, sir.

349
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:00,785
Give me.

350
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,865
Hey, just now I finished shaving for
you, how did the hair grew so soon?

351
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,605
Hey, you did the shaving, but
did you affix the blade?

352
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,525
Oh, didn’t I affix the blade?

353
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:09,869
Where is the granny?

354
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,065
Hasn’t she come?

355
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:14,845
Not yet, if she has come
why will I be here?

356
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:16,885
Oh, no! give me a second.

357
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:17,869
Hey, take the phone.

358
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,064
Pick up the phone,
you bald head.

359
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,385
Hey, your neck is not visible!

360
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:31,605
Hello!

361
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,404
Don, has the photo
shoot started?

362
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:34,844
How about the
grannies performance?

363
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,213
Hey, more than the
grannies performance,

364
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,325
a guy here is performing high.

365
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:38,125
They haven't come yet.

366
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:38,885
Didn't they come yet?

367
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,869
Hey, what are you saying!

368
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:40,925
I'm telling you, they
haven't come yet.

369
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,045
I had send them by Vasu's car.
- Oh, no!

370
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,365
Hey, send them soon.

371
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,244
Hey, hang up the phone.

372
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,865
I'll check. - Okay.

373
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,204
Brother, all the
grannies are on the way.

374
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:53,384
Don't shave for me, do it for him.
The cream is getting dry.

375
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:54,524
I'll give the money, brother.

376
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,044
If granny doesn't come back, then
you'll be wandering as a ghost.

377
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:57,764
Have it.

378
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,824
To say this punch dialogue,
he has come again it seems.

379
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:06,185
Hey, damn it. Hang up the phone.

380
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:16,544
(Musical lines from
the film “Enthiran” )

381
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,465
Who is singing that chorus?

382
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:26,864
(Musical lines from
the film “Enthiran”)

383
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,344
Who is that monkey
singing chorus?

384
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:43,165
On Saturday, as auspiciously

385
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,869
To feel happy and to good

386
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,804
Bathe with Sera powder

387
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:52,825
And struggle to breathe too

388
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:56,163
One is looking at the phone and
another hunting at the head lice.

389
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,645
Hey, shall we go for
'Avengers' film at 6’o clock?

390
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,598
Hey, already your eyes got crumpled

391
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,684
and looks this year will be
the end of your game.

392
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,204
In this condition, are you
going for Avengers end game?

393
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:07,484
They swindled and projecting.
- Swindled and projecting!

394
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:10,445
Hey, it's been projected in 3D.

395
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:11,869
You burnt scare doll.

396
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:13,869
Hey, don't mock us.

397
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,285
Who is that mam?

398
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,776
Sleeping like in Hotel Hyatt
suite room

399
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,125
by paying sixty thousand rupees.

400
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:18,985
Statue!

401
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:22,904
Down...down...

402
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:24,845
Tell me. - Anbu!

403
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,843
I've sent four grannies with
Pandi to councillor's house.

404
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,005
He is yet to reach.

405
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,565
He is not picking up my call.

406
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,764
He must be driving
in the traffic.

407
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:33,325
Hey, hang up the phone.

408
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:34,684
Hey, what are you talking?

409
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:35,869
When did he drive
on the main road?

410
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,226
Since the vehicle doesn't have
proper documents,

411
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,325
he goes by adjacent streets.

412
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:39,845
Then, how could it
be a traffic jam?

413
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,444
You hang up the phone, I'll
call and then let me know.

414
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:42,384
Hey...

415
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:43,085
Dude, what?

416
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,325
Hey, I'll be on line, you
take a conference call.

417
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:46,424
Okay, wait.

418
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:51,067
Only my vehicle has the speciality
of taking the petrol tank out

419
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,445
and getting it filled.

420
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:56,703
"This is the illusion, this is
the reality, in this world"

421
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,124
Hello!

422
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,245
Hey, where are you?

423
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:02,725
Hey, your engagement party
is today evening, right?

424
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,765
For that, why are you
calling so early?

425
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,125
Okay, tell me the
address, I'll come.

426
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:09,869
No. 6, Durairaj street,
Alwarthirunagar.

427
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,605
Hey, good dude.

428
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,204
You talk like AJ and say
the address perfectly.

429
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:16,745
Not like AJ, I'm AJ speaking.

430
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,605
Where are you, wastrel?

431
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,545
Hey, dude! the car has
halted without fuel.

432
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,445
Just now filled up
the fuel, I'll come.

433
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:27,085
Do you've sense? The
councillor is waiting for you.

434
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:29,084
I'm coming, wait.

435
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,884
How many times people
awaited for him?

436
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,485
Will he not wait for
the people, now?

437
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:33,869
Hey, come and sit inside.
- Hey, be quiet.

438
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,725
I'm going to die.

439
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:38,405
Hey, I'm warning you.
- What are you thinking?

440
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,865
Go slowly.

441
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,605
I searched through online,

442
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,284
I was told the cost is less
here, among all the galleries.

443
00:21:59,344 --> 00:21:59,869
That's why, I've come here.

444
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:00,745
Brother, greetings!

445
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,869
If the deal is okay, I'll
regularly come here.

446
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:07,844
You have come to our shop,
select your desired painting.

447
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:09,869
We will give you an
estimation slip.

448
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,325
You can compare
with other shops.

449
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,764
Where the price is lesser,
you can buy there.

450
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:17,245
Brother, if there is a
discount, let me know.

451
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,364
We do have 50% discount.

452
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:21,325
But we will bill thousand rupees
as two thousand, is that okay?

453
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:22,885
Brother, I don't need the bill.

454
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:24,364
Reduce the price and
give, that's enough.

455
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:25,585
Is it?
- Hey.

456
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:28,184
Brother!
- Who is that?

457
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,964
Good customer, he
doesn't require bill.

458
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:32,884
It's enough if we
give at lesser cost.

459
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:33,724
What’s the cost?

460
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:34,724
It's Rs. 250

461
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:35,684
You mean 2.5 Billion?

462
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:37,385
Just Rs. 250!

463
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:39,824
I might yell at you.

464
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:40,925
If you don't want, leave it.

465
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,145
Brother, Sounder sir has
come along with a person.

466
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:46,424
I'll come and settle with you.

467
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,925
Brother, is the discount okay?

468
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:51,485
One or two rupee difference is
fine, we'll talk and finalize.

469
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,104
Hey, go away.

470
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,565
Greetings, KB!
- Tell me, Sounder.

471
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,604
Did you see the television news?

472
00:22:58,664 --> 00:22:59,564
How do you know that?

473
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:00,985
That's visible in your face.

474
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,810
Are you giving me
a shocking surprise

475
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,524
for abducting the
Panchaloha idol?

476
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,685
KB! - Come.

477
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:08,444
Though the police said, they've
found the original idol,

478
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:09,445
I didn't believe it.

479
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,485
But the client has
a small doubt.

480
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,084
That’s why!

481
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:14,185
Hey, Ravi. - Brother!

482
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,305
Is the idol inside?

483
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,869
Appraiser, have you
finished checking?

484
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,145
This is not Panchaloha idol.

485
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,764
Then, what? Anna statue?

486
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,345
Hey! - Sorry, boss.

487
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,024
More above that!

488
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:21,354
More important than Panchaloha idol.

489
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:25,664
This is the oldest
statue during Chola dynasty.

490
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,804
In the whole world, only one or two
statues are existing like this.

491
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:34,124
I've heard my father saying it.

492
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:38,725
I'm seeing archaic type of statue
for the first time in my life.

493
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:42,125
For decades together, these statues
where protected by the Kings.

494
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:44,125
The foreigners
smuggled the statue.

495
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,405
Our government retrieved
the statue

496
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,784
and kept it in
our museum with security.

497
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:51,785
That too, secretly.

498
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,763
The value of this is...

499
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:56,924
Okay, I didn't call you to
tell the history or geography.

500
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,325
You can leave now.

501
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,904
Sounder, you are stammering?

502
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,125
Do you've blood pressure?

503
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:03,869
Hey, give some water to him.

504
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:06,364
That deal is already done.
- For what?

505
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,085
You're dubious and brought
a person to check.

506
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:09,284
Sorry, KB.

507
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:10,904
They're international clients.

508
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:12,945
Is that so, Sounder!

509
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,344
I'm a locale client,
I'll do like this.

510
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:18,404
If I had been calm you
would’ve cheated me, right?

511
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:20,084
Hey, mind your words.

512
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,405
Already we have finalized for 12
if required, I'll give you 13.

513
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:23,245
I need 20.

514
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:27,385
It's too high, KB. - Hey, 25.

515
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:29,869
Okay, cool!

516
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,489
Tell me,
tomorrow's delivery details.

517
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:33,869
We will talk about the rest later.

518
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:38,305
First credit 50% to my account.
Rest, I'll tell you tomorrow.

519
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:45,665
Though we buy grinder and
mixie for these women

520
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:49,243
they feel happy in asking us
to buy the batter from the shop.

521
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:53,865
That too, they feel happy in
making the husbands to toil.

522
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:55,024
It looks like a car but
helmet is not seen.

523
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:55,505
Hey, what's this?

524
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:56,184
Hey!

525
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:57,065
Look, how the monkey
is getting down.

526
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,004
AJ, get the things at the back.
- Okay, dude.

527
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:02,184
Who let the poster sticking
guys inside the apartment?

528
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,265
I'm the secretary
of this apartment.

529
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:06,065
You look like a
hybrid coconut tree.

530
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:06,785
Are you a secretary?

531
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:07,464
Damn it.

532
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,464
Anbu!

533
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:09,744
Hey, come on. He had
created an issue it seems.

534
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:10,569
What nonsense?

535
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:13,344
Don't you know the
rules and regulations?

536
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,945
Bachelors not allowed.

537
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:16,304
Sir, he was married and
have two children.

538
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,625
Then, he is a family man.

539
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:18,569
You'd have told me earlier.

540
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:20,640
He looks like a scoundrel.

541
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,404
Okay, Arjun reddy.

542
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,285
Great of us managing
this secretary.

543
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,824
Hey, here is the fruits.
Wash and keep it.

544
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,569
You might ask me to wash
the toilet, it seems.

545
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:31,844
Yes, clean that too.

546
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:35,765
He called me for treat
and illtreating me.

547
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:46,485
What a happiness on being free!

548
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:50,165
Oh, no! Why is the devil
calling me at this time?

549
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:51,984
Tell me, dear. - Where are you?

550
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,305
My friend Anbu's
engagement is on Sunday.

551
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:55,824
- Okay.

552
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,384
So, came to meet him
and talk to him.

553
00:26:58,444 --> 00:26:59,784
- and also boozing with him.

554
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:00,569
Yes.

555
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:02,424
What? - No, dear.

556
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,184
How can you suspect me, dear?

557
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:06,104
I won't even piss,
without your permission.

558
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,105
Will I booze then? Believe me.

559
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:09,845
I'm astonished.

560
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,944
Okay, when coming home,
don't forget to buy

561
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:16,185
half a kilo of halwa
from Archana sweets.

562
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:17,924
Okay, dear.

563
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:22,569
I can't even tie this dhoti
from the day I married her.

564
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:23,865
First, she must be
deported from the country.

565
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:25,464
Tell me, mom. - Anbu!

566
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:27,344
I informed our relatives.

567
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:30,305
Everyone is starting by
the same time to Chennai.

568
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,565
Okay, mom. - Take care of them.

569
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:36,864
She told me some shop name?
- Archana sweets.

570
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:40,305
Hey, how do you know
what my wife asked?

571
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,425
Can't I heed your wife's voice
when your mind voice is heard?

572
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:45,644
Would it have been audible?
He says it right.

573
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,584
It's for the earth.

574
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,185
It's for my deceased aunt.

575
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:12,125
It's for me.

576
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:28,569
(Musical lines from
the film”Bigil”)

577
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:34,544
Good, the music gets surrendered
to me when I booze.

578
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,143
After the engagement of our dude,
I'll join the'Super singer programme'

579
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,364
and must give tough competition
to Anirudh, the music director.

580
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:52,569
Why is this confusion
calling me?

581
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:53,985
Tell me, uncle.

582
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:57,905
Son- in- law, I've
started from Kambam.

583
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:00,569
When? - Just now.

584
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:02,504
I'll reach in the morning.
Come and pick me up.

585
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:03,564
Okay, uncle.

586
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:06,164
The problem has started.

587
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:08,785
Hey!

588
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:10,445
The stuff didn't arrive yet.
But, you are ready.

589
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,904
Hey, other planetorian. - What?

590
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:17,145
Have you come to booze
not knowing this?

591
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,924
A person is there for it.

592
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,444
Don booze for free.

593
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:24,005
Don booze the leftovers.

594
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:27,464
He will buy the
stuff, you enjoy it.

595
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:29,984
Hit him. Excellent, Don!

596
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,425
Hit him with broomstick.

597
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,024
Whose dialogue are
you imitating?

598
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,184
Is it wrong to exaggerate?

599
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:37,425
Look at his style of sitting.
Like a monkey.

600
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,744
Hold him. He is looking like
a ghost buster at temple.

601
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:40,544
Come, dude.

602
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,964
Hi, dude! speaking
with girl on phone?

603
00:29:42,024 --> 00:29:43,222
Don't be serious,
you'll get caught.

604
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:45,424
I'll go to the restroom.

605
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,304
No one should touch
the stuff till then.

606
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:47,444
Understand? - Okay.

607
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,183
What? - Okay, don.

608
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:50,125
I'll be back.

609
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:52,569
Who left the tap opened?

610
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:05,584
Hey, have you poured everything?

611
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:06,569
Yes, dude.

612
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:10,205
The cocktail is ready.

613
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,044
Hey, momo!

614
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:14,825
Who is he calling as uncle?

615
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:15,545
Don't know.

616
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,845
Who is that?

617
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,044
Peocock.

618
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,625
He called,'momo'but
a parrot is coming.

619
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:24,569
It'll weigh four kilograms.

620
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:29,385
Dude, instead of buying chicken and
mutton, have you bought this parrot?

621
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:31,760
Hey, Nagadosha Nagaraja, - What?

622
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,544
Take it, clean it, fry
well and bring it soon.

623
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:36,224
How dare you want to fry it?

624
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,283
Was that given by
fisherwoman to fry?

625
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:40,025
My houselady gave it. - Sit down.

626
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:43,064
When did you made the house
owner to fall for you?

627
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:46,305
She is Momo.
- Momo!

628
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,305
This parrot only connected
me and my would- be.

629
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:51,285
Connected you with your would-be?
- What bird is this?

630
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,309
I started rearing this parrot which
came to me, missing it's direction.

631
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,321
One day...
- He is going to narrate a story.

632
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:02,945
Bro!

633
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:04,265
Come on, my
neighborhood wastrel.

634
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:06,344
A girl has posted in Facebook
that this parrot is missing.

635
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:06,944
A girl?

636
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:11,525
Who is this cute parrot, without
a face in the Facebook?

637
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:15,965
9- 5- 4- 6- 5- 7- 5- 8

638
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,845
Hello, Thamizini!

639
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,284
Mr. Anbu!

640
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:32,364
Momo!

641
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:35,565
How did you managed without me?

642
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:43,664
"I'm dancing, move away
The tiger of South"

643
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,424
Who are you?

644
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:46,569
I've posted in Facebook
that my parrot was missing.

645
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:49,424
You too called me.
That's why, I came.

646
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:51,585
Oh, is it you? Just a minute.

647
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:52,565
Okay.

648
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:56,324
Momo!

649
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,544
Hi! - Hi!

650
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:03,185
You've designed your
house so beautifully.

651
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:08,025
I'll move if you
give me the parrot.

652
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:12,845
Not only the parrot...
If you agree, I'll give you life.

653
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,605
It's glowing!

654
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,284
Oh, she laughed.

655
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:29,124
Musical line from the film,
"Aananda kummi".

656
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,544
Girls love the guys who tell lies.
They don't like us.

657
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,412
This is my love epic!

658
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:36,545
What's that love epic and painting?

659
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:41,585
It's not fitting right,
going down only.

660
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:44,424
You said it right.
- Hey, shameless.

661
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:47,525
Does this end here or
continuing as sequel?

662
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,545
Oh, no! It seems to be going on.

663
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:51,545
What's lacking in the
girl I've fixed?

664
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:53,459
She has beautiful
features, isn't it?

665
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,785
I don't like, mom.

666
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:59,784
I knew well, you say this thinking
of the monkey who reared the parrot.

667
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,304
Mom, you don't keep
talking something.

668
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,785
I have my own taste, right?
Will I fall in love with her?

669
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,904
Oh, god! - Shut your mouth.

670
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:11,481
Out of my angst,
If I come to Madras,

671
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,704
I'll make soup with that parrot.

672
00:33:13,764 --> 00:33:15,405
Soup!

673
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:21,225
Why is she bringing me to
the police station now?

674
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:23,424
Thamizini!

675
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,965
Wonder, what's going to happen?

676
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:28,085
Sir!

677
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:31,425
Is it you?

678
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:32,569
What job are you doing?

679
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:36,425
I'm an interior designer.
I own a firm too.

680
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:40,344
What's your monthly income?
- Upto 40 to 60K.

681
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:42,564
Sir, why are you
asking all these?

682
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:47,664
I must check whether you've the
capability to feed the parrot?

683
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:50,143
I'll do all those, well.
Visit my home, sir.

684
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:51,756
I've done special
arrangements for it.

685
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:52,811
I've built a swing too.

686
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:55,745
Oh, started to come
to your home too?

687
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:56,569
- Yes, sir.

688
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:57,984
For past three months,
staying with me only.

689
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,345
What? - Oh, my god!

690
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,424
Dad! He isn't saying
about me but our parrot.

691
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:03,144
Dad!

692
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,105
Are you the daughter
of the policeman?

693
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,245
He is okay for me.
Are you happy?

694
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,784
Though short, she
does so many things.

695
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:15,324
I believe, he knows your value.

696
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,144
Thank you, dad.

697
00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:19,904
I'll leave, then. - Okay, bye.

698
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,884
Come. - Bye, uncle.

699
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:24,545
Anbu! - Uncle.

700
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:25,944

Stepstone apartment.

702
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:29,924
I'm leaving.

703
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:35,504
I saw people who fell in love,
going to railway station.

704
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:38,525
But contrary, you've gone
to the police station.

705
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:43,385
Her father has accepted, right?
- Yes.

706
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:44,944
What did he do so big?

707
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:45,585
Hey!

708
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,465
He fell in love with a normal babe
and going to be engaged with her.

709
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,569
What did you say?

710
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:50,184
Have you seen my wife, dude?

711
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:52,305
I've seen her with
others except you.

712
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,624
Have I ever told you?

713
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,844

719
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:32,273
"We add the local

"We don't have money to

732
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:35,472
"We feel happy on the
day we get the stuff"

733
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:39,473

Hey, he fell down mouth
wide opened like a snake.

756
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:16,174
Hey, momo! I've seen a
parrot saying astrology.

757
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,774
For the first time, I'm seeing a
parrot doing a middleman job.

758
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:27,394
Does my face look like
western toilet for you?

759
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:28,752
You dare to shit on my face.

760
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,174
I'll cook and eat you.

761
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,714
What a nuisance!

762
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:46,778
Woman shouldn't stay at
nights in the police station.

763
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,274
Come in the morning.

764
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:50,778
A policewoman will be there.
Give the complaint and leave.

765
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:54,713
It's time for the Inspector
to arrive. Leave now.

766
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:56,592
He will yell.

767
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:58,778
Go... Go, please.

768
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,234
Hey, who is that?
Is it you, sir?

769
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,614
Sorry, sir.

770
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,153
Hey, who is she?
What's the issue?

771
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:17,634
Sir, it's a missing
case of a girl.

772
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:19,114
She is waiting to
lodge a complaint.

773
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,194
Have you informed the woman SI?

774
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,514
I'm trying to contact
her for long time.

775
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:22,313
Couldn't reach her, sir.

776
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:23,513
Go and tell her
to come upstairs.

777
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:24,194
Okay, sir.

778
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:26,433
Tell me, what's the issue?

779
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:29,074
Sir, my name is Amutha.

780
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:32,554
I'm running a women's PG
home in 3rd cross street.

781
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,353
Shalini, working as a
nurse is staying there.

782
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,534
She is missing since last night.

783
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,394
She might've been given
over time at hospital.

784
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:40,354
No, sir.

785
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:44,153
She left the job taking leave.

786
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:47,434
Her cell phone is switched off.

787
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,778
Did you enquired in her house?

788
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,353
No, sir. She is an orphan.

789
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:58,393
Tell me her phone number.
90030 85404

790
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:01,053
Do you've her photo?
- Yeah, I have, sir.

791
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:07,933
This girl, sir.

792
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,334
I got headache.

793
00:40:57,973 --> 00:40:59,713
Hey, wait.

794
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:02,134
Keep on pressing
the calling bell.

795
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,593
Hi!
- Hi!

796
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,693
Why so long to open the door?

797
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:32,112
Have you come to attend the
special class and cheat me?

798
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,032
No, leave me.

799
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,614
Egg head, is he here?

800
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,793
Hey! - Hey, no!

801
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:45,514
Be careful. Be careful!

802
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:46,394
What?

803
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:51,773
This place isn't right for vastu.
Let's change the place.

804
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:02,534
Oh, gosh! a girl is lying on bed?
It's over.

805
00:42:08,374 --> 00:42:10,512
When all are coming from Kambam?

806
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,593
I think, they've come.
Just a minute.

807
00:42:12,653 --> 00:42:15,234
Yes, uncle. - Hi, Son- in- law!

808
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:18,713
Have you reached Guindy, so soon?
- Don't make fun, son- in- law.

809
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:23,273
The bus didn't reach Ulundurpet yet.
It's moving dead slow.

810
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,718
What?
Are you getting down at Guindy?

811
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:28,354
Son-in-law, it's Ulundur...

812
00:42:28,414 --> 00:42:31,693
Not Guindy, you get down at pillar,
I'll come and pick you up.

813
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,873
He had disconnected the call.

814
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,834
Hey, my uncle has arrived.
You leave.

815
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:39,593
Why should I leave
if he arrives?

816
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:42,593
Won't he mistake me
if we are alone?

817
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:45,954
Why should he mistake us? We
are getting engaged, right?

818
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:48,233
Have I slept in toilet?

819
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:49,953
I need to fresh up, okay?

820
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:51,413
Okay, bye. - Bye.

821
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,474
Hey, come. - What?

822
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,778
Who is this girl lying on bed?

823
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,313
Hey, ask him who is sleeping.
It's a big mistake, you know.

824
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:07,613
He enjoyed alone, leaving us.

825
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:09,994
You...
- Oh, no!

826
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,614
Why Pandi is shouting?

827
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,953
Kubera, I'll look
after you, later.

828
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,273
What?

829
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:22,133
Someone has looted away the
alcohol I kept for hang over.

830
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:25,154
I swear, I didn't drink.

831
00:43:25,214 --> 00:43:28,633
There is protection for women
but not for the stuff.

832
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,353
A law must be implemented
to safeguard it.

833
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:33,394
I'm in anger, someone is playing
the songs on loudspeaker.

834
00:43:33,454 --> 00:43:35,674
Won't you ask it?
Go and ask him.

835
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:37,754
He thinks like actor Kamal
raising his eyebrows.

836
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:38,494
Go...

837
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:47,833
We didn't order anything.

838
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,533
Think well.

839
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,778
AJ, did you order anything?
- No, I don't know to order.

840
00:43:56,172 --> 00:43:58,333
I think, you came
to wrong address.

841
00:44:00,694 --> 00:44:02,074
How can you've my card?

842
00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:06,173
Your card's pin number is 4747.
Is it right?

843
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,794
Money is not debited
from my account.

844
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:14,014
How did you get my card?

845
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:27,833
They have spoiled the field
by doing standup comedy.

846
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:29,153
The food is yet to arrive.

847
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:31,973
Come inside, If
you have dignity.

848
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:33,553
Sir! - Come inside.

849
00:44:33,613 --> 00:44:35,693
Is boozing session going on?

850
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:38,114
Look, he is coming.

851
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,114
But, you wouldn't
have come, isn't it?

852
00:44:40,174 --> 00:44:42,574
I'm hungry.

853
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,594
Ask him how much is the bill.
- How much is the bill?

854
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:48,754
Who took the peanuts kept here?
- Just a second, sir.

855
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,754
Rs. 1400, sir.

856
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:52,778
It's wrong on posting the
video of my wife on facebook

857
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,154
Sir, I don't have balance.
- Have it as tips.

858
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:56,778
Thank you, sir. - That's
fake news, dude.

859
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,553
Sir, another party
has ordered it.

860
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,778
Hey, doesn't this
look like a party?

861
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,754
That's it, dude.

862
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:04,778
Sir, I said another
customer has ordered it.

863
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,114
Leave me, I'll hit him to death.

864
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:09,634
Hit him, let me see.
You can't hit, right?

865
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:12,514
If you sell that glass bottle
to crap shop, you will get Rs. 2

866
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:13,794
Buy me cigarette
tomorrow morning.

867
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:15,034
The customer is calling me.

868
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:16,474
Hey, give it.

869
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,473
Sir, give me the phone.

870
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:19,713
Sir, call from customer.

871
00:45:19,773 --> 00:45:21,874
Sir, please.

872
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:23,513
Give me the phone, sir.
- Where are you?

873
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,834
In my friend Anbu's house.

874
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:27,312
What are you doing there?

875
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:29,753
Boozed heavily and
speaking to you.

876
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:30,593
Are you boozing?

877
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,072
Then, what about my food
order, mutton biryani?

878
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:35,434
What's your name?

879
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:37,234
My name? Purushothaman.

880
00:45:37,294 --> 00:45:39,073
What? Have you left your
husband in plantation?

881
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,714
Hey, I said as Purushothaman.

882
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:42,073
Purush!

883
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:44,708
My school headmaster
Mr. Manobala has told,

884
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:47,273
Purushothaman shouldn't eat biryani.

885
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,778
I love you. Hang up the call.

886
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,874
Listen to me, sir. Give
me the phone, sir.

887
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:51,673
Why are you in hurry? Wait.

888
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:55,994
It's you going to deliver food to
women after their husbands leave.

889
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,833
What's there to hurry? Drink it.

890
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,393
Give it. Drink.

891
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:01,794
Open your mouth. - Sir!

892
00:46:01,854 --> 00:46:03,674
Don't mank noise.
Look at his mouth.

893
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:06,778
Enough. Pour him.

894
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:08,174
Drink it.

895
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:13,154
If your keep your face like
spitting, it'll spill out.

896
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:14,453
Stay away and pour him.

897
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,213
Stuff, dude.

898
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,413
I pushed the bottle. - Sir.

899
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:24,233
Go and buy the stuff. - Sir.

900
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:24,778
Give me the mobile.

901
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,474
It's you people who roam around the
whole Chennai city than the patrol.

902
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,633
Yes, dude. Sit down.

903
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:36,512
I don't know whether you will
go to Pondicherry or Velachery.

904
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:39,280
If you don't buy the stuff
which you wasted

905
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,575
both of your ears will be
in Kodungaiyur garbage mount.

906
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:45,496
Your head will lie under
the Guindy bridge.

907
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:48,658
Later, we four will
come and identify you.

908
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:51,088
Later, we will come out
with help of our lawyer.

909
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:52,674
Do you want us to come
for identification?

910
00:46:52,734 --> 00:46:54,160
Or will you buy us alcohol?

911
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,194
Take this card.

912
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,305
Go...

913
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:59,918
4747 Go...

914
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:02,059
Monkey, give the bag to him.

915
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:03,660
The monkey is showing off.

916
00:47:05,854 --> 00:47:08,658
Hey, I'll poke your eyes.

917
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,767
Go.

918
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:13,334
The day you took the bike, no one
is cooking. Close the door and go.

919
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:16,658
You asked me to get parcel
of half boiled egg.

920
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:23,504
Brother, I'm preparing coffee.
Have and go.

921
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:25,344
I'm in frustration.
- Believe me, brother.

922
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:28,144
I worked as a cook when studying
for a salary of Rs. 10k.

923
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:29,104
I went abroad too.

924
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:31,184
Get lost, goof. - What, brother?

925
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,173
Drunkard.

926
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:37,944
Anbu, though you're inebriated,
It's wrong to give the debit card.

927
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:42,074
Hey, he gave his debit card but
you gave your house address

928
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,745
and asked him to buy
halwa for your wife.

929
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:46,364
Is it me? - That too
in Archana sweets.

930
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:49,725
Confirmed to get
scoldings, today.

931
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,984
Why I'm getting horrible
dreams, now a days?

932
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:56,785
Why am I coming in my own dream?

933
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,844
I should take bath
and go to temple.

934
00:48:02,165 --> 00:48:04,569
In this field, I'm
the only virgin boy.

935
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,569
Why is she lying next to me?

936
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,144
Hey!

937
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:10,145
Hey, girl!

938
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,569
These days, girls drink
more than the guys.

939
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,125
Wait, I'm coming.

940
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,569
AJ

941
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:18,943
Don't know, what
to say to my wife.

942
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:20,184
Hey, AJ, when did you
arranged this programme?

943
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,305
Should I pay for this too?

944
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:24,824
Hey, don't change the topic.

945
00:48:24,884 --> 00:48:26,304
First wake her up
and send her out.

946
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,085
Hey, who is changing the topic?

947
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:30,395
Since your wife is having an
affair with your brother,

948
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:31,504
you brought a junior artist,
isn't it?

949
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:33,343
Hey, don't try to be smart.

950
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:35,344
Hey, Anbu see what is he talking.
- Be quite.

951
00:48:35,404 --> 00:48:36,698
Night without our knowledge,

952
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,569
someone has come and taken the debit
card and even saying the pin number.

953
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,569
Now unnecessarily arguing,
you did or he did.

954
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:43,024
Send her out first. - Go,
send her out first.

955
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:46,164
It's you bringing her in and I've to
send her out, what justice is this?

956
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,164
Hey! Vodka smell.

957
00:48:49,524 --> 00:48:50,424
Hey, you.

958
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:51,444
Hey, you turn.

959
00:48:52,485 --> 00:48:53,964
Why are you staring? Get up.

960
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:55,925
Hey, I'm telling you.

961
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,404
Why is her eyes wide opened?

962
00:48:58,565 --> 00:49:00,284
Had she applied eye drops?

963
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:04,569
Oh, no! Hey, Anbu!

964
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:05,625
Hey, why are you shouting?

965
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:06,465
Hey, Anbu! come soon.

966
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:07,745
Hey, what happened?

967
00:49:07,805 --> 00:49:09,024
Who is this girl,
lying dead here?

968
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,569
What are you saying? - Yes.

969
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:12,844
Can't you hear? She is dead.

970
00:49:13,605 --> 00:49:14,205
Oh, no!

971
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,404
Is she dead? - What is he doing?

972
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,544
Doctor, will she
wake up in two days?

973
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,145
Hey, already she is awake.

974
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:21,804
You know right, then why
you touch her? Come.

975
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:24,185
Don't know who did the murder?
I've to shut the shop too.

976
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,865
The customers will be angry.

977
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:29,505
I believed you and left you in
house, now you have ruined my life.

978
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:31,865
What’s sin I did? Why
did you do like this?

979
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:33,104
Hey, don! - Tell me.

980
00:49:33,164 --> 00:49:36,545
Think properly, you slept
next to her, right? - Yes.

981
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:37,744
Then, it’s you who
murdered her, right?

982
00:49:37,804 --> 00:49:39,785
Hey, does this face
look like a murderer?

983
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:41,544
I swear, I didn't do the murder.

984
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,345
Hey, tell me the truth,
who murdered her?

985
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:46,384
Hey, don't repeat as murder.
I'm getting scared.

986
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:49,484
Oh, did the girl come on her
own and murdered herself?

987
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:52,569
I've socialized with you
without any hierarchy.

988
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:54,185
You've trapped me now.

989
00:49:54,245 --> 00:49:56,825
Anbu, don't utter
unnecessary words.

990
00:49:56,885 --> 00:49:59,064
We came for free booze,
that's our fault.

991
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,305
For that sake, we can't
tolerate whatever you talk.

992
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,984
Why are you staring?
Will you hit me?

993
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:03,824
Hit me!

994
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:04,784
If I hit you, in turn
you will hit me more.

995
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:05,563
You step back.

996
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:06,884
I'm going to the police.

997
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,065
Why? - I’m going to the police.

998
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,064
Whom to trap? - It's
okay, whatever happens.

999
00:50:11,124 --> 00:50:12,508
Hey, he is saying he will go to the police,

1000
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:14,563
you're standing as if doing Namaz.
Call him.

1001
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:16,304
Hey, you go.

1002
00:50:16,364 --> 00:50:18,264
Do one thing, hire an
auto and send him.

1003
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:19,745
Hey, I’m telling you to call
him, you're telling him to go!

1004
00:50:19,805 --> 00:50:21,745
Hey, call him now. - Go, go and
tell at the police station

1005
00:50:21,805 --> 00:50:26,145
that a girl is dead in your bedroom
to your father-in-law, a policeman.

1006
00:50:26,205 --> 00:50:27,425
He will say, come
on bridegroom

1007
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:31,224
let’s have the marriage today and
he will give the nuptial thread.

1008
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:32,205
You...

1009
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:33,764
Turn back.

1010
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,545
You said, you don’t
know that girl, right?

1011
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:37,925
What’s that lipstick
below the neck?

1012
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,664
Hey, Thamizini came
in the morning.

1013
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:42,885
Did Thamizini come?

1014
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,924
Did you see her? - No, dude.
I didn’t see.

1015
00:50:46,524 --> 00:50:47,465
Hey, tell the truth.

1016
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,565
Hey, you were sleeping.

1017
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:51,225
I swear!

1018
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:53,304
That's not acceptable,
tell her to come.

1019
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:54,945
Ask her to kiss at the
same place for both of us.

1020
00:50:55,005 --> 00:50:56,844
If it matches, then
it's Thamizini's kiss.

1021
00:50:57,924 --> 00:50:59,105
Don’t play!

1022
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:01,085
Who is playing? I’m
talking seriously.

1023
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:03,365
Hey, AJ! Bring all your mobiles.

1024
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,525
Go. - Why is he asking the phone?

1025
00:51:06,245 --> 00:51:09,845
Hey, cockroach! where
is your phone?

1026
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,044
Is sir in recording?

1027
00:51:13,245 --> 00:51:15,285
Hey, switch it on.
- Here it is.

1028
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:16,569
Take it.

1029
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:18,849
What's there for him to sing when
washing vessels,

1030
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,285
amidst all problems?

1031
00:51:21,605 --> 00:51:22,569
The song has stopped.

1032
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:25,284
This is his phone.

1033
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:32,385
36 missed calls!

1034
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:35,544
Hey, if I don't pick up a
call, she will bombard me.

1035
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:36,944
Don't know, what is she
waiting to do now!

1036
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:38,569
She is betraying you, right?

1037
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:39,684
Shut up and wait.

1038
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,965
It started!

1039
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:47,344
Hey, none of the
phones has new number.

1040
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,444
Not in any of the phones?

1041
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:51,085
Then, take your phone.

1042
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:53,925
Hey. - Take it.

1043
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:55,963
Why are you hesitating?

1044
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:08,925
Hey, no new number
in your phone too.

1045
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:13,224
Dude, think like this!

1046
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:17,945
Someone who are enemity to us,
would've murdered her and left here.

1047
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:18,925
Think well.

1048
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:23,265
Dude, I opened the door, hearing
the calling bell, in the morning.

1049
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:24,771
How did the murderer come inside,

1050
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,265
left the corpse and went
locking the door inside.

1051
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:27,505
Then, who locked the door?

1052
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:30,523
How do I know, when sloshed?

1053
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,524
Why is it confusing?

1054
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:38,405
Dude, that girl would've crossed
the security to come inside.

1055
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:40,424
Shall we check the CCTV footage?

1056
00:52:40,484 --> 00:52:41,765
How smart is he thinking?

1057
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:44,244
You’re right! - Go, dude.

1058
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:01,284
Take it... take it.
Take it, dude.

1059
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:02,564
Oh, no!

1060
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:11,364
You proved, if we believe the
relatives,

1061
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:12,884
we will be left on streets.

1062
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:18,569
Gooogle is there, isn't it?

1063
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:21,404
I forgot him, in hurry.

1064
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:24,984
Hey, Google!

1065
00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:27,371
Hey, though
I'm not your own brother,

1066
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:29,024
I'm telling you like
your brother, listen me.

1067
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,865
Many people told me not
to believe a friend.

1068
00:53:31,925 --> 00:53:34,505
Since I didn't listen,
I'm suffering like this.

1069
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:38,569
Who is a friend, coming to booze
and chitchat. That's all.

1070
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:39,785
Dude, an idea.

1071
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:40,569
What, dude?

1072
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:42,084
Shall we toss and check?

1073
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:45,204
Just now I thought, you've sense.
That's my mistake.

1074
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:50,384
Is the IPL match going
on to decide by toss?

1075
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:52,569
I'll hit you. Be quiet.

1076
00:53:53,885 --> 00:53:56,825
If we see the CCTV footage, we will
know who is the accused, right?

1077
00:53:56,885 --> 00:54:00,569
Yes, among four of us, It'll
definitely find who is the accused.

1078
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,569
He isn't back yet...

1079
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:07,164
How to manage him?
- Delivery boy is not here.

1080
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,384
I don't want, you go.

1081
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:15,705
I've headache. - Don, take it.

1082
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:16,985
I don't want, leave me.

1083
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:23,385
Don, it's not the usual coffee, it's
prepared with ginger and herbs

1084
00:54:23,445 --> 00:54:25,925
brought from
Koyambedu market.

1085
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:30,425
Yes, it's herbal coffee.

1086
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:32,569
Go out and see what happened.

1087
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:33,825
Go now.

1088
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:35,784
Hey, go now!

1089
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:38,224
Not letting me to have a coffee.

1090
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:39,864
Irritating as herbal coffee
and porcupine coffee.

1091
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:41,264
Don, take it.

1092
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:45,305
Prepared with ginger
and herbs, take it.

1093
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,504
We are in trouble, what’s the
need for varieties of herbs?

1094
00:54:48,564 --> 00:54:50,465
Go away. Go inside.

1095
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:54,045
Don, since morning it was like
someone is doing a concert.

1096
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:56,145
Now, I feel free.

1097
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:59,105
Hey, don’t you know what
happened since morning?

1098
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,105
What happened?

1099
00:55:00,165 --> 00:55:02,025
Nothing happened, you go inside.

1100
00:55:02,085 --> 00:55:03,025
Brother, it's okay. Tell me.

1101
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:04,344
Hey, you go inside, please.

1102
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:05,225
What will it be?

1103
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,569
Don't know what's
going to happen?

1104
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:08,569
Brother! - What, brother.

1105
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:11,004
Last night! - Dude, come here.

1106
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:14,465
Dude, I thought no
one has noticed.

1107
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:17,145
Last night, I had been to 3rd
Street for an important work.

1108
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:19,464
I returned back at
morning 5 o'clock only.

1109
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,569
Don't inform the secretary
and cause problem to my job.

1110
00:55:23,684 --> 00:55:26,569
Brother, where will
be the CCTV room key?

1111
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:28,136
Till yesterday, it was with me.

1112
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:29,449
The secretary took the
keys from me just now.

1113
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,325
Why are you asking, dude?

1114
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,104
Hey, uncle! - What?

1115
00:55:46,164 --> 00:55:47,064
Hey, the police!

1116
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:48,569
Brother, I’ll come back.
- Okay, dude.

1117
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:49,925
Oh, no! The police?

1118
00:55:57,405 --> 00:55:59,024
Dude, the police has come.

1119
00:55:59,084 --> 00:56:00,504
What? Has the police come?

1120
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:02,984
Do they knew that the girl is dead?
- No, dude.

1121
00:56:03,044 --> 00:56:04,904
Anbu's father-in-law has come.
- Both are same.

1122
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:06,425
Come, let us hide.

1123

Musical line from
the film "VISWASAM"

1124
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:11,985
Hey, I'll hit you...

1125
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,025
Shut up and come.

1126
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:13,584
Sir!

1127
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:14,569
Where are you dragging?

1128
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:15,504
Hey, Anbu's uncle has come.

1129
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:16,464
There is no milk to
serve him a coffee.

1130
00:56:16,524 --> 00:56:18,084
Come, you senseless.
- Why are you tensed?

1131
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:21,305
Hey, you stay here.
Don't come out.

1132
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:22,569
Hey, fraud Don.

1133
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:25,224
Oh, no! he has found
out, it seems.

1134
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:27,643
Hey, who is this babe? - Is she?

1135
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:29,265
That is...

1136
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:30,569
Is this what has
happening since morning?

1137
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:31,405
Hey!

1138
00:56:31,884 --> 00:56:33,744
Who is this? - That is…

1139
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:35,225
I know. - What?

1140
00:56:35,285 --> 00:56:38,825
She is Anbu's would- be, right?
- Yes, she is Anbu’s would- be.

1141
00:56:38,885 --> 00:56:42,569
Why is she lying here? - She has
got fever, that's why lying.

1142
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,624
I know. Like us, she
is sloshed, right?

1143
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:47,824
Yes, she is sloshed
and sleeping.

1144
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,145
Hey, it's not right.

1145
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,505
Hey, I didn't do any mistake.

1146
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:52,824
Her dad is coming, if he
look her daughter sloshed,

1147
00:56:52,884 --> 00:56:53,985
How angry will he be!

1148
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:55,564
Shall I be here and
take care of her?

1149
00:56:56,885 --> 00:56:58,569
Hey, my dear! you said it right.

1150
00:56:58,831 --> 00:56:59,904
You look after the girl.

1151
00:56:59,964 --> 00:57:01,105
Don't come out. - Okay.

1152
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:04,164
I'll put my attire over here
and guard her. - Okay, dude.

1153
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:08,124
Anbu...

1154
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:11,325
Anbu...

1155
00:57:13,884 --> 00:57:14,385
Uncle!

1156
00:57:14,445 --> 00:57:16,865
Where did you go, without
even locking the door?

1157
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:18,824
Uncle, I went to super market.

1158
00:57:18,884 --> 00:57:20,205
To super market?

1159
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:22,884
I forgot the wallet.

1160
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:28,204
The house is maintained neat.

1161
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:35,165
Is this VIP here?

1162
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:44,484
Momo, have you settled here?

1163
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:57,904
Thamizini told me your uncle
has come from home town.

1164
00:57:57,964 --> 00:57:59,364
Where is he, not seen?

1165
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:04,525
He has gone to the temple.

1166
00:58:04,884 --> 00:58:07,125
Has he went to the temple?

1167
00:58:07,644 --> 00:58:08,784
Uncle, that's store room.

1168
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:10,464
What? - Waste things are kept.

1169
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:12,324
Store room? - It will
be full of dust.

1170
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,344
This door is jammed, uncle.

1171
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,284
Can't open it since morning.

1172
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:20,924
Uncle, coffee? - Come, please.

1173
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:22,205
Uncle!

1174
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:24,569
The door is opened.

1175
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:29,225
Uncle, the door was locked.

1176
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:32,569
But now, I don’t know how!
- Come on.

1177
00:58:33,403 --> 00:58:35,304
Where are they?

1178
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:37,205
Nobody is seen.

1179
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,325
From the moment I arrived,

1180
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,043
I notice that you're tensioned.

1181
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:43,665
Is it me, Uncle? No, not at all.

1182
00:58:43,725 --> 00:58:44,924
I'm as usual.

1183
00:58:50,124 --> 00:58:51,905
Thamizini was saying
for a long time.

1184
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:53,504
But, I don't have time.

1185
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:58,265
My daughter is going to live in
this house, so came to have a look.

1186
00:58:58,325 --> 00:59:00,485
Is that so, uncle?

1187
00:59:01,244 --> 00:59:03,905
The house looks good, I like it.

1188
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:05,005
What’s that sound?

1189
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:10,569
Uncle, that's nothing,
Momo pushed the vessel.

1190
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:17,784
Shall I make coffee for you?

1191
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:18,984
No...no...

1192
00:59:19,044 --> 00:59:20,325
I'm leaving.

1193
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,465
Hereafter, when you
go for purchase,

1194
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:26,465
Don't forget to
take your wallet.

1195
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:27,965
Okay, uncle.

1196
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:32,204
What is he talking, not knowing
about a corpse in the house?

1197
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:35,124
He has left.

1198
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:41,184
Hey, who asked you to fall in
love with a policeman's daughter?

1199
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,569
Didn’t you get any other girl?

1200
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:43,664
Leave it.

1201
00:59:43,724 --> 00:59:44,865
What did you do with the corpse?

1202
00:59:44,925 --> 00:59:46,464
That is kept under
the table, safely.

1203
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:47,664
How about Pandi?

1204
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:49,464
He is also along with the dead body.
Leave that.

1205
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:51,545
Hey, did you see the footage?

1206
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:54,024
Those keys are with the
secretary, it seems.

1207
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:55,764
Is it with the secretary?

1208
00:59:56,831 --> 01:00:00,065
Corpse is in the house,
your uncle is a policeman.

1209
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,664
Your engagement is
at tomorrow morning!

1210
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:02,569
What to do, now?

1211
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,245
Looks your father is still here.

1212
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:06,569
Hey, did you trim your eyebrows?

1213
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:07,884
Looking smart.

1214
01:00:08,524 --> 01:00:09,864
Hey, I'm talking but
you're keeping quiet.

1215
01:00:09,924 --> 01:00:11,745
While talking, you stay quiet,

1216
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:13,183
You're looking awesome,

1217
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,025
You will be happy,
getting married to Anbu.

1218
01:00:15,085 --> 01:00:17,664
Anbu, till your engagement gets
over, we will hide the corpse.

1219
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:19,625
Thereafter, we will
think what to do.

1220
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:21,144
Shall we keep the corpse
inside the fridge,

1221
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:22,305
till the engagement gets over?

1222
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,425
In Aynavaram bridge
or Royapuram bridge?

1223
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:26,064
Hey, I said the
refrigerator in kitchen.

1224
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:29,184
Keeping just eight beer bottles in
this refrigerator is a big deal.

1225
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:30,463
You’re telling to keep
the corpse in it!

1226
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:31,664
Is your brain is in the knee?

1227
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:33,744
I have an idea, Why can't
we keep it in your mansion?

1228
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:34,424
Good idea.

1229
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:36,024
On the way to the mansion,
is your house, right?

1230
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:39,103
We place the corpse in center of
the house, mourn and dispose.

1231
01:00:39,163 --> 01:00:40,063
You senseless.

1232
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:43,903
Hey, you go to the site
and get a big saw.

1233
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:46,064
We will split the corpse
into four and dispose.

1234
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:48,984
Hey, the one who died is a
girl, feel pity for her.

1235
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:50,505
Yes, did I deny?

1236
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:52,569
Hey, why don’t we keep
it in Pandi's car boot?

1237
01:00:52,831 --> 01:00:54,464
Tell something practical.

1238
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:55,504
Shall we burn the corpse
in the graveyard?

1239
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:57,024
Where is the graveyard, now?

1240
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:59,145
It's electric crematorium and
they're asking for aadhar card.

1241
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:01,065
If it's an orphan corpse,
they ask for certificates.

1242
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:02,771
Autopsy report and
other certificates.

1243
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:04,085
Then, all three of
us will get caught.

1244
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:10,076
Hey!

1245
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,250
Hey, who is that? - Uncle!

1246
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,076
Oh no! The dead
girl's uncle is here.

1247
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,812
If he sees us, he'll ask
for money, run away.

1248
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:18,992
Go away from here.
- How many uncles will come?

1249
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:21,031
Hey... hey...

1250
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:25,531
Uncle, please come in.

1251
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:27,292
What come in?

1252
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:30,076
How many times I've to call you?
- Phone was in silent mode, uncle.

1253
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:31,346
Thank God!

1254
01:01:31,406 --> 01:01:34,076
If Google wasn't here, I'd
be loitering in city like a beggar.

1255
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:36,076
Who is that, uncle?

1256
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:38,076
Google is in this, right?

1257
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:40,491
Do you mean Google?

1258
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:45,412
The house is neat and clean.
Where's the washroom?

1259
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:47,931
Inside, uncle.

1260
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:51,172
Don't get anything to eat,
already I've stomach upset.

1261
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:53,492
Don't know what he is going to do?
- Maintaining very well.

1262
01:01:53,552 --> 01:01:54,972
How will be the washroom?

1263
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:57,631
Greetings! are you fine? - Fine.

1264
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:01,792
Who is he? Inviting as if
to have marriage feast.

1265
01:02:02,032 --> 01:02:03,052
Friend, uncle.

1266
01:02:03,112 --> 01:02:04,076
Dirty friend.

1267
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:05,937
He's using toilet without closing
the door, Wonder,

1268
01:02:05,997 --> 01:02:07,512
you've friends like him?

1269
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:15,352
Why are you staring, as if you've
taken the toilet on lease?

1270
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,152
Where is he?

1271
01:02:28,551 --> 01:02:30,032
Where did he go away?

1272
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:34,812
Instead of having a few pegs
and eating omelettes...

1273
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:37,572
I fell for free drinks at party and
got trapped with a murder case.

1274
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:39,891
Sindoor was spilled on the head,
people might think it's bald.

1275
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:40,872
Hey!

1276
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:44,372
Uncle, I didn't kill him. Don't
send me to prison, uncle.

1277
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:45,931
The one with beard is the agent.
- Dude, it's me!

1278
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:46,731
Is it him?

1279
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:48,751
Damn faced!

1280
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:52,076
Has the police taken Anbu?

1281
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:55,492
No, his uncle has
come for engagement.

1282
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:57,231
Did his uncle come?

1283
01:02:57,792 --> 01:03:00,732
No use of fearing, anymore.

1284
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:02,431
We've to put an end to this.

1285
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,991
Nephew! - Uncle.

1286
01:03:10,072 --> 01:03:13,092
Why is he taking out a list?

1287
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:16,771
I want to see MGR, Jayalalitha
and Karunanidhi's memorials.

1288
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:19,392
And watch a Hollywood
movie in Sathyam Theatre.

1289
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:21,571
One more important thing.
- Tell me, uncle.

1290
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,011
Where is actress
Nayanthara's house?

1291
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:24,451
I want to take a photo with her.

1292
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:26,971
If I don't take a photo coming
this far, won't she feel dejected?

1293
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:28,076
Indeed!

1294
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:31,412
Google, I want to go to
Jayalalitha's memorial.

1295
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:33,372
Okay, Google.

1296
01:03:33,432 --> 01:03:36,691
I believe only you,
not even my wife.

1297
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:39,092
You know that I like
only country chicken.

1298
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:40,032
Get it ready.

1299
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:41,911
Country chicken?

1300
01:03:42,338 --> 01:03:44,322
Who is asking, amidst
all this problems.

1301
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:48,110
Dude,
we can't live in constant fear.

1302
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,252
Everyone is scaring us.

1303
01:03:49,312 --> 01:03:50,431
All of us will escape at a time.

1304
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:53,052
My life is just
settling down now.

1305
01:03:53,112 --> 01:03:54,571
Somehow, let's dispose the body.

1306
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,853
Please, help me.
- No way, let's go.

1307
01:03:57,072 --> 01:03:58,451
Hey, stop!

1308
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:02,076
Are you trying to trap me in
murder case that you've committed?

1309
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,439
I thought of never getting
trapped again with friends.

1310
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:06,351
There's no one foolish than me.

1311
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,230
If anyone of you leave, I'll inform
the police that you're the killers.

1312
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,849
What? Did we kill?

1313
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,204
What are you saying?
- Hey!

1314
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:14,931
You committed the murder,

1315
01:04:14,991 --> 01:04:17,031
to cover it up,
invited us for a party,

1316
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,732
trying to trap us
with the police now?

1317
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:19,891
What are you doing?

1318
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:21,493
Why do you want to
go to the police?

1319
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:23,092
Come on guys,
let's go to the police.

1320
01:04:23,152 --> 01:04:25,572
You idiot! Even if we
go, we'll get caught.

1321
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:27,811
At last showed that
you're damn cheap, right?

1322
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:31,010
Who is damn cheap?
- You guys!

1323
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:34,076
Hey, hit him!

1324
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:36,692
Leave him!

1325
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,076
Hey, listen to me.

1326
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:39,511
I'll not leave you.

1327
01:04:40,392 --> 01:04:42,587
Don't hold my neck.
- Leave him I say!

1328
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,972
It's you done the murder,
but should we get caught?

1329
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,335
I'll hit you.

1330
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:50,535
What's that noise?

1331
01:04:50,935 --> 01:04:54,061
Wait here, I'll check if
your father has gone.

1332
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:55,815
She isn't closing her eyes.

1333
01:04:56,819 --> 01:04:59,316
Hey, leave my neck.
- Why are you like unsold sandwich?

1334
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:01,076
I told him in the morning.

1335
01:05:01,136 --> 01:05:01,715
Get down, guys.

1336
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:03,635
Hey, you cattle shed, sit here.

1337
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,016
I didn't say this.

1338
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:09,528
Okay, why were you fighting now?

1339
01:05:10,922 --> 01:05:11,836
He will tell, you keep quiet.

1340
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:14,660
Yes, I know.

1341
01:05:14,793 --> 01:05:16,935
You're hungry, right? That's
why fighting among yourselves?

1342
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:19,016
Yes.

1343
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,836
Wait, I'll get juice for you.

1344
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:25,616
The cylinder which bursts somewhere
doesn't burst when he switch on,

1345
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,956
Hey...
- What?

1346
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,255
No use in fighting
among ourselves.

1347
01:05:30,656 --> 01:05:33,296
One among of us must've
committed this murder.

1348
01:05:33,936 --> 01:05:35,936
No time to find who did it!

1349
01:05:36,135 --> 01:05:38,015
If people come to know
about the corpse,

1350
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:39,815
It's the end for all four of us.

1351
01:05:40,922 --> 01:05:41,975
What to do now?

1352
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:46,376
Let's join together
and hide the corpse.

1353
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:48,336
No choice other than this.

1354
01:05:48,922 --> 01:05:51,776
What about Pandi then?

1355
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:53,856
He's going in his own way.

1356
01:05:54,056 --> 01:05:56,195
Even if police don't inquire, he'll
go and tell everything on his own.

1357
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:57,721
Don't tell him anything,
voluntarily.

1358
01:05:57,781 --> 01:05:58,790
You senseless.

1359
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:03,155
Hey, my uncle has a brick kiln.

1360
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:06,516
Let's burn this corpse
and take bath. What do you say?

1361
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:07,116
Where is it?

1362
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,476
Walajabad.

1363
01:06:08,536 --> 01:06:09,996
Walajabad?

1364
01:06:10,056 --> 01:06:11,756
Will it work out?

1365
01:06:11,816 --> 01:06:12,996
100% sure, it will.

1366
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,615
You do what I said. go...

1367
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,787
I didn't tell him anything,
what is he going to do?

1368
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:20,186
How can we dispose the
corpse, trusting him?

1369
01:06:20,246 --> 01:06:22,054
Hey, come here.

1370
01:06:23,325 --> 01:06:25,776
What's it, dude?
- Got a pen and paper? write down.

1371
01:06:38,502 --> 01:06:42,123
If Pandi asks, we have to tell him
that we go to Vallakottai temple.

1372
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:44,483
But, I conveyed everything
to my uncle in Walajabad.

1373
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:47,523
Hey, neck.
- Take this, tie now.

1374
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:48,743
Come on, tie it quickly.
- Give me.

1375
01:06:49,062 --> 01:06:50,483
Hey, lift and hold it.

1376
01:06:50,543 --> 01:06:53,787
He is telling, isn't it?
Lift it.

1377
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:56,442
How to go so long
trusting this car?

1378
01:06:56,502 --> 01:06:58,163
We will get caught if it
stops at toll, suddenly.

1379
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,787
But, why is this pink saree?

1380
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:02,872
Apartment CCTV camera
would've recorded the

1381
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:04,103
entry of a woman in pink saree,
right?

1382
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:04,562
Yes.

1383
01:07:04,622 --> 01:07:06,963
The CCTV must record the same
woman going out, isn't it?

1384
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,682
That's why, shut your
trap and do your work.

1385
01:07:08,742 --> 01:07:11,262
He doesn't know anything,
but gets angry when said.

1386
01:07:13,782 --> 01:07:16,082
Switch of the cell phone.

1387
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:17,202
Just one message only.

1388
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:18,623
I'll throw it away.

1389
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:37,443
Thought, you'd
bring like a girl,

1390
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:39,423
but bringing like a
textile shop mannequin.

1391
01:07:40,942 --> 01:07:42,162
Hey, you get lost!

1392
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:43,787
Don't talk like that.

1393
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:45,662
Look at his swag, like
North Indian Nagma.

1394
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,282
High heels footwear too.

1395
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:51,162
AJ, don't forget the camera
mark and watchman look.

1396
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:52,542
Okay.
- Hide the moustache...

1397
01:07:53,263 --> 01:07:53,960
Hide the moustache...

1398
01:07:54,662 --> 01:07:55,183
Go.

1399
01:07:56,063 --> 01:07:58,602
Hey! - Why are you calling her?

1400
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,787
Come here. - Oh, no!

1401
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,787
You look like a
bulldozer in saree.

1402
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:05,343
Anbu, your would-be was like
an angel in the morning.

1403
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:07,787
Now, looks like an
haphazardly tied gunny bag.

1404
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:09,263
Would he find out the truth?

1405
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,917
I've an advice for
you as a brother.

1406
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,522
You can hide the mistakes to your
husband, committed before marriage

1407
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:16,643
Can you booze along
with your husband?

1408
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:18,462
Take it... drink it.

1409
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:20,723
Why are your hands so hairy?

1410
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:22,202
Take it.

1411
01:08:22,262 --> 01:08:23,787
The groom is ready for marriage.

1412
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:24,822
He too irates...

1413
01:08:25,182 --> 01:08:28,302
Be at least little
good to your husband.

1414
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,643
It was me!

1415
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:31,742
I thought wild
elephant was dropping.

1416
01:08:32,063 --> 01:08:33,462
You go. - Go carefully.

1417
01:08:33,522 --> 01:08:34,702
You may get better.

1418
01:08:36,702 --> 01:08:40,244
If he believed it, then everyone
in apartment would believe it.

1419
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:41,763
Hey, your bag.

1420
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:42,963
All the best.

1421
01:08:43,023 --> 01:08:44,862
Yeah, I'm going to
take NEET exam.

1422
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:48,042
I'm the secretary for namesake
only, no on cares to listen to me.

1423
01:08:48,102 --> 01:08:50,322
Something hit me now but
I don't see anything.

1424
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:51,696
Secretary! Escape from here!

1425
01:08:52,422 --> 01:08:53,663
Who are you?

1426
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:54,402
I asked you a question,

1427
01:08:54,462 --> 01:08:56,223
why are you walking
away without answering me?

1428
01:08:56,502 --> 01:08:59,602
I'm under veil, right?
That's why, I didn't heed.

1429
01:08:59,662 --> 01:09:01,502
You can heed me now, right?
Answer me.

1430
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:05,943
I came here to see if there's
any vacant flat here.

1431
01:09:06,023 --> 01:09:07,612
No vacant flat here.

1432
01:09:07,828 --> 01:09:09,963
That's why, I'm leaving.
- Okay, then.

1433
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:12,543
Don't know, what for she came
here and why is she leaving?

1434
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:15,423
Very strong body!

1435
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:22,013
The camera has marked me.

1436
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:31,965
Who is she? looking chubby!
- Watchman too noted.

1437
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:34,603
Mam, please buy flowers.

1438
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:37,383
You keep quiet.
- Why don't you buy flowers, mam?

1439
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,521
A babe I had seen in long
skirt and half saree...

1440
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:45,462
As fragrance of
flower pervades...

1441
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,242
Dude, Kumar told about a
pink saree woman, right?

1442
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:53,182
That's her!

1443
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,583
Move!

1444
01:09:58,102 --> 01:09:59,910
Stop.

1445
01:10:01,259 --> 01:10:03,285
What's this bag?

1446
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:07,134
You don't tell anything,
he'll answer by himself.

1447
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,461
Tell me. - Bag of onions, right?

1448
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:13,083
Yes, onions bag. - Yes, onions.

1449
01:10:13,537 --> 01:10:16,182
Where are you taking
the onions bag?

1450
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:18,342
He'll ask us to reply for this.

1451
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,962
I don't know the answer.
Answer yourself.

1452
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:21,587
I told you, right?

1453
01:10:21,735 --> 01:10:25,862
Anbu's father died while
loading onions in hot sun.

1454
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:29,483
So, we're offering it
to temple as a vow.

1455
01:10:29,543 --> 01:10:32,482
Don! Know a thing very well.
- What's it?

1456
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:35,863
Nobody can cheat me!

1457
01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:36,823
Got it? - Right.

1458
01:10:37,263 --> 01:10:39,262
You can't cheat anyone.

1459
01:10:39,423 --> 01:10:42,102
Go inside and wash vessels...
Go...

1460
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,734
I've power of 100 lemons in
my hands,

1461
01:10:43,794 --> 01:10:45,803
I'll wash it with hands, come.
- Okay,

1462
01:10:47,154 --> 01:10:47,862
go.

1463
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:49,587
Sea horse faced!

1464
01:10:50,343 --> 01:10:53,203
He went out but
didn't turn up yet.

1465
01:10:53,263 --> 01:10:54,682
Don't know what he's up to!

1466
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:58,343
I can't take it anymore.
- I must see all entrants, clearly.

1467
01:10:58,582 --> 01:11:01,102
I'm checking it, right?
Please wait, sir.

1468
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:02,201
Who are you?

1469
01:11:02,261 --> 01:11:03,587
Why are you walking like
you've stamped on dirt?

1470
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:05,242
Just a while ago, a
woman came here, right?

1471
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,162
Yes, she was about your height,
clad in a pink saree, right?

1472
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:08,962
Her husband. - Is it? Okay, go.

1473
01:11:09,022 --> 01:11:10,723
Thank God, he missed
by seeing my height.

1474
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:11,323
What's it?

1475
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:17,523
DDR, Internal hard disk and entire
unit got burnt due to short circuit.

1476
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:18,562
You must throw this in dust bin.

1477
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:20,962
What about the old footage?
- I said, it got short circuited.

1478
01:11:21,022 --> 01:11:23,263
Did you make me act
before a broken camera?

1479
01:11:23,382 --> 01:11:27,222
I don't mind about the cost, all
cameras must work in 30 minutes.

1480
01:11:27,342 --> 01:11:28,843
Why does an odd smell emanates?

1481
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:32,223
Hey, Pandi! Is anything
charring inside? It's stenchy.

1482
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:35,323
Do you heed me? Are you there
or slept inside the fridge?

1483
01:11:35,383 --> 01:11:37,045
He sleeps iinside the
fridge if it's hot

1484
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:38,943
and keep his leg on stove if cold.

1485
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,363
Why are you walking like
the opened gates of VGP?

1486
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,782
What happened? Come on, tell me.

1487
01:11:47,263 --> 01:11:49,223
What to tell you?

1488
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:53,542
I said no, but he
keeps on insisting.

1489
01:11:54,262 --> 01:11:55,883
Don't tell me after
this, I got it.

1490
01:11:55,943 --> 01:11:56,563
Wait, I'll get coconut oil.

1491
01:11:56,623 --> 01:12:00,162
Hey, nothing happened
as you think.

1492
01:12:00,222 --> 01:12:03,587
After knowing I'm a male,
they said sorry and left.

1493
01:12:03,982 --> 01:12:04,863
What to say for this?

1494
01:12:05,022 --> 01:12:07,582
Leave that. Did
my idea work out?

1495
01:12:07,942 --> 01:12:09,183
Nobody got suspicious, right?

1496
01:12:09,502 --> 01:12:12,003
Go to hell with your idea.

1497
01:12:12,063 --> 01:12:12,543
Why?

1498
01:12:12,622 --> 01:12:16,222
It seems CCTV is not working
for many months now.

1499
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,522
Isn't CCTV not working!
- Useless idea!

1500
01:12:19,582 --> 01:12:21,587
Why CCTV isn't working
in many places?

1501
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:22,683
Okay, why are you sitting here?

1502
01:12:22,743 --> 01:12:24,963
Go, take a bath with
Sabena cleaning powder.

1503
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:29,062
I said nothing happened, right?
- Take bath and wear fresh attires.

1504
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:37,063
I'm still having doubt.

1505
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:38,863
He says nothing happened there.

1506
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,663
But, why is he
walking like that?

1507
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:44,223
Looks like he got caught.

1508
01:12:44,743 --> 01:12:47,587
Hey, take this bag
too and wash it.

1509
01:12:48,183 --> 01:12:50,062
Why did he buy a pain killer?

1510
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:53,587
It really happened then!

1511
01:13:03,222 --> 01:13:03,903
Sir!

1512
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:06,082
Hey, sit down.

1513
01:13:06,142 --> 01:13:07,263
Enough of this.

1514
01:13:07,462 --> 01:13:09,843
You said to find the statue
in four days, what happened?

1515
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:12,663
It was my mistake to
accept your foolish idea.

1516
01:13:12,862 --> 01:13:15,523
Archeology department wants
us to return the statue.

1517
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:16,243
What should we do now?

1518
01:13:16,303 --> 01:13:19,263
As per my plan, I'm sure the
statue will come out, sir.

1519
01:13:19,423 --> 01:13:21,587
In a day or two, I'm
sure of finding it.

1520
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:22,462
Damn it.

1521
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:25,272
People in the dept. suspect
we're playing drama

1522
01:13:25,332 --> 01:13:27,462
by hiding the real statue.

1523
01:13:27,543 --> 01:13:30,202
It is not a normal
statue as we think.

1524
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:34,143
It's value in International
market is over 6 Billion.

1525
01:13:34,942 --> 01:13:36,042
Try to understand
the pressure on me.

1526
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:38,509
If not, give a statement
that you placed

1527
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:40,123
the fake statue due to
target failure

1528
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:41,343
And die.

1529
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,481
Don't be a pain to me.

1530
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,501
Okay, sir.

1531
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:46,003
I'm sorry, sir.

1532
01:13:46,063 --> 01:13:47,587
Sir!

1533
01:13:49,942 --> 01:13:53,222
Let me get hold of the statue,
I'll take you to task then.

1534
01:13:56,943 --> 01:13:59,587
Hey, why are you sitting?
- Whya are you staring?

1535
01:13:59,862 --> 01:14:02,263
Go and check downstairs.

1536
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:03,587
To get into trouble again?

1537
01:14:04,183 --> 01:14:05,083
Not like as you think.

1538
01:14:05,143 --> 01:14:06,163
Go, shouldn't we take the bag?

1539
01:14:06,223 --> 01:14:07,342
Go I say!

1540
01:14:11,263 --> 01:14:12,702
He's still walking
like that only.

1541
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:29,083
Super... super... super...
Watch out and hit, boy.

1542
01:14:29,143 --> 01:14:30,202
Watch and hit well!

1543
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,302
Hit a six!

1544
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:38,201
Why are you coming running? Has
the police arrived to the flat?

1545
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:39,843
They're playing a cricket
match downstairs.

1546
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:41,587
T20 or test?

1547
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:43,142
Wait, I'll inquire and come.

1548
01:14:43,302 --> 01:14:44,863
Hey, senseless! sit here.

1549
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,942
I'm sitting here with trouble,
playing cricket there.

1550
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,523
One is like that and
another is like this.

1551
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,587
Don't know where
the other one is!

1552
01:14:54,103 --> 01:14:56,501
I'm going through hell
trapped with such guys.

1553
01:14:56,862 --> 01:15:01,582
Don, I need mustard! Will
you go out and get it?

1554
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:06,583
I'll not go out.

1555
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:08,803
I'm asleep!

1556
01:15:08,863 --> 01:15:12,102
No, season it without mustard.
- Okay... okay.

1557
01:15:13,462 --> 01:15:15,483
Don't worry about mustard,

1558
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:17,587
Just see, how I'll pack
tamarind rice for temple.

1559
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:22,462
After disposing the corpse, I must
escape from these three people.

1560
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,587
How to take out the
corpse from this flat?

1561
01:15:27,143 --> 01:15:27,903
Let me think.

1562
01:15:39,343 --> 01:15:42,822
Don... Don...

1563
01:15:43,902 --> 01:15:44,742
Don... Don...

1564
01:15:45,022 --> 01:15:48,342
Deficit of cooking gas,
I can't cook anymore.

1565
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,022
Can you get a gas cylinder
from the neighbour?

1566
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,023
I'm preparing tamarind rice.

1567
01:15:54,262 --> 01:15:56,002
Will you get it?

1568
01:15:56,062 --> 01:15:58,222
I'll get it after I'm back.
- Okay... okay.

1569
01:15:58,863 --> 01:16:00,442
Why are you going
inside to get it?

1570
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:01,582
I'll not say anything.

1571
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,363
Hey, get up! Take the sac.

1572
01:16:04,423 --> 01:16:06,862
Wake him up too.

1573
01:16:07,849 --> 01:16:09,587
AJ... get up.
- Sleeping as if he is in the bus.

1574
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:10,903
It's 11.30 pm.

1575
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:14,542
Senseless. - Let's move.

1576
01:16:14,622 --> 01:16:16,582
I've to get you the
cylinder, right?

1577
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:27,587
Who is here at this hour?

1578
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,283
Who are you?

1579
01:16:29,343 --> 01:16:31,587
What? - Asking after
opening the door.

1580
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:33,883
Who is it?

1581
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:35,263
She's Thamizini.

1582
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:40,642
She is excellent like
Suzuki bike in salwar.

1583
01:16:40,702 --> 01:16:41,587
I must trap her.

1584
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:43,102
What's that bag?

1585
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:44,823
Why?

1586
01:16:45,062 --> 01:16:47,862
Onions bag.

1587
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:48,822
Onions?

1588
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:49,587
Why?

1589
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:50,982
To offer in temple.

1590
01:16:51,502 --> 01:16:53,587
Offering onions to temple?

1591
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:57,542
Girls offer garlands on
Monday and lamps on Thursday,

1592
01:16:57,849 --> 01:16:59,402
Shouldn't guys offer onions?

1593
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,462
Who is he? Servant?

1594
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:04,863
He is...
- Who is she? She's like Dora Bujji.

1595
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:08,823
No... he's my friend.

1596
01:17:08,982 --> 01:17:12,262
There's a better man than me
inside, shall I bring him?

1597
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,043
Who is he? Onion seller?

1598
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,083
Onion seller?

1599
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:23,442
He's also my friend.

1600
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:25,803
I told you about an old mansion,
where we stayed together.

1601
01:17:25,863 --> 01:17:26,542
Wastrel friends.

1602
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,082
Who is that playing
RR in washroom?

1603
01:17:35,142 --> 01:17:36,802
Don, please come out quickly.

1604
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:38,203
Cake has been delivered
from Zomato.

1605
01:17:38,263 --> 01:17:42,503
Hey, wastrel! Have I booked
Ola taxi and waiting for OTP?

1606
01:17:42,702 --> 01:17:44,231
If I come out, I'll insert a rod in

1607
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:46,602
your throat and make you
a grilled chicken.

1608
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,442
Grilled chicken?

1609
01:17:47,502 --> 01:17:48,281
Tortoise, run away!

1610
01:17:48,341 --> 01:17:52,362
Enough of getting furious, finish
delivery and come out quickly.

1611
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:53,542
I said go, I'll come.

1612
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:56,962
Bloody cockroach!

1613
01:17:57,022 --> 01:17:58,902
Why are you here at this time?

1614
01:18:02,703 --> 01:18:03,587
Why did you come now? Tell me.

1615
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:04,762
Surprise!

1616
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:06,802
Don't you know this too?
To meet me.

1617
01:18:06,862 --> 01:18:10,042
Hey, come here.

1618
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,843
Hey,dengue mosquito! that
girl is his fiancée.

1619
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:14,842
Then, the girl who came yesterday?
- His girlfriend.

1620
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:16,882
Then, the girl who came today?
- His fiancée.

1621
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,783
Then, who came running with him?
- You...

1622
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:22,842
At least he has a girl to love
and another girl to marry.

1623
01:18:22,902 --> 01:18:24,622
But, till my life ends...

1624
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:30,283
Okay, don't feel bad.

1625
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:32,103
Why? Are you also like me?

1626
01:18:32,223 --> 01:18:34,263
Get lost, goof!

1627
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:37,322
God, I'm not married
yet, so, I'm a bachelor.

1628
01:18:37,382 --> 01:18:39,221
Though he's married,
he's also a bachelor.

1629
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,663
At least, I'm driving a leaking car,
he's not driving a car he owns.

1630
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:45,587
Happy Birthday, Momo!

1631
01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:47,242
Match box, please.

1632
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:48,743
Match box?

1633
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:49,942
Take it.

1634
01:18:54,862 --> 01:18:56,802
Is it parrot's birthday?

1635
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:58,362
Yes.

1636
01:18:58,422 --> 01:19:02,482
Happy birthday, Momo!

1637
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:06,363
Happy birthday to you!

1638
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:14,263
Happy birthday to Momo!

1639
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:18,283
What's the noise there?
Did he slip into pan?

1640
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:20,682
How are we as a couple?

1641
01:19:20,742 --> 01:19:21,587
Why are you asking me?

1642
01:19:21,982 --> 01:19:23,203
I asked, how do we look?

1643
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:25,223
Looks like a fish in sambar!

1644
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,042
Who is sambar and
who is fish in it?

1645
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:31,242
Is it very important to know?

1646
01:19:31,302 --> 01:19:32,962
You leave now, come.
- Looks like creep in all angles.

1647
01:19:33,022 --> 01:19:33,587
Hey, give me.

1648
01:19:35,902 --> 01:19:37,102
Okay, bye.

1649
01:19:37,423 --> 01:19:39,363
Why are you sending her away? Why
not take her also to temple?

1650
01:19:39,423 --> 01:19:40,583
Don't kill me.

1651
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:46,602
What's this? Such a huge thibg
like feeding an elephant.

1652
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:48,903
Hey, it's Momo's birthday.

1653
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:51,883
Are you agent for birds
too along with artistes?

1654
01:19:51,943 --> 01:19:52,482
I'll hit you.

1655
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:56,883
I'll keep vigil outside,
Bring down the bag.

1656
01:19:56,943 --> 01:19:58,942
Understand? He nods
for whatever I say.

1657
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:07,963
Don! why are you watching CCTV?

1658
01:20:08,023 --> 01:20:10,162
We will watch the CCTV
but it won't capture us.

1659
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,342
Okay, come quickly, may
run out of tamarind rice.

1660
01:20:12,502 --> 01:20:14,048
I don't know if he's coming with us

1661
01:20:14,108 --> 01:20:16,034
after committing a murder
or to temple consecration.

1662
01:20:16,582 --> 01:20:18,342
Somehow, I trust this
car and getting in.

1663
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:19,983
Don!

1664
01:20:20,943 --> 01:20:22,803
Hey, come soon.

1665
01:20:22,863 --> 01:20:24,982
No one is here. - come quick.

1666
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:29,587
Why is he cleaning the glass?

1667
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:31,123
I think, he'll ask money
after cleaning it.

1668
01:20:31,183 --> 01:20:32,682
Hey, bean pole! come here.

1669
01:20:32,742 --> 01:20:35,062
You're scolding me for
cleaning the glass.

1670
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,463
Careful!

1671
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:42,182
Hey, keep it down.

1672
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:44,823
Close the door.

1673
01:20:51,849 --> 01:20:54,581
Don't drop it.

1674
01:20:57,343 --> 01:21:00,263
Where are you going
out with a bag?

1675
01:21:00,862 --> 01:21:01,482
Who is he?

1676
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:03,587
He looks like a
grinding machine guy!

1677
01:21:05,422 --> 01:21:07,082
Asked for onions in
the fuction hall.

1678
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:08,202
That's why...

1679
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:11,587
Will you need two people
to carry a bag of onions?

1680
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:12,363
Watch now!

1681
01:21:12,423 --> 01:21:14,663
How I'll lift it alone!

1682
01:21:17,943 --> 01:21:22,263
Why is he coming wantedly?

1683
01:21:24,543 --> 01:21:26,362
Why is it so heavy
like a dead body?

1684
01:21:26,422 --> 01:21:28,282
Oh, no! looks like he'll
find out the truth.

1685
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,363
Big oninons? - Big onions.

1686
01:21:30,423 --> 01:21:33,183
Okay, open the boot.

1687
01:21:36,663 --> 01:21:37,587
Careful, uncle.

1688
01:21:41,849 --> 01:21:43,587
Why are you dressed
up, differently?

1689
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:45,402
Going to bang Kerala drums.

1690
01:21:45,462 --> 01:21:47,243
Who the hell he is?
Knock him down I say!

1691
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,587
Nothing, just fulfilling
a temple vow, uncle.

1692
01:21:49,849 --> 01:21:50,482
We will go now.

1693
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:52,083
Vow? Okay, I'll also join you.

1694
01:21:52,143 --> 01:21:53,242
To collect broken coconuts?

1695
01:21:53,302 --> 01:21:55,162
Uncle, people are coming
from native place.

1696
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:56,482
Aunt is also coming.

1697
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,423
Then, stay here?
- People coming from native place?

1698
01:21:58,942 --> 01:22:01,102
Oh, no! - Yes.

1699
01:22:01,303 --> 01:22:03,003
Have to escape from him, first.

1700
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:04,722
She will take me to task.
- I'll go now, uncle.

1701
01:22:04,782 --> 01:22:06,403
Okay, go. - What
to talk with him?

1702
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,083
Come... come, fast.

1703
01:22:07,143 --> 01:22:09,963
We're going to
Vallakottai with it.

1704
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:11,523
Somehow, protect us!

1705
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:13,241
Lord Muruga of Vallakottai,
- Utter silently.

1706
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:14,803
What are you doing?
- They will protest if heard this.

1707
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:18,182
You look like an
experienced driver. - Me?

1708
01:22:18,342 --> 01:22:20,803
If you feel sleepy, pull
over and take a nap.

1709
01:22:20,863 --> 01:22:23,587
Night will be cooler,
use minimal AC.

1710
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:25,587
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Go...

1711
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,282
Steering is that side,
why is he advising me?

1712
01:22:28,342 --> 01:22:29,962
Who is he? - My maternal uncle.

1713
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:31,587
Why are you letting
this cat faced, inside?

1714
01:22:31,849 --> 01:22:32,802
Start the car.

1715
01:22:32,862 --> 01:22:35,562
Thank God! Don, nobody knows
about our visit, right?

1716
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:36,483
No one knows it.

1717
01:22:36,543 --> 01:22:38,282
That's why, we're going safely.

1718
01:22:38,342 --> 01:22:39,562
Sit tight, you start the car.

1719
01:22:39,849 --> 01:22:43,122
Lord Muruga!

1720
01:22:43,182 --> 01:22:45,062
He's torturing me!

1721
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:46,723
Lord Muruga!

1722
01:22:46,783 --> 01:22:47,882
He has started it again!

1723
01:22:47,942 --> 01:22:49,363
Hail Lord Kandhan!

1724
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,982
God, you've to save me.

1725
01:22:51,463 --> 01:22:52,563
Hail Lord Velan!

1726
01:22:52,623 --> 01:22:54,483
Many people are
waiting for my end.

1727
01:22:54,543 --> 01:22:55,203
Hail Lord Murugan!

1728
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:57,522
You're going to visit temple,
why not join the chant with him?

1729
01:22:57,582 --> 01:23:00,943
Salutations!

1730
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:04,762
Salutations!

1731
01:23:04,822 --> 01:23:07,242
Salutations!

1732
01:23:07,302 --> 01:23:09,082
Get in quickly.

1733
01:23:09,142 --> 01:23:11,587
No bad spirit will
dare to stop us.

1734
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:12,723
He is standing there already.

1735
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:15,022
Move aside. - Why can't
you get in from that side?

1736
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:20,763
Hey Ayyasamy...
- He's not in home.

1737
01:23:20,823 --> 01:23:22,361
Not in home? Sit tight.

1738
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:25,587
How God fearing
this generation is?

1739
01:23:32,102 --> 01:23:33,587
Hold it... go inside.

1740
01:23:37,028 --> 01:23:39,428
Hey, be careful with the stuff.
- Okay, boss.

1741
01:23:44,108 --> 01:23:46,148
Hail Lord Murugan!

1742
01:23:46,347 --> 01:23:48,908
Boss! Let's go after 10 minutes.

1743
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:52,188
Why? Is any auspicious
time arriving?

1744
01:23:52,388 --> 01:23:55,306
Ordered dosa in Swiggy.
let's take delivery and go.

1745
01:23:55,748 --> 01:23:56,708
Hey, you...

1746
01:23:58,148 --> 01:23:59,832
Start the vehicle.
- Okay, boss.

1747
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:04,307
If we go at night without
dinner, won't we feel hungry?

1748
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:11,367
Tell me, Sounder.
- The plan is perfect, KB.

1749
01:24:11,427 --> 01:24:12,762
It's enough if you come to

1750
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:14,708
the entrance
of Hotel Everest in Bangalore.

1751
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:17,187
I'm ready with the client
there, reach safely.

1752
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:21,832
I'm coming right to the place,
if you change any plan now

1753
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:24,768
you'll get food tomorrow but
you won't be there to eat.

1754
01:24:24,828 --> 01:24:25,832
Mind it. - Okay.

1755
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:28,208
The police checking is
strict, come carefully.

1756
01:24:28,268 --> 01:24:29,832
I'll take care of it,
hang up the call now.

1757
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:32,247
Ravi! - Boss!

1758
01:24:32,307 --> 01:24:34,287
Take left and hit the main road,
keep going straight and parallel.

1759
01:24:34,347 --> 01:24:34,847
Okay, boss.

1760
01:24:34,907 --> 01:24:37,546
If anyone asks to stop, don't
stop, I'll take care of it.

1761
01:24:39,027 --> 01:24:40,787
Any problem, boss?

1762
01:24:42,188 --> 01:24:43,347
What, boss?

1763
01:24:44,094 --> 01:24:46,547
I let you travel in the vehicle,
isn't it? That's the problem.

1764
01:24:52,107 --> 01:24:54,867
Don, I'm frustrated. - Why?

1765
01:24:55,308 --> 01:24:57,767
Our travel combination
is not right, Don.

1766
01:24:57,827 --> 01:25:00,087
You said it but I couldn't.

1767
01:25:00,147 --> 01:25:03,888
'Am I salt or sugar in
your kitchen?'

1768
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:05,687
He is so happy,
shall I tell him the truth?

1769
01:25:05,747 --> 01:25:08,148
Hey, keep quiet.

1770
01:25:12,147 --> 01:25:13,287
Don! - What?

1771
01:25:13,347 --> 01:25:17,247
They say ghosts haunt at night.
We are going with the dead.

1772
01:25:17,307 --> 01:25:19,028
Don't know how many
ghosts are after our car.

1773
01:25:20,307 --> 01:25:21,767
Are you scaring all of us?

1774
01:25:21,827 --> 01:25:22,568
Go to the back seat.

1775
01:25:22,628 --> 01:25:25,219
Anbu, go straight,
take right, go centre,

1776
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:27,368
take U- turn, take left,
take right and go straight.

1777
01:25:27,428 --> 01:25:30,168
Hey bat faced! Are we in
a marriage procession?

1778
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:32,048
To use lanes and by- lanes.

1779
01:25:32,108 --> 01:25:33,832
Don, don't talk without
knowing the situation.

1780
01:25:34,108 --> 01:25:35,447
If we take the main road, we
may get caught with police.

1781
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:37,527
That's why, I suggested interior
roads to go secretly and safely.

1782
01:25:37,587 --> 01:25:39,047
There is a truth
in what he says!

1783
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:41,027
Take the road he told you.

1784
01:25:41,267 --> 01:25:43,827
I ned to piss. Stop aside.

1785
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,428
Don... Don...

1786
01:25:48,548 --> 01:25:50,967
Ice cream cart is there, buy
me an ice cream, please.

1787
01:25:51,027 --> 01:25:53,708
Not ice cream, he pressed the horn.
Who asked you to press it?

1788
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:55,767
See, he is asking
for an ice cream.

1789
01:25:55,827 --> 01:25:57,832
Hey, senseless! driving
pressing something in this car.

1790
01:25:59,348 --> 01:26:00,347
AJ... AJ...

1791
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:04,548
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Do you've ginger candy?

1792
01:26:05,628 --> 01:26:06,308
Don't you have? - It seems
like police siren.

1793
01:26:06,588 --> 01:26:07,832
Police... police...

1794
01:26:09,188 --> 01:26:10,606
Go left... left...
go back... back...

1795
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,687
Come. - Please, listen to me.

1796
01:26:12,747 --> 01:26:13,567
Go that side.

1797
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,832
Don't go straight.

1798
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:17,648
Why did you go that side?
- Go fast...fast...

1799
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:19,008
Please, listen to me.
- Go... go...

1800
01:26:19,068 --> 01:26:21,832
You idiot! You could've
gone that side soon.

1801
01:26:22,788 --> 01:26:25,508
Oh no, it's dead end!
Be careful.

1802
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,608
I said dead end. - Dead end!

1803
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:29,307
Apply the brake!

1804
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,907
The police siren sound is heard.
I'll park the vehicle in this lane.

1805
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:37,627
Hey, another car
is coming behind.

1806
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:44,247
The siren sound.
The police has come.

1807
01:26:44,307 --> 01:26:44,945
Why did you get into this?

1808
01:26:45,005 --> 01:26:46,207
Another car is blocking
from behind.

1809
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,287
Fool, I said we can go
at the side of arch.

1810
01:26:48,347 --> 01:26:49,047
Why did you come this side?

1811
01:26:49,107 --> 01:26:49,832
What else then, Don?

1812
01:26:50,094 --> 01:26:51,832
If we go on the main road, who will
pay Rs.30 if caught by the police?

1813
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:52,847
Will you pay?

1814
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,847
Hey, I'm scolding him for
that money. Be quiet.

1815
01:26:54,907 --> 01:26:56,247
Police are checking intensely.

1816
01:26:56,307 --> 01:26:58,368
Get down and guide
to take reverse.

1817
01:26:58,428 --> 01:27:00,968
If I turn back and see, I
can see Thiruchendur also.

1818
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:02,148
Get down and see, go.

1819
01:27:02,428 --> 01:27:06,048
You send me for all errands, but
he sits here like a rock unmoved.

1820
01:27:06,108 --> 01:27:06,987
Keep quiet.

1821
01:27:11,507 --> 01:27:14,127
No change! - I'm not a beggar.

1822
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,447
I'm here to ask you
to reverse your car.

1823
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:17,207
Hello, there's a vehicle behind.

1824
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:19,527
Not the vehicle behind you, our
vehicle is in front of you.

1825
01:27:19,587 --> 01:27:22,167
You foolish man! See, there's
a vehicle behind mine.

1826
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,687
Hey, ask him to ride
removing his helmet.

1827
01:27:24,747 --> 01:27:26,187
Then, tell me anything.

1828
01:27:26,388 --> 01:27:29,627
We're losing respect because of you.
- God, you're testing us more.

1829
01:27:30,347 --> 01:27:32,207
Sir... sir...

1830
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:36,347
What is he watching at? Searching
the lost Vikramlander?

1831
01:27:45,188 --> 01:27:46,967
Cars are stranded there!

1832
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:48,327
What are you doing
in this vehicle?

1833
01:27:48,387 --> 01:27:49,748
Please, take your
vehicle, we will go.

1834
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:54,287
Why did you come to my zone?
- We came here inadvertently, sir.

1835
01:27:54,347 --> 01:27:56,708
If you take your vehicle,
we will go away.

1836
01:27:57,668 --> 01:28:00,507
Why did you come to my zone?
- Yuck! Get lost!

1837
01:28:00,828 --> 01:28:02,748
Do I've to tell
you, specifically?

1838
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:05,207
You too go and see. - Why?
What are you going to do?

1839
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:07,608
I can't tell you openly.

1840
01:28:07,668 --> 01:28:09,548
Get down. Close the door and go.

1841
01:28:11,747 --> 01:28:14,127
Oh, God! How many times will
you repeat the same dialogues?

1842
01:28:14,187 --> 01:28:15,832
Who is he? Looks like a
monkey escaped from zoo.

1843
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,286
What's the problem, Centipede?
- Get lost.

1844
01:28:18,346 --> 01:28:19,448
I'm terribly upset.

1845
01:28:19,508 --> 01:28:20,928
Sir, please take your vehicle.

1846
01:28:20,988 --> 01:28:23,447
Why did you come to my zone?

1847
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:26,127
The same dialogue!
- Sir, we came by mistake.

1848
01:28:26,187 --> 01:28:27,747
Please take your vehicle,
two vehicles has to go.

1849
01:28:28,868 --> 01:28:30,847
Why did you come to my zone?

1850
01:28:30,907 --> 01:28:33,288
Hey, cigar smoking blind
cat, take your vehicle away!

1851
01:28:33,348 --> 01:28:35,007
Listen carefully to me.

1852
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:37,328
Police have noted the
car colour also.

1853
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:38,468
Be careful.

1854
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:40,587
Sir, please don't
call me, hereafter.

1855
01:28:42,707 --> 01:28:44,088
Move, I'll ask him.

1856
01:28:44,148 --> 01:28:46,988
He has only one cigar, if you
ask it, what would he do?

1857
01:28:47,547 --> 01:28:49,832
Sir excuse me...

1858
01:28:50,147 --> 01:28:51,832
Phone...
Google map!

1859
01:28:52,094 --> 01:28:53,087
Wrong route, sir.

1860
01:28:53,147 --> 01:28:54,128
Dead end, sir.

1861
01:28:54,188 --> 01:28:55,608
You take reverse, sir.

1862
01:28:55,668 --> 01:28:56,686
Our car will go in reverse, sir.

1863
01:28:56,746 --> 01:28:58,687
Why did you come to my zone?

1864
01:28:58,747 --> 01:29:00,848
Who the hell he is? He's
speaking in English too.

1865
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:03,832
Sir, sir,
please take your car.

1866
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:06,867
Why did you come to my zone?

1867
01:29:06,987 --> 01:29:10,707
My stomach is upset, don't know
what did he use to season?

1868
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,427
Ramesh House.

1869
01:29:14,094 --> 01:29:15,027
Let it be.

1870
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:16,947
Let me go since it's urgency.

1871
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:24,627
No one here.

1872
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:31,188
Lord Muruga! Why are you
testing your devotee?

1873
01:29:31,748 --> 01:29:33,832
Hey, get down and lift the bag.
- Okay, boss.

1874
01:29:38,908 --> 01:29:41,708
Why did you come to my zone?

1875
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:42,766
Brother, you ask him.

1876
01:29:42,826 --> 01:29:44,272
Hey, wild elephant out on
conditional bail!

1877
01:29:44,332 --> 01:29:45,608
Will you take your car or not?

1878
01:29:45,668 --> 01:29:48,526
Musical line from
the film, "Bigil".

1879
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:49,308
Hey, ghost!

1880
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:51,248
Who is ghost?

1881
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:53,127
I'm the house owner.

1882
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:55,448
Orthodox traditional house, why
are you dirtying this place?

1883
01:29:55,508 --> 01:29:57,627
Sister, whether it is
orthodox house or anything,

1884
01:29:58,094 --> 01:29:58,947
if it is urgent one
has to take the leak.

1885
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:00,347
That's why, I did it, sister.

1886
01:30:01,388 --> 01:30:03,608
No water here, please
bring me some water.

1887
01:30:03,668 --> 01:30:04,947
Hey, stop!

1888
01:30:05,307 --> 01:30:07,127
Whether you took a
leak or used the pot?

1889
01:30:07,187 --> 01:30:08,907
It's a combo, sister.

1890
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:12,927
For urine it is Rs. 5,
for using pot Rs. 10.

1891
01:30:12,987 --> 01:30:14,747
Is it house or
Vellore bus stand?

1892
01:30:15,228 --> 01:30:16,407
Take it.

1893
01:30:16,467 --> 01:30:17,828
I don't have balance.

1894
01:30:18,188 --> 01:30:20,708
I'll come tomorrow...
Move.

1895
01:30:21,507 --> 01:30:23,832
Brother, the delivery is
over, can we go home?

1896
01:30:24,308 --> 01:30:25,832
Bloody! Shut up and
follow that vehicle.

1897
01:30:26,107 --> 01:30:27,832
My damn fate to let
you work for me.

1898
01:30:28,094 --> 01:30:29,348
Where did you come from?

1899
01:30:30,188 --> 01:30:31,148
Take the car.

1900
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:33,832
Why did you come to my zone?

1901
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:39,587
How come the car is moving?

1902
01:30:39,707 --> 01:30:40,367
The car is moving.

1903
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:42,228
Were you talking to him without
knowing who the driver is?

1904
01:30:42,387 --> 01:30:44,468
He was standing next to the car,
so I thought he owned the car.

1905
01:30:44,588 --> 01:30:45,747
Come, let's go.

1906
01:30:46,094 --> 01:30:47,787
Wait, I'll revenge you
after taking reverse.

1907
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,187
Hey, go home.

1908
01:30:50,748 --> 01:30:51,832
Why did you come to my zone?

1909
01:30:52,094 --> 01:30:56,427
If I see you in Tamil Nadu again...
- Why did you come to my zone?

1910
01:30:56,668 --> 01:30:57,668
Leave me, please.

1911
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:01,388
Why did you come to my zone?

1912
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,628
Hey, buffalo! I told you
to follow that car, right?

1913
01:31:18,094 --> 01:31:19,787
Boss, they're very slow.

1914
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,988
I didn't kill anyone till date,
don't force me to be a killer.

1915
01:31:23,268 --> 01:31:25,188
Shut up and do as I say, idiot.

1916
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:29,069
Good, our car is going
at 40 km/hr speed also.

1917
01:31:47,981 --> 01:31:49,547
Alert all the check posts.

1918
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,707
Don't let even a speck
of dust to pass.

1919
01:31:52,268 --> 01:31:55,188
Make it, fast.
- Okay, sir.

1920
01:31:58,628 --> 01:31:59,370
Hello!

1921
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:00,848
Sir! I'm Airtel
Manager Kumar here.

1922
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:01,448
Tell me, Kumar.

1923
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:04,388
I'm sending you the last phone
number called by Shalini.

1924
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:08,108
Call from that number lasted for 10
minutes with the missing girl, sir.

1925
01:32:09,628 --> 01:32:10,428
Okay, Kumar.

1926
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:13,832
I asked few more details from you.
When can I get it?

1927
01:32:13,983 --> 01:32:15,487
I'll send it in an hour, sir.

1928
01:32:15,547 --> 01:32:17,067
First locate the tower.

1929
01:32:17,268 --> 01:32:18,159
Okay, sir.

1930
01:32:24,548 --> 01:32:25,707
What?

1931
01:32:26,468 --> 01:32:28,644
How could son-in-law's
number be here?

1932
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:33,706
The phone is switched off.

1933
01:32:44,572 --> 01:32:48,248
You're not answering my phone, so,
I called from Thamizini's phone.

1934
01:32:48,308 --> 01:32:50,688
When are you coming?
- Where is she?

1935
01:32:50,748 --> 01:32:52,967
She's sleeping, tell me,
when are you coming?

1936
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:53,872
Give the phone to Thamizini.

1937
01:32:53,932 --> 01:32:55,467
Okay, I'll give her, just a minute.

1938
01:32:55,748 --> 01:32:58,407
Tamil, Tamil,
your father is on call.

1939
01:32:58,467 --> 01:32:59,307
What's it, mother?
- Talk to him.

1940
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:01,308
I'll switch on the speaker.

1941
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:03,348
Hello!

1942
01:33:03,507 --> 01:33:05,407
Grandparents and
others have arrived.

1943
01:33:05,467 --> 01:33:06,987
Ask him like that.
- Only you're missing.

1944
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:09,226
I'm on the way to home.

1945
01:33:09,387 --> 01:33:10,728
Okay, come quickly, dad.

1946
01:33:10,788 --> 01:33:13,527
Hey, Tamil...
- Tell me, dad.

1947
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:16,647
Nothing dear, Where's Anbu?

1948
01:33:16,707 --> 01:33:18,107
His phone was switched off.

1949
01:33:19,668 --> 01:33:21,507
He said he's going
to visit temple.

1950
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:24,527
Which temple is he
visiting at mid- night?

1951
01:33:24,587 --> 01:33:26,708
Got any other personal
number of Anbu?

1952
01:33:26,948 --> 01:33:27,788
Do you know?

1953
01:33:28,426 --> 01:33:30,567
No, dad. He has only one number.

1954
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:31,832
Any problem?

1955
01:33:32,188 --> 01:33:33,832
Nothing, nothing,
you carry on.

1956
01:33:34,788 --> 01:33:35,468
Okay, dad.

1957
01:33:36,507 --> 01:33:37,187
What's it?

1958
01:33:57,587 --> 01:33:59,832
You're the watchman, right?
- Yes, sir.

1959
01:34:04,868 --> 01:34:06,107
Is she living in this apartment?

1960
01:34:06,267 --> 01:34:07,407
Never seen her, sir.

1961
01:34:07,467 --> 01:34:09,668
Look properly and tell me.
- I'm looking well, sir.

1962
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:14,547
Has anyone suspicious came
here in last two days?

1963
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,832
Suspicious?

1964
01:34:16,308 --> 01:34:18,467
Yes sir, a tall woman went out.

1965
01:34:18,668 --> 01:34:19,832
A woman? - Yes.

1966
01:34:20,148 --> 01:34:21,832
How was she to look at?
- Tall and well built!

1967
01:34:21,892 --> 01:34:22,686
Did you see her face?

1968
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:24,567
No, she covered her face
with saree.

1969
01:34:24,627 --> 01:34:25,832
Covered her face?

1970
01:34:51,507 --> 01:34:53,667
Liquor bottle...

1971
01:34:56,094 --> 01:34:57,588
She was wearing a pink saree.

1972
01:35:01,546 --> 01:35:04,227
She was wearing a pink
colored watch too.

1973
01:35:04,628 --> 01:35:05,832
Anbu!

1974
01:35:06,347 --> 01:35:07,728
I'm scared of the police.

1975
01:35:07,788 --> 01:35:08,528
Greetings, sir!

1976
01:35:08,588 --> 01:35:12,127
Available footage is from
last evening 5 o'clock only.

1977
01:35:12,187 --> 01:35:12,807
Where is the older footage?

1978
01:35:12,867 --> 01:35:14,367
We repaired the
camera at 5 pm only.

1979
01:35:14,427 --> 01:35:17,067
It means?
- Camera was broken.

1980
01:35:17,348 --> 01:35:18,766
Then, we got it repaired.

1981
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:21,832
Look, this case is about
Inspector's son- in- law.

1982
01:35:22,094 --> 01:35:23,832
If I don't get the
footage, I'll break you.

1983
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:25,607
What's this new trouble?

1984
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:27,527
Keep thinking about it,
I'll come back to get you.

1985
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:28,955
Okay.
- Are you getting smart with me?

1986
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:30,587
Looks like he'll fire
me with his eyes.

1987
01:35:30,747 --> 01:35:35,568
I adamantly contested election and
won as secretary about 6 months ago.

1988
01:35:35,628 --> 01:35:36,728
Now, I'm caught.

1989
01:35:36,788 --> 01:35:40,907
God! I'll not let the
flat to any bachelor.

1990
01:35:41,588 --> 01:35:42,387
Come, sir.

1991
01:35:58,094 --> 01:35:59,832
Record this footage
in mobile phone.

1992
01:36:04,227 --> 01:36:05,667
You're caught!

1993
01:36:20,468 --> 01:36:22,487
Do you want to go straight and
end up in a dead end again?

1994
01:36:22,547 --> 01:36:23,667
Go left.

1995
01:36:24,094 --> 01:36:26,168
Oh, no! the police!
- Why is the police here?

1996
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:27,588
Hey, stop the car. - Stop it.

1997
01:36:28,094 --> 01:36:29,832
Oh, no! Police!

1998
01:36:30,094 --> 01:36:32,508
Nothing much of a problem,
no RC book for the car.

1999
01:36:32,668 --> 01:36:33,647
Must get it ready at any cost.

2000
01:36:33,707 --> 01:36:34,871
Your uncle is the Inspector, right?

2001
01:36:34,931 --> 01:36:36,142
Call and tell
him to let our car pass.

2002
01:36:36,202 --> 01:36:38,747
Check all the vehicles.
- Everything is over.

2003
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:40,827
Keep quiet.
- Boss, the police.

2004
01:36:42,507 --> 01:36:43,527
Stop that vehicle.

2005
01:36:43,587 --> 01:36:44,507
Is he a policeman?

2006
01:36:44,676 --> 01:36:47,327
He's so tall to reach first
floor from ground floor.

2007
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:48,548
I'm caught!

2008
01:36:48,627 --> 01:36:50,288
Good night, sir.
- Where are you going?

2009
01:36:50,348 --> 01:36:52,069
Just for a small walk in car.

2010
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:53,688
Yes, sir...
walking, aren't you going?

2011
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:56,328
Try to bribe him.
- Take out the papers.

2012
01:36:56,388 --> 01:36:57,267
Paper?

2013
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:01,827
Who are they?
Talking to police, so confidently.

2014
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:03,832
May be locale goons!

2015
01:37:04,707 --> 01:37:07,628
Boss, the police would smile at
me also if I had Rs. 100 with me.

2016
01:37:08,009 --> 01:37:10,808
Look at them, boss. They look like
cucumber sellers at toll gates.

2017
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:12,147
Are they goons?

2018
01:37:12,267 --> 01:37:13,149
Take out the papers.

2019
01:37:13,209 --> 01:37:14,727
Don't have habit of reading papers.

2020
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:16,330
RC book.
- RC book?

2021
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:19,827
Look, we've everything
in car except the book.

2022
01:37:19,887 --> 01:37:21,578
We're going to temple to
offer onions.

2023
01:37:21,638 --> 01:37:23,832
If you've any doubt,
check the boot.

2024
01:37:24,094 --> 01:37:25,128
His way of talking is not right.

2025
01:37:25,188 --> 01:37:27,487
Constable, open the boot.
- Okay, sir.

2026
01:37:27,547 --> 01:37:28,688
There is no boot in the
vehicle, sir. - Sir!

2027
01:37:28,748 --> 01:37:29,832
White Scorpio, sir.

2028
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:31,767
Check this car.
- Go, check that car, sir.

2029
01:37:31,827 --> 01:37:34,568
Go...go... - Why are you
going away without checking?

2030
01:37:34,628 --> 01:37:37,067
Go, go.
- Come on, get going.

2031
01:37:37,347 --> 01:37:38,367
Where are you going?

2032
01:37:38,427 --> 01:37:39,125
Sister's house.
- Vallakottai temple.

2033
01:37:39,185 --> 01:37:40,088
Friend's place.

2034
01:37:40,148 --> 01:37:41,127
Nothing in the boot, sir.

2035
01:37:41,187 --> 01:37:43,832
Why three of you are
saying different places?

2036
01:37:44,427 --> 01:37:47,108
One the way picking up a friend,
staying night at sister's place

2037
01:37:47,268 --> 01:37:50,127
we'll visit Vallakottai temple and
come back to Chennai by tomorrow.

2038
01:37:50,187 --> 01:37:51,248
Are you going to Vallakottai?

2039
01:37:51,308 --> 01:37:52,107
Yes, sir.

2040
01:37:52,427 --> 01:37:54,367
I'll get down on the
way to Vallakottai.

2041
01:37:54,427 --> 01:37:56,168
You carry on. - Okay, sir.

2042
01:37:56,228 --> 01:38:00,147
Hey, you take the jeep. I'll
visit my home and come.

2043
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:02,986
Hey, open the door.
- Idiot, didn't you get anyone else?

2044
01:38:04,094 --> 01:38:05,427
Start the car.

2045
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:07,748
Lord Muruga!

2046
01:38:11,388 --> 01:38:13,028
Check thoroughly.

2047
01:38:13,347 --> 01:38:15,348
Check all vehicles, don't
leave any vehicle.

2048
01:38:15,707 --> 01:38:17,588
Mustn't miss this time.

2049
01:38:18,108 --> 01:38:20,367
Must find the idol
smugglers by tonight.

2050
01:38:20,427 --> 01:38:21,188
Okay?

2051
01:38:21,747 --> 01:38:23,187
We're checking, sir, over.

2052
01:38:23,267 --> 01:38:24,548
Looks like they'll
leave me on streets.

2053
01:38:24,988 --> 01:38:28,347
If I find the idol smuggler,
I'll gun them down in encounter.

2054
01:38:30,094 --> 01:38:31,832
I think he wouldn't
have shot a bird also.

2055
01:38:32,094 --> 01:38:33,348
Boasts about killing
them in encounter.

2056
01:38:34,148 --> 01:38:37,068
Sir, it seems all
accused are inside.

2057
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:42,627
Don't know who is this?

2058
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:46,868
Open the door.

2059
01:38:47,147 --> 01:38:48,567
Where is he? - Who
do you want, sir?

2060
01:38:48,627 --> 01:38:50,147
Where is he? Where is he?

2061
01:38:50,667 --> 01:38:53,807
Don't mistake me, forgive
me for coming at this hour.

2062
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:55,287
You're here, right?
It's okay, tell me.

2063
01:38:55,347 --> 01:39:00,908
Your husband AJ. - Oh no,
what happened to my husband?

2064
01:39:02,094 --> 01:39:04,688
He promised to come home with
Halwa from Archana Sweets.

2065
01:39:04,748 --> 01:39:07,707
I was thinking why hasn't he
yet come. - Archana Sweets?

2066
01:39:07,827 --> 01:39:11,087
What will I do now, sir?
What will I do, sir?

2067
01:39:11,147 --> 01:39:13,808
No need to do anything.
- What will I...

2068
01:39:14,094 --> 01:39:15,087
I said you don't
need to do anything.

2069
01:39:15,147 --> 01:39:16,887
If your husband comes home, tell
him to come to police station.

2070
01:39:16,947 --> 01:39:17,648
Got it?

2071
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:18,766
Greetings, sir.

2072
01:39:18,826 --> 01:39:20,588
Who is he?

2073
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:23,488
Your husband is not in
home, who is he, then?

2074
01:39:23,548 --> 01:39:26,088
AJ is my husband, And he is.

2075
01:39:26,148 --> 01:39:28,268
Husband? - Younger husband.

2076
01:39:28,868 --> 01:39:29,828
Younger husband?

2077
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:33,567
Younger husband?
I'm confused, sir.

2078
01:39:33,627 --> 01:39:34,328
Why? - I'm here.

2079
01:39:34,388 --> 01:39:36,528
Like sister and younger sister.

2080
01:39:36,588 --> 01:39:37,832
Not like that.

2081
01:39:38,094 --> 01:39:39,447
My brother- in- law, sir.

2082
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:42,608
My husband's younger brother.
Brother- in- law to me.

2083
01:39:42,668 --> 01:39:43,832
Yes sir, my sister- in- law.

2084
01:39:44,094 --> 01:39:45,008
Disgusting...

2085
01:39:45,068 --> 01:39:48,368
Husband, wife and
brother- in- law, good family.

2086
01:39:48,428 --> 01:39:49,428
Disastrous!

2087
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:00,447
Police checked and said
the boot is empty.

2088
01:40:00,507 --> 01:40:01,247
Where's the idol?

2089
01:40:01,307 --> 01:40:03,128
I've kept it in
Swapnasundari vehicle.

2090
01:40:03,188 --> 01:40:03,832
Safely...

2091
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:05,568
What the hell are you talking
in presence of the police?

2092
01:40:05,628 --> 01:40:07,067
Idiot...

2093
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:12,908
Stop here.

2094
01:40:16,827 --> 01:40:19,688
They're torturing
me with night duty.

2095
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:23,086
Go straight and turn
right to Vallakottai.

2096
01:40:23,146 --> 01:40:25,047
Don't miss the way.

2097
01:40:25,107 --> 01:40:26,267
Got it? - Thank you.

2098
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:28,247
It seems we must go
right to temple, boss.

2099
01:40:28,307 --> 01:40:29,832
Why? To tonsure your bald head.

2100
01:40:30,094 --> 01:40:31,148
Turn the car.

2101
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:56,307
Hey!

2102
01:40:58,628 --> 01:40:59,307
Hey!

2103
01:41:01,068 --> 01:41:01,727
What?

2104
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:03,308
Why did you kiss now?

2105
01:41:03,388 --> 01:41:06,788
It seems kiss will burn the fat.
- Who said that?

2106
01:41:06,867 --> 01:41:08,447
Kajal Agarwal has said that.

2107
01:41:08,507 --> 01:41:09,608
Did she say about kissing men?

2108
01:41:09,668 --> 01:41:11,167
I'll kiss everyone.

2109
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:12,687
I'll also kiss.

2110
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:13,832
By all means!

2111
01:41:14,094 --> 01:41:15,687
Get up!

2112
01:41:15,747 --> 01:41:17,087
Security! Gurkha!

2113
01:41:17,147 --> 01:41:18,648
No, the police!

2114
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:20,087
I'm a policeman for 25 years.

2115
01:41:20,147 --> 01:41:22,407
Where is Pandi who runs a
marriage procession car?

2116
01:41:22,467 --> 01:41:25,832
He sleeps here parking
his car after boozing.

2117
01:41:26,094 --> 01:41:28,328
Yesterday, he went out for something
but hasn't come back yet, sir.

2118
01:41:28,388 --> 01:41:30,087
His phone is switched
off too, sir.

2119
01:41:30,147 --> 01:41:31,448
Do you know that matter also?

2120
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:32,688
Why are you asking me that, sir?

2121
01:41:32,748 --> 01:41:34,608
We ate in the same plate and
had drinks from same glass.

2122
01:41:34,668 --> 01:41:35,808
Sleeping in the same bed...
- Hey!

2123
01:41:36,094 --> 01:41:37,832
I said, we will not sleep, sir.

2124
01:41:38,094 --> 01:41:39,167
Why are you searching for him?

2125
01:41:39,227 --> 01:41:41,328
To honour that bean pole
with a national award.

2126
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:43,832
He killed a girl and escaped.
- What? Killed a girl?

2127
01:41:44,094 --> 01:41:45,807
Did he make a sweet then?

2128
01:41:46,094 --> 01:41:47,567
If he comes back, inform
Valasaravakkam police station.

2129
01:41:47,627 --> 01:41:48,908
Got it? - Got it, sir.

2130
01:41:54,627 --> 01:41:59,288
Switch off the engine. We
didn't cross that car.

2131
01:41:59,348 --> 01:42:02,187
They too didn't over take us.

2132
01:42:02,307 --> 01:42:04,467
No way, it can hit that speed.

2133
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,467
Where did it go?

2134
01:42:08,987 --> 01:42:10,328
Ganesh! - Boss!

2135
01:42:10,388 --> 01:42:11,747
Inquire there.

2136
01:42:15,747 --> 01:42:23,628
Musical line from
the film,"Bigil".

2137
01:42:24,094 --> 01:42:25,047
Brother! - What?

2138
01:42:25,107 --> 01:42:27,287
Did you see a red car
passing this way?

2139
01:42:27,347 --> 01:42:29,307
That car? It went straight
and took a right turn.

2140
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:34,328
How was the car opening?
Like this or else...

2141
01:42:34,388 --> 01:42:37,547
Don't get angry, it went
straight and turned right.

2142
01:42:38,094 --> 01:42:40,388
How far you were from the car?

2143
01:42:41,828 --> 01:42:44,247
Did anyone spit from the car?
- Hey, wastrel!

2144
01:42:44,307 --> 01:42:45,768
Was there anything on
the side of the car?

2145
01:42:45,828 --> 01:42:47,748
Buffalo, he told you, right?
Come here.

2146
01:42:49,307 --> 01:42:51,428
That car.
- You... - Coming, boss.

2147
01:42:53,427 --> 01:42:55,668
They said Vallakottai but why
did they change the route?

2148
01:42:57,706 --> 01:42:58,767
Rock it!

2149
01:42:58,827 --> 01:43:01,727
Musical line from
the film "Darbar"

2150
01:43:01,787 --> 01:43:03,288
You want to go that way?

2151
01:43:03,348 --> 01:43:05,547
The drainage is broken and
overflowing, can't go that way.

2152
01:43:08,948 --> 01:43:11,307
Who is he staring as if he
is saving the industry?

2153
01:43:15,067 --> 01:43:17,087
Have relatives of the dead
body came sniffing it?

2154
01:43:17,147 --> 01:43:19,127
Can't you judge from his nose
he looks like a sniffer?

2155
01:43:19,187 --> 01:43:22,907
If you cross sword with Don,
you can't go with onions.

2156
01:43:23,108 --> 01:43:25,368
You'll get thrashed by him.

2157
01:43:25,428 --> 01:43:26,408
What is this? Onions
and thrashing!

2158
01:43:26,468 --> 01:43:27,767
Why are you trapping
me with him?

2159
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:28,487
What to do now?

2160
01:43:28,547 --> 01:43:30,927
He is trying hard to get
a reaction in his face.

2161
01:43:30,987 --> 01:43:32,487
Take reverse. - Reverse?

2162
01:43:32,547 --> 01:43:34,848
He looks very scary.

2163
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:37,832
He looks like he'll eat
a bagful of biryani.

2164
01:43:38,094 --> 01:43:38,748
Yes.

2165
01:43:42,094 --> 01:43:43,368
Okay, boss.

2166
01:43:43,428 --> 01:43:44,608
I'll take care of him.

2167
01:43:44,668 --> 01:43:45,608
Feel free.

2168
01:43:45,668 --> 01:43:47,027
Who the hell is he
to touch onions?

2169
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:48,548
No... Listen to me.

2170
01:43:48,947 --> 01:43:50,328
Go, he'll collapse everything.

2171
01:43:50,388 --> 01:43:51,288
Wait, I'll go.

2172
01:43:51,348 --> 01:43:53,048
We might need to
take the car, wait.

2173
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:54,488
Brother, mustn't open like that.
- Unable to open it?

2174
01:43:54,548 --> 01:43:55,607
I'll show how to open it.

2175
01:43:55,667 --> 01:43:57,747
He's opening it for them.
- Must open it like this.

2176
01:43:58,094 --> 01:43:58,887
Boss! - How is it?

2177
01:43:58,947 --> 01:43:59,832
Sister- in- law is here!

2178
01:44:00,094 --> 01:44:01,066
Oh, no!

2179
01:44:02,107 --> 01:44:03,567
He shouldn't laugh
like this for us.

2180
01:44:03,627 --> 01:44:05,832
I told you to go carefully
on speed breaker, right?

2181
01:44:06,094 --> 01:44:07,248
The corpse has emerged out!

2182
01:44:07,308 --> 01:44:09,468
No, jacket is there.

2183
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:10,808
This incense stick
is spreading smoke!

2184
01:44:10,868 --> 01:44:11,667
Wait, I'm coming.

2185
01:44:12,987 --> 01:44:13,832
Look here!

2186
01:44:14,187 --> 01:44:15,467
Was the bag ripped!

2187
01:44:15,827 --> 01:44:18,308
Is he shocked after
seeing the dead?

2188
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:25,268
How did this mad turn up here?

2189
01:44:26,107 --> 01:44:29,087
Do you know I'm getting engaged
to a foreign groom in two days?

2190
01:44:29,147 --> 01:44:30,767
What's his name? - Ramasamy.

2191
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:33,068
Is he that foreigner?

2192
01:44:33,548 --> 01:44:35,427
Okay, decide now.

2193
01:44:36,308 --> 01:44:38,627
He keeps laughing right
from his arrival.

2194
01:44:42,387 --> 01:44:44,868
You tell me.

2195
01:44:47,068 --> 01:44:48,428
Her look is changing!

2196
01:44:54,094 --> 01:44:55,467
Why is she looking at him?

2197
01:45:14,094 --> 01:45:16,261
I found my sister-in-law!

2198
01:45:16,428 --> 01:45:17,832
Why is she doing like this?

2199
01:45:20,094 --> 01:45:21,528
Who is she? - Who knows?

2200
01:45:21,588 --> 01:45:24,687
Musical line from
the film "Adukalam"

2201
01:45:24,747 --> 01:45:26,828
Hey, get down.

2202
01:45:27,971 --> 01:45:30,488
Hey, you...
- What's this, dude?

2203
01:45:30,548 --> 01:45:31,827
I don't know.

2204
01:45:37,028 --> 01:45:40,743
I said so but now
I like only you.

2205
01:45:51,547 --> 01:45:52,547
Yes.

2206
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:00,248
Is it at height?

2207
01:46:00,308 --> 01:46:01,407
Go and die somewhere.

2208
01:46:01,467 --> 01:46:02,187
Come on.

2209
01:46:15,428 --> 01:46:16,568
Hey, who is he?

2210
01:46:16,628 --> 01:46:18,707
Oh, no! this guy?

2211
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:32,568
He is coming
striaght away to me.

2212
01:46:32,628 --> 01:46:33,707
What's the matter?
- I don't know.

2213
01:46:34,107 --> 01:46:35,168
Hey! - What's it, brother?

2214
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:36,349
You were supposed to go to

2215
01:46:36,409 --> 01:46:37,488
Vallakottai,
what are you doing in Walajabad?

2216
01:46:37,548 --> 01:46:39,408
The tepmle is closed by
midnight in Vallakottai.

2217
01:46:39,468 --> 01:46:41,008
They said, it'll be opened
by evening 6 o'clock only.

2218
01:46:41,068 --> 01:46:42,247
Found a girl too!

2219
01:46:42,307 --> 01:46:43,527
I'm having great time with her.

2220
01:46:43,587 --> 01:46:45,187
After finishing the sequence,
roll the end card too.

2221
01:46:45,268 --> 01:46:45,992
You come.

2222
01:46:47,347 --> 01:46:48,327
Come on, rock it.

2223
01:46:48,387 --> 01:46:49,828
What did I ask?
What is he saying?

2224
01:46:52,254 --> 01:46:53,568
What bothers you if
we go elsewhere?

2225
01:46:53,628 --> 01:46:54,568
Who the hell are you, sir?

2226
01:46:54,628 --> 01:46:55,728
Who am I?

2227
01:46:55,788 --> 01:46:58,308
Owner of the stuff in your boot.

2228
01:46:58,548 --> 01:47:00,388
Sir... sir... we did
it by mistake, sir.

2229
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:02,606
Tomorrow morning,
I'm getting engaged, sir.

2230
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:03,807
Please leave me, sir.

2231
01:47:03,867 --> 01:47:07,992
Are you trying to steal 250 Millions
worth stuff for your engagement?

2232
01:47:09,187 --> 01:47:10,888
250 Millions?

2233
01:47:10,948 --> 01:47:12,868
Hey, gun him down!

2234
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:15,507
Sir...
- Go back!

2235
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:17,067
Sir...
- I said go back!

2236
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:20,347
Hey, go forward and shoot.

2237
01:47:20,628 --> 01:47:21,748
Hands up! - Sir...sir...

2238
01:47:22,308 --> 01:47:25,267
Move what's up, bro?
- Shoot him first.

2239
01:47:25,428 --> 01:47:27,647
Where are you aiming at?

2240
01:47:27,707 --> 01:47:29,008
What should I do with it? Hey,
go and get the carry bag.

2241
01:47:29,068 --> 01:47:29,992
Hey, go and get the carry bag.

2242
01:47:30,828 --> 01:47:32,367
Can I keep this in car
and carry it, boss?

2243
01:47:32,427 --> 01:47:34,467
I may yell at you.
please, go away.

2244
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:35,968
Damn faced! - I'll
keep it myself.

2245
01:47:36,254 --> 01:47:38,767
He'll ask me to carry the bag
but don't hold the gun also.

2246
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:39,992
Carry it.
- What is he going to do with it?

2247
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:42,667
Tell me, Sounder.

2248
01:47:43,067 --> 01:47:46,767
It's an hour past on our
scheduled exchange time.

2249
01:47:46,827 --> 01:47:48,588
Come...
- I've half an hour work.

2250
01:47:48,668 --> 01:47:51,627
Why is he opening the
boot and looking at it?

2251
01:47:52,827 --> 01:47:54,408
Excuse me. Can you
please keep this?

2252
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,128
It's my pleasure.

2253
01:47:55,188 --> 01:47:58,287
Come on, lift it. - What's this?
Circling like old PCO.

2254
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:01,488
It's not PCO but Python
357 model pistol.

2255
01:48:01,548 --> 01:48:03,688
Okay, okay. - At a time,
you can load six bullets.

2256
01:48:03,748 --> 01:48:04,728
Is it? - Yeah.

2257
01:48:04,788 --> 01:48:06,427
They have got the gun.

2258
01:48:06,628 --> 01:48:07,992
Must enter the arena.

2259
01:48:13,068 --> 01:48:17,028
Enough of your middleman job.
- You'll see the real game of Kali.

2260
01:48:17,268 --> 01:48:18,488
I'll leave this field.

2261
01:48:18,548 --> 01:48:19,667
You'll see it.

2262
01:48:19,748 --> 01:48:20,808
Don't tell tales.

2263
01:48:20,868 --> 01:48:22,126
I'll finish it and come.
Hang up the phone.

2264
01:48:22,186 --> 01:48:23,528
There's only one such pistol.

2265
01:48:23,588 --> 01:48:25,268
My boss bought it
in black market.

2266
01:48:26,588 --> 01:48:27,327
Look at this!

2267
01:48:27,387 --> 01:48:28,647
Can I use it to
shoot underground?

2268
01:48:28,707 --> 01:48:30,488
You can shoot in underwear also.
- Okay, okay.

2269
01:48:30,548 --> 01:48:32,208
Can we shoot upside down
lying inside water?

2270
01:48:32,268 --> 01:48:34,368
You can shoot this pig.
- Come, you too join to learn.

2271
01:48:34,428 --> 01:48:37,832
If you load six bullets and
shoot your opponent as target.

2272
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:40,767
Just only one shot!
- Boss has come.

2273
01:48:40,827 --> 01:48:41,607
What are you doing?

2274
01:48:41,667 --> 01:48:44,808
Boss, he doesn't know
anything about the gun.

2275
01:48:44,868 --> 01:48:45,687
So, I was explaining
him about it.

2276
01:48:45,747 --> 01:48:46,808
Why don't you teach
him to shoot also?

2277
01:48:46,868 --> 01:48:48,648
Okay, boss.
- That is...

2278
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:49,568
Hey, you...

2279
01:48:49,628 --> 01:48:50,927
Not me, he asked me, boss.

2280
01:48:50,987 --> 01:48:51,828
Not me, boss.

2281
01:48:52,094 --> 01:48:55,688
Dear, because of your love,
I've become a mouse.

2282
01:48:55,748 --> 01:48:57,767
Gone, all of us are caught!

2283
01:48:57,827 --> 01:48:59,567
Someone has come here, ask them
to lift the bag, you fool.

2284
01:48:59,627 --> 01:49:00,128
It's a murder case.

2285
01:49:00,188 --> 01:49:02,168
And Don is romancing
at this hour.

2286
01:49:02,228 --> 01:49:04,607
Rowdy, sir. Please, sir.

2287
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:06,707
Don't take. Please, sir.

2288
01:49:10,094 --> 01:49:10,668
Lift it.

2289
01:49:11,187 --> 01:49:11,628
Hey! Wait.

2290
01:49:12,106 --> 01:49:14,267
Hey!

2291
01:49:14,508 --> 01:49:15,528
Who are you all?

2292
01:49:15,588 --> 01:49:17,528
Why are you all dragging this?

2293
01:49:17,588 --> 01:49:19,388
Are you fighting for onions?

2294
01:49:19,787 --> 01:49:21,832
If it is sold for Rs.100 a
kilo, will you fight for it?

2295
01:49:22,094 --> 01:49:23,687
I'll shoot you, shoot you.

2296
01:49:23,747 --> 01:49:25,629
Don't know where
our country is heading?

2297
01:49:25,689 --> 01:49:28,167
Hey!
- Move away.

2298
01:49:28,227 --> 01:49:30,327
I'll definitely shoot you all.

2299
01:49:30,387 --> 01:49:31,688
Hey, where did you come from?

2300
01:49:31,748 --> 01:49:33,287
Listen to me.

2301
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:35,387
Hey, damn it!

2302
01:49:35,822 --> 01:49:37,107
I'll shoot!

2303
01:49:46,306 --> 01:49:49,832
"Guys are celebrating our
love by bursting crackers."

2304
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:10,707
Hey, where's the corpse?

2305
01:50:11,388 --> 01:50:12,627
Idol is falling down.

2306
01:50:20,094 --> 01:50:25,587
Hail Lord Muruga!

2307
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,669
Lord, don't stop
my friend's engagement

2308
01:50:27,729 --> 01:50:29,328
because we missed the onion bag.

2309
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:31,248
We will somehow bring
it to you, Lord.

2310
01:50:31,308 --> 01:50:31,832
Lord Muruga!

2311
01:50:32,867 --> 01:50:33,707
Vallakottai Murugan!

2312
01:50:34,268 --> 01:50:37,487
If anyone dares to touch the
idol, I'll blow up their heads.

2313
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:39,687
Brother, we're not
touching the idol.

2314
01:50:39,747 --> 01:50:43,832
The man next to you, I think
he's planning to steal the idol.

2315
01:50:44,094 --> 01:50:45,832
I'm in no way
associated with this.

2316
01:50:46,094 --> 01:50:49,388
Hey! - What's this voice?

2317
01:50:49,628 --> 01:50:51,995
You look like M R Radha but has

2318
01:50:52,055 --> 01:50:54,034
a voice like Radha of
'Mudhal Mariyadai'.

2319
01:50:54,094 --> 01:50:56,528
Now I know, why
sister- in- law has left you.

2320
01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:58,647
Brother, Walajabad will
fear upon my voice.

2321
01:50:58,707 --> 01:51:00,607
You'll booze and blabber
on road at night.

2322
01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:02,328
Will Walajabad fear
on your voice?

2323
01:51:02,388 --> 01:51:04,047
Inquire about me in my place.

2324
01:51:04,107 --> 01:51:05,447
First, look at your
face in the mirror.

2325
01:51:05,507 --> 01:51:07,487
You look like a teddy bear.

2326
01:51:07,547 --> 01:51:10,706
I think your voice is rusty, take
oil and relax for 30 minutes.

2327
01:51:10,858 --> 01:51:12,034
We can talk after that.

2328
01:51:12,094 --> 01:51:14,247
I didn't come to this
position so easily.

2329
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:17,299
If you talk like this, you'd have
got thrashed by many on the way.

2330
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:19,720
Did you see?
- No, where did you buy it?

2331
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,838
My fate I had to tell you.

2332
01:51:20,898 --> 01:51:21,984
May I read only one, boss?

2333
01:51:22,246 --> 01:51:22,759
With your permission.

2334
01:51:22,819 --> 01:51:23,680
Just a minute.

2335
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,240
What is he going to do?

2336
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,024
Close your mouth.
- Why are you removing moustache?

2337
01:51:28,485 --> 01:51:29,500
Brother!

2338
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:32,088
Straighten your tress and
join Stella Maris College.

2339
01:51:32,246 --> 01:51:33,559
Did you see what
your guy do for me?

2340
01:51:33,619 --> 01:51:35,560
I'm also a goon like you.
- Hey, you...

2341
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:39,580
Not a big goon but a goon who
just see the gun, never uses it.

2342
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,720
Why are you playing here?

2343
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,800
Keep the idol in car. - Okay.

2344
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:44,440
If anyone moves,
I'll shoot them.

2345
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,660
Come, keep it inside.
- Why pointing at me?

2346
01:51:47,339 --> 01:51:49,144
Why did uncle call
me so many times?

2347
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:55,623
Why did you call me
so many times, uncle?

2348
01:51:55,683 --> 01:51:58,208
Anbu, I'm Inspector
Rajamanickam here.

2349
01:51:59,164 --> 01:52:02,208
He's safe in the police station.

2350
01:52:02,844 --> 01:52:05,523
Your maternal uncle.
That too with the bag.

2351
01:52:05,748 --> 01:52:07,064
How did the bag go to him?

2352
01:52:07,124 --> 01:52:08,923
Come to station.

2353
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:12,903
Hey, hey. You.

2354
01:52:12,963 --> 01:52:14,584
He threw it somewhere
here, search it, guys.

2355
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:16,164
Who is on phone?

2356
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:19,923
The bag is in the
police station.

2357
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:22,095
If it is there, tell the
inspector to bring it here.

2358
01:52:22,155 --> 01:52:24,103
Hey, bag!
- Go.

2359
01:52:24,163 --> 01:52:25,443
Get lost.

2360
01:52:26,044 --> 01:52:28,104
What bag? - Laundry bag.

2361
01:52:28,164 --> 01:52:29,323
Lie on.

2362
01:52:33,363 --> 01:52:36,208
What did he say, Don?
- It seems, the bag is in station.

2363
01:52:36,484 --> 01:52:37,943
Is onion bag in station?

2364
01:52:38,003 --> 01:52:40,203
It means we found the
bag to fulfill the vow.

2365
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:43,444
Lord, I'm coming to
Vallakottai in car.

2366
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:46,824
If bag is in station,
I'll get caught, come.

2367
01:52:46,884 --> 01:52:47,863
Come on, you goof.

2368
01:52:47,923 --> 01:52:50,208
Whose bike it is, left with key?
Get on.

2369
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:53,144
If caught, I'm done.

2370
01:52:53,204 --> 01:52:54,943
Search it, guys.

2371
01:52:55,003 --> 01:52:56,024
Hey buffalo! Search properly.

2372
01:52:56,084 --> 01:52:57,463
What are you searching?

2373
01:52:57,523 --> 01:53:00,063
I didn't threw it.

2374
01:53:00,123 --> 01:53:01,804
This is very old style.

2375
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:07,545
Tell him to give the idol.

2376
01:53:07,605 --> 01:53:08,941
No, give the gun, you...

2377
01:53:09,143 --> 01:53:10,208
Tell him to give the idol.

2378
01:53:10,268 --> 01:53:12,024
Boss! Did he join our clan?

2379
01:53:12,084 --> 01:53:13,329
Looks like practicing to shoot.

2380
01:53:13,389 --> 01:53:15,362
Good...good.
- Shooting?

2381
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:18,084
Go, bring the idol
from car and give him.

2382
01:53:18,299 --> 01:53:20,917
Car? The car has left.
- Left?

2383
01:53:21,148 --> 01:53:23,499
Hey, our car is here only.

2384
01:53:24,198 --> 01:53:27,076
Brother, that's not a car
but a jeep type vehicle.

2385
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,544
The red one parked
here is a car.

2386
01:53:29,604 --> 01:53:32,802
When the car is parked,
door is opened like this.

2387
01:53:32,862 --> 01:53:34,144
Our vehicle is a jeep model.

2388
01:53:34,204 --> 01:53:36,663
You told me to keep it
in car, I kept in car.

2389
01:53:36,723 --> 01:53:37,273
The red car has left.

2390
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:40,123
Did you ask me to keep
the idol in car or not?

2391
01:53:41,708 --> 01:53:44,803
You're so intelligent, right?
Why did you wipe my moustache?

2392
01:53:46,082 --> 01:53:47,043
Please, don't praise me high.

2393
01:53:47,356 --> 01:53:49,404
What is sister telling you?
- Wait, I'll tell you.

2394
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:53,100
Keep him with you, you can
smuggle ten such idols.

2395
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:54,676
Come on, guys.

2396
01:53:55,381 --> 01:53:57,985
The babe has left and
so 250 Millions also.

2397
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:01,520
If anyone calls me a goon,
I don't believe it myself.

2398
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:01,985
Please, give me your phone.

2399
01:54:02,247 --> 01:54:03,140
Phone? Please take it, brother.

2400
01:54:04,247 --> 01:54:04,340
Come on, speak now.

2401
01:54:05,941 --> 01:54:09,020
Deal is done,
delivered the idol.

2402
01:54:09,221 --> 01:54:11,900
If you pay my commission and his
commission, we'll go away happily.

2403
01:54:12,247 --> 01:54:12,501
Here it is!

2404
01:54:16,247 --> 01:54:16,620
Okay.

2405
01:54:16,781 --> 01:54:17,780
Brother... Hey!

2406
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:23,340
I bought the vehicle on loan.

2407
01:54:23,741 --> 01:54:25,661
He will spit like bathing.

2408
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:26,741
Is it police station?

2409
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:30,861
A murder is about to happen here.
- Boss, my commission.

2410
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:34,800
Twin murders.

2411
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:36,240
Next assignment?
- I'll give you the address.

2412
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,181
Please, come.

2413
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:40,781
Tell me, what should we do, boss?
- You!

2414
01:54:41,741 --> 01:54:45,261
He started shooting again,
someone please come and save me.

2415
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,820
The corpse has been
sent to morgue, sir.

2416
01:55:24,261 --> 01:55:27,980
Nephew, nephew
- Uncle!

2417
01:55:28,541 --> 01:55:29,340
Nephew...

2418
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,985
How God fearing today's
generation are!

2419
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:40,541
Oh, no! Hey!

2420
01:55:45,461 --> 01:55:46,759
They left the bag on ground!

2421
01:55:46,819 --> 01:55:48,720
The number you called now is.

2422
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,981
Why have you switched
off the phone?

2423
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,901
Nephew said the name
of a marriage hall?

2424
01:55:58,247 --> 01:56:01,020
I haven't told the address, yet.
Are you guiding me, already?

2425
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:07,940
He said about a marriage
hall, is it Subha or Shobha?

2426
01:56:09,741 --> 01:56:10,620
It's Subha!

2427
01:56:12,247 --> 01:56:13,181
Subha Marriage Hall.

2428
01:56:17,261 --> 01:56:18,740
Okay, Google.

2429
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:37,040
Among people who misunderstand
whatever we say

2430
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:39,101
you always understand
whatever I say!

2431
01:56:39,341 --> 01:56:40,700
You're great, Google!

2432
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,060
This is what I like the most!

2433
01:56:47,621 --> 01:56:48,981
Google dozed off.

2434
01:56:50,901 --> 01:56:51,540
What?

2435
01:56:52,247 --> 01:56:53,985
Can you please drop me
near Subha Marriage Hall?

2436
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,740
Subha Marriage Hall?

2437
01:57:00,381 --> 01:57:01,661
You're not wrong
to ask for lift.

2438
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:03,101
You're not wrong to
ask the address.

2439
01:57:04,247 --> 01:57:05,985
But you're keeping a bag here.

2440
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,960
I've seen you somewhere.
- Why is he staring at me?

2441
01:57:10,247 --> 01:57:10,781
Where?

2442
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:17,280
Aren't you the guy
who was on CCTV?

2443
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:20,400
I'm not famous to
appear on TV, brother.

2444
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:21,859
But I'll surely appear
in near future.

2445
01:57:22,819 --> 01:57:24,760
I'll make you famous,
get into the vehicle.

2446
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:26,400
I'll take you to the place,
you deserve to reach.

2447
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,941
Sit down. - Super, brother.

2448
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:31,781
You're done!

2449
01:57:37,101 --> 01:57:37,661
Welcome!

2450
01:57:38,501 --> 01:57:39,581
Accused Anbu!

2451
01:57:39,821 --> 01:57:43,500
You've done a murder and
tried to erase the evidence.

2452
01:57:43,581 --> 01:57:46,620
Looks like he's in mood.
- It was my mistake, sir.

2453
01:57:47,779 --> 01:57:49,281
Is it murder case or rape case?

2454
01:57:49,341 --> 01:57:50,481
Murder...rape?

2455
01:57:50,541 --> 01:57:52,461
Or else rape and murder, both?
- Sir!

2456
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,260
Did you do it alone
or as a gang?

2457
01:57:55,421 --> 01:57:58,380
Sir, my friends are in no
way connected to this.

2458
01:57:58,821 --> 01:57:59,985
It was all my mistake.

2459
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,561
I ruined my life on my own, sir.

2460
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:07,220
Do you know my daughter got many
proposals from big families?

2461
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,241
All were doctors,
software company owners.

2462
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:12,360
And big businessmen!

2463
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,340
But she rejected all of them

2464
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:17,985
and selected a man like you
who don't have an address.

2465
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:19,341
She loved you!

2466
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:22,700
If you really want my daughter,
would have you done this?

2467
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:23,985
Not like that, sir.

2468
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,940
Did you heed when I asked
you to marry my daughter?

2469
01:58:36,701 --> 01:58:39,581
Last night, we received a
complaint that a girl missing.

2470
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,985
When we checked her
phone call history,

2471
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,660
The last call was made
to your phone number.

2472
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,700
I went to your house
suspecting you.

2473
01:58:48,259 --> 01:58:52,481
As I suspected, I found the girl's
saree and watch in your home.

2474
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:56,741
So I decided, you had a
connection with the missing girl.

2475
01:58:56,899 --> 01:58:59,421
At that time, Momo
gave me a clue.

2476
01:59:08,621 --> 01:59:11,240
On checking her
complete call history,

2477
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:14,501
She used to regularly talk
to a guy called as James.

2478
01:59:19,661 --> 01:59:22,301
I found that he's the guy who
lives next to your house.

2479
01:59:23,261 --> 01:59:24,740
When I inquired with him,

2480
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,441
He and the missing girl met in

2481
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:28,320
Facebook and fell in love
with each other.

2482
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,540
He tried to misbehave with her
in the absence of his parents.

2483
01:59:33,261 --> 01:59:35,985
But the girl died due to fits.

2484
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:38,745
When he doesn't
know what to do.

2485
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,740
You guys were inebriated
and were flat.

2486
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:44,381
Using it, he dumped the corpse
in your place and escaped.

2487
01:59:56,621 --> 01:59:57,909
Sorry, brother!

2488
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:08,261
You booze heavily
and unaware of

2489
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:10,721
what's going on and
where are you lying?

2490
02:00:10,781 --> 02:00:13,820
And don't know whether
you're alive or dead.

2491
02:00:14,247 --> 02:00:16,461
Why do you need
marriage or funeral?

2492
02:00:17,421 --> 02:00:17,961
Ask him like that, sir.

2493
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:20,438
How many plans you
made to erase the

2494
02:00:20,498 --> 02:00:22,042
evidence of a murder
you didn't commit?

2495
02:00:22,821 --> 02:00:28,661
How can I trust that you won't kill
my daughter and dispose her corpse?

2496
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:30,540
Sir, I made a mistake.

2497
02:00:30,861 --> 02:00:31,581
Okay.

2498
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:42,500
Police station?

2499
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,420
Have they got surrendered?

2500
02:00:50,247 --> 02:00:51,461
Why the idol is here?

2501
02:00:52,301 --> 02:00:55,100
Already stuck with murder
case, now this too!

2502
02:00:55,821 --> 02:00:56,541
Lord Muruga!

2503
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:00,080
I mustn't see you again
in my daughter's life.

2504
02:01:00,261 --> 02:01:01,717
Just vanish without any trace.

2505
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:04,890
Both engagement and
marriage are cancelled.

2506
02:01:05,301 --> 02:01:06,029
Get lost.

2507
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:09,341
I can go home now, thank God.

2508
02:01:45,741 --> 02:01:46,281
What's this?

2509
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:47,580
It was in car.

2510
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,621
In car?

2511
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:50,541
Oh, my God!

2512
02:02:07,181 --> 02:02:08,261
What's this?

2513
02:02:08,741 --> 02:02:11,621
He's kissing him instead
of his daughter.

2514
02:02:16,579 --> 02:02:18,900
Would he send him alone for the
first night or else he will.

2515
02:02:19,381 --> 02:02:20,880
Commissioner sir! - Tell me.

2516
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:23,121
By taking heavy risk and
after spilling the blood.

2517
02:02:23,181 --> 02:02:24,780
I found the idol, sir.

2518
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:28,560
Excellent Rajamanickam! I'm
proud of you.- Thank you, sir.

2519
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:30,540
Thank you...
Thank you so much, sir.

2520
02:02:30,621 --> 02:02:32,661
You love me sincerely, right?

2521
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:38,720
Will you wait for me for years?

2522
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,740
I'll wait.

2523
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,501
I'll wait with my
husband and children.

2524
02:02:41,741 --> 02:02:42,900
With husband and children?

2525
02:02:43,101 --> 02:02:44,420
I'll wait for 10 minutes,

2526
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:45,985
if you don't come,
I'll keep moving on.

2527
02:02:46,247 --> 02:02:48,600
You will always have
a second choice!

2528
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:50,520
Hold it.
You mad.

2529
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,985
Don't know what happened!

2530
02:02:53,554 --> 02:02:55,845
Anbu, did your father-in-law
let you free,

2531
02:02:55,905 --> 02:02:57,179
since you're his future son-in-law?

2532
02:02:57,239 --> 02:02:58,025
No.

2533
02:02:58,247 --> 02:02:59,441
Saturday and Sunday...

2534
02:02:59,501 --> 02:03:01,040
Did he ask you to offer
oil and sesame to temple?

2535
02:03:01,181 --> 02:03:03,420
Can't you ever be serious?

2536
02:03:03,541 --> 02:03:04,882
It seems Jaganmohan Reddy
has ordered

2537
02:03:04,907 --> 02:03:05,964
to close the police stations.

2538
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,901
Has Jaganmohan Reddy ordered?

2539
02:03:08,301 --> 02:03:11,741
Jaganmohan Reddy is
Andhra CM, right?

2540
02:03:12,247 --> 02:03:13,985
Then, do we've to lodge complaint
on Monday only? - Yes.

2541
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,341
How come the law of Andhra
be applicable here?

2542
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,436
We can't bring liquor from
Andhra here,

2543
02:03:18,496 --> 02:03:21,169
how can their laws be
applicable here?

2544
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,861
What did I say now
to laugh out loud?

2545
02:03:28,541 --> 02:03:30,401
Hey, we didn't
commit this murder.

2546
02:03:30,814 --> 02:03:31,820
Yes.

2547
02:03:37,701 --> 02:03:38,441
Stop it.

2548
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:40,641
After hugging, he would've
called the Commissioner.

2549
02:03:40,701 --> 02:03:42,248
What would've he told
the Commissioner?

2550
02:03:42,308 --> 02:03:44,280
He would've told he shed
blood to find that idol.

2551
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:44,960
That's all, isn't it?

2552
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:47,520
How can you get it right?
As if you had seen it.

2553
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:48,480
This is a scene from
film'Thunive Thunai'.

2554
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,985
Don...Don...
- Who is he?

2555
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,180
Why are you standing here?

2556
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:52,260
Where is the bag?

2557
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:53,780
Are we going to temple or not?

2558
02:03:54,247 --> 02:03:55,440
What happened? Tell me.

2559
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,420
Ask him, he'll tell you.

2560
02:03:57,341 --> 02:03:57,941
Tell him.

2561
02:03:58,420 --> 02:03:58,980
Come here.

2562
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:01,980
The world knows the story,
how can you be unaware of it?

2563
02:04:16,781 --> 02:04:19,517
Were we roaming with
a corpse so far?

2564
02:04:20,037 --> 02:04:22,049
Let him get normal, come.

2565
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:23,100
Come.

2566
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:27,600
Musical line from
the film, "Jeyam".

2567
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,561
What did you do with Pandi?

2568
02:04:29,621 --> 02:04:32,321
I folded him and
dumped into boot.

2569
02:04:32,381 --> 02:04:33,480
Is he still in boot?

2570
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:34,940
That's why, I'm getting
moaning sound.

2571
02:04:36,244 --> 02:04:38,541
You must do all work
after marriage.

2572
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:39,821
I'll do it.

2573
02:04:40,116 --> 02:04:43,241
If I sweep house, are you
planning to hit the road?

2574
02:04:43,426 --> 02:04:44,623
You will be spared.

2575
02:04:45,101 --> 02:04:46,187
Leave all those.

2576
02:04:46,247 --> 02:04:48,780
Are we going to
honeymoon in this car?

2577
02:04:48,941 --> 02:04:51,780
In this car? Can't even cross few
streets trusting these guys.

2578
02:04:52,247 --> 02:04:53,921
Going to honeymoon in it
is like going to hell.

2579
02:04:53,981 --> 02:04:55,121
You mustn't tell like that.

2580
02:04:55,181 --> 02:04:56,187
We will also join you.

2581
02:04:56,247 --> 02:04:58,503
Is my life a share auto
to take all of you?

2582
02:04:58,563 --> 02:04:59,900
Chinnarasu, start.

2583
02:04:59,981 --> 02:05:00,881
Dude, you mustn't go
anywhere leaving us.

2584
02:05:00,941 --> 02:05:02,736
Why? To roam again
with a corpse?

2585
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,017
"Order one peg, buddy"

2586
02:05:07,168 --> 02:05:08,877
"Buddy, buddy, buddy"

2587
02:05:08,937 --> 02:05:11,181
"Join with me, buddy"

2588
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:14,482
"Order one more peg, buddy"

2589
02:05:14,614 --> 02:05:16,316
"Buddy, buddy, buddy"

2590
02:05:16,453 --> 02:05:20,501
"Join with me, buddy..."

2591
02:05:37,101 --> 02:05:40,601
"We roam with great pride, don't
know if it is right or wrong"

2592
02:05:40,661 --> 02:05:44,640
"There are no laws beyond
friendship for us"

2593
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:47,985
"Don't ask passport for
flying rockets"

2594
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:51,960
"We life as life...
Like and share is routine"

2595
02:05:52,152 --> 02:06:00,149
"Charmed by the fragrance of
fresh blossoms on your body..."

2596
02:06:04,113 --> 02:06:11,120
"She stole my heart with
her chocolaty eyes..."

2597
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:20,831
"She's unsettling me with her
tequila like intoxication..."
