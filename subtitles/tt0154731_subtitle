3
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,720
Move out of the way! Hey!

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,050
- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- What happened? - I dropped my wallet.

5
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,230
Usha! Usha, dear...

6
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,420
- Usha!
- Give her some air.

7
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,390
Thank you!

8
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,710
- Where am I?
- By the riverside.

9
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,226
You are... who are you?

10
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,210
Er... My name is Harish, height
5 feet 9 inches, chest 40 inches.

11
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,750
Dear Usha, our boats collided.
How are you?

12
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm absolutely fine.
Please let me get up.

13
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,160
No, no, do, don't move.
The pain will only worsen.

14
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,720
- I'm not in distress.
- But I am.

15
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,110
- Oh... - What happened? - What happened?
- The pain has increased.

16
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,346
- Where's it hurting?
- Here... here... No, no... here... here...

17
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,390
It began in my stomach...

18
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,050
in my stomach; oh, look, it's moving
upwards to my chest. Oh... my heart!

19
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,010
- Oh, my poor heart! - Oh, my heart...
- Oh, my poor heart... - What rubbish!

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
Nonsense! Let me go!

21
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,050
Let me go!

22
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,190
You are Miss Usha Rani, the only
daughter of Rai saab Devi Chand.

23
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,570
- Where have you been?
- Er... er... I'd gone boating on the river.

24
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,566
And the waves, separated for years,
jumped up to hug you?

25
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,570
And muck rained from
far-off skies...

26
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,280
that ruined your clothes?

27
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,550
- That... we had an accident... a collision...
- Of course! How could you not collide?

28
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,440
I can tell that this collision will ruin
Rai Saheb's honor one day.

29
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,340
- Are you listening?
- Eh? Well done.

30
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,200
Where're you going with
your head held up high?

31
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,230
I'm only her step-mother, but if blood
relatives don't speak up, I'll have to.

32
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,750
Ask her where she'd gone!
Ask her!

33
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,000
Tell me, my dear, what happened?

34
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,810
Is this any way to ask her? Respectable
families would have skinned her alive.

35
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,376
They would have broken her knees
so she wouldn't step out again.

36
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,700
Can't you talk calmly for once?

37
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,796
You're short-tempered
all the time.

38
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,610
Step-mothers are also mothers.

39
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,650
She's your daughter
just as much as she's mine.

40
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,690
This is exactly why
she's so spoiled.

41
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,550
I'm her age too. I've desires
as well, but I curb them.

42
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,250
Are you doing me a favor?

43
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,210
I married you. I didn't
borrow you from anyone.

44
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,430
Mark my words, if you value your
reputation, then use your brains.

45
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,370
The past can never be changed.
You'll regret this all your life.

46
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,770
- My dear, you're answerable only to me.
- Daddy...

47
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,580
A man who dies without a son to
succeed him is said to be unfortunate.

48
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,150
I married again only because
of this, my dear.

49
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,380
Daddy!

50
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,210
Gita...

51
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,100
Hey, what happened? Did you dive
into a rain-filled ditch?

52
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,690
- Or play kabbadi in the gutters?
- Speak softly!

53
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,320
If father hears you, I'll be in trouble.
As it is, I'm late.

54
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,910
- Who's it, my dear?
- N... no one, father. The washerman brought the clothes.

55
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,350
Hey, washerman's sister, give
me my clothes. I'll change right here.

56
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,610
Not so fast. First, tell me...

57
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,526
where you celebrated
this unseasonal Holi?

58
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,180
- I didn't play Holi.
- Then, was it hide and seek?

59
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,700
Not Holi, not hide and seek...
we had an accident.

60
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,230
- Accident?
- Yes, our boat collided with another boat.

61
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,780
Not a boat with a boat, but
a boat collided with a ship.

62
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,110
The boat came from here,
the ship from there...

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,490
The boat surged ahead,
the ship made a noise,

64
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,900
they collided, both
went around in circles...

65
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,536
No more going on the river.
I'll tell father.

66
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,310
Hey, I didn't have an accident.
Someone else did.

67
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,800
And to rescue that somebody,
I'd to jump into the river.

68
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
Well done, you valiant man!

69
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,470
But... who was this 'somebody'?

70
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
You don't know her.

71
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,890
- But you do. Right?
- God knows who she was!

72
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,290
- I mean, who 'he' was.
- Ha! Caught you red-handed, brother.

73
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,760
Tell me, what 'her' name is.

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,026
I don't know.

75
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,000
Wow! You saved this
'somebody's' life...

76
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,590
and 'somebody' didn't even
tell you her name?

77
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,300
I don't believe it.
She fell and you jumped...

78
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,470
she yelled, you turned; she was
drowning, but you got there...

79
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,900
and you saved her life. All this
took around 10 minutes.

80
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,860
You're back after two hours.

81
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,940
When did Harish say
he would return?

82
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,390
- You get ready, father. He's...
- Hey...

83
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,500
what are you doing?

84
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,090
Give me my clothes,
and go away. Go away.

85
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,270
Go!

86
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,360
I meant to say you get dressed,
he will be coming soon.

87
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,190
- How do you know?
- Isn't he my brother?

88
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,490
If he steps into the locality,
I can sniff out his arrival.

89
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,480
Sorry, father, I'm a little late.

90
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,920
Sorry, my foot! We'd told them
we would be there at 4.

91
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,070
- 2 hours late for the first meeting?
- Let's go, father. We'll soon be there.

92
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,510
Alright, my dear, we'll be late back.
Light the Diwali lamps, okay?

93
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,649
And yes, don't forget to light
the lamp near the holy basil.

94
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
And you must remember
to bring back sweets, father.

95
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,639
My friends are coming over
to celebrate Diwali.

96
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,750
Your friends are coming, not
your wedding procession, right?

97
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,710
The festival of lights is here

98
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,280
Look at the radiance it brings

99
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,220
The lamps of joy
brighten every home...

100
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,940
These rows of lamps
put the sun to shame

101
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,040
It's rare that such seasons
of brightness appear

102
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,890
Come, my friend, come...

103
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,500
Tonight, win your beloved's heart,
or lose yours to him

104
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,110
The festival of lights is here

105
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,630
Look at the radiance it brings

106
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,440
The lamps of joy
brighten every home...

107
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,626
These small showers of light

108
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,080
create a riot of colors

109
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,836
Lamps brighten every step

110
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,010
like a garden of fireflies

111
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,930
Come, my friend, come...

112
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,600
Tonight, let's openly play
the game of desire

113
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,880
The festival of lights is here

114
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,490
Look at the radiance it brings

115
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,590
The lamps of joy
brighten every home

116
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,980
Harish, you carry on, son.
I'll just go to the temple.

117
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,640
Uff! Are these girls
or an express train?

118
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,890
They run out without looking.

119
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,490
Pick up the bags.

120
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,676
- Uh, where's father?
- He's gone to the temple. He'll be back soon.

121
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Just pick up these things.

122
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,820
Do you know where we'd gone?

123
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,960
Khari Baoli, Chandni Chowk, Paratha
Gully, somewhere around here.

124
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,720
- No, no, no!
- Then where did you go?

125
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,010
If you knew, you'd be thrilled...

126
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,070
and dance with joy.

127
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,900
I'll surely dance, but first tell me
what you've accomplished.

128
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,750
I've hit the bullseye.

129
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,260
There will soon be music, a wedding
procession... sweets will be distributed.

130
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,160
Oh, really? So my
sister-in-law is arriving?

131
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,270
Congratulations, dear brother,
congratulations!

132
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,220
How is she? Made in Madras?
Or Kashmir?

133
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,510
- I mean, is she fair or dark?
- Sister-in-law?

134
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,680
Yes, of course, sister-in-law.

135
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,370
You will be at a loss for words
when you see her.

136
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,590
She's like a rose,
like the full moon...

137
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,890
She's coming to meet you
next Wednesday.

138
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,160
Oh ho! It's going to be
a lot of fun.

139
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,000
A king will turn into a slave.

140
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,290
The man who orders his sister around
will wait on his wife hand and foot.

141
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,910
Now she will rule
over this house.

142
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,970
She'll be the queen and
I'll be her prime minister.

143
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,610
Then I'll see how you cross
the borders without a passport.

144
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,700
- Gita, my dear...
- Go away. I won't talk to you.

145
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,290
You surreptitiously met my sister-in-law,
and didn't even tell me.

146
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,830
Oh oh... Sister-in-law?

147
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,730
You took him to see her!

148
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,970
What does a bookworm
know of love?

149
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,490
If I'd met her, we could
have squabbled...

150
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,810
I'd have pinched her,
she'd have caught me...

151
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,190
we'd both have smiled.

152
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,040
You should leave women's work
to women, father.

153
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,620
Today is Bhai Dooj. These people
won't spare me even on a holiday.

154
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,730
I wonder what's befallen
the bank today.

155
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,730
- Greetings, Mr. Cashier.
- Banwari, you're a crook.

156
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,560
- You want your penny daily.
- Wonder how it gets dusty..

157
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,540
Here, go enjoy your holiday.

158
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,740
Gentlemen, it's neither the bank's
silver jubilee today...

159
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,470
nor is it a farewall party
for a manager.

160
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,840
It is the magnetism
of our Radhe Mohan...

161
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,440
that has pulled us out
of our homes on a holiday.

162
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,920
Mr. Radhe Mohan, the custodian
of our treasury...

163
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,010
is such an honest man...

164
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,550
that if everyone in
the country were like him...

165
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,070
people would sleep
with open doors.

166
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,650
The country would stop
manufacturing locks.

167
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,920
With our cashier's
kind permission...

168
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,520
I'd like to narrate
an incident to you.

169
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,050
Once his daughter fell
ill with pneumonia.

170
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,290
The date was the 30th.

171
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,230
In 24 hours, it would be
time to pay the salaries.

172
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,750
He needed Rs.30.

173
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,890
Had he wished, the cashier could
have taken it from the bank's safe.

174
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,940
He distributed the salaries. He could
have taken Rs.30 less the next day.

175
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,479
But, no. He pawned
his watch for Rs.30.

176
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,420
The next day, he reclaimed
his watch for Rs.31.

177
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,220
This paper proves this story.

178
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,840
I'll not divulge
how I got this paper.

179
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,650
But, wrapped in this very paper...

180
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,470
on behalf of Northern India Bank...

181
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,500
I present this gold watch
to our honorable cashier.

182
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,370
Money fulfills man's needs.

183
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,070
But integrity earns you honor,
my dear.

184
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,520
The day you become a lawyer...

185
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,780
I'll place this watch
in your pocket.

186
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,040
So its ticking will remind you,
even after my death...

187
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,250
that integrity is the biggest
treasure in the world.

188
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,500
It's of use in both worlds.

189
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,160
Who has seen
the next world, Najjo?

190
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,690
I swear upon your youth, if the custodian
of death were to hear you sing...

191
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,910
he too would wander aimlessly
around Delhi for love of you.

192
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,490
- Isn't that right sir?
- You're too kind to say so, sir.

193
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,086
So let's hear that song that
made me restless with yearning.

194
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,250
- God is pure.
- Lord Shiva is great.

195
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,890
- God is pure.
- Come, destroyer of suffering.

196
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,760
Take a seat.

197
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,790
Don't be afraid, Najjo.
They are enlightened souls.

198
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,130
Their blessings can help
you attain the impossible.

199
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,850
Whatever I have is due to them.

200
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,850
May you be blessed.

201
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,610
- Salutations.
- May you be blessed.

202
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,010
Najjo Begum, these great men have
come from beyond the icy mountains.

203
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,890
Let's add some zing
to this gathering, sir.

204
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,390
It brought oppression,
it brought tyranny...

205
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,760
this cruel season of love

206
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,836
What did I know about love?

207
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,760
About the impish mischief
that lights up the eyes?

208
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,436
But, wounded in love,
my heart told me...

209
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,060
it understood what it meant
for the world to end

210
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,630
It brought oppression,
it brought tyranny...

211
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,960
this cruel season of love

212
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:15,260
Strange indeed were
the days of my youth

213
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,410
My sanctuary was far beyond
any bolts of lightning

214
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,990
But once I attained the bloom
of youth, oh, gracious...

215
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,200
My peace of mind, indeed, my heart
from my breast departed

216
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,950
It brought oppression,
it brought tyranny...

217
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,240
this cruel season of love

218
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,680
Where are those days
of leisure...

219
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,490
when I could sit awhile,
to hold my breath?

220
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,316
These ailments
afflicted me since...

221
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,990
the day I subsumed
myself in your name

222
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,510
It brought opression,
it brought tyranny...

223
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,760
this cruel season of love

224
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,100
You were wonderful today,
Begum! Wonderful!

225
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,360
- The mind is pleased
- The soul is at peace.

226
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,910
This is Najjo.

227
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,300
Those shooting stars that
sometimes fall to the earth...

228
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,260
come to self-destruct against
the walls of her abode.

229
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,120
And we applaud this
very statement.

230
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,160
After Nawab Wajid Ali Shah,
this sense of humor...

231
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,740
can only be heard here sometimes.
What do you say, Khansaab?

232
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,980
You took the words
out of my mouth!

233
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,860
Take this, Begum. My car
will drop you home.

234
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,320
Excuse me, Master. Now, we'll
discuss religion and spirituality.

235
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,840
Najjo Begum improved Loknath's
life in this world.

236
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,880
But only these men can
improve my afterlife.

237
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,980
You're right.

238
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,540
- Let's make a move, Khansaab.
- Yes, let's leave.

239
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,590
Come, Bandhu miya,
come, Kanan miya. Let's leave...

240
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,860
- Come, my dear. Greetings, sirs.
- May you be blessed.

241
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,620
Come, my dear.

242
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,770
Escuse me... Namaste.

243
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,760
I'm presenting these Queen of the Night
(night jasmine) blossoms during the day.

244
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,250
These blossoms are slightly
wilted at present.

245
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,120
They regain their bloom at night...

246
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,630
under the shadow of the stars.
That room will fill with fragrance...

247
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,400
where they abide,
where you reside...

248
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,100
- and perhaps, some day, I...
- Nonsense!

249
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,990
Arre... arre... excuse me,
please listen to my dialogue...

250
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,070
I made the great poet, D.N. Madhok,
write it especially for you.

251
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,590
Aunty!

252
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,180
You are amazing, aunty.

253
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,340
So this means what I heard
is absolutely true?

254
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,980
- Really? What have you heard?
- The rumor in town is that...

255
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,750
my aunt is more interested in
her lipstick than in her husband.

256
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,590
My family has suffocated me.

257
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,146
But how can I deny myself
the pleasures of youth?

258
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,170
May you always
remain young, aunty!

259
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,966
But if you used your brains as much
as you use your tongue...

260
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,410
you'd have done better.

261
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,220
Your husband has about
Rs.6-7 lakhs in cash.

262
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,970
As if I don't know.

263
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,590
I know everything.

264
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,660
Do you also know he's looking
for a husband for Usha?

265
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,506
No one else will be
Usha's bridegroom but you.

266
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,130
I don't want your Usha.

267
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,560
The bride who comes to
Loknath's house, will come alone.

268
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,150
- Not with her father in tow.
- What do you mean?

269
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,950
I mean, they want a boy who...

270
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,110
who will be Usha's dutiful husband
and her father's obedient servant.

271
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,430
Which means, that after marriage, all
his wealth will be inherited by Usha...

272
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,780
the father will live
with Usha, and you?

273
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,870
You will get a monthly
pension of Rs.200.

274
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,470
Pension? How's that possible?

275
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,940
Hey, your fury will only
fuel their victory.

276
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,690
And your total defeat.
Understood?

277
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
Oh, just a minute.
Here, take this.

278
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,640
Take pleasure in these night jasmine
blooms, and sing your nephew's praises.

279
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,990
That whenever your nephew visits,
he reveals confidential information.

280
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,230
A-ha! I forgot to
tell you one thing.

281
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,700
Listen... hot news.

282
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,840
I was coming, she was leaving...

283
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,410
I stopped. She didn't.

284
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,580
Then I presented her with
these smiling blooms.

285
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,540
She broke their
hearts too, aunty!

286
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm tired of wooing her.
Good bye!

287
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,240
Arre, Loku! If I don't bring her
and throw her at your feet...

288
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,990
then my name is not
lchhapuran Devi!

289
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,070
Don't make promises, aunty.
Just sit down.

290
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,580
I know very well that this
is not your cup of tea.

291
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,320
- And who else can do something?
- A bride is one whom the groom likes.

292
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,930
The truth is...

293
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,280
I don't care for
your step-daughter...

294
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,030
or for her father's wealth.

295
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,320
All I want is...

296
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,230
that you don't have to
beg in future.

297
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,420
You must know that your nephew always
says something of great significance.

298
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,570
What are you doing?
Are you blind?

299
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,320
Help! Someone, please help!

300
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm dead! I'm dead!
Won't someone come to my aid?

301
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,150
Please, someone, please help me!

302
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,450
Help me! Please help me!

303
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,220
Help! Help!

304
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,510
Someone help me!

305
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,330
Oh my god!

306
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,090
I would have been dead today
if God hadn't sent you.

307
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,310
How do I thank you, son?

308
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,270
There's no need for that.
I only did my duty.

309
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,280
Come, I'll take you home.

310
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,990
Bravo. Yes, my dear,
let's go.

311
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,700
God!

312
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,480
Thank you, my dear, thank you.

313
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,760
Why don't you wash up
while tea is being made?

314
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,270
You'll feel fresh. I mean,
you'll feel better.

315
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,090
- Where's the bathroom?
- Bathroom? Right there.

316
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,910
Go straight, right to left,
left to right... I mean...

317
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,180
lll-mannered lout!
Who are you?

318
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,580
- You!
- You...?

319
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,610
- How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?

320
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,300
- I live here.
- So this is your house.

321
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,900
So this time, we both...

322
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,210
had an accident in your house.

323
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,390
An accident here,
another accident there...

324
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,920
I wonder why so many
accidents occur!

325
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,670
God works in mysterious ways.
What do you think?

326
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,380
I'll show you God's
mysterious ways!

327
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,580
- Softly, speak softly. That fat man is sitting there.
- What did you say?

328
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,010
- That's my daddy... - Really?
- Who will have you arrested.

329
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
- Really? - Usha, my child...
- Coming, daddy!

330
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
Let me get out of here.

331
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,940
The police will throw you out,
or daddy will kick you out.

332
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,396
What made you come here! Why did
you come? How did you come?

333
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,290
How do I know how
or why accidents occur?

334
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,520
What had to happen
has happened, Miss.

335
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,200
- Usha, my dear...
- Coming, daddy!

336
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,300
- I don't know what to do.
- Shall I tell you?

337
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,940
- Go close daddy's eyes while I slip out.
- Keep quiet! - Alright.

338
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,520
- Where are you going?
- I'm following you.

339
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,940
- I'm going to daddy.
- So I'll meet him too.

340
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,010
If he asks who I am,
tell him I'm your future...

341
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,980
- What? - Oh, forgive me, I mean...
- Do you want a whipping?

342
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,510
- Keep quiet, and shut the door.
- Thank you.

343
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,880
Dear, please make some tea.
Make it really special.

344
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,390
Make it yourself, such that the
aroma and color entrance you.

345
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,640
- I'll just get it, daddy.
- And listen, get some sweets too.

346
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,170
- It's not often that such guests come home.
- Okay.

347
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,890
Come, my son, come.
Have a seat.

348
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,460
Tell me, what's your name?

349
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,220
- Harish.
- Excellent!

350
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,310
What do you do?

351
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,750
- I've just finished writing my law exams.
- Excellent!

352
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
- You'll definitely get through?

353
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,080
I've never failed yet.

354
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,549
Excellent! Then this means...

355
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,750
that by next year, you will be
practicing in the High Court.

356
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,980
Not next year.
Next month itself.

357
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,540
Excellent! What's your
father's name?

358
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,130
Mr. Radhe Mohan. He's a cashier
at the Northern India Bank.

359
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,886
Excellent! So you're
our cashier's son?

360
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,906
Yes. Do you know him?

361
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,280
Who doesn't know him?
He's a great soul.

362
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,170
People consider him second
only to God.

363
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,350
- Well done! What's wrong, dear?
- Nothing, just an accident.

364
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,460
This world, spinning, is also
an accident, my son.

365
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,780
Minor accidents occur
almost daily here.

366
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,510
Look at us. It was an accident
that caused us to meet like this.

367
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,226
- This is my daughter, Usha.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

368
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,360
She's written her
BA exams this year.

369
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,790
Well done! I suppose
she will get through?

370
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,100
- She has never failed yet.
- Excellent!

371
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,180
- Then she'll graduate next year.
- Not next year, but next month.

372
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,380
Excellent! See, if girls begin to
be educated in this manner...

373
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,000
our country will progress.

374
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,080
When men begin to sit
idly at home...

375
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,220
then what can women do but
help the country progress?

376
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,430
- Well done!
- Under these circumstances, I think I should make the tea.

377
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,860
My dear, this is Harish,
an upcoming lawyer.

378
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,670
He saved my life today.

379
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,980
Or I'd have suffered
a terrible accident.

380
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,310
- Accident?
- Yes. Accident.

381
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,710
You aren't hurt, are you, daddy?

382
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,100
Hadn't it been for him, God knows
what would have happened.

383
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,090
Thank you very much.

384
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,860
My dear, do switch on the radio
to entertain our lawyer.

385
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,670
Very well.

386
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,450
Now, here, from
our amateur program...

387
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,220
listen to a song by
well-known singer, Gita.

388
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,196
Our eyes exchanged
exhilirating signals

389
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,170
We lost our hearts,
in conversation

390
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,170
A wonderful bird came flying
from lands unknown

391
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:42,420
He sat on my terrace and trilled
this world is a fete of love

392
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,770
He spoke so sweetly,
his words pierced my heart

393
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,770
Our eyes exchanged
exhilirating signals

394
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,940
We lost our hearts,
in conversation

395
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:24,660
All that seems
strange, initially...

396
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,930
turn gradually into
encounters of love

397
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,130
Hearts beat when our eyes meet;
what an amazing game is this?

398
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,100
Our eyes exchanged
exhilirating signals

399
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,260
We lost our hearts,
in conversation

400
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,220
If today, it's but
a trifling matter...

401
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,130
Tomorrow, it will be
the talk of the town

402
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:24,350
Where the flame smolders,
the moth will follow

403
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,610
And two strangers will
unexpectedly become lovers

404
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,690
Our eyes exchanged
exhilirating signals

405
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,610
We lost our hearts,
in conversation

406
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,630
- What a sweet voice.
- Sounds like a cuckoo singing.

407
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,820
This is the first time
I've heard her sing.

408
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,840
- She has outshone the best singers.
- There's no doubt about that!

409
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,240
Truly, singing is magic.

410
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,730
The sort of magic that transports
a person elsewhere.

411
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,160
I wish I could keep
listening to her sing.

412
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,620
- I'll definitely meet her.
- Yes, you should.

413
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,661
Honoring an artiste is the real
appreciation of their art.

414
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,790
- Okay, Rai Saheb. I beg your leave.
- Leaving so soon, dear boy?

415
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,350
Alright. Let me
see you to the car.

416
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,210
The driver will drop you home.

417
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,100
- Driver!
- Yes, sir? Drop the gentleman home.

418
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,400
- Namaste.
- Bless you, my son.

419
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,760
- What are you thinking of, daddy?
- What any father with a daughter...

420
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,330
thinks of all the time, my dear.

421
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,630
Thank God this thought has
finally come to you.

422
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,610
I've a young man in mind...

423
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,470
he earns Rs.10,000.
He has no vices whatsoever.

424
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,090
He is wedded to spirituality.

425
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,060
Namaste, aunty.
Namaste, Rai Saheb.

426
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,120
- Namaste, Miss Usha.
- Where are you coming from, dear?

427
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,120
I'd gone to the orphanage.

428
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,620
There are 350 children
there, poor souls.

429
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,190
I give them 2 pairs of clothes and
a pair of shoes each every year.

430
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,810
Well done!
What novel is this?

431
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,850
- It's the Bhagavad Gita.
- Oh?

432
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,290
I didn't get the time to read it in the
morning. Do you have incense, aunty?

433
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,070
Of course. Go to my room.

434
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,830
Forgive me, but one should
never owe God anything.

435
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,610
This is his favorite hobby.
Now he'll grieve the whole day...

436
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,380
- since he returned
from the orphanage.

437
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,266
- Hasn't he ever gone to a mental asylum?
- What do you mean?

438
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,640
I mean, if he went there,
he should never return.

439
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,050
I've heard it said that serving the
mentally ill will wash off all your sins.

440
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,230
Honestly, we aren't here to see the
girl. We've come to show you the boy.

441
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,000
Speak softly, sir. She thinks that
I'm the one getting engaged.

442
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,570
If she overhears this, she
won't come before you.

443
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,050
- You are very smart, young man!
- That I am.

444
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,960
- Please come in. - Namaste, sir.
- Namaste, my dear sir, namaste.

445
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,460
You've obliged us by coming here.
Please take a seat.

446
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:00,210
You're embarrassing me, sir.
Sit down, do.

447
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,590
- You sit down too.
- I'll be right back.

448
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,770
Wonderful!

449
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,190
- Very nice indeed!
- Don't you think I'm beautiful?

450
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:17,340
100%. They'll be
very impressed.

451
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,810
Quick, bring the tea.
They have already arrived.

452
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,760
Brother, bring the sweets.

453
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,920
- Did you see her? How's my sister-in-law?
- Very nice. Go see for yourself.

454
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,470
- Yes, of course. - That had to happen.
- Of course. - Yes, yes.

455
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,730
I would like to greet
all of you.

456
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,360
- And on behalf of all of us...
- A greeting for me?

457
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,090
Come, my sister.
Sit beside me.

458
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,630
Why not?

459
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,150
Who else will I sit beside
except you?

460
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,000
- This is Gita, my precious daughter.
- May you live long.

461
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,370
And this is my
precious brother, Mohan.

462
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,600
And this is our charming Harish.

463
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,950
- Now tell me your name.
- Excuse me?

464
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,900
- They call me Mala [necklace].
- You're truly like a pearl necklace.

465
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,020
You will light up the world of anyone
who is lucky enough to get you.

466
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,270
And your name is Gita.

467
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,480
The man who reads you
will be blessed.

468
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,360
Look, they've already begun
teasing each other.

469
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,090
The relationship between
sisters-in-law is such.

470
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,770
It's a joyous union, Lalaji.

471
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,100
The tea is getting cold
amidst this conversation.

472
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,970
- Oh, I forgot all about it.
- Shall I make it?

473
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,010
I'll drink the tea you prepare,
the day...

474
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,650
- I come with the wedding procession.\n-On
that day, I'll feed you sweets.

475
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,200
You'll feed me sweets? It's my
brother, Harish, who will eat them.

476
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,820
And what will you feed
my brother, Mohan?

477
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,290
Whatever is left-over.

478
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,670
Brother, I like her.

479
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,740
Shall I say 'yes'
on your behalf?

480
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,590
Do you want your marriage arranged
for next month? Or next year?

481
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,610
Why delay auspicious moments? Let's
have a quick engagement and wedding.

482
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,160
You won't say anything?
That means you agree.

483
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,570
- Father...
- Yes? Yes?

484
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,920
I've got the daughter-in-law
I've desired.

485
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,880
Dear sir, I accept this proposal.

486
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,400
You've honored us, Lalaji.

487
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,880
A huge burden has been lifted.

488
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,850
Mala, complete the first ritual of the
engagement ceremony, my dear.

489
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,100
Give me your hand,
my sister-in-law.

490
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,210
Sister-in-law?

491
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,710
Brother Harish!

492
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,990
You have a lovely daughter,
my dear sir.

493
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
But she's your daughter
from today onwards, Lalaji.

494
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,610
- Please have a sweet.
- Please take one, too.

495
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,690
Here, son.

496
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,400
A mother might forget
to nurse her baby.

497
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,920
But this man never forgets
to be on time.

498
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,680
The clock chimes 9.30
and the cashier steps in.

499
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,070
Namaste, sir.
What's happening?

500
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,190
- Er... that...
- Namaste, sir.

501
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,150
The manager is asking for you.

502
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,160
- Hmm?
- The manager is asking for you.

503
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,970
- What are my orders, Manager saab?
- Mr. Radhe Mohan...

504
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,640
- You have to go to Bombay.
- Bombay?

505
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,110
Yes. It's a quite a large
sum of money...

506
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,540
and the party wants
to be paid in cash.

507
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,910
I can't trust anyone except you.

508
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,580
Go by the Frontier Mail tomorrow.
Your seat has been booked

509
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,300
- As you wish.
- And here's the draft for Rs.95,000.

510
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,010
There are 5 partners in the company
Take separate receipts from each.

511
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,140
Very well.

512
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,980
Excuse me, where does
Miss Gita live?

513
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,830
- Geeta, who?
- The Geeta who sings on the radio?

514
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,900
- On the radio...?
- Yes. She sings very well.

515
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,700
Excuse me, I don't live here.

516
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,760
- Please ask someone else.
- Very well.

517
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,400
Gita! Gita!

518
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,636
- Hey, she's come! She's come...
- Who has come?

519
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,180
- Frontier Mail!
- Frontier Mail?

520
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,080
The one you keep
pestering me about.

521
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,596
- Ah-ha! So that 'someone'
has finally come here.

522
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,936
She heard you sing
on the radio...

523
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,870
and impressed by your song,
is coming to meet you.

524
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,536
But, listen... she shouldn't find out
that we are siblings. Understand?

525
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,110
- Why?
- Only then will it be fun!

526
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,050
Don't worry.

527
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,510
I'll act so well that
the guest will be impressed.

528
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,350
She had an accident with you the
other day, now she'll have one with me.

529
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,790
Be careful. Don't give
the game away.

530
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,800
I'm the sister of a
soon-to-be-lawyer.

531
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,850
How dare I mess up?

532
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,700
- Hmm?
- Come on, move aside.

533
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,890
- Namaste, Miss.
- Namaste.

534
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,910
- Are you Gita?
- Yes.

535
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,910
- What's it?
- My name is Usha.

536
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,550
I heard you on the radio
and came to meet you.

537
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,330
Please come in. Did you
like the song so much?

538
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,480
Yes, I'd love to sit
and listen to you all day.

539
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,220
A cuckoo has a sweet voice
but is not beautiful...

540
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,670
But God has blessed you
with both beauty and talent.

541
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,390
God wasn't miserly
with your beauty either.

542
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,790
You are beauty personified.

543
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,590
Your speech is also lyrical.

544
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,410
And why not? Music and poetry
go hand-in-hand, after all.

545
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,760
Please take a seat.
I'll get some tea.

546
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,940
- Please don't take the trouble.
- It's no trouble at all.

547
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,570
Sit down, do.

548
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,696
- Y..you?!
- It happened just as I feared.

549
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,360
- I mean, another accident?
- Why are you here?

550
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,870
And I want to know
why you're here.

551
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,050
- This is my..
- This, too, is your house?

552
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,910
- Oh, it's not mine. It belongs
to someone else.

553
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,750
Oh. So, this time, we meet
by accident in a stranger's house...

554
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,090
An accident here,
an accident there...

555
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,280
- an accident at this turn...
- Keep quiet! - Alright.

556
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,050
How did you get this photograph?

557
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,050
What does it matter
where I got it from?

558
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,950
Aren't they a lovely couple?

559
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,390
Usha, you can't hide your beauty
behind a muslin veil.

560
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,880
Truth be told...

561
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,960
my brother hasn't looked
so handsome in a photo before.

562
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,700
- Brother? - Yes.
- He's your brother? - Uh-huh.

563
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,140
So you two siblings have been
making fun of me!

564
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,530
Why shouldn't I make
fun of you? I thought...

565
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,530
my brother's choice would
turn out to be fake.

566
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,810
But she turned out
to be pure gold.

567
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,090
Now I'll get myself some tea
with 5tsps of sugar, okay?

568
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,470
Tell me, when did I
get this photo taken?

569
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,230
This... accident happened
by coincidence?

570
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,320
- But such coincidences don't occur all the time, Miss Usha.
- Excuse me?

571
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,890
I'm taking this photo with me.

572
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,270
- What will you do with it?
- What will I do?

573
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,650
- That I don't quite know myself.
- But I do.

574
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,320
- What do you know?
- Only that you will face it and say...

575
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,020
"Keep quiet!" "Shut up!"
"Mannerless fool!"

576
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,440
"Nonsense!" "Idiot!"

577
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,860
These titles are only for you...

578
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,360
not for the photograph.

579
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,640
- Thanks.
- Gita!

580
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,736
Oh, that's father. Gita!

581
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,330
- What is it?
- Father is home!

582
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,880
What will you tell
father about her?

583
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,230
I'll place my hand on my heart
and lower my gaze...

584
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,670
- he'll understand.
- Gita!

585
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,700
- Namaste, sir.
- Namaste, my dear. Who are you?

586
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,406
She's my sis-... she's
my friend, Bhagirathi, father.

587
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,030
Oh, alright.
May you live long.

588
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,860
Gita, my dear, pack my bag.
I have to prepare to leave.

589
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,540
- Where are you going, father?
- I'm leaving for Bombay by the Mail tomorrow.

590
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,090
I've to make a large
cash payment to a client.

591
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,940
- Okay, Gita, I must leave.
- You will come again, won't you? - Of course.

592
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,900
Look, my beloved's love
dances in my eyes

593
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,060
Like a gentle drizzle
or the notes of a sitar

594
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:30,826
Like Spring, gently
approaching gardens

595
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:35,310
Look, my beloved's love
dances in my eyes

596
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:14,030
Who is it who spoke
such sweet words of love?

597
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,580
Swaying, swaggering,
comes a night of love

598
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,670
A heart spoke A heart listened

599
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:41,516
And quietly, silently,
they acquiesced

600
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,850
Look, my beloved's love
dances in my eyes

601
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,040
Like a gentle drizzle
or the notes of a sitar

602
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,820
Like Spring, gently
approaching the gardens

603
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:42,400
O stars and moon,
what do you know of love?

604
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,120
Go away, don't ask me
the name of my beloved

605
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,800
Dear wind, please go away too,
don't ask me his abode

606
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,566
This is the first Spring
approaching my garden

607
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,020
Look, my beloved's love
is dancing in my eyes

608
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,060
Like a gentle drizzle
or the notes of a sitar

609
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,756
Like Spring, gently
approaching the gardens

610
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:31,150
Look, my beloved's love
is dancing in my eyes

611
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:43,010
Bravo! Today, my Usha is
drowning in a sea of melody.

612
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,246
- What is the matter, my dear?
- Uh... I... I met him today.

613
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,830
- Who?
- That girl, whose song we heard on the radio that day?

614
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,256
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- You liked her singing too, didn't you?

615
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,250
Of course! She had
such a melodious voice.

616
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,510
It isn't just her voice; her looks
and behavior are also pleasing.

617
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,630
My Usha is no less
melodious than a cuckoo.

618
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,120
They must have been happy
to meet you.

619
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,440
Yes. They were very
hospitable indeed.

620
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,160
'They' were? So was
someone else there?

621
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,050
Yes, daddy.
He came there, too.

622
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,190
- He...
- He?

623
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,350
- He? Who?
- Oh, the one...

624
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,580
to whom you kept saying,
'Excellent!' 'Excellent!'

625
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,510
Bravo! So Harish was
also present there?

626
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,210
Yes, Miss Gita is his sister.

627
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,470
Excellent! So they are siblings?

628
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,840
They are so good
together, daddy.

629
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,640
- And the cashier...
- Oh, so he was also there?

630
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,150
He wasn't there. He came later.
He was in a hurry.

631
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,470
- He had to go to Bombay.
- Excellent!

632
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,320
Bombay is the
best city in India.

633
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,800
I would've gone with him to
visit too, but your mother...

634
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,640
Daddy, he's not
going on a holiday.

635
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,330
- He has to make a large cash payment to a client.
- Cash payment?

636
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,980
- Excellent! So that's the reason!
- Yes, daddy.

637
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:32,000
Harish, my son, cable me
as soon as your results are out.

638
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,596
- I'll send you the address of my hotel.
- Okay, father.

639
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,910
Don't forget to get
my bangles, father.

640
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,750
And you don't forget to
light the lamp to the holy basil.

641
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,970
I'm sorry! I thought I was alone
in this compartment.

642
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,020
Forgive me. Did I mistakenly enter
the ladies' compartment?

643
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,590
Not at all. In fact, I always travel
in the men's compartment.

644
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,590
Look, when the ladies' compartment
is full, it's filled with their chatter...

645
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,430
and when it's empty, there's the danger
of thieves. But here, there's neither.

646
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,690
Er... may I sit here?

647
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,040
Of course. Please sit down.

648
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,700
Thank you.

649
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,360
I'm weird. We met
and talked...

650
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,630
and I didn't even ask your name.

651
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,240
I am called Radhe Mohan.

652
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,250
I am simply Roma.

653
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,170
- Are you travelling alone?
- I'm all alone at present.

654
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,300
For what it's worth,
I'm married.

655
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,990
My husband had gone to Europe.

656
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,530
He's reaching Bombay this
week. I'm going to meet him.

657
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,210
- Chocolate?
- That's for kids.

658
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,460
My husband loves to eat it.

659
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,970
- He is young, right?
- Excuse me?

660
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,540
- He must be a couple of years older to you.
- Oh...

661
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,470
So your husband is elderly?

662
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,560
- Do you smoke?
- No.

663
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,310
- Drink?
- No.

664
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,340
Very good! My husband
smokes and drinks.

665
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,090
No wonder he has bouts
of cough in the morning...

666
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,250
and his fingers tremble
throughout the day.

667
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,820
Just shake hands with me.
Please!

668
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,360
Ooh, mummy! What a grip!

669
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,420
This grip! This is what's called
a man's grip!

670
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,020
I think we're reaching a station.

671
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,760
- Where do you think you're going?
- Madam, I'm called Mirza Rusva.

672
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,090
May I sit beside you
if you don't mind?

673
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:19,550
- Beside me? - Yes. - Do sit down.
- Thank you very much, sir.

674
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,150
- There are too many flies here.
- Madam, you are right.

675
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,010
This place is called Sugarville. Sugar
and flies are the main products here.

676
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,000
May I present some perfume
for your amusement?

677
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,260
That's my business in Bombay.
I'm going there now.

678
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,210
- Bombay?
- Yes.

679
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,690
- This seems to be your first trip to Bombay.
- Yes.

680
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,870
- Will you be staying long?
- Just a couple of days.

681
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,650
A couple of days at least. By then,
my husband will also return.

682
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,380
There are good hotels here?

683
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,240
All that glitters is not gold.

684
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,440
But we always stay
in a small hotel.

685
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:11,150
Neat and clean.
Fresh air, fresh views...

686
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,730
- They wash the vegetables in potassium permanganate before cooking.
- Oh.

687
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:17,036
- They get their ghee from Punjab.
- I see...

688
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,480
But passing trains do
bother the patrons a little.

689
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,880
- The railway tracks run close, that's why.
- What's the name of the hotel?

690
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,410
- Aaraam (Rest).
- Aaraam.

691
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,540
Wonderful! What can I say
about Bombay?

692
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,366
A man comes here
in excellent form...

693
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:35,450
and in four days, is turned
into a lizard.

694
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,630
Here's Bombay!

695
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:54,226
Namaste, Ma'am. You should have cabled
us. Nandu would have picked you up.

696
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:59,060
I'm familiar with the streets of Bombay.
Ah, yes, he's new to the city.

697
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,860
- Make sure he's comfortable.
- Nandu! - Yes, sir.

698
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,040
- Take his luggage to Room No. 10.
- Okay.

699
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,710
- And open Room No. 9 for Madam.\n-Okay.

700
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,110
- Ghotu! - Yes, sir!
- Go, go!

701
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,820
Er..., please go ahead. Let me
make a few calls.

702
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,110
Well, my magician!

703
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,920
- Good morning, boss!
- How far have you reached?

704
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,500
I have him eating from my hands.

705
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,050
Roma can entrap even
the angels, boss!

706
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,200
These are mere mortals.

707
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,260
The moment you appear before me

708
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,470
and show me a glimpse
of your face

709
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,590
You do realize

710
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:05,630
you rouse the passions
within my breast

711
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,900
When you hold my hand

712
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,930
And express your love for me

713
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,320
You assuage an ache

714
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,340
and fan the flames of another

715
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,040
My heart's restless when
you're far away from me

716
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,400
and the beats quicken
when you come near

717
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,920
The flames may be invisible

718
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,100
but they smolder in my heart

719
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:09,970
Why do you come for few moments

720
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,920
just to douse the flame?

721
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,150
You assuage an ache

722
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,220
and fan the flames of another

723
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,680
The moment you appear before me

724
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:30,560
and show me a glimpse
of your face

725
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,740
You do realize

726
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,710
you rouse the passions
within my breast

727
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,290
This love has made my heart

728
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,820
crazed with passion for so long

729
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:19,700
The world is the same,
but it's made me

730
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,340
a stranger to myself

731
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,120
With the exception of yourself

732
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,220
you forget everything in the world

733
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:36,300
You assuage an ache

734
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,270
and fan the flames of another

735
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:44,580
The moment you appear before me

736
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,660
and show me a glimpse
of your face

737
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:52,670
You do realize

738
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,750
you rouse the passions
within my breast

739
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,150
For how long will we separate
only to meet again?

740
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,590
And meet only to separate again?

741
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,330
The words that you said to me

742
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:39,690
Are just what I wanted to say

743
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:43,670
The few moments that you meet me

744
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,480
and sweep me off my feet

745
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:51,600
You assuage an ache

746
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,690
And fan the flames of another

747
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,070
This is the limit, aunty! This is
the limit. I can't take it anymore!

748
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:06,020
- What happened?
- I've decided I'll never come here again.

749
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,950
I won't look, won't feel jealous.
I won't pine away either.

750
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,466
- But what's wrong?
- Let me tell you, aunty...

751
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,300
this lipstick will ruin you
one day.

752
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,610
Go see what your step-daughter and
the cashier's son are doing in the garden.

753
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,196
- What are they doing?
- Conspiring to pension you off.

754
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,125
Playing at love to sow the seeds of
your destruction. I say, say something.

755
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:26,749
- Say what?
- That your nephew is always right.

756
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,090
You lit the fire.
I put it off.

757
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:55,610
Silly girl! Can a puff douse
the fires in our hearts?

758
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:00,330
- Then how are they doused?
- By love's gentle breezes.

759
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,040
- Usha?
- Hmm?

760
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,100
When you're in front of me...

761
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,230
I feel like this world
is heaven on earth.

762
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:15,629
I pray that the heavens
will continue to smile on us.

763
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:20,390
And that we're free
to sing the songs of love.

764
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,530
- What's wrong, Usha?
- Nothing.

765
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,660
I fear, sometimes...

766
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,300
that someone may
set our world ablaze.

767
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,429
Don't say that, Usha.

768
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,920
Hey, Rai Saheb, listen to me,
whatever happened to your brains?

769
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:42,709
Listen! Stop right there!

770
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:52,210
You always arrive like an
earthquake! What's the matter?

771
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,380
Take a look at what's
happening in the garden.

772
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,540
That cashier's son is
destroying your honor.

773
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:59,266
Will you throw him out or should I
ask the servants to kick him out?

774
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,760
Your only grouse is that he's
the cashier's son. isn't that so?

775
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,530
- So? Are they our equals?
- They are much better than us.

776
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:09,750
We don't have the reputation that
the cashier has in this city.

777
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,120
These are not your words,
but that of your darling Usha.

778
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,690
Compare him to my Loku, and he'll
seem like a man who polishes boots.

779
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,550
But Usha has to like him too.

780
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:22,380
Were Loku not my nephew, your
darling Usha would have been all over him.

781
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,220
Excuse me... may I come in?

782
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,520
Oh... do come in,
please come in.

783
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,010
Oh... so you're going sightseeing?

784
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,160
No, no, I'm going to the bank.

785
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:13,140
I'll encash a draft
so I can pay the clients.

786
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,100
You're going to the bank?
If you don't mind...

787
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,880
may I come with you?

788
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:23,230
This is Bombay. You need
more than one pair of eyes here.

789
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:28,040
Last year, my sister was
robbed of Rs.20,000 here.

790
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,730
Very well.

791
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,730
Though I'm in the habit
of being alert.

792
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:37,090
You have no idea
how unsafe this place is.

793
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,340
Okay, then let's go.

794
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,160
- It must be a nuisance to you.
- Not at all.

795
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,076
You're my guest, Mr. Cashier.

796
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,790
- Come, let's go.
- Yes, let's.

797
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,320
Come on!

798
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,840
Ask the cashier to get
Rs.95,000 in 100 rupee notes.

799
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:05,070
Manager saab...

800
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,800
- may I use your telephone?
- Of course. Here. - Thank you.

801
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:19,090
- Bell, Moon, Stars & Company...
- Here, let me help.

802
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,830
Bell, Moon & Stars Company...

803
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,860
- Hello? Hotel Aaraam.
- Hello?

804
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,930
Hello? Hello?

805
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,660
Three hellos! That means,
it's for the boss.

806
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,440
Bell Moon & Stars Company?
Speak here please. Here you go.

807
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:03,600
Hello? This is cashier
Radhe Mohan speaking.

808
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,690
Yes. I'll be there
in half an hour.

809
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,140
- Please call your lawyer.
- Can you come in the evening?

810
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,340
Our lawyer has gone to Pune.

811
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,560
Where are you staying?

812
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,320
Hotel Aaraam?
Room number 10?

813
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,190
Alright. Look...

814
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,330
we'll be there at
9.30 p.m. sharp.

815
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,090
- Of course. Of course.
- Alright, then.

816
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,080
Here.

817
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:49,410
The cashier killed Roma
and then killed himself.

818
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,560
One dead body in the room,
the other on the rail tracks!

819
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:58,950
The cashier from Northern India Bank
kills Roma and himself.

820
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,730
One dead body in the room,
the other on the rail tracks!

821
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,230
Get today's newspaper!

822
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,910
You are now dead!
Dead to the world!

823
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,400
- No, no, I'm alive!
- Notoriety is worse than death.

824
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:18,850
And death is better
than a life of infamy.

825
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,190
- But... my kids...
- Forget them.

826
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,920
Stifle your feelings of affection.
Now you're not cashier Radhe Mohan...

827
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,330
but a burden on this earth
and a blot on society.

828
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,610
The shadow of your disgrace
will ruin their lives.

829
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:36,140
Today, you have neither
home nor family...

830
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,130
Forget them! Forget them!

831
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:45,380
- Oh, Usha, my darling! - What's the matter, daddy?
- Look at this, my dear...

832
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:50,680
See what's in the paper... Harish,
son of cashier, Radhe Mohan...

833
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,670
has broken all past records
in his law exams.

834
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,350
He's come first!

835
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,040
My dear, find out at once when the
cashier is returning from Bombay.

836
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,240
The front page has
news of the son...

837
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,060
and the next page has
news of the father.

838
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:08,560
When is he coming?

839
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,410
Turn the page.
You will find out.

840
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,120
Two murders in Bombay.

841
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,900
The price of an old man's
love is Rs.95,000.

842
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,860
And two lives.

843
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:30,220
It is said that Radhe Mohan,
the cashier of Northern India Bank...

844
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,140
murdered a young woman named
Roma and then killed himself.

845
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,840
The beauty lies dead
in Hotel Aaraam...

846
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,060
while her lover's corpse
lies on the railway tracks.

847
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,810
I don't care what the world says,
I refuse to believe this, brother.

848
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,020
Father can't do something like this.
The news is false, I tell you!

849
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:54,210
- Absolutely false!
- I pray that it is so, Gita.

850
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,600
- Are you cashier Radhe Mohan's...
- Yes, I'm his daughter.

851
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,520
And I'm his son, lnspector.
Tell me, what's it you want?

852
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,160
- We've come to search your house.
- Search?

853
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,050
You know this concerns
a theft of Rs.95,000...

854
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,370
- and murder.
- Brother!

855
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,350
They have to fulfil
their duty, Gita.

856
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:34,320
Alright, lnspector.
Please search our home.

857
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,780
What's going on, brother?

858
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,950
We've lost our father...

859
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,270
our honor has bitten the dust...

860
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:49,510
and today... today,
the police have come home.

861
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:54,120
Gita, my sister,
don't cry, my dear.

862
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,390
Perhaps God is testing us.

863
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,790
The good times didn't last...

864
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:04,470
neither will the bad times.

865
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,700
- Neither will the bad.
- Excuse me...

866
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:14,740
The search didn't turn up anything, but
if need be, we may trouble you again.

867
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,780
- Is the master home?
- Yes. - Let him in.

868
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:16,180
- Namaste, sir.
- I live in a decent locality, Mr. Lawyer.

869
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,980
And you came here so openly? Didn't
you think people might be watching?

870
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,386
I... I don't quite understand
your meaning.

871
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,440
I mean, please
leave here at once.

872
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:29,930
Since they saw you come in,
they should see you leave as well.

873
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,360
I'll explain the rest to them.

874
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,460
- I came to fix the wedding date...
- Your father fixed that well, didn't he?

875
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
The entire neighborhood
came to congratulate us.

876
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,670
- So... are you reneging on your promise?
- I gave my word to a gentleman.

877
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,750
Not to a thief or murderer!

878
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:50,220
- For God's sake, sir...
- For god's sake, I can donate to an orphanage.

879
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,460
I can get a temple's
broken walls repaired.

880
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,580
But I cannot tolerate within my home,
even the shadow of such a girl...

881
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,770
who brings with her
a disgraced family honor.

882
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,280
Don't say that, sir...

883
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,530
For respectable people,
engagements are not child's play...

884
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,870
that you can fix
and break at will.

885
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,600
You have a young,
unmarried daughter too.

886
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,270
This is my house,
not a court of law, Mr. Lawyer.

887
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,990
If you want to argue, do it
outside. Please leave.

888
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,380
- I beg of you...
- No, I beg you...

889
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,550
for God's sake, go away.

890
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:26,520
- But what will I tell Gita?
- Think of a reason on your way.

891
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,570
You are a lawyer.
You'll surely think of something.

892
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,380
Please go. Ramu!

893
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,570
I'd have refused
if they had agreed.

894
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,590
As if I would go away
leaving my brother alone.

895
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,490
First, bring your bride home.

896
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:10,710
Then she can hold one of my hands
while you hold the other.

897
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,960
And you can both push me out
of the house. Then I'll leave.

898
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:18,360
Gita, what are you saying?

899
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,960
My darling sister,
I live only for you.

900
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,510
Have you heard the cashier's story?
You said he was second only to God.

901
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,430
Time is all-powerful, my dear.

902
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:38,590
Discuss the matter with Loku
and fix a date for the engagement.

903
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,560
But Loku has to agree too.
He's not a nobody...

904
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:44,060
to marry a girl who has
disgraced herself.

905
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,440
Has he even come here since
the news was published?

906
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,880
Why don't you go to his house?
He will never refuse you.

907
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,970
Their love story is
the talk of the town.

908
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:57,130
If you'd only listened to me earlier,
Loku would've been indebted to me.

909
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,890
Now I'll be obliged to him.

910
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:02,546
What can I do other than place
our family honor at his feet?

911
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,070
So I'll do that too.

912
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:20,390
The doctor said to inform him
immediately if the fever rises.

913
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,730
I'll soon be back, Gita.
Don't get up.

914
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,800
Just a minute...

915
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,340
Here...

916
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,770
and pray to God...

917
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,900
that my sister's grief passes.

918
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,220
You didn't even light the lamp
at the holy basil.

919
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,570
It's the sole reminder
of our mother...

920
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:12,490
and father's command...

921
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
She's burning with fever.

922
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,150
Father...

923
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:56,180
you joined mother.

924
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,550
You left us both behind.

925
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:06,330
Hold my hand..

926
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,120
Hold my hand, father...

927
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,510
I want to come to you.

928
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,850
No, my dear.

929
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:26,220
This is that hell where a man
cannot acknowledge his own.

930
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:30,820
He can see everything
but cannot do a thing.

931
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:39,270
Dear God, how much more
will you test me?

932
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,360
Brother...

933
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,770
Brother...

934
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:12,320
Shameless dog! Stealing from
the home which gave you food!

935
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,240
Have you no shame?

936
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:18,660
I gave you a place to sit and
you're stealing from my home!

937
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,010
Wretch!

938
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,630
Cheat!

939
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,960
I pity your age, or I'd
hand you over to the cops.

940
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,730
Get lost from here.
Don't let me see you again.

941
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,600
Never be seen here again
or I'll have you imprisoned!

942
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:54,500
Did you see that? Stifle your
feelings, and go away from here.

943
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:57,910
Or your son will
send you to jail!

944
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:05,910
No, no...
He can't be blamed.

945
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,900
I am the culprit.

946
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,360
I tried to hide the truth.

947
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,380
I feared death.

948
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:22,980
I forgot the power of time,
society and coincidence.

949
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,490
But now I'll tell the world
I am innocent!

950
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,290
Guiltless!

951
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,750
I did nothing wrong.

952
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,940
What can they do to me?

953
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,000
They can only
hang me. Right?

954
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:39,050
Let them send me to the gallows...
strangle me.

955
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:44,160
I am already dead.
A corpse.

956
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,490
A walking corpse.

957
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:49,690
Please be seated, Panditji.

958
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:52,910
Listen carefully, aunty...

959
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:56,340
I will only accept the proposal
when you agree to my conditions.

960
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:01,090
- Don't argue with your elders.
- I'm not being argumentative, aunty...

961
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:07,660
It's a matter of principles. I hate dowry
as much as the Japanese hate atom bombs.

962
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,190
Bravo! Those who don't even
have fire crackers...

963
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:14,130
should definitely hate
atom bombs.

964
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:17,210
If I had my way,
I'd stamp out this practice.

965
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:21,240
Don't think them false, Rai Bahadur, sir.
My principles aren't only for display.

966
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,230
Of course, one to display
and one to live by.

967
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:29,520
But where are we offering dowry?
Can't we give our daughter gifts?

968
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,100
God has been kind to me, aunty.

969
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,870
What will you give her
as a gift, after all?

970
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,350
- Rs.50,000 or Rs.100,000?
- We've ordered a car worth Rs.30,000.

971
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,610
A diamond set worth Rs.80,000
is getting ready.

972
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,950
That's all? Must I break
my principles for this?

973
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,960
He's not making you
his son-in-law, is he?

974
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:51,120
He's making you his son.
All that's his is yours.

975
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:55,596
Bravo! This is what outdoing
one another looks like!

976
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,130
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

977
01:28:57,330 --> 01:29:00,690
Aunt and nephew are
clashing over principles.

978
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:05,140
- Now answer your aunt.
- What can I say? I'm in a quandry.

979
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,570
I know that breaking
your principles is a bad thing.

980
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,510
But disobeying your elders
is also a sin.

981
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:14,490
Panditji, you may begin
to earn your pay.

982
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,910
Why delay an auspicious moment?

983
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,550
May the eternal mother always
look upon us with favor

984
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:27,210
And protect us, along with
Lord Ganesha

985
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:29,220
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

986
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,720
- Give it, my dear.
- Namaste.

987
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,520
- Namaste. - Bravo!
- Namaste. - Bless you, my son.

988
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,420
- You do have a horoscope, don't you?
- Why?

989
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:48,120
I'll have to match your horoscope
with the girl's, young man.

990
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,690
Lest they clash.

991
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,810
- And if they do?
- Nothing.

992
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,510
- Before the wedding, the groom will...
- What did you say?

993
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,700
What I mean is there will be
obstacles to the marriage.

994
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,780
Something or the other
crops up unexpectedly.

995
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,680
Oh, yes, of course.
Come to my bungalow...

996
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,850
You can match horoscopes
and everything else over there.

997
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,760
Where is your bungalow located?

998
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,860
Opposite the Northern India Bank.

999
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,490
You can't miss it. Shanti Kutir.
(Peace Haven)

1000
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,210
My dear...

1001
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,820
This photo has been cut out
of your life, my dear.

1002
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,920
If your mother sees it,
she'll get angry.

1003
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:04,770
Father!

1004
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,420
You can't challenge the Fates.

1005
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,540
Perhaps the Gods weren't pleased
with our happiness.

1006
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,820
Hey, where are you going?

1007
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:40,830
Old man, you have
lived your life.

1008
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:43,220
Why are you bent on
getting me into trouble?

1009
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:45,920
If you want to die so badly,
drown yourself in River Yamuna.

1010
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,750
The elders say that women
are the root of all problems.

1011
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:10,420
That's why I offer flowers with due
deference at Dhiru's advice.

1012
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:15,220
So the money you
are to get as dowry...

1013
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,320
has to be properly documented.

1014
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:21,150
- It will be done.
- Not 'it will be done'...

1015
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,710
It has to be done right away.
Dhiru, go freshen up.

1016
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,700
We'll finish it all
right now. Come on.

1017
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:33,800
Mr. Dhiru, doubts arose
in your mind...

1018
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:38,810
and you boarded a flight
from Bombay to come here.

1019
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,000
- Isn't that so?
- It's absolutely true.

1020
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,880
- I absolutely had doubts.
- Hmm...

1021
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:48,610
Therefore, we have decided...

1022
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,760
that you will be in charge
of distributing the money.

1023
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:58,140
- What do you say, Mr. Loku?
- Yes, of course; here's Rs.95,000...

1024
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,920
divide it into three parts.

1025
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:25,160
Mathur!

1026
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,600
Who's it?

1027
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,290
- Who are you?
- Speak! Who are you?

1028
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,140
Hmm... He came to
steal the watch!

1029
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,446
Thief! Crook!

1030
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:44,980
No, no, I'm not a thief.
I didn't steal anything.

1031
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:48,540
- This watch... this watch...
- This watch belongs to your father, right?

1032
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:52,430
- Tell us who you are!
- I'll tell you who he is...

1033
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,840
He's a murderer, a killer.
He killed Dhiru!

1034
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,316
Didn't you hear the
sound of the pistol?

1035
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:03,290
No, no, I'm not a murderer.
I'm not a killer. I... I...

1036
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,380
The court will decide that.

1037
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:07,180
Call the police.

1038
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,980
If father were here today...

1039
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,490
how happy he would have been
to see you in these robes.

1040
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:21,230
His affectionate gaze would have
shielded you from all harm...

1041
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,530
and he would have quietly
followed you to court.

1042
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:33,650
And when you cross-examine
the accused at the dock...

1043
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:37,590
he wouldn't take
his eyes off you.

1044
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:41,540
And he would silently bless you.

1045
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:46,860
"Go! May victory be yours!"

1046
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:50,780
Milord, the accused
in the dock...

1047
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,320
is a professional thief.

1048
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:55,880
We've met before.
In my own home.

1049
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,520
The crook wanted to
steal a silver frame.

1050
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,290
I took pity on his advanced age
and let him go.

1051
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,570
Had I handed him
to the cops then...

1052
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:08,130
the young man who fell victim
to his gun, would have been saved.

1053
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,310
If only we could place the trembling heart
of the victim's mother in his breast.

1054
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:17,280
If only the tears of the victim's sister
could drench his shameless eyes!

1055
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,390
So this hard-hearted man could
feel his helplessness.

1056
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:24,250
Milord, he is a sore
on the face of humanity.

1057
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,650
The enemy of the law,
a burden upon this earth.

1058
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,490
A man who feels no pain,
nor sheds no tears.

1059
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,470
Milord, these are men who are
obstacles on the path of our progress.

1060
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,700
Let the real case begin.

1061
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:40,680
My Lord, the first witness...

1062
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:42,940
Mr. Loknath... the house
belongs to him.

1063
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,680
The deceased, Dhirumal Saindas...

1064
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:49,360
was employed by his friend,
the second witness, Mr. Mathur.

1065
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:52,700
He had flown down from Bombay
just that evening.

1066
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:55,680
Both witnesses heard
a gunshot...

1067
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:59,490
and ran to the hall, where they
saw the deceased's body.

1068
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,880
They apprehended
the fleeing culprit...

1069
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:05,070
and informed the local police.

1070
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:09,750
Therefore, under Section 302
of the Indian Penal code...

1071
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:15,190
I hold the accused, Ram Gopal,
responsible for killing Dhirumal Saindas.

1072
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,590
And under Section 105
of the Indian Penal Code...

1073
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:22,750
I also charge him with theft because
the deceased's golden watch...

1074
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,550
was in his hands then.

1075
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:27,390
My Lord, this is the watch...

1076
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,560
that the accused
wanted to steal.

1077
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:55,250
Sorry, milord. I was swept away
by emotion upon seeing this watch.

1078
01:37:56,770 --> 01:38:00,900
My Lord... the murderer,
who's standing in the dock...

1079
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,240
could, by selling this watch,
have smoked opium for four days.

1080
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:08,650
Smoked hashish, or even
drunk himself senseless.

1081
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:13,920
But, milord, this watch is
a symbol of my family's honor.

1082
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,790
It's proof of my deceased
father's integrity.

1083
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,580
This watch was presented
to my late father as a reward.

1084
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:25,800
But he had taken this to Bombay.

1085
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,590
Then how did it get here?

1086
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:33,140
What's its connection
to the deceased?

1087
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,290
Who was he?

1088
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,970
My Lord, I would like to ask for
a remand of 15 days to investigate.

1089
01:38:44,530 --> 01:38:45,730
Remand granted.

1090
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,580
Till the 16th.

1091
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:59,730
Hey, Loku! What happened
at court?

1092
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:03,310
What can happen? The prosecutor
has asked for a remand.

1093
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:07,870
God save us from these legal minds.
They're great at splitting hairs.

1094
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,710
As they sow, so shall they reap.

1095
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:13,090
But our friend, Loknath,
gets strange ideas.

1096
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:16,390
The killer did his job,
the victim died...

1097
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,990
And he's the one worried.
And why?

1098
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,440
Due to the city's fear.

1099
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,780
He's already sent five money orders
of Rs.500 each to the victim's mother.

1100
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:30,300
Bravo! It's due to compassionate
men like him...

1101
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:33,130
that the heavens are
still standing.

1102
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,730
Yet, he still can't
sleep at night.

1103
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,070
He's forever worrying about
the fate of the deceased's family.

1104
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:43,480
I think he should be married off
as quickly as possible.

1105
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:46,160
So he stops worrying
about the world.

1106
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,796
And looks after
his family instead.

1107
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:51,550
So what's the problem?
Let's call the priest at once.

1108
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:53,176
If their horoscopes clash...

1109
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,460
we can conduct a puja.
Isn't that right, dear? Right.

1110
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,040
Congratulations, Mr. Loknath.

1111
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,930
- You're back, brother?
- Gita, I'm going to Bombay today.

1112
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,710
Bombay?

1113
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:22,830
My heartbeats quicken when
I hear that city's name.

1114
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:25,610
Why're you going
to Bombay, brother?

1115
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:27,320
I learned in court...

1116
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:32,500
that the killer had the same watch
the bank gave father.

1117
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,680
- How did that watch get here?
- That's what I intend to find out.

1118
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,800
Who are you?
Whom do you work for?

1119
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:21,430
Panditji, the auspicious
time is passing.

1120
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,850
Are you Mr. Loknath?

1121
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:30,820
Yes, indeed. That's my name.
Please come in, and be seated.

1122
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:33,460
- I need to talk to you for a minute
- In private?

1123
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:37,780
- Yes.
- Excuse me, this is a private matter. May I listen to him?

1124
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,830
- What's the matter, lnspector?
- There's a summons in your name.

1125
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:48,226
- A... a summons in my name?
- Yes, of course.

1126
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:50,050
- Tell us the date.
- I'll come with Mathur.

1127
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:54,450
Of course Mathur will come along.
He's my partner, my brother.

1128
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:56,500
- Mathur?
- Let's go.

1129
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:09,240
Mr. Loknath! Do you
recognize this watch?

1130
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:12,560
Er.. yes. This watch was in
the pocket of the deceased.

1131
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,126
So the deceased brought
it from Bombay?

1132
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:18,580
Sir, I don't know if he brought it
from Bombay or Agra. But he had it.

1133
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,200
Mr. Mathur, can you tell me where
the deceased got this watch?

1134
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,600
No.

1135
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:27,880
- Do you recognize this bag?
- Of course.

1136
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,710
- And you, Mr. Loknath?
- Of course.

1137
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,140
This bag belongs to
my friend, Mr. Mathur.

1138
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:38,110
- Did it contain notes worth Rs.95000?
- Money?

1139
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:40,916
- It didn't have any money...
- Then what did it have?

1140
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:43,140
It... it had shaving implements.

1141
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:47,180
Milord, it had shaving cream,
otion, comb, mirror...

1142
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:49,180
blade... What do you say,
Mr. Mathur?

1143
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:52,580
Mr. Mathur, did you know the
late cashier, Radhe Mohan?

1144
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:55,390
- No..
- Are you the owner of Hotel Aaraam?

1145
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,830
- Yes.
- Did cashier Radhe Mohan stay in room no: 10?

1146
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:02,290
Perhaps. It's a hotel.
People come and go.

1147
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,430
So this bag and the watch
belong to him?

1148
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,010
The bag is mine. I don't know
who the watch belongs to.

1149
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:14,050
- Mr. Loknath? - Yes.
- Why did the late Dhirumal Saindas come here?

1150
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:16,710
Er... er... To wish me
upon my engagement.

1151
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,690
- He could have congratulated you through a 12-anna telegram.
- Milord!

1152
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,760
- This is a personal matter and it's irrelevant to this case.
- Mr. Loknath!

1153
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:26,250
Just answer my questions!

1154
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,930
- Mr. Gold Medallist, say something!
- When the time is right.

1155
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:37,200
My Lord, with the help of the
Bombay police, I've brought the man...

1156
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:41,200
who attempted to kill me there.

1157
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,800
His testimony will,
to a great extent, prove...

1158
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,720
who's the real killer.

1159
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,970
Call Nandlal, alias Nandu.

1160
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:52,970
Nandlal, alias Nandu!

1161
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,890
Nandlal, alias Nandu!

1162
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:18,520
Nandlal, alias Nandu,
with God as your witness...

1163
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:21,290
swear that you will speak
only the truth.

1164
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:25,680
With God as my witness,
I swear...

1165
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:29,690
that I'll speak only the truth.

1166
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,110
Do either of you recognize him?

1167
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:35,040
- No!
- Absolutely not!

1168
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,650
- Do you recognize them?
- I'm no traitor, sir...

1169
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:42,500
to not recognize my masters.

1170
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,880
- Who are your employers?
- Sir...

1171
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:47,140
Mr. Loknath and
Mr. Mathur, both.

1172
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:52,020
Hmm... do you also know the
deceased, Dhirumal Saindas?

1173
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:54,000
Huh? Dhiru?

1174
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,960
Yes, he was my partner.

1175
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,360
Did you attack me in Bombay?

1176
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:05,240
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you attack me?

1177
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,980
Was there any
enimity between us?

1178
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:09,170
I have to face God, sir...

1179
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:13,210
I'm also fed up
of this difficult life.

1180
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,870
But Mr. Mathur is
a very stern man.

1181
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:21,510
It seems, milord, that the prosecutor
has imported an actor from Bombay.

1182
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:24,710
Right! My lord, the murder
took place in Delhi.

1183
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,500
The man was in Bombay then.

1184
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,180
That means that his evidence
is just a waste of the court's time.

1185
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:33,450
My lord! This man has been
working for them for six years.

1186
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,120
He is the late Dhirumal
Saindas's partner.

1187
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:39,430
He attacked me in Bombay
upon their orders.

1188
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:42,920
Dhirumal Saindas's real killer
remains hidden.

1189
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,230
This is absolutely false, my lord.

1190
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:51,370
But my lord, before he begins questioning
this lying, unreliable witness...

1191
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,540
I'd like to bring something
to the court's notice.

1192
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:57,580
The prosecutor will try anything to
let the auspicious moment pass.

1193
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:03,510
Because, my lord, I'm marrying
the girl the prosecutor loves.

1194
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,850
Please continue.

1195
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,220
- Did you see cashier Radhe Mohan?
- Of course, sir.

1196
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:17,710
- When Roma brought him in.
- Why did you notice him particularly?

1197
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:20,220
When the cashier left Delhi...

1198
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:22,326
there was a telephone call
from Mr. Loknath.

1199
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:24,740
That's utter nonsense, your honor,
absolute nonsense.

1200
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,150
I answered the call, sir.

1201
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:32,730
Mr Loknath said,
"Tell Mr. Mathur...

1202
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:35,880
'The goods have left
by the Frontier Mail.'"

1203
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:39,320
I thought they might
be crates of liquor...

1204
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:42,670
that he frequently sends
from Delhi.

1205
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:45,590
Lies! Nonsense!
He's rambling.

1206
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,550
Yes, Nandu.
What happened then?

1207
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,860
The nest day, Roma reached the hotel
with a simple old man in tow.

1208
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,790
- Roma, who?
- She was a crook, sir.

1209
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,960
She did all these
important tasks.

1210
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:05,290
- Do you recognize this bag?
- Very well, sir.

1211
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:07,290
It was in the cashier's hand.

1212
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:11,296
God bless my Loku!
His reach is so influential.

1213
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,830
- Of course! What reach!
- Please ask when he'll be back.

1214
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:19,030
Hello? May I ask
when he'll be back?

1215
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,910
I heard he's been
arrested for murder.

1216
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,200
The magistrate has begun
to suspect him.

1217
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:27,040
- Excellent!
- What did he say?

1218
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:31,490
- He says the magistrate is coming.
- This relationship will increase our prestige!

1219
01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:33,830
He's your nephew, after all.

1220
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,870
Whenever he comes, he has
something important to say.

1221
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:41,930
- But where are you going?
- To ensure he's not waiting for the collector.

1222
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,140
- I'll get the wedding procession energized.
- Okay.

1223
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:02,540
Bangles...

1224
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,080
Father...

1225
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:11,870
And due to this, sirs, the
next morning's newpapers...

1226
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:14,910
carried the news that the cashier
had stolen Rs.95,000.

1227
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:23,070
And my lord, this infamy ended
my sister's engagement.

1228
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:28,460
And my relation with Usha... They got
her engaged to witness no: 1.

1229
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:30,120
And the cashier, milord...

1230
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:34,240
who was sent on this job
due to his integrity...

1231
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:37,290
was branded a knave.

1232
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:40,070
Initially, there were five
claimants to the cash...

1233
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:43,210
Mr. Loku, Mr. Mathur,
Dhiru, Jaggu and Roma.

1234
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,960
Now there are only three left.

1235
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:49,050
The day Dhiru boarded
the plane for Delhi..

1236
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:53,890
I tried stopping him but he was
consumed by the thought of Rs.32,000.

1237
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:58,110
Finally, like Roma and
Jaggu, he too was killed.

1238
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:02,450
- How did Jaggu die?
- In a train accident.

1239
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:08,190
The body found on the tracks was
not the cashier's. It was Jaggu's.

1240
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,630
He was wearing the
cashier's coat.

1241
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,920
Nandu! Does that mean
the cashier is alive?

1242
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:18,420
Did you...

1243
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:22,720
did you ever see him again?
Where is he??

1244
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:26,710
- Where is he, Nandu?
- I'll tell you where the cashier is.

1245
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,670
With dishonor staining
his forehead...

1246
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,840
and infamy, a millstone
around his neck...

1247
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:48,110
hiding from every gaze...

1248
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,690
he prayed to God
for deliverance.

1249
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:55,760
But, suddenly...

1250
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,970
he heard the newspaper vendors

1251
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,710
He was reassured to hear...

1252
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:06,190
he was crushed
to death by a train.

1253
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:10,300
He was dead.
Time passed by...

1254
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:16,300
The world had forgotten him and
he had consigned the world to oblivion.

1255
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:20,730
But paternal love is
is a bad influence, my lord.

1256
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,690
The love for his children
made him so restless...

1257
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:32,480
- he returned home.
- Accused Ram Gopal...

1258
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:36,050
- How do you know all this?
- Slowly...

1259
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:41,750
- all will be revealed, Mr. Prosecutor.
- Speak, prisoner at bar.

1260
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:43,800
- What happened next?
- My lord...

1261
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,500
Stolen loot can never be hidden.

1262
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,030
It will always reveal itself.

1263
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,930
This man standing opposite me...

1264
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:56,480
with the cashier's bag
in his hand...

1265
01:50:57,450 --> 01:51:01,380
got down from a cab and
entered Shanti Kutir.

1266
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:03,350
That bag...

1267
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:06,180
that 95,000 rupees...

1268
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,970
If the cashier could get it...

1269
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:14,630
then the stain on his honor
would be wiped off.

1270
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:19,030
My lord, the late Dhirumal
entered that very bungalow.

1271
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:20,850
That watch in his pocket...

1272
01:51:21,650 --> 01:51:23,790
was the same one that
the bank had given the cashier.

1273
01:51:25,070 --> 01:51:27,140
The watch, the bag...

1274
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:31,570
the money... these three could
turn the tables for him.

1275
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,490
It could give him back his life.

1276
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,760
Taking advantage
of the darkness...

1277
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:37,880
he entered the bungalow too.

1278
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:42,910
He couldn't find the bag anyhere but
Dhirumal's coat was hanging before him.

1279
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,900
It had the watch.

1280
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:49,340
As soon as he took the watch,
he heard a gunshot from the hall.

1281
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,430
He was terrified...

1282
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,410
and tried to flee. But...

1283
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:57,800
these men framed him for murder
and handed him to the police.

1284
01:51:58,810 --> 01:51:59,920
Father...

1285
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:02,200
So you are Radhe Mohan,
the cashier?

1286
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,750
Yes, my lord.

1287
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:12,026
I am that unfortunate man who,
overcome by affection...

1288
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:13,460
went home that night.

1289
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,080
I was thrown out like a thief.

1290
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:19,230
Brought before my own son...

1291
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:21,780
as a suspected murderer.

1292
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:25,550
But why did you
give a false name?

1293
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,440
Because...

1294
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:36,040
I had no proof.

1295
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:38,480
The world had forgotten me.

1296
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:42,660
I didn't want to defame
my children again.

1297
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:45,940
I acquit the cashier with honor.

1298
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,520
And witnesses 1 and 2...

1299
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:53,810
I hold you responsible for the murder
of the deceased, Dhirumal Saindas...

1300
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,140
under section 302 of
the Indian Penal Code.

1301
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:59,140
And order your arrest.

1302
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:03,740
Who left these bangles in my box?
Father is definitely alive!

1303
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,330
I saw him in a dream.

1304
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,790
- Gita!
- Father!

1305
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:13,560
- Father!
- Congratulations, sir, congratulations!

1306
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,040
Congratulations, Harish.

1307
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,410
Mr. Cashier, crime can never be hidden.

1308
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:20,850
In much the same way,
truth can never remain hidden.

1309
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:25,060
Gita, my dear, I congratulate you too,
upon finding your father.

1310
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,530
And I'll congratulate you again in the
evening when you get a sister-in-law.

1311
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:31,290
- Sister-in-law?
