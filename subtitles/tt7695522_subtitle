1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,042


3
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:09,500
Who is Ms. Tulasi here?

4
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,458
The doctor's calling you in.

5
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,875
Mr. Krishna!

6
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:26,875
Are you Mr. Krishna?

7
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,708
How old are you?

8
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,750
19 years old.

9
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Is this the age to be doing this?

10
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,083
Give me your dad's phone number.
-What happened, doctor?

11
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,208
She is pregnant.

12
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,000
What have you done!

13
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,375
You have brought shame to the family.

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,750
We trusted you
and you end up doing this?

15
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,500
Is it for this
my brother is financing your education?

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,917
If your mom comes to know,
she will kill you!

17
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:07,708
Don't you know better
than to stay away from such lowly people?

18
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:08,917
Who is lowly?

19
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,958
You didn't bring up your daughter well.

20
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,250
Trying to blame my son!

21
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,417
Did you hear what he said?

22
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:19,000
Listen up! Mind your words!
-What do you mean "mind your words"?

23
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,208
We sent her here to get an education
and look what you have done!

24
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,708
Had it been our town, that's it!

25
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:24,833
What can you do?

26
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,417
Was it only my son's fault?
-Yes, it was his fault!

27
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:31,458
Keep your fights at home.
This is a hospital.

28
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,708
'Who was it?'

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,458
'Who sowed you?'

30
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,292
'Who was it?'

31
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,958
'Who destroyed you?'

32
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,875
'Who was it?'

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,667
'Who wrote your fate?'

34
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,417
'Who was it?'

35
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,250
'Who erased you?'

36
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,000
'O fireling!'

37
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,833
'Who extinguished you?'

38
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,500
'O flower!'

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,375
'Who squashed you?'

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,083
'Who killed you
before you even came to be?'

41
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,375
'O unborn child!'

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,708
'Endless sorrow...'

43
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,500
'...is the cycle of birth.'

44
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,333
'O my love...'

45
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,375
'Is that why you scattered away?'

46
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:20,958
'This doomed world
is but a simmering hell.'

47
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,833
'O my beauty...'

48
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,667
'Is that why you melted away?'

49
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:30,375
'You withered away
in the fire of your mother's womb.'

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,250
'O dear child!'

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,042
Five years later.

52
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,833
Please come in.

53
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,083
This is the first wedding in your family.
Why such a simple affair?

54
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,917
What's the point of a lavish wedding?

55
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,958
We bought them a house with the money.

56
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
It is getting ready.

57
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,542
Are you all going to move in there?
-No, sir!

58
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,542
It's for the young ones!

59
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,542
Will you invite us for the house warming?

60
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,833
There is a minor litigation issue.
Case is in court.

61
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm waiting for them
to hand over the house.

62
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,292
Please come in first.
Posing a lot of questions!

63
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,292
Aunty, pillows?
-Inside.

64
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,583
No one is around!

65
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,875
I had been looking for you.
-What are you doing?

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,125
Hey Krishna!

67
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,750
Grandma!

68
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,625
Always in a hurry!

69
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:52,333
One doesn't get to see you otherwise!
-See me?

70
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,458
He's blushing!

71
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:05,042
Haven't slept yet?
-Yeah, right! I will.

72
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,958
He's yapping
not knowing my situation.

73
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,042
Mom!
-What is it, son?

74
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,833
There are so many people around.

75
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,333
It was your dad's idea to make everyone
stay at home instead of a hotel.

76
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,417
What about me?

77
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,167
Go upstairs and sleep.

78
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,417
First night?

79
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,542
Is this your 'first night'?

80
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,333
She looked gorgeous in this saree.
-Yeah, she looked great.

81
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Son!

82
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,917
Come and sleep in here.

83
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,167
Come on in, son!

84
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,167
With you?
-Yeah!

85
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,167
Yes, dear boy!
Come on in!

86
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,417
You did a great job!

87
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,625
What's the hurry?
Stay a couple more days!

88
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,250
Two more days?

89
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,375
Uncle, you could stay a little longer.

90
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,625
I'm going to Singapore tomorrow.

91
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,458
One has to manage the business.

92
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm sure you know.

93
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,583
We will be back.

94
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,792
It's getting late.
Let's go!

95
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:25,708
Come on, uncle! It's getting late.
-Why are you in a hurry?

96
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,042
Mom.
Take care.

97
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,500
So many people!
When will they ever leave?

98
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,667
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

99
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,500
Your father invites us
only once in a blue moon.

100
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to spend four days
sightseeing Chennai.

101
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,917
Come here, Krishna!

102
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,542
This is for you!
-What is it, dad?

103
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,083
Flight tickets for you and Tulasi.
It has all the bookings for your honeymoon.

104
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,500
Enjoy these four days!

105
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,125
Only four days?

106
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,083
Four days!

107
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,542
Shimla.

108
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,583
What happened to you?
-What happened?

109
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,458
You aren't happy!
-Who said that?

110
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,792
No one has to say it.

111
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,250
It is quite obvious.

112
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,042
You look like you have been forced
into this marriage.

113
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,250
Nothing of that sort.

114
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:24,042
Five years!
I was not supposed to see or talk to you.

115
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,208
So many conditions!

116
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,417
I have been waiting for this day.

117
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:36,167
You look so sullen
as if it is an arranged marriage.

118
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,333
You may have forgotten everything.

119
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,208
But I can't.

120
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,333
I can't forget anything.

121
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,458
We should have had a child by now.

122
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,917
She should have been five years old.

123
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,083
Pandian, aren't we going home?

124
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,333
Your dad asked me to take you
to the new flat.

125
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,875
Krishna, have you landed?

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,125
Yes, dad.

127
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,708
I have some good news.
-What is it, dad?

128
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,208
We have won the case
involving our flat.

129
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,833
They have handed over the keys.

130
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,208
Really?
That's very good.

131
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,208
You and Tulasi can move in
to the new house.

132
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,833
We have arranged for all the things
you both would need.

133
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,958
What about you?
-Mom and I will come over this weekend.

134
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,708
Come in.

135
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,792
Be careful.

136
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,000
They have set up everything.
It looks great.

137
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,500
Isn't this awesome?

138
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,625
It was dad!

139
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,083
He has saved up money little by little
to build this house for us.

140
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,000
I was upset that he made our wedding
a very simple affair.

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
But it was all for our good.
Right?

142
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,000
Wow!
What a view!

143
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,333
Who are you angry with?
Me or my dad?

144
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,083
It wasn't my decision!
You know that!

145
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,958
I felt so bad that day.

146
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,292
It was really hard for me.

147
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,583
But, thinking about the past
isn't going to help.

148
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,542
Tulasi, I want you to be happy.

149
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,333
I'm ready to do anything for that.

150
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:03,250
God will bless us with not one
but two children like Diya.

151
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,208
Life will get busy.
We won't even have time to talk.

152
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,000
This is our time now.

153
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm not ready to waste it.

154
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,167
They want us to be happy.

155
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,542
We got to be happy here.
So cheer up!

156
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:36,708
This is our dream house.
Diya will be born here soon.

157
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,417
She is going to be running and playing
around the house.

158
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:01,875
'A soothing lullaby...'

159
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,417
'She seeks that thing
you forgot to sing.'

160
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,708
'The one you didn't cuddle and coddle
as the apple of your eye...'

161
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:15,042
'She is still a precious part of you.'

162
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,417
'A soothing lullaby...'

163
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:23,708
'She seeks that thing
you forgot to sing.'

164
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,292
'Even without saying a word...'

165
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:32,625
'...she calls you 'mom' every moment.'

166
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,292
'That gentle smile you cast away...'

167
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:33,708
'...follows you wherever you go.'

168
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,958
'Bearing a question upon her heart...'

169
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,375
'...she looks up to you for the answer!'

170
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,292
'To speak her love for you...'

171
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:51,208
'...she needs not a life.'

172
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:55,500
'Just waiting, just gazing...'

173
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,875
'...she proclaims her love!'

174
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
'To catch your eye...'

175
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,167
'To touch your hand...'

176
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,417
'To shower you with kisses...'

177
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,625
'...she yearns away!'

178
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,750
'But, there is no way.'

179
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,917
'There are no words.'

180
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:17,292
'Is the forgotten pain, a thorn now?'

181
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:21,833
'Is silence, a word now?'

182
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,375
My boy...

183
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,208
Go and tell your father.

184
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,875
Tell him Moorthy is out on bail.

185
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,292
Tell him
his life will no longer be peaceful.

186
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,292
He's the builder of this place.

187
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,250
I paid him the money he wanted.

188
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,792
He said the land value has risen
and he had spent a lot.

189
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,500
He demanded another 25 lakhs
for the registration.

190
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,625
I tried working it out, to no avail.

191
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,792
So I filed a complaint with the police
and sued him.

192
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,542
Let it go.
Don't worry about this.

193
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll tell the Assistant Commissioner
about this. He'll handle it.

194
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,417
Why go through this again?
Just pay him what he wants.

195
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,542
And then what?

196
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,417
If everyone were to fear him like this
and pay him what he wants...

197
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,583
...he'll keep cheating them
and get rich.

198
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll take care of it.

199
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,125
Why deal with this again?
-It's okay...

200
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,250
Hello, uncle!

201
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,500
Hello! Come on in!

202
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,625
When did you come?

203
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,042
All done at the hospital?

204
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,250
Did aunty not come?
-She doesn't know I'm here.

205
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,917
We were just chatting.

206
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,667
Did you give him coffee?

207
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,208
We were just talking...
-I'll be back.

208
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,792
There's no need for that.

209
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,917
I'll come for lunch on Sunday
with aunty. See you both then.

210
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,417
How come there's no water?

211
00:23:58,292 --> 00:23:59,375
What is this?

212
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,667
Motor's been running all this while.
Still, not even a drop of water!

213
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,625
Who's there?

214
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,750
Who pushed me in here?

215
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,667
Help!

216
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,375
Mom!

217
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,333
Dad!

218
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,083
My husband!
Oh God!

219
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,208
My husband!

220
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:40,167
Krishna, there's a call from Sathish.

221
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:41,333
Ask him what's up.

222
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,000
Hello?
What is it, Sathish?

223
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,792
Drink some of this, mom.
-Please drink, aunty.

224
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,250
Tulasi, your mother's here.

225
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,625
Mom...

226
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,833
What happened, Tulasi?

227
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,000
How did this happen?

228
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,125
What is all this?

229
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,167
He went to see my brother Krishna
last night.

230
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,750
I don't know when he came back home
and went to sleep.

231
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,708
He seemed perfectly normal.

232
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,000
I can't believe any of this.

233
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,958
This case has three possibilities.

234
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,875
Suicide. Accident. Murder.

235
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,833
Chances of suicide are very low.

236
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:04,333
Why would anyone want to kill themselves
in such a painful way?

237
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,667
'Trigger Star' fights back!

238
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,958
They'd choose simpler methods.

239
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,542
Going by the autopsy report,
this is no accident.

240
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,292
It is murder.

241
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,708
What was that?

242
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,000
Murder, sir.

243
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,458
The serial kisser's busted!

244
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,125
Get out of here.

245
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,000
Before leaving,
order some raisins for me.

246
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:31,750
'Shall I torment you for a while,
Julie?'

247
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,083
With regards to this case,
there are three possibilities.

248
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,583
Suicide. Accident. Murder.

249
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,375
Would anyone attempt suicide
by suffocating inside a water tank?

250
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,417
He talks
as if he investigated this case himself!

251
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,583
Why be a cop
if you're scared of death?

252
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,333
As long as the work happens,
let it go.

253
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,375
This is definitely not suicide!

254
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,833
An accident in a water tank?
Sounds funny!

255
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,458
More than the autopsy report...

256
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,875
...Ragavan's instinct
says it's a murder!

257
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,083
Did you come here
just to say that?

258
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,583
So begin the enquiry right away.
Why waste time yapping over here?

259
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,292
I'll kick it off on an auspicious day!

260
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,125
Stay on process, Ragavan!

261
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,417
These guys come in using recommendation
and screw all of us over!

262
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:26,542
He needs to be put in an encounter team
and be killed by some thug!

263
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:32,917
Per the post mortem report,
your father died by suffocation.

264
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,208
Why would he go to the roof at that time?
-Is lunch ready?

265
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,333
We don't know that.

266
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,708
We suspect this maybe a murder.

267
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,125
Didn't you confirm to me
that this was murder?

268
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,292
And now you say you 'suspect' that it is?

269
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,292
Just cause I'm young,
think you can fool me?

270
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,375
This is definitely a cold blooded murder.

271
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,458
The perpetrators maybe mercenaries,
Maoists, or even Naxalites!

272
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,333
Or hell, they may even be terrorists!

273
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,917
But Ragavan is ready for any...

274
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,417
Can you think of any enemies
that your father or your family may have?

275
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,375
No, sir.

276
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,375
Nobody like that...

277
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,083
Are you kidding?

278
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:33,250
Going by the word of some kid,
you came to interrogate me?

279
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,875
So you didn't do it?
-I have nothing to do with this!

280
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,625
He's not the guy. Why bother a gentleman?
Let's go!

281
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,542
They always say that.
As cops, we need to probe further.

282
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,375
I'm aware of that. Alright?
-Yes, sir.

283
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,208
But my instinct asks
why wouldn't you have done it?

284
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,792
If I wanted to kill him for what he did,
I'd have done it a long time ago!

285
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:59,542
Why would I drown him in a water tank?

286
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:04,000
You killed my father
and pretend like you know nothing of it?

287
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:07,875
Your father must have had a dozen enemies
like me. Go and ask them!

288
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,833
I won't spare you!
-Let go of my shirt!

289
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,292
Break it up!

290
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,625
Don't you have any sense?
You brought me to a battle zone!

291
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,500
You're all suspended!
I'm out of here!

292
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,250
Ragavan!
Don't stay on process!

293
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,417
My mother's very upset.

294
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:47,875
I'm sending her and Sathish to America
for six months, to get over this.

295
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,125
Take your mother back to our house.

296
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,292
I'll stay with my mother tonight...

297
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,583
...finish work at the construction site
and will come home tomorrow.

298
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,208
What is this?

299
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,333
Is the door stuck?

300
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,875
My God!
It's not opening!

301
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,250
Please come here, Tulasi!
The door isn't opening!

302
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,375
It is jammed!

303
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
What is this?

304
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
What happened, mom?
-I don't know. The door was jammed.

305
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
It scared me!

306
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,333
Where is Krishna?
I'll bid him goodbye and return home.

307
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,250
You can tell him by phone.

308
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,417
No, dear.
He looked so devastated that day.

309
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,792
I'd like to console him
and then head over to the train station.

310
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,458
Alright. I'll book a cab.
You can tell him on the way.

311
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,792
Mom...
-Hold on a minute, driver!

312
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,958
What happened?
-Emergency case at the hospital.

313
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,583
Can I ride with you?
-Sure.

314
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,583
Krishna will drop you off at the station.

315
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,708
What is this, driver?
The door isn't opening.

316
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,542
I don't know, ma'am.
Let me check.

317
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,667
Come on in.
-The child lock is on!

318
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,875
I don't know how that happened, ma'am.
Sorry.

319
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,250
We're here, mom.

320
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,375
Shall I tell Krishna that you're here?

321
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,083
It's alright, dear. I'll take care of it.
You get going. Alright?

322
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,458
I'll take that.
-Bye.

323
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,750
Is flooring over in that block?
-Up to twenty floors, sir.

324
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,333
Good! Send it to the ground floor!

325
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,458
I said ground floor!
Why are you coming up?

326
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,958
I didn't do it.
It's going automatically!

327
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,208
Stop that thing!

328
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:33,542
I'm trying!

329
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,583
Why are you sending it up
when I told you to send it down?

330
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,083
It hasn't been fixed yet, sir!

331
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,833
What are you doing?
Stop the lift!

332
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,958
I can't make sense of this!

333
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,125
It won't stop!
-Turn off the power right now!

334
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,083
I've turned it off!

335
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,000
What happened?
-I don't know, sir.

336
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,000
How is it still going up?

337
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,333
It stopped on its own!
-I don't understand, sir!

338
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,292
Is anybody there?

339
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,750
The lift door won't open!

340
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,625
Somebody please open the door!

341
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,958
The lift's falling down, sir!

342
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What happened?

343
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,792
Move aside! What happened?
-Move!

344
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,250
Some repair work you've done!
-It was being checked. Can't explain this.

345
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,417
Have an industrial crane clear this tonight
and get a new lift ready!

346
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,875
Tulasi, coffee please.

347
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,417
Where's your mother?
-She left.

348
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,167
She came to the site to meet you.

349
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,583
What? She came to the site?
When?

350
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,042
I was the one who dropped her.

351
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,833
No. I didn't see her.

352
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,542
She came to inform you...

353
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,208
Yeah, tell me.

354
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,458
Clear everything.

355
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,000
Mom!
-Ma'am!

356
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,625
Sir, we didn't know that she was inside.

357
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,208
If we did, we could have saved her.

358
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,333
We don't know how she got into the lift
that was being installed.

359
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,833
What happened, uncle?

360
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,042
Call the ambulance!

361
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,250
I know what you're thinking, son.

362
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:18,292
There is no link between me
and what is happening in your family.

363
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:20,792
It is true that I was angry at your dad.

364
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:24,042
But, I am not that bad a person
to destroy your family.

365
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,750
What to do?
These are bad times.

366
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:31,667
If you or your family needs any help...

367
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:33,625
...don't hesitate to ask me.

368
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,375
I just came over to tell you this.

369
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,667
How many days
will you brood over this?

370
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,417
If I had dropped mom,
this wouldn't have happened, right?

371
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,458
Don't stress yourself unnecessarily.

372
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,625
If it is destiny's play,
no one can change it.

373
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:31,417
You should become normal.
You should go to back to the hospital.

374
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,125
If your was mom was alive,
she would have wished the same.

375
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,542
I want to see my uncle.

376
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,167
We will shift him to the normal ward
in another two days.

377
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,167
But it would be better
if no one disturbs him.

378
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,000
We'll take care of it.

379
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,792
I've already talked to the doctor.

380
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,375
Tulasi!

381
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,375
I heard about it only yesterday.

382
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,375
Two people passed away in a week.

383
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:16,542
I am sorry.

384
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,833
Uncle will be fine.

385
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,792
If you need anything,
do call me.

386
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,500
Take care.
Bye.

387
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:50,625
Did you get the call, sir?
-Yes, I received the call.

388
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,417
Who called?
-Don't know, but they called from the spot.

389
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:57,750
At what time?
-Around 4 to 5 am in the morning.

390
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,375
How come you are here?

391
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,167
She is our family doctor.

392
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,167
We have known her for years.
We met her yesterday in the hospital.

393
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,292
We were shocked when we heard this news.

394
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,458
There is some link between you
and the three deaths.

395
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:30,917
What are you saying, sir?

396
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:34,875
Will anyone kill their own mother
and father-in-law?

397
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,875
True! Will anyone do that?
-No, sir.

398
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,875
What you say sounds right.
It is logical.

399
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,792
Tulasi was the last person
that all three of them saw.

400
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:49,042
Not only that, all the three have died
in the same manner.

401
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,500
Out of suffocation.

402
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,167
That is a strong coincidence.

403
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,167
I know that.

404
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,375
But Ragavan's intuition says,
all these are murders.

405
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,750
All these are accidents.
Don't talk like a child.

406
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,583
Who is talking like a child?
The murderer or me?

407
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,792
Don't get it? In the doctor's car,
all the doors had the child lock on!

408
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:13,875
But there was no child in that car.
Why? How?

409
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,583
Was it you who found it?
It was I who found it!

410
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,042
It came in a flow.
Was it right?

411
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,583
Brilliant, sir.

412
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,042
You don't have answers
for any of my questions, right?

413
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,625
But I will find the murderer.

414
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,500
I'll bring him before the law
and get him a death sentence!

415
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,083
No matter what a big shot he is!

416
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,125
Let's see who wins.
That guy or this Ragavan!

417
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,333
Uncle! How are you?
-I'm good, dear.

418
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,208
How's your health?
-It's fine.

419
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,333
Are you fine?
-When were you discharged?

420
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,125
Just now.
-You could have informed us.

421
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,083
That's not a problem.

422
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:04,000
I am leaving to the site.
You guys carry on.

423
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:13,417
Wonder whose sin it is,
this is devastating our family.

424
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:17,167
You don't worry.

425
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,458
Everything will be alright,
if we perform some rituals.

426
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,542
No, uncle.

427
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,917
Krishna doesn't believe in all this.

428
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:29,750
You are young folks.
You'll never understand this.

429
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,667
All this is beyond our understanding.

430
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,917
If the holy man Balaswamy comes over
and performs rituals...

431
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,875
...all the negative energy will leave us.

432
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,417
It's for our own good.

433
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,000
Wonder whose sin it is,
this is devastating our family.

434
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,917
All the three died in a similar way.
Out of suffocation.

435
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,125
That is a strong coincidence.

436
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,458
In the doctor's car,
all the doors had the child lock on!

437
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,542
But there was no child in that car.
Why?

438
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,708
Driver, the door is not opening?

439
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,333
The child lock is on!
I don't know how it happened, ma'am.

440
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:50,750
Tulasi was the last person
that all three of them saw.

441
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,667
Bye, dear.
-Get going.

442
00:50:58,917 --> 00:50:59,917
She is pregnant.

443
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:01,708
What have you done!

444
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,792
You have brought shame to the family.

445
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:06,333
Listen up! Mind your words!

446
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:29,500
What has happened has happened.
There is no point in us fighting.

447
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,500
Their future is more important.

448
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,625
I have been thinking the same.

449
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,167
Getting them married
is the right thing to do.

450
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:46,042
How is that possible?

451
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,000
She has just written
the medical entrance examination.

452
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,167
We wanted her to become a doctor.
We had a lot of dreams.

453
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,125
How can we do this?

454
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:01,667
Your son has to focus on his career
and settle down.

455
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:03,417
That is what is good for their lives.

456
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:07,042
You are right.

457
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,250
But what can be done now?

458
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:13,292
Don't get stressed.
Let's sort this out now.

459
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:15,125
We will get them married
after 5 years.

460
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,417
By then, they will be done
with their education.

461
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,083
What about the baby in her womb?

462
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,625
Abort it.

463
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:35,750
Yes, let's abort it.
That's the right thing to do.

464
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,333
Doctor, please go ahead
with the formalities.

465
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,125
Mom.

466
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,875
I'm sorry.

467
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,417
I made a mistake.

468
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,125
But let's not do this.
Please.

469
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,625
Keep quiet.

470
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:05,875
We know what's right.

471
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,167
Dad.
-Keep quiet! I'll kill you.

472
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:12,750
Doctor, please tell them.

473
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,708
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

474
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,917
It won't take more than ten minutes.
It's quite common these days.

475
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:20,958
Don't be scared.

476
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:29,833
Uncle, please tell mom not to do this.

477
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,958
Would you be fine with it
if it was your daughter?

478
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:38,375
If my daughter had done the same thing,
I would have killed her.

479
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:50,000
Krishna, this is our child.

480
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,958
Why are you keeping quiet?

481
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,750
Say something!

482
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:56,417
They are only saying it for our good.

483
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,083
They have agreed to get us married.

484
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,167
Why can't we do this for them?

485
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,917
Tulasi!

486
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,000
Relax, Tulasi!
-What happened?

487
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,375
What happened to her?

488
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,417
How can you go on talking like this?

489
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:29,333
She is pregnant and weak.

490
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:31,333
She is no longer a minor.

491
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:34,333
Nobody can force her against her will.

492
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:37,500
Please, just leave her alone.

493
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,250
Just relax.

494
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:55,917
Don't get emotional.
Your health is more important.

495
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:05,083
Nurse, give me the injection.
-Here, doctor!

496
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:13,708
Hypoglycemia.

497
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,417
Abort it.

498
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,750
Yes, let's abort it.

499
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,708
Don't worry.
It won't take more than ten minutes.

500
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:32,833
If my daughter had done the same thing,
I would have killed her.

501
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,333
Hello, Tulasi.

502
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,875
Uncle, where are you?
-Tell me, I can hear you.

503
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:57,792
Uncle!

504
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:29,292
Diya!

505
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:48,167
Diya!

506
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,375
Diya!

507
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:40,917
Mom!

508
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,958
Go ahead, sir.
Did you get any clues?

509
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,375
Is anybody in your family
in the export business?

510
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:53,708
Why do you ask?

511
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:56,250
Around 50-55 years age.
Short and fair?

512
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,625
Yes. Tulasi's uncle.

513
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:03,583
Did he come to meet you
or Tulasi yesterday?

514
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:08,583
Yes. He had been discharged
from the hospital and visited us today.

515
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:10,542
Why do you ask?

516
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,167
What happened?

517
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,250
I'm sorry.
He is no more.

518
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,750
Your uncle...

519
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:35,417
Is he dead?

520
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,583
Why can't we do this for them?

521
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:21,875
Don't go with them.

522
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,042
They're all going.
How can I not go with them?

523
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,042
If we get Tulasi in our custody
and question her for two days...

524
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:45,042
...it will get us closer
to the perpetrator.

525
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:46,167
Are you an idiot?

526
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,583
Anyone who meets that woman
ends up dead!

527
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,125
And you want me to meet her?

528
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,542
I get it.
You're targeting me, right?

529
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:57,000
If I die, you become sub-inspector!
-Stop it, sir!

530
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,042
I asked you to close the case,
not my life! Get lost!

531
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:03,875
It's not that...
-That'll do! Rule it as an accident!

532
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,875
Krishna, we...

533
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
What happened to you?

534
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:57,917
I need to talk to you alone.

535
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,833
You said you wanted to talk.

536
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,708
What do you want to talk about?

537
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,083
What I'm going to tell you
may be shocking.

538
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,083
Hard to believe, too.

539
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,208
But it's the truth.

540
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Diya...

541
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Our baby...

542
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:43,667
...exists.

543
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,708
Mom!

544
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,625
I want to see you.

545
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,708
They saw to it that you never will.

546
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,958
So... you killed all of them?

547
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,208
Yes.

548
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,833
They are evil, mom.

549
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,375
They separated us.

550
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:00,958
We don't need anybody.

551
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,083
The two of us are enough.

552
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,208
Everyone who wanted Diya to be aborted
are dead.

553
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,083
You're the only one left in that list.

554
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,333
Diya won't spare you.

555
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,292
She's going to kill you next.

556
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,500
In order to keep Diya from killing you,
I must always be with you.

557
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:39,125
Please try to understand.

558
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,167
Didn't you sleep?

559
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,667
Why were you up all night?

560
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,208
Don't talk so loudly.

561
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:16,417
Diya might hear you.

562
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:35,417
You don't believe me, do you?

563
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:39,208
There are pills for everything.
We can cure this.

564
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,583
It's not that I don't believe you.
But...

565
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:48,125
For many days, you were upset
over the abortion.

566
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,250
Then there were many deaths
in our family.

567
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,583
This kind of restlessness...

568
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,250
...is quite natural.
I understand.

569
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:58,833
Why can't you believe me?
I'm perfectly fine!

570
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:00,125
Stop it, Diya!

571
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,792
Diya killed Krishna's father,
my mother, and our doctor!

572
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:08,542
Krishna's next on her list.
Please believe me!

573
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,792
As long as Krishna is with me,
Diya won't kill him.

574
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:15,792
He's safe if he's with me. I don't know
how to make him understand that!

575
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,167
At least, you must believe me.

576
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:20,667
I'm telling the truth! Please understand!
-Relax! I believe you!

577
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,500
Take these two pills at night.

578
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,250
You'll sleep well.

579
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:32,167
If you still feel this way next week,
come back here again.

580
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:34,833
We'll try another medicine.

581
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:44,083
I'm neither ill nor insane, Krishna!
I'm telling you the truth!

582
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:48,292
Diya won't spare you, either.
If you're with me, you're safe.

583
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,417
Please understand!

584
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,792
It's alright if you're taking a long break.
When will you be back?

585
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,458
I don't know.

586
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,250
Krishna!

587
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,500
The pot fell
as I was hanging it up...

588
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:24,167
What's up?

589
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:26,667
What happened?

590
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:28,833
Really?

591
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,167
Nobody was hurt, right?

592
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:35,167
Call the foreman!
I'm on my way!

593
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,542
Have the crane clear it up.
I'm coming!

594
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,583
I have urgent work to do...

595
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,875
Where are you going?
I told you not to go without me!

596
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,958
There's a problem at the new site.
A ceiling has fallen!

597
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,083
I'll be right back.

598
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,500
I'll go with you!

599
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:36,042
Nothing will happen to me.
Relax.

600
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:38,458
The building must be done by next month.
I'll be back.

601
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:05,250
Auto! Please stop!

602
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,458
Please go!

603
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:11,125
Where to, ma'am?
-What? I'll tell you. Go!

604
01:11:19,417 --> 01:11:20,458
Drive faster, please!

605
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,833
Never mind the speed!
Tell me where you want to go!

606
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:27,917
Keep driving!
I'll tell you.

607
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,083
Is Krishna around?

608
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:45,000
Mr. Krishna is not here.
Nobody's here.

609
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,125
Is anyone...
-Check the construction site.

610
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,750
Wait!
Which site?

611
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,875
I need to pick up school kids, ma'am!
Tell me where to go, or find another auto!

612
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Police station.

613
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,917
Is the Sub Inspector here?
-What happened?

614
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:13,458
My husband Krishna...

615
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,583
Have Aadhar cards with death certificates!
Can't cremate without it!

616
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,750
Sir...
-Hello!

617
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,250
Oh no, no!
-Wait a minute, sir...

618
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,375
Why did you come here?
We didn't call you!

619
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,750
There is no case against you.
All enquires will be done by phone! Go!

620
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:29,208
If you're here, we're in danger!
-My husband is going to die!

621
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,375
Please try and save him!
-He's 'going to die'?

622
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,958
How do you know that?
-You won't believe me if I told you!

623
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,333
Our unborn baby, Diya,
is killing everyone in my family!

624
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:43,583
She's going to kill Krishna, too.
Please save him!

625
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,875
If I save Krishna,
who will save me? Now go!

626
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,583
He won't answer the phone...
-Get her out of here!

627
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,083
Let's go, ma'am.
-Constable!

628
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,875
Come along, ma'am.
Listen to me!

629
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,375
How did this happen?
-While wiring, it cracked under pressure.

630
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,417
Use additional staff to clear this!

631
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:28,250
Nothing's done yet!
-They started at dawn. It'll wrap up soon.

632
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:31,208
Stop talking crap!
Who'll explain it to the Managing Director?

633
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,792
It'll be done right away.
We'll start now. No problem!

634
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,042
My job is only planning and supervision.
You must take care of logistics!

635
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,167
So much has happened!
What were you all doing?

636
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:57,458
Don't try to talk your way
out of this...

637
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,042
Where to now, ma'am?

638
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:11,083
Ma'am!
I asked you where you want to go now!

639
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:26,708
The building must be done by next month.

640
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,250
Go to Old Mahabalipuram Road.

641
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,917
This block must be ready in ten days.
I can't explain this mess to the M.D.!

642
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,042
We can do it!

643
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:12,708
Make it fast!

644
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:14,792
Stop the vehicle!

645
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:37,542
The pillar's coming your way, sir!
Move!

646
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:45,875
Raise it up all the way!

647
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,250
Lift that!
Carefully!

648
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:48,833
Our unborn baby, Diya,
is killing everyone in my family!

649
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:51,792
In the doctor's car,
all the doors had the child lock on!

650
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:53,875
But there was no child in that car.
Why?

651
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,167
She's going to kill Krishna, too.

652
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,250
It's true that you saved me.

653
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,792
But this kind of accident
is very common at the site.

654
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:10,208
Please don't correlate this with that.

655
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,208
No, Krishna.
You don't know.

656
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,958
Diya did it.

657
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:22,792
The chain snapping.
The rock falling.

658
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,708
All part of Diya's plan to kill you.

659
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,125
Tulasi, please...
-My child...

660
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,875
I don't know what's causing you grief.

661
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:36,042
But I see that this grief
is not just between the two of you.

662
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:43,250
Sometimes, a fault from the past
tends to revolve around us as karma.

663
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:48,833
In order to be free of it,
a few penances should be sufficient.

664
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,708
If you wish,
go meet Mr. Kanchipuram Balaswamy.

665
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,583
He will give you the right solution
for your situation.

666
01:17:57,708 --> 01:18:00,500
Uncle mentioned him too.
Shall we call him home right away?

667
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:04,042
Rituals and penances
can make this alright.

668
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,167
I don't know what will be made alright.

669
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,083
But I want you to be free of this.

670
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,750
Mom!

671
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,667
Please don't do this, mom!

672
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:50,708
It hurts, mom!

673
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:53,500
Stop this, mom!
It really hurts!

674
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,667
Don't do this, mom!
It's hurting me!

675
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:19,917
What happened, Tulasi?

676
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:29,958
I'll answer it.

677
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:37,125
My name is Balaswamy.
Is this the home of Krishna and Tulasi?

678
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:43,083
No.
There's nobody here by those names.

679
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,000
This was the address given over the phone.

680
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:39,417
The crane cable got disconnected
and the pillar fell here.

681
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:42,375
Note down everything.
-Yes, sir.

682
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,917
Where were you then?

683
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:46,125
I was talking to my boss.
Few people were around.

684
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,750
From there?
-No, not there.

685
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:08,667
The doctor's accident didn't happen here.
It was over there.

686
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,167
Get me the CCTV footage.

687
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,042
Ramesh.
-Yes, sir.

688
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,125
Got the death certificate?
-I'll get it.

689
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,667
Get it for all the deaths. Don't miss any.
-Yes, sir.

690
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:27,500
And the CCTV footage?
-It's ready.

691
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:29,083
All cameras?
-Yes, sir.

692
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:32,333
Won't you check, Balakumar?
You know how long we have waited for it?

693
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,958
You get the postmortem report
while getting the death certificate.

694
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,875
Why is it still here?

695
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,208
Go and get a copy of this.

696
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:46,292
Send it to the Commissioner.
The media shouldn't know. Keep it a secret.

697
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:54,542
Tulasi, this is an important meeting.
I'll come in ten minutes.

698
01:21:54,667 --> 01:21:56,458
I will come with you.
-No, you stay here.

699
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,875
You be here.
I'll be back.

700
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:10,667
Tulasi?
-She is outside.

701
01:22:11,667 --> 01:22:13,708
I saw your message.
She's in bad shape.

702
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:16,958
Yes, doctor.
I don't know what to do.

703
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:20,875
Tulasi should get alright.
I'm ready to do anything for that.

704
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,083
Help me, doctor. Please.

705
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:27,875
If you are not with Tulasi,
she is scared that you'll be in danger.

706
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,750
That's the problem.

707
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:34,208
It is very simple.
We first need to remove that fear.

708
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:39,417
Tulasi must see that nothing will happen
to you, even if she's not around.

709
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:41,875
If she starts believing it,
she will be alright.

710
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,083
Tulasi won’t leave my side
even for a minute.

711
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:49,917
You have to leave her
and stay away for two days.

712
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,833
Tulasi shouldn't know your whereabouts.

713
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:56,500
No one should know.

714
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,667
Also, switch off your phone.

715
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:00,958
You can come back to her
after two days.

716
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,708
Then, she will trust that nothing
will happen to you.

717
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:08,333
Give it a try.
I think this simple psychiatric approach...

718
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,750
...will be the best treatment for her.

719
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:11,875
Let's see.

720
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:14,375
Shall we go?

721
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:21,042
Take that footage?
-This one?

722
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:22,708
Forward it.
-Okay, sir.

723
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,917
Stop there.

724
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,708
Zoom a bit.
-Just a minute, sir.

725
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,958
How did the car wiper
switch on automatically?

726
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:35,000
What if Tulasi is right?

727
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,875
Could it be the soul of her unborn child
who has killed everyone?

728
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,708
I need to meet Tulasi right now.

729
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,125
Krishna!

730
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,083
Diya!

731
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:13,667
You live in Chennai.
Then why did you ask for the guest house?

732
01:25:13,792 --> 01:25:15,500
I have been tied up with a lot of work.

733
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,500
Thought of switching off the phone
and taking a break for two days.

734
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:22,750
No problem. I got the basement ready
for you. Feel comfortable.

735
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,875
No one will disturb you for two days.

736
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,875
Watchman is not here.
You must take care of food on your own.

737
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Take care.
Bye.

738
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,333
Hi, Tulasi.

739
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,375
Where is Krishna?

740
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Krishna is on leave.
Don't you know about it?

741
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,250
Leave?

742
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:34,917
Do you know where he has gone?
-I don't know.

743
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:36,708
Any problem?
Is everything fine?

744
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,042
Tulasi!

745
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Mr. Krishna!

746
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,917
Excuse me!
Anyone there?

747
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,208
Is Krishna here?
-He hasn't come yet.

748
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:33,625
Do you know where will he be?
-No, ma'am.

749
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:00,833
Hey, give me Tulasi's number.

750
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,542
We don't have Tulasi's number.
We have Krishna's number.

751
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:05,708
Krishna's number is switched off!
-I'm sorry.

752
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:09,042
Won't you even note the number
of a person who files a complaint?

753
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,750
Brother, do you know where Krishna is?

754
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,792
I don't know, ma'am.
He didn't come here.

755
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:03,792
Tulasi.

756
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,500
Tulasi!
Turn the car around.

757
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,375
Go fast!

758
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:27,958
Get going, you!

759
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,125
Go fast, man!

760
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,542
Diya!
No!

761
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:44,917
Mom!

762
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:44,792
What happened, doctor?

763
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:47,708
You saved not just one life, but two.

764
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:50,167
She is pregnant!

765
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,500
Diya!

766
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:13,042
I want to see you.
Please!

767
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:22,125
Mom!

768
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:42,375
