00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,209
Silk

2
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:37,482
Is Godavari between your village and Amalapuram?

3
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:38,610
Why baby?

4
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,561
Quiz program, sitting in front of Nagarjuna

5
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,273
Question of a crore, tell the answer please.

6
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:49,993
There was a smart guy with you last time. Is his name Nagarjuna?

7
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,737
Rani! Do you not know who Nagarjuna is?

8
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:59,266
There would be many men coming to us. How many can I remember?

9
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,842
I saw an unforgettable man, will call back.

10
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:07,392
There is no logic for the heart beating 72 times in 60 seconds

11
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,376
What would I say about my deeds?

12
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,259
Bro, why have you called me here?

13
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,883
Why are you walking on silently?

14
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:49,098
Is Srinath there?

15
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:50,211
Who are you?

16
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,658
I did not like the way you asked.

17
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,091
Who is Srinath from you?

18
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:15,731
Me, so what?

19
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:37,458
Who are you man?

20
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:49,427
You and my friend Bobby fought 3 years back. Do you remember?

21
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:50,803
So what?

22
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,139
One guy had tried to stop you both.

23
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,675
You caught his collar, Do you remember?

24
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,491
How do I remember whom I had pushed and in which fight?

25
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:04,899
You will have it so, If you do not remember.

26
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:06,275
Hey mental!

27
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,562
In some fight as I pushed you, why do you come and hit me now.

28
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:12,891
Ego man!

29
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:15,347
You would have me then itself, right?

30
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:16,715
Same day, I would left to the US.

31
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,067
I just dropped back.

32
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:19,587
Came directly to you

33
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,707
Alex, come on.

34
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:37,203
Give it to him.

35
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:38,835
Boss!

36
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:41,131
Photo

37
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,298
Bro, are you good or bad?

38
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:26,742
Hey kind hearted warrior, you are handsome baddie!

39
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,583
Fools cannot compete with you and are different

40
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,255
You are your chariot

41
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,366
What are the great warriors before you?

42
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:44,303
Even the war is small for you

43
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,710
They run away seeing you, what to say

44
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,440
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

45
00:07:55,198 --> 00:08:01,255
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

46
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:37,189
Hey, how did I swing in this air so?

47
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:43,565
Okay man, do whatever you thought of

48
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:49,581
You are different, why do not you change?

49
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:56,189
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

50
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:03,021
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

51
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:09,885
What a man is he without an ego?

52
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:16,565
One believing this is our man

53
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:23,845
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

54
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:30,701
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

55
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:37,428
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

56
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:44,173
Come, come Rowdy! Come, come Rowdy

57
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,469
Bro, you remember? We need to meet the broker tomorrow.

58
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:59,261
Bro, just understand. My job will be set if you concentrate.

59
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:01,020
Let us see

60
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,725
Bro, if you say so my life is like settled.

61
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:14,523
What happened, why would you stop the car suddenly?

62
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:15,667
Did not you like the song?

63
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,452
Hey, what happened?

64
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,916
Hey bro, leave it. It becomes a risk.

65
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:22,766
Listen to me please

66
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,047
He is alive. Come on.

67
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,558
Okay!

68
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,994
Open the door

69
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:30,818
Why this unnecessary risk?

70
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,563
Hail to our sir, hail to our sir

71
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:39,931
Hey, road is blocked up.

72
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,155
Boss, bear a bit

73
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:51,868
There is rally on, take a diversion

74
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,053
Sir, he is like dying.

75
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:54,294
Sir, sir please sir

76
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:54,965
Where is the hospital?

77
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,757
Bro, it takes half an hour this way and 5 minutes this way

78
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,094
Careful

79
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:06,958
Hey, take out the vehicle

80
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:09,718
Bro, he is like dying

81
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,925
Brother, serious case is inside the car

82
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,153
What are the police doing?

83
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,913
What are you doing?

84
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:37,305
We are not putting any case. We will look into it outside.

85
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,632
Happened is happened, Apologise to them

86
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:45,609
Bro, tell him sorry

87
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,138
Why should I say sorry? He is the one holding the rally.

88
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:52,217
Hey

89
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,624
I am speaking here, right?

90
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,057
You are the one who gave permission.

91
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:57,561
In fact, you should say sorry to me.

92
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,280
You do not tell me rules.

93
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:00,968
What if I tell?

94
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:03,225
I do all as per rules.

95
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,823
I will break as many rules to save a life.

96
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:07,570
How did the accident take place?

97
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:08,788
I do not know

98
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:08,610
What is his name?

99
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:09,443
I do not know

100
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:10,186
Who is he?

101
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:11,221
I do not know

102
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:16,182
When you think so much about unknown, How much shall I think about great people like him?

103
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,481
Still, why to know for saving a life?

104
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:19,873
Why are you speaking harsh, bloody?

105
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:29,233
That guy had come into my life unknowingly.

106
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,953
He is staring into my eyes from six inches close.

107
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:38,017
My brow is shaking. Breathe is heating up.

108
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:43,326
Eyes are getting red. I ca not hear what he is saying.

109
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,716
I just understood one thing.

110
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,363
I should get into his life.

111
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:54,900
Sorry

112
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:01,756
Ranapratap Jaidev

113
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,324
You will listen to this name repeatedly

114
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:29,243
Would Mahabharat be there if Duryodhan had taken it light when Draupadi laughed at him?

115
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:30,300
It would not be

116
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:31,796
Ok

117
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,315
Would Ramayan be there if Ravan took it light when Sita laughed at him?

118
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,284
It would not be

119
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,164
Then all the epics are about ego problems.

120
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:53,972
Which peg is this?

121
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:04,044
Where would that SP be?

122
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,875
Bro, he is not any student to hit for catching the collar.

123
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,292
He would shoot back, leave him bro.

124
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,124
Do not feel bad to be asking now.

125
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,243
We need to meet the broker tomorrow.

126
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,459
My work will be done if you concentrate.

127
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:22,987
Is he genuine?

128
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,795
From home guard to home minister, he will get us any post.

129
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,763
My work will be done if you concentrate.

130
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:39,283
A car is approaching in a speed of 60 to 65 km speed boss.

131
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,395
Should I allow him?

132
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:41,252
Shut up

133
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:42,155
Sorry boss.

134
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,220
When I said to concentrate, you directly targeted me bro!

135
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:50,891
Your guy has come.

136
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:53,164
Why my guy again?

137
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,284
I am the one in touch on phone all these days.

138
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,443
My name is Bobby, BSc computers.

139
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:02,859
Ok, I am not here to write your autobiography.

140
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:03,899
Tell, what is the matter?

141
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:07,804
What are the posts above SP available?

142
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:08,995
Why?

143
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:10,027
What are there?

144
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,051
DIG, IG and DGP

145
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,555
Bro would join if something is given from those.

146
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,371
You do not understand the system completely.

147
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,195
Nothing would be given from them,

148
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:23,923
They said India is a democratic country.

149
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:24,995
Still they will not give.

150
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:33,939
He says no.

151
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,188
Tell something and manage.

152
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:37,780
Ok

153
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,035
If given SP of some district, bro would join.

154
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,027
Even DSP and CI cannot be done.

155
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:50,283
What else is available then?

156
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:51,564
We can manage if it is SI.

157
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:52,715
What to do for that?

158
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:54,947
There would be written exam for that.

159
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,604
That anyways would be written by you, right?

160
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,540
I will not write, will get that written.

161
00:16:59,347 --> 00:16:59,780
What else to do?

162
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,003
There would be physical.

163
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:01,594
What to do for that?

164
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,906
Need to run 5KM in 25 minutes.

165
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,169
We will go to Olympics by running so, why is the job then?

166
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,898
Look, I ca not do anything if you speak as you wish.

167
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:10,569
How much?

168
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:15,065
Come here once.

169
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:19,114
Should manage the written exam and then.

170
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,585
Boy looks hefty and should even manage physical.

171
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,065
Can manage in 40 to 45.

172
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:31,505
Will give 50.

173
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,050
Will the work be done?

174
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,745
Come, come Rowdy do what you like

175
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,793
Come, come, come hey rowdy

176
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,530
Come, come Rowdy do what you like

177
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,530
Come, come, come hey rowdy

178
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:12,393
Come, come Rowdy do what you like

179
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:16,698
Come, come, come hey rowdy

180
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,858
What is this? We thought of west Godavari posting, why is it given for east?

181
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:35,145
What we spoke was about job and not about district.

182
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:37,802
You took 50 lakhs, should have told all these before.

183
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,746
Everything will have a rate, understood?

184
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,826
Ok! He is in ego and that fellow is harsh.

185
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,721
Why am I stuck in between?

186
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:51,513
Ticket

187
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,410
Yes boss,

188
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:55,977
Your ticket Boss.

189
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,113
Boss, I do not like you travelling in train.

190
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:07,865
Alex! All these days spent money on others for the first time I am spending for me.

191
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:08,953
I understand boss

192
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,841
Feeling like to enjoy life, is it wrong?

193
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,889
Not wrong boss, small request.

194
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:14,713
Will shift at least to 1st AC boss.

195
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:15,335
Alex

196
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,064
Boss

197
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:16,751
Relax

198
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:17,464
Ok Boss

199
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,512
Your money fell down sir.

200
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,728
What sir, do you want to prove good men are in police?

201
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,935
Its money, be careful.

202
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,744
Only this care has not come from childhood sir.

203
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,768
I do not have big hopes and do not know about hunger.

204
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,872
Need lies between hunger and hope.

205
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,144
None knows how and when it comes.

206
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,839
Be careful son.

207
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,467
It is good sir, but did not understand.

208
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,107
My station has come. See you son.

209
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:55,698
November 22, few hours after drooping in Rajole.

210
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:09,746
Sir!

211
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:11,226
Where is my place?

212
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:13,682
What will you have sir?

213
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:17,474
Transfer.

214
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:18,722
Transfer?

215
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:22,498
Need to work minimum 2 years after joining duty sir.

216
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:26,843
Leave that and think the available alternative.

217
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,810
Alternative means, like Balaiah from Rowdy Inspector film.

218
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:37,914
If you either hit big ones of the society or open up their corruption.

219
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,122
You will be automatically transferred sir.

220
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,786
Everything looks fine, but where would I find that idiot right now?

221
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,034
Am I looking an idiot to you? Will you let me in or not?

222
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,114
Not possible to go in.

223
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:49,858
Why not? What is your SI thinking?

224
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,554
Do you know, no kid is taken breakfast from morning?

225
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,898
Will you make even a girl outside, stupid!

226
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:56,810
Go and call your SI

227
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,003
What is the matter?

228
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:01,162
Is it? I will look into it, go

229
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,034
Ragging case sir.

230
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:05,914
Bloody fellows, will not leave any girls.

231
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,850
It is the girl who ragged sir.

232
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:09,938
Is it?

233
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,250
She looks good.

234
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,610
Looks like she is egoistic.

235
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:40,771
Who is that guy overacting so much there?

236
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:43,034
He is a big one in the society sir.

237
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,283
Why late then, let him in fast!

238
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:46,483
Hey.

239
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,464
Gavaskar, they are calling.

240
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:51,512
They will call, they will wait.

241
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:54,856
SI sir is calling.

242
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:59,568
Who is he to call me? He is made girls stand out from morning, who is he?

243
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:06,065
Hello Megha, you just wait. Will come back in 5 minutes.

244
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:09,384
Who is he, who is overacting here?

245
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:11,873
What is the problem, what is your problem?

246
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,818
Gavaskar, they are saying a case.

247
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,504
Case? Who would file a case on me?

248
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,096
All these are our boys.

249
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:21,272
Not that.

250
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,464
No, I said you to wait out for 5 min. Just wait.

251
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,088
Ok.

252
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,313
Excuse me sir.

253
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:43,472
What?

254
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:47,408
My friend is gone in saying 5 minutes. It is 2 hours and is not still out.

255
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:49,936
He will come, will take some time. Wait.

256
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,064
What.

257
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:54,568
Is it?

258
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:00,784
What is this?

259
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,864
Do not you know even that? That is Vicks inhaler.

260
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:08,208
What I asked was not about this, I asked why this is?

261
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,352
Maintaining it as all friends said would be stylish.

262
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:13,346
Sir.

263
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,010
What?

264
00:24:14,426 --> 00:24:15,306
Just came to know a fact sir.

265
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,394
One girl from the three outside should be left sir.

266
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:19,330
Megha!

267
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:20,506
What, does she belong to you?

268
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:20,822
No sir

269
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:21,726
Then

270
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:23,678
It seems is the daughter of SP of the adjacent district.

271
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,219
My luck, all are coming in my favour today.

272
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,595
Do one thing. Hold her and leave the other two girls.

273
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,091
What shall I do with this buffalo sir?

274
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:36,707
Push him into lockup.

275
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:37,570
I fear about lockup.

276
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:39,683
Hey buffalo come, come inside.

277
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,170
Sir, will there be AC in lockup?

278
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:43,498
There is a central AC, come in.

279
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,546
Megha, will go for steam bath and come.

280
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:49,066
Next is the sonar bath for you, move.

281
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:55,698
What is your father?

282
00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,002
Postman sir.

283
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,875
Even telegrams are stopped, maybe is free. Call him.

284
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,426
Sir, no sir.

285
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:08,450
Call him.

286
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:09,362
Please sir.

287
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,041
Tell the number.

288
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,577
9848012345

289
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:17,898
What, why is she given my number?

290
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:29,891
What is this, even when you said 9848012345 I hear as 08812222114.

291
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,299
Sir.

292
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,515
Please sir, please sir no sir.

293
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,139
Hello!

294
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:45,123
Your daughter is booked in ragging case at Rajole station. Come and take her.

295
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,266
Who are you?

296
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,459
Ranapratap Jaidev.

297
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:54,035
I already said you will listen to this name repeatedly.

298
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,307
Will finish formalities if any and take her.

299
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:08,290
I will not file case on ladies. She too is egoistic like her father.

300
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:10,763
Take her.

301
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,698
Ok sir, thank you.

302
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,202
Thank you sir.

303
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:16,506
Rowdy fellow.

304
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,059
Hello, even my lawyer is here. Will go if you leave me.

305
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,356
Hey Gavva.

306
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:24,899
Not Gavva, I am Gavaskar.

307
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:28,115
What is he sir, is repeatedly beating me up.

308
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,043
Hey, will you answer a question?

309
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:31,676
What

310
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:32,620
What do you think of me?

311
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:34,428
Will think a lot, will we say all those or what?

312
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:37,996
Thinking of getting you hit by someone.

313
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:44,332
Cannot bear anymore. I will get you transferred from here.

314
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:49,380
Hey, he understood the matter. Leave me.

315
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:13,860
Rani, have you seen the film in my theatre?

316
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,832
Poster.

317
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:21,966
What sir?

318
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,117
Who is she, looking so new?

319
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:25,734
My wife sir.

320
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:32,214
We put Seethamma Vakitlo for Sivaratri, I was asking whether she saw it or not?

321
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:33,582
If not, show her.

322
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:36,053
Better I say not to come for work for tomorrow.

323
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:37,557
What Ambulance?

324
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:38,366
Sir.

325
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:39,830
Have not you still started service?

326
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:40,806
None came across still.

327
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:42,758
Even for me.

328
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:47,286
None feels this ambulance, entire village thinks this as a service auto.

329
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,285
What to do, patients are less for our Doctor.

330
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,732
You have more right?

331
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,477
Whatever is money, right sir?

332
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:56,740
Picture is important for me.

333
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,164
Hello!

334
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,941
Brother in law!

335
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:00,932
Tell blackie.

336
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:03,891
What blackie, became fair even without fair&lovely.

337
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,236
Tell the matter first.

338
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,114
He hit me stripping.

339
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:07,722
Body is swollen up.

340
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:10,594
Is it? Who is he?

341
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,754
Salman Khan! Will you stop that?

342
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,034
When?

343
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,634
Will I call now, if it was on last birthday?

344
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,930
I will see to it, you come back.

345
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:21,218
Not seeing, I am trying brother from other phone. He is not lifting my call.

346
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,722
He is still not put hearing aid. You hang it up, I will talk to him.

347
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,602
See to it.

348
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:30,114
Hello, why ca not you lift the phone?

349
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,930
He will hit, if I lift.

350
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,458
Why will they hit?

351
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:40,906
Hello, where is brother in law?

352
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,578
Deaf idiot, putting on the aid.

353
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,405
What?

354
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,618
Bro, where is elder bro in law?

355
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:54,194
He is at the pond, go!

356
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:57,930
Hey, take out the Ambulance.

357
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:07,298
Dream of 30 years! Looks to come now. Ministry!

358
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,546
Man should have some patience.

359
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,482
All cannot hider anger like you sir.

360
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:23,065
Should hide, this anger is a very costly matter.

361
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,250
Should not repeatedly use.

362
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,778
Bro, someone has come for you

363
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,658
Ask him to wait.

364
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:32,450
They will wait.

365
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,099
Remove the hand, I need to go in and speak.

366
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,095
You remove the hand.

367
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:38,848
Sir will come.

368
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,192
It is been very long since I came.

369
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:41,199
Ca not you understand?

370
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:44,407
What?

371
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:45,695
My name is Ravindranath.

372
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:47,943
I work for an NGO named Asha.

373
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,943
These days you are serving less and collecting more.

374
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,463
I came not to take, but to give.

375
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:56,503
What is that?

376
00:29:58,999 --> 00:29:59,423
Notice.

377
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:00,535
On me?

378
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,863
There is a complaint on you that you are grabbing lands from the farmers of Kolleru.

379
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:08,728
I see. It was for rent right, Krishna?

380
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:09,639
Yes bro.

381
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,127
Is it true or false?

382
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:11,871
True bro.

383
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,008
It is true then. Have we paid their money, Krishna?

384
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:16,919
We have given bro.

385
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:18,968
Is this true or false?

386
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:20,608
True bro.

387
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:22,647
This too is a truth it seems.

388
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,999
I have not come for true and false. For the problems instead.

389
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:29,288
In which account is that, Krishna?

390
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:30,696
No idea bro.

391
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:33,191
Is not there, it seems.

392
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,855
Sun looks sharp, please leave.

393
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:42,183
Everyone comes with a file. Shall I serve or say answers to these?

394
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:43,848
Take out the vehicle.

395
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:46,103
Bro in law, hello.

396
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:49,880
What Silk, will you not end showing those porn films?

397
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:50,879
Will stop bro.

398
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:52,239
Entire village is speaking about you.

399
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:53,503
Yes, speaking bro.

400
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:54,991
You will not change?

401
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:55,935
Will not change bro.

402
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:57,735
Ok, tell what is the matter?

403
00:30:58,383 --> 00:30:59,208
One transfer is needed bro.

404
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:00,640
Hey!

405
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:01,695
Bro.

406
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,127
Tell to Krishna for such matters.

407
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:04,952
Will tell bro.

408
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:07,111
Do not bring such small matters to me.

409
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:07,856
Will not bring bro.

410
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:09,352
See you bro.

411
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:11,463
One.

412
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,199
Hey, need one transfer.

413
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:13,951
Two.

414
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:15,591
Three.

415
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:17,191
Bad news sir.

416
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:23,783
Where is the transfer to?

417
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:51,075
Hello sir.

418
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:51,779
What happened?

419
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,035
Sir, its punctured sir. You?

420
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:56,675
I am the newly joining SI

421
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:57,667
Sir

422
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:58,787
How long are you waiting?

423
00:31:59,163 --> 00:31:59,763
It is almost 45 minutes sir.

424
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:01,427
Why, no autos in this route?

425
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:02,883
There are sir, but will not stop.

426
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:04,011
Why?

427
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,643
That is because we do not pay them sir.

428
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:06,899
Could you not ask for a lift?

429
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:07,947
They too will not stop sir.

430
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:08,903
Why?

431
00:32:09,352 --> 00:32:10,016
Because we may ask for licence.

432
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,784
Ok come, I am new to this city.

433
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:15,488
Where are you coming from?

434
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:20,360
Our station comes under Eluru rural station sir. We keep going around this area for rounds sir.

435
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:21,768
Will Kolleru be good?

436
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:23,072
It is great sir.

437
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,842
Will show you the film uncle.

438
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,570
Hey, why is the ambulance here?

439
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,386
He is Silk Babu, one of the worst fellows in city sir.

440
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,938
He is here means would have planned something sir.

441
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:11,818
Boys.

442
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:25,386
Police! We are rounding you up.

443
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:33,426
All are our guys. Brought them here leaving out the cultural show.

444
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:35,242
Hey bro.

445
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:36,146
Yes bro.

446
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:43,634
It seems he had a sona bath at the station. Will present you the same now.

447
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:51,054
Boys.

448
00:33:58,493 --> 00:34:04,973
Hey man given me the sonar bath! You will now know who is Gavaskar?

449
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,109
Silk sir, shall I order for tea?

450
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:10,269
Should be here in five minutes, go!

451
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:16,693
No doubt, you are in a bad time. Very bad time.

452
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:22,029
Alex.

453
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,405
Yes boss.

454
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,533
Sorry boss, late by 10 minutes.

455
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,773
Bro! Who is this, looks like a missing baby of Elephant.

456
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:37,133
He is not elephant baby, he is like a road roller on the road.

457
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,133
Correct bro.

458
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:41,613
Tell boss.

459
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:47,094
Leave those and clear the rest.

460
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,680
What is circling his finger and showing?

461
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,557
May be skin is peeled off on some finger bro.

462
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:56,909
Boys.

463
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,461
Bro, what is that beating?

464
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,390
Oh God!

465
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,550
Do not you have any humanity?

466
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:55,837
Sir.

467
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:00,165
Is this the time to have tea?

468
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:08,766
Sir, hot ginger tea came just in 5 minutes.

469
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:11,380
Ginger tea bro.

470
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:15,357
What shall we do now?

471
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:20,678
It is the morning show time. If you permit, will go and open the booking.

472
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:25,717
Go man.

473
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,757
Sir permitted and said can leave.

474
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,437
Hey!

475
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:34,205
He caught me.

476
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:35,974
Have you called sir?

477
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:41,453
All the plan is yours, right?

478
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:46,677
Father promise! I have no link to this. As my bro said to show a good fight, I came here sir.

479
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:48,277
What are you doing here then?

480
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,365
As my girlfriend is transferred by your grace, came here to flirt.

481
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,237
You and your style, like clothes on a buffalo.

482
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,789
If the collar goes up again.

483
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:01,565
It will not sir.

484
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:03,437
If the shirt is in.

485
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:04,605
Will not sir.

486
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:06,989
Will kill in encounter.

487
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:08,549
Will you kill for such a small thing?

488
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,349
Understood sir, should speak low.

489
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:14,429
Go.

490
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:16,117
Get away, bloody fellow.

491
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:42,317
Name is Ranapratap Jaidev, not in good relation with your SP.

492
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,477
I do not know how many days would I be in this station.

493
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:50,485
Nothing more to say about me.

494
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:52,086
Sorry to disturb you sir.

495
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,413
There is a lot to know about this station sir.

496
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:56,614
This station is built perfectly according to Vasthu.

497
00:37:58,013 --> 00:37:59,053
I will show one by one if you come along.

498
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:04,381
Come sir. For all of us to relax on this side is the rest room.

499
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:09,998
This will be liked for sure sir. This is your room sir

500
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,701
To fire up all, it is on this side sir.

501
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,093
Strength of Vasthu sir.

502
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:15,876
Will get it dusted sir.

503
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,549
This is the Indian style bathroom this side sir.

504
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:21,693
Will get it cleaned sir.

505
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:22,789
Move.

506
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:26,366
This side will have nothing in general, but now heavy with Alex here.

507
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,741
Why are the stations so?

508
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,702
That is, the stations are so from 1870s sir.

509
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:34,413
They will be said museums then.

510
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:43,693
Alex! Urgently modernise and fix LED TVs. and Government officers should work 24/7.

511
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:45,469
Arrange something outside for my recreation.

512
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:48,193
Like in American films get the prisoners dressed in uniform.

513
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:50,179
Use room fresheners when I go for interrogation.

514
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,897
Use mouth fresheners when I go near.

515
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:53,577
Alex, how many days would you take for all these to be done?

516
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:54,849
Give me 15 days boss.

517
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:56,873
Then declare 15 holidays for this station.

518
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,745
Sir, stations will not have holiday is sir.

519
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,433
Then arrange mobile stations similar to mobile courts.

520
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:04,689
What about the prisoners’ then sir?

521
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,689
Move them along with us, they would relax with the fresh air.

522
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:09,361
This station should be great under my rule.

523
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:23,361
Hey, she is our relation.

524
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:25,098
I will take care sir.

525
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,809
Hey clear it, Clear everything. What are you seeing?

526
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,225
Why is this bloody guy here?

527
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:34,177
Should I solve it boss?

528
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:35,634
Alex, relax.

529
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:36,737
Ok boss.

530
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:39,465
Should not identify.

531
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:41,434
Hey!

532
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,001
He identified.

533
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:50,313
You are behind me everywhere. Are you following and trapping me?

534
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,233
No, no.

535
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,329
What trapping me is a waste?

536
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:00,073
No sir, that was about following sir.

537
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:01,689
Means its ok for trapping

538
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:06,634
What do I talk when you jingle around with words sir?

539
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:09,241
Do not act.

540
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,090
First accident in life sir, I am also feeling very bad.

541
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:16,745
Means, want to learn driving by killing 2 or 3 now?

542
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,497
What shall I do sir?

543
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:28,855
If you are caught again with some mischief, you will have it. What happens?

544
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,334
I will not repeat such words sir.

545
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,071
Go

546
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,811
Red and yellow rowdy fellow

547
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:50,715
Looking at me and is following

548
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:54,347
Rowdy fellow is shaking me up in dreams

549
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:57,764
Danger fellow comes in dreams with harassing

550
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:01,388
Danger fellow with aiming eyes

551
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:07,684
I know where you are and what you do baby

552
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:15,837
Playing tricks and when caught you will have it

553
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:19,188
He is a mix of some ego and some anger

554
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:22,637
He is of power with some strength and pose

555
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:26,077
He is the brother of evil looking like a magic deer

556
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,741
He is the villain looking like a priest

557
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:54,533
In this sudden time of the weather change

558
00:41:55,549 --> 00:42:01,165
Magic of a dream spraying tranquilizer

559
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:08,741
Dream drenched in colours is flying high

560
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:16,045
Flew up above like a parrot from the ground

561
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:19,677
He is the fight with some sweet and some sourness

562
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:23,012
He is the mad guy with some madness and some vagueness

563
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:26,428
He is the brother of evil looking like a magic deer

564
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:30,109
He is the villain looking like a priest

565
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:31,692
Do you have license?

566
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,367
Who do you think am I? SP!

567
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:54,322
I know where you are and what you do baby

568
00:42:55,655 --> 00:43:02,467
Playing tricks and when caught you will have it

569
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,931
He is a mix of some ego and some anger

570
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:09,453
He is of power with some strength and pose

571
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:12,712
He is the brother of evil looking like a magic deer

572
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:16,461
He is the villain looking like a priest

573
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:10,533
No comments, move on

574
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,498
Sir, sir please tell me

575
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:28,759
Sir, Durga Prasad sir.

576
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:31,518
Hello Durgaprasad garu.

577
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:32,972
Come, come.

578
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:34,883
Hello sir...

579
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:36,914
Madam is positive about you.

580
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:39,471
She just spoke even on phone.

581
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,922
But about the fishing at Kolleru, media here too is aware.

582
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,514
Issues of state should not become national interest, right?

583
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:54,999
We shall stop for now.

584
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:59,950
Shall I speak to madam?

585
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:06,046
Even we are not able to catch her. I forgot, this is a good tea party. Have a tea.

586
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:19,625
Sir Tea.

587
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,253
I entered politics 40 years back.

588
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,693
No TV to watch and no channel to show.

589
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,769
Then one has become a Minister.

590
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,067
He looted properties of entire villagers.

591
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:52,854
I understood then to snatch for becoming something.

592
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:56,745
Should snatch.

593
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:01,215
Sir, do not know Telugu sir.

594
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,449
That is why I am telling you.

595
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:11,255
You will understand my feeling if you know the language.

596
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:51,000
Hey.

597
00:46:57,122 --> 00:47:01,146
Hey, did not know that village has got voice again.

598
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:05,915
I did not know that it would be heard till Delhi.

599
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:09,058
If I had known.

600
00:47:57,518 --> 00:48:00,020
Throat of the one shouted about your village is drying out.

601
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:06,549
Any man with dare can pour water.

602
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:55,591
Hey.

603
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,440
Is anyone else daring enough?

604
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,661
Hey Reddy! You said Kolleru and birds. There is not even a single bird to be seen here.

605
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:28,422
That is they used to come once, but as ponds are all dug now it is been polluted sir.

606
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:30,133
They too stopped coming sir.

607
00:49:30,692 --> 00:49:30,787
Do you have match box?

608
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,027
I do not smoke sir.

609
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:37,260
Ca not ask ladies.

610
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:41,475
Do you have a match box?

611
00:49:41,932 --> 00:49:42,442
No sir.

612
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:46,719
Grandpa, do you have a match box?

613
00:49:48,038 --> 00:49:49,434
It is you grandpa.

614
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:51,641
Grandpa.

615
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,444
What, looks to be enjoying the nature a lot?

616
00:49:58,197 --> 00:50:00,708
Tears of fish are not known when in water

617
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,458
He seems to be in kick even without a drink.

618
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,679
Waste of the cigarette

619
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:08,703
Hey baby, what is your name?

620
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:09,895
Swecha

621
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:13,007
You put it to bunk school as and when you want to?

622
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,169
That is the name by her father.

623
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:20,621
His dad is mad about her and she is mad about school.

624
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:23,163
Totally a mad family then.

625
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:28,267
Every man thinking about others is mad in the world.

626
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:32,239
Oh no! I asked for a match box. You said no.

627
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:34,103
What is this class to me in this evening?

628
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:37,116
Hey Reddy, our time is bad today.

629
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,188
Time is good today.

630
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:49,268
Why is he come this side?

631
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:53,930
Has he come to know? This mad fellow does all such things.

632
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:55,751
Hello sir!

633
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,238
Hey Silk!

634
00:50:58,063 --> 00:50:59,610
Why did you call me with so much love sir?

635
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:01,106
What is it that you are doing?

636
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:02,841
What did we do?

637
00:51:03,855 --> 00:51:04,368
Do not you know?

638
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:05,380
Do not know sir.

639
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,427
With some poster out, you are showing some other film in it seems.

640
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:09,980
About that, sir?

641
00:51:10,894 --> 00:51:11,613
What did you think then?

642
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:18,072
Who said sir? All are films questioning society sir.

643
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:22,432
Silk sir, silk sir! Public is shouting with no scenes inside.

644
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:24,921
Shall I add now or after interval?

645
00:51:26,145 --> 00:51:28,052
Hey, I will not repeat.

646
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:29,577
Ok sir.

647
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:34,769
Ok, idiot has not put the machine.

648
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:36,923
Why does that police speak so?

649
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,016
What happened?

650
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:40,644
Will anyone see film without scenes and him without clothes?

651
00:51:42,342 --> 00:51:42,876
I know you will see.

652
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:44,159
Show.

653
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:46,787
Mad idiot, he says show.

654
00:51:49,395 --> 00:51:50,621
Showing styles with a smoke in hands.

655
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:53,051
Hey Silk.

656
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:06,579
Do not you want the machine?

657
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:09,515
What police, does not he care about our emotions?

658
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:11,801
May be he does not care.

659
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,488
He put the machine here of course no work even with ears.

660
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,304
Police, you need to control that guy.

661
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:18,829
Whom.

662
00:52:19,246 --> 00:52:21,002
SI, he is not listening to my words.

663
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:26,371
Look, I will tell what to do. You take care of how to do it.

664
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:29,921
What police? You said to say something!

665
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:33,745
There is a rally tomorrow at the party office, right?

666
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:38,019
Party members are 300.

667
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,995
30 police members in the station.

668
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:45,675
Beat up all of them.

669
00:52:46,941 --> 00:52:47,758
It goes in a mass fight.

670
00:53:05,171 --> 00:53:09,125
Police, look at that fellow. We do not have his facility.

671
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,207
What?

672
00:53:11,664 --> 00:53:12,262
Okay, deaf idiot

673
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:31,843
Police, will your people come?

674
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:36,487
Boys are on a good heat. Will smash them up.

675
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,251
Do not do anything till I am on the spot. Does not look good.

676
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:41,979
As you wish.

677
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:06,079
Constable Reddy reporting sir.

678
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,509
Where are the others?

679
00:54:08,948 --> 00:54:09,820
SI sir has sent me alone sir.

680
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:11,346
I said to send all, right?

681
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:12,179
I do not know sir.

682
00:54:21,097 --> 00:54:21,648
Hello!

683
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,429
I said to send the entire force for protection at the rally, right?

684
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:29,687
Thought of sending, but just came to know that SP said it. Thus have not sent.

685
00:54:30,381 --> 00:54:30,878
What?

686
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:36,926
No, do not interfere in this. We both will take care if anything happens.

687
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:38,583
Hey, hello, hello

688
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:47,587
Police bro! All these days with our plans became fools and now with your plan we became bigger fools.

689
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:50,134
You have become the biggest fool.

690
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,264
Better that sound master does not know about this.

691
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:55,328
If known he would have poked you.

692
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:04,758
Sir, he just sent one for the protection sir.

693
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:07,420
He says to speak with you if anything is there.

694
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:10,485
Send him to me once.

695
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:19,931
'Come, come rowdy come'

696
00:55:21,255 --> 00:55:27,439
'Come, come rowdy come'

697
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:28,771
Coffee.

698
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,368
Bloody, may be the marriage looks. Better I spoil this.

699
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:34,395
Girl looks very good.

700
00:55:35,676 --> 00:55:36,167
Good morning sir.

701
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:41,465
Oh God, why did this fellow come?

702
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:43,799
Is this mad fellow a police?

703
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:52,423
Good news sir! I have taken off drunk and drive, triple riding, ragging and all the cases on baby sir.

704
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,834
Mummy, looks like she has all cases other than murder and rape on her.

705
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,347
You do not panic, we will look into all that

706
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,086
Why did you come here?

707
00:56:03,591 --> 00:56:04,295
CI asked me to meet.

708
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:06,682
I asked you to come for the meeting.

709
00:56:08,946 --> 00:56:09,322
Ok.

710
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:12,237
Sir.

711
00:56:20,434 --> 00:56:22,873
Rana! Give me a bloody, damn explanation.

712
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,768
Why did not you send your men for protection.

713
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:28,635
It is me.

714
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:34,874
As said by Balakrishna, let is all Telugu people speak in Telugu sir.

715
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:36,395
Do not try to act smart, ok?

716
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:41,615
Ok! Sir, population of Eluru is 3 lakhs sir.

717
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:49,969
Constables in station are 30. Means as per you, one constable takes care of 10000 people sir.

718
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:55,046
Minister and the cadre put together was less than 300 sir.

719
00:56:55,763 --> 00:57:01,088
Thus not knowing how to send less than one, I sent one sir.

720
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:03,690
Sir, I have one more doubt sir.

721
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:08,864
Do you need 20 constables for you at home sir?

722
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:17,563
One driver, 4 home guards, are so many required sir?

723
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:20,023
Meeting suspended.

724
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:29,772
Hey Rana, come out

725
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:32,530
You are dead now in my hands. Come out

726
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:36,692
Madam. Stop it!

727
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:37,638
Come out.

728
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:38,648
Do not throw the stones dear.

729
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:42,437
As I scolded dad, she is come running.

730
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,089
Hey come here.

731
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:52,305
What?

732
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:57,486
It is gone sir, everything is gone. My marriage is cancelled because of you sir.

733
00:57:59,516 --> 00:58:03,647
To impress him put photos in Facebook with saree sir.

734
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,014
He was selected for civils sir, civils.

735
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:11,689
I thought life is settled now with this sir.

736
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:14,627
Gone, all is gone.

737
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:21,394
Thinking to open rowdy sheet on you for murder attempt on an officer on duty.

738
00:58:22,654 --> 00:58:24,938
Will anyone die hitting with such a small stone sir?

739
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:29,591
Who knows, may die if it hits the brain.

740
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:31,464
What shall I do now sir?

741
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:35,174
Should have attendance daily, ok?

742
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:41,621
If you leave to college from home or vice versa or even go anywhere else should call and say me.

743
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:45,575
Else you and your dad will have.

744
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:47,838
You could have directly asked for number sir.

745
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,695
Think whatever you want, go.

746
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:53,487
Go.

747
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:58,528
Just like her dad.

748
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:08,305
MP Durga Prasad insulted at his own constituency. Police gave a shock for the rally on his birthday.

749
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,262
New guy named Rana.

750
00:59:12,263 --> 00:59:13,833
MP dropped his rally with no police around.

751
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:26,522
Hello Rana garu.

752
00:59:27,506 --> 00:59:28,199
Tell me Gavva.

753
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,421
Identified even with a cloth on.

754
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,288
Nothing sir, there is a talk outside that you gave a warning to Megha.

755
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:36,545
Is it true?

756
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:37,998
Hey, is she your friend or my friend?

757
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:41,012
Of course she is my friend.

758
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:42,344
Mad rascal!

759
00:59:43,673 --> 00:59:45,120
Hey, why did he hang up?

760
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:48,175
Hey, what again?

761
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:49,687
Sir.

762
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:53,508
Tell.

763
00:59:53,996 --> 01:00:00,115
All friends are leaving to Delhi. If you permit will go for three days sir.

764
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,788
Have not you seen Tajmahal anytime?

765
01:00:03,636 --> 01:00:04,730
Not so sir.

766
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,332
Why with them, I have a better idea.

767
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:15,551
One day to go, one day to come back and one full day there. What do you say?

768
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:17,506
I feel frightened sir.

769
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:20,171
Did I say to do anything?

770
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:24,452
That you do not do anything sir.

771
01:00:26,147 --> 01:00:27,739
Oh my, she is faster than me.

772
01:00:41,662 --> 01:00:44,174
Everyone and even the scholars

773
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,873
Will fly once they have a lady is look

774
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:53,629
In a trance, in a trance, in a trance

775
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:59,621
Everyone and even the scholars

776
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:03,252
Will fly once they have a lady is look

777
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:08,908
In a trance, in a trance, in a trance

778
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:32,163
Baby with a glow in her body

779
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:39,551
The one with shining like a fish is not normal

780
01:01:40,919 --> 01:01:45,439
Baby with a glow in her body

781
01:01:47,198 --> 01:01:52,788
The one with shining like a fish is not normal

782
01:01:54,163 --> 01:01:57,128
Do not know whom would she be trapped by

783
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:03,139
In a trance, in a trance, in a trance

784
01:02:30,004 --> 01:02:30,555
Sir!

785
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:31,499
Tell me.

786
01:02:32,602 --> 01:02:33,163
what are you doing Sir?

787
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:35,695
Nothing much... was little busy.

788
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:37,585
What work will you have Sir?

789
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:40,179
Hey... Do not hurt my ego.

790
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:42,181
Is there anyone beside you Sir?

791
01:02:43,737 --> 01:02:44,189
Hmm...

792
01:02:44,934 --> 01:02:46,232
Why do you not come aside then?

793
01:02:50,503 --> 01:02:54,153
Okay fine. I drop! You may continue playing.

794
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:09,868
Son!

795
01:03:10,314 --> 01:03:10,762
One minute.

796
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:11,839
Please be seated for two minutes.

797
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:45,347
Son!

798
01:03:46,229 --> 01:03:47,476
May I speak to you for two minutes?

799
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:49,902
I am going outside... will meet you after returning!

800
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:12,476
How many times?

801
01:04:16,707 --> 01:04:17,986
How many people should I ask?

802
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,318
A man is missing here...

803
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,170
And there is no one who cares about it.

804
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,189
Who is it Mother?

805
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:47,412
His name is Venkateshwarlu!

806
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:53,756
What sir? Are you here to prove that good policemen still exists!

807
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,745
It is because of money... Please be careful!

808
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:04,004
He is missing since November 21st. Would you please help me by finding him.

809
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:08,402
I am not here to help you...

810
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:13,366
I am here to make Justice!

811
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:17,364
Reddy! - Sir!

812
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,529
I need Venkateshwarlu is file.

813
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:25,103
Sir!

814
01:05:29,952 --> 01:05:31,177
Get the call list. - Yes Sir!

815
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:43,064
Sir! Call list.

816
01:05:52,222 --> 01:05:52,803
Do you know him?

817
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:57,712
Yes. He came to our bank 2 months ago...

818
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:02,073
I tried a lot... But...

819
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:03,370
What happened?

820
01:06:04,034 --> 01:06:05,668
I do not mean it otherwise sir...

821
01:06:06,902 --> 01:06:15,229
As you know how we treat Policemen! & their work is only done if they have a strong background.

822
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:25,930
You have received many calls from November 16th to 21st! Regarding what?

823
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:28,014
He used to call for money Sir!

824
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:29,194
Did you give?

825
01:06:30,151 --> 01:06:34,608
No sir! He used to ask to clear his debts.

826
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:37,325
Did he accept bribes anytime?

827
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:46,688
No sir... he was sincere & stubborn. I too offered him once for settling an issue. And yet he did not accept!

828
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:51,801
You may leave!

829
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:01,399
Hello! - Mother! It is me Rana.

830
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:02,726
Yes son... tell me.

831
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:05,482
Were you in need of money mother?

832
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:08,080
No son... I do not think so.

833
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:13,252
Son... Did you get to know about him?

834
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,196
Not yet... Mother!

835
01:07:16,773 --> 01:07:19,851
There is no need of money at home... & yet he roamed for money.

836
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:22,002
But why?

837
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,971
He started roaming for money since November 16th...

838
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:29,948
I am sure that something may have happened in a week.

839
01:07:31,036 --> 01:07:31,508
Sir... tea!

840
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,001
Reddy! - Sir!

841
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:45,357
I need each & every detail of a week before from November 21st.

842
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:50,235
Sir! Chief Minister was here on 13th... & we all were at his security.

843
01:07:51,753 --> 01:07:52,401
Who was at the station then?

844
01:07:53,056 --> 01:07:55,045
Mr Venkateshwarlu & one more Constable Shekhar.

845
01:07:56,432 --> 01:07:57,914
Where is he? - He is at leave Sir.

846
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:02,528
I need him at any cost! - Yes Sir!

847
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:29,422
Is it Okay to sit in a temple after committing crimes?

848
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:38,605
Look!

849
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:44,388
Nor I have time or patience.

850
01:08:45,912 --> 01:08:46,375
What happened?

851
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:53,236
On that day. Me & Mr Venkateshwarlu were at the station...

852
01:08:54,996 --> 01:08:56,964
Will you write it? Will you write it again?

853
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:00,345
You are going to die with my hands!

854
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:05,347
Will you write?

855
01:09:07,053 --> 01:09:07,803
If you write it again...

856
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:23,417
Hey! Get me a tea. - Okay Sir.

857
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:35,979
Shall I order a tea for you as well?

858
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:40,380
His pen may be strong... But not his back.

859
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,420
Why are you scared?

860
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:50,092
And what is this? He died just for 4 beatings?

861
01:09:51,678 --> 01:09:54,379
That is Okay! Shift him to the hospital saying he got Fits disease.

862
01:09:59,892 --> 01:10:01,614
Hello! Is it government hospital?

863
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:06,699
I am talking from the Rural Police Station! Please send an ambulance immediately!

864
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:13,998
Anyways! How come you guys killed him?

865
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:15,792
How come we killed him Sir?

866
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:17,868
You & he are in the station...

867
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,209
And the person who died is in the cell... How am I related to this?

868
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,831
Anyways I was providing security to the Chief Minister!

869
01:10:27,419 --> 01:10:28,379
But you are the one who killed him Sir.

870
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,874
Only you & I know this... And not any other.

871
01:10:33,505 --> 01:10:36,697
If you give me a bundle of red notes. I may help you out.

872
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:39,189
I live depending on my salary Sir.

873
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:43,422
That is why I am telling you... If not there will be a case on you!

874
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:47,029
I cannot give you any money Sir.

875
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:50,255
I am not asking you... I am ordering you!

876
01:10:51,176 --> 01:10:51,780
Give me money!

877
01:10:53,539 --> 01:11:01,164
Since then I have been roaming here & there like a beggar Sir.

878
01:11:04,188 --> 01:11:04,672
And what about him?

879
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:09,328
He was scared to lose his job & family Sir...

880
01:11:11,035 --> 01:11:15,013
I did not see him after that Sir! He was a very respectful person Sir.

881
01:11:18,227 --> 01:11:19,128
When did you see him last?

882
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:20,857
November 21!

883
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:25,051
November 22 is my joining date...

884
01:11:26,593 --> 01:11:27,913
That means... I am the one who met him last!

885
01:11:30,897 --> 01:11:32,967
I shall leave... my station is here.

886
01:11:42,022 --> 01:11:42,487
Do you know him?

887
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:44,964
Give me the file of missing people... - Sir.... - Give it!

888
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:46,638
I do not know anything.

889
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,875
He is missing since November 22nd... Is there any case filed against him?

890
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:54,477
Many people come & go! How come I will know anything!

891
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:58,491
Is he a small kid to miss like that? Just leave. - Sir!

892
01:11:59,642 --> 01:12:02,564
There are two bodies reported on November 23rd... One is identified & the other is not!

893
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:12,981
Do not you recognize this body?

894
01:13:13,574 --> 01:13:18,529
I do not know anything Sir! That day I have been informed a death of a policemen by a man..

895
01:13:19,097 --> 01:13:23,064
I have also informed this to C.I. Sir! As there will be a case filed for this...

896
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:28,123
He burned the uniform & made the body Unidentified Sir!

897
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:29,918
That is it Sir!

898
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:36,904
Sir!

899
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,692
He did find some money.. & yet he did not utilize it!

900
01:13:48,695 --> 01:13:53,981
People say requirements are more important than needs & wishes...

901
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:07,142
I did not do anything special since I have joined the duty...

902
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,691
I want to do something... At least once!

903
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:13,792
Sir! Why for us?

904
01:14:17,557 --> 01:14:18,989
Where can I find him?

905
01:14:38,255 --> 01:14:39,838
Policemen are not allowed inside!

906
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:13,926
You got to know?

907
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:24,116
The one who did, who died was a Police... And the one who came is a police too!

908
01:15:25,152 --> 01:15:25,951
Close this case!

909
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:27,503
I am saying the same...

910
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:32,416
You are a Police... He was a Police... & the one who is punishing you is a Police too!

911
01:17:15,258 --> 01:17:16,202
Brother! Is he dead?

912
01:17:17,593 --> 01:17:18,044
Yes... he died!

913
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:44,117
What is this brother? His death is very comical.

914
01:17:44,844 --> 01:17:48,141
Do you believe that he died in an accident?

915
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,045
I doubt it my brother.

916
01:17:51,644 --> 01:17:52,499
Your doubt is true

917
01:17:56,669 --> 01:17:57,318
Brother!

918
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:04,044
He will be out by bail if I arrest him & I will be in trouble if I kill him...

919
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:06,405
And what if an ambulance hits him?

920
01:18:07,492 --> 01:18:10,364
That is correct brother! But what if I say this to my brother?

921
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:11,772
What will you say?

922
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:14,348
That you have killed him!

923
01:18:15,645 --> 01:18:16,348
And who told you this?

924
01:18:16,877 --> 01:18:17,483
I will say your name.

925
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,003
Is this trustable?

926
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:21,076
No Brother!

927
01:18:21,867 --> 01:18:24,036
Anyhow I am relaxed now.... And that is why I shared it with you.

928
01:18:25,004 --> 01:18:26,676
Why are you giving this facility to me?

929
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:29,644
Who knows? I just saw you... & just told you.

930
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:34,477
But whom should I share this with?

931
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:38,572
You may tell to that mad guy! Remove his ear machine aside & just keep repeating.

932
01:18:41,741 --> 01:18:42,283
See you later!

933
01:18:43,788 --> 01:18:45,199
Okay brother! Okay!

934
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:46,937
The vehicle is coming Sir.

935
01:18:47,704 --> 01:18:49,136
Big brother! He is the guy Rana!

936
01:19:02,456 --> 01:19:04,968
Asuragana Durga prasad! I do social service!

937
01:19:07,856 --> 01:19:11,128
I heard a lot about you... And I am proud of you!

938
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:14,608
I will do justice to his family.

939
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,265
Your talent! & your sharpness!

940
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:25,224
Should not get wasted in this small town.

941
01:19:27,504 --> 01:19:32,344
Just tell me where you want to be transferred to? Hyderabad? Vizag?

942
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:33,840
Hey Krishna!

943
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,552
Speak for his transfer orders!

944
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,104
Just 10 Lakhs! & I will take care of the rest.

945
01:19:42,832 --> 01:19:43,944
I will give 20 Lakhs and stop it anyhow!

946
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:50,168
So You will not go!

947
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,479
Krishna! The kid is not ready for the transfer.

948
01:19:59,783 --> 01:20:00,280
Brother!

949
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:11,024
This is a small town... Here no one knows what may happen...

950
01:20:12,728 --> 01:20:13,432
What if anything happens to you?

951
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:15,544
I cannot tolerate it.

952
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:19,528
If anything happens to me.... Are not you there for me? Big brother?

953
01:20:21,152 --> 01:20:21,943
What is that you liked here?

954
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:25,273
You!

955
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:31,529
Krishna!

956
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:33,120
Get the vehicle!

957
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:48,072
Brother! It is pleasure to pee in open air.

958
01:20:52,216 --> 01:20:55,566
Brother Krishna! At least let us pee with peace!

959
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:57,920
What Big brother? How come you let him go today?

960
01:20:58,999 --> 01:21:01,392
You just order me... I will finish him!

961
01:21:04,472 --> 01:21:07,752
Brother Krishna! Did you ever give a close look to an ambulance?

962
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:09,976
I hope you did not.

963
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,328
Brother!

964
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:21,232
You must control some! You must defeat some! And you must teach lessons to some!

965
01:21:26,928 --> 01:21:27,577
Go on then!

966
01:21:29,808 --> 01:21:32,473
Brother! Give me some water to wash my shirt!

967
01:21:41,531 --> 01:21:43,251
Hey! Why did you cut my phone?

968
01:21:44,596 --> 01:21:45,988
Tell me? Why did you cut my call?

969
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:47,755
Actually I was busy.

970
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:49,956
Why are you laughing now?

971
01:21:51,379 --> 01:21:51,891
I just got free!

972
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:55,396
If so... why did you not call me then? - Actually that...

973
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:56,947
Go now!

974
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:05,747
Why are you being so harsh? It was better when you used to call me as Sir!

975
01:22:06,579 --> 01:22:08,179
Please do not shout!

976
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:13,195
That is all till you guys propose us! Later it is all in our control.

977
01:22:15,051 --> 01:22:16,060
If this repeats....

978
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:24,220
Look even if you are dying.... Give me a call & only then die!

979
01:22:26,086 --> 01:22:26,882
Never tell me that you are busy!

980
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:29,184
Sir! The vehicle is ready! - He is gone!

981
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:30,704
Is he your fan?

982
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:33,054
I will come later!

983
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:34,389
Wait!

984
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:35,434
Madame!

985
01:22:35,886 --> 01:22:36,897
Tell me your number!

986
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,058
What for... Madame?

987
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,766
If he will not answer my call... I will call you instead!

988
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:46,791
And if you start telling me stories...

989
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:49,688
I will tell my father that you are teasing me!

990
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:50,916
Madame!

991
01:22:52,548 --> 01:22:54,084
You guys are busy right! You may go!

992
01:22:54,877 --> 01:22:55,561
Come Sir!

993
01:22:58,344 --> 01:23:00,927
Reddy! It is pleasure riding without traffic signals.

994
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:02,720
Sir!

995
01:23:03,264 --> 01:23:04,784
Madame looks very violent Sir! - Reddy!!

996
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:05,636
Sir!

997
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:07,666
Why do you think... what I do not think?

998
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:09,057
Sorry Sir!

999
01:23:12,106 --> 01:23:12,649
Reddy... Stop the vehicle!

1000
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,033
Salutes!

1001
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:17,413
Hey kid where you going? - To home.

1002
01:23:17,978 --> 01:23:19,547
This is the way to go to our village.

1003
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:20,822
Get inside!

1004
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:24,812
What do you do Old man?

1005
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,707
I work for Durga Prasad.

1006
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:29,159
How much do you earn?

1007
01:23:29,774 --> 01:23:31,979
I will take whatever they give.

1008
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,141
Not how much you deserve for?

1009
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:38,914
You are speaking like my son!

1010
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,558
Anyone speaks this way itself... not just your son.

1011
01:23:44,295 --> 01:23:47,183
Hey kid! Your grandfather is correct... you stop roaming with him.

1012
01:23:48,422 --> 01:23:50,655
Son!.. Please stop the vehicle here.

1013
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:21,577
Your name is Suvarnalatha! Which means...

1014
01:24:22,075 --> 01:24:22,947
Brother! Silk!

1015
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,100
Sorry brother!

1016
01:24:24,762 --> 01:24:25,882
Brother! Brother! Brother!

1017
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:26,952
Why are you here?

1018
01:24:31,514 --> 01:24:36,681
Toyota Innova! It is 20 lakhs in the market... But it is free for you!

1019
01:24:41,635 --> 01:24:50,618
Brother! Bucket seats... AC is too good... It goes 120 Kmph... & it is free for you!

1020
01:24:55,998 --> 01:24:57,963
What brother! Is there any lion in the station?

1021
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:01,066
Why did he come here again..?

1022
01:25:01,732 --> 01:25:05,901
As you completed the case for first time... Dad has sent you a gift.

1023
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:19,613
Suvarnalatha! I have also got swift desire... & it is free for you.

1024
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:20,951
Hey silk!

1025
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:21,832
Coming brother!

1026
01:25:23,056 --> 01:25:30,822
Brother! I have convinced my brother & bought you this.. It is very thrilling brother!

1027
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:32,159
Boss!

1028
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:43,439
Oh my goodness! Porsche Carrera!

1029
01:25:49,741 --> 01:25:54,545
Not just me! Even my brother is father will not be able to get this!

1030
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:56,414
Brother!

1031
01:25:57,202 --> 01:26:04,308
I have got some English girlfriends... May I please borrow this for an hour for a ride?

1032
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:07,093
Lets see!

1033
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:08,423
I love you brother!

1034
01:26:09,352 --> 01:26:10,323
Hey Reddy! - Sir!

1035
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:14,990
How come that easily they give a 20 lakhs car? What do they do?

1036
01:26:16,397 --> 01:26:18,930
Sir! Even the newspaper would not be enough to write about you sir!

1037
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:20,491
What are you guys doing?

1038
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,165
We have been collecting bribes as usual Sir.

1039
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:24,380
Are not you ashamed of saying that?

1040
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:29,611
As you have a sports car... You did not accept that Innova car... Whereas how do we fulfil our wishes?

1041
01:26:30,496 --> 01:26:31,064
Are not you getting your salaries?

1042
01:26:32,076 --> 01:26:33,850
Do not mind Sir... How much do you think your salary is?

1043
01:26:34,635 --> 01:26:36,216
Probably around 50 to 60 thousand!

1044
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:41,177
I guess you have never seen your salary slip... Yours is 14500 Rs & mine is 8800 Rs.

1045
01:26:42,056 --> 01:26:45,796
For just this... why a baton? A cap? & a designation called SP!

1046
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:47,170
Sir! What are you saying?

1047
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:53,363
Wait for tomorrow!

1048
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:57,922
Hey! Where are you going? - They have asked us to come!

1049
01:27:00,731 --> 01:27:02,955
Big Brother Giri! It is Police.

1050
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:04,474
Why have you come here?

1051
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:09,095
Our Sir asked us to collect funds to teach lessons for the crooks!

1052
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:11,236
Hey! Do you realise what you are speaking & to whom?

1053
01:27:11,676 --> 01:27:14,639
Brother! It is not for us... it is for the crooks!

1054
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,733
Are not we politicians? Big brother!

1055
01:27:23,216 --> 01:27:24,345
Give them 10000 bucks & ask them to leave!

1056
01:27:24,892 --> 01:27:27,663
But our Sir have told us not to accept more than 500 Rs!

1057
01:27:30,607 --> 01:27:32,222
Looks like they are fixed on something... Big Brother!

1058
01:27:37,477 --> 01:27:38,013
Give them what they ask!

1059
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:45,532
Did you call me?

1060
01:27:46,379 --> 01:27:48,508
Are you a Police or a Rowdy?

1061
01:27:49,707 --> 01:27:50,580
I heard that you are collecting bribes!

1062
01:27:52,992 --> 01:27:54,289
You are insulting the police!

1063
01:27:56,377 --> 01:27:58,424
I am watching! Do not think that I am not!

1064
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,343
You think yourself as Hero... by just solving one case!

1065
01:28:03,183 --> 01:28:06,411
I can suspend you right away! And no one can stop me!

1066
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:13,835
Hello! - Sir! Sir!

1067
01:28:16,418 --> 01:28:16,995
He is here Sir.

1068
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:20,371
Nothing as such Sir! Okay sir!

1069
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:22,346
As you say Sir.

1070
01:28:25,618 --> 01:28:26,786
I am here with preparation!

1071
01:28:32,964 --> 01:28:37,783
Look! When I came here I thought only you are my problem...

1072
01:28:39,284 --> 01:28:43,441
And after coming here... have realized there is even more!

1073
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:47,784
That is why... It is better if we mind our own business!

1074
01:28:57,154 --> 01:28:59,205
Mahatma Gandhi has told this in 1950 itself...

1075
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,791
Policemen are paid very less! If possible work on this.

1076
01:29:06,975 --> 01:29:15,357
Sir! I appreciate your memory Sir... You are too good Sir.

1077
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:16,893
Reddy! - Sir!

1078
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:21,977
Gandhi was died before 1950! - Sir! How come he did not notice it?

1079
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:24,143
I think his general knowledge is poor! - Oh!

1080
01:29:25,464 --> 01:29:29,192
One more doubt sir... You could have said it by yourself... Why did you involve Gandhi Sir?

1081
01:29:31,188 --> 01:29:37,937
It is better if we say good words in the name of great people... If not...Who will listen to us?

1082
01:29:38,483 --> 01:29:43,075
It makes sense Sir... I have learned a lot Sir! Feel like drinking something cool Sir. – Let us go!

1083
01:29:51,378 --> 01:29:52,705
Did you warn my father through D.G.P.?

1084
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,299
Did he tell you that? - Did you do it or not?

1085
01:29:56,803 --> 01:29:59,709
Does he tell everything at home like a small girl?

1086
01:30:00,558 --> 01:30:04,178
Nothing as such! He said it to my mother & she told me.

1087
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:09,515
Why do not you support me? Like how your mother does to your father!

1088
01:30:12,477 --> 01:30:19,952
That is why I did not hit you yet! You say that you like me... & not my father... What logic is this?

1089
01:30:21,762 --> 01:30:26,650
Darling! Everybody hates white people, & yet we use roads made by them...

1090
01:30:27,435 --> 01:30:32,574
And people like your father sit in the buildings made by them... Here products are more important than persons!

1091
01:30:34,836 --> 01:30:35,796
What are you so pride for?

1092
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:39,616
Instead... You may ask what I love you for!

1093
01:30:45,475 --> 01:30:48,509
Who asked her to do all this non- sense? - Brother Silk!

1094
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:50,892
The girl have asked you to come upstairs.

1095
01:30:52,108 --> 01:30:54,241
But why will she ask me to come upstairs? - Brother! Brother!

1096
01:30:54,862 --> 01:30:56,508
The girl donated your theatre to some one!

1097
01:30:57,196 --> 01:31:00,459
Oh my goodness! Whose theatre did she give to whom?

1098
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:02,840
Is it the time to ask all these? Just go!

1099
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:07,751
Unnecessarily I am dependent on you! - How come she does this? - Now there is nothing left with you!

1100
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,041
Do you think that is your father is theatre?

1101
01:31:11,105 --> 01:31:12,551
How come you are here Mr. Silk?

1102
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:23,744
He might have told you everything! I would like to release my movies as well.

1103
01:31:24,303 --> 01:31:29,314
Is it your father is property to do anything? Do one thing... put an AC as well & sleep!

1104
01:31:36,111 --> 01:31:38,984
What is this? Do not he know anything apart from this?

1105
01:31:46,819 --> 01:31:48,332
Sir! I have completed collecting funds.

1106
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:51,434
Ask everyone to get inside once!

1107
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:52,635
Sir!

1108
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:12,028
In India.. Currency is given more value than Gandhi is words.

1109
01:32:14,027 --> 01:32:14,907
That is why I did this.

1110
01:32:15,706 --> 01:32:20,683
This is people is money, Here people do not like us & our work too!

1111
01:32:21,395 --> 01:32:23,955
There is just one thing... Fear!

1112
01:32:25,515 --> 01:32:29,604
Even now they got the money out of fear. If possible let is remove the fear in them.

1113
01:32:32,091 --> 01:32:32,924
Does anyone has any doubts?

1114
01:32:33,643 --> 01:32:40,092
Sir! You are wealthy too... You could have done it by yourself... Why collecting money from people?

1115
01:32:42,531 --> 01:32:48,083
Just by giving 100 Rs for Ganesh Chaturthi we ask when, where and how?

1116
01:32:48,867 --> 01:32:51,947
We too know that nothing happens with our 100 Rs.

1117
01:32:53,187 --> 01:32:54,331
But we feel that as our right

1118
01:32:55,179 --> 01:33:01,283
People assume we do everything by ourselves... & if we take money from them... They will keep an eye on us.

1119
01:33:01,843 --> 01:33:03,659
From today no one is going to stretch hands for money!

1120
01:33:05,123 --> 01:33:06,923
No single illegal activity should take place!

1121
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:10,627
From now every individual salary is 50000 Rs!

1122
01:33:13,236 --> 01:33:14,091
Blast on from now!

1123
01:33:15,059 --> 01:33:15,475
Yes sir!

1124
01:33:57,219 --> 01:33:58,707
Bro, he is closing down our belt shop

1125
01:34:18,338 --> 01:34:20,474
Bro in law, brother is been arrested

1126
01:34:29,675 --> 01:34:31,594
Kolleru is a very sensitive area.

1127
01:34:32,371 --> 01:34:33,794
High command is arriving tomorrow from Delhi.

1128
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:36,219
No incidents should take place tomorrow at any cost

1129
01:34:36,883 --> 01:34:41,227
Rana that is your area. You must look after it. Careful.

1130
01:34:50,475 --> 01:34:51,011
Who is that?

1131
01:35:10,107 --> 01:35:12,042
What bro, sitting and drinking alone?

1132
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:16,411
Sit.

1133
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,050
Why have you arrested my brother?

1134
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:30,012
Bro, Is this personal or professional time?

1135
01:35:33,707 --> 01:35:34,195
Personal.

1136
01:35:35,987 --> 01:35:37,379
Then, do not speak about professional matters.

1137
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:41,075
I am tired out with duties of the entire week.

1138
01:35:46,355 --> 01:35:47,635
Still, why did you leave him free like that?

1139
01:35:48,955 --> 01:35:49,771
Why did not you get him married?

1140
01:35:50,419 --> 01:35:57,594
Where man? No time for family being busy in public service.

1141
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:05,443
That is it, it seems your concentration has become more on public.

1142
01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:08,571
Better to bring it down.

1143
01:36:12,552 --> 01:36:16,671
Not one or two, I am habituated for the past 30 years

1144
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:23,033
I cannot stop doing it... Public service!

1145
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:26,631
Your Public service is your wish.

1146
01:36:28,111 --> 01:36:32,849
Why I came here was, there is some important meeting for you tomorrow.

1147
01:36:34,565 --> 01:36:39,113
It seems someone is here from high command, I am not doing my duty tomorrow.

1148
01:36:42,258 --> 01:36:43,411
I will not let anyone else also do.

1149
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,876
Still why is that SP fellow saying me bro?

1150
01:36:50,578 --> 01:36:51,111
Should he not tell?

1151
01:36:55,426 --> 01:37:02,805
Should say to animals, should ask humans and request... people like me!

1152
01:37:04,909 --> 01:37:05,520
He should know that.

1153
01:37:06,991 --> 01:37:08,637
Why to talk with him bro, rather kill him!

1154
01:37:09,923 --> 01:37:10,390
Kill me!

1155
01:37:10,981 --> 01:37:11,580
Brother!

1156
01:37:12,028 --> 01:37:12,480
Kill me!

1157
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,471
Brother!

1158
01:37:13,948 --> 01:37:14,563
Kill me!

1159
01:37:15,355 --> 01:37:16,237
You just say yes bro!

1160
01:37:17,085 --> 01:37:17,535
Kill me!

1161
01:37:17,962 --> 01:37:18,583
Just say yes bro!

1162
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:24,536
They are drunk, leave it.

1163
01:37:25,445 --> 01:37:28,621
I will leave, your brother.

1164
01:37:32,177 --> 01:37:32,738
Good!

1165
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:45,662
Ranapratap Jaidev, public servant! Krishna, be careful.

1166
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:59,097
By whose name is this land so happy and fish jump in joy from ponds?

1167
01:37:59,653 --> 01:38:09,456
He is the brother of Damu, cool going, obedient Durga Prasad.

1168
01:38:10,432 --> 01:38:12,124
He is reaching the stage in some time.

1169
01:38:13,191 --> 01:38:15,561
Let us welcome him heartily with our claps.

1170
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:16,785
Grandpa, lift me up!

1171
01:38:18,218 --> 01:38:22,646
Damodar Prasad is the great human seeing lady as mom & sister.

1172
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:26,719
Giri, ask all to hold garlands and sit quietly.

1173
01:38:27,615 --> 01:38:29,857
Say will be dead if they open their mouth.

1174
01:38:30,557 --> 01:38:30,956
Ok brother!

1175
01:38:33,147 --> 01:38:41,210
Hey, you should shout and that should be heard to the one arriving.

1176
01:38:42,476 --> 01:38:45,368
That should be only “hail Durga Prasad”

1177
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:50,732
If someone shouts anything else about your lives...

1178
01:38:51,655 --> 01:38:53,777
You know what happened to those already shouted throats.

1179
01:38:56,243 --> 01:38:56,751
How is the village sir?

1180
01:39:01,335 --> 01:39:05,849
It is shining like the fresh fish coming in sir.

1181
01:39:11,077 --> 01:39:15,193
Ministry this time is confirmed, right sir?

1182
01:39:15,952 --> 01:39:19,464
When it is so peaceful, who else would get than you sir?

1183
01:39:42,513 --> 01:39:44,365
Looks like CRPF is in as you said no to duty sir.

1184
01:39:47,207 --> 01:39:47,937
Sir, tea!

1185
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,762
If anyone opens their mouth, will kill them.

1186
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:54,112
Go!

1187
01:39:57,197 --> 01:39:58,387
If anyone opens their mouth, will not go back home.

1188
01:39:59,947 --> 01:40:00,443
Hey old man, go and sit.

1189
01:40:02,755 --> 01:40:03,161
Hey!

1190
01:40:13,394 --> 01:40:15,431
It is so here, we hit when mistake happens.

1191
01:40:19,384 --> 01:40:21,867
It is same at my place, we hit even without mistake.

1192
01:40:22,015 --> 01:40:22,535
Hey!

1193
01:40:22,932 --> 01:40:23,284
Giri!

1194
01:40:37,193 --> 01:40:38,303
Hail Praja Party!

1195
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:40,083
Hail Praja Party!

1196
01:40:41,177 --> 01:40:42,117
Hail Praja Party!

1197
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,002
Hail Praja Party!

1198
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:45,918
Hail Praja Party!

1199
01:40:46,687 --> 01:40:47,857
Hail Praja Party!

1200
01:40:48,636 --> 01:40:49,962
Hail Praja Party!

1201
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:54,610
Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad!

1202
01:40:55,586 --> 01:40:56,611
Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad!

1203
01:40:58,146 --> 01:40:59,882
Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad!

1204
01:41:33,137 --> 01:41:33,671
Charge!

1205
01:41:43,136 --> 01:41:46,909
Where is the unsolved issue?

1206
01:41:48,081 --> 01:41:51,939
What is the whirl wind saying?

1207
01:42:02,963 --> 01:42:06,809
Where is the unsolved issue?

1208
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:11,650
What is the whirl wind saying?

1209
01:42:12,864 --> 01:42:21,321
Who breaks the shackles unseen?

1210
01:42:22,666 --> 01:42:32,028
What even if the eyes like glass, open?

1211
01:42:42,704 --> 01:42:51,470
Who breaks the shackles unseen?

1212
01:42:52,541 --> 01:43:01,826
What even if the eyes like glass, open?

1213
01:43:50,082 --> 01:43:50,626
Brother!

1214
01:43:51,169 --> 01:43:51,602
What is he saying?

1215
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:52,594
Stop bro.

1216
01:43:53,057 --> 01:43:53,410
What is he saying?

1217
01:43:54,884 --> 01:43:55,284
You stop bro.

1218
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:57,018
What is he saying? Will he give or not?

1219
01:43:57,450 --> 01:43:57,930
Stop bro.

1220
01:43:58,346 --> 01:43:58,906
Will he give or not?

1221
01:44:01,465 --> 01:44:01,970
We shall talk.

1222
01:44:15,698 --> 01:44:16,289
My village is great...

1223
01:44:17,426 --> 01:44:20,074
It lives away from self-respect and close to insults...

1224
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,202
Every time I see it, I remember just one thing...

1225
01:44:24,098 --> 01:44:26,513
Why God gives hunger to all does not give food to all?

1226
01:44:27,866 --> 01:44:30,242
When god can teach us to live... But has not given dare to all?

1227
01:44:31,387 --> 01:44:34,626
When not heard by crying and shouting, every time reminded to be alive...

1228
01:44:35,866 --> 01:44:39,025
All letters gave one name, Asuragana Durga Prasad.

1229
01:44:39,945 --> 01:44:42,041
Will stamp down if asked, will kill when shouted...

1230
01:44:43,354 --> 01:44:46,666
No proofs for the crimes in the presence of Kolleru.

1231
01:44:47,641 --> 01:44:50,377
There is one thing above all these truths, lies and proofs...

1232
01:44:51,506 --> 01:44:55,506
Freedom! As my village does not have it, I named my daughter so.

1233
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:05,026
At bright sunny day, the name I have been listening to...

1234
01:45:06,257 --> 01:45:08,497
The name that threatened the village, I met him.

1235
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:11,386
You are trying to know more than required about me.

1236
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:12,689
My work is to know.

1237
01:45:13,682 --> 01:45:16,058
Still whales do not fall to the fishing nets.

1238
01:45:17,738 --> 01:45:19,730
You may threaten humans, but not the letters.

1239
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:24,178
Lives should not be written on papers.

1240
01:45:27,835 --> 01:45:28,374
Go!

1241
01:45:31,677 --> 01:45:36,117
I understood then that human with greed is more dangerous than hungry animal.

1242
01:45:37,309 --> 01:45:41,749
Same night, in the witness of Gandhi my complaint given... was torn.

1243
01:45:43,145 --> 01:45:46,020
Many insults after that, most unforgettable from it was

1244
01:45:47,125 --> 01:45:50,763
when Damu slapped me in front of my six year old daughter... I said we are playing!

1245
01:45:52,578 --> 01:45:54,338
Every dad wishes to show up great to their children.

1246
01:45:55,442 --> 01:45:57,781
May be this is why... I could not tell my daughter.

1247
01:45:59,075 --> 01:46:00,331
Why to fight with them, my son!

1248
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,983
How many days more like this dad?

1249
01:46:02,616 --> 01:46:04,235
What how many days? It is till the day we live.

1250
01:46:06,395 --> 01:46:08,884
He is writing and we are just seeing!

1251
01:46:14,715 --> 01:46:17,977
Gandhi wet in sweat used to come home every now and then..

1252
01:46:20,476 --> 01:46:21,184
How much did he pay dad?

1253
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,953
It is better we take what they give.

1254
01:46:25,846 --> 01:46:26,760
They should pay as much we demand, right?

1255
01:46:29,017 --> 01:46:32,632
You were given education, not to better our lives...

1256
01:46:33,604 --> 01:46:34,867
It is for at least you to live happily.

1257
01:46:36,106 --> 01:46:37,244
Who stands blocking our lives dad?

1258
01:46:39,057 --> 01:46:41,254
Even I was as daring as you in my childhood...

1259
01:46:42,054 --> 01:46:44,172
But for that to melt down, it took so much age...

1260
01:46:46,101 --> 01:46:49,129
Police had come for you, go once to the station. Go!

1261
01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:55,950
The night journalist went to station...

1262
01:47:08,688 --> 01:47:09,381
Will it be a risk?

1263
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:14,815
It is a journalist, will have to shut many voices.

1264
01:47:16,373 --> 01:47:16,940
What shall we do?

1265
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:24,908
One happens for 5 and the other for 10. But the work would be done.

1266
01:47:49,815 --> 01:47:53,635
You have the dare to throw stone, but why are you not giving complaint?

1267
01:47:59,006 --> 01:48:02,080
When I saw him, I remembered my son...

1268
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:07,342
After they started hitting, his daughter came to my mind...

1269
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:15,125
I can live without freedom but not without this kid.

1270
01:48:17,014 --> 01:48:17,782
I ca not!

1271
01:48:24,553 --> 01:48:28,719
The silence of dumb is one type and that of the poor is different type

1272
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:35,113
Dumb cannot say as he cannot, but the poor cannot even knowing it all.

1273
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:58,514
What is he, when someone hit before his kid says he is playing?

1274
01:49:01,429 --> 01:49:02,312
I am not feeling good, Reddy!

1275
01:49:12,711 --> 01:49:13,767
He is Silk, right?

1276
01:49:15,974 --> 01:49:16,485
Yes sir!

1277
01:49:17,237 --> 01:49:17,709
Call him.

1278
01:49:18,309 --> 01:49:18,908
Hey!

1279
01:49:21,828 --> 01:49:22,317
Come here.

1280
01:49:23,212 --> 01:49:26,020
No, I am caught to bro. Catch the cycle.

1281
01:49:26,988 --> 01:49:27,419
Come here!

1282
01:49:34,866 --> 01:49:35,440
Why have you called bro?

1283
01:49:40,547 --> 01:49:41,412
What your people do is wrong! Is not it?

1284
01:49:42,146 --> 01:49:42,642
May be bro!

1285
01:49:43,322 --> 01:49:44,975
What may be? Do not you know?

1286
01:49:45,726 --> 01:49:46,344
I may be knowing bro.

1287
01:49:47,056 --> 01:49:47,990
Do you know or not?

1288
01:49:48,526 --> 01:49:53,200
Bro, let me say frankly. Even my bro is about to become Minister.

1289
01:49:54,016 --> 01:49:55,632
My uncle is CM, so what?

1290
01:49:57,756 --> 01:49:58,244
Reddy!

1291
01:49:59,101 --> 01:49:59,508
Sorry sir.

1292
01:50:01,422 --> 01:50:04,889
If you do extras, Ambulance would come even here

1293
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:09,730
Bro, mother promise. My bro is a big rascal.

1294
01:50:11,066 --> 01:50:15,722
I will change into approver bro. I will support you. Leave me.

1295
01:50:16,604 --> 01:50:17,252
Go!

1296
01:50:18,826 --> 01:50:19,322
Thank you bro.

1297
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:21,073
Carry on!

1298
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:27,777
Meet me once tomorrow

1299
01:50:29,929 --> 01:50:30,481
Okay.

1300
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:43,762
Daddy, I like this guy. I will not run away with him.

1301
01:50:48,013 --> 01:50:50,603
I know that you both have small issues.

1302
01:50:53,644 --> 01:50:56,243
Sit and speak, problems will be solved.

1303
01:50:59,136 --> 01:50:59,905
I will wait outside.

1304
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:04,104
Please manage!

1305
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:17,881
Uncle!

1306
01:51:19,181 --> 01:51:20,149
Should be ashamed to call me so.

1307
01:51:26,594 --> 01:51:27,128
BP tablet!

1308
01:51:36,013 --> 01:51:39,664
Look, do not disturb me for five minutes.

1309
01:51:40,658 --> 01:51:41,117
Okay.

1310
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:46,431
You silly!

1311
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:52,252
Hi, thought you forgot me. Why have you called me?

1312
01:51:52,785 --> 01:51:53,437
I am tensed.

1313
01:51:54,459 --> 01:51:56,563
Did you get “F“ grade in exams? Just joking!

1314
01:51:58,079 --> 01:51:58,853
I informed dad about marriage.

1315
01:51:59,868 --> 01:52:00,309
Hey!

1316
01:52:12,117 --> 01:52:14,475
I would have come in pink shirt, if you would informed before.

1317
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:16,979
Do not know, I am very much tensed.

1318
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:22,116
I will take care, I will take care.

1319
01:52:23,088 --> 01:52:23,898
Will you go in and manage?

1320
01:52:24,987 --> 01:52:25,555
Go, go

1321
01:52:26,211 --> 01:52:26,947
Is it ok?

1322
01:52:27,515 --> 01:52:28,098
Super, super go!

1323
01:52:29,196 --> 01:52:29,597
Thank you!

1324
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,531
I am friend of Megha, uncle!

1325
01:52:36,018 --> 01:52:36,466
Why is he here?

1326
01:52:39,033 --> 01:52:40,121
Uncle looks very strong.

1327
01:52:41,538 --> 01:52:43,970
I just saw in TV yesterday that they call this pack, uncle!

1328
01:52:45,218 --> 01:52:48,481
Many waste fellows have tried uncle for stopping this.

1329
01:52:49,208 --> 01:52:51,894
But as me and Megha are strong, this has come till here.

1330
01:52:53,966 --> 01:52:55,577
Yes uncle, Gavaskar has done it all.

1331
01:52:57,274 --> 01:52:59,016
Did you know now who the idiot is and who Gavaskar is!

1332
01:53:00,556 --> 01:53:03,326
Megha told me that you get irritated for everything...

1333
01:53:04,038 --> 01:53:07,208
But you look very silent like Buddha on the tank bund

1334
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:10,632
Why does he not utter a word?

1335
01:53:11,566 --> 01:53:13,030
What now, will you say ok for marriage or not?

1336
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:16,000
Tell uncle. Is it my mistake for not telling in advance?

1337
01:53:16,606 --> 01:53:17,541
Why do you be so like a rock, say uncle, say!

1338
01:53:18,969 --> 01:53:19,386
What telling, you bloody?

1339
01:53:19,921 --> 01:53:20,305
Megha!

1340
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:21,418
Are you the pimp between these two?

1341
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:22,201
Megha!

1342
01:53:22,585 --> 01:53:23,058
Are you the pimp, idiot?

1343
01:53:23,465 --> 01:53:23,914
Daddy please!

1344
01:53:24,465 --> 01:53:25,145
Donkey, stupid!

1345
01:53:25,889 --> 01:53:26,377
Daddy, Gavaskar is like a brother to me.

1346
01:53:29,404 --> 01:53:31,137
You hit me uncle, this is better!

1347
01:53:33,545 --> 01:53:35,208
What now, are you getting us married or not?

1348
01:53:37,713 --> 01:53:43,034
Uncle, I had anger on you, But now I have love on your daughter too...

1349
01:53:43,742 --> 01:53:44,383
I will take good care uncle.

1350
01:53:44,912 --> 01:53:45,631
He will take good care dad.

1351
01:53:46,227 --> 01:53:47,065
He will really take good care uncle

1352
01:53:47,589 --> 01:53:48,138
Hey, back.

1353
01:53:48,602 --> 01:53:49,343
Uncle is like father, right?

1354
01:53:49,867 --> 01:53:53,734
Look baby, I agree for this marriage as I like you.

1355
01:53:56,853 --> 01:53:57,986
But, one condition...

1356
01:54:03,008 --> 01:54:03,840
I will not wash his feet

1357
01:54:04,959 --> 01:54:05,799
Why uncle, are we not Hindus?

1358
01:54:06,821 --> 01:54:09,707
Come here... We too will have egos!

1359
01:54:29,937 --> 01:54:35,212
You look cute like the smile of Goddess Sita

1360
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:41,212
He is Rama without Laxman and is your couple

1361
01:54:43,331 --> 01:54:48,940
Like a cute babe and like my eye ball

1362
01:54:50,267 --> 01:54:54,955
My age is remembered you like a girl in full moon

1363
01:54:56,209 --> 01:55:01,900
Somehow, you receive the love from him

1364
01:55:03,086 --> 01:55:08,730
I am the man one in thousands

1365
01:55:09,975 --> 01:55:15,468
Receive the result of your good from last births

1366
01:55:16,764 --> 01:55:22,136
Pray to feet and become his lady

1367
01:55:24,141 --> 01:55:29,862
Now is the marriage and the joy today

1368
01:55:30,877 --> 01:55:36,756
Now is the marriage and the joy today

1369
01:55:37,754 --> 01:55:43,380
Everlasting company welcomes you

1370
01:55:44,707 --> 01:55:50,026
Now is the marriage and the joy today

1371
01:55:58,813 --> 01:56:03,977
Star from sky has shined before me today

1372
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:10,905
Will the age not stay calm? It is a joy, joy and joy

1373
01:56:12,251 --> 01:56:17,770
Beauty sharing her charm is the sweet of your talks

1374
01:56:19,086 --> 01:56:24,677
Will not be calm then, it is a joy, joy and joy

1375
01:56:25,963 --> 01:56:32,085
By swinging in your lap, nothing like alone than this

1376
01:56:32,894 --> 01:56:38,442
It is a joy looking you through my eyes

1377
01:56:39,561 --> 01:56:45,096
Now is the marriage and the joy today

1378
01:57:00,504 --> 01:57:03,050
That is why we drink Red label daily!

1379
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:06,348
Hey they drink in the morning and we drink at night.

1380
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:08,521
What you drink is a cheap brand, right bro.

1381
01:57:08,693 --> 01:57:09,583
Do I drink cheap brand?

1382
01:57:09,998 --> 01:57:10,417
Shut up and eat!

1383
01:57:11,299 --> 01:57:11,996
You cheap idiot!

1384
01:57:12,711 --> 01:57:15,330
Even life has become worst like the food at home.

1385
01:57:17,852 --> 01:57:19,812
My girlfriend is settled to that SI...

1386
01:57:20,727 --> 01:57:24,594
He and SP are one now. All happened so suddenly. So sad!

1387
01:57:25,432 --> 01:57:26,632
No problem if they both become one.

1388
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,146
Problem is only when someone with us mixes with them!

1389
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:32,638
Why do you speak so? You speak as you wish...

1390
01:57:33,627 --> 01:57:36,187
Bro, you are a politician. AP is divided.

1391
01:57:37,213 --> 01:57:38,397
One is Telangana and the other is Seemandhra.

1392
01:57:38,887 --> 01:57:41,194
Will those two come along again? How will we mix up again?

1393
01:57:43,461 --> 01:57:43,975
Hello!

1394
01:57:44,088 --> 01:57:44,496
Is silk there?

1395
01:57:45,316 --> 01:57:46,107
Uncle, call for you.

1396
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:49,004
I am talking an important matter here.

1397
01:57:49,641 --> 01:57:51,101
Ask who he is and what the matter is?

1398
01:57:52,318 --> 01:57:53,984
He is asking to enquire who and what.

1399
01:57:55,062 --> 01:57:58,874
Nothing, he said to become approver. Ask when and where?

1400
01:57:59,918 --> 01:58:02,766
It seems you said to become approver to someone...

1401
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:06,837
He is asking when and where...

1402
01:58:11,264 --> 01:58:13,508
He said not to fear watching elder and younger bros.

1403
01:58:15,805 --> 01:58:16,524
He would confirmedly kill.

1404
01:58:17,824 --> 01:58:19,415
Bloody! You and your family.

1405
01:58:19,545 --> 01:58:20,169
Why does he speak so?

1406
01:58:20,777 --> 01:58:23,529
He is tall, he is short and you are black.

1407
01:58:24,094 --> 01:58:25,649
Have I ever asked about cross connections of your family?

1408
01:58:26,114 --> 01:58:28,039
You are speaking about my family. Bloody fools!

1409
01:58:28,647 --> 01:58:29,176
Looks like he felt bad.

1410
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:31,979
Brother!

1411
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:36,369
MP Durga Prasad with the hopes of Ministry is again into depression.

1412
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:41,178
Reason known is that high command is not happy about MP.

1413
01:58:42,353 --> 01:58:47,702
High command took the riot in front of their representative recently very seriously.

1414
01:58:48,512 --> 01:58:56,210
Information is that ministry is lost as he could not control the mob.

1415
01:59:25,993 --> 01:59:26,530
Where is grandpa?

1416
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:27,481
Do not know.

1417
01:59:31,234 --> 01:59:33,927
Hey, where is the old man?

1418
01:59:40,887 --> 01:59:41,489
Where is the grandpa!

1419
01:59:52,838 --> 01:59:53,441
Baby

1420
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:59,858
Sir, do not do anything to my baby...

1421
02:00:01,535 --> 02:00:04,302
I catch your feet sir, please

1422
02:02:29,594 --> 02:02:30,186
Two minutes!

1423
02:02:47,557 --> 02:02:48,181
We are playing baby

1424
02:02:49,156 --> 02:02:50,059
Are you playing?

1425
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:55,458
Be careful with the baby

1426
02:05:22,743 --> 02:05:23,935
Oh God! What is happened?

1427
02:05:24,463 --> 02:05:26,544
Madame! You go inside Madame

1428
02:05:58,624 --> 02:05:59,320
I need that guy!

1429
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:13,907
Sorry sir! Sorry sir!

1430
02:06:16,147 --> 02:06:16,947
I still have an old scooter sir!

1431
02:07:32,099 --> 02:07:33,315
How long is it been that I am kidnapped?

1432
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:34,802
One hour!

1433
02:07:36,819 --> 02:07:38,291
How long is it from there to the house of your bro in law?

1434
02:07:39,307 --> 02:07:39,739
Half an hour.

1435
02:07:41,347 --> 02:07:41,970
Di not you still understand?

1436
02:07:44,435 --> 02:07:45,539
Who kidnapped whom?

1437
02:07:54,336 --> 02:07:55,207
We are booked man!

1438
02:07:59,278 --> 02:08:00,814
Sorry boss, late by 30 minutes!

1439
02:08:31,191 --> 02:08:34,830
God promise bro, I am pissing inside bro!

1440
02:08:36,086 --> 02:08:37,247
Someone please talk bro.

1441
02:08:39,286 --> 02:08:42,086
Bro, someone please talk bro!

1442
02:09:05,016 --> 02:09:06,313
Say yes bro, I will kill that fellow!

1443
02:09:40,034 --> 02:09:46,089
I understood. Shall we sit and speak for 5 minutes?

1444
02:09:57,643 --> 02:09:58,396
Why have you actually come?

1445
02:10:03,811 --> 02:10:06,907
That SP caught my collar. That is why I came.

1446
02:10:07,564 --> 02:10:08,427
For catching the collar?

1447
02:10:11,484 --> 02:10:12,707
Why are you on me leaving him then?

1448
02:10:14,803 --> 02:10:18,305
Thought of leaving, but you stopped me.

1449
02:10:19,114 --> 02:10:21,593
When did I stop you? I asked you to leave, right?

1450
02:10:22,081 --> 02:10:24,719
I did not like that. That is why I am still here.

1451
02:10:30,532 --> 02:10:31,444
Why did you come after getting old?

1452
02:10:32,581 --> 02:10:35,988
That is why I am still speaking. Else, I would not have given even this time.

1453
02:10:36,684 --> 02:10:41,067
Hey, you have enough, why are you mad about people.

1454
02:10:43,507 --> 02:10:46,867
That is what I am saying. You and I have money.

1455
02:10:48,907 --> 02:10:49,658
Why all this still?

1456
02:10:50,395 --> 02:10:59,010
Who wants money? Even unknown stands up when we walk, I need that!

1457
02:11:00,312 --> 02:11:04,927
The opposite leaves calm even when we do wrong, I need that!

1458
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:16,886
Entire village fears of thinking what I do, I need that!

1459
02:11:19,398 --> 02:11:21,469
Need to snatch for that, & I am snatching!

1460
02:11:23,653 --> 02:11:24,773
What do you know about Kolleru?

1461
02:11:29,182 --> 02:11:33,747
I do not anything about Kolleru. A six year baby asked me once.

1462
02:11:35,309 --> 02:11:36,277
Where her father is was her question...

1463
02:11:38,011 --> 02:11:41,362
An old lady has asked where her husband was...

1464
02:11:44,042 --> 02:11:47,930
An old man has asked where justice is?

1465
02:11:51,233 --> 02:11:52,177
And I have no answers!

1466
02:11:54,704 --> 02:11:57,041
It is not this ground you are snatching, it is the people.

1467
02:11:59,184 --> 02:12:01,216
He too has to mix in this ground someday, right?

1468
02:12:03,704 --> 02:12:06,591
No problem if he goes by himself, whereas you are sending them!

1469
02:12:07,696 --> 02:12:08,840
That is the rule of the jungle!

1470
02:12:11,592 --> 02:12:14,207
There are people killing fishes & still living, Why do not you oppose them?

1471
02:12:15,487 --> 02:12:18,335
Similarly I am killing people and living, & no one must oppose me...

1472
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:28,631
I have not cried even when my brother was dead, & I am angry now...

1473
02:12:31,263 --> 02:12:36,464
You are sitting in front of me and speaking like this. Who are you?

1474
02:12:37,777 --> 02:12:39,927
Are you born or brought up here? Why do not you have fear of me?

1475
02:12:43,517 --> 02:12:47,538
Why should I? Why should a human fear of another human?

1476
02:12:47,803 --> 02:12:51,218
You should, it is not human opposite to you.

1477
02:12:52,658 --> 02:12:55,618
It is Asuragana Durga Prasad. You idiot!

1478
02:12:58,234 --> 02:13:02,866
Yes, yes! I am a young idiot.

1479
02:13:04,777 --> 02:13:06,346
I did not know what life is till I came here.

1480
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,112
I knew only after I came here.

1481
02:13:11,855 --> 02:13:15,747
Do you know how it feels when the dream of 30 years is gone?

1482
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:22,238
You know how it feels when you drive away the fear I grew here?

1483
02:13:23,236 --> 02:13:27,109
You know how it feels when you want to give away what I snatched?

1484
02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:34,077
I have no problem if you snatch 1000 more acres.

1485
02:13:39,508 --> 02:13:41,116
You should let human live... like a human!

1486
02:13:43,562 --> 02:13:47,266
At least let him live on his own. But you are snatching that!

1487
02:13:48,033 --> 02:13:49,298
What rules in snatching?

1488
02:13:49,825 --> 02:13:50,785
But why should you snatch?

1489
02:13:51,217 --> 02:13:56,122
Because there are more lame fellows here, daring like you are less and stronger like me is only me!

1490
02:13:59,722 --> 02:14:00,233
Will you not change?

1491
02:14:01,961 --> 02:14:05,689
No. Because history always remembers only the evil like me.

1492
02:14:28,133 --> 02:14:29,325
Two evils should not be here.

1493
02:14:32,333 --> 02:14:33,907
Sir, what shall we do with him?

1494
02:14:35,276 --> 02:14:38,195
I gave word to an old lady to do justice.

1495
02:14:40,459 --> 02:14:41,739
Declare as an unidentified body.

1496
02:14:43,203 --> 02:14:43,771
Ok sir!

1497
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:02,013
I have not said to anyone that you hit me.

1498
02:15:04,003 --> 02:15:04,691
You too do not reveal it.

1499
02:15:06,971 --> 02:15:08,291
People started believing us just now!

1500
02:15:11,891 --> 02:15:12,539
Do not let it go!

1501
02:15:17,947 --> 02:15:19,945
Reddy, no energy. Take out the vehicle.

1502
02:15:25,898 --> 02:15:26,426
Ready sir!
