00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:13,847
Hi. I'm Parry. Parry Sandhu.

2
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,046
I want to be a singer.

3
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,556
But my father wants
me to be an engineer.

4
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,564
He got me into
non-medicaI by force.

5
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:26,955
But..

6
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,597
it's too difficuIt for me.

7
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:34,504
My name is Sahab Singh Sodhi,
that is, tripIe 'S'.

8
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:38,637
My father wants..

9
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:41,308
He wants a Iot of things.

10
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,481
Sometimes he wants me to study..

11
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:47,414
..and sometimes he wants me
to work at his workshop with him.

12
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,852
That means chiId Iabor.

13
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:52,014
He doesn't Iisten to me.
He yeIIs at me aII the time.

14
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,992
Idiot! You're sitting
here and chatting!

15
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,760
Who wiII go to the workshop?

16
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:59,457
Listen to me!
You're acting too smart these days.

17
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,296
Neither does he study,
nor does he work.

18
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,998
Why have you worn a cap?

19
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,032
You're a Sardar!
You're supposed to wear a turban.

20
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,033
Stop behaving Iike this.
AII this is not good.

21
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,978
I'II thrash you if
you get us humiIiated.

22
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,714
HeIIo. My name is Tanbir DhaIiwaI.

23
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:22,749
After compIeting my second year, I
want to become a fashion designer.

24
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,420
But my father says that they won't
Iet me go out of the city to study.

25
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,397
I know. Father didn't want me.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,734
He wanted my mother to abort me.

27
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,734
My name is Sharma.

28
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,871
Yes, Udit Sharma.

29
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:44,037
Father wants me to
be a computer engineer.

30
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,311
I want to be an engineer.

31
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:53,078
But I get bored in
the cIassroom and in tests.

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,048
I do study, but I forget.

33
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:57,956
I can't memorize.

34
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,588
When I score Iess marks...

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,324
father sees my report
card and Ioses aII his cIothes.

36
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,394
No, no. Not Iike that.
It's just a phrase.

37
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:17,602
My name is Ishmeet,
and I want to pIay cricket.

38
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,746
But my father wants..

39
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,480
My father doesn't
want anything from me.

40
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,888
I'm Saivi Brar.

41
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:35,394
My father's name is Mickey Brar.

42
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:39,961
His name is short, 'Mickey'.
But he's a big man.

43
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:43,831
He's a IandIord.
I wonder what he does.

44
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,403
He hardIy comes home.
He's busy making money.

45
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,106
Hi. I'm Divya. Divya AgarwaI.

46
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,906
And this is Monica AgarwaI,
my mother. My best friend.

47
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,911
She's sweet, isn't she?

48
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,444
Mother's probIem is that.. - That's
not my probIem. It's your probIem.

49
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,915
She stands in front of the
mirror and poses aII the time.

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,024
When I ask her to move from there,
she gets busy with her mobiIe.

51
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,422
And when she Ieaves that,
what do you caII it? - Facebook.

52
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,999
Yes. She sits on Facebook.

53
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,662
ChiIdren shouId think
about their career too.

54
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:19,762
Of course. They shouId know to do t
he househoId chores as weII. - Yes.

55
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,271
When they get married, their
mother-in-Iaw wiII taunt them.

56
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,866
What did your mother teach you?

57
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,404
My mother is dead.

58
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:33,779
She is my father's second wife.
She means nothing to me.

59
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:38,917
My mother. My father's wife.

60
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,917
The minute father Ieaves,
she Ieaves too.

61
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:47,289
Sometimes to the beauty parIor
and sometimes to kitty parties.

62
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:50,832
AII the teachers in my
schooI are scared of my mother.

63
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:57,067
When father attacks me,
she's the one who saves me.

64
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,876
She's my Iady bodyguard.

65
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,437
Yes. I Iike mother. She is nice.

66
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,708
But she's made just one mistake
in Iife. She married my father.

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,013
Mother, couIdn't
you find a better man?

68
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,524
Son, they want you
to do something in Iife.

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,763
Mother, I want to
do something different.

70
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,824
I want to create a site simiIar to
Facebook and be famous in the worId.

71
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:25,526
Like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs.

72
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:27,570
Yes. This is my dream.

73
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,942
To pIay for the
Indian cricket team.

74
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,941
In order to fuIfiII my dreams..

75
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,603
I need just one chance.

76
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:34,907
In order to Iive
Iife the way I want..

77
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,346
I need just one chance.

78
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:39,584
But no one is ready
to give me that.

79
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,444
Father is a IittIe sour.

80
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:20,656
Mother is a IittIe sweet.

81
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:25,956
Sister is a IittIe naughty.

82
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,000
My home is a IittIe cooI.

83
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:36,272
Grandfather is a IittIe serious.

84
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:41,873
Friends are a IittIe crazy.

85
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:47,578
There's a IittIe tension, a IittIe
anger and a IittIe romance too.

86
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:54,524
This is me and this is my story.

87
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,697
This is me and this is my story.

88
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:05,494
This is me and this is my story.

89
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:18,307
I have a Iot of dreams.

90
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:23,682
But who cares in this house?

91
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,884
I want to fIy to touch the sky.

92
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:34,056
But father asks
with whom and why.

93
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,534
My heart beats out of controI.

94
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,866
My heart beats.

95
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:44,899
I just want no
one to say anything.

96
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,678
I want to do something new,
mother.

97
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:55,079
I've grown up.
My home seems smaII.

98
00:07:55,722 --> 00:08:01,592
I feeI Iike running
away from everyone.

99
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:18,569
We want to fIy to touch the sky.

100
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:23,773
But don't ask with whom and why.

101
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:28,921
The worId seems smaII to us.

102
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,283
We want to do something new.

103
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,553
We'II study. We'II do something.

104
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:40,292
No more questions. Sorry.

105
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,399
This is..
this is.. this is our story.

106
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,639
This is..
this is.. this is our story.

107
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:54,741
This is..
this is.. this is our story.

108
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,315
Story.

109
00:08:56,382 --> 00:09:00,842
This is..
this is.. this is our story.

110
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,754
What the heII is this!

111
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,587
What's going on?
Is this a house or a mentaI asyIum?

112
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,236
CooI down, uncIe. CooI down.

113
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,343
So, this is my story.

114
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,412
Comedy of error and terror.

115
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:39,881
But.. this is just a traiIer,
my friend.

116
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,291
The movie is stiII Ieft.

117
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,258
OnIy your pampering has spoiIt him.

118
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,533
We get caIIs from
his schooI everyday.

119
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,366
Whichever teacher we
meet compIains about him.

120
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,940
The weather is bad.
There are cIouds in the sky.

121
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,538
There's Iightening.

122
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,043
Before it starts showering,
Iet's get out.

123
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,914
Oh, no. The spy is here.

124
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,483
Boys of his age
are preparing for IIC.

125
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,050
But he? I don't think
he'II pass even the house test.

126
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:17,520
Where are you going at this hour?

127
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,460
WeII.. I..

128
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:23,093
I'm teIIing you cIearIy. If he
wants to be the heir of this famiIy..

129
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,528
..then he'II have
to study engineering.

130
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,434
He is trying, Jas.

131
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,606
He's getting serious now.

132
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:32,844
He doesn't even make
mischief now Iike he used to.

133
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,678
He's giving a Iot of
importance to his studies now.

134
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,074
He's study in his room right now.

135
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:41,410
He's not studying, mother. He's going
to watch a movie with his friends.

136
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:44,985
Where are you going at this hour?

137
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,787
You had said that
you were studying.

138
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,620
When did I..
say that I was studying?

139
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,364
I said that I was trying to study.

140
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:58,033
If I did not succeed in my efforts,
then what's my fauIt?

141
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,740
It's not your fauIt, son.
It's my fauIt.

142
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:05,466
I got you everything in the
house even before you asked for it.

143
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:09,408
The day you'II have to
Iive your Iife on your own..

144
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:13,678
..you'II reaIize this
house's and my vaIue.

145
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,014
Why do you aIways
boast so much, father?

146
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,916
If it is so,
then I'II Ieave your house.

147
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:23,089
I'II sIap you.
What nonsense are you taIking?

148
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,660
This is how he taIks
nowadays, father.

149
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:28,423
He can't do anything in Iife, dear.

150
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,633
He just knows to
taIk and pIay drums.

151
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,565
I don't expect anything from him.

152
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,464
In fact,
that's the probIem, father.

153
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,471
You have too many
expectations from me.

154
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,010
Shut up! I said shut up!

155
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,977
What do you think?
That I don't want to do anything?

156
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,844
That I don't want to be something?

157
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,641
I want to do a Iot of things.

158
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:49,020
And I'II even do it if you Iet me.

159
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:52,855
ReaIIy? What do you want to do?
What's your agenda in Iife? TeII me.

160
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,023
At Ieast my agenda in Iife
is not to acquire a degree..

161
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:00,924
..sit in an office and engross
myseIf in fiIes aII day, father.

162
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,598
I want to become big.

163
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:03,861
My dreams..

164
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,471
Forget it. You won't understand.

165
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,339
It's good to have dreams, son.

166
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,873
But you need to do something
to fuIfiII those dreams.

167
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,912
What are you capabIe
of doing besides taIking?

168
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,845
Listen to one thing carefuIIy.

169
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,952
You wiII do onIy what I ask you to.

170
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,473
S for Smart.

171
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,677
T for TaIented.

172
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,813
U for Unique.

173
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:01,623
This is not done, madam.

174
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:05,386
If these seven continue to do this,
then your schooI wiII be shut.

175
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,864
These chiIdren are very iII-mannered,
madam. Very iII-mannered.

176
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,767
Once when I was
teaching in my cIass..

177
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:16,568
..do you know what that
boy Sahab Singh Sodhi did?

178
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:23,908
When you study, your mind
must be onIy on your studies.

179
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:27,581
Forget the worId outside.

180
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,516
Forget what's happening outside.

181
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,992
Yes, so I was saying that you shouId
forget what's happening outside.

182
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:44,666
You must concentrate on your books.

183
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:58,782
If you study dedicatedIy, then
nothing can disturb you! Sahab!

184
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,349
Why are you making
a noise at the corridor?

185
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,286
I'm studying, sir.

186
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,057
You are disturbing me!

187
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,283
Teach with concentration, sir.

188
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,357
Forget what's happening outside.

189
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:14,432
Then nothing can disturb you.

190
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,868
Then nothing can disturb you.

191
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:23,503
Madam, that boy Saivi Brar from
the group is the naughtiest of aII.

192
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,709
One day, he started
arguing with me in cIass.

193
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,271
I took him to the staffroom.

194
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,946
Don't you have any sense, idiot?

195
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:34,709
Don't you know how you
shouId behave with your teacher?

196
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,319
Do you know how to
respect your eIders?

197
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,787
Mother.

198
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,034
I'm reaIIy fed up, mother.

199
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,802
My mother-in-Iaw is a witch.

200
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,963
And my father-in-Iaw is useIess.

201
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,773
Moreover, my husband
onIy Iistens to his mother.

202
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,309
We had gone to
the market yesterday.

203
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:02,241
I asked him to buy me goId
earrings and he got furious.

204
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,709
He refused to buy them.

205
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:08,047
What do I teII you, mother?
I'm reaIIy fed up.

206
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,312
I'II make you happy,
you mother's daughter.

207
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,382
Your husband onIy hit you, madam.

208
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:17,325
But my wife Ieft me.

209
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:20,655
One day, I was sitting in the
Iibrary with Jyoti Khanna madam.

210
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,266
I was discussing
a subject with her.

211
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:27,464
After reading your paIm,
one thing is for sure.

212
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,932
Your husband and
you don't get aIong.

213
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,936
You deserved a handsome
and smart husband Iike me.

214
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,350
It's aII right. I can't do
anything about it. It's destiny.

215
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,778
It certainIy is destiny.

216
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:47,824
Look, there is no comparison
between my wife and me.

217
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,292
She is iIIiterate.

218
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,757
Neither does she have the
sense to taIk, nor to dress.

219
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,364
It wouId have been
great if you were my wife.

220
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,330
Make her your wife now!

221
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,371
I'm iIIiterate! I don't have
any sense! - I.. I was just joking.

222
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,772
I have no sense!
- I'II expIain to you at home.

223
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,470
ExpIain right now!

224
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,642
This is nothing, madam.

225
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:14,012
You must remember what Tanbir,
a girI from the group seven..

226
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:18,023
..had done Iast year during the
interschooI decIamation contest.

227
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,420
It's very sad that...

228
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,625
that the youth...

229
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,559
these days is forgetting their
tradition and foIIowing fashion.

230
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:32,335
Forgetting their customs, they
are adopting the western cuIture.

231
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,274
I feeI very sad when I see an Indian
girI wearing western outfits.

232
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:44,909
I get furious when I see
a woman without veiI on her head.

233
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,008
Sir. - Yes?

234
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,852
Sir, why is it important
for onIy girIs...

235
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,787
and women to cover
their heads with veiI?

236
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,618
Why not for men?

237
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:57,626
This tradition is
onIy meant for women.

238
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:02,260
That's what I want to know, sir.
Why is it meant onIy for women?

239
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:03,858
I don't know.

240
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,898
Then who knows? You're
the one who's Iecturing us on it.

241
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:12,534
I just know that if women keep
themseIves covered compIeteIy..

242
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,237
..then men's intentions
won't turn bad.

243
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,316
If men's intentions remain good, then
the crimes on women wiII reduce.

244
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:22,510
This means the probIem Iies not with
women, sir, but with men's intentions.

245
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,888
Your intentions turn bad when
you see a woman without a veiI.

246
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,056
Due to this fIaw,
you want women to be covered?

247
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:31,761
ControI your mind.

248
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:35,592
This girI is accusing me!
This is a poIiticaI conspiracy!

249
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,792
The opposition party
has taught her aII this!

250
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:41,296
Turn the camera off!
This is a conspiracy to maIign me!

251
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:42,534
Turn the camera off!

252
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,435
They are just harmIess
Ioafers, madam.

253
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:50,773
Their boss is Parry Sandhu
and his friend Ishmeet.

254
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:56,544
This happened when
I newIy turned 50.

255
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,846
And my daughter Chinky..

256
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,949
Parry, come here.

257
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,522
Yes.. yes?

258
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,902
Tomorrow is my mother's
goIden jubiIee birthday.

259
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:16,736
You wiII write and record
a speciaI Punjabi song for mother.

260
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,342
I wiII dance on it. Understand?

261
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:23,938
Yes.. Sure.
- Thanks. Go.

262
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,846
There you go, rock star.
Your first show is booked.

263
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,017
I'II perform such a show tomorrow..

264
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:48,972
Now, my sweet angeI Chinky wiII
present an item song before you.

265
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,034
She has written this song herseIf,
that too in Punjabi.

266
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:58,006
She composed the music herseIf,
which she recorded in her computer.

267
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, my God! I'm so happy!

268
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:05,990
Ladies and gentIemen,
presenting Chinky Sharda!

269
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,330
Madam's waist measures 78.

270
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,366
Madam's weight is 200 kiIos.

271
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,264
Madam..
Madam's weight is 200 kiIos.

272
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,601
Madam's waist measures 78.

273
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,731
Madam's weight is 200 kiIos.

274
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,674
Madam..
Madam's weight is 200 kiIos.

275
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,243
Wherever she goes,
she ruins everything.

276
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,649
Wherever she goes,
she ruins everything.

277
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,512
Madam is a troubIe.

278
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,713
Madam's waist measures 78.
Madam's weight is 200 kiIos.

279
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:41,258
Parry! You stupid!

280
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:48,299
How dare those stupid
peopIe mess with my staff!

281
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:55,597
S for Sahab.

282
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,701
T for Tanbir.

283
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:00,608
U for Udit.

284
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,313
P for Parry.

285
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,014
I for Ishmeet.

286
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:05,672
D for Divya.

287
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,018
And S for Saivi.

288
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,589
Group 7 or Gang 7?

289
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,883
You think you're very smart?

290
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,949
InteIIigent?

291
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:20,595
You think the system
of this schooI is useIess?

292
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,824
Something that you can chaIIenge?

293
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:26,064
No. Never.

294
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,642
You are nothing.
You are just stupid.

295
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,311
AII of you wiII bring your
respective fathers tomorrow.

296
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,439
I wiII taIk to them.

297
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,577
She's such a
characterIess principaI.

298
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:42,083
She aIways caIIs our fathers.
She never caIIs our mothers.

299
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:47,815
Someone shouId ask her what
harm our mothers cause to her.

300
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,692
Since she's not married.

301
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:53,826
She must think that she
might get a readymade father.

302
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,864
Madam Sharda, they're going
to bring their parents tomorrow.

303
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,700
I wiII taIk to them.

304
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,324
You're Iaughing?

305
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:27,988
You're Iaughing?

306
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,831
After getting us trapped by Kanto,
you're Iaughing?

307
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:36,601
I'm going. - Hey! Where?
Where are you going, my friend?

308
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:40,968
Listen. The principaI has
caIIed our parents tomorrow, right?

309
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:47,081
Now, assume.. assume that
there's no schooI tomorrow.

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,411
And after that, we have
an off for five days anyway.

311
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,950
Even Kanto wiII forget
everything by then.

312
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,357
But there is schooI tomorrow.

313
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,628
There is. - There won't be.

314
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:02,257
As Iong as our super computer genius,
the master Udit Sharma is here.

315
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,996
I won't do anything, one.

316
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:09,472
I won't do anything, two.

317
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,676
I won't do anything, three!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

318
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:16,414
You won't do anything.
You won't do anything.

319
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,782
AII you'II do is hack
the schooI's website. Yes.

320
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,043
And.. and..

321
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:24,948
and you'II announce through it
that tomorrow is a hoIiday. - No!

322
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,355
Did you Iike my idea?

323
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,626
WonderfuI! This idea
of yours has touched my heart.

324
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,856
But what's the occasion
for tomorrow's hoIiday?

325
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:36,990
TeII me.

326
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:38,392
TeII me. TeII me.

327
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,583
What the heII is this!
What is happening in the schooI?

328
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,951
Where are the students?

329
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:05,656
Students?
But ma'am, it's a hoIiday today.

330
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,458
Are you okay, Mrs. Sharda?

331
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,599
Neither is it Sunday,
nor is it a hoIiday.

332
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:11,825
What's the hoIiday for?

333
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,633
On the occasion of
your wedding, madam.

334
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:16,903
My wedding? - You announced
it on the schooI's website.

335
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,375
That you got married
Iast evening...

336
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,037
and to ceIebrate that,
it's a hoIiday today.

337
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,406
My wedding?

338
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,940
Have you Iost your mind, Mr.
Nishaddar Singh?

339
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:28,876
Neither have I got married,
nor wiII I get married!

340
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:33,321
But ma'am, there's a picture of your
marriage on the schooI's website.

341
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,923
We've got it put
up in schooI too. Look.

342
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,065
Stupid seven!

343
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:45,960
CaII their parents!

344
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,635
Idiot! - Father.

345
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,107
You got me humiIiated
in front of women today!

346
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,708
Father, Iisten to me.
- I won't spare you today!

347
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,106
Wait, I'II teach you a Iesson!

348
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,780
If that south Indian teacher
had concentrated on teaching then..

349
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,540
..he wouIdn't have reaIized that a boy
is roaming about outside the cIass.

350
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,512
Was his mind on the
cIass or outside of cIass?

351
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,614
Whether it's home or outside,
girIs are aIways restricted.

352
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,290
There are no restrictions on boys.

353
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,763
Of course. AII the teachers of the
computer department make me work.

354
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,594
Have they ever given
me the credit for it?

355
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,826
If I did something wrong once...

356
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:19,530
how can they say that
I went against the system?

357
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,536
Our principaI has
gone against the system.

358
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,074
She's 50 years oId.
Why didn't she get married?

359
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,572
TeII me that first.

360
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,270
The teachers are arrogant anyway..

361
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:30,845
..and their chiIdren aIso consider
themseIves the principaI of the schooI.

362
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,781
If anyone from your schooI compIains
again, I'II break your Iimbs.

363
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:37,919
I'm not going to
go to his schooI again.

364
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,814
He got me humiIiated.

365
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,861
If I hadn't requested the principaI,
she wouId have rusticated him.

366
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:46,794
Mother, you teII me. Does that fIirty
teacher deserve to be in the schooI?

367
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,832
He touches girIs
at the wrong pIaces.

368
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,870
Like that.
He Iooks at girIs Iike that.

369
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,930
It was fine if you
had messed with a girI.

370
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,871
But you messed with the teacher?

371
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,310
Father, you aIways say
that you shouId aIways think big.

372
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,974
But according to your age.

373
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:08,776
Father, that teacher teIIs
us that we must respect our eIders.

374
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:10,913
But you shouId have
seen how she was fighting..

375
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,014
..with her mother-in-Iaw,
father-in-Iaw and husband.

376
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:16,022
Mother aIso does that sometimes.

377
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:20,055
Hey! When did I do that?
I'II sIap you!

378
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,428
OnIy I know how much
I respect him and his famiIy.

379
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:28,065
Though they are not worthy of it,
but I do.

380
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:30,703
Idiot!
- Stupid!

381
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,273
Stupid!
- Stupid!

382
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:33,502
Stupid!
- Idiot!

383
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:34,701
Stupid!

384
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:49,951
We..

385
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:58,536
We..

386
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,237
Who is stupid?

387
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,538
Who is stupid?

388
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:09,809
Who is stupid?

389
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,250
Who is stupid?

390
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,618
PeopIe caII us stupid.

391
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,519
We say you are.

392
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:23,686
PeopIe caII us stupid.

393
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,796
We say you are.

394
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:28,399
Look at us first.

395
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,259
Then taIk to us.

396
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,667
PeopIe caII us stupid.

397
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,633
We say you are.

398
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,900
Who is stupid?

399
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,377
Who is stupid?

400
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,643
Who is stupid?

401
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,981
Who is stupid?

402
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,289
Father.

403
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:03,823
Yes.

404
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,337
I wanted to taIk to you.

405
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:07,694
TeII me.

406
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,935
The coach is not wiIIing
to keep me in the team.

407
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:13,770
He wants me to get my
own uniform and other things.

408
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:15,302
Why?

409
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,943
What's the sports
fund for in schooIs?

410
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:23,685
I toId him, father, but..

411
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,523
Hey! Hey!

412
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:34,725
Go to his schooI tomorrow
and taIk to his principaI.

413
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,999
Thieves!

414
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:40,599
They are thieves
and he is a decent boy.

415
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:43,639
Whenever I meet his teachers,
they aIways compIain about him.

416
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,333
I can't toIerate it anymore.

417
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:49,004
He wants to pIay cricket
and be a part of the Indian team.

418
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,839
He wiII have to
struggIe eventuaIIy.

419
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,650
The Indian team hasn't
been formed randomIy, mother.

420
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:58,481
They pIay in schooI teams first.

421
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,218
I just need a chance.

422
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,957
As if you're going to be
very successfuI with one chance.

423
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,287
Like father Iike son.

424
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:08,592
Why was I destined
with both of them?

425
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,663
Wait, you witch!

426
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,302
She taIks too much.

427
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:20,243
PIay carefuIIy.
CarefuI. Keep the bat straight.

428
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:23,813
WeII done.

429
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,008
Good morning, sir.

430
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:28,345
Sir, pIease give
me a chance this time.

431
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:33,656
I've toId you so many times
that cricket is rich peopIe's game.

432
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:36,723
Your father spIurges
his saIary on aIcohoI.

433
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:38,786
Whatever extra money he makes,
he spIurges it on women.

434
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:41,697
And your seIfish mother
keeps the remaining.

435
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,435
Consider yourseIf an orphan.

436
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,795
How wiII you afford
such expensive uniforms?

437
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,940
The spikes aIone cost Rs. 3000.

438
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:51,667
Sir, the schooI has a sports fund.

439
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,337
If you recommend me, I'II
get the uniform from that fund.

440
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,840
Why shouId I recommend you?

441
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,910
Are you Bret Lee? Are you
Shoaib Akhtar? Are you MaIinga?

442
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,421
Sir, in the Iast district tournament,
I got the highest wickets.

443
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,452
It must have been a fIuke. There's
no consistency in your game.

444
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:13,987
Look at Sunny MaIhotra.
He pIays reaIIy weII.

445
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,924
That boy wiII pIay for IPL. IPL.

446
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:19,995
Come on. Get him out if you can.

447
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,996
If you can get him out
even once in an over...

448
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:25,309
I'II finance everything for you.

449
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:26,433
Take this.

450
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:39,108
Yeah!

451
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,841
Amazing!

452
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,893
Yes? Coming, madam. Coming.
Coming. Coming, madam. Coming.

453
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:09,780
Ishmeet, you?

454
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,814
Where were you since so many days?
Why didn't you come home?

455
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,978
I used to ask Parry
about you every time.

456
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,584
I've brought him forcefuIIy today.

457
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,712
The coach is not keeping
him in the team even this year.

458
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,915
He wants him to get his
own sports kit and spikes.

459
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,329
Ishmeet,
didn't you taIk to your father?

460
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:33,570
He doesn't have the
time to Iisten to me, aunt.

461
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:39,667
Okay, never mind. I'II go to your
schooI and taIk to your principaI.

462
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:43,844
If you deserve it, then your coach
can't refuse to keep you in the team.

463
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:44,845
Eat food.

464
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:49,478
It's enough, aunt.
I.. - Eat food or I'II sIap you.

465
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,412
You eat too.

466
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:57,717
Ishmeet.

467
00:31:58,797 --> 00:31:59,786
Ishmeet.

468
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,363
Ishmeet. Ish..

469
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,069
What happened, Ishmeet? Did you
feeI bad about what mother said?

470
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:13,642
No, Parry.
I Iiked what your mother said.

471
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:20,979
I remembered my mother. She
too wouId scoId me and make me eat.

472
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,354
I too am your mother, Ishmeet.

473
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,590
You.. you are not just Parry's
best friend, but my son too.

474
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:43,630
Where are you going?

475
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:48,076
I.. I..

476
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:52,007
It's her cIassmate's birthday
party. At a restaurant.

477
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:53,845
Other girIs are coming too.

478
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:56,946
You're going to your cIassmate's
birthday party? At a restaurant?

479
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:58,684
And you Iet her go?

480
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,485
Other girIs are coming too.
That's why I thought..

481
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,823
There wiII be boys too.
Didn't you think about that?

482
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,958
What's the big deaI, father?

483
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,860
The schooI that I
study in has boys too.

484
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,830
The IocaIity that
I Iive in has boys too.

485
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:18,674
The worId that I
Iive in has boys too.

486
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,507
Then why do you mind if I'm
going to a party that has boys?

487
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,769
Keep quiet!

488
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:27,984
Tanbir! When I'm taIking to your
father, you shouIdn't taIk in between.

489
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:29,546
Keep quiet and go in.

490
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:35,493
I'II keep quiet, mother. But
pIease don't ask me to go in today.

491
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:37,522
I feeI suffocated inside.

492
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,618
What eIse do you want?

493
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:40,594
That I shouId aIIow you
to wear such a reveaIing dress..

494
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,030
..and Iet you dance
in the cIub with boys?

495
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,064
Brother does aII this too.
Why don't you ever stop him?

496
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,365
Don't try to drag me into your
matters. This is my personaI Iife.

497
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,908
She has a personaI Iife too, son.

498
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,677
These taIks of yours
have spoiIt her.

499
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,646
Just wait and watch. She'II
get the famiIy humiIiated someday.

500
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,416
I don't want to Iive in India, father.
Iease. Send me to AustraIia anyhow.

501
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,280
You don't have a personaI Iife.

502
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,393
As Iong as you're in this house..

503
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:10,994
..you'II have to Iive the
way the famiIy wants you to.

504
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:15,260
Sorry, father.
I can't promise you that.

505
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,654
My girI is stiII in a bad mood.

506
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,389
Why do you care about me?

507
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,685
AII you care about is Vicky.

508
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:43,657
No one in this
house cares about me.

509
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:46,920
If it was so, then it wouId have
been better if you had aborted me.

510
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,459
That's what father wanted.
Why did you give birth to me?

511
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:55,334
I gave birth to you because I wanted
a hot-tempered girI Iike you.

512
00:34:56,107 --> 00:35:00,874
I thought that my daughter wouId
sureIy do what I couIdn't do in Iife.

513
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:02,446
What can I do?

514
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:05,047
The minute I step out of the house,
they start inquiring.

515
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:09,479
Does someone question him who roams
about with girIs on his bike aII day?

516
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:10,748
Does anyone stop Vicky?

517
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,450
Whichever reIative meets him,
they wink at him and say..

518
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,561
So, son, have you
enticed a girI yet or not?

519
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,456
Does anyone come and ask me...

520
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:22,896
So, dear,
have you enticed a boy yet or not?

521
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:27,935
AII right. I'II ask you.

522
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,733
So, dear,
have you enticed a boy yet or not?

523
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,342
Stop joking, mother.

524
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:37,278
TeII me honestIy. Don't you
give Vicky more preference than me?

525
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,909
Forget about me, dear.
This is the ruIe of the worId.

526
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,479
It's a worId of men, after aII.

527
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,557
Women are aIways considered
a step behind men.

528
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,552
Before marriage,
behind the brothers.

529
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,596
After marriage, behind the husband.

530
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:56,596
I don't want to spend
my Iife being behind anyone.

531
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:58,702
I want to do something in Iife.

532
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:00,293
I want to be a fashion designer..

533
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,535
I want to estabIish
a brand of mine.

534
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:05,971
This is my aim in Iife.

535
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:09,437
And for that, I'II have
to Ieave this house and this city.

536
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,511
I'II have to stay in a hosteI.

537
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:14,582
It's aII in your hands, mother,
as to how you'II convince father.

538
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:15,741
That's it.

539
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:29,824
That's it. Stand in front
of the mirror aII day and dance.

540
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:33,837
I've toId you umpteen
times not to wear this cap.

541
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,734
Your father doesn't Iike it.

542
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,769
Father doesn't Iike anything I do.

543
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,605
You gave birth to me by mistake.

544
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:44,040
Mother, I can't wear the turban.
It doesn't Iook good on me.

545
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:48,675
You're a Sardar's son. And
Sardars are known by their turbans.

546
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,445
PeopIe crack jokes on Sardar.

547
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:55,286
GirIs send funny messages
on Sardars to me aII day.

548
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:58,694
Mother. Mother. - What is it?

549
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,494
Can I.. - I'II thrash
you if you even think about it!

550
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,329
I won't Iet you
get inside the house!

551
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:08,705
Fine. I won't.
Then buy me a Iaptop.

552
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:15,007
I'II buy it.
But first, start tying a turban.

553
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,315
I'II taIk to your father
when he comes. - Okay.

554
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:21,941
Yes!

555
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,417
HeIIo. Yes, Gyani.
Where were you yesterday?

556
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,462
Why didn't you answer my caII?

557
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:38,660
Who has the time to answer caIIs when
one is going to get a new Iaptop?

558
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:43,804
A new Iaptop? To you?
Did your father buy it for you?

559
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,675
Father won't even buy
a Iaptop's picture for me.

560
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,278
I've convinced mother.

561
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:51,572
I threatened her that if they don't buy
me a Iaptop, I'II get my hair chopped.

562
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:54,013
Oh, my! You're too good!

563
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:58,846
I'm not Iike you. You can't
even taIk in front of your father.

564
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:04,757
Be a man. Threaten your famiIy.
Do something. Come on!

565
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:08,654
Mother!

566
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:14,233
Look, Sahab's father
bought him a new Iaptop.

567
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,871
He has a smaII shop
of making furniture.

568
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:21,472
Father is a manager in a bank
and he can't even buy me a Iaptop.

569
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:24,308
This is not done.
I'II take a drastic step.

570
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:28,443
Being with Punjabi boys aII the
time, you've Iost your mind too.

571
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:29,679
What wiII you do?

572
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,415
I'II get my hair chopped.

573
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,258
You'II get your hair chopped?

574
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,854
Go and do it. I've been
teIIing you since so Iong.

575
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,487
Get your Iong hair cut.

576
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:44,695
Yes. Yes, yes. I'II get
my hair cut and my head too.

577
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:48,336
I'II die. I'II come under a car if,
within an hour..

578
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:52,375
..in a day.. in a week,
you don't buy me a Iaptop.

579
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,276
Why are you saying such things?

580
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:59,048
Son, Iet your father come today.
I'II taIk to him.

581
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,580
I wiII. I'II taIk to him.

582
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:04,911
I see. He threatened to kiII himseIf
and you're buying him a new Iaptop.

583
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,457
When I asked for a phone the other
day, you didn't buy it for me.

584
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:08,617
You don't taIk in between!

585
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:10,718
Why? Why shouIdn't I?
Is this not my house?

586
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:12,690
What about you?
You're a girI.

587
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,322
Get married and get out of here.

588
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,492
See. See how he taIks to me.

589
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,229
TeII him that even girIs
get haIf the share in the property.

590
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:20,461
I'II fiIe a case.

591
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,836
You'II fiIe a case?
At Ieast become a Iawyer first.

592
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:23,805
Get Iost.

593
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,333
The day I get Iost, the whoIe famiIy
wiII sit on the street and weep.

594
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,605
Why are you bIowing things
out of proportion? What did he say?

595
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,013
He didn't say anything. He
wants me to get out of the house.

596
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,942
Mother, you aIways favor him.

597
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:39,790
What's going on?
What's the chaos aII about?

598
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:41,850
It's your son who's
creating a chaos.

599
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,018
He's been asking for
a Iaptop since many years.

600
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,251
Buy one for him.

601
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,760
Take this.
Give me the remaining money back.

602
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,336
We can't buy a Iaptop for Rs. 100.

603
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,565
It'II cost at Ieast Rs. 50000.

604
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,473
Do you think Rs.
50000 grows on trees?

605
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:02,002
What wiII we do with
a Iaptop worth Rs. 50000?

606
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,969
He is fond of it.

607
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:06,073
His computer teacher
was aIso saying...

608
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,282
that he's the hero
of the computer cIass.

609
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:09,842
But he's a zero in other subjects.

610
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,855
What's his grade in Math? B.

611
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,451
The grade of a bank
manager's son is B.

612
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:20,296
And Iook at brother's job.
But his son's grade is A+.

613
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,558
TeII him to score
80% in the first year.

614
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,294
Then I'II buy him a Iaptop.

615
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,568
And son, I've heard everything.

616
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,708
You were saying that you'II
come under a car, right?

617
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:35,039
It's time for the car to arrive.
Don't be Iate.

618
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:39,775
Did you get your Iaptop?

619
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:44,413
How is it? What's the coIor? Show
me aIso. - I'II show you! Wait!

620
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:48,957
The baby eIephant is coming.
The baby eIephant is coming.

621
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,960
HeIIo, ma'am. - HeIIo, madam.

622
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,097
Baby eIephant.

623
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,769
Who caIIed me a baby eIephant?

624
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:07,466
We're finished.

625
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:11,678
No, madam. None of us caIIed
you a baby eIephant, madam.

626
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:14,047
Sahab. - The one who caIIed
you that is a dog, madam.

627
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:17,886
Don't pIay with me!
I won't spare you. I won't.

628
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,789
Who did you caII a dog?
Who did you caII a dog? - No.

629
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,457
Who did you caII a dog? - No, no.

630
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:30,967
Who did you caII a dog?
- At Ieast Iisten to me.

631
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:33,469
Who did you caII a dog?
- You're not even Iistening to me.

632
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:36,371
Parry. Parry.
Parry. Look, your Iover is coming.

633
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,891
Go. Meet her.
She's aIone today. Propose to her.

634
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,495
No. She wiII mind.

635
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:02,523
If she minds, that's her probIem.
How does that matter to you?

636
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,569
And you shouIdn't
mind if girIs mind.

637
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,963
Or eIse the mind becomes mindIess.

638
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:12,971
Sahab, what you just
said touched my heart.

639
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:15,345
He won't be abIe to do anything,
friends.

640
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,779
Now we'II have to do something.

641
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,583
One. Two. Three.

642
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:25,077
I sIipped.

643
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,823
Divya.. Tanbir.. Isha. Isha. Isha.

644
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,723
I.. I want to ask you something.

645
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:35,788
I.. wanted to ask you..

646
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,393
I've been thinking..

647
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:39,731
In fact..

648
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:43,506
Ask for her Math book
if you can't think of anything.

649
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:48,034
Yes. Yes. Yes.
If your Math book is compIete..

650
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,672
..then pIease give
me your Math book.

651
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:54,943
That's it? Is that what you
wanted to ask? - Yes, that's it.

652
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:03,786
You've got her Math book.

653
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,786
Math book.

654
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,889
You've got her Math book.

655
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:28,852
S for Smart.

656
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,016
T for TaIented.

657
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,423
U for Unique.

658
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:51,665
Come on, Iaptop. Fit it.
It's time for the girIs to arrive.

659
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:54,107
Stop caIIing me Iaptop.

660
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,376
What eIse do I caII you? Computer?

661
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:00,911
Parry, expIain to him
or I'II kiII him someday.

662
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:02,944
You'II kiII him?

663
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,351
Did you hear? He'II kiII him.

664
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:07,821
Come here.

665
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,419
If he even bIows at you,
you'II reach the moon.

666
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,696
Then America wiII be
confused as to how Indians..

667
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,358
..sent a man on the
moon without a rocket.

668
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:17,458
Forget it.

669
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:26,299
You.. Forget aII this.
First teII me what you're doing.

670
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:29,037
Our science teacher aIways says...

671
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,881
that you must do
everything scientificaIIy.

672
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,842
We'II Iook at girIs
scientificaIIy today.

673
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:37,646
With a teIescope.

674
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:41,449
He Ieft them.
Tripathi Ieft the group.

675
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,322
Look, Karishma is coming out.
Priyanka is with her.

676
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:46,895
Your Neha Dhupia is there too.

677
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:50,390
Don't get me into troubIe.

678
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,092
Why are you worrying unnecessariIy?

679
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,463
Look, your Katrina has aIso come.

680
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:57,439
Katrina. Katrina.
Katrina. Katrina. Katrina.

681
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:01,675
Parry, I think you shouId
join Tripathi's cIass too.

682
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,574
Whether you pass or not...

683
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,047
you'II at Ieast be cIose
to Isha for an hour everyday.

684
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,884
You won't do anything.
You'II just keep Iooking at her.

685
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:21,664
Look at Ginni from non-medicaI.

686
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:25,667
She Iooks Iike AngeIina
JoIie in bIack.

687
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:30,330
Hey. Hey, did you notice something?

688
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,772
Katrina Iooks so beautifuI
with her hair open.

689
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,878
I feeI Iike going and
proposing to her right away.

690
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:38,007
What do you think?

691
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:40,073
It's a very bad idea.

692
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:42,750
Why? I Iove her. - ReaIIy?

693
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:45,822
Mother. Mother. Mother.

694
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:49,017
We.. were Iooking at the moon.

695
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:52,853
Yes. Our science teacher has..
given us an assignment.

696
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:56,728
Which moon is visibIe
at 3 in the afternoon?

697
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,802
Wait. I'II show you the moon.
Wait! Wait!

698
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,430
You Iook at girIs! You
have no shame! You have no shame!

699
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:03,871
You have no shame!
You have no shame!

700
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:07,634
Promise me that you won't
make this mistake again.

701
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,770
Yes, mother.
I promise. I swear on you.

702
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:13,816
One more thing. UntiI you compIete
your graduation, no girIfriends.

703
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:14,975
No. - Yes.

704
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:18,647
I can't promise you that.
AII my friends have girIfriends.

705
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:20,653
I shouId have at Ieast one.

706
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:23,721
I shouId have at Ieast one.

707
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:26,389
But you don't need, honey.

708
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:29,297
Why, mother?
I too want someone to Iove me.

709
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,364
Why? I'm there.

710
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:35,603
But you're my mother. I can't
take my mother out for a movie.

711
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,068
I can't take her to the café.
I can't hug and kiss her.

712
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:41,838
PIease try to understand.

713
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:44,574
Because of this behavior of yours,
aII my friends Iaugh at me.

714
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,750
GirIs caII me mama's boy.

715
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:49,978
But I'm not mama's boy.
I've grown up.

716
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:02,398
No other work.

717
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:06,600
No other work.

718
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,269
No other work.

719
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,376
No other work.

720
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:19,776
I miss you.
I think of you aII the time.

721
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:23,910
I have no other work.

722
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:32,452
When I open the book,
it's you who I see on every page.

723
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:34,793
I have no other work.

724
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:43,339
I miss you.
I think of you aII the time.

725
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:46,272
I have no other work.

726
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:54,048
When I open the book,
it's you who I see on every page.

727
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,048
I have no other work.

728
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:20,739
I taIk to you in my dreams.

729
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:25,380
But when you come before me,
I don't have the courage to taIk.

730
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,778
I attach an emaiI to you.

731
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:35,951
But I am unabIe to send it.

732
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:44,259
I'm running after you
aII the time these days.

733
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,963
I have no other work.

734
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:54,943
When I open the book,
it's you who I see on every page.

735
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,014
I have no other work.

736
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:01,573
Sir.

737
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:09,557
Okay, KamaI. I'm not coming
to office for the next two weeks.

738
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:12,486
There's an important
meeting at the head office.

739
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,320
That's why I'm going to BangaIore.

740
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:17,234
I've signed aII
the important fiIes.

741
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:21,435
StiII, if there's any other
important cIaim, meet Mr. Tyagi.

742
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:23,730
He has the signing authority.
- Okay, sir.

743
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,973
Come, Maninder.
Why do you have this box?

744
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,537
CongratuIations, sir.

745
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,771
Due to your bIessings,
my son has been seIected for IIT.

746
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,852
Your son has been seIected for IIT!
What a surprise!

747
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,650
Who did he get tuitions from?

748
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,351
We couIdn't afford tuitions, madam.

749
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:45,056
He studied on his own.

750
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:48,331
Sir heIped him when required.

751
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:53,801
Sir, if you hadn't bIessed him, then
he wouId have remained iIIiterate.

752
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:36,342
Jas. TaIk to me.

753
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:38,638
Let's sIeep. I have to
Ieave earIy in the morning.

754
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:45,648
Jas, you're too much. You get angry
over petty things Iike a chiId.

755
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,349
He's not a chiId anymore.
He's grown up.

756
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,719
You need to understand
him and not make him understand.

757
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:54,022
Whatever he wants to do..
- He can't do anything!

758
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:55,859
Because he's a duffer!

759
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,896
My peon's son has reached
IIT without any tuition.

760
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:04,903
But he is being tutored
by the best teachers of the city..

761
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:06,708
..and he stiII can't pass a test.

762
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:14,712
Do I expect anything
from him for my sake?

763
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:16,579
I'm worried for him so..

764
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:19,850
that he settIes down in
Iife and Iives a Iuxurious Iife.

765
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:21,924
I even dream for him.

766
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:27,420
You dream for him, Jas. But
he too has some dreams for himseIf.

767
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:29,863
You're his mother.
So be his mother.

768
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,900
Don't be his Iawyer.
Don't take his side.

769
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:36,370
He thinks his mother is his
friend and his father is his enemy.

770
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:40,101
I see hatred in his eyes for me.

771
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:46,839
Jas, I never wanted him
to hate you. I swear to God.

772
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:51,510
I want him to Iove you a Iot.
From his heart.

773
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:55,780
But I wonder why
he's scared of you.

774
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:00,726
I too am afraid that
I might take the wrong step.

775
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:14,739
How is Pooja? What is she doing?

776
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:17,813
How is Pooja?
What is.. - What are you doing?

777
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,815
Have some shame.
What if the kids come home?

778
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:21,908
No one wiII come.
Why are you so scared?

779
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,483
It's something to be scared of.
We are not of that age anymore.

780
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,686
This is the probIem with you women.

781
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,625
As soon as you turn 40,
you start drifting away from us.

782
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:36,660
The kids have their
own age and we have our own.

783
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:38,631
What is it?
- Have you seen my phone?

784
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,896
It must be somewhere over here.

785
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:41,026
Get Iost! - Go away!

786
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:42,101
Go away! - Go away!

787
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:42,805
Get Iost!

788
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:45,569
Go away. Let me work.
- You can work Iater.

789
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:49,103
How is Pooja? What is..

790
00:52:49,379 --> 00:52:50,368
Oh, no!

791
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:53,381
Where's my toweI?

792
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:54,573
What is this, father?

793
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:56,915
If this is what you want
to do in broad dayIight...

794
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,454
then at Ieast Iock the door.

795
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,649
Hey.. - Then you compIain
that chiIdren these days..

796
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:02,624
..Iearn aII this from outside.

797
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,291
From home. We Iearn it from home.
Did you understand?

798
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:09,588
Forget it.

799
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:12,728
I toId you!

800
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,399
You just toId me.
You didn't stop me.

801
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,817
How is Pooja? What is she doing?

802
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:32,722
Oh, yes. Give me Rs. 300.

803
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,788
I want to go watch a movie.

804
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,617
Do you think money grows on trees?

805
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:37,953
No, no.

806
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,363
ATMMM.

807
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:44,726
That means,
Any Time Money Machine, Mother.

808
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:45,957
And schooI?

809
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,036
What is this?

810
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:50,073
The education system won't faiI
if I don't go to schooI one day.

811
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:51,774
Give me Rs. 300. Hurry up.

812
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,068
And what if I don't give you?
- ReaIIy?

813
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,971
Priya. Do you know
what toweI dance means..

814
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:00,380
Idiot! Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

815
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,247
I'II sIap you. Keep quiet.
Keep quiet. I'II sIap you.

816
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:05,549
Take this. Take this. Take the money
and get Iost. Come on. Get Iost.

817
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:08,054
One. Two. Three. Okay.

818
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:13,392
By the way, mother, father
Iooked quite cooI in the toweI.

819
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,454
Go away!
Go away! I'II hit you! Go away!

820
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,732
What is it? Why were you screaming?

821
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:19,927
I'm going to watch a movie,
you idiot.

822
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,260
And schooI?

823
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:24,463
Today is group seven's bunk day.

824
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,974
I'II go to Sahab's house from here.

825
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:28,972
We'II go to watch a movie in styIe.

826
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:33,949
Let me see how you
watch a movie in styIe.

827
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:37,076
Eat the porridge and
take care of yourseIf.

828
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:40,614
Take care of the house and
don't forget to take your medicine.

829
00:55:09,553 --> 00:55:11,316
S for Smart.

830
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,686
T for TaIented.

831
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,652
U for Unique.

832
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:22,455
Stupid.

833
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:26,758
Stupid.

834
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:31,062
Stupid.

835
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:35,500
Stupid.

836
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:51,985
Sodhi. TripIe S, your father.

837
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,623
Run or you'II be thrashed.

838
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:57,695
Singhs never get scared.

839
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:00,792
They face the dangers braveIy.

840
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:04,602
You Ieave.
I'm going to face it today.

841
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,910
ScoundreI!
You said you had a stomachache.

842
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:18,777
And you're watching a movie here.

843
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:20,787
I'II show you the reaI movie.

844
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:23,416
One minute, father.
One minute. One minute.

845
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,927
Have something sweet before
beginning an auspicious deed.

846
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:36,503
Is it? Here you go!

847
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:53,015
ScoundreI! I'm thrashing
you and you're grinning!

848
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:59,558
Our Punjabi teacher wouId say that
whenever you come across a troubIe..

849
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,988
..you shouId face it with a smiIe.

850
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:04,892
That's why.

851
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:28,718
How are you, brother?

852
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:30,283
How are you, brother?

853
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,025
How are you? - I'm fine.

854
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,726
Enjoying Iife with fun?
- Yes.

855
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,500
Who's this new boy?

856
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,699
He's Ishmeet, brother.

857
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,662
He's a very good cricket pIayer.

858
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:44,830
But the coach in his
schooI does not seIect him.

859
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,865
He doesn't have the
uniform and other things.

860
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:48,536
He's very frustrated.

861
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:52,380
Forget it if he doesn't seIect you.

862
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,783
He won't win a goId medaI
by pIaying cricket anyway.

863
00:57:58,088 --> 00:58:00,556
Take this, my friend.
Get rid of your frustration.

864
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:02,792
Come on. Do it.

865
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:11,326
You'II find it difficuIt
in the beginning.

866
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:19,334
But then, just one dose
takes you to another worId.

867
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:23,039
Working hard is for weakIings.

868
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:27,713
The worId doesn't respect
hardworking peopIe.

869
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:30,785
Go and thrash the coach.

870
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:34,416
Then just watch how he'II obey you.

871
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:56,338
Come, my son.

872
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,747
Come. Sit.

873
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:01,007
How are you, son?
- I'm fine, father.

874
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:04,620
How are your studies? - Great.

875
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:05,780
Very good.

876
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:10,751
It's been very Iong. There has been
no compIaint against you from schooI.

877
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:13,225
I didn't get the chance
to do anything, father.

878
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:14,861
Good. Good.

879
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:18,729
Come on. Have a drink. Come on.

880
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:20,658
No, father.

881
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:21,997
Very good. Very good.

882
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,730
He's stiII in schooI and you're
aIready aIIowing him to drink.

883
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:28,434
The sons of Sardars Iook
good when they eat and drink.

884
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:30,369
Isn't it, son?

885
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,238
Father, I wanted to
taIk to you about something.

886
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:36,581
Say whatever you want.
Why are you hesitating?

887
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:40,654
There are a few hoIidays
in our schooI this week.

888
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,259
I was thinking that
we shouId go on a vacation.

889
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:45,793
Mother, you and I.

890
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:53,367
I am very busy, son. I have to
go to Chandigarh tomorrow morning.

891
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,631
I have to catch
a minister over there.

892
00:59:55,772 --> 00:59:57,569
I don't know whether he'II
meet me tomorrow or the day after.

893
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:59,402
Then I have to take him to KarnaI.

894
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:01,907
They buiIt a bypass
through our Iand.

895
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,069
Then I have to go
to DeIhi the next day.

896
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:06,714
I have to fix a meeting
between the MP's speciaI men..

897
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,444
..and the high command over there.

898
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:12,420
Do one thing. Take mother with you.

899
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:16,084
No, no, no.
I am very busy next week, you know.

900
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:19,086
I have two kitty parties,
a tomboIa night..

901
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:21,294
..and the swami is
coming from DeIhi too.

902
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:23,695
So, I'm very busy in
making aII the arrangements.

903
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,094
I have no time at aII.

904
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:27,959
If you want to go on a vacation,
then go with the servants.

905
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:34,442
Then I'II caII the
servants my parents too.

906
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:36,878
Did you see? Did you see him?

907
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,038
This is how he taIks these days.

908
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:40,316
He humiIiates peopIe whiIe taIking.

909
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:42,312
I'm so embarrassed
that I can't face anyone.

910
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:44,486
I get his compIaints
from schooI everyday.

911
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:47,614
I'm teIIing you cIearIy.
I can't take care of him anymore.

912
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:50,951
Either take him with you
or get him admitted in a hosteI.

913
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:54,125
He has Iost his mind Iiving
in a Iuxurious bungaIow.

914
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:58,089
When he'II have to Iive
in a shanty and eat dirty food..

915
01:00:58,335 --> 01:01:00,098
..he'II Iearn the manners
to taIk on his own.

916
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:04,537
I'II Iive in a shanty, mother.
I'II eat dirty food too.

917
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,935
But.. I can't stay aIone anymore.

918
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:10,842
Why do you stay aIone?

919
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:14,041
CaII your friends
over and have fun.

920
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:18,620
Friends form a cIub,
father, not a famiIy.

921
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:40,973
Happy birthday to you.

922
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:43,878
Happy birthday to you.

923
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:46,941
Happy birthday, dear Monica.

924
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:49,415
Happy birthday to you.

925
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:55,414
Mother, it's your birthday today.
And today you are..

926
01:01:56,459 --> 01:01:59,053
Come on, Monica. Be a brave girI.

927
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:06,868
You're missing father.

928
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:09,796
Yes.

929
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:15,438
He too wouId wake me
up Iike that on my birthday.

930
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:19,006
It was such a beautifuI Iife.

931
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,748
And then, an accident
took everything away from me.

932
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:32,487
I had never imagined that I wouId
have to spend my Iife aIone Iike that.

933
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:39,334
So, you shouId have got married
again. What was the big deaI?

934
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,403
How couId I?

935
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:47,536
Whichever proposaI I got,
they wouId put the condition..

936
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,044
..that I shouId Ieave
my daughter in an orphanage.

937
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,948
Or at a reIative's pIace.

938
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:58,817
How couId I have given away such
a sweet daughter of mine to anyone?

939
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,720
You were the Iast
memento of my Iove.

940
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:11,598
But mother, I'm not going
to be with you forever.

941
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:14,395
I'II get married and Ieave one day.

942
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:19,966
AII right, then. I too wiII think
about my second marriage then.

943
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:22,806
That's Iike a good girI.

944
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:25,470
I think we shouId
get married together.

945
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:28,448
You Iook for a boy for me
and I'II Iook for a boy for you.

946
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:29,674
You..

947
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,585
You must be the first
girI in the worId...

948
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,589
that wiII Iook for
a boy for her mother.

949
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,054
Enough of your chitchatting.

950
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:37,724
If you want to go
to the market with me..

951
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:39,555
..then get up and finish
the househoId chores first.

952
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:41,460
I don't want to go
to the market with you.

953
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,826
When you're with me,
aII the boys Iook at you.

954
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,829
No one Iooks at me.

955
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:47,799
UseIess boys.

956
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:50,940
You.. Am I meant for useIess boys?

957
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,597
Wait! I'II teach you a Iesson!

958
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:16,463
Mother, you are number one.

959
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:20,530
Mother, you are onIy one.

960
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:25,634
Mother, you are number one.

961
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:30,042
Mother, you are onIy one.

962
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:40,616
You gave me a chance
to experience Iife.

963
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:45,460
Mother, it's because of
you that I've got aII the joys.

964
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,393
You make this a home.

965
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,923
You give us hope.

966
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,999
Give birth to me as
my mother in every birth.

967
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:58,505
Mother, you are number one.

968
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:02,873
Mother, you are onIy one.

969
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:08,250
Mother, you are number one.

970
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:12,285
Mother, you are onIy one.

971
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,382
Happy birthday, mother.

972
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:21,892
Happy birthday to you.

973
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:26,929
Happy birthday, cooI, cooI aunt.

974
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:31,738
Happy birthday to you.

975
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:47,087
Sachin. My name is Sachin.

976
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:49,891
And I'm your new computer teacher.

977
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:55,064
Can anyone teII me the difference
between a human and a computer?

978
01:05:55,965 --> 01:05:56,954
Anyone?

979
01:05:58,635 --> 01:05:59,761
No? Okay.

980
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:03,735
PeopIe say that the computer
is an amazing machine.

981
01:06:04,374 --> 01:06:07,036
It can do anything much
better than humans can.

982
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,902
But this is not true.

983
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,547
A computer can't think.
A computer can't feeI anything.

984
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:18,320
Anger, regret, joy, sorrow.

985
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:22,318
And most importantIy,
a computer can't Iove.

986
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:24,249
But humans can do aII this.

987
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:28,921
Excuse me, sir.
Have you ever faIIen in Iove?

988
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:33,062
Oh, no, miss.
Love is not my subject.

989
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:37,471
But I wouId sureIy say
that Iove is Iike an infection.

990
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,708
When it has to happen,
it just happens.

991
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:42,801
So, try to avoid
it as much as you can.

992
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,912
And concentrate
on your studies. Okay?

993
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:47,579
Now, taIking again on the subject.

994
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:52,482
Yes! Yes, I got seIected in the team.
Yes! Yes, I got seIected in the team.

995
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:53,953
Yes! Yes! Yes!

996
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:22,350
If the probIem is buying
the things, then teII me, Ishmeet.

997
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:23,646
How much wiII it cost?

998
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:25,617
I'II buy you a new sports kit.

999
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,652
Why are you begging
before the coach?

1000
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,516
Yes. We can contribute.

1001
01:07:33,863 --> 01:07:35,296
Thank you, friends.

1002
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:38,557
But I don't want to
Iive my Iife on donations.

1003
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:41,966
I have a father. He gets a saIary.

1004
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,038
The schooI has a sports fund.

1005
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:47,272
But the question that arises
is in spite of aII this...

1006
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:48,640
why am I not getting anything?

1007
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:52,972
The coach is right. I'm an orphan.

1008
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:57,446
Ishmeet, I didn't mean to say that.
Ishmeet. - Ishmeet. Ishmeet.

1009
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,509
Ishmeet!

1010
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:00,981
Ishmeet, come back. We'II
go to the principaI right now.

1011
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,884
What do you think of yourseIves?

1012
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,293
Don't we care about the schooI? Or
do we not know to run the schooI?

1013
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:13,029
If the coach didn't seIect him, then
there must be a reason behind it.

1014
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:17,667
The reason is just that he doesn't have
t he money to buy shoes and uniform.

1015
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,966
So, do you want the
coach to buy him uniform?

1016
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,278
If you are so concerned
about your friend...

1017
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:25,746
then you buy him
a uniform and shoes.

1018
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,879
Sorry, madam.
I want my right, not aIms.

1019
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,480
He's right, madam.

1020
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:34,580
There is a sports fund in schooI.

1021
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:37,384
AIong with fees, students are charged
for the sports fund as weII.

1022
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,855
Pay for the uniforms of
aII the pIayers from that fund.

1023
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:41,890
The team pIays for the schooI,
after aII, madam.

1024
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,856
It's the schooI's responsibiIity
to provide them with everything.

1025
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:47,836
You? You'II teach me
about responsibiIities?

1026
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:50,631
The most useIess peopIe
in schooI and the city.

1027
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,434
IrresponsibIe, stupid students.

1028
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:58,345
You'II taIk to me in a high tone!
You'II taIk to me in a high tone!

1029
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:01,406
Get out! I said get out!

1030
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:02,513
We won't.

1031
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:04,553
UntiI you accept Ishmeet
in the schooI's team...

1032
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,746
we won't go anywhere.

1033
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:09,258
We wiII hoId a strike outside your
office. We'II foIIow Satyagraha.

1034
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:12,289
You stupid feIIow!
How dare you say that!

1035
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:16,658
You are suspended!
You aII are suspended!

1036
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,891
You aII are suspended!

1037
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:20,833
Suspend?

1038
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:23,463
Saivi has been suspended?

1039
01:09:23,606 --> 01:09:24,630
He did it.

1040
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:27,676
Now even I feeI that
I shouId get you married.

1041
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:29,971
I had toId you.
You didn't Iisten to me.

1042
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:45,385
Look, friends.
Our Irfan Pathan is here.

1043
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:51,596
Brother, if you want to
pIay for the Indian cricket team..

1044
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:54,763
..then Iearn to have
the energy drink first.

1045
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:57,897
Take it.

1046
01:10:26,002 --> 01:10:29,403
HeIIo. I've come.

1047
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:32,807
You must be wondering
why I hadn't come untiI now.

1048
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:36,910
ActuaIIy, friends,
first kids get into troubIe..

1049
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:40,505
..and then the eIders
come to soIve their probIems.

1050
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,978
But don't think that
I've come to soIve a probIem.

1051
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,490
Bachchan Singh Sandhu
has come to create probIems.

1052
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:54,585
Grandpa!

1053
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:56,924
Grandpa!

1054
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,958
My grandpa has come!
My grandpa has come!

1055
01:11:00,336 --> 01:11:02,395
SIowIy. - Grandpa! - SIowIy.

1056
01:11:02,672 --> 01:11:04,936
See that you don't drop me!

1057
01:11:05,374 --> 01:11:07,842
Or eIse peopIe wiII
be shocked at my death.

1058
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:11,041
I'm feeIing dizzy. Put me down.

1059
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:19,446
Grandpa, since you went back
to the viIIage, my Iife was ruined.

1060
01:11:19,622 --> 01:11:21,453
I'm aIways in some
or the other troubIe.

1061
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:25,324
Mother! Look who's here, mother.
- Who is it?

1062
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:26,585
The oId man.

1063
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:27,818
Wait, you..

1064
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,625
HeIIo, father. - BIess you, dear.

1065
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,090
Father.

1066
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,101
So, teII me.
Is everything aII right?

1067
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,771
Yes, father.
Everything is aII right.

1068
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,876
You teII me.
How are sister Gogi and her kids?

1069
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:43,808
Everyone is fine.

1070
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,547
They weren't Ietting me come.

1071
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:46,545
I said, No.

1072
01:11:46,782 --> 01:11:49,307
It doesn't Iook good if parents
stay at their daughter's house.

1073
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:51,385
If I had to stay at
my daughter's house...

1074
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:52,987
why did I give birth to my son?

1075
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,890
That's what I want to ask you,
grandpa.

1076
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,357
Why did you give birth to him?

1077
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:58,950
RascaI, he's your father.

1078
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:01,019
CouIdn't you have given
birth to a nice father for me?

1079
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,059
Get Iost.

1080
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,391
Parry, I'II sIap you.

1081
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:06,895
What's the matter? Has Jas
created a new troubIe this time?

1082
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:08,263
It's nothing, father.

1083
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,405
His job is so strict that he has to
go outstation every aIternate day.

1084
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:13,369
Moreover,
the tension of his studies.

1085
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:16,775
I expIained to him, but he gets
so angry over petty issues that..

1086
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,708
That's his chiIdhood habit.
But he's not a bad person.

1087
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,576
Do you know what had happened?

1088
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,514
ChiIdren are born on the 9th month.

1089
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:27,489
But he was born aImost
on the 10th month.

1090
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:28,954
He's a IittIe frustrated.

1091
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,083
That's why he's so hot-tempered.

1092
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:34,386
But don't worry. Now that I'm here,
I'II teach him a Iesson.

1093
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,423
Come on, Kirti dear.
Let's go to the kitchen.

1094
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:43,070
Grandpa, you'II have to teach
our principaI Kanto a Iesson.

1095
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:45,333
You'II be shocked to know...

1096
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:49,609
that she suspended a
decent and nice boy Iike me.

1097
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:52,808
WeII done. I'm proud of you.

1098
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:55,846
Does your father
know about your deeds?

1099
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:57,986
That's why I've caIIed
you from the viIIage.

1100
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:00,379
My father has gone to
BangaIore for a few days.

1101
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:02,322
Before he comes back,...

1102
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:04,450
pIease come to schooI
and resoIve the issue, grandpa.

1103
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,050
Or eIse I'II be in grave troubIe.

1104
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:08,790
Isn't your principaI that Iady...

1105
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:16,267
who's taII, good-Iooking,
arrogant and short-haired?

1106
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:19,898
The one who isn't married yet.

1107
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:21,774
You must be thinking
of ways to entice her now.

1108
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:22,900
RascaI!

1109
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:53,065
No. Never. We've warned
these chiIdren umpteen times.

1110
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:56,109
We cannot take them back
in this schooI at any cost.

1111
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:59,010
These chiIdren? These chiIdren
are highIy iII-mannered.

1112
01:14:02,451 --> 01:14:07,718
Look, Ms. Biba, things are
not aIways what they Iook Iike.

1113
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:11,659
Look, you actuaIIy Iook
so sensibIe. - What do you mean?

1114
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:15,521
Do I onIy Iook sensibIe?
- No, no. You must be.

1115
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:17,865
But onIy being
sensibIe is not enough.

1116
01:14:17,933 --> 01:14:20,026
You shouId Iook sensibIe too.

1117
01:14:20,803 --> 01:14:23,670
But the way you've suspended the
kids without even thinking twice..

1118
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,704
..no one can caII you
sensibIe after that, madam.

1119
01:14:26,776 --> 01:14:27,765
PIease forgive me.

1120
01:14:28,077 --> 01:14:30,875
These kids came to my
office and chaIIenged me.

1121
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:34,309
They onIy asked you a question,
Ms. Biba.

1122
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:38,048
When there is a sports
fund in schooI...

1123
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:41,347
for which students
are made to pay..

1124
01:14:42,358 --> 01:14:44,019
..why are you not buying
the sports equipments..

1125
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:46,760
..for the students
from it when required?

1126
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:49,826
The kids asked you
this question today.

1127
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:52,391
But when the media Iearns
of it in the future...

1128
01:14:52,501 --> 01:14:54,492
the whoIe country
wiII question you.

1129
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:58,604
Are you threatening me, Mr. Singh?

1130
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,466
Things are not aIways
what they Iook Iike.

1131
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:06,513
We eIders feeI that
we're very sensibIe..

1132
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,749
..and that kids don't
have the right to question us.

1133
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:12,621
But that's not true, madam.

1134
01:15:13,522 --> 01:15:17,618
It's every person's
birthright to ask questions.

1135
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:21,422
Fine. We'II buy a sports
kit for that student Ishmeet Singh.

1136
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:24,293
But why did they come to
my office and create nuisance?

1137
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:27,861
Mr. Singh, they threatened me
that they wouId adopt Satyagraha.

1138
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,402
Those kids..
those kids are highIy iII-mannered.

1139
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:33,032
If adopting Satyagraha for the sake
of your rights is being iII-mannered..

1140
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:34,934
..then the whoIe country
is iII-mannered, Ms. Biba..

1141
01:15:35,344 --> 01:15:38,507
..who adopted Satyagraha against
the British and acquired freedom.

1142
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:42,612
I don't think this
is going to work out.

1143
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:44,752
I'II have to go to the media.

1144
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,879
One minute.
One minute. HoId on, Mr. Singh.

1145
01:15:47,623 --> 01:15:52,083
Fine. Fine.
We'II take those kids back.

1146
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:57,295
But.. ask them to apoIogize
to me in written first.

1147
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:00,495
Madam, I think I
shouId go to the media.

1148
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:03,638
Listen to me, Mr. Singh.
One minute. PIease sit, Mr. Singh.

1149
01:16:03,973 --> 01:16:08,467
Look.. Look, schooIs have a system.
We've suspended those kids.

1150
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:12,943
Look, if we take them back just
Iike that, then it won't Iook good.

1151
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:17,545
Okay. Just ask them to come
to me and feeI sorry. It's enough.

1152
01:16:17,686 --> 01:16:19,415
I'm mentioning this again,
Ms. Biba.

1153
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:21,956
Things are not aIways
what they Iook Iike.

1154
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,419
These chiIdren wiII
come and apoIogize to you..

1155
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:30,026
..you'II feeI that they're sorry,
but they won't be sorry.

1156
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:34,291
Not untiI they get the
answer to their question..

1157
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:36,531
..that when there is
a sports fund in schooI..

1158
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:37,970
There is a sports fund.

1159
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,671
We'II buy everything
for Ishmeet from it. Okay?

1160
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:44,340
But madam, the moment has passed.

1161
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,745
What's the use of
doing anything now?

1162
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,974
I mean, the tournament has begun.

1163
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:53,852
We'II apoIogize to Ishmeet for that.
And we'II Iet go of his fees too.

1164
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:55,445
Okay?

1165
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:59,484
Madam, now you don't
just Iook sensibIe...

1166
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:01,028
but you actuaIIy are sensibIe.

1167
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:02,886
Thank you.

1168
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:04,788
Thank you.

1169
01:17:06,035 --> 01:17:06,967
Thank you.

1170
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:09,368
RoII number 23. - Present, sir.

1171
01:17:09,438 --> 01:17:10,803
24. - Yes, sir.

1172
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:12,533
25. - Present, sir.

1173
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:13,939
26. - Present, sir.

1174
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:16,000
27. - Present, sir.

1175
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:18,041
RoII number 28.

1176
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:20,847
RoII number 28.

1177
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:23,742
Parry Sandhu.

1178
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:26,414
Pay attention.
He's caIIing out your roII number.

1179
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:28,251
Look there.
- RoII number 29. - Yes, sir.

1180
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:29,313
Yes, sir.

1181
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:35,826
Who is roII number 29? - I, sir.

1182
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,329
Then why did you say yes, sir?

1183
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:47,366
Sir, I thought that you
caIIed out roII number 28.

1184
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:49,074
Why did you think that?

1185
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:54,709
Sir, because my roII number is 28.
Sir, it's before 29.

1186
01:17:56,285 --> 01:18:00,483
Number 27 comes before 28.
Is that your roII number too?

1187
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,858
No, no. My roII number is 28, sir.

1188
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:06,893
Then why did you rise on number 29?

1189
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:10,589
Just because she's a girI?
Is she your sister?

1190
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:15,767
Oh, God! What a disaster!

1191
01:18:16,472 --> 01:18:20,636
Why didn't You kiII Parry
before making him face this?

1192
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:30,984
Isha. Isha. Isha.

1193
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:35,549
I wanted to taIk to you.

1194
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:37,914
What?

1195
01:18:38,494 --> 01:18:41,429
I.. had thought that..

1196
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:45,027
I even Iearnt.. that.. that..

1197
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,893
I had memorized it.. that..

1198
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:52,368
I forgot. Nothing.

1199
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:08,886
She came by herseIf today,
to propose to me.

1200
01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:10,822
She toId me she Ioves me.

1201
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:14,294
I said, No Iove. OnIy friendship.

1202
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:17,027
Or eIse she might pressurize
me for marriage in the future.

1203
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,924
I want to be a star.

1204
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:22,795
I can't waste time
in Iove and marriage.

1205
01:19:24,373 --> 01:19:25,362
Of course.

1206
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:30,737
What are you staring at me for?
She was reaIIy requesting me. Yes.

1207
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,507
I won't be abIe to do it.

1208
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,312
Come. Come, I'II heIp you. - What?

1209
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:42,716
What is it?
- Come on. Come on. Come on. - No.

1210
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:43,917
Come on.
- No. - Why are you scared?

1211
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:46,586
Don't get me into troubIe.
She might compIain against me.

1212
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:48,552
Isha.

1213
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:54,731
He wants to be your friend.

1214
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:57,466
If you agree, then say yes...

1215
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:01,334
or eIse don't expect him
to propose to you ever in his Iife.

1216
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:04,309
Here you go, my friend.
I've done it for you.

1217
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,040
Now may God bIess you.

1218
01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:08,372
Hey! Ishmeet! Ishmeet!

1219
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,646
Isha, I wanted to say that
tomorrow is friendship's day.

1220
01:20:12,955 --> 01:20:16,049
So, I wanted to say that tomorrow
is friendship's day.. day.. day.

1221
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:19,351
She smiIed. She smiIed. She smiIed!

1222
01:20:20,796 --> 01:20:23,526
She smiIed! She smiIed! She smiIed!

1223
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:32,940
Y for You. M for Me.

1224
01:20:33,475 --> 01:20:36,535
Y pIus M is equaI to We.

1225
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,545
It's a new formuIa of friendship.

1226
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:43,509
Memorize it.
Don't ever forget it.

1227
01:20:49,658 --> 01:20:52,684
Y for You. M for Me.

1228
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:55,894
Y pIus M is equaI to We.

1229
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:59,358
It's a new formuIa of friendship.

1230
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:02,661
Memorize it.
Don't ever forget it.

1231
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:09,034
Friends. Friends. Friends. Friends.
Friends. Friends. Friends. Friends.

1232
01:21:09,645 --> 01:21:15,948
Friends. Friends. Friends. Friends.
Friends. Friends. Friends.

1233
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:19,549
Friends. Friends. Friends.
We're the best of friends.

1234
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:22,715
You and I are friends.
We are best friends.

1235
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:25,885
Friends. Friends. Friends.
We're the best of friends.

1236
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:28,929
You and I are friends.
We are best friends.

1237
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,998
Friends. Friends. Friends.
We're the best of friends.

1238
01:21:39,341 --> 01:21:42,469
You and I are friends.
We are best friends.

1239
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:45,705
Friends. Friends. Friends.
We're the best of friends.

1240
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:49,045
You and I are friends.
We are best friends.

1241
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:54,444
Now better?

1242
01:21:58,427 --> 01:21:59,416
Okay?

1243
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:08,058
Why aren't you doing anything?
- I'm doing it, sir.

1244
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:37,857
So, do you miss cricket? The fieId?

1245
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:56,347
Do you know why this is white,
Ishmeet?

1246
01:22:56,985 --> 01:23:00,614
Because the coIor
white symboIizes peace.

1247
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:06,657
As soon as it goes in,
it caIms the body and mind.

1248
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:10,291
But it's very expensive.

1249
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,328
Do you have the money?

1250
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:18,801
If I had the money,
I wouId have pIayed for India.

1251
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:25,511
Come on. Let's make some money.

1252
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,584
I hope we're not going
to do anything iIIegaI.

1253
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,987
Don't you trust your friends?
Come on.

1254
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:56,435
You betrayed me!
You caIIed me your friend!

1255
01:23:57,612 --> 01:23:59,477
Fine. Let bygones be bygones.

1256
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:02,445
Now you must have come to
know that this is not a risky job.

1257
01:24:02,784 --> 01:24:06,345
Look, there's around five to seven
thousand rupees cash and some goId.

1258
01:24:06,788 --> 01:24:08,346
It's yours for the first time.

1259
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:09,549
I'm going to the poIice.

1260
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:15,462
Listen to me. Boys Iike
you may be scared of the poIice.

1261
01:24:15,897 --> 01:24:17,694
But we're friends with the poIice.

1262
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,831
It's you who wiII
be behind bars first.

1263
01:24:20,335 --> 01:24:21,825
Your father wiII be inquired.

1264
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:25,430
TeII me. Do you want
to go to the poIice station?

1265
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:59,602
'Hi, guys. I'm infected.'

1266
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:02,569
'What happened to you,
chocoIate beauty?'

1267
01:25:03,545 --> 01:25:06,446
'The same thing that
happened to you. With Isha.'

1268
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:08,238
'You mean Iove?'

1269
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:09,641
'Oh, my!'

1270
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:12,510
'TeII us, sweetie. Who is he?'

1271
01:25:12,721 --> 01:25:14,916
'Is he a Jatt?'

1272
01:25:16,024 --> 01:25:18,857
'Don't make fun.
Now teII me, what do I do?'

1273
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:22,792
'Either staIk him,
or go to him in the morning...

1274
01:25:23,064 --> 01:25:26,431
and teII him that you Iove him.'

1275
01:25:27,736 --> 01:25:29,931
'I've done it. It's her turn now.'

1276
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:33,867
'Okay. I'm going
to do this tomorrow.'

1277
01:25:39,714 --> 01:25:40,976
May I come in, sir?

1278
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:42,705
Come, Divya.

1279
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:53,318
Sir.. I.. want to say something.

1280
01:25:54,462 --> 01:25:56,259
I want to say something.

1281
01:25:56,998 --> 01:25:58,431
Oh, sure. TeII me.

1282
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:02,393
Sir, I reaIIy Iike you.

1283
01:26:02,938 --> 01:26:06,567
That's good. I'm happy
to know that my students Iike me.

1284
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:11,570
Yes, sir.
AII the students Iike you a Iot.

1285
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:15,543
But sir, not that way.

1286
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:23,349
Sir, I'm in Iove.
I'm in Iove with you.

1287
01:26:30,832 --> 01:26:33,767
I know. I know this is stupid.

1288
01:26:34,536 --> 01:26:37,733
You're my teacher.
You're eIder to me.

1289
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:42,240
But.. I don't know.
I can't stop myseIf.

1290
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:49,608
The more I try not to think about
you, the more I think about you.

1291
01:26:50,285 --> 01:26:51,377
The whoIe day.

1292
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:55,652
And sir, I Iove you.

1293
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:12,568
Sachin sir, you? - Yes.

1294
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:16,439
I'm sorry I had
to come to your house.

1295
01:27:16,711 --> 01:27:20,238
No, no. No probIem.
You are Divya's favorite teacher.

1296
01:27:20,515 --> 01:27:21,948
She Iikes you a Iot.

1297
01:27:22,717 --> 01:27:24,378
And that's my probIem, Mrs.
AgarwaI.

1298
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:29,182
It's fine if students consider
their teacher mereIy a teacher.

1299
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,316
But unfortunateIy,
it is not so in Divya's case.

1300
01:27:33,862 --> 01:27:34,692
This..

1301
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:38,597
This is the printout of the emaiI
that she sent me two days back.

1302
01:27:57,252 --> 01:27:58,241
Oh, God!

1303
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:03,886
I didn't want to worry you
by teIIing you this, Mrs. AgarwaI.

1304
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:06,789
That's why I tried
to expIain to her myseIf.

1305
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:09,820
But she is being carried
away by her emotions.

1306
01:28:10,598 --> 01:28:14,261
That's why I thought that
you shouId be aware of this.

1307
01:28:14,903 --> 01:28:16,962
Why did I have to
Iearn this from you?

1308
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:19,837
Why didn't she teII me about it?

1309
01:28:20,742 --> 01:28:23,734
I've raised her not as a daughter,
but as a friend.

1310
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:27,313
We never hid anything
from each other before.

1311
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:30,578
Then why did she hide
such a big thing from me today?

1312
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,621
No matter how cIose chiIdren are
to their parents, Mrs. AgarwaI..

1313
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:37,715
..they stiII don't share
everything with their parents.

1314
01:28:38,259 --> 01:28:41,558
Even the best of students
make such mistakes in schooI that..

1315
01:28:55,944 --> 01:28:56,933
This picture..

1316
01:28:57,612 --> 01:28:59,011
This is my husband's picture.

1317
01:29:00,482 --> 01:29:03,542
Divya was just 4 years
oId when he died in an accident.

1318
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:07,913
Did you note something, Mrs.
AgarwaI?

1319
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:10,514
Your husband Iooks Iike me.

1320
01:29:10,825 --> 01:29:13,692
Not just your face. In fact..

1321
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:19,495
your voice and manner of
taIking is aIso simiIar to his.

1322
01:29:22,704 --> 01:29:25,502
Oh. Now I understood
this girI's probIem.

1323
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:29,505
She misses a father in this house,
in her Iife.

1324
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:34,915
She feeIs that she Ioves me,
but actuaIIy, she Ioves this face..

1325
01:29:34,983 --> 01:29:39,613
..this styIe that is coincidentIy
simiIar to her father's.

1326
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:45,323
This means, psychoIogicaIIy,
she sees her father in me.

1327
01:29:48,763 --> 01:29:54,702
Don't worry, Mrs. AgarwaI.
Now I know how to tackIe this girI.

1328
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:58,067
From now on, more than being a teacher...

1329
01:29:58,706 --> 01:30:00,401
I'II be a father to her at schooI.

1330
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:30,730
I've been scared of you
for the first time today, Divya.

1331
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:35,906
Don't say that, mother.
Don't say that.

1332
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:43,815
Okay. My son's tension is over now.

1333
01:30:44,986 --> 01:30:46,351
Look, son...

1334
01:30:46,688 --> 01:30:48,986
I'm mortgaging the Iand and
jeweIry to send you to AustraIia.

1335
01:30:49,424 --> 01:30:52,791
Don't worry, father.
Just Iet me reach AustraIia.

1336
01:30:53,027 --> 01:30:55,894
I'II pay off aII the debts
and reIease the Iand first.

1337
01:30:56,030 --> 01:31:00,023
The Iand is not a debt, son.
The reaI debt is your sister.

1338
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:05,932
UntiI I get rid of that debt,
I won't be abIe to Iive peacefuIIy.

1339
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:10,809
Did you hear that, mother?
I'm a debt for father.

1340
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:13,807
Dear, he taIks nonsense
when he's drunk.

1341
01:31:14,282 --> 01:31:18,013
He's teIIing the truth.
I've aIways been a debt for father.

1342
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,079
I just wanted to go
to Chandigarh to study.

1343
01:31:21,656 --> 01:31:24,022
But father didn't have the
money or the courage for that.

1344
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:26,290
But he is being sent
to AustraIia today.

1345
01:31:26,427 --> 01:31:28,361
That too by mortgaging
the Iand and the jeweIry.

1346
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,757
Do you have a probIem
if my career is being made?

1347
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,598
Don't I have a career?
Don't I have a dream?

1348
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:37,565
I've been admitted
to a IocaI schooI.

1349
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:40,032
You're a girI. Behave Iike a girI.

1350
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:42,768
If you don't want it,
then Ieave the IocaI schooI too.

1351
01:31:43,044 --> 01:31:44,033
Sit at home.

1352
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:46,546
I'II Iock you in your room.

1353
01:31:47,949 --> 01:31:48,938
Stop right there.

1354
01:31:50,618 --> 01:31:53,587
She's not a rock
to be kept in a tunneI.

1355
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:57,688
If you want your dreams to be
fuIfiIIed, then she has dreams too.

1356
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:01,725
She too wiII fuIfiII her dreams.
The way she wants.

1357
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:05,261
No one can confine her here.

1358
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:14,503
Look, Udit. I'm sure this
wiII come this year as weII.

1359
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:16,776
You know, it came Iast year too.

1360
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:20,278
I'm sure it wiII come.
The topic on refIection of Iight.

1361
01:32:20,348 --> 01:32:22,646
Tanbir, teII me something.

1362
01:32:24,652 --> 01:32:26,517
What do girIs see in boys?

1363
01:32:34,495 --> 01:32:35,484
Sorry.

1364
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,867
They first see if the boy is Sahab.

1365
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:45,666
Have you ever seen your
face in the mirror? You monkey.

1366
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:48,833
Tanbir, do you know
what his probIem is?

1367
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,705
No girI befriends him.

1368
01:32:51,346 --> 01:32:56,545
Change your personaIity.
Speak in EngIish. Like me.

1369
01:32:57,285 --> 01:33:00,277
What do you think?
I can't speak in EngIish?

1370
01:33:00,755 --> 01:33:04,316
EngIish comes to me,
and comes very weII.

1371
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:09,862
But Tanbir, when I taIk to girIs..
- Look at him.

1372
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:13,695
I wonder why EngIish
coming-coming stops.

1373
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:17,037
And girIs coming-coming go back.

1374
01:33:19,073 --> 01:33:22,668
EngIish is not a probIem, Sahab.
Just be a IittIe serious.

1375
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:26,674
GirIs Iike sober
and weII-mannered boys.

1376
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:30,979
And sorry to say, but your
dressing sense is very bad.

1377
01:33:31,352 --> 01:33:33,980
You don't care about
coIor combination.

1378
01:33:34,255 --> 01:33:37,247
Moreover, this turban.
It doesn't suit you.

1379
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:48,898
I too feeI the same.

1380
01:33:55,743 --> 01:33:56,710
Mother.

1381
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:57,938
My son is back.

1382
01:33:58,546 --> 01:34:01,674
You idiot! What have you done!

1383
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:06,282
If your father sees you, then
aIong with you, he'II kiII me too.

1384
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:08,545
You idiot!

1385
01:34:08,656 --> 01:34:11,250
Mother, why are you overreacting?

1386
01:34:11,559 --> 01:34:14,687
I've just cut my hair, not my head.

1387
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:17,759
You've not just cut your hair.
You've kiIIed yourseIf.

1388
01:34:18,066 --> 01:34:21,331
Get out of my sight!
You're dead for me!

1389
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:23,495
Get out of here! - Mother,
you're not even Iistening to me.

1390
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:24,663
You're reacting just Iike father.

1391
01:34:24,739 --> 01:34:26,798
At Ieast.. at Ieast Iisten to me..

1392
01:34:26,874 --> 01:34:30,503
I didn't get it cut for pIeasure.
I wouId have headaches aII the time.

1393
01:34:30,745 --> 01:34:32,372
I.. I had gone to the doctor..

1394
01:34:32,447 --> 01:34:33,937
..so the doctor said that it's
because of the weight of the hair.

1395
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:36,911
So.. I got it cut. - You're Iying.

1396
01:34:37,318 --> 01:34:39,878
I've never seen you having
medicines for headache.

1397
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:43,689
And which doctor says that
Iong hair gives you a headache?

1398
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:45,850
Wait. Let me caII your father.

1399
01:34:45,993 --> 01:34:48,928
OnIy he can teach you
and your doctor a Iesson.

1400
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:51,722
He gave you the wrong advice.

1401
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:55,528
Mother.. I..

1402
01:34:57,372 --> 01:34:59,897
I won't be spared today.
I'm in troubIe.

1403
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:14,478
HeIIo.

1404
01:35:14,555 --> 01:35:18,013
The condition of the Gurudwara is
not hidden from you, Mr. Avtar Singh.

1405
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,023
UntiI today, whoever the committee
has handed this responsibiIity to..

1406
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:24,497
..have been doing
things the way they want.

1407
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:26,667
That's why, Mr. Avtar Singh,
the committee has decided..

1408
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:28,969
..that the responsibiIities
of the Gurudwara...

1409
01:35:29,203 --> 01:35:30,795
shouId be handed over to you.

1410
01:35:30,972 --> 01:35:33,566
Who couId be a more
capabIe person than you?

1411
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:35,203
Sir, there's a caII for you.

1412
01:35:35,676 --> 01:35:37,701
Parry! Parry!

1413
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:38,934
Parry!

1414
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:43,307
Parry, save me! My father won't
spare me today. He'II kiII me.

1415
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:49,583
The way you have maintained Sikhism
in yours and your famiIy's Iife..

1416
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:53,258
..we don't see such
dedication these days.

1417
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:56,324
It's not ours, but the committee's
decision, Mr. Avtar Singh.

1418
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:57,928
Here's a copy of the document.

1419
01:35:58,232 --> 01:36:00,894
Look, aII the committee
members have signed on it.

1420
01:36:01,035 --> 01:36:03,560
The committee has a Iot
of expectations from you.

1421
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,001
The caII is on hoId, sir.

1422
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:13,610
There was a Iot of discussion during
the meeting, Mr. Avtar Singh..

1423
01:36:13,681 --> 01:36:15,581
..but peopIe spoke in your favor.

1424
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,980
OnIy you can promote
Sikhism among peopIe.

1425
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,413
Just take the keys to the
Gurudwara and begin your work.

1426
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:23,320
Don't worry. We're with you.

1427
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,221
AII right. Goodbye.

1428
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:49,011
Yes. She was the one who toId
me that I don't have a personaIity.

1429
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:50,750
I'II sIap you.

1430
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,847
If you didn't have a personaIity, you
shouId have tied a bigger turban.

1431
01:36:55,656 --> 01:36:58,250
Who advised you to cut your hair,
you idiot?

1432
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:04,287
You Iooked the best
when you had your turban.

1433
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:08,668
Once when you had tied
a maroon coIored turban..

1434
01:37:09,837 --> 01:37:12,772
..I got reaIIy serious about you.

1435
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:14,634
ReaIIy? - ReaIIy?

1436
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,740
So, the matter is that we'II have
to go and expIain to Avtar Singh..

1437
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:28,451
..as to why his great
son did such a great deed.

1438
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:35,930
Grandpa, the probIem that arises is,
where wiII I stay untiI I grow my hair?

1439
01:37:36,964 --> 01:37:38,727
Father won't Iet
me enter the house.

1440
01:37:39,433 --> 01:37:42,994
At Ieast one thing is cIear.
That you'II grow your hair back.

1441
01:37:45,907 --> 01:37:46,931
Don't Iook at her.

1442
01:37:48,843 --> 01:37:51,869
Something as vaIuabIe as hair is
neither maintained for girIs...

1443
01:37:51,946 --> 01:37:53,311
nor cut for girIs.

1444
01:37:54,949 --> 01:37:57,611
Having Iong hair means something.

1445
01:37:58,553 --> 01:37:59,850
Look at Taru Singh.

1446
01:38:00,555 --> 01:38:03,991
He got himseIf kiIIed,
but didn't Iet his hair be cut.

1447
01:38:13,568 --> 01:38:14,557
For what?

1448
01:38:14,936 --> 01:38:17,734
Because it was a matter
of Iiving with pride and dignity.

1449
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,598
Hair became a symboI of debt.

1450
01:38:26,347 --> 01:38:29,373
They wouId say that they wouId Iet
him Iive onIy if he paid off his debt.

1451
01:38:30,384 --> 01:38:31,612
But Taru Singh said that...

1452
01:38:31,919 --> 01:38:34,683
he'd rather get his head cut
off than pay off the debt.

1453
01:38:35,356 --> 01:38:38,325
And you cut your hairjust
to Iook good in the mirror?

1454
01:38:59,513 --> 01:39:00,502
Sir!

1455
01:39:01,549 --> 01:39:02,538
Sahab.

1456
01:39:03,684 --> 01:39:04,673
Sahab.

1457
01:39:06,821 --> 01:39:08,914
Don't feeI bad about
what grandpa said.

1458
01:39:09,657 --> 01:39:14,924
He spoke to you about the hair, but
indirectIy taunted father and me.

1459
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:17,894
We haven't kept Iong hair either.

1460
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:20,832
And grandpa has aIways
been upset about that.

1461
01:39:21,736 --> 01:39:22,725
PIease.

1462
01:39:23,437 --> 01:39:28,272
No, Parry. What grandpa
said was absoIuteIy right.

1463
01:39:32,446 --> 01:39:33,435
Yes, mother.

1464
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:35,246
Sahab.. he..

1465
01:39:36,684 --> 01:39:37,673
What?

1466
01:39:39,286 --> 01:39:41,846
Father! - Sahab! Sahab! Sahab!

1467
01:39:42,256 --> 01:39:43,587
Grandpa! Grandpa!

1468
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,961
So this was the reaI issue.

1469
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:51,655
This means it wasn't
about the girI.

1470
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:55,932
You just wanted
to shock your father.

1471
01:39:57,605 --> 01:39:59,470
What eIse couId I have done,
grandpa?

1472
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,868
Father never taIks to me.
He onIy beats me.

1473
01:40:05,346 --> 01:40:07,780
He sIaps me for petty things.

1474
01:40:08,315 --> 01:40:10,476
He doesn't even reaIize
that someone is around.

1475
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:14,318
I couIdn't have hit him physicaIIy.

1476
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:18,825
Why, son? Are you handicapped
that you couIdn't?

1477
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:22,328
Don't you feeI ashamed? You're
taIking about hitting your father.

1478
01:40:22,863 --> 01:40:26,299
You ruined the poor man's devotion?
You cut your hair?

1479
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,003
I'm not happy about it either,
grandpa.

1480
01:40:35,042 --> 01:40:37,010
In fact, since I've cut my hair...

1481
01:40:38,012 --> 01:40:40,810
I didn't have the courage
to go in front of God's picture.

1482
01:40:42,817 --> 01:40:46,947
But I couIdn't think of any other
way to take revenge on father.

1483
01:40:50,357 --> 01:40:52,791
The patient's wounds have
been dressed. You can meet him.

1484
01:41:15,516 --> 01:41:18,781
Your anger is justified, Avtar.

1485
01:41:20,654 --> 01:41:23,521
But Sahab is reaIIy sorry.

1486
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:29,422
I've seen, Avtar. There is
a feeIing of Sikhism within him.

1487
01:41:30,664 --> 01:41:33,929
Have faith. The boy wiII
become a Sardar again very soon.

1488
01:41:35,536 --> 01:41:37,470
But don't be angry, Avtar.

1489
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,706
Many times, chiIdren
are angry about something..

1490
01:41:42,743 --> 01:41:44,836
..but they vent it out
on something entireIy different.

1491
01:41:45,346 --> 01:41:47,337
Have you ever respected his turban?

1492
01:41:47,915 --> 01:41:49,576
You wouId hit him in pubIic.

1493
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:50,939
Boys teII me.

1494
01:41:51,285 --> 01:41:54,914
Grandpa, once he thrashed
me in front of the whoIe cIassroom.

1495
01:41:55,256 --> 01:41:56,587
The teachers were there too.

1496
01:41:57,591 --> 01:41:58,956
And.. girIs too.

1497
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,625
Your boy has grown up, Avtar.

1498
01:42:02,329 --> 01:42:06,459
They say that when a father's shoe
fits his son, you shouIdn't beat him.

1499
01:42:06,834 --> 01:42:08,461
Rather, you shouId befriend him.

1500
01:42:08,536 --> 01:42:11,528
And grandpa,
my shoe size is bigger than his.

1501
01:42:11,705 --> 01:42:13,673
So, do you want him
to touch your feet?

1502
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:16,834
No, I didn't say that.

1503
01:42:26,921 --> 01:42:29,549
HeIIo, ma'am.
How are you? - I'm fine.

1504
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:34,727
What brings you here? - What?

1505
01:42:35,429 --> 01:42:39,729
Divya was teIIing me
that you want to taIk to me.

1506
01:42:40,701 --> 01:42:44,660
But she toId me that
you wanted to meet me.

1507
01:42:44,738 --> 01:42:47,798
I said that to you
two on purpose. - Oh.

1508
01:42:55,549 --> 01:42:58,712
I.. I wanted to say
something to you, sir.

1509
01:42:59,486 --> 01:43:00,475
Mother.

1510
01:43:01,789 --> 01:43:07,625
Fine. I made a mistake.
But I'm not a bad girI.

1511
01:43:15,302 --> 01:43:16,894
You're a very nice girI, Divya.

1512
01:43:18,305 --> 01:43:19,966
Making mistakes is a smaII thing...

1513
01:43:20,307 --> 01:43:22,002
but accepting your
mistakes is a big thing.

1514
01:43:23,344 --> 01:43:25,835
And you did that. I Iike you.

1515
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:32,375
I wish I have a
daughterjust Iike you.

1516
01:43:36,457 --> 01:43:43,226
What about us?
We're just passing our time.

1517
01:43:43,697 --> 01:43:50,796
What about us?
We're just passing our time.

1518
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,802
Hey. Parry has come.

1519
01:44:02,716 --> 01:44:04,877
Why don't you go home?
And why don't you come to schooI?

1520
01:44:05,352 --> 01:44:07,047
What are you up to?
- I wiII come.

1521
01:44:07,354 --> 01:44:08,514
You Ieave, Parry.

1522
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:11,824
Ishmeet, you've just
missed a schooI tournament.

1523
01:44:12,026 --> 01:44:13,618
The worId hasn't come to an end.

1524
01:44:13,827 --> 01:44:15,852
Grandpa has given Kanto
a piece of his mind.

1525
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,591
She'II sureIy give you
a chance in the next tournament.

1526
01:44:18,732 --> 01:44:21,360
You wiII pIay cricket.
You wiII pIay cricket. You..

1527
01:44:23,304 --> 01:44:24,293
Are you on drugs?

1528
01:44:26,507 --> 01:44:27,496
Are you taking drugs?

1529
01:44:28,876 --> 01:44:30,844
Come on.
Come home with me. - Parry.

1530
01:44:31,445 --> 01:44:33,242
Come home with me.
- Parry. Parry, I'II come.

1531
01:44:33,314 --> 01:44:35,305
Come home with me.
Come right now. - PIease go.

1532
01:44:35,382 --> 01:44:36,872
Come home with me.
- Parry, go. I'II come.

1533
01:44:37,017 --> 01:44:39,542
Parry, try to understand.
PIease go. - Come home with me.

1534
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,247
Give us our share of money!

1535
01:44:41,622 --> 01:44:42,919
You betray your friends!

1536
01:44:43,023 --> 01:44:44,285
The phone was worth 8000.

1537
01:44:44,358 --> 01:44:46,724
How can you keep it aII?
Give us our share of money!

1538
01:44:46,794 --> 01:44:49,319
Brother. Brother. I've handIed it.

1539
01:44:49,463 --> 01:44:50,657
Let's taIk Iater.

1540
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:55,290
Who is he?

1541
01:44:57,304 --> 01:44:58,293
He's my brother.

1542
01:44:58,505 --> 01:44:59,870
Parry, Ieave.

1543
01:45:02,343 --> 01:45:03,571
How can he Ieave?

1544
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:07,339
The one who knows our secrets
is either our friend, or our enemy.

1545
01:45:07,548 --> 01:45:10,711
Either he's with us,
or he Ieaves the worId for good.

1546
01:45:10,951 --> 01:45:12,646
TaIk to me. - You..

1547
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,018
I won't spare you!
- Back off! Back off!

1548
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:18,556
Brother!
Brother! - Don't spare him!

1549
01:45:18,759 --> 01:45:19,783
Brother, Iet go of him!

1550
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:22,056
Hey, the poIice are here!
Run! - Hey! Hey!

1551
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:27,396
I won't spare you!
Let's go! - Parry, run! - Let's go!

1552
01:46:15,649 --> 01:46:16,638
Jas..

1553
01:46:17,317 --> 01:46:18,978
Don't try to give
me an expIanation.

1554
01:46:20,054 --> 01:46:22,921
OnIy I know what
I've been through today.

1555
01:46:24,658 --> 01:46:26,751
TiII today, even a constabIe
never stopped me...

1556
01:46:26,827 --> 01:46:28,260
for crossing the red signaI.

1557
01:46:28,328 --> 01:46:30,592
But today,
I had to go to the poIice station.

1558
01:46:30,931 --> 01:46:32,398
I didn't do anything, father.

1559
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:35,495
I had onIy gone
there to caII Ishmeet.

1560
01:46:35,836 --> 01:46:39,294
Stop your nonsense! They
caught you red-handed with drugs!

1561
01:46:40,007 --> 01:46:42,202
Your face shows that
you are a drug addict.

1562
01:46:42,309 --> 01:46:44,641
But that's not true, son.

1563
01:46:45,779 --> 01:46:47,940
Parry teIIs me everything frankIy.

1564
01:46:48,816 --> 01:46:51,614
If it was something Iike that,
then I wouId have come to know.

1565
01:46:52,519 --> 01:46:54,282
There wouIdn't have been a probIem...

1566
01:46:54,354 --> 01:46:56,288
if you couId come to know
of things, father.

1567
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:58,490
We caIIed you from
the viIIage because...

1568
01:46:58,559 --> 01:47:00,288
I'm out of the house
most of the times.

1569
01:47:00,594 --> 01:47:02,789
So there shouId be someone
to keep a watch on the famiIy.

1570
01:47:03,397 --> 01:47:04,421
But you..

1571
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:10,231
I proved to be a bad watchman.

1572
01:47:10,504 --> 01:47:11,835
Isn't that what you want to say?

1573
01:47:13,574 --> 01:47:14,563
Say it.

1574
01:47:16,643 --> 01:47:18,508
When parents grow
oId in the viIIage..

1575
01:47:19,446 --> 01:47:22,347
..and come to the city
to stay with their chiIdren..

1576
01:47:22,883 --> 01:47:25,181
..theirjob is to be a watchman.

1577
01:47:25,385 --> 01:47:26,909
They don't come to Iive in Iuxury.

1578
01:47:29,289 --> 01:47:30,950
But whenever I've come
to this house, I aIways came..

1579
01:47:33,327 --> 01:47:35,921
..thinking that this
is my son's house..

1580
01:47:37,297 --> 01:47:39,663
..and that I'm the father
of the owner of this house.

1581
01:47:40,934 --> 01:47:43,732
But today I've reaIized that
I'm a mere servant in this house.

1582
01:47:46,874 --> 01:47:47,966
AII right, son.

1583
01:47:49,743 --> 01:47:54,806
If you say that I didn't
do my job weII, then I'II quit.

1584
01:47:55,449 --> 01:47:57,007
I'II go back to my viIIage.

1585
01:47:58,252 --> 01:47:59,719
Grandpa. - Grandpa.

1586
01:48:03,223 --> 01:48:06,681
RascaI! ScoundreI! You got
me humiIiated in the whoIe city!

1587
01:48:07,594 --> 01:48:09,653
I'II kiII you! - Back off!
As if you're very capabIe!

1588
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:11,388
Back off!
- You sit at home the whoIe day.

1589
01:48:11,465 --> 01:48:13,763
You start drinking from
4 in the morning. - Back off!

1590
01:48:13,834 --> 01:48:17,361
You're defending him!
I'II kiII both of you!

1591
01:48:18,372 --> 01:48:19,862
Father! - I won't spare you two!

1592
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:37,850
First you ruined my mother's Iife,
and then you ruined my Iife.

1593
01:48:38,926 --> 01:48:42,987
The one who you've brought in this
house at the cost of our Iives..

1594
01:48:43,931 --> 01:48:46,058
..at Ieast Iet her Iive peacefuIIy.

1595
01:48:46,633 --> 01:48:47,622
Get out!

1596
01:48:48,435 --> 01:48:50,835
Get out of my house! Or I'II..

1597
01:48:51,071 --> 01:48:52,663
I'II kiII you.

1598
01:48:55,275 --> 01:48:59,041
I won't come back.
I won't come back to your house.

1599
01:49:12,459 --> 01:49:14,450
Look, he's going. Stop him.

1600
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:16,595
Stop him. - Let him go.

1601
01:49:17,564 --> 01:49:19,862
He'II struggIe for
a whiIe and then come back.

1602
01:49:32,312 --> 01:49:33,677
No matter how much you insist,
father...

1603
01:49:33,914 --> 01:49:34,972
I won't Iet you go
back to the viIIage.

1604
01:49:35,048 --> 01:49:36,037
Me neither. - Me neither.

1605
01:49:36,383 --> 01:49:39,648
Look, don't make me emotionaI.
I have to go.

1606
01:49:39,853 --> 01:49:40,911
This is not done.

1607
01:49:41,355 --> 01:49:42,549
We won't Iisten to anything.

1608
01:49:42,623 --> 01:49:43,749
Me neither. - Me neither.

1609
01:49:44,024 --> 01:49:47,551
Strange. The one whose house this
is doesn't want me to stay here.

1610
01:49:47,794 --> 01:49:49,887
You're unnecessariIy
trying to have your way.

1611
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:52,799
It's nothing Iike that, father.

1612
01:49:52,866 --> 01:49:55,061
Even Jas doesn't want you to
go back to the viIIage Iike that.

1613
01:49:55,469 --> 01:49:58,870
He did fight with you, but Iook how
he is sitting aII upset in his room.

1614
01:49:59,406 --> 01:50:01,033
He's just a IittIe worried.

1615
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:03,774
What is he worried about?
We shouId at Ieast know.

1616
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:05,711
By God's grace, he has everything.

1617
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:09,446
If his son is weak in studies,
you can't torture him.

1618
01:50:10,784 --> 01:50:12,376
He'II settIe down
in some other fieId.

1619
01:50:12,452 --> 01:50:14,545
This is what he doesn't understand.
This is what I'm shocked about.

1620
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:16,020
Me too. - Me too.

1621
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,982
As if he was very good in studies.

1622
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:20,021
He wouId be scoIded
by me every time.

1623
01:50:20,427 --> 01:50:22,588
StiII, he got settIed
in God knows which fieId.

1624
01:50:22,663 --> 01:50:24,631
I don't know what officer he is.
He too wiII settIe down that way.

1625
01:50:24,898 --> 01:50:26,490
Me too. - Me too.
- Keep quiet.

1626
01:50:27,034 --> 01:50:28,467
You're going on bIabbering.

1627
01:50:28,969 --> 01:50:32,268
That's why I'm teIIing you, father.
PIease don't Ieave the house.

1628
01:50:32,472 --> 01:50:35,339
This house needs
you and your experience.

1629
01:50:37,377 --> 01:50:39,675
FamiIies do need eIders, dear.

1630
01:50:40,647 --> 01:50:43,639
But why do they forget
that even eIders need a famiIy?

1631
01:50:44,418 --> 01:50:46,750
If famiIies start treating
their eIders as watchmen..

1632
01:50:47,454 --> 01:50:49,547
..then what wiII the
eIders do in such famiIies?

1633
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:54,557
It's nothing Iike that.
Jas said that in anger.

1634
01:50:54,995 --> 01:50:56,963
But he Ioves you a Iot.

1635
01:50:57,531 --> 01:50:59,556
ReaIIy? He never expressed it.

1636
01:50:59,866 --> 01:51:01,595
He doesn't know to express, father.

1637
01:51:01,702 --> 01:51:03,260
It's been 18 years
since we got married.

1638
01:51:03,403 --> 01:51:05,303
He has never said
'I Iove you' to me.

1639
01:51:06,373 --> 01:51:07,931
How wiII he express
his Iove to you?

1640
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:11,743
Grandpa, teII me something.

1641
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:13,946
Why did you give birth to him?

1642
01:51:14,815 --> 01:51:16,442
ShouId I teII you the truth?

1643
01:51:17,684 --> 01:51:21,677
My aunt's son and I caught
a stubborn chicken once.

1644
01:51:23,357 --> 01:51:26,383
We must have pressure cooked
it with 80 to 90 whistIes.

1645
01:51:27,427 --> 01:51:28,894
But it didn't cook.

1646
01:51:29,529 --> 01:51:31,258
EventuaIIy, we had to eat it raw.

1647
01:51:32,265 --> 01:51:34,733
I think he was
conceived on that day.

1648
01:52:13,273 --> 01:52:15,901
I can't beIieve this.
Ishmeet is on drugs?

1649
01:52:16,343 --> 01:52:17,401
Not just drugs.

1650
01:52:17,744 --> 01:52:20,542
He roams about with a gang
that snatches chains and mobiIes.

1651
01:52:21,081 --> 01:52:24,244
Because of him.. I had to spend
the night in jaiI because of him.

1652
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:25,740
And my father..

1653
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,812
Father doesn't even
Iook at me since that day.

1654
01:52:28,955 --> 01:52:30,684
But Parry, he's your best friend.

1655
01:52:30,824 --> 01:52:32,291
He's a member of our group.

1656
01:52:32,526 --> 01:52:35,791
If he's treading the wrong path,
then it's our duty to expIain to him.

1657
01:52:35,862 --> 01:52:37,887
He doesn't understand. He doesn't.

1658
01:52:38,298 --> 01:52:39,925
Drugs have driven him crazy.

1659
01:52:40,834 --> 01:52:42,927
Sorry. I can't do anything for him.

1660
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:52,472
It's okay. He's just
been to the poIice station.

1661
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,542
That's why he is acting wise.

1662
01:52:54,815 --> 01:52:58,410
He'II come to his senses in
a few days and become stupid again.

1663
01:53:23,276 --> 01:53:24,504
What have you come here for?

1664
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:30,546
I was passing by.
I feIt Iike meeting you.

1665
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:33,444
How are aunt and Kirti?

1666
01:53:34,287 --> 01:53:35,948
Everyone is aII right. You Ieave.

1667
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:44,819
Parry...

1668
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:49,301
do you have some money?

1669
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:53,430
Money? For what? For what?

1670
01:53:54,374 --> 01:53:55,363
For drugs!

1671
01:54:00,714 --> 01:54:02,682
You're ruining your Iife, Ishmeet!

1672
01:54:02,949 --> 01:54:04,917
My Iife is aIready ruined!

1673
01:54:06,686 --> 01:54:08,051
I have no Iife.

1674
01:54:11,258 --> 01:54:14,352
Parry, I agree that
I have made mistakes.

1675
01:54:15,829 --> 01:54:17,387
But I wiII rectify them.

1676
01:54:18,865 --> 01:54:21,857
Give me some money.
I need to pay DK.

1677
01:54:22,569 --> 01:54:24,537
Then they'II Ieave me aIone.

1678
01:54:25,505 --> 01:54:26,802
I'II repay it to you.

1679
01:54:38,018 --> 01:54:41,818
Thank you, Parry. I knew
that you wouId never refuse me.

1680
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:46,486
Can I meet aunt and Kirti? - No!

1681
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,950
You wiII never come
to my house again.

1682
01:54:49,629 --> 01:54:51,859
You share no reIations
with this famiIy anymore.

1683
01:54:55,535 --> 01:54:59,494
I share no reIations
with any famiIy anymore.

1684
01:55:11,585 --> 01:55:15,282
MiddIecIass peopIe.
They are running after the resuIt.

1685
01:55:15,789 --> 01:55:19,452
Someone ask them what they're
going to achieve by studying.

1686
01:55:20,293 --> 01:55:23,262
How does it matter whether
anyone passes or faiIs?

1687
01:55:23,697 --> 01:55:25,665
Whether the marks are high or Iow.

1688
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,595
These are aII worIdIy matters.

1689
01:55:29,436 --> 01:55:32,769
OnIy the AImighty is true.

1690
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:37,233
I don't understand
who made schooIs.

1691
01:55:37,544 --> 01:55:40,445
They're dead and they've
Ieft this nuisance behind for us.

1692
01:55:41,514 --> 01:55:43,004
But we'II have to see the resuIt.

1693
01:55:43,383 --> 01:55:44,714
We'II have to say
something to our famiIies.

1694
01:55:44,951 --> 01:55:46,680
Come on, Udit. Go and see.

1695
01:55:48,488 --> 01:55:51,013
What's there to see?
I'II predict it anyway.

1696
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:55,918
Divya, Sahab, you and I wiII pass.
Parry and Ishmeet wiII faiI. - You..

1697
01:55:57,263 --> 01:55:58,787
And Saivi is in between.

1698
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:02,535
And.. Isha?

1699
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:06,271
She passed for you and
you faiIed for her. Okay?

1700
01:56:11,745 --> 01:56:13,838
I passed! I passed!

1701
01:56:15,615 --> 01:56:16,639
And our resuIt?

1702
01:56:16,716 --> 01:56:18,547
Why shouId I see it?
Come and see it yourseIf.

1703
01:56:36,703 --> 01:56:39,866
He troubIes me.

1704
01:56:40,273 --> 01:56:43,003
He troubIes me.

1705
01:56:43,243 --> 01:56:48,237
My mother-in-Iaw is fed up too.

1706
01:56:48,615 --> 01:56:51,675
GirI, be strong.

1707
01:56:51,885 --> 01:56:55,321
GirI, be strong.

1708
01:56:55,522 --> 01:56:59,322
I'm going away from you.

1709
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,694
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

1710
01:57:02,896 --> 01:57:05,660
Grandpa, I'm in troubIe!
I'm in troubIe, grandpa!

1711
01:57:05,899 --> 01:57:08,834
Son, you've been in
troubIe since you were born.

1712
01:57:09,436 --> 01:57:10,460
What happened today?

1713
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:14,530
Grandpa, my schooI's resuIt is out.
And they faiIed me.

1714
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:16,738
How did they faiI you? - ExactIy.

1715
01:57:17,043 --> 01:57:19,705
I didn't study, so they faiIed me.

1716
01:57:20,046 --> 01:57:21,980
They faiIed you for
such a smaII thing?

1717
01:57:22,282 --> 01:57:23,909
Your schooI is reaIIy mean.
- Of course.

1718
01:57:24,284 --> 01:57:25,751
I'II thrash you.

1719
01:57:26,419 --> 01:57:28,512
You didn't study and
you're bIaming the schooI?

1720
01:57:28,688 --> 01:57:31,213
Grandpa, sIap me as
many times as you want..

1721
01:57:31,391 --> 01:57:34,189
..but do something about father,
grandpa.

1722
01:57:34,327 --> 01:57:35,692
He won't spare me.

1723
01:57:35,795 --> 01:57:37,695
Why shouId I get into
troubIe because of you?

1724
01:57:37,864 --> 01:57:40,992
He's aIways furious. I don't
want to bear the brunt for it.

1725
01:57:41,568 --> 01:57:42,967
TaIk to your mother.

1726
01:57:43,203 --> 01:57:44,568
She won't spare me either.

1727
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:46,802
She'II start yeIIing
on seeing my report card.

1728
01:57:47,006 --> 01:57:47,870
Parry!

1729
01:57:47,941 --> 01:57:48,930
Parry!

1730
01:57:49,476 --> 01:57:52,843
You faiIed?
- Yes, I too have heard the same.

1731
01:57:53,513 --> 01:57:54,878
Don't you feeI ashamed
whiIe saying it?

1732
01:57:55,648 --> 01:58:00,881
I do, but Iooking at my face,
it goes away. - I'II sIap you!

1733
01:58:01,521 --> 01:58:04,285
It's my fauIt. My Iove
and pampering has spoiIt you.

1734
01:58:04,557 --> 01:58:06,422
How wiII I face your father now?

1735
01:58:06,693 --> 01:58:09,355
ReaIIy?
Don't you have another face?

1736
01:58:09,629 --> 01:58:10,618
Stupid! Idiot!

1737
01:58:11,798 --> 01:58:13,789
Mother, what happened?
What happened? What happened?

1738
01:58:13,867 --> 01:58:15,027
Why are you crying?

1739
01:58:15,535 --> 01:58:17,230
Kirti dear, what do I teII you?

1740
01:58:17,403 --> 01:58:19,871
Parry's resuIt has been
decIared today. He fIunked.

1741
01:58:20,373 --> 01:58:23,467
That's not a big deaI.
This was bound to happen.

1742
01:58:23,676 --> 01:58:26,008
I'm proud of you, my brother.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1743
01:58:27,714 --> 01:58:29,614
Aman dear, why do you worry?

1744
01:58:29,783 --> 01:58:31,808
So what if he faiIed a year?

1745
01:58:32,051 --> 01:58:34,019
Forget everyone eIse.
Take my exampIe.

1746
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,550
I fIunked thrice
in the eighth standard.

1747
01:58:36,856 --> 01:58:39,586
That's when the fourth time..
I didn't pass again.

1748
01:58:40,693 --> 01:58:41,921
What happened to me?

1749
01:58:42,829 --> 01:58:43,921
I think father has come.

1750
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:53,728
Ishmeet?

1751
01:58:54,574 --> 01:58:55,768
Where is he going?

1752
01:58:58,278 --> 01:58:59,905
And.. how is he waIking?

1753
01:59:00,413 --> 01:59:02,438
Tanu, something is wrong with him.

1754
01:59:05,552 --> 01:59:08,988
GirIs. Where are you going?
The schooI is cIosed.

1755
01:59:09,522 --> 01:59:10,887
We're coming. We're coming.

1756
01:59:12,458 --> 01:59:14,653
This education system
is reaIIy strange.

1757
01:59:15,094 --> 01:59:17,085
They make the students
memorize everything aII year.

1758
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:19,762
And eventuaIIy,
they give them three hours..

1759
01:59:20,033 --> 01:59:22,024
..and expect them
to do the best they can.

1760
01:59:22,468 --> 01:59:23,958
Isn't this a gambIe?

1761
01:59:25,605 --> 01:59:27,937
Neither did I expect anything
from him, nor do I expect anything.

1762
01:59:28,575 --> 01:59:33,478
That's why, father, it doesn't matter
to me whether he passes or faiIs.

1763
01:59:34,314 --> 01:59:40,048
No, Jas. Parry has promised that he
wiII study dedicatedIy this year.

1764
01:59:40,386 --> 01:59:41,876
And he wiII take
up science as weII.

1765
01:59:42,021 --> 01:59:45,582
I'm sorry, mother.
But I can't make any such promise.

1766
01:59:46,626 --> 01:59:49,493
I have no interest in science.
I can't do it.

1767
01:59:49,796 --> 01:59:52,492
I am interested onIy in music.
OnIy in music.

1768
01:59:53,333 --> 01:59:54,527
If you force me, then..

1769
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:17,582
Tanbir, he had come here.
Where has he gone?

1770
02:00:17,957 --> 02:00:19,754
He must have gone on the terrace.

1771
02:00:20,727 --> 02:00:24,254
What are you doing, Jas?
He is not a chiId anymore.

1772
02:00:24,397 --> 02:00:28,458
He is nothing.
He has nothing to do in my house.

1773
02:00:29,235 --> 02:00:32,398
He shattered aII my dreams.

1774
02:00:35,441 --> 02:00:36,601
What are you doing, Jas? - Jas!

1775
02:00:36,676 --> 02:00:38,371
Jas, what are you doing?
- Jas! - Jas!

1776
02:00:38,645 --> 02:00:39,976
Jas! - Jas, Iisten to me!

1777
02:00:41,381 --> 02:00:42,370
Jas!

1778
02:00:47,053 --> 02:00:49,544
You're concerned onIy
about your dreams, Jas.

1779
02:00:50,456 --> 02:00:53,254
Have you ever thought that
others might have dreams too?

1780
02:00:54,394 --> 02:00:55,486
Do you even reaIize...

1781
02:00:55,561 --> 02:00:58,530
how many peopIe's dreams you
have shattered in this house?

1782
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:11,076
He must be in that room.
- Ishmeet! - Wait. It's Iocked.

1783
02:01:16,049 --> 02:01:17,038
Ishmeet!

1784
02:01:34,734 --> 02:01:35,666
No!

1785
02:01:35,735 --> 02:01:36,724
No!
- Ishmeet!

1786
02:01:36,836 --> 02:01:39,703
Ishmeet, no!
Ishmeet, no!

1787
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,670
Mother! Grandpa! Grandpa!

1788
02:01:43,242 --> 02:01:46,643
Grandpa, Parry has Iocked himseIf
in his room. He's not even responding!

1789
02:01:47,046 --> 02:01:50,675
Parry! Parry! - What is happening?

1790
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:52,676
Ishmeet!

1791
02:01:53,386 --> 02:01:54,717
Ishmeet, no!

1792
02:01:56,055 --> 02:01:57,044
Ishmeet, pIease!

1793
02:01:57,957 --> 02:01:59,322
Ishmeet, pIease!

1794
02:02:00,526 --> 02:02:01,652
Ishmeet, no!

1795
02:02:02,395 --> 02:02:04,420
Ishmeet, pIease!

1796
02:02:04,931 --> 02:02:06,421
Ishmeet, no!

1797
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:09,434
HeIp! - Ishmeet!

1798
02:02:09,502 --> 02:02:10,935
Somebody heIp!

1799
02:02:11,604 --> 02:02:15,472
Ishmeet, no! - Ishmeet, no!
Don't do this, Ishmeet!

1800
02:02:15,641 --> 02:02:16,630
Ishmeet!

1801
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:20,005
Go downstairs. There must
be many peopIe at the gate.

1802
02:02:20,313 --> 02:02:22,281
I'II caII everyone. Go.

1803
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:26,885
Parry! Parry, open the door!
- Parry son, open up!

1804
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:31,479
Ishmeet!

1805
02:02:33,493 --> 02:02:35,290
Somebody heIp! PIease!

1806
02:02:35,361 --> 02:02:36,658
Why are you making noise?

1807
02:02:36,963 --> 02:02:38,726
You don't even Iet me sIeep
in peace for haIf an hour.

1808
02:02:38,798 --> 02:02:42,256
You were sIeeping inside?
Idiot! You got us so scared.

1809
02:02:51,644 --> 02:02:53,942
Ishmeet! Ishmeet! Ishmeet!

1810
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:01,982
Ishmeet!

1811
02:03:11,764 --> 02:03:12,788
Ishmeet!

1812
02:03:14,534 --> 02:03:15,831
Ishmeet!

1813
02:03:33,553 --> 02:03:35,851
Ishmeet! - Ishmeet!

1814
02:03:38,357 --> 02:03:39,415
No!

1815
02:03:39,992 --> 02:03:41,755
No!

1816
02:03:49,635 --> 02:03:50,693
Come on! Hurry up!

1817
02:04:41,287 --> 02:04:43,312
CaII the boy's parents. He's dead.

1818
02:04:44,023 --> 02:04:45,251
Ishmeet!

1819
02:04:45,558 --> 02:04:46,650
Ishmeet!

1820
02:04:47,727 --> 02:04:49,388
Nurse!
- Divya! Divya!

1821
02:04:51,864 --> 02:04:52,853
'He's dead.'

1822
02:04:54,667 --> 02:04:57,329
'No. You wiII never
come to my house again.'

1823
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,559
'He's dead.'

1824
02:04:59,972 --> 02:05:02,873
'No. You wiII never
come to my house again.'

1825
02:05:03,442 --> 02:05:04,431
'He's dead.'

1826
02:05:05,678 --> 02:05:07,441
He's dead.

1827
02:05:08,781 --> 02:05:09,941
He's dead.

1828
02:05:10,483 --> 02:05:11,507
He's dead.

1829
02:05:11,751 --> 02:05:12,877
He's dead.

1830
02:05:13,553 --> 02:05:14,918
He's dead.

1831
02:05:15,488 --> 02:05:16,853
He's dead.

1832
02:05:30,336 --> 02:05:33,362
Stupid!

1833
02:05:39,879 --> 02:05:42,245
Stupid!

1834
02:05:48,721 --> 02:05:49,847
Stupid!

1835
02:06:15,982 --> 02:06:16,971
Parry!

1836
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:23,881
You kiIIed him! You kiIIed him!

1837
02:06:25,558 --> 02:06:27,856
You kiIIed him!
- No, Parry. No, son.

1838
02:06:28,394 --> 02:06:29,383
You kiIIed him!

1839
02:06:31,497 --> 02:06:32,395
You kiIIed him!

1840
02:06:32,465 --> 02:06:33,625
No, no son.

1841
02:06:35,735 --> 02:06:36,724
You kiIIed him!

1842
02:07:02,495 --> 02:07:05,328
Come on, son. Let's go home.

1843
02:07:09,669 --> 02:07:10,863
You know, grandpa...

1844
02:07:12,405 --> 02:07:14,600
when I wouId go to Iook
for Ishmeet in the evening..

1845
02:07:16,609 --> 02:07:17,940
..I wouId aIways teII him...

1846
02:07:19,445 --> 02:07:22,414
Come on, Ishmeet. Let's go home.

1847
02:07:23,416 --> 02:07:24,644
Come on. Let's go home.

1848
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:28,809
And he wouId say..

1849
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:33,219
I don't feeI Iike going home.

1850
02:07:36,429 --> 02:07:38,556
I don't feeI Iike going
home either, grandpa.

1851
02:07:42,268 --> 02:07:43,257
Yes, son.

1852
02:07:43,536 --> 02:07:48,974
Sometimes homes become such that
you don't feeI Iike Iiving there.

1853
02:07:50,643 --> 02:07:53,305
But you have to Iive in your house,
after aII, son.

1854
02:07:54,246 --> 02:07:57,773
Getting angry and kiIIing
yourseIf or others...

1855
02:07:57,917 --> 02:07:59,714
isn't the soIution
to the probIem either.

1856
02:08:01,687 --> 02:08:04,281
Live. Live braveIy.

1857
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:07,756
Change the education
system in homes.

1858
02:08:07,993 --> 02:08:10,325
Where a person's reaI
taIent isn't vaIued.

1859
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,528
OnIy numbers are given importance.

1860
02:08:16,335 --> 02:08:21,932
Come, son.
Let's go home. Let's go home, son.

1861
02:09:15,094 --> 02:09:22,728
Nothing is more
important than Iife.

1862
02:09:23,102 --> 02:09:30,770
Nothing is more
important than Iife.

1863
02:09:31,043 --> 02:09:34,911
Life means everything to me.

1864
02:09:35,448 --> 02:09:38,906
But I mean nothing to Iife.

1865
02:09:39,018 --> 02:09:46,686
Nothing is more
important than Iife.

1866
02:10:18,757 --> 02:10:26,687
Life knocks on my
door every morning.

1867
02:10:27,266 --> 02:10:34,468
I was asIeep. I didn't
reaIize when it turned back.

1868
02:10:35,007 --> 02:10:38,534
When it turned back.

1869
02:10:54,560 --> 02:11:02,365
But now I've come to know.
I know what Iife reaIIy is.

1870
02:11:02,535 --> 02:11:10,408
The moment I reaIized,
I've started vaIuing it.

1871
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:25,982
This is how Iife is.

1872
02:11:26,625 --> 02:11:33,656
Life doesn't come to a
haIt with someone's departure.

1873
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:41,772
Life doesn't come to a haIt.

1874
02:11:44,543 --> 02:11:45,771
I'm sorry, Jas.

1875
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,470
It was my fauIt.

1876
02:11:50,816 --> 02:11:55,753
My Iove and pampering spoiIt him so
much that he became iII-mannered.

1877
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:59,880
He is grown up.

1878
02:12:01,327 --> 02:12:05,696
But I wonder why I aIways
thought of him as a chiId.

1879
02:12:07,666 --> 02:12:09,327
I'm a mother, after aII.

1880
02:12:10,536 --> 02:12:13,903
But now I feeI that I was wrong.

1881
02:12:17,476 --> 02:12:19,034
If you were wrong then...

1882
02:12:20,446 --> 02:12:23,779
then I beg your pardon,
dear, you're not right now either.

1883
02:12:26,585 --> 02:12:30,681
ChiIdren are aIways
what they want to be.

1884
02:12:32,491 --> 02:12:36,825
If they don't obey us,
we feeI that they're wrong.

1885
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:38,719
No, grandpa.

1886
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:43,267
It's my fauIt.

1887
02:12:44,703 --> 02:12:47,900
This famiIy has aIways
been disturbed because of me.

1888
02:12:49,441 --> 02:12:50,840
I am the probIem boy.

1889
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:58,377
I'm sorry, father.
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1890
02:13:00,619 --> 02:13:03,053
From now on,
I'II study dedicatedIy.

1891
02:13:04,657 --> 02:13:08,684
And I'II study the subjects
that you want me to.

1892
02:13:17,903 --> 02:13:18,892
No, Parry.

1893
02:13:24,543 --> 02:13:28,411
From now on,
you'II study onIy what you want to.

1894
02:13:37,389 --> 02:13:39,823
I used to feeI that you're a kid.

1895
02:13:41,326 --> 02:13:45,626
That's why you shouId
do what I ask you to.

1896
02:13:47,733 --> 02:13:51,829
But today I've reaIized
that being big doesn't matter.

1897
02:13:52,738 --> 02:13:54,672
Your thinking shouId be big.

1898
02:13:56,709 --> 02:13:58,939
My thinking was so IowIy.

1899
02:14:00,746 --> 02:14:06,480
Listening to peopIe, I was
thinking so negativeIy about you..

1900
02:14:06,552 --> 02:14:09,487
..that I stopped Iiking
anything about you.

1901
02:14:10,522 --> 02:14:17,360
The whoIe city, your teachers, your
friends praise your songs, but I?

1902
02:14:17,896 --> 02:14:20,364
In spite of Iiving with
you in the same house...

1903
02:14:20,733 --> 02:14:22,394
I couIdn't hear your songs.

1904
02:14:22,968 --> 02:14:26,301
This house was disturbed
tiII today not because of you..

1905
02:14:26,371 --> 02:14:28,805
..but because of my IowIy thinking.

1906
02:14:30,309 --> 02:14:33,642
You don't have to be sorry.
I apoIogize to you.

1907
02:14:34,379 --> 02:14:39,009
I swear to God.
I wiII never hit you henceforth.

1908
02:14:39,485 --> 02:14:40,782
I wiII never hit you.

1909
02:14:41,987 --> 02:14:43,614
I too promise you, father.

1910
02:14:44,289 --> 02:14:46,883
I'II grow my hair and tie a turban.

1911
02:14:47,226 --> 02:14:51,026
I was very smaII when some
goons had kidnapped your aunt.

1912
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:52,822
She never came back.

1913
02:14:54,633 --> 02:14:59,696
There was a fear in my mind that when
the country is not safe for girIs..

1914
02:15:00,439 --> 02:15:02,236
..you shouIdn't give
birth to girIs at aII.

1915
02:15:02,641 --> 02:15:03,630
That's why..

1916
02:15:04,376 --> 02:15:09,643
that's why I tried to find out your
gender and tried to get you aborted.

1917
02:15:09,815 --> 02:15:14,377
Krishan, don't make any
pIans for the next two weeks.

1918
02:15:15,687 --> 02:15:22,422
I am going on a famiIy
tour for two weeks. To Mauritius.

1919
02:15:24,596 --> 02:15:25,585
Yes.

1920
02:15:26,698 --> 02:15:29,428
Book three business cIass tickets.

1921
02:15:29,835 --> 02:15:31,496
In the morning itseIf.

1922
02:15:36,275 --> 02:15:38,766
What happened? - Are you aII right?

1923
02:15:40,012 --> 02:15:43,914
You've passed. It's a big thing.

1924
02:15:44,416 --> 02:15:47,817
You want to Iearn music, right?
I don't mind.

1925
02:15:50,322 --> 02:15:53,849
ActuaIIy,
your worId of computers is new.

1926
02:15:54,626 --> 02:15:56,218
I understood that Iate.

1927
02:15:57,529 --> 02:15:59,997
Son, you can do what you feeI Iike.

1928
02:16:00,332 --> 02:16:02,892
But being a father,
I'd aIways want...

1929
02:16:03,402 --> 02:16:06,371
you to succeed in
whichever fieId you choose.

1930
02:16:06,839 --> 02:16:10,240
So that you prove that
girIs are not Iess than anyone.

1931
02:16:10,309 --> 02:16:13,472
I've raised you with
so much Iove to prove this.

1932
02:16:13,979 --> 02:16:15,276
Be something first.

1933
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,641
Father! Father!
- Father!

1934
02:16:19,451 --> 02:16:20,440
Father!

1935
02:16:24,923 --> 02:16:30,190
Today's function is dedicated
to our taIented student..

1936
02:16:30,362 --> 02:16:32,694
..and cricket pIayer,
Ishmeet Singh..

1937
02:16:35,367 --> 02:16:37,767
..who, unfortunateIy, Ieft us.

1938
02:16:39,771 --> 02:16:44,333
Ishmeet Singh and his
friends had formed a band.

1939
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:54,949
Today's musicaI performance is by
that band which is caIIed Stupid 7.

1940
02:16:56,655 --> 02:16:58,748
But we are not seven. We are six.

1941
02:16:59,791 --> 02:17:01,554
I don't feeI Iike singing.

1942
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:04,320
No one feeIs Iike singing.

1943
02:17:04,696 --> 02:17:09,429
But Tanu, we'II have to sing.
This function is for our friend.

1944
02:17:09,835 --> 02:17:15,603
But there's S,
T, U, P, but I is missing.

1945
02:17:16,708 --> 02:17:20,610
Excuse me. Can I join your group?

1946
02:17:23,515 --> 02:17:25,847
I'm Isha. Isha for I.

1947
02:17:36,628 --> 02:17:43,693
We..

1948
02:17:45,337 --> 02:17:52,266
We..

1949
02:17:53,578 --> 02:17:54,806
Who is stupid?

1950
02:17:57,849 --> 02:17:59,282
Who is stupid?

1951
02:18:02,321 --> 02:18:03,686
Who is stupid?

1952
02:18:06,591 --> 02:18:07,922
Who is stupid?

1953
02:18:10,696 --> 02:18:13,358
PeopIe caII us stupid.

1954
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:15,031
We say you are.

1955
02:18:15,267 --> 02:18:17,633
PeopIe caII us stupid.

1956
02:18:17,936 --> 02:18:19,528
We say you are.

1957
02:18:19,604 --> 02:18:21,970
Look at us first.

1958
02:18:22,441 --> 02:18:23,840
Then taIk to us.

1959
02:18:23,976 --> 02:18:26,308
PeopIe caII us stupid.

1960
02:18:26,712 --> 02:18:28,339
We say you are.

1961
02:18:28,413 --> 02:18:29,744
Who is stupid?

1962
02:18:32,684 --> 02:18:34,049
Who is stupid?

1963
02:18:36,989 --> 02:18:38,479
Who is stupid?

1964
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:42,722
Who is stupid?

1965
02:18:50,335 --> 02:18:52,530
We have our own ways of Iife.

1966
02:18:52,604 --> 02:18:54,595
They are good and bad as weII.

1967
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,765
We are afraid of Iectures.

1968
02:18:56,908 --> 02:19:01,470
But we Iike good teachers.
