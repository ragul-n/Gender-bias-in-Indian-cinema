1
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,499
In this, the year 1034...

2
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,401
...on the 7th day of the month of
Kan ni...

3
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,705
...by consent of His Highness
the Maharajah Uthram Thirunal...

4
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,709
...the Honorable Diwan
Sri T Madhava Rayar...

5
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,145
...hereby decrees that...

6
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,956
...two days from now, on the
9th of Kanni...

7
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,023
...at 5 hours and 30 minutes
past midnight...

8
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,924
...the dreaded criminal Kochunni...

9
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,064
...also known as Kayamkulam Kochunni...

10
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,463
...is sentencedmto death by hanging

11
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,161
The crimes he is guilty of...

12
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,404
...are the following

13
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,884
The COPY

14
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,587
How is it usually with the corpses of
Muhammadans?

15
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,623
Ask the Diwan whether it is to be buried
or cremated

16
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,916
Would His Highness kindly
come to the balcony?

17
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,951
They're from Kayamkulam...

18
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,557
...not less than a hundred of them

19
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,627
And more are on the way

20
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,054
They are not here for any trouble...
just poor folks

21
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,589
When its all over, they want
the body to be given to them...

22
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,198
...with permission to bury him as
per rites

23
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,830
If your Majesty gives orders...

24
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,050
This...is his story

25
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,021
From the folk tales...

26
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,217
...from the treasure trove of legends...

27
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,090
...from the pages of history...

28
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,164
...from the tales told by
grandmothers...

29
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,630
...from what remained unread
between the lines...

30
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,637
...the many layers of meaning

31
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,734
For as long as the land of Malayalam
exists

32
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,002
For as long as the Malayali exists

33
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,137
Among those who live today and
those who are yet to come...

34
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,079
Among all generations...

35
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,980
...he stands immortal...

36
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,882
...and this is his story!

37
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,979
Thief! Thief!

38
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,187
Get him! Thief!

39
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,356
Get him! Quick!

40
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,361
Thief! Thief! Don't let him go!

41
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,830
Catch him! Thief!

42
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,866
Don't let him escape!

43
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,137
Don't let him go! Catch him!

44
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,378
- Go that way! Come!
-And let us go this way!

45
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,714
Come on! Let's go!
Quick!

46
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,204
Kill him! Beat him to death!

47
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,641
Kill him!

48
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,943
Thief! You thief!

49
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,880
Isn't that your father, Koch unni?

50
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,745
You...!

51
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,655
Search him! Right there!

52
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,896
Oh, Mother!

53
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,228
Mother!

54
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,920
What is it?

55
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,373
Just lie still for three months

56
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,174
The injury from the kicking
is deep inside

57
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,481
It is the coronotion day of Maharajah
Swathi Thirunal

58
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,051
That is why they let you go

59
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,117
Or else your house would have been
set on fire...

60
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,320
...on the order of the Adhikari

61
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,199
They let it go because it is
a special day

62
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,962
Tell him to mend his ways now

63
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,896
If you stay here, you will
die of hunger

64
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,227
Go to some other place and
save yourself

65
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,029
Go! And don't come back

66
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,570
And don't tell anyone you are
Bapputty's son

67
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,502
I don't want to go anywhere!
I won't!

68
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,778
It's your mother's request - go!

69
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,494
God be with you!

70
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,339
I've heard of you

71
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,306
What brings you here from the North?

72
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,472
I don't stay long anywhere

73
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,982
Some places, I stay a while and teach

74
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:38,283
I heard...you have a vacant house
and grounds

75
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,425
No one teaches the Tulunadan style here

76
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:43,927
And if it is Thangal teaching, pupils
will come from far and wide

77
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,660
That property is ideal for a school of
Ka
ari* (*a martial arts form)

78
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,630
And its been unoccuppied for long

79
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,538
We would be happy to see it
put to use

80
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,642
Show him the place

81
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,250
Its that way

82
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,982
Who's there?

83
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,321
Who are you?

84
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,489
- You!
- Don't beat him!

85
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,186
He was hiding here!

86
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,427
- I am hungry!
- Get out! Out!

87
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,969
No!

88
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,339
Who's there inside?

89
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,545
- What's your name?
- Kochunni

90
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,350
- Place?
- Kottukulangara

91
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,148
And why did you come here?

92
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,423
Don't you have any family?

93
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:46,616
No

94
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,528
You meanmthey are dead?

95
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,992
Yes

96
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,534
And where are you off to now?

97
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,697
We could use some help
at the store, Master

98
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,938
I think he will be apt

99
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,009
What are you saying, Syedali?

100
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,109
How can he...

101
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,338
I can teach him to serve customers
and write accounts

102
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,506
And if he sleeps at the store,
it would be good for security too

103
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,050
But without knowing anything
about him...

104
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,388
Upon my guarantee

105
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,615
If you aren't willing, let me know

106
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,191
I will take care of him myself

107
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,752
But...what if he steals something?

108
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,031
I won't steal

109
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,235
I won't steal

110
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,739
Don't steal! Work for money
and then come back

111
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,582
Or else just ask for it

112
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,085
But don't steal

113
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,255
What's going on, Kochunni?

114
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,524
-Add a plantain to the bill
- Plantain?

115
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,693
I didn't ask for a plantain

116
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,064
Take it from my pay

117
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,093
There's hardly anything left
of your pay anyway

118
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,438
Can you put my list on
your pay too?

119
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,648
Why? Who are you?

120
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,810
What about that kid? He
was nothing to you too

121
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,347
What else?

122
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,288
8 kilograms of rice...3 kilograms
of beaten rice

123
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,416
2 liters of oil

124
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,428
1 kilogram ofjaggery...
5 bunches of bananas

125
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,631
How many of you are there at home?

126
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,325
Father, Mother and me

127
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,437
Are you buying groceries for a whole
year?

128
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,540
Or is this how you normally eat?

129
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,198
What is all this stuff for?

130
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:46,437
Omar Khasi Thangal has started
a school of Kalari across the river

131
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,310
I cook and clean for them

132
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,144
That's what this is for

133
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,219
It's been a while since his last
visit

134
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,552
-Are there many pupils?
-Around twelve

135
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,187
It's Nanu Chovan's boy!

136
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,458
It's a Chova boy! The well is polluted!

137
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,122
The well must be sealed!

138
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,201
Go and get Paramu immediately!

139
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,540
No upper castes should draw
water!

140
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,311
Don't stand around! Move!

141
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,777
Move! Move away!

142
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:23,212
He must have leaned over and slipped

143
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,282
Move! Move!

144
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,352
Come here! Quick!

145
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,318
Come on! Seal it!

146
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,358
Kochunni! Kochunni!

147
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,714
Everyone move! Some more!

148
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,290
Pull! Come on, pull!

149
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,411
Oh no! It's a python!

150
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,247
Take the child!

151
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:03,271
Hit! Hit it!

152
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,450
Hey! No!

153
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,275
Let it go

154
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,318
Kochu Pillai! Move aside!

155
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,285
I am an uppercaste Nair.
I draw water from this well

156
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,454
And I will continue to do so!
I won't let you seal it!

157
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,292
You call yourself a Nair but want to
draw water polluted by a Chovan?

158
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,455
To us it is poison! And as long
as we are around...

159
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,554
...this well won't be here anymore!

160
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,464
How come this impurity does not
affect your beds?

161
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,462
If the water is made impure by a
Chovan falling in...

162
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,869
...push a Brahmin inside to make it
pure again!

163
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,466
- How dare you!
- Seal it!

164
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:33,835
- Seal it!
- Take him away!

165
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,314
Leave me!

166
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,821
Make it fast!

167
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:49,953
When the snake coiled around you...

168
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,230
...how come you were not scared?

169
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,363
I knew the snake would be the loser

170
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:57,731
It's a good thing you don't brag

171
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,296
Leave me at the dock

172
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,272
We have stock coming in from Kochi

173
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,032
Four mouths to feedmand on
top of that - tax!

174
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,403
- Don't Brahamins have to pay tax?
- No

175
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,576
They have a book. It clearly
says...

176
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,906
...who should pay and who need not

177
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:44,539
-And who wrote that?
- The Brahmins themselves!

178
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,476
For bigger crimes...

179
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,578
...the English laws are also being
applied now

180
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,050
But they also side with the
upper castes

181
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,717
Sahibs, indeed!

182
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,723
They come from foreign lands to
live in ours...

183
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,898
...and now their word is Law?

184
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,065
If only I knew the language...

185
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,899
...
 would have given them a piece
of my mind!

186
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,402
- What? You doubt it?
- It's not that

187
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,675
Look ahead

188
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,815
God! You think they heard?

189
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,084
Kochunni?

190
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,451
The Commander Sahib wants to meet you

191
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:25,524
- Come!
- Ok

192
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,726
If I am not back before dark, do
come and look for me

193
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,448
- Say 'Thank You'
- Huh?

194
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,490
- 'Thank You'
- Should I, really?

195
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,826
- It is an expression of gratitude
- Ok

196
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:02,991
Thank you

197
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:12,602
(Translator repeats)

198
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,942
- What should I say?
- Just keep your head bowed

199
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:26,480
He is asking if you can get
Ithikkara Pakki, the bandit

200
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,688
- Who?
- Ithikkara Pakki

201
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,522
Didn't their men who went after him...

202
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,522
...return headless?

203
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,629
And he thinks I can do it?

204
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:46,638
(Translator repeats)

205
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,909
Come on! Make a wish!

206
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:53,178
You can ask him for something
you want

207
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:58,109
From the Sahib's brother's Palace...

208
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:02,012
...we hear music and dancing every night

209
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,854
Can my friends and I...

210
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,925
...watch one day?

211
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:20,162
Where dance and song...

212
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:28,007
...come alive every day

213
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,610
These dark eyes...

214
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:42,026
...seek out wonders

215
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,512
Where dance and song...

216
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,518
...come alive every day

217
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,280
These dark eyes...

218
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,218
...seek out wonders

219
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,923
Aah...my lady...

220
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,620
Aah...dear lady...

221
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,218
Aah...my lady...

222
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,127
Aah...dear lady...

223
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,494
To see the moves...

224
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,266
...that rustle my drapes...

225
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,099
...the entire Universe...

226
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,770
...comes before me

227
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:28,603
Aah...my lady...

228
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,300
Aah...dear lady...

229
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,511
Aah...my lady...

230
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,613
Aah...dear lady...

231
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:50,818
My magical lips...

232
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:52,927
...that drip pearls...

233
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,795
Who can turn them red?

234
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,629
Which blue-eyed lover?

235
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,133
As I sway...

236
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,133
...like a peacock...

237
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:02,137
...gent
y, the wind...

238
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:05,139
...dispels the frangrance of blossoms

239
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,806
Who will taste this sweetness?

240
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,143
Who will wear this garland?

241
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,014
Who shall I embrace?

242
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,848
Who shall I melt?

243
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,856
I am the heady night that will
leave you in raptures

244
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,693
Where dance and song...

245
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,355
...come alive every day

246
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,132
These dark eyes...

247
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:29,801
...seek out wonders...

248
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,798
Aah...my lady...

249
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,768
Aah...dear lady...

250
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,770
Aah...my lady...

251
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,169
Aah...dear lady...

252
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,275
To see the moves...

253
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,073
...that rustle my drapes...

254
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,976
...the entire Universe...

255
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,639
...comes before me

256
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,150
Aah...my lady...

257
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,676
Aah...dear lady...

258
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,220
Aah...my lady...

259
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,324
Aah...dear lady...

260
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,940
What do you want?

261
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,879
Thangan

262
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,041
What about?

263
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,514
III-

264
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,909
...wanted to ask if he could
teach me

265
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:04,189
Hmm

266
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,161
- There!
- Ok

267
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,335
Do you have regular pay at the store?

268
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,847
Why do you want to know?

269
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:35,386
Do you really want to spend it
on medicines and oils?

270
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,324
This is not like grappling with a snake

271
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:44,123
They are real experts

272
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,527
If a nerve gets caught the wrong way...

273
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,197
...you could be laid up for years!

274
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,829
They are from affluent families

275
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,201
And have people to take care of
them if they get hurt

276
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:59,404
Why do you worry about me?

277
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,209
Just mind your own business

278
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,575
I am minding my business

279
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,375
It's just that you have a handsome face

280
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:10,854
And I would like to see it stay that way

281
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:28,299
-Your name?
- Kochunni

282
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,906
- Where from?
-Around here

283
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,178
Born here?

284
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,076
At Kottukulangara

285
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:37,342
I have no parents. That's how
I came here

286
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:39,849
Your father's name?

287
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,522
Kottuku
angara...is not unfamiliar
to me

288
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,001
Bappuﬂv

289
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:09,907
If I teach you, what if you turn out
greater than him?

290
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:12,413
You can't be taught here. Go!

291
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,162
(Thangal giving Kalari instructions)

292
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,267
When I showed him all my moves
he said...

293
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:37,676
"Kochunni, my son...

294
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,112
...you are already an expert."

295
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,411
"What more can you learn here?"

296
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,986
"In fact, you should be my Guru!"

297
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:53,551
And then he said, "please teach
my pupils some moves"

298
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,994
- He really said that?
- Of course he did!

299
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:58,288
- Believe me if you can
- Ok, I believe you

300
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,194
And did you teach them?

301
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:02,334
And did he pay you anything?

302
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,396
Of course I taught them!

303
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:06,505
There were three of them - three!

304
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,631
One from this side

305
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,437
One from this side

306
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,544
And the third from here

307
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,013
I first stepped back...

308
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:18,448
...took the 'othiram' stance...

309
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,619
...then 'kadakam'...

310
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,448
...and 'marukadakam'

311
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,556
Blocked and moved away like this...

312
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:27,025
...then crouched and reared...

313
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,361
...leapt forward...

314
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,063
I saw some medicinal herbs here

315
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,232
-Can I pluck some?
-Ok

316
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:37,002
So there were three of themmand?

317
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,372
And I showed them

318
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:45,373
But to think someone as saintly
as Thangal...

319
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,206
masked you to be his Guru!

320
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,672
Even if he did not really mean that...

321
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:52,341
...its not a small thing

322
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,419
He is even said to know sorcery

323
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,247
Ask him to come...you can teach
him right here!

324
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,654
And we can charge him for it!

325
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,759
Are you just going to stand there
and talk?

326
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,256
Time is getting on...they will be
here soon

327
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:07,591
Go inside and put those snacks
on plates

328
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,502
And you go and put some kohl
in your eyes!

329
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,367
I am already wearing kohl

330
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,408
Where? I don't see any!
Put some more

331
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,345
Here

332
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:29,044
Can you hide and watch to learn?

333
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,511
Huh?

334
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,386
If you can, come to the west side of
the schoool

335
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,459
I can show you a way

336
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,693
New?

337
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:40,260
Not now! If you come in the daylight
and someone sees you...

338
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,764
...like that old woman was saying...

339
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,002
...Thanga
 might make a 'Guru'
out of you

340
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,505
At night!

341
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,274
If you plan to come, start today

342
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,775
Thangal does not stay longer than
six months in any place

343
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,206
And once he goes, you can't predict
when he will be back

344
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,109
I wonder if the boat is available
<i>at</i> that time

345
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,353
What? You want me to arrange that too?

346
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,113
I wasn't saying that to you

347
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,157
Just thinking aloud

348
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:08,523
Kochunni does not need a boat to cross
the Thrikkunnappuzha

349
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,126
- Who's that girl?
- Huh?

350
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,788
The one you said to line her eyes with
kohl...who's she?

351
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,261
She is the deceased Syedali 
kka's
daughter, Suhra

352
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,461
- I meant who is she to you?
- No one

353
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,130
Then why are you hovering around here?

354
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,335
This is like home to me

355
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,377
We grew up together

356
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,477
They are here!

357
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,649
- A prospective groom for Suhra
- Oh!

358
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,352
Hey!

359
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:11,254
Where are you going at this hour?

360
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:12,584
I'll tell you when I return

361
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,659
Return from where?

362
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,666
He's up to no good, I am sure!

363
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:46,481
Climb!

364
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,786
Huh?

365
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:51,863
-Just climb!
-This...?

366
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:18,722
(Keshavan giving instructions)

367
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,849
(Keshavan continuing instructions)

368
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,650
(Keshavan continuing instructions)

369
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:27,511
Why are you helping me?

370
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:31,348
I've heard Thangal knows sorcery

371
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:34,055
Are you planning to try that
on me?

372
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:41,463
In your caste, women can have up to
twelve lovers, right?

373
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:44,035
Are you trying to make me one of them?

374
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,336
I don't need sorcery for that

375
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:49,101
I can get more than twelve with just
a gaze

376
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,576
Stronger and braver than you!

377
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,477
A Shudra girl can also fall in love

378
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,583
True and heartfelt love

379
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:00,452
And it can be for just one person too

380
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:03,686
You seemed pure of heart...

381
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:04,812
<i>"whenever we met</i>

382
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,925
Without such a reassurance,
I wouldn't...

383
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,994
...step out at night for anyone...

384
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,430
...for any man

385
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,567
I can't make it tomorrow

386
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:18,770
It is market day

387
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:21,429
I will be going with the Master on the
boat to Kochi

388
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:25,440
We leave at dawn and return
only after three days

389
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,436
That night I will come again

390
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,481
Do I need to come get you?

391
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,478
You already know the way

392
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,949

...am a Muslim

393
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:42,153
No one has ever called me 'Janaki'
with love

394
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:46,756
If someone promises to call me
lovingly...

395
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,167
...
 don't need anyone's consent to have
a different name

396
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,039
We leave at the crack of dawn

397
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:56,575
We will be passing this way

398
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:59,910
My people don't really believe in
good omens

399
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:03,482
But when you start on a journey...

400
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:05,684
...it is auspicious to see a lantern...

401
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,820
...is what Velu, the astrologer says

402
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:11,856
Then why don't I leave the lantern
here on the riverbank?

403
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:17,951
But...he also said it should be held
by one's own woman

404
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:26,836
(Kalari instructions as chorus)

405
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:38,711
(Kalari instructions continue)

406
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:50,086
The beauty of Kalari, in your deft
moves I see...

407
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:56,160
...Oh! hero of the land ofCheras

408
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:02,430
I seek the brimming chalice of dreams
in your eye...

409
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,879
As I am beside you, woman of mystery

410
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:13,652
In my book of prayers...

411
00:41:14,908 --> 00:41:18,549
I saw no name such as yours

412
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:24,027
The windows to my soul...

413
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:26,930
Are opened just for you

414
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:29,898
New dreams blossom on the vine
of life...

415
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,267
...draped in music foryou...

416
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:35,167
Hereon, in my path...

417
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,533
...like drops of dew...

418
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,877
...there'sjust you...

419
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:44,279
"standing tenderly, Janaki...

420
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:50,051
The beauty of Kalari, in your deft
moves I see...

421
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:57,552
...oh! hero of the Land of Cheras

422
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,776
The golden hue of Mehendi...

423
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,278
...does not adorn your hand

424
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:20,641
Nor do your eyes flutter with kohl...

425
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:27,016
Your pearl-touched lips...

426
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:32,692
...do not hum strains ofOppana

427
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,762
Like arrows, your teasing words...

428
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:38,935
...have opened the lock to my heart

429
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,803
Know this, my love...

430
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:45,306
...the beauty of your soul
intoxicates me

431
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,967
The strength in your chiselled body...

432
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:20,367
...has nipped the buds of my youth

433
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:26,351
Your hands fragrant with oil...

434
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:32,754
...have overpowered my being

435
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:35,823
My sweetness...my song...

436
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,860
...you are my lucky charm

437
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,932
I long, with all my heart...

438
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:45,366
...to wash over you like a wave

439
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:50,371
The beauty of Kalari, in your deft
moves I see...

440
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:55,811
...oh! hero of the land of Cheras

441
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:59,384
Hereon, in my path...

442
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,749
...like drops of dew...

443
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,886
....there'sjust you...

444
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,754
"standing tenderly, Janaki

445
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:11,922
Hereon in my path...

446
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,625
...like drops of dew...

447
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,768
...there'sjust you...

448
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:19,767
"standing tenderly, Janaki

449
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,413
(Keshavan giving instructions at
the Kalari)

450
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:43,459
- What's the matter, Thangal?
- I feel there is someone here

451
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:49,701
An outsider

452
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,337
Shut the gates!

453
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:08,287
Maybe just a feeling

454
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,891
Silence!

455
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,124
Come down! Whoever you are!

456
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:46,852
Enough!

457
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:58,830
This is not an art you learn from the
shadows, you dog!

458
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,466
You learn by obeying and sewing
your Guru

459
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:06,236
This is not the place to learn how to
fight street urchins

460
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,240
Get out!

461
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,342
Please forgive me

462
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,617
I so badly wanted to learn

463
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:23,412
So you started off by placing
an offering at her feet?

464
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:27,018
And what was your gain? That
also would have been fixed

465
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:28,518
Speak!

466
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:31,289
She is the woman I intend to marry

467
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:36,127
And you thought this school was apt
to bring your lover to?

468
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,270
Didn't you?

469
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,503
Keshava!

470
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:42,507
It won't be with an offering to
the Guru...

471
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,610
...that street urchins defend their
women

472
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:46,941
Today is Thursday

473
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:48,947
It's an auspicious day

474
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:52,974
You may start with the introductory
move

475
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:57,122
I feel my wish to find a successor...

476
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:59,257
...has been answered

477
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:16,600
Seven years ago, when Ijoined you
as a pupil...

478
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,466
...this was all I had

479
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:21,077
I am taking this

480
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:23,181
And nothing more

481
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:27,175
Where are you going?

482
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:32,655
It is the divine moment when the Guru
has found his successor

483
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,993
A poor fool who, for seven years waited
patiently...

484
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:39,130
...discip
ined in time and body and
celibacy...

485
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,993
...is a burden in that moment

486
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,624
He just performed the fifth sequence
of Kalari moves...

487
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,329
It takes a year to learn

488
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:47,531
But he learned it in just forty days

489
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:49,401
- It's a miracle!
- Of course!

490
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:51,668
Next you may ask me to salute
the miracle

491
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,945
I am leaving because I can't do that

492
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:06,457
We will meet againmsome place

493
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:11,329
And not for a friendly duel...for a
battle

494
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:25,108
I need no honours

495
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:26,267
I don't want anything

496
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:29,139
You are not dearer to me than him

497
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,714
I love no one more than him

498
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:35,986
But affection cannot stand in the way
of destiny

499
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:49,424
(Than gal instructing Kochu nni)

500
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,495
You are destined for greatness

501
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,426
You will not fail

502
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:54,762
I am a wanderer

503
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:58,262
I can spot one meant for victory

504
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:07,143
I am unable to keep it steady

505
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,707
I don't think I can handle this!

506
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,248
Kochunni! It's all over for us!

507
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:15,582
- Oh God!
- Don't lose hope, Master!

508
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,416
I will get you to shore!

509
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,819
God is with us!

510
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:39,836
Where's the Master?

511
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:50,185
Hold her here!

512
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:47,270
If it's a treasure...shouldn't we send
it to the King?

513
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:50,245
Why? So he can start more schools?

514
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:52,682
His Majesty wants the low caste
hunters, fisherfolk and forest tribes...

515
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,413
...to be educated

516
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,316
Now they will start quoting scripture
too...

517
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,888
...and we will be left watching

518
00:52:57,978 --> 00:53:02,256
One who is better suited to play music
and write songs should not be King

519
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:06,292
<i>Riches don": come our way everyday</i>

520
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,627
It's up to you to decide what
we should do

521
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:11,265
If you wish to send it to the Palace,
so be it

522
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,769
If anyone comes to know, punishment
could be harsh

523
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:18,542
Of all the Cheruma boys who keep
the distance of purity from us...

524
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:20,908
...how many would be of our own blood?

525
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,675
If that can remain a secret, so
can this

526
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:45,604
It needs to be taken from there

527
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,666
Uh...there's a lot under there

528
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,900
I can't do it alone

529
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,736
We'll send help. But...

530
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:53,243
...what we speak of here should stay
here

531
00:53:53,334 --> 00:53:55,905
Four days from today is the start of the
temple festival

532
00:53:56,036 --> 00:53:58,539
Some day before it ends...

533
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:01,482
...when all the villagers are busy with
the festival...

534
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:03,555
...we will let you know the time

535
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:11,563
What do you want in return?

536
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:15,865
It's not a small task...so you may ask

537
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,339
III-

538
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:23,470
...there are three things I would like

539
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:27,012
I...would like to have a gram of gold

540
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,315
It's for Syedali 
kka's daughter's
wedding

541
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:32,475
-Ah!
- They are waiting to set a date

542
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:35,418
As soon as the job is over, you will
get one gram of gold

543
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:37,823
Tell them they can set the date

544
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:42,323
Next...for the harvest festival
at Kunnigramam...

545
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:45,692
...could you arrange for them to
have a feast... with Kheer?

546
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:47,732
Could your Lordhips please do that?

547
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:49,835
Kunnigramam is...

548
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,735
- ...the low castes village?
- Yes

549
00:54:52,893 --> 00:54:56,033
They are poor peoplemthey will be
really happy

550
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:59,044
And the third?

551
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,614
III-

552
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:06,379
...would like to marry a Shudra girl

553
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,017
That too

554
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,062
The treasure is meant for the King

555
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,990
If news gets around, it could
attract thieves

556
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,824
Remember your promise to keep
it secret

557
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:26,305
Upon God...upon my Master!

558
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,034
You may go now

559
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,740
- How much is this?
- Two paise

560
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,975
- (background) Make way! Make way!
-Oh!

561
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,680
- And this?
- Eight

562
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:09,978
Whoa!

563
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:12,882
I'll take this

564
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:14,418
Hey!

565
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:19,888
What's this?

566
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,424
This...
 got it for you

567
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,756
Then give it to me

568
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:32,869
Tell me the truth...
 won't tell
anyone

569
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:41,840
This...is for a special someone

570
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,043
Probab
y...you and I will get married...

571
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:47,482
- ...on the same day
- Huh?

572
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:52,691
- Really?
- Yes

573
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,060
And who is the girl?

574
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:57,529
- Tell me!
- Kochunni!

575
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,561
We need to set a date for
the wedding

576
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:08,103
You cant just say 'we accept' and then
walk away

577
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:10,500
If tomorrow dawns, you can be assured...

578
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:12,406
...
 will put a gram of gold in your
hands

579
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:13,171
Huh?

580
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,911
- Yes!
- You're sure?

581
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:18,015
Yes!

582
00:57:18,172 --> 00:57:21,847
And how can we send her off
without a necklace or ear rings?

583
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:23,853
You should find a way for that too

584
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:28,427
- How much?
- Ten

585
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:30,595
Just pay him, will you?
Come on, girl!

586
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,040
"Behind the Banyan tree"

587
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:06,597
East side of the river

588
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,666
Before the stream makes the turn
towards Perunthenaruvi

589
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,339
You asked for one gram of gold

590
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:04,883
Here are five sovereigns!

591
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:08,353
And what will you do with it?

592
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:11,014
Me...
 have friends...

593
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:13,681
Vava sleeps on the riverbank...
he could get a house

594
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,794
Bappukunju also has lots of needs...

595
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,361
And...Suhra can gave a great
wedding

596
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,323
I can get her some jewelry too! And
give some of this to my Master

597
01:00:21,688 --> 01:00:23,668
Good! Be careful on your way!

598
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:24,801
Ok

599
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,069
A person found guilty of theft...

600
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,372
...shall be given 190 lashes of the
whip...

601
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,745
...have his hands dipped in
boiling oil and...

602
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,318
...deprived of food and water...

603
01:01:16,443 --> 01:01:19,447
...be hung upside down for three days

604
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:26,424
What is happening here is unjust!

605
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:30,292
Sahib! At least you should put a stop
to this

606
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:32,364
What injustice are you talking about?

607
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,033
It was from this Raghava Menon's
house...

608
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:37,365
...that he was caught stealing five
sovereigns of gold

609
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:41,468
Let Menon say so if it is untrue

610
01:02:42,129 --> 01:02:44,769
In broad daylight, while the festival
was on...

611
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:46,810
...he came in through the back door

612
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,847
Fortunately, I was home

613
01:02:49,336 --> 01:02:51,907
I shouted for help so I got my
gold back

614
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,118
That is his version

615
01:02:55,142 --> 01:02:57,952
When, where and before whom did
his trial happen?

616
01:02:58,112 --> 01:03:00,058
Speak, woman! When you last met him...

617
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,160
...what did he tell you?

618
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:09,167
Speak!

619
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,875
That he would get the gold for
her wedding

620
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:22,172
Heard enough?

621
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,911
Where would a shop assistant get
five sovereigns? From the heavens?

622
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,318
What about his side of the story?

623
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:30,389
You beat him unconscious and...

624
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:31,546
...you call this a trial?

625
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:33,216
Take him away!

626
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:36,551
- Leave me!
- Come back as Adhikari or Parvathiyar!

627
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,797
Then you can start issuing orders!

628
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:42,534
Our book of laws is the Vyavaharamala

629
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:45,832
But to tie up a culprit in an
open space...

630
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:48,006
...we need your consent too

631
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:49,570
As you are aware...

632
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,610
We had submitted the evidence

633
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:55,113
(Translator translating the same)

634
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:53,631
For taking on a lover from a different
religion and plotting to marry him...

635
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:56,338
...she is found guilty

636
01:04:56,463 --> 01:05:01,344
It is hereby decreed that she be stoned
and banished from this land...

637
01:06:13,274 --> 01:06:15,254
Mother!

638
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:26,023
Dusk...at the most, nightfall

639
01:06:26,386 --> 01:06:28,366
He certainly won't last till dawn

640
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:46,216
Oh no! Run! Run!

641
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:50,697
Drink!

642
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:53,572
It's good for the pain

643
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,799
It will heal faster!

644
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:28,273
Why did you save me?

645
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,536
I have a liking for thieves

646
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:35,312
Especially those branded as
thieves by others

647
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:44,721
Where are we going?

648
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,449
To our south is Kanyakumari

649
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:50,020
And to the North is Kochi

650
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,728
This can take you anywhere

651
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:58,030
Just leave me anywheremexcept
where we started from

652
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,839
Can you help me...

653
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:06,303
...find someone?

654
01:11:10,704 --> 01:11:15,244
Banished personsmare pelted with
stones till the border

655
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:20,655
Most die of bleeding and dehydration
right there

656
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:25,827
Some run into the forest and get
eaten by wild animals

657
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,400
If one has to escape alive...

658
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:30,432
...God has to be on their side

659
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:33,402
But He also keeps his distance from
poor folk

660
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,380
Don't look for her

661
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,682
You won't find her

662
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:50,018
In that case you shouldn't have
saved me either

663
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:52,391
I would have been happy to die

664
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:56,721
What an idiotic thing to say! You fool!

665
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:58,693
Then jump aboard and die!

666
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:00,593
Die!

667
01:12:02,756 --> 01:12:05,737
Go ahead! Die!

668
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:18,846
When I heard of a boy who stopped a
foreigner touching a low caste woman"

669
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:21,612
...
 thought he was a man of courage!

670
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:25,349
And that is why I saved him!

671
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:29,428
Anyone can die

672
01:12:31,652 --> 01:12:34,963
What is difficu
t...is to go on living

673
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:38,666
You should return

674
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,668
But not as a dead body

675
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,740
What the noblemen turned you into...

676
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:48,507
...be that! Be the terror of
Kayamkulam...

677
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:53,013
...the most feared thief, ever!

678
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,587
For a crime you did not commit...

679
01:12:55,643 --> 01:12:59,455
...they punished you by whipping you
and tying you upside down!

680
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:02,457
Now go ahead and commit
the crime!

681
01:13:02,616 --> 01:13:05,162
They took away your girl and destroyed
your happiness...

682
01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:10,135
...the bloody sons of privilege...

683
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:20,112
There is only one life

684
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,909
Understand that!

685
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:27,983
There is no Heaven! Or Hell!

686
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:31,719
Just one life!

687
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:36,621
Where...and how to lead it...

688
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:40,389
...is for each one of us to decide

689
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,137
Turn around!

690
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,688
It's only with the brave...

691
01:14:03,043 --> 01:14:05,023
...that I shake hands and introduce
myself

692
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:10,224
Ithikkara Pakki!

693
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:17,532
Mam mad!

694
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:18,228
Noor Ahmed!

695
01:14:18,526 --> 01:14:19,834
Kunju Marakkar!

696
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:56,205
War cries rising, waves crashing...

697
01:14:56,563 --> 01:14:59,635
A lion awakens

698
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:06,911
Peaks fall crashing, leaves the
Earth shaking

699
01:15:07,074 --> 01:15:10,214
With it's almighty roar!

700
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:17,126
Dreadlocks flailing...

701
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:19,798
Call to arms raging

702
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,198
Thirsting for blood, a deadly
dance ensues

703
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:27,766
Churning this sphere of fire...

704
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:30,101
This bloody star that is our world

705
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:35,007
To put an end to treachery and evil

706
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,788
With fire raging in his eyes

707
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,624
Strung on a bolt of lightning

708
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:53,959
Before the altar of fire

709
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:56,168
He pays a bloody offering

710
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:59,528
An icon of darkness

711
01:15:59,793 --> 01:16:02,273
Entrails wrapped around his body

712
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:04,836
Dripping red blood

713
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:06,945
The very image of the age of Kali

714
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:10,145
With a shake of his feathers, the Sea
turns into a wave

715
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,983
And scatters death far and wide

716
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,646
The stars are his anklets

717
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,155
And even the Sun and Moon pale
before him

718
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:23,021
Brave one! War hero!

719
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:27,656
Rise on in valour!

720
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:33,304
Brave one! War hero!

721
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:37,870
Make your move, once more!

722
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,456
If we get scattered, we
meet behind the temple

723
01:20:28,262 --> 01:20:30,367
- Oh no!
-What? Chellayya! Peeli!

724
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:33,071
They took the kids! Leave
it and come!

725
01:20:33,133 --> 01:20:35,204
Let them take everything!

726
01:20:35,336 --> 01:20:37,316
- Please don't hurt my children!
- Thief! Get him!

727
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,485
- Thief! Get him!
-Come quick!

728
01:20:39,874 --> 01:20:41,854
-Get him!
-Thief!

729
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:43,922
Don't let him get away!

730
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,625
Mommy! Mommy!

731
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:54,132
- Mommy!
- Get him! Thief!

732
01:20:54,455 --> 01:20:57,959
-Get him!
- Get the thief!

733
01:20:58,926 --> 01:21:01,167
- The sound is from over there!
- Get him!

734
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:06,545
My babies!

735
01:21:10,237 --> 01:21:12,979
It seems they took everything -
all the gold and money!

736
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,451
It's God's Grace the children were
found unharmed

737
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:21,084
But I heard they could not figure out
who the intruders were

738
01:21:27,688 --> 01:21:31,363
What if we show them who we
are?

739
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,344
Show them all!

740
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:58,747
No! He fed me!

741
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:02,086
Fear not, Master!

742
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:05,196
I won't stand by and watch...
ike
you did

743
01:23:37,284 --> 01:23:39,362
No upper caste shall henceforth
raise their hands...

744
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:41,764
magainst any of the oppressed
classes

745
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:44,227
No child of the poor...

746
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,396
...shall cry of hunger in this land

747
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,531
Henceforth in Kayamkulam...

748
01:23:48,696 --> 01:23:51,040
...he sets the Law

749
01:23:51,298 --> 01:23:53,642
The Law of Kochunni!

750
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:09,728
Who did this?

751
01:24:22,663 --> 01:24:25,439
Kayamkulam Kochunni!

752
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:20,689
I will leave in a couple of days

753
01:25:21,722 --> 01:25:24,703
As long as there is hunger in this
world...

754
01:25:25,426 --> 01:25:27,804
...there will be Kayamkulam Kochunni

755
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:30,368
And there will be Ithikkara Pakki

756
01:25:30,498 --> 01:25:32,478
Come on!

757
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:37,274
Every land should have people
like us

758
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:41,246
It's time for me to go to another
such place

759
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:44,146
You are here now

760
01:25:45,713 --> 01:25:47,454
They will be with you

761
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:49,788
They'll be your men now

762
01:25:49,884 --> 01:25:53,422
You will be just as I am to them

763
01:25:57,825 --> 01:26:00,431
I have only one regret

764
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:02,899
Vavvakkad is...

765
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:05,766
...famed for its deer meat

766
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:10,715
I've heard of it...from the hunters

767
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,684
I never got to taste it

768
01:28:15,729 --> 01:28:18,835
The bleeding will stop now

769
01:28:19,767 --> 01:28:22,407
Why were you going through
the forest?

770
01:28:23,504 --> 01:28:25,711
Are you a trader or something?

771
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:29,054
I come here at times

772
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:31,721
I like to listen to...

773
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:35,452
...the sound of the bamboo groves
when the wind blows through them

774
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,591
We were attacked by wolves deep
inside the forest

775
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:42,968
I got separated from my group

776
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:47,064
I can't kill him

777
01:28:47,328 --> 01:28:49,706
Though we are supposed to

778
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:52,044
III-

779
01:28:52,533 --> 01:28:55,036
...can't bear to watch

780
01:28:56,137 --> 01:28:59,880
When it's over...don't leave him
to the wild beasts

781
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:02,421
Please bury him

782
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:05,921
What can I pay you to do that for me?

783
01:29:11,585 --> 01:29:13,565
Him!

784
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,796
I will take care of him...keep
him alive

785
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,867
He is injured on the neck

786
01:29:21,996 --> 01:29:24,738
He won't last the night...
 know!

787
01:29:26,367 --> 01:29:29,348
I have seen greater wounds heal

788
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:33,482
You may go! I will stay here

789
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:50,629
What is your name?

790
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:57,509
Try to be out of the forest before
nightfall

791
01:29:57,698 --> 01:30:00,042
The animals will be out hunting
soon

792
01:30:00,468 --> 01:30:02,141
Head straight to the East

793
01:30:02,503 --> 01:30:04,847
In an hour or so you will reach
the river

794
01:30:05,973 --> 01:30:09,477
Keep this! For emergencies

795
01:30:40,874 --> 01:30:43,115
I shall remember this

796
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:55,897
"Whosoever shall come to the Palace
with this...

797
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:58,196
...whether in my lifetime or after...

798
01:30:58,526 --> 01:31:00,199
...without violating any laws...

799
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:03,032
...shall have one wish fulfilled.

800
01:31:03,264 --> 01:31:04,868
This is my order

801
01:31:04,932 --> 01:31:06,878
By my royal authority

802
01:31:06,934 --> 01:31:10,609
The Maharajah, Shree Swathi Thirunal"

803
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:54,760
Get up, girl! Come on!

804
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,279
Where are you taking them?

805
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,948
When we are at the 'Athachamayam'
festival...

806
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:24,545
...we accidentally touched Vishnu
Nam boothiri's palanquin

807
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:28,718
He says our hands will be chopped off
for polluting it with our touch

808
01:32:29,116 --> 01:32:30,993
If we personally come before him and
apologise...

809
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:32,929
...he says we will be spared

810
01:32:32,953 --> 01:32:34,933
He sent this man to fetch us

811
01:32:41,795 --> 01:32:43,934
We are headed for the Lordhip's
farm house

812
01:32:44,298 --> 01:32:46,005
And there...?

813
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:47,769
Out with the truth or my knife
will be in yourtummy

814
01:32:47,868 --> 01:32:50,007
They have to spend two nights with
the Lordship

815
01:32:55,042 --> 01:32:58,285
"Whoever touches a Brahmin or his
belongings...

816
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:01,622
...if he is a person of a lower caste...

817
01:33:01,782 --> 01:33:04,763
...shall be treated like an animal and
may be killed...

818
01:33:05,986 --> 01:33:08,694
...or have his hand or legs chopped
off...

819
01:33:09,657 --> 01:33:13,070
...or be banished from the land"

820
01:33:48,362 --> 01:33:50,342
Burn it!

821
01:33:59,707 --> 01:34:02,051
If you ever force me to come here
again...

822
01:34:02,242 --> 01:34:04,745
...
 will do to you whatever you just
read

823
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:57,402
"l shall be back...to claim what is
mine - Kayamkulam Kochunni"

824
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,362
The dreaded bandit
Kayamkulam Kochunni...

825
01:36:00,494 --> 01:36:04,101
...has sent a note saying he is coming
back

826
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:06,235
All residents are hereby ordered to...

827
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,004
...be cautious

828
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:09,944
Your money, gold, jewelry...

829
01:36:10,037 --> 01:36:12,017
...and any other valuables...

830
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:14,119
...are not to be left unattended

831
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:17,220
Keep them locked in safe places

832
01:36:17,545 --> 01:36:19,786
The reward for his capture...

833
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,826
...is as follows

834
01:36:26,086 --> 01:36:28,066
For bringing in his severed head...

835
01:36:28,255 --> 01:36:29,893
...12 gold coins

836
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:33,204
For bringing him alive, eighteen

837
01:36:33,594 --> 01:36:35,574
Whoever tries to protect him...

838
01:36:35,896 --> 01:36:37,398
...man OI" woman...

839
01:36:37,565 --> 01:36:39,374
...boy or girl...

840
01:36:39,433 --> 01:36:41,936
...whoever be it, they shall be
punished...

841
01:36:42,202 --> 01:36:44,182
...in front of all the people of
this land...

842
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:47,013
...by me, Thananayik Keshava Kurup...

843
01:36:47,274 --> 01:36:48,981
...in person

844
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,104
All of us have ancestral jewelry, held
for generations...

845
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:12,004
...in our homes

846
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:14,112
He surely holds a grudge against us...

847
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:15,576
...for carrying out the punishment

848
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,611
In the kingdom of Cochin, at
Perumpadappu Swaroopam...

849
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:19,408
...we have our ancestral temple

850
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:22,850
If we can move our valuables to the
vaults there...

851
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:24,316
...we would be safe

852
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:26,491
But to get them there...

853
01:37:27,114 --> 01:37:28,923
...we need your help

854
01:37:29,016 --> 01:37:30,393
What sort of help?

855
01:37:30,651 --> 01:37:32,631
We need six of the Company's elephants

856
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:34,159
Just for two days

857
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:36,335
Since they are war-trained...

858
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:38,470
...the journey will be safe

859
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:00,559
We start at the crack of dawn

860
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:03,928
Everyone thinks we are heading for the
ancestral temple

861
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:06,094
It should remain secret

862
01:38:08,622 --> 01:38:11,364
At the southern end of the jungle
across the Achankovil river...

863
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,638
...by the slope of the Kallumala hill...

864
01:38:13,928 --> 01:38:15,271
...we will be waiting

865
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:18,373
When we take over the goods, you
will be paid the agreed amount

866
01:38:18,532 --> 01:38:20,512
There should be no haggling at that
point

867
01:38:22,002 --> 01:38:23,242
I am a Jewish merchant

868
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:26,250
I have in me the blood of those who paid
the agreed amount even to Judas...

869
01:38:26,307 --> 01:38:28,287
...who betrayed the Christ

870
01:38:28,976 --> 01:38:30,614
You only need to worry about Kochunni

871
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:33,124
Just make sure this gets there safe
without falling in his hands

872
01:38:34,982 --> 01:38:37,929
We have been in this land from before
Kochunni's days

873
01:38:38,018 --> 01:38:39,998
We also know paths he may not

874
01:38:40,087 --> 01:38:41,065
Alright

875
01:40:11,278 --> 01:40:13,258
Go! Attack!

876
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:10,536
Terrifying eyes and gaze...

877
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,812
Stubbly hair...his face and hands...

878
01:42:14,902 --> 01:42:15,880
...bear scars from wounds

879
01:42:16,237 --> 01:42:18,217
Like a wild beast...

880
01:42:18,339 --> 01:42:20,319
His face is nothing like before

881
01:42:41,796 --> 01:42:43,139
This is for the harvest festival

882
01:42:43,297 --> 01:42:45,868
You don't need to beg before any
landlord for that

883
01:42:47,701 --> 01:42:48,702
Come!

884
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,647
Get new clothes for the kids

885
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,822
Arrange for a feast with two kinds
of sweet dishes

886
01:42:56,977 --> 01:42:59,856
Everyone should forget the upper castes'
festival when they see ours!

887
01:43:08,422 --> 01:43:11,767
Can a Muslim make an offering, Chief?

888
01:43:15,796 --> 01:43:17,776
Just a wish!

889
01:43:20,735 --> 01:43:22,715
You are not of any caste to us!

890
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:31,456
I am thinking of putting up a stall
with the money you gave

891
01:43:31,779 --> 01:43:33,986
A place for tired can drivers and
labourers...

892
01:43:34,348 --> 01:43:35,986
...to have ginger tea and some boiled
tapioca

893
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:38,330
The boy can look after it when I am
not around

894
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:41,226
I have started work on it...just the
roof remains

895
01:43:45,259 --> 01:43:47,466
No, that's not necessaryml have
the money from last time

896
01:43:50,598 --> 01:43:52,578
This money is yours, Ittiyappa!

897
01:43:53,267 --> 01:43:55,247
When the landlord gets you to harvest
ten acres of land...

898
01:43:55,336 --> 01:43:57,543
...he gets over a thousand paras
of grain

899
01:43:57,705 --> 01:44:01,312
And you? 3 cups of grain, 5 paise and
atummyfull of hunger!

900
01:44:01,508 --> 01:44:03,681
If not for you, who would harvest
their lands?

901
01:44:03,944 --> 01:44:07,289
Lower caste men are not supposed to
set up a business

902
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:10,896
That's what they say!

903
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:16,692
I'll come...to have tea at your stall

904
01:44:22,296 --> 01:44:24,970
While you are taking care of people,
make sure you do it for everyone

905
01:44:25,299 --> 01:44:26,607
Ever since they lost you as a guardian.

906
01:44:26,734 --> 01:44:31,444
...Suhra's door has turned into one that
anyone can knock on, at any time

907
01:44:33,373 --> 01:44:35,353
If she has no one to speak for her...

908
01:44:35,476 --> 01:44:37,456
...she'll find it difficult to live

909
01:44:53,694 --> 01:44:57,335
Kochu Pillai is in charge of
the preparations for the festival

910
01:44:57,498 --> 01:45:01,674
And it seems Kochunni and Suhra
will get married the same day

911
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:04,316
That's what everyone is talking
about

912
01:45:04,571 --> 01:45:06,016
Hmm

913
01:45:12,713 --> 01:45:14,693
(Ritual chanting)

914
01:45:20,755 --> 01:45:22,325
At least smile, girl

915
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:24,025
Go on!

916
01:46:10,738 --> 01:46:12,718
Happy now, my child?

917
01:46:28,623 --> 01:46:30,603
- Come!
-Come!

918
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,209
Know your wood before you carve
it, Keshavan!

919
01:48:50,798 --> 01:48:55,008
(Translator repeats)

920
01:49:01,775 --> 01:49:05,222
This is the second time he came and
returned from right before your eyes!

921
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,659
Should we wait for the third as well?

922
01:49:07,982 --> 01:49:10,656
I am answerable to the Diwan

923
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:13,799
What is your next plan of action?

924
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:22,040
The question is for you, Keshavan!

925
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:33,151
Janaki!

926
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:51,170
Don't kill me, please!

927
01:50:00,167 --> 01:50:02,147
Run!

928
01:50:20,354 --> 01:50:22,334
Isn't this...the Vavvakad forest?

929
01:50:24,925 --> 01:50:26,370
Yes

930
01:50:27,628 --> 01:50:30,666
Isn't it around here that
the bandit Kochunni lives?

931
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:33,871
That's what people say

932
01:50:34,068 --> 01:50:36,048
Oh God! I did not think it would get
so dark!

933
01:50:36,403 --> 01:50:39,873
I got someone for company near the
Banyan tree...now I can't find him!

934
01:50:41,308 --> 01:50:42,685
And it isn'tjust Kochunni!

935
01:50:42,777 --> 01:50:45,223
They say a she-ghost also
roams through this forest

936
01:50:46,413 --> 01:50:47,391
Where are you going anyway?

937
01:50:47,715 --> 01:50:49,695
Evoor - my Uncle's place

938
01:50:50,284 --> 01:50:52,730
I've heard he targets upper caste people

939
01:50:52,887 --> 01:50:54,867
-And me - a true-blue Brahmin!
- Really?

940
01:50:54,955 --> 01:50:57,936
Of course! But in case Kochunni sees me,
he wouldn't understand that!

941
01:50:58,125 --> 01:51:02,130
I have put my sacred thread in my
dhothi fold till I cross the jungle!

942
01:51:03,063 --> 01:51:04,770
Which house do you belong to,
at Evoor?

943
01:51:04,899 --> 01:51:06,879
Ayyakutty Matham! Perhaps
you have heard of it

944
01:51:07,768 --> 01:51:09,076
<i>Wave</i>

945
01:51:09,436 --> 01:51:12,246
Let me get going! If you hear me
screaming please do come!

946
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:14,682
(chanting a prayer)
Arjunan, Phalgunan, Parthan, Vijayan...

947
01:51:14,809 --> 01:51:16,789
- Do you want me to come with you?
- Huh?

948
01:51:17,244 --> 01:51:18,450
Oh yes!

949
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,889
If I am with you, Kochunni won't come

950
01:51:20,948 --> 01:51:24,191
I'm so relieved! I feel like God
himself has appeared before me!

951
01:51:28,322 --> 01:51:30,302
- Walk on!
- Ok

952
01:51:39,767 --> 01:51:41,747
I have to get there before dawn

953
01:51:42,103 --> 01:51:43,878
There is a special pooja at the temple
tomorrow at dawn

954
01:51:44,138 --> 01:51:46,243
On the way, I took a nap under the
Banyan tree

955
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:50,820
That's why I got late...now the only way
to get there on time, is through here

956
01:51:51,512 --> 01:51:53,958
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Ok

957
01:51:54,248 --> 01:51:56,228
All the ornaments for the diety, are
with me

958
01:51:56,484 --> 01:51:58,930
But even if Kochunni attacks, he
wouldn't find them!

959
01:51:59,153 --> 01:52:01,497
-Ask me why?
- Why?

960
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:04,868
I have hidden them in my loincloth!

961
01:52:05,759 --> 01:52:07,067
- How clever of you!
- And it isn't just that...

962
01:52:07,161 --> 01:52:08,936
...
 have also learned some Karali

963
01:52:09,096 --> 01:52:11,076
- It's Kalari, not Karali!
- Right!

964
01:52:23,511 --> 01:52:25,491
Don't be scared! Come on in!

965
01:52:35,222 --> 01:52:37,202
Look! He's here!

966
01:52:37,992 --> 01:52:39,972
I met this man in the Vavvakkad forest

967
01:52:40,094 --> 01:52:42,074
He accompanied me all the way here!

968
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:45,174
That was kind of you!

969
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:47,412
We were worried about him

970
01:52:48,001 --> 01:52:49,981
Please wait for a bit

971
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:53,812
No!

972
01:52:57,077 --> 01:52:59,057
I don't want anything

973
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:01,893
That cannot be

974
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:04,830
Please accept what I give,
wholeheartedly

975
01:53:05,252 --> 01:53:07,232
But you already have, Lordship!

976
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:11,230
To a ten year old boy who everyone
drove away...

977
01:53:12,226 --> 01:53:15,366
...you gave a bowl full of tasty rice
gruel

978
01:53:18,099 --> 01:53:19,874
I can still feel the taste of it...

979
01:53:20,234 --> 01:53:22,214
...on my tongue and in my heart

980
01:53:24,038 --> 01:53:27,247
And it will remain there till the day
I die

981
01:53:39,253 --> 01:53:41,199
- Kochunni!
- Huh?

982
01:53:59,273 --> 01:54:01,253
He was carrying the ornaments for the
diety

983
01:54:04,044 --> 01:54:05,523
Do you know how much gold
that would be?

984
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:07,354
He belonged to a house I know

985
01:54:07,448 --> 01:54:09,428
So only the upper caste people you know
are good!

986
01:54:09,583 --> 01:54:11,961
That day when we were going to pull
down that store, you said the same thing

987
01:54:14,288 --> 01:54:16,996
Don't expect us to steal by your
rules!

988
01:54:17,491 --> 01:54:19,937
We may also have people who paid us
or did favours for us

989
01:54:20,194 --> 01:54:21,070
Drop it, Mam mad

990
01:54:21,195 --> 01:54:23,175
You can do whatever you want for
the people you care about

991
01:54:23,364 --> 01:54:26,174
Whether they are Chovas, Parayas or
Nayadis

992
01:54:26,367 --> 01:54:28,973
But from now on, we want our share

993
01:54:29,103 --> 01:54:31,083
And we will decide what to do with it

994
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:34,920
We want our families also to prosper

995
01:54:39,113 --> 01:54:41,423
If you only look upon this as a way to
feed your families...

996
01:54:41,648 --> 01:54:43,628
...you can leave. Now!

997
01:54:44,618 --> 01:54:47,394
Is Vavvakad your father's property that
you can order us away?

998
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:49,635
Stop it! What are you doing?

999
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:52,371
Don't try to be the leader here!

1000
01:54:52,693 --> 01:54:54,468
Huh?

1001
01:55:00,301 --> 01:55:01,905
It's just Vava!

1002
01:55:47,414 --> 01:55:49,394
- Did anyone see you?
- No

1003
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:51,928
I was just getting to sleep after some
work on my house...

1004
01:55:52,052 --> 01:55:54,430
She somehow escaped and got there

1005
01:55:56,691 --> 01:55:59,069
Look here! Wherever it is that you
want to go...

1006
01:55:59,227 --> 01:56:01,207
...before dawn, he...

1007
01:56:01,262 --> 01:56:02,935
...will drop you there

1008
01:56:07,434 --> 01:56:09,539
We may be here one day and somewhere
else the next

1009
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:11,750
We can't have you tagging along

1010
01:56:15,776 --> 01:56:17,756
Don't look at him! That was before!

1011
01:56:18,012 --> 01:56:19,992
He has a wife now

1012
01:56:28,689 --> 01:56:30,225
I'll go

1013
01:56:30,424 --> 01:56:33,564
I didn't mean to create any trouble
between you

1014
01:56:36,664 --> 01:56:38,644
I'll go

1015
01:56:42,002 --> 01:56:43,982
Where?

1016
01:56:45,606 --> 01:56:47,586
After I was driven away...

1017
01:56:48,475 --> 01:56:51,149
...
 was caught by Chinese
slave traders

1018
01:56:51,746 --> 01:56:53,726
The Englishman bought me from them

1019
01:56:54,448 --> 01:56:57,429
Because banished people cannot be
seen in the land again...

1020
01:56:58,619 --> 01:57:00,565
...he kept me in hiding

1021
01:57:01,455 --> 01:57:03,435
I came to ask for help

1022
01:57:05,826 --> 01:57:07,806
Not to my old lover

1023
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:11,110
But to Kayamkulam Kochunni

1024
01:57:16,804 --> 01:57:18,784
They will never get hold of me again

1025
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,620
Whether you help me or not

1026
01:57:24,078 --> 01:57:26,058
Goodbye

1027
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:35,826
There is only one thing that remains
the same in me

1028
01:57:37,391 --> 01:57:39,371
And that is my love for you, Janaki

1029
01:58:10,124 --> 01:58:12,536
When he came to know that I was your
girlfriend...

1030
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:15,363
...the Englishman had his revenge

1031
01:58:33,714 --> 01:58:35,694
If anyone wants to come with me,
they may

1032
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:45,566
There are many valuables in the
Englishman's vaults

1033
01:58:45,726 --> 01:58:47,706
Both from here and from their own
country

1034
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:52,811
I know where everything is

1035
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,575
Even if it's an escaped slave girl
who has returned...

1036
01:59:29,737 --> 01:59:31,580
...the Sahib will want to sleep
with her

1037
01:59:31,772 --> 01:59:33,183
He just needs women

1038
01:59:33,307 --> 01:59:35,253
Without spending at least a night
there...

1039
01:59:35,309 --> 01:59:37,289
...he won't send me back

1040
01:59:37,845 --> 01:59:40,382
There are seven doors that lead into
the Palace

1041
01:59:40,648 --> 01:59:43,185
The eastern one is guarded only at night

1042
01:59:43,417 --> 01:59:44,953
If you reach inside that door and climb
the stairs...

1043
01:59:45,285 --> 01:59:46,787
...you reach the top floor

1044
01:59:46,987 --> 01:59:48,967
That is where the vaults are

1045
01:59:49,623 --> 01:59:51,261
One floor above...

1046
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:54,301
...in the western wing, is the
Sahib's room

1047
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:36,809
This way! Come this way!

1048
02:02:05,025 --> 02:02:07,005
I have not loved anyone...

1049
02:02:07,094 --> 02:02:09,040
...not trusted anyone...

1050
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:11,708
...as much as I have loved and trusted
you

1051
02:02:12,433 --> 02:02:14,413
No one in this world, ever!

1052
02:02:14,768 --> 02:02:18,409
But, after I had my hair chopped and
got stoned out of this land...

1053
02:02:18,506 --> 02:02:20,713
...in just six months time...

1054
02:02:20,774 --> 02:02:23,880
...when I heard you were a husband, I
hated you like I have never hated anyone

1055
02:02:23,944 --> 02:02:26,083
Not the Adhikari who banished me...

1056
02:02:26,347 --> 02:02:29,590
...nor any foreigner who stripped me
and branded me a slave

1057
02:02:30,851 --> 02:02:34,128
But having helped to capture Kayamkulam
Kochunni, Janaki is no more a slave

1058
02:02:35,756 --> 02:02:38,566
That is my reward from the Thananayik -
a man of his word

1059
02:03:28,075 --> 02:03:31,488
See him! Whoever hasn't, see him now!

1060
02:03:31,612 --> 02:03:35,059
The biggest thief ever in this land!

1061
02:03:40,721 --> 02:03:43,600
No courtyard gates need to be shut
anymore

1062
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:45,930
No granaries need to be guarded

1063
02:03:46,126 --> 02:03:47,764
And to walk through Vavvakkad...

1064
02:03:47,895 --> 02:03:50,569
...no one needs to fear, day or night

1065
02:04:07,481 --> 02:04:09,154
Henceforth in Kayamkulam...

1066
02:04:09,517 --> 02:04:11,827
...there will be no Kochunni!

1067
02:05:08,943 --> 02:05:12,652
To think he was getting away with all
those thefts and plunders for so long!

1068
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:14,919
At least now we can go around without
fear

1069
02:05:15,049 --> 02:05:18,053
I heard they will take him to
Thiruvananthapuram tonight

1070
02:05:18,286 --> 02:05:20,698
And once there, he will be hanged
in four days

1071
02:05:20,788 --> 02:05:22,768
A guard at the police station told me

1072
02:05:25,126 --> 02:05:28,073
It took them an hour to bring down the
Englishman's body...

1073
02:05:28,195 --> 02:05:30,175
...so complicated were the knots he
used!

1074
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:34,545
He is said to have learned complicated
martial arts techniques somewhere

1075
02:05:34,668 --> 02:05:37,740
And what did he use them for? To steal
and now, murder!

1076
02:05:38,038 --> 02:05:41,611
Whatever you might say, there was
something about Kochunni!

1077
02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:45,785
Now that Maharajah Swathi Thirunal is
no more...

1078
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:48,187
...crimina
s need expect no mercy

1079
02:05:48,916 --> 02:05:49,894
Water

1080
02:07:38,326 --> 02:07:40,067
In the name of His Majesty, who
rules over Travancore..

1081
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:42,401
...the Maharajah Shri Uthram Thirunal...

1082
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:46,167
...his Diwan Shri T Madhava Rayar issues
this decree

1083
02:07:46,968 --> 02:07:48,413
Having failed to capture Kayamkulam
Kochunni...

1084
02:07:48,702 --> 02:07:51,148
...the bandit, by any means
till date...

1085
02:07:51,172 --> 02:07:54,381
...neither suppressing nor imprisoning
him...

1086
02:07:54,775 --> 02:07:58,052
...Thananayik Keshava Kurup is required,
12 days from today...

1087
02:07:58,178 --> 02:08:00,749
...to vacate his post and reach
Thiruvananthapuram...

1088
02:08:00,948 --> 02:08:03,121
...where he shall return the
official symbols of his position

1089
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,230
This is my order

1090
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,464
I need one more chance

1091
02:08:07,488 --> 02:08:10,128
Within these 12 days, I can get him
to come to the village

1092
02:08:10,891 --> 02:08:12,871
But I need your support for that

1093
02:08:14,295 --> 02:08:15,933
For the next twelve days...

1094
02:08:16,096 --> 02:08:17,774
...none of the low caste poor...

1095
02:08:17,798 --> 02:08:19,778
...should be given anything
they can eat

1096
02:08:20,268 --> 02:08:22,111
<i>Whether as wages or otherwise</i>

1097
02:08:22,269 --> 02:08:24,249
However m uch they might offer
to pay for it

1098
02:08:25,072 --> 02:08:27,052
Please issue the order

1099
02:08:29,176 --> 02:08:31,156
When the faithful cry out loud...

1100
02:08:31,312 --> 02:08:33,292
...God has to appear!

1101
02:08:35,216 --> 02:08:36,752
We don't need money

1102
02:08:36,817 --> 02:08:39,354
Please take this and give us some
tapioca or yams

1103
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:41,867
It's not that we don't want to, Chief

1104
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:44,367
But we've been told not to give you
even a grain of rice

1105
02:08:44,492 --> 02:08:46,472
We'll be banished!

1106
02:08:50,931 --> 02:08:53,343
From tomorrow they have ordered us not
to use this way when bringing goods

1107
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:56,482
Not just us - anyone! That's why they
are building that fence over there

1108
02:08:56,804 --> 02:08:58,147
It's two days since the children
had food!

1109
02:08:58,205 --> 02:09:00,185
Close it now!

1110
02:09:07,848 --> 02:09:09,828
The Englishman has been buried

1111
02:09:10,384 --> 02:09:13,228
He has a wife and kid back in England

1112
02:09:14,088 --> 02:09:16,068
And you might have heard about
the Adhikari

1113
02:09:16,991 --> 02:09:19,494
The injury was to his neck...he won't
walk again

1114
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:25,373
It was all made possible...

1115
02:09:25,499 --> 02:09:27,479
...through techniques he learnt here

1116
02:09:30,337 --> 02:09:33,250
Shouldn't we stop him, Thangal? With the
rules of Kalari?

1117
02:09:37,945 --> 02:09:39,925
If not, he will continue...

1118
02:09:41,982 --> 02:09:43,962
He will come

1119
02:09:44,084 --> 02:09:46,064
But if he is to not return...

1120
02:09:46,353 --> 02:09:48,333
...you should show me, your old
pupil...

1121
02:09:48,923 --> 02:09:50,903
...some move by which I can...

1122
02:09:51,125 --> 02:09:53,105
...stop him

1123
02:09:58,065 --> 02:10:00,045
Surely there must bemsomething

1124
02:10:01,435 --> 02:10:03,415
But you wil send him to the gallows,
won't you?

1125
02:10:04,038 --> 02:10:06,018
Without giving him an opportunity
to be reformed?

1126
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:08,220
Three years in prison

1127
02:10:11,245 --> 02:10:13,122
I shall personally request the Diwan...

1128
02:10:13,214 --> 02:10:14,557
...to make it just three years

1129
02:10:14,815 --> 02:10:16,795
- Is that your word?
- Upon you, my Guru!

1130
02:10:18,586 --> 02:10:20,998
Of the 72,000 nerve points...

1131
02:10:21,355 --> 02:10:23,335
...there will be a weak one...

1132
02:10:23,924 --> 02:10:25,904
...in any human being

1133
02:10:26,227 --> 02:10:28,207
If hurt at that point...

1134
02:10:28,262 --> 02:10:30,242
...any great warrior will fall

1135
02:10:32,867 --> 02:10:34,847
The person who knows exactly which
one it is...

1136
02:10:35,102 --> 02:10:37,082
...is a Guru alone!

1137
02:12:16,003 --> 02:12:19,212
Kochunni is here! Kochunni
is here!

1138
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:21,420
Kochunni is here!

1139
02:12:21,576 --> 02:12:23,556
Kochunni is here!

1140
02:12:24,211 --> 02:12:26,191
Kochunni is here!

1141
02:13:10,658 --> 02:13:13,002
- Come quick!
- Come on!

1142
02:13:20,234 --> 02:13:21,406
Kochunnﬂ

1143
02:13:21,602 --> 02:13:25,414
Everyone is at Kochu Pi

ai's house
Let's go this way

1144
02:13:31,278 --> 02:13:33,258
We have won, Kochu Pillai!

1145
02:13:34,148 --> 02:13:35,718
We have only just started!

1146
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:05,051
Your head must be feeling heavy

1147
02:14:05,313 --> 02:14:07,293
The liquor was laced with drugs

1148
02:14:10,684 --> 02:14:13,164
- Kochu Pillai!
- Parvathiyar Kochu Pillai!

1149
02:14:13,287 --> 02:14:15,267
That's how you should address him now

1150
02:14:16,624 --> 02:14:21,300
He should be respected too! The title of
‘Idava Muthalper‘ is now his!

1151
02:14:22,864 --> 02:14:24,844
For them, it was money to last for
the rest of their lives

1152
02:14:25,299 --> 02:14:27,711
That is all - the price they put to
Kochunni

1153
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:32,349
In this position, I can do everything we
always planned to do

1154
02:14:32,406 --> 02:14:35,148
When you are out in three years, this
land will be transformed!

1155
02:14:35,243 --> 02:14:38,554
You sold me out, took the payment for it
and now you dare to talk?

1156
02:14:38,746 --> 02:14:40,692
You son of a pig!

1157
02:14:40,815 --> 02:14:42,795
Take him away!

1158
02:15:38,839 --> 02:15:40,819
Hit him! In the center of his left knee

1159
02:15:48,749 --> 02:15:50,695
Vava?

1160
02:15:51,785 --> 02:15:53,765
If I didn't, they would kill you!

1161
02:15:53,921 --> 02:15:57,596
When you come out, I'll be there
for you!

1162
02:16:08,836 --> 02:16:10,816
In this. the year 1034...

1163
02:16:10,938 --> 02:16:12,576
...on the 7th day of the month
of Kanni...

1164
02:16:12,806 --> 02:16:16,652
...by consent of His Highness
the Maharajah Uthram Thirunal...

1165
02:16:16,811 --> 02:16:18,882
...the Honorable Diwan
Sri T Madhava Rayar...

1166
02:16:19,213 --> 02:16:20,954
...hereby decrees that...

1167
02:16:21,415 --> 02:16:22,894
...on the 9th day of Kanni...

1168
02:16:22,983 --> 02:16:24,795
...at five hours and thirty minutes
past midnight...

1169
02:16:24,819 --> 02:16:26,594
...the dreaded criminal Kochunni...

1170
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:28,800
...also known as Kayamkulam Kochunni...

1171
02:16:28,922 --> 02:16:31,903
...is sentencedmto death by hanging

1172
02:16:44,505 --> 02:16:47,247
- I am leaving
- The funeral prayers?

1173
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:48,648
I shall do it

1174
02:16:48,809 --> 02:16:51,619
The Book says they are to be done
by the closest kin

1175
02:16:51,945 --> 02:16:53,447
There is no need for a Khateeb

1176
02:16:53,514 --> 02:16:56,427
I shall personally take him...
to the grave

1177
02:16:57,951 --> 02:17:01,421
He has made a rule that no one
can see him in the prison...

1178
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:03,398
...the Thananayik!

1179
02:17:03,691 --> 02:17:05,466
My Kochunni will go to his death
believing he was betrayed...

1180
02:17:05,593 --> 02:17:08,369
...by the man he loved like God

1181
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:10,742
If only I had a chance to tell him
it wasn't so...

1182
02:17:12,767 --> 02:17:14,747
...oh God!

1183
02:17:17,505 --> 02:17:19,485
Thanga
...!

1184
02:17:29,016 --> 02:17:30,996
Ikka had given this for safekeeping

1185
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:34,299
I don't know if it will be of any use

1186
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:46,843
This will not change his sentence

1187
02:17:46,867 --> 02:17:50,007
But if I can get this to the Palace
before the sentence is carried out...

1188
02:17:53,907 --> 02:17:55,887
...
 can at least see him once

1189
02:17:56,009 --> 02:17:57,989
For sure!

1190
02:18:13,727 --> 02:18:14,865
You may bring him

1191
02:18:39,787 --> 02:18:41,664
Shall we go?

1192
02:18:42,323 --> 02:18:45,304
His Majesty, the King wants to
see you

1193
02:18:51,131 --> 02:18:53,111
- The arrangements?
- All done

1194
02:18:53,367 --> 02:18:54,903
Everything is ready, Your Highness

1195
02:18:55,035 --> 02:18:56,673
Before carrying out the sentence...

1196
02:18:56,737 --> 02:18:59,843
...this person has requested a short
meeting with the convict

1197
02:19:07,715 --> 02:19:10,594
But there is a sealed order from the
Diwan banning visitors

1198
02:19:12,486 --> 02:19:13,487
Show him

1199
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:26,608
Any one wish...

1200
02:19:26,767 --> 02:19:28,747
The Late King's decree...

1201
02:19:29,003 --> 02:19:30,914
...is still a royal decree

1202
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:31,949
As you say, Highness

1203
02:19:41,181 --> 02:19:43,161
I know

1204
02:19:43,784 --> 02:19:45,764
I was defeated...

1205
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,932
...not by Keshavanmnot by
Kochu Pillai...

1206
02:19:50,458 --> 02:19:52,438
...nor by Vava...

1207
02:19:52,659 --> 02:19:54,639
...or any troops of the Thana

1208
02:19:57,064 --> 02:20:00,477
If anyone can defeat Thanga
's
favorite pupil...

1209
02:20:01,769 --> 02:20:03,771
...it is only Thangal himself

1210
02:20:05,773 --> 02:20:08,481

know...and I am not sad

1211
02:20:10,077 --> 02:20:12,057
When I say my prayers each day...

1212
02:20:13,914 --> 02:20:15,894
...there is a face I see in my mind

1213
02:20:20,921 --> 02:20:22,901
Before I die...

1214
02:20:24,858 --> 02:20:26,838
...
 am glad I could see it once more

1215
02:20:28,028 --> 02:20:30,008
But...

1216
02:20:30,598 --> 02:20:32,009
...why did you do it, Thangal?

1217
02:20:32,065 --> 02:20:34,944
To people who don't know Kayamkulam
Kochunni, he is a thief...

1218
02:20:35,202 --> 02:20:36,909
...And a murderer

1219
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:39,573
I did not know Kayamkulam Kochunni

1220
02:20:39,706 --> 02:20:44,155
Till I saw the hundreds waiting outside
to receive his body

1221
02:20:44,511 --> 02:20:48,186
Till I knew that he was God...to the
hungry

1222
02:20:48,682 --> 02:20:50,059
Thank you

1223
02:20:50,117 --> 02:20:53,223
For not making a mistake with any
move I taught you

1224
02:20:53,687 --> 02:20:56,668
For being my PUP"

1225
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:04,234
We have to part now

1226
02:21:04,598 --> 02:21:07,511
Shall I recite the Salath for you?

1227
02:21:59,253 --> 02:22:03,133
Live long, our land and its towns...

1228
02:22:03,624 --> 02:22:07,766
Live long, our homes and heritage

1229
02:22:07,895 --> 02:22:11,775
Live long, our forests and fields

1230
02:22:11,898 --> 02:22:16,779
Kochunni of Kayamkulam - may you live
long

1231
02:22:17,037 --> 02:22:20,780
May our hearths and baskets be full

1232
02:22:20,974 --> 02:22:24,751
Live long, our soil and trees

1233
02:22:24,812 --> 02:22:28,624
Live long, water and air

1234
02:22:28,782 --> 02:22:32,161
Kochunni of Kayamkulam - may you love
long

1235
02:22:32,686 --> 02:22:36,327
Live long, our land and its towns...

1236
02:22:36,557 --> 02:22:40,198
Live long, our homes and heritage

1237
02:22:40,327 --> 02:22:44,139
Live long, our forests and fields

1238
02:22:44,198 --> 02:22:48,044
Kochunni of Kayamkulam - may you
Hvelong

1239
02:22:48,068 --> 02:22:51,709
May our hearths and baskets be full

1240
02:22:51,939 --> 02:22:55,648
Live long, our soil and trees

1241
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:59,622
Live long, water and air

1242
02:22:59,679 --> 02:23:02,785
Kochunni of Kayamkulam - may you
Hvelong

1243
02:23:14,761 --> 02:23:17,640
Kochunni of Kayamkulam - may you
live long

1244
02:23:21,802 --> 02:23:23,782
It was my fervent prayer, Thangal...

1245
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:25,348
...ever since you chose him over me...

1246
02:23:25,673 --> 02:23:27,653
".85 your SUCCESSOI‘...

1247
02:23:27,775 --> 02:23:29,982
...that I should be able to witness this
with you, my Guru

1248
02:23:31,245 --> 02:23:33,350
Too bad God did not listen, Keshavan!

1249
02:23:36,917 --> 02:23:38,328
What I said into his ears...

1250
02:23:38,385 --> 02:23:40,365
...did you really think it was a
funereal prayer?

1251
02:23:41,321 --> 02:23:43,301
I am a Guru! Both his and yours!

1252
02:23:47,728 --> 02:23:48,331
See it now!

1253
02:23:48,896 --> 02:23:51,638
A move I never taught any of my pupils

1254
02:23:51,899 --> 02:23:54,880
<i>Starting off</i> with <i>a ‘Ganapathy Ankam‘
and moving</i> into <i>a ‘Garuda karanam‘...</i>

1255
02:23:55,069 --> 02:23:55,945
...before ending in a ‘puli ankam‘...

1256
02:23:56,069 --> 02:23:59,983
An intricate set of 36 steps involving
64 elements

1257
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:03,344
You wouldn't be able to do it
in seven lifetimes, Keshavan!

1258
02:24:03,677 --> 02:24:05,884
And you can neither stop him,
nor win!

1259
02:24:14,922 --> 02:24:18,392
(Kalari instructions recited)

1260
02:28:11,425 --> 02:28:13,405
Kochunnﬂ

1261
02:28:46,193 --> 02:28:48,173
Kochunnﬂ

1262
02:29:34,975 --> 02:29:36,545
In the district of Pathanamthitta...

1263
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:39,350
...in the village of Kozhencherry...

1264
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:43,223
...in <i>the Idappara Maladevar Nada
Temple...</i>

1265
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:46,090
...this Mussalman lives to this day

1266
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:48,691
Standing for the poor and hungry...

1267
02:29:49,056 --> 02:29:51,332
..beyond notions of caste and religion"

1268
02:29:52,092 --> 02:29:54,072
...a divine ideal...

1269
02:29:54,528 --> 02:29:57,407
Kayamkulam Kochunni!
