00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:37,595
'On the evening of 8th November...'

3
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,830
'...the Indian government took a
historical decision of demonetization.'

4
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:42,632
'And with this decision...'

5
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,536
'...the entire nation has openly
declared war on black-money.'

6
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:48,403
'According to some speculations
because of demonetization...'

7
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,003
'...more than 4000 billion black-money
will be out of the system'.

8
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:55,683
'Today the poor and the honest people
of the country are happy...'

9
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,845
'...whereas those who accumulated
black-money are mourning.'

10
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,545
'Another question which is
still lurking in everyone's mind...'

11
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,818
'...is what about the black-money
hidden overseas.'

12
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,987
'According to Bank of
Italy’s senior economist...'

13
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:14,260
'...more than 181 billion dollar of India’s
wealth is hidden in banks overseas.'

14
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,605
'lf all of this money
can be brought back, then...'

15
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,608
'... 1 .5 million can actually be credited
in every poor Indian’s account.'

16
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,674
'Or all the essential
infrastructure projects...'

17
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:28,581
'...like roads, electricity, bridges, rail
and dams can be completed before time.'

18
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:33,355
'Every year more than 4000 Indian
farmers commit suicide...'

19
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,319
'...due to drought,
loan or crop damage.'

20
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,553
'lf the black-money hidden overseas
can be brought back...'

21
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,722
'...then no farmer will ever have
to commit suicide.'

22
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,891
'But is such a thing really possible
in our country?'

23
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,905
Reza... there's bad news for you.

24
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,950
- You are going to be encountered.
- Encounter?

25
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,012
Get out of there immediately...
you don't have much time.

26
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,847
- But who will encounter your men?
- Don't know.

27
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,823
lt's someone from outside the system.

28
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,316
We don't have any
information about him.

29
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,759
Now... get out!

30
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,542
Bala... get up.

31
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:40,513
Time for action.

32
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,830
This place is like a fort.

33
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,331
Look at all the guards.

34
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,065
Just be there on time.

35
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,855
l'll say just two words...

36
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,086
and you will tell me
the rest of the story.

37
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,851
Vicky Chaddha.

38
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,065
He's the biggest agent...

39
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:01,394
who launders money of all
the bigwigs of lndia.

40
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,835
But you won't be able to catch him.

41
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:06,271
Because Vicky Chaddha fled
to Malaysia today.

42
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,812
Bala... Vicky Chaddha fled to Malaysia.

43
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,516
- Now... draw your gun.
- But... But l told you everything.

44
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,847
- Bala... fire two bullets...
- Hey...

45
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,718
At Me...

46
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:21,823
What do you mean?

47
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,825
First bullet here,
in the leg anywhere.

48
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,826
But, avoid the femoral artery.

49
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,385
- Or else l will bleed to death on the way.
- What are you saying?

50
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:31,955
second bullet here,
on the side of the liver.

51
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,527
Exactly here.

52
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,460
Have you lost your mind?

53
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,501
No, lt's not me, it's the system.

54
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,631
l came all the way
to Taiwan for you...

55
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,073
yet, l will have to prove
that the encounter was genuine.

56
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:43,641
- But why do you want to encounter me?
- Bala ready?

57
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,680
You're not a cardboard cutout Karan.

58
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,615
- There are no dots on you.
- Then imagine it.

59
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,810
Why do you want to
get yourself killed?

60
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,751
No one's so lucky to get shot in
the exact place and survive.

61
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:53,810
Bala, shoot!

62
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:55,888
Shoot!

63
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,324
l told you... don't do it.

64
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,628
- No need to be so happy... your turn will also come.
- Me... me...

65
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:06,531
Why me?

66
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:07,767
What is he saying?

67
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:08,632
What is he saying?

68
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,262
- Bala, liver...
- No-no-no...

69
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,540
Really?

70
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,966
What's going on?

71
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,001
Now the court will believe, that...

72
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,749
you snatched the gun from
Bala's hand and shot me.

73
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,885
Goodbye, Reza.

74
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:32,756
Bala... place your gun in his hands.

75
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,420
But he told you everything,
so why did we kill him?

76
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,557
He wasn't going to
do any good staying alive.

77
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:13,993
Good morning sir
- Good morning.

78
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,601
Sir...

79
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,649
Does your parents
know that their son...

80
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:35,315
who used to be a normal person,
is doing such tricks now.

81
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,955
Sir, they know... that our life is
always infested by danger.

82
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:40,791
l see...

83
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,061
But do they know that their son
can get himself shot...

84
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,598
and only to prove in the court
that it wasn't an encounter.

85
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,899
l mean you've become
a trigger-happy man, Karan.

86
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:51,533
That's genuinely how it happened.

87
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,336
Do you really think that
l am that stupid?

88
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,039
l should've let you be a Commando.

89
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,808
Bringing you in the
Special Cell was a mistake.

90
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,009
Sir, l am a Commando...

91
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,482
and will always be one.

92
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:09,314
Changing uniforms
doesn't change my duties.

93
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:13,423
Okay...

94
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:17,557
So... when are you
coming back to office?

95
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,369
Well Reza's information came in handy.

96
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,674
Our two-year long mission
is finally completed.

97
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,579
Vicky Chaddha was arrested
in Malaysia yesterday.

98
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,811
lf the prey is already in the net...

99
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,377
then why call the hunter back?

100
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,947
Because there's a twist in the story.

101
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,599
Good morning sir...

102
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,765
Good morning... Good morning...
please sit down.

103
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,601
- Good morning, sir. Good morning.
- Bala... how are you?

104
00:14:58,674 --> 00:14:59,572
Please...

105
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,448
- Vicky Chaddha.
- Which one?

106
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,249
People say all of them.

107
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,392
And this is the one who
was recently apprehended.

108
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,835
Vicky Chaddha keeps
changing his faces.

109
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:31,702
And we don't know whether
the current face he has...

110
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,742
is the real one or not.

111
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:38,479
And that makes him more dangerous.

112
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:41,808
He handles money for a lot of
people of lndia...

113
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,943
People who are quite powerful
and control the entire system.

114
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,688
And the worst thing is,
we don't know who they are.

115
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,283
Vicky Chaddha is the biggest
part of this network.

116
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,391
He is the one who controls
the entire network.

117
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,492
But sir, you haven't told me
the twist in the story yet.

118
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:05,502
Only the Special Cell
knows about his arrest.

119
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,772
And it's a ticking time-bomb.

120
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,980
We must first tap the phones
of all the power-brokers in Delhi.

121
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,617
After that we must publicize the news
of Vicky Chaddha's arrest in the media.

122
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,245
When this news turns
into a sensation...

123
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,017
they will definitely react.

124
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,554
And all we need is a single mistake.

125
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,560
The Malaysian Police
apprehended Vicky Chaddha...

126
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:29,256
along with his wife Maria
in Kuala Lumpur.

127
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:31,526
This is believed to be
a big achievement...

128
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,965
in the government's efforts
to bring the black-money money back.

129
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:37,028
The question still lingers whether
the government will stop at Vicky Chaddha?

130
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:40,366
Or will they apprehend the benefactors
of Vicky Chaddha.

131
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,501
According to sources Vicky Chaddha
has been laundering...

132
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,511
more than 1000 billion rupees,
plundered from the country...

133
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,376
in overseas banks.

134
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,043
Ma'am, can you please tell us...

135
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,877
why it took you so long
to apprehend Vicky Chaddha?

136
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:52,646
Ma'am...

137
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,712
Ma'am, the people of the nation
are quite angry...

138
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:56,017
They want answers!

139
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,584
Please answer us.

140
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,527
We can understand people's rage.

141
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,526
We will bring Vicky Chaddha back soon.

142
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:07,362
And also apprehended those
who are associated with him.

143
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:12,001
The day isn't far, when the money
plundered from every poor Indian...

144
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,401
will be credited
back to his account.

145
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,600
That's our promise.

146
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,869
What's wrong, Mr. Runwal?

147
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:23,484
Dishank, what are you mother-son up to?

148
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:25,385
l've heard that your mother...

149
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:28,350
is going to deposit our money
in the accounts of the people.

150
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,687
Mr. Runwal,
you know one has to say these things.

151
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,521
She is the Home Minister.

152
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:35,027
Everyone contributed in this because
of their faith in me and Kamath.

153
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,891
Mr. Runwal, it's not just your
and your people's money he has.

154
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,365
He has my money too.

155
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,334
Nothing's going to happen.

156
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:42,798
Mom knows that if l get involved...

157
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,395
then the government
can crumble down.

158
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,504
Please... relax.

159
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:51,344
Mom...

160
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,679
Mom, if Vicky Chaddha returns safely...

161
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,254
and exposes everyone, then
either l'll have to shoot myself...

162
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:04,824
or these people will kill me.

163
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,661
You've succeeded in doing what the
opposition couldn't do all these years.

164
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,299
You made me lose.

165
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,561
Mom... no... mom

166
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,535
- Leave..
- But mom...

167
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:18,903
Just leave, Dishank.

168
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,370
There's...

169
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:55,670
There's a big problem.

170
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:01,545
Why aren't we getting
any definite report...

171
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,208
about the situation in Malaysia?

172
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,245
the paperwork for bringing
Vicky Chaddha back is in process.

173
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,846
And the Malaysian government
has given us permission...

174
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,516
to shift him to a safe-house.

175
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,834
Let's not forget that we've made
a big promise to the people.

176
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,665
lt's the question of their faith.

177
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,840
Our priority isn't just bringing
Vicky Chaddha back...

178
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,711
but also finding the money.

179
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,747
Otherwise people
will lose faith in us.

180
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:46,918
Leela...

181
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,490
Yes, of course... of course.

182
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,734
lt's just like we suspected.

183
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,965
Some brokers,
politicians and businessmen...

184
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,703
have completely
switched to silent-mode.

185
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,638
Now they will meet face-to-face...

186
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,873
and hatch a plan to
get out of this situation.

187
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:10,679
- But... there must be numerous places where they can meet...
- Exactly sir!

188
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:13,580
And that's why we will keep an eye...

189
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,054
on every party, every
five-star hotel, every wedding...

190
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:18,815
and all those places where such deals
are done, and will wait for them.

191
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:05,467
- Bala, l want their room numbers.
- Let me check.

192
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:06,873
Yes, Karan.

193
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:10,272
Home Minister Leela Chaudhary has just
reached Hotel Park International.

194
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:11,471
Her son is there too.

195
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,041
What does that prove?

196
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:14,815
Well, we've got some
interesting footage.

197
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:15,679
Take a look.

198
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,028
Sir Home Minister's
son Dishank is meeting them.

199
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,928
But Karan... these are
all very powerful people.

200
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,937
And it's really a big risk for you.

201
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,567
l've never enjoyed taking
small risks, sir.

202
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,472
Karan, just got the message.

203
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:47,773
Presidential Suite... 650.

204
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:41,619
Just before his arrest,
Vicky has transferred all our money...

205
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:47,431
the entire 1000 billion rupees
to some unknown account.

206
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:50,562
And he has neither left any paper
trail nor electronic.

207
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,471
All the details are inside his head.

208
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,941
And that is why killing
him will be stupidity.

209
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:58,709
and anyways my mom's going to
send a team of handpicked officers...

210
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,304
to bring him back.

211
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:04,408
Dishank, we want to meet your mom...
as soon as possible.

212
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,544
Let us know her plan.

213
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,611
We need to know who all
are there in her team...

214
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:09,554
- Mr. Runwal...
- who are bringing Vicky back.

215
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:11,524
Mr. Runwal, don't worry.

216
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,527
Please... please don't worry.

217
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,990
That team will consist
of people vetted by us.

218
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,527
Vicky Chaddha may try
to escape on the way...

219
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:25,266
or maybe someone
might come to his rescue.

220
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,432
Or even kill him.

221
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,306
And that's why we're
sending our best team.

222
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,883
Our team is being
headed by ACP Bakhtawar.

223
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,766
Sir, the crowd is growing big.

224
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:02,272
Shall l order for baton charge!

225
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,613
no... it's a peaceful protest.

226
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,940
We cannot use force on them.

227
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,485
There's not much difference
between a police dog...

228
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,884
a horse drawing a cart and
the politician's favorite Bakhtawar.

229
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:18,451
He will return only after fulfilling
the order given to him.

230
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:24,697
Yes...

231
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:26,992
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,635
You have only 30 minutes, Bakhtawar.

233
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:33,271
- Clear the road.
- Sure, ma'am.

234
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:13,241
Bhavna Reddy,
our encounter specialist.

235
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,978
She's more of a 'gun-for-hire'.

236
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:46,710
Give her information and money...

237
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,339
and she will kill any gangster.

238
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,382
No...

239
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:54,543
Good bye.

240
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,622
Shetty's name's been
scratched off too.

241
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:06,560
Gabbar Gang, Total finished.

242
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:09,569
English and imported
items both are her weakness.

243
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,439
There's a rumor in
the police circle...

244
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,746
that she killed gangster Lal Singh
just for a Gucci bag.

245
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:40,361
She aims to be as rich as
the poverty she has seen.

246
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:43,329
Our Cyber Cell's
most talented officer.

247
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:44,762
Zafar Hussain.

248
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:50,637
You have only 60 seconds...
to hack these terrorist accounts.

249
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,758
30...

250
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,663
10...

251
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,367
- Five...
- No!

252
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:22,534
Four...

253
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:25,337
- Three...
- No-no-no...

254
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,606
Two...

255
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:27,909
One...

256
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,428
Not bad.

257
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,657
Welcome to the force.

258
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:48,998
60 seconds! Wow! That's impressive.

259
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,000
Wasn't your record in system's
hacking 90 seconds?

260
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:55,538
he's cleverer than you.

261
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:57,572
But he's never held a gun.

262
00:28:57,812 --> 00:28:59,973
This man should've
been on Facebook staff.

263
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,349
Not in this team.

264
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:04,977
And Sharad Pandey.

265
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:06,779
l've seen him with you.

266
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,522
Thank you.

267
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:14,854
He's the sycophant-in-chief.

268
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:18,232
He will be madam's
eyes and ears on this team.

269
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,773
They have chosen
such a pathetic team...

270
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,000
their intentions can't be good.

271
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,705
The team is good, madam.

272
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,907
But we want to know your plan.

273
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,380
They will bring Vicky
Chaddha to lndia...

274
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,644
and will take
him straight to Tihar.

275
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,878
He'll be kept in solitary
confinement in Tihar.

276
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,614
Officers chosen by
the Home Minister...

277
00:29:40,688 --> 00:29:42,349
will make him spill
the beans about the money.

278
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:43,788
And will they only kill him?

279
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,460
Since l am the Home Minister,
my plan is slightly better.

280
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,798
There will be a riot in jail,
Vicky will get hurt...

281
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:56,302
and on the way
to the hospital he'll...

282
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,734
Now l must come out in the open.

283
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:02,433
lt's time to infiltrate the team.

284
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:04,836
You got the team you wanted.

285
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,642
No more charades now.

286
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,611
Don't let those jokers
anywhere near Vicky.

287
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:14,686
Just bring him back to lndia.

288
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,290
There is no room for mistakes,
Bakhtawar.

289
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:23,530
Consider it done, ma'am.

290
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,858
And anyway, Bakhtawar has never
failed to carry out any orders.

291
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,947
- Hello, sir. Zafar.
- l know.

292
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:55,591
lt seems Ma'am misunderstood the word
undercover as without cover.

293
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,971
Why hasn't Pandey reached yet?

294
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:21,683
Why scared? My name's Bhavna Reddy.

295
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:26,883
- You Jafar.
- Z-Zafar..

296
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:28,450
Yeah... Jafar.

297
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,290
- Computer man.
- Yeah...

298
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,592
ln police?

299
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,632
Police don't need computer,
they need gun.

300
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:40,641
Why you?

301
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:46,610
- A... actually, in today's world...
- Do you know better, or do l?

302
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,540
Forget it.

303
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:52,677
Everyone is saying that l am
looking super-stylish today.

304
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,422
- Sir!
- Sir!

305
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,816
lt's boarding time already
and Pandey hasn't reached.

306
00:31:57,892 --> 00:31:58,984
Am l on time?

307
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:07,732
- l am Karan...
- Pandey.

308
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,394
Karan Pandey.

309
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:10,932
You're 52 years old.

310
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,472
l read it in your report.

311
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,437
You've really maintained
yourself very well.

312
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,543
Pandey didn't maintain himself...
he's got a stroke.

313
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:19,343
And l am taking his place.

314
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:26,648
You will slip on this soap...

315
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:29,013
and hit your head on that,
and you'll be dead.

316
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:35,357
l've 50 ways to kill you between here and
the airport, making it look like an accident

317
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,994
and no one will know.

318
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:40,764
You're going to the hospital
and not the airport.

319
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,326
And what if l agree?

320
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:45,064
You'll say that you've got a stroke.

321
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,434
We've made all the preparations
in the hospital.

322
00:32:49,577 --> 00:32:51,306
Pandey, what's wrong?

323
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,504
Say something, Pandey!

324
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,906
Like l said, ma'am, it's a stroke.

325
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,946
How can he speak?

326
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:01,480
- Suddenly?
- lt happens suddenly, ma'am.

327
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,585
Can happen to anyone.

328
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:05,624
You guys take so much stress.

329
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,853
Even you...

330
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,774
Doctor, will l be fine?

331
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,435
We're all cooperating.

332
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:27,412
lf you will also cooperate,
then maybe...

333
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:31,878
l didn't know that Karan will turn out
to be such a rascal.

334
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:34,681
These are my papers.

335
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,283
Do you know who l am?

336
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,022
This is my first time
going out of country.

337
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:44,491
l've packed some really fashionable
and stylish looking clothes.

338
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,590
They will look amazing
on foreign locations.

339
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,029
- What are you going to buy from foreign?
- What?

340
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:53,933
l mean Armani perfume, Apple phone,
Ray Ban sunglasses, Rolex watch...

341
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:55,532
We're not going there for shopping.

342
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,504
These white-collar criminals
are such pushovers.

343
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,878
You don't need to be stressed
about bringing them back.

344
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,646
Take a flight... apprehend him...

345
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,777
catch a flight again.

346
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,777
What else will one do in-between?

347
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:09,550
- Shopping.
- Shopping.

348
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,454
Ma'am, there's some Karan
here instead of Pandey...

349
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,427
Pandey's got a stroke... suddenly!

350
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,431
And the Special Cell recommended
his name almost immediately.

351
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,700
He was a commando
with the 9 Para-troopers.

352
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:25,702
He was court-martialed... for
killing civilians in broad-daylight.

353
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,497
Doesn't believe in rules.

354
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,370
He's dangerous... keep an eye on him.

355
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,278
Finally l am here...
on foreign soil.

356
00:35:05,513 --> 00:35:07,504
Everything's so nice here.

357
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:11,010
Even the airport flooring
is way more beautiful...

358
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:12,547
than the one's in Jaya Aunt's home.

359
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:15,654
These guys are way ahead
in cleanliness as well.

360
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:19,518
- Hello... How nice! Can l click a photo of your daughter?
- No!

361
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:20,457
Shut up!

362
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,822
Sweetheart, smile... say cheese.

363
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,995
- Evidence of foreign holidays is 101 % compulsory.
- Yes!

364
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,405
- Hi, l am Shrinath Iyer...
- Hi.

365
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,702
From the Indian Embassy.

366
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,936
Hi, ACP Bakhtawar
Khan and this is my team.

367
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:38,909
Zafar.

368
00:35:40,614 --> 00:35:44,846
- Mr. Iyer, is there a shopping mall close to the airport?
- No!

369
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:47,987
We'll go straight to the safe-house.

370
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,480
Okay.

371
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,997
This place is littered with roads.

372
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,725
And that too so clean.

373
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:00,594
White-washed.

374
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,969
Clean pollution.

375
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:15,549
Mr. Iyer, can we stop please.

376
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,318
We can click few pictures
in outdoor locations

377
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,487
What to do?

378
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:24,456
My brother Raju has
been insisting on Whatsapp.

379
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:25,321
Okay...

380
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,987
Mr. Iyer, please handover Vicky's
phone and laptop to Zafar.

381
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,393
Sure.

382
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:33,022
Zafar, Bhavna... and everybody.

383
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,496
We'll only record statements
of Vicky and his wife.

384
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:39,268
We don't have the power
to interrogate them.

385
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:42,369
l'll give that Chaddha
one tight hug...

386
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:44,434
Your hands and feet
are slaves to my orders.

387
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:47,811
My hands and feet
don't even obey my order

388
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:49,975
But you can always try.

389
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:21,839
Ma'am, Karan's going to be a problem.

390
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,509
lf he interferes in your job,
then shoot him.

391
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:26,250
l will handle everything back here.

392
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:43,427
Yes... go.

393
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:45,838
Go for the kill...
Go for the kill...

394
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:48,739
Go-go-go... just kill it!

395
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:14,265
Hey, guys.

396
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:20,900
Seriously,
you guys are showing such attitude...

397
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:23,239
as if you've surrounded
the ISIS chief.

398
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,004
But trust me,
when you will find out the truth...

399
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,346
you won't stop laughing,
just like...

400
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:37,851
Sorry. So sorry...

401
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,662
My love.

402
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:55,998
She's hot, isn't she?

403
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:58,877
l know.

404
00:38:59,279 --> 00:38:59,973
Maria.

405
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:01,911
ACP Bakhtawar Khan.

406
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,914
We assure you, if you'll cooperate...

407
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,686
we will behave in a very
civilized manner with you.

408
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,388
We also assure you, our
full cooperation officer.

409
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,860
- Maria...
- A... A...

410
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,484
Waste fellow.

411
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,257
lt's really hard for him to speak.

412
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:20,300
He only ever spoke to
spectacle girls all his life.

413
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,769
- Myself Reddy...
- Hi.

414
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:25,896
Bhavna Reddy.

415
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,898
Inspector. Encounter Inspector.

416
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,300
Your lipstick's shade
is really stylish.

417
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,637
- Where did you buy it from?
- Thank you, inspector.

418
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,239
l really don't remember.

419
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,959
- l didn't get your name.
- l didn't give it.

420
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:06,912
Vicky, your medicines
are right there...

421
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,572
but you will never
take them on your own.

422
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,720
No one can imagine.

423
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,015
- That he's such a dangerous criminal?
- No.

424
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,782
That he has such a hot wife.

425
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:23,758
l am alive because of her.

426
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,932
And she only has kept me alive.

427
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:31,904
Enough praising me,
now come on... take it.

428
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:34,306
lf you are done with
your romantic episode...

429
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:35,932
then, can we get back to work?

430
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:38,876
Ohh man.. l am scared...

431
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,641
..my hands are trembling.

432
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:49,351
Listen...

433
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,557
Listen you holier-than-thou
piece of sh**

434
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:54,924
l'm just a rumor...

435
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:58,829
spread by the corrupt and rascal
politicians of my country.

436
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,267
Black-money is equal to Vicky Chaddha.
Chapter over!

437
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,874
They were looking for a scapegoat...

438
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:10,876
and they chose me.

439
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:12,745
Don't you get that, dammit.

440
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,474
l haven't done anything.

441
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:19,884
Vicky. Calm down.

442
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:28,522
Don't trust him.

443
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:31,329
After the demonetization
it's even more important...

444
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:33,025
that you bring
Vicky Chaddha back to lndia.

445
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,033
lf anything happens
to him out there...

446
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:37,665
then his people
here will go berserk.

447
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,564
lt will be a war.

448
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:41,739
Yeah.

449
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:42,935
Bring him back to lndia safely.

450
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,650
What do you guys think?

451
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:00,593
According to me.

452
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:02,720
Vicky is smarter than you think.

453
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:05,595
So stop racking your brains.

454
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:09,961
Just follow the orders.

455
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,676
l saw, you were completely mesmerized
seeing his wife.

456
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,840
Ladies and Police instinct.

457
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:27,979
Correct? Tell me.

458
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:30,384
Zafar.

459
00:42:31,725 --> 00:42:33,420
Mr. Iyer gave you Vicky's laptop,
didn't he?

460
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:33,925
Yes...

461
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:35,586
So let's get some work done.

462
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:50,307
lt's completely clean.

463
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:51,067
He's erased everything...

464
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:52,073
and rebooted the system.

465
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:53,973
Vicky Chaddha should've
been in the Cyber Cell.

466
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,408
He's definitely planning
something, Zafar.

467
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,551
What's brewing in your mind,
Vicky Chaddha?

468
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,028
- Mr. Iyer.
- There's a problem, Mr. Bakhtawar.

469
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:18,435
The police arrested four sharpshooters
entering in Malaysia.

470
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:19,904
Dubai connection.

471
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,508
This can't be a coincidence.

472
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:26,637
l feel they will either
attack Vicky or us.

473
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:36,984
Zafar...

474
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,788
if you were so
interested in computers...

475
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:41,324
then why didn't you join lT?

476
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:42,892
Why did you become a police officer?

477
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,761
You must have heard my name properly.

478
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:50,893
Zafar Hussain.

479
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:55,366
Owing to my name,
how many people do you think...

480
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:57,034
Would believe that l am a patriot?

481
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:01,542
This fact... really hurt me.

482
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:06,316
And l decided to do
something for the country.

483
00:44:07,788 --> 00:44:09,585
Even give up my life if l have to.

484
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,820
Whether it'll be the police,
army... or anything.

485
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:20,330
But it's not my fault that...

486
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,493
God gave me more
brains than brawns.

487
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,971
But no matter what you say, sir...

488
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,667
- l am still a police officer.
- Absolutely.

489
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:30,341
Your choice maybe different...

490
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,039
But serving the country...

491
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:37,416
is much more fun
than anything else.

492
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:39,645
You say such meaningful things,
Commando...

493
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,881
l am sure you hit just as hard.

494
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:46,352
Let there be a fight,
and l'll show you what l've got.

495
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,886
Well, l'll see you.

496
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:50,591
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

497
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:53,659
The moment l entered, he left.

498
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:55,859
l guess he's scared of me.

499
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:02,263
Tomorrow morning at 9am...

500
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:03,536
we will be taken back to lndia.

501
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:11,648
lf they take us to lndia tomorrow...

502
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:17,482
We will never be able
to avenge Tara again.

503
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:29,268
Karan, we've conclusive information...

504
00:45:29,336 --> 00:45:30,325
As soon as Vicky
arrives in Tihar Jail...

505
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:32,668
they will get the information
on the money and then kill him.

506
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:34,272
Sir, Vicky won't make it to lndia.

507
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,404
As soon as everyone falls asleep...

508
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:37,636
l will sneak into his room
and get all the information.

509
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:39,372
Those rascals won't get anything.

510
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:49,345
l'll call you back, sir.

511
00:46:04,504 --> 00:46:07,302
- Excuse me...
- Vicky's sleeping.

512
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:09,504
You didn't come here to tuck me in.

513
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:11,971
You speak well.

514
00:46:12,546 --> 00:46:14,537
Well you inspire me to.

515
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:16,544
You're smart as well.

516
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,444
lf you keep staring like this...

517
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,944
then l won't be able
to think anymore.

518
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,282
And you've this unique stare...

519
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:30,452
Because you look so amazing.

520
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,701
You thought this is
why l came here, right?

521
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:42,501
l admit... it's not easy to resist you.

522
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:47,269
But l madly love that guy on
the wheelchair who's my husband.

523
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,440
Away from the hustle-bustle
of the city of Dubai...

524
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:53,880
we had a home in
a very serene locality.

525
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:56,988
Vicky, me and Tara were quite happy.

526
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:04,287
Vicky was leading
a good and honest life.

527
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:09,331
He was a successful banker with
a leading banking corporation.

528
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:11,969
He was handling the top clients
from all over the world.

529
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:16,275
Someone introduced him to some
Indian politicians and businessman...

530
00:47:16,343 --> 00:47:18,311
in an Indian Embassy party.

531
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:21,406
Next day they invited Vicky for lunch.

532
00:47:22,682 --> 00:47:25,651
And offered him to launder
their black-money at 10% commission.

533
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:30,985
When Vicky refused,
they threatened him...

534
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:33,819
that they will kill his old parents
who live in lndia.

535
00:47:34,427 --> 00:47:36,361
And one day his father, who went
out for his morning walk...

536
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:38,024
suddenly disappeared.

537
00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:42,731
They said that his mother, me and
his daughter will meet the same fate.

538
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,032
That's when Vicky
apologized and agreed.

539
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:49,867
While back in lndia they started
making a police record of Vicky.

540
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:52,536
They turned Vicky into
a monster in those files.

541
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:55,638
His many faces...
the disappearing into thin air...

542
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,309
They turned him into a myth.

543
00:47:59,386 --> 00:48:00,614
One day he said...

544
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:01,914
That's enough, Maria.

545
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:06,357
l want to tell the
authorities everything.

546
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,862
How long will l keep plundering
my own country?

547
00:48:09,963 --> 00:48:11,430
l supported him.

548
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:13,892
He contacted the Finance Ministry.

549
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,799
But the very next day.

550
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,414
Nothing was more important
than her, officer.

551
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:30,876
Tara was the light of our eyes...

552
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,646
and we lost her.

553
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,313
But miraculously Vicky survived.

554
00:48:48,768 --> 00:48:53,364
l kept blaming myself,
but Vicky said...

555
00:48:53,406 --> 00:48:54,839
l got what l deserved, but now...

556
00:48:57,444 --> 00:49:01,744
l am going to return this money
to our people, not them.

557
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:07,680
We've to take revenge from
those who killed our daughter.

558
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:12,684
Please, Karan.
Help us get our revenge.

559
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:16,992
Why should l believe you?

560
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:19,323
You can check all the past records.

561
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:20,994
And after this...

562
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:23,862
l promise l will convince Vicky
to tell you everything.

563
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:26,330
Their names... evidences
of their crime.

564
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:27,532
Even the whereabouts of the money.

565
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:29,431
Please help us.

566
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,779
And what do you want in exchange?

567
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,372
Two things.

568
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:40,612
First, you will get
all those rascals behind bars.

569
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:42,980
And secondly, our safety...

570
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,017
Get us to Thailand border...

571
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:49,486
We've relatives in Bangkok. And we
don't have any criminal record there.

572
00:49:50,563 --> 00:49:52,758
We can start a new life out there.

573
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:57,365
- And l should believe you?
- Yes, Karan.

574
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:01,297
Because l am prepared
to do anything...

575
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,706
to save Vicky
and avenge Tara's death.

576
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:26,455
Even though l love my husband...

577
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:28,558
l can go a lot further than this.

578
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:08,007
Dubai's employment details, civil
court records, marriage registry...

579
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,298
birth and death records.

580
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:11,503
Everything she said is true, Commando.

581
00:51:12,345 --> 00:51:13,539
They had a four year old daughter.

582
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,709
We're changing route.

583
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,822
Now you'll be taking a boat, and...

584
00:51:26,326 --> 00:51:30,660
get off at a port which is 50 kilometers
from Malaysia-Thailand border.

585
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:34,727
My team will receive you there,
and take you to a private airfield.

586
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,368
From where you will fly back
to lndia in a chartered flight.

587
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,569
Are there duty-free shops
at private airfields?

588
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:46,669
l am sure he knows.

589
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,541
l am waiting for your affirmation.

590
00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:31,313
You'll be making a big mistake
if you listen to her.

591
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:03,716
Why should l take you to Bangkok?

592
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:09,623
You've no interest in me, right?

593
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:13,822
But what about the money looted
from millions of Indians.

594
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,993
Don't test my patience...
go straight for the kill.

595
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:17,998
Come on... get me excited.

596
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:31,549
The biggest mall
of Bangkok in Thailand

597
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:33,410
Terminal 21.

598
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:37,415
l need a key from the
mall's locker no. 307.

599
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,649
That key opens the locker in my bank.

600
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:44,592
Once l've the money,
l will do as you say.

601
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,023
Now this is getting boring.

602
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:50,626
Fine, call up Terminal
21's locker room.

603
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:53,338
Ask them whom does locker no.
307 belongs to.

604
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:57,074
And then call the
National Bank of Bangkok.

605
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,707
To confirm whether l have an account
with them or not.

606
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:35,563
Vicky.

607
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,958
ls everyone okay?

608
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:03,727
We need to talk.

609
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:05,457
We need to head to a different port...

610
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,828
and not the one which
Mr. Iyer mentioned.

611
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,894
Karan, l knew you were crazy...

612
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:11,560
but, l didn't know
you were completely insane.

613
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,003
There's no point in taking Vicky to
Tihar and getting him killed, Bakhtawar.

614
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:15,806
lt's much better if
we take him to Bangkok.

615
00:57:17,376 --> 00:57:19,310
Commando, let's just do what
we've been told, or else...

616
00:57:19,612 --> 00:57:21,671
Or else what? Keep following
orders blindly?

617
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:23,872
- Then who's going to do the duty, Zafar?
- You!

618
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:25,577
You will do the duty.

619
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,979
- lf l shoot you now, no one's going to ask me questions.
- Sir-sir-sir...

620
00:57:29,255 --> 00:57:31,382
- Don't test my patience...
- Bakhtawar sir stop...

621
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:33,823
lt's hard to say whether
he's telling the truth...

622
00:57:33,893 --> 00:57:36,623
or his ears are resonating
with 'Maria-Maria' tone.

623
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:38,789
We've been compromised!
We can be attacked again.

624
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:40,423
Don't you guys get that?

625
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:19,264
- How can all of us fit in this?
- Let's see...

626
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:20,600
- Move-move...
- Commando!

627
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:22,004
- Move...
- What are you doing?

628
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:26,611
This was just a warning shot,
l won't miss next time.

629
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:28,508
l am telling you last time
You're making a big mistake.

630
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:29,445
Sir...

631
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:30,808
Get him bandaged.

632
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:36,686
Commando!

633
00:58:43,529 --> 00:58:45,724
Mr. Iyer, listen carefully.

634
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,327
Karan has eloped with Vicky.

635
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:00,676
lf you want to ask anything,
you can.

636
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:03,505
l only ask questions when
l'm holding a gun.

637
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,251
That's the only time when you get
the right answers.

638
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,722
- This is the right thing, Bhavna.
- Bhavna.

639
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,657
Only time will tell whether your
this decision is right or not.

640
00:59:14,327 --> 00:59:15,521
One more thing.

641
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:17,525
ln the morning when
l saw you jogging...

642
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,360
l felt for you.

643
00:59:19,732 --> 00:59:21,825
But 30 minutes
back... that feeling died.

644
00:59:53,532 --> 00:59:55,432
Thank you for trusting us, Karan.

645
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,401
There's a University up-ahead.

646
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,732
Please stop there.

647
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:43,979
Karan, you are very special.

648
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:47,976
Come with me, life will be great.

649
01:00:48,587 --> 01:00:50,077
And what if l offer the same to you?

650
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:00,424
Vicky.

651
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,401
Come darling.

652
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:27,958
Miracles don't happen without
any divine intervention.

653
01:01:30,296 --> 01:01:31,661
That means he
was fooling all of us.

654
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:37,328
Leave...

655
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:38,994
Leave l say.

656
01:01:39,672 --> 01:01:40,502
Let me go.

657
01:01:43,342 --> 01:01:44,502
Vicky isn't going anywhere.

658
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,905
You can keep the body if you want.

659
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:22,008
You don't understand girls too well.

660
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:27,349
Actually l am Vicky Chaddha.

661
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:32,456
You must be curious...

662
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:34,365
about what that story was?

663
01:02:35,736 --> 01:02:36,862
The story was true.

664
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,862
Just, that family belonged
to some other Vicky Chaddha...

665
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:43,099
who l got killed
and took his place.

666
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:47,708
But l owe you one...

667
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,342
So stay alive... and stay happy.

668
01:02:50,784 --> 01:02:51,751
God bless.

669
01:02:52,085 --> 01:02:52,881
Goodbye.

670
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,823
Unfortunately, l owe her nothing.

671
01:03:21,782 --> 01:03:24,876
Zafar, Zafar

672
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:47,806
Karan has gone hostile.

673
01:03:49,943 --> 01:03:52,309
There's nothing we can do as long as
Vicky is in Thailand.

674
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,279
Iyer has been given orders...

675
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:57,942
to arrest Karan at any cost.

676
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:01,184
He would want to deal with us after
he's been arrested.

677
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:03,315
We'll also make a deal with him.

678
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,202
You wanted to prove, didn't you Zafar.

679
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,199
Well... you did.

680
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:23,435
You gave your life.

681
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,414
l kept telling you
not to trust that lady.

682
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,110
But you didn't listen.

683
01:04:40,193 --> 01:04:41,091
l don't get it.

684
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,126
After years of secrecy...

685
01:04:43,196 --> 01:04:47,292
why did you tell him everything
about who you are, and what...

686
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,834
l mean what did you
possibly see in him?

687
01:04:55,842 --> 01:04:57,833
You won't understand
my equation with Karan.

688
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,307
And anyway, the Vicky Chaddha
he'll be looking for...

689
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:03,916
won't exist from Monday.

690
01:05:06,753 --> 01:05:08,186
Tell Chang to admit
to the University murders...

691
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:11,486
and surrender with the weapons.

692
01:05:11,925 --> 01:05:13,483
Let's go to Terminal 21 fast.

693
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,019
Karan will be right
behind us in a fit of rage.

694
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:18,787
Sir, Zafar's body is
lying in the University.

695
01:05:19,065 --> 01:05:21,465
His body must be sent back to lndia,
with full honors.

696
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:23,233
Don't you talk to me about honor.

697
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:24,734
This is all your fault.

698
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,300
Just stay there and surrender.

699
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:29,333
Let's go.

700
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:32,169
You're talking about leaving
your partner like this.

701
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:35,042
We must stop Vicky Chaddha
from reaching Terminal 21.

702
01:05:38,885 --> 01:05:41,319
And yes... l didn't
do this for some medal...

703
01:05:42,222 --> 01:05:43,416
nor for a foreign trip.

704
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,315
You can help me if you want to.

705
01:05:49,396 --> 01:05:50,727
Mom...

706
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:56,201
What kind of a team
did you send out there?

707
01:05:56,436 --> 01:05:58,063
Bunch of useless and...

708
01:05:58,138 --> 01:06:00,231
Let's not talk about
who's useless and who's not!

709
01:06:00,307 --> 01:06:02,867
You had no clue that he isn't
Vicky Chaddha at all.

710
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:03,873
Look, madam...

711
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:21,488
Will you let Zafar's death go in vain?

712
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:29,233
Karan.

713
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,299
lf someone kills a police man...

714
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:39,811
then, the police doesn't
rest until he's dead.

715
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:59,459
Game on Vicky Chaddha

716
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,337
Mr. Iyer, l want a chopper.

717
01:07:15,048 --> 01:07:16,879
Karan wouldn't have gone too far.

718
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:19,477
l'm going to send Karan's dead body
along with Zafar's.

719
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:30,858
Mr. Iyer, l want every police officer
in and around Terminal 21...

720
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,228
to have Karan and
Bhavna's photographs.

721
01:07:44,077 --> 01:07:44,975
Welcome.

722
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,691
KP, we'll take the back-exit
instead of the main exit.

723
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:06,690
Ok lets go.

724
01:09:10,463 --> 01:09:13,296
- KP, did you call the boys?
- Yes, madam.

725
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:36,983
No guy ever follows any girl unless
he's interested in her.

726
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,122
lt's hard to decide...

727
01:09:39,192 --> 01:09:41,183
Whether you start flirting
when you sense danger...

728
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,126
or your flirting invites danger?

729
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,161
Yes, Iyer.

730
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:50,065
Karan is in the airplane
junkyard outside the mall.

731
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:51,963
- Okay.
- Stay there and guide me.

732
01:13:44,137 --> 01:13:45,035
What's this?

733
01:13:46,305 --> 01:13:49,206
l got a little tied up...
and you're already leaving.

734
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:55,907
What are you looking at?
Shoot the witch.

735
01:13:55,948 --> 01:13:57,347
She shot a police officer.

736
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:00,150
Key...

737
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:02,819
What will you do with the key?

738
01:14:03,055 --> 01:14:06,115
lt only opens the locker in
a bank which contains a bag...

739
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,717
which has a laptop.

740
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,154
And for which you'll need my retina
scan and fingerprints..

741
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:14,060
And even if you get that,
it's of no use to you.

742
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,425
Because the password is up here.

743
01:14:17,837 --> 01:14:20,305
l had my intentions...
but now you gave me an excuse as well.

744
01:14:20,773 --> 01:14:23,742
Now l'll also take the
lady along with the key.

745
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,342
Drop your weapons!

746
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:40,986
Oh s***

747
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,452
Come-come-come.

748
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:48,958
Get in the car, ma'am.

749
01:14:49,802 --> 01:14:51,326
We can decide on the percentage later.

750
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:56,198
Don't think, ma'am.
l'll tell you the reason myself.

751
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,809
Serving your country
isn't just boring...

752
01:14:58,878 --> 01:15:00,243
it also makes you pauper.

753
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,005
l don't want a criminal
record in Bangkok.

754
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:05,116
Otherwise l would've never missed
this opportunity to kill you.

755
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,346
Do not move!

756
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:15,891
How much money is on stake here, man?

757
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:17,425
l must decide too...

758
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:19,488
whether risking my life
is worth it or not.

759
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,926
People like Bakhtawar
are turning bad...

760
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:24,299
- and l am originally the greedy kind.
- Just shut up!

761
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:29,298
Right... you didn't utter a word
to the one you should.

762
01:15:33,913 --> 01:15:34,845
Arrest them!

763
01:15:36,716 --> 01:15:38,047
Mr. Iyer, why me?

764
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:42,687
Have you ever heard anyone getting
kidnapped and arrested for the same case?

765
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,990
Silence is often a sign of danger,
Bakhtawar.

766
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,031
What danger, madam?

767
01:15:58,938 --> 01:16:00,235
l played all the right moves...

768
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,830
so that l get to come on this trip.

769
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:06,175
l went out so that Karan could talk
to you on the boat.

770
01:16:06,712 --> 01:16:08,145
Otherwise you two couldn't
have made your plan.

771
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:11,975
He's a policeman, madam.
Trusting him...

772
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:15,418
You won't find anyone more loyal
than a policeman ever.

773
01:16:16,389 --> 01:16:17,947
But once he turns corrupt...

774
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:20,483
he'll stay that way
for the rest of his life.

775
01:16:21,861 --> 01:16:24,295
- What's your price?
- 10...

776
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,065
Nothing less than 10%, ma'am.

777
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,184
Get Vicky arrested, Iyer.

778
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:56,054
And as soon as you arrest her...

779
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:58,961
- shoot Karan and Bakhtawar.
- Sorry, ma'am.

780
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,697
Vicky doesn't have any criminal
record in Thailand.

781
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:03,291
We cannot arrest her in this country.

782
01:17:03,336 --> 01:17:04,098
What?

783
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,797
She murdered two people
at the University.

784
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,065
One of them was her so-called husband.

785
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:12,077
One of her men admitted
to the murders...

786
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:13,874
and surrendered
with the murder weapon.

787
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:15,004
We've no case.

788
01:17:16,082 --> 01:17:18,778
Talk to the Interpol and get
a Red-Corner Notice issued.

789
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:20,876
We've to be very careful.

790
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,720
Indian government
will approach Interpol.

791
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,025
So from now on...
use only local criminals for any job.

792
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,924
What an idea?

793
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:31,759
Poor Jafar is dead...
and l'm in lockup.

794
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,727
How did her goons get there?

795
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:39,133
- How did they know?
- Are you crazy?

796
01:17:39,438 --> 01:17:40,370
Even after losing
you are not accepting your defeat...

797
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:42,402
you're still going
around in circles!

798
01:17:43,209 --> 01:17:44,369
Karan, tell me...

799
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:46,744
l know l am little stupid.

800
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:50,008
But why didn't you and Jafar
check Vicky's story?

801
01:17:50,716 --> 01:17:51,774
Her story was correct.

802
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:54,678
There was a man by that name
and a family as well.

803
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:00,416
Mr. Iyer,
why did you lock me up with him?

804
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,955
l was taken at gun-point.

805
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,093
What's my fault?

806
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:06,923
The inquiry commission back in
lndia will decide...

807
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:08,432
whether it was your fault or not.

808
01:18:09,335 --> 01:18:11,803
l see... and what about me?

809
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,262
Delhi has already decided about you.

810
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:16,068
Delhi is going to
change its decision.

811
01:18:16,142 --> 01:18:19,043
- Give me your phone and go out.
- Why, What for?

812
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:21,478
Your Leela madam must be
in a bad temper right now.

813
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:23,781
But she will calm
down after talking to me.

814
01:18:30,356 --> 01:18:32,051
Iyer, please give me some good news.

815
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,024
l can, ma'am... but l am not Iyer.

816
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:38,794
Karan!

817
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,232
Wow, you recognized
me from my attitude.

818
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:44,396
How did you get your
hands on Iyer's phone?

819
01:18:44,837 --> 01:18:45,895
Did you kill him too?

820
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,302
Bakhtawar thinks small.

821
01:18:47,339 --> 01:18:49,239
He must have demanded
10 percent from Vicky.

822
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,906
l will take 20 from you...
but l'll get the job done.

823
01:18:54,714 --> 01:18:55,738
Done.

824
01:18:56,449 --> 01:18:58,110
But l can't take chances.

825
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,949
l'm going to offer 15 percent
to Bakhtawar as well.

826
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:05,314
And we'll see... who
collects the commission.

827
01:19:06,692 --> 01:19:08,057
Him... or you.

828
01:19:09,095 --> 01:19:11,791
For now... please tell Mr. Iyer
to give me a free-hand.

829
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:12,929
Goodbye.

830
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:23,400
Today is Saturday,
bank will reopen on Monday.

831
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,170
So we have only 48 hours to find her.

832
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:29,876
How will we find her and where?

833
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,146
Vicky sent a message to her men
from the safe-house.

834
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:34,641
Through someone.

835
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:39,123
Mr. Iyer, how soon can we get all
the CCTV footages of the safe-house?

836
01:19:39,391 --> 01:19:42,087
ln order to find me, Karan will
start looking from the same place...

837
01:19:42,161 --> 01:19:43,822
where we met for the first time.

838
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:47,961
lf he figures out
my plan from there...

839
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:49,862
then he'll be
one step closer to me.

840
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:53,198
And so we must stay
one step ahead of him.

841
01:19:57,943 --> 01:19:59,911
Thank you so much
for taking care of us.

842
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:01,273
The food was amazing.

843
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,978
Anyway... l don't have much.

844
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:06,850
This is all l can give you.

845
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:11,218
What a big miser
this Vicky Chaddha is.

846
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:13,988
She has millions of dollars
in her Swiss bank account...

847
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:17,325
and all she gave her poor
cookie is that bible.

848
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:20,763
- Cookie? Was that her name?
- No-no...

849
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:22,833
Her name's Erica.

850
01:20:22,968 --> 01:20:26,404
But since she's a female cook,
so cookie.

851
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:35,705
There was nothing in it.

852
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:37,940
lt was just a normal Gideon's Bible.

853
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:40,275
Hold on...

854
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,769
Wait a second, Karan.

855
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,942
What did you possibly find?

856
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:13,750
All the information was in that Bible.

857
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,753
And Erica delivered Vicky's
all messages to her men.

858
01:21:19,225 --> 01:21:21,989
We can get Erica's address from
the Embassy's records.

859
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:25,826
The entire system
was in Vicky's control.

860
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:28,162
Otherwise Erica who
lived in Bangkok...

861
01:21:28,234 --> 01:21:30,168
would've never got a job in
the safe-house in Malaysia.

862
01:21:30,236 --> 01:21:34,935
- But what was so important in that Bible?
- That's what we need to find out.

863
01:21:35,908 --> 01:21:36,875
Please hurry up.

864
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:10,775
Bakhtawar.

865
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:21,043
- Vicky is cleverer than us.
- But Bhavna Reddy isn't any less.

866
01:22:22,254 --> 01:22:24,415
l'll definitely find some proof here.

867
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,261
The Bible isn't here.

868
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,302
She delivered it somewhere.

869
01:22:42,341 --> 01:22:44,866
And also sent a record
of the delivery.

870
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,777
Her phone was lying under the sofa.

871
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,341
Forward this clip to your mobile...

872
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,906
and delete it from the phone.

873
01:22:52,418 --> 01:22:54,852
And leave the phone
here for the police.

874
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,857
How can you make the mistake
of leaving the phone behind, KP?

875
01:23:00,926 --> 01:23:02,223
Why are you getting tensed?

876
01:23:02,361 --> 01:23:05,262
Even if the police find the phone,
it won't prove anything.

877
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:06,389
l mean... check this.

878
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,828
His face is completely
hidden in this clip.

879
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,166
l hate mistakes, KP.

880
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,100
So don't try and defend it.

881
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:21,937
Erica's dead.

882
01:23:22,014 --> 01:23:23,481
This man's face isn't visible.

883
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,273
Nor can we see where these two met.

884
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:27,445
How will we find out who
she gave the Bible to...

885
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,153
and what was in it?

886
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,755
Good news!

887
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:36,425
The police recovered the phone,
but there wasn't any clip in it.

888
01:23:37,363 --> 01:23:39,695
Erica had already deleted the clip.

889
01:23:40,366 --> 01:23:41,355
lt's a dead end.

890
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:50,036
lt won't look clearer if he
keeps playing it over-and-over again.

891
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,310
Mr. Iyer,
we need a hi-tech forensic lab.

892
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:17,734
5 bells... so it's 5pm.

893
01:24:18,203 --> 01:24:20,103
The place where they met is a church.

894
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,799
There are 407 churches
all over Bangkok.

895
01:24:23,008 --> 01:24:27,308
And all the churches ring
their bells five times at 5 o'clock.

896
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,869
So?

897
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:34,011
increase the mid-frequency from
1 .5 to 3.5 kHz, please.

898
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:44,127
lt's the horn of some small ship
at a distance.

899
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:46,922
lt's somewhere close to the river.

900
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:49,162
Don't try to impress us.

901
01:24:49,234 --> 01:24:51,202
The entire city is
on the banks of a river.

902
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,794
What nonsense.

903
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:57,205
- Now increase the higher-frequency from 6.0 to 10.5 kHz.
- Sure.

904
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,451
Sound of birds chirping.

905
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,118
So the church is on
the banks of a river...

906
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,920
and there's a
bird-sanctuary nearby.

907
01:25:16,261 --> 01:25:18,252
- Can l have the visual on the big screen?
- Yeah, sure.

908
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:21,196
Stop!

909
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,295
Can you zoom into his hand?

910
01:25:31,143 --> 01:25:32,940
- Can you clean this reflection?
- Okay.

911
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,284
This is the only church on
the banks of a river...

912
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,852
which has a bird-sanctuary nearby
and a McDonalds opposite to it.

913
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,999
Next time if you
do anything like this...

914
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:04,338
l am telling you l'll fall madly in love
with you, and l'll kiss you on the lips...

915
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,279
Take it as a warning or compliment...

916
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,842
And secondly...

917
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:16,244
Hey... bad manners, waste fellow...

918
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,391
They chose a really good place.

919
01:26:29,668 --> 01:26:31,761
No one will raise an eyebrow...

920
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:32,929
if you handover a Bible
to someone outside the church.

921
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:34,233
And smart too...

922
01:26:38,844 --> 01:26:42,075
The question is... what message
did Vicky send through the bible.

923
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:46,078
But the bigger question is...
who is this guy?

924
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:48,048
Jimmy. He's an Indian.

925
01:26:48,253 --> 01:26:50,187
He came here for
some software contract.

926
01:26:50,255 --> 01:26:52,883
He's a popular hacker
and a software developer as well.

927
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,953
He works on contracts.

928
01:26:55,427 --> 01:27:00,694
He masks his LP and uses
free wifi of the local cafes...

929
01:27:00,732 --> 01:27:02,097
so that he doesn't get caught.

930
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:03,929
We must catch him.

931
01:27:04,203 --> 01:27:06,330
He's our last hope to catch Vicky.

932
01:27:06,772 --> 01:27:09,263
l can't leave Jimmy alone
even for a second.

933
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:11,134
Tail him.

934
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:13,770
They won't leave Jimmy alone
even for a second.

935
01:27:14,346 --> 01:27:16,041
But madam, he's a criminal.

936
01:27:16,248 --> 01:27:18,273
Tailing him could be risky.

937
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,274
Whatever the risks maybe KP...

938
01:27:21,386 --> 01:27:22,876
but we must keep an eye on him.

939
01:27:23,088 --> 01:27:24,350
We want Jimmy alone...

940
01:27:25,757 --> 01:27:28,248
Only if we tail Jimmy,
we'll know what he's up to.

941
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:32,353
Mr. Iyer, we will have
to create a diversion.

942
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:35,191
Why to waste so much time?

943
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,193
We'll pickup Jimmy
and interrogate him...

944
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,862
and he'll spill the beans.

945
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,767
Mr. Iyer... Are you ready?

946
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,109
Karan and Bhavna are being deported.

947
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,008
Today.

948
01:27:47,246 --> 01:27:50,010
No-no... this is definitely a trap.

949
01:27:50,082 --> 01:27:51,071
Let's not trust them.

950
01:27:53,318 --> 01:27:55,980
Bakhtawar is right,
this is definitely a trap.

951
01:27:56,755 --> 01:27:58,154
You two must personally check it out.

952
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,009
They are gone...

953
01:28:30,155 --> 01:28:31,679
We saw it ourselves.

954
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:34,148
But we shouldn't take a chance.

955
01:28:35,694 --> 01:28:37,992
KP is right. Leave Jimmy alone.

956
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:41,663
Now she won't take
the risk of tailing Jimmy.

957
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,733
Jimmy's up to something...

958
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:55,371
which is very important
for laundering black-money.

959
01:28:59,284 --> 01:29:00,808
We have only one day.

960
01:29:20,305 --> 01:29:21,237
Shall we?

961
01:29:45,997 --> 01:29:48,795
There's some connection between
the Bible and these places.

962
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:49,991
What is he doing?

963
01:29:51,403 --> 01:29:55,169
Neither is he doing anything...
nor are we?

964
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:59,876
- What do you want to do?
- Forget it... let it be.

965
01:30:00,846 --> 01:30:04,282
Move-move... he's leaving... you know what
you are supposed to do, right?

966
01:30:25,637 --> 01:30:29,334
Yeah tell me - Found anything?
- There's nothing here.

967
01:30:30,142 --> 01:30:31,632
Neither out here.

968
01:30:32,411 --> 01:30:34,641
l couldn't understand a single
item on the menu card...

969
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,738
so l pointed out to something.

970
01:30:36,915 --> 01:30:38,906
Now l am sipping on something
that tastes like poison.

971
01:30:38,984 --> 01:30:40,246
ls it alcohol?

972
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:43,310
No... l know the taste of alcohol
very well

973
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:56,230
He seems quite interested
in dead people.

974
01:30:56,735 --> 01:30:57,861
Where is the bible?

975
01:31:06,812 --> 01:31:07,904
Ouch...

976
01:31:08,847 --> 01:31:10,815
- You knocked over my drink.
- l am sorry..!

977
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,141
Can l buy you another one?

978
01:31:13,785 --> 01:31:14,877
Okay.

979
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:19,820
- How about dinner afterwards, handsome?
- You're crazy.

980
01:31:40,312 --> 01:31:41,176
Taxi.

981
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,991
How does she want
to use the dead people?

982
01:33:54,846 --> 01:33:56,245
So what if l didn't answer your phone.

983
01:33:56,448 --> 01:33:58,313
l do know what 20 missed calls mean.

984
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:02,877
Still you understand only this...
and nothing else.

985
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:06,316
Stop this charade,
he's waking up.

986
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:14,023
Who... who are you?

987
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,864
l am the one who can send you
to the hospital... or heaven.

988
01:34:18,003 --> 01:34:18,992
You decide.

989
01:34:20,839 --> 01:34:22,773
So you're making a database
of all those people...

990
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:26,242
whose families forgot to close
their bank accounts after their demise.

991
01:34:26,678 --> 01:34:29,408
You're hacking their accounts and
filling in your user name and password.

992
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:31,842
Apart from this you're developing
another software...

993
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,215
which can transfer money from one
account to these 300,000 accounts...

994
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:36,811
with the single click of a button.

995
01:34:37,055 --> 01:34:39,353
You're going to handover
this software and database to Vicky.

996
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:43,252
She will make small transfers
of 15-20 dollars in those accounts.

997
01:34:43,328 --> 01:34:45,125
And gradually all the money...

998
01:34:45,196 --> 01:34:47,061
will get transferred
to different safe-account.

999
01:34:47,732 --> 01:34:49,393
No government or
agency of the world...

1000
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,867
can track such small transactions.

1001
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:53,398
So all the money will disappear.

1002
01:34:53,471 --> 01:34:56,099
After transferring the money you
will close all the accounts.

1003
01:34:56,408 --> 01:35:00,071
- So chapter over.
- No... you're wrong.

1004
01:35:02,881 --> 01:35:03,939
l am right.

1005
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:07,774
Please give me this hard-drive.

1006
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:11,111
lf l don't give it to Vicky,
she will kill me.

1007
01:35:16,928 --> 01:35:18,896
l also want you to give
her this hard-drive.

1008
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,459
Stupid fool, have you lost your mind?

1009
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:23,394
You want to give her
this disk on your own.

1010
01:35:23,735 --> 01:35:25,362
You do realize that
if she doesn't get the disk...

1011
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:27,166
she can't transfer the money.

1012
01:35:27,338 --> 01:35:30,432
But the money still stays with her,
until we don't find her.

1013
01:35:30,675 --> 01:35:31,869
You're taking a big risk.

1014
01:35:32,177 --> 01:35:34,407
Do you know the
consequences of failing?

1015
01:35:36,715 --> 01:35:37,682
Call her.

1016
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:44,081
She's calling you instead.

1017
01:35:44,355 --> 01:35:47,153
Speak to her... but carefully.

1018
01:35:50,028 --> 01:35:50,790
Hello.

1019
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:15,820
- All okay?
- Yeah.

1020
01:36:18,256 --> 01:36:19,450
Hi, Vicky Chaddha.

1021
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:26,854
Was leaving the country a charade...

1022
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,328
or you couldn't stay away from me?

1023
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:30,128
Don't refuse to come along today.

1024
01:36:30,668 --> 01:36:34,195
- Do you love me or... you want to kill me?
- What do you think?

1025
01:36:37,242 --> 01:36:39,073
My mind says that you will kill me.

1026
01:36:40,145 --> 01:36:41,840
But the heart says otherwise.

1027
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,879
So will your heart decide...
or your mind?

1028
01:37:00,765 --> 01:37:01,459
Let's move.

1029
01:37:44,876 --> 01:37:48,004
Her bullet may have missed...
but definitely left a wound.

1030
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:56,943
So you want money and not love, huh!

1031
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:00,455
Such a long face
over losing 20 percent.

1032
01:38:00,725 --> 01:38:03,193
l want the all of it back...
and not just 20 percent.

1033
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:07,196
Why and for what? A corrupt officer
like you will never understand.

1034
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:09,925
Yes, l am corrupt.

1035
01:38:10,869 --> 01:38:12,336
But l only take loose change.

1036
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:15,762
l've no intentions of robbing
the entire nation, nor the stature.

1037
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:22,941
Back in our village, one has to walk
for 5 kilometers to get drinking water.

1038
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:26,983
One has to sleight-hands even for
your share of water from the tanker.

1039
01:38:27,752 --> 01:38:29,845
Every person who
hails from that place...

1040
01:38:29,921 --> 01:38:31,980
only dreams about
a simple ordinary life.

1041
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,316
But, how can anyone learn about
honesty in a place

1042
01:38:36,427 --> 01:38:39,021
where one has to
sleight-hands for water.

1043
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:49,304
l understand.

1044
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:52,442
And l knew from day one...

1045
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,268
that you're not doing
this for 20 percent.

1046
01:38:54,445 --> 01:38:57,414
Whatever you do tomorrow,
l am with you.

1047
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:06,917
Her name is Haniya.

1048
01:39:07,425 --> 01:39:10,189
She's hiding in Libya's Tripoli city.

1049
01:39:11,062 --> 01:39:14,828
The Tripoli police has been searching
for her for the past few weeks.

1050
01:39:16,301 --> 01:39:19,065
She's been accused of a small theft
at her master's place.

1051
01:39:19,237 --> 01:39:21,728
At the most, she'll be sentenced
to four months imprisonment.

1052
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:24,904
But she won't get caught.

1053
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:27,773
She will run and get killed.

1054
01:39:28,947 --> 01:39:30,312
We will kill her.

1055
01:39:31,683 --> 01:39:33,082
And then l will take her place...

1056
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:36,120
and the Tripoli police
will arrest me as Haniya.

1057
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:40,282
Indian government will never look
for Vicky Chaddha...

1058
01:39:40,358 --> 01:39:43,122
in the jails of Tripoli as Haniya.

1059
01:39:43,695 --> 01:39:45,287
And four months later,
l'll be free...

1060
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:48,855
and have a ball with all the money,
as Haniya.

1061
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,225
Wow...

1062
01:39:52,036 --> 01:39:54,163
This face is going
to change again, KP.

1063
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:58,241
Monday afternoon 1 o'clock.

1064
01:40:08,686 --> 01:40:09,710
Yes, ma'am.

1065
01:40:10,121 --> 01:40:12,817
What if Karan fails to complete
the task tomorrow?

1066
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,289
Then l will do it for you.

1067
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,458
Tomorrow morning there's going
to be a big twist in the story...

1068
01:40:16,694 --> 01:40:18,025
that everyone will be shocked.

1069
01:40:20,298 --> 01:40:21,128
How?

1070
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,861
All l would like to say is that
l've done my preparations.

1071
01:40:24,836 --> 01:40:26,030
You must stay prepared as well.

1072
01:40:42,253 --> 01:40:44,118
You know l won't come
to the bank tomorrow.

1073
01:40:45,923 --> 01:40:48,050
And you know l will definitely come
to the bank tomorrow.

1074
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:52,193
Neither the government is with you nor
the police.

1075
01:40:56,834 --> 01:41:02,170
First Vicky, then Zafar,
then Erica... and now Jimmy.

1076
01:41:02,206 --> 01:41:03,798
How many times are
you going to lose again?

1077
01:41:06,277 --> 01:41:08,268
When we're trained to be a Commando...

1078
01:41:08,913 --> 01:41:10,380
there's one thing
which they teach us.

1079
01:41:11,249 --> 01:41:14,309
Never give up trying...
until you're alive.

1080
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:17,955
All the best.

1081
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:22,223
All the best to you too... Commando!

1082
01:41:43,047 --> 01:41:44,742
lf she is so confident...

1083
01:41:44,816 --> 01:41:47,046
l'm sure she has some
trick up her sleeve.

1084
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,279
Who's going to emerge out
carrying Vicky's bag?

1085
01:41:57,995 --> 01:42:00,987
- Hello Mr. Iyer.
- Karan, you were right.

1086
01:42:01,065 --> 01:42:02,760
That bag is out of the locker...

1087
01:42:02,834 --> 01:42:04,825
but there's a big
surprise waiting for you.

1088
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,037
- Black suit and silver bag!
- Right

1089
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,014
What's the surprise?

1090
01:43:11,302 --> 01:43:13,327
lf only she was here,
l would've touched her feet.

1091
01:43:13,804 --> 01:43:15,999
What a brilliant lady.

1092
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:12,727
Go-go... get side.

1093
01:44:14,232 --> 01:44:14,994
What?

1094
01:44:15,132 --> 01:44:16,121
Keep your phone on.

1095
01:52:49,079 --> 01:52:51,013
- Aren't you going to stop this?
- Just wait.

1096
01:53:05,462 --> 01:53:07,430
Now it's the right time to celebrate.

1097
01:53:08,098 --> 01:53:10,066
The money didn't go to the accounts
of 300,000 dead people...

1098
01:53:10,134 --> 01:53:11,192
in fact,
it went to the right place.

1099
01:53:11,502 --> 01:53:14,335
You were winning the game because
l was letting you.

1100
01:53:14,838 --> 01:53:16,237
But only till the semi-final.

1101
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,100
l won the final.

1102
01:53:19,309 --> 01:53:20,742
lf you hadn't made it to Bangkok...

1103
01:53:20,811 --> 01:53:22,108
we could've never made it this far.

1104
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:24,140
We only staged the attack on the boat.

1105
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:29,079
And yes... fighting
amongst ourselves...

1106
01:53:29,153 --> 01:53:30,677
was a part of that drama.

1107
01:53:31,388 --> 01:53:33,322
Bakhtawar, stop acting now.

1108
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:34,917
Now arrest her.

1109
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,205
l highly respected you, Vicky.

1110
01:53:57,481 --> 01:53:59,346
But he turned out
to be smarter than you.

1111
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:02,283
Your game was up long time ago.

1112
01:54:02,786 --> 01:54:04,185
Karan, l am under an oath...

1113
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,085
to bring the black-money
back in our country.

1114
01:54:06,456 --> 01:54:07,980
But there's a problem.

1115
01:54:08,058 --> 01:54:11,459
- Your biggest problem is your...
- Are you talking about me?

1116
01:54:20,337 --> 01:54:24,000
Karan, l won't obstruct
you in any way...

1117
01:54:24,341 --> 01:54:26,809
but l cannot openly
support you either.

1118
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:30,676
Because Vicky Chaddha's supporters
will try something else.

1119
01:54:31,248 --> 01:54:33,273
So we must all make a plan together.

1120
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:40,312
There are few things that can't be
done in politics, Karan.

1121
01:54:40,991 --> 01:54:42,356
Her son is involved too.

1122
01:54:42,826 --> 01:54:44,157
l am not sad that he fell...

1123
01:54:44,428 --> 01:54:46,828
but if his name is exposed,
then the government can crumble.

1124
01:54:48,398 --> 01:54:51,265
This hard-disk contains
the bank details...

1125
01:54:51,335 --> 01:54:53,132
of all the farmers of lndia.

1126
01:54:54,438 --> 01:54:56,463
No need to bring the money back.

1127
01:54:56,907 --> 01:54:59,876
lt should directly
go in their accounts.

1128
01:54:59,943 --> 01:55:03,140
Because they are the ones
who need it the most right now.

1129
01:55:10,721 --> 01:55:11,915
The money has been transferred...

1130
01:55:11,989 --> 01:55:13,786
in the accounts of 30 million
Indian farmers...

1131
01:55:13,957 --> 01:55:16,016
who die because of people like you.

1132
01:55:55,933 --> 01:55:57,195
ln fact, the Special
Cell and the Home Minister...

1133
01:55:57,267 --> 01:55:58,928
have been planning
this for two years.

1134
01:55:59,436 --> 01:56:01,199
ln order to convince
Runwal and company...

1135
01:56:01,271 --> 01:56:04,934
that the Home Minister is on their
side, we had to put up this charade.

1136
01:56:05,008 --> 01:56:07,101
Karan's attraction
towards you was planned.

1137
01:56:07,344 --> 01:56:09,335
Bakhtawar changing
sides was also planned.

1138
01:56:09,947 --> 01:56:12,438
We were forced to kill Erica.
Collateral damage.

1139
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,043
Home Minister's offer was planned.

1140
01:56:14,117 --> 01:56:16,381
University,
Terminal 21 mall, in fact...

1141
01:56:16,453 --> 01:56:18,444
your escape during the Jimmy
stint was planned as well.

1142
01:56:19,022 --> 01:56:20,284
lf the plan had flopped...

1143
01:56:21,024 --> 01:56:22,457
then Bakhtawar would've taken
the money from you.

1144
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,359
Your victory was impossible.

1145
01:56:25,996 --> 01:56:28,157
Vicky, are you ready?

1146
01:56:29,666 --> 01:56:31,031
You cannot arrest me.

1147
01:56:37,674 --> 01:56:39,232
Who said we're going to arrest you?

1148
01:56:41,211 --> 01:56:43,008
We're new generation officers.

1149
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,672
We do justice in our own style.

1150
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:49,283
And anyway,
the police always settles their score.

1151
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,082
l will settle Jafar's account.

1152
01:57:25,389 --> 01:57:26,185
Yes, sir.

1153
01:57:26,423 --> 01:57:29,324
Congratulations, Karan.
Mission accomplished.

1154
01:57:29,393 --> 01:57:30,291
Thank you, sir.

1155
01:57:30,727 --> 01:57:32,126
Would you prefer taking a break...

1156
01:57:32,195 --> 01:57:33,890
or are you ready
for the next mission?

1157
01:57:34,031 --> 01:57:35,794
You know l am always ready.

1158
01:57:36,767 --> 01:57:38,132
And this time l've
even thought of a team.

1159
01:57:39,369 --> 01:57:41,200
- Okay... see you then.
- See you, sir.

1160
01:57:42,906 --> 01:57:44,066
Wait-wait...

1161
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:47,239
l will go on any
mission after two days.

1162
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:48,937
l'll do some sight-seeing now.

1163
01:57:49,212 --> 01:57:52,943
Because once you start...
l won't get a chance.

1164
01:57:53,283 --> 01:57:54,272
One more thing...

1165
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:56,078
l warned you about what l'll do...

1166
01:57:56,253 --> 01:57:59,222
if you do something amazing again.

1167
01:58:00,023 --> 01:58:02,821
So making a fool out of Vicky
was your last mistake.

1168
01:58:03,794 --> 01:58:06,388
Now your lips must
pay for your brains.

1169
01:58:42,332 --> 01:58:44,300
"Sweetheart...
what ruckus have you created?"

1170
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,301
"horns start blaring in my heart."

1171
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:48,337
"The sun's set... dusk is upon us."

1172
01:58:48,405 --> 01:58:50,168
"As the night falls...
l am coming after you."

1173
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,935
"You tried to rope in a commando."

1174
01:58:52,008 --> 01:58:53,999
"Neither money nor
your charms will work."

1175
01:58:54,845 --> 01:58:56,369
"Sweetheart, your guy's not scared..."

1176
01:58:56,446 --> 01:58:59,347
"just try saying it once politely."

1177
01:59:17,968 --> 01:59:21,927
"There's no point...
in useless chatter."

1178
01:59:22,005 --> 01:59:24,030
"Let's talk about love instead..."

1179
01:59:24,107 --> 01:59:26,166
"and promises of eternity."

1180
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,205
"My heart's dormant..."

1181
01:59:32,282 --> 01:59:34,216
"make it beat
with your touch again."

1182
01:59:34,284 --> 01:59:38,050
"Give me some peace...
and some torment as well."

1183
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,318
"My arms are lonely."

1184
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:42,051
"You know l need you."

1185
01:59:42,125 --> 01:59:44,218
"These eyes try to convey..."

1186
01:59:44,294 --> 01:59:46,125
"You know l want you."

1187
01:59:46,196 --> 01:59:48,130
"Let's forget the world

1188
01:59:48,198 --> 01:59:49,722
come and sing this song."

1189
01:59:49,799 --> 01:59:50,766
"Hare..."

1190
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:55,837
"Hare Ram - Hare Ram."

1191
01:59:55,906 --> 01:59:57,931
"Hare Krishna - Hare Ram."

1192
01:59:58,008 --> 01:59:59,908
"Hare Ram - Hare Ram."

1193
01:59:59,976 --> 02:00:01,967
"Hare Krishna - Hare Ram."

1194
02:00:02,045 --> 02:00:03,979
"Hare Ram - Hare Ram."

1195
02:00:04,047 --> 02:00:06,038
"Hare Krishna - Hare Ram."

1196
02:00:06,116 --> 02:00:08,084
"Hare Ram - Hare Ram."

1197
02:00:08,151 --> 02:00:10,745
"Hare Krishna - Hare Ram."

1198
02:00:35,245 --> 02:00:37,236
"You're my one and only..."

1199
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:39,248
"don't make me wait anymore."

1200
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:41,147
"Let me sway your body around..."

1201
02:00:41,218 --> 02:00:43,118
"Boy l want you come a little close."

1202
02:00:43,653 --> 02:00:45,712
"This night won't come again..."

1203
02:00:45,789 --> 02:00:47,416
"let this meeting
last till the morning."

1204
02:00:47,691 --> 02:00:49,181
"Let the heart's convey..."

1205
02:00:49,259 --> 02:00:51,284
"You are my rainbow in the rose"

1206
02:00:51,361 --> 02:00:53,795
"My arms are lonely."

1207
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:55,297
"You know l need you."

1208
02:00:55,365 --> 02:00:57,663
"These eyes try to convey..."

1209
02:00:57,734 --> 02:00:59,395
