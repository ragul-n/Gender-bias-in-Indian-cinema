1
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,546
Cochin Airport, Kerala

2
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,409
We saw your parliamentary
speech on TV

3
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:21,481
It's no use raising our voice there.
They haven't changed a bit.

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,835
I'll talk for you once again.
I'll leave now

5
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,341
- What's happening in town?
- What's there to say?

6
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,974
Everyone in town is drunk

7
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,043
First we should shut down the bars.
Only then our nation will improve

8
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,645
Stop the vehicle. Looks
like an accident.

9
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,011
Go fast.

10
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,309
- Get up. What happened?
- He is bleeding.

11
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,811
Who are you guys?

12
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,278
Who the hell are you guys?

13
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,911
Why are you all trying to kill me?

14
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,576
Contract killers! They kill for
no reason but for money.

15
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,671
From business murders to political
assassinations in the whole of south india...

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,207
...is done by the curator
of the Perumal temple

17
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,372
of Pollachi Sethumadai
village, Annathandavam

18
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,379
We're done with the MP

19
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,444
Minister sir

20
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,106
Just like you asked,
we're done with the Kerala MP

21
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,445
- Very good Thandava.

22
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,576
He was raising a lot of
issues in the parliament

23
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,481
I'll pay you an extra 25 lakhs
from what I offered. - Alright

24
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,373
Having fled to Bihar at a small age..

25
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,946
...Thandavam returned to his
native, pollachi, 13 years back

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,099
He started a finance company for namesake

27
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,080
and leads the life of a VIP

28
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:19,642
All his trusted men are divided
as first and second layers

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,379
He does not keep contacts with the third
layer who actually carry out his works

30
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,706
This is his prudent approach

31
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,712
In garments and dyeing industries
around Coimbatore, Tiruppur

32
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,479
the poverty stricken biharis working in
them are used as his sidekicks

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,673
...to earn crores

34
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,610
Go search

35
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,577
- Who is Vasu here?
- Don't know brother!

36
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,911
- Who is Vasu?
- Which Vasu?

37
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,737
- The one who finances
- Don't know

38
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,478
Lying?

39
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,677
Why are you searching for him?

40
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,336
He is financing to
compete with Thavasi brother.

41
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,547
We have come to take him.

42
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,039
Who is Vasu here?

43
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,275
He's asking about Vasu to Vasu himself!

44
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,611
Open your mouth

45
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,543
Tell me

46
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,780
- Take your hands off me.
- Tell me

47
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,874
I'm Vasu. Tell him that
I'll come meet him.

48
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,778
Go get him.

49
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,539
It's a place of business,
you better leave

50
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,545
Chop him!

51
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:24,076
Does it ache for your brother if
I finance at the Avinasi market?

52
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:30,140
People from Rajasthan are
working as pawn brokers here

53
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,469
Why is it bitter for you
if a native guy finances?

54
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,503
Not just Avinasi market,

55
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,280
Tell your brother that I will
finance all markets in Coimbatore,

56
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,576
Palladam, Thondamathur,
Mettupalayam, from Annur to Conoor.

57
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,011
Divya..

58
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,866
Why are you waking her so early?

59
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,744
She said she is going to
Fun mall with her friends

60
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,180
Then switch on your regular alarm

61
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,340
Keep looking at shares,
you'll not feel bored

62
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,904
Looking at the computer,
you'll not see your daughter

63
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,709
Tell me dad, if the share market
is up or down or gain or loss

64
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,009
Tata-Power shares are booming
at the Mumbai market

65
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:43,206
The Kovai textile share that I
bought here has increased by 30%

66
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:44,275
Great Dad!

67
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,208
I don't understand what this
share market is!

68
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,310
Doesn't let me sleep at night!

69
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:49,845
Mom!!

70
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,371
- He was scratching me in his sleep
thinking that I am the computer - Ok ok

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,470
Interest.. Interest.. Interest...

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,844
If one don't pay interest,
I'll take granny as hostage

73
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,099
Who's this granny?

74
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,377
That Vandichami, locked himself up in
his room when I went to collect interest

75
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:25,378
I took hostage of his granny whom
he is very fond of! How is it?

76
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,413
We are doing business by good means.

77
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,343
Go, leave her!

78
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,778
If you are sentimental, we
can't develop our business

79
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,270
Just see how he rushes here
in 2 minutes with cash

80
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:41,604
He's calling. I'll switch on the loud
speaker. Just listen to how he screams!

81
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,974
Where have you reached
carrying the cash?

82
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,340
I've vacated my house and
am on my way to Tiruppur.

83
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,745
Wow great!

84
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,411
What are you saying?

85
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,178
Thank God, you took that old lady! She will
ask mutton soup for parota in the morning..

86
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:57,510
She'll ask beer instead of water
after having biriyani for lunch

87
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,178
If anything happens to my granny, a battalion
of police will be at your doorstep

88
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,378
Police?

89
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,946
You guys are embarrassing me.

90
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,280
Oh China granny born to a chappathi...

91
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,344
The cops are coming to save you?

92
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,771
They've come bro!

93
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,877
Who is Kuttipuli who took
hostage of my granny?

94
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,941
Financing money is illegal and you have
taken hostage of a cop's granny. Waster!

95
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,110
Is she grandma to you too?

96
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:31,305
When my daddy's daddy came with this
Diana from China, she was very beautiful.

97
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,843
Both you and Vandichami call
this Chinese your grandma

98
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,674
She is my actual grandma, but she is
also the concubine of his grandpa

99
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,010
It's the people who have
to laugh at this, not you!

100
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,747
You nasty naughty granny

101
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,871
On seeing you I guessed that
many would have ogled you!

102
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,678
How dare you!

103
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,439
I never realised that there will be
two sim cards for a china mobile.

104
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,578
Save me!!!

105
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,005
Brother has come!

106
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,041
Why have you arranged
all the drinks here?

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,880
It's a business place and you
need a reason to booze here!

108
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,837
So all you need now is a reason
to booze, isn't it? - Yeah

109
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,871
Here, take this!
Now you can booze.

110
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,080
If we booze without a reason,
they'll call us a drunkard.

111
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,241
C'mon boys

112
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,913
Dude!! We have a reason!

113
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,546
Today is the birthday of our Mayil.
Is that good enough?

114
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,479
Gandhipuram market has come for a reason

115
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,476
We are rockets that booze with a reason

116
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:39,074
Who placed a marble at the
neck of a soda bottle?

117
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,371
Who placed the necklace on
the neck of Solaiamma?

118
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,275
We'll booze in the wine garden,
who has fenced it? - Not me!

119
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:59,711
Who is on a high after
sniffing a buttermilk bottle?

120
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,580
Dude's name is Vasu,
the boss of market

121
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,804
He looks class and whatever
he touches rains cash

122
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,742
It's fire interest for
the load bearers...

123
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,877
It's water interest for
girls who steal men's heart

124
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,275
Dude's name is Vasu,
the boss of market

125
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,642
He looks class and whatever
he touches rains cash

126
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,373
Search for a cab inside the cabbage!

127
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,380
Search for the finger
in a lady's finger

128
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:10,381
Who is this lotus in skirt?

129
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,642
To have left this rose
with a blouse is a sin

130
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,603
Birthday belle Mayil.. is
a charming belle dancer..

131
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,679
Touch her and you land in jail...
to come out you need bail..

132
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,714
Coimbatore girls are strong tongued..

133
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:31,037
Guys who withstand strong
tongues have a strong heart

134
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:35,604
Dude's name is Vasu,
the boss of market

135
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,773
He looks class and whatever
he touches rains cash

136
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:01,644
Pickle helps to have a hot drink

137
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,573
A brawl is needed for a bold drink

138
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,748
A love failure is needed for a silent drink

139
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,542
To drink without a reason
makes us a drunkard

140
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,442
If you join we'll have a party..
till it gets dirty...

141
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,613
Enjoy the booze till you doze

142
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:36,942
Marudhamalai Murugans favourite child..
We are this market's adorable child.

143
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,704
We've to somehow get both the
principal and interest today!

144
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,245
It's been 1.5 years since my
daughter was married to your son

145
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,004
Shouldn't you people be taking care of her

146
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,340
These are the guys who acted in
Chinna Goundar and Nattamai movies.

147
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,313
These guys roaming around not
knowing that Coimbatore is a city!

148
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,546
Brother.. Did you see my husband?

149
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:11,443
- What's the name of your husband sister?
- Kovai Selvan

150
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:17,245
Oh! That guy! He is driving along
with a girl in green skirt

151
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,538
What are you saying??
My darling!!!

152
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,666
- Why are you spoiling their relationship?
- She is just over doing her role

153
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,772
You too talk like as though
you are from Madurai!

154
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,313
I don't know why am not
able to change it.

155
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,280
Divya.. Divya..

156
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,377
Ehh.. Divya, I want to tell you something.

157
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:39,113
You can call me D..
What's it about?

158
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,674
D. I love you sincerely.

159
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,275
I can't live without you

160
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,444
Ok. I too will love you.

161
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,944
But if I get someone better,
then I'll go with him.

162
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,613
No, I'll marry you before that.

163
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:55,444
Even after that, I'll divorce you
and go with him. Is that ok?

164
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,076
Why are you talking so indifferent?

165
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,780
I always talk like this.

166
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,977
I thought you are a good girl.
What kind of a girl are you??

167
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,513
My shoes worth 2000 bucks have
worn out roaming behind you.

168
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,740
It's not D for Divya... you are a
devil, danger, I'll demolish my love!

169
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,240
- Stop! Get out of the car.
- Who's this?

170
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,706
Who are you?

171
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,080
If someone proposes, you tell them
whether you'll accept it or not

172
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,381
Instead of that, why do you say that you'll
leave him if you find someone better

173
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,376
- Sir, please.
- Why do you take guys for granted?

174
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,846
Who are you? -Excuse me sir

175
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,947
Have your parents given birth to you
and just left you? - I love you

176
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,347
What did you say?

177
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,979
I just said it to shut you up

178
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,399
Why do you blabber not knowing anything?

179
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,209
Do you know why I spoke
to him like that?

180
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,870
That guy truly loves me.

181
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,078
If I tell him that I
don't like him,

182
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,238
he'll be depressed, he'll grow a
beard and spoil his life.

183
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,299
I've saved his life
assassinating my character.

184
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,371
Why are you shouting
without knowing all this?

185
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,242
- Sorry... the mistake is on my part.
- Lets go before he falls at her feet

186
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,808
The mistake is on my part.
Send everyone away.

187
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,243
Haven't you all seen an
embarrassed guy before?

188
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,777
- Get in the car girls.
- Don't mistake me. Sit down.

189
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:20,738
D is not Divya.. discipline,
diplomatic, divine, godly

190
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,446
- We need a loan on our house.- I'll check
the formalities. You may meet sir.

191
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,509
- Owner of RK Exports Rajasekhar sent us
- Whom should I kill?

192
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,347
Coimbatore ADSP Sivakozhundhu.

193
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,379
- What's the problem?
- There is small case on our boss.

194
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,413
This ADSP is creating lot
of problems in this case.

195
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,611
What's the case?

196
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,010
3 women working in our
company went missing

197
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,204
They didn't go missing.

198
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
They were raped and
killed by your boss.

199
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,572
If this is revealed your
boss will be behind bars

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,978
Ok. I'll take care.

201
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,281
You have come to Annam finance
to get loan on your house.

202
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,347
The records should also
be like that only.

203
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,847
You should get me a new sim card

204
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,442
You'll get calls from unknown numbers

205
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,311
You have to pick it

206
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,347
You shouldn't make any calls
from that number.

207
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,178
Where should we pay you?

208
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,547
You'll get a call. Now leave.

209
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,537
- Brother
- Sundaram. ADSP Sivakozhundhu

210
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,977
Get all his details

211
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,072
- Tell me brother. - Call me after
getting a new sim card - Ok brother

212
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,107
Reverse it

213
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,613
Why are we here to buy groceries?

214
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
- Setu is acting.
- I am stamping him!

215
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,503
When will you return the cash?

216
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,576
- Tomorrow. - How many tomorrows?
- Tomorrow for sure.

217
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,139
You talk in tamil before
borrowing

218
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,377
And when we ask you to
return you talk in Hindi

219
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,237
and you give company to him.
- Tomorrow I'll definitely return it

220
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,345
Setu, you leave

221
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,738
Vasu. Ooty potato is coming!

222
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,906
You seem to appear
suddenly like god.

223
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:52,407
You only said the other day that I
am godly! - Come, take your seat

224
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,071
Is this your house or shop?

225
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,537
It's my house, shop, office, bachelor
den, party hall all together!

226
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,303
He looks like a Marwadi guy.
What's the problem with him?

227
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,176
He borrowed 40000 to party with his
friends without his parents knowledge

228
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,604
Normally we borrow from them

229
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,847
To change that, I lent money to him!

230
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,773
- Oh, You're into financing?
- No we're into banking

231
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,446
What's the interest in your bank?

232
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,478
Fire Interest

233
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,213
- Means?
- The interest rate is like fire.

234
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,780
Can't bear the heat. Till his corpse gets
burnt he'll only pay the interest

235
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,737
Why do you embarrass me?

236
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,737
How do know hindi?

237
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:30,139
He has watched the movie 'Bombay' 10 times.
Manisha Koirala has taught him!

238
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:32,808
It's my second language in school.
So I know a little bit.

239
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,538
Bro. Tell her that I also know hindi.

240
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,678
Oh is it? Let me hear.

241
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:44,606
(Indian Railways Announcement)

242
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,176
- Chennai Express I'm watching 7 times.
- Really?

243
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,745
Don't you trust me?

244
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,511
Start the music!

245
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,211
Stop it!

246
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,710
When a guest comes won't
you serve her anything?

247
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,444
Get something chill from the fridge
- No no. That's alright.

248
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,713
- No, you've come for the first time.
- Ok fine

249
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,408
Here, Drink.
- Hey What's this?

250
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,710
Beer. It's very chill.
You can feel it.

251
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,245
What's this?

252
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,776
In our fridge only this is available.
Won't she drink this?

253
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,209
Ok. Am leaving. Thank you.
Meet you next time.

254
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,778
Why has she left?

255
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,479
For her style and color, she'll
have 10 beers in one shot

256
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,711
She is acting

257
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,072
You!!

258
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,647
Don't you know that I don't
drink without a reason?

259
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,570
Won't she think that I am a drunkard?

260
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,047
Why are you hitting me just because
she thinks of you like that?

261
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,106
From tomorrow onwards I'll
keep coffee in the fridge.

262
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,377
Has he gone?
He's going behind her!

263
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,242
What's the program for the day?
We have a meeting with UK buyers at 2.00pm

264
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,873
There is a new machine at the garment
factory, we've to see the demo.

265
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:33,511
Our relatives have come to
talk about the temple pooja

266
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,571
- Watch out for the dog.
- Greetings sir.

267
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,166
Welcome Welcome. How are you uncle.

268
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:46,147
Suseela. Call sister in law.

269
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,003
Welcome. Welcome uncle.

270
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:01,408
The temple pooja is fixed
on 18th of Chithira month.

271
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:05,446
When brother was alive, you all
came and graced the function

272
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,747
Now a days you all are
not coming there

273
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:13,244
Pollachi is just 30 miles. We'll be satisfied
if you come with your family. - We will try

274
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,173
Since you people have
settled in the cities

275
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,212
Few back there are trying to take control

276
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,299
What do you mean?

277
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,473
28 years ago, your uncle

278
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,771
...willed to give 1.5 acres of land
in Coimatore town to the temple

279
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,943
But your uncle demised before
that could be registered

280
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,871
Today it is worth 18 crores

281
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,843
The curator of our
temple, Annathandavam..

282
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,239
...he is hell bent on
acquiring that property

283
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,537
Why don't you remove him
from the post?

284
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,647
Who can be against him?

285
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:50,914
Before the temple pooja, we'll have to
inform EO and remove him from that post

286
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,737
...and Ramasamy should take up the post.

287
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,901
That is not needed uncle.

288
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,332
- Brother!
- Yes sister in law!

289
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,778
You should take up that post.

290
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,645
Yes!

291
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:02,410
During exam holidays,
we'll go to our native.

292
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,004
We'll stay there till the end of the pooja.

293
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,407
I'll get the house readied.

294
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,880
Fix a good day..

295
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,312
...to register the 1.5 acres of
land in the name of the temple.

296
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,039
Kuttipuli, have your tea.

297
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,544
Ooty Potato is on it's way.

298
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:28,614
Along with it brinjal, tomato,
carrot and beans in jeans is coming

299
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:33,942
It's obvious that you are munching
this beans thinking of that jeans

300
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:34,942
ls Vasu here?

301
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,533
- Why?
- I need a loan for three days.

302
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:40,913
If we are giving you a loan,
what will you mortgage for it?

303
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,212
We haven't brought anything.

304
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:45,366
It's alright. Let that girl stay here.

305
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,278
You can take her after you
give back the cash.

306
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,978
- A...
. B...

307
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,240

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,179
- I'll talk to Vasu.
0k, he is here.

309
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,476
D.. What are you doing here?
Nice to see all your friends.

310
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:00,409
This is my friend Anitha.
She has got a job offer in the US

311
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,610
So we asked her for a treat.

312
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,543
We need 30000 to
arrange for a Girls party

313
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,212
30000 for a party?

314
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,904
We've asked for a party at the Meridian.
It's a 5 star hotel.

315
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,777
I've purchased beyond my credit card limit.
I'll repay in 3 days.

316
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:16,914
- I'll get it bro

317
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,245
- 900..

318
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,179
- Why?
- Fire interest

319
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,873
That's for business people. For
girls only water interest.

320
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,244
This looks like ice water interest

321
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,280
Would you like to have something chill?

322
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,670
No please.

323
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,401
Ok. Something hot?

You asked for something hot..

Tea, coffee, bournvita, ragi malt...

327
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,146
No please. We don't need anything.

328
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,743
Won't you invite us for the party?

329
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,875
It's a girls party, that's Why! - We'll
sit in a corner to know what it's is

330
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,376

00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,513
You have to wear Pyjama,
Dhothi and shirt.

00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,814
- You look like Poet Vairamuthu

333
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:03,611
Tell something about me

334
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,712
You seem to have a stuffed belly.

335
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,199
You look like a penguin in pants!

336
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,178
Look there.

337
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,614
Nice to see you all in the dress code

338
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:28,778
This is your table

339
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,566
Go and find a seat

340
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,944
What are you staring at?

341
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,307
This dress looks good

342
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:36,439
Is this dress good? or do I
look good in this dress?

343
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,244
You look like an angel.
- Thank you

344
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,639
Why are you very formal?
Just be yourself

345
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,673
I've already booked the buffet

346
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,843
Cannot miss the fish biriyani here.

347
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,241
<i>Eat we“ Pant“. OK'!?</i>

348
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,946
I'll be back in 2 minutes.

349
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,912
I thought she just called for namesake.
But she is very caring.

350
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,970
She reminds me of my eloped sister

351
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,644
Only when you get free food
will you think of your...

352
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,180
...eloped sister and unwanted
uncle and demised granny!

353
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,109
Mocktail order please.

354
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,904
They are giving names before they eat.
Let us also go and give our names.

355
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,670
Those are the names ofjuices.

356
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,104
They all sound like girls names!

357
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,041
Virgin Mary?
Why do they have to say all this?

358
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:27,413
Tomato juice served in glass
with salt is Virgin Mary.

359
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,666
Then call it Tomato Mary!

360
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,442
Sir, mocktail order please.

361
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,213
What did that girl in green order?

362
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,676
Virgin Mary sir.
- Virgin soori for me!

363
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,671
What's that sir?

364
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,944
Get us all a peg of brandy
mixed with whiskey.

365
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:43,339
Anitha has got a chance in
US that we have all not got.

366
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,747
That's not a straw!
Put it down.

367
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,274
It was silent so long.
Now they've gone crazy

368
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,913
Now time is sorrow. We are
gonna miss Anitha for 4 years.

369
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:08,208
So lets feel for 2 minutes

370
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,713
They were so happy earlier. Now
they seem to be drenched in sorrow.

371
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,975
Are they nuts?

372
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:22,413
Think of those who are gonna marry them!

373
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,480
They need to smile and cry
at their wife's wish!

374
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:25,808
All of them are gonna suffer!

375
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,778
- She is coming
- Hide the drinks

376
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,540
Vasu. We'll be having fun like this.

377
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:31,912
You eat and leave.

378
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:35,611
Why are you all hiding a
hand under the table?

379
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,013
The left hand mustn't know
what the right hand eats

380
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:41,808
You are saying the proverb wrongly

381
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,113
There is some gravy on your shirt.

382
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,580
No no. It'll spread. I'll do it.

383
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:56,214
Oh beauty of world, I am lost in you

384
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:05,348
My heart melts for your love

385
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:17,381
I need not see beauty in angels

386
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,771
You're my angel
True from my heart!

387
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,944
My eyes see no tears

388
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:30,847
I see no reason to find myself today

389
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:35,244
Nights are sleepless
thinking of what you said

390
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,477
My whole life is shaken by your fiery looks

391
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,279
You've infected in me your love

392
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,077
You hold my life, beloved one!

393
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:18,406
My life has leaned towards none

394
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,347
Until the moment I saw you.

395
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,173
My life has seen no defeats

396
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:31,638
Until the moment you saw me

397
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,770
You're a talking god
You're my life's good deed

398
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:39,811
You're my lovely angel
You're the tree of love

399
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:45,141
Oh beauty of world, I am lost in you

400
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:19,513
The morning has not left me yet

401
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:23,840
And so is my dreams about you

402
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:28,106
I've no urge to raise and start

403
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:32,208
Because your thoughts are still sunk in me

404
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,777
First love is sheer pain

405
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:40,907
A pain that gives sheer pleasure

406
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,677
My heart melts for you

407
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:12,206
Nights are sleepless
thinking of what you said

408
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:16,203
My whole life is shaken by your fiery looks

409
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,771
You've infected in me your love

410
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:25,206
You hold my life, beloved one!

411
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:51,704
- Start the vehicle.
- The signal is still red.

412
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,247
Start the vehicle I say!

413
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,913
Can't you see that the door is not properly
closed? Didn't you get the indication?

414
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,346
Having followed ADSP
Sivakozhundhu it is found that..

415
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:54,944
...he visits Kaveri complex twice a month
on saturdays with his wife to watch a movie

416
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,809
All other times, he is surrounded by cops.

417
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,074
Tomorrow is satu rd ay

418
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,813
We'll finish him.
- In Theatre?

419
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,770
After the movie, he'll drop his
wife and proceed to office

420
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,544
So mostly he will be in uniform

421
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:13,945
That's a minus.

422
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:17,009
But there are two plus points.

423
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,076
Though he comes in uniform
he does not carry his gun.

424
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,540
Another thing.. he self drives.

425
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:29,139
- Which team shall we use?
- Use the team of Thudiyallur Nithya

426
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:32,715
Use 10 biharis working in different mills

427
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,804
One of them should know tamil

428
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,614
Sundaram, You should be
within the theatre compound.

429
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,608
It's strange that you are
asking me to be at the spot

430
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:40,712
It's a cop

431
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,303
If there is any change in the scene, the
plan needs to be aborted immediately

432
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:45,936
<i>- OK brother</i>

433
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,946
Only after SP leaves the house,

434
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:51,513
the boys at the spot should get to
know of whom they are gonna murder.

435
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,678
His wife should not be
killed under any situation.

436
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:05,211
Bro, no need of an english movie.
Can't follow them. - Just come sleep there.

437
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,441
- Hey Kuttipuli.
- Coming Vasu

438
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,413
- 'Live happily! Live happily!' (Plantain)
- 'I'll not, I'll not' ( Plantain Leaf)

439
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:13,912
You nasty witch

440
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,978
Your brother is wishing
you to have a happy life

441
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:18,812
You shout out that you won't

442
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,707
Do you want some one to make you happy

443
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:25,071
'Groundnuts'
'Boiled nuts'

444
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,947
You say it's not boiled
even after boiling it

445
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,304
Why sell these wasted nuts

446
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,847
Are you talking ill of my skills

447
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,141
You are nuts and
you sell peanuts

448
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,440
I'll pull out your nuts

449
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,847
Where are you running? You'll
have to get back here.

450
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,474
- Hey Vasu.
- Hi

451
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:52,713
Anitha gave me the cash.
I came to return it.

452
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,705
Where are you guys going? - He is forcing us
to an english movie which we'll not follow!

453
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,780
Which movie are you all going to?
- Coffee Tea

454
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,811
Hey.. It's Gravity. It's
playing at the Kaveri theatre.

455
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,105
Vasu, I haven't watched that movie. My friends
do not join me as it's a sci-fi films.

456
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,312
So can I join you?

457
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,740
<i>OK. We can remove one
guy from our gang'.!</i>

458
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,877
I had informed I'll
be at home for lunch.

459
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,633
My father will be waiting for me

460
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,807
I'll finish my lunch
and catch you there.

461
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,007
Give me my ticket
It's Kaveri theatre, right?

462
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,312
Here

463
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,977
Bro, none of us are coming with you.

464
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,476
You go alone with her and
propose your love.

465
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,711
There is just 26000!
- What?

466
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,780
You drank without our knowledge?

467
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,180
...who will pay the bar bill of 4000 bucks?

468
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,310
I've deducted that.

469
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,977
D.. Where are you? - Got held up. You
go inside the theatre, I'll join you.

470
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:08,176
SP has started from the house. - I'll show the
photo to the boys and ask them to be alert

471
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,847
Ask two of them to be near the bike stand.

472
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:18,846
Send two boys near the car

473
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,978
Two guys get behind the car

474
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,278
SP has come.
Be alert.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,980
D..Come fast. The movie is gonna start.

476
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,110
- I can't come inside.
- Why? What happened?

477
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,177
- Something is wrong, you
come outside immediately.

478
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,166
Sir! Sir please forgive me!
- Who is this?

479
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,147
Who are you?

480
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,576
Come fast.
- Somebody save us

481
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,948
Vasu, are you ok? -Where are you?
- I just reached home.

482
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:16,640
All the 4 who were caught are
biharis working in MMC mills

483
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,008
It was all planned

484
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,741
I want to meet the
guy who saved you

485
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,404
Where is that guy?

486
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,837
Sir... Where is that guy?

487
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,179
He has admitted you here and
we haven't seen him since then

488
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:36,747
How could you leave a
guy who has saved me?

489
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:38,914
The hospital is covered
with surveillance cameras

490
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,280
Don't search for him like a criminal

491
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,578
You say they're
contract killers.

492
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,707
By identifying him lets
not put him in trouble

493
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,180
You all may leave.

494
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,881
So long they haven't shown you in real.
Now they've shown you!

495
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,278
Crap!
He escaped!

496
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,074
You guys have missed him

497
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,073
Sorry brother.
I'll find him for sure

498
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,841
Will kill him wherever I see him

499
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,175
We've tried to kill a
cop in a public place

500
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:07,241
if 100 people are scared at least one
will be bold enough to retaliate

501
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,170
You must've finished
him there itself

502
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,970
...rather than finding and killing him

503
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,574
We eat crap for money..

504
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,138
"Should we be worried about self respect?

505
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,946
We should carry out our task by all means

506
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,971
- First we should find out
if he was there on his own

507
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,374
...or our enemy who watches over us

508
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,140
Go.. Go search"

509
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:29,445
<i>Swim!</i>

510
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:33,742
Are you guys changing a finance
organisation to a vegetable shop?

511
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,073
Can you teach us the english
names of vegetables?

512
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,044
There is no relation between a
ledger book and vegetablel!

513
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:39,306
Anyway, start your questions.

514
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:42,045
- What for "Poosnikai"? - The first
question is in a way related to you.

515
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,270
Pumpkin

516
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,273
- What's for "Urulakizhangu"
- Potato

517
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,137
- What's for "Thakkali"
- Tomato

518
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,143
- What's for "Vendakkai"
- Lady's finger

519
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,575
- What's for "Sundakkai"

520
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,980
- Gent's...

521
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:57,712
finger

522
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:02,045
- Don't lie. A lady's finger is
long like the finger of a girl

523
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,899
- How can a round "sundakkai"
be Gent's finger?

524
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,878
- Do you know the name?
- No

525
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,804
- Then listen to someone who knows it

526
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:09,911
As though you are a genius

527
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:12,307
Talking sexy in the name of
asking sensible questions!

528
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,680
Rascal, I'll kill you!
Look at his head!

529
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,513
What's for Plantain?

530
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,977
You sack of Charcoal!
Stop there! Stop!

531
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,339
D.. Why are you upset?

532
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,670
Without telling anyone of us, she
is in love with a guy named Anwar!

533
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:39,307
Since her parents are against their love,
she has planned to elope.

534
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,170
If you elope, won't your
parents think ill of us?

535
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,107
You all should make a promise

536
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:47,643
That we will not fall in love
for the whole of our life!

537
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:49,911
D.. What's this?
- My guy will commit suicide!

538
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,578
Ok. Ok. I understand.

539
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:52,645
We can fall in love.. But..

540
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:55,145
There should be logic
and ethics in that

541
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,199
we should not cross the
limits of morality

542
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,178
<i>- OK'!
- OK 0K 0K</i>

543
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,678
- Ok. Let's have coffee.

544
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,469
- I'll go meet Vasu and come.
- Hmm mm mm

545
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,609
He is just my good friend ok?
Don't making fun of me.

546
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,173
Vasu. How did you
know that I am here?

547
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:14,445
I saw your car outside.

548
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:17,539
I have to tell you something.

549
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:20,573
- But I don't know how to express!
- Just say it

550
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,873
What will you reply if I
tell you that I love you?

551
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:26,080
My reply would be
'I'll slipper you!'

552
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:29,647
I'll say that only if you propose!
Anyway you are not gonna do that!

553
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,405
I love you

554
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,480
- What?
- I said I love you!

555
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,340
Ok. I will also love you

556
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:43,008
- But if I find someone
better, I will go with him!

557
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,578
Is that fine?

558
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:50,038
Are you taking advantage?
I've been very liberal!

559
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,877
It's a mistake to be friends
with a guy from the market!

560
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,314
What status does he have
to fall in love with me?

561
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,545
What did you say?

562
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:00,412
Come again

563
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,376
What status do you have
to fall in love with me?

564
00:45:15,067 --> 00:45:18,139
You could've slippered
me instead!

565
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,770
Why did you talk to him like that?

566
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:36,144
I considered Vasu as a good friend.

567
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,681
I got angry when he told
me that he loves me!

568
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:44,446
Fine, now do you like him or not?

569
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:48,845
I don't know!

570
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:53,046
This girl talked nicely
but finally ditched you

571
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,614
She was around you like
an eagle for her needs

572
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,937
Once her job was done, she
bite you like a snake!

573
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,412
She has been around him since she
knows that he finances money!

574
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,535
Keep quiet.

575
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,766
If she doesn't like, she should've said
that. Why does she talk about status?

576
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:08,338
Then why did she come to
the theatre with him?

577
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,174
Keep quiet and
mind your business.

578
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,966
All the brave ones turn cowards

579
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:16,174
and cowards turn brave only after
falling in this insane love!

580
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,777
Girls these days need someone
to roam with before marriage

581
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,038
After marriage they need a husband
to take them on a foreign tour

582
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,746
For Vasu, going abroad is not a big deal

583
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,178
What do you mean?

584
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:31,448
Vasu is the eldest son of the
owner of Kovai Group company!

585
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,077
His house is a palace!

586
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:44,107
Vasu's cousin in Tiruppur got engaged.

587
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,481
4 days before the marriage, there was a party
for the groom's family at Vasu's house.

588
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:53,115
His small mistakes were looked
as grave ones by his mom

589
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,837
She got furious over an incident in
which he was not involved at all.

590
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:00,207
You said it's a party?
Nothing else?

591
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,578
Shut up. Mom is here.

592
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:05,312
Nothing mom!

593
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:19,215
- Hello
- I need to talk to you

594
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,909
- Where are you?
- I am inside the house

595
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,109
Durga.. Durga..

596
00:47:29,233 --> 00:47:32,112
Bride! Everyone is out there...

597
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:33,612
Why are you alone here?

598
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:37,446
I am not interested in this marriage

599
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:39,045
What are you saying?

600
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,346
Only 4 days is left
for the marriage

601
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,347
You could've told
your parents earlier.

602
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:47,047
Dad will kill me
if I tell him this

603
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:48,912
- You love someone?
- Hmm

604
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,878
who?

605
00:47:58,434 --> 00:47:59,412
Are you out of your mind?

606
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:00,945
Talking nonsense!

607
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:03,537
I've never seen you
with that thought

608
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,504
Don't spoil the name of our family!

609
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:06,712
- If someone...
- Look

610
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:11,211
- I can't live without you
- Durga..

611
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,144
Take me somewhere and marry me!

612
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,004
No Durga. Listen to me.

613
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:21,712
What are you doing? What did you
do to my daughter? She is crying!

614
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,574
- Nothing Uncle...
- Manimegala

615
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,478
- Come here!
- Manimegala

616
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:27,745
- What happened?

617
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,974
You brought us to your brother's house and
now see what your brother's son has done?

618
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:33,508
What happened? What's the problem?

619
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:36,877
She is gonna get married in 4 days and
now he's trying to abuse my daughter!

620
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:41,144
Loafer! Look at his brought up!
You have humiliated us!

621
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,543
- Why are you talking ill of them?

622
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,681
Who is talking ill?

623
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,374
I trusted you all!

624
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:50,545
What happened?

625
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,379
Why did you come in?

626
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,277
- No mom..
- Why did you come inside?

627
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:59,039
Why did you come? Why?

628
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,871
Sister. Be patient. Why are you hitting
him without knowing what has happened?

629
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,645
Be patient.

630
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,241
Let's enquire what has happened.

631
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,080
What more do you want to enquire?

632
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,774
He's a good guy

633
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:15,107
So, are you trying
to blame my daughter?

634
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:18,415
Your brother is dead and gone.
Why are they still here

635
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,669
Give them their share
and send them out

636
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,445
Don't talk unnecessarily!

637
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:24,008
She's
everything in this house!

638
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,338
Don't you dare talk ill of her!

639
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,478
Mind your tongue!

640
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:30,211
Stop it. Stop it I say!

641
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:35,607
I've considered you as my child.

642
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:39,639
You have embarrassed us in
front of the groom's family!

643
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,074
What will they think of my daughter?

644
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,243
Don't bother about anyone. Our
daughter in law is important to us.

645
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,471
Just because some rogue has misbehaved with
her, we can't stand against her! You come!

646
00:49:55,434 --> 00:50:01,214
You have made people spit on my
face regarding your brought up.

647
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,978
You have embarrassed all of us!

648
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:07,745
Get out of the house!

649
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,878
Go..

650
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:11,745
Get out!

651
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:28,640
Don't you dare to enter
this house till am alive.

652
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:31,938
Why are you leaving
without saying anything?

653
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,811
His cousin remained silent
thinking of her future

654
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,940
but that banished him from the house

655
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:49,914
Being a servant in that home, he
mingled with me like a friend

656
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,448
That is why I also left
that house along with him

657
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:57,940
Despite all this, she is asking
about the status of my friend!

658
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,871
Put the sword in the car. I'll
go to her house and butcher her!

659
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,012
Enquire about him

660
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,278
Which place are you all from?

661
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:14,411
We are from Bihar

662
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,278
We are at the theatre

663
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,610
- You don't show your face
- I am in the car

664
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,279
Yes.That waster is not here.

665
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,709
Had he been here, I
would've finished him

666
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:31,271
You all come to Gandhipuram Mangala lodge.
He might be there.

667
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:41,645
Hmm. I've started.

668
00:51:49,134 --> 00:51:51,774
Don't know who he is. But
he came in a black car.

669
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,874
Brother. They say that
he came in a black car.

670
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,673
Collect more details from nearby.

671
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,880
Go!
Turn Right!

672
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:09,712
Stop here!

673
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:18,307
- Vasu.
- Hey, what happened?

674
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:24,204
- Hello Rahul, What is it?

675
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:26,739
- Sister eloped!
- What?

676
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,137
I saw her going with Anwar.

677
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,675
- Tell me.- Ramya, Chitra has eloped with
that guy. Come to my house immediately.

678
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,711
- How will I come at this time?
- Hang up!

679
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:41,908
- Parents are sleeping. They can't
bear it if they come to know of this.

680
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,078
Just cool down Rahul. Wait.

681
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:47,645
Your friends can't handle all this.
Call Vasu.

682
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:50,633
Leave it. Let her elope!

683
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,113
Her parents are not aware of this.

684
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,207
They will commit suicide if they come
to know that their daughter has eloped!

685
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,909
They've started just 20 minutes back.
Must've crossed only 15Kms

686
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,773
Make all the market guys search at the
bus stand, railway station...

687
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,333
Ask them to search all buses and cars

688
00:53:09,334 --> 00:53:11,814
Tell them it's Annachi's issue. Call
bhai and inform <i>-I'll</i> talk to him bro.

689
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,145
Get in the car.

690
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:17,641
- I am going to all her friends house.
Call me if there is anything.

691
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,476
- Rahul you go home.
- search everywhere.

692
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,104
<i>- I'll</i> wake up all our guys

693
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,238
Search in the trains that are
about to depart - Ok Vasu

694
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:31,843
- I am at Ukkadam bus stand.
- Search all departing buses

695
00:53:32,067 --> 00:53:34,206
They are not at Singanallur bus stand.
- Did you inform bhai?

696
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,978
Driver. Stop the bus.

697
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,236
Our guys are watching over Sulur check post

698
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,041
I've informed bhai. He'll call you.
- OK

699
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,344
Our area guys have gone with them

700
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:44,512
Bhai, What are you saying?

701
00:53:44,634 --> 00:53:45,966
Their mobiles are off

702
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:48,140
I've asked to search Kotamedu completely.

703
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,841
Not here anywhere! Searched all trains.
- Ok. Get in the car

704
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:54,740
<i>- Come to Vattapamm
- OK Vasu</i>

705
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,573
- Ok. I'll call you back.

706
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:03,212
How can they be missed?

707
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,275
He's not in his place,
nor at the bus stand" train!

708
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,880
At 5.30 there is a train to Kerala that takes
the vegetable load, what train is that?

709
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,110
That's Bokaro Steel express. It goes via
Pothanur and not through coimbatore

710
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,678
Let's start

711
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,704
You go that way.
You go this side.

712
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,076
Vasu they are there.

713
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,206
Chitra, Don't run!
Stop there!

714
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,673
Don't you have any brains.
Why do you run?

715
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,933
Leave it Vasu. Her parents
are not accepting.

716
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:39,277
That's why we took
this decision.

717
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:40,435
Why would they?

718
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,544
Would they just give away
their daughter to some guy?

719
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,208
Leave it Vasu.
It's about our life!

720
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:46,544
Which is life???

721
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,073
Being Friends on the first meeting,
lovers after getting to know each other..

722
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:51,405
Getting married within 30 days and
getting divorced after 3 months.

723
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:52,945
IS this life?

724
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,141
All parents trust us and
just latch the door

725
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,973
They don't lock it up and keep
the keys under the pillow

726
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:02,813
But you relinquished your house!

727
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,074
You ditched your parents!

728
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:08,408
Do you know their greatness?

729
00:55:09,634 --> 00:55:10,908
You'll never realise it
when they are with you

730
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,607
only when they are not
there, will you realise

731
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,277
There is no history of people living
happily after ditching their parents.

732
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,641
It's not wrong to fall in love

733
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,377
There should be a logic and ethics in that

734
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,345
Listen to me carefully

735
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,938
I'll talk to her parents and unite you both

736
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,879
You take Chitra to her house.
I'll wait till they accept

737
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:46,543
- Sister
- Sorry. I'm Sorry

738
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,277
Annachi, tell Bhai not to
do anything to those guys

739
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,840
Vasu. Do you like your
parents very much?

740
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,278
Yeah

741
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,880
Are they not with you now?

742
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:07,445
No

743
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:18,014
Thank you Vasu.

744
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,806
I shouldn't have spoken to you
like that, the other day. I am sorry.

745
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,178
It's alright.

746
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:28,943
Go and sleep. I'll meet you later.

747
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,340
- Is everything alright?
- Everything is fine mom.

748
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,341
Why do look very pale?

749
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:40,138
One day I spoke harshly to Vasu

750
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:46,107
Without keeping that in his mind, he was
running around for me just because I asked him

751
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:49,708
That's ok. Why are you crying?

752
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:51,708
I love Vasu mom.

753
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,446
- I love him mom.
- That's OK.

754
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:57,576
He is a good guy.

755
00:56:58,134 --> 00:57:00,011
- It's OK dear.
- Thank you mom.

756
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,579
Hey Kuttipuli. Where have you been?

757
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,237
I heard that Kovai express
entered Gandhipuram bus stand

758
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:10,304
I moved it aside and..

759
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,648
...I heard that the airport
runway was filled with cow dung

760
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:15,244
lam coming after cleaning all of it

761
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:16,437
Why are you drunk?

762
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,340
Get lost

763
00:57:18,534 --> 00:57:20,707
It is said not to enter the
house of those who disrespect.

764
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:22,241
Will you enter?

765
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:26,974
At the coffee shop the other
day, she humiliated you.

766
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:29,844
- Didn't you realise then?
- Don't talk unnecessarily.

767
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,771
Today she called you
saying somebody eloped

768
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:39,546
Tomorrow she will call you
if her servant is absent

769
00:57:40,034 --> 00:57:42,810
The next day she'll say
that her mom is not well

770
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:45,337
and she'll ask you to cook.

771
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:50,481
You will also buy vegetables
and feed her parents.

772
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,644
He is unconscious!

773
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,838
I'll stamp you if you irritate

774
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,980
- Waster
- I'll buy you another peg.

775
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:00,512
- See he has woken up

776
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:06,947
Hi Vasu. When did you come?

777
00:58:07,434 --> 00:58:09,607
How are you? ls everything fine?

778
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,976
You could've called me also when you went.
I would've joined you.

779
00:58:13,434 --> 00:58:15,209
- Is Divya fine?
- Oh my! he has started!

780
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,045
Ok. See you later.

781
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:19,404
Won't you ever change?

782
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,973
- Who is talking about getting changed?
- It's me

783
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,177
It's not you.
Don't I know your voice?

784
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:28,109
Who is it?? I'll butcher
you without a sword!

785
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,447
Kovai group drumstick is here!

786
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,376
- You haven't changed a bit
- You're also still the same

787
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,376
- Haven't you turned a good leaf yet?
- Haven't you changed this tie yet?

788
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,946
Right from wiping your face to
sneezing you are using this!

789
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:43,603
Yes brother. What
brings you here?

790
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,179
- Uncle requested you to come to
Peelamedu register office by 2 pm - Why?

791
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,208
D.. Where are you?

792
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:56,336
I am on my way to meet Vasu.
- Why?

793
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:57,778
I am gonna propose to him.

794
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,066
What happened to your logic and ethics?

795
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,877
There is lot of logic in our
love and even more ethics.

796
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:09,147
- The temple asset is in the right hands now
- This would make Annathandavam angry

797
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:14,247
Greetings. The documents are getting ready and
will inform you once it is done. - Ok Uncle.

798
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:27,080
- Hello I am D...
- I am Da here..

799
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,078
Where is vasu?

800
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,780
Selvi

801
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:44,145
Hello sister

802
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,609
ls mine and Durga's signature
mandatory, Kumarasamy?

803
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:51,642
You are a legal heir and Durga is a major.
Signature is mandatory

804
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:54,538
I'll wait in the car. Call me
when it's ready. - Ok sister

805
00:59:57,434 --> 00:59:58,412
Daddy

806
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:01,947
Vasu brother is standing alone.
Go and talk to him.

807
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,513
- At least I'll go and talk to him
- No dear.

808
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:08,838
Elder mom will not say anything

809
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,145
No dear

810
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:13,347
Your aunt is here. She'll create a ruckus!

811
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,944
It's pathetic to see him stand alone.

812
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,478
Selvi.

813
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:27,970
- Stop! Where are you going?
- I came to meet Vasu

814
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:30,014
- You can't meet him now.
- Why?

815
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:31,940
- His mom and uncles are here.

816
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:33,212
<i>“Hm?</i>

817
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,510
- Who is his mom?
- Everything is ready sir

818
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:39,913
That woman coming out
of the Benz is his mom.

819
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,744
You may also come.

820
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,945
You must've heard about Kovai group.
They own it.

821
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:49,272
Kovai group's owner?

822
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,079
They're here to register a property
worth 18 crores in the temples name.

823
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:00,639
Vasu has come to sign the documents.

824
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,611
You used to talk about status!

825
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:05,603
This is his status

826
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,103
Rajalakshmi Rathnasamy please come

827
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,880
Vasudevan Rathnasamy please come

828
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,047
Who is Ramasamy Nachimuthu? Please come.

829
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,580
Property worth 18 crores..

830
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,579
Equal to earnings of 40 killings.

831
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,811
Why are you coming inside the temple
with footwear, Annathandavam?

832
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:01,445
You bloody old man! Are you bringing in all
those who stayed away from the village?

833
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,180
I'll not spare anyone!

834
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,079
What injustice is this?
Won't anyone question him?

835
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:26,138
Look here! The donkey which eloped!

836
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,904
Who asked her to elope at 4 am?

837
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:33,639
Had she eloped at 1.00pm noon,
I would've also joined her.

838
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,579
Instead if she had ran on the tracks,
she would've lost some weight

839
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:41,515
Finally she made me
get hit by my friend

840
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,574
"this angel!

841
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:55,244
You bloody idiot, stupid, nonsense,
scoundrel, dirty beast..

842
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:06,149
If I say this to my boyfriend, they'll
kill you and throw you in Valankulam.

843
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,378
Hey Chithra, what happened?

844
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:11,640
What did you do, buffalo? - The subscriber
cannot be reached at the moment.

845
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:15,545
Vasu, are you Kovai group owner's son?

846
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,510
What's the matter with that?

847
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:21,706
That day, D came to the register
office to propose

848
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:24,207
When she came to know
about you, she was upset

849
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,109
Now she is at her house feeling guilty

850
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,371
- Hey! What are you saying?
- Yes! -Thanks Chithra

851
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:36,314
Chithra? Did you meet Vasu?

852
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:37,912
Are your parents fine?

853
01:03:38,634 --> 01:03:41,205
Nobody has hanged themselves right?

854
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:44,772
Shall I leave?
Khuda hafis!

855
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,976
Don't you have any sense?

856
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,171
It's available in Kannika Stores.
Buy 1/4 kg of it!

857
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:53,041
- You buffallo.- Who is that shouting
buffallo in a female voice?

858
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:56,037
Should marry her off to a idiot!

859
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:58,347
- Why brother?
- Only then she'll know the pain!

860
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:03,745
- Hi Vasu
- Hello uncle.

861
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,840
- Divya? -She is inside.
- Hello Vasu

862
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:09,271
- Hello Aunty.- She is sleeping for the
second time! Give her a surprise shock

863
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,778
Vasu?

864
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:23,504
What happened?
You look so dull.

865
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,680
Did you get scared
falling in love?

866
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,070
After knowing who you are, I feel guilty

867
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,573
lam not of your status Vasu!

868
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:38,805
They used to drop me
at school in a car.

869
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,472
Traveled to college
by college bus

870
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,980
I've never enjoyed my family status

871
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,703
lam out of the house now

872
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:49,614
Now, all that I have
is some bank balance

873
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:51,408
The car which I bought fondly

874
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,079
above all my Divya!

875
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:02,640
Vasu, make me a promise

876
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:04,145
What?

877
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,349
You must never pinpoint me with the words that
I used the other day, all through our life

878
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,613
I respect my mother,
the most in this world

879
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,676
I swear on her, that I'll never hurt you.

880
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,312
Really?

881
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,647
- I love you
- What did you say?

882
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:30,812
I said I love you

883
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,278
Vasu, What happened?

884
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:42,144
She sprained her leg and couldn't walk.
lam taking her to a doctor.

885
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:43,733
You could've told in the morning.

886
01:05:43,734 --> 01:05:46,772
Don't keep shaking your hands and feet.
He is struggling to lift you!

887
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,240
He carried this cutie in a nighty, did anything
dirty happen or did any beauty happen?

888
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:00,511
We went straight to the petrol bunk

889
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,777
Petrol bunk?

890
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,239
Filled diesel in the car and
then bought a brush and paste

891
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,345
For what?

892
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,973
He carried me just as I woke up,
so he knew that I didn't brush.

893
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:16,343
Oh! Sir likes only if
you brush and be fresh?

894
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:19,905
The car went straight to Ooty!

895
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,872
Vasu where are you running?

896
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,672
Why did he run?

897
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,741
Divya.. I love you...

898
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:35,443
To tell this he has taken her to Ooty!

899
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:36,906
He has got a good taste.

900
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:40,337
Stop it.

901
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,673
There is a black car here.
Will it be the same car?

902
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:48,211
If you don't drink in your party
only your livers will go bad.

903
01:06:50,634 --> 01:06:54,733
Looking at the way you guys drink, there
needs to be a driver to take you all.

904
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:56,611
Where are you all?

905
01:06:57,167 --> 01:07:00,239
We are sitting in front of
the government quarters.

906
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:02,139
I am going to sleep brother.

907
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,179
There is a rope on the window.
Use that to hang yourself.

908
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:07,637
I said I am going to sleep

909
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:14,713
It's him.

910
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,803
We will be late. Hang up!

911
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,277
Hang HP!

912
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,074
Brother. Get up.

913
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:28,872
Which area are you from?
What's your name?

914
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,378
Do you come here often?

915
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,913
Am asking you, Won't you reply?

916
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:36,645
I don't even know you!

917
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,044
Planning for an ambush, is it??

918
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:50,013
Police Station? I am calling
from Race course tasmac bar.

919
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,307
There is a small problem here.

920
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:55,114
Leave him. He might die.
- Let's go

921
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,708
What are you saying?

922
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:58,747
He hit us while enquiring about him

923
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,246
- How did you lose him?
- Looks like he has a plan.

924
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:03,646
Looks like it was all planned

925
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,173
Seems to be a person
who works against us

926
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,877
Load the kitchen items in the big vehicle

927
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,272
Hey Durga

928
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:16,212
What's Tiruppur lady doing
here at Coimbatore?

929
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,873
I came to hospital for baby's check up

930
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:22,942
We are going to our
native after 10 years.

931
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,009
We will take Vasu along.
- No dear

932
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,980
He's the eldest son of this family

933
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,178
How will we?

934
01:08:33,434 --> 01:08:36,210
We'll go there
Then I'll talk to sister in law

935
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,473
Hey. When did you come?

936
01:08:43,734 --> 01:08:44,712
What's it dear?

937
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:49,213
I swear on my child

938
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:53,038
There is no mistake on Vasu

939
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:55,412
lam the culprit

940
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,444
I realised that I've sinned

941
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:07,603
Why did you come inside?

942
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:16,242
Just because some rogue has misbehaved with
her, we can't doubt our daughter in law!

943
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:19,514
You have embarrassed all of us.

944
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:23,940
Don't you dare enter this house!

945
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:37,945
We must not let him sign
the Temple register.

946
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,441
When I show you a sign,
you slap him.

947
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:41,912
What's the use of that?

948
01:09:42,267 --> 01:09:46,841
They are rich. if they lose their
honor, they'll not come to our village.

949
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:50,910
- Look! He comes here regularly. Tell me who it is..
- I'll tell

950
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,974
I've enquired at the bar.

951
01:09:54,467 --> 01:09:58,438
- He is from Gandhipuram market.- There
is no need to ponder anymore. Finish him.

952
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,841
Greetings!
Why is all this required?

953
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:09,847
Greetings!
Please take your seat.

954
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:17,410
Ramasamy sir, the people of this village
have nominated you as this temple's curator.

955
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:21,147
Please sign in this register.

956
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:34,139
Are you talking like this
because of your new position?

957
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:42,981
Why lay your
hands on him?

958
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:45,981
Annathandavam! All this is not for good.

959
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:04,448
He has dishonored you knowing
that he can't stand against you.

960
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,207
We've filed a police complain

961
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,478
lam Rajalakshmi here.

962
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,079
Yes tell me. What's the matter?
- I am your mother Rajalakshmi speaking

963
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,312
Mom...

964
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:40,280
Sorry mom.. Your voice...

965
01:11:41,034 --> 01:11:42,479
Come here immediately.

966
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,580
What mom?
- Come to our house.

967
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:48,112
Ok mom.

968
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:13,640
- Is Vasu here?
- He has gone to his native

969
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,133
I came to borrow money,
which is his native?

970
01:12:16,134 --> 01:12:17,112
- Sethumada, near Pollachi

971
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,345
- Sethumada?
- Yes brother.

972
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,578
- Come with our guys.

973
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,580
- Brother!!

974
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:53,545
<i>- Sew?!?</i>

975
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:56,341
What happened?

976
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:58,774
A guy slapped daddy!

977
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:20,305
Break the hands of the guy
who slapped your uncle.

978
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:46,105
Who are you?

979
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,847
Who is the guy who
slapped my uncle?

980
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:04,444
Who is it?

981
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:12,047
Who is it?

982
01:14:14,134 --> 01:14:16,114
It's me!

983
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:19,874
What can you do?

984
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:05,347
How dare you!

985
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,471
How dare you slap my uncle!

986
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:41,311
Are you instigating someone to hit?

987
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:43,504
And you thought no
one would question?

988
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,778
I am there!

989
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,947
You thought no one would come?
I will come!

990
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:53,408
You waster! Just because we are
recluse did you think we are scared?

991
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,647
This village is our birthplace.

992
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,471
This temple is our ancestral god!

993
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:01,205
We will show you that
we are everything here!

994
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:05,014
I heard that you are a
big shot in Pollachi.

995
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:08,047
The day you enter pollachi

996
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:11,713
...I'll break your hands
in front of 5000 people

997
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:35,338
Brother, we have been searching for this
guy. He is the one who hit our guys!

998
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:22,778
Our guys are here.
Shall we finish him now?

999
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:25,508
Who is he?
From where did he come?

1000
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,013
I have a doubt whether he came for
his uncle or searching for us

1001
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,511
Don't pull words out of my mouth!

1002
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,971
He is just a guy who came
to watch a movie

1003
01:17:34,034 --> 01:17:36,105
and on seeing a cop being
attacked, he retaliated

1004
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:39,574
You wasted your time
thinking it was planned

1005
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:44,205
We have to do something, that he
will be scared all through his life

1006
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,541
Let's wait for the right
time to get rid of him

1007
01:17:50,034 --> 01:17:53,413
He slippered me inside the temple.

1008
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:55,441
I cursed him vehemently

1009
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:58,938
We were guilty of pulling an
honorable family into this

1010
01:17:59,534 --> 01:18:00,774
Now we are at peace

1011
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:04,274
Uncle, I am leaving.

1012
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,145
Am leaving aunty
- Vasu..

1013
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,910
Mom. Am leaving mom.

1014
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,443
- Mom. What happened?
- Don't go Vasu.

1015
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,133
- Mom. Don't cry.

1016
01:18:29,134 --> 01:18:30,670
- Don't leave me and go.
- Selvi, mom.

1017
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,976
- Tell her that you'll stay.

1018
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:37,808
- Don't go.
- Ok mom. I'll stay.

1019
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,808
I'll stay with you mom.

1020
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:42,579
You should stay here

1021
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,479
Don't go!

1022
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:50,408
Increase the volume.

1023
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,280
The sun is scorching!

1024
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,707
Ticket.. Ticket..

1025
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,207
Being a conductor should you get atop
a running bus? If you slip and die..

1026
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,945
...who will take care of
your wife and children?

1027
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:04,911
That driver will take care.
First buy your tickets

1028
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,302
Two half tickets to Sethumada.

1029
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:09,605
You buffalds are 1/2 tickets?

1030
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,442
Will you ask any less
if I look like a calf?

1031
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,610
People sitting cosily inside and
watching videos need to buy full tickets.

1032
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:16,844
...we are scorching in this sun
here, should we?

1033
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:18,603
Bend over. A tree brother!

1034
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,442
Where????

1035
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,813
- Conductor.. Conductor.. Stop the bus!
- Stop the bus or I'll break the glasses!

1036
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,880
It is said that people will be hanged from
above if they charge high interest rates

1037
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:31,537
- Who has said that?
- That's me

1038
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:32,304
I'll slipper you

1039
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,710
There, the NNL bus is coming back.
Justjump onto it.

1040
01:19:35,934 --> 01:19:37,470
- How will I jump?
- Don't waste time talking

1041
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:38,702
- Save me
- A new dhothi for diwali

1042
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,404
That son of a @#$ took my dhothi!

1043
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,776
- You could've jumped onto the bus.
- You should've stopped the bus.

1044
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,276
- Fool! I forgot that !
- Don't disrespect me!

1045
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:49,845
There's a funeral procession

1046
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,004
Betterjump on to that van and come.
I'll wait for you at the grave yard.

1047
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,575
Fatty fatty.. Save me!

1048
01:19:56,234 --> 01:20:00,182
Kuttipuli. This is your only chance.

1049
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,578
Oh my God!! Ghost!!!

1050
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,304
I'm no ghost.
I am not dead yet!

1051
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:07,799
Then why are you lying here?

1052
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,747
My children
are trying to kill me for my wealth

1053
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:13,379
I acted as though I am dead.
That's why they are taking me.

1054
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,241
All your children are crying their lungs
out and you are talking ill of them!

1055
01:20:17,634 --> 01:20:20,444
Just listen to what my sons and
daughter in law's are saying.

1056
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:24,243
You keep that 4.5 acres of coconut farm

1057
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:26,137
You keep that 5.5 acres of mango farm

1058
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:29,605
You use that 20 sovereign chain

1059
01:20:29,934 --> 01:20:32,414
You use that diamond necklace.
- Oh my god!

1060
01:20:33,134 --> 01:20:35,705
I'll register half my
properties in your name.

1061
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,145
Please save me.

1062
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:40,743
There is a branch of a banyan.
We'll escape using that.

1063
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:46,881
Catch hold of me. Now!
- Super!

1064
01:20:48,434 --> 01:20:50,277
Monkey! Loosen your legs!

1065
01:20:52,134 --> 01:20:53,738
They've seen us. Lets run!

1066
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,607
Look at our father running away.

1067
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,372
Catch hold of the guy who
saved our father first!

1068
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,370
- Save me all my property is yours

1069
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:01,004
I don't need any just give me your dhothi!

1070
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:02,703
Catch me if you can!

1071
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:05,070
Stop! Stop!!

1072
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:07,611
Son of a tyre! Why do you ram the brakes!

1073
01:21:07,934 --> 01:21:08,912
This is Vasu's house

1074
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,180
Lazy fellow! Did it take so long
for you to come from coimbatore?

1075
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,607
Did you come in bus or
a funeral procession?

1076
01:21:15,734 --> 01:21:18,214
- How did you find? -So you guys really
came in a funeral procession? -Yes

1077
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:22,782
That's why it is stinking so bad!
Go and get ready for temple

1078
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:43,078
- Welcome! Welcome!
- Greetings!

1079
01:21:44,134 --> 01:21:45,112
We were awaiting you

1080
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,814
Kindly sign the register

1081
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:25,112
Look there brother

1082
01:22:26,034 --> 01:22:28,571
He is always like this!

1083
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:33,080
Shall I print your names in the
invitation for the temple pooja?

1084
01:22:33,234 --> 01:22:35,111
Please don't use my name
henceforth in invitation.

1085
01:22:36,267 --> 01:22:38,247
Print my son's name.

1086
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,772
- Hi Divya!- With your mom now,
you've totally forgotten to call me

1087
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:46,603
As I thought you must be
asleep I didn't call.

1088
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:48,403
I am not getting any sleep
after falling in love.

1089
01:22:48,634 --> 01:22:50,580
- Tell me where your native is.
- Why?

1090
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,005
I've already crossed Pollachi,
tell me your address.

1091
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,178
Pollac:hi??

1092
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,346
Kuttipuli! Let's put a check post
at the entrance to Sethumada.

1093
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,371
Stop! Stop!

1094
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:02,508
- Where are you taking me?

1095
01:23:02,634 --> 01:23:04,511
- Get in the car. Somebody might spot us!
- So what?

1096
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:07,014
Where are you hijacking me?

1097
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:12,966
Thank God! We are safe now!

1098
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:16,141
Why have you brought me here
instead of taking me home?

1099
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,281
I cannot take you there!

1100
01:23:18,634 --> 01:23:20,807
I introduced my parents to you.
So you too should.

1101
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,480
Super. You're right sister.

1102
01:23:24,234 --> 01:23:25,474
Hey! When did you get in the car?

1103
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,603
You have brought a girl to a lonely place..

1104
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:30,939
.If any untoward incident happens
who will answer you parents?

1105
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:32,407
He told me to come saying the same!

1106
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,304
You too? You boiled egg!

1107
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,210
He told me to accompany
him to protect sister!

1108
01:23:36,567 --> 01:23:41,209
- Don't you have any manners to leave
us in privacy? - Leave it Vasu!

1109
01:23:41,367 --> 01:23:46,840
I fixed a bet with him saying that Divya is a
good girl and nothing naughty will happen.

1110
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,073
And I won 1O bucks.

1111
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,904
You used to be furious on Divya..
Now you are showering affection!

1112
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:55,272
- I've adopted Divya as my U P sister!
- U P sister?

1113
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:57,068
'Udan Pirava' Sister!

1114
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,075
- K P brother!!
- K P?

1115
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,511
- Kutti Puli brother!
- I thought something else!

1116
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,547
K P brother!

1117
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,580
I must not find you guys in Pollachi.

1118
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,580
Vasu. After I proposed
you came off to pollachi

1119
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,414
I really miss you

1120
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:24,973
A job after one year.
Marriage after 4 years.

1121
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:28,740
These were my ambitions. Now
everything has collapsed.

1122
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:29,872
- So much love?

1123
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,076
You are not so handsome. You are rough!

1124
01:24:34,401 --> 01:24:37,507
- But why did I fall in love with you!
- What's this?

1125
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:42,513
Aren't you a ruffian? You bash up
everyone if you lose your temper!

1126
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,809
Take me around the world in your arms

1127
01:25:16,034 --> 01:25:19,743
Let's walk the world one step at a time

1128
01:25:19,934 --> 01:25:23,643
With no space between us

1129
01:25:23,934 --> 01:25:27,575
Wrap me around you when we walk the world

1130
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:31,576
Touch me and I'll leave you not

1131
01:25:31,734 --> 01:25:35,443
Neither will I blow a kiss when you want

1132
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:39,310
You naughty girl

1133
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:43,313
The lullaby only starts now

1134
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:51,374
The beauty has fallen for the beast That rides
the mighty horse to snatch the angel away

1135
01:25:52,534 --> 01:25:59,474
The beauty that is blessed by godly powers
ls snatched in a wink

1136
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:03,614
I will not leave you my life!

1137
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:07,279
I will not let you leave me!

1138
01:26:27,734 --> 01:26:31,682
I'll handle you like a smart phone

1139
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:35,213
And will touch your screens sensitively

1140
01:26:35,867 --> 01:26:43,251
I'll follow you in Facebook
And will like you as no one did

1141
01:26:44,234 --> 01:26:51,675
My heart is a computer
And your love has infected it with virus

1142
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,645
I was a roaring lion that
has fallen to your love

1143
01:26:56,267 --> 01:26:59,680
And left all its glory for ever

1144
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,204
lam not leaving you away in my life

1145
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,210
lam no reason to raise for the day

1146
01:27:07,567 --> 01:27:14,917
I've nothing to do but to love you all day

1147
01:27:17,401 --> 01:27:23,511
The beauty has fallen for the beast That rides
the mighty horse to snatch the angel away

1148
01:27:24,334 --> 01:27:31,274
The beauty that is blessed by godly powers
ls snatched in a wink

1149
01:28:03,834 --> 01:28:07,247
lam going to an uninhabited land

1150
01:28:07,534 --> 01:28:11,141
With only you as my protection

1151
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:15,012
lam going to an island with no air

1152
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:19,009
With only you to breathe with

1153
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:23,746
I feel elated like a new born child

1154
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:27,643
Hold me closer

1155
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:35,476
The moment I snapped you through my eyes
I knew you were swept off your feet

1156
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:16,147
Vasu, Why so many vehicles
are heading this way?

1157
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:25,714
- Divya. Do you know to drive this car?
- Yeah

1158
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:30,115
- Take this. Leave now. -Why? -Listen
to me and leave from here now.

1159
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:42,781
- He is at the Aliyar dam brother

1160
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:45,743
- What are you saying?
- You start immediately and come here.

1161
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:50,044
Divya.

1162
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:55,212
Move! move!

1163
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:57,070
Get in the car. Get in

1164
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:02,466
Who are these men?

1165
01:30:02,467 --> 01:30:03,741
I'll tell it later

1166
01:30:10,234 --> 01:30:12,976
Don't leave him. Chase him!
- You are done!

1167
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,507
Brother. He made us walk 4 kms.

1168
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:21,035
Vasu brother's vehicle is coming.

1169
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:24,008
His guilt of having slapped
his friend does not make

1170
01:30:24,067 --> 01:30:26,707
him enjoy his love mood and so
he is coming to pick us up!

1171
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,503
I'll show off a little. Make him beg.

1172
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,636
Someone is chasing Vasu car.

1173
01:30:32,034 --> 01:30:33,308
Stop! Stop!

1174
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:39,714
- Drive fast!
- Don't hit!

1175
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:43,274
- We are chasing him.
- Where are you now?

1176
01:30:44,734 --> 01:30:45,678
Vasu!

1177
01:30:58,134 --> 01:30:59,636
You come the other
way, we'll catch him

1178
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,614
- Take right!! right!
- Take left! left!

1179
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,973
- How should I go now?
- Fly off

1180
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:22,080
Oh my! he is indeed flying!

1181
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:25,381
Brother. You wanted the auto to fly.
But it's floating.

1182
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:28,445
Vasu they are nearing!

1183
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:49,845
Block him!

1184
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,438
- Vasu there!
- Catch him! Catch him!

1185
01:32:07,867 --> 01:32:08,845
Overtake him!

1186
01:32:17,234 --> 01:32:18,542
Vasu this is too fast!

1187
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:24,669
- Get down. Get down fast!
- Why?

1188
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:28,166
You stay in the Police Station. Take a
bus to Coimbatore. That's safe for you.

1189
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:30,511
- What about my car?
- It'll reach your place

1190
01:32:31,867 --> 01:32:32,811
Go that way.

1191
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:36,714
I'll come by bus from Pollachi.

1192
01:32:36,967 --> 01:32:39,675
- You pick me up from Ukkadam bus stand.
- What about your car?

1193
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:47,547
He is not inside the car. Find him.

1194
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,639
- Where is the guy who came in that car?
- Don't know

1195
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,503
- Where is the guy who came in that car?
- I didn't see

1196
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:57,143
- We've enquired everywhere. No one
knows a thing! - Take your tea

1197
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,102
Who ordered it?
- There. That brother!

1198
01:33:14,901 --> 01:33:17,677
So finally you've got
yourself caught alone!

1199
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:20,010
It's not me who got caught. It's you!

1200
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:23,772
Didn't I tell you that I'll hit you
when you come to Pollachi? Come now!

1201
01:33:24,134 --> 01:33:26,808
You've come to my place and... Chop him!

1202
01:33:38,667 --> 01:33:41,113
Your guy is a brave fellow isn't it?
Then why did he run away?

1203
01:33:41,467 --> 01:33:43,447
Stop making fun. Just come to Ukkadam.

1204
01:33:59,534 --> 01:34:01,514
Hello! Please stop!

1205
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,778
Tell me.

1206
01:34:47,834 --> 01:34:50,799
You said that Vasu is scared isn't it?
I've sent you a video.

1207
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,905
Just see the way he is hitting!

1208
01:35:12,267 --> 01:35:14,247
Are you thinking why
I've spared your hand now?

1209
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:19,510
You are now a corpse! I am not dumb
to break the hand of a corpse!

1210
01:35:28,901 --> 01:35:30,505
See my real hero

1211
01:35:33,601 --> 01:35:36,480
Careful. Careful. Gently. Take him!

1212
01:35:38,701 --> 01:35:42,148
You are now a corpse! Corpse! Corpse!

1213
01:35:47,434 --> 01:35:50,608
Mr. Annathandavam, the
owner of Annam finance,

01:35:50,767 --> 01:35:53,839
has been beaten up by a guy.
The video has gone viral.

1215

01:36:09,034 --> 01:36:12,607
- Has this guy been arrested?
- There are no complaints yet!

1217
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:15,047
No complaints??

1218
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:16,678
Let's move.

1219
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,005
- What's he doing?
- Sleeping after getting treatment.

1220
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:26,680
Let him sleep. The whole world is
watching the way he got beaten up.

1221
01:36:27,067 --> 01:36:31,345
Someone has uploaded a video in youtube

1222
01:36:31,867 --> 01:36:33,574
Give that

1223
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,977

1226
01:36:41,867 --> 01:36:44,040
We need to know the password

1227
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:46,572
It's put as "See my real hero"

1228
01:36:47,267 --> 01:36:49,247
The one who has uploaded might be a girl.

1229
01:36:49,767 --> 01:36:53,408
I'll find her address using the
IP address in half an hour

1230
01:36:54,134 --> 01:36:56,273
Don't leave her.

1231
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:28,547
Isn't it you who is in this video?

1232
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:42,747
I've been searching for you all these days.

1233
01:37:43,367 --> 01:37:45,870
Though I am in no way related to you..

1234
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:49,181
...you did not think of anything and
saved my life from those 10 goons.

1235
01:37:51,001 --> 01:37:51,979
You are really great.

1236
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:56,605
I never bothered about my life when I
joined the force during my early days

1237
01:37:59,067 --> 01:38:00,045
But after marriage"

1238
01:38:01,067 --> 01:38:04,674
I realised that I can loose
anything for this job, but my life!

1239
01:38:06,234 --> 01:38:07,508
I do not have any children

1240
01:38:08,534 --> 01:38:09,512
My wife is my everything.

1241
01:38:10,867 --> 01:38:12,403
You've not only saved my life..

1242
01:38:13,601 --> 01:38:15,581
But also my wife from becoming an orphan.
- Sir

1243
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:21,040
What's the problem between
you and Annathandavam?

1244
01:38:33,367 --> 01:38:35,347
Kesavan.

1245
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:37,311
Write a complaint as I say.

1246
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,309
I, Vasudevan from Coimbatore
district, Sethumadai village,

1247
01:38:41,767 --> 01:38:46,876
was attacked by Mr. K.Annathandavam
and his men, in an attempt to murder.

1248
01:38:47,067 --> 01:38:51,345
To protect myself, I had no
choice but to attack them.

1249
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:56,271
I request you to kindly take
appropriate action against them.

1250
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:12,013
- Hi Vasu.
- Yesterday, did you take a video of mine?

1251
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,508
Yes. How did you know that?

1252
01:39:13,801 --> 01:39:15,109
You've uploaded in youtube!

1253
01:39:15,501 --> 01:39:16,775
I didn't upload

1254
01:39:17,134 --> 01:39:18,112
Did it get uploaded on its own?

1255
01:39:18,467 --> 01:39:19,445
Do you think I am a child?

1256
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:22,645
- Then how did it get uploaded?
- I sent it to Ramya

1257
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:24,978
May be she might have uploaded it

1258
01:39:25,467 --> 01:39:28,243
I'll immediately make a conference
call to her. Just wait on the line.

1259
01:39:31,634 --> 01:39:32,612
Whom do you want?

1260
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:36,912
Who are you?

1261
01:39:41,034 --> 01:39:44,481
Tell me. if you have a camera in
your mobile, will you take videos?

1262
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:48,274
I didn't take that video. It
was taken by my friend Divya.

1263
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,833
First, get the password from that girl.

1264
01:39:50,834 --> 01:39:52,711
She has only uploaded
the video in youtube.

1265
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:55,313
It was shot by his lover.
We'll abduct her now!

1266
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:58,411
Leave your house immediately. Take your
parents along to Meridian hotel.

1267
01:39:58,634 --> 01:40:00,545
- Hey!
- Just do what I say.

1268
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:12,445
- You came so fast from Pollachi.
Did you take a flight?- Hello sir.

1269
01:40:13,434 --> 01:40:15,038
Understand the situation.

1270
01:40:15,934 --> 01:40:20,212
It's better not to stay in your house. Please
stay in my friend's house for some 4 days.

1271
01:40:21,267 --> 01:40:23,770
- Lets go.- Vasu. I am very
happy to give you my daughter.

1272
01:40:24,767 --> 01:40:25,370
Thank you sir. Please leave immediately.

1273
01:40:29,334 --> 01:40:30,813
- Can we go?
- I am sorry Vasu.

1274
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:33,770
I am creating lot of
problems for you.

1275
01:40:37,634 --> 01:40:43,084
Oh my love

1276
01:40:44,767 --> 01:40:50,547
Even if the whole world is against us
I'll face them for you

1277
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:58,977
Keep your worries aside

01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:20,146
Oh my love

1281
01:41:21,267 --> 01:41:27,309
Even if the whole world is against us
I'll face them for you

1282
01:41:40,501 --> 01:41:42,481
They've found this place.
Let's go to my house.

1283
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:49,843
I was mesmerized the moment I saw you
I hug you with my sight

1284
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,506
I'll stay with you for eternity

1285
01:41:59,134 --> 01:42:04,948

'Patna - Bihar'

1289
01:42:43,201 --> 01:42:44,179
What happened son?

1290
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:50,969
Mom. Look at this video

1291
01:43:13,634 --> 01:43:17,548
How did you get the guts to shoot the
video when our brother was fighting?

1292
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,706
This is nothing. One day,
he was fighting with 10

1293
01:43:20,767 --> 01:43:23,247
biharis at a theatre. You
should've seen that.

1294
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,604
How long have you been
friends with our brother?

1295
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,546
Friends? We are in love!

1296
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:30,803
- It's over!
- Our brother will not fall in love.

1297
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,571
- No no. The king has to be there
and the queen should be here.

1298
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:35,748
Love? Vasu? No way!

1299
01:43:36,034 --> 01:43:38,480
- He is a rough guy! He'll not
fall in love! - No aunty!

1300
01:43:39,634 --> 01:43:43,810
Vasu is here. I'll make him say that
we are in love! You all go and hide.

1301
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,843
- Pandi?
- Hi Vasu.

1302
01:43:47,834 --> 01:43:49,711
- Hi.
- I have to ask you something.

1303
01:43:49,801 --> 01:43:53,408
- Go on ask.- How long have we
been in love? Do you remember?

1304
01:43:53,734 --> 01:43:56,180
- He is caught now!

1305
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:01,145
Oh ho!

1306
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:06,180
Are we in love? What's this divya?
I didn't expect this from you!

1307
01:44:07,067 --> 01:44:09,047
How did the tree of love
grow in your heart?

1308
01:44:09,967 --> 01:44:13,005
- We can sell a brinjal in the market.
But can we sell love?

1309
01:44:13,567 --> 01:44:14,545
What are you talking?

1310
01:44:14,634 --> 01:44:19,674
- Thank God. Nobody heard you.
Had they, it would be a disgrace

1311
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,005
Disgrace?

1312
01:44:23,234 --> 01:44:26,613
What does he mean by disgrace?

1313
01:44:27,401 --> 01:44:30,780
- Forgive me Divya. I can't fall in love
without out aunties consent.- Vasu!

1314
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:35,438
Don't we know about our brother?

1315
01:44:36,034 --> 01:44:36,978
Oh you all were here is it?

1316
01:44:37,634 --> 01:44:39,511
Selvi. You also were here is it?

1317
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,346
Didn't I tell you that Vasu
is not that kind of a guy!

1318
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:48,514
Rightly said aunty! Though she playfully
says that she loves me, if I say no..

1319
01:44:48,734 --> 01:44:50,714
...won't she feel hurt

1320
01:44:51,467 --> 01:44:52,445
What can we do for that?

1321
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,474
Tell 'I love you" to aunty

1322
01:44:55,734 --> 01:44:56,712
I love you aunty!

1323
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,477
- No No. I love him aunty.
- Oh

1324
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,766
- See. Aunty has given her consent.

1325
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:05,802
When did I?

1326
01:45:06,234 --> 01:45:08,942
- When did mom give her consent?
- See. Sister has also given her consent.

1327
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:09,535
When did I?

1328
01:45:10,467 --> 01:45:12,276
$0.. I love you.

1329
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,211
- Go. Leave. keep moving.

1330
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,777
- He'll get caught if she stays!

1331
01:45:20,067 --> 01:45:22,047
Aunty.Why do you look so dull?

1332
01:45:22,367 --> 01:45:23,641
But Divya is happy!

1333
01:45:25,834 --> 01:45:27,609
See you! See you! Bye. You come!

1334
01:45:41,567 --> 01:45:43,547
ADSP Sivakozhundhu is here

1335
01:45:44,267 --> 01:45:47,043
Why did he come to meet
me without my permission?

1336
01:45:47,334 --> 01:45:50,713
I didn't come to give you apple and
horlicks and enquire about your health!

1337
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:55,246
Did you try to murder a guy
4 days ago at Pollachi?

1338
01:45:56,501 --> 01:45:58,481
What's the grudge between you both?

1339
01:45:58,667 --> 01:45:59,941
Did you take cash?

1340
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:02,437
Did they bribe you with clothes?

1341
01:46:02,934 --> 01:46:04,914
He has thrashed me

1342
01:46:05,267 --> 01:46:08,339
...in front of 5000 people and 5 lakh
people have seen the video. But you...

1343
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:12,779
Then why the f@#$ have you
not registered a complaint?

1344
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:16,514
- You decided to settle scores personally??
- As per IPC section...

1345
01:46:18,767 --> 01:46:20,303
I'll thrash you!

1346
01:46:21,867 --> 01:46:24,643
If anything happens to that guy...

1347
01:46:28,334 --> 01:46:30,211
You asked me if he had
given any cash, isn't it?

1348
01:46:31,067 --> 01:46:33,047
He gave me life!

1349
01:46:38,933 --> 01:46:41,106
Brother. Doctor says that
you can go home if required.

1350
01:46:41,167 --> 01:46:43,807
Are you asking me to stay at
home and eat what my wife cooks?

1351
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,374
She'll spit on me!

1352
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:49,414
Until one head rolls"

1353
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,604
...I'll stay here only!

1354
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:55,847
- Brother. Master didn't call you.
- OK

1355
01:46:57,034 --> 01:46:58,877
- Sir. Did you call me?
- No!

1356
01:46:59,334 --> 01:47:01,211
- Pandi told me that you called.
- Get lost!

1357
01:47:02,434 --> 01:47:05,472
- Master said that he didn't call me.
- I also told you the same!

1358
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,543
Why did you tell me then?

1359
01:47:09,867 --> 01:47:11,175
If he didn't call you, then
I have to tell you only!

1360
01:47:11,768 --> 01:47:15,477
What's your age! What's my age!
Why do you mock me!

1361
01:47:16,001 --> 01:47:20,313
Just because you eat a pot full
of rice, will you say anything?

1362
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:23,772
- I'll hit you also!
- Do you have any sense?

1363
01:47:24,834 --> 01:47:27,644
- Why are you hitting this child?
- I'll tell you.

1364
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:30,347
I told him that Master didn't call
him and he is hitting me for that.

1365
01:47:30,401 --> 01:47:32,176
- Did Master call him?
- No

1366
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,378
Did you hit him for that?

1367
01:47:33,467 --> 01:47:34,445
Why is he telling me that?

1368
01:47:34,834 --> 01:47:36,336
- If Master calls you whom
should he inform?- To me

1369
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,344
- If he doesn't call you, whom
should he inform?- To me!

1370
01:47:38,767 --> 01:47:40,303
- You should be informed!
- Why should I be informed?

1371
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,242
Senseless fellows. if you keep fighting like
this how will India become a superpower?

1372
01:47:48,001 --> 01:47:49,275
How will India become a super power?

1373
01:47:49,634 --> 01:47:51,580
Will bomb us!

1374
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:53,806
Will occupy us!

1375
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:57,479
From mobile phones to everything,
they will dominate here

1376
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,581
Senseless fellows. Read the paper
and increase your knowledge!

1377
01:48:02,634 --> 01:48:04,773
When will India become a superpower?

1378
01:48:06,267 --> 01:48:09,305
What's the relation between hitting this
blacky and India becoming a super power!

1379
01:48:09,767 --> 01:48:12,543
I tell you now also. I swear
that Master didn't call you!

1380
01:48:12,734 --> 01:48:15,214
You!! It's all because of you that
some idiots are advising me!

1381
01:48:15,701 --> 01:48:17,908
- Just listen to us.
- Did anyone disturb you?

1382
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:20,241
I stayed here just because Vasu said.

1383
01:48:20,767 --> 01:48:22,542
How long can we stay in
someone else's house?

1384
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,036
You all go inside. I will deal with him.

1385
01:48:25,567 --> 01:48:26,545
Sir. Any problem?

1386
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:29,147
- I am angry!
- I will feed you Jangri!

1387
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,945
Hey Small Tiger! he is just like a
computer. He gets corrupted at times.

1388
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:35,147
An anti virus will solve the issue.

1389
01:48:35,667 --> 01:48:38,113
- Ok. Then take him. -Come -Go.
Go and install anti virus

1390
01:48:40,134 --> 01:48:41,112
- Did you mean anything else?

1391
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:43,405
- I meant only one thing.
- I'll thrash you!

1392
01:48:49,367 --> 01:48:51,244
- Hey Divya! What happened?
- I slipped.

1393
01:48:51,867 --> 01:48:54,006
- I hurt my leg.-Where?
- Wait!

1394
01:48:54,601 --> 01:48:58,048
- I can't show it to you here. -Take me to
the room, I'll show you there. -Oh my!

1395
01:48:58,868 --> 01:49:01,348
- You were bold enough to
lift me in front of my mom!

1396
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:03,375
Anti+Virus

1397
01:49:04,067 --> 01:49:05,637
Anti virus!

1398
01:49:05,767 --> 01:49:09,476
Oh my! He is taking her like a butcher
taking a calf! If someone sees...

1399
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:12,241
He has seen!!

1400
01:49:12,834 --> 01:49:14,142
My daughter! Someones taking her!

1401
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,576
- Nobody is taking your daughter.
- I saw her in a green dress.

1402
01:49:18,834 --> 01:49:20,814
Green... Green...

1403
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,313
- Sir. It's our Pandi! He was carrying
a green pillow.- Don't fool me!

1404
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:29,370
You don't trust me?

1405
01:49:29,567 --> 01:49:31,513
Hey Pandi

1406
01:49:31,567 --> 01:49:32,739
Yes brother!

1407
01:49:32,801 --> 01:49:37,375
- Where are you going?
- I am going to the bathroom to sleep!

1408
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:40,107
The guy who I saw was tall.
This guy is short!

1409
01:49:40,634 --> 01:49:43,114
Sir. Do you have long sight or short sight?

1410
01:49:43,467 --> 01:49:45,105
- Short sight!
- That's why it appears short to you!

1411
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:50,678
Be careful!

1412
01:49:52,334 --> 01:49:55,713
He is doing business in share market
and talks like a fish market guy.

1413
01:49:58,901 --> 01:49:59,936
Why are you closing the door?

1414
01:50:03,134 --> 01:50:04,112
Come here!

1415
01:50:06,134 --> 01:50:08,944
Shall I show where I got hurt?

1416
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,076
For just going inside that room,
they sent us away for 4 years.

1417
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,780
If Madam Rajalakshmi comes to know of this,

1418
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,802
...they would send us away for 40 years!

1419
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,002
Then we can come back only as old men!

1420
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:22,307
- Don't develop this habit of asking
me to lift you often!- Vasul!

1421
01:50:28,134 --> 01:50:30,600
What happened?
What?

1422
01:50:30,601 --> 01:50:32,774
- Why?- Why are you lifting a
girl and going in broad daylight?

1423
01:50:33,567 --> 01:50:35,171
- I didn't lift anyone!
- I saw myself!

1424
01:50:35,467 --> 01:50:38,846
- Your act of carrying a green baby inside!
- I was carrying a green pillow.

1425
01:50:42,034 --> 01:50:43,877
- Do you have long sight or short sight?

1426
01:50:45,934 --> 01:50:48,744
- I don't know!
- That's the problem. Go and check up!

1427
01:50:51,734 --> 01:50:53,645
Our guys are watching over
the town day and night!

1428
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,408
Not even a single guy is coming out!

1429
01:50:55,667 --> 01:50:57,566
It will be a big problem if
we finish him in his house!

1430
01:50:57,567 --> 01:51:00,047
His Uncle Ramasamy travels
to his office sometimes

1431
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:04,547
- So, what if we plan for a truck to hit
him? - It will only be an accident..

1432
01:51:04,834 --> 01:51:05,869
- Nothing will happen to anyone!

1433
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,736
Because all his cars are high end ones!

1434
01:51:08,134 --> 01:51:10,580
Then how the f@#$ are we going to plan?

1435
01:51:10,834 --> 01:51:14,213
A place which they would least expect
and a place easy for us to operate..

1436
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:17,380
- Tell me which place is that?
- Kovai textiles

1437
01:51:20,167 --> 01:51:22,147
- A 1000 people will be present inside!

1438
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:23,445
That's more helpful for us.

1439
01:51:23,801 --> 01:51:26,247
- Tell me in detail.
I've spoken to Muthuvel.

1440
01:51:29,067 --> 01:51:30,045
He said he'll do it for us!

1441
01:51:31,134 --> 01:51:34,581
If he gets caught he is ready to
take the blame and get imprisoned.

1442
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,504
He is ready with a gang of experienced
12 biharis and 2 keralites

1443
01:51:39,367 --> 01:51:41,005
He said he'll send them
inside as temporary staff

1444
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:43,375
He expecfs a huge sum!

1445
01:51:43,634 --> 01:51:45,238
But he will not miss, right?

1446
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,278
Definitely not!

1447
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:50,811
We'll finish him!

1448
01:51:51,668 --> 01:51:53,204
I'll slipper you if your hand comes here!

1449
01:51:53,301 --> 01:51:53,972
Why are you spoiling
Vasu brother?

1450
01:51:54,067 --> 01:51:55,341
Come guru driver!

1451
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,806
- Shall I call you as Screw driver
in english?- He has started!

1452
01:51:59,534 --> 01:52:02,014
- Do you drink? Do you smoke?
- No

1453
01:52:04,067 --> 01:52:06,047
Do you have saree and
chudidhar business?

1454
01:52:06,367 --> 01:52:09,712
- What does that mean? -I meant women!
- I am a disciplined family man!

1455
01:52:09,867 --> 01:52:11,403
Then why are you alive!

1456
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:13,470
Why is he sleeping with his eyes open?

1457
01:52:13,634 --> 01:52:16,547
- Let me do water service!

1458
01:52:16,834 --> 01:52:19,314
Now I'll make a mixture shop on his face!

1459
01:52:20,034 --> 01:52:24,039
What's this guy! I've been hitting
him and he's not responding!

1460
01:52:24,734 --> 01:52:26,941
You son of a... I'll thrash you!!

1461
01:52:30,501 --> 01:52:33,880
Vasu. Call him. He's trying something else!

1462
01:52:34,534 --> 01:52:36,980
Guru brother. Leave him!

1463
01:52:43,367 --> 01:52:45,540
How are you Guru brother?

1464
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:48,081
I can't see you these days!

1465
01:52:48,301 --> 01:52:50,281
Don't sleep in this fog.
Not good for health!

1466
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:53,977
Go sleep in your house. Your
wife will be searching for you!

1467
01:52:58,134 --> 01:53:00,239
- Who spat here?
- It's me!

1468
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,446
- It's not you! Don't I
know your bad breath!

1469
01:53:03,134 --> 01:53:04,112
Give me a peg.

1470
01:53:04,601 --> 01:53:07,081
By the time I finished the meeting
you all have finished a bottle!

1471
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:09,505
- Vasu..-What's it?
- Divya

1472
01:53:11,334 --> 01:53:12,312
Wait. I'll be back.

1473
01:53:13,934 --> 01:53:15,811
D hasn't slept yet?

1474
01:53:15,967 --> 01:53:18,777
I heard some noise here. So
I guessed you'll be here.

1475
01:53:18,934 --> 01:53:22,245
They had brought the collection from
market. So I was talking to them.

1476
01:53:22,534 --> 01:53:24,138
Say that you have arranged a party!

1477
01:53:25,034 --> 01:53:28,140
- Do you drink everyday?
- Twice a week

1478
01:53:28,467 --> 01:53:30,413
- How many cigarettes do you smoke everyday?

1479
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:32,805
- A pack will last for two days

1480
01:53:33,734 --> 01:53:34,974
- Make me a promise

1481
01:53:35,167 --> 01:53:37,147
- That I should stop all these immediately?

1482
01:53:39,101 --> 01:53:43,982
- That you'll continue drinking and
smoking like this throughout!

1483
01:53:47,834 --> 01:53:50,872
You have bad habits but
you are within limits.

1484
01:53:52,067 --> 01:53:54,047
It's a problem only when
you cross these limits.

1485
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:57,278
Did I spoil your mood?

1486
01:53:59,367 --> 01:54:01,904
I felt like saying. Nothing else.

1487
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:04,771
Sorry! Good night!

1488
01:54:10,567 --> 01:54:13,013
Vasu.. Free advice?

1489
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:16,438
She feels that I should stop drinking.
But doesn't have the guts to tell it!

1490
01:54:18,334 --> 01:54:22,282
I would've laughed at her had
she told me to stop drinking

1491
01:54:23,867 --> 01:54:25,847
...but she told me in a different manner

1492
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,406
If it hurts this much to a girl whom
I've been in love since a month...

1493
01:54:30,801 --> 01:54:33,577
...how much hurting would it have
been to my mom all these years?

1494
01:54:35,967 --> 01:54:37,344
Unnecessary habit, isn't it?

1495
01:54:39,201 --> 01:54:41,681
No more! not any more!

1496
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:45,746
- Are not sleeping on the terrace? - Who
will sleep at a place where he is present

1497
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,880
<i>- I'll</i> sleep in the old house opposite.

1498
01:54:49,901 --> 01:54:52,711
Vasu...

1499
01:54:56,867 --> 01:55:01,179
<i>What happened to man“ Oh my god'.!</i>

1500
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,478
Wake up!

1501
01:55:26,934 --> 01:55:29,380
Vasu. Why CCTV cameras?

1502
01:55:29,701 --> 01:55:32,181
I thought it's better to
have them for safety.

1503
01:55:32,834 --> 01:55:34,370
Ok. I'll visit the factory and come.

1504
01:55:44,834 --> 01:55:47,906
- What happened uncle? - Selvi, ask
mom to bring some water to drink.

1505
01:55:48,801 --> 01:55:50,781
<i>- I'll</i> accompany you to the factory

1506
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,708
- Come in formal dress.
- Ok Uncle.

1507
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,648
- Don't you have water inside the car? - There
is. But I felt like drinking from home.

1508
01:56:12,201 --> 01:56:15,239
- Vasu. We'll also come with you.
- No need. You guys stay here.

1509
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,180
- Tell me.
- He has started from his house.

1510
01:56:31,434 --> 01:56:33,414
- Ask our guys to be ready
- OK

1511
01:56:37,501 --> 01:56:39,378
- ls there a change in plan?
- Why are you asking?

1512
01:56:39,467 --> 01:56:41,378
- Ramasamy's brother's son
is going inside the factory

1513
01:56:41,467 --> 01:56:44,277
- Tell me - Vasu is in the
factory.Shall I stop the plan

1514
01:56:44,534 --> 01:56:46,980
- Why are you receding? Isn't
the plan strong on our side?

1515
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,277
- Ask them to finish both.
- Ok brother.

1516
01:56:50,234 --> 01:56:52,737
- Brother. - Tell him that
I'll give him double payment.

1517
01:56:53,201 --> 01:56:55,078
- We'll see that later.
- Tell him immediately.

1518
01:56:55,767 --> 01:56:57,747
Only then will he be furious
in finishing them off!

1519
01:57:06,467 --> 01:57:07,707
Welcome our new MD!

1520
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:11,602
- Whats all this uncle!

1521
01:57:20,567 --> 01:57:23,309
This seat has been waiting
for the past 4 years!

1522
01:57:24,934 --> 01:57:27,710
- The company expects fresh energy from you.

1523
01:57:28,834 --> 01:57:32,475
Now it's your turn to make
the company much bigger.

1524
01:57:33,167 --> 01:57:35,647
<i>- I'll</i> be on rounds. Explain him everything.

- This is packing section.
German order is going on.

1529
01:57:55,067 --> 01:57:57,911
Why are some people sitting there?
Is it tea time?

1530
01:57:58,334 --> 01:57:59,312
Not at all.

1531
01:57:59,868 --> 01:58:01,176
Then why are they sitting outside?

1532
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:05,173
- Security sir.- Why are some
people sitting outside the godown?

1533
01:58:06,134 --> 01:58:07,704
- They are temporary employees from Bihar

1534
01:58:08,267 --> 01:58:10,247
They are temporary employees
from Bihar it seems.

1535
01:58:16,634 --> 01:58:18,170
Why is he sitting alone?

1536
01:58:19,334 --> 01:58:20,312
He is talking over the phone.

1537
01:58:20,801 --> 01:58:21,779
Don't know!

1538
01:58:49,134 --> 01:58:51,114
- Forgive me sir! -Who are you?
- Forgive me sir!

1539
01:58:55,034 --> 01:58:56,536
Which Department is he?

1540
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,610
- What happened? - We have arrested 6
people and sent 4 of them to hospital

1541
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:11,614
- No worker should leave the factory.
lam on my way.- Ok sir.

1542
02:01:19,734 --> 02:01:23,113
- All are temporary Bihari employees. -We
need their details <i>-I'll</i> ask to give them.

1543
02:01:30,234 --> 02:01:31,804
Hey..
Why have you...

1544
02:01:39,601 --> 02:01:41,205
You rotten dog!

1545
02:01:42,467 --> 02:01:44,674
Trying to kill my uncle
using contract killers?

1546
02:01:47,667 --> 02:01:49,544
I've sent them all to the hospital

1547
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:53,500
You'll be behind bars, if
they utter even a word.

1548
02:01:53,501 --> 02:01:56,675
In India, it does not matter
if they lock me up in any cell..

1549
02:01:57,101 --> 02:02:00,480
...I can wipe out your
family, if I have a cell.

1550
02:02:00,934 --> 02:02:02,277
Fight with me if you have guts!

1551
02:02:02,867 --> 02:02:04,403
I've come alone!

1552
02:02:04,867 --> 02:02:08,576
If you, born to a good
father have so much guts.

1553
02:02:09,167 --> 02:02:12,239
My grandpa is a loafer,
My father is scumbag

1554
02:02:12,667 --> 02:02:15,307
Being their descendant, how
much guts should I have?

1555
02:02:16,434 --> 02:02:19,574
I have a list of all your relatives
whom you even don't know!

1556
02:02:19,867 --> 02:02:22,871
In Dindigul, One of the brothers of
your aunt is doing Plantain business

1557
02:02:24,001 --> 02:02:27,414
One of your distant relative
in Palakkad runs a pharmacy

1558
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:30,708
Suddenly one day, he'll die in an accident

1559
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:33,509
You will feel the pain when you come
to know that I am the one behind it!

1560
02:02:34,567 --> 02:02:37,377
Henceforth, the headcount in your
family will decrease

1561
02:02:38,534 --> 02:02:42,482
Even after 10 years, I will bring upon
death on any of your family member

1562
02:02:43,134 --> 02:02:46,138
But you will live to mourn all these deaths

1563
02:02:46,901 --> 02:02:50,041
Are you God? Are you dreaming that
you can scare me of with these talks?

1564
02:02:51,234 --> 02:02:53,373
You will get people to kill
for you only if you pay them!

1565
02:02:53,767 --> 02:02:57,112
To slit throats on my sign and to kill
on a command, even I have people!

1566
02:02:58,401 --> 02:03:00,381
I've lived in all areas.

1567
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:03,381
Do you want to see?

1568
02:03:04,334 --> 02:03:05,312
I'll show you!

1569
02:03:12,767 --> 02:03:15,805
He has definitely used Contract
killers to attack my uncle.

1570
02:03:18,634 --> 02:03:20,841
There is no need for him
to pay contract killers.

1571
02:03:21,834 --> 02:03:23,939
Because, he is running the
business of contract killing.

1572
02:03:25,734 --> 02:03:27,611
He is a cold blooded contract killer.

1573
02:03:29,334 --> 02:03:31,405
The department has a strong doubt on
him based on intelligence reports

1574
02:03:31,734 --> 02:03:35,238
To investigate that, I was transferred
from Tirunelveli to Coimbatore.

1575
02:03:36,801 --> 02:03:40,180
I've been waiting for the right
moment to get hold of him

1576
02:03:40,701 --> 02:03:41,679
He doesn't seem to yield!

1577
02:03:43,334 --> 02:03:46,144
He might also be behind the goons who
planned to kill me at the theatre

1578
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,708
Can't you arrest him?

1579
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:50,347
He has indirect support from politicians

1580
02:03:51,334 --> 02:03:54,713
if we get him without proper witness, all
these politicians will trouble us.

1581
02:03:55,834 --> 02:03:58,041
- Anyone in your family
have a licensed gun?- No

1582
02:03:59,334 --> 02:04:00,312
Apply for one immediately.

1583
02:04:09,934 --> 02:04:10,912
Welcome madam.

1584
02:04:38,067 --> 02:04:39,045
It's Nothing!

1585
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:42,811
Why are you crying?
Nothing will happen.

1586
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,080
God will take care.

1587
02:04:47,267 --> 02:04:49,247
<i>Aunt“!</i>

1588
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,478
- Parvathy
- Madam.

1589
02:05:06,401 --> 02:05:08,608
- Make coffee for all the guests.
- Ok madam.

1590
02:05:10,301 --> 02:05:14,943
- Whats it dear?
- Sorry Aunty! It's my mistake

1591
02:05:16,467 --> 02:05:18,447
I shouldn't have hit him!

1592
02:05:19,834 --> 02:05:23,782
Had I been patient the other day, today
this wouldn't have happened to uncle.

1593
02:05:24,234 --> 02:05:26,214
Are you nuts?

1594
02:05:26,967 --> 02:05:30,380
Having been embarrassed, we didn't
have a clue of what to do...

1595
02:05:31,067 --> 02:05:33,809
...you saved the honor of our family.

1596
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:39,248
Only after you broke his
hand did we all eat peace

1597
02:05:41,034 --> 02:05:42,536
Don't think of unnecessary things!

1598
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,680
Be normal.

1599
02:05:49,567 --> 02:05:52,707
Mom knows about your love.

1600
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:54,839
Are you thinking how she came to know?

1601
02:05:55,234 --> 02:05:56,872
It was me who blabbered!

1602
02:05:57,934 --> 02:06:00,380
She is fine with it. But she
is not showing it!

1603
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,508
Annachi is here.

1604
02:06:10,334 --> 02:06:12,211
All the guys in the market are furious.

1605
02:06:12,467 --> 02:06:14,913
They are just waiting to hear from you.

1606
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,274
- Hey Kuttipuli.
- Sir

1607
02:06:17,201 --> 02:06:18,179
Who are these men?

1608
02:06:19,434 --> 02:06:22,210
- All are gangstersCome lets go inside.

1609
02:06:23,567 --> 02:06:25,547
Once upon a time, I was also a big gangster

1610
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:27,405
- Is it?
- Hmm

1611
02:06:28,234 --> 02:06:30,214
In which state were you a gangster?

1612
02:06:30,534 --> 02:06:34,846
When I was in my 6th grade, I had hit
many of my classmates with a ruler!

1613
02:06:35,534 --> 02:06:36,512
Jesus Christ!

1614
02:06:46,167 --> 02:06:48,738
- Welcome Bhai!
- What's it Bhai?

1615
02:06:49,434 --> 02:06:52,472
I read in the papers. I came here
upon hearing about your uncle.

1616
02:06:53,367 --> 02:06:55,472
Who is that Annathandavam?
What should be done to him?

1617
02:06:55,867 --> 02:06:58,143
Leave it bhai! It's a
problem within this area

1618
02:06:58,601 --> 02:07:00,706
We'll loose our respect if
we handle in a wrong way

1619
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,607
So? Won't I help if you have a problem?

1620
02:07:05,568 --> 02:07:08,606
We can go to any level. Understood?

1621
02:07:09,067 --> 02:07:10,045
I understand bhai!

1622
02:07:14,968 --> 02:07:17,448
Kotamedu bhai had visited Vasu's house.

1623
02:07:19,034 --> 02:07:21,207
- What's the relation between
bhai and Vasu?- No idea

1624
02:07:24,734 --> 02:07:26,338
I think he is getting scared.

1625
02:07:29,834 --> 02:07:31,939
Hey Fatty!

1626
02:07:32,967 --> 02:07:36,073
- Steal a fruit from the dinning table
- Ok brother

1627
02:07:36,567 --> 02:07:38,547
- Which fruit?
- Banana

1628
02:07:43,467 --> 02:07:45,447
- Here have it

1629
02:07:45,701 --> 02:07:47,666
- Whats this?
- Banana. You only asked for it

1630
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:50,443
- Where is the peel?
- You asked only for the fruit, right?

1631
02:07:50,734 --> 02:07:53,180
Don't I know to peel it off?

1632
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:56,547
If you want only the peel, I'll bring it.
Stuff it in your mouth!

1633
02:07:57,101 --> 02:08:01,413
- You son of a... Why are you playing
with my life? What did I do to you?

1634
02:08:02,167 --> 02:08:05,205
- Skin him out now!- Why are you hitting
a small child? What's your problem?

1635
02:08:05,601 --> 02:08:09,879
I asked him for a fruit. He peeled it
off and is giving me only the fruit.

1636
02:08:10,034 --> 02:08:11,604
- What did you ask for?
- I asked for a fruit

1637
02:08:11,767 --> 02:08:13,212
- Didn't he give you the fruit?
- Yes

1638
02:08:13,434 --> 02:08:15,744
- Will you eat the fruit or its peel?
- I eat the fruit..

1639
02:08:15,801 --> 02:08:16,506
- Look how he blinks!

1640
02:08:16,801 --> 02:08:18,007
Humans eat fruits.

1641
02:08:18,401 --> 02:08:19,709
Only cattle eat peels!

1642
02:08:19,834 --> 02:08:21,142
Are you human or cattle? Tell that first.

1643
02:08:21,367 --> 02:08:22,903
Crap. Can't imagine where he placed
his hands before touching the fruit!

1644
02:08:23,201 --> 02:08:25,078
The fruit is filled with dirt.
How will I eat it?

1645
02:08:25,167 --> 02:08:26,441
- Is dirt your problem?
- Yes! -Give it here.

1646
02:08:28,134 --> 02:08:29,943
Why do you clean it with the
cloth used to clean the car?

1647
02:08:30,167 --> 02:08:33,273
- You senseless fellow - This cloth
is used to clean a car worth 50lakhs

1648
02:08:33,834 --> 02:08:35,566
Why not clean a fruit worth only 5 bucks?

1649
02:08:35,567 --> 02:08:38,013
- I'll not eat if it is not clean.
- How much more cleaner do you want!

1650
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:39,775
- Hey come here!
- Whats he gonna do now?

1651
02:08:40,467 --> 02:08:42,447
You uncivilized!!
- Pour nicely.

1652
02:08:42,967 --> 02:08:44,503
- Do you have a soap?
- Oh my! Soap??

1653
02:08:45,467 --> 02:08:47,913
- Pour nicely..
- Oh my!!!

1654
02:08:49,567 --> 02:08:52,741
- Here it's clean now. Have it.
- I don't want it!

1655
02:08:53,401 --> 02:08:56,746
- All of us have been trying to
make you satisfied with the fruit

1656
02:08:57,167 --> 02:08:59,943
and finally when you say you don't want
it, should we leave you just like that?

1657
02:09:01,034 --> 02:09:03,810
- Catch hold of him!
- No no.. Just leave me please.

1658
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,808
I am going to Coimbatore.

1659
02:09:08,167 --> 02:09:10,044
- For what?
- I have to apply for weapon license

1660
02:09:11,567 --> 02:09:12,841
- Fine. Carry on.
- Ok mom

1661
02:09:13,168 --> 02:09:15,148
Vasu. You are going to
Coimbatore, isn't it?

1662
02:09:15,334 --> 02:09:18,679
Can you drop me at Codissia
hall for my friend's marriage?

1663
02:09:19,467 --> 02:09:22,243
- You take a separate car.- It's safe
for me if you come along with me.

1664
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,977
- Just listen to me
- Vasu

1665
02:09:24,668 --> 02:09:27,512
She says it's safe for her
if you take her, Take her!

1666
02:09:41,134 --> 02:09:43,341
Which friend's marriage is it?

1667
02:09:44,267 --> 02:09:46,144
- I was just kidding
- Kidding?

1668
02:09:47,201 --> 02:09:50,808
- You've kept me inside the house for a
week. Felt like going out with you.

1669
02:09:51,234 --> 02:09:54,044
That's why I draped a saree and lied
Your mom believed it!

1670
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:03,199
Had your mom known about
our relationship,

1671
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:05,202
She wouldn't have sent me
along with you, isn't it?

1672
02:10:05,401 --> 02:10:06,675
My knows everything.

1673
02:10:07,267 --> 02:10:08,211
- She knows??
- Yeah

1674
02:10:08,834 --> 02:10:10,780
She was like as though
she didn't know of it!

1675
02:10:13,167 --> 02:10:16,307
- Heard that you stopped smoking
and drinking, isn't it? - Hmmm

1676
02:10:17,401 --> 02:10:18,379
For me?

1677
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:23,771
Even without me compelling, you've stopped
You are great Vasu!

1678
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,608
Divya, you stay in the car.

1679
02:10:55,867 --> 02:10:57,847
I told you the other day,
that I saw the guy who...

1680
02:10:57,901 --> 02:10:59,847
...came to murder the SP at
the theatre, isn't it?

1681
02:11:00,134 --> 02:11:02,114
- I am now following him.
- What are you saying?

1682
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:09,772
- I am on Avinasi road. - You keep
following him, I'll be right behind you.

1683
02:11:15,401 --> 02:11:16,937
I've turned to Singanallur road.

1684
02:11:21,501 --> 02:11:23,481
I am now on the route to Palladam.

1685
02:11:31,667 --> 02:11:34,113
- He has got down at Kumaran Nagar.
- I am nearby

1686
02:11:36,234 --> 02:11:38,714
Don't be scared to follow him.
He doesn't know you!

1687
02:11:59,568 --> 02:12:01,548
- This fellow?
- Vasu, this is the guy!

1688
02:12:03,434 --> 02:12:04,708
- This is him!
- This girl??

1689
02:12:09,201 --> 02:12:10,509
Get him Vasu!

1690
02:12:53,601 --> 02:12:56,013
- They have arrested Sundaram.
- What are you saying?

1691
02:12:56,734 --> 02:12:58,270
- It was Vasu and SP who caught him.

1692
02:12:59,201 --> 02:13:01,181
- How did they come together?

1693
02:13:02,467 --> 02:13:05,175
- How does Vasu know Sundaram?
- It's confusing

1694
02:13:05,701 --> 02:13:08,910
- May be the police might have
gotten to know of our business

1695
02:13:09,467 --> 02:13:11,743
- Don't speculate unnecessarily.

1696
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,980
- They don't know it!

1697
02:13:15,501 --> 02:13:17,481
There is no possibility of knowing it!

1698
02:13:19,334 --> 02:13:21,314
- They must not know it!

1699
02:13:23,801 --> 02:13:25,144
-It's our lawyer.

1700
02:13:26,534 --> 02:13:29,276
- What's it? Is it about Sundaram's arrest?

1701
02:13:29,834 --> 02:13:32,872
- No. The ADSP is working to arrest you!

1702
02:13:51,867 --> 02:13:54,746
- Never pour salt water
- OK

1703
02:13:55,401 --> 02:13:57,881
- What are you doing?
- I am growing nails by pouring water

1704
02:13:58,901 --> 02:14:01,381
- How do nails grow by pouring water?
- Doesn't hair grow by pouring water?

1705
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:05,273
Don't plants grow by pouring water?
Nails will also grow similarly!

1706
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,377
- Am I a retard?
- Then, am I a retard?

1707
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:10,806
- Don't talk like a stupid!
- It's not paining!!

1708
02:14:11,201 --> 02:14:12,839
- What did you say now?
- I said its not paining!

1709
02:14:13,034 --> 02:14:14,843
- Then why do you react
as though it is aching?

1710
02:14:15,267 --> 02:14:17,110
- Guru brother!!! It's not paining!!
- Here I am!

1711
02:14:21,834 --> 02:14:22,778
- Why are you now gargling?

1712
02:14:23,167 --> 02:14:25,044
- Why are you hitting this child?

1713
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:29,412
- He was hitting me and I said it was
not aching. So he hit me again!

1714
02:14:30,834 --> 02:14:32,609
- Is it aching? -Yes!

1715
02:14:32,667 --> 02:14:36,012
If it's aching, one has to say it. If it is
not aching, then again one has to say that!

1716
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:40,878
Unity! It's because of our lack of unity..

1717
02:14:41,701 --> 02:14:45,672
...that it is scorching in Rajasthan
and freezing in Kashmir"

1718
02:14:46,401 --> 02:14:50,747
...its chill in Ooty and Kodaikanal and
you will feel the shock of electricity!

1719
02:14:52,134 --> 02:14:57,584
You rotten gutter rat! Ever since I came
here, you have been talking against me!

1720
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:02,348
Will you talk any more? Your mouth stinks!
You are advising me!

1721
02:15:04,734 --> 02:15:07,180
- This world doesn't accept the truth!
- No! I am not satisfied!

1722
02:15:07,934 --> 02:15:10,346
Do you have to tell me that
we cannot touch electricity?

1723
02:15:13,201 --> 02:15:16,648
No! This is not enough!

1724
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,205
- Who is the girl who identified Sundaram?

1725
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:21,702
- She is my fiancee

1726
02:15:22,034 --> 02:15:24,810
- Will she stay as a witness till
the end or...- She will definitely!

1727
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:48,580
What's the relationship
between you and Annathandavam?

1728
02:15:48,634 --> 02:15:52,599
Don't listen to the words of a kid
and relate me to some fellow!

1729
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:54,580
Then why did you come to Kaveri theatre?

1730
02:15:55,334 --> 02:15:57,314
To sell tickets illegally!

1731
02:15:59,067 --> 02:16:02,446
- I have guys in your department to
set me free, if I pay them a lakh!

1732
02:16:03,034 --> 02:16:05,310
Having caught me alone, do you
think everything is over?

1733
02:16:19,334 --> 02:16:21,541
Vasu.. Just watch that guy in black tshirt

1734
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,541
I saw him coming out of
Annathandavam's office

1735
02:16:28,701 --> 02:16:30,681
- Bring him to the rear
without anybody's knowledge

1736
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:35,712
- Come here! Who are you?
- Leave me! -Check him

1737
02:16:40,434 --> 02:16:41,412
<i>Vasu.. A gun'.!</i>

1738
02:16:45,067 --> 02:16:46,045
Who are you?

1739
02:16:46,567 --> 02:16:48,774
Did Annathandavam send you?
Are you here to kill me?

1740
02:16:49,434 --> 02:16:51,914
- No brother! I have come to kill Thandavam.

1741
02:16:53,867 --> 02:16:55,175
I need your help for that!

1742
02:16:56,234 --> 02:16:58,236
Why do you want to kill Annathandavam?
Who are you?

1743
02:16:59,134 --> 02:17:02,741
- Where are you from?
- I am Naresh Yadhav from Patna

1744
02:17:07,101 --> 02:17:10,514
- 13 years ago, Thandavam was
working under Rai Bahadur.

1745
02:17:11,167 --> 02:17:13,374
...a big contract killer in Patna

1746
02:17:14,934 --> 02:17:18,040
- My father was the collector
of Patna that time..

1747
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:23,213
- What happened? Get up!

1748
02:17:25,367 --> 02:17:28,143
- What's your problem?
- Darling. Look behind you!

1749
02:17:34,734 --> 02:17:36,714
Save him!!

1750
02:17:45,067 --> 02:17:48,412
This Patna, is Rai Bahadur's fort.

1751
02:17:50,067 --> 02:17:52,513
Did all of you hear it?

1752
02:17:58,267 --> 02:18:01,305
The case became strong since
my father was the collector.

1753
02:18:01,734 --> 02:18:03,941
So he escaped from Patna

1754
02:18:06,301 --> 02:18:07,609
I need to kill him brother!

1755
02:18:08,567 --> 02:18:10,103
I want to kill him!

1756
02:18:13,767 --> 02:18:15,974
- You don't need this gun anymore!
- No brother!

1757
02:18:17,568 --> 02:18:18,512
- Take care of your mom!

1758
02:18:20,934 --> 02:18:21,878
I'll take care of everything over here!

1759
02:18:23,267 --> 02:18:26,009
Mail me all the case details immediately!

1760
02:18:27,134 --> 02:18:29,080
- Take him to the airport
without anyone's knowledge

1761
02:18:32,267 --> 02:18:34,747
Why are you keeping the gun with you?

1762
02:18:35,901 --> 02:18:36,879
Tell me..

1763
02:18:37,934 --> 02:18:40,141
I've decided to kill Annathandavam, myself!

1764
02:18:40,867 --> 02:18:43,643
Each and every word of
his, is piercing my mind!

1765
02:18:45,334 --> 02:18:49,146
I can't be taking care
of all of my relatives!

1766
02:18:50,801 --> 02:18:52,699
- He has to die! -So? Why
do you have to kill him?

1767
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:54,543
If you tell Annachi, he
will do it using his men!

1768
02:18:55,134 --> 02:18:56,670
If you tell bhai, he
finish without a trace!

1769
02:18:56,967 --> 02:18:59,777
If we use goons to kill him, what's the
difference between us and Annathandavam?

1770
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:03,442
It's a sin to drag people who are
affectionate on us, into our troubles

1771
02:19:06,601 --> 02:19:10,606
Tomorrow after the temple rituals are over,
I'll take all our people to coimbatore.

1772
02:19:12,667 --> 02:19:14,647
I'll then come back to finish him!

1773
02:19:15,568 --> 02:19:18,048
If everything goes according to
our plan, I cannot stay here

1774
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:21,372
lam traveling tonight to bangalore,
by car and then take the first flight

1775
02:19:21,867 --> 02:19:22,845
To which place are you going?

1776
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:27,109
- Are you asking me so that you can blabber
to the cops when they torture you?

1777
02:19:28,067 --> 02:19:30,547
Don't ask!
Never ask about it!

1778
02:19:34,034 --> 02:19:35,570
Why are you leaving suddenly?

1779
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,579
There is an urgent stock
holders meeting in mumbai

1780
02:19:40,534 --> 02:19:42,411
That Sundar hasn't
uttered a word yet!

1781
02:19:42,734 --> 02:19:45,214
There seems to be some
plan in his stubbornness

1782
02:19:45,267 --> 02:19:47,747
lam happily giving my
daughter to your son

1783
02:19:50,501 --> 02:19:53,880
- D. Don't forget to invite me
for your marriage -Dad! -Joke!!

1784
02:19:57,067 --> 02:20:00,207
- It's better to ask your family members
to be a little cautious - Ok sir

1785
02:20:25,334 --> 02:20:26,540
We'll reach in 5 minutes

1786
02:20:37,767 --> 02:20:41,715
You may hide.. you may ignore

1787
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,573
But the war will find
you for it's necessary

1788
02:20:46,167 --> 02:20:50,138
You may be patient..
You may defend

1789
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:53,813
But the war is pronounced with
anger and thirst for blood

1790
02:20:54,700 --> 02:20:58,341
The world is full of hatred

1791
02:20:58,634 --> 02:21:02,582
Death shall not end any evil

1792
02:21:03,734 --> 02:21:05,907
- Where is Suseela and others
- They're on their way

1793
02:21:07,167 --> 02:21:10,546
And face the evil by yourself

1794
02:21:11,234 --> 02:21:15,148
Like the god that destroys the evil

1795
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:29,338
Driver. Start the car. Start now!

1796
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,739
- Dhivya, where are you now?
- It's says Top Slip 13 kms

1797
02:22:06,601 --> 02:22:07,909
You get down and run away!

1798
02:22:08,134 --> 02:22:11,172
Your life walks in every direction

1799
02:22:11,467 --> 02:22:15,176
In search of it's meaning

1800
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,771
As a child lost in a forest

1801
02:22:20,033 --> 02:22:23,606
And stuck in it's thorns

1802
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:27,975
The search you pursue for your heart

1803
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:32,448
Will show you the light
at the end of the tunnel

1804
02:22:32,634 --> 02:22:36,377
Don't shed tears during distress

1805
02:22:36,934 --> 02:22:40,643
Face it and it shall run away

1806
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:26,780
The god have left us amongst evil

1807
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:31,041
And the heart sobs in pain

1808
02:23:31,734 --> 02:23:35,079
The roots have fallen

1809
02:23:35,734 --> 02:23:39,682
And the curse is upon us

1810
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:40,970
I didn't know what to do...

1811
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:44,378
I couldn't reach Vasu

1812
02:23:44,433 --> 02:23:48,040
Don't slip.. for, generations will speak

1813
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:50,441
- I need an helicopter
- I'll arrange one

1814
02:23:52,834 --> 02:23:56,213
You can change it, only if you believe

1815
02:24:07,167 --> 02:24:09,044
Latitude 10.471 sir!

1816
02:24:10,234 --> 02:24:16,844
You may hide.. you may ignore But the
war will find you for it's necessary

1817
02:24:18,134 --> 02:24:21,980
You may be patient.. You
may defend But the war

1818
02:24:22,033 --> 02:24:25,708
is pronounced with anger
and thirst for blood

1819
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,036
- Vasu
- Why are the staff here?

1820
02:24:30,501 --> 02:24:31,479
It's nothing

1821
02:24:32,167 --> 02:24:33,145
Everything is fine!

1822
02:24:40,267 --> 02:24:42,247
Aunty! Why are you all crying?

1823
02:24:42,801 --> 02:24:44,405
Tell me what it is!

1824
02:24:44,734 --> 02:24:47,510
They have killed mom!

1825
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:49,077
She is taken for postmortem!

1826
02:24:50,434 --> 02:24:53,472
- How did you leave him?

1827
02:24:53,967 --> 02:24:56,811
- Instead of breaking his hands, you
should've chopped off his head!

1828
02:24:57,934 --> 02:25:02,576
Without doing any mistake, you punished
yourself by staying away for 4 years.

1829
02:25:02,933 --> 02:25:05,743
You could've gone to jail for 10
years slitting his throat.

1830
02:25:10,734 --> 02:25:14,705
Don't leave him! He has
traumatized even the kids.

1831
02:25:16,434 --> 02:25:18,107
Now we have lost a life!

1832
02:25:19,734 --> 02:25:21,714
Don't spare him!

1833
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,380
On tracing Thandavam's mobile..

1834
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:34,678
...he was at Bangalore last night

1835
02:25:35,833 --> 02:25:36,811
Today he is in Bihar

1836
02:25:38,767 --> 02:25:40,747
I'll get permission from IG
using these details and..

1837
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:42,978
...I'll travel to Bihar tomorrow.

1838
02:25:43,567 --> 02:25:44,545
No Sir!

1839
02:25:45,267 --> 02:25:46,245
You please leave it

1840
02:25:47,567 --> 02:25:49,547
- I'll finish him Off!
- What?

1841
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:52,480
- You are telling me that
you are gonna kill him?

1842
02:25:52,834 --> 02:25:54,438
Are you taking too much advantage?

1843
02:25:55,033 --> 02:25:59,004
You mind your business
and we'll do our work!

1844
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:04,946
There is no use of trusting SP anymore.
lam going to Bihar!

1845
02:26:05,167 --> 02:26:06,202
Vasu. What about mom?

1846
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:12,671
Tell everyone not to cremate
until uncle arrives from abroad.

1847
02:26:14,667 --> 02:26:18,046
- Naresh! -Brother! -Thandavam
has arrived at Patna

1848
02:26:24,667 --> 02:26:31,141
Hey Thandav. I am there! So far even Bihar
police do not have the guts to meet me.

1849
02:26:31,634 --> 02:26:33,739
Will the Tamilnadu police come here?

1850
02:26:34,534 --> 02:26:35,808
You go and enjoy!

1851
02:26:39,734 --> 02:26:42,078
- Vasu. Where are you?
- At the hospital

1852
02:26:42,134 --> 02:26:43,670
They told you're not
at the hospital

1853
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,178
I'll call you back later

1854
02:26:51,301 --> 02:26:53,281
Who are you? Why are you here?

1855
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,374
I came to the shop here!

1856
02:26:58,633 --> 02:27:00,510
- Where are you now, Vasu?
- At home.

1857
02:27:00,667 --> 02:27:03,705
- You are now at Kolkata
airport en route to Patna!

1858
02:27:04,967 --> 02:27:08,005
- I can arrest you there right
now, if I want!- Go ahead sir!

1859
02:27:11,701 --> 02:27:13,271
Thandavan reached Patna

1860
02:27:13,667 --> 02:27:15,203
As we thought, he met Rai Bahadur

1861
02:27:15,633 --> 02:27:17,510
I saw him there, but I couldn't follow him

1862
02:27:17,567 --> 02:27:18,910
- We can easily find them within an hour.

1863
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:21,305
- Patna has changed a lot!
- Yeah!

1864
02:27:32,733 --> 02:27:34,713
He must have gone and settled
with Rai Bahadur's gang.

1865
02:27:35,367 --> 02:27:38,507
I've told Patna police to arrest the
entire gang. You come back immediately!

1866
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:41,303
- No Sir!
- Your photo is with Patna police

1867
02:27:41,867 --> 02:27:44,074
- Anytime they will arrest you!
- Let them arrest!

1868
02:27:44,767 --> 02:27:45,745
Brother. He is not here!

1869
02:27:51,367 --> 02:27:53,347
This is Rai Bahadur's area!

1870
02:27:57,667 --> 02:27:59,305
We will have to catch him somehow!

1871
02:28:00,334 --> 02:28:01,312
Find out what it is

1872
02:28:07,667 --> 02:28:11,979
Hey Stop! Stop! He is the guy!

1873
02:28:13,567 --> 02:28:15,547
He has escaped from Kankar Bhag

1874
02:28:15,634 --> 02:28:16,612
Get behind them!

1875
02:28:19,633 --> 02:28:21,613
10 guys are going on 5 bikes

1876
02:28:22,101 --> 02:28:23,079
We'll have to get them somehow!

1877
02:28:34,101 --> 02:28:37,378
- Naresh. Come!
- No brother. You go!

1878
02:28:41,767 --> 02:28:44,771
- Promise me that you'll come back now.
I'll see that you don't get arrested.

1879
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:47,280
You've started, isn't it? We'll see!

1880
02:29:02,701 --> 02:29:05,739
Naresh!

1881
02:29:07,467 --> 02:29:08,445
Go fast!

1882
02:29:10,367 --> 02:29:15,009
The Cops have become completely
alert and we can't enter the city

1883
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:17,078
I need 5 Lakhs.

1884
02:29:19,234 --> 02:29:20,212
Can you arrange?

1885
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,978
Stop!
Stop!

1886
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,980
- We are coming inside.
- OK

1887
02:29:38,867 --> 02:29:39,845
They are coming

1888
02:29:47,934 --> 02:29:48,878
This is the guy!

1889
02:29:52,167 --> 02:29:54,044
- Who are you?
- Vasu

1890
02:29:55,167 --> 02:29:57,306
- Where are you from?
- Tamil Nadu

1891
02:29:58,101 --> 02:30:00,308
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to kill a guy

1892
02:30:00,967 --> 02:30:01,945
Murder?

1893
02:30:03,301 --> 02:30:04,837
Who is the guy?

1894
02:30:05,767 --> 02:30:06,745
- How much do you want?

1895
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:07,944
- Hey.. First...

1896
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:11,099
...tell me who the guy is..

1897
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:12,977
Then we will discuss about the money

1898
02:30:13,434 --> 02:30:16,244
Without knowing the charge, how
can I tell you who the guy is?

1899
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:17,278
Oh is it?

1900
02:30:18,534 --> 02:30:22,141
40 lakhs. Tell me...
Can you pay 40 lakhs?

1901
02:30:22,234 --> 02:30:23,406
I'll give you 50 lakhs

1902
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:27,180
There is an advance of 5Lakhs in this

1903
02:30:27,334 --> 02:30:28,312
Give that

1904
02:30:35,967 --> 02:30:38,140
- Now tell me. Who is the guy?

1905
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:39,579
Thandavam

1906
02:30:41,234 --> 02:30:43,236
- Which Thandav?
- Annathandavam

1907
02:30:44,634 --> 02:30:45,612
Your 9W!

1908
02:31:09,234 --> 02:31:10,212
You got the advance right?

1909
02:31:10,667 --> 02:31:11,702
When will you finish him?

1910
02:31:12,001 --> 02:31:13,878
Who is this lunatic?
Finish him off!

1911
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,604
You took the cash, isn't it?

1912
02:31:20,334 --> 02:31:21,608
When will you kill him?

1913
02:31:30,567 --> 02:31:31,545
You @#$

1914
02:31:46,434 --> 02:31:47,708
Please go fast!

1915
02:31:48,034 --> 02:31:50,708
That fellow has finally
got caught in our place!

1916
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:10,480
Do you know who he is?

1917
02:32:11,067 --> 02:32:14,480
He can finish off your family even if
they flee to any corner of the world.

1918
02:32:18,767 --> 02:32:19,745
How will he do it now?

1919
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,542
How can a dead man finish
off my family now?

1920
02:32:25,567 --> 02:32:26,545
Don't leave him alive.

1921
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:29,478
Shoot!

1922
02:33:44,367 --> 02:33:46,005
It's my duty to get him
the right punishment.

1923
02:33:46,334 --> 02:33:47,312
When will you get it for him?

1924
02:33:48,267 --> 02:33:51,305
This son of a @#$% is challenging
me that he can finish off

1925
02:33:51,367 --> 02:33:54,143
my family if he has a mobile
even if he is any prison!

1926
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:56,280
Do you still want me to leave him alive?

1927
02:33:57,067 --> 02:34:00,810
You told me to get weapon's license
just for the sake of it?

1928
02:34:01,033 --> 02:34:02,011
Shut up!

1929
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,979
- I cannot lose another life in my family!

1930
02:34:07,767 --> 02:34:09,303
I'll not run away after killing him

1931
02:34:09,767 --> 02:34:10,745
You can come arrest me!

1932
02:34:11,767 --> 02:34:14,213
- No! - Why are you scared? How
many have you killed?

1933
02:34:14,767 --> 02:34:18,146
- Have you ever been scared?

1934
02:34:19,067 --> 02:34:21,513
Right or wrong, there will be
a reason behind every murder

1935
02:34:22,201 --> 02:34:24,647
But you are a filthy creature
who kills for money!

1936
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:25,844
I am going to finish him.

1937
02:34:26,633 --> 02:34:29,113
You take all the cops to the other side.
I'll go alone

1938
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:31,478
Follow me cops!

1939
02:34:32,001 --> 02:34:36,279
13 years back, in front of the wife and
child, you brutally killed the collector..

1940
02:34:37,534 --> 02:34:38,512
Do you remember that?

1941
02:34:39,833 --> 02:34:43,804
It's your sin and their curse,
that has brought you and me here.

1942
02:34:46,267 --> 02:34:48,406
My mom is everything to me in this world

1943
02:34:51,134 --> 02:34:53,114
you killed her!

1944
02:34:54,467 --> 02:34:56,003
You killed her!

1945
02:34:58,134 --> 02:35:00,273
How dare you kill her!

1946
02:35:24,901 --> 02:35:27,381
I've been chasing you to protect you!

1947
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,907
Finally you made me shoot a corpse!
