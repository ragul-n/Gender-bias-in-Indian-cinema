1
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,016
Namaste.

2
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,910
Welcome madam.

3
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,740
Hi Dan.

4
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,830
Hey Dan, you're back here?

5
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,910
Your entire training
will go into cleaning.

6
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,806
Remember the bond all you
trainees signed at the beginning?

7
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,806
If it's broken for any reason,

8
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,266
...you can kiss your
diploma goodbye...

9
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,410
...and your parents will end up
paying three hundred thousand rupees.

10
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,870
So whoever has been wiping
their feet on guest towels...

11
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,410
...let me remind you of
the cameras in every corridor!

12
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,306
Okay, quick question:

13
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,596
If ammonia and bleach are
both excellent cleaning agents...

14
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,870
...why don't we ever mix them?

15
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,240
Because they turn into Chloromine,
which is dangerous.

16
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,490
So now you know, Mr Dan,
why your junior is training with you.

17
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,950
If she's so smart, she should have
been a scientist and served the nation.

18
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,950
Rest of us could
have managed the hotel.

19
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,330
If you manage your own training;
That would be enough.

20
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,806
9 o'clock.

21
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,870
Yes, Sir.

22
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,450
Sarin... the room is
booked for Akaash Sarin.

23
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,580
Twin beds... Room 9014.

24
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,096
Your ID please...

25
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,386
What do you mean by 'twin bed'?

26
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,410
Two beds... but separate.

27
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,410
There must be a mistake,
I clicked on 'double bed'.

28
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,466
That may be,
but it's a third-party booking...

29
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,306
...so rooms are subject to availability.

30
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,950
I don't care. I clicked on
'double bed' and that's what I want.

31
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,886
Sure Sir, but as I've said,
it's not available, otherwise...

32
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,490
What otherwise!

33
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,540
Can't you see I'm with my wife?

34
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,870
And I come here so often!
Bloody idiot!

35
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Of course, Sir.

36
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,556
In fact I checked
you in last time too...

37
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,540
...with your ex-wife, was it?

38
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,620
So, shall I get your
luggage taken to the room?

39
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,806
Just you wait!

40
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,870
Right, Sir.

41
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,370
Have a good night, Sir... Madam

42
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,660
I could've been at the pool.

43
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,410
It doesn't matter who the guest is with,
a wife, a girlfriend, whoever...

44
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,410
You're no one to sit in judgment.

45
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,450
But, Sir, you know that she is...
It doesn't matter!

46
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,040
And what are you
doing here at pool side?

47
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,516
Aren't you supposed to
be in the garden wing?

48
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,200
Sir, you've given me
third floor vacuuming again!

49
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,660
I just did it last week.

50
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,040
Can't you give it to someone else?
I'll thwack you!

51
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,950
You'll get what you deserve.

52
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,240
Now, get back to work.
Sir... Sir...

53
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,330
Sir... give me the kitchen duty.
I'm great at chopping.

54
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
Or the bar is also fine.

55
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,580
Oh, so now you want to be at the bar?

56
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,540
Yes sir, I make really
good cocktails at home.

57
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,290
And they are very nice sir.

58
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,200
Well, then, go back home.

59
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,346
When the wedding venue is so far away,
which idiot booked us here?

60
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,766
Well, you demanded a stay
in a luxury hotel...

61
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,556
And now you're calling my dad an idiot?

62
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,040
Whatever... Where's our youngest one?

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,386
You were holding him last.

64
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,716
Not at all.

65
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,330
Maybe he's still in the room.

66
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,556
Now with this evidence,

67
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,450
...either I file an
official complaint or...

68
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,620
I'm sending you off to the laundry!

69
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,136
Sorry, Sir! Spare me the laundry.
No. Laundry for a week.

70
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,516
Sorry, Sir, this won't happen again.

71
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,216
And you better not be seen anywhere else.

72
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,790
You know what a startup is?

73
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,200
That's where the future lies.

74
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,700
Own a small business instead
of slaving away at a job.

75
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,620
If I were you,
I'd have opened my own laundry.

76
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,660
I'm just saying.

77
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,290
I'll start my own restaurant

78
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm not gonna slog here.

79
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,160
If you keep standing all day,
you'll get varicose veins.

80
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,370
Ugly and painful!

81
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,830
Anyone of you could get it.

82
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,240
You should soak your
legs in hot water with salt.

83
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,700
Okay.

84
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,080
Elastic? Okay, let me check.

85
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,740
Whose bright idea was it
to iron the underpants for Room 602?

86
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
Ever heard of the concept of elastic?

87
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,910
It becomes loose.

88
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,410
You'll all be in trouble.
There's been a complaint.

89
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,830
Will you stop? I'm sick of you.

90
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,120
You're a trainee, right?

91
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,790
We're all your seniors.

92
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,790
Just do what you've
been sent here for.

93
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,660
And shut your trap!
But...

94
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:04,240
Another word and I'll shove
you into one of these machines.

95
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,030
What happened?

96
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,740
He's being aggressive for no reason.

97
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,410
Take it easy, I'll talk to him.

98
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,636
There's been a
complaint from Room 602.

99
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,790
602? Yes, because these geniuses had
ironed the underpants. Okay let me check.

100
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,950
Hey, scratch my back, please?

101
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,910
Where?

102
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,410
Here?
A little to the right.

103
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,620
Here?
Further down.

104
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,926
A little to the right.

105
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,740
Sir, whose panty is this?

106
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,160
It's a 'pant', not 'panty'!

107
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,450
Listen, are you really serious
about our restaurant venture?

108
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,830
I can leave the training right
away and start, but can you guys?

109
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,216
And who's 'panty' is this sir?

110
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,490
It's Dan's.
We can't leave it midway.

111
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,040
Then what's the point in
bringing it up again and again?

112
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,636
Because my parents
want me to get married.

113
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,716
And how are the two connected?

114
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,620
What if you guys decide
to start a street-side counter?

115
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,306
I'd rather get married than do that.

116
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,346
So go ahead.

117
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,386
Ya, Watch me.

118
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,660
Then we can cater
the food at her wedding.

119
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,580
If that's the case then
I am not getting married at all!

120
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,370
Birds chirping.

121
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,660
Dan?

122
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,266
Dan?

123
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,016
Tch... What?

124
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Look at this.

125
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,160
I didn't scatter them.

126
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,990
But you could've picked them up. Uhm.

127
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,370
So go ahead and complaint then.

128
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,620
There's one... Behind you.

129
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,330
See, I picked some too.

130
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
They're dried up anyways.

131
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,636
Put all the 500 ml ones on the table.

132
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,080
And check the champagne
at the bar - no more than 12.

133
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,636
Excuse me, Sir,
the client had ordered 15 bottles.

134
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,740
What do you want to do with the rest?

135
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,540
I'll take them home, idiot!!

136
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,080
Where is your duty?

137
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,830
There he is!

138
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,176
We've been waiting Dan.

139
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,766
I know guys but there's one real
ridiculous party going on downstairs.

140
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,490
Keep pouring...
Here's your lemonade

141
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm going down again.

142
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,370
Bring some snacks too!

143
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,370
Who all were around last night,
binging?

144
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,740
Tell me!

145
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,410
Stop covering up for Dan
or you all are going to get it!

146
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,120
Sir, we were just hanging around.

147
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,620
Two bottles are missing
from the inventory.

148
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,466
Namashkar, how may
I help you today?

149
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,466
Could you guide us on
what to see in your city?

150
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,870
Yes! You can visit old Delhi,
the Lal Qila.

151
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,096
Our hotel car will take you there.

152
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,620
Sign here please.

153
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,450
Have a good day, Sir, bye, Ma'am.

154
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,410
You know what your problem is, Dan?
You're constantly irritated.

155
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,830
I'm irritated?

156
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
Ya, all the time.

157
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,490
You know when I'm irritated?

158
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,740
When?

159
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
When I'm with the two of you.

160
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,410
Well, my friend that you can't escape from...
so you better learn to manage your moods.

161
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,580
Are you irritated again?

162
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,080
Yes!

163
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,450
Thanks Dan!

164
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,240
Sir, but I'm not here to swat flies.

165
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,040
All these dirty jobs
are not worth my qualification.

166
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,636
Our manager Asthana
is being manipulative.

167
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,830
Oh, come on!

168
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,990
You're blaming Asthana for
the missing alcohol from banquets?

169
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,886
Sir, sir, sir, can I get an off on the 30th
December? It's my parents' anniversary

170
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,700
30-31st... you should know better,

171
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,080
...the hotel runs on full occupancy.

172
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,080
And what are you doing here,
go get yourself a haircut!

173
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,620
Sir, but it's their 25th!

174
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,080
NO!

175
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,596
Hey, you're sloshed again!

176
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,516
Another year's gone by, Ishani.

177
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,450
Years come and go,
what's the big deal.

178
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,580
Not one of you can handle your booze.

179
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,290
Come on, guys, let's take a selfie.

180
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,160
Happy New Year! Cheers!

181
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,160
Another drink for you?

182
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,290
No, no, how will I go home?
Dan's also not here.

183
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,990
Ya, even I haven't seen him.

184
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,716
Where is Dan?

185
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,290
He's skipping work today.

186
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
Screams...!

187
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,450
Shiuli..

188
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,290
Shiuli..

189
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,030
Watch her hand.

190
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,150
We may have to intubate her.

191
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,070
Check the pulse.

192
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,240
Very shallow breath.

193
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,900
The pulse is rapid and too weak...

194
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,820
What time did she fall?

195
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,916
12:15 am.

196
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,900
Left pupil is dilated,
right is sluggish.

197
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,756
I think we should intubate her.
From which floor did she fall?

198
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,320
3rd floor, swimming pool...
normally no one goes there at that hour.

199
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,336
What's her name?

200
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,820
Shiuli Iyer.

201
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,900
Lift her...

202
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,256
Current status, patient on ventilator.

203
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,796
Sedated. No movement.

204
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,506
Pulse 110.

205
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,506
Is she breathing?
Very shallow.

206
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,756
Pupils are dilated?

207
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,796
Left is dilated,
right is very sluggish.

208
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,626
Pressure?

209
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,796
90 by 60.

210
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,916
Any responses?

211
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,190
No, none at all.

212
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,256
Any reaction?

213
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,876
None at all.

214
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,126
Is she conscious?
In and out.

215
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,416
Oxygen supply is on.

216
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Need urgent admission in ICU.

217
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,716
20 year old female, case of TBI.

218
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,006
She fell from the third floor,
about 30 feet.

219
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,240
How did she fall?

220
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,860
Don't really know.

221
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,860
Doctor suction?

222
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,070
Give me suction-bipolar
and monopolar 25, 25H...

223
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,150
Oxygen saturation?

224
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Keep oxygen saturation low...
at 90%.

225
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,240
And PCO2 low.

226
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,940
Shiuli doesn't drink alcohol.

227
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,740
You can check the blood reports.

228
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,900
It's an accident case, madam.

229
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,690
But we have to investigate.

230
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,440
In case somebody's pushed her.

231
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,940
Why would anyone push her?

232
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,030
All her friends are
from respectable families.

233
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,836
I have to do my job.

234
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,820
So who's stopping you.

235
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,530
We're not going anywhere... Mom,
it's okay.

236
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,530
Do you think someone pushed her?

237
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,190
No mom.

238
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,740
That's a big blood clot.

239
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,820
Hmmm... She's still critical.

240
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,190
You could have told me.

241
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,360
You could have picked up your phone.

242
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,280
I called you at least 15 times.

243
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,610
I thought you were drunk-dialing

244
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,570
15 times?

245
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,110
Here's an extra entry pass.

246
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,900
Who'll take charge of it?

247
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,190
Sorry, Sir.

248
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,940
What you all have done
is monumentally stupid!

249
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,990
Now on, don't utter a word to anyone...

250
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,280
...till the investigation is over.

251
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,740
Good evening, Sir.

252
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,780
Go and see her, Dan.

253
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,530
Have you all seen her?

254
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,900
Just Leave your bag here.

255
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,440
Leave them here with us

256
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,280
3rd floor, neuro ICU, bed no. 28.

257
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,410
Remove your shoes please.

258
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,240
Clean your hands.

259
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,620
Excuse me please.

260
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,950
Did you see how swollen her face was?

261
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,280
And those 19 tubes.

262
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,160
You counted them?

263
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,490
Poor thing.

264
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,570
If you'd have seen her when she fell,

265
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,490
I bet, you would've fainted.

266
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,200
I had my life sucked out of me today.

267
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:58,870
You know,
that pipe in her throat and nose?

268
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,410
I don't think they fit it properly.

269
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,820
There was blood dripping out.

270
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,176
No, no, that's
how it's supposed to be.

271
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,990
No.

272
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,070
It's a fresh surgery.

273
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,790
They clean it,
but it keeps coming back.

274
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,380
It's normal.

275
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,210
How can this be normal?

276
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,210
Trust me.

277
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,500
And what makes you the expert?

278
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,790
Okay, not an expert,
but I definitely know more than you.

279
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,000
I've been there twice.

280
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,766
Twice?

281
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,130
Yes, Yesterday and today.

282
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,210
That's why I know better.

283
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,630
Those machines were
making such a noise.

284
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,056
Oh yes, that's the ventilator.

285
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,000
No, no, the one that shows
your ECG.

286
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,500
It toots like...

287
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,540
Ya... right...

288
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,330
...it's still ringing in my ears.

289
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,580
I think there's something
wrong with the food.

290
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:14,460
C'mon, just relax... eat.

291
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,540
Sir, we could shift patient no.
31 to the ward.

292
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,266
Would you like to study
the fresh scans for patient no. 28?

293
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,000
Sure.

294
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,830
She fell from 30 feet above.

295
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,630
That's quite a height.

296
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,016
What does the CT say?

297
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,106
Right side SDH
And no positive signs.

298
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,686
Any other injury?

299
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,380
The spine is affected, sir.

300
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,420
What's her name?
Shiuli.

301
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,290
Shiuli, can you hear me?

302
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,710
Can you feel the pain?

303
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,830
Seems like permanent
Damage, waist down.

304
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:01,920
Mrs. Iyer, in neurological terms,
consciousness is defined by two things...

305
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,170
One, that the patient
should be awake...

306
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,750
...And the other,
the patient should be aware.

307
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,880
Shiuli's neither awake nor aware.

308
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,380
She's in deep coma.

309
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,580
Is she brain-dead?

310
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,790
No... that would mean absolute end.

311
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,460
Clinically speaking,
she has not reached that stage as yet.

312
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,500
It all depends on how
damaged the white matter is.

313
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,710
Akka.

314
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,670
Shiuli.

315
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,790
Sister.

316
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
Shiuli.

317
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,710
You want to go visit?

318
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,130
No, not today.

319
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,790
You keep it then.

320
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,936
I'll be off, then.

321
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,356
Okay, be careful.

322
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,210
How much?

323
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,880
What's wrong?

324
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,000
Give me the pass.

325
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,356
Pass?
Ya, I changed my mind.

326
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,170
You could've told me earlier.

327
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,210
Here you go.

328
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,726
How will you come back?

329
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,080
You go ahead, I'll manage.

330
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,130
Are you part of the family?
No.

331
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,170
Boyfriend?

332
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,960
That other boy, is he the boyfriend?
No.

333
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,540
So... you're here for no reason, then?

334
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,000
Hmm... Then please leave. Go!

335
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,330
Go!

336
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,290
Get the order for table 9 going, quick!

337
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,830
So, How is your friend feeling?

338
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,630
You can try jumping off the
4th floor and you'll know how it feels.

339
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,290
What the hell are you doing?

340
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,290
I'm checking... maybe she'll respond.

341
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,250
Have you lost your mind?
You'd better leave.

342
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,540
I came first, you leave.

343
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,580
Hippocampus... cerebral
cortex... basal ganglia... thalamus...

344
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,250
Almost all of them compromised.

345
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,476
So much of acceleration
and deceleration in the brain.

346
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,540
The damage is unbelievable!

347
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,500
This white-grey area...

348
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,500
...it shouldn't look like this.

349
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,920
We are not 100% sure, but normally
it's difficult to recover.

350
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,710
Sir, we feel the
damage is irreversible.

351
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,960
Not immediately, but eventually
we will have to take a decision.

352
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,960
I feel we can stretch
this period little more.

353
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,130
We should give Shiuli
some time to fight it out.

354
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,670
Shiuli.

355
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,330
Shiuli.

356
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,250
Shiuli.

357
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,210
Shiuli.

358
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,790
You can study undisturbed
in that corner.

359
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,330
Use the canteen coupons for lunch.

360
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,330
No need to pay... hmm.

361
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,556
So, as you can see,

362
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,936
...the isometric view
as opposed to the...

363
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,290
...orthographic projection gives
a more three dimensional view.

364
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,580
I was just checking the bill...

365
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,000
One hundred and seventy four thousand
Rupess... should I use your card?

366
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,500
No, request them for a week more.

367
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,250
We need this medicine.
Okay.

368
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,330
Two months.

369
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,670
How will you manage these expenses?

370
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,330
Did you see last month's bill?

371
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,516
Don't forget you're
the only earning member.

372
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,146
I have some savings.

373
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,170
But for how long?

374
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,880
What if things don't
change in two months?

375
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,210
It's common in such cases.

376
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,460
You'll be left
penniless and drained...

377
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,630
If your husband were alive...

378
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,880
Then he would've made her do engineering,
not this silly hotel job.

379
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,630
Even two months seem too less.

380
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,710
She's just 21...

381
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,710
...how can you give up so soon?

382
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,750
Who asked you?

383
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,000
Get lost!

384
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,290
You'll have to take a decision soon.

385
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,580
It's been a long time.

386
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,960
Still seems unbelievable.

387
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,880
She was always so careful.

388
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,960
Why would she sit on the ledge?

389
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,040
God knows what image
you guys have of her.

390
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,580
I think she was quite stupid.

391
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,080
No common sense.

392
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,920
We were all just chatting,
enjoying ourselves...

393
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,476
Then she asked "Where is Dan?"

394
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,920
And that's it. She sat up there.

395
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,830
There was dew, she slipped...

396
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,750
What did she say?

397
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,556
Nothing. She slipped, right?

398
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,380
No, she said something earlier.

399
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,306
Nothing... She just asked 'Where is Dan'

400
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,460
Anyways,
I don't want to talk about it...

401
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,830
What's wrong?

402
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,330
"Where is Dan?"

403
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,080
She asked about me.

404
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,040
She said this, right?

405
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,540
And you all didn't
think I should know?

406
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,710
Ya. So what's the big deal?

407
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,830
The big deal is that
those were her last words.

408
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,250
"Where is Dan?"

409
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,670
That's me, Manjeet!

410
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,830
Hey, I was also there.

411
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,936
She was just generally asking,
nothing special right?

412
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,830
Right!

413
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,000
That's because all
of you were too sloshed.

414
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,710
Or one of you could have stopped
her from sitting there.

415
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,040
And she wouldn't have fallen.

416
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,250
And you didn't even tell me.

417
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,330
Why are you getting agitated?

418
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,420
Now how do I tell her where I was?

419
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,080
Answer me!

420
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,380
What do I say?

421
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,500
Hey, where are you off to?

422
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,790
Dan!
Who'll eat all this pizza?

423
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,960
This is a day pass.

424
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,830
No entry without night pass.

425
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,056
I just have to speak
to the patient for a bit.

426
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,856
Won't take long.

427
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,306
No entry without night pass.

428
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,210
See, I was here yesterday as well.

429
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,146
Yesterday, it may have happened.

430
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,630
Not today.

431
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,516
You don't understand.

432
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,976
I have to speak to her.

433
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,556
You can come along.

434
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,556
I'll say what I have to and come back.

435
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,186
Rules are rules, come in the morning.

436
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,130
Hey, why're you pushing me.

437
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,330
Get lost, out...

438
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,000
I know the likes of you.

439
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,510
This security guy
is a tough nut to crack.

440
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,290
By the way,
what was it that you wanted to say?

441
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,250
Why should I tell you?

442
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,420
I have a night entry pass.

443
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,750
I can convey your message.

444
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,830
No thanks.

445
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,290
That's Okay.

446
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,880
But I'll still convey it.

447
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,750
What? And to whom?

448
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,710
Whoever, I'll tell them.

449
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,880
What'll you say?

450
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,000
About your encounter with the guard.

451
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,540
No, you won't!

452
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,630
Now I definitely will... just you wait!

453
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,880
Night pass?

454
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,460
Don't have it.

455
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,580
Then you can't go.

456
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,880
Just a few minutes... please,
I need to talk to the nurse.

457
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,380
You'll get me fired!
Please.

458
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,710
Just two minutes, then.

459
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,790
Thank you so much.

460
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,540
What's your name?

461
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,130
Get lost!

462
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,290
Hi...

463
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,540
so...

464
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,630
you wanted to know where I was...

465
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:40,210
Actually... I...
wasn't around that day...

466
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,750
Hey!

467
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,130
No sleeping here, please leave.

468
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,130
So, what doctor should
one see for a stomach ache?

469
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,920
Is it gastric, liver-related or pregnancy?
Gastric.

470
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,500
Dr. R.P. Singh T-T-S.

471
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,170
T-T-S?

472
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,040
Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday

473
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,830
Tuesday-Thursday-Satur...

474
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,540
...and if it's Vitamin D deficiency?

475
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,686
Then it's the ortho...
Dr. SN Dutta for bones.

476
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,830
M-W-F?

477
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,040
No, T-T-S again.

478
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,920
Is heart specialist
and cardiologist the same?

479
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,330
What are the symptoms?

480
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,630
Are you the patient?

481
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:58,380
No, no, I was just asking
for my general knowledge.

482
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,170
You carry on... my apologies.

483
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,420
Shiuli... Shiuli, can you feel this?

484
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,080
Shiuli...

485
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,210
Shiuli.

486
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,710
What do you want?

487
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:34,210
Did Shiuli ever talk
about me during college?

488
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,500
Or... some other time?

489
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,016
Have you lost it!

490
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,476
You've come to ask me
this early in the morning?

491
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,920
Please... Ishani.

492
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,500
No, we had better
things to talk about.

493
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,790
Then why did she ask about me?

494
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,460
And that too before dying?

495
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,540
I mean, she's not dead yet,
but... you know...

496
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,920
...someone's last words
are special, right?

497
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,500
Look, I really don't think
she was interested in you.

498
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,460
You guys are poles apart!

499
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,250
Then why did she ask about me?

500
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,000
Stop bugging me!

501
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,146
Half an hour left to the shift...

502
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:05,880
Drop me home?

503
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,210
I will, but tell me
if you get to know anything.

504
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,630
Am I imagining things?

505
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,080
Do you have the keys?

506
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,380
Yes. Isn't this madam's car?

507
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,210
Bring it straight in, turn a bit,

508
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,330
Bring it straight in.

509
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,000
Now straight.

510
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,040
That's it.

511
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,170
Come, sit Dan.

512
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,226
Just got so busy between
the hospital and home...

513
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,540
...forgot all about the car.

514
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,830
Thanks!

515
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,500
You know, when I was a kid,
I fractured my left arm.

516
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:52,330
It should have healed
in 3 weeks but didn't.

517
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,330
But eventually it did.

518
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,210
Same way, Shiuli
should have recovered by now...

519
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:12,960
...but hasn't...
but she will.

520
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,760
Nurse, isn't the urine output
more than usual today?

521
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,760
Did you increase her fluids?

522
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,300
So that means kidney
is not affected by the brain.

523
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,680
Don't you have anything better to do?

524
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,800
Bye!

525
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,076
Ma'am, could you
please lift your feet.

526
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,220
He's sweeping the floor.

527
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,680
Uncle, could you lift your feet.

528
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,720
Ask them also please...

529
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,640
Wait, don't step on the wet floor.

530
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,390
Who's admitted?

531
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,720
Mom.

532
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,760
Why?

533
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,260
To deliver a baby.

534
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,760
Twins?

535
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,470
Bed no. 28!

536
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,720
Yes!

537
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,220
What were you doing in
the 3rd floor Neuro ICU?

538
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,800
I was working.

539
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,326
Then why were you staring
at the patient for so long?

540
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,760
You must have a lot of work,

541
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,430
Hurry up then.

542
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:33,600
Why were you staring at
the patient for so long? Do your work...

543
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,010
...and stop staring at her.

544
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,260
Hey, hey, where are you off to?

545
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,696
Sir, I'm done with my shift.

546
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,600
I don't think so.
Haven't you seen the duty roster?

547
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,526
No Hotel is in full occupancy,.

548
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,930
Everyone's been working double shifts.

549
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,010
Back to Banquets immediately.

550
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,640
Do you realize you're constantly
at the hospital nowadays.

551
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,760
Is it?

552
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,100
Yes.

553
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,220
Fine, I won't go that often. Ya, but
it's not just me, everyone thinks so.

554
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,260
Alright, I heard you.

555
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,260
I've seen such cases.

556
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,680
If she has to live in a vegetative state.

557
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,930
What's the point of torturing her?

558
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,350
Please Jairam,
don't start with your negativity.

559
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,890
You heard them...

560
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,640
...she won't even recognize you.

561
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,350
Is that what you want?

562
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,550
So what if she doesn't... you'd
recognize her, right?

563
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,890
All you keep saying is pull the plug.

564
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,550
What's the rush?

565
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,760
We have to give her time.

566
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,550
I think he's absolutely right.

567
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,010
I'm going to the Accounts now.

568
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,736
Who is he?

569
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,050
Dad's younger brother.

570
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,720
Lives in the south of India.

571
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,970
And dad?

572
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,220
Dad passed away 10 years ago.

573
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,026
I've given you all your medication
Except for this one.

574
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,930
Can't understand what's written.

575
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,776
But it's really unclear.

576
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,406
Who do I go to, then? I'm sorry.

577
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,276
You're a chemist, you should know.

578
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,260
Show me.

579
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,526
Who's the patient?

580
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,470
My brother.

581
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,390
Please do not eat here.

582
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,050
Does your brother have high blood pressure?
Yes.

583
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,970
This is Metasartan 25,
it's a BP medicine.

584
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,350
Metasartan 25?

585
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,600
Yes, do you have it?
Yes.

586
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,300
Thank you so much!

587
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,260
Manjeet!

588
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,350
Hi.

589
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,850
You could've said something.

590
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,760
We're not hiding.

591
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,600
And as if you have
time for us these days.

592
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,550
Shall we order food?

593
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,350
I'm not hungry.

594
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,930
Oh is it? So you only relish hospital
cafeteria food now?

595
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,180
Hey, it's not like that!

596
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,180
6 shifts covered by Manjeet,
4 by Adi, and 3 by me!

597
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,600
Besides it's not like she
was your best friend.

598
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,260
Look, I'm not
asking what you are up to.

599
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,600
And I haven't asked anyone to cover
my shifts. Never mind, leave it.

600
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,890
Okay, then why don't you ask that
parade of doctors...

601
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,890
...what are her chances of survival.

602
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,600
So you mean to say you guys do
something only when it's a sure 'chance'?!

603
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,800
Sorry.

604
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,850
Atleast think before
you open your trap.

605
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,350
I said sorry.

606
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,600
Can I ask you something?

607
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,050
How good is Dr. Ghosh?

608
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,180
The neuro guy? He's a genius!

609
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,180
Really? You're sure?

610
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,300
He's the best here.

611
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,300
Anything wrong?

612
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,906
No, just being sure
of who we are dealing with.

613
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,550
I guess if you're so
sure he's a genius, he must be.

614
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,220
What do you mean?

615
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,720
Of course, I'm sure.

616
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,050
Don't mess with me.

617
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,760
It's the Neuro ICU doctors
upstairs who are messing around.

618
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,550
Hang on a minute...

619
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,720
...you're that hotel guy attendant, right?

620
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:38,760
I've seen you around.

621
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,050
Behave, or I'll get the
security guards to ban your entry.

622
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,760
I've also seen you around.

623
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,140
Outside the nurses' van in the night.

624
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,430
Hey, what I do with the
nurses is none of your business.

625
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,640
Now get lost or else!

626
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,350
Sir... Sir...

627
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,470
Sir... are you off?

628
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,680
Yes, why?

629
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,010
No, I...

630
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Hurry up!

631
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,720
I wanted to take 3-4 days off.

632
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,430
Off? You're already in the red!

633
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,850
Sir, my Dad's really unwell.

634
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,550
Wasn't he posted in Kashmir?

635
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,720
Sir, he had a bad stomach
ache when was in the field.

636
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,720
They found 4 large
stones in his gall bladder.

637
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Okay, let me think about it.

638
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,640
He's in a lot of pain...

639
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,986
I just got this call,

640
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,640
Seems to be some kind of a stroke, I think.

641
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,116
When did it happen?

642
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,180
Around 3 am,
she started shaking violently.

643
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,680
And then in an hour,
she had another seizure.

644
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:57,550
Pulse?

645
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,970
Pressure?

646
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,220
60 by 40.

647
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,220
We should inform Dr. Ghosh.

648
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:21,050
She's had a stroke and seizures,
but you're still clinging on to hope.

649
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,010
You heard what the
doctor confirmed last night.

650
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,430
She'll be paralyzed for life.

651
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,600
Why can't you all
be practical for once?

652
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,260
Dad would have never rushed.

653
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,470
He would have waited.

654
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,890
What good is her life if
she can't even breathe on her own?

655
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,760
Is this how you want her to live?

656
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,930
Yes, why not?

657
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,850
Maybe she wants to live.

658
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,140
Why 'maybe'...I'm 100% sure.

659
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,850
Who are we to decide for her,
it's her choice?

660
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,550
Ask her...

661
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,220
I don't think she wants to die.

662
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,890
Your uncle belongs in the jungle.

663
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,180
He has the patience of a monkey!

664
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,720
So what if she needs the
machine's support for a while.

665
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,430
We should give it.

666
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,326
There are so many times
my motorbike doesn't start.

667
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,100
Then I push it, and it kicks in.

668
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,680
The ventilator is also a push.
So bear with it for a while.

669
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,760
Anyway you're just resting.

670
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:34,470
Mrs. Iyer, coma patients
react to strong smells sometimes.

671
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,800
Their olfactory senses
can respond to external stimuli.

672
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,510
In this case, her nose twitched
because of these night Jasmine flowers...

673
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,970
It's very common.

674
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,350
But doctor, it happened 2-3 times...

675
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,350
...isn't that a positive sign?

676
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,100
Yes, definitely.

677
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,760
Maybe, it's some kind of hint
that she could be conscious.

678
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,100
We can't conclude that,
but we're on the right track.

679
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,890
Let's continue with the treatment..

680
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,720
Sister.

681
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,720
Shiuli.

682
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,010
Sister.

683
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,660
We need to talk.

684
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,870
Dry-clean this please. Thank you.

685
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,200
How long have you been doing this?

686
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,660
20 years.

687
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,660
Family?

688
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,516
No one likes to marry a nurse.

689
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,700
We're cursed.

690
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,410
Why?

691
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:47,426
We nurse the patients,
touch them here and there.

692
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,160
Makes people question our morals.

693
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,790
Would you marry a nurse?

694
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,790
I could...

695
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,580
Then call me for your wedding.

696
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,500
Only if you come with a gift!

697
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,950
Couldn't get more.

698
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,540
The night jasmine season is ending.

699
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,910
Can you twitch your nose again?

700
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,620
I want to see it too.

701
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,950
She can't do that everyday.

702
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,540
It happened once.

703
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,250
Did you run into him outside?

704
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,450
Huh?

705
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,040
Her uncle...

706
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,370
...he's back.

707
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,726
He's on duty today.

708
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,660
Why's that?

709
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,160
Her mother has fever.

710
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,200
Where's the ventilator plug?

711
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,660
Then make sure he doesn't sit there.

712
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,200
Make him sit far away...
like here, maybe.

713
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,870
Just don't let him
get anywhere near the plug!

714
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,500
Nurse?

715
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,660
The hospital pharmacy doesn't
have this medicine in stock.

716
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:57,660
You have to get it from outside.

717
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,500
Do you have this in stock?

718
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,540
Let me check.

719
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,910
There are 9,000 weddings
in New Delhi today.

720
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,540
In one day?
Ya... they've all lost it.

721
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,580
That's seventeen thousand
two hundred rupees.

722
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,516
Ohh!!

723
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,950
Yes, our card machine
isn't working, cash please

724
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,136
I'll go and get cash.

725
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,120
I hope you'll be open for a while?

726
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,120
Here's twenty thousand.

727
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,660
Look, what you've done to yourself.

728
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:09,370
You couldn't stop yourself from getting
sucked into their family matter, could you?

729
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,870
Even your clothes
reek of hospital smell now!

730
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,830
I don't want it.

731
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,330
Dan, you'll get one from me now!

732
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,950
We're not so petty, you know.

733
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,870
This is how it's gonna be now.

734
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,120
Shiuli...

735
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,450
...you opened your eyes at 5 am today.

736
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,450
You are doing good.

737
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,000
I want you to put
in a little more effort...

738
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:06,200
Shiuli, can you look
to your left, this side.

739
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,700
Your left.

740
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,830
This side.

741
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:25,620
Good!

742
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,660
Can you look to your right?

743
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,000
Very good!

744
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,200
I think this is a
significant development.

745
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,620
Yes Sir, I think she
is trying to communicate.

746
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:13,370
Shiuli, can you do what you did
in the morning again, for your family?

747
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,910
This is your left, and your right.

748
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,500
Can you look to your left...
left... good!

749
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,080
And your right...

750
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,950
...excellent!

751
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,790
Her understanding is faint,

752
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,120
...maybe little commands.

753
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,580
Language comprehension...
don't know to what extent.

754
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:53,330
I mean, to understand words,
retain them and then act on them.

755
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,120
That is, memory retention,
following commands...

756
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,250
We will work on that now.

757
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,370
GCS will determine all that.

758
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,500
Shiuli!

759
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:28,000
Your hair is looking so nice.

760
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:38,120
Shiuli, now get better
soon and let's go home.

761
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,870
It's been long.

762
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,120
Dr.Ghosh!

763
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,410
So, is she fully conscious now?

764
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:12,250
Thallamus... cortex... medulla oblongata...
dorsal plexus of the spine.

765
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,700
The spiritual mix of these
scientific terms is just one... the soul.

766
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,500
And the soul doesn't go into a coma.

767
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,040
The soul is always conscious.

768
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,000
Meaning...

769
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,226
You mean, when will she walk,
when will she eat...

770
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,700
Yes.
...when will she wake up?

771
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,200
For a perfect medical
definition of consciousness,

772
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:36,660
Have patience she's trying.

773
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,000
Left...

774
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:56,250
Right...

775
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,080
Dan...

776
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,330
...you're off to the hospital again?

777
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,200
Aren't you getting
overtly affected by this?

778
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,790
And how come you're so unaffected?

779
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,580
How can you say that?

780
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,870
We do visit her when we can.

781
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:28,410
But that doesn't mean
we get consumed by it.

782
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,870
Wasn't she your best friend?

783
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,620
Of course she is.

784
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,620
But we need to prioritize...
there's career... there's family.

785
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,160
We have to be practical.

786
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,950
Is your name Shiuli?

787
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,450
Yes.

788
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,080
Do you play the piano, Shiuli?

789
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,870
Very good!

790
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,620
Do you know Kaveri?

791
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,500
Yes.

792
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,000
Do you know Kunal?

793
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,910
Yes.

794
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,870
Doctor... Dan.

795
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,750
Shiuli, do you know Dan?

796
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:28,830
Sorry, no response.

797
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,580
Shiuli, I'm going to
press your shoulder now.

798
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,766
She didn't even recognize you.

799
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:41,160
Yeah, that's because the doctor asked her
your entire family history...

800
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,120
Poor thing must have got tired.

801
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,450
In the hotel we work quite
closely with each other.

802
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,120
Still, she didn't recognize you.

803
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,330
Don't you recognize me?

804
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,000
Do you know Dan?

805
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,830
Look left if you recognize me.

806
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,160
Then why didn't you
say so in the morning?

807
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,330
Actually you did the right thing.

808
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh, now I get it why
you didn't, hmmm.

809
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,580
Should I go?

810
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,200
So listen,
if the doctors ask you tomorrow...

811
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:36,370
Do you know Dan, Stick to No.

812
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,370
Can you lend me some money?

813
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,250
How much?

814
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,450
Just enough to fill gas.

815
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,080
Here you go.

816
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,870
Is this good?

817
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,330
A little left of the eyebrow, maybe?

818
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,450
No she looks fine
Just a little bit more... hmmm?

819
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,160
What's happening here?
Nothing at all!

820
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:59,790
Get out!

821
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,386
You'll get me fired!

822
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,200
Do you want your eyebrows to be done?

823
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,950
Out, I say!

824
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,120
Goodnight!

825
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,120
We have to talk to him.

826
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:18,330
The landlord had came over.

827
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,450
I've paid the rent for this month too.

828
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,080
Sorry, mate, I ran out of money.

829
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,870
We pay the maid more
than the stipend you get.

830
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,846
That's because the hotel
guys are cutting my pay.

831
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,120
Of course they would,
since you're hardly on duty!

832
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:40,250
And the restaurant dream?
That's over, right!

833
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,370
Let's talk at home?

834
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,950
Adi is moving in with us.

835
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,080
I can't bear the house expenses alone.

836
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,790
Easy does it.

837
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:34,750
We've warned you before!

838
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,330
Only 55 days on duty
from March to September?

839
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,200
Sir, actually it's 58 days.
Whatever!

840
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,016
And on top of that,
your temperamental issues...

841
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,266
With your co-workers, with guests...

842
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:48,476
Be prepared for the consequences, Dan.

843
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,766
Another hotel and you would've
been shown the door by now.

844
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,790
Now, get out of here!

845
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,330
Dan.

846
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:05,830
It's just a matter of two months.

847
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,120
Try and pull through, somehow.

848
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,870
If you get terminated from here,
no 5-star will touch you.

849
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,950
Focus on your career!

850
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,620
And from tomorrow,
you'll report on time, okay?

851
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,886
Okay, Sir.

852
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,450
Go on, then.

853
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,000
Thank you, Sir.

854
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:40,700
Where are your gloves?

855
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,870
Pay some attention to hygiene.

856
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,556
Do you want it or not?

857
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,176
How dare you take that tone with me?

858
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,120
We are paying for this.

859
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,806
So you take it yourself then. Take it!

860
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:51,926
Why should I?
It's your job to serve me.

861
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:54,176
So serve, with gloves on!
I am... now move on.

862
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,766
Hey, hey, hold on.
You come ahead please.

863
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:58,700
It's my turn,
you have to serve me first!

864
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,390
Oy!
What did you say?

865
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,000
What are you doing? Leave him alone!

866
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,500
You couldn't even
visit us once in 10 months?

867
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,910
And finally I see you here.

868
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:07,580
Otherwise I would've been lost
trying to look for you in the hospital.

869
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,870
They've kicked you out.

870
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,160
We have to pay back
a penalty of three hundred thousand rupees.

871
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:28,080
And three years... wasted!

872
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,870
Mom, I'll figure things out.

873
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,120
Don't try to be over-smart with me, Dan.

874
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,500
Look around you,
you've made this hospital your home.

875
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,790
And all this for what?

876
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,830
What have you done to yourself, Dan?

877
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:52,620
Is she your girlfriend?

878
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,080
Can I meet her?

879
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,796
She must be tired,
that's why she's sleeping...

880
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,040
That's okay. Let her rest.

881
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,870
What you are doing is not easy.

882
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,660
If I were in your place...

883
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:39,370
I don't know if I
could've done the same.

884
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,870
I do break down sometimes...

885
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:50,160
But then I remind myself
that I have to hold it all together.

886
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,750
Dan has been like a pillar.

887
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,330
Children really are
pillars for their parents.

888
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:11,080
But when they grow up...

889
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,750
...they start living
life on their own terms.

890
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,870
And we live in a constant
fear of losing them.

891
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:33,266
Aunty, Dr. Ghosh is in the OPD

892
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,846
...but the files are not there.

893
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,556
They should be there.
No they're not.

894
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:40,056
I have one of them,
but the other one's missing.

895
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,266
How can it not be there?

896
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,540
It's not there, Aunty.

897
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,700
You... you go, Dan.

898
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,330
You have a job... a life.

899
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,240
And your parents have
expectations from you...

900
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,410
Your mother is a good person.

901
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:28,330
I felt quite selfish today.

902
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,966
You please leave.

903
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,660
We'll manage things here.
Don't worry.

904
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,240
Please, Dan.

905
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:30,990
Danish Walia?

906
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,556
Hello, Ma'am.
Hi, I am Priya.

907
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,636
Welcome to La RiSa!

908
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,216
Hope you had a good journey?
Yes, Ma'am.

909
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,346
Ma'am, my recommendation.
Not required.

910
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:41,266
Asthana had called.
He spoke very fondly of you.

911
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:44,846
Hi guys, this is your new manager,
Danish Walia.

912
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:46,490
Danish, this will be your team.

913
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:48,330
Namastey.

914
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,056
So this place has 22 rooms in all.

915
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,490
We have two categories of rooms...

916
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,330
This is the room.

917
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:58,426
It has in-built heating...

918
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,886
You can put the
temperature to your liking.

919
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:06,490
You had asked about the off-road
trails, so this is what we figured out...

920
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:23,290
Let's go.

921
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,040
Put these away in the store room too.

922
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,420
Take these carefully.

923
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,910
Namastey!
Namastey!

924
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:17,656
So, this is the route.

925
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,766
If you follow this,
I think you'll be fine, okay?

926
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,056
Just get there and
Shane will guide you.

927
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,360
Thank you.

928
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:25,360
Bye!

929
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,166
Hello, Aunty!

930
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:36,610
You didn't call,
so I just thought I'll...

931
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,350
The last 3-4 days have
been quite tough, Dan.

932
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:45,120
First Shiuli stopped responding...

933
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,766
Then she had a seizure while sleeping.

934
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,120
So we had to take her back to the ICU.

935
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,466
The doctor says it's common,

936
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:03,620
But if it happens repeatedly, it
can lead to severe cardiac problems.

937
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:16,926
Let's show Amma
that you can do it, Shiuli.

938
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,990
Shiuli... Shiuli!

939
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,546
That's okay...

940
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:21,426
Shiuli...

941
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:22,240
Shiuli...

942
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,120
The physio lady wanted
her to do something.

943
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,990
But she became violent
and scratched herself.

944
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,600
We had to tie her hands...

945
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:47,176
She was so restless yesterday...

946
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,790
...they had to finally sedate her.

947
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,160
But, all this is now
a part of our lives, Dan.

948
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,580
You focus on your work.

949
01:30:58,170 --> 01:30:59,300
Take care.

950
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:52,290
Lift this leg up,
come on, try... Shiuli.

951
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:54,636
Shiuli!

952
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:55,466
Doctor...

953
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,740
Don't you want to go home?

954
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:57,740
Doctor...

955
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,830
Can I just take her out for a bit?

956
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:15,290
I know you're mad at me.

957
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,740
I'll never leave you again.

958
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,240
Don't you want to get better?

959
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,950
Sorry!

960
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:54,700
Sleep now or the
doctor will throw me out.

961
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,230
You've been here for a
few days and you call me now?

962
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,940
Here...

963
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,200
...go home and dump your bags.

964
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:36,870
And take a shower!

965
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,080
Do you know who she is?

966
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,290
Tell me.

967
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,290
Am..ma.

968
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,950
Louder, Shiuli!

969
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,910
Mot... her!

970
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,120
Good!

971
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,716
Make sure there aren't any jerks.

972
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,460
Okay.

973
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,490
This one is not fixed properly.

974
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,056
It's a really good thought.

975
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:34,450
Later, we can make it permanent.

976
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,480
The soup is ready.

977
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:43,290
Keep the curtains open.
The X-rays can go into the desk - Yes.

978
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,160
Write 'C'

979
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:45,910
Aunty, I'm telling you,
you're going easy on her.

980
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,790
Give her tough ones... like 'Q'

981
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:52,330
Write 'Q'.

982
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:59,290
See! She couldn't do it.

983
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:02,410
She's become lazy.
Keep giving her tough ones.

984
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:19,620
I've closed this.

985
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:21,740
You can go now.

986
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,580
Did you ever want to go, far away?

987
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,240
Where would you go?

988
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,580
Never imagined you'd
go into a coma, did you?

989
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,240
Can I ask you something?

990
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:02,240
That night... when
you fell from the terrace...

991
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:10,160
Why did you ask "Where is Dan?"

992
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,080
Dan!

993
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,740
Dan!

994
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:07,580
It's so cold today.

995
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:13,080
You leave,
It's going to be quite foggy today.

996
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,160
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

997
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:26,040
Bye, Aunty!

998
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:55,036
Send a relative to
the local health center,

999
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:57,616
They'll give you the death
certificate. I'll sign it.

1000
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,350
Okay.

1001
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:05,810
She had a seizure around 2 am.

1002
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,310
Then her lungs collapsed.

1003
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:18,600
In half an hour, sister was gone.

1004
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,930
Shiuli Iyer.

1005
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:53,220
Shiuli Iyer, right?

1006
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:56,020
Please check... the time, date, etc.

1007
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,220
Sign here.

1008
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,100
Thank you.

1009
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:26,220
Sister was a fighter, right Mom?

1010
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,470
You asked why we named
her Shiuli?

1011
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,060
She loved the Night Jasmine flower.

1012
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,560
Every year Shiuli would
eagerly await October...

1013
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,220
That's when these flowers bloom.

1014
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:57,850
All night long they'd fall.

1015
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:03,470
And she would collect them
on a sheet with her grandfather.

1016
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:06,310
A mountain of flowers.

1017
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:12,890
They have a very short life...

1018
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,470
So just like them, she fell too.

1019
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:30,246
Mom, I have to go to the tutor's...
or should I skip it?

1020
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:32,020
No, you should go.

1021
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,060
One Penne Arabiatta.

1022
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:53,930
One Roasted Salmon.

1023
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,060
So what are you up to these days?

1024
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:32,770
After Shiuli... the hotel
hired me back.

1025
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:39,180
I got my diploma in six months
and have been a sous chef since.

1026
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,930
You said focus on your work...

1027
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:54,720
...so that's what I've been doing.

1028
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,946
Some days I really
want to talk about her,

1029
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:04,616
But who I can talk to?

1030
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,560
Don't want to upset them.

1031
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:13,810
I haven't spoken about
her with anyone either.

1032
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:22,180
Planning to shift to our
Home-town in the south.

1033
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:31,500
We have extended family there...
another two weeks perhaps.

1034
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,350
So you're leaving?

1035
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:47,680
I don't want to leave the
Night Jasmine tree here, unattended...

1036
01:46:57,770 --> 01:46:59,520
I'll take it with me...

1037
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:03,410
...don't worry.
