1
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,934
I am Hindustan

2
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,239
The Himalayas
watch over my borders

3
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:50,243
The waters of the holy Ganges
I have sworn by

4
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:54,816
Since the beginning of time,
darkness and light...

5
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,148
have been my companions

6
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,823
The foundations of marbled monuments
that rise from my ashes...

7
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:05,827
lie embedded in deeper depths
than of Earth herself

8
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:11,470
I was plundered by barbarians
and saved by the merciful

9
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,173
The unwise tied me in chains.
Those who loved me have freed me

10
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:27,520
Of those who loved this land,
one was Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar

11
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:34,287
Akbar transcended the barriers
of religion and tradition

12
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:41,358
He taught man to love his fellow man.
Thus he embraced this country

13
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:47,198
This is Emperor Akbar's palace

14
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,615
In this palace live
stories of the past

15
00:04:55,217 --> 00:05:03,352
Some four centuries ago,
far from this grand palace...

16
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:13,231
a man walked through the burning sands
of the sunswept desert barefoot

17
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:19,896
This man who walks alone
is Emperor Akbar

18
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:30,811
There is sadness in his eyes,
for he has not yet fathered an heir

19
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:42,252
Akbar is travelling to meet
the Holy One, Salimuddin Chisti

20
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:53,070
He travels in hope that the blessings
of the Holy One may beget him an heir

21
00:05:55,377 --> 00:06:03,443
The royal procession follows. But
Akbar walks. For he has taken the vow

22
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,280
Finally, the destination
is arrived at

23
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:21,301
The Emperor before whom the world
bows to, stands before a mendicant

24
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:28,101
Seek as one should seek, for God
never refuses the faithful

25
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,413
Raise your hands in prayer,
and I shall pray with you

26
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,815
O'Emperor of Emperors, Thou hast
bestowed upon this humble man...

27
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:48,990
every blessing that
life has to offer

28
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:54,564
I have heard people call me
their emperor

29
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:00,675
Now, please let me hear
the word father

30
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:09,341
O'Lord of Heaven and Earth,
let Akbar not die without an heir

31
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,684
May Jodha be made fertile
by His grace

32
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:49,087
Felicitations! Felicitations
to the Emperor

33
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,826
The Lord has blessed
the Queen's womb

34
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:57,689
The Emperor has a son,
and the Empire an heir

35
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,067
Allah be praised!

36
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,907
You bring happy tidings
to a sad Akbar!

37
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:13,575
Keep this ring. Keep it with you
as a mark of my promise

38
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:22,754
By the sacred scales of Justice,
I swear

39
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,753
Whatever you seek of Akbar,
for once in your life...

40
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,964
shall be given

41
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:41,998
With the passage of time, the prince
began to develop certain tastes

42
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:52,953
Prince...

43
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,948
These scales are not meant
for you to play with

44
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,123
Are they for The Emperor to play with?
- No. The sacred scales are...

45
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:07,458
a memorial to Emperor Babar,
and they signify Mughal justice

46
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,259
How profound

47
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:14,170
This is what you have to speak
in court. Memorise it

48
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:18,068
Is this a command?
- No, a request

49
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,210
Then I shall try

50
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:26,816
The Prince became
more and more disobedient

51
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:33,225
And he began to transgress the limits
of etiquette and protocol

52
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,299
Take it away, with all due respect

53
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:50,845
One day, Prince Salim, the heir to
the Mughal throne took to drinking

54
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:13,690
Emperor Akbar realised that
a dark future awaited Hindustan

55
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,116
The symbol of Mughal justice shall not
be a wayward Prince's plaything

56
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,143
Man Singh

57
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:39,351
No more for him, the security
of his mother's love

58
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,252
Cast him in steel

59
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:49,133
Take him away. Temper the steel
in the desert fires

60
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:03,915
I entrust you with the future
of the Mughal Empire

61
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:16,417
For a child it's a mother's lap,
not the shadow of war

62
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:25,033
Lord, grant me that my love may shield
my son from the enemy swords

63
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,964
The Prince sends his chain of mail
from the battlefield

64
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:33,201
My Salim!

65
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:40,750
Salim has lived up to my expectations.
I am pleased

66
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,054
Salim! My son!

67
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:55,965
You are the Empress of Hindustan!

68
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:04,404
No, O'Mighty One. A mother
is nothing more than a mother

69
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:12,344
The frailty of a mother's emotions
overcomes Empress Jodha?

70
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:18,350
That she forgets her status?
This I knew not

71
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:24,058
What political prerogatives
that forbid...

72
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:31,824
a mother to long for a son
being bled callously?

73
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:37,033
Suffer then, but not in tears

74
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:46,014
Were all mothers whose sons are on the
battlefield with yours, to break down...

75
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,818
then Hindustan will be
drowned in tears

76
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,728
As much gold as the Prince's chain of
mail weighs, be distributed to charity

77
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:20,748
For 14 years Salim was tempered amidst
the storms of battle in the deserts

78
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:10,014
Why have the Prince's wounds
not been dressed yet?

79
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,226
We haven't been given permission
to enter

80
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,452
May I beg to be excused?

81
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,697
May the Prince's wounds
not be dressed?

82
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:33,221
Not wounds. These are flowers.
Nature rules that flowers shall wilt

83
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,870
Hear this

84
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,153
Not just an assassin'
this has a heart too

85
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,720
This is as much a branch of a tree
as it is a sword

86
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:48,926
Surely, this dumb sword is
no princess for a romance?

87
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:52,705
Not merely with the eyes of a soldier
do I see this piece of steel

88
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:57,567
Not that soldier who wields the sword
only in bloodletting

89
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,723
Then what is it that
the Prince wields?

90
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:10,629
In my hand, this dancing blade is like
a woman in throes, in her lover's arms

91
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:16,660
Then rises the blood, that spreads
in a blush over her face

92
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:26,817
Poetry, even after fourteen years
of bloodletting... strange

93
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,911
There is nothing strange

94
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,974
Were Omar Khayyam's anthology,
the Rubaiyat...

95
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:35,431
to have been etched on stone, not
to have been timed for recitation...

96
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,519
would it's meaning be any the less?
- No

97
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:46,144
Then those designs that The Mighty One
may have for me, are founded in error

98
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:55,137
The armour you wore to the victory
is to be presented to The Mighty One

99
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,292
Are these years of my bloodied youth
not enough?

100
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:10,032
Not the armour. Rather this story
of my life, bloodied and in ashes

101
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:17,085
And my son shall present this story
of your life to The Mighty One

102
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,149
Ride with the despatch

103
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,618
Attention all ye

104
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,204
The Mighty One's foresight
has been proved right again

105
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:38,843
The Prince has emerged victorious
again

106
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:44,512
Does he carry the wounds of battle?

107
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:49,317
Several. Countless swords
he has braved and broken

108
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:52,083
And every enemy sword proved
again and again...

109
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:54,979
the Prince's valour, and the might
of the blood of Akbar

110
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,322
I shall inspect Salim's armour

111
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:03,136
Instead of the armour, the Prince
sends The Mighty One this missive

112
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,240
Read it out. Loudly

113
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:12,089
Before the Emperor of Hindustan,
Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar, I bow

114
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:16,095
Before You, I present this account...

115
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:21,604
of every yard of the terrain
steeped in Your royal blood

116
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,042
For fourteen years the fires of war
that ravaged this land...

117
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,874
sucked from my veins Your blood
that these fires took to quench

118
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:39,181
But Your Salim has still blood left,
to bloody the Deccan plateau...

119
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:46,075
should You so command.
In subservience, Your Salim

120
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,291
Allah be praised

121
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,236
From Salim I take heart

122
00:17:53,347 --> 00:18:02,111
Prince Noor-ud-din Mohammed Salim
be ordered to march for home

123
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,037
Felicitations to The Mighty One
on Prince Salim's return

124
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,189
Felicitations!

125
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:27,206
Lord, why are you still silent?
Just let me see Salim's face

126
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:32,286
The Emperor has ordered Durjan Singh
to bring the Prince back immediately

127
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,362
You are the bearer of news
that turns tears to smiles!

128
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:46,589
Pearls, Bahar! Pearls for your words!
- Far too little, Your Majesty

129
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,422
I want the Prince to walk over
a carpet of pearls

130
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,793
For Salim, anything!

131
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:59,520
My son is coming home after years!
I shall pray to The Mighty One...

132
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,199
that He lets my son be with me
for a few days

133
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:10,264
His father's politics he has learnt;
his mother's love he hasn't known

134
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,747
Tell the courtesans to choreograph
a performance beautiful enough...

135
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:21,500
to make Salim forget
the pictures of war

136
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:26,954
Tell the court musician Tansen
to write tunes so dulcet...

137
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:30,580
to make Salim forget
the thunder of cannon

138
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:37,911
And flowers, Bahar! Flowers for him!
And light up the city!

139
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:45,731
Stars for him to tread upon, and
a heaven as far as the eye beholds!

140
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:52,905
O'everything! Everything I want
for him! And everything I cannot say

141
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:10,473
Lord! Bring me to that moment when
I may behold my son before my eyes!

142
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,941
Then for a moment, You too
I shall forget

143
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,317
Sculptor

144
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:30,946
The jewel of the palace
in my humble workshop?

145
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:34,179
I have to choose a sculpture
for the Prince

146
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:45,104
The sculptures I carve,
Princes and Emperors cannot appreciate

147
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,184
Why?
- For they speak the truth

148
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:54,958
Behold, the court where every word
spoken by The Emperor is law...

149
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:59,879
against which, there is no appeal

150
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,649
And this, the field of battle

151
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:09,113
The blood of innocents,
for the victory of one man

152
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:13,177
This is the price of truth

153
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,586
Punishment by death.
- Not true, sculptor

154
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,319
May I present to the artiste
a rhetoric?

155
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:27,400
Meaning?
- Whereas I appreciate your art...

156
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,587
what art is it that touches
not the heart?

157
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,033
What figurine therefore,
which fails to woo the vain?

158
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:42,789
Then at the feet of the idol I sculpt
the soldier shall lay down his sword...

159
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,590
Emperors shall lay down
their crowns...

160
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,246
and men will carve out
their hearts in oblation

161
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,348
What have you done?

162
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,674
The crown is to be presented
to the wearer

163
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:22,472
The hands that crown are others'
but the courage is one's own

164
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,766
Bahar, have you no fear that
someone might see you?

165
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:28,537
Fear?

166
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,602
No crown is worn on a head that fears

167
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,925
You wish to become the Empress
of this grand empire?

168
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:39,614
How many girls would be
dreaming the same?

169
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,928
Then let them dream

170
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,679
Look at my eyes
- Such beautiful eyes!

171
00:22:55,969 --> 00:23:00,240
Like the drunken reveller
who jabs his sword at the skies...

172
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:06,527
are you too aiming for the stars?
- Stars do fall out of the skies

173
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:12,683
For vain princes,
one look of the eye is enough

174
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,676
As with death, so also with
the hearts of Princes

175
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,929
You can never know when

176
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:23,328
I wish for it the soonest

177
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:32,961
Your Majesty, two hours for sunrise.
The last pearl for the night

178
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,657
The price may be paid

179
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:21,202
Shall The Mighty One welcome
His son in battle-gear?

180
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:27,663
Not my son. I go to greet
a great soldier of Hindustan

181
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:45,580
I have not seen Salim grown up.
Do not present him to me unannounced

182
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,929
News of the Prince!
He has entered the palace

183
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:40,373
May I be rewarded?

184
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:48,652
The Emperor welcomed
the Prince Himself!

185
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:53,366
Before he could bow,
The Emperor embraced him!

186
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:59,708
The Prince has crossed the Inner Court.
The slaves have sighted him

187
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,855
At every step, he is being showered
with flowers

188
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:05,363
He is firm in his step,
as he walks in here

189
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:14,143
The Emperor has granted permission
to the Prince to enter alone

190
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:20,885
The Prince has arrived

191
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:28,639
O'joyous world!
Or, are my eyes swimming?

192
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:32,397
Bahar! Hold me!

193
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:42,489
After so many years!
I wonder how he will say Mother?

194
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:47,630
For me, a new sound!

195
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:54,989
That word will resound in my ears
and it will resonate in my heart

196
00:26:57,274 --> 00:27:00,034
O'heart, miss not a beat!

197
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,818
Mother

198
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,514
Open your eyes, Mother.
Look at me. I am here

199
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,615
Salim, you've grown so big!

200
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,075
I was used to seeing you
when you were just knee-high

201
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:59,661
Bend down, Salim.
Kneel down

202
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,972
Great soldier, are you?

203
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,224
You bled my blood upon
this earth... callously?

204
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:18,535
Without as much as a thought
to what it'd do...

205
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,746
to your mother's heart
to see these scars?

206
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:27,057
Had you remembered your mother
in battle...

207
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,464
you would've heard my lullabies
through the clangor of swords...

208
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:36,075
and you'd be as secure as
you'd be in your mother's lap

209
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,855
But you never remembered me

210
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:51,775
Salim, my love!

211
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:57,323
Bahar, take him away from me!

212
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:24,867
The heart awaits a glance
The foot awaits a step

213
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,555
Who is it that hides from me?

214
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:01,622
Not hides. Is hidden, Your Highness.
- Why?

215
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,988
The sculptor's challenge.
When this candle is unveiled...

216
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:11,592
Shall it be irresistible?
Challenges are interesting, sometimes

217
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:15,538
He claims that at its feet,
soldiers shall lay down swords...

218
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:20,643
Emperors their crowns, and men will
carve out their hearts in oblation

219
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:24,247
The sculptor's claim is much too
arrogant for appreciation

220
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,595
I must see how vain art can be

221
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,612
The Mighty One would rather
that you didn't see it

222
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,004
Why?
- The court astrologer says...

223
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:36,772
it augurs ill for the Prince to set
his eyes on any sculpture...

224
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:41,389
before the moon has set tonight.
The unveiling may be done tomorrow

225
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:46,311
In the presence of The Mighty One.
- The sculptor's challenge...

226
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:51,980
the astrologer's warning...
and this veiled sculpture

227
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:55,362
How can I wait till daybreak?

228
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:13,218
The sculptor's claim is correct

229
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:20,948
Only on stone can be etched
so stark a beauty

230
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,563
I must bow before such creativity

231
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:32,737
The Prince may be accused of idolatry.
- And lauded for appreciation of art

232
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,082
Nadira, the sculpture isn't ready yet.
You must pose for it tomorrow again

233
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:33,838
The Prince has seen me.
He has expressed his appreciation

234
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:35,989
There is an ardour veiled
in that appreciation

235
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,366
Ardour? Of whom?
- You

236
00:33:58,194 --> 00:33:59,914
Attention

237
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:06,033
The Emperor cometh

238
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:10,992
Your slave wishes
to present a proposition

239
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:12,219
You may

240
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:16,565
Stories are told of statues
unveiled using the arrow

241
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,617
Interesting proposition

242
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,547
Prince, may stories be made
to come true?

243
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,235
As You command, Your Majesty

244
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:14,835
Great!

245
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:21,484
An angel from the heavens
cast in marble

246
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:34,414
Not an angel. Human

247
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:41,814
Who has made you pose
for the statue?

248
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,794
One of Your sculptors.
He was persistent

249
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,116
But he wishes anonymity

250
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:53,120
His strange sense of the arts
is surely laudable

251
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:58,820
But that arrow was aimed at you.
How come you stood still?

252
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:05,592
I wanted to see how stories
are made to come true

253
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:10,091
Well spoken, and I laud
your courage

254
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Empress, you may take her in
as your handmaiden

255
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:22,194
I name her Anarkali

256
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:31,034
Tomorrow, we celebrate
the birth of Lord Krishna

257
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:33,185
She will dance

258
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:37,411
My word

259
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:44,394
Krishna teased me on the
banks of the Jamuna...

260
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:48,710
Krishna teased me on
the banks of Jamuna...

261
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:53,854
He twisted my delicate wrists

262
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:14,702
Krishna teased me on
the banks of the Jamuna

263
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:44,983
He cast a pebble at me,
and broke my pitcher

264
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,590
He broke my pitcher...

265
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:59,240
He left me drenched

266
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:11,072
Krishna teased me
on the riverbanks...

267
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:38,360
With his eyes, he cast a spell;
he won my heart

268
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,563
He won my heart

269
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:49,141
With his eyes, he cast a spell;
he won my heart

270
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:56,650
He won my heart...

271
00:40:57,613 --> 00:41:04,229
My veil he pierced
with a mere look

272
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:24,465
On the riverbanks,
Krishna teased me

273
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:20,062
What is it, Suraiya?
- Someone is in love

274
00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:24,950
You are.
- You're insane

275
00:42:26,162 --> 00:42:28,619
Who am I in love with?
- With the one who's in love with you

276
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,486
Allah! Who is it?

277
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:33,550
The Prince!
- Hush!

278
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:37,246
Started making commands already?
When you become the Empress...

279
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:45,872
For God's sake, show me not dreams
that a slave dares not dream

280
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:52,338
He is the Crown Prince. The future
Emperor of Hindustan

281
00:42:52,742 --> 00:43:01,269
So what? Allah makes Emperors of men,
but their Empresses can be anyone

282
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:06,503
You're naive. Can the earth
ever touch the skies?

283
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:09,302
Then, what do you want to be?

284
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,999
Just a slave.
- The Prince's slave

285
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:18,945
Not again! What if someone hears?
- This is love!

286
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:21,597
If not today, people will
come to know tomorrow

287
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:23,439
I know

288
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:25,595
Then why be afraid of
getting a bad name?

289
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:32,341
I'm not afraid of getting a bad name.
I don't want him to get a bad name

290
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,210
If this is what you believe,
you've had it!

291
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:37,676
Get up, come with me

292
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,551
Where?
- To him

293
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,544
His eyes are craving to see you

294
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:52,362
I cannot face anyone now.
Just let me hide in here

295
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:57,167
Go on, hide. I have the confidence
to go and face him

296
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:03,173
Have you lost your senses?

297
00:44:03,828 --> 00:44:05,666
That is just what I have to ask
the Prince

298
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:08,716
One look at him, and people
lose their senses. Why?

299
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,960
To speak my heart before him
would amount to transgression

300
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,956
That'd be if neither had he
a wish in his heart

301
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:23,595
But in the state of ardour he's in,
will he have any sense of propriety?

302
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,815
What is the matter?
Why are you calling Suraiya?

303
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,732
Oh I'm so afraid, Mother!

304
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:42,010
Why are you here?
- I just came...

305
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:44,943
By whose permission?
- By let of my heart

306
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,224
Begone!
- I won't

307
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,839
Let her be, Durjan

308
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:54,337
What do you want?
- I wanted to see...

309
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:57,388
why people lose their senses
when they see you

310
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:59,535
Who says so?
- My sister. Nadira

311
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:01,754
She's out of her mind
ever since she saw you

312
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:02,984
Impertinence!

313
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:05,089
My name is Suraiya

314
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:07,635
Does your sister call you
by that name?

315
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,012
She used to.
- And now?

316
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:13,402
She has forgotten all else!
The only name on her lips is...

317
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:15,553
Prince

318
00:45:22,522 --> 00:45:24,800
Give your sister
this message from me

319
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:35,887
This could be fraught with danger!
- Fall in love, and you will lose fear

320
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:57,380
What are you so completely lost in?

321
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:00,525
Letter

322
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,755
What letter?
- From the Prince

323
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:05,015
Allah!

324
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:07,425
If you pray to Allah,
you might get another letter

325
00:46:07,737 --> 00:46:10,067
Take care, it's throbbing

326
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,253
Maybe, it's his heart

327
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:18,328
Take it

328
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:25,166
No

329
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:29,449
You lose no time in giving your heart
away. And you lose heart so easily?

330
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,292
I woke up to find Anarkali
in my soul

331
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:15,184
And I was in love

332
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:18,451
Do you know?

333
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,831
A sadness hangs heavy
on my restless heart

334
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:28,120
Day and night I think
of you and my desire

335
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:33,235
Allah forbid!

336
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:36,310
He loves me!

337
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,075
Sleepless nights I wake for you

338
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:49,372
Waiting by the canal

339
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:53,249
Send me a flower
Send me a reply

340
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:56,026
Let it float down the waters

341
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:59,715
Forget you, I cannot

342
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:02,496
Pray, send me a reply

343
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:58,479
A refusal?

344
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:03,845
Reason?

345
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:07,783
Because she's a slave girl.
And unfortunately, I'm a Prince

346
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,313
And places may not be traded

347
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:14,902
But I am human. That too is true

348
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,647
Have you been waiting for me
to cross the limits?

349
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:04,082
Your Highness, in our happiness,
we reach out for the stars

350
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:08,216
But do the stars ever
come down to earth?

351
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,987
For I have desired

352
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:15,055
For God's sake, do not
denigrate your status!

353
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,917
You are my master

354
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:19,980
I... am your slave

355
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:23,370
This wall that separates you and me,
I want to pull down

356
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,172
Sit down, Anarkali

357
00:51:32,152 --> 00:51:33,527
Your Majesty...

358
00:51:46,966 --> 00:51:49,791
Anarkali, look at me

359
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,880
I wish to see the desire
in your eyes

360
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,878
No, not my eyes

361
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:05,808
For I have nothing but
the fearful emotions of a slave girl

362
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:09,819
Then forget that you are a slave.
And in your eyes...

363
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,890
let Salim see for himself
that which you fear to voice

364
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:17,514
Do not take away from me, my dreams

365
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,206
It'd kill me!

366
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:26,571
I'll make these dreams come true

367
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,914
Your Majesty...!
- Let them see

368
00:52:37,848 --> 00:52:41,848
Taunts I can live with;
not your dishonour

369
00:53:33,287 --> 00:53:38,822
Give me an indication Lord
...what is to become now?

370
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:56,099
What does this couplet mean?

371
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:07,896
My heart is slipping
out of my hands

372
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:16,832
Oh, let not my agony
poison the lives of everyone

373
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:21,330
God knows what's come over you.
Don't you even feel Ionely?

374
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,811
And he's always asking about you.
Get up and come with me

375
00:54:25,124 --> 00:54:29,461
No, I am afraid...

376
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:34,423
lest my eyes give away...

377
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,272
the secrets in my heart

378
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:53,483
Nadira, why have you been
so depressed of late?

379
00:54:54,321 --> 00:54:59,824
If you stop socialising, people will
accuse you of having become vain...

380
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:03,367
ever since you were named Anarkali
by The Emperor

381
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:08,084
Allah! Would someone so helpless
be vain?

382
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:13,600
Can you stop tongues from wagging?
Little do you know palace intrigue

383
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,108
Welcome Bahar

384
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:19,238
You should take her under your wing.
- You mustn't worry

385
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:24,588
I have come to take her with me.
- Take good care of her

386
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:33,459
Anarkali... your new name
is so beautiful

387
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:36,294
Indeed

388
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:42,701
As of pretty candles that feed
their wax to the flames

389
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,996
Then why fear the firefly?

390
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:48,496
Fireflies...?

391
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:50,036
Like me

392
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,900
Maybe you could join me
during my performances?

393
00:55:53,457 --> 00:55:54,370
Performance...?

394
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:57,241
Tonight. It's a recitation contest

395
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,376
Wouldn't it be nice if you were
to take a part of the stage?

396
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:03,280
And the other...?
- Me

397
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:06,482
And...
- Which of us wins...

398
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:09,309
is left to the Prince's discretion

399
00:56:55,853 --> 00:57:01,658
In your court,
I will try my destiny

400
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:09,033
For a few moments, I will see
what it means to be close to you

401
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:27,473
In your court...
I will try my destiny too

402
00:57:29,164 --> 00:57:34,415
At your feet,
I will lay my head

403
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:56,045
Spring comes bearing
the news of love

404
00:57:57,959 --> 00:58:03,733
After ages, I see hope

405
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:16,886
After ages, I see hope

406
00:58:17,257 --> 00:58:22,476
I will save myself
from the agony...

407
00:58:35,603 --> 00:58:41,219
What fun is a life
bereft of any grief?

408
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:49,514
What fun in shedding tears,
without any grief?

409
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:04,788
I will shed tears in love

410
00:59:10,052 --> 00:59:15,081
In your court,
I will try my destiny too

411
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:31,531
This is what happens
to those who fall in love

412
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:39,304
They suffer in silence...
and die a miserable death

413
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:53,374
I will see this farce
and amuse myself

414
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:03,917
In your court,
I will try my destiny too

415
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:18,943
Love, I concede,
ruins your life

416
01:00:21,529 --> 01:00:29,084
But isn't it enough that you are
remembered long after you are dead?

417
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:44,238
I will ruin myself
for my love

418
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:52,654
At your feet,
I will lay my head

419
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,661
A few moments, I will
spend with you

420
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:05,681
In your court,
I will try my destiny too

421
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:25,314
To love in secret, to die for love
...the lover's dream

422
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:29,002
I shall watch it with a smile
come the day

423
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:33,678
Like this flower

424
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:45,230
And you Anarkali, would rather
be in love and be ruined

425
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:52,050
For what more can one ask for
but remembrance, after one is gone

426
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,631
What you get is the thorn

427
01:01:55,747 --> 01:01:57,401
I am fortunate

428
01:02:01,954 --> 01:02:04,196
Thorns live not in fear of wilting

429
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:38,810
What is it, Man Singh?

430
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:42,811
Documents relating to Ajmer province.
At the disposal of The Mighty One

431
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:45,930
At my disposal?
- Yes

432
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:52,331
Does Man Singh not know that
I have given away the province?

433
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:55,879
I know, Your Majesty.
- Then why the documents?

434
01:02:56,241 --> 01:03:01,018
I am forced to draw Your attention.
Unless the mandate is issued...

435
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:05,235
the province might rise in revolt.
- So it has gone this far?

436
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:09,590
Have you not apprised the Prince
of his responsibility?

437
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:14,215
They were presented to the Prince
on several occasions. But...

438
01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:17,558
What is it, Man Singh?
- But the reason for his reluctance...

439
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,425
I have failed to fathom.
- Then I shall!

440
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:28,259
Durjan, you will carry my word
to the governor of Ajmer

441
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:35,011
The works are to commence immediately.
Tell him that I wish...

442
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:41,230
to be apprised of the reason
for this negligence

443
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:58,095
I'll tell her that.
- And also tell her...

444
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:01,698
that without her, Salim's life
is as dark as the night

445
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:06,546
And...?
- Also that in the wait...

446
01:04:06,878 --> 01:04:10,028
Salim is sinking into oblivion.
- And...?

447
01:04:11,756 --> 01:04:14,093
That...

448
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,707
And The Emperor has decreed that
the works be commenced immediately

449
01:04:26,383 --> 01:04:31,317
Do you bear animosity towards love?
- I bear you goodwill, Your Highness

450
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,912
If you bear goodwill towards others,
you might receive letters too

451
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,097
Silence!
- I'm Suraiya. You are too forgetful

452
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:50,546
Sire, I have seen anger
in The Emperor's eyes

453
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:56,993
Unless you stop this dangerous game,
the rumours will begin

454
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,624
Sister...

455
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:08,691
What's wrong with you, Suraiya?
- Why don't you look at me?

456
01:05:09,015 --> 01:05:15,675
Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- You know it. Your sister is lost

457
01:05:16,096 --> 01:05:20,406
Then stay lost. I don't have the time
for running errands for people.

458
01:05:20,733 --> 01:05:21,491
Goodbye

459
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:22,627
Wait!

460
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:26,125
Did you meet him?
- Yes, I did

461
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:31,840
What was he saying?
- Lost? And yet so mindful?

462
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:35,454
Get lost. I won't tell you.
- If you don't, you're my pallbearer

463
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:39,774
I met the Prince in the garden.
- And then?

464
01:05:43,658 --> 01:05:48,031
Looked like he hadn't slept all night.
He smiled. Then he asked me...

465
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:51,204
how is your sister?
- And then?

466
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:55,655
Then he holds my hands
and he asks...

467
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:58,640
Say Suraiya, she must be
as ill as I am...?

468
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,736
What did you say?

469
01:06:01,502 --> 01:06:03,116
I said it!

470
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:06,259
Then he stepped forward
and he kissed my forehead

471
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,938
And then what happened?
- He said, tell your sister that...

472
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:15,343
tonight when Tansen sings,
ask her to come to see me

473
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,122
A blush? After that kiss?

474
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:25,971
Is it because he kissed me there too?
- Oh! I forgot

475
01:06:26,363 --> 01:06:31,214
Such a delightful mistake!
But he kissed my forehead twice

476
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,752
Someone must be watching!

477
01:11:49,865 --> 01:11:55,046
The intruder shall see me
in my chamber

478
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,784
At your command

479
01:12:38,232 --> 01:12:43,412
I rue my fate that the dagger
failed to find its mark

480
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:50,565
Your Highness, do give the dagger
one more chance

481
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:54,395
There is much blood that
flows through my bosom

482
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:20,892
What carries the flame?
- Silenced tales of a night past

483
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:23,156
And some secrets

484
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:29,708
Which is why, it will be put out
as soon as the day breaks

485
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:31,260
Your Highness!

486
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:34,172
A secret you too have tried
to unravel

487
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:38,708
And thus shall you be silenced

488
01:13:41,535 --> 01:13:43,247
You may leave

489
01:14:03,014 --> 01:14:04,947
Anarkali (pomegranate blossoms)

490
01:14:06,771 --> 01:14:10,108
The trees in the garden are flowering

491
01:14:11,567 --> 01:14:14,018
Maybe Your Majesty has not noticed

492
01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:28,277
Yes, I have not seen Anarkali
in a long while

493
01:14:29,254 --> 01:14:35,275
Her plaintive voice may soothe
my laboured mind

494
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:37,994
Summon her

495
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:43,081
She cannot. Not at this time.
- Reason?

496
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,384
Anarkali shall sit beside Salim
as the Empress of Hindustan

497
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:52,250
Let not the dust at your feet
rise to touch your crown

498
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:56,458
It is done. I can see it

499
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,874
Akbar's Hindustan you shall inherit.
- For God's sake!

500
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:07,732
The fate of the people of Hindustan
you shall decide

501
01:15:09,102 --> 01:15:13,951
Wherever you look, a thousand souls
will stand in awe

502
01:15:14,935 --> 01:15:17,031
And your mercy they shall seek

503
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:33,719
The Emperor!

504
01:15:35,925 --> 01:15:40,420
No! You must not commit such trespass
before The Emperor! Let me go!

505
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,862
The Emperor cometh

506
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:51,539
If His Majesty sees me here,
Anarkali dies in your arms!

507
01:15:51,865 --> 01:15:54,770
Untrue to love you are, if you live
in fear. It's debauchery, it's sin

508
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:48,385
Out of the way!
- I won't!

509
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,231
Where is he?

510
01:18:20,213 --> 01:18:22,198
Who?
- Emperor Akbar, at whose command...

511
01:18:22,522 --> 01:18:26,406
life that Allah giveth is snubbed out!
- You shall speak in courtesy, Salim

512
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:30,517
It is not Salim's Anarkali who may
suffer death in a despot's dungeon!

513
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:32,830
I will have his seal
on this order of acquittal

514
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:34,858
Anarkali may not be set free

515
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,118
Why not?

516
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:39,986
Silence! The Crown Prince may not
be oblivious of his duty

517
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:44,222
What duty calls for stifling
the love in one's heart?

518
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:46,755
To do The Emperor's bidding
is your duty

519
01:18:47,078 --> 01:18:52,451
This is no duty! But it surely is
punishment of being born of an Emperor

520
01:18:52,773 --> 01:18:57,424
Then this noblesse oblige
you shall have to suffer

521
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:01,969
Then imprison her not, and grant
the same to that innocent Anarkali

522
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:07,001
You've no right to direct my decision.
- But over my own life, I have a right

523
01:19:07,866 --> 01:19:13,649
If Anarkali be not acquitted, then
tonight augurs dear not for Anarkali...

524
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,578
but for Emperor Akbar and his dreams

525
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,792
I weep for the falsehood of love

526
01:20:24,294 --> 01:20:30,158
I weep for the falsehood of love

527
01:20:31,236 --> 01:20:37,736
I am hurt, I weep

528
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:48,149
I weep for the falsehood of love

529
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:04,246
I gave it not another thought...

530
01:21:05,196 --> 01:21:11,403
my desire for you
has led to my downfall

531
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:19,397
I weep for the patronage
you extended

532
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:27,216
I weep for the lies
about love

533
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:35,486
I am hurt, I weep

534
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:55,493
How was I to know
what it would lead to?

535
01:21:56,038 --> 01:22:02,150
That I'd have to hide my love,
and yet lead my life

536
01:22:04,624 --> 01:22:10,522
I live, but I weep
at my life

537
01:22:13,177 --> 01:22:18,848
I cry for those falsehoods
of love

538
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:24,537
I am hurt, I cry

539
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:36,086
I cry for those falsehoods
of love

540
01:22:39,783 --> 01:22:42,709
Orders. Anarkali is to be produced
in court

541
01:23:49,186 --> 01:23:59,560
Surely the darkness of the dungeons
has dashed your splendid dreams?

542
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:04,363
The darkness was far less than the
light I carry in my heart dispels

543
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:12,287
You may suffer worse darkness

544
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:14,771
And resolve may harden

545
01:24:15,665 --> 01:24:18,753
Resolve may be crushed

546
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,255
The Emperor's justice?

547
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:24,430
I wish to hear no more

548
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,903
Akbar's word is the law

549
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,454
You must forget Salim

550
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,847
Forget Salim?
- Beyond doubt

551
01:24:36,211 --> 01:24:42,926
Not only that. You must convince him
that you were never in love with him

552
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:54,103
I could bring not my tongue to speak
of my love to him. How can I refute?

553
01:24:54,485 --> 01:24:56,787
You will have to prove...

554
01:24:58,272 --> 01:25:00,660
that your love was untrue

555
01:25:03,038 --> 01:25:06,730
A slave dreamt of becoming
the Empress of Hindustan

556
01:25:07,046 --> 01:25:10,888
And in love she found a pretty alibi.
- This is not true!

557
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,823
Allah knows! This is not true!

558
01:25:15,378 --> 01:25:16,314
Not true!

559
01:25:16,515 --> 01:25:19,345
What you have to prove is that
this is the truth

560
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:23,457
Lord!

561
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,869
Grant me such courage...

562
01:25:29,581 --> 01:25:31,937
that I may even betray the Prince

563
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:43,523
Your slave shall try to obey
your command

564
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,447
Not try

565
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:47,687
You shall abide

566
01:25:52,494 --> 01:25:54,376
Set her free

567
01:25:58,088 --> 01:26:02,654
No one has ever known Emperor Akbar
to renege on His verdict

568
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,718
Anarkali's acquittal is a defeat
for The Emperor

569
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:11,914
Not defeat. It's proof that
at heart, The Emperor is humane

570
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,170
For the first time, I think of myself
not merely as the Crown Prince...

571
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:18,555
but also as the son of a father
who is humane

572
01:26:18,892 --> 01:26:20,890
In Anarkali's acquittal, He has
conferred a privilege...

573
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,059
to the woman I love.
- Not love, Your Highness

574
01:26:24,753 --> 01:26:26,717
A privilege for deceit

575
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:28,997
Deceit? Whose?

576
01:26:29,692 --> 01:26:31,655
Ask it of these chains

577
01:26:33,574 --> 01:26:35,314
I ask you

578
01:26:35,783 --> 01:26:41,338
Fragile as she is, your Anarkali could
not bear the weight of these chains

579
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,774
She has traded her chains
for golden cuffs

580
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:50,720
What proof?

581
01:26:52,438 --> 01:26:56,321
Anarkali's rewards include
a fiefdom

582
01:26:56,651 --> 01:27:00,268
Tonight, she performs in court.
After which...

583
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:03,554
she has agreed to disappear.
Forever

584
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:25,282
The Prince is coming

585
01:27:36,947 --> 01:27:38,618
Leave me alone

586
01:27:45,605 --> 01:27:47,312
You shall stay here

587
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:54,417
So at last the wax doll melts?

588
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,986
And burns to ashes that
false garb of love...

589
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,980
which you wore when you strutted
before my eyes?

590
01:28:04,566 --> 01:28:09,236
Anarkali! The one whom just a dark
night in the dungeons has consumed

591
01:28:10,756 --> 01:28:13,348
You treacherous slave!
Anarkali you are not!

592
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:16,120
You're a pretender who is masquerading
as Anarkali to get out of prison!

593
01:28:16,453 --> 01:28:20,919
You are not my Anarkali!
- Yes, I am not your Anarkali

594
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:25,927
Certainly not! You are Akbar's whore!
Not Salim's lover

595
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:28,491
You were just an illusion
I took heart to

596
01:28:30,211 --> 01:28:33,433
You're a shameful blot on my name.
To be washed away!

597
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:13,917
Attention all ye

598
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,881
The Empress of the world

599
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:20,144
The jewel of the throne
of Hindustan

600
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:22,811
Maharani Jodhabai

601
01:29:23,345 --> 01:29:25,343
The one we are proud of

602
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:29,137
His Highness, the Crown Prince
of the Sultanate

603
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:32,888
Prince Noor-ud-din Mohammad Salim

604
01:29:33,815 --> 01:29:35,846
Attention! Heed the Badshah

605
01:29:36,381 --> 01:29:39,927
Plenipotentiary of Allah

606
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:45,195
The Emperor of Emperors, The One
of whom the world seeks succour

607
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:50,729
Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar
cometh

608
01:32:05,774 --> 01:32:13,664
It is but once that man
falls in love with another

609
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:29,466
In anguish, he lives...

610
01:32:30,464 --> 01:32:36,379
in anguish, he dies

611
01:32:43,072 --> 01:32:49,223
When we have loved...
why should we fear?

612
01:32:49,954 --> 01:32:53,599
We have loved...
not committed a theft

613
01:32:53,937 --> 01:32:55,899
We have only loved

614
01:32:57,261 --> 01:33:00,584
We have loved...
not committed a theft

615
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:03,709
Why should we be afraid?

616
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:07,791
We have loved...
why should we fear?

617
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:33,176
I'll reveal today the secrets
that lie in my heart...

618
01:33:35,414 --> 01:33:41,893
I'll reveal today the secrets
that lie in my heart

619
01:33:49,835 --> 01:33:53,089
Death is what the
world witnesses...

620
01:33:53,423 --> 01:33:56,048
what good is dying a death
of sufferance like this?

621
01:33:56,386 --> 01:34:00,101
We have loved...
why should we fear?

622
01:34:25,621 --> 01:34:28,672
In desire of him...

623
01:34:29,008 --> 01:34:32,591
I shall burn

624
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,230
For love, I shall live.
For love, I shall die

625
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,422
Nothing more is my will

626
01:34:46,754 --> 01:34:50,268
Now that I am in love,
why must I fear?

627
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:07,919
Our love will not remain hidden

628
01:35:08,251 --> 01:35:11,763
Everywhere around us
are tales of our love

629
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,828
There is nothing that
separates us from God...

630
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,785
why should we create barriers
between humans?

631
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:40,310
We have loved...
why should we fear?

632
01:35:47,787 --> 01:35:50,616
We have loved,
not committed a theft

633
01:35:50,947 --> 01:35:53,901
Why should we fear?

634
01:36:15,638 --> 01:36:19,252
This fearlessness in love,
this audacity...

635
01:36:19,588 --> 01:36:22,877
this novel manner of
making your statement...

636
01:36:23,243 --> 01:36:25,679
indeed, all this deserves
to be rewarded

637
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:28,076
My good fortune

638
01:36:29,203 --> 01:36:32,491
Of the magnanimous Plenipotentiary
of Allah, such I have expected

639
01:36:36,378 --> 01:36:38,342
Master of the Dungeons

640
01:36:42,403 --> 01:36:44,400
Take this girl away

641
01:36:46,253 --> 01:36:48,689
Cast her in the
darkest dungeon

642
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,118
Leave me alone

643
01:37:57,864 --> 01:38:00,986
Your continued presence
is proof of your disobedience

644
01:38:06,733 --> 01:38:12,066
Anarkali was arrested... I watched on.
- What else could you have done?

645
01:38:12,437 --> 01:38:15,561
What can anyone do before
so mighty an emperor?

646
01:38:17,034 --> 01:38:19,935
But today, Allah's Plenipotentiary
must own up to vindictiveness

647
01:38:20,263 --> 01:38:26,120
And my aspirations must be respected.
- If a slave is what you aspire for...

648
01:38:26,618 --> 01:38:31,598
then you shall be denied.
All your life

649
01:38:31,998 --> 01:38:36,554
Did you beget me that You may
rule the life that is mine?

650
01:38:36,889 --> 01:38:41,768
That while I breathe, You hold
my heart hostage?

651
01:38:42,822 --> 01:38:48,745
Am I to be indebted to You for my
life? Am I to pay my debt in tears?

652
01:38:50,285 --> 01:38:52,331
Anarkali is unfit for you

653
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:53,833
Why not?

654
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:58,499
Embrace me as a father
would his loved son

655
01:39:00,099 --> 01:39:03,614
Behold me with love in Your eyes
as You did when You saw me first

656
01:39:04,339 --> 01:39:07,527
Not as the Crown Prince of Hindustan,
think of me as your son...

657
01:39:08,085 --> 01:39:14,146
and tell me, is Anarkali unfit for me?
- Father I am, of a loved son

658
01:39:16,009 --> 01:39:19,911
But my duty as Emperor
I cannot disregard

659
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:26,436
For no sake of my son's romances,
may I play with the fate of my empire

660
01:39:26,767 --> 01:39:29,823
It all changes. With time

661
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:33,902
Empires change. Emperors change

662
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:41,432
But in this world of changes,
one who has found love wavers not

663
01:39:42,547 --> 01:39:44,560
Change, you will have to!

664
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:49,969
Salim! You will have to change

665
01:39:54,867 --> 01:40:00,440
A father who wants kings and sultans
to bow before his heir...

666
01:40:00,802 --> 01:40:06,625
an Emperor who wants his Crown Prince
to crush kingdoms...

667
01:40:06,963 --> 01:40:08,910
that is the father who has seen
his heir...

668
01:40:09,213 --> 01:40:11,458
that is the emperor who has seen
his Crown Prince...

669
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:16,968
bow before a slave's beauty. It was
as if thunder had struck his hopes

670
01:40:17,624 --> 01:40:21,525
The shock has shaken the very seat
of the Mughal empire

671
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:25,242
Desist, till He has
regained composure

672
01:40:27,991 --> 01:40:30,694
Desist I, whose life has been ruined,
and desist not he, who thinks...

673
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:33,924
his fancied regency has been marred?
- That is not the case

674
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:38,807
No! The Mighty One wants to play God!
He wants to dictate emotions!

675
01:40:39,139 --> 01:40:41,842
Who cares of consent
to fall in love?

676
01:40:42,171 --> 01:40:44,841
Your Highness! Save my Nadira!

677
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:47,939
Please save my Nadira!

678
01:40:53,616 --> 01:40:55,437
My Nadira! Please save her!

679
01:40:55,765 --> 01:41:01,046
My little girl! She will beat her head
upon the dungeon walls till she dies!

680
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:05,211
If this is the way she has to die,
Hindustan is the empire no more!

681
01:41:05,548 --> 01:41:10,660
Hindustan will become the graveyard
for the Mughal Sultanate

682
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:14,992
If the doors open not, then the walls
of the dungeon will have to fall

683
01:41:15,328 --> 01:41:18,097
Not the sword. You need a key to open
fortified doors

684
01:41:18,424 --> 01:41:22,170
Bahar...!
- I have dared

685
01:41:31,237 --> 01:41:32,269
Come on

686
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:35,861
Where to?
- Far away from Akbar's empire

687
01:41:47,405 --> 01:41:50,530
The arrogance mounts!
Salim is to be held

688
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Subtitle by PmT

689
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:36,270
Will you confront The Emperor
for the sake of a slave girl?

690
01:42:37,221 --> 01:42:42,756
No! I see in her the pride of Mughals.
The Empress of Hindustan

691
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:50,184
Never! The pride of the Mughals may
never be equated to a slave girl

692
01:42:51,174 --> 01:42:55,864
And Hindustan is not your heart
for a slave girl to Lord over it

693
01:42:56,651 --> 01:43:00,363
Nor is my heart your Hindustan
to rule over

694
01:43:01,737 --> 01:43:06,427
Over your heart, I have no right.
But over you, I do have my rights

695
01:43:07,506 --> 01:43:10,830
After all, you are my son.
- Yes, your son I am

696
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:17,741
But you too should consider
that I am part of your body

697
01:43:18,883 --> 01:43:20,640
Not some slave

698
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:22,792
No Salim, no!

699
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:28,327
You were given to me in answer
to my years of prayer

700
01:43:29,316 --> 01:43:34,194
You are my life's treasure.
You are my beloved

701
01:43:35,379 --> 01:43:39,770
But this is a matter of the state.
Do not drag your mother into this

702
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:45,221
Do not force me to forget my duty
because of my love for you

703
01:43:46,855 --> 01:43:49,422
Have respect for my responsibilities
and for your duty too

704
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:57,181
To Hindustan, you are the Moon!
Do nothing to denigrate yourself

705
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,957
Cast Anarkali out of your heart

706
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:07,550
For the sake of my milk I fed you!
- A price for my mother's milk?

707
01:44:09,415 --> 01:44:10,783
No Salim!

708
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,300
Or would you rather...

709
01:44:15,283 --> 01:44:21,474
that I bathe your feet in your milk
that runs in my veins as blood?

710
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:24,670
But ask not for usury

711
01:44:25,062 --> 01:44:29,621
You do not even understand
the import of what you speak!

712
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,854
I understand. I seek not one piece
of your precious Hindustan

713
01:44:34,192 --> 01:44:36,793
But give me Anarkali.
I beg of you

714
01:44:38,754 --> 01:44:43,703
Of Maharani Jodha I seek compassion.
Of Emperor Akbar, I seek mercy

715
01:44:45,472 --> 01:44:51,139
Salim! Tears? Those tears are
Jodha's and Akbar's life!

716
01:44:52,187 --> 01:44:56,844
Spill not tears from your eyes.
Hold your tears

717
01:45:00,826 --> 01:45:02,770
Anarkali, you will have

718
01:45:03,205 --> 01:45:04,506
Never

719
01:45:06,824 --> 01:45:11,671
No heir to Emperor Babar's throne
may be disgraced

720
01:45:14,845 --> 01:45:20,803
I decree Salim be sent on
the campaign of Deccan

721
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:26,673
No sad lover, but a soldier be given
the sword to carry in battle

722
01:45:27,395 --> 01:45:32,931
Do not endanger the Prince's life.
- Death in the battlefield...

723
01:45:33,331 --> 01:45:39,131
is better than life lived in
desperate love of a slave girl

724
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:47,539
Wait

725
01:45:53,086 --> 01:45:55,587
My Salim will not go to war

726
01:46:08,636 --> 01:46:13,426
My decree shall not be swayed
by a mother's blind love

727
01:46:14,372 --> 01:46:16,319
But Salim will decide

728
01:46:17,633 --> 01:46:22,058
If You wish to see how an Emperor's
decree may be rebuffed...

729
01:46:22,426 --> 01:46:24,504
then give Salim Your dictat

730
01:46:28,228 --> 01:46:33,963
Such scant respect he has for me?
- Do not gauge him by his disposition

731
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:39,369
Let this storm blow over.
Salim will change. You'll see

732
01:46:40,128 --> 01:46:45,309
And how to make the storm blow over?
- Let him have Anarkali

733
01:46:45,669 --> 01:46:48,572
Once he has Anarkali,
Salim will return to us

734
01:46:54,603 --> 01:47:01,284
The obligation of a slave girl
to turn my own son around?

735
01:47:01,612 --> 01:47:07,416
For the sake of your son!
- A mother can be only a mother

736
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,565
And you are an emperor.
Only an emperor

737
01:47:14,032 --> 01:47:15,231
Beyond doubt

738
01:47:16,152 --> 01:47:18,751
Man Singh, so shall it be done

739
01:47:25,866 --> 01:47:27,756
This royal charter decrees...

740
01:47:28,085 --> 01:47:32,440
that the Crown Prince...

741
01:47:32,843 --> 01:47:36,421
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim...

742
01:47:36,755 --> 01:47:40,333
at daybreak tomorrow,
leaves the royal palace

743
01:47:40,668 --> 01:47:44,279
and marches for Deccan
with the army

744
01:47:44,743 --> 01:47:47,933
Take it away! I am no heir
to Emperor Akbar!

745
01:47:48,263 --> 01:47:49,230
Your Highness!

746
01:47:49,535 --> 01:47:51,479
Wait or us at Safdarjung Gate

747
01:47:54,491 --> 01:47:57,614
Your Highness, was that not naive?
- Maybe. But I insist

748
01:47:57,977 --> 01:48:00,969
If I be coerced, then I shall
refuse to obey

749
01:48:01,303 --> 01:48:04,881
You may not act in naivete.
This is no time for being adamant

750
01:48:05,215 --> 01:48:09,028
He is the one who is being adamant.
My wounds need to be salved. He knows

751
01:48:09,356 --> 01:48:12,613
And yet he decrees my departure!
If he thinks he can coerce me...

752
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:16,522
he is wrong!
- The Emperor will not tolerate...

753
01:48:16,854 --> 01:48:24,024
the Prince's disobedience. The stance
may be the excuse for Anarkali's death

754
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:27,015
This, he cannot do!
- This is exactly what he will do

755
01:48:27,351 --> 01:48:33,153
Life for Anarkali lies beyond
the bloodbath and the victory

756
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,492
Lead your army

757
01:48:39,155 --> 01:48:41,722
If Anarkali's life be cause for war...

758
01:48:44,141 --> 01:48:47,620
then I shall turn the tide
even in the face of death!

759
01:48:48,935 --> 01:48:52,480
But who takes responsibility
for Anarkali's safety in my absence?

760
01:48:52,811 --> 01:48:55,968
I do. She lives safe
in the shadow of my sword

761
01:48:56,302 --> 01:49:00,602
Durjan, you have but one sword.
Emperor Akbar wields a million swords

762
01:49:00,931 --> 01:49:05,098
Then you have a Rajput's word.
A million heads will roll

763
01:49:24,207 --> 01:49:27,264
Your Majesty, the sculptor is here

764
01:49:47,809 --> 01:49:49,178
Leave us alone

765
01:49:53,776 --> 01:50:00,612
Sculptor, I am glad that artistes
of your prowess thrive in my empire

766
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:05,215
But the truth is that
I face starvation

767
01:50:08,216 --> 01:50:09,808
Not any more

768
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:15,216
In appreciation of your art

769
01:50:16,172 --> 01:50:19,885
I reward you

770
01:50:23,996 --> 01:50:27,254
In appreciation of the art,
this is far too much

771
01:50:28,593 --> 01:50:31,494
But in appreciation of truth,
this is far too little

772
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:35,400
What do you seek?
- To spread the truth...

773
01:50:35,732 --> 01:50:39,966
about my art throughout the empire.
- You have my permission

774
01:50:41,373 --> 01:50:44,696
My good fortune. My unfinished agenda
shall now be completed...

775
01:50:45,025 --> 01:50:46,969
thanks to The Emperor's magnanimity

776
01:50:49,098 --> 01:50:52,355
No, all is not done yet

777
01:50:54,217 --> 01:50:57,697
What you lack in life
is a woman

778
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:03,528
As your reward, I give you
the very beauty...

779
01:51:03,868 --> 01:51:08,003
whom you have used to express
the beauty of your art

780
01:51:08,986 --> 01:51:10,352
Meaning...?

781
01:51:11,726 --> 01:51:14,982
Tomorrow, you shall wed Anarkali

782
01:51:15,538 --> 01:51:17,584
But Your Majesty...

783
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:24,233
Is this5s any less a reward?
- It is beyond my expectations

784
01:51:24,633 --> 01:51:27,890
I am beholden to The Emperor

785
01:51:30,373 --> 01:51:31,995
You may leave

786
01:51:48,107 --> 01:51:52,142
Such little difference between cruelty
and justice that Emperors dispense!

787
01:51:54,823 --> 01:51:57,879
For the bounty that The Emperor
bestows upon you...

788
01:51:59,581 --> 01:52:06,684
is this how happy you are?
- Happiness is a fool's emotion

789
01:52:08,545 --> 01:52:11,803
I am just joking about the foolishness
of the bequeathal

790
01:52:12,459 --> 01:52:19,852
Do you refuse the reward?
Do you refuse to obey The Emperor?

791
01:52:20,185 --> 01:52:21,352
Indeed!

792
01:52:26,021 --> 01:52:27,966
The consequences... do you realise?

793
01:52:38,736 --> 01:52:45,805
The truth of my sculpture
may yet be borne in my blood

794
01:53:07,032 --> 01:53:16,127
The spirit you have shown in refusing
to obey Emperor Akbar, I salute

795
01:53:16,814 --> 01:53:21,014
That salutation is no reward
for my spirit

796
01:53:23,758 --> 01:53:27,270
Then, what is it you desire?

797
01:53:27,896 --> 01:53:33,042
I wish to see Anarkali's fate
enjoined with yours

798
01:54:00,139 --> 01:54:03,062
A message to The Emperor
from the Crown Prince

799
01:54:08,681 --> 01:54:10,538
Read it out

800
01:54:11,875 --> 01:54:17,378
The Emperor of Hindustan,
Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...

801
01:54:19,051 --> 01:54:25,553
be apprised that I, Crown Prince
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim...

802
01:54:25,955 --> 01:54:33,341
hereby declare my independence.
I enjoin upon The Emperor...

803
01:54:33,712 --> 01:54:40,414
to accept Anarkali as my consort,
the future Empress of Hindustan

804
01:54:40,909 --> 01:54:47,647
The Emperor also be apprised that
I am a prince of the dynasty of Tamer

805
01:54:48,373 --> 01:54:53,236
A dynasty of regents who, without
recourse to dictat or religion...

806
01:54:53,566 --> 01:55:00,031
chose their consorts. I too reserve
the right to choose one of my liking

807
01:55:00,467 --> 01:55:08,344
And this right I am exercising.
Should The Emperor disagree...

808
01:55:10,261 --> 01:55:15,551
This is a documentation of the vanity
of youth. Read it to the last

809
01:55:15,949 --> 01:55:20,344
I cannot move myself to speak.
- The veil of courtesy is lifted

810
01:55:21,866 --> 01:55:22,839
Read on

811
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:26,431
Read on!

812
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:33,002
Should The Emperor disagree,
then the revolt has begun

813
01:55:35,997 --> 01:55:38,721
The rebellion of this upstart
I shall take on

814
01:55:39,616 --> 01:55:45,622
Let the historians add a love-crazed
fool to the list of my rebels

815
01:55:46,747 --> 01:55:49,862
Man Singh, we shall fight

816
01:55:50,461 --> 01:55:53,441
I shall ride in battle

817
01:56:09,492 --> 01:56:14,716
Has the Maharani forgotten that she
has to say sacrament to my sword?

818
01:56:16,098 --> 01:56:20,661
Your Majesty, the Empress
expresses her inability...

819
01:56:21,061 --> 01:56:23,886
to hand over to you the sword
that will slay the Prince

820
01:56:24,349 --> 01:56:29,438
Tradition may not be changed.
From her only, shall I accept my sword

821
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:51,559
Always from your hands I have taken
the sword...

822
01:56:51,892 --> 01:56:54,157
that has decapitated my rebels

823
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:58,070
Today too, you shall perform
this ritual

824
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:08,258
You ask me to give you the sword
that will kill my son?

825
01:57:08,656 --> 01:57:10,424
Not your son

826
01:57:10,761 --> 01:57:17,530
I seek the sword against the rebel
who threatens to kill your husband

827
01:57:18,516 --> 01:57:23,079
Will you not give me the sword
to protect myself, for my victory?

828
01:57:23,447 --> 01:57:27,514
I stand not to win.
Either way, I lose

829
01:57:29,068 --> 01:57:32,846
On one hand, my husband.
On the other, my son

830
01:57:33,243 --> 01:57:36,066
And the choice you shall make
right now

831
01:57:37,154 --> 01:57:39,385
Your son, or your husband?

832
01:57:53,721 --> 01:57:55,984
As a Rajput, you epitomise the legacy
of women who immolated themselves...

833
01:57:56,317 --> 01:57:58,939
upon the pyres of their dead husbands.
Do you hesitate?

834
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:15,276
You were born a daughter of warriors!
Why are your hands shaking?

835
01:58:22,414 --> 01:58:26,224
No hands of one who heartens
not to her husband...

836
01:58:26,554 --> 01:58:29,738
can carry the sword of emperors

837
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,180
O'Mighty One!

838
01:58:48,973 --> 01:58:51,862
The mark of the wedded woman that
you have wiped from my brow...

839
01:58:52,194 --> 01:58:55,478
you will give back to me
with the red of Salim's blood

840
01:58:56,926 --> 01:58:59,750
If the price of my husband's life
has to be paid for in my son's blood...

841
01:59:00,081 --> 01:59:04,350
then take this sword, and
be happy to kill my son!

842
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:07,962
Not a word shall I utter!

843
01:59:17,569 --> 01:59:21,210
The call for battle is
the cry for his death

844
01:59:21,543 --> 01:59:23,279
Whose death, Your Majesty?

845
01:59:25,425 --> 01:59:33,405
The one so blinded by foolish love,
as not to know his father!

846
01:59:35,185 --> 01:59:37,058
This darkness must be dispelled

847
01:59:37,552 --> 01:59:41,787
This pretty serpent that sways between
me and Salim, must be fanged

848
01:59:58,392 --> 02:00:06,147
I make an appeal...

849
02:00:17,981 --> 02:00:24,683
my world lies shattered

850
02:00:36,422 --> 02:00:42,630
Show mercy to me, O Lord

851
02:01:06,033 --> 02:01:12,210
Mired in difficulties is life

852
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:20,094
Have mercy on me, Lord

853
02:01:41,798 --> 02:01:49,674
I need help, Lord...
Come to my rescue

854
02:01:58,496 --> 02:02:05,452
I keep no secrets from You

855
02:02:08,157 --> 02:02:12,684
I'm wounded at heart

856
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:22,607
Have mercy on me, Lord

857
02:02:34,353 --> 02:02:39,376
Dark clouds hover...

858
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:43,914
there isn't a silver lining

859
02:02:50,723 --> 02:02:57,717
Save me from drowning...

860
02:02:59,928 --> 02:03:08,565
I'm surrounded by storms,
life is difficult

861
02:03:09,459 --> 02:03:13,885
Have mercy on me, Lord

862
02:03:19,122 --> 02:03:25,330
I'm plagued with adversity

863
02:03:28,225 --> 02:03:32,688
Have mercy on me, Lord

864
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:52,084
Open the cell.
I have come to take Anarkali

865
02:03:52,418 --> 02:03:55,566
Except death, to none else may we
deliver her. The Emperor's orders

866
02:03:55,902 --> 02:04:00,327
And I have to take her out alive.
A Rajput has given his word

867
02:04:39,288 --> 02:04:43,224
The army is ready and awaiting
The Emperor's arrival

868
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:51,515
May Allah lead you to victory

869
02:04:51,842 --> 02:04:56,709
May the Regent who loves His subjects,
His Motherland and God...

870
02:04:57,038 --> 02:04:59,000
be victorious always

871
02:04:59,733 --> 02:05:06,236
O'Emperor of Emperors, Thou hast
bestowed upon this humble man...

872
02:05:06,701 --> 02:05:10,546
every blessing that
life has to offer

873
02:05:12,552 --> 02:05:16,946
I have heard people call me
their emperor

874
02:05:18,733 --> 02:05:22,732
Now, please let me hear
the word father

875
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:30,659
Are these the hands that prayed?

876
02:05:40,193 --> 02:05:45,776
Man Singh, before the battle commences,
I shall go to meet Salim

877
02:05:46,111 --> 02:05:48,074
With all due deference
to Your decision...

878
02:05:48,312 --> 02:05:52,247
it is not advisable for The Emperor
to enter the rebel's camp alone

879
02:05:56,006 --> 02:05:58,661
But for a father it is possible

880
02:06:01,823 --> 02:06:05,860
Emperor Akbar cometh

881
02:06:27,889 --> 02:06:29,523
Leave us alone

882
02:06:42,482 --> 02:06:45,835
Has The Emperor come
to pardon the rebel?

883
02:06:51,421 --> 02:06:55,693
This unfortunate father that
the world calls an emperor...

884
02:06:56,157 --> 02:07:02,554
has come to talk to his talk to
his son... to ask for his love

885
02:07:03,024 --> 02:07:05,645
You destroy your son's love,
and yet you seek his love?

886
02:07:08,184 --> 02:07:10,550
Now the emperor poses
as a father?

887
02:07:18,902 --> 02:07:21,388
The Emperor never weeps

888
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:27,700
These are tears in a father's eyes

889
02:07:29,581 --> 02:07:36,350
Son, before Akbar's principles,
your poor father is helpless

890
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:39,078
Then to Salim too, his love

891
02:07:44,767 --> 02:07:46,180
Son...

892
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:54,919
Son, love can win hearts.
Not battles

893
02:07:56,503 --> 02:08:00,437
Your emotions cannot withstand
the relentless onslaught...

894
02:08:00,775 --> 02:08:04,383
of an Emperor's endless might.
- That the battle will decide

895
02:08:10,077 --> 02:08:13,584
The Emperor cares not for war
to influence his decision

896
02:08:15,238 --> 02:08:18,186
At the sounding
of the wardrums...

897
02:08:19,181 --> 02:08:22,130
Anarkali dies

898
02:08:42,585 --> 02:08:44,029
My son...!

899
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:50,037
So this is the day I begot you for?

900
02:08:53,598 --> 02:08:57,632
If the father's head should roll
to please the son...

901
02:09:01,287 --> 02:09:03,248
here stands a father

902
02:09:08,387 --> 02:09:09,797
Your Highness

903
02:09:13,285 --> 02:09:16,535
Has the might of the Emperor overcome
a Rajput's promise?

904
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:21,786
No, Your Highness.
A Rajput will give up his life

905
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:26,558
Not his promise

906
02:09:27,123 --> 02:09:28,758
Anarkali...?

907
02:09:51,871 --> 02:09:54,235
Salim has won without war

908
02:09:55,718 --> 02:09:58,373
There will be no war
- There will be war!

909
02:10:08,636 --> 02:10:10,597
My prayers go with you

910
02:10:11,627 --> 02:10:18,192
On the battlefield, may Allah
protect you from Akbar's wrath

911
02:10:41,175 --> 02:10:42,553
Anarkali...

912
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:48,628
That you still live,
bodes ill for Salim

913
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:53,529
Before the swords of Akbar cast
the shadow of death over your heads...

914
02:12:54,361 --> 02:12:59,910
before the storm of blood and ash
consumes you...

915
02:13:00,242 --> 02:13:02,833
hand Anarkali over

916
02:13:04,155 --> 02:13:08,750
This sword has vanquished
the mightiest of warriors...

917
02:13:09,084 --> 02:13:14,665
protects not only Anarkali,
but all men who have loved...

918
02:13:15,003 --> 02:13:21,670
all those who refuse to be
servile to emperors

919
02:13:22,892 --> 02:13:26,174
Man Singh! Battle begins!

920
02:13:29,498 --> 02:13:30,774
Charge!

921
02:13:36,466 --> 02:13:37,674
Charge!

922
02:15:18,161 --> 02:15:21,411
Kill Anarkali on this very field

923
02:15:24,701 --> 02:15:26,699
Your Highness, Anarkali's life
is in danger

924
02:15:26,938 --> 02:15:29,390
With your permission,
may I escort her to safety?

925
02:17:54,948 --> 02:17:59,316
The victorious Emperor returns
from the battlefield...

926
02:17:59,647 --> 02:18:02,099
to visit Maharani Jodhabai

927
02:18:13,584 --> 02:18:16,935
Is this the mark of the married woman,
or is this a mother's woe?

928
02:18:20,453 --> 02:18:22,156
Look at my sword

929
02:18:23,445 --> 02:18:26,168
Not a drop of Salim's blood

930
02:18:38,562 --> 02:18:44,502
This must be the first sword
that a mother has embraced!

931
02:18:47,077 --> 02:18:48,947
Take me to Salim

932
02:18:50,987 --> 02:18:52,859
You may not meet him

933
02:18:54,601 --> 02:18:55,747
Why?

934
02:18:56,183 --> 02:18:59,130
His father's sword
may have spared him.

935
02:19:00,158 --> 02:19:03,472
But there's more to
The Emperor's justice

936
02:19:22,805 --> 02:19:30,494
Accused. Noor ud din Mohammad Salim,
son of Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...

937
02:19:31,384 --> 02:19:35,418
be presented before the tribunal
for sentencing

938
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:47,446
Attention all ye

939
02:19:51,630 --> 02:19:54,523
The proceedings may begin

940
02:19:58,106 --> 02:20:02,445
Against Noor ud din Mohammad Salim,
the accusation lies...

941
02:20:02,939 --> 02:20:08,810
that for the sake of a slave girl,
you have brought the Crown to disgrace

942
02:20:09,316 --> 02:20:11,769
You have undermined
The Emperor's decree

943
02:20:12,107 --> 02:20:14,204
You have incited a mutiny

944
02:20:14,539 --> 02:20:19,595
You have lured a trustworthy Rajput
like Durjan Singh into treachery

945
02:20:19,998 --> 02:20:22,485
You have abducted Anarkali

946
02:20:22,857 --> 02:20:26,365
You have incited a rebellion
in the Emperor's armies

947
02:20:26,702 --> 02:20:27,552
You have revolted

948
02:20:27,887 --> 02:20:30,832
All these charges
can be retracted

949
02:20:32,521 --> 02:20:35,870
All your transgressions
may be pardoned

950
02:20:37,746 --> 02:20:41,095
I can bestow upon you all privileges
as before

951
02:20:41,789 --> 02:20:46,911
Provided you return Anarkali.
- For You to execute her?

952
02:20:47,608 --> 02:20:48,985
Beyond doubt

953
02:20:49,577 --> 02:20:53,513
Then in all equity,
The Emperor shall do so too...

954
02:20:53,852 --> 02:20:58,122
to those disobedient fireflies that
fling themselves into the candles...

955
02:20:58,454 --> 02:21:04,361
and the bees that sing so sweetly
of love as they fly over flowers...

956
02:21:05,126 --> 02:21:11,369
and stop the rivers for they lose
themselves in the embrace of seas

957
02:21:11,963 --> 02:21:16,268
I wish not to hear depositions
on love inspired by madness

958
02:21:18,174 --> 02:21:20,337
I want Anarkali

959
02:21:21,034 --> 02:21:23,397
And I do not want
to give Anarkali away

960
02:21:23,796 --> 02:21:27,605
Then I swear by the blood of Tamer
that runs in my veins...

961
02:21:28,036 --> 02:21:33,416
you will be disowned forever

962
02:21:33,953 --> 02:21:35,914
That I shall accept

963
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:39,010
But not the throne that sits upon
Anarkali's grave

964
02:21:39,771 --> 02:21:43,209
Not the crown that holds
my heart hostage

965
02:21:43,811 --> 02:21:46,302
That is unacceptable.
- Now I know!

966
02:21:46,672 --> 02:21:49,720
In the fires of your love you wish to
melt down the gold in the Mughal crown

967
02:21:50,058 --> 02:21:54,193
To craft of it anklets to adorn
the feet of a dancing girl

968
02:21:55,350 --> 02:22:01,166
Upon the sacred throne of Hindustan
you wish to see a pretty whore dance

969
02:22:01,562 --> 02:22:02,872
And you...

970
02:22:03,239 --> 02:22:08,788
And you wish to bring your future
daughter-in-law to disgrace in court!

971
02:22:09,811 --> 02:22:10,788
Silence!

972
02:22:10,993 --> 02:22:15,164
Try as much as The Emperor will, to
veil vendetta for defeat with justice

973
02:22:15,498 --> 02:22:17,661
Anarkali He shall not have!

974
02:22:18,357 --> 02:22:20,588
His son's life, He may have

975
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:26,006
Justice I hold dearer
than my son

976
02:22:28,087 --> 02:22:36,269
Noor ud din Mohammad Salim, you have
taken advantage of my magnanimity

977
02:22:37,751 --> 02:22:41,596
And you have refused to present
Anarkali in court

978
02:22:42,978 --> 02:22:48,883
Anarkali's sentence
is not revoked

979
02:22:49,683 --> 02:22:51,644
In her stead, you...

980
02:22:55,796 --> 02:22:58,093
are sentenced to death

981
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:00,722
Mercy!

982
02:23:08,682 --> 02:23:12,223
Seek not my sympathy today

983
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:16,493
What but death can a despot decree?

984
02:23:17,556 --> 02:23:21,893
In the tale of Anarkali's love
etched in Salim's blood...

985
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:25,174
the demise of Akbar, The Emperor
will also be told

986
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,113
Leave me alone

987
02:24:27,303 --> 02:24:28,278
What news?

988
02:24:28,619 --> 02:24:31,600
Emperor Akbar has decreed that
tomorrow morning...

989
02:24:31,938 --> 02:24:36,039
Prince Salim will die
in Anarkali's stead

990
02:24:44,428 --> 02:24:52,475
Till Durjan can wield the sword,
death cannot touch the Prince!

991
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:56,349
Where are you going?
- To face Emperor Akbar!

992
02:24:56,689 --> 02:25:00,657
You are wounded.
- My body is wounded

993
02:25:01,026 --> 02:25:04,243
Not my spirit!
Out of my way!

994
02:27:05,269 --> 02:27:08,454
Do you see fear on your son's face?

995
02:27:09,936 --> 02:27:11,574
Not a shadow

996
02:27:12,076 --> 02:27:14,337
You are my blood.
I have faith

997
02:27:16,873 --> 02:27:18,867
I have come to congratulate my son

998
02:27:20,752 --> 02:27:23,307
The brave Rajput is also
wedded to death

999
02:28:01,476 --> 02:28:05,219
How I wish all mothers had hearts
like Maharani Jodha

1000
02:29:13,165 --> 02:29:21,144
Today is the day when Emperor Akbar
was defeated, and love triumphed

1001
02:29:24,012 --> 02:29:25,849
To you I express my gratitude...

1002
02:29:27,265 --> 02:29:33,271
and my respects to the mothers
of the martyrs who bore death...

1003
02:29:33,838 --> 02:29:37,906
for the sake of truth and love

1004
02:29:42,056 --> 02:29:44,017
This is my final message

1005
02:29:45,999 --> 02:29:50,986
Stand fast by those in love,
not by those who be mighty

1006
02:29:51,357 --> 02:29:53,881
Long live the Prince!

1007
02:30:01,843 --> 02:30:06,764
On the path of love...

1008
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:14,585
a lover triumphs

1009
02:30:19,328 --> 02:30:27,410
Rejoice. Love is martyred

1010
02:30:43,324 --> 02:30:46,933
Victory be to love

1011
02:30:47,333 --> 02:30:51,076
Victory be to love

1012
02:31:03,241 --> 02:31:09,416
Free from slavery to riches,
love triumphs

1013
02:31:09,815 --> 02:31:12,763
Long live, love

1014
02:31:29,142 --> 02:31:35,454
In mosques and temples...
Iove is faith

1015
02:31:36,341 --> 02:31:43,142
Flowing from Krishna's flute,
love is what Allah blesses

1016
02:31:43,507 --> 02:31:50,007
Love keeps the world alive

1017
02:31:54,188 --> 02:31:57,538
Long live, love

1018
02:32:10,197 --> 02:32:16,864
Hatred shall not contain
this storm of love

1019
02:32:17,261 --> 02:32:24,154
Love shall not be slain
by daggers and swords

1020
02:32:24,626 --> 02:32:30,936
Lovers are martyred...
they are remembered forever

1021
02:32:31,429 --> 02:32:37,570
Long live, love

1022
02:32:51,019 --> 02:32:57,025
Should love revolt,
it could change the world

1023
02:32:58,086 --> 02:33:02,883
A raging fire it could
cause in mighty palaces...

1024
02:33:03,212 --> 02:33:05,578
and overthrow emperors

1025
02:33:05,908 --> 02:33:12,241
With their heads held high,
they seek no favours

1026
02:33:13,074 --> 02:33:16,020
Long live, love

1027
02:33:20,305 --> 02:33:23,712
Long live, love

1028
02:33:40,093 --> 02:33:46,593
Those who worship power
have no faith of their calling

1029
02:33:49,328 --> 02:33:56,254
He who worships power
has no faith of his calling

1030
02:33:58,696 --> 02:34:05,329
A heart bereft of love
is made of stone

1031
02:34:07,407 --> 02:34:13,907
He whose heart is bereft of love,
is not human

1032
02:34:22,032 --> 02:34:24,857
Come to your senses,
O enemy of love...

1033
02:34:25,222 --> 02:34:28,626
lest you are doomed

1034
02:34:28,999 --> 02:34:35,434
Long live, love

1035
02:34:36,658 --> 02:34:39,842
Long live, love

1036
02:35:11,205 --> 02:35:14,031
Long live Man Singh!

1037
02:35:31,681 --> 02:35:35,852
Should The Emperor so desire,
the Prince may be released

1038
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:42,231
After Anarkali's death

1039
02:35:53,936 --> 02:35:57,745
He is alive. He lives

1040
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:15,489
Your Majesty!

1041
02:36:27,097 --> 02:36:31,493
The Prince is alive!
My felicitations to The Emperor!

1042
02:36:32,456 --> 02:36:34,486
You will die

1043
02:36:37,191 --> 02:36:41,785
Take this pretty petrel away!

1044
02:36:42,908 --> 02:36:44,871
Bury her alive

1045
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:59,043
The word of The Emperor be blessed.
May my Prince live forever!

1046
02:37:00,074 --> 02:37:04,299
That is all I wish for...

1047
02:37:04,965 --> 02:37:07,928
all I wish for

1048
02:37:09,063 --> 02:37:14,537
Anarkali, the dying is given
one last wish

1049
02:37:15,274 --> 02:37:18,968
If you have any wish,
you may petition The Emperor

1050
02:37:19,967 --> 02:37:23,425
It is beyond The Emperor
to give me my wish

1051
02:37:23,832 --> 02:37:30,232
I am not so narrow-minded as not to
allow the last wish of a slave girl

1052
02:37:30,869 --> 02:37:32,052
Speak

1053
02:37:35,892 --> 02:37:39,158
Before I die, I wish
to become the empress

1054
02:37:41,707 --> 02:37:47,486
At last! You have spoken
what you had in heart

1055
02:37:48,612 --> 02:37:52,206
Even in the shadow of death
you have not forgotten...

1056
02:37:52,545 --> 02:37:55,845
that golden dream of becoming
the Empress of Hindustan

1057
02:37:59,812 --> 02:38:03,767
I am a slave. Do not presume
that it's my wish, Your Majesty

1058
02:38:06,518 --> 02:38:08,930
The Prince promised...

1059
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:14,942
to make me his queen

1060
02:38:17,522 --> 02:38:20,294
I do not want him to break
his promise

1061
02:38:22,611 --> 02:38:30,003
A future Emperor of Hindustan must not
be ashamed of failing a slave girl

1062
02:38:34,604 --> 02:38:39,456
I shall not let the future
Emperor of Hindustan to be ashamed

1063
02:38:40,452 --> 02:38:45,467
Man Singh, Salim is to be set free

1064
02:38:52,544 --> 02:38:56,736
Before daybreak, you will make sure
that Salim inhales...

1065
02:38:57,072 --> 02:39:02,253
this flower doused with intoxicants.
He must not interfere with your death

1066
02:39:03,053 --> 02:39:09,518
He must pass out before the sentries
draw you away from him...

1067
02:39:09,992 --> 02:39:12,491
and send you to your death

1068
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:17,347
Death is closer than love

1069
02:39:19,904 --> 02:39:21,751
So it shall be done

1070
02:39:23,074 --> 02:39:28,426
Unless this is done,
Salim will not let you die

1071
02:39:30,014 --> 02:39:33,776
And I shall not let you live,
Anarkali

1072
02:39:34,706 --> 02:39:36,945
I died a long time ago

1073
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:51,811
Now please let the coffin pass
into my grave

1074
02:40:19,573 --> 02:40:21,117
You may go

1075
02:40:22,548 --> 02:40:26,738
In return for this
act of magnanimity...

1076
02:40:27,505 --> 02:40:31,898
this slave absolves you,
Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar...

1077
02:40:32,228 --> 02:40:34,234
of the crime of my murder

1078
02:42:06,692 --> 02:42:13,589
How will the heartburn ever lessen?
How will love ever lessen?

1079
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:20,530
The night is colourful...

1080
02:42:20,933 --> 02:42:24,302
what will day be like?

1081
02:42:38,875 --> 02:42:45,543
Every couplet sparkles;
goblets of joy are drunk

1082
02:42:49,678 --> 02:42:56,111
This Spring will be spoken about
for ages to come

1083
02:42:59,891 --> 02:43:06,322
How much more enchanting
could love be?

1084
02:43:13,731 --> 02:43:16,404
Such is this colourful night...

1085
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:20,298
what will tomorrow be like?

1086
02:43:34,712 --> 02:43:41,316
The mood around here,
with the lovers present

1087
02:43:45,287 --> 02:43:51,628
Their eyes convey love...
their hearts brim with passion

1088
02:43:55,296 --> 02:43:58,596
For a few moments
spent like this...

1089
02:43:58,933 --> 02:44:02,131
why would they even
regret death?

1090
02:44:09,009 --> 02:44:11,883
Such is the colourful night...

1091
02:44:12,246 --> 02:44:15,311
what will day be like?

1092
02:44:29,661 --> 02:44:32,566
Such is the state
of these lovers...

1093
02:44:32,865 --> 02:44:36,321
those issuing edicts
aren't going to be spared

1094
02:44:39,604 --> 02:44:42,443
Why would they contemplate
the consequences...

1095
02:44:42,779 --> 02:44:46,437
given the state they are in

1096
02:44:49,716 --> 02:44:56,319
A passionate night is in the offing;
what is it going to be like

1097
02:45:03,163 --> 02:45:09,526
Such is this colourful night...
what will day be like?

1098
02:47:17,766 --> 02:47:19,722
Why have you done this?

1099
02:47:23,542 --> 02:47:30,555
These pretty hands have
at last let go of love?

1100
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:36,795
How could you betray me
like this?

1101
02:47:38,175 --> 02:47:43,051
Do not turn away from Salim, Anarkali.
Come to me

1102
02:47:45,063 --> 02:47:47,781
Tell me, can you betray me?

1103
02:47:49,264 --> 02:47:52,506
Tell me, can you?

1104
02:48:07,899 --> 02:48:08,939
No!

1105
02:48:12,983 --> 02:48:16,362
Anarkali can betray her on life

1106
02:48:19,512 --> 02:48:20,920
Not you

1107
02:48:21,546 --> 02:48:22,720
Life...?

1108
02:48:28,339 --> 02:48:32,567
Who is it?
Who wants to kill you?

1109
02:48:33,721 --> 02:48:34,928
No one

1110
02:48:36,508 --> 02:48:43,554
Is this why I have been intoxicated?
So that you may be taken away from me?

1111
02:48:45,137 --> 02:48:46,937
Destiny decrees so

1112
02:48:47,201 --> 02:48:49,431
Destiny shall change her decree

1113
02:48:52,124 --> 02:48:57,830
Anarkali, I can see
those crawling shadows

1114
02:49:01,508 --> 02:49:04,483
The cowardly slaves
of Emperor Akbar...

1115
02:49:04,822 --> 02:49:09,474
they are coming for you!
I can see them!

1116
02:49:11,742 --> 02:49:13,085
Come out!

1117
02:49:16,862 --> 02:49:19,123
Anarkali is mine!

1118
02:49:20,832 --> 02:49:23,024
No one takes her away from me!

1119
02:49:45,405 --> 02:49:49,142
These heartless knaves...

1120
02:49:51,311 --> 02:49:54,062
cannot touch you, Anarkali!

1121
02:49:57,218 --> 02:49:59,768
My love, come...

1122
02:50:03,058 --> 02:50:04,434
You knaves!

1123
02:50:06,075 --> 02:50:07,449
Knaves!

1124
02:50:09,127 --> 02:50:10,535
Anarkali...

1125
02:50:12,047 --> 02:50:14,003
Salim loves you!

1126
02:51:06,115 --> 02:51:12,995
Comes dawn, bearing death...

1127
02:51:18,091 --> 02:51:26,781
like someone snuffing out life

1128
02:51:44,403 --> 02:51:50,927
May God be your Saviour

1129
02:51:51,390 --> 02:51:56,434
May God be your Protector

1130
02:51:57,033 --> 02:52:02,213
This is my prayer

1131
02:52:09,173 --> 02:52:14,811
Your world, I leave

1132
02:52:15,506 --> 02:52:20,720
Accept my farewell

1133
02:52:36,668 --> 02:52:42,372
When they take away
my bier soon...

1134
02:52:43,064 --> 02:52:48,468
do not be one of those
who carry it

1135
02:52:51,433 --> 02:52:57,328
When they take away
my bier soon...

1136
02:52:58,124 --> 02:53:03,002
do not lend it a shoulder

1137
02:53:03,339 --> 02:53:09,537
May our love never be disgraced

1138
02:53:09,902 --> 02:53:14,756
This is what I pray for

1139
02:53:15,153 --> 02:53:21,282
This is what I tearfully pray for

1140
02:53:22,039 --> 02:53:28,036
May God be your Saviour

1141
02:53:28,407 --> 02:53:33,755
This is all I pray for

1142
02:54:57,230 --> 02:54:59,624
My child!

1143
02:55:00,022 --> 02:55:01,401
Nadira...!

1144
02:55:09,812 --> 02:55:13,400
By the sacred scales of Justice,
I swear

1145
02:55:14,270 --> 02:55:17,445
Whatever you seek of Akbar,
for once in your life...

1146
02:55:18,314 --> 02:55:20,108
shall be given

1147
02:55:28,039 --> 02:55:29,386
The Emperor!

1148
02:55:30,188 --> 02:55:31,689
The Emperor!

1149
02:55:34,778 --> 02:55:36,693
Where is The Emperor?

1150
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:45,359
What do you want?

1151
02:55:48,032 --> 02:55:49,947
Life. For my daughter

1152
02:55:50,922 --> 02:55:53,581
Has hope blinded you?

1153
02:55:54,933 --> 02:55:57,812
Do you not know my law?

1154
02:55:58,142 --> 02:56:02,794
Do you recognise this,
Your Majesty? Remember...?

1155
02:56:03,147 --> 02:56:08,084
You promised me that
I may have one wish

1156
02:56:09,119 --> 02:56:11,426
I seek Anarkali's life

1157
02:56:11,749 --> 02:56:15,209
I remember nothing.
- You remember nothing?

1158
02:56:15,988 --> 02:56:18,843
But The Emperor never reneges
on his promise

1159
02:56:19,164 --> 02:56:21,306
I told you! I remember nothing!

1160
02:56:21,731 --> 02:56:23,590
You may forget your promise

1161
02:56:23,881 --> 02:56:28,148
But that Emperor of emperors
who has made you an emperor...

1162
02:56:28,408 --> 02:56:30,616
He shall never forget!

1163
02:56:31,294 --> 02:56:34,918
On the day of judgement,
you shall be accused

1164
02:56:35,241 --> 02:56:38,318
And I shall have justice!

1165
02:56:38,707 --> 02:56:40,239
Take her away!

1166
02:56:45,833 --> 02:56:50,636
My child! Emperor, my child!

1167
02:58:53,853 --> 02:58:55,613
Seek what you will

1168
02:58:55,811 --> 02:58:59,849
The Emperor has reneged on his
promise. What else is there to seek?

1169
02:59:07,331 --> 02:59:08,514
Look

1170
02:59:13,013 --> 02:59:14,292
My child!

1171
02:59:21,901 --> 02:59:24,242
Your Majesty, I am grateful!

1172
02:59:25,656 --> 02:59:26,805
Listen...

1173
02:59:30,662 --> 02:59:36,757
This tunnel will take you past
the border of the Mughal empire

1174
02:59:39,327 --> 02:59:47,183
That Anarkali is alive is a secret.
You will have to keep it a secret

1175
02:59:48,442 --> 02:59:53,923
Salim must know that
his Anarkali is dead

1176
02:59:54,539 --> 02:59:55,818
So it shall be

1177
02:59:56,146 --> 03:00:00,182
The Emperor has done justice
by letting her live

1178
03:00:01,278 --> 03:00:04,134
Anarkali, pay your obeisances

1179
03:00:06,285 --> 03:00:15,904
Till such time that this world is,
you will live as love lives

1180
03:00:17,839 --> 03:00:23,418
And the Mughals will remember
this favour you have done

1181
03:00:24,579 --> 03:00:30,096
Unto the dynasty of Babur and Humayun,
you have granted a fresh lease of life

1182
03:00:31,992 --> 03:00:33,623
But I...

1183
03:00:36,130 --> 03:00:39,787
I can offer you nothing
but a life of anonymity

1184
03:00:41,077 --> 03:00:43,022
I am helpless

1185
03:00:43,610 --> 03:00:46,038
By God, I am no enemy of love

1186
03:00:47,686 --> 03:00:50,377
But of my principles
I am a slave

1187
03:00:51,247 --> 03:00:54,421
Consider the helplessness
of the slave...

1188
03:00:55,258 --> 03:00:58,083
and you might yet forgive me

1189
03:01:00,072 --> 03:01:04,362
Anarkali, The Emperor
has expressed his gratitude!

1190
03:01:06,877 --> 03:01:08,958
Take her away

1191
03:01:53,156 --> 03:02:02,142
Emperor Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar
pardoned Anarkali

1192
03:02:02,783 --> 03:02:08,879
He took the blame for being
cruel and merciless

1193
03:02:10,262 --> 03:02:13,951
I stand testimony of the justice
of this ruler...

1194
03:02:14,338 --> 03:02:18,178
the one whom the world remembers as
Mughal-e-Azam
