1
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,437
You are going to meet
a prospective groom in an hour.

2
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,141
Sister, I toId dad that you're not
interested in marriage now.

3
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,875
But unIess you marry,
I can't marry, you know.

4
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,215
Known peopIe from India,
groom is good man and handsome.

5
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,955
We are not asking you to marry him,
just meet him, that's aII.

6
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,232
If you reject him,
we'II find another one.

7
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,956
But I'm sure you'll Iike him.

8
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,941
I can tell you this after you
finish your yoga exercise,

9
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,575
but you don't give me time then.

10
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,076
This is his photo.
You carry on with your yoga.

11
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,986
First time I've arranged to meet
a prospective bride,

12
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,288
You must Iike her, that's it.

13
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,527
I came to MaIaysia unabIe
to bear your torture.

14
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,363
I'll meet her and decide.

15
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,433
You've come here,
that's why I'm tllIing you again.

16
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,194
I know very well about you,

17
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:32,104
like  others I won't say you must
marry her because she's rich.

18
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,779
Marry her, you'll be fine.

19
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,542
If you say no, I won't threaten to
jump down from MaIaysia towers,

20
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,115
I'll  jump.

21
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,362
Meeting  in train.
Good .

22
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,368
Our parents blackmailed
for this to happen.

23
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,965
Actuay this is better

24
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,443
meeting you at home with
entire family watching us,

25
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,703
it's embarrassing.

26
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,706
I mean meeting a prospective groom.

27
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,612
First time in train.

28
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,052
Actually, I Iike simpIe marriage.

29
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,054
Me too!

30
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,554
But my dad wiII not accept.
He arranges a grand wedding.

31
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,160
What is your name?

32
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,330
Actually, I don't like this meeting.

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,632
That's why I didn't get to
know your name aIso.

34
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,332
Anyway I came, now it's okay.

35
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,979
Everything is good, can you change
your name for my sake?

36
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,423
If anything I hate in this worId,
it's the name Kayan.

37
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,027
I hate the man named KaIyan.
- Why?

38
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,257
I Ioved him once, that's why.

39
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,533
I get furious even to
think about him.

40
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,338
He's my ex-boy friend.

41
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,885
I met him.

42
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,118
Your mother knows that you've eIoped.

43
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,897
Her men have swarmed the city.

44
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,864
Who did you faII in Iove with?

45
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,565
His name is Azam,
resident of ToIichowki,

46
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,066
our QuaIis driver.

47
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,640
Not about him,
teII me about your Iover.

48
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,246
He's my Iover!

49
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,476
Is he your Iover?

50
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,907
Do you know he cut fourteen
times for me?- What?

51
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,585
Yes, how can I not faII
in Iove with him?

52
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,385
Madam, I fiIIed the vehicIe's tank.

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,250
I mean Shreya.

54
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,992
Do something.
- How can I avoid now?

55
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,761

00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,311
Who is she?

00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,981
My friend, brother.
- My cIose friend.

71
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,213
I can see it.

72
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,978
Be Iike a friend onIy,

Did you teII about the Nagarjun circIe?

82
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,402

Did you teII about petroI bunk
near check post?

84
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,240
You're cheating.
- Are you married?- No.

85
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,241
You're not married but
arranging a marriage?

86
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,073
Are you married?
- Twice!

87
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,249

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,747
Come, Iet's go.

I'm your best man. She's bridesmaid.
Do you know to run?

Why are you wearing a sari as

93
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,352
Are we not going to a marriage?

94
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,426
It's an eIoped marriage,

95
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,360
there may be chases, attacks,
may get shredded into pieces aIso.

96
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,928
They don't know our pIan, right?

97
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,602
What if anyone Ieaks it to them?

98
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,772

Why haven't your men

104
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,790
They have aIready Ieft.
Manage them for two minutes.

105
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,721
TeII them to come quickIy or eIse

106
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,625
No! I'II kiII them.

113
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,998
Run...run...run...

114

Can't you run, why do you

00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,012
Run...run...

Why are you stopping us?
Why did you bring her?

119
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,698
Don't fight now...
- They are catching up, run fast...

120
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,864
Why are you going that side?
Come this side.

121
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,700
No way, you come Azam.
- Hey you...

122
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,538
Boys! They went this side, you go.

123
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,208
Got caught with them.
- It was her idea.

124
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,545
TeII her that, you fooI!

125
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,821
AIIah, the great!
Whatever you say is coming true.

126
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,049
I said that's why it's happening.

127
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,888
Questions or Iives?
- Lives!- Then, come with me.

128
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,627
My Iife is about to end.

129
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,070
Sit down quickIy.
- Do it quickIy, priest.

130
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,242
Where's the auspicious thread?

131
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,911
What's this auspicious thread?
- I'II get it, wait.

132
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,739
Get it fast. Come fast.

133
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,755
You idiots! What are you doing here
when they are marrying up there?

134
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,925
What are you doing here, aunt?
Come, Iet's go up.

135
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,419
Come on boys...come on...

136
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:47,103
I'II escape!
- Azam, tie it!

137
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,109
I'II tie.

138
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,106
Tie it to me.

139
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,784
I'II tie.
- Tie around my neck.

140
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,555
Stop!

141
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,697
You gave information about the marriage
and then conducted it yourseIf.-Yes.

142
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,227
Did you give the information
about my marriage?

143
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,139
Why?
- For kick!

144
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,570
BIoody kick!

145
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,134
Yes, do you've to come
here to marry?

146
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,041
Can't you change garIands standing
before a God's photo in your room?

147
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,807
In future if anyone asks,
how did you marry? it's a big story!

148
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,544
There were chasings, jumpings,
missings, shootings,

149
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,486
when you teII Iike this, how thriIIing it'II be
for you to narrate and others to hear it.

150
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,491
How duII marriage wouId be if there's
no story to teII.- Are you mad?

151
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,163
We wouId've Iost Iives had
we been caught, you know that?

152
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,494
SiIIy Iives! Who cares if we Iose it!
You won't get kick of thriII often. Shut up!

153
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,169
WiII you put our Iives
in danger for your kick?

154
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,105
I don't care why you did
aII this, brother,

155
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:52,173
I was sad for not marrying
in my mother's presence,

156
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,506
but you got us married
in her presence.

157
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,679
It's giving me a good kick!

158
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,681
My God bIess with kicks aII your Iife!

159
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:10,955
I'm an MLA, you made me run on
streets Iike a mad dog,

160
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:16,197
I'II not spare you, I'II make you
faII and beg at my feet.

161
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:21,704
I swear on the Goddess Durga
on the hiIIs of IndrakiIadri,

162
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,102
if you dare to turn towards me
or my peopIe,

163
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,206
water wiII not fIow in river Krishna,
it'II be your bIood.

164
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,050
Did you expect this diaIogue?

165
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,311
This is not Vijayawada,
and I'm not doing that character,

166
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,455
aunt, I'II take Ieave now, bye.

167
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,456
Who is this crazy man?
WiII he put Iives in danger for his kick?

168
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,728
Is he human?

169
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,724
Did you get this doubt now?
I had this doubt 30 years ago.

170
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,125
If you want to know, see there!

171
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,226
His parents were happy
for having a son,

172
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,567
any chiId wouId cry on birth,
but he neither cried nor Iaughed,

173
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,743
thinking a dead chiId is born...

174
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,751
...they didn't know they gave
birth to a rascaI.

175
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,250
Poor parents thought it was Iuck,
but he thought it was kick.

176
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,822
He started to grow up.
His kick aIso grew up with him.

177
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,486
One day when I was swimming,

178
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,388
his father too brought him
to teach swimming.

179
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,033
I know to swim but he
doesn't know to swim.

180
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,101
To him safe without getting drowned,
his father put a tube around his waist.

181
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,597
He removed the tube and
jumped into the pooI.

182
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,209
Sparing him,
they took me to the task.

183
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,112
His father asked him after
puIIing him out of the pooI,

184
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,951
how did you Iose the tube?

185
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,554
He said, I removed it, father.

186
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,190
His father asked, why?

187
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,622
He said there's kick onIy if I swim
without the tube, father.

188
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,292
Ever since then he has been getting
kicks using me as a bait.

189
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,569
He Iearnt to swim without
the heIp of tube.

190
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,473
Since then his father started foIIowing him
instead of trying to understand him.

191
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,304
He's no different guy,
he's just Iike us onIy.

192
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,479
We get kicks in IittIe things.
That too sometimes onIy.

193
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,482
But he...

194
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,652
every moment...
in everything he does...

195
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,825
he searches for kick,
that's his probIem.

196
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,985
Some say he's very smart!
Some say he's mad!

197
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,165
Some say he's different!

198
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,435
But as far as I know,
he's a fooI and an idiot!

199
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,003
Look, how you got shocked
Iistening about him.

200
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,173
Think about spending time with him?

201
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,177
I didn't want to meet him
again in my Iife.

202
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,111
But, I had too meet him.

203
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,011
For my sister's sake.

204
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,350
This guy...?!

205
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,850
He's mad man,
how can you faII in Iove with him?

206
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,256
Where did you meet him?

207
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,356
I saw him from distance
and feII in Iove with him.

208
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,188
You must heIp me.
Or eIse I'II kiII myseIf.

209
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,531
Where can I find him?

210
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:21,478
Within a month you changed our company
with your ideas and schemes.

211
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,314
You made us give a run for their money
to nationaI mobiIe companies.

212
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,827
I'm resigning sir.
- Why?

213
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,227
That is...
- Company can't Iose taIent Iike you.

214
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,492
TeII me what do you want?
- I want kick sir.

215
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,404
Who are you?

216
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,511
Who am I?

217
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,576
Is it you who got caught that day?

218
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,082
What's that matter?
- I want to taIk to you.

219
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,917
Go ahead.

220
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,757
My younger sister is
in Iove with you.

221
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,263
Loves me? Is she beautifuI?
Or is she Iike you?

222
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,098
WiII you aIIow me to say?
- Go ahead.

223
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,937
My sister is mad girI,

224
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,264
she saw you from a distance
and feII in Iove with you,

225
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,608
she doesn't know anything about you,
that's why she feII in Iove with you.

226
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,106
Do you know then?
- I know.

227
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,344
You...you don't have friends,
no parents, aII are same to you.

228
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,447
You pIay with others' Iives
for your kick.

229
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,447
You're a thief to steaI
others' ideas too.

230
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,619
You're a cheap character.

231
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,881
I know everything about you...
and then...

232
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,357
Don't think I don't know anything,

233
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,287
I know how you pushed Azam into
the swimming pooI as a kid.

234
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,123
You made your dad see
stars in dayIight,

235
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,299
why do you need Iove and marriage?
Is it necessary to you?

236
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,126
No, pIease don't stop,
continue your fIow...

237
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,965
BIoody idiot! You're insensitive.

238
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,970
Ain't I right?
- Yes.

239
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Do me a smaII favour.
- What is it?

240
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,139
Change my sister's heart.
Make her hate you.

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,308
Just teII truth abut you,
she'II change instantIy.

242
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,815
What are you waiting for then?
Come, Iet's go and teII her.

243
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,827
Wow! What a great beauty!

244
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,154
Face is beautifuI,
structure is terrific,

245
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,829
why did you say she's
an average Iooking girI?

246
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,991
What's this Subbu?

247
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,826
If you Iove me so much why didn't
you come straight to me?

248
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,730
Do we need brokers Iike
her in between us?

249
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,502
Subbu, you're too good to faII in Iove
with a mad man Iike me.

250
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,005
Stay out! Trust me Subbu,
I'm a fooI!

251
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,936
Worst feIIow! Rogue!

252
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,745
What do you caII that...?
An item boy!

253
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,173
I pIay with others' Iives for my kick.

254
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,087
I kiIIed Azam by drowning him
in the pooI.

255
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,681
Yet to find his body.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,620
Your sister knows it,
didn't you teII her, fooIish girI?

257
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,692
Keep aside aII this,
I'm in madIy Iove with a girI.

258
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,857
My Iife is aII hers,
yet if you stiII Iove me, come with me.

259
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,029
Are you dropped?

260
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,136
Who is the innocent girI
you Iove, KaIyan?

261
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,548
Who eIse? Your eIder sister!

262
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,813
Do you think is it a joke?

263
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,391
Any man wouId desire a woman who
understands him weII to be his wife,

264
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,996
nobody eIse can understand me
so weII in so short time.

265
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,896
Moreover a girI Iike you in my Iife
wiII reaIIy give me a kick.

266
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,730
 get fixed, your Iife is settIed.

267
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,579
I asked your heIp to fix him for me,
wiII you fix him for yourseIf?

268
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,524
Fix him for myseIf? My foot!

269
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,685
He's a big transformer,
you'II get bIown up on touching him.

270
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,164
Why did you trap him then
knowing very weII about him?

271
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,766
Did I trap him? I went to him for you
but he feII for me.

272
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,101
What an act?
You wanted him.

273
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,770
Can't you understand words?

274
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,277
Your Iife wiII pop out Iike corn
if you go to him.

275
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,608
If I can become popcorn,
what about you then?

276
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,283
Hey you...

277
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,282
I thought their father Ieft them
here going to MaIaysia,

278
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,114
now I know he got rid of them.

279
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,052
You bIew up my Iove,
he'II make you pay dearIy.

280
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,954
Your Iife wiII go to the dogs.

281
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,788
What do you mean by going to dogs?

282
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,122
This is it!

283
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,292
You stoIe everything from me
since our chiIdhood.

284
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,803
You steaI him aIso. Go!
- You...UncIe!

285
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,201
TeII me uncIe, a useIess man
said I Iove you to me,

286
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,473
I'm furious,
I must do something to him,

287
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,813
why are you siIent?
TeII me...

288
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,417
TeII me, what shouId I do?
TeII me...

289
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,717
ShaII I kiII him?
- Just do it.

290
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,825
I'II manage the consequences.
KiII him!

291
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,540
How Iong wiII you stare at me?
Say something!

292
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,401
He says to keep shut.

293
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,343
TaIk in TeIugu.

294
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,536
I don't know to speak in TeIugu.

295
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,580
You said in TeIugu, right?
- I know onIy that Iine.

296
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:30,355
He'II not Iisten, break into a jig.
- Hey! what are you doing?

297
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,688
You said to break into a jig.

298
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,134
Vijay Dinanath Chowhan,
my fuII name,

299
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,860
I poIished shoes, did you do it?

300
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,702
I cIeaned cars, did you do it?

301
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,871
You bIoody!

302
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,472
Okay, I'II come to the point.

303
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,379
It seems you said
I Iove you to that girI.

304
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,444
I'II teII, it's my wiII and wish.

305
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,716
Who is she? Great item!

306
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,549
Is she from your neighbourhood?

307
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,724
Neighbourhood? My foot!
Do you know who I'm?

308
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,553
Don!
- That's me!

309
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,889
Brother! Is it you?
It's my mistake, pIease forgive me.

310
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:11,058
Don't pat on my head.
Don't rap my head.

311
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:24,081
Brother, pIease forgive me.
- PIease, puII him away from me...

312
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,251
Are you a man?

313
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,422
You feII on feeI seeing few goons.

314
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,188
Even kids are better than you,
he'II fight for his Iove.

315
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,429
Drown yourseIf, you coward.

316
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,092
I paid this idiot Rs.10000
for you, totaI waste.

317
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,491
Did you take Rs.5000?

318
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,761
I got tensed because of you.

319
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,766
I brought knife to kiII you,
it is aIso waste.

320
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,611
What's this boss?
He's enjoying her wiId abuses aIso.

321
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,111
In what Ianguage did she abuse him?
- TeIugu.

322
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,442
This mad man doesn't
know TeIugu, right?

323
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,943
Why are you aII Ieaving?

324
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,691
Aren't you satisfied with the stick?
- CaIcuIation didn't taIIy.

325
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,128
KiII him boys!

326
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,394

327
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,198
What's your pIan?

328
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,372
She's fooIish to caII you guys and
you dared to beat me aIso.

329
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,977
If I hit you back,
she may faII for my heroism,

330
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,807
she may come to me and
say I Iove you, which I don't Iike.

331
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,315
if you beat and wound me,

332
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,144
she may feeI sympathy
and faII in Iove with me,

333
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,821
I don't Iike that aIso to happen,
how is my pIan?

334
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,823
Good...very good...
Beat him boys!

335
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,333
BIoody! No kick in the fight.

336
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,938
You guys attack with weapons
and I'II fight without weapon.

337
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,943
Come, Iet's fight it out!
- You're finished!

338
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,361
Where are you going away?
Who wiII faII and break the gIass?

339
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,363
Brother...I'm innocent...
a smaII doubt.

340
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,702
You speak TeIugu so weII,
why did you then open the scene in Hindi?

341
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,536
I got bored speaking
in TeIugu since morning.

342
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,376
Now the matter is...

343
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,376
Got it?

344
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,044
Who beat me first from behind?

345
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,222
He started speaking in TamiI now.

346
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,719
Do you know TamiI aIso?

347
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,653
Language is not important now,
escaping is.

348
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,121
If we get caught, we are gone.

349
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,067
I'm finished!

350
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,903
No more waiting, the finaI touch!

351
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,252
Oh my God! She saw it.

352
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,348
Don't faII in Iove seeing this scene.

353
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,159
I'II try sincereIy, you say no,
abuse me or even beat me.

354
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,495
I've great expectations from you.

355
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,267
PIease don't faII in Iove easiIy.
I'II not have any kick.

356
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,265
I must have it.

357
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,267
You bIoody!
- I want such reactions onIy.

358
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,629
Hey Naina, my darIing...

359
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,751
Don't Iook at me...

360
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,863
Don't taIk to me...

361
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:07,267
I too know you've taken
a IittIe Iiking on me...

362
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,440
Though against odds...

363
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,610
I'm brave enough to take you...

364
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:19,876
ShaII I show my courage
to attract you?

365
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:26,282
That's why I'II get you so easiIy...

366
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:34,455
Is it sport or hunting?
This endIess Iove...

367
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,382
If I say I Iove you
giving you a rose...

368
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,390
Won't you say I do
faIIing for my charm?

369
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,630
WiII you give me a biII?

370
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:23,067
In Iove or victory,
just a desire wiII not heIp...

371
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:29,907
You'II not get without trying
with aII your might...

372
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:24,457
Without making me go mad for you?
What's the thriII if I get you easiIy?

373
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:30,968
There's no kick in Iove if I get it
without taking any risk...

374
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:37,308
My motto of Iife is
take it easy poIicy...

375
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:44,079
I've my own caIcuIations and pIans
to win against aII odds...

376
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,666
Who is that man to pinch my hips?

377
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,337
He pinched me here.
- Pinched me too!

378
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,096
Who is he?
- Who is that idiot?

379
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,346
What happened?
- Somebody misbehaved with us.

380
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,111
Misbehaved with you?
Did he reaIIy do it?

381
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,515
Where did he pinch you?
- Father!

382
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,862
Stop overacting,
you were the Ione man inside.

383
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,587
If they find it out,
your box wiII get ripped out.

384
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,463
Did you say something?

385
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,367
I don't know whether he said
that or was it my haIIucination.

386
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,040
But I got the message.

387
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,805
Take him away.
- Are you going to ogIe at girIs?

388
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,879
If mother comes to know your games,
the stick wiII break.

389
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,380
I'm getting irritated.
Take him away.

390
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,386
Who made Biriyani with jaggery?
- It's me.

391
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,155
I joined recentIy.
I did it for a variety. Isn't it good?

392
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,726
Who made Upma with fIour?

393
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,902
I did it. Is it very tasty?
- It tastes Iike your face.

394
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,400
So, it must be good. Stop...

395
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,738
Looks Iike you come wherever I go.
You're foIIowing me.

396
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,410
Don't faII in Iove so soon.
- Am I foIIowing you?

397
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,904
I advised my sister not
to faII in Iove with you.

398
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,079
How can I faII in Iove with you?

399
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,742
Do anything you want.
But I wiII never Iove you.

400
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,250
You are aIready in Iove with me.
You don't know that.

401
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,680
I don't Iove you.

402
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,918
I wiII Iove anyone in this worId
except you.

403
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:03,423
Anyone..?
- Just anyone.

404
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,596
You idiot. Come here.

405
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,428
Him too...?

406
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,033
I wiII Iove him.

407
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,611
This baId head.

408
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:21,943
He wiII wear a wig.

409
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,209
This short feIIow...?
- He wiII wear heeIs.

410
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,176
And what about this beIIy?

411
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,444
I'II have Iiposuction.

412
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,950
What is your name?
- HaIwa Raj.

413
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,893
Let's faII in Iove.

414
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,903
Wow....! What a kick!

415
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,704
With this I wiII give you something big.

416
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:57,642
Where did he go?

417
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,646
You short feIIow! You mad!

418
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,654
I'm HaIwa Raj & not mad.

419
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:17,324
If you dare to Iook at her or
taIk to her, I'II squeeze you.

420
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,330
What speciaIty do you've
for that girI to faII in Iove with you?

421
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,168
Do you have a baId head
or a big beIIy?

422
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:26,332
Show me one part which is
beautifuI in your body. Show me.

423
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:31,345
HaIwa Raj, you are no ordinary man.
You stunned her in just one Iook.

424
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,346
From today onwards,
I'm your biggest fan.

425
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,513
Whenever you need information
about that girI, come to me.

426
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,019
I'm aIways ready to serve you.
- I Iike you.

427
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,020
Let's proceed for the
bride seeing ceremony.

428
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,692
I think proceeding too fast
isn't that good.

429
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,694
You are a youth icon.
Let's go, taIk & fix the date.

430
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,365
Moreover the competition is too stiff.

431
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,534
Then, Iet's go now.
- Do you have a bike?

432
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,032
I have a car. - Crap!
- What happened?

433
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,703
My foot! There's no kick in car.

434
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:59,374
Just imagine...You on a bike
and she behind you.

435
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,053
Is this your bike?

436
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,724
This is fine for me. What about you?
I'II take your car.

437
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,559
HeIIo brother...
- How is the car?

438
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,464
WonderfuI.

439
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,298
Drive at a minimum speed
of 100 kmph.

440
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,736
Let's meet at her home, okay?
- Okay.

441
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,909
I forgot to teII you something.
- What?

442
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,079
The bike has no brakes.
- No brakes...?

443
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,415
Oh God!

444
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,095
Sir...
- What is this?

445
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,594
Didn't you find a better pIace to hit?

446
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,701
You hit me right on point.
- Sir, I just ...

447
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,096
Where is the heImet?
- He didn't give me one.

448
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,430
Who?
- The bike owner.

449
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,264
License?

450
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,940
When the bike is not mine,
how wiII I have a Iicense?

451
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,109
RC book?

452
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,106
I got the bike for free,
how wiII I have the RC book?

453
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,941
I didn't hit you.
- So, you stoIe the bike.

454
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,278
You have nothing with you.
Take him to station.

455
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,946
I beg you. Take anything you want.
But don't take me to station.

456
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,558
So, you wanted the bike!

457
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:37,831
What is the matter?

458
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,407
Love matter.
- Your daughter's Iove matter?

459
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,305
Love between your daughter
and this boy.

460
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,142
I and your daughter are in Iove.

461
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,146
WiII you perform our marriage
or shouId we do it ourseIves?

462
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:00,224
This is an outrage to be faced
by the youth for centuries.

463
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:04,661
EIders never understand our Iove.
CaII your daughter.

464
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,996
Mad, who are you?

465
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,764
I'm HaIwa not mad.

466
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:15,437
You, me in Iove...
- You fooI.

467
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,980
How couId you think that
I am in Iove with you?

468
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,844
You shouId've been
a grandfather by now.

469
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,349
How couId you faII in Iove
with me, you oId man?

470
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,878
Though you are too oId, you stiII
had the guts to ask for my hand.

471
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,950
I Iike your guts.

472
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,154
First, get your parents acceptance.

473
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,168
Now I wiII give that kick feIIow...

474
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,736
Don't worry that we haven't
caught him yet.

475
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,140
I wiII put him in jaiI no matter
wherever he may hide.

476
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,645
I'm right here.
Why are you Iate?

477
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,748
I heard that you were Iooking for me.
I've been waiting for you here.

478
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,979
What?
- I had an unfuIfiIIed wish.

479
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,317
I want to get booked on some case and
go to be jaiI in the poIice station.

480
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,327
Today, my wish is fuIfiIIed.
Come inside. We wiII taIk.

481
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,333
Is poIice station any
government guest house?

482
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,664
You seem to be very happy.
- Forget aII that. What is the case?

483
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,670
It seems you're after her.

484
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,672
And you troubIe her not to
faII in Iove with you.-Yes.

485
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,003
How couId that be a case?

486
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,679
Why are you quiet?
Who gave you the poIice job?

487
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,511
When you fiIe a case,
there shouId be no counter arguments.

488
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,516
What wiII you say?
- Rape...!

489
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,683
FiIe a case of attempt to rape.
Why attempt? Make it I raped her.

490
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,026
I wiII be jaiIed for atIeast 6 years.

00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,854
Where the heII did you find him?

492
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,689
Writer, you write the FIR.

00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,023
You be ready.

494
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,191
You guys get ready with batons.
Beat me bIack & bIue.

495
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,032
Who are you man?
Where did you come from?

496
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,870
PIease don't ask me that.
- Why?

497
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,875
Don't ask me my address.
My father Iives there.

498
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,880
Looks Iike he is afraid of his father.
CaII him...

499
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,544
Stop it. It'II become a big probIem.
Don't caII him here. PIease sir.

00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,050
TeII me. Try to understand.
You don't know about my father.

501
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,888
TeII me. TeII me.

502
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,895
Where? Where is my son?

503
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,226
What a son you've?

504
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,234
Did you kiII him or not?
- KiII him? This is just an eve teasing case.

505
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,906
What eve teasing? You shouId've
kiIIed him on an encounter.

506
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,574
Encounter?

507
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,573
What poIice are you? Where is he?
Where is my son?

508
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,075
He maIigns my name.

509
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,077
Hey KaIyan...where are you hiding?

510
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,749
PIease father...

Father...- PIease stop it.
Listen to me, father.

512
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,422
Where did he come from?

513
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,766
If son is haIf mad,
his father is fuIIy mad.

514
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,098
Listen to me, father.
- Don't hide behind tabIes & chairs.

515
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:36,603
Where are you running?
- Why are you hitting you son so badIy?

516
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:41,774
WiII you kiII him?
- He shouId be either kiIIed or buried.

517
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,049
Crap!

518
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,117
If you hit me anymore,
I wiII stab you from behind.

519
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,623
I wiII rather shoot you.

520
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,794
Stab you...
- Shoot you.

521
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,121
Stab you...
- Shoot you.

522
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,629
Stab you...
- Shoot you.

523
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,300
You are finished.

524
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,137
What happened?

525
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,814
He came. He shouted.
He shot. And he Ieft.

526
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,212
What shouId I do now?
- Put on your pant.

527
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,098
In the poIice station, you shot...

528
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,329
Father, you got excited & hit me.

529
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,000
I was just acting & hit you.
Don't take it to your heart.

530
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,181
I saw you. When you got
the opportunity, you hit me.

531
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,184
How is the girI, father?

532
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,177
I don't care about you.

533
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,355
But I've decided that
she is my daughter-in-Iaw.

534
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:07,194
PIease don't mistake us.
I won't Iive Iong. I've cancer.

535
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:14,138
I wiII die very soon.
So, we drink together.

536
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,211
Stop you siIIy acting, father.

537
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,210
He was Iying.
He was Iying to get your sympathy.

538
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,814
Juice one peg.

539
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:24,945
He is a great actor.

540
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,488
You saw him in the poIice station,
didn't you? Sit down.

541
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,387
Don't faII in Iove by Iooking
at my styIe & dance.

542
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,070
Not now. Later.

543
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,735
Father, you have come so soon.
- Cheers.

544
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,586
Madam, he gave you a Ietter,
didn't he? Read now.

545
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,756
If we faII unconscious,
drop us at this address.

546
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,594
Did you drop them?
Wait. I wiII teII you.

547
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,433
You didn't drop them at
the mentioned address.

548
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:25,877
SIowIy...

549
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,945
Excuse me.

550
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,784
One more peg.
- Your mother wiII give you one.

551
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,121
Thanks for bringing them home.

552
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,967
Is everyone in the famiIy a drunkard?

553
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,634
How do they drink this crap!
It stinks.

554
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,641
Hey Kick...here is your sIeeping peg.
Drink.

555
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,581
If there is no kick,
he wiII not drink this too.

556
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,479
Very naughty.

557
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,658
My husband is getting
ruined because of him.

558
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,988
He not an idiot either.

559
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,663
He stood first in schooI,
Inter, Engineering coIIege.

560
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,394
First in everything.
He is not Iazy too.

561
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,168
One day, he came to me saying he
got a job with Rs.50000 saIary.

562
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,433
I feIt very happy.

563
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,508
The next day he came and
said he Ieft the job.

564
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,845
I asked him why.

565
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,171
He said that he has
Iost kick in thatjob.

566
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,679
He keeps taking up jobs
and resigning next day.

567
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,283
Neither I understand him
nor his kick.

568
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,351
I thought he wiII change
if he marries.

569
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,180
PeopIe who know this idiot wiII
not give their daughter to him.

570
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,018
Even our reIatives have
stopped visiting us,

571
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,853
fearing that we might
seek an aIIiance.

572
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:49,021
I want to see him settIe in Iife.
Are you married?

573
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,192
No. I don't Iike him.
I reaIIy don't Iike him.

574
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,873
I shouId be surprised
onIy if you Iike him.

575
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,873
If you don't Iike him,
why did you bring them home?

576
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:09,113
I don't Iike him at aII.
Then, why am I going after him?

577
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,378
Either we shouId Iove someone
or hate someone.

578
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,385
But I have both on him.

579
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,789
I don't Iike the feeIing
that I Iove him.

580
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,053
What is this?

581
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,033
Didn't I teII you not
to Iook at him?

582
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,271
Didn't I teII you not
to taIk to him?

583
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,442
But you never Iistened to me,
O my heart!

584
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,710
You must have taken it easy...

585
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,376
Be it a headache,
be it not your mistake...

586
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,449
Your heart may say, aIas!

587
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,957
You must go through
this torture Iike me...

588
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,975
You brought a change in me...

589
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:46,078
why did you repIy,
O tender heart!

590
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:51,872
Hasn't anyone foIIowed you before?

591
00:45:52,182 --> 00:46:05,391
There wouId have been thousands,
but I never faItered...

592
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:14,400
WouId you teII me why am
I so frustrated today?

593
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,905
WiII you shout at those
who ask for the reason?

594
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,909
Like aIways, did you Ieave
him on the street?

595
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:30,918
Or were you a mere spectator
when he entered your heart?

596
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:19,728
Wherever I may be whatever it may be...
when I see you I'm finished...

597
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:24,135
Whether I am at home
or fast asIeep...

598
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:33,147
I see him.
You have a magic in you...

599
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,980
What is the use of it,
my heart skipped a beat...

600
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,988
Where is the probIem?
What did it say?

601
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,492
It's difficuIt to accept at first...

602
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:52,167
I'm angry on myseIf...

603
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,894
I want to say that.
- I want to hear that.

604
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,322
I want to kiII.

605
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,733
Poor girI! Why shouId I kiII her?

606
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:28,563
A divorce wiII do.

607
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,797
TeII her. She'II beat you to puIp.

608
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,310
You didn't say anything.
It was my haIIucination.

609
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,479
What is this confusion everytime?

610
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,472
Stop staring at me.
Go to schooI. Get Iost.

611
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,245
DarIing...darIing...
- Yes.

612
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,478
I feeI pity on you.
For how Iong wiII you suffer Iike this?

613
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,919
For how Iong wiII you Iive with
this baId head & big beIIy man?

614
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,023
Divorce me.

615
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,529
Marry a handsome young man.
Go.

616
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,269
I wiII divorce you.

617
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,277
No way. I must kiII her.

618
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,278
But how?

619
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,256
It's too dangerous.

620
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:29,991
I wiII mix poison in miIk,
write a suicide note...

621
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,128
I've an unbearabIe stomach pain.

622
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,668
UnabIe to bear the pain,
I'm committing suicide.

623
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,571
I wiII tie a rope to a tree.

624
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:44,312
she wiII drink the poisoned miIk & die.

625
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,041
I wiII bring here,
tie the noose around her neck...

626
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,983
Your father is swinging...

627
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,825
Let's push him...

628
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:03,091
Why are you pushing me?

629
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,737
I'm dead! Oh god!

630
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,334
DarIing...darIing...
Water...

631
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,402
Get me that miIk.

632
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,320
Drink miIk.
- No.

633
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,451
Why is my Iife so bad?

634
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,419
Oh my God.

635
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,720
My branch broke.

636
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,297
It was my tree's branch which broke.

637
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:43,997
I mean to say is that
it wasn't your branch...

638
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:48,035
Why do you Iand on
my site everytime?

639
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,527
Kick...

640
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,699
But she is too good for you.

641
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:59,043
Kick, she toId you not to jump
Iike a monkey.

642
00:51:59,249 --> 00:51:59,943
What?

643
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,280
You're often asking charity.

644
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,647
Is this for you aIone
or for everyone?

645
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:05,446
Just for me.

646
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,589
Where did she go?

647
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,535
You want to say that, right?

648
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,139
I want to hear that.
TeII me.

649
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,037
What?

650
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,008
I Iove you. Say it.
There wiII be some kick in it.

651
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,651
You idiot!

652
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,145
I thought of some variety in you.

653
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,219
But you are begging
Iike a routine Iover.

654
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,055
I am Iosing the kick.

655
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,418
I've Iot of expectations in you.

656
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,826
Keep your expectations aside.
PIease say that.

657
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,257
I Iike you.

658
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,559
Say I Iove you.

659
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,201
What Iove?
- What?

660
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,896
Like & Iove are different.

661
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,504
I Iike you.

662
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,941
We may Iike many peopIe in Iife.

663
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,371
But we faII in Iove with onIy one.

664
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,809
What is she saying?

665
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,007
Are they both different?
I thought they both are same.

666
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,845
Hey kick...
- Yes.

667
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,581
I Iike you.

668
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:14,985
But I don't Iike this.

669
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,961
How dare you hospitaIize us
for a month?

670
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,369
I don't understand
this Konkani Ianguage.

671
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,564
StiII you have to study.

672
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,742
No matter how many
Ianguages we know,

673
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,774
he beats us with body Ianguage.

674
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,640
That's why I'm studying
this Ianguage too.

675
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,745
This time we must kiII him no matter
what Ianguage he speaks.

676
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,107
Hey you...
- Yes boss.

677
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,347
How shaII we kiII him?
- Let's pIant a bomb.

678
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:51,723
Let's pIant a bomb.

679
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,656
PIant bomb for him too.
- Who's that?

680
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,257
You have to kiII him.

681
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,001
It wiII cost.

682
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,439
10 Iakhs...?

683
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,904
Take it.
- For you?

684
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,643
I took a photocopy of yours.

685
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,850
Do I Iook Iike an idiot?

686
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,810
I gave you a bIack & white photo.

687
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,311
How did you get the coIour photo?

688
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,854
I Have Made A Colour Xerox.

689
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,252
You shouId teII me
that before itseIf.

690
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,125
May he go to the dogs!

691
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,161
Wow cash!

692
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,509
My car...!

693
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:43,476
The keys are there too.

694
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,745
Why did he get into that car?

695
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,547
Did you pIant the bomb in that car?
- Yes.

696
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,348
Oh my God!

697
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,582
He gave 10 Iakhs & got a bomb
pIanted in his own car?

698
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,725
Let's go.

699
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,404
You gave me a junk bike.

700
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,906
But you are going in a Iuxury car.

701
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:19,937
Good!

702
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,587
I shouId first pIant a bomb for him.

703
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,836
PIanning to kiII a poIice officer...?

704
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,702
You pIanted a bomb to kiII me...?

705
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:53,239
Now I wiII pIant a bomb for you.
- Run...

706
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,448
UncIe, any father wiII be upset
if his son doesn't settIe in Iife.

707
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,450
But you support KaIyan aIways.

708
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,123
How couId you have so
much confidence on him?

709
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,820
Because he is not Iike me.

710
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,792
When I was a young,
I wanted to become an engineer.

711
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,292
But situations forced me
to take up a job.

712
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,989
Bank Manager.
I didn't Iike the job.

713
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,692
But I am stiII doing it.
I keep everyone happy.

714
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,133
Day times are good.

715
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,674
But the time between
going to bed & sIeeping,

716
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,839
I feeI a pain here.

717
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:26,941
Pain that I couIdn't do
what I wished to do.

718
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,452
A feeIing that I have missed
something in Iife which I wished for.

719
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,687
Many have this feeIing.
I too have that feeIing.

720
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,789
But my son shouIdn't have
that feeIing.

721
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,361
He must do what he wishes to do.

722
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,620
He is not Ieaving the job
because he's incompetent.

723
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,889
He Ieaves it because
he doesn't Iike it.

724
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,465
He Ieaves it because he
doesn't get what he wants.

725
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,862
What's wrong in it?

726
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,568
Everyone is worried about
what wiII he become.

727
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,833
But I wait to see
what he wiII become in Iife.

728
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,468
I don't understand both of them.

729
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,712
I can never change them.
Have coffee.

730
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,614
My son is an idiot.

731
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:01,613
But he is a very good boy.

732
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,115
He Iikes you very much.

733
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,710
WiII you be with him aIways?

734
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,419
Promise me.

735
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,726
You have put him
under a Iot of stress.

736
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,294
He is not eating properIy.

737
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,864
He is struggIing to find the
difference between Iike & Iove.

738
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,432
Say those words to him.

739
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:21,535
PIease say it.

740
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:22,929
PIease say it.

741
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,437
HeIIo, why are you here?

742
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:26,267
Why did you come here?

743
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,239
ShouIdn't I come here?

744
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,080
What?
- What is this?

745
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,279
I thought it was onIy you.

746
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,679
But the entire famiIy is begging me.

747
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,543
Father...

748
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:48,960
What?

749
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,331
You said Iike & Iove are
two different things.

750
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,170
Why did you come here?
Go.

751
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,563
Go away.
Go.

752
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,908
Take your hand.
- What?

753
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,773
Take your hand off
from there, you stupid.

754
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,916
Take it.
- I won't.

755
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,413
What wiII you do?

756
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:18,893
Why did you touch me there?

757
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,062
What are you pIanning to do?

758
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,487
You are strong.

759
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,566
Looks Iike you are exercising reguIarIy.

760
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,640
What are you doing?

761
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,342
You said you don't Iove me.
- But I said I Iike you.

762
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,809
WiII you do such things
if you Iike me?

763
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,942
Come, Iet's commit ourseIves.

764
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:46,382
There wiII be some kick in it.
- Come, Iet's do it.

765
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,018
What are you pIanning to do?
- My parents are at home.

766
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:55,664
If not, by this time, I wouId...
- What are you pIanning to be?

767
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,332
Is that what you meant?

768
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,406
I want to become aII these.
- Stop your nonsense.

769
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,540
Software engineer for your taIent.

770
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:16,708
A poIice officer for your physique.
I Iike poIice officer.

771
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,888
Why don't you try?
- Let's do it.

772
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:24,752
And with that you either become
a Chief Minister or a tennis pIayer.

773
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,561
What? Is it burning you?

774
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,628
I'm aIso feeIing the same heat.

775
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,498
That's why everyone shouId keep
their feeIings to themseIves.

776
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,398
Now the matter is...

777
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,935
Stop Iecturing me and
say I Iove you.

778
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,604
How couId I say that?

779
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,909
You said that everyone shouId keep
their feeIings to themseIves.

780
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,407
Keep it.

781
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,172
Hey you, Iisten to me.

782
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,849
I didn't meet him for
the next 5 days.

783
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,312
He didn't meet me either.

784
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,780
But I was shocked to hear that
he joined a job I Iike.

785
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,754
After that I feIt very happy.

786
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:00,689
From that moment,
my Iife turned very beautifuI.

787
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,999
My Iove feeIing was fresh to me.

788
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,097
I used to be with him for
some reason or the other.

789
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,670
Time fIew away.

790
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,767
One month passed away.

791
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,806
He was waiting to hear me
say I Iove you.

792
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,445
But I didn't say it intentionaIIy.

793
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:21,014
When a boy is made
to wait & go after her,

794
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,912
any girI wiII feeI happy.

795
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,245
So, I didn't want to say that.

796
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,087
The day I shouId teII my Iove, came.

797
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,924
No. He is not the
right man for you.

798
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:31,892
After knowing that you
are in Iove with him,

799
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:35,223
I spent 30 minutes
to know about him.

800
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:39,197
After I knew about him, I feIt I had
wasted 30 minutes in my Iife.

801
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,370
Even I thoughtjust Iike you.

802
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,934
But once I got cIoser to him,
I understood what he reaIIy is.

803
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,344
He is good boy.
- A good boy wiII not do.

804
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,739
You want everything to be perfect.

805
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,812
He is not perfect in anything.
So, he is not the right guy.

806
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:53,744
No uncIe.

807
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,174
TiII now, he didn't Iisten
to his parents.

808
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:59,649
But for my sake,
he took up a job I Iike.

809
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,191
And he is stiII in that
job for a Iong period.

810
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,517
I trust Iove.

811
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,490
I trust him even more.
He has changed.

812
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,157
He Ieft the job in just 4 days.

813
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,167
Confused?

814
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,132
Go & check if you want to.

815
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,111
KaIyan...?

816
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,305
He Ieft the job in just 4 days
afterjoining.

817
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,725
When did you come?
No one toId me that you have come.

818
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,025
Moreover today is saIary day.
That's why I am Iate.

819
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:46,929
Azam needed money,
so I gave it to him.

820
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,730
Too much work, very busy.
- WiII you pIease stop it?

821
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,902
How Iong wiII you Iie to me?

822
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,305
So, you knew it.
Thank God.

823
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,036
I couId neither hide the truth
nor Iie to you.

824
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,442
I was going through heII
for a month.- HeII?

825
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,480
Is it not heII?

826
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,814
There is a meaning if someone
doing job gets up earIy morning.

827
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,080
But if I get up earIy morning,
it Iooks Iike crap.

828
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,882
Moreover I have to pick
and drop you at home.

829
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,083
If you don't Iike it, why did you
take a job I Iike?

830
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,727
What? You Iike?

831
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,762
This job is a part of my Iist
ofjobs I Iike. Try to remember.

832
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,932
Why did you quit the job?
- There was no kick.

833
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,400
When wiII you get the kick?
- I don't know.

834
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,130
I am stiII Iooking for it.
- You won't get it. Never.

835
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:28,401
You don't know to work.
You Iazy feIIow.

836
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,613
I argued with my uncIe.
I trusted you.

837
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,181
So, that's the point.
Your uncIe is the probIem.

838
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,045
Come, Iet's taIk to your uncIe once.

839
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,484
You're upset that I've Iied to you.

840
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,681
My Iies made you happy
for the past month.

841
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,018
Look how happy you are.

842
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,161
Who are you?
What do you do?

843
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,923
Doctor, Iawyer, engineer,
waiter...atIeast cIeaner...?

844
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,930
You have no answers
to my questions.

845
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,194
What shouId I say if someone
puts these questions to me?

846
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,802
I can't say anything.

847
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,404
Don't say.
Leave it.

848
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,935
PeopIe work, whether they
Iike it or not I don't know.

849
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,043
I can't do a mechanicaI routine job.

850
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,509
Anything I do shouId have
a chaIIenge & kick.

851
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,007
Just because somebody is
paying me a Iakh a month,

852
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,241
I can't work sitting
before a computer.

853
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,120
Many peopIe compromise in
this worId. But I won't.

854
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,221
If I Iook back after middIe age,

855
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,118
I don't want to be amongst those who
have very few moments of happiness,

856
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,225
I don't care what I'm doing is
right or wrong or good or bad,

857
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,021
whether I get kick doing it
or not onIy matters to me.

858
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,460
Oh God! How couId I deIiver
so many diaIogues on trot?

859
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,657
GirI, don't take it to your heart,
in a fit a rage we teII many things, right?

860
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:26,892
You'II go mad.

861
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:28,932
Don't touch me.

862
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,904
You charm...you charmed me
into faIIing in Iove with you.

863
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,078
I start beIieving your Iies.
- Naina, don't taIk nonsense.

864
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,576
Why do you Iink everything
with one another?

865
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,476
I thought Iove wiII be happy unIike
the torture you've become.

866
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,344
BIoody crap Iove!

867
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:43,843
BIoody crap Iove?

868
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:46,881
BIoody crap Iove?

869
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,820
BIoody crap Iove...?

870
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,723
Yes, I'm mad!

871
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,166
I've been waiting for a month
to teII you something.

872
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,665
You too were waiting to hear it.

873
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,062
But I didn't expect to say
it in such a situation.

874
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,308
You were after me
to say this for Iong.

875
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,778
I'm saying it now, Iisten...

876
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,211
Anyone wouId say it to unite
but I'm saying to spIit up.

877
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,720
But I don't want you.

878
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:37,462
BHAVANI

879
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,810
After that I came to MaIaysia,
a year has passed,

880
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:51,209
tiII date he never met me again,
he stiII thinks he was right,

881
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:57,156
he's wrong, isn't he?
- I hate irresponsibIe peopIe.

882
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,927
Do you stiII Iove him?

883
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,565
I thought of teIIing you, I did so.

884
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,899
I wasn't interested in marriage
before coming here,

885
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,127
but now I am.

886
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:16,476
I Iike your openness.
It's okay from my side to marry you.

887
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:17,840
Okay to me aIso.

888
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,715
Do you find aII such strange
characters in Hyderabad onIy?

889
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,279
Did you aIso meet anyone?

890
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:30,550
If you've a Iover in your Iife,
I too have an enemy in my Iife.

891
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,290
I'm the most successfuI
poIice officer in India.

892
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,191
There's no case I didn't handIe.

893
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,729
There's no criminaI
I didn't arrest.

894
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,966
I was a roIe modeI for
aII new recruits.

895
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,206
The case fiIes I handIed were
given to them as reference.

896
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:52,279
From goons to mafia,
from hooIigans to terrorists,

897
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:53,773
I gave every one bad dreams.

898
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:59,182
But one thief disturbed me very much.

899
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,714
Not one or two,
he committed 14 thefts.

900
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,654
He decamped with Rs.150 crores.

901
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,097
Government handed his case to me.

902
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,429
Don't know why he's doing it,

903
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,966
don't know where is he,

904
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,832
how is he, nobody knows it.

905
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:44,259
I stood for him...
I caIIed him to take me...

906
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:48,699
I changed my face...
Cheated everyone...

907
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:52,772
I appeared strange...
I raced up the heart's puIse...

908
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,072
Teased mischievousIy...

909
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,844
StoIe sIeep from the eyes...

910
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:10,382
Anyone wiII go bonkers or finished
if he sees me...

911
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:14,791
If I aIIow him to touch me,
anyone wouId become my sIave...

912
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:19,229
If I give IittIe Iiberty on me,
anyone wiII go mad...

913
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:23,565
Anyone wouId die in the
fire of my desire...

914
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:28,107
It's run into the wiIderness...
It's fire of passion of fans...

915
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,303
This attack is fataI...

916
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:36,747
Nobody can stop this
steaIing of hearts...

917
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:41,082
If you make a request,
you'II enjoy the fun...

918
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:46,125
If you tease with romance,
I'II take you to the bIiss...

919
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,678
It seems he's a atest thief.

920
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,373
Without any discrimination,
he's robbing every one.

921
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,383
The doors remain cIosed but
the money inside vanishes.

922
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,577
That's the magic!

923
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:18,259
Forget aII this, I'm giving you
fuII powers as the Home Minister.

924
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,462
CIose down his fiIe swiftIy.

925
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,291
First theft....
- JuIy 5th.

926
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,366
It happened on 5th.

927
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,367
12 thefts in 10 months.

928
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:33,440
According to you, it's Rs.75 crores.
Much more according to me.

929
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,239
He didn't spare anyone.

930
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:45,316
Before robbing doctor, his name
appeared on newspaper a day earIier.

931
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:50,151
Lawyer appeared on TV a day earIier
before he was robbed.

932
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,791
He robbed Minister's home a day
after he commented on the thief.

933
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,591
AII his victims were news makers
before getting robbed by him.

934
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,300
He's Ieaving cIues to us
and enjoying our inabiIity.

935
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,670
He's not a reguIar thief.

936
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:15,108
Hey you! Did you read
the fiIes aIready?

937
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,375
I read him weII.

938
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:21,113
If my guess is right,
his next victim is here amongst us.

939
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,091
Who?
- You onIy!

940
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:24,854
You gave an interview
to TV9 channeI, right?

941
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,426
Is there any ruIe that your
guess wiII come true?

942
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,191
He took charge and shot him.

943
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,004
Check thoroughIy and
kiII without missing him.

944
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:30,481
AII your search is in vain,
because I'm his next target.

945
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,447
He'II definiteIy come for me.

946
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,919
I shot a buIIet into him, right?
He Iikes chaIIenge.

947
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,527
He'II definiteIy counter attack me.

948
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,657
Somebody gave this for you, sir.

949
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,432
I'm going to rob Rs.20 crores
from him in an hour, be ware!

950
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,073
We have an hour onIy,
we must find who is he.

951
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,972
Inform aII TV channeIs. Fast!

952
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,361
Who is he?

953
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,534
Doctor? PoIitician?
Who are you man?

954
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,032
I'm a peon in Revenue office.

955
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,328
Remember that whiIe doing
your duty.

956
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,467
It seems you refused
to do househoId work.

957
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,400
Why are you so proud?

958
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,631
Sir, madam...
- Don't taIk, go get me a tea.

959
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:37,241
Rs.20 crores?!
Who is the mad man to say that?

960
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,053
We don't have time, teII us the truth.
- I beg you sir, pIease Ieave me.

961
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,314
You're hiding something,
pIease co-operate.

962
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:46,221
Co-operate? What do I've?
Nothing, Iet him come and take it.

963
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,090
WouId I be Iike this if I had
Rs.20 crores? Leave me sir.

964
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,131
Sir, he has two bank accounts,
both are empty.

965
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:57,571
What's this troubIe sir? If I don't get tea,
my boss wiII dismiss me sir.

966
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:58,899
I'm going sir.

967
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,548
A Iink is missing.
He won't Iie...no way.

968
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,483
Why did he send his photo then?

969
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,712
He's a thief, why shouId he teII truth?
He can Iie to us, right?

970
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,257
May be the peon is Iying.

971
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,949
Thank God!

972
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,189
My money...crores of my money,
where is it sir?

973
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,503
You said you'd no money.
- Not mine, it's Minister's.

974
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,670
Why didn't you teII the truth earIier?

975
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,305
How can I sir? I'm a proxy,
trusted proxy of Minister.

976
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:06,496
He punched me and took everything.

977
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,107
Who is he? How does he Iook?

978
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:13,514
Rajinikanth...superstar Rajinikanth
punched me and took everything.

979
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,615
I swear on my mother,
it was Rajinikanth!

980
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:21,317
My money...my money...
where's my money?

981
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,991
Mother promise,
superstar Rajinikanth took it away.

982
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,821
BIoody crap! Rajinikanth took it?
Why wouId he take it?

983
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,156
How wouId I know sir?
May be he's starting a new party?

984
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,162
Oh God! He has robbed me cIean.

985
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:38,670
I earned that money by every mean I couId
in aII these years of pubIic Iife.

986
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,842
I beg you, pIease teII me,
where's my money?

987
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,671
I don't know anything sir,
I'II faII at your feet sir.

988
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:49,408
Hey Officer! You took charge with
a promise to catch him,

989
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,848
I Iost crores of rupees,
do something I say.

990
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:56,320
No expression on face,
do something I say.

991
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,558
Thank God, he pIucked few
strands of hair onIy sir.

992
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,080
Wait my partner...wait...

993
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,321
I was expecting your caII.

994
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:29,414
How are you?

995
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,388
Partner? Who is your partner?

996
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,060
You heIped me in robbing, right?

997
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:36,060
ActuaIIy I knew that Minister's
money is with the peon.

998
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:39,063
After I made you my partner in
the pIan and you caught him,

999
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,735
I came to know
where's the money,

1000
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:43,530
it means I made you aIso
my partner in the crime, right?

1001
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,036
Want me to send your share
of the booty, partner?

1002
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,640
I Iike you...

1003
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,071
You're making a grave mistake
by making me your partner.

1004
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,375
You became my partner the day
you shot a buIIet into me.

1005
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,619
If I had been your partner I wouId've
shot the buIIet into your heart.

1006
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:05,418
WantonIy I shot 6.4 inches
away from your heart.

1007
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,822
You're terrific, partner,
but you don't know about me.

1008
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,527
SteaIing isn't your profession,
you're doing it for fun.

1009
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,330
You Iike chaIIenges.

1010
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,804
You can guess it from my
modus operandi, say something new.

1011
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,909
Your body can bear anything.

1012
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,774
You can say it Iooking at my body,
say something new.

1013
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,348
You trust your sense of timing,

1014
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,212
you're cocksure nobody
can catch you,

1015
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,719
above aII you're good in
making caustic remarks.

1016
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:40,321
You can judge it from my words,
say something new, partner.

1017
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:45,398
If my guess is right, you're near by,
Iooking at me whiIe speaking to me.

1018
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,498
Your guess is perfectIy right.

1019
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,104
One more thing,
you're the best one to catch me,

1020
01:16:55,677 --> 01:17:00,080
but do remember one thing,
I'm aIways top and you're aIways down.

1021
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,410
You can never catch me.

1022
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,455
You've hurt my ego unnecessariIy,
and chaIIenged me,

1023
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:13,922
wherever you may hide,
I'II hunt you down.

1024
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,428
How can you catch me, partner?
Do you know how do I Iook Iike?

1025
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,600
You don't know.

1026
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,331
Do you know where wouId I be?
You don't know.

1027
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,238
Do you know who's next victim?
You don't know.

1028
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,205
Do you know where
wouId I be tomorrow?

1029
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,660
You don't want to meet the
character in your story,

1030
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,227
but I want to meet the
character in my story,

1031
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:58,562
actuaIIy I'm here to catch him.
- What?

1032
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:03,873
In the arrogance that I can't catch him,
he Ieft a cIue for me.

1033
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,444
Do you know where
wouId I be tomorrow?

1034
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:08,739
He didn't caII me a Ioser.

1035
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,641
It's a cIever cIue he gave me.

1036
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,747
I took two days to crack it.

1037
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:22,988
This is notjust a word but the
fIight number he took to MaIaysia.

1038
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,759
Right now he's in this city onIy.

1039
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,503
He can't escape from me
this time.

1040
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,967
I'II catch him even if his
shadow faIIs on me.

1041
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:43,746
Can you guide me to this address?

1042
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:48,617
And you...?

1043
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,984
I too don't know.

1044
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,365
I'II fix engagement
next week as you wish,

1045
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:07,940
I'II make other arrangements.

1046
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:22,286
Sister...congratuIations,
your engagement is fixed next week.

1047
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,618
He ignored me.
- Who?

1048
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,453
Who eIse? That kick guy!

1049
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:30,256
BIoody idiot!
- Is KaIyan here? When? Where?

1050
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,530
Why are you so excited?
Why did he ignore me?

1051
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,863
I am sure he's here to ruin my Iife.

1052
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,401
It's him, right?

1053
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:50,274
It's not him...it's not him...
it's him...I'm sure it's him.

1054
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,953
We beIieve that you'II
catch that thief.

1055
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,327
You need any heIp sir?
- I need a journaIist.

1056
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,379
I'm here for my partner.

1057
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,947
I'II definiteIy find him.

1058
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:52,712
Your interview was rocking,
your stiII in the paper is very gIamourous.

1059
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,245
you've a good photogenic face.

1060
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,145
Have you settIed in MaIaysia?

1061
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,250
How's your accommodation?

1062
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,854
Very good,
but weather is hot Iike you.

1063
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:05,290
I thought you'd come
to marry here,

1064
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,493
have you come here cracking
my cIue to catch me?

1065
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:13,461
I feeI Iike shaking hands with you,
wiII you give me a chance?

1066
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,436
Don't rush off buddy,

1067
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:21,269
I'II put handcuffs if I get you
not shake hands with you.

1068
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,310
Even if you refuse,
I'II shake hands with you.

1069
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:28,346
You couIdn't catch me in India,
how can you catch me in MaIaysia?

1070
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,643
Aren't you over expecting, partner?

1071
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,913
When I've come so far using your cIue,
can't I come to you, partner?

1072
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:35,885
You can't!

1073
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,582
I'm giving you another opportunity,

1074
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,487
catch me before December 16th,

1075
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,564
after that even if you want to catch me,
I won't get caught.

1076
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,562
This is your Iast opportunity.

1077
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,075
Thanks, I gave that interview
to Iure you,

1078
01:21:55,977 --> 01:22:00,004
I know you'II caII me back,
and you got caught.

1079
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,518
You gave a good knock-out punch,
I'm your fan.

1080
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,237
HeIIo partner, you've made me
run Iong distance,

1081
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,241
I'm new to MaIaysia,
where do you want me to go?

1082
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,745
Want me to take right or Ieft side?

1083
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,045
I'II take the Ieft side.

1084
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,157
Partner, heIicopter aIso
to catch me?

1085
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,851
You've so much power here?
I need to speed up.

1086
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,328
I need to run!

1087
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:49,816
Why are you so moody?

1088
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,029
Is it about him?
- No.

1089
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,639
New movie has opened,
shaII we go?

1090
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,136
No mood.

1091
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,141
It's him!

1092
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,478
Why is he entering hospitaI?

1093
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,983
This is a speciaI case from India,

1094
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:29,721
he has forgotten the past with
a bIockage after being hit on head.

1095
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,829
He's under observation,
take care of him.

1096
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,595
What's this siIIy meeting
going on here?

1097
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,401
Somebody has hijacked
my patient.

1098
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,009
Why are you staring at me?

1099
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,340
I'II rip out your skin
if you don't answer me.

1100
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,347
He's missing since two days,
I've high BP aIso.

1101
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:54,989
If I get angry, I'II...
...this is my weakness.

1102
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,353
If I don't find my patient,
I'II not spare anyone of you.

1103
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,132
He's a doctor,
why is he behaving Iike this?

1104
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,703
He's not a doctor.
- Then?

1105
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,101
He's the memory Ioss patient
we were just discussing about.

1106
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,474
When he was brought here...

1107
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:24,975
TeII me, who am I?
If you don't, I'II jump down...

1108
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:30,486
Who am I?
Where am I? I know...

1109
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,889
We were scared he may kiII himseIf.
- Now...?

1110
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:41,625
PIease...take one injection...
Iet me give you one shot...

1111
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:44,270
We are now scared
he may kiII one of us.- Why?

1112
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,305
That's what confusing us,
why did he suddenIy change Iike this?

1113
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:50,740
Somebody has infIuenced
powerfuIIy and changed him.

1114
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,746
He has a patient aIso
in our hospitaI.

1115
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,855
Where did you go?
- That is...there...

1116
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,052
BIoody! Do you know how tensed
I was without seeing you for 2 days?

1117
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:12,700
With the probIem you have...
what's that?- Memory Ioss.

1118
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:14,927
Where did you go?

1119
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:18,697
Forgot the hospitaI address
and took time to come here.

1120
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:35,055
What happened, doctor?

1121
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,056
He's under observation.

1122
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:50,661
BHAVANI

1123
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,103
What are you thinking, doctor?

1124
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,510
Sometimes I've a doubt...

1125
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,280
WiII you pIease step out once, doctor?

1126
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:03,782
Give that to me.

1127
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:18,192
How many times do I've to teII you?
You're a doctor and I'm the patient.

1128
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,890
BIoody, you....

1129
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:24,332
You're a patient, I'm a doctor.
- That's what I said.

1130
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,269
How dare you manhandIe me?
I wiII....

1131
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:31,508
Take it.

1132
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:41,581
How dare you beat me!

1133
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:50,857
CerebeIIum is damaged,
cerebrum is battered.

1134
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,431
TotaIIy his brain has busted.

1135
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,034
You mean he can't remember the past?

1136
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,170
Why not? Didn't I get it on
getting beaten up?

1137
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,936
He can remember if anyone
rakes up his past.

1138
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,574
He can if he's beaten up
day and night.

1139
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,386
Are you feeIing for him?

1140
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:21,791
He was mad after kick,
so he Iost his brain.

1141
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,328
Now I'm peacefuI.
No tension.

1142
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,165
I thought he wouId come
to disturb us.

1143
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,827
You don't want him but
you want the gift he gave, right?

1144
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,481
She's much more cIever
than what I expected.

1145
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:48,849
Why wouId you beIieve me?

1146
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,251
But she doesn't know about me.

1147
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,484
If pIan A faiIs, I've a pIan B.

1148
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:59,656
PIay the band!
- PIay the band!

1149
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:07,096
ABCDEFGHI...

1150
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,709
Matter is IittIe serious.

1151
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:28,484
No! Hit high pitch!

1152
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:41,264
How Iong wiII you sing the same Iine?
Come to the point.

1153
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:45,845
Boss, we've memory Ioss...
- That's it!

1154
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:56,354
Boss, we've memory Ioss...

1155
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:04,827
Past has vanished...
Iife is at fuII bIast...

1156
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:09,594
Hit the Iucky chance...

1157
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:21,043
What's this in between Iines
from fiIm 'Chandramukhi?

1158
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,412
I don't remember anyone,
I've Iost my memory...

1159
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,712
Not Iike Rajini but Iike Ghajini...

1160
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:31,085
Brain is empty...
totaIIy it's gone...

1161
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:35,422
I'm having a good time,
don't keep your face duII...

1162
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,896
Ex-girI friends who have Ieft me...
And those siIIy cIashes...

1163
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,060
I'm saying thanks to the
mentaI peace I'm enjoying now...

1164
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:48,834
Good or bad, sweet or bitter,
she's not seen & fIash is not Ieaving me...

1165
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:53,506
Life without Iove is better...

1166
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:58,012
Who wiII bear that
nonsense aII the Iife...

1167
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,982
Poor Devadas feII for Paru...

1168
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:06,320
Your Iover is somebody eIse's wife...

1169
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:08,427
This Iife is better...

1170
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,654
It's better than intoxication....

1171
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:52,268
SiIence is much better...

1172
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:56,432
Spend Iife with empty heart....

1173
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:01,237
AIways fresh is the base of Iife...
Won't every day start fresh for you?

1174
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:05,614
He's Devadas...no he's KaIidas...

1175
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,617
This is fine for us...

1176
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:14,351
We've memory Ioss...

1177
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:58,598
Hey Babe! My heart wiII never stop...

1178
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:16,078
Isn't this Ioss,
a big profit for us, boss?

1179
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:24,598
No battIes or wars or without history,
this Iife is a curse...

1180
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:26,232
So my dear, buddy...

1181
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,425
This Iife is not a curse
but a big boon...

1182
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,870
Oh God! I'm stuck!

1183
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,835
Is memory Ioss a boon to you?
I feeI...

1184
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:41,242
Hey stay out!

1185
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,420
I'II kiII you...
bIoody, I'II kiII you...

1186
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,614
Let's escape!

1187
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:01,963
Is she so angry on me, bIoody bitch?

1188
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,766
Why did you beat him severeIy?

1189
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,465
I shouId've kiIIed him.

1190
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:13,980
He's happy forgetting the past.
Enjoying Iife.

1191
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:17,045
WhiIe faIIing in Iove,
he was happy,

1192
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,909
whiIe in Iove, he was happy,

1193
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,849
even in separation,
he's happy.

1194
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:24,347
Is forgetting past a boon?

1195
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:25,786
BIoody, I'II kiII him...

1196
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:28,257
Sister! You beat him, right?
Leave him.

1197
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:31,625
I'II not Ieave him simpIy.
- What wiII you do?

1198
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:35,196
I'II make him remember our past,
I'II make him remember our Iove,

1199
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:38,770
when he remembers everything,
I'II marry KaIyankrishna then.

1200
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,339
He must die in jeaIous.
And I must watch it.

1201
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,372
What if our parents know it.

1202
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:44,771
I'II not teII,
you too don't teII anyone.

1203
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:47,038
I'II pIay with his Iife
taking him to home.

1204
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:13,740
This braceIet was made in India,

1205
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,870
buyer's detaiIs are taken
before seIIing it to them.

1206
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:18,943
First find the jeweIIary shop.

1207
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:22,539
If you give this braceIet number,
they wiII give the buyer's detaiIs.

1208
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:39,260
Kinsman, our chiIdren have
agreed to marry, I'm very happy.

1209
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:44,063
Yes, I never feIt so happy
even when I made biIIions.

1210
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:45,260
That's why I'm throwing this party.

1211
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:48,533
You said your son-in-Iaw Iives
in MaIaysia, where's he?

1212
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,055
They are aIso beautifuI!

1213
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:29,446
Didn't I say, I'm Jiguru Jingania?

1214
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:32,983
I didn't teII my name, right?
'Run' Prakash Raj.

1215
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:35,955
Dear, didn't your short man
come with you?

1216
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:40,321
What's this dad? AII can't be taII
Iike you, Iook down, dad.

1217
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:43,059
Have you come, son-in-Iaw?

1218
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,391
Why did you come
so Iate, brother-in-Iaw?

1219
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,266
What's this new get up?
- That is...

1220
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:49,800
Kinsman, my son-in-Iaw.

1221
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,829
Nobody knows when I'II come.
- Do you know why you're here?

1222
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:55,571
Just a joke.

1223
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,244
Jokes apart,
why did you change your name?

1224
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:02,847
That is...
- It seems you're here for a year,

1225
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,450
and refusing to go to India.
What's the matter?

1226
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:08,083
I made an attempt to murder.

1227
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:11,891
I tried to kiII a poIice officer in India
by pIanting a bomb in his car.

1228
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,423
It happened because
of a girI and a boy,

1229
01:37:14,795 --> 01:37:18,390
I got scared of getting Iynched there,
so I came to MaIaysia.

1230
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,600
Just a joke!

1231
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,095
It's not a joke, bIoody fooIs!
It reaIIy happened.

1232
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:34,204
Come on brother-in-Iaw,
where's my sister?

1233
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,124
My son-in-Iaw.
- Son-in-Iaw?

1234
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:55,031
Oh God! I got wedged! What if they
come to know I chased this girI?

1235
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:56,965
My brother-in-Iaw wiII
break my back.

1236
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:02,074
They both were in Iove there,
why are these two marrying here?

1237
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,974
He's no ordinary man,
he'II not give up so easiIy.

1238
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,510
Where couId he be now?

1239
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:13,547
Can you guide me to this address?

1240
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,284
This is the pIace.

1241
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:20,925
By the way, you are...?

1242
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:25,463
I too don't know when wiII I come.

1243
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:32,227
I don't know what had
happened to me.

1244
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:40,513
I don't know why I'm here.

1245
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,114
What's going on here?

1246
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,098
I invited you.

1247
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:10,339
He's my friend KaIyan from India.

1248
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:13,170
He's my fiance.

1249
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:19,714
I'II put handcuffs if I get you
not shake hands with you.

1250
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,751
Even if you refuse,
I'II shake hands with you.

1251
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:25,551
He's a memory Ioss patient,
he's here for treatment.

1252
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:27,852
He'II stay with us from now.
- Okay dear.

1253
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:31,297
No need to feeI sorry,
I'm very happy.

1254
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:35,059
Instead of feeIing sad thinking about
siIIy past, I'm peacefuI & happy now.

1255
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:39,330
You bIoody!
- Sister! What's this?

1256
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:42,832
Have you gone mad?

1257
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:44,442
Why are you bringing to our home?

1258
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:45,670
What's your game?

1259
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:47,437
My pIan is...
- Are you pIaying games?

1260
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:50,208
May I teII you?
- You fooI! Who are you?

1261
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:57,223
Are you trying to pIay with me in India
and my brother-in-Iaw here?

1262
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,727
Has he forgotten the past?

1263
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:10,270
Is that why he didn't recognise me?

1264
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,797
Hey Kick! Now I got you
in my hands.

1265
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:19,202
Give me some of your revenge,
aIIow me to stay with him,

1266
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,779
I'II make him see stars in day time.

1267
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:25,841
One smaII request, don't teII anyone
here about our story in India.

1268
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,044
You too don't teII anyone
about our pIan.

1269
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:49,334
Have you Iost your memory?

1270
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:55,008
Now I'II give you kick of the Iife.
SIeeping Iike a Iog.

1271
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:58,343
I'II give him the shock of his Iife.

1272
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:01,479
What's it Prakash?
- UnabIe to sIeep.

1273
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:02,620
Come, sIeep.

1274
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,750
What happened?
- What's that?

1275
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:14,362
This...I hate any cIoth on my body
when I sIeep except this bIanket.

1276
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,470
Come, Iet's sIeep.
- No, I'II not come.

1277
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:21,230
Come Prakash, it'II be warm.

1278
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,740
You mean, are you that type?

1279
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:29,541
Yuck! Our 'friendship' is broken.
- Oh broken!

1280
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,085
What type are you, man?

1281
01:41:35,456 --> 01:41:38,357
My patient Iikes to undress himseIf
and I Iike to undress others.

1282
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,151
Don't you wear brief?

1283
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:49,363
Door is Iocked!

1284
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:53,262
How come I got stuck here?

1285
01:41:53,474 --> 01:42:00,471
Prakash, come.
Your cheeks are Iike sausages.

1286
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:10,749
BommaIi! I'II not Ieave you.

1287
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:18,792
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me! Mother!

1288
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:20,933
Did you show him stars?

1289
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:24,696
I didn't show him anything,
infact he showed me everything.

1290
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:27,164
They are not ordinary peopIe.
- What happened?

1291
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:28,500
Asking me what had happened?

1292
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:31,906
One sIeeps without any cIothes and
another doesn't Iike others wearing cIothes.

1293
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:36,276
I beg you dear, pIease shift me
from that room.- Why?

1294
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,818
They are other 'type' of peopIe.

1295
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,381
Yuck! What the heII are you saying?

1296
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,521
Stay with them for a night,
you'II know it.

1297
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:45,419
He's a sex maniac!
- Worse than you?

1298
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:50,324
You don't say anything
but I hear it. Go away.

1299
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,433
You can't do it,
I'II deaI with him myseIf.

1300
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:56,628
Here he comes.

1301
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,731
You are...?
- Don't you know me?

1302
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:04,870
How can I not know you?

1303
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:07,308
What's this? You don't know me
but you know her?

1304
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,072
You stop.
- We are friends, right?

1305
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:11,183
You come with me.
- Where to?

1306
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:14,477
Dicky? What's this dicky?

1307
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:17,413
Not onIy at night he's different
in day time aIso.

1308
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:22,522
ActuaIIy we are not friends
but Iovers.

1309
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:25,562
Are we Iovers?
I don't beIieve it.

1310
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:27,427
You must beIieve it.
- How can I?

1311
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:31,564
Was I such a vioIent guy?

1312
01:43:33,907 --> 01:43:36,307
Remember it?
- Remember it?

1313
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,737
How can he remember past
with just one scene?

1314
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:41,778
Continue it.

1315
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:44,743
It happened Iike this then...
- When?

1316
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:51,317
Did you think I forgot everything, right?
I remember everything.

1317
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:53,686
What do you remember, sunny?
- Whatever you said just now.

1318
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:56,829
You continue the taIe.
- Do it, sister.

1319
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:06,202
Remember anything? Whatever it is bit,
or scene Iet it be anything.

1320
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,271
A viIIain entered the scene then.
- Who is he?

1321
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:09,271
How wiII he be?
- He's...

1322
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:12,842
Come out.
- He stoIe my bike.

1323
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:17,672
He's short...
- What's his name?

1324
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:18,714
BaId head...

1325
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:28,126
HaIwa...where are you going?

1326
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:29,693
My back is punctured.

1327
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,960
But you're not Iike HaIwa.
- Isn't it?

1328
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:35,691
He's just Iike you.

1329
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:36,999
Where's my bike?

1330
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:39,805
Where's my bike?
- Stop...stop...

1331
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:41,474
Where's my bike?
To whom did you seII it?

1332
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:43,142
You come aside, I'II teII you.

1333
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:46,742
How couId you Iove such a man?
- I don't know.

1334
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:50,077
I'm angry on him,
I hate him...but...

1335
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,547
Whatever he said was
fresh and new.

1336
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:57,514
I Iiked his kick.

1337
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:04,089
Did we Iove so much?
It's good.

1338
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:07,524
Yes, we Ioved each other so much,
do you know why we spIit up?

1339
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,429
No need to know reason for spIit up,
there's good feeIing in what you said now.

1340
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:11,831
Let it continue.

1341
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:14,371
You must hear why we spIit up.
- Leave it.

1342
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,432
No, pIease Iisten to me.

1343
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:21,739
After hearing whatever you said,

1344
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:24,813
I don't know if it's true or faIse,

1345
01:45:25,018 --> 01:45:27,213
I Iiked your character in it,
I Iove you.

1346
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,348
He gave a reverse twist.

1347
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:38,492
You were right sir, a Chennai jeweIIer
made two such pieces,

1348
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:39,791
records show it was soId
to two peopIe.

1349
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,932
Who are they?
What are their detaiIs?

1350
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:44,831
One buyer was our DGP,
another buyer was a girI.

1351
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:46,801
Shop has a photo of hers.
- GirI?

1352
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:50,670
They don't have other detaiIs
but have a deIivery address.

1353
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,703
Go there immediateIy and
find who is she.

1354
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:58,443
He hasn't caIIed even once
after going there.

1355
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:01,644
Can't he work here? Why does he
have to go to MaIaysia?

1356
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,560
You aIways criticized
when he Ieftjobs,

1357
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:11,959
now he's working sincereIy,
Iet him do it.

1358
01:46:17,904 --> 01:46:19,132
Is Swathi at home?

1359
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:21,864
Swathi? Nobody Iives here
with that name.

1360
01:46:22,075 --> 01:46:23,007
This girI.

1361
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:27,111
Who is she?

1362
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:32,713
They give this address onIy.

1363
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:36,181
We are Iiving here for
the past 7 years,

1364
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:39,450
not onIy here, I've not seen her
in this area aIso.

1365
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:49,132
Why did you say you don't know her?

1366
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:52,737
She rejected my son.

1367
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:55,169
She had promised to be
with him aIways.

1368
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,036
Why shouId I teII them about her?

1369
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,879
Don't know why they had come
without even knowing her name?

1370
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:07,349
Hey, pIease Iisten to me...
- I wiII not.

1371
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:09,021
I don't want to hear
fIashbacks of spIit ups.

1372
01:47:09,222 --> 01:47:11,019
I Iike as I'm now.

1373
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:20,789
I feeI something fishy.
- Why isn't he Iistening to me?

1374
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:25,798
I suspect him...
- Why are you siIent? Do something.

1375
01:47:30,076 --> 01:47:31,373
What is your pIan?

1376
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:37,616
Why are you staring?
Do something.

1377
01:47:37,818 --> 01:47:41,015
What can I do? I suspect him...

1378
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:43,346
Say something pIease...

1379
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:48,352
Check, where is KaIyan?
- Can't you do it yourseIf?

1380
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:52,525
What happened, HaIwa?
- Was I here onIy?

1381
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:53,721
You're here onIy, right?

1382
01:47:55,735 --> 01:47:58,829
Though I'm here, I'm not and
though I'm not here, I feeI I'm here.

1383
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:00,233
Do something.

1384
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,670
Something is happening
without my knowIedge.

1385
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:09,041
Hey! If you've guts
remove the veiI and beat me.

1386
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:22,919
Whether you're in veiI or me,
I'm getting the stick, right?

1387
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:24,926
If you've guts,
remove the veiI.

1388
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:30,764
How can I be afraid of you, HaIwa?

1389
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:39,107
I'II teII her everything.
- Go ahead.

1390
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:42,042
With that pIanning to kiII wife,
throwing bombs on poIice,

1391
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:43,580
and escaping to MaIaysia
on fake passports.

1392
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:45,045
Go and teII her.

1393
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:49,948
What's this man?
- Game. Is it good?

1394
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:59,031
He's not a patient,
he has no memory Ioss.

1395
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,124
He has memory Ioss.

1396
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:02,028
Being a doctor, I say this.

1397
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:03,361
No, he has no memory Ioss.

1398
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,127
He has memory Ioss.

1399
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:05,429
No, he doesn't have memory Ioss.
Trust me.

1400
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:07,439
He toId me what had happened
2 years back,

1401
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:09,074
and aIso toId me that
he doesn't remember that.

1402
01:49:09,409 --> 01:49:11,240
He toId me what had
happened 2 years back,

1403
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:12,809
and aIso toId me that he
doesn't remember that...?

1404
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:14,981
ActuaIIy, he toId me that
I am a doctor.

1405
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:16,679
Aren't you a doctor?

1406
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:20,649
It's okay you knew it. But don't teII him.
He wiII beat me to puIp.

1407
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:23,111
Hey you patient...

1408
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:25,219
Where were you?

1409
01:49:25,425 --> 01:49:26,722
Did you find anything about him?

1410
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:28,688
I found everything about him.
- What?

1411
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:30,157
Does he remember his past?

1412
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:32,126
I saw my future.

1413
01:49:33,433 --> 01:49:34,957
Don't pIay with him.

1414
01:49:35,168 --> 01:49:37,227
He wiII cover your face
and beat you up.

1415
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:38,560
Stop taIking nonsense.

1416
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:39,830
Are you pIaying games with me?

1417
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:44,470
Everyone thinks they have
started the game.

1418
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:48,176
But actuaIIy, we are aII
pIayers in his game.

1419
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:49,405
Idiot!

1420
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:55,145
Hey HaIwa,

1421
01:49:55,822 --> 01:49:57,289
what are you stiII doing here?

1422
01:49:58,558 --> 01:50:00,185
You are no ordinary man.

1423
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:03,157
You made that Iunatic a doctor.

1424
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:06,031
How Iong is your game?

1425
01:50:06,232 --> 01:50:07,130
I can't with stand it.

1426
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:08,426
This is nothing.

1427
01:50:08,635 --> 01:50:10,432
This is just an intervaI.
CIimax is stiII pending.

1428
01:50:10,637 --> 01:50:11,535
ShaII I teII you something shocking?

1429
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:12,261
What?

1430
01:50:12,472 --> 01:50:15,032
I'm the thief whom your
brother-in-Iaw is Iooking for.

1431
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:27,876
Why did he come to MaIaysia?

1432
01:50:28,555 --> 01:50:30,819
He used to rob reguIarIy in India.

1433
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:32,685
Why is he quiet now?

1434
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:34,191
Has he quit robbing?

1435
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:40,066
What does December 16 mean?

1436
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,659
There is Iot of time Ieft for that day.

1437
01:50:43,737 --> 01:50:46,171
If he had quit robbing,
why wouId he fix the target?

1438
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,431
Why is he robbing?

1439
01:50:51,277 --> 01:50:52,904
Who wiII he rob in MaIaysia?

1440
01:50:53,113 --> 01:50:55,081
He must either rob the NRIs.

1441
01:50:56,383 --> 01:50:58,817
Or rob those who have
Iink with India.

1442
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,587
Where couId he be?

1443
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:03,983
If he had caIIed from this phone booth,

1444
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:07,085
he must be Iiving in
these surroundings.

1445
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:08,819
But where?

1446
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:25,062
What do you think of yourseIf?

1447
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,629
Is duty everything for you?

1448
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,391
Even after coming to MaIaysia,
you are stiII thinking about that thief.

1449
01:53:28,601 --> 01:53:30,694
Why did we come here?
For your engagement or to catch that thief?

1450
01:53:30,904 --> 01:53:32,064
What if something happens to you?

1451
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:33,901
It's aIright uncIe.

1452
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:35,999
How many peopIe are so
duty conscious Iike your son?

1453
01:53:36,209 --> 01:53:37,676
FeeI proud of him.

1454
01:53:38,678 --> 01:53:39,906
Sir, you're reaIIy great.

1455
01:53:40,113 --> 01:53:41,705
You wiII catch that thief.

1456
01:53:43,783 --> 01:53:44,909
Looking at the fire in you,

1457
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:49,316
if you catch him,
he wiII see his worst nightmare.

1458
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:52,419
You are his perfect partner.

1459
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,252
You wiII catch him for sure.

1460
01:53:54,894 --> 01:53:55,417
He won't.

1461
01:53:55,628 --> 01:53:56,560
He wiII catch him.

1462
01:53:56,763 --> 01:53:57,388
He won't.

1463
01:53:57,597 --> 01:53:58,962
He wiII catch him, you shorty.

1464
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:00,223
You won't catch him.

1465
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:01,430
You stupid.

1466
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:03,769
I'm teIIing you, he wiII catch him.
Why are taIking nonsense?

1467
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,995
Why are you interfering
in our matters?

1468
01:54:06,206 --> 01:54:07,941
I am taIking to my brother-in-Iaw.

1469
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:10,705
You can't catch him even if
he stands infront of you.

1470
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:12,774
You won't catch him.

1471
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:18,384
No way.

1472
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:19,677
Day after tomorrow is
very auspicious.

1473
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:21,148
Lets fix the engagement on that day.

1474
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:23,746
No. I've an urgent meeting
on that day.

1475
01:54:23,957 --> 01:54:25,151
Ministers are coming from India.

1476
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:25,824
ActuaIIy...

1477
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:27,253
Sorry. Don't mistake me.

1478
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,826
This meeting was fixed a month back.
Important business deaI.

1479
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,360
We wiII have it next week.

1480
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:33,023
A month back...?

1481
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:34,431
Meeting...?

1482
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:35,464
Is your meeting more important
than your daughter's marriage?

1483
01:54:35,668 --> 01:54:37,101
CanceI that siIIy meeting.

1484
01:54:37,303 --> 01:54:39,396
Keep quiet.
You remember haIf & forget haIf.

1485
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:41,668
Ministers meeting...?

1486
01:54:46,112 --> 01:54:49,343
As said, fix the engagement
in 2 days time.

1487
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:51,207
Thank you.

1488
01:54:56,055 --> 01:54:58,080
Find out when was the Ministers
meeting in MaIaysia finaIised.

1489
01:54:58,291 --> 01:54:59,553
Oh God! My bIadder is fuII.

1490
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:00,623
Hey HaIwa...

1491
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,019
I can't take this tension.

1492
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:05,356
I don't know how you wiII behave.

1493
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,465
TeII me your next pIan.

1494
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:09,592
I'm pIanning to surrender.

1495
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:11,766
Don't be tensed.
I am not seIfish.

1496
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:12,801
I give charity to everyone.

1497
01:55:13,006 --> 01:55:14,769
Once I surrender,
I wiII teII them your name too.

1498
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:16,768
Even you wiII find some kick.

1499
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:18,669
I'II be back soon.

1500
01:55:20,446 --> 01:55:22,380
What shouId I do now?
- Run.

1501
01:55:24,117 --> 01:55:24,879
You...

1502
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:25,846
You heard me right.

1503
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:27,349
I said that.

1504
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,188
Buy the ticket & run away
before they Iynch you.

1505
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:38,992
You must know why we got separated.

1506
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:39,664
I won't Iisten to you.

1507
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:41,128
This is very important.

1508
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:41,823
DefiniteIy not.

1509
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:42,592
Day after tomorrow is
your engagement.

1510
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:43,427
Go. Get ready.

1511
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:44,500
What are you taIking?

1512
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:45,762
Do you know how badIy you cheated me?

1513
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:46,836
The Iies you toId me.

1514
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,270
Cheating? Lying?
For this simpIe matter.

1515
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:50,407
Is this a simpIe matter.

1516
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:51,804
If you know what reaIIy happened...

1517
01:55:52,011 --> 01:55:52,670
What happened?

1518
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:54,005
I said that I joined the job for you.

1519
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:55,510
I didn't Iike it.
So, I quit the job.

1520
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:57,080
You got the information
from some idiot.

1521
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:58,011
You got hurt.
Is that aII?

1522
01:55:58,217 --> 01:55:58,911
Not onIy that.

1523
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,210
Didn't you caII my Iove siIIy?

1524
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:02,047
If you keep shouting at me,
anyone wouId say that.

1525
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:03,517
You were no Iess.

1526
01:56:03,723 --> 01:56:08,183
I was after you to make
you say I Iove you.

1527
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:10,453
You said that at the time
of our separation.

1528
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:11,992
How wouId I feeI? Frustrated.

1529
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:13,222
What are you staring at me? You were
trying to make me remember something.

1530
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:14,400
You wanted to say something.

1531
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:15,726
C'mon taIk.

1532
01:56:15,935 --> 01:56:16,867
You said you don't remember
your past.

1533
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,059
I say that even now.

1534
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,738
But how did you remember aII this?

1535
01:56:21,741 --> 01:56:22,969
I'm caught.

1536
01:56:25,211 --> 01:56:26,041
It was a Iie.

1537
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,104
Coming to MaIaysia for your treatment?

1538
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:29,406
A naked Iie.

1539
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:31,313
You made us fooIs?

1540
01:56:31,517 --> 01:56:33,382
You're right, that was true.

1541
01:56:41,194 --> 01:56:43,219
I hate peopIe who act Iike you.

1542
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:44,857
Aren't you acting?

1543
01:56:46,699 --> 01:56:47,563
Though I am in your heart,

1544
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:49,325
you're getting ready to get
engaged with someone eIse.

1545
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:51,193
Isn't that an act?

1546
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:55,573
I acted saying that I don't remember past.
And you are acting without saying that.

1547
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:57,003
Not much of a difference.

1548
01:56:58,177 --> 01:57:00,372
Happy moments I spent with you
are more important for me.

1549
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:02,172
You think of our separation.

1550
01:57:02,382 --> 01:57:04,179
You forget things which
you shouId remember.

1551
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,514
Don't cheat yourseIf.

1552
01:57:36,315 --> 01:57:38,306
Is she teIIing me to go away?

1553
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:41,146
Is she teIIing me to come?

1554
01:57:41,387 --> 01:57:43,321
What is your heart saying?

1555
01:57:43,523 --> 01:57:46,185
Do you know that atIeast?

1556
01:57:56,302 --> 01:58:01,103
You storm me Iike a tornado...

1557
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:06,108
I suffocate because of you...

1558
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:08,337
In such circumstances...

1559
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:11,779
Is it possibIe to know
what my heart says?

1560
01:58:11,984 --> 01:58:13,281
Roaring forever...

1561
01:58:56,729 --> 01:59:01,496
The cIouds won't hide the water vapour
and carry that burden...

1562
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:06,798
Like you, it won't hide its Iove...

1563
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:18,780
If you had embraced me
with your warmth...

1564
01:59:18,985 --> 01:59:21,283
my youth wouId have jumped in joy...

1565
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:23,785
If you had struck the right notes...

1566
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:26,254
I wouId've expressed my Iove for you...

1567
01:59:26,459 --> 01:59:28,518
StiII I'm found at fauIt...

1568
01:59:28,728 --> 01:59:32,095
Is that my mistake?

1569
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,872
When you come after me,
I feeI angry...

1570
02:00:24,083 --> 02:00:26,677
When I don't see you around,
I go mad about you...

1571
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:29,286
My heart rages in fire...

1572
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:31,956
Time has no medicine
to cure my heart...

1573
02:00:41,634 --> 02:00:46,401
You fight with your conscious
everyday, dear...

1574
02:00:46,606 --> 02:00:49,006
What wiII your arrogance achieve?

1575
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:51,403
Nothing wrong to accept your Iove...

1576
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:53,670
Stop fighting, sweetheart...

1577
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:57,178
Don't you Iike my arrogance?

1578
02:01:24,644 --> 02:01:26,509
Daddy, I want to taIk you urgentIy.

1579
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:28,612
I'm in an important meeting.
TaIk to me Iater.

1580
02:01:28,814 --> 02:01:29,746
No dad.

1581
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:36,486
Ministers MaIaysia programme
got confirmed on November 8th.

1582
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:38,589
They have come there on
an officiaI visit.

1583
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:46,863
The cIue 'LOSER' was given
to me on November 9th.

1584
02:01:47,066 --> 02:01:49,967
Ministers MaIaysia programme
got confirmed on November 8th.

1585
02:01:50,169 --> 02:01:52,797
So, he aIready knew about
Ministers programme.

1586
02:01:53,072 --> 02:01:55,632
There is some Iink between
their programme & his pIan.

1587
02:01:55,841 --> 02:01:57,809
What are these Ministers
doing in MaIaysia?

1588
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:00,478
Ministers are pIanning
something unofficiaI here.

1589
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:08,746
Banerjee, we earned 300 crores cheating
peopIe & doing aII the wrong deeds.

1590
02:02:08,954 --> 02:02:13,186
We struggIed had to turn
this money into doIIars.

1591
02:02:14,727 --> 02:02:19,096
Your 300 crores is the first investment
for the hoteIs we are going to start.

1592
02:02:19,465 --> 02:02:21,194
Big money wiII change hands.

1593
02:02:21,567 --> 02:02:23,194
He has come here to
rob that money.

1594
02:02:25,237 --> 02:02:28,536
If he had come here months before,
he must've pIanned it weII.

1595
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:30,540
He must've pIanned a game.

1596
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:33,542
There is a Iink between
Ministers & my uncIe.

1597
02:02:33,746 --> 02:02:36,544
So, he must be around them.

1598
02:02:37,249 --> 02:02:39,376
Who is the new entrant
in their famiIy?

1599
02:02:40,486 --> 02:02:41,612
He is my friend KaIyan.

1600
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:45,448
He can't be the thief.

1601
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:47,559
He is memory Ioss patient.

1602
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,625
I'm at peace in this condition.

1603
02:02:49,829 --> 02:02:51,660
Something is wrong.

1604
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:53,388
Thanks partner. How are you?

1605
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:54,566
Who is your partner!

1606
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:56,062
Do you know where wiII
I be tomorrow?

1607
02:02:58,471 --> 02:03:00,234
How many peopIe are so honest in
their duty Iike your son?

1608
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:04,341
Catch me before December 16.
You wiII catch him for sure.

1609
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:13,080
You are his right partner.
You are my right partner.

1610
02:03:23,796 --> 02:03:24,990
What do you say, Swami?

1611
02:03:25,197 --> 02:03:28,928
First, Iet's have tea.
Later, we can deaI with the money.

1612
02:04:16,849 --> 02:04:17,747
Thief...!

1613
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:28,659
Money is more important to me.

1614
02:07:57,636 --> 02:08:01,470
Yes, my son is a thief.
He became a thief for kick.

1615
02:08:02,207 --> 02:08:04,607
He was in search of kick,
but he didn't get it.

1616
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:06,376
But it came Iooking for him.

1617
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:21,125
We are Venkat & Swapna.
We have a daughter.

1618
02:08:21,593 --> 02:08:24,323
I work in a private company.
My saIary is Rs.10000.

1619
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:27,390
Every morning at 8,
I take the Iunch box,

1620
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:31,067
drop my daughter at the schooI,
catch a running bus, go to office,

1621
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:33,804
come back in the evening,
pIay with my daughter,

1622
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,564
sometimes go to theatre,

1623
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:41,574
count our savings severaI times
and feeI safe, this is my Iife.

1624
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:43,245
We've no compIaints on anyone.

1625
02:08:43,449 --> 02:08:47,078
She is our worId.
A peacefuI Iife.

1626
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:49,086
No big wish Iist.

1627
02:08:49,621 --> 02:08:52,419
We were happy with what
was given to us by God.

1628
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:53,754
But...

1629
02:08:57,463 --> 02:09:01,160
We didn't understand what doctor
said about her disease.

1630
02:09:01,967 --> 02:09:05,095
We understood onIy one thing.
It required Iot of money.

1631
02:09:05,604 --> 02:09:07,697
If we don't start the
treatment soon,

1632
02:09:08,173 --> 02:09:12,769
the disease wiII spread aII over
her body, and she wiII die.

1633
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:19,107
From then on, she fought the disease,
and we fought for money.

1634
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:22,114
AII our savings were spent
on her initiaI treatment.

1635
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:23,615
The situation was out of our hands.

1636
02:09:24,323 --> 02:09:25,290
We had no money.

1637
02:09:25,657 --> 02:09:27,454
Even now, we have no
compIaints on anyone

1638
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:29,456
except on our incapabiIity
to save her.

1639
02:09:30,162 --> 02:09:36,067
The day she Iooked at us
to save her Iife, we died.

1640
02:09:36,502 --> 02:09:39,130
If the operation is not
performed in 24 hours,

1641
02:09:39,505 --> 02:09:41,871
she too wiII Iose & die.

1642
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:42,968
We had no choice.

1643
02:09:43,842 --> 02:09:46,310
We can't see her die.

1644
02:09:46,512 --> 02:09:51,245
So, we sent her an orphanage,
and dying before her.

1645
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:54,450
PIease don't mistake us.
We had no other choice.

1646
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:21,238
You're often asking for charity.
Is this for you or for everyone?

1647
02:10:21,446 --> 02:10:22,071
For me onIy.

1648
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:33,690
So, you know the truth.

1649
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:35,252
It's aIright.

1650
02:10:35,527 --> 02:10:38,189
Father went to bring money.
He wiII bring it.

1651
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:39,921
Operation wiII be over.

1652
02:10:42,467 --> 02:10:46,597
It's you who said that if we get things
very easiIy, there wiII no kick in it.

1653
02:10:46,872 --> 02:10:48,271
It's true.

1654
02:10:48,473 --> 02:10:51,772
If death comes easier,
there is no kick in it.

1655
02:10:51,977 --> 02:10:53,604
I'm scared, uncIe.

1656
02:10:54,746 --> 02:10:58,045
You wiII be fine.
Lord Hanuman wiII protect you.

1657
02:11:00,819 --> 02:11:03,617
He wants to pIay with me.

1658
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:13,631
It's a very serious case.

1659
02:11:13,832 --> 02:11:16,300
She wiII Iive onIy if we perform
an operation on her within 20 hours.

1660
02:11:16,501 --> 02:11:18,867
I toId her parents about this.
I'm teIIing you again.

1661
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,301
Operation wiII be performed on her onIy
if you pay 20 Iakhs by tomorrow morning.

1662
02:11:21,506 --> 02:11:22,302
ActuaIIy...

1663
02:11:24,343 --> 02:11:25,867
Okay, I wiII bring it.

1664
02:11:26,445 --> 02:11:28,140
Take a snap.
- Is it?

1665
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:31,475
You're out of HeaIth ministry.
But you're given Home ministry.

1666
02:11:31,683 --> 02:11:32,547
Then, Iet's distribute sweets in jaiI.

1667
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:33,308
Okay.

1668
02:11:34,519 --> 02:11:36,146
This is enough for today.
This is the Iast snap.

1669
02:11:36,855 --> 02:11:39,153
I need to go to jaiI. Bye.
- Sir, I need 20 Iakhs.

1670
02:11:41,593 --> 02:11:44,153
You have expIained me very cIearIy.

1671
02:11:44,363 --> 02:11:46,763
I wiII expIain you very cIearIy.
Try to understand.

1672
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:50,999
Government can't heIp each
and everyone.

1673
02:11:51,203 --> 02:11:52,329
There are few funds avaiIabIe.

1674
02:11:52,537 --> 02:11:54,664
Funds are avaiIabIe...for our benefits.

1675
02:11:55,607 --> 02:11:58,838
Let's not taIk about that now.
Since I Iike you, Iet me teII you the facts.

1676
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:01,508
Since it is a smaII girI,
submit an appIication.

1677
02:12:01,713 --> 02:12:07,015
I wiII heIp you on some grounds.
But you wiII not get 20 Iakhs.

1678
02:12:07,386 --> 02:12:10,844
You wiII get 50 thousand or 1 Iakh.
I wiII get it ready in 2 days time.

1679
02:12:11,823 --> 02:12:12,847
You won't do it.
- Why?

1680
02:12:13,058 --> 02:12:14,116
Though peopIe can work hard,

1681
02:12:14,326 --> 02:12:17,295
you provide rice for Rs. 2 per kg.
and make them Iazy feIIows.

1682
02:12:17,496 --> 02:12:18,360
You give houses for the poor.

1683
02:12:18,563 --> 02:12:19,689
You provide empIoyment
for the youth.

1684
02:12:19,898 --> 02:12:21,866
You provide free eIectricity
and Ioans to farmers.

1685
02:12:22,067 --> 02:12:24,535
During eIections, you waive the Ioans.
You give everything to everyone.

1686
02:12:24,736 --> 02:12:26,863
Why don't you care about chiIdren?
What sin have they committed?

1687
02:12:29,775 --> 02:12:31,709
Is it because chiIdren
are not eIigibIe to vote?

1688
02:12:35,647 --> 02:12:37,808
How much can we get seIIing this house?
- To the bankers?

1689
02:12:38,517 --> 02:12:40,314
This house is on Ioan.
- How much do you have in your account?

1690
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:41,543
Rs. 10 Iakhs.
- Give me a cheque.

1691
02:12:41,753 --> 02:12:43,220
For what?
- I said do it, father.

1692
02:13:16,254 --> 02:13:17,585
Rs. 10 Iakhs...?

1693
02:13:18,123 --> 02:13:19,590
What made you think that
I wiII give you the money?

1694
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:23,591
Since he married my daughter,
I forgave him & made him my PA.

1695
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:26,424
I chaIIenged you that I wiII
make you faII at my feet.

1696
02:13:26,631 --> 02:13:29,600
What made you think that I wiII
forgive and give you the money?

1697
02:13:39,144 --> 02:13:41,271
Who won? Me or him?

1698
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:53,347
To make my heart wet...

1699
02:14:53,552 --> 02:14:58,285
Came this drizzIe of smiIe...

1700
02:14:59,458 --> 02:15:02,859
Time drew it...

1701
02:15:03,061 --> 02:15:08,192
This rainbow of desires...

1702
02:15:13,805 --> 02:15:15,363
What happened, uncIe?

1703
02:15:17,008 --> 02:15:18,032
SmiIe once.

1704
02:15:36,828 --> 02:15:39,729
Today, Tony's dream wiII come true.

1705
02:15:40,031 --> 02:15:43,330
He Iikes to pIay with me.

1706
02:15:43,935 --> 02:15:47,393
SiIence heard by the heart.

1707
02:15:47,606 --> 02:15:50,575
Doctor toId me that I can pIay now.

1708
02:15:50,775 --> 02:15:52,902
He must be very happy.

1709
02:15:56,781 --> 02:15:59,511
Do you have any dreams, uncIe?

1710
02:16:00,785 --> 02:16:01,911
It's aIright.

1711
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:05,087
What's the fun if each one
fuIfiIIs his own dream?

1712
02:16:05,557 --> 02:16:08,583
The fun Iies in fuIfiIIing
others' dreams.

1713
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:36,948
Are you the meaning of Iife?

1714
02:16:58,743 --> 02:17:00,210
It's said that God Iives in chiIdren.

1715
02:17:00,946 --> 02:17:02,675
It seems to be true on seeing them.

1716
02:17:03,448 --> 02:17:07,942
Each one of them has a disease.
They forget aII the sorrows

1717
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:13,851
and feeI very happy since one
of them has defied death.

1718
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,892
Some of them wiII not survive
inspite of good medication.

1719
02:17:18,096 --> 02:17:19,620
But some wiII survive.

1720
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:22,192
But there is no money.
Look at him.

1721
02:17:23,635 --> 02:17:26,934
He wiII not survive for more than 4 days.
He too knows that.

1722
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:33,374
But he forgot that & is happy that she
has survived & he can pIay with her.

1723
02:17:37,449 --> 02:17:39,474
Who has disease? We or they?

1724
02:17:41,486 --> 02:17:42,384
So many of them?

1725
02:17:42,687 --> 02:17:45,554
If there are so many of them
in our orphanage aIone,

1726
02:17:45,757 --> 02:17:48,726
think about the entire city,
state & the country.

1727
02:17:52,764 --> 02:17:56,723
How many are there?
I need a Iist of aII those chiIdren.

1728
02:17:56,935 --> 02:18:00,336
We went piIIar to post to
save one chiId.

1729
02:18:00,538 --> 02:18:02,403
By saving aII these chiIdren,
do you want to be a hero?

1730
02:18:02,607 --> 02:18:04,802
I'm not doing this for the peopIe.
I'm doing it for myseIf.

1731
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:07,504
The happiness I saw in her smiIe...

1732
02:18:07,846 --> 02:18:12,909
If there is so much kick in one smiIe,
think about the kick in miIIions of such smiIes.

1733
02:18:13,118 --> 02:18:15,245
I want that kick.
I want that kick.

1734
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:23,249
The kick started from a chiId's smiIe.
It won't stop.

1735
02:18:23,728 --> 02:18:27,596
Nowadays, peopIe want to be happy
even on someone eIse's sorrows.

1736
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:31,026
He Iooks for happiness in
others' happiness.

1737
02:18:31,569 --> 02:18:35,005
He is not giving any suggestions.
He is not fighting against the system.

1738
02:18:35,407 --> 02:18:38,103
He never orders anyone
to do something.

1739
02:18:38,476 --> 02:18:42,378
He does what he wants to do.
He is not saving those chiIdren.

1740
02:18:42,747 --> 02:18:46,205
He is showing us the kick
in saving others.

1741
02:18:46,484 --> 02:18:50,944
Which father wiII get such a great son?
I get Iot of kick.

1742
02:18:51,756 --> 02:18:55,783
TiII now, I wanted to see
what he wiII become.

1743
02:18:55,994 --> 02:19:00,294
He has now become a thief.
He has become a true human.

1744
02:19:00,498 --> 02:19:01,556
What if he gets caught?

1745
02:19:01,766 --> 02:19:04,462
There is truth in his efforts.
Nothing wiII happen to him.

1746
02:19:04,669 --> 02:19:08,036
He wiII not get caught untiI
he compIetes his job.

1747
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:09,536
Where is he now?

1748
02:19:20,518 --> 02:19:38,358
What if I Iose?
What if I Iose?

1749
02:19:38,536 --> 02:19:42,404
When did you come, boss?
How are you?

1750
02:19:45,477 --> 02:19:46,171
What?

1751
02:19:46,878 --> 02:19:50,336
You stoIe miIIions but
I see you in a toddy shop.

1752
02:19:50,949 --> 02:19:58,856
Foreign Iiquor is boring.
LocaI toddy is too good.

1753
02:19:59,057 --> 02:20:02,618
You ruined aII the money.
Moreover they were doIIars not rupees.

1754
02:20:02,827 --> 02:20:07,855
What if I Iose?
- Boss, you must Iive Iong.

1755
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:11,263
You're the king who gave
us party on Iosing.

1756
02:20:11,669 --> 02:20:15,036
When wiII you Iose again?
- Winners have the say.

1757
02:20:15,507 --> 02:20:17,668
We are Iosers and
they are winners.

1758
02:20:18,309 --> 02:20:21,472
Winner boss...
When wiII you win?

1759
02:20:21,679 --> 02:20:25,877
When you win, we wiII party.
- You are right.

1760
02:20:27,752 --> 02:20:31,279
You're trying to cover up
your defeat very weII.

1761
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:33,957
Cover up? I don't know that.

1762
02:20:34,259 --> 02:20:37,160
OnIy now I knew there
is Iot of kick in Iosing.

1763
02:20:37,362 --> 02:20:41,992
Yes boss. Every time I win and
I've Iost the kick in winning.

1764
02:20:42,534 --> 02:20:49,064
I Iost for the first time in my Iife.
Now I know the kick in Iosing.

1765
02:20:49,274 --> 02:20:51,071
I'II pay the biII.

1766
02:20:51,609 --> 02:20:53,406
When we Iose,
we shouId never worry.

1767
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:55,579
You must ceIebrate it.

1768
02:20:55,947 --> 02:21:00,907
When a man understand this,
no Ioser wiII cry on Iosing.

1769
02:21:01,186 --> 02:21:05,247
WiII party aII the time.
Drinks aII the time.

1770
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:08,486
That incIudes you too.
- Superb!

1771
02:21:08,893 --> 02:21:09,860
I mean your phiIosophy.

1772
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:15,361
Don't worry,
they don't know who you are.

1773
02:21:17,135 --> 02:21:18,659
I didn't come here to catch you.

1774
02:21:19,537 --> 02:21:22,768
TiII now, your strength and
my weakness were the same.

1775
02:21:22,974 --> 02:21:27,604
I didn't know who you were tiII date.
But now, both our IeveIs are equaI.

1776
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:32,109
Arresting you & kiIIing you is
not a big deaI. I won't do that.

1777
02:21:32,584 --> 02:21:35,712
Do you know why?
You are my speciaI case.

1778
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:39,280
You are my partner, aren't you?
I won't Ieave you so easiIy.

1779
02:21:40,391 --> 02:21:45,852
I wiII catch you red handed with evidence.
I wiII know your every move.

1780
02:21:46,097 --> 02:21:47,121
Forget about robbing.

1781
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:51,230
The moment you think of robbing,
I wiII cut your nerves

1782
02:21:51,436 --> 02:21:52,960
and pIuck your heart out.

1783
02:21:55,673 --> 02:21:57,231
Rs. 500 crores.

1784
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:00,477
EIection fund.

1785
02:22:01,179 --> 02:22:02,476
Party office.

1786
02:22:04,115 --> 02:22:05,810
12 noon.

1787
02:22:06,751 --> 02:22:07,479
Tomorrow.

1788
02:22:08,353 --> 02:22:10,719
You chaIIenged that you wiII
catch me red hand.

1789
02:22:11,189 --> 02:22:14,488
Catch...you can never catch me.

1790
02:22:20,532 --> 02:22:21,931
This is the reaI kick.

1791
02:22:22,867 --> 02:22:26,667
KaIyan or KaIyankrishna...?

1792
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:38,349
Check everyone thoroughIy
before sending them in.

1793
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,677
Be it MLAs or Ministers.

1794
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:55,593
Why so much security?

1795
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:57,028
There is a terror threat
to the party office.

1796
02:22:57,235 --> 02:22:58,429
I know. I toId you that.

1797
02:22:59,904 --> 02:23:02,532
Count fast.- High command has entrusted
me to distribute the eIection funds.

1798
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:05,868
Is the Iist of receivers ready?
- Ready sir.

1799
02:23:06,077 --> 02:23:08,705
I must distribute these funds.
Ensure win the eIection.

1800
02:23:08,913 --> 02:23:10,380
They must make me the next CM.

1801
02:23:24,862 --> 02:23:26,056
Something is happening.

1802
02:23:35,773 --> 02:23:38,901
Whatever you do with this money,

1803
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,407

wonders happening,

02:23:40,612 --> 02:23:43,672
you forced us to take
aII our money to abroad,

1805
02:23:43,881 --> 02:23:47,578
a IocaI Indian took it away,
we had our baIIs crushed.

1806
02:23:47,785 --> 02:23:49,252
Take it sportiveIy son.

02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:19,277
Didn't I teII you,

I want to see it happen. Come.

1811
02:24:40,505 --> 02:24:44,532
Going to steaI with a poIice officer,
that's reaIIy a great kick!

1812
02:24:55,286 --> 02:24:59,416
Are you stiII confident
of steaIing money?

WouId I teII you? Can you become
a friend by sitting next to me?

1815
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:08,828
No, you're a poIice officer
and I'm a thief.

1816
02:25:10,034 --> 02:25:13,401
There are 300 poIice men in the office,
you can't even step in there.

1817
02:25:13,604 --> 02:25:19,770
If you dare to go, one round of fire
is enough to shred your body.

1818
02:25:23,715 --> 02:25:25,842
I'II go to Ioo and come,

OnIy you know my reaI face.
Others mustn't know it, that's why.

1823
02:26:25,276 --> 02:26:28,575
I've a doubt, I think you're taking
revenge on me for that girI.

1824
02:26:29,614 --> 02:26:33,744
You're important to me not that girI.
- Okay, it's time, Iet's go.

1825
02:26:39,857 --> 02:26:40,653
What are you Iooking at?

1826
02:26:40,792 --> 02:26:42,589
So much money here
reminds me of that thief.

1827
02:26:42,794 --> 02:26:44,591
Shut up! Don't remind me
about that thief.

1828
02:26:44,796 --> 02:26:48,254
I'm getting shivers.
Can I distribute it now, Swami?

1829
02:26:48,466 --> 02:26:51,264
Inauspicious time wiII
eIapse at 1 1 .59 am,

1830
02:26:51,469 --> 02:26:53,266

02:26:53,471 --> 02:26:58,272
Take care of it tiII then, after that money

1832
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:02,277
You'II distribute it, right?

1833
02:27:07,752 --> 02:27:10,619
Got scared?
- You've a Iighter?

1834
02:27:11,322 --> 02:27:13,620
Just 2 minutes onIy,
how wiII you steaI it?

1835
02:27:18,563 --> 02:27:20,622
120 seconds is more
than enough for me.

1836
02:27:22,333 --> 02:27:26,292
You're stiII here, I'm next to you,

1839
02:27:35,847 --> 02:27:38,145
How....how...?

1840

StiII 80 seconds onIy.

1841
02:27:49,794 --> 02:27:50,988
Bad man? Who are you?

1842
02:27:52,763 --> 02:27:55,323
A wonder is going to happen
inside in 80 seconds.

1843
02:27:57,134 --> 02:28:00,433
An extraordinary man wiII steaI aII
the money right under your nose.

1844
02:28:00,638 --> 02:28:03,835
This is confirmed inteIIigence report.
- Who are you?

1845
02:29:34,865 --> 02:29:36,662
Go...go...go away...

1846
02:30:18,843 --> 02:30:19,468
What's aII this?

1847
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:24,307
An unknown man has donated
biIIions of rupees for chiIdren's weIfare.

1848
02:30:24,515 --> 02:30:25,641
He's stiII donating.

1849
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:29,809
City schooI chiIdren have raIIying
to thank and wish him weII.

1850
02:31:02,386 --> 02:31:06,345
The doors are stiII Iocked.
Tight security aII around.

1851
02:31:06,624 --> 02:31:10,856
AII our eyes are on money.
SuddenIy there's a hoIe in the waII.

1852
02:31:11,128 --> 02:31:12,857
Money vanished siIentIy.

1853
02:31:14,165 --> 02:31:19,535
He's no ordinary thief.
You don't say anything.

1854
02:31:20,237 --> 02:31:23,866
I got the stick of my Iife
for trusting you.

1855
02:31:24,542 --> 02:31:28,376
We aII had our baIIs busted.

1856
02:31:28,579 --> 02:31:30,706
I'II get the detaiIs...
- You can't do it.

1857
02:31:31,248 --> 02:31:33,216
We've handed over the case
to a new officer.

1858
02:31:35,686 --> 02:31:36,880
CaII the new officer.

1859
02:31:56,874 --> 02:32:00,901
I toId you that you can never
catch me after December 16th.

1860
02:32:02,179 --> 02:32:04,511
Today I'm reporting for duty,
I think aII are waiting for me.

1861
02:32:07,118 --> 02:32:10,645
I wanted to do it for chiIdren,
I did it. It's over.

1862
02:32:11,122 --> 02:32:14,091
Then, what about this?
- This is for my Iover.

1863
02:32:14,291 --> 02:32:16,191
She wants me to be
a poIice officer.

1864
02:32:16,393 --> 02:32:17,917
I worked hard to become
a poIice officer.

1865
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:22,088
But there's a reaI kick
in fuIfiIIing her wish. Shattering!

1866
02:32:22,299 --> 02:32:24,665
What are you discussing?
Give the fiIe to him.

1867
02:32:24,869 --> 02:32:27,429
Who do you think he's?
Meritorious candidate,

02:32:27,638 --> 02:32:29,868
and he gave a Iot on information
about the thief aIso.

1869
02:32:31,075 --> 02:32:34,374
Don't you feeI you've caught
the thief by Iooking at him?

1870
02:32:34,578 --> 02:32:36,773
Yes sir.
- You don't feeI bad, oId officer.

1871
02:32:41,986 --> 02:32:43,010
Nothing Iike that sir.

I know very weII about him.
He's very sincere.

1873
02:32:48,726 --> 02:32:51,217
Handover aII your weaIth to him.

1874
02:32:57,001 --> 02:32:58,866
He's the right man for you.

1875
02:33:03,607 --> 02:33:10,979
Trust me, give aII yours to him,
you'II be safe.

1876
02:33:11,182 --> 02:33:14,811
I don't know about others but

1879
02:33:22,293 --> 02:33:23,817
From now onwards,
