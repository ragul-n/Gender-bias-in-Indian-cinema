1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
.

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,240

But don't know how to tell her father....
if you please help to solve out...

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,039
Nirvik, though your would be father-in-law
is an O.C...he is a human being too...

6
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,920
There was love in his life too...

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Everyone around you are having an affair...

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone's love is special to him...

9
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,920
Everyone thinks that he struggled
a lot to get his love....

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,759
And so each of you are prince and princess...

11
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:57,080
I'll tell you a strange love story
of a princess of Kolkata....

12
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,600
One Princess who likes four Prince....

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,440
One day she called her four friends...

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:17,880
Among these four Prince, who will
get the Princess...Komolika....

15
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,400
This is high time guys...

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,320
Now I should decide who will be my life partner.....

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,360
And I'm serious about it...

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
And you all have to help me...

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,920
But how?
- Wait wait...what happened to you?

20
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,520
Tell Shibuda to unload the luggage from the taxi...

21
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
You came suddenly?

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
Have to tell everything standing here?

23
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
Shibuda...

24
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,880
Not suddenly, it was going on for a long time...

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,040
I didn't understand before.....

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,120
For the last one year, they use
to quarrel in front of me...

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,880
Even if I do selective work you object....

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,880
You are being disrespected in this work....

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Why don't you try to understand?

30
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,600
Non-bengali actors are being
brought at great expense....

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Just to show their face.....

32
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,600
And Dipjoy Mitra is responsible for rescuing them....

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Why would you ?
- What to do?

34
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,200
Director wants my voice instead of him....

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
You don't want...that's it...

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Just don't dub.... try to understand...

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,480
I've another problem...

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
I've taken the advance...

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,720
That's not a logic...just return it...

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,520
It's not possible...

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,480
She is right...return the advance....

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
How will I return?
all the money has been spent...

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Dubbing is also an art...isn't it...

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:34,640
People will go to watch movie by
seeing Indrajit's face in hoding....

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,320
But if there is my face then from
2nd week only noon show will run...

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Here, how many big stars are good actors?

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,400
You can't deny that I'm a good actor...

48
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,680
What? tell...

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,280
I've to do the bad movies because
I run the family...

50
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,680
But you will do selective work..
It's not fair....

51
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,360
My annimation dubbing, voice over and
other works are enough to run the family....

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Not enough...

53
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,160
You need more money...

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Hair cut of Rs. 2000, designer dress Rs.
7000 to wear in Award Ceemony....

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,680
I don't need those...
- Come quickly...I'm getting late...

56
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,640
Hair cut of Rs. 20 and dresses from
Gariahat sale is enough for me...

57
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Why are you creating so much pressure?
- Ok..happy?

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,920
Now relax...

59
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,400
Have your breakfast...

60
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
I'm a small actor and she is a big star...

61
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Our views differ a lot....

62
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Can't stay together like this....

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:13,800
A wrong selection makes us
suffer for whole life...

64
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Becomes very difficult...

65
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Today I told him about Prakash....

66
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Who is Prakash?

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Prakash Sharma....
-Ad film maker...

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,720
I didn't want to say, Dip forced me....

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,920
He was asking me about my
relationship with Prakash....

70
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,840
You know I never lie....

71
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,640
Then why are you staying with me?

72
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,080
It may rain, carry the umbrella with you...

73
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll not make mistake like my sister....

74
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,040
I'll select the perfect man....

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,800
I just need a friend...

76
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
All four of you are my friends...

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,600
And I love all of you...

78
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,960
I have two points...

79
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,560
No one will lie and no one will fight...

80
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,600
No friendship last just for these girlfriends....

81
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,920
She is a common factor among four of us...

82
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:42,960
Else, I'm a tailor...he is a D.J...
you are a director

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,360
You deal with computers....
what will we do together...

84
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,840
Four songs and one D.J...

85
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Let her decide which one to play....

86
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,360
No fight among four of us....

87
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,040
All four of us love her and
want her to be happy...

88
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,240
He is right...

89
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,080
She will select one among four of us....

90
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,440
And rest of three will...
- Serve food

91
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,440
Rest will serve food in her marriage....

92
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,320
Please take some more....

93
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,560
So she will take the final decision....

94
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,960
Let her decide, whom she
want as life partner.....

95
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,080
If you agree then raise your hand....

96
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,799
Is this a classroom...that
we have to raise our hand....

97
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,440
You are using slang? he got angry....

98
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Ok if you agree then raise your legs...

99
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,880
Now I'm playing a song for your girlfriend....

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,320
Listen to this and think....

101
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Then I'll tell how O.C
will know your love story....

102
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:24,240
So stay with us and keep listening to
Radio Mirchi, 98.3 F.M. it's hot...

Tell Rina to set the remaining rollers....

105
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,920
Didi, Ineed to talk to you...

106
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,800
Tell
- It's personal...

107
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,320
Shibuda, tell Rina to set the
rollers afterwards...

108
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Nothing so important...
I hope you don't mind....

109
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Tell clearly...
- Do you love Prakash Sharma?

110
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
Why?
- do you?

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,680
I think so ....

You also love Dip da....

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
Once you loved him....

115
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,240
Obviously, otherwise why did I marry him?

116
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Then one person can love two persons...
- Yes can...

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Three persons?
- Yes can...

118

I love four of them....It's true...

120
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,520
If you can love two men,
why can't I love four...

121
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,160
You are mad.....

122

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
What?

146
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,640

148
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,720
Once your Dip da told me
to take to a psychiatrist....

149
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,400
A strange name...Anu Gahtak...

150
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,640
Prakash told me not to go, so I didn't...

151
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,280
As media can make a rumor
that Komolini became mad...

152
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,680
Don't tell him that I told you....

153
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,760
Ask him that he knows
any psychiatrist or not....

154
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,480
Really I'll become mad....

155
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,880
They asked me to select one among them....
rest will remain as good friends...

156
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,480
Just go and meet him once...

157
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,160
Maybe it will help...

158
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Ajay da, stop the car to the side....

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,640
We have to make a bridge..

160
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,320
Can you imagine, how long it
will take to make a bridge....

161
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,320
I'll go to Srilanka and rescue Sita maa...

162
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,720
Dipjoy da, please switch off your phone...

163
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Tell, what's up?

164
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,400
The phone was silent as I was dubbing...

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
Everthing is ok?

166
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
Has she cool down?
- I don't know...

167
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,080
Dip da, I need to meet you...
- What do you want?

168
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,160
After all you are my only sister-in-law...
Tell what do you want?

169
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,200
Do you know any good Psychiatrist?

170
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
I told your sister before....

171
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,840
But if someone don't wants to take help
what will I do....

172
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,760
She is a star, so it will be a news....
- I need it...

173
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,200
Why? what happened?
- I'm not well...

174

Dip da, I need to meet you...

175
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Understand....

176
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,520
I've no connection with Anu Ghatak
for few months....but....

177
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
I know his place and he is outstanding...

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,200
His full name is Anupam Ghatak...

179
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
Magician...

180
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,320
Later I'll sms you his number...

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,120
Call him and tell that you are my sister...

182
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,400
But he is very irritable...

183
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,120
Talk carefuly...

184
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,920
Don't worry, tell everything....

185
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,600
I also told your sister to go
but she didn't...

186
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,040
If she then we shouldn't
have seen this day....

187
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,400
Listen Sumona,don't be stubborn...

188
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,920
One should remain cool,
if the other becomes angry...

189
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,520
At least for the time being...

190
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,320
Myself your Suronjona di is telling you,
don't apologise to him....

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,880
Tomorrow you go to his office and
wish him hapy birthday in front of all...

192
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,520
With a little gift...

193
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,240
And then without any further
conversation, just come out...

194
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,280
Then see how he will come behind you...

195
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,200
Till then cool down and
listen to this song...

196
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,760
Send a coffee...

197
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Your new sim...
- Thank you...

198
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
Listen, can you do acting?

199
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Why?

200
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Just answer me...

201
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
Last I acted in school...
- It will do..send the coffee...

202
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,960
What's the matter?
- Tell you later...

203
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,520
Suddenly, our madness
will find a meaning...

204
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,880
You come a little way and a little me...

205
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,119
Nice song....

206
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,960
You come and laugh....

207
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,560
Stop the song...

208
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,920
Love as much as you wish ....

209
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,560
Let the past be gray and
the future be colourful...

210
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:55,640
Let us close our eyes and search....

211
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Let's try to see the happiness...

212
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,320
You come a little way and a little me...

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,120

221
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,120

222
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,640

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600

21/18 Baburam Dutta Lane, Kolkata 700018....

227
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,480
If you confuse the road after coming
then make a call...good night...

228
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
You met him or talked over phone...

229
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
Met him...

230
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
Did he say anything?

231
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Has she cool down?

232
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,880
Hello, I'm Dimpy...talked with you
yesterday night...

233
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,240
Good morning, please do come in...

234
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Please sit...

235
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,640
Excuse me, you are from?
From France...

236
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,840
How is he?
- Fantastic...

237
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,200
He is God...
- Ooo, thanks..

238
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
Bye...
- Bye...

239
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,040
Many people come to us
from home and abroad...

240
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Please come...

241
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,640
Sit down..

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,120
Sit down..
- Good morning...

243
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:36,920
Welcome young lady to the
source of happiness...

244
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Do you like music?
- Yes....

245
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,040
Now close your eyes...

246
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,240
Relax....normalize breathing...

247
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,960
Nothing but music should enter the ears...

248
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Tell 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5....

249
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,760
Orange, guava, pomegranate, apple...

250
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:31,720
A B C D E...

251
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,840
Where is Komolika?
- called her so many times...

252
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,840
What's the matter?
- Called her sister?

253
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,480
What did she say?
- Its ringing...

254
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,760
May be didi is in shooting
so phone is silent...

255
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,080
But why Komolika is not
receiving the call...

256
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Where is she?

257
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,440
Pomegranate, orange, apple, guava...
you like all the four fruits...

258
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,760
But you can't eat the four fruits...

259
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,240
Then what's the way?

260
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,760
Moreover love and marriage
doesn't possible on guess...

261
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,040
And if you can't guess then
what's the way?

262
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,320
Science...pick one card...

263
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Pick one...

264
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,920
Whta's behind?

265
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Behind the card...

266
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,200
Apple...

267
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Then the selection is done...

268
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,800
Eat the apple and forget the others...

269
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,640
Its not so easy...isn't it?

270
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Tell the name of a man who had many
wives lived in same house?

271
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,600
Who?
- Dasarath, father of Ram...

272
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:09,080
Tell the name of a woman who had 5
husbands lived in same house?

273
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,520
I know this...Draupadi....

274
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,800
Draupadi managed 5 husbands
but actually loved Arjun...

275
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,560
And you can't select one....

276
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,120
You have only foer...cool...cool...

277
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Let it be...

278
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Now tell their names...

279
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:44,640
Rik, Tito, DJ and Laden...

280
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,320
Oh God, this was the most wanted...

281
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Is this his birth name?
- No we use to call him...

282
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,320
Am I mad?
- NO...NO..NO...

283
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,760
Actually your heart is full of love...

284
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,080
Full of trust, kindness, friendship...

285
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:21,760
So after giving these to 1 or 2 person,
if it remain,then what will you do....

286
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,600
But on the other side is our society ....

287
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,880
Today, this society wouldn't accept
Dasarath or Draupadi....

288
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,640
Will just put behind the bar, in that
case what would you do?

289
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,920
In that case you have to choose the best one...

290
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,840
Isn't it?
- Yes, but how?

291
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,680
By the game of matching colours....

292
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,280
10 rounds and each round have 10 points...

293
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,120
Then total how many points in 10 round?
- 100 points...

294
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,320
Very good....

295
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:26,800
The boy who will score highest points
out of 100, will win princess Komolika....

296
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,880
What are these 10 rounds?

297
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:39,320
The 10 qualities without which, a man wouldn't
be consider as an ideal husband....

298
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:48,400
The 10 most important qualities of a husband....

299
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,000
Suppose you are suddenly in great danger....

300
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,840
And seeing this your husband was nonplussed....

301
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,040
Then the danger will be doubled....

302
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,880
Fearful husband...its terrible...

303
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:16,320
Ideal husband is he who will rescue
you from danger by courage or intellect...

304
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:25,360
So the first round is 'Coward- Hallow...'

305
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:33,360
Suppose you are suddenly in a danger
where physical strength is useless....

306
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,920
Only presence of mind is needed....

307
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,200
If husband lacks presence of mind
then you will suffer a lot....

308
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,320
And if he has then checkmate.....

309
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Round no.2 is 'Checkmate...'

310
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:58,080
Your husband will one day be the
father of your child....

311
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,680
What a big job.....

312
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,000
You alone will handle that newborn
for 24 hours...impossible....

313
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,680
If the husband cannot handle the child
everything will be ruined...

314
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,720
Because to handle a child is not so easy...

315
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,520
So round no.3 is 'Father...'

316
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,360
One day that child will grown up
and will go to school....

317
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,120
Surely you want your child to go to a
good English Medium School....

318
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,760
But if your husband can't speak fluent
English then what will happen....

319
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,960
Then no school will take your baby....

320
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,560
Your child's future will be in jeopardy....

321
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,840
Do you want that?
- No...

322
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,480
If your husband is not good in spoken
English then your child will suffer....

323
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,000
So the next round is 'Sir'....

324
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,560
And the remaining 6 rounds...

325
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,800
Such a strange man...so much cofidence and knowledge....

326
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,680
Seeing such a haunted house, I wondered
where Dip da had sent me....

327
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,200
You informed him that you went there...
- No, I'll call him...

328
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,040
Don't forget...just decorum...

329
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,600
How much fees he took?
- Didn't take....

330
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,520
He said he will take it only if
everything is sucessful....

331
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,640
Your friends know?
- It's strictly forbidden to tell them....

332
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,160
They will become concious if they know,
then they will do extra good work..

333
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,200
To let them know is just out of the question....

334
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,600
If you don't let them know, how will
you play the rounds with them....

335
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,360
These moments can come any time in our
life, then the game will begin...

336
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,560
If all fouer of them are present with
me then well and good...

337
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,040
Seeing their performance I can give them marks...

338
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,360
Suppose one is present with me, then by
his performance I've to mark him...

339
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,360
I have to think that how others would
react if they faced the same situation...

340
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,720
Unique method...

341
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,880
After marking I've to write it
on the colour matching chart...

342
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,120
It's very exciting...

343
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,560
Don't let them know about this....

344
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,960
What are you thinking?

345
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,000
Nothing...

346
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
All the best...

347
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,360
Komolika, don't you think that
we are shifting from our focus....

348
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
Why?

349
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,040
You were supposed to inform
who among us is lucky....

350
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,320
Everyone is waiting...

351
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,600
Did you take any decision?

352
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,640
Such a big decision will take some time, Tito....

353
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,040
Let play coluor mathching game for few more days....

354
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
What?

355
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Let me think for few more days....

356
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,160
What are you doing? drive carefuly....

357
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,680
Oh God, its bleeding...

358
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,400
Take the hanky...

359
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,800
Why did you hit the car?
- You came on the wrong way...

360
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,840
Can't you see such a big car...

361
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:13,280
Come out of the taxi....
- Leave me, don't beat me...

362
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
Do something....

363
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,920
Its their fault, why would they beat our driver?

364
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,000
Go stop them...

365
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,440
Please move...

366
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,800
He has no fault...

367
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,600
Why are you beating?

368
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,960
Please move...

369
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,720
Give the mobile, we have to call the police...

370
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,960
You came on the wrong way...
- Can't you see such a big car...

371
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
What are you doing?

372
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
Do something....

373
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,720
Please move...let me go...

374
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,080
Don't beat like this....
- You go from here...

375
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,680
Try to understand, you came on the
wrong side and you are beating....

376
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,400
I'll beat you...go from here...

377
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,159
One minute....move..move....

378
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,920
Can't stop them like this....have to report
the police on the signal ahead...

379
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,040
What are you thinking? let's go...

380
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,600
Come out of the taxi....
- Leave me, don't beat me...

381
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,960
Do something....

382
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:40,600
Leave me you swine...

383
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,920
Started fighting here...

384
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,639
I'll beat you now...

385
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,640
Stop....get up...

386
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
What happened?

387
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,320
He entered in the wrong side now
he is beating our taxi driver...

388
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,440
What's your name?
- Khokon Pramanik...

389
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,360
And you?
- He is my friend...

390
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,760
But what is his name?
- Osama bin laden...

391
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,640
Come out of the taxi....
- Leave me, don't beat me...

392
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880
Why he is beating the driver?

393
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,200
Stop, your car is faced in which direction?
- Why you need to know? is he blind?

394
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,440
Go from here....

395
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,200
Will you stop?
- No...

396
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,960
Last time asking, will you stop?
- No, I won't...

397
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Stop, don't beat...

398
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,160
If you hit once more, I'll break
the glass of your car...

399
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Stop it...

400
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,800
Laden, we are in a problem early morning....

401
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,880
Had a minor accident....

402
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,440
I got little injury but Komolik is
bleeding from nose....

403
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,080
we are going to nursing home.......

404
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,800
We are going to Care and Cure at Bhowanipur....

405
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,880
How is Komolika?
- She is admitted in 102...

406
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,080
Admitted? why?

407
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,200
Excuse me, see who has come to meet you....

408
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,200
How are you?
- Fine, they had admitted me forcefully...

409
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,280
What are you doing?

410
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,000
What happened?
- Nothing serious....

411
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,640
First they were admitting in ICCU, but
I got angry so they admitted here....

412
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,200
Believe me, I'm fine...

413
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
I'll go home....

414
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,440
You are telling that youare fine
but got injured on head

415
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,120
Bleeding from nose, need to do
brain scan to check for injury....

416
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
There may be internal hemorrhage.....

417
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
Nothing like that....

418
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Just I got a hurt on my nose....

419
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,560
You are force fully admitting me....

420
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,840
Later she can come from home
to do the brain scan...

421
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,040
No...no...don't take any risk....

422
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,440
She will be under 24 hour observation.....
- I'll go home...

423
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Nothing serious has happened...
but no need to take any risk....

424
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,080
Stay here for 2 days...

425
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,320
Brain is our hard disk, if it crush
then nothing will be left to do....

426
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,560
Why don't you understand....I'm fine...

427
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,840
They will admit for 4 days, will do some
tests and will make a huge bill...

428
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,080
This is their business....
- Speak softly....

429
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,120
You don't worry about money...
I'm only concerned about you....

430
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,920
They will do business either....

431
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,360
but a scan will show that your
system has no problem....

432
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,000
He is a doctor and he knows
what he is telling...

433
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,360
As its bleeding from nose there
is a chance of internal injury....

434
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,600
Excuse me, see who has come to meet you....

435
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,400
Cabin are very nice....

436
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Can I get your card...
- Ohh sure...

437
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,880
Thank you, when it comes to work...
- Its better not to....

438
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,520
No no not for that....

439
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,240
How are you?
- Fine, they had admitted me forcefully...

440
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,800
What are you doing?

441
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Nothing serious....

442
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,040
First they were admitting in ICCU, but
I got angry so they admitted here....

443
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,840
Believe me, I'm fine...I'll go home....

444
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,840
They are telling to stay in observation
for 2 days is better and safe....

445
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,640
Don't worry...excuse me....

446
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,800
Can I get permission to shoot here...

447
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
That's why you took the card....
- Yes....

448
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,200
Actually there is a small scene
in my movie 'Diploma'...

449
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,480
Yes, tell when you will shoot....

450
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,760
I used to act in group theater....

451
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,800
How are you?
- Fine, they had admitted me forcefully...

452
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,880
What are you doing?

453
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,840
Nothing serious....

454
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,760
First they were admitting in ICCU, but
I got angry so they admitted here....

455
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,160
Believe me, I'm fine...I'll go home....

456
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,520
You will....
- We can't discharge her now....

457
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,720
She needs to have a brain scan, MRI....

458
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Nothing is needed...

459
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,360
Same thing happened with my mom...

460
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,720
Nursing home did business by forcefully
admitting her day after day....

461
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,920
Mother's body was in morgue for 2 days
until the bill of 3.5 lac was paid....

462
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,600
Listen I'll sign the bond and take her....

463
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,240
We can't discharge her now...

464
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,040
You call her gurdian....

465
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,920
Go and call...

466
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,640
I'm her gurdian...

467
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,080
The bribe that you get from pharma
companies are not enough for you....

468
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,840
Open the needle of hand....

469
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,320
Where are you going? open the needle...

470
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I'll file a case against them...
this is bloody unfair...

471
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,840
What are they think of themselves....
- Where is he?

472
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,200
Take him out...

473
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,920
What happened? leave me...

474
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,600
Leave him...I'll complain against you...

475
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,440
People used to think you as God,
but now they are afraid of you...

476
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,560
Komolika, run away...

477
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,760
You go and bring the stetho quickly...

478
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,160
What are you doing?
- Don't talk, just do as I'm telling...

479
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,520
Why you came with the police?
- They gave lift in their van....

480
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,360
Didn't you get any taxi....

481
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,360
Have you written your name at any place?

482
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,680
I didn't, but don't know about Tito...
- Tito didn't, that means no records...

483
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
Rinku, quickly open the needle...

484
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,600
Be careful...

485
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,520
Thank yoou, give the stetho...hurry up...

486
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,760
I'm leaving, you come later...

487
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,840
Say hi to uncle and thank you...

488
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,520
If anyone ask about her then
say that she ran away....

489
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,880
Thank you...

490
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Wear this...

491
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,280
What are you thinking?
wear it and let's go....

492
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,240
Everyone is waiting in the parking lot outside...
be normal....

493
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,680
Take this file...hi...

494
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,120
Everyone knows me here...I give dress supply...

495
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,120
I'm feeling nervous...
- Nothing to get nervous...

496
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
That patient on wheel chair is our patient.....

497
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,640
If anyone catch us...
- None will doubt...let's go...

498
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,000
You are too much...

499
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Nobody will doubt as we are with patient...

500
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,520
Stop stop until we reach the parking lot...

501
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,480
Has he come?
- Yes..yes..parking...

502
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,880
Ohh great...

503
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,120
Thank you doctor...

504
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,440
Hurry up...come..come...

505
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,400
Excuse me, wait...where is he?

506
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,920
Who?
- My husband...

507
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,920
Laden, what's the matter?
- No husband...tata...

508
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,960
Hurry up...come..come...

509
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,440
What's your name?
- Lisa and this is my baby...

510
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,960
Where is your husband?
- I don't know...

511
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,360
He has admitted me to this hospital but
then he never came back...

512
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Not for a single day....

513
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know what to do...

514
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,360
I don't know where to go...
how to pay the hospital bills...

515
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,360
You cannot leave me like this....
you cannot leave me and my baby...

516
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,240
What to do?
- Laden, pick her up in the car...

517
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,360
There is no space for so many people...

518
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,880
Thisis a big car...enough space is there...

519
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,640
Don't worry, come with us...
- Thank you...

520
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,240
I was staying in Goa, Nil was working
there as a hotel manager....

521
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
Thats where we met...

522
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,200
And then slowly we became friends...
and he promised to marry me...

523
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
And then...

524
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,840
Then there was a problem at the hotel
and decided to come back to Kolkata...

525
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,000
I was expecting then, so 8 months ago
we came back to Kolkata...

526
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,040
So all of you came to Kolkata...
- Yes..

527
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,360
Where you stay here in Kolkata?
- Sealdah, a very small flat...

528
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,280
Who else is there with you?
- Just me....

529
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,560
What about Nil?

530
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,840
He is married...
- Ohh God...

531
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,560
Is he staying with youu?
- Sometime he comes and stays...

532
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,160
So in essence what you trying to say is
that you don't get to meet his wife....

533
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,520
No...

534
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,200
Do you have his residential address?

535
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:08,600
We surely need a proof of identification...
photographs, voter Id or something like ...

536
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,080
I've a photo of Nil...
- I think that might be great...

537
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,160
Let me check...

538
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,760
Show me...

539
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,880
He seems like a 'khochhor'..sorry didi..

540
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,840
Its ok....

541
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,800
Sorry, what is 'khochhor'?

542
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,720
Nothing madam, very very bad people...

543
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,240
Never trust this type of loose
character man...

544
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,720
What you doing in Goa?

545
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
I was a bar dancer...

546
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,560
I danced in Marine Hotel...

547
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,840
Even I'm in the hotel business....I'm a DJ...

548
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,720
So I know people who know people....
we are going to find him by tomorrow...

549
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,440
Don't worry..it's a small world...

550
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,680
This is not the way the system
is going to work...

551
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
We don't know what the problem will be...
she is a foreigner....

552
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,680
We have no idea what we are involved in...

553
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,080
What we are involving in, Prakash?

554
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,560
You don't understand....

555
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,320
She will just stay here for few days,
thats it....

556
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,840
She disappeared from nursing home
without paying the bills....

557
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,200
This is not own...
- I know it's not own...

558
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,960
You are not thinking about the baby....

559
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,440
Such a mother and child can't be
left like this....

560
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,280
Lisa doesn't know anyone in this city...

561
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,880
You know how the system works?
- How?

562
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,120
Nursing home inform the police and police searches....

563
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,480
That's how the system works....

564
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,160
But police will search in Sealdah...

565
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
And if necessary I'll talk to the commissioner.......

566
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,440
Komol please...

567
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:18,360
Laden, call Lisa...

568
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,960
Lisa, call her...

569
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,600
Are you feeling shy, go...

570
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,440
Didi, tomorrow if you come with us
to search the man at Sealdah....

571
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,720
If you come with us then it
would be easy to find the flat....

572
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,880
None will pay attention to us....
-Yes, moreover people may doubt us...

573
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,760
Ok, I'll come...

574
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,480
Let me know the timeI'll plan accordingly...

575
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,120
Hold on, what do you mean, you will go...

576
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,800
You will search a man in such a crowded place...

577
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,320
It's not safe, are you crazy?

578
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,640
Why? what's the problem?

579
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
Don't worry, we will be there...

580
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,720
You also come with us...
- That's a good idea...

581
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,480
Excuse me...me?

582
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,000
You told it's unsafe...
won't you go with us?

583
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,960
Do I have a choice?

584
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,600
Lisa, Komolika's elder sister is calling you...

585
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,440
Go...don't worry...give...
- Thank you...

586
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,520
In the balcony...

587
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,240
Soooo sweet....

588
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,440
What are you staring?
- Looking nice...

589
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,880
Lisa, Sealdah is not very far from here....

590
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,360
We need to go there in order to find him....

591
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,120
So we need you to come along us...
we are planning to go tomorrow....

592
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,760
We may not find him tomorrow,
but we have to keep trying...

593
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,000
So we make a start tomorrow,
let see where it takes us...

594
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,400
Don't look so tensed...smile....

595
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,680
And don't worry, just go and relax...

596
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,200
She needs to go with us...

597
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
All set...

598
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,560
Tomorrow Lisa will go with us, let see....

599
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,400
This is the plan?
- Yes, good plan...

600
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,720
In this heat roaming with a baby in
Sealdah....thats the plan...

601
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,800
Why to roam with the baby....

602
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Komolika is injured, she will stay
at home with the baby..

603
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,560
Just for one hour...what's the problem...

604
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,080
Yes, one of us will stay with her....

605
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,360
There you are...fair enough...

606
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,120
It's not fair...
- Off course it is...

607
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,840
You go, I'll stay here...no problem...

608
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,360
How can you decide that?

609
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,720
Any one of the four of us could stay....

610
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Choose a finger...

611
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
D.J...

612
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Serving case..

613
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,040
This is the place...

614
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,120
Shall I get off?
- Don't rush...

615
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,480
Let them go first then you go...

616
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,400
This one...wait...

617
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,520
Stop fussing over here, please...

618
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,800
Not needed...

619
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,080
Please hold the baby, I'm having a headache...

620
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,760
Sure...give....

621
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,520
Wait, let me wash my hands...

622
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,840
'Father...'

623
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,680
If the husband cannot handle the child
everything will be ruined...

624
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,160
Please hold the baby, I'm having a headache...

625
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,800
...give....

626
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,640
Don't cry...sleep here...

627
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,040
Now shooting will start...silence...

628
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,040
Start sound....camera...action....

629
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,400
Don't cry....shooting is going on...

630
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,320
Cut...You can't do anything...

631
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,840
Have you seen this man before?

632
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,080
Yes he use to come here....
but not coming for many days...

633
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,800
Can't find like this...

634
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,480
Lisa...thank you...

635
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,760
Where is the flat?

636
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,560
This one, on the first floor...

637
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,880
Rik, please hold the baby, I'm having a headache...

638
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,960
I can't do this at all...

639
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,920
Hold properly...
- Yes....

640
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,080
Lets come with me...

641
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,840
What did you do?

642
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,600
Let me check...

643
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,640
Did toilet on my shirt...

644
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,960
What did you do?

645
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,880
Now I've to stay like this....

646
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,960
From now everything is from distance....

647
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,440
No more laptop, only desktop...

648
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,240
You are my sun, you are my moon...

649
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,880
Please stop crying...

650
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,720
Ok another song by Lata ji...

651
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:12,000
Enough of hide and seek..come on...

652
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,200
I see trees are green...

653
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:40,320
Red roses too, I see them grew...

654
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:49,200
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world...

655
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,880
I see sky of blue...

656
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
And clouds of white..

657
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,600
Brightest day, darkest night..

658
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,040
And I think to myself..

659
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,120
What a wonderful world...

660
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,520
You know what I feel, inform the police...

661
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,200
It's not our job, it's the job of the police...

662
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,480
Yes I guess Lisa we have to inform the police now....

663
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,400
No, no, no police...

664
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,160
We should give the still photo to the police...

665
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,880
If we give the photograph then
it will be easier to find him...

666
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,160
NOo, no, don't call police...

667
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,960
Relax Lisa, they will help us...

668
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,400
don't call police...

669
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,280
No, no, don't

670
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,160
We have been roaming around all day but

671
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,200
Relax don't worry...

672
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,960
Why not Lisa, we have been roaming
around for such a long time...

673
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,680
I lied to you....

674
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,720
What do you mean, you lied?
- I was selling drugs in Goa....

675
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,080
And now I'm here hiding...

676
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,000
You were selling drugs in Goa?

677
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,680
You should have told this to me...

678
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,280
I told you not to get involved...

679
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,160
It's bad Lisa...

680
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,680
I told you not to get with this, not fair...

681
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,200
This is not right...
- This is very bad...

682
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:32,240
Rik 21, Tito 17, Dj 26, Laden...
he was doing well

683
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,760
Made a mess in spoken english...
total only 21...

684
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:49,360
But you did very good...

685
00:55:50,320 --> 00:56:00,240
Why you come alone everyday...
don't you have anyone at home...

686
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,200
Actually my sister lives with me...

687
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,120
Sister is unmarried?
- No she is married....

688
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,880
Ooo then also she stays here...

689
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:17,280
Sister is staying with me due to
adjustment problem with brother-in-law...

690
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,120
Sit down...

691
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Sorry...

692
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,520
Ask your sister to come here ....

693
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,720
Sister is a big actress so don't
want to come for rumour...

694
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,520
If she comes here, everyone will recognise her...

695
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,360
Yes, very big star...

696
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:59,120
Tell her that at least once a gurdian
should come with you...

697
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Ok...

698
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,360
Next round...

699
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,920
When is your birthday?
- Today...

700
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,800
What happened?
- Nothing...

701
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:29,040
Lets start the next round with 'worth'

702
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,840
Mark them properly on the basis of gifts...

703
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,240
Not good but should give costly gifts...

704
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,440
Ruthlessly judge how much
money they have...

705
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Ok...

706
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,960
Will have party?

707
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,560
No, but four of them will come...

708
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,480
They drink...

709
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,760
Ocassionally, today they will drink...
- Very good...

710
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,520
Good...I forbid so much....

711
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,840
Today don't forbid....

712
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,000
Let them drink as much as they can....

713
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,160
Because our next round will start as
the night gets darker, 'Inhuman'...

714
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,160
'inhuman...'

715
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,800
Uttam kumar...Good or bad that
will be proved to night...

716
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,080
Watch carefully, who remain
concious after having alcohol...

717
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,920
Because wild animal is better
than boozer husband...

718
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,480
Can you come today on
my birthday party....

719
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,560
I wish to but not possible....

720
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,680
For once...please...

721
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,160
Definately I'll try but can't promise...

722
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:07,640
Anyway...God bless you...

723
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,800
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MADAM, there you go..

724
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,280

725
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,960
Joint gift from your sister and me...

726
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,240

727
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,160

730
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,840
It will match with this dress...

731
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,240
I think she will look gorgeous...

732
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,120
Remove your hair...
- One minute....

733
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,280
You have so much curls...
- Its my birthday...

734
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,920
To wear jewellery is always a problem...

735
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,800
Isn't she gorgeous...take a look...

736
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,240
She is gorgeous or the set?

737
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,600
She is gorgeous...

738
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,880
Just take a look, fantastic...

739
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,720

01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,680
Good 10 out of 10...

742
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:14,440

743
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,440
Let her be...

744
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
What is marking?

745
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,360
She is going to watch a movie now?

746
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:29,280
No no not movie, it's a game.....

747
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,080
Have many rounds....

748
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,880

749
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,480
Can't make you understand.....

750
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,320

01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,440
Ammu made it...

768
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,160
She is old so takes long time to make....

769
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,600
Made this dress all night yesterday...

770
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,520

Thank you so much...

775
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,920
Quality of cloth is not so good...
wear it at home...

776
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,720
Ruthlessly judge how much
money they have...

777
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,880
Rina is sitting quietly on a chair
in her study...

778
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,680
Started checking her copies one by one...

779
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,400
End of the movie....

780
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,640
She has returned to her normal life....

781
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,520
Her maturity level doesn't let her to cry...

782
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,880
You are the perfect one for this role...

783
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,200
I'm not talking over ram....

784
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,320
You will be excellent, just manage 25 dates...

785
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,760
Producer is new....

786
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,560
Lady producer and her husband has
plenty of black money...

787
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,640
Has a factory at Joka....

788

789
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,880
Happy birthday to you....

790
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,880
You don't know that how much
you are important in my life....

791
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,520
You are fumbling...have your dinner...

792
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:48,720
Why so much fuss as I drank a little....

793
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,640
If can't control then why you drink
so much....

794
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,240
He is totally out...

795
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Having trouble?

796
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,840
Ok relax...

797
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,800
Vomit the whole thing...

798
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,080
Now relax...
- Drink only beer....

799
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Understand....

800
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,680
Sorry...

801
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,320
Just indigestion...

802
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,400
You shouldn't have swold drugs...
Its very bad....

803
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,160
I know, I really want to forget
the past...

804
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,400
Everyone makes mistakes....

805
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,800
Forget, past is past....

806
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
You have a baby so...
- Come....

807
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,880

- No, I won't....

810
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,960
Serve me dinner, I'm hungry...

811
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,800

01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,080
Sorry, excuse me...

815
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400

Mr. Anu Ghatak...come quickly..

821
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,200
Why didn't you call him up?
- He is aged, can't come.....

822
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,200
I never thought he would come....
so sweet of him...

823
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,680
He wanted to meet with you, so he can....

824
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,360
You don't behave like a star...

825
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,680
He was supposed to come but suddenly
became sick, so sent me...

826
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,920
Will you celebrate the birthday on road?

827
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,280

01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
What is this?

831
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,480
He cooked for you....

832
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,840
Today you are busy with guests...

833
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,160
Tomorrow after eatig this,
give him a call....

834
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,720
You will not enter the house?

835
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,640
No, may be next year...

836
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,840
The old man gave this letter for you....

837
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,640
Happy birthday...
-Thank you ...

838
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:32,080
Happy birthday dear, accept this

And remember that the fitter he is,
the more worthy husband he is....

840
01:08:40,639 --> 01:08:45,360
So after 'inhuman', our next round is...

841
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,840
'Illness'...

842
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,440
Where are you all?
four of you are together...

843
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,639
Listen cross the road and come straight....

844
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,280
There is an under-construction building...

845
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,719
10th storied, come on its roof....

846
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,639
I'm in great danger, hurry up...

847
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,360
Who's there?

848
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,639

849
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,160

Komolika....Komolika....

852
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,040
Go quickly and catch him...

853
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:08,480
Who are you all?

854
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:12,680
What are you doing here?
Shall I call the police?

855
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:19,600
What are you staring?

856
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:27,960
Where is Komolika?
- Can' t see her...

857
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,960
Is she is in any danger?

858
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:37,880
I'm out of breathe....
- Smoke more, see your condition...

859
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:52,240
Take him upstair, let see what is there...

860
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:54,960
Where is laden?

861
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,680
He was coming...

862
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Is this a joke?

863
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
What is your danger?

864
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,360
Among those I'll select my life partner,
2 out of 3 are sick for smoking.....

865
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,960
And Laden gave walkover...

866
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,960
Did they caught him?

867
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,680
Leave me...
- Release him...

868
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,320
We all are friends...

869
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,960
Educated and polite...

That day you cooked very well....

936
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,719
Didi ate most of it...

937
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,160

Actually I was supposed to go....

940
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,400
But suddenly felt a pain in my chest....

941
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,160
So without taking risk,
asked Dipjoy to go....

942
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,320
Told him to give his Guru Dakshina....

943

944
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,920
So asked him to go on my behalf....

945
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,160

948
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,800
Do you know Dipjoy?

949
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,719
He is her husband....

950
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,960
Dipjoy is my brother-in-law....

951
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,480
Being old so use to forget things....

952
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,760
Dipjoy told that you had a quarrel....s
so you are in your father's house...

953

Yes....
-Well done...

954
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,240

955
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,440
Now let's get back to our business....

956
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,240

Love, family, sex and job....

965
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:03,639
Adventure is the key to remain
fresh in everything....

966
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,960
Who has no adventure in life in similar
to a dead person....

967
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,880
You are correct.....

968
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:18,520
What's the name of this round?
- 'Expedition'...

969
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,600
'Expedition' the hunger for adventure.......

970
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,960
What is the adventure in your disguise
for coming here to meet me....

971
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:35,360
What is the adventure in the game that
Komolika is playing to find her partner....

972
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:40,240
Excuse me....

973
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,960
The happiness to know the unknown....

974
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,400
And what is the next round?

975
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,280
Day by day families are getting nuclear....

976
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,880
We two and our two....

977
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,480
But the people around us make a
large family....

978
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:09,160
We should enjoy together....

979
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,520
Too much enjoyment is not good....

980
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,920
There is the magic of a wife....

981
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,440
To balance family and enjoyment....

982
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,920
So our next round is 'own people...'

983
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,559
And what is the last round?

984
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:41,840
Life partner is useless if he is not beside you in old age...

985
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,440
In young age you will get many fans....

986
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:53,960
But its important to know their
view on old age....

987
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,160
Yes, you are correct....

988
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,920
What's the name of this round?

989
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,000
'Stick...'

990
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,320
The recourse of old age...

991
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,800
Why you named all your rounds
after a movie....

992
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,920
Shakesphere told that this life is a stage ...

993
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,080
and we all are actors, trying to act our role properly

994
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:35,080
Sometimes that life is hit and
sometime flop....

995
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
It's ok never mind....

996
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:40,559
But the show must go on....

997
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,200
Excuse me, where are we going?

998
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,040
You are just trying to help you, Lisa....

999
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,360
That's all, stop asking so many questions.....

1000
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,000
I'll be mad by answering her....

1001
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,520
Prakash, how many kilometers left?

1002
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:09,040
Around 20....

1003
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,760
Don't get angry....

1004
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:16,920
I'm supposed to as I cancelled an
important shooting...

1005
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,639
Yes, but then you don't listen to anyone....

1006
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:21,280
I told you, not to get involved

1007
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,800
Why are you getting invoved inthis?

1008
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,400
I told you, its just for the baby....
he is innocent...

1009
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,719
I think he should get justice
at any cost....

1010
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,440
Love you didi...

1011
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,639

1012
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:41,559
Hello, yes tell...

01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,559
Near Bolpur, tourist use to come there

01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,760
Actually, tourist like to stay at outskirts....

1023
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,320
Listen, the land owner is 91...

1024
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,960
So if he tells anything out of
irritation, please don't mind...

1025
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,000
No...no...
- He is a nice man...

1026
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,080
As long as he is selling the property,
I'll tolerate if he beats also...

1027
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,200
No option without selling, have none
except two grand-daughters....

1028
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,800

1047
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,680
And have beer...
- Come in....

1048
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,639
Just to spend holiday,
hope you understand......

1049
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,440
Hi Prakash...
- Yes, ad film maker....

1050
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,080
You are the actor...right?

1051
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:39,760
No, not got that prestige yet....

1052
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,760
You can say, entertainer....

1053
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,200
They look so sweet...

1054
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,520
They are sweet...

1055
01:25:55,559 --> 01:25:56,880
They are sleeping....

1056
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,440
How are they?
- As usual....

1057
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,440
Sometime Dip brings here so gets
little relaxtation....

1058
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:12,960
Didi...

1059
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,559
They are living with these memories....

1060
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,600
Was telling Dip will not allow him
without wife...

1061
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,360
Told them many times to go with me....

1062
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,600
But they won't leave this house....

1063
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,960
You stay here, I'm coming....

1064
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,320
I'll just be back...
- Ok....

1065
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,840
Hi...

1066
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,160
This seems like a haunted house...

1067
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,360
It's a palace....
- Told you before....

1068
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:07,719
Go inside, waiting for you....

1069
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,840
This is a heritage building....

1070
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,559
You wait here, let me check...

1071
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,840
Lets go
- sure...

1072
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:34,200
Beautiful...

1073
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,160
I'll make a heritage hotel here...

1074
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,000
Think of a good name from Rabindranath....

1075
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
It will be good...

1076
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,920
Calling you only....

1077
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,160
Grandpa is ill, so all can't go....

1078
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,639
All right, no problem...

1079
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,719
All the best...
- Thank you...

1080
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,600
What are you doing?

1081
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:06,480
Don't search your mobile,
just waste of time....

1082
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,840
I'll inform the police...open the door...

1083
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,760
You are not doing well....

1084
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,639
What happened?
- Komol look at me, no fan, no A.C...

1085
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,040
You call problems...

1086
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,840
There are 1000 of babies like him....

1087
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,320
You will find father of everyone...

1088
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,600
Do quickly and lets go from here....

1089
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,160
Komol please...Komol....

1090
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,200
Why did you throw is....

1091
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,800
How is this house?

1092
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,080
This is going to be a problem for you....
Remember my words...

1093
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,480
Are you feeling sleepy....

1094
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,040
There is a good lunch...

1095
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,480
Explain to your mom what I said...

1096
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,120
Rice and chicken at lunch....

1097
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,639
Wild chicken...chicken curry....

1098
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,880
Its superb...

1099
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,719
Will you start the 'magaj dholai' now?

1100
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,040
What is 'magaj dholai'

1101
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,160
Washing brain....

1102
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,200
What's drama going on?
Give back my cell phone...

1103
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,200
Give back my cell phone or
I'll inform the police.......

1104
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,520
You can inform, we have no objection....

1105
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,280
Door is open, you can go....

1106
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,200
Don't think so much....

1107
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,600
Go....

1108
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,080
What's going on...

1109
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,040
Hope now you understand the drama....

1110
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,680
Now retuning your dialogue to you....

1111
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:03,240
Take child's responsibility or
we will inform the police....

1112
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:11,719
You have a family...right?

1113
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:16,480
We know everything....

1114
01:31:18,559 --> 01:31:25,800
If your family, relatives, neighbours
know this matter...

1115
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,280
then will that be good for you?

1116
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,639
The baby is yours....someone has to t
ake the responsibility

1117
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:37,840
You neighbour or relatives will not take that responsibility....

1118
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,440
I'm not talking about Lisa...

1119
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,200
She is not a child and guilty too....

1120
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,719
She will manage her life,
but what about the baby?

1121
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,280
You have to do something...

1122
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,200
You decide what....

1123
01:31:55,639 --> 01:31:58,040
You have to give compensation....
- Compensation?

1124
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,920
Not more, only 25 lakhs......
then you are free...

1125
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,880
Cheque, give then we will let you go...

1126
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,520
And If the cheque bounce,
we will go to your house....

1127
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,639
Will not bounce, have money...

1128
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:16,600
wait...wait....

1129
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,160
Ask him not to write name on cheque....

1130
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,559
Don't write any name on cheque....

1131
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,760
Just 25 lakhs only....

1132
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,320
You got confused I think....

1133
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,639
I can understand that men don't think
about the dangers....

1134
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:41,639
while having this type of relationship....

1135
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,320
Seriously they don't think, believe me...

1136
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:48,200
So don't think much, just write
the cheque....sit here...

1137
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,480
Write the cheque and have your lunch....

1138
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,520
Want more....

1139
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,719
I'm giving...

1140
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,200
Very delicious...
-Want some more chicken...no......

1141
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,480
You want little more?
- No, so spicy chicken....

1142
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,360
Think about it...

1143
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,520
Rik, take some more....
- no, enough...

1144
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:15,080
D.j...
- let me finish first...

1145
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,760
Give me...

1146
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:21,320
25 lakhs gone as penalty for the
bad habits of youth....

1147
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,760
Useless to think now, eat your meal....

1148
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,200
Eat chicken curry and rice....

1149
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,480
Past is past....

1150
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,800
You all came here for the first time...
how are you feeling?

1151
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,040
Rik you say, how you are feeling....

1152
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,240
I'm not willing to return....

1153
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,040
Heard a lot about our village house
from my father....

1154
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
But never went there...

1155
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,440
Your own people used to stay here once,
infact staying now also....

1156
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:57,000
Lights were on, songs were sung,
worships were done....

1157
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:04,320
Didi, sometimes we have to come here...
- Sure we will come...

1158
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:10,639
A man is staying upstair with his life
partner and will never go to Kolkata....

1159
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:16,600
In this house he have thousands of memories....

1160
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:24,480
Whole time he is living with these
memories....

1161
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,080
Grand pa is an interesting character to me...

1162
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,360
It can be an excellent movie....

1163
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,960
'Jalsaghar' is a same type of movie....

1164
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,440
Tell about your experience....

1165
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:44,280
Want me to be frank?
- yes, be frank...

1166
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,639
Feeling bored, very unhygenic place....

1167
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,680
So much dust, so much hot,
only the food is good

1168
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,480
I like your honesty, you know....
- Thank you...

1169
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:59,400
Probably because I've no association
with this house,so have no feelings...

1170
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,280
To me its just a ruined house....

1171
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,040
I live in a more unhygenic
place than this....

1172
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:13,520
There is more dirt in my lane
at Mallick bazar...

1173
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:19,880
Then also everyday when I return
home from my work...

1174
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,880
I feel happy seeing that dirty lane....

1175
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,719
Its just our views, to you its a
haunted house but to my own house...

1176
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,440
When it rains, water falls on my bed
from my roof ....

1177
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,600
But then also my own house...

1178
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,680
My whole family stay there....

1179
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,040
Where our family stay, that's our house

1180
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,680
This ruined place is Komolika's
own house...

1181
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,639
Grand pa use to stay here...

1182
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,120
I'm finishing my speech....

1183
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,000
Now let me eat the chicken...bye...

1184
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,719
We two old person stay here, you can come somtime...

1185
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,440

But what will I bring for you...

1189
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,120
You will give fruits from garden...

1190
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,280
What will I bring for you...

1191
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,600
What is your profession?
- Grand pa, he is a film director....

1192
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,080
Everytime when you come,
bring 10 dvd's....

1193
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,400
I love films....
- Really....

1194
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,320
I was an active member of film society....
Mrinal is my friend....

1195
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:44,840
They came here so many times...
- What are you telling Grand pa....

1196
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,040
They didn't shoot here, what a
fantastic location...

1197
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,800
Whereever you place camera,
there is a perfect friend....

1198
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,400
Come and shoot here...

1199
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,080
And the party goes like....

1200
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,120
Everybody jumping around....

1201
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,600
Dip da, I got him....

1202
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:59,000
You come and laugh....
Love as much as you wish ....

1203
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:04,840
Let the past be gray and
the future be colourful...

1204
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:16,240
Let us close our eyes and search....

1205
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,120
What happened?

1206
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,360
I've decided who is among four of you....
- Who?

1207
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:30,000
Call everyone then I'll say....

1208
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,880

01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,280
You go and call first...

1210
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,040
I must thank Dr. Ghatak...

1211
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:47,200
I haven't seen the last movie 'Cactus'...

1212
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,920
That time I was out of Kolkata...

1213

01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:56,520

01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,760

1219
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:54,800
Hello...
Good afternoon Dr. Ghatak, Komolika here...

1220
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,880
Yes...
- Thank you so much....

1221
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,600
10 rounds are over, I've chosen
the best...

1222
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,559
I'll go there and tell you in detail...

1223
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:07,960
Thank you, bye...

1224
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,080
Listen...listen...

1225
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:19,240
She got her life partner after
listening to Dr. Anu Ghatak...

1226
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:23,400
So please don't kill Anu Ghatak...
at least to her...

1227
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:28,559
I did everything for her good....

1228
01:40:28,559 --> 01:40:30,400
I tried my level best...

1229
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,240
Please don't tell her anything about this...

1230
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,080
I didn't even mention about the
meat preparation...isn't is...

1231
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,639
Bad actor....

1232
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,960
Rest of 3, please don't misunderstand me....

1233
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,000
No, we promised that before....

1234
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,240
Don't worry...

1235
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:12,440
We even planned to sponser up and down
tickets of Darjeeling for you two....

1236
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:19,960
Whoever you choose among us has been
your friend for so long....

1237
01:41:20,559 --> 01:41:25,160
Now partner, I mean lover...

1238
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:33,040
So its necessary to know eachother....

1239
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:38,520
Don't delay, please tell...

1240
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,880
Rik....

1241
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:17,120
When my beloved went abroad,
I left message for him...

1242
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:41,480
When my beloved went abroad,
I left message for him...

1243
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:59,520
We won't be able to meet this year...

1244
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:02,520
When my beloved went abroad,

1245
01:43:32,800 --> 01:44:12,480
Sleepless nights for estrangement...

1246
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:30,559
Wants to meet but can't....

1247
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,480
When my beloved went abroad,

1248
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:31,559
All dreams are false....

1249
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:48,160
Pains are equal to death but I can't meet you...

1250
01:45:48,160 --> 01:46:07,240
When my beloved went abroad,

1251
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:36,719
What happened?
- Same question....

1252
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,360
What is this?

1253
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:43,520
What are you doing Rik?
- I'm kissing you...

1254
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,600
What happened?

1255
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:52,559
Yoou wer not suppose to do like this
Rik...You are different...

1256
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,760
What should I do then?

1257
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,080
I've not seen you so much happy before....

1258
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,600
Really?
- Yes....

1259
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:07,480
Are you really happy for getting me?
- Yes....

1260
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,760
And you?

1261
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:18,320
I have always loved you but never
let you know....

1262
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:25,559
If you misunderstand me and break our friendship....

1263
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:36,320
But always loved you secretly and madly....

1264
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,639
May I kiss you?

1265
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
No way....

1266
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,920
First kiss of life should be like this....

1267
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,800
How can you kiss me like that
without any notice...

1268
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:11,040
I've to kiss by giving notice...

1269
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,360
There must ba some preparation
before such an incident....

1270
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,120
But for that I've to say such things?

1271
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,080
Loved you secretly...what rubbish....

1272
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,760
What do you mean by rubbish?

1273
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:29,000
Do you know the importance of first kiss....

1274
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,639
Is it just so easy...

1275
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,160
What you did is very unlike you Rik....

1276
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
I don't think so....

1277
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,040
I thought it was very manly move....

1278
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:44,800
I loved it...
- But I didn't...

1279
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,480
You just spoiled....

1280
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,760
Now just please go from here,
leave me alone...

1281
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,639
Go from here...go...

1282
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,040
Look ...
- W hat?

1283
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:22,320
Looking like the symbol of R. K. Films...

1284
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,360
I'm Raj Kapoor and you are Nargis...

1285
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,920
'Awara hoon'...

1286
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,040
Can't you think anything out of cinema?

1287
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,320
Film is my first love, and you are second....

1288
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:43,880
That's very mean....

1289
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,559
But I'm very honest...

1290
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,559
We will stay together for whole life...

1291
01:49:48,559 --> 01:49:51,920
Lets be very frank....

1292
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,080
We will enjoy a lot....

1293
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,120
There is no hurry...one minute...

1294
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,600
Sex is divine...

1295
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,639
And it has got a science...

1296
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,880
I won't do anything without knowing...

1297
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:16,120
Look....

1298
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,320
You should know the manual
before any work....

1299
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,680
How to do it?

1300
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,600
First we will read together....

1301
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,240
What happened?

1302
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,680
I also have kamasutra in my bag...

1303
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:04,840
Come...

1304
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,600
What are you doing?

1305
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:15,800
Will you sleep there at night?

1306
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,440
Yes, is there any problem?

1307
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:27,200
I don't like to take advantage
of oppurtunities....

1308
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:39,600
If we do everything like othrs,
then we will be like them...

1309
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,920
We have enough time...

1310
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:48,400
Something shuld be saved for marriage....

1311
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,200
What are you staring

1312
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,440
You are a very good person...

1313
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,160
I know that...

1314
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:04,680
Good people find good people...

1315
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,320
I've a request...

1316
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,760
Don't mind...
- What?

1317
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:22,120
Give me a hug for once....

1318
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,680
I love you Laden....

1319
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,880
Reception...

1320
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:37,920
I'm talking from room no.203...

1321
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,040
You are bengali....

1322
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:45,880
When is the lastt flight from
Bagdogra to Kolkata....

1323
01:52:47,559 --> 01:52:51,480
1.45, please book two tickets urgently....

1324
01:52:53,719 --> 01:52:57,160
And ready the hotel bill....

1325
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,680
We will check out now...

1326
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,360
We are going back....

1327
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:03,240
Do your packing...

1328
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,240
I'll kill that old man

1329
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,120
Colur matching is useless...

1330
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,160
You returned so quickly....

1331
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,600
What happened?

1332
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,200
Gone crazy...

1333
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,480
You are here....

1334
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
What happened?

1335
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,280
That old man is not a sensible person...

1336
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,680
Totally unscientific...

1337
01:54:40,559 --> 01:54:42,559
100 marks in 10 rounds, one will win...

1338
01:54:42,559 --> 01:54:46,200
And if there is an extra round,
the winner will change...

1339
01:54:49,559 --> 01:54:51,520
If the total marks is 110 in 11 rounds,
then Laden is highest....

1340
01:54:53,639 --> 01:54:54,639
Is this a joke?

1341
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,480
In 12 rounds D.J will win....

1342
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,960
And in 13 rounds Tito will win....

1343
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:02,400
Move....

1344
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:08,160
Either I marry all four of them or
I have to make new arrangement....

1345
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,040
Can youhear me?

1346
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,000
I'm talking to you, didi....

1347
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:36,280
Now I understand why you couldn't stay with Dip da....

1348
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,200
It's not just recommending a name....

1349
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,280
What do I do now....

1350
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:46,840
Move....

1351
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,480
Stop your packing for now, can't you
see my condition....

1352
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:55,719
Your outdoor is for how many days?

1353
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,840
I'm asking you something....

1354
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,200
For life time...

1355
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,360
What?

1356
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,080
I think for whole life....

1357
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:25,639
I'm going back to your Dip da....

1358
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,520
Why are you staring like a fool....

1359
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,840
I'm going...

1360
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:58,240
I played these 10 rounds of Anu Ghatak,
with your Dip da and Prakash....

1361
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,320
Forget about the result....

1362
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:32,880
I felt, Dip has such a life force in him
that I don't think anyone else has....

1363
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,800
I don't know....

1364
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:43,000
As you are looking for a person with
all good qualities of these four...

1365
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:58,400
A person has some qualities of his own
that can last him a lifetime in love....

1366
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,200
For whole life my little sister....

1367
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:07,559
You want all the qualities of four in a single person....

1368
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:11,920
We all use to do that like fools.....

1369
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:21,000
You can get something in life and
something not....

1370
01:58:25,719 --> 01:58:26,719
Let it so....

1371
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,040
Tata...

1372
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:54,840
Shibu da put the luggages in the car...

1373
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:02,440
Suddenly, our madness
will find a meaning...

1374
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:09,680
You come a little way and a little me...

1375
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:37,000
You come and laugh....
Love as much as you wish ....

1376
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
May I come in?

1377
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:44,040
Let the past be gray and
the future be colourful...

1378
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:55,440
Let us close our eyes and search....

1379
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:02,760
Let's try to see the happiness...

1380
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,760
You come a little way and a little me...

1381
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:09,800
May I kiss you....

1382
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,400
No way....

1383
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:58,560
Thhey got married after few months....

1384
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:06,680
Before marriage they went to Anu Ghatak's
chamber to invite him....

1385
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,000
But couldn't find anyone there....

1386
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,720
Now Lisa is working for a missionary....

1387
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,120
She donated the cheque of 25 lakhs
to the missionary....

1388
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:30,280
D.J.went to Mumbai nad became
famous there...

1389
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:36,000
Tito got producer and started
the shooting of his first film....

1390
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:43,160
Now left the boy of Mallick bazar....

1391
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,560
No need to hide his name anymore....

1392
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,800
Laden....
