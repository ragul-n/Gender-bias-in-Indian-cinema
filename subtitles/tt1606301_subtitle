1
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:40,965
Ripped By VICKY.

2
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:59,965
The world is too vast.

3
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:06,973
Life keeps changing with the busy
cities and skycrappers.

4
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:14,608
Among many surprises and fantasies, men
and women are the most fantastic
things.

5
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:44,209
Ha..ln the beginning God created Man.

6
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:50,009
He is on our side. He Knows it.
Man has born to enjoy everything.

7
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,354
So he has created men.

8
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,159
That might be right. But you know,
for any creation there is a trail.

9
00:01:57,628 --> 00:02:00,664
Man has created men first as a practice.

10
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:06,432
He knows that it will be scrap.Hence
he has created sweetly and
beautifull the women.

11
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:11,406
Since there was a defect then,
until today men have a defect.

12
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,511
This is how men and women differ in opinion

13
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,510
and even god doesn't know when it happens?

14
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:22,513
Love is the device god has created
to solve this problem.

15
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:27,217
Love is the magic which joins
the man born at a place

16
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,387
with a woman
born at some other place.

17
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,219
Swetha ..stop.

18
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:33,461
Please listen to me.

19
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,253
Get lost.

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,027
Please give me one last chance.

21
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:38,358
Everybody is looking at us..Go away.

22
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:39,658
Listen to me Swetha

23
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:41,593
Don't ever show me your face.

24
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,208
Stop please swetha...

25
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,606
Love is like traffic signal.

26
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:54,715
Joy and anger keep changing every minute.

27
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,078
Like traffic, Love gets jam some time.

28
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,994
Those who wait, cross it easily.

29
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,625
Those in hurry get injured and fell down.

30
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:13,168
Meeting and separation are natural in love.

31
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:16,834
Who can guess the meeting and separation?

32
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,434
This is our hero.

33
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:22,467
His name is Karthik.

34
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,710
Let's see what happens in his story?

35
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,349
Her anger is presupposing a war.

36
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,648
He is finished.

37
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:02,815
Get inside.

38
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,517
Why are you doing things like these?

39
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:13,360
You asked it before i do.

40
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,623
We have seen such quarrels many a time.

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,124
This is not at all an issue.

42
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,127
They fight now and meet again later.

43
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,502
Don't be mad.

44
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,104
You have made me mad all these days.

45
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,037
l know well of Chans. lf
she is fixed once that's it.

46
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,278
Get away.

47
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,326
l don't like to talk to you right now.

48
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,694
What did i do now?

49
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:52,735
Ya, you didn't do nothing.

50
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:59,171
Don't tell me anything. Get away.

51
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:29,102
Don't call me that.

52
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:30,604
Jhansi is my name.

53
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,703
Why are you so angry?

54
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,609
Nothing has happened as you expect?

55
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,441
Don't talk.

56
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,784
l have seen it with my naked eyes.

57
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:41,910
Whatelse do i want?

58
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,615
No Jhansi, lt just happened.

59
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,417
For you it might be just...

60
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,760
But i cannot take it easily.

61
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,888
Just leave your anger...

62
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,225
And listen to what i am about to say...

63
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:00,128
No need of it.

64
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,536
l didn't come here to quarrel and
listen to your stupid explanations.

65
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,801
Nothing exists between you and me.

66
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:12,044
Enough.

67
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:28,889
Why are you laughing?

68
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:31,164
Where will she go speaking so mad...?

69
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,401
She will come searching ...lsn't it?

70
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:51,217
Why are you torturing me..?

71
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:52,819
Don't touch me.

72
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,218
Don't try to convince me.

73
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,684
Nothing is there between us.

74
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:36,097
The air ofjuly comes afterjune goes.

75
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,497
Sliding deliciously in the lap...

76
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:44,362
There is honey in the flowers dear.

77
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,776
There is pain in the love dear.

78
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,473
There is boredom all these day.

79
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,908
Doesn't know what happened.

80
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:00,855
Though there is laugh there is no love.

81
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:04,892
Though there is love, laugh doesn't come..

82
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:10,462
Forget yesterday and no need of next.

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,268
Only today is important , oh my friend.

84
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:18,665
Friend only you are there.
l am with you in the nation.

85
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:29,182
The air ofjuly comes afterjune goes.

86
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,721
Sliding deliciously in the lap...

87
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:37,482
There is honey in the flowers dear.

88
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:41,627
There is pain in the love dear.

89
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,787
Oh! engaging fragrance.

90
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:11,850
Cannot you listen oh! rememberance.

91
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:15,920
Earth is underneath asking
to play the game.

92
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,230
The sky is the limit for you.

93
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,862
No need of doubts.

94
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:24,271
This is the moment leave your thought.

95
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,108
Every minute lul the heart.

96
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:32,279
Never saw tears in the flowers.

97
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:38,654
The air ofjuly comes afterjune goes.

98
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:42,821
Sliding deliciously in the lap...

99
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,658
There is honey in the flowers dear.

100
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:51,028
There is pain in the love dear.

101
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,761
There is boredom all these day.

102
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:59,106
Doesn't know what happened.

103
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,012
Though there is laugh there is no love.

104
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:07,244
Though there is love, laugh doesn't come..

105
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,820
Just go on oh my little heart.

106
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:57,891
Linger on our flowery lap.

107
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:02,036
The philosophy of sculptor
is to make one.

108
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:06,034
Finding faults is the way of girls.

109
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:10,373
Let's peep into the love of great men.

110
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:14,112
Love is the thirst
which comes and goes.

111
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:18,984
There is no Rama in this world.

112
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:24,557
The air ofjuly comes afterjune goes.

113
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,458
Sliding deliciously in the lap...

114
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,701
There is honey in the flowers dear.

115
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:36,664
There is pain in the love dear.

116
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,605
There is boredom all these day.

117
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:45,103
Doesn't know what happened.

118
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:49,216
Though there is laugh there is no love.

119
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,147
Though there is love, laugh doesn't come..

120
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,686
Forget yesterday and no need of next.

121
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:01,759
Only today is important , oh my friend.

122
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:06,828
Friend only you are there.

123
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,767
Oh love...

124

Forget yesterday and no need of next.

125
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,977
Only today is important , oh my friend.

126
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,609
Friend only you are there.
l am with you in the nation.

127
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,928
Yesterday i have been to
the newly released film.

128
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,728
Not only the cinema, even
my boyfriend is bore.

129
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,170
So, we have to select a good boyfriend.

130
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,196
Now he will turn back and look. Watch.

131
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,768
He will look.

132
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:45,735
No.

133
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:46,938
Why isn't he looking?

134
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:49,208
Don't look back. Control yourself.

135
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,699
For the australian project i am sending
you for 6 months on deputation.

136
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:20,299
Hello Subramanyam sir.

Hey! what is the injury on your face?

148
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,904
Generally in love girls will kiss. lsn't it?

149
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,137
But my girlfriend will punch.

150

She is not sunamu..she is punch priya.

00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:16,493
She quarrels me all the time.

156
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,930
i cannot understand
why is she angry always?

157
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:24,296
Stop that priya shit. My ears are getting deaf.

158
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:27,401

i'll tell you.

162
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:38,749
Both of us went to a
restaurant yesterday.

163

What are you thinking?

164
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,786
lndia pakistan match..isn't it? Guessing
how many wickets we may have lost.

165
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,661
So, you are not thinking of me.

166
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,254
Match is more important than me.

167
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,329
ls this the way to answer?

168
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,433
Do you remember the same coffee day,
february 14th evening 5:30

169
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,567
We have met for the first time.

170
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:05,547
l have been thinking of it.
How lucky i am?

171
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,105
You should say like this.

172
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,482
You spoke some bullshit.

173
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,110
O k, Leave that aside.

174
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:14,421
One day she and me were
sitting in the park.

175
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:19,990
Then one beautiful girl

176
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,820
has crossed like this...

177
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,427
and passed before us.

178
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:35,736
She is long so she is beautiful...

179
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:37,111
Then am i short?

180
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,449
Not like that but you are short
compared to long girls.

181
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,175
Time is not good for you.

182
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,712
lf i suddenly go away
what will you do?

183
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:47,580
Won't you find somebodyelse?

184
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:49,754
Don't know.

185
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:50,989
You have to.

186
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,718
You have to marry and be happy.

187
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:58,028
You will take photographs
with her..isn't it?

188
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,170
You will place the photograp
in your bedroom know...

189
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,466
Then only she will be
happy..lsn't it?

190
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,673
Then you will open my cupboard and
give her all my belongings..isn't it?

191
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,137
How is it possible?

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,841
How is it possible? Her rib size is
28 and she is long also.

193
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:17,044
You are making fun.

194
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,618
Oh.. she has punched you.

195
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:25,250
Buddy, you haven't
understood girls well.

196
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,865
ln their dictionary every
word has a different meaning.

197
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:31,231
lf a girl has said yes..

198
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,092
lt means No.

199
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,098
lf she asks to wait 5 minutes..
it means to wait 30 minutes.

200
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,703
Look after another work if you have.

201
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,105
lf she says as you like it...

202
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,172
lt means won't you listen to me.

203
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,372
lf she raises her brows and tells..

204
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,374
lt means won't you listen to me.

205
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,247
lf she says no problem..

206
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,308
lt means ..one day i will get
hold of you..Then i will see your end.

207
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:54,217
Ask him what if she says thanks.

208
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,088
what if she says thanks.

209
00:16:57,026 --> 00:17:00,826
lt means this is more than enough
for what you have done.

210
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,591
Have you got it?

211
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:06,259
Stop thinking of girls and
do some useful job.

212
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:07,828
Then you will be well settled in life.

213
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,469
she has said well..lsn't it?

214
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,470
She is asking us to leave immediately.

215
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,320
Here... clean it.

216
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:27,582
lt's a little bit over.

217
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,117
Sister, i have seen before..

218
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,448
Even i have been watching.

219
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,358
What's the use? Even your
brother- in- law is like that.

220
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,365
Not only he.. all the men
in the world will be like this.

221
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:42,870
lf a girl is beautiful, we will look
at her for 1 or 2 minutes

222
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,068
ls it wrong?

223
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,372
There are lacs of associations
to solve women's problems.

224
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:50,244
What about men? Not even one is there.

225
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,642
So there is blue cross.

226
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:55,778
They even treat the street
dogs with love.

227
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,381
Sister this is too much.

228
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,319
Even i respect girls.

229
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,618
Some remember
of mother teresa.

230
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:02,990
i salute them.

231
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:04,850
Some remember me of lndira Gandhi.

i salute them.

233
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:08,527
Some remember me
of midnight masala.

234
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,059
That's where i fell down.

235
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,969
That's chemistry sister what can i do?

236
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,529
Don't tell such physics and chemistry
reasons for your flirting.

237
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,502
Sister look there.

238
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,083

00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,822
call me as soon as you go.

241
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,092
First time in flight?

242
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:52,293
Ya..

243
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,051

Have to kill the person who
passed the rule that airhostess
should be female.

247
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,038
lt would be nice
if there were men.

248
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,011
l am getting bored.

249
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:42,549
How long will you read
this useless magzine?

250
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,647
Speak something.

251
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,483
Otherwise sing.

252
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:49,419
Where are you from?

253
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:53,420
Why? Will you contest
in elections?

254
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,127
Speak something jolly. Why
do you ask my bio data?

255
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,492
Are you going to Melbourne?

256
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:03,036
No, i want to jump in between.

257
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:07,300
You are a waste.
You don't look talkative.

258
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,342
Give me your cell phone.

259
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,079
l will tell what you are?

260
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:18,382
All the life you lived is waste.

261
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:20,786
You did nothing useful.

262
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:22,052
How can you tell it?

263
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:25,150
There is no number of
a girl in your phone.

264
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:27,859
Girl friend, love..
nothing is there.

265
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,364
Gopi, manoj , shanker..
all these are girls.

266
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,797
l thought so..
even i am like that.

267
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:37,971
There won't be names
even in my phone.

268
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,008
All of them are codes.

269
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:42,877
Are you surprised at this girl?

270
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,606
l am fast in everything.

271
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:48,873
Why should we think
to speak with somebody?

272
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:53,117
i Know that noone can eat me.

273
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,150
Do you know how
many friends i have?

274
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,028
We should take easy
of everything in life.

275
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:03,430
That's my policy.

276
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,334
From now even you are my friend.

277
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,101
Atleast our friendship will be
there for another 15 hours.

278
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,037

280
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:12,363
Someone has come with
me..Let him come.

281
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:16,293
Who is he?

282
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:28,609

284
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,336
Why are you running so?

285
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,145
You have come here
on the work of contract.

286
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,646
l don't like to talk, give our phone
numbers and address to strangers.

287
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:38,685
Understood?

288
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:39,721

Phone number.

291
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,994
Whom do you need?

292
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:50,764
This is Karthik speaking.

293
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:52,029
Have you forgotten?

294
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,000
Whom are you to remember?

295
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:55,933
ls it so?

296
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:58,030
O k , Give the phone to Deepika.

297
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:00,499
Nobody is there with that name.

298
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:02,409
Don't ever call me.

299
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:06,271
Look , he started immediately.

300
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:08,914
So, i told you not to give
phone numbers to strangers.

301
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:10,144
Understood?

302
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,222
Too many relations depart
in my heart.

303
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:30,498
Bitter experiences in this age.

304
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,802
Memory of my love
remains in my dreams.

305
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:38,769
What happened is not known.

306
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,466
l have forgotten past
and living happily.

307
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:07,739
Don't try to talk something
and convince me.

308
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,337
Think for 2 minutes and tell me.

309
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,680
Have you forgotten the joy
and love between us?

310
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:13,749
That was an accident.

311
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:15,876
There is no need to
remember an accident.

312
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,345
Your anger is not true.

313
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:20,154
You are in fear of changing
your heart if you meet me.

314
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,589
No, it's the truth.

315
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,549
All your imaginations won't be true.

316
00:26:26,228 --> 00:26:28,890
You are irritating me just because
of this phone number, right?

317
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:32,025
ln anyway you try you
cannot speak with me.

318
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,513
Too many relations depart
in my heart.

319
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,257
Bitter experiences in this age.

320
00:26:57,693 --> 00:27:00,992
Memory of my love
remains in my dreams.

321
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,831
What happened is not known.

322
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:08,324
Are you roaming here so that
you could jump onto a beautiful
girl who fells down.

323
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:21,604
Wait, wait.

324
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:03,709
Do you like a girl friend
more than a gay friend.

325
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,625
What is this?

326
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:20,465
l know that.

327
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:21,401
Who are these?

328
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,864
Ask her that?

329
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,963
You have been with her
and even took a photograph.

330
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:28,306
Venky doesn't hide anything.

331
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,881
Understood?

332
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,651
To escape all this i have
come to australia from
andhra. But i was caught.

333
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:47,559
Seeing you is like seeing
andhra pradesh. Come.

334
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,326
Keep all this in your heart.
Don't tell to anybody.

335
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,235
Why did you come to Australia?

336
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:01,099

Even i am from there.

00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,116
lt has been 15 years
i left the place.

345
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:16,251
lf i meet any of our
people it's very happy.

l have met Karthik
while coming from library.

353
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:43,947
While speaking to him,
i forgot the time.

354
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,848
Karthik..The person who
has been with you in
the airport. Right?

355
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:48,952
Correct.

356
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:50,122
You have remembered.

357
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,960
Where to?

358
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,091

00:47:19,614 --> 00:47:25,143
Only the memories

542
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:32,355
Memories have become
parrots and flew in the sky

543

She left.

544
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:10,290
You are finished.

For you.

546
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:38,282
Even pizza for me.

547

lf you don't like it
why did you order it?

548
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:30,004
Because you like it.

549

You have done everything..
Now don't act like sacrificing..

550
00:49:36,484 --> 00:49:39,783
lt's not just pizza that
you don't like pizza.

551
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,752
What did you say now?

552

l didn't like many things.

555
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:49,695
Don't speak commonly.

556
00:49:50,264 --> 00:49:51,288
Tell me what didn't
you like in me.

557
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,691
No, unnecessarily there
will be dispute.

558
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,227
There will be dispute
if you didn't tell me.

559
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:57,437
lt's in your mouth tell me.

560
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:59,169
l didn't like your anger.

561
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,268
didn't like your stubborness.

562
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:02,535
You said not to
look at any other girl..

563
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:03,808
l didn't like that condition.

564
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:07,711
Despite these, you quarrel
for all small issues

565
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:08,973
l didn't like that at all.

566
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,984
There are 100 things
i don't like in you.

567
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:13,710
There are 1000 things
i don't like in you.

568
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:16,782
You said 1000 the
moment i said 100.

569
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:18,252
That's your female nature.

570
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:20,551
You are arguing not
allowing me to speak.

571
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:21,819
That's your male nature.

572
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:24,296
You females won't
believe any of the men.

573
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:26,031
Even the god's
situation is same.

574
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:28,196
Men tell lies by birth.

575
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:29,800
Even god is no exception.

576
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,672
True ..but why will he
fell in females lov?.

577
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,203
There is perversion in your mind.

578
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:39,069
You wait eagerly for girls.

579
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:41,837
lf you see a man ..
it's just looking.

580
00:50:42,149 --> 00:50:43,878
lf we look it's perversion.

581
00:50:46,053 --> 00:50:47,577
Your female justice
is one sided always.

582
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:51,255
No argument with you..Be with
whomever you want to be.

583
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:52,316
Just leave me.

584
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:55,325

You have understood well.

592
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:30,921
What is wrong in
helping your friend?

593
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:32,591
Nobody is in home.

594
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:34,056
Everybody has been to tirupathi.

595
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:38,163
So i thought to speak
freely with priya.

596

You are important than all to me.

l will do anything for you.

747
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:34,663
Ya you will do anything for me.
But what is the guarantee that

748
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:36,664
you won't leave me if you
find a better girl than me.

749
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:41,966
Why are you just killing me?

750
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:43,076
Am i killing you?

751
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,070
Now i understood what are
you thinking in your heart
about me?

752
01:01:47,147 --> 01:01:48,546
You are making me think so.

753
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:50,744
Nobody should die for me.

754
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:53,279
No need to love with such pain.

755
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:55,981
What should i do?

756
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:57,214
You won't change Karthik.

757
01:01:58,024 --> 01:01:59,616
i got irritated telling you.

758
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:01,252
Leave me.

759
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:03,252
Be with the girl you like

760
01:02:03,897 --> 01:02:05,023
Won't you understand me?

761
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,089
Will you always think bad about me?

762
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:10,431
l just think bad but you do bad.

763
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:12,836
Just now your friend has said.

764
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:19,910
Tomorrow is my birthday.

765
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,775
l have planned to spend
the whole day with you.

766
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,315
You have many people
to drink and eat.

767
01:02:27,554 --> 01:02:28,248
Leave me.

768
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:41,266
No problem.

769
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:31,058
This is Raju..

770
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:32,257
l couldn't listen..

771
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:33,532
Raju...

772
01:03:34,168 --> 01:03:35,534
l am in office meeting.

773
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:37,471
l will call you later..

774
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:39,732
Who?

775
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:43,907
They just call me
to drink for free.

776
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,552
You wait here..
i'll come in 5 minues.

777
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:16,935

l don't know what to do?

780
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:21,979
l have come to upstairs.

781
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:23,178
l am having my 4th beer.

782
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,284
lt's your birthday..right?
Didn't you meet your friends?

783
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:28,817
Everything is a lie.

784
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,021
Only solitude is the truth.

785
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:32,495
Your philosophy is fine.

786
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:35,992
Love is like hide and seek.

787
01:04:36,705 --> 01:04:37,729
l have been defeated in it.

788
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,740
l think you had enough beer.

789
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,844
we shall speak tomorrow.bye..

790
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:16,063
How do you know
that it's my birthday?

791
01:05:16,971 --> 01:05:18,233
l will definitely tell you.

792
01:05:18,974 --> 01:05:19,838
Cut the cake first.

793
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:21,941
First tell me.

794
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:25,912
To satisfy you on your birthday
they have selected me.

795
01:05:26,486 --> 01:05:27,954
What...they have engaged me..

796
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:29,988
Who? Myself..

797
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:51,953
because you like to be
with somebody than me..

798
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:55,190
So, this is my surprise birthday gift.

799
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:57,095
That ...Janu..

800
01:05:58,005 --> 01:05:59,871
l don't want to argue with you.

801
01:06:00,709 --> 01:06:02,405
Let it be anything we
shall speak tomorrow.

802
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:36,966
Her anger is presupposing a war.

803
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:38,199
He is finished.

804
01:06:38,504 --> 01:06:38,971
Get inside.

805
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:48,085
Why are you doing things like these?

806
01:06:48,188 --> 01:06:49,850
You asked it before i do.

807
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:51,592
Clever

808
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,652
l don't bellieve in things like
these from the beginning.

809
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:55,321
You have been after me
and loved me.

810
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:58,232
You have seen..all
these won't be too long..

811
01:06:58,838 --> 01:06:59,965
Don't be mad Janu..

812
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,740
You have made me
mad all these days.

813
01:07:02,511 --> 01:07:03,535
You didn't understand me.

814
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,676
What should i understand?

815
01:07:05,081 --> 01:07:06,948
All your talks and works
are very funny.

816
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:09,348
lt's not because of you or me.

817
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,822
That's nature.

818
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,493
Two different charcters..
man and woman.

819
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:14,964
May be.

820
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,900
So..nobody are together?

821
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:18,266
Or loving each other?

822
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:20,363
That's what i am asking.

823
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:22,571
Why onlt you are over reactng?

824
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:28,543
No..this is office.

825
01:07:29,054 --> 01:07:30,044
Don't make me shout.

826
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,751
This doesn't workout.

827
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,760
Go away.

828
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:36,666
Jhansi..don't be aggressive..
and think for a while.

829
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:38,467
What did i do now?

830
01:07:39,004 --> 01:07:42,875
Ya, you did nothing.
l am doubtful. l am wrong.

831
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:44,211
You first get away from here.

832
01:07:45,214 --> 01:07:46,477
Don't talk anything..
go away.

833
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,849
Karthik..ln your life this
much has happened.

834
01:08:09,621 --> 01:08:10,611
So, you didn't forget
Jhansi yet.

835
01:08:11,858 --> 01:08:12,916
What are you thinking?

836
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:14,359
Tell me.

837
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:15,762
Some old memories.

838
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,835
The problem is with her if
she doesn't understand you.

839
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:20,931
lt's with her.

840
01:08:21,674 --> 01:08:23,643
Be jolly in life like me.

841
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,681
Hello miss kumbini..turned thief.
may i catch you beautiful

842
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:53,319
The age is toxic.
Listen with joy.

843
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:55,021
How if the teenage is gone?

844
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:58,726
There some ..Here some..
got some peace somehow?

845
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:04,837
The magical spell of hug.
creating desire..

846
01:09:11,156 --> 01:09:13,148
Oh my god...oh my style..

847
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:15,962
Don't show me that..

848
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:18,766
ln the day time itself..

849
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:21,569
The beauty of the girl dances..

850
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:48,208
Fear is the symptom for love.

851
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,711
For betrayal girls are symbolic.

852
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,561
Your business starts with friendship.

853
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:59,292
Soon you start guess me deal.

854
01:10:00,303 --> 01:10:02,636
The driving energy are the girls.

855
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,033
The real energy are the girl.

856
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:07,374
lf we say what is the time?

857
01:10:08,517 --> 01:10:09,951
You show your arrogance.

858
01:10:11,288 --> 01:10:12,984
lf we just put it..

859
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:15,587
There is limitless fear.

860
01:10:31,288 --> 01:10:35,990
Hello miss kumbini..turned thief.
may i catch you beautiful

861
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:39,764
The age is toxic.
Listen with joy.

862
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,099
How if the teenage is gone?

863
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:11,953
Because of you we
fell into the ditch.

864
01:11:12,388 --> 01:11:14,756
We love and get fired
like the wood.

865
01:11:18,231 --> 01:11:20,827
We believe you and
keep our hand.

866
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,296
Later even if it is false,
we won't leave you.

867
01:11:23,706 --> 01:11:26,040
You lock us with the lips.

868
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:28,845
That injury never gets dry.

869
01:11:29,283 --> 01:11:33,586
No dances..no boys..

870
01:11:34,692 --> 01:11:36,422
For you and me.

871
01:11:37,262 --> 01:11:39,060
There is no bet.

872
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:56,826
Hello miss kumbini..turned thief.
may i catch you beautiful

873
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:00,425
The age is toxic.
Listen with joy.

874
01:12:01,135 --> 01:12:02,728
How if the teenage is gone?

875
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:08,571
There some..here some.
.brood peace

876
01:12:09,148 --> 01:12:11,846
The magical spell of hug.
creating desire..

877
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,258
Oh my god...oh my style..

878
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:23,335
Don't show me that..

879
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,968
ln the day time itself..

880
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:29,036
The beauty of the girl dances..

881
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:31,780
Oh my god...oh my style..

882
01:12:32,553 --> 01:12:34,749
Don't show me that..

883
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:37,485
ln the day time itself..

884
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:40,531
The beauty of the girl dances..

885
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:51,275
lf 4 men meet at a place they
have 1 lakh topics to discuss.

886
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,547
But if 4 women meet..they
have only one topic to speak.

887
01:12:55,057 --> 01:12:57,186
Man..There somebody is caught.

888
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,798
Because men are the
only headache they have.

889
01:12:59,798 --> 01:13:03,134
Man can forget all big
things happened in life.

890
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:06,102
But a girl won't forget
even a small issue.

891
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:07,602
That's their problem.

892
01:13:08,546 --> 01:13:11,847
He was just joking ..
why do you get so serious?

893
01:13:14,589 --> 01:13:16,717
Leave it venky..some lives are
like that childhood problem.

894
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,759
What do you mean
by childhood problem?

895
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:21,493
lt's a problem by childhood.

896
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,102
You don't know what to speak?

897
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:29,370
l have come to be
jolly for sometime.

898
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:32,375
Do you have a lighter?

899
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:34,751
Venky come here..

900
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:36,246
What?

901
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,448

Otherwise is there
no lady on this earth?

01:14:30,848 --> 01:14:32,875
No girl thinks that men
shouldn't look at her.

922
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,978
She desires that he
should look only at her.

01:14:35,957 --> 01:14:38,722
So, these hairstlyle..

a girl's problem.

lf thede men get
a chance..that's it.

953
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:45,499
You are unnecessarily
over reacting.

954
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:49,705
That man is 100% correct.

955
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,108

01:20:57,617 --> 01:21:04,687
The truth is that i am
swinging in the warm age.

The pain of love is
gulping the heart.

What's she saying?

1021
01:26:16,174 --> 01:26:18,166

All these women are like

01:26:23,587 --> 01:26:25,920
Help him..he is deeply hurt.

Make a call to the girl.

1026
01:26:47,225 --> 01:26:48,693
Why did you beat him?

1027
01:26:49,295 --> 01:26:50,092

1029
01:26:53,436 --> 01:26:56,771
She is not a girl..

Noone is giving a lift

but one condition.

After you get onto the vehicle,
there shouldn't be

1043
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:56,132
Mainly you should be silent.

01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:39,742
Why are you riding
the bike like this?

1050
01:28:39,877 --> 01:28:43,781
You are catching hold
of me while driving..

1051
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,552
While turning, on speedbreakers
, applying brakes..

1052
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,418
There is a kick in bike riding

1053

On the way, i caught
Jhansi like this...

01:29:13,532 --> 01:29:15,125
Nothing like that.

01:29:33,298 --> 01:29:36,098
No, there is something
in your heart.

Why are you sitting there?

1067

Somebody has droped down

1068
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,584
How could you say
like you watched it?

1069
01:29:52,664 --> 01:29:55,259
No girl sits alone like this.

1070
01:29:56,136 --> 01:29:58,230
You girls have only
one problem...men.

1071
01:29:58,773 --> 01:29:59,604
Who is the man?

1072
01:30:01,544 --> 01:30:02,876
Don't imagine something?

1073
01:30:03,782 --> 01:30:05,978

These white men are intelligent.

1078
01:31:09,223 --> 01:31:11,488
They could research
from rocket to animals.

1079
01:31:12,228 --> 01:31:14,254
That is related
to men...let's go.

1080
01:31:14,664 --> 01:31:16,133
Men related..? what?

1081
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:18,069
That Ox is not
mating with the cow.

1082
01:31:18,471 --> 01:31:19,996
Might be some family problem.

1083
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:22,541
These days even animals
have changed their taste.

1084
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:26,913
That is one ox mates
with one cow only once.

1085
01:31:27,286 --> 01:31:29,847
To make both of
them mate again..

1086
01:31:30,156 --> 01:31:35,621
That cow is decorated...perfumed
and waxed as another cow

1087
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:45,306
Look Jhansi..if animals are like
this..what about humans..

1088
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:46,841
Come..

1089
01:32:07,284 --> 01:32:09,186
ls this the finalised design?

1090
01:32:09,755 --> 01:32:11,553
lf you approve
it i'll mail it.

1091
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,355
Wait for two minutes
.. i'll finish it.

1092
01:32:17,435 --> 01:32:18,460
We can send it even tomorrow.

1093
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:25,012
{Singing a telugu song..}

1094
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:32,991
Where are you going
so urgently?

1095
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:36,996
Karthik said that he
will pick me up.

1096
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:40,238
if animals are like
this..what about humans?

1097
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:43,067
Waait i am also coming.

1098
01:33:26,582 --> 01:33:28,551
Karthik, i am too hungry.
will you bring me
something?

1099
01:33:28,952 --> 01:33:29,286
What?

1100
01:33:29,286 --> 01:33:31,153
i am too hungry.
will you bring me
something?

1101
01:34:35,695 --> 01:34:37,254
You have missed
a good match.

1102
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:39,658
ln the end pascal
made a kick..

1103
01:34:46,446 --> 01:34:47,937
l forgot the car keys
..somewhere.

1104
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,888
What happened?

1105
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:13,725
l had an injury.

1106
01:35:13,725 --> 01:35:14,521
Where?

1107
01:35:14,927 --> 01:35:15,518
Here.

1108
01:35:16,296 --> 01:35:17,320
ls it painful?

1109
01:35:26,345 --> 01:35:27,677
l couldn't walk.

1110
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:38,899
What happened?

1111
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:40,334
Nothing has happened.

1112
01:35:41,637 --> 01:35:43,970
l wanted to see how will
it be if he carries me.

1113
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:56,819
What you have
done is wrong.

1114
01:35:57,396 --> 01:35:58,989
Why did you drink
too much?

1115
01:36:00,068 --> 01:36:01,400
Tell me sorry

1116
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:02,596
Get up.

1117
01:36:02,839 --> 01:36:05,274
You freely drink and fell
down freely everywhere.

1118
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,541
Go to bedroom.

1119
01:36:09,016 --> 01:36:10,483
Even today it has
become more.

1120
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:21,996
Why are you wearing
shades in the night.

1121
01:36:22,404 --> 01:36:23,770
i have met two madrasis.

1122
01:36:24,575 --> 01:36:26,635
They might have attached
me madras eye.

1123
01:36:29,182 --> 01:36:30,240
l have a super medicine.

1124
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:31,912
lf u want i'll give it.

1125
01:36:33,522 --> 01:36:34,251
You are the real friend.

1126
01:36:38,664 --> 01:36:39,653
Please open your eyes.

1127
01:36:39,732 --> 01:36:40,722
l'll apply your ointment.

1128
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,363
lt's smelling different.

1129
01:36:43,873 --> 01:36:45,068
Check out the expiry date.

1130
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,602
You are on drink.

1131
01:36:48,047 --> 01:36:51,576
wait for 5 minutes..
you can see wonders.

1132
01:36:53,455 --> 01:36:54,582
eyes are getting pain.

1133
01:36:59,265 --> 01:37:00,756
eyes are getting pain.

1134
01:37:01,201 --> 01:37:02,760
i couldn't open eyes.

1135
01:37:03,172 --> 01:37:04,800
i couldn't open eyes.

1136
01:37:05,575 --> 01:37:06,270
What's the medicine?

1137
01:37:07,445 --> 01:37:11,782
They show it in tv. FEVlCOL

1138
01:37:11,985 --> 01:37:15,218
you have pasted my
eyes with fevicol

1139
01:37:16,626 --> 01:37:17,491
You uneducated brute.

1140
01:37:18,196 --> 01:37:19,858
Who gave you australian visa?

1141
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:25,141
Now i need somebody's
help to go to bathroom.

1142
01:37:25,141 --> 01:37:26,130
l am there.

1143
01:37:26,743 --> 01:37:27,869
To see what i'll do there.

1144
01:37:28,213 --> 01:37:28,975
i'll take you come.

1145
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:33,416
Go straight and finish ..
that's the bathroom.

1146
01:37:33,855 --> 01:37:36,223
see that nobody will come.
lf they come they
will also loose eyes.

1147
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,811
Deepu, where
are you from?

1148
01:39:15,122 --> 01:39:16,988
l have seen you and Karthik
in the skating ground.

1149
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:19,791
You have seen, why
are you asking again?

1150
01:39:21,065 --> 01:39:23,034
You have come
on contract work.

1151
01:39:23,602 --> 01:39:24,900
Not to roam with everyone.

1152
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,438
He is Karthik.

1153
01:39:30,814 --> 01:39:33,147
Now it will be like that,
but at the end i know.

1154
01:39:34,053 --> 01:39:35,715
You are speaking like old woman.

1155
01:39:36,222 --> 01:39:39,661
l doesn't care.

1156
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:42,658
What will you do,
if he leaves you?

1157
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:45,502
lf he leaves,
i'll leave him.

1158
01:39:47,308 --> 01:39:48,867
You won't understand
until you experience it.

1159
01:39:51,648 --> 01:39:52,911
l am telling it for your good.

1160
01:39:52,983 --> 01:39:55,112
You have mistaken men.

1161
01:39:55,788 --> 01:39:57,188
They see lot of girls.

1162
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,357
But they will be close
with only one girl.

1163
01:40:01,365 --> 01:40:04,666
Why are you so
anger about him?

1164
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:06,499
What do you know about him?

1165
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,401
l know more than you do.

1166
01:40:11,247 --> 01:40:12,579
We were in love sometime.

1167
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:17,816
He loved me,
i loved him.

1168
01:40:44,936 --> 01:40:46,461
So, you got separated.

1169
01:40:55,419 --> 01:40:58,083
Don't you think of
him even in dreams?

1170
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:09,099
Won't you remember
him even in solitude.

1171
01:41:10,979 --> 01:41:12,675
Don't speak of him to me.

1172
01:41:25,903 --> 01:41:27,838
So, Karthik has deceived you.

1173
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,511
There is no relation
betwen him and me.

1174
01:41:34,818 --> 01:41:37,618
l am happy forgetting
everything.

1175
01:41:39,692 --> 01:41:43,357
But i am feeling that
you still love karthik.

1176
01:41:46,671 --> 01:41:51,304
There is no space for Karthik
and love in my heart.

1177
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:54,548
l am going to love Karthik.

1178
01:41:56,387 --> 01:42:00,291
Until now there is only
friendship between us.

1179
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:04,655
But there is no
wrong in loving him.

1180
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:14,005
What you didn't like in
Karthik i liked them in Karthik.

1181
01:42:15,084 --> 01:42:16,416
Don't speak like mad.

1182
01:42:17,889 --> 01:42:23,455
lf love has another name called
mad..now i am turning mad.

1183
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:26,290
l like Karthik.

1184
01:42:27,972 --> 01:42:29,099
i LOVE karthik.

1185
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:31,638
l don't know whether
he is loving me.

1186
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:36,443
But he will love
me in a week.

1187
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:17,812
See on the day one.

1188
01:43:19,724 --> 01:43:22,559
Slowly changing you.

1189
01:43:23,296 --> 01:43:26,461
l came to know this minute.

1190
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:33,679
My heart is singing
..learnt something..

1191
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:38,419
She doesn't listen to me.

1192
01:43:38,955 --> 01:43:42,085
How if something happens?

1193
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:52,234
See on the day one.

1194
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,779
Slowly changing you.

1195
01:43:57,919 --> 01:44:01,152
l came to know this minute.

1196
01:44:18,153 --> 01:44:21,318
Love which has spread everywhere

1197
01:44:21,425 --> 01:44:25,158
has rounded the entire body.

1198
01:44:25,431 --> 01:44:30,565
This experience is new now.

1199
01:44:33,545 --> 01:44:36,846
Love starts as a pearl size.

1200
01:44:37,585 --> 01:44:40,385
But the whole heart sinks.

1201
01:44:40,523 --> 01:44:45,862
lt doesn't leave
if once sticked.

1202
01:44:52,543 --> 01:44:57,882
This is the love sea.

1203
01:44:58,285 --> 01:45:01,484
But couldn't reach love.

1204
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:06,025
See on the day one.

1205
01:45:06,766 --> 01:45:09,361
see oh dear.

1206
01:45:10,974 --> 01:45:13,876
Slowly changing me.

1207
01:45:14,779 --> 01:45:17,773
l came to know this minute.

1208
01:45:39,053 --> 01:45:42,024
Sprinkle love in heart and see.

1209
01:45:42,558 --> 01:45:45,757
Otherwise you are nothing.

1210
01:45:46,031 --> 01:45:51,062
You are away.
life is dry.

1211
01:45:54,345 --> 01:45:57,544
Love from the lips.

1212
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:00,955
creates a problem.

1213
01:46:01,456 --> 01:46:06,396
Sleep is not there for life.

1214
01:46:13,276 --> 01:46:21,848
All pains are sweet in love.

1215
01:46:23,325 --> 01:46:26,228
See on the day one.

1216
01:46:31,539 --> 01:46:35,136
Slowly changing you.

1217
01:46:35,512 --> 01:46:38,574
l came to know this minute.

1218
01:46:39,886 --> 01:46:42,584
Salt appears diamond.

1219
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:45,185
The magic is done by love.

1220
01:46:46,998 --> 01:46:50,731
That joy is less.

1221
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,035
The pains haughting
should be careful.

1222
01:47:33,273 --> 01:47:35,209
What are you doing
in the dark?

1223
01:47:36,078 --> 01:47:37,637
l am searching my phone.

1224
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:39,445
Why does it be in
my pant pocket?

1225
01:48:03,657 --> 01:48:06,753
What is this? She is already
mistaken me.

1226
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:08,990
You are makibg
her more angry

1227
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,392
That's her nature.

1228
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:14,873
Both of you are girls but
why don't you understand?

1229
01:48:15,009 --> 01:48:18,037
Why are you so caring?

1230
01:48:18,782 --> 01:48:19,771
Nothing.

1231
01:48:20,585 --> 01:48:23,385
You have hided many things.

1232
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:25,922
i know everything.

1233
01:48:26,395 --> 01:48:27,384
What do you know?

1234
01:48:27,496 --> 01:48:28,759
Both of you have loved.

1235
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:32,637
You are still loving her.

1236
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,604
But she didn't understand
until now.

1237
01:48:36,644 --> 01:48:38,978
lf that is the problem let's
make her to understand.

1238
01:48:39,849 --> 01:48:41,751
She is just anger
looking at me.

1239
01:48:42,354 --> 01:48:44,824
But i don't have that problem.

1240
01:48:45,926 --> 01:48:47,919
i'll plan. what
will you plan?

1241
01:48:48,431 --> 01:48:50,093
Won't say.
i'll do it.

1242
01:48:52,103 --> 01:48:54,232
There is kick only
in competiton.

1243
01:48:55,108 --> 01:48:58,546
She doen't understand
Karthik i'll win.

1244
01:48:59,115 --> 01:49:00,606
Let's see what will happen?

1245
01:49:03,489 --> 01:49:04,683
What are you reading
from morning?

1246
01:49:06,894 --> 01:49:08,590
Jhansi's diary.

1247
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,400
My diary.

1248
01:49:11,602 --> 01:49:13,366
Don't you know that reading
somebody's dairy is wrong.

1249
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:15,303
Give.

1250
01:49:15,876 --> 01:49:20,714
Reading somebody's diary
gives the utmost pleasure.

1251
01:49:21,685 --> 01:49:23,814
But your diary
nothing is there.

1252
01:49:45,158 --> 01:49:47,093
Karthik has invited
you to lunch

1253
01:50:04,989 --> 01:50:06,788
l don't think
she will come.

1254
01:50:07,594 --> 01:50:08,562
Definitelty she will come.

1255
01:50:21,484 --> 01:50:23,385
No use of waiting.

1256
01:50:25,022 --> 01:50:26,718
She is stubbourn by birth

1257
01:50:38,845 --> 01:50:42,044
You are right.
i'll go.

1258
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:44,051
Don't be so speed, let
her wait for sometime.

1259
01:50:44,288 --> 01:50:45,813
She will be anger
and leave the place.

1260
01:50:47,927 --> 01:50:50,295
Then she won't come here.

1261
01:50:50,398 --> 01:50:51,330
Wait for a while.

1262
01:50:54,337 --> 01:50:55,305
i'll go.

1263
01:51:02,852 --> 01:51:04,582
You'll get a phone.

1264
01:51:16,106 --> 01:51:16,903
Wait..

1265
01:51:26,057 --> 01:51:28,117
You don't know what
Jhansi will do if she is anger.

1266
01:51:28,995 --> 01:51:31,328
What ..she will
call you again.

1267
01:51:36,006 --> 01:51:39,672
Jhansi..again..l'll speak.

1268
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:57,699
She will leave...enough.

1269
01:51:58,377 --> 01:51:59,776
Then, why are you waiting go..

1270
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:01,143
Go, and speak with her.

1271
01:52:16,606 --> 01:52:18,542
Sorry for the late.

1272
01:52:23,751 --> 01:52:25,777
l know you'll come.

1273
01:52:27,357 --> 01:52:28,325
Why did you
ask me to come?

1274
01:52:30,462 --> 01:52:31,896
You have come..why reasons.?

1275
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,933
Ok i'll leave.

1276
01:52:34,436 --> 01:52:36,098
You won't come..
if you want to leave.

1277
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,337
What do you want?

1278
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:40,706
l have to speak to
you to be frank.

1279
01:52:40,946 --> 01:52:42,744
Just for ten minutes.

1280
01:52:44,218 --> 01:52:45,311
What will you say newly?

1281
01:52:45,921 --> 01:52:46,513
tell.

1282
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:54,492
speak if you want to.

1283
01:53:06,422 --> 01:53:09,791
You have waited for 10
seconds with tension.

1284
01:53:10,161 --> 01:53:13,894
That's enough for telling that
i am there in your heart.

1285
01:53:14,435 --> 01:53:15,904
You are imagining yourself.

1286
01:53:15,904 --> 01:53:19,433
We shall start our
argument after our lunch.

1287
01:53:20,412 --> 01:53:21,777
l know what you like.

1288
01:53:22,448 --> 01:53:24,280
But don't know whether
you still like it?

1289
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:28,313
l don't have the habit
of changing my tastes.

1290
01:53:29,225 --> 01:53:31,661
l am an idiot who has lost you.

1291
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:36,201
l am happy that
i saw you again.

1292
01:53:40,243 --> 01:53:44,205
l won't irritate you
telling the past.

1293
01:53:44,851 --> 01:53:47,014
Let's think that
we have met now.

1294
01:53:48,224 --> 01:53:50,887
You accept me as
friend if you like to

1295
01:54:03,916 --> 01:54:05,509
Come in

1296
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:12,119
Hi, Karthik , why haven't you
sent the mail from
the last two days.

1297
01:54:12,396 --> 01:54:15,595
Your brother in law is anger..
Are u washing your clothes.

1298
01:54:17,204 --> 01:54:19,970
Marry quickly.

1299
01:54:20,476 --> 01:54:25,075
l have seen your photographs.
our vidya's marriage.

1300
01:54:25,552 --> 01:54:27,020
l'll send you mail
after marriage.

1301
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:38,637
l am trying for you
from morning. Where
are you?

1302
01:54:39,508 --> 01:54:41,204
l have sent a bouquet
on your name.

1303
01:54:41,645 --> 01:54:43,546
She felt anger.

1304
01:54:44,383 --> 01:54:46,852
Our plan will
workout today.

1305
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:50,524
Do you remember
what i have said?

1306
01:55:02,278 --> 01:55:03,803
This has also failed.

1307
01:55:04,449 --> 01:55:07,181
l thought how
did it go well?

1308
01:55:07,688 --> 01:55:12,390
Everything has gone waste..
she listened to all you said
in the machine and left the place.

1309
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:15,166
What should i do?

1310
01:55:15,634 --> 01:55:17,296
Why are you asking me,
i am getting sleep.

1311
01:55:17,704 --> 01:55:18,899
l am not feeling well.

1312
01:55:19,574 --> 01:55:20,563
l want to meet you.

1313
01:55:20,609 --> 01:55:21,838
Do you know how
much is the time?

1314
01:55:22,746 --> 01:55:24,977
For me please.

1315
01:55:28,054 --> 01:55:33,461
lt's better you love
me than Trying her.

1316
01:55:34,064 --> 01:55:35,396
Be serious.

1317
01:55:35,533 --> 01:55:36,465
ok serious.

1318
01:55:37,203 --> 01:55:41,666
We shall go to Jhansi and ask
her why are you eating us?

1319
01:55:42,211 --> 01:55:44,009
No jokes.

1320
01:55:45,149 --> 01:55:46,481
How did you love her?

1321
01:55:48,154 --> 01:55:51,216
Does she and you
match in any opinion?

1322
01:55:51,793 --> 01:55:53,888
Leave past what now.

1323
01:55:54,431 --> 01:55:54,954
Tell me that.

1324
01:55:56,668 --> 01:55:57,636
Give sometime.

1325
01:55:58,972 --> 01:56:00,463
l'll speak to her.

1326
01:56:00,775 --> 01:56:02,368
lf she doesn't...
Leave her.

1327
01:56:02,711 --> 01:56:04,043
No other girls?

1328
01:56:04,915 --> 01:56:07,681
How many days
will you be loving ?

1329
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,188
Stop that deepu.

1330
01:56:10,257 --> 01:56:13,194
Do you know the difficult
thing in the world?

1331
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,393
Joining two lovers.

1332
01:56:16,267 --> 01:56:17,394
Why are you doing it for me?

1333
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:21,699
Because i like you.

1334
01:56:27,753 --> 01:56:29,483
see her Karthik.

1335
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:31,751
Nice know.

1336
01:57:19,438 --> 01:57:21,931
What happened?

1337
01:57:42,843 --> 01:57:44,311
We are going to royal melbourne.

1338
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,285
Lift he paper.

1339
02:01:01,302 --> 02:01:03,271
She has come for you.

1340
02:01:03,873 --> 02:01:06,138
Son't miss this chance

1341
02:01:07,078 --> 02:01:09,138
Tell what is there
in your heart?

1342
02:01:19,432 --> 02:01:20,593
How is it?..
lt's ok

1343
02:01:34,122 --> 02:01:35,647
Here.

1344
02:01:37,629 --> 02:01:39,222
Don't flop this time.

1345
02:01:40,066 --> 02:01:41,056
Speak.

1346
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:53,685
l am thirsty.

1347
02:01:56,527 --> 02:02:00,295
When did you come? Plumber could
have done it for 10 dollars.

1348
02:02:01,067 --> 02:02:02,729
He left it and
cut his hand.

1349
02:02:03,404 --> 02:02:04,633
You can say him.

1350
02:02:06,376 --> 02:02:08,642
lt's a kind of good.

1351
02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:13,986
Now only we can know who is
good and who takes care of us?

1352
02:02:15,858 --> 02:02:17,919
Everybody marries
for company.

1353
02:02:18,396 --> 02:02:19,421
Even i have done for it.

1354
02:02:27,411 --> 02:02:29,607
All of you should
come to my home.

1355
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:38,762
l am busy at home. Come
to coffee shop tomorrow.

1356
02:02:38,762 --> 02:02:40,594
l'll be free there.
we shall speak there.

1357
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:44,770
What are you doing?

1358
02:02:45,239 --> 02:02:47,903
Time is up.

1359
02:02:48,178 --> 02:02:49,111
They have come.

1360
02:02:50,215 --> 02:02:51,477
Go quick.

1361
02:02:59,229 --> 02:02:59,958
welcome.

1362
02:03:26,675 --> 02:03:30,808
You are a free bird, you
don't have family and
children.

1363
02:03:30,915 --> 02:03:32,713
One man has
escaped from her.

1364
02:03:34,387 --> 02:03:39,191
Life is like been after
him and bearing
chidren.

1365
02:03:39,797 --> 02:03:41,230
Puspa's is luck.

1366
02:03:43,469 --> 02:03:45,335
Don't marry has become fashion.

1367
02:03:45,872 --> 02:03:47,431
But they need boyfriend.

1368
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:49,001
What logic is this?

1369
02:03:49,479 --> 02:03:51,573
Men can..Then
why not GlRL?

1370
02:03:52,016 --> 02:03:53,575
Men are the only
problem for women.

1371
02:03:53,886 --> 02:03:55,616
But womenare the
only happiness of men.

1372
02:03:56,423 --> 02:03:58,757
Men are selfish.

1373
02:03:59,462 --> 02:04:01,830
To make the happy cry
is female's nature.

1374
02:04:02,233 --> 02:04:04,567
Love marriage is
better for all this.

1375
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:06,831
But the problem is love marriage.

1376
02:04:07,776 --> 02:04:09,768
The problem is not whether
love or arranged marriage.

1377
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:12,772
The problem is whom
are we getting marred.

1378
02:04:13,384 --> 02:04:16,287
Stop non sense..
let's have the dinner.

1379
02:04:17,325 --> 02:04:18,155
There should be
no doubt in love.

1380
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:20,929
What do you expect
from the girl?

1381
02:04:21,297 --> 02:04:22,595
Cannot you undertand?

1382
02:04:23,401 --> 02:04:25,495
Suppose if i am loving her.

1383
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:33,984
l have some
questions to ask her.

1384
02:04:34,353 --> 02:04:35,411
Even i have some questions.

1385
02:04:36,756 --> 02:04:40,559
lf we come to an
understanding there
will be no problems.

1386
02:04:42,032 --> 02:04:43,625
What do you like in men?

1387
02:04:43,902 --> 02:04:49,811
Telling lies...They do it
secretly and get caught.

1388
02:04:50,245 --> 02:04:53,683
Men cannot hide a secret.

1389
02:04:57,524 --> 02:05:00,359
What do men don't
like in women?

1390
02:05:00,663 --> 02:05:03,964
Doubtibg..searching for
another girl's number
in men's phone.

1391
02:05:04,435 --> 02:05:07,600
To check for women's
hair in car and shirt.

1392
02:05:08,142 --> 02:05:10,043
We don't like all this.

1393
02:05:10,145 --> 02:05:14,710
Women cannot digest men
speaking to another girl.

1394
02:05:15,086 --> 02:05:16,816
Women's biggest complex.

1395
02:05:17,691 --> 02:05:19,887
What do you expect from girls?

1396
02:05:21,496 --> 02:05:22,759
What do you expect from boys?

1397
02:05:25,203 --> 02:05:27,604
Why do two lovers get problems?

1398
02:05:27,907 --> 02:05:38,313
The girl is concerned only
about love..but later she
is into financial dealings.

1399
02:05:38,658 --> 02:05:39,887
Then..

1400
02:05:41,129 --> 02:05:45,796
Before loving many sms's flowers..

1401
02:05:46,137 --> 02:05:50,236
But after that you
will make us to wait.

1402
02:05:50,778 --> 02:05:52,337
That's where problems start.

1403
02:05:54,752 --> 02:05:56,243
What's the advantage of girl's?

1404
02:05:56,621 --> 02:06:01,425
We are with the man
wihout expexting anything.

1405
02:06:01,796 --> 02:06:07,363
The truth is that they find
the winner and come for him

1406
02:06:09,309 --> 02:06:11,175
This is the arrogance in men.

1407
02:06:11,579 --> 02:06:14,242
Women's nature is
not enjoying joke.

1408
02:06:14,718 --> 02:06:16,346
You say men are great.

1409
02:06:16,721 --> 02:06:18,053
You say women are great.

1410
02:06:18,490 --> 02:06:19,480
There is a defect
even in you.

1411
02:06:19,726 --> 02:06:20,921
There is a defect
even in you.

1412
02:06:21,329 --> 02:06:22,091
That's what i am saying.

1413
02:06:22,296 --> 02:06:23,195
So, both are equal.

1414
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,064
lf we speak like this
there won't be problems.

1415
02:07:06,803 --> 02:07:10,640
Many relations get
separated in my heart.

1416
02:07:11,778 --> 02:07:14,772
Bitter experiences in this age.

1417
02:07:16,485 --> 02:07:19,650
Love memories stay
in my dreams.

1418
02:07:20,592 --> 02:07:23,688
Don't know what happened.

1419
02:07:31,077 --> 02:07:32,102
atleast give me the glass.

1420
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:42,920
Give a call after
reaching home.

1421
02:07:44,098 --> 02:07:46,864
Thank you brother.

1422
02:07:58,221 --> 02:07:59,883
l am very happy.

1423
02:08:01,092 --> 02:08:02,025
Do you like me?

1424
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:03,126
Ya

1425
02:08:03,563 --> 02:08:04,222
How much?

1426
02:08:04,899 --> 02:08:05,888
Too much..

1427
02:08:06,468 --> 02:08:07,492
How much?

1428
02:08:08,771 --> 02:08:10,103
Too much..

1429
02:08:14,014 --> 02:08:18,977
My dad tells many lies
like you have said

1430
02:08:19,723 --> 02:08:22,023
i like men telling me lies.

1431
02:08:22,928 --> 02:08:24,157
Tell me another lie.

1432
02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:27,793
You are very beautiful.

1433
02:08:29,071 --> 02:08:30,869
Don't play with me.

1434
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,951
will you be with me always?

1435
02:08:40,224 --> 02:08:41,020
l'll be there with you.

1436
02:08:43,028 --> 02:08:45,430
Then i' ll always be with you.

1437
02:08:47,202 --> 02:08:49,695
We have come home.

1438
02:10:46,931 --> 02:10:48,524
Jhansi,stop

1439
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:55,034
You didn't understand
me while we were together.

1440
02:10:55,546 --> 02:10:57,174
Atleast hoped you
understand me after
departing.

1441
02:10:57,649 --> 02:10:58,548
You didn't change.

1442
02:10:58,918 --> 02:11:01,946
We fought for many
days than we lived happily

1443
02:11:05,462 --> 02:11:07,591
Do you know the
biggest punishment?

1444
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,925
The person we love is going
far away from us

1445
02:11:10,805 --> 02:11:15,609
Everybody stands mute
when the lover says
i don't like you.

1446
02:11:16,213 --> 02:11:20,778
That pain is more than death.

1447
02:11:21,823 --> 02:11:23,189
You punished me like that.

1448
02:11:24,761 --> 02:11:27,060
Nothing gives happiness
than love.

1449
02:11:27,966 --> 02:11:29,161
Nothing gives more
pain than love.

1450
02:11:29,869 --> 02:11:31,167
Do you know when will a man cry?

1451
02:11:31,572 --> 02:11:32,904
When the lover goes away.

1452
02:11:33,475 --> 02:11:38,074
Enough..l don't know whether
i am there in your heart or not.

1453
02:11:38,817 --> 02:11:40,217
You have to decide it.

1454
02:11:57,414 --> 02:11:59,508
Thanks Karthik..why?

1455
02:11:59,751 --> 02:12:01,550
For telling me what is love?

1456
02:12:02,823 --> 02:12:04,816
l have listened
everything you
spoke with Jhansi.

1457
02:12:05,628 --> 02:12:08,121
That's..

1458
02:12:08,566 --> 02:12:11,128
l thought love
is just a game.

1459
02:12:12,138 --> 02:12:14,301
But i understood the pain in it.

1460
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:18,106
That pain has
started just now.

1461
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:25,385
There are many
people who didn't love .

1462
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:28,329
But i will tell it.

1463
02:12:32,204 --> 02:12:36,166
l understood when you
have slept in the car.

1464
02:12:37,914 --> 02:12:39,314
Why should i meet you?

1465
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:40,615
Why should i be your friend?

1466
02:12:41,353 --> 02:12:45,190
Why should i love even
when i know that we
will get separated.

1467
02:12:45,493 --> 02:12:46,961
Everything is strange.

1468
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:51,362
The sweet dream has scattered.

1469
02:12:52,204 --> 02:12:55,836
No girl gets everything she wants.

1470
02:12:56,812 --> 02:12:58,576
Their life is in imagination.

1471
02:12:59,383 --> 02:13:04,983
l will be happy enough
alone remembering you.

1472
02:13:16,778 --> 02:13:19,180
When we speak openly
there won't be any problems.

1473
02:14:21,718 --> 02:14:23,050
Kathik, i couldn't see Jhansi.

1474
02:14:23,721 --> 02:14:24,313
Have you seen everywhere.

1475
02:14:24,623 --> 02:14:26,114
l have seen everywhere.

1476
02:14:26,526 --> 02:14:27,152
l'll come.

1477
02:14:27,528 --> 02:14:29,724
l am scared.

1478
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:54,035
Many relations get
separated in my heart.

1479
02:14:54,939 --> 02:14:58,434
Bitter experiences in this age.

1480
02:15:00,182 --> 02:15:03,244
Love memories stay
in my dreams.

1481
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:07,124
l don't know what happened.

1482
02:15:09,964 --> 02:15:13,527
Many relations get
separated in my heart.

1483
02:15:14,839 --> 02:15:17,742
Bitter experiences in this age.

1484
02:15:19,546 --> 02:15:22,483
Love memories stay
in my dreams.

1485
02:15:23,286 --> 02:15:26,553
l don't know what happened.

1486
02:16:08,427 --> 02:16:10,453
Every love starts with joy

1487
02:16:10,697 --> 02:16:13,133
The lovers heart is
the enemy to love.

1488
02:16:14,671 --> 02:16:20,705
Getting understood and separated
rather that living with
misunderstanding is also love.

1489
02:16:28,593 --> 02:16:30,152
Why are you away from Karthik?

1490
02:16:30,563 --> 02:16:31,826
Don't ever ask me that.

1491
02:16:32,567 --> 02:16:33,329
Nothing to tell.

1492
02:16:34,136 --> 02:16:35,467
Please leave me.

1493
02:16:39,678 --> 02:16:41,203
What do you want?

1494
02:16:43,585 --> 02:16:44,609
So, aren't you loving Karthik?

1495
02:16:45,288 --> 02:16:46,756
l loved karthik wholeheartedly.

1496
02:16:47,391 --> 02:16:48,620
But i didn't understand him.

1497
02:16:49,027 --> 02:16:50,996
To be frank i have
made a mistake.

1498
02:16:51,832 --> 02:16:54,200
l thought he should be
acccording to my likes
and dislikes.

1499
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:55,829
That was the problem for all..

1500
02:16:56,406 --> 02:16:59,900
But deepu understood him well.

1501
02:17:00,546 --> 02:17:01,604
She accepted him.

1502
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:04,780
So, you have hided your love.

1503
02:17:07,224 --> 02:17:11,891
Troubling him from near is not
better than leaving him
happy from away.

1504
02:17:12,665 --> 02:17:13,655
So, i have come far away.

1505
02:17:14,903 --> 02:17:18,534
Compromising is temporary.

1506
02:17:19,277 --> 02:17:21,337
Understanding well is the real solution.

1507
02:17:21,947 --> 02:17:22,915
l came to know it.

1508
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:25,818
Becaus you are away,
Will Karthik love deepu?

1509
02:17:26,923 --> 02:17:31,625
Might be...

1510
02:17:32,899 --> 02:17:35,836
First i have been away
without understanding him.

1511
02:17:36,472 --> 02:17:38,100
Now i am away understanding him.

1512
02:17:39,042 --> 02:17:40,807
What about your life?

1513
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:45,245
l have ajob..2 3 friends..
peaceful life.

1514
02:17:46,088 --> 02:17:47,954
Whatelse, i am happy.

1515
02:17:48,625 --> 02:17:50,116
Didn't you see Karthik after that?

1516
02:17:51,864 --> 02:17:53,492
l have seen him once.

1517
02:18:00,711 --> 02:18:01,508
How are you?

1518
02:18:05,219 --> 02:18:06,847
Your kid..

1519
02:18:15,669 --> 02:18:17,433
Where is karthik?

1520
02:18:29,159 --> 02:18:30,559
He is still like that.

1521
02:18:31,061 --> 02:18:32,256
Didn't he change?

1522
02:18:33,298 --> 02:18:34,664
That's Karthik.

1523
02:18:47,622 --> 02:18:49,284
Enough..

1524
02:18:51,896 --> 02:18:56,563
Love is an experience
for all those who love
and get married.

1525
02:18:57,238 --> 02:19:00,368
But for those who get
separated it's a pain.

1526
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:01,241
Sweet pain.
