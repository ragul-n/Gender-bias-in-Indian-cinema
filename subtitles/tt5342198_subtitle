1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,609
Previously on Madam Secretary:

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,101
One truckload of spent fuel rods

3
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,638
stolen by Moldovan thugs

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,558
with no expertise in handling the material

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,478
is hardly what I would
deem a priority situation.

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,808
If the uranium comes with
its own nuclear physicist

7
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,478
to show 'em how to use it...

8
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,348
I'd call that getting the
most bang for your buck.

9
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:21,098
Mom is hosting a conference this
week featuring Noura Al-Kitabi.

10
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:22,348
I think we should all go.

11
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,388
Isn't that the girl who got acid attacked?

12
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:26,848
In Saudi Arabia, we
learned that Hizb Al-Shahid

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,638
is targeting the family
of Noura Al-Kitabi.

14
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,558
Now you're telling me
that that's the same group

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,888
that was trying to buy the uranium?

16
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:35,268
The conference... shut it down. Now.

17
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:37,638
Ma'am!

18
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,888
This way, everybody. We need to get out.

19
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,699
Allahu Akbar!

20
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,308
No.

21
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,231
Come on.

22
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:50,699
Please pick up. Pick up.

23
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:55,808
Come on, come on, pick up, pick up, please.

24
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:57,888
Hey, it's Stevie. You can leave a message,

25
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,972
- but you really should be texting me.
- Oh, damn it.

26
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,764
Stevie, listen, as soon as you get this

27
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:04,950
I need you to call me
back, baby, okay? Really...

28
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,746
I need you to call me back

29
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:08,288
and let me know that
you guys are okay, okay?

30
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,535
It's Ali. And you have the talking stick.

31
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:11,389
Leave a message at the beep.

32
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,070
Why can I not get in touch with my family?

33
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,915
Oh, for God's sake, now what?

34
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,205
The network keeps crashing.

35
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:19,995
Wh...

36
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,590
Turn around. We're gonna go
to St. Anne's in Virginia.

37
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,883
Negative, ma'am. We're

38
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:24,881
under strict protocol to get
you to the White House bunker.

39
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:26,833
No, no, I don't care.
Just turn around, now.

40
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,245
I'm sorry, ma'am. Not your call.

41
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:29,785
There could be a secondary attack.

42
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:32,067
- Do you really think that might happen?
- It did on 9/11.

43
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,955
Whoa, whoa. Uh, Nadine.

44
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,458
- You keep trying, okay?
- Yeah.

45
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,285
Nadine, what is it? What do you have?

46
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:45,495
Uh, we're getting reports
of dozens of severe injuries.

47
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,075
Uh, but no details yet.

48
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,785
We're putting all of our
foreign outposts on high alert.

49
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,535
No, no, no, forget high alerts, okay?

50
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:54,535
I want every embassy and
consulate on lockdown.

51
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:55,536
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:56,745
Hey, hey, wait.

53
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,165
Don't go anywhere. Stay there, stay there.

54
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,205
I got to call you back.

55
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,581
Jason.

56
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,955
Jason.

57
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,375
Hey, baby. How are you?

58
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:05,705
We just went through triage.

59
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,375
They're saying the bomb is radioactive.

60
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,285
Do you feel sick?

61
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,495
Do your sisters?

62
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,535
No, no, we all tested negative.

63
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:13,806
Dad got us out in time.

64
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,075
Okay.

65
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:18,455
It's bad, Mom. I mean, we've
seen people with, like...

66
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,495
there's a lot of blood.

67
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,785
I know. Listen, deep breaths.

68
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:26,455
Listen, baby, I got to go to
the White House for a little bit

69
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:29,665
and then I'm gonna get to you
as soon as I can, all right?

70
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,165
You just... put Dad on the phone, okay?

71
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,516
Mom, Dad went back inside.

72
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,271
What do you mean?

73
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,375
After the bomb went off.

74
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,415
I don't know, he wanted to help.

75
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,951
Where is he now?

76
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:58,265
Pull up, please.

77
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,495
How is she?

78
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,246
- Who?
- How's that woman?

79
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,745
The woman I was helping. She was wearing

80
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:04,418
- the orange dress.
- Lots of injured, sir.

81
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,835
You feeling any dizziness, nausea?

82
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:08,665
Uh, no, I'm fine. I just
need to call my wife.

83
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,915
Sample is positive.

84
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,375
How long were you at ground zero?

85
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,705
Uh, I don't know... seven, ten minutes.

86
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,666
- Look at this.
- What is that?

87
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,179
- He's deteriorating. Hazmat Five,
- What is that?!

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,075
dispatch. Patient
two-niner is now Level One.

89
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,535
Radiation burns on both
hands, probable lung exposure.

90
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,035
I need to call my wife.

91
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:27,360
- Sir. Sir, it's contaminated, sir.
- I need to call her right now!

92
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,835
It's contaminated, sir!

93
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:31,075
Lay back.

94
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,915
Come on, Henry,

95
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,175
come on.

96
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,285
- Can you get down to St. Anne's?
- Yes.

97
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:45,578
- Find out whatever you can and...
- Yeah, yeah.

98
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,126
- take my security detail with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,251
POTUS just activated the
National Response Plan.

100
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,335
The Guard's mobilizing, including

101
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:53,835
the 260th regiment and
the WMD civil support team.

102
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,625
Any sign of secondary attack?

103
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,745
Not yet. But protocol
demands we shelter in place.

104
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,165
You hear from Henry?

105
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,375
Do you know anything?

106
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,575
EMTs found him at ground zero.

107
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,665
He's on his way to St.
Anne's with the others.

108
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,745
Hey, hey.

109
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,245
Our Hazmat teams...

110
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,346
they're the best in the world.

111
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:14,915
You need a minute?

112
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,665
No, I don't.

113
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,415
Metro police confirm a complete shutdown.

114
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,915
All airports and roads are now closed.

115
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,875
Our NIRT Team is putting
a perimeter in place.

116
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,165
Exclusion zone will be
a one-kilometer radius

117
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,038
- in Northern Virginia.
- What about airspace?

118
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,075
F-16s are scrambling
out of Andrews now, sir.

119
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,705
They'll be in combat
formation over the district

120
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,955
in less than two minutes.

121
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:33,495
Preliminary readings
indicate that the device

122
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:35,705
was composed of C-4 and packed with

123
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,705
fuel grade uranium.

124
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:40,075
Fuel grade? Wait, isn't that the same type

125
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,575
that was stolen in Moldova?

126
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,165
But obviously from a different source.

127
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,705
My boys secured that shipment.

128
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,375
I have an update on casualties.

129
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:48,705
43 wounded, ten critical.

130
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,415
That's just from the blast.

131
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,165
About 100 others are being evaluated

132
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,705
for radiation poisoning.

133
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,625
Could have been much worse
if Elizabeth hadn't ordered

134
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,285
the evacuation of the building.

135
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,375
Our biggest problem now is panic.

136
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,205
Dirty bombs are technically
classified as WMDs,

137
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,625
but they're really more like...

138
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,665
Weapons of mass disruption. I'm aware.

139
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,495
Terrorists just bombed
an American university.

140
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:10,375
I'd say that's a little
more than a disruption.

141
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,835
She's right, sir. We can't minimize this.

142
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,245
How bad is the radiation?

143
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,535
Don't know yet.

144
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,575
We got an ID on the bomber.

145
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:21,455
Linda Peavy, age 22.

146
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,035
NSA got into her Twitter feed.

147
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:25,205
Has Hizb Al-Shahid's
fingerprints all over it.

148
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,745
Was she on anybody's radar?

149
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:28,785
No, ma'am. Apparently she was radicalized

150
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,785
several months ago, but
didn't act until now.

151
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,665
A sleeper cell of one.

152
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,125
That's a chilling thought.

153
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,455
Who gave her the uranium?

154
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,075
Unknown. But the man

155
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,535
ultimately responsible is Jibral Disah.

156
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,835
He recently emerged as the De facto leader

157
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,035
of the organization.

158
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:45,081
And where is he?

159
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,125
Libya.

160
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,375
Care to elaborate?

161
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:50,035
I wish we could. HS is a new group.

162
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:52,785
Information about its leadership
and whereabouts are slim.

163
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,835
17 intelligence agencies,

164
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:56,835
almost a million employees,

165
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,625
and this is the best we have?

166
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,575
Yes, Mr. President. I'm afraid so.

167
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:01,383
So what's your plan?

168
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:02,513
We follow the uranium.

169
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,513
If we can trace the pathway to the bomb,

170
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,673
it might lead us to Disah.

171
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,093
Well, get into it with everything you have.

172
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:08,513
I want answers, and fast.

173
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:10,984
The longer we take to
respond, the weaker we become.

174
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:18,883
Did you get that statement?

175
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,963
Just sent it.

176
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,213
Oh, my God,

177
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,673
is that your...

178
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,343
Neighborhood? Yeah. We're
right inside the exclusion zone.

179
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:31,234
So much for living in a quiet college town.

180
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,132
You hear about Laura Vargas?

181
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,383
Is she hurt?

182
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,753
Shrapnel.

183
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:37,674
She's in surgery now.

184
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,713
Well, what about Dr. McCord? Any update?

185
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:41,963
Blake is on his way over to St. Anne's.

186
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,154
There's no word yet.

187
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,693
How is the secretary
even supposed to function?

188
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,382
Okay. I know this is...

189
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,963
overwhelming.

190
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:55,303
But right now, we need

191
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:57,303
to roll up our sleeves

192
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,713
and stay focused.

193
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,253
We can start by figuring out

194
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,343
where that uranium came from.

195
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:05,593
We know it wasn't domestic.

196
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,383
Right, it's all tightly controlled.

197
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,673
So its was smuggled in.

198
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,114
How?

199
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,553
Well, there are multiple vectors,

200
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,053
all depending on point of origin.

201
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:14,843
I can get into it with Energy and DHS,

202
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,633
but it's... it's a scary long list.

203
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,056
- We can divvy it up.
- It's the secretary.

204
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,923
Oh. Uh, Madam Secretary.

205
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,213
Hey, is everybody there?

206
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:24,553
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,423
We heard about Henry.

208
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:27,753
We're all pulling for him.

209
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,673
Thank you. Um...

210
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:33,093
look, I-I know that we ruled out Moldova.

211
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,803
As the source of the uranium?

212
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,803
Yes, ma'am. CIA thinks that...

213
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,093
Thinks they're infallible, got it.

214
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:41,013
But what if CIA is wrong?

215
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,633
I mean, could Hizb Al-Shahid

216
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:45,803
have brought the uranium

217
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:46,923
here in time?

218
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,883
I'm...

219
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:49,754
not sure that...

220
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:51,314
Humor me.

221
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:55,093
Considering the time elapsed

222
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:57,383
between the theft

223
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,803
and, uh, the detonation?

224
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,133
Yes.

225
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:04,614
It's theoretically possible.

226
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,253
Excuse me, excuse me.

227
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,923
Move, move, move, move, move.

228
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,173
Uh, coming through, coming through.

229
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,383
State department. Thanks.

230
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,923
McCords. Hi. Do you have
information about a...

231
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,633
Excuse me. McCords? McCord? No.

232
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,303
One squeeze every half minute, okay?

233
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,844
- Thank you.
- Oh, McCord children.

234
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,145
Thank God. You guys all right?

235
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:37,306
- Where's... where-where's your dad?
- No clue.

236
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,252
We've been trying to find out,

237
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:39,753
but nobody will tell us anything.

238
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,013
Um...

239
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:43,484
All right, wait here, okay?

240
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,013
Hey, excuse me, ma'am, uh,

241
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,713
I need information about
a patient. A Henry McCord.

242
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,676
- McCord.
- McCord. McCord. I don't have him.

243
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:55,173
Uh, McCord? He's in the HIU.

244
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,553
What does that mean?

245
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:57,883
Uh, biocontainment. It means

246
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,404
he's critical. Uh, I'm sorry.

247
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,133
The records were falsified.

248
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:08,944
What are you talking about?

249
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:10,964
The manifest

250
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,423
for the truck in Moldova

251
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,713
was a fiction, perpetrated

252
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,923
by the same corrupt inspector

253
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,513
who arranged the theft.

254
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,253
How the hell did we miss that?

255
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:24,423
Well, apparently CIA took
the stats at face value.

256
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,053
How much uranium is missing?

257
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:29,343
Eight kilograms. Enough for

258
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,673
up to three additional bombs.

259
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:32,963
Which, for all we know,

260
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,239
are already here.

261
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,513
At least tell me

262
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,756
- we have some targeting data.
- No, sir. Not yet.

263
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:41,024
Madam Secretary, I have
Blake Moran for you.

264
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,963
Talk to me, Blake.

265
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,385
Uh, I'm with Dr. Cary,
who did Henry's triage.

266
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,844
Uh, here she is. Secretary of state.

267
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,264
Ma'am, your husband is expressing symptoms

268
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,514
of radiation poisoning.

269
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,354
Beta burns, nausea, vomiting.

270
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,425
Is he gonna be okay?

271
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,925
We won't know for a few
hours. We're taking bioassays

272
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,475
for estimations. It all
depends on the initial exposure.

273
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,264
Okay, I want-I want to talk to him.

274
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:04,424
That's not possible.

275
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,175
We're administering DTPA

276
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:09,214
and a prophylactic dose of Prussian blue.

277
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:10,474
Uh, Prussian... That's-that's, uh,

278
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,554
it chelates heavy metals, right?

279
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:15,554
That's right. Uh, but the
medication is only effective

280
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:16,924
if his exposure was limited.

281
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,424
What if it wasn't?

282
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,474
We'll try to keep him as
comfortable as possible,

283
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,575
but there's nothing else we can do.

284
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:39,064
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

285
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,834
Bess.

286
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,664
How's Henry?

287
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:53,834
They're running tests.

288
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,592
I know we have the
shelter in place protocol,

289
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,012
but I can make an exception.

290
00:10:58,013 --> 00:11:00,540
Deputy Cushing can ride shotgun
until you're ready to come back.

291
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,630
Sir, we need you.

292
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,141
Henry would never forgive me if I left now.

293
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,001
What is it?

294
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,460
We caught a break.

295
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,053
This is security footage of Linda Peavy

296
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,904
outside a coffee shop five
blocks from the conference.

297
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:24,392
It's a dead drop.

298
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,392
The dirty bomb is in that backpack.

299
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,972
And this is the man who left it

300
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:32,512
for her ten minutes earlier.

301
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:33,842
Do we know who he is?

302
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,682
Facial recognition identified him

303
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:38,342
as Munthir Tuwala, an agricultural attaché

304
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,613
at the Saudi Arabian Embassy.

305
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,762
A Saudi diplomat did this?

306
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,524
Tuwala entered the United States by car

307
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,904
early yesterday morning
from Quebec after a flight

308
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,484
to Montreal from Bucharest.

309
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,167
Which is only about

310
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,972
200 miles from the Moldovan border.

311
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,721
Our working theory is he was
able to use his diplomatic pouch

312
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,768
to smuggle the nuclear
material into the country.

313
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,514
Son of a bitch

314
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,851
could be the key to finding Disah in Libya.

315
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,724
- Where's Tuwala now?
- At work,

316
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:05,221
at the Saudi Embassy
on New Hampshire Avenue.

317
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,702
Where we have no jurisdiction.

318
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:13,011
Marguerite, deploy an FBI
tac team to the embassy.

319
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:15,108
General Kohl, I want the
National Guard providing backup.

320
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,360
- Right away.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,101
Bess, summon the Saudi ambassador.

322
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,572
Yes, sir, right away.

323
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,891
Madam Secretary, it's Henry.

324
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,101
Oh, please.

325
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,431
Baby?

326
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,061
Hey.

327
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:34,351
Uh, hey, they finally
gave me my phone call.

328
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,261
Oh, my God, it is so
good to hear your voice.

329
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:38,721
How are you feeling?

330
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,301
I'm a little woozy.

331
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,931
The worst part is this Prussian blue stuff

332
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,011
they have me on. It tastes like paint.

333
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:46,761
Well, because it-it is.

334
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:50,181
I mean, literally made
from paint. I looked it up.

335
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,891
Okay, you didn't have to tell me that.

336
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:54,391
You're one to talk, Mr. Fun Fact.

337
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,221
Baby, I want to be with you so much.

338
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,931
You can't, without

339
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:00,351
a Hazmat suit. Honestly, babe,
that's not a good look on you.

340
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,221
Listen, right now your
place is with the president.

341
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:04,801
Uh-oh.

342
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:07,638
Okay, listen. I got to go.

343
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,935
They're about to do some more
medical experiments on me.

344
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,641
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get
there as soon as I can.

345
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,452
I love you so...

346
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,242
I love you too.

347
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:30,561
Madam Secretary, I'm as
horrified by this as you are.

348
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,431
Good.

349
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,681
Because the FBI is gonna be at your embassy

350
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,101
to pick up Mr. Tuwala in five minutes.

351
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:39,681
I understand your urgency,
but inside our embassy gates,

352
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,641
Munthir Tuwala is on sovereign Saudi soil.

353
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:44,221
I have no authority to hand him to you,

354
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,301
not without official proceedings.

355
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:49,561
Well, you can't seriously think
that we're gonna sit around

356
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,061
and wait for you to talk about it?

357
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,931
You must respect our process.

358
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,511
You're harboring the known perpetrator

359
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,261
of a terrorist attack.

360
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:00,931
So let me lay out our process:

361
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:03,108
you're gonna open your
gates and hand over Tuwala,

362
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,277
or we're gonna break them down.

363
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,151
Madam Secretary, that
would be an act of war.

364
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,922
It sure would be.

365
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,792
You have four minutes.

366
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,151
This is your last chance to surrender

367
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,111
Munthir Tuwala!

368
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:34,910
You have to wait.

369
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,399
We must have permission from the king.

370
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,450
We have our orders.

371
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,177
You cannot enter. We will resist.

372
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,833
Open the gates now.

373
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,086
- Up there!
- On the roof!

374
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,463
Someone get on the roof!

375
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,623
Freeze!

376
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,123
It's Tuwala!

377
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,224
Someone stop him!

378
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,144
We need him alive!

379
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,814
Don't let him jump!

380
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,753
Don't jump!

381
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,854
Don't do it!

382
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,958
With Tuwala dead, the Saudis are being

383
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,167
much more cooperative.
Ambassador Asim has assured me

384
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,586
that their entire government
is behind our investigation.

385
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:28,996
All it took was a diplomatic
terrorist face-planting

386
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,826
on New Hampshire Avenue.

387
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,416
Where are we, Ephraim?

388
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,956
Moving into position outside
Munthir Tuwala's apartment

389
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,376
here in DC.

390
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,376
Sir, we have an update on the uranium.

391
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:39,299
What is it?

392
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,379
My team found a lead-lined
canister in a dumpster

393
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,299
near the embassy. It tested positive

394
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,379
for the same radioisotope signature

395
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,299
as the uranium used in the bomb.

396
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,839
Combined with our analysis of
the material at ground zero,

397
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,049
we are now confident

398
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,009
that Tuwala used his entire supply,

399
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,009
approximately two kilograms,

400
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,669
on the device that detonated in Virginia.

401
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,299
What about the rest of the stolen uranium?

402
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,089
CIA is into it, but the
trail is pretty cold.

403
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,800
- Not exactly the stuff of lullabies.
- Our current thinking

404
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,087
is that it's still overseas.

405
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,213
"Our current thinking"?

406
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,337
NIRT team

407
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,917
just gave the all clear. We're
ready to go, Mr. President.

408
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:13,167
Let's do it.

409
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:16,627
Apollo team in position.
Standing by for green.

410
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,898
Apollo, you are green to enter.

411
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,797
Go, go, go.

412
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:22,978
Go, go, go!

413
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:29,858
There it is.

414
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,781
- Clear!
- Eagle, it's empty.

415
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:44,978
Guy pulled up stakes.

416
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,148
Nothing but an air mattress.

417
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,688
Copy, Apollo.

418
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,409
So much for leads.

419
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,938
So it was a suicide mission all along.

420
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,108
Mr. President,

421
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:57,028
Saudi GID just gave us everything they have

422
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,318
on the terrorist
organization Hizb Al-Shahid.

423
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,188
Including a cell phone intercept,

424
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:02,978
with a recording of Disah's voice.

425
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,068
Alleged voice.

426
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,148
We don't have any recordings
of him in our files.

427
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:08,028
But if it is him, we have a target.

428
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,278
Yes, sir. NSA says the
signal originated here,

429
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,108
at a compound near Sirte.

430
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,184
I took the liberty to deploy drones,

431
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:16,793
just in case we get confirmation.

432
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,123
And I'll reach out to our NATO allies,

433
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,543
see if they have anything.

434
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:23,123
Ephraim, I'm ending the
National Response protocols,

435
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:24,793
including the order to shelter in place.

436
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,761
Yes, Mr. President.

437
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,094
- Sir, if that's the case...
- Go.

438
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,131
Thank you.

439
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,171
Godspeed.

440
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:33,511
Italy, in theory, they've been
sharing everything they have

441
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,921
on Hizb Al-Shahid, right?

442
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,341
All of our NATO allies have been alerted.

443
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,711
And Ambassador Civarelli responded

444
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:40,712
- that he doesn't have anything.
- Which is hard to believe,

445
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,131
with Libya right in their backyard.

446
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,381
Not to mention the hostages.

447
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,974
What hostages?

448
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:47,381
In principle, Italy is like us...

449
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,051
they don't negotiate with
terrorists. In practice...

450
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,051
They've been paying ransom
to extremist groups for years.

451
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,381
And you think Hizb
Al-Shahid is one of 'em?

452
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:57,841
CIA has reports of two hostages from Libya

453
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,921
who were freed only last week.

454
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,471
France, Spain, Austria...

455
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,471
a lot of our allies pay for hostages.

456
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:05,472
Not from Libya.

457
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:07,011
And that's Hizb Al-Shahid's hub.

458
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,471
Well, if Italy's dealt with them,

459
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,511
they have Intel they're withholding.

460
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,921
Look, if I'm wrong, we
risk offending an ally

461
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:16,341
who needs us more than we need them.

462
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,272
But if I'm right...

463
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,261
Call the secretary.

464
00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:22,772
Right now.

465
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:26,844
- Where's Henry?
- Isolation ward, right this way.

466
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,261
Yeah, thanks.

467
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:31,841
Any word on the test results?

468
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,761
Nothing yet. Uh, here.

469
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,594
- What is this?
- Fruit punch. It's all they had.

470
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,841
You forget to hydrate
when you're stressed, so...

471
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,522
Okay.

472
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,131
Okay. Where are the kids?

473
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,341
They're in the chapel. Here,
he's right-right over here.

474
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,421
This room.

475
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:47,422
Sorry.

476
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,692
Just... Yeah.

477
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,551
Can I talk to him?

478
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,732
Uh...

479
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:06,362
Let him sleep.

480
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:10,301
You okay, ma'am?

481
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:13,732
No.

482
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,471
Hey, kiddos. I'm so sorry I took so long.

483
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:23,054
- Hi.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

484
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,551
Hey.

485
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:26,717
Did you see Dad?

486
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:27,881
He's sleeping.

487
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:29,782
We're gonna go see him
when he wakes up, okay?

488
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:32,711
Is he gonna be okay?

489
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,131
Oh, baby, I don't know.

490
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,482
I'm sorry.

491
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,591
I thought religion was
the opiate of the masses.

492
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,511
It is.

493
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:50,812
But sometimes you need a good hit.

494
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:07,427
Hey there.

495
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,511
Huh?

496
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,761
Oh. Hey.

497
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,631
Everything all right?

498
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:12,631
Yeah.

499
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:13,632
I'm just, um....

500
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,591
I'm looking for a place to crash tonight.

501
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:18,011
I thought the perimeter was lifted.

502
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,761
Oh, it was.

503
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:22,862
Yeah. My apartment is ready for me.

504
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,772
I'm just not ready for my apartment.

505
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,841
I got this thing about dust, so...

506
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,471
Okay then.

507
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:35,051
I would ask Jay, but
he's got the baby. And...

508
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:37,511
Daisy would be... no.

509
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:40,211
And Blake's studio is about

510
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:41,881
this size of one of his pocket squares.

511
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:44,051
So I-I am about five minutes away

512
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:45,711
from a desperation move on Tinder.

513
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,551
You could have asked me.

514
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:50,301
Thanks, but I'm allergic to cats.

515
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:52,772
I don't have a cat.

516
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,711
Really?

517
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,881
Are you sure?

518
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,375
'Cause I-I could have sworn you ha...

519
00:20:58,376 --> 00:20:59,572
You think I'm a cat lady?

520
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,350
No.

521
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:03,215
Ha. No. Of course not. I would, uh...

522
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,415
I don't know why I said that.

523
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,566
I'll text you the address.

524
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,915
What are you doing?

525
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,175
Here you go, ma'am.

526
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:14,175
Thank you. Signor Ambasciatore.

527
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:15,675
Madam Secretary.

528
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,255
Thank you so much for meeting me here.

529
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,187
I realize it's highly unusual.

530
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:20,685
No, of course. Of course.

531
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,725
Allow me to present Italy's condolences

532
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:23,895
to the people of the United States.

533
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,555
Very kind of you. Thank you.

534
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,605
Listen, let me ask, when I took this job,

535
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,605
did you, by chance, read my bio?

536
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,605
The blurb on State's Web site?

537
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,185
Yes, of course.

538
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:35,236
You worked at CIA with
President Dalton and...

539
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:39,075
Right. And my-my uncle

540
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,738
- died on the beach at Anzio. William Adams.
- Yes.

541
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,735
He was 18 years old.

542
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,445
My brother is named after him.

543
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,155
And my country is

544
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,735
eternally grateful, for him

545
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:51,735
and for every American who
died to save us from fascism.

546
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:54,945
And yet when we were
attacked, you held out on us.

547
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,535
I don't know what you mean.

548
00:21:56,536 --> 00:22:00,115
Your government has been
paying for hostages in Libya.

549
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:03,985
The CIA has identified two
being held by Hizb Al-Shahid

550
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:07,871
in Al Wahat. You have
intelligence you're not sharing.

551
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,188
- The official policy of my government...
- I've had enough of official policy

552
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,435
today. I mean, have you looked around?

553
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:15,015
Do you see what's happened here?

554
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,685
Well, Libya is already a failed state.

555
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:21,265
Another intervention would
send waves of refugees

556
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:22,766
hurtling towards our shores and...

557
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,265
Refugees?

558
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,345
That's your excuse?

559
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,765
Well, I assure you it is a serious concern

560
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,185
for the Italian people, not to
mention our national security.

561
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,935
It's funny you should bring up security.

562
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,685
Because maybe if we stop
the people who attacked us,

563
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:37,686
then your voters

564
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:39,515
will stop being kidnapped.

565
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,185
Well, it's never that simple.

566
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,765
Mmm, hardly. I agree.

567
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:44,765
But sometimes it is.

568
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:48,725
We have a recording that
we think is Jibral Disah.

569
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,685
All we need is confirmation.

570
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,885
Secretary McCord, your husband is awake.

571
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,645
He's asking for you.

572
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:59,366
I trust that your government's
gonna do the right thing.

573
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:09,121
The doctor will be with you in a minute.

574
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,935
Hey. Hi.

575
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,018
- Hi.
- Finally!

576
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,805
People without needles and pills!

577
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:15,846
We love you!

578
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:16,885
- Hi.
- Secretary McCord,

579
00:23:16,886 --> 00:23:18,638
I have the results of
your husband's bioassay.

580
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,768
Henry's exposure was limited
to one sievert of radiation.

581
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,938
That's enough for some nasty symptoms,

582
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,308
but it's well below a fatal dose.

583
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,598
He's gonna be fine.

584
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,178
Oh. Thank you.

585
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:30,558
Mom, let go of the doctor.

586
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,521
- Can we see him now?
- Go ahead.

587
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,978
We can? Okay.

588
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,098
Hi. Hi. You're in.

589
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:37,309
You're in! Hi. Hi, hi.

590
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,518
Hi, Dad!

591
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,391
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi, big man.
- Ooh!

592
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:41,598
Come on.

593
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,101
- Hey, buddy.
- How you feeling?

594
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,888
Oh. Waiting for my superpowers to kick in.

595
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,224
Hi.

596
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,558
Hi.

597
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,414
Are you okay?

598
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,268
Hi. Yeah. I just want to go home.

599
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,641
- Can I go home?
- As soon as you sign the release.

600
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,099
- Really?
- Yeah.

601
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,099
Okay.

602
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:15,636
So, is it cool if I spend
the night at Bobby's tonight?

603
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,489
Seriously? A sleepover, Jace?

604
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,528
What? I'm returning to normalcy.

605
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,694
Normality.

606
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:21,858
It's an accepted form.

607
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,279
Uh, not while I'm still breathing.

608
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,358
Jace, are you seriously asking?

609
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,118
No. Come on. We're gonna
go home as a family.

610
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,647
While your father's still breathing.

611
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,068
Besides, don't you want to see

612
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,651
- if he glows in the dark?
- Ma'am,

613
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:36,688
uh, I have Jay for you.

614
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,862
Tell me the Italians came through.

615
00:24:37,863 --> 00:24:39,900
Big-time. The recording's authentic.

616
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:43,400
Former hostage ID'd it as
the voice of Jibral Disah.

617
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:45,190
So we have a target?

618
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,690
White House is expecting you.

619
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,299
Babe...

620
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:52,870
It's okay.

621
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:53,661
I got...

622
00:24:53,662 --> 00:24:55,410
I'm in good hands.

623
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,910
I love you.

624
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,583
- I love you.
- Okay.

625
00:24:58,584 --> 00:24:59,871
Take care of your dad.

626
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,261
I will.

627
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,450
Where are we?

628
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:14,540
Our Reapers are just coming into range.

629
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,040
Sir, before we launch,

630
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,660
I think we should
consider a capture mission.

631
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:20,660
What's the situation on the ground?

632
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,450
Difficult. There are a number
of active militias in the area,

633
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:27,290
plus whatever guys HS
has behind those walls.

634
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:32,450
Well, after today's attack, I'm
not eager to underestimate them.

635
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:33,790
I agree, sir.

636
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,370
We could be looking at heavy casualties.

637
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:38,200
For a target of this
value, isn't it worth it?

638
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:39,580
I'm not saying go in hard.

639
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,410
We can monitor then slowly contain them

640
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,700
with Special Forces.

641
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,490
How confident are we that Disah is there?

642
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,620
80%.

643
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,330
A man matching his description

644
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:51,290
was seen entering the compound
a little over an hour ago.

645
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:55,290
In 2001, we slow-played it on bin Laden.

646
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,660
It was almost a decade
until we saw him again.

647
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,790
Public does want a win, sir.

648
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,790
So do I.

649
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,051
And I don't want another Tora Bora, Dennis.

650
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,950
Take the shot, Admiral.

651
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:08,870
Yes, sir.

652
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:12,410
Reaper One, Reaper Two,
you are cleared to engage.

653
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,660
Copy. Missile on the way.

654
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:16,250
Time of flight: eight seconds.

655
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:19,490
Seven, six, five,

656
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:23,591
four, three, two...

657
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,490
Come on in.

658
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:48,120
Here. Uh, let me take your coat.

659
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,221
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

660
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:53,221
Are you thirsty?

661
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:58,330
Is-is that you with Nelson Mandela?

662
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:00,660
You know what, I...

663
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,080
I could go for a scotch.

664
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,250
Single malt or blend?

665
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,540
Surprise me.

666
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,641
Okay.

667
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:13,750
Hello?

668
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,540
Ah, Gael.

669
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:29,560
Sorry.

670
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,390
That was an old friend.

671
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:34,100
We were supposed to go see
Uncle Vanya this evening

672
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:37,771
at the Kennedy Center,
but it was... canceled,

673
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,223
obviously.

674
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:43,490
- I didn't know you were into theater.
- Secret's out.

675
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,657
Mm.

676
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:47,657
That's lovely, isn't it?

677
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:50,287
That was a present from Boris Yeltsin.

678
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:51,834
Do you play?

679
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,338
I dabble.

680
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,824
I had to learn for an experimental piece

681
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,334
my dance troupe did in Minsk.

682
00:27:58,284 --> 00:28:01,634
Here's to unexpected skills.

683
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:07,153
Wow.

684
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:08,403
Smoke bomb.

685
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:09,549
Yeah.

686
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:13,443
It's not the night for that expression.

687
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,493
Sheets.

688
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,734
You know, I always figured that you lived

689
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:18,774
more like a...

690
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:21,156
Not a cat lady, all right?

691
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,866
I just mean more like me.

692
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,196
Half of my furniture

693
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:25,826
is from Ikea.

694
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:27,286
And that's the good half.

695
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,257
Well, we all have our priorities.

696
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,497
I just can't

697
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:35,228
get out of the mindset
that this is all temporary.

698
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,388
Well, if you're worried
about job security...

699
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,468
Well, that's a given in this town.

700
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,228
No, I mean... I mean life.

701
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,308
And that was before

702
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,529
someone set off a bomb in my neighborhood.

703
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,642
When I was a kid, I had severe asthma.

704
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:53,693
Oh.

705
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:56,834
I spent most of high
school in the hospital.

706
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:02,063
My prom date was, uh, the most
beautiful drip bag on the ward.

707
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:04,316
I grew out of the worst of it.

708
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:07,153
Some of my friends weren't as lucky.

709
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:09,023
That explains your fear of dust.

710
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:15,214
My rational mind knows
that it's safe to go home.

711
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:20,414
But I just... I can't.

712
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:24,044
Not yet.

713
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:28,063
Well...

714
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,613
you can stay here as long as you like.

715
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:32,914
No need for rationality.

716
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:40,044
I'll get you a pillow.

717
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:55,403
Wow.

718
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:58,392
They sent the secretary
of state to check on me.

719
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,549
Well, the president was busy, so...

720
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,629
Mm. Yeah. Mm. Excuses. Excuses.

721
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,438
Gosh.

722
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:07,363
Hit by a dirty bomb,
and I still find you hot.

723
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:10,073
Well, that's probably
'cause I'm radioactive.

724
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:13,993
What do you think was up with Jason

725
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,823
and that whole sleepover thing?

726
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,823
Oh, he's a teenager.

727
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:22,233
I think maybe he's afraid to sleep at home

728
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,233
because on some level,

729
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:26,233
this house is a target.

730
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:27,863
This house is a fortress.

731
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:31,384
So was the conference. Look what happened.

732
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:36,443
Speaking of, the doctor said

733
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:40,443
that the tourniquet you
applied to that woman's leg...

734
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:42,193
it saved her life.

735
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:43,294
Hmm.

736
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:46,214
What is it?

737
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:50,033
I've decided to rejoin DIA.

738
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,794
Oh.

739
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,834
Wow.

740
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,153
You know, why don't we talk about this

741
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:00,283
when you're feeling better?

742
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:01,693
Babe, don't patronize me.

743
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,113
You know, a few hours ago,

744
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:06,113
I didn't know if you
were gonna live or die.

745
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,925
Can't we just take a minute here?

746
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:09,906
No. Hizb Al-Shahid isn't taking a minute.

747
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:13,007
You really want to have
this conversation now?

748
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,905
Okay, fine, but you know what?

749
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:18,945
I don't think that we can handle

750
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,775
the both of us being in
the line of fire again.

751
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:24,275
Look what it did to our
marriage the first time.

752
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:25,655
We were fine.

753
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:26,855
We weren't.

754
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:28,716
I wasn't.

755
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:33,315
I got to close my eyes.

756
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:35,405
Of course.

757
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,124
Good morning.

758
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,504
Good morning. Please.

759
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:18,504
Eggs in the hole.

760
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:21,145
The one and only dish in
my culinary repertoire.

761
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:23,675
You shouldn't have.

762
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:27,877
It's just a small token of my appreciation.

763
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:30,099
I know it was an imposition.

764
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,929
It really wasn't.

765
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,450
I should be thanking you.

766
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,809
It's hard to be alone
in the wake of a tragedy.

767
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,639
Honestly, I was happy for the company.

768
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,309
Me, too.

769
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,019
So, how runny would you like your egg?

770
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,070
It really doesn't matter.

771
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,179
The pan's on fire.

772
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,140
What?

773
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,229
Oh.

774
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,309
Uh, uh, uh...

775
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,849
Jane, I want back in at DIA.

776
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,461
I'd ask what changed your mind,

777
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,540
but, uh, it seems fairly obvious.

778
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,750
A dirty bomb does have a
way of clarifying things.

779
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,750
That's irony for you.

780
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:16,574
Okay. I'll run it up the flagpole,

781
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,244
but it should be a formality.

782
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,244
In the meantime, take care of yourself.

783
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,217
- I will.
- Seriously, Dad?

784
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:23,627
- You should be resting.
- Have you met our father?

785
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,389
He doesn't just march to
the beat of his own drummer.

786
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,929
He killed the drummer and smashed his drum.

787
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,179
Did he also kill the doctor
that ordered him to stay in bed?

788
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,050
Okay, okay, enough metaphoric violence.

789
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:35,600
Um, and I'm feeling much
better, thank you for asking.

790
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,640
Oh, good.

791
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,846
Okay, bye. Please rest.

792
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:38,495
Bye.

793
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:39,313
- I will.
- I love you.

794
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:40,473
- You, too. Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

795
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:41,930
Are you going?

796
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,143
- Yeah.
- All right. Bye.

797
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,571
Bye.

798
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:51,074
Did you call Jane Fellows?

799
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,114
I did.

800
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,609
I support your decision.

801
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,237
No, you don't.

802
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,737
Okay.

803
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,737
I'm not gonna divorce you over it.

804
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,987
Well, that's fair enough.

805
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:07,817
Okay, good. Now will you
please get back in bed?

806
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:08,987
Well, that depends.

807
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,508
You gonna come with me?

808
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:14,008
I'll give you five minutes.

809
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:21,987
You okay for tonight?

810
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:23,907
You know what? I think I'm okay.

811
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,447
Oh. Good.

812
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,277
That is, until the next
national existential crisis.

813
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:29,383
You know?

814
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:36,172
I'd like the secretary's
remarks for the NCTC by noon.

815
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,582
On it.

816
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:38,935
Satellites confirm

817
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,974
the target was completely destroyed.

818
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,144
But new SIGINT indicates

819
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:46,474
that Jibral Disah was not
present at the compound.

820
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,857
- You're sure?
- His phone

821
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:50,894
pinged from as-Sultan,
about 60 klicks away.

822
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:53,064
Obviously our recon team was mistaken about

823
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,314
the target's identity.

824
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,514
We probably missed the real McCoy

825
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:56,934
by a matter of hours.

826
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:57,983
So for all we know,

827
00:34:57,984 --> 00:34:59,193
he's gone to ground,

828
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:01,853
free to rebuild the organization at will.

829
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:03,483
I made the wrong call.

830
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:06,580
No... sir.

831
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,120
It was worth the shot.

832
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:12,395
We eliminated key members
of the organization.

833
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:13,592
The secretary is right.

834
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,631
We, uh... we did real damage.

835
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:18,631
Then again, that wasn't our mission.

836
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,221
Mr. President,

837
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:23,051
I'd like to offer my resignation.

838
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:24,591
Ephraim, what...

839
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:25,552
what are you doing?

840
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:26,931
The right thing. Now that

841
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:29,181
the dust has cleared on the dirty bomb,

842
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:32,571
I have to take responsibility
for the botched raid at Moldova,

843
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:34,700
and the failure to track

844
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,370
the uranium used in the bomb.

845
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:37,443
I'm the director

846
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:38,983
of national intelligence.

847
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:40,603
The buck stops with me.

848
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:43,653
No. This wasn't on you, Ephraim.

849
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:45,483
Not by a long shot.

850
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:47,044
I won't accept.

851
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,233
Sir.

852
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,460
But rest assured, heads will roll.

853
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:54,988
We need to make changes, and fast.

854
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,318
Something our proud bureaucracy

855
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,618
isn't exactly known for.

856
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,618
Sir, if I may.

857
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,198
If we're going to prevent future attacks,

858
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,260
I suggest creating a special working group.

859
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:10,173
- How special are we talking?
- I mean,

860
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:12,500
an elite group with executive powers.

861
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:15,323
- The tip of the spear.
- You're describing

862
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:17,271
the National Security Council.

863
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:19,350
No, the opposite, actually.

864
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,470
We need to bypass the mandarins

865
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,150
and find people who are willing
to challenge the status quo.

866
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:26,269
Hizb Al-Shahid is

867
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,598
unlike any terrorist group we've ever seen.

868
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,848
If we're gonna stop them,

869
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,518
we have to think outside the box.

870
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,398
I'll take it under advisement.

871
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,058
For the moment, let's adjourn.

872
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:39,638
I have victims

873
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,518
I have to go see.

874
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,789
Dennis, why don't you hang back?

875
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,369
Mate in three.

876
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,478
No, no. No, I...

877
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,728
I can... Oh.

878
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,268
Busted.

879
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:05,237
- So much for superpowers.
- Hey, watch it. I could

880
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:07,858
still have death rays.
Well played, Padawan.

881
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:11,784
I'm afraid your request has been denied.

882
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,154
What? Why?

883
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:14,734
No idea.

884
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:18,234
But word is that Director
Ellerman just got fired.

885
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,444
SecDef might be next, and the
bleeding doesn't stop there.

886
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:23,194
The whole IC is in turmoil.

887
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,574
That doesn't explain the decision.

888
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,824
Look, I'm sorry, Henry.

889
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:28,694
I wish I had an answer for you.

890
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:40,524
Did you block me at DIA?

891
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,715
Excuse me?

892
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:42,904
I was rejected.

893
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:44,784
Somebody had their finger on the scale.

894
00:37:44,785 --> 00:37:48,984
Well, I-I didn't have
my finger on any scale.

895
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,694
Yeah, but you weren't exactly
thrilled about me rejoining.

896
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:53,154
Did you say anything to
Ephraim Ware or Russell?

897
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,324
Are you actually accusing me here?

898
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:57,024
Look, maybe you just
complained about me rejoining,

899
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,444
and they took it from there.

900
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,694
I don't complain about you, Henry.

901
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,574
Not anywhere. Not at work.

902
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:03,324
And I'm starting to feel attacked.

903
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,614
Well, I'm feeling played,
because it makes no sense.

904
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:07,965
I'm on your side. I...

905
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,024
Good.

906
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:12,784
Then call the president
and ask him to reinstate me.

907
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:13,944
Uh...

908
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:19,045
Hello.

909
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,444
Okay.

910
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:26,074
Well, you can ask him yourself.

911
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,074
That was the White House.

912
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,784
Conrad's on his way over here.

913
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:32,835
Now?

914
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:35,484
Hi, Conrad.

915
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,654
Henry. Good to see you back on your feet.

916
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,091
Good to be back on my feet. Hey, Russell.

917
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:40,281
Can I get you a drink?

918
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:41,470
No, I'm good, thanks.

919
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,630
I will get out of your hair.

920
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,840
No.

921
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,723
- Stay.
- Uh...

922
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,010
Oh, God.

923
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,745
Jason! Socks!

924
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,118
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

925
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,546
Sorry.

926
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:59,386
So, I, uh, heard you're
interested in rejoining DIA.

927
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,655
Yeah, that's right.

928
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,825
But, apparently, the feeling wasn't mutual.

929
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:06,785
They were just acting on my orders.

930
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:07,633
I see.

931
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,078
Because your wife told
me something this morning

932
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,865
that stuck with me.

933
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,865
I'm starting a working group,

934
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:17,285
and making Russell its point man.

935
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,575
I want the circle to be tight

936
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:23,495
and close, and I want you to be on it.

937
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,495
I'll check in from time to time,

938
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,245
but for the most part, it'll be autonomous.

939
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:29,785
What? Uh, uh, uh, wait.

940
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,825
I'm playing catch-up here. What is this?

941
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:34,155
It's a special working group,

942
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:36,075
tasked with tracking Hizb Al-Shahid,

943
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:38,865
in particular its leader, Jibral Disah.

944
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,245
With the ultimate goal

945
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,756
of eradicating both.

946
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:45,905
Okay.

947
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:47,905
Okay. Why me?

948
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:50,354
Because you have experience,

949
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:53,042
an impartial point of view,

950
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:56,810
and, frankly, because I trust you.

951
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,494
And given what we're up against,

952
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:03,629
your religious expertise
should be invaluable.

953
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,408
My background is really more Medieval.

954
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,778
So is our enemy.

955
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:10,578
As far as we're concerned,
your fitness for this assignment

956
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,538
is unmatched.

957
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:15,719
And State will be fully read in.

958
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:20,078
Which means that I'll be...

959
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,578
We can actually...

960
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:22,701
- Talk.
- ...talk to each other.

961
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:24,318
With luck, we should be able

962
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,738
to cut through any intelligence
community disconnects

963
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:28,618
and bring Jibral Disah

964
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,238
to justice, swiftly.

965
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,118
So, Henry, what do you say?

966
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,948
You up for helping to capture

967
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,969
the most wanted terrorist on the planet?

968
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:41,548
Yeah. I'm in.

969
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:50,444
