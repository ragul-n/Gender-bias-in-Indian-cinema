R9- POLICE STATION

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,520
O Lord Muruga!

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,390
Come out. Go there.

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,220
Go.

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,790
Hey you... come out.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,560
You go.

36
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,870
Sit... I say sit.

37
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,210
Whenever a new S.I. comes to this station,

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,410
they take our men into custody.

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,220
They beat our men black & blue.

40
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,470
Get up.

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,080
Sir, I'm innocent.
I'm a cart puller.

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,020
Please leave me.

43
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,450
I'm innocent. Please leave me.

44
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,790
It's your husband's cry I believe.

45
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,530
Oh no!

46
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,560
They are killing my husband.

47
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,330
Please don't beat him.

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,550
Hey... come here. - No sir, please.

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,330
Please don't beat my son.
Leave him.

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,900
Sir, please don't beat me.

51
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,270
Please don't beat my son.
Leave him.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,830
What's it?

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,010
Tender Coconut!

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,370
I've piles.

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,380
I'll be here after you beat me.

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,050
Drinking it will reduce heat.

57
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,080
Give that to me.
Get him another one.

58
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,520
Give it.

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,420
I've mixed liquor in it.

60
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,660
You won't feel the pain. Drink it.

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>What's that noise?</i>

62
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll kill if you shout.

63
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,730
Next is E.

64
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,270
E...? Who is that?

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm E.

66
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,370
He is a criminal.

67
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,740
He is in our records.

68
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,240
He stole jewels from the dead body
after Tsunami struck.

69
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,940
He cut a woman's nose
for the nose pin.

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,220
He'll soon become a big goon
if we spare him now.

71
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,250
Why are you in shorts?

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,580
I'm not wearing an underwear.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,220
Take him.

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,410
Go. I will come.

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,620
I bought you tea yesterday.

76
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,160
This is thanks from me.

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,630
<i>They must be beating E now.</i>
<i>Where is his grandmother?</i>

78
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,540
Police are beating my grandson.

79
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,800
Go. Just for a while.

80
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,240
Please leave him. You tell him.

81
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,890
<i>Chennai city was once a beautiful city.</i>

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,550
<i>We bathed in Coovum river</i>
<i>and washed our clothes in Adyar river.</i>

83
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,730
<i>We used to sail boats</i>
<i>in the Buckingham Canal.</i>

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,260
<i>That is past.</i>

85
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,580
Why is he giving it to her!

86
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,280
What's your name? - Nellai Mani.

87
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,580
His name is E, my grandson.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,980
E...?

89
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,290
You can go next.

90
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,290
I've come to meet the doctor
to get him a job.

91
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,590
I'm not feeling well.

92
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,490
Shall I go if you don't mind?
- Okay go.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,530
Come my son.

94
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,260
Some coffee for you.
- No. Thank you doctor.

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,560
When are you leaving for America?

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,430
17th or 18th.

97
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,440
You are a god, doctor.

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't think he will reform so easily.

99
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,140
He quarrels, fights, drinks & dances
on the streets. I can't control him.

100
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,040
Give him some job and
make him a responsible man.

101
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,380
Can't you see the top level crime branch
officer sitting opposite to you?

102
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,350
Greetings.
- Didn't Know.

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,720
It's you police who beat my grandson.

104
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,380
Keep quiet.

105
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,490
He has no qualification.

106
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,290
What job can I give him?

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,100
There is a temporary mosquito
sprayers job in the corporation.

108
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,240
Will you do it?

109
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,370
Okay doctor.

110
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,900
Don't kill all the mosquitoes.

111
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,170
Mosquito repellents will not
sell in the market.

112
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,310
Nellai Mani

113
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,680
Nellai Mani...?

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,130
Protect me from Nellai Mani.

115
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,490
He is out there to kill me.

116
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,500
In private run Engineering,
medical & arts colleges...

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,910
Tea for me. - One for me too.

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,070
2 teas.

119
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:17,680
Supreme court has ordered that reservations
can't be forced on private colleges.

120
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,090
Can't a supreme court's judgement changed?

121
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,290
Actually, supreme court passes
judgements based on the law books.

122
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,660
But we people can even change the law.

123
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>That's democracy.</i>

124
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,340
This is the statue of a freedom fighter.

125
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,920
This is Singaravelan Nagar, right? - Yes.

126
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,180
Where is E's house?

127
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,090
I'll show you, come.

128
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,920
Put that in my account.

129
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,790
Get in.

130
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,630
Greetings. - Greetings.

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,240
Go straight.

132
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,800
Go...

133
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,710
Why do you want to go to E's house?

134
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,110
We are from Bombay.
And we are not going to E's house.

135
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,370
We have newly shifted to the
house opposite to E's house.

136
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,070
To Munuswamy's house? - Yes.

137
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Who is E?

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,290
I heard he is big criminal.

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,710
And he can never be trusted.

140
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,050
I heard that he will steal ear rings
of small children.

141
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,580
Is it true? Do you know him?

142
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,860
Yes, people used to say that.

143
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,660
Hey Tony...

144
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,470
Bogi festival is over.
Are you going to loot them, ah?

145
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,160
Yes...

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,270
Stop... - Stop.

147
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,970
That is Munuswamy's house

148
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,770
And that is E's house.

149
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,740
Help them.
They are our new neighbours.

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,910
First take small items.

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,210
Be careful.

152
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,680
Careful with the plastic jug? Take this.

153
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,090
<i>Jyothi, bring the...</i>

154
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,630
<i>Just a minute.</i>

155
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,260
Careful boys.

156
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,030
Inshah Allah!

157
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,340
Aren't you Muslim?

158
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,370
No. My sister-in-law & my mother
are Muslim. Not me.

159
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,210
Confusing.

160
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,540
You will know us once you
make friendship with us.

161
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,050
You are helping us. Who are you?

162
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,050
I'm this area's social service
secretary & he is the chairman.

163
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,620
Greetings.

164
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,360
Give it to me. Is there anything
for us to steal? - Let's see.

165
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,030
What shall we do now?

166
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,520
Excuse me.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,970
I have to pay Rs. 2000 as advance
to the house owner.

168
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,340
Do you know any pawn broker
to mortgage it?

169
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,760
That's not a big deal.

170
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,570
I know every pawn broker in this area.

171
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Almost all items are in the
pawn broker's shop.

172
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,010
Get moving, I will be back soon.

173
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,980
E... - Come let's go.

174
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,580
Just 5 minutes,
I will be back in 5 minutes.

175
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,420
Why is he running so fast?

176
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,420
He took my chain and ran away.
Who is he?

177
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,690
Don't you know? He is E.
- E?

178
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,390
If I had told you before,
he would hit me in my house.

179
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,260
I thought of telling you after he leaves,
but he ran away with the chain.

180
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,660
Give me my money.
I have to leave.

181
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,570
Ganesa, this is the chain.

182
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,130
<i>This is the photo copy of the chain.</i>

183
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,650
This is made in Bombay.
How did you get it?

184
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,840
Didn't I tell you? He is very clever.

185
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,920
He is brilliant.

186
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,580
What matter

187
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,350
Just made another copy of it.

188
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,110
That's all, ah?

189
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,380
Just like this.

190
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,650
I will make a better one than this.

191
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,290
I said just like this.

192
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,420
Leave this to me.

193
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,760
Come when my brother is not here.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
He is my first enemy to come up in life.

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,630
Do this first.

196
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,130
And your future will be very bright.

197
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,700
I must put up a shop just like this
in the opposite street.

198
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,840
Follow our foot steps.
Start a jewellery super store here.

199
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,600
When should I come?

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,510
I will make it soon.
- Give that to me.

201
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,680
Take care of the photocopy.

202
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,870
Make it look just like this.
Come, let's go.

203
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,350
He will meet a dusty death.

204
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,010
You should have been careful.

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,660
Poor girl. You got cheated.

206
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,230
What happened?

207
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,090
You warned me several times.
But I didn't know that he was E.

208
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,860
I got cheated.

209
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,850
I told you several times.

210
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,660
He is a rogue & cheat.

211
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,490
Despite my warnings...

212
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,570
<i>Who is that bad mouthing</i>
<i>my grandson E?</i>

213
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,400
You were careless but now blaming E.

214
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,600
Who is she?

215
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
E's grandmother.
Let that be anyone.

216
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,900
Come with me. Let's lodge a
complaint in the police station.

217
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,810
He was helping us.
So I thought he is a good man.

218
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>Didn't I tell you to call me once</i>
<i>after coming to Chennai?</i>

219
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,380
<i>E is worse criminal than</i>
<i>those in Bombay.</i>

220
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,990
<i>An accused died in the lock up.</i>

221
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,820
<i>And it turned to be a big issue.</i>

222
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,160
S.I. will be very upset.

223
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,820
Sir... - I will tell him that you had called.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,560
What's the matter?

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,530
E took away her 5 sovereign gold chain.

226
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,870
Tell him. - Yes sir.

227
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,840
He sells even a cycle chain.

228
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,030
Now a gold chain?

229
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,440
Write a complaint.

230
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,580
Here it is.

231
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,410
Where would E be now?

232
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,710
If he had sold it,
he would be in the wine shop.

233
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,110
If not, in the pawn broker's shop.

234
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,320
Come.

235
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,580
Sethji...

236
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,790
I didn't know that you would make
money by selling the chain.

237
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,460
So, I stole one of the lamps.

238
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,830
That thought struck me too.

239
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,340
What would they do with a single lamp?

240
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,640
So, I stole that.

241
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,730
Cheers.

242
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,180
We were right.

243
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,010
What will a Muslim do with a lamp?

244
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,980
It must be with the broker.

245
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,950
Are you fine? - Yes.

246
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,360
This is separate. - For sales.

247
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,190
A girl from Bombay has shifted to our place.

248
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,290
She wants Rs. 4000.

249
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,130
Take the interest amount
and give me the money.

250
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,460
She will take it in 4 days.

251
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,790
Give me the money.

252
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,830
How much do you want.
- Rs. 4000.

253
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,030
6 sovereigns of gold.
It would cost you around 20 grand.

254
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,670
He charges high interest.

255
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,980
Sign here.
- Not a big signature.

256
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,540
Three lines & 2 dots.

257
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,550
Take this Rs. 4000. Count it.

258
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,990
The bill please.

259
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,620
This is very important.

260
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,290
Get up & come with me. Just hold on.

261
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Arresting him without a warrant.

262
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,490
Come.

263
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,900
What's happening?

264
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,100
How many times to tell you?

265
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,210
The new S.I. will beat you to death.

266
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,870
Put him in.

267
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,340
Take him too.

268
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm innocent.

269
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,320
He came to pledge it.

270
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,210
Why befriend a criminal? Get in.

271
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,980
You know me very well.

272
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,180
You take him in the jeep.

273
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,550
I will come on the scooter.

274
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,920
Will you come? - Yes sir.

275
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,420
I will buy a tender coconut
and come with him.

276
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,930
Come to the station. S.I. will give
you a big tender coconut.

277
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,120
Sir, tea.
- Sir, E.

278
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,970
Sit down.

279
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,330
Sir.

280
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,140
They are killing me.

281
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,020
Give me a tea. - Take it.

282
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,030
Let's tell them about the lamp too.

283
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,320
I'm very scared.

284
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,160
We even don't know
why they brought us here.

285
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,000
What's the case?

286
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,280
He stole a chain from a girl & was caught
red handed while pledging it.

287
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,770
Where is the girl?

288
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,680
Come inside.

289
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,950
Sunita, come with me.

290
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,610
Come.
Tell me what had happened.

291
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,120
We have shifted from Bombay recently.

292
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,260
I asked him to mortgage
a 5 sovereign gold chain.

293
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,830
He took it but never came back.

294
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,150
Sir, yes I took chain from her.

295
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,170
To help her, I mortgaged it for
Rs. 4000 with a pawn broker.

296
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,370
I have the bill.

297
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,600
Head constable has the money.

298
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,730
And the pawn broker has the chain.

299
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,770
Ask him if you want to.

300
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,740
Lamps aren't there in the case.

301
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,170
Where is the pawn broker?

302
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,910
It's me.

303
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,980
Is he telling the truth?

304
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,680
Yes, E is telling the truth.

305
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,150
You beat me believing them.

306
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,880
First put them in jail for
lodging a false complaint.

307
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,680
I heard that you buy stolen products.

308
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,990
No sir.

309
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,190
If I catch you, I will rip your skin apart.

310
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,860
No sir.

311
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,130
Go.

312
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,360
Under IPC, 100 criminals can escape from law.

313
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,340
But an innocent should not get punished.

314
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,330
You know, don't you?

315
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
You beat us without knowing the truth.

316
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,140
Did he smile now?

317
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,970
Who knows?

318
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,940
You cheat! Come outside.

319
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,490
Get money from the head constable.

320
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,150
My stomach is upset.

321
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,730
You go. I have to go to the toilet.

322
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,260
E... - Why are you calling him?

323
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,520
You keep quiet. I have to talk to him.

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
Get me a cup of tea.
- I'll serve tea only if you pay.

325
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,190
I will make you run nude.

326
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,130
Sorry, I committed a grave mistake.

327
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,630
It is common.

328
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,070
Why do people talk bad about you?

329
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,570
Why don't you take up some job?

330
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,040
I've got a job in the corporation.
Spraying mosquito fumigation.

331
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,010
Jobs have no respect.

332
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,310
What are you doing?

333
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,020
I work as a dancer in a hotel.

334
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,050
This is my hotel visiting card.

335
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
Mention my name & come at anytime you like.

336
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,920
Is this any Udupi hotel?

337
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,420
No. A star hotel.

338
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,320
On me...

339
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,100
On me...

340
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Move...

341
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,410
Atlast, you have a job.

342
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,610
You call this a job?

343
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,430
I've lot more to do.

344
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,670
Move...

345
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,450
E, what's all this?

346
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,510
Just like that.

347
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,710
Let's go & have some tea.

348
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,680
Come, let's go.

349
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,420
Look after this.

350
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,180
Buy me 2 idlis.

351
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,350
I don't have money. Manage it yourself.

352
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,890
S.I. is not a strict man.

353
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,030
Just trying to show off.

354
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,160
He wanted to be posted
to a different division.

355
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,970
But was posted to this area.

356
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,130
Bribes in this area is meager.

357
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,530
So, he wanted me to talk to you.

358
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,800
What should I do now?

359
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,130
Sell drugs, make spurious liquor
or even run a brothel.

360
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,300
Pay bribe to the station.

361
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,540
Get 2 cases every month.

362
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,870
Send your friend Tony to the court.

363
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,180
Why are you giving me small ideas?

364
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,350
Don't tell me anything where
I will be under police watch.

365
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,020
Tell me something where I will
have control over the police.

366
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,430
Hey E, come here.

367
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,060
Please get that ready.
I will give you a share.

368
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,360
E, you break sugarcane
in different styles.

369
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,800
Show these girls how you do it.

370
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,380
<i>I'm fire spitting lava...</i>

371
00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:00,490
<i>I'm mercury nobody can catch...</i>

372
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,230
<i>I'm flying train...</i>

373
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,430
<i>Half of my life is spent in jail...</i>

374
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,900
<i>I'll risk my life to achieve what I want...</i>

375
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,940
<i>I'm not a slave to anyone...</i>

376
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,610
<i>I stand on my own legs...</i>

377
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,780
<i>I'm not a slave to anyone...</i>

378
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,880
<i>I stand on my own legs...</i>

379
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,720
<i>I'm fire spitting lava...</i>

380
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,630
<i>I'm mercury nobody can catch...</i>

381
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,970
<i>Filling ditches we laid new roads...</i>

382
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,710
<i>Cleaned the drains...</i>

383
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,340
<i>There's no one to clean our lives...</i>

384
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,320
<i>There's no one to wash</i>
<i>clean our minds...</i>

385
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,050
<i>Our paths are filled with dangers...</i>

386
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>Our lives are heart wrenching</i>
<i>tales of sorrow,,,</i>

387
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,160
<i>All our difficulties will vanish...</i>

388
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,060
<i>A problem will solve another problem...</i>

389
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,630
<i>We are like cattle in a abbottoir...</i>

390
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,270
<i>We live in dark homes without light...</i>

391
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,180
<i>We have become counterfeit currency...</i>

392
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,150
<i>But still don't know, why?</i>

393
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,040
<i>We don't know how to explain it.</i>

394
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>But still don't know, why?</i>

395
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,330
<i>We don't know how to explain it.</i>

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,900
<i>Tomatoes... we are golden tomatoes...</i>

397
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,570
<i>Give money listening to</i>
<i>the young boys' song...</i>

398
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,740
<i>Tomatoes... we are your tomatoes...</i>

399
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,640
<i>We are tomatoes without</i>
<i>a roof of our own...</i>

400
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,990
<i>Violence is part of our life...</i>

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,960
<i>We took to this way to</i>
<i>satiate our hunger...</i>

402
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,430
<i>We lost opportunities in ignorance...</i>

403
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,400
<i>We earned the title of Wastrel...</i>

404
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,930
<i>Let's resolve to change our fates...</i>

405
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,940
<i>When a beauty is here,</i>
<i>let's join for a jig with her...</i>

406
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,250
<i>Everything is okay,</i>
<i>lose yourself in intoxication...</i>

407
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,410
<i>Every woman I see is a Venus...</i>

408
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,250
<i>Unlimited fun... Enjoy it...</i>

409
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,990
A rare opportunity to the residents
of Singaravelar Nagar!

410
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,890
Friend of poor, Enemy of disease,

411
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,060
World famous Dr. Ramakrishna is
organising a free medical camp.

412
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,030
Good news to the poor!

413
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,360
Good news to the labour class!

414
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,500
Hydrocele! Piles! Stomach Ulcers!

415
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,310
Jaundice! or period problems...

416
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,640
Mike isn't working properly.

417
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
<i>Skin allergies or diseases!</i>

418
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,410
<i>Get checked and treated freely.</i>

419
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,450
He'll complete 5 years on December 5.

420
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,250
Have you given him all the
preventive injections? - Twice.

421
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,920
Tell me.

422
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,060
Anajalai, age 16... - Hey! 61.

423
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,520
61 years, No. 33, 2nd cross...
keep it there. Is it chocolate?

424
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,500
You may get dysentery.

425
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,940
As you wanted an eight year old girl,

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
and an old person above 60 years of age,

427
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,140
we have found two candidates
who are totally ignorant.

428
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,300
One is Ayesha and another
candidate is this old woman.

429
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,940
<i>You know she's E's grandmother.</i>

430
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,280
They are best specimens
for your research.

431
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,580
Nobody to inquire about them.

432
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,650
There's only one man known as E.

433
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,290
He'll also not inquire much.

434
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,290
<i>743!</i>

435
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,490
<i>My biggest order till date</i>
<i>from foreign country.</i>

436
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,330
<i>The new medicine I've made</i>
<i>from a banned formula.</i>

437
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,770
<i>That will damage your immune system,</i>
<i>helps the growth of virus,</i>

438
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,410
<i>It will directly attack the heart</i>
<i>resulting in instant death.</i>

439
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,110
<i>We can wipe out an entire nation</i>
<i>spreading it through mosquitoes.</i>

440
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,850
This is the injection you've to inject
to Ayesha and E's grandma.

441
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Okay Doctor.

442
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,880
Go there.

443
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,950
Nurse, take this.

444
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:49,260
Carefully... nothing, it's a powerful
injection, so it'll be painful.

445
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:13,580
Ayesha dear, don't be scared.
I'm here. Okay... okay.

446
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,350
Have you given them the injection shots?
- Yes doctor.

447
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,290
Maintain the two patients' records secretly.

448
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,560
Their visits to the hospital,
their health complaints,

449
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,890
headache, giddiness, vomiting,
record all their complaints.

450
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
Complete blood check up,
urine condition,

451
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,400
everything must be documented
and sent to my computer.

452
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,480
This is Rs. 20 billions research project.

453
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,310
They mustn't know it.
You must know it.

454
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,040
How doctor?

455
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,210
New types of diseases are
spreading all over the world,

456
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,920
there are many diseases which
haven't yet been identified,

457
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,560
not only to the patients, there are many
viruses unknown to doctors also.

458
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
Why we die? What for we die?

459
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,420
Nobody knows it.

460
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,660
We are using the permission granted to us
for finding new medicines like this.

461
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,570
If there's a new disease out break,

462
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,240
how to find a medicine to it?

463
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,110
Finding the disease and the virus,

464
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,870
rat, dog, cat, pigs are given
a dose of the virus,

465
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,180
after initial success,
it is tried on monkeys,

466
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,880
Who after monkeys?

467
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,560
Humans!

468
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,780
Which type of humans?

469
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,050
People of poor nations all over the world,

470
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,360
more so it is tested on illiterate,
ignorant people living in slums.

471
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,090
Only after that medicine,
production and marketing.

472
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,630
Do you know medical business is
the most profitable business?

473
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,700
For using humans as research guinea pigs,

474
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,100
for the foreigners,

475
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,580
our country is the best place.

476
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,750
That's why I got this order.

477
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,150
Nobody knows about this?

478
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,780
Nobody.

479
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,520
If anyone explains it to our people,
they will stone him to death.

480
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,320
They will think he's narrating a tale.

481
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,330
They don't know even about
politics beyond this area.

482
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,620
They are still simians.

483
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,930
There's nothing wrong in using them
as guinea pigs after simians.

484
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,570
Good nail polish.

485
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,610
It's not scent, it's just water,
keep it there.

486
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,710
How much?
- Would you like to have a vada?

487
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,220
Looks very hot.

488
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,520
Hold it.

489
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,280
Pay money and take vada.
- I'll beat you.

490
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,750
Keep the vada there, this is first sale.

491
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,550
I'll beat you.

492
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,950
Okay, you go home,
I'll come in the evening.

493
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,190
Give me a packet of beedis
and a match box.

494
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,460
No credit.

495
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,700
What? Give man.

496
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,270
You already owe Rs. 2.

497
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,900
Rs. 2? Throw it.

498
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,370
E, don't break the bottles.
You're doing too much.

499
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,470
How long you have been
running this shop here?

500
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,170
Don't you trust me for just Rs. 2?

501
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,180
Two shampoo sachets
and a tea packet.

502
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,010
Give him whatever he asks & take
money from me. -Thank you madam.

503
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,490
Give her what she asks and my order too.

504
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,050
You trust her who's new to this area,

505
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,120
I sleep here only,
I'll break open your shop tonight.

506
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,730
You'll never trust a good man.

507
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,260
What? - 'Beeda' Ravi's car is here.

508
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,400
Sit in, boss wants to see you.

509
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,040
Greetings boss.

510
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,470
E, have you ever been to General Hospital?

511
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,940
Do you know the mortuary there?

512
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,920
Asking me if I know?
I had been there many times.

513
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,420
Okay, now you do one thing...
please sit.

514
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,650
Go there straight.

515
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,550
Thulakkanam will be waiting there for you.

516
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,590
Got me?

517
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,020
Have you informed him?
- I've informed him.

518
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,260
If you meet him, he would've
arranged everything, got me?

519
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,400
go to unclaimed bodies' section in
morgue and bring two male bodies.

520
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,870
Thulakkanam will take care of the rest.

521
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,170
Take Rs. 2000 now, after the job is done
he'll pay you Rs. 10000. Give him.

522
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,210
Is it true? You want dead bodies?
Why do you need them?

523
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,790
Shut up, we are rogues.

524
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,620
It's a job for Dr. Ramakrishna.
Do it without inquiries.

525
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,920
No boss, you're giving me little jobs,

526
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,150
if you give me more serious
jobs like cutting limbs

527
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,390
I'll grow, won't I?

528
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,130
Who is worse than me here?

529
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,970
If any problem arises, I don't mind
going to jail for a year or two.

530
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,440
I'll tell you if it comes,
you finish this first.

531
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,010
I'll always be in this area only.

532
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,070
Or else I'll be sleeping near
the Chettiar's shop.

533
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,810
24 hours service, will you?

534
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,610
lyer, give me Rs. 300.

535
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,850
Stay here, they will return the body
after post mortem in an hour.

536
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,480
Come E, I was waiting for you.
- Shall we go?

537
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,590
Why the body is lying here?

538
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,960
Bodies lie like this only here.

539
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,220
Famous people's bodies were lying here only.

540
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,400
Silk's body was lying here.

541
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,120
Simran's sister Monal's body
was lying there. Here only.

542
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,000
Be careful, very risky job,

543
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,730
bring the body out,
I'll manage after that. - Okay.

544
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,470
Look there, that's mortuary.

545
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,710
Where's the head? - It's here.

546
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,950
Two or three people have
hacked him mercilessly.

547
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,120
Don't close your nose,
we may get caught.

548
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,360
How can?

549
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,820
How we play with lives?

550
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,330
Look at the condition after death.

551
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,730
That's why I don't have any regrets.

552
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,730
Enjoy life as you wish before you die.

553
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,060
You'll never calm down.

554
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,010
This is the place for unclaimed bodies.

555
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,080
I'll stay out, you go in I'm scared.

556
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,890
Living people are very dangerous,
you can be afraid of them,

557
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,390
dead are like gods.

558
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,290
You are right.

559
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,910
It's our Thirunavukkarasu!

560
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,480
Nobody knows about his death.

561
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,110
He asked for two idlies before dying,
I didn't have money.

562
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,690
Leg is shaking.

563
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,720
Get down!

564
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,650
Leave me! - Doctor run away.

565
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,050
Open the door!

566
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Beat him.

567
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,540
Thank you very much.

568
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,080
Please come with me. Come.

569
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,280
You saved my life,
I don't know how to thank you.

570
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,460
No... no need doctor.
- Please accept it.

571
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,030
No doctor. - Take it.

572
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,940
No doctor, if I wear it, police will thrash
me for robbing someone.

573
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,010
If you pay the value in cash,
it will be very helpful.

574
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,280
Okay, give it to me.

575
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,110
E, you've committed a mistake.

576
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,740
You've handed him over to police.

577
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,650
If you'd killed him,
I would've paid millions to you.

578
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,620
What are you saying Doctor?

579
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,530
You should've killed him.

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,160
That's our fortress.

581
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,170
If I hadn't saved Doctor,
he would be dead by now.

582
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,010
I think there's something really
fishy behind that doctor.

583
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,710
This is the right place.

584
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,890
Nellai Mani will be produced
in Court tomorrow at 11 am.

585
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,190
We'll kidnap him and
come straight here...

586
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,420
Move... just pigeons.

587
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,760
We can keep a watch on him
from down if we tie him here.

588
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,060
He can't escape from here.

589
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,300
He'll be within the eyesight.

590
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,270
If you'd killed him,
we wouldn't be facing this trouble.

591
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,170
We would've got millions
from the doctor.

592
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,330
That's where you make the mistake.

593
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,500
If I had killed him,

594
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,080
Doctor would've settled it with
few thousands of rupees...

595
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,320
We can kidnap him from the court
and bargain with the doctor.

596
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,440
We can get a better price.
- You're great.

597
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,010
Whatever is happening,
is happening for good.

598
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,420
Whose vehicle you've booked?

599
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,990
Our Qadir's.
He's coming with a Maruthi van.

600
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,490
He's very loyal,
we don't have any other choice.

601
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,620
Is my plan okay? - It's okay.

602
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,600
Anyway two constables will
accompany him to the court.

603
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,870
One of them is Selvam.
He's a sissy.

604
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,240
You take him out for a tea.
I'll manage the other guy.

605
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,470
Be careful, we have only one plan.

606
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,940
If we manage to pull it off,
we'll hit the jackpot.

607
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,650
Be ready, I'll come with Nellai Mani.

608
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,200
Qadir is ready.

609
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,360
Just two gates, we must take him
out from the second gate.

610
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,100
There are lot of police here.
Looks he's a big shot.

611
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,610
Accused is very dangerous man, be careful.

612
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,680
What's all this? Is Sankaracharya coming
to the court today?

613
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,450
Get the accused out.

614
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,660
Why are you masking my face?

615
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,060
Police say you're a terrorist.

616
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,900
Why are you killing doctors only?

617
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,400
Please ask one after the other.

618
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Any enmity between you
and Dr. Ramakrishna?

619
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,710
Please ask questions after he comes
out of the court. - Move... move...

620
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,400
You beat me, right?
I may not come out.

621
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,980
But you'll come in, I'll see you then.

622
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,250
Police Quarters, Chennai.

623
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,590
Quick.

624
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,150
What are you looking at?

625
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,390
Remove the good bulb and
replace with a fused bulb.

626
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,960
Crime rate has gone up,
it's robberies everywhere.

627
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,800
Only police quarters is safe.
Not a thief can enter this place.

628
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,940
You removed good bulbs and
replaced with fused ones, right?

629
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,140
Yes, I've changed,
keep the good bulbs separately.

630
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,300
Move the ladder.

631
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,780
Police is weak unlike the Military.

632
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,050
I was suggesting this for
long time to earn money.

633
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,180
But you were planning something else.

634
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,750
Did you see him in the court?
That doctor is dead.

635
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,430
Shut up and push the ladder.

636
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,230
If we had kidnapped him as we planned,

637
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,800
would we be doing this job now?

638
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,460
Just Rs.6000?

639
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,660
He said Rs.250 for a bulb but
gave only Rs. 150.

640
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,570
What can I do?

641
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,300
What happened to the Bombay
girl's chain matter?

642
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,770
After bulbs, next is Bombay girl's chain,

643
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,270
that's why I'm changing my dress.

644
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,010
I'll act like a good boy and trap that girl.

645
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,900
<i>Hello.</i>

646
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,670
<i>Love is an art...</i>

647
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,870
<i>Caress me...</i>

00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,870

<i>Youth blooms & begins to bear...</i>

650
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,120
<i>Love is what world needs...</i>

651
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,210
<i>Love is an art...</i>

652
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,410
<i>Caress me...</i>

653
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,080
<i>... and let lust flood us...</i>

654
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,040
<i>Unsaid words carry respect...</i>

655
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,550
<i>Untouched sensuous part remains hot...</i>

656
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,420
<i>Search makes life interesting...</i>

657
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,060
<i>Victory comes to the daring only...</i>

658
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,560
<i>Once man overtakes love & lust...</i>

659
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,670
<i>he is just a living corpse...</i>

660
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,870
<i>and this he knows by experience...</i>

661
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,910
<i>Love is an art...</i>

662
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,080
<i>Caress me...</i>

663
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,620
<i>... and let lust flood us...</i>

664
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,360
<i>If I had been in the temple...</i>

665
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,270
<i>I would've been worshiped...</i>

666
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,800
<i>But I'm lost in the streets of men...</i>

667
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,880
<i>Caress me all day...</i>

668
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,880
<i>Get yourself drowned in liquor...</i>

669
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,380
<i>I'm the dress made by Cupid, adore me...</i>

670
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,190
<i>The more you eat the more hungry you are...</i>

671
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,890
<i>It'll be interesting to the last drop...</i>

672
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,300
<i>I'll bloom if you water me...</i>

673
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,400
<i>And my love never changes colours...</i>

674
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,270
<i>Come & conquer me...</i>

675
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,770
<i>Hello!</i>

676
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,330
Sit.

677
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,280
Oh God!

678
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,610
Looks like a saloon.

679
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,890
<i>Would you like to eat biriyani?</i>

680
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,320
Chicken or mutton?

681
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,230
Just anything.

682
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,540
Why did you allow him into our room?

683
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,070
He is a fraud.

684
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,860
Be careful. He might steal
your fake jewels too.

685
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,040
Shut up.

686
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,400
Why talk unnecessarily?

687
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,680
What's the collection today?
- Today's collection is very less.

688
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,000
Rs. 15000 in total.

689
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,350
Deducting charges of room boy, orchestra
and my share, your share is Rs. 4500.

690
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,050
Take this Rs. 4000 and
get my gold chain back.

691
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,890
Such guys will be good
for a couple of times.

692
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,220
After that, they will cheat you.

693
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,730
She herself is a garbage.

694
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,090
And now she is complaining about me.

695
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,830
Who did you call as garbage?

696
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,800
I'll return the money tomorrow which
you gave me yesterday.

697
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,600
Did I ask you?

698
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,230
Give it tomorrow.
- Okay.

699
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,600
What is he saying?

700
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,870
He must be mesmerized by our dance.

701
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,150
What if he watches the special dance?

702
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,070
This food is not enough.

703
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,870
<i>Asha, are you coming or not?</i>

704
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,050
Vichu is going on shouting.
Okay bye.

705
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,050
Bye E.

706
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:52,980
Get lost.

707
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,620
Leg piece!

708
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,540
What?

709
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,430
Asha was talking about some
special dance, right?

710
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,770
Is it dancing with very little clothes on?

711
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,370
Very very little.

712
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,510
Topless...?
- Very very little.

713
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,450
Nude...?!

714
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,690
Don't shout. Yes, it is.

715
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,930
So, that's what you call special dance, ah?

716
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,390
Won't you perform that special dance?

717
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,060
Shit!

718
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,430
I don't have to earn a living like that.

719
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,300
Rascal.

720
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,500
I will tell you something.
Don't mistake me please.

721
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,730
If you perform special dance,
the states will dance to your steps.

722
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,540
The other day, you saw what happened.

723
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,610
Good deeds are not recognized.

724
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,170
First I must return this chain to her.

725
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,120
Take it.

726
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,750
You will be surprised.
Match it with the original.

727
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,580
They look alike.

728
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,450
Yes.

729
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,020
I can't differentiate the original
from the duplicate.

730
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,420
Give one chain to me.
- Which one?

731
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,560
Any one chain.
- Take it.

732
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,260
Who is the scapegoat?

733
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,230
The pawn broker or that girl?

734
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,960
I haven't decided yet.

735
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,070
So, this must be the original.

736
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,510
Even he can't differentiate the
original from the duplicate.

737
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,370
How will you find it?

738
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,940
I can smell the real gold standing
from a distance. - I know that.

739
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,540
I've decided who the scapegoat is.

740
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,050
Take care of the chain.
I will be back.

741
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,250
Stop.

742
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,090
What is it E? - Hi Peter.

743
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,790
Why did you stop it?

744
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,520
You can't go straight.
They have dug a pit hole.

745
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,690
Turn left. Where are you heading to?
- To Adyar.

746
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,070
I'll get down on the way. Turn right.

747
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,540
I was coming to see you, Jyothi.

748
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,730
I've taken the chain back.

749
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,810
Take it & be careful.

750
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,900
Thank you very much.

751
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,070
Stop here.

752
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,280
I saw E stealing them.

753
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,280
I can say this in any court.

754
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,480
What are you doing, Jyothi?

755
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,500
What are you doing?

756
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,580
Leave my hand.

757
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,720
Sit. - Go fast.

758
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,100
Go...

759
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,320
What are you driving?

760
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,000
Who gave you the license?
- E, please leave me.

761
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,100
Stop it. Listen to me.

762
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,300
Turn left.

763
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,130
There will be police.
- I can handle the traffic police.

764
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,530
Stop it.

765
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,670
E is here, sir.

766
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,370
Catch hold of him.

767
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,140
What happened?

768
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,580
How dare you steal the government bulbs?
- Beat him.

769
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,640
He got into our auto without
our permission.

770
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,020
He beat someone. Beat him.

771
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,080
Are you a big shot?

772
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:40,980
Remove his shirt & tie his hands.

773
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,100
Where is the slate?
- Lift your hands.

774
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,030
Sir...

775
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,960
Hereafter, I won't steal bulbs"
write this on the slate.

776
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,730
Don't write. - You shut up.

777
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,160
This is not fair.

778
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,230
I say don't write.
- Hang that on him.

779
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,840
This is not fair, sir.

780
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,340
<i>Welcome to the central jail...</i>

781
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,550
<i>Welcome to the central jail...</i>

782
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,650
<i>With a traitor right next to me...</i>

783
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,790
<i>I've been to jail & felt bad too...</i>

784
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,720
<i>I've been to jail & felt bad too...</i>

785
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,400
<i>Welcome to the central jail...</i>

786
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,140
Why are you silent?

787
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,460
We didn't hand him over to the police.

788
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,140
He stole the government property
in broad daylight.

789
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,110
I have doubt on your chain too.

790
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,910
What? - I have a doubt.

791
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,510
What doubt?

792
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,450
It might be fake.

793
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,880
Can't you think positively?

794
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,010
Can't you think negatively?

795
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,520
I know him very well.

796
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,380
I'm sure that this must be fake.

797
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,190
Shall we check that?

798
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,630
This is made of pure 24 ct. gold.

799
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,350
Sometimes, even original will
look like duplicate.

800
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,810
Don't get confused. Take it.

801
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,810
Hey Jyothi...

802
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,760
Asha, I'm going to get him out on bail.

803
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,860
Don't get cheated because of this incident.

804
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,060
Whatever it is, he is good to me.

805
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,160
I like him.

806
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,690
Infact, I love him.

807
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,390
How is ice cream?
- Buying me an ice cream...?

808
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,330
E, please accept the charges.

809
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,670
If you don't, the magistrate will
prolong the case.

810
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,780
I live in Ambattur.

811
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,350
I have to come all the way from there.

812
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:38,570
We will see.

813
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,340
You could have booked me
under some other section.

814
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,210
I see only my men in police station
and in the court.

815
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,250
Saints come here very rarely.

816
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,380
Only a few are caught.
Others are out there.

817
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,360
We'll see later.
Ask the Commissioner to wait.

818
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,620
How come you are here?

819
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,420
What's your crime?

820
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,620
Forget about me.

821
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,560
Why are you here?

822
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,700
Those girls were caught
under brothel case.

823
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,770
There is no one to get them on on bail.

824
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,870
I'll get them out on bail.

825
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,870
Select the good looking ones and
involve them in prostitution.

826
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,110
If I don't get girls, I come to the court.

827
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,480
He knows that.

828
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,250
Only in our state, prostitution is an offense.

829
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,350
But there is no law in Calcutta & Bombay.

830
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,990
No law under Indian Penal Code.

831
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,420
<i>Even beautiful girls come to court.</i>

832
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,250
<i>But I need to be patient.</i>

833
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,120
So, beautiful girls also come here.
- Yes.

834
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,490
What are you doing here?

835
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,160
I'm here to get you out on bail.

836
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,990
It costs lot. Got money with you?

837
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,830
Yes I have.

838
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,130
The chic looks great.

839
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,100
Just for one night.

840
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,740
We can finish the deal.

841
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,300
Take it.

842
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,210
Magistrate has come.
You come fast.

843
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,870
You go. I'll be there soon.

844
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,480
Magistrate has come.

845
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,780
My case will be heard first.

846
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,480
Okay. - I want to meet you.

847
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,910
You will be in the market in
the evening, right?

848
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,560
Yes. - I will see you there.

849
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,750
Bye. - Bye.

850
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,860
Move.

851
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,800
You be here.
I'll meet the advocate & come.

852
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,420
Hasn't my grandma come?

853
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,730
She is not feeling well.

854
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,830
I'll come for you.

855
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,260
But don't drag me to court often.

856
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,340
Hungry dog dug the garbage.

857
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,640
Drive properly.

858
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,310
Tony, let's fool the pawn broker.

859
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,880
So, this is the duplicate one. - Yes. come.

860
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,990
I need Rs. 3000.

861
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,720
Not for me. For her.

862
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,250
She came & asked me.
I didn't want to come to you for this.

863
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,050
Because police caught me for this chain.

864
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,660
Even I mistook you on that day.

865
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,360
Now I'm ready to give you Rs. 3000
without pawning any jewel.

866
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,870
Repay it later with interest.

867
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,640
Because I want to help the one
who wants to reform.

868
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,400
No. I don't want.

869
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,100
What do you say?
- You are right.

870
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,670
You're of my father's age.

871
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,040
Who knows you might even be my father?

872
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,850
To Mount Road...?

873
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,290
Check properly. Rub & see.

874
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,180
Leave it.

875
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,630
I treat you as my son.

876
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,060
Here is Rs. 3000.

877
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,350
Okay. Thank you very much.

878
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,520
You're the first man to pawn
a duplicate chain.

879
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,220
It's raining & it is good
for my business.

880
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:28,990
Yes.

881
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:34,030
Get a strong tea for me.

882
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,630
Go I say. Stop staring at me.

883
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,470
Don't ditch me.

884
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,770
Listen to me.

885
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,100
It is for your good only.

886
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,800
The girl who came to the court, who is she?

887
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,810
Leave my hand. - It's okay.

888
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,500
Leave my hand.

889
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,470
You know that I'll do anything for money.

890
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,040
She is so beautiful that
VIP's will fall at her feet.

891
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,280
You can earn around
Rs.40000 to 50000 a day.

892
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,790
Calculate the earnings
for a month & a year.

893
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,430
You will get 20% more.

894
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,760
You can settle in your life.

895
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,560
I'm trying to be good to her
to get money when I need.

896
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,730
This idea might backfire on me.

897
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,600
Give him tea.

898
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,770
Why don't you ask her?

899
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,470
Ask her once. Don't feel shy.

900
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,570
Let's see what will happen.

901
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:37,950
Hello!

902
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:39,920
What?

903
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,890
I'm here to talk about our future plans.

904
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,350
Tell me what is it.

905
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,830
What's so hurry!

906
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,560
You wear this too. - Give that to me.

907
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,230
Let me wear this for a couple of days.

908
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,730
It looks good. - Asha might come.

909
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,040
Careful. - What are you doing?

910
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,610
Don't beat me.

911
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,070
Give it back. - Stop.

912
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,450
You are very beautiful.

913
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,350
You mesmerise me.

914
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,750
You sing & dance in the bar.

915
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,220
Hasn't any broker approached you till now?

916
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,420
They must have.

917
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,480
Many approached me.

918
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,350
What did you say?

919
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,330
I beat them with slippers.

920
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:26,440
What?

921
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,470
I've just one pair of slippers.

922
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,300
Just listen to what I say.

923
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,710
You came to court to get me
out on bail, didn't you?

924
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,750
A broker approached me.

925
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,080
He said that you are very beautiful and
was ready to pay Rs. 20000 a day.

926
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:48,580
You calculate it for a month & a year. Think.

927
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,450
Money makes life beautiful.

928
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,520
Come down.

929
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,430
Is becoming my pimp your future plan?

930
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,460
Wait, I'll come.

931
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,570
If I was born beautiful like you,

932
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,770
I would've bargained for Rs. 40000.

933
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,240
What to do, I was born as male
and became stale.

934
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,700
Look.

935
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,410
Making money by selling your body is not life.

936
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:15,250
Living for the one you love is life.

937
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,950
That's true love.

938
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,290
I love you. Only you.

939
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,990
This body is for you only.

940
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,930
So, true love is sharing your body
and soul with the one you love.

941
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,530
So, this body is mine for free, right?

942
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,600
I will beat you.

943
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:38,400
Free...? I'll beat you.

944
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,940
Get lost.

945
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,050
Are you going to get back
the duplicate chain?

946
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,780
You won't get more than Rs. 300.

947
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,920
What do you want me to do?
- Are you mad?

948
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,990
Just watch the show.

949
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,290
Greetings! - Please sit.

950
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,530
Take Rs. 3000.- Here it is.

951
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,440
It doesn't look like mine.

952
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,310
What are you saying? It is yours.

953
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,710
Are you drunk?

954
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,610
If I'm drunk, I can find it without
even touching the chain.

955
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,280
Tony, I think he is trying to cheat me.
Check it.

956
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,260
Yes, it is duplicate.

957
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,120
Are you playing with me?

958
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,520
Give it to me. - Give it. Rub & see.

959
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,960
Check properly.

960
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,190
How did this happen?

961
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,500
Rub properly.

962
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,910
Didn't I warn you that he is a cheat?

963
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,170
This is not okay.

964
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,110
Tony, come out.

965
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,080
He is trying to cheat us.

966
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,120
Who was with us that day?

967
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,640
Yes. Qadir was with us.

968
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,220
Qadir come here. - Don't call him.

969
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:49,910
Leave my hand.

970
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,310
What's the problem?

971
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,480
We mortgaged the chain for
Rs. 3000, didn't we?

972
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,490
He is trying to cheat us by giving
a duplicate chain. - Is it?

973
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,960
Trying to cheat us?
- No I won't.

974
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,220
Talk in Tamil.
- No, I will never do that.

975
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,860
How dare he cheats us also?

976
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,270
I thought you have reformed.
So, I paid you money without checking it.

977
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,340
It's the receipt given by him.

978
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,710
It clearly states the value of the jewel.

979
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,770
You will get caught if I go to court.

980
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,910
Take 2 photocopies of it.

981
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,580
No E. I will give you
a couple of thousands.

982
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,980
Couple of thousands for a jewel
which values around Rs. 20000.

983
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,550
If I take the money you are offering me,

984
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,600
what would the public think of me.

985
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,780
They will think that I'm a fraud.

986
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,890
I thought you will be good to me.

987
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,120
Asking me my one year's earning.

988
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,800
Stop talking. Call the police. - No.

989
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,870
I must lodge a complaint to the police.

990
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:35,870
What did the S.I. say on that day.

991
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,340
He said he will rip you apart
if he gets any complaint on you.

992
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,410
Will you give me money only
if he rips your skin apart?

993
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,470
Yes he will. - You keep quiet.

994
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,040
Tell me here itself.

995
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,770
I want to talk to you in person. - For what?

996
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,850
How could you do this to me?

997
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,750
And the receipt? - Shall I give it to him?

998
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,650
Poor guy! Give it.

999
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,050
What are you looking at!

1000
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,790
He is helping the poor by
offering low interest rates.

1001
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,360
Sell idly. Ply auto.
Work hard & earn. Just like me.

1002
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,000
Now do you believe in God.
- Yes I do.

1003
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,570
Bye. You are a big cheat.

1004
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,980
<i>Let's commit a mistake once...</i>

1005
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:37,430

1010
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,310

<i>Lead a life by wrong doings...</i>

1016
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:46,440
<i>Try to come out of your wrongs...</i>

1017
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,140
<i>Love is a hymn...</i>
<i>It imparts knowledge...</i>

1018
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,940
<i>A boat can't sail without water...</i>

1019
00:57:53,950 --> 00:58:01,250
<i>For the mistakes committed...</i>
<i>Love came into existence...</i>

1020
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:08,390

Ayesha... - My dear...

1043
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,660
Take her to the hospital.

1044
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,500
Catch an auto.

1045
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,330
Oh my God! What happened to my daughter?

1046
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,500
Sister, see what's wrong with her.

1047
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,100
Don't worry.

1048
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,540
Fast.

1049
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,780
Move aside. Open the two door.

1050
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,190
I'll take care.

1051
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,360
Hello doctor.

1052
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,490
Ayesha of Singaravelar Nagar under our
treatment has got admitted in our hospital.

1053
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,470
Very good.

1054
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,030
When? - Just 10 minutes back.

1055
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,100
Who is near you?

1056
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,770
Her entire family.

1057
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,340
E brought her to the hospital.
I'll give it to E.

1058
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,400
Hello doctor...

1059
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,480
E, I will tell her to give the treatment.

1060
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,980
Ask them not to worry.

1061
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,820
How is your grandmother?
- She is fine.

1062
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,120
Give the phone to her.

1063
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,450
Hold on.

1064
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:47,520
Hello.

1065
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,750
Don't give any medicines.

1066
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,320
Check her pulse rate.
I will be there in an hour.

1067
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,790
Sign here.

1068
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,700
Here too.

1069
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,510
Lilly, give her 10 ml injection.

1070
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,070
Increase the dose by 3ml every 30 minutes.

1071
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,170
First, fits will stop.
Allow them inside.

1072
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,780
Tell them that she is ill with
some known disease.

1073
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,510
Send all the reports to my project centre.

1074
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,640
Okay doctor.

1075
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,520
Will she survive, doctor?

1076
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,020
How can she?

1077
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,780
Very difficult.

1078
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,560
Whatever it is my research
is a grand success.

1079
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,530
How could you do all this as a doctor?

1080
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,930
Did I ever claim myself as doctor?

1081
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,700
My profession isn't Doctor,

1082
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,380
it is International Business
making billions of profit.

1083
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,310
What if the patient's relatives
come to know the truth?

1084
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,810
What? This thing!

1085
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,480
Do you know how many researches
have been conducted in India?

1086
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,720
Even educated are ignorant.

1087
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,910
How can these filthy illiterates know it?

1088
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,290
without the knowledge
of my senior doctor.

1089
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,130
I've sent healthy people to research
centres as heart patients,

1090
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,100
You know that?

1091
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:40,360
I've used good healthy people
as guinea pigs for research.

1092
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:45,230
In 1994 Dr. Bhattacharya of Mumbai,

1093
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,940
promising to find a cure to AIDS,

1094
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:54,280
he was injecting virus extracted
from a dog to 9 boys and a girl.

1095
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:59,630
They weren't cured of AIDS
but a boy died.

1096
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,100
Court, Police or Law couldn't take
any action on Dr. Bhattacharya.

1097
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,020
Because it's a research.

1098
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,760
Is medical business so profitable?

1099
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,100
This isn't medical business,

1100
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:11,900
this is weapons business.

1101
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,540
Earlier people died fighting
each other with swords.

1102
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:21,200
In WW1 people died in
hordes for the bullets.

1103
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,880
By WW2 atom bombs were developed,
and people died in millions.

1104
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:29,050
The next war will be fought
with biological weapons.

1105
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,550
It's a Bio war.

1106
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,920
Who is it? Nurse?

1107
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:38,690
You look like Jyothika.

1108
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,900
Why are you giving a shot
of injection every month,

1109
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,870
give her three shots at a time,

1110
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,870
Shut up.
- Grandma.

1111
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,170
Give me Rs. 50.

1112
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,360
What is this?

1113
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,220
Research.

1114
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,270
All over the world this medicine,

1115
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,800
even in developed countries,

1116
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,690
after testing it on animals,

1117
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:20,930
have warned not to test it on humans.

1118
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,270
But still you've tested it on a child,

1119
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:24,810
that too giving her a heavy dose.

1120
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,110
Better know this first.

1121
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,680
Doctor is a profession.

1122
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,180
Pharmaceuticals is a business.

1123
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,650
Doctor is unlike all other professions.

1124
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,190
People consider them as Gods
not as businessmen.

1125
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,290
Shouldn't you be humane?

1126
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:40,000
For the billions of dollars
offered by foreign clients,

1127
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,890
without the knowledge
of Indian Government,

1128
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,460
without the knowledge of people,

1129
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,960
you're doing research on poor people.

1130
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,370
Educated and rich people
will inquire everything.

1131
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,400
But these slum people
are blissfully ignorant.

1132
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,240
Are they so ignorant?

1133
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:58,840
When hundreds of Black African people
were used for Syphilis research,

1134
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,870
many died in the process,

1135
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,790
US President Bill Clinton in 1997,

1136
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,320
openly asked an apology for the excesses
on behalf of the Government.

1137
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:08,220
You know it, right?

1138
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,960
In Britain insecticides were
made as tablets,

1139
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,930
paid 500 dollars to every student in
Manchester University for taking it,

1140
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,960
and used them for a research.

1141
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,500
I too know all this.

1142
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,370
You needn't get scared.

1143
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,680
I'm doing all this taking necessary
approvals from the patients.

1144
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:34,080
There are just guidelines,
nothing to prosecute legally.

1145
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,420
People will come to know it.

1146
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,520
Even after 100 years
they will not know it.

1147
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,820
I'll also not be alive then.

1148
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,330
If people come to know
you'll not be alive.

1149
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,240
You're interfering often in my job.

1150
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,400
All over the world I've money power,
muscle power,

1151
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:59,840
political support,
underworld connections.

1152
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:06,450
But you've only a wife, three kids,
and an old father.

1153
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,410
That's all I've to say.

1154
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,990
Let this be the last time.

1155
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:10,890
I've lot of work.

1156
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,460
Now give her the last shot.

1157
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:20,990
Even adults can't take it anymore.
- Try it.

1158
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,640
According to my calculations,
the child will struggle for 10 minutes.

1159
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,000
Blood infusion start again,
and then it will stop.

1160
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,220
Follow it correctly. What's this?

1161
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,460
Leave my shirt. Look at her.
Leave him.

1162
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,240
Please keep quiet.

1163
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,340
Sorry sir... uneducated poor people.

1164
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,920
They are emotional people,
please don't take it seriously.

1165
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,110
No problem, atleast you know it.
- Come.

1166
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,250
You take care of them.

1167
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,940
You're not eating properly
since the death of Ayesha.

1168
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:07,710
Hey stop... stop.

1169
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,570
Kanniyappa, start the vehicle.

1170
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,780
Sit here.

1171
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,480
Sit carefully.

1172
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:15,580
Carefully.

1173
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:21,090
Take me to Ramakrishna hospital,
only he can save me from death.

1174
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,290
Even if you die, will I arrange
your funeral cheaply?

1175
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,400
Won't I spend money lavishly
to conduct it like a festival?

1176
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,260
I'll dance in your funeral procession.

1177
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,200
E, don't buy local brew for her death.

1178
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,640
I want a full bottle of good brand.

1179
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,470
Even if I die, take my body in
Kanniyappa's tricycle only.

1180
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,170
Okay, you go now.
- He may die before you.

1181
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,640
You take good care of my grandson.

1182
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,520
E, don't drink and roam.

1183
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,550
As if you're leaving
wealth behind for me.

1184
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,780
I'm bothered about food
after you go to hospital.

1185
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,990
Stop the tricycle.

1186
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,840
Grandma, you carry on,
I'll come back in 5 minutes.

1187
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,470
Kanniyappa, look after her.

1188
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,430
You come.

1189
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,610
Come... come.

1190
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,540
Go... go to hospital,
I'll join you there.

1191
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,210
You carry on granny,
I'll come to hospital in 5 minutes.

1192
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,020
Greetings boss. Are you fine boss?

1193
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,490
I'm fine.
- What's their problem?

1194
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,920
Tell him.

1195
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,920
We are third year students
of Medical college. - Is it?

1196
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,030
Students? How is it?

1197
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,220
You look like MGR is film Idhayakani.

1198
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,100
<i>Then?</i>

1199
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,490
My friend loves a girl.

1200
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,220
Is it?

1201
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,670
After going steady with me,
she ditched me for a rich boy.

1202
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm also getting angry.

1203
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,730
This is concentrated sulphuric acid.

1204
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,310
Skin will burn on touch.

1205
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,480
Pride of her beauty is making
her behave like that.

1206
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,780
Her face must turn ugly.

1207
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,080
Nobody should see her face again.

1208
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,320
You must throw it on her face.

1209
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,820
Did you love her or was it him?
You're getting excited.

1210
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,320
She's Divya, you can find all her
details behind the photo.

1211
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,620
Divya will be in Chemistry lab
at 10 am tomorrow.

1212
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,730
We'll be outside.

1213
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,390
You throw it on her.

1214
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,370
Look how powerful the
educated people's idea is.

1215
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,200
Get the details about
rate and availability.

1216
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,830
Bye, boss.

1217
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,970
Rs. 8000, balance on
completion of the job.

1218
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:14,510
Okay boss.
- Will you do it?

1219
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,740
It's very easy boss.

1220
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:17,640
They have given such a small bottle.

1221
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,150
This will burn her face totally.

1222
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,650
Didn't you go to hospital with granny?

1223
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,650
This is acid, keep it safely.

1224
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,550
Make a drink.

1225
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,120
I don't know if there's stock here.
We have.

1226
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,560
Take... take it. Keep it separately.

1227
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,560
You need money for granny's
hospital expenses, right?

1228
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,330
No need, E.

1229
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,060
Don't throw acid on the girl's
face as the boy said.

1230
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,830
Think about her life.

1231
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,400
What will life become
with a disfigured face?

1232
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,880
I don't care about anybody,
I need money.

1233
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,010
You're helpless without money,
you know it.

1234
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,170
Please listen to me.

1235
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,850
Love is divine.

1236
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,550
Falling in love, swearing to live
without each other,

1237
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,820
committing suicide on failure,

1238
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,890
I stay away from such madness.

1239
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,730
Love is pure and true.

1240
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,960
You'll fall only once in love.

1241
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,260
How can you understand it?

1242
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,660
Wastrels like you can't understand it.

1243
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:11,400
You may feel great for going out
with any woman you like,

1244
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,130
only dogs behave like that.

1245
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:17,540
Oh No! Didn't I tell you not to
entertain such girls?

1246
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,110
When?

1247
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,910
Whenever we are on threshold of success,
they will spoil it with advice.

1248
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,310
An old woman is there...
she sings Tamil songs also...

1249
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,050
K B Sundarambal too played her role.

1250
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,450
That's Avvaiyar.

1251
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,180
Avvaiyar!

1252
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,720
Avvaiyar is here. - Is it her?

1253
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,520
Take it. - Acting smart.

1254
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:41,130
Why are you silently watching
her for throwing money?

1255
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,860
We are struggling to earn
this money only.

1256
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,430
Do you know the value of money?

1257
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,610
How can you know it?

1258
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,680
You're a cheap woman dancing in bars
picking up the money thrown at you.

1259
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,410
What? What did you call me?

1260
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,480
Am I cheap woman?

1261
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,210
You're a pimp who tried to sell me.

1262
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,940
Bloody girl... l'll punch you.

1263
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:00,020
Go away or else I'll throw the
acid on your face.

1264
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,590
You can't dance to show
your voluptuous body.

1265
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,160
Go.

1266
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,890
I'll go but if you throw acid
on the girl's face,

1267
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,960
you'll get ruined.

1268
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,690
Go. - I'll see how you'll do it.

1269
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,370
If you stay here I'll kill you.

1270
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:14,270
I'll go but you'll come
after me like a dog.

1271
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,270
Go... why will I after you if I've money.

1272
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:20,360
Are you a beauty? A bevy of beauties will
flutter around me like butterflies.

1273
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:21,370
What's this? - Make a drink.

1274
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,950
You look like a college student.

1275
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,450
It's the age to be in college.

1276
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,850
But God didn't give you the opportunity.

1277
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:30,750
Is this also God's work?

1278
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:31,480
What else then?

1279
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,040
Okay, be careful.

1280
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,320
Don't open your mouth,
they will find you're from slum.

1281
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:39,920
Is everything ready?

1282
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,060
Go straight and take left.

1283
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,790
Okay.

1284
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,960
Aren't you Divya? - Yes.

1285
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,850
Aren't you Parthiban's lover? - Yes.

1286
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,930
But you're going with some one else now,
are you a call girl?

1287
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:13,400
Love is pure and divine.

1288
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,400
It comes only once, street girls like
you can't understand it.

1289
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,630
You may consider it great to go out
with anyone you like,

1290
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,700
only bitches do like that.

1291
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:24,840
What happened Divya?
Look... open your eyes.

1292
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,070
It's just plain water,
nothing has happened to you.

1293
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:27,870
Open your eyes.

1294
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,280
He's not a student.
He's from a slum.

1295
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,110
Catch him... catch him...

1296
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,150
Hold me tightly brother...

1297
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,620
Save my life brother...

1298
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,320
Come up...

1299
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:14,300
Save me at any cost.

1300
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,390
Tell me... yes.

1301
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,130
Keep all records ready. - Morning sir.

1302
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,530
Get all the records about Nellai Mani.

1303
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,100
Doctor... doctor. - Yes.

1304
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,780
Good morning.

1305
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,940
Why are you afraid on seeing Police?

1306
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:11,600
What happened?

1307
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,280
I think Nellai Mani has escaped
from the police encounter.

1308
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,520
Two armed guards at the entrance.
- Okay sir.

1309
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,650
Looks like he'll not let you off
the hook so easily.

1310
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,060
What are you saying?

1311
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,520
Who is it?

1312
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,260
Excuse me... sorry madam.

1313
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,670
Set up a road block at the entrance.

1314
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,970
If you want extra police,
apply for armed forces. - Yes sir.

1315
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,870
Doctor, your home looks very rich.

1316
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,610
Didn't you kill him in the encounter?

1317
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,110
We tried but failed.

1318
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:47,350
How can a force that works for money
can catch a man driven by aim?

1319
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:48,250
That means...?

1320
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,550
What's there on that side?

1321
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,680
Garden... entertainment hall...
bar... swimming pool.

1322
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,430
Minister sent me here once for
his son's medical admission.

1323
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,500
That's why...

1324
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:05,490
One guard here & keep the door closed.
- Yes sir.

1325
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,730
Issue me a license for gun,

1326
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,870
I'll hit the bullseye defending
my life than the police.

1327
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:15,280
All don't work for money, doctor.

1328
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,580
Nellai Mani has killed seven people.

1329
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,150
All were very famous doctors or scientists.

1330
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,390
Who else is on his hit list?
Why is he doing it?

1331
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,520
There should be a reason...

1332
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,650
This looks like a diabolical plan...
I want Nellai Mani alive.

1333
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:34,060
I'm telling you also,
I want Nellai Mani alive.

1334
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,460
If a need arises,
I'll talk to the higher officials. - Okay sir.

1335
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,870
Smile man.

1336
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,130
Is it Nurse Lilly?

1337
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,010
Go... go... go carefully.

1338
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:03,530
Stop... stop... if there's any drain near,
push it through it.

1339
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:04,900
Why friend?

1340
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:08,760
Police dogs can't follow
smell beyond water.

1341
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:09,770
Go quickly.

1342
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,670
<i>Who is it?</i>

1343
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,140
Head constable. - Check who is it?

1344
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:19,770
Yes sir.

1345
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,240
Police? - Yes...

1346
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,880
Hey. - Sir.

1347
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,080
Throw this in the dust bin.

1348
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,990
Don't get afraid.

1349
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:40,730
Who is it? You!

1350
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,860
Why are you taking the dust bin at night?

1351
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:47,030
Didn't I tell you about doctor finding
a job for me in the corporation?

1352
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:47,940
That's why I'm taking it.

1353
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,510
Don't throw it, brother.

1354
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,580
Beer bottle will fetch Rs.2.

1355
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,480
Who is it? - Sir it's me E.

1356
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,050
Sir, received a message
from the control room.

1357
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,780
About Nellai Mani... they want you
immediately in Commissioner's office.

1358
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,850
You come man. - E, do your work.

1359
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,690
<i>E, you carry on with your work.</i>

1360
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,520
I'll see you in station tomorrow sir.

1361
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,910
Tony... Tony... - What?

1362
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,810
Wash your face and come to
the our fortress.

1363
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,210
No time to sleep, come quickly.

1364
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,120
Just hold it for few moments friend.

1365
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,480
Nobody comes here, police too don't
know about this place.

1366
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:38,950
You don't worry.
This is my place.

1367
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,360
If it's very painful
I'll get you a rum bottle.

1368
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,500
If you drink and sleep,
you'll not feel the pain.

1369
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,630
I don't want.

1370
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,210
I'll stay in this corner.

1371
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:08,290
I can keep a watch on the
movements down there.

1372
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,260
I think this place was chosen for me.

1373
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,730
No... we hide here when
police turn heat on us.

1374
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:17,700
Is it?

1375
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,670
Come friend... sit here.

1376
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,380
Be careful.

1377
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,340
Lie on this.

1378
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:35,650
I've lost blood in the gun shots,

1379
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,120
You struck with a baton
it hasn't healed yet.

1380
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,750
I don't know how long I can survive.

1381
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:44,200
Will you help me? - Tell me friend.

1382
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,130
I'll write few medicines,
can you get them? - Yes.

1383
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,940
Go stealthily, police also shouldn't doubt you.

1384
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,940
Wipe out the blood stains on the steps.

1385
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,080
With these medicines, get a bottle
of O positive blood from the blood bank

1386
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,540
I don't have money, manage and buy it.

1387
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:08,050
If I live I'll settle...

1388
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,220
What's this friend? You saved my life.

1389
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,220
I'll give my life for you.

1390
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:14,550
I'll go friend.

1391
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,360
E... give me that pipe.

1392
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,000
Come... come.

1393
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,980
That day we planned and
missed in the court...

1394
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,110
Nellai Mani?

1395
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:39,250
I've kidnapped him.

1396
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,850
How? It's impossible.

1397
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:44,820
I didn't try, he came to me after getting
hurt in a police encounter.

1398
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:46,820
You say no God, do you believe now?

1399
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,500
Okay... God is there.

1400
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,060
Take care of him.
Nobody should know it. Okay?

1401
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,970
I don't have any money with me now.
- Why?

1402
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,270
I must buy medicines, blood.

1403
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,240
Looks like he's going to die.

1404
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,240
If he dies, we can't get a penny
from that doctor.

1405
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,070
He must be alive till then.

1406
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,250
We must kill him only after getting
money from the doctor.

1407
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,880
If you need money, ask Jyothi.

1408
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,680
What for you've a lover
if not to help in crisis?

1409
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:10,850
Correct.

1410
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,020
You keep vigil all night staying awake.

1411
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,320
If you need buy tea in a flask.

1412
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:14,950
Okay. - Okay?

1413
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,130
Hide that dust bin.

1414
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:20,630
Steps have blood stains.
Wipe it clean. Okay?

1415
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,580
Madam... madam... Jyothi.

1416
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,040
What? - Isn't Jyothi at home?

1417
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:38,910
She's there.

1418
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,750
Please forgive me madam.
- Why did you open door at night?

1419
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,380
He always cooks up new tales everyday.

1420
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:46,360
Why did you come inside? Go out.

1421
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,030
No... poor boy.

1422
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:50,650
You don't know who is he.

1423
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,830
You replaced acid with water
and prevented it anyway.

1424
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,330
Please forget it. - Get out.

1425
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,960
I need urgently Rs.3000... very urgent.

1426
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,300
Granny is not well,
I've to buy medicines. Trust me.

1427
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:05,070
I swear on your mother,
I need Rs.3000 urgently.

1428
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,400
I need to save my granny's life,
please get it from her.

1429
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,040
Please tell her.

1430
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:12,350
There's money in a box in the kitchen,
bring Rs.3000 from it.

1431
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,550
It's in the henna box, right?

1432
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,530
Yes, bring it quickly.

1433
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,820
True... I need it urgently...
won't you save a life?

1434
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,330
Bring it. - Take it.

1435
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,800
Go... go. - Thank you madam.

1436
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,600
Trust me I'm going to the medical shop.

1437
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:35,240
It's cold out there,
please give me your shawl.

1438
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,510
Bye madam.

1439
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,720
I'll do that but your vest is
full of blood, change it first.

1440
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,400
Okay, I'll change, you be careful here.

1441
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,810
I'm not suppose to give medicines
without prescription.

1442
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:11,040
Hey, I know what you do without
your boss' knowledge...

1443
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:24,020
Come on, did you get all
the medicines? - Yes.

1444
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,930
I didn't have money to buy
these medicines.

1445
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:31,990
My girl friend only helped me.

1446
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,800
First take that injection...

1447
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,200
Not that... take that one...

1448
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,840
Take the ampule cutter.

1449
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,870
Take that opener...

1450
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:49,780
Open it... extract that medicine...

1451
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,850
Fill the medicine.

1452
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,430
Like that.

1453
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,230
Inject it...

1454
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,200
Friend, I don't know...

1455
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,330
Give it to me...

1456
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:17,140
Take that scissor and that knife.

1457
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,520
A bullet brushed my shoulder.

1458
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,710
And a iron shrapnel tore my thigh

1459
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,720
I know... I saw it...

1460
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,120
That's not a problem.
We can put sutures...

1461
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,560
But 2 bullets in my stomach.

1462
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:35,730
Ruptured my intestines.

1463
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:36,460
Oh my God!

1464
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:37,830
Pain is killing me...

1465
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,840
Hope I'll survive with your help.

1466
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,810
Wipe that blood...

1467
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,790
Stitch... put sutures to the open cut...

1468
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:01,360
What friend? Is this a cloth to stitch?

1469
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,220
Give it to me.

1470
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,410
Why are you doing I without
taking anesthesia?

1471
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,380
It's been a long time
since I lost my sleep.

1472
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,480
Even anesthetics will not help,
I won't get sleep...

1473
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,450
Hang the saline and
blood bottles over there.

1474
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,630
Even police is after me...

1475
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,870
But why such a huge police force is after you?

1476
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:56,660
We both are booked under
different crime sections.

1477
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,330
Only local police is after you.
But International police is after me!

1478
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,410
Police will always be after someone...

1479
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:05,540
It went after Gandhiji,
Nethaji, Bhagat Singh...

1480
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,780
Now, they're after us!

1481
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,010
Friend, how come you're so cool?

1482
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,420
It's simple because I'm a Villager.

1483
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,120
I'll have more resisting power than you.

1484
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:16,280
Friend, are you a doctor?

1485
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,690
I discontinued my medicine.

1486
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,520
Why did you fire at that doctor?

1487
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:29,240
Political groups are barrels of the gun.

1488
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,910
Why did you want to shed blood for that?

1489
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:34,140
Politics is a war without shedding blood.

1490
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:37,140
War is politics with blood shed.

1491
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,680
I didn't get you!

1492
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,410
Struggle in life...
then you will understand.

1493
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,720
I wished to become a doctor.

1494
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:46,620
Take care, friend.

1495
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:48,850
See you then...

1496
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,240
This is 'E' house.
He is in Jyothi's house.

1497
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,640
He eats and sleeps there only.

1498
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,870
E, who are they? - Known people.

1499
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,170
E, how are you?

1500
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,680
Having a grand feast?

1501
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,340
Is she the Mumbai girl?
She looks pretty.

1502
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,580
Why don't you marry her?

1503
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,220
Hey, give me that photo.

1504
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,020
E, I've come with a good offer.

1505
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:20,420
If you do it, not only you,
we will also get a good share.

1506
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,190
Don't lose your power in this area.

1507
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,260
Otherwise you end up a vegetable
seller like your grandma.

1508
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,870
The man in this photo is Nellai Mani.

1509
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,170
He isn't an ordinary man,
an International criminal.

1510
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:40,970
Very good network is there to catch him.
But no use.

1511
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,710
He escaped from the jail
yesterday only.

1512
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,940
No information about his whereabouts.

1513
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:47,780
You should kill him.

1514
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,580
If you finish this job,
we all can settle in our lives.

1515
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,960
Yes, doctor...

1516
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,460
I'm here only...

1517
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,700
E has accepted to do it.

1518
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,490
Okay then...

1519
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,100
See you then...

1520
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:08,070
Give it to me...

1521
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,140
Something is wrong with him...

1522
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:12,570
Keep an eye on him.

1523
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,140
Why do you accept to do such things?

1524
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,220
Hey, I didn't say 'Yes'.

1525
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,450
They came and gave this photo to me...

1526
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:21,780
I stopped taking such jobs
after you advised me.

1527
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:22,690
That's it...

1528
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,080
What is this?
- It seems it's a special camera.

1529
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:26,820
We will get snaps automatically.

1530
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,330
Automatically? - Yes.

1531
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,560
What should I press it?

1532
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,990
Click that red button.

1533
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,030
Don't make noise.
Take a close up shot. - Okay?

1534
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:40,770
Stand here and take a snap of us.

1535
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:43,870
Be careful...

1536
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,250
Friend...

1537
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,880
Get up, my friend...

1538
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:58,560
You're sleeping without having food...

1539
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,630
Shall I get you something?

1540
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:02,800
Get tea and a bun... - Okay.

1541
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:06,970
That's nothing...
it's flash of an airplane...

1542
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:08,800
I'll go and get it, okay?

1543
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:10,540
Go... - Okay

1544
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:16,840
Why did you flash a light?

1545
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:17,740
You said that don't make noise...

1546
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,070
Did you tell me to click
without a flash?

1547
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:24,880
Peter and Durai gangs are searching
for Nellai Mani... E's holding... no way.

1548
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:28,190
Let's go and see S.I. Lakshmipathi.

1549
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,520
Beeda Ravi's gang has started
searching for him...

1550
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,820
We should be alert...

1551
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,570
Hey, be careful...

1552
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,960
I'll take the payment from
doctor and come back.

1553
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:38,970
Don't drink and sleep.

1554
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,110
Doctor, call for you.

1555
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:46,510
Doctor, are you fine?

1556
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:47,240
Who is this?

1557
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,810
Forgotten me so soon?

1558
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,240
It's E!

1559
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,380
Oh no! I didn't forget you...

1560
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,050
Tell the matter... what do you want?

1561
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:54,850
What?

1562
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,020
Nellai Mani who tried to kill you
is now in my custody.

1563
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,490
Really? - Yes.

1564
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:05,060
If you want, I can show you proof.

1565
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,260
Come here immediately.

1566
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:10,030
You know my address, don't you?
Plot No:36, ECR road, Mahabalipuram.

1567
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,670
Protect Nellai Mani.

1568
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,060
I know, doctor.

1569
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:14,670
I'll come there immediately.

1570
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:16,330
Don't worry about money.

1571
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:17,910
Take good care of my grandma.

1572
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,640
Doctor, you're responsible for
my grandma's life.

1573
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,070
<i>And I'm responsible for your life.</i>

1574
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:24,620
Don't inform police or goons.

1575
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,180
Because I'm the police and
also goon to central Chennai.

1576
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:44,260
Hey stop... stop man...

1577
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:49,300
He will come this way only... be alert...
otherwise he will escape...

1578
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:52,540
Hey, he is there... stop...

1579
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,450
Come on...

1580
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:58,980
Nice cap, man...

1581
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:01,010
Sir, I've bought it for Rs.5.- Get inside...

1582
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:01,860
Start the Jeep.

1583
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:06,860
What did the doctor say?

1584
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,260
He asked her to take rest.

1585
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:10,260
Grandma...

1586
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,060
Is it Jyothi? - Yes...

1587
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,970
I've been admitted here.

1588
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:17,770
Don't know what he is doing for his food?

1589
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:19,770
Don't worry about that.

1590
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:20,770
We will take care of it.

1591
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:23,010
He has started eating well than before.

1592
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,240
He hasn't come to see me...

1593
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:27,710
Convey my regards to him.

1594
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,140
Why grandma?

1595
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,610
I gave him money for your medicines.

1596
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:32,450
He should've bought medicines
for you, shouldn't he?

1597
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,520
No.

1598
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,350
Atleast ask him to come
for my funeral.

1599
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:49,730
Sir, this case was filed against
Nellai Mani in 2004.

1600
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,100
Important evidence.
Please note it down.

1601
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:56,840
Where is your S.I.?

1602
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,740
Gone out. He's expected back now.

1603
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:02,380
Sir, we have collected
all the information.

1604
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,890
Full record of Nellai Mani is ready.

1605
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,510
What records?

1606
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,180
Last year 660 times we produced
TADA, POTA detainees in court,

1607
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,090
but not a single accused
escaped from the custody,

1608
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,660
that's the record of
TN Armed Police.

1609
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:15,960
There is no way to escape
from police firing.

1610
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,290
They've shot him 4 times.

1611
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,620
Definitely he would've died.

1612
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:20,590
Most probably, we will find
his body in Cooum.

1613
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:22,660
Sir, let's search for his body in Cooum.

1614
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:26,570
It seems he has escaped to Nepal.

1615
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:30,450
Information has come
from Madhya Pradesh.

1616
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,010
Hey, what are you here for?

1617
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:33,840
What's this, sir?

1618
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:37,250
I was the man who caught and
handed over Nellai Mani to police.

1619
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:38,650
You should've rewarded me for that...

1620
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,720
But you've arrested me?

1621
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:41,450
Sir, leave me now...

1622
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,560
Let police search him all over India.

1623
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,520
And I'll also search for him.

1624
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:46,190
I'll find and bring him here.

1625
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:49,830
Ganesh, there is no chance of Nellai Mani
going out of this city.

1626
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:55,570
I've information that he has hidden in an electrical
box all his equipment in a leather bag.

1627
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:59,140
Search him every nook and
corner with a dog squad.

1628
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:02,700
SP Kumanan of Prohibition Dept.,

1629
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:07,520
his second wife wanted me to
buy a beer bottle, urgent I've to go...

1630
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,510
Hey, sit there... go...

1631
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,280
No sir...

1632
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:15,260
Whether Nellai Mani is a terrorist
or a criminal isn't an issue.

1633
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,160
There is some lurking danger
behind doctor Ramakrishnan.

1634
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:20,690
It will be good if we catch
Nellai Mani alive.

1635
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,270
Why is she calling me?

1636
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,600
For whom you're buying tea?

1637
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:32,610
For me only...

1638
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,040
A watchman's job...

1639
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:37,410
E asked me to buy a tea
to stay awake on duty.

1640
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,140
I was waiting for you
for a long time.

1641
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:39,950
Why? - Take it.

1642
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,610
What's this?

1643
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,860
This a foreign brand.
Good quality.

1644
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:51,330
Got as a gift from bar.
I brought it for you only.

1645
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,600
Let E come...

1646
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:55,600
He will drink this and badmouth me.

1647
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,800
Give it to me... - Okay. You're right...

1648
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:00,400
Where will you go and have this?

1649
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:04,440
There beside an old toilet.

1650
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:05,550
There?

1651
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,850
We have been drinking there
for the past 10 years.

1652
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:08,970
That is our bar.

1653
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,420
Okay. You go there and
start drinking...

1654
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:13,220
I've fried fishes for you.
I'll bring it for you.

1655
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,520
Really? Are you sure?

1656
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:30,240
Jyothi, come...

1657
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:31,970
Good drink!

1658
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,070
I'm getting intoxicated slowly.

1659
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,300
You want to make it fast?

1660
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:37,310
Won't you drink liquor?

1661
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,110
I've stopped it.

1662
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:48,360
E took money from me
to buying medicines.

1663
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:49,760
Didn't he say that it's for his grandma?

1664
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,490
Was it a lie?

1665
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,320
Your money wasn't wasted.

1666
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:54,630
He needs money to buy
medicines for his grandma.

1667
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:57,260
He needs money to marry you.

1668
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:01,730
Jyothi, the words said in Holy Geeta
and in stupor is same.

1669
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:04,070
Lord Krishna only showed the path.

1670
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,400
Lord Krishna gives life.

1671
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:09,970
Lord Krishna kills.

1672
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:16,780
Hey, are you giving making me
drunk to get the truth out?

1673
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:21,520
That's not my job, man.
- Sorry. There is no secret with you...

1674
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:26,460
E has locked a man inside our den.

1675
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,930
He bought medicines for him only.

1676
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:31,160
He has spent lakhs for his treatment.

1677
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:34,230
He can bargain more, only if he is alive.

1678
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,270
Before he dies, we have to
get our settlement.

1679
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,900
And then we should kill him.

1680
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,250
All these days we were
just doing small jobs.

1681
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:42,810
Only now, we have moved a level up.

1682
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,080
Started murders...
he will do it.

1683
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:49,450
You leave this place...
I've to be here to protect him. Go...

1684
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:52,190
Don't get scared.
It is our area!

1685
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:56,830
<i>I swear, I'm a loyal watchman!</i>

1686
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:58,830
<i>Sir, we have found a dead body near Cooum.</i>

1687
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:02,490
<i>We suspect it may be Nellai Mani...</i>

1688
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,050
Get up...

1689
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:56,380
Oh no!

1690
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:01,830
Are you Jyothi? - Yes.

1691
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:03,560
E has told a lot about you.

1692
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:07,470
I'm alive because of your shawl
and medicines.

1693
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,970
Full credit goes to you and E.

1694
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,340
Please escape from here...

1695
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:17,980
No it's impossible.

1696
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,710
If I escape from here,
then Police will catch me.

1697
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,050
Only E's place is secure for me.

1698
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:26,950
No...

1699
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,590
Staying with E is dangerous
than going out...

1700
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,920
Don't trust him.
Okay? He isn't a good person.

1701
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:42,240
Please escape from here...
Please believe me...

1702
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,910
Okay. Can you do me a favour?

1703
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,870
I'll do anything, if you're ready
to escape from here.

1704
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,080
Near Perumbur Mill factory,
there is an old Beedi factory.

1705
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,980
There, if you go to nearby street...

1706
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:56,880
There you can see an electrical box.

1707
01:40:57,150 --> 01:41:00,180
Inside it, there is a brown bag.

1708
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:06,160
I'll escape from here only after
you bring that bag. - Okay.

1709
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,030
Be careful... police may keep
an eye on you...

1710
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,500
Will you leave this place
as soon as I bring it? -Yes.

1711
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,070
Shall I bring something to eat?

1712
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:22,670
It's enough if you bring that bag. - Okay.

1713
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:37,130
Get up... - Did S.I. come?

1714
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:39,260
Come on. Sit...

1715
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:42,820
Hey, tell me... what happened?

1716
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:46,890
It was inside the box only...
Sir, I didn't get you...

1717
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:51,210
Last night, I bought chicken biriyani
to have after drinking liquor.

1718
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,040
By this time, it would've got spoilt.

1719
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:55,940
Hey, stop it... - Okay sir...

1720
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:57,450
I'll not spare you alive...

1721
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:00,520
Sir, I don't know what for you're
investigating me now?!

1722
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,220
Who is it?

1723
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,550
Is S.I. there?
- Who are you?

1724
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,730
Dr. Ramakrishnan speaking...
- Sir, just a minute...

1725
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:08,220
MLA is out of station.

1726
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,200
Sir, Dr. Ramakrishnan is on the line.

1727
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:17,000
I just want to know about
a rowdy of your area.

1728
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,730
Sir, what's his name?
- I don't know his name.

1729
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:23,540
People calls him 'E'.
- Yes. He is here only.

1730
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,170
What for?

1731
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,850
He has thrown acid on a college girl.

1732
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,740
What happened?

1733
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:28,650
Nothing serious, sir...

1734
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:30,080
Give the phone to him...

1735
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,480
Give him...

1736
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:34,850
What happened, E?

1737
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:36,680
Doctor, don't worry.
Nothing serious...

1738
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,760
Give the phone to S.I.

1739
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,820
Doctor, warn him about me...

1740
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:43,500
He wants to talk to you...

1741
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:48,900
Hey, bring E immediately
to my house. - Okay sir.

1742
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:52,200
Take it.

1743
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:54,700
Did anyone notice you? - No.

1744
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,500
I feel fine after seeing this bag.

1745
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:01,140
Now, will you escape from here?

1746
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:04,750
Because every minute here
is dangerous to you.

1747
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,210
My life is full of risks only.

1748
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,050
Don't trust E.
He will kill you...

1749
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:14,190
E can never kill me.
He can't kill me so easily...

1750
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:17,420
A girl can easily reform
any rowdy or criminal.

1751
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:19,460
But I failed in that...

1752
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,090
Wherever I go,
my life is in danger...

1753
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:25,770
I'll be in risk if I escape from here.
If I stay here, E will kill me.

1754
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:29,440
Even if they failed to kill me...
I'll die shortly...

1755
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:31,410
In this situation, where can I go?

1756
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:33,640
Shall I bring the doctor?
- Who?

1757
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:34,970
Doctor Ramakrishnan.

1758
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,510
He is a well known doctor in this area.

1759
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:42,920
He does free service.
He helps the poor willingly.

1760
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,320
Good person. - Really?

1761
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:46,320
Will you bring him here?

1762
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:49,020
I'll bring him now.
I'll come before E returns.

1763
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,260
Bring him here. I'll wait for him.

1764
01:44:59,240 --> 01:44:59,930
Greetings, sir.

1765
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:08,070
Greetings doctor.

1766
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:13,080
You wait outside.
I'll call you later...

1767
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:21,920
Brother, had your food?

1768
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:24,330
Don't make noise...

1769
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:27,630
Sir, I don't think you've rendered
free services for poor.

1770
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,540
Take your seat...

1771
01:45:30,210 --> 01:45:34,940
Didn't you ask me to kill
Nellai Mani for lakhs?

1772
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:37,080
Now let's finalise it.
How much you will pay me?

1773
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:39,440
Nellai Mani is in my custody.

1774
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,680
I'm a straight forward man.

1775
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:45,080
First pay me the advance...

1776
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,420
I'll deliver Nellai Mani's body to you.

1777
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,890
Take this Rs.20000.

1778
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:53,550
I'll settle the balance
only after seeing his body.

1779
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,690
Well said!

1780
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,130
How much you will give me?

1781
01:45:56,230 --> 01:46:00,360
2- 3 lakhs is enough for you
people to settle in life.

1782
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,410
But I'll give you 10 lakhs.

1783
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,640
Take this advance...

1784
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:08,770
Sir, I too wish to have a big house
and police security.

1785
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:10,950
I accept your deal.

1786
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:15,340
Ask your S.I. to drop me...

1787
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:17,150
They always treat me as criminal.

1788
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:20,050
Atleast today let them drop me...
Just to show-off...

1789
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:23,020
Hey Lakshmipathi... - Sir...

1790
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,760
Drop him at his house.

1791
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:32,900
Strange to see him praying.

1792
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,340
Don't know the reason for this.

1793
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,900
Hey...

1794
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:07,910
Hey, are you mad?
Don't shoot me...

1795
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:15,240
E, got scared?

1796
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:16,920
Won't I get scared if you fire at me?

1797
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,040
Why did you doubt me?

1798
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,040
If I want to shoot you.

1799
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:21,520
I would've killed you when
you hit me in the hospital.

1800
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:25,320
Do you know to fire? - No.

1801
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,220
How come you become a rowdy
without knowing to pull trigger?

1802
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,130
It's a modern world...

1803
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:35,430
Why are you still depending
on sickles and knives?

1804
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:37,770
Don't you want to upgrade yourself?

1805
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:39,430
Only after becoming
an international criminal...

1806
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:42,510
You can earn more killing VIP's.

1807
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,580
You need more training...

1808
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,370
Shoot this one...

1809
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,370
Aim here...

1810
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:50,880
Okay leave it... aim me... shoot me...

1811
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,110
Hold it properly... shoot me...

1812
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:00,960
Will I give you a gun with bullets?
Give me the gun...

1813
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:02,830
Give me...

1814
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:06,430
Help me to sit...

1815
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,110
I'll be back now... - Go...

1816
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,150
Where's Tony?

1817
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,250
How did he get a gun?

1818
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:14,400
<i>It's coming... King is coming...</i>
<i>move away...</i>

1819
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:16,570
What man?
- Why are you beating me?

1820
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:19,400
Eating my food and
sleeping in my place...

1821
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:21,740
How much did you get
to reveal the secret?

1822
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,380
You dog, are you cheating me?
- Hey, no...

1823
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,050
He is firing at me...

1824
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:32,850
Who paid you money
to reveal his place?

1825
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:35,420
Tell me... - I didn't reveal anything...

1826
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,830
Your lover Jyothi got me
drunk to information.

1827
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:39,630
If she gives you liquor,
why did you reveal the secret?

1828
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:45,770
Hey, stop... otherwise I'll kill you...

1829
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,970
Hey, stop man...

1830
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:54,450
Did you suspect your friend
and call me a cheat?

1831
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:56,010
From now, you're going to suffer.

1832
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,410
I'll teach you a good lesson.
- Hey, no...

1833
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:00,720
I'll show you my true colour.
- Hey, stop...

1834
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,220
Patient will get scared...
Let them be here...

1835
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:18,700
Give it to me... - Thank you...

1836
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:19,340
Come...

1837
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:25,110
Doctor, why did you come here?
You will die...

1838
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:28,580
Doctor, save me...
- What happened? Tell me...

1839
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:32,210
First leave this place... tell me...
Doctor, please go...

1840
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:34,440
E, tell me...
- I say leave the place...

1841
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:47,390
Shit! You stupid...
I would've died by this time...

1842
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:47,860
Come...

1843
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:50,690
Go... hey, are you playing with me?

1844
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,330
By this time, Nellai Mani would've
shot the doctor...

1845
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:53,770
And I would've been in jail.

1846
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:55,810
If doctor dies, who will pay me?

1847
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,240
All my plans would've collapsed.

1848
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,970
I was growing in my life.

1849
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:05,110
You loved me and spoiled my life.

1850
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,250
Hereafter if you do such things...

1851
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:09,990
What will you do?
What can you do?

1852
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:12,160
You're greedy for money and
not allowing Nellai Mani to get well.

1853
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:15,690
Hey Jyothi, you don't know...
all are bad people.

1854
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:18,420
The one who got injured
is an International fraud.

1855
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:21,160
That doctor is an international criminal.

1856
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:23,740
I'm 100% good,
compared to them.

1857
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,300
Who is good? You?

1858
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,960
The entire town talks bad about you!

1859
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:29,930
Better leave Nellai Mani.
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

1860
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,170
Then I won't bring a doctor here...
I'll bring the police!

1861
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,410
Hey look, I've forgiven you
many a times...

1862
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:37,380
Now I won't spare you.

1863
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:39,550
Hey, are you raising your hand on me?
Will you beat me?

1864
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:41,120
Will you? Beat me...

1865
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,020
Will you?

1866
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:47,320
I've been watching you for a long time...

1867
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:49,390
You're shouting like a street girl.

1868
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:53,260
You dog, did you beat me?
You don't know about me.

1869
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,760
I'll show you who I am.

1870
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:56,560
You dog... you scoundrel...

1871
01:52:57,270 --> 01:53:00,400
Hey Jyothi, you don't know
how truly I love you...

1872
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:02,810
I'll definitely inform to the police.
- Jyothi, this isn't a joke.

1873
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:08,240
Don't go to police... wait...
stop Jyothi... hey Jyothi...

1874
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:10,370
Don't come near me...
I'll stone at you.

1875
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,280
Look Jyothi, no...
listen to me...

1876
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:14,760
Can't you hear? - No, Jyothi...

1877
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,560
Don't come near me...
- Look Jyothi, no...

1878
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,030
Move away!

1879
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,860
You hit me...
I'll show you my true colour.

1880
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:27,590
Hey, wait... stop it.
Are you acting smart with me?

1881
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:32,130
Leave me...
- Are you acting smart with me?

1882
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,740
How dare you go to the police?

1883
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:36,370
Show your pranks on
someone else...

1884
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,550
I was giving your a long rope,

1885
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:39,610
I'll inform the police that
Nellai Mani is in your custody.

1886
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,380
I'll definitely put you in jail.

1887
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,070
<i>Love teaches us the value of life...</i>

1888
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:11,770

01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:17,610
Call her...

1909
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:25,410
Have it, sir...

1910
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:27,680
Hey, I know when to drink liquor!

1911
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,660
Did I beg you for drinks?

1912
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:30,830
<i>Call Jyothi...</i>

1913
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,490
Sir, please stop it... - Oh no!

1914
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:35,490
<i>Call Jyothi...</i>

1915
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:37,900
E, what do you want now?

1916
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,900
Why did you come here?

1917
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:43,970
Do you have money?
I want to eat...

1918
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:51,910
<i>History is full of violence...</i>

1919
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:57,380
<i>Why the hell we encourage violence?</i>

1920
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:14,200
<i>Most of the dead in the earth</i>
<i>are love failures...</i>

1921
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:18,640
<i>Love promotes tears and pains...</i>

1922
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:24,980
<i>Still love lasts forever...</i>

1923
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:30,100
<i>You fight for yourself</i>
<i>in the battlefield...</i>

1924
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:35,320
<i>Love is also the same...</i>

1925
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:58,350
Rs.15 lakhs reward to anyone
who catches Nellai Mani alive or dead.

1926
01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:58,870
Read it again.

1927
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:04,080
Rs.15 lakhs reward to anyone
who catches Nellai Mani alive or dead.

1928
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:08,120
E, come with me...
- What's the matter?

1929
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,490
I want to talk to you...
Come on...

1930
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:16,830
This is my last request to you...
Did you see the paper?

1931
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:17,800
What do you want now?

1932
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:19,370
Nellai Mani, who is in your custody,

1933
01:58:19,570 --> 01:58:21,440
anyone catching him alive or dead.

1934
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,770
will be rewarded Rs.15 lakhs
by the government.

1935
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,110
I know!

1936
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:27,410
Always you used to tell
good news in sad tone.

1937
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:29,250
E, I love you...

1938
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:31,820
How many times will you tell me?

1939
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,950
We are going to get Rs.25 lakhs, aren't we?

1940
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,090
We are going to live happily...

1941
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:41,790
25 lakhs alone won't make us happy.

1942
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:43,700
You shouldn't kill Nellai Mani.

1943
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:45,630
If you love me truly,

1944
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,930
This is my first & last request to you.

1945
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,370
I've already committed
to kill him for 10 lakhs.

1946
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:53,330
As you said, if I surrender
him to the police...

1947
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:55,910
He will definitely be
sentenced to death.

1948
01:58:56,910 --> 01:58:59,310
Anyhow, he is going to die...

1949
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:00,710
Why should we lose that money?

1950
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:02,520
If we take law into our hands
and kill him...

1951
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,920
We will gain Rs.10 lakhs.

1952
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:07,010
You're not getting the point...
I'm thinking correctly...

1953
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:08,150
But you people are confusing me...

1954
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:11,050
E, till now you did only small crimes.

1955
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:13,690
You were choiceless.
There was no other go...

1956
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:15,850
If you want, you can
reform now also.

1957
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:18,600
But if you commit a murder for money,

1958
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,500
Your future will become miserable.

1959
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:22,300
What are you trying to say now?

1960
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:24,810
Do you want me to lose
Rs.10 lakhs for love?

1961
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:25,800
Money isn't an issue...

1962
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,710
It doesn't matter even if you
don't have money.

1963
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:29,540
But after marrying a murderer,

1964
01:59:29,650 --> 01:59:33,850
I can't live or even die peacefully.

1965
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:36,410
Till now, I haven't murdered
or fallen in love.

1966
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,950
Both are new to me.

1967
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:40,460
After my grandma, I respect only you.

1968
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:41,890
What do you want me to do now?

1969
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:43,520
If you really love me...

1970
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:45,860
If our love is true...
You shouldn't kill him!

1971
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:48,990
That's what you want, isn't it?
Your love will win.

1972
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:52,130
I won't kill him. Believe me...

1973
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:53,030
Promise?

1974
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:56,110
I swear on you...
I swear on our love...

1975
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:03,340
After seeing such an announcement
in the paper,

1976
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,010
Everybody will start searching him,
collapsing our operation...

1977
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:08,220
Do you know the value of my research?

1978
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:10,520
Visit my Research Centre once...

1979
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:16,530
Being an S.I., he is wasting
his time over there.

1980
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:19,600
Did you consider police as rowdies?

1981
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:25,860
Only here, no growth in police department
and in rowdyism.

1982
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:29,170
Foreigners are afraid to invest
crores depending on you.

1983
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,570
Doctor, you can't buy entire Police dept.

1984
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:36,880
If I want, I can easily control
all the departments in the world.

1985
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:44,510
But it's impossible to buy patriots like
Nellai Mani who work for people.

1986
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:48,250
They always struggle for people...
And are ready to die for people!

1987
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,490
That's why I'm asking you to kill him.

1988
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:54,130
Sir, I don't think Nellai Mani is with E.

1989
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:57,760
Find from his friend, Tony.
Buy him liquor.

1990
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:58,770
Tell him that he will get a good share.

1991
02:00:58,870 --> 02:01:02,780
Hey, be careful.
Don't commit more...

1992
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:03,870
He will get confused...

1993
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:07,110
Commit in terms of thousands.

1994
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:09,840
First finish that job...

1995
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:12,810
I want Nellai Mani's body.

1996
02:01:13,190 --> 02:01:13,880
At the earliest!

1997
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:15,820
Greetings, boss.

1998
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,720
Greetings. - Come, Tony...

1999
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:24,190
All these days, you've been
friendly with E, haven't you?

2000
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:26,300
But now, he has tried to beat you.

2001
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,530
Is he your true friend?

2002
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,860
What can I say?
It's a world full of cheats.

2003
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:31,600
Am I right?

2004
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:35,170
Give this liquor to him. - No boss...

2005
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:39,910
Oh no! no boss. I've stopped drinking.
I've sworn not to drink.

2006
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:40,810
Yes boss...

2007
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,440
When a girl cheated me,
getting me drunk.

2008
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:45,950
I quit drinking.
- Have it man...

2009
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,820
No, boss... what's this, boss?
- Hey, leave him... don't force him.

2010
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:52,460
That day didn't I give you
a photo of Nellai Mani?

2011
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:54,090
It seems he is with E.

2012
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,590
No... I don't think so...

2013
02:01:57,700 --> 02:01:59,070
Till yesterday, I was with E only.

2014
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,330
I didn't see anyone like that.

2015
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,560
Really? - Yes.

2016
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:02,900
Ask him...

2017
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:09,540
Oh no! Oh my god!
- Hey, tell the truth...

2018
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:11,840
Hey, tell us the truth if you
had seen him... - No...

2019
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,140
They will beat you to death.

2020
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,380
I swear, no one is staying with E. - Is it?

2021
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:16,510
You carry on...

2022
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:21,190
Oh no! - Tell us the truth...

2023
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:24,420
I swear, I don't know... - Hey, leave me...

2024
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:27,960
Boss, I haven't seen Nellai Mani at all...

2025
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:29,790
Oh my God!

2026
02:02:29,970 --> 02:02:34,030
Hey, take him inside and ask him...
- Hey, leave me...

2027
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:59,420
Hey Tony... what's all this, man?

2028
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,590
It's nothing, E.

2029
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:04,970
Yesterday Beeda Ravi's men beat me
severely asking about Nellai Mani...

2030
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:08,970
I had severe body aches.
I took tablets and slept here...

2031
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:10,040
Hey, did you inform them?

2032
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:12,610
Hey, don't insult me...
how can I reveal it?

2033
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:17,610
All my childhood, I lived eating
your left over food.

2034
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,790
One more slap,
I would've definitely died.

2035
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:22,110
But wouldn't have betrayed you.

2036
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,850
You fool!

2037
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:25,920
If I was in your position,
I would've betrayed.

2038
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,320
Why should I die for others?

2039
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:30,330
It's all because of Jyothi!

2040
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,660
She is a big nuisance to me!

2041
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:32,900
It seems she will put me in jail.

2042
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:35,570
How will she? Doesn't she love you?

2043
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:37,140
Love?! She is a big torture!

2044
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,260
Why did you come here?

2045
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:44,200
We shouldn't delay any further...

2046
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,880
We must kill Nellai Mani tonight.

2047
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,710
Yesterday I was looking
for a way to kill him.

2048
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:50,680
I thought of stabbing with an iron rod,

2049
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,650
but I heard the victim
dies very slowly.

2050
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:55,380
I saw a grinding stone
somewhere around here...

2051
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:56,880
There it is. Come.

2052
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:00,650
Get the iron rod in the vehicle.

2053
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:11,430
Remove the sand.

2054
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:13,760
Go ahead.

2055
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:19,970
Remove the sand & shake the stone.

2056
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:22,910
Get the vehicle.

2057
02:04:24,150 --> 02:04:28,380
It'll be 50 kgs,
I must kill him with this stone.

2058
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,120
You were right.

2059
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:36,890
If you throw this on his face,
he will die instantly.

2060
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:37,850
Fool!

2061
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:39,530
If his face gets smashed,

2062
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:41,060
they will deny that it is
Nellai Mani's body

2063
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:42,460
and we might end up losing the money.

2064
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,730
We must throw it on his chest.
I know that.

2065
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:49,170
I will take this stone to our den.

2066
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:52,550
You come with this vehicle at 2 am.

2067
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,480
We will kill him tonight and
put the body in this vehicle.

2068
02:04:57,250 --> 02:05:01,780
No one has ever finished a job
successfully in a drunken state.

2069
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:04,790
Such jobs can be done
only after having a drink.

2070
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:05,590
Do it and then say

2071
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:56,570
Stop.

2072
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,640
Where are you coming from?

2073
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:01,310
Jyothi, you don't know about E.

2074
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,710
If you go to police,
he won't hesitate to kill you also.

2075
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:06,640
E will kill Nellai Mani tonight.

2076
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:08,550
And his dead body will get him money.

2077
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:11,220
If you can tolerate all this stuff,
marry & live with him.

2078
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:12,560
Move.

2079
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,620
I know... you can't kill me.

2080
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,960
I knew that you brought me here to kill,

2081
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:52,990
and take money from that doctor.

2082
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:57,060
Anyway, I am going to die.

2083
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:01,190
You must get the money of
Rs. 15 lakhs after my death.

2084
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:04,040
That's why I came with you.

2085
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:09,370
There are few rich people

2086
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:13,140
for whom you clean the
toilets & drain, wash clothes,

2087
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:16,020
and also kill people for money.

2088
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:18,650
You kill someone for someone's necessity.
Is this your profession?

2089
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:20,680
What do you know?

2090
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:22,450
Children sleeping on the platform,
playing in the drainage,

2091
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:26,820
and eating the leftovers you will one day
become a fly just like me.

2092
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:30,930
Pickpocketing, chain snatching,
cut hands & legs...

2093
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:31,800
...and even kill someone.

2094
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:34,870
But they will never be you.

2095
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:37,400
Stop lecturing me about life.

2096
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:40,510
My mother was a farm hand
toiled to educate me.

2097
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:41,980
Not only our lives are like this.

2098
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:46,120
99% of the world's population lives
on platform with mosquito bites.

2099
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,620
That doesn't mean that we must
become hired assassins.

2100
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:51,390
If you become a suicide bomber,

2101
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:54,590
it will bring freedom to this earth.

2102
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:56,820
One needs to be educated
to become like you.

2103
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:59,060
Study the people.
There is nothing bigger than that.

2104
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,960
Without food...? Get lost.

2105
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:02,090
Live for the people.

2106
02:10:02,300 --> 02:10:03,400
And they will look after you.

2107
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,590
They will share their food with you.

2108
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:07,270
I won't trust people.

2109
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:08,800
And I'm not qualified for that.

2110
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:13,470
My mother came to this market without
knowing the language or the place.

2111
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:17,020
She was young & beautiful.

2112
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:20,190
Don't they know that she is mad?

2113
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:37,460
<i>People gave her chocolates,</i>
<i>ice cream and a sari too.</i>

2114
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:39,640
<i>But I don't know who made her pregnant.</i>

2115
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:44,140
<i>My mom ate this state's food.</i>

2116
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:46,940
<i>And this state's blood runs in my body too.</i>

2117
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:49,650
<i>But blood has no value in this market.</i>

2118
02:10:51,190 --> 02:10:52,350
I don't know my father.

2119
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:54,520
May be I was born for this market.

2120
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,490
Somebody help me...

2121
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:09,360
It's okay my mother died,

2122
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,170
but she shouldn't have given birth to me.

2123
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,820
I took birth on the green leaves.

2124
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,820
Old lady selling greens brought me up.

2125
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:22,450
My grandma took a photo of my mother
to show it to me when I grow.

2126
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:25,220
Look how beautiful my mother
is even after death.

2127
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:31,450
Friend, I don't have the right
to live with people.

2128
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,620
I don't know my caste, creed or religion.

2129
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:37,830
Even small children call me "Bastard".

2130
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,300
Not knowing your father is
your biggest qualification.

2131
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,370
If you did, you'll have
a caste and a religion.

2132
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:44,720
You would've become a caste leader
or a religion fanatic.

2133
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:47,040
If you know your mother tongue,
you will stick to that language alone.

2134
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:52,870
So, being an "lllegitimate child"
itself is a biggest qualification.

2135
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:06,720
He is Dr. Ramakrishnan, a criminal.

2136
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:08,520
Yes.

2137
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:14,230
First he used to sell a Rs. 2 medicine
for Rs. 200 & minted money.

2138
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:19,000
So he sold banned medicines in India
and made huge profits.

2139
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,900
And now he gets millions
from the rich foreign countries

2140
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,410
and test the medicines on the people
without their knowledge.

2141
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:27,180
After testing the medicines on animals,
he is testing it on our people.

2142
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,890
Now, medicine & virus are the most
powerful weapons than an atom bombs.

2143
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:33,450
That's the most profitable business
around the world.

2144
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:39,630
His business is to develop dangerous
viruses & kill people.

2145
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,920
Like Sars & Anthrax.

2146
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:42,900
Viruses will destroy agriculture.

2147
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:44,130
Farmers will die.

2148
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:47,600
A 10 gm of virus can bring destruction more
than what a 1 ton atom bomb.

2149
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:48,540
It will destroy our next generation.

2150
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:50,630
Since it is cheap, anyone can buy it.

2151
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:55,070
Even the local rowdies can spray
the viruses on our people.

2152
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:57,510
Ramakrishnan develops
those viruses in India.

2153
02:12:58,250 --> 02:13:00,480
In the name of research,
he lives with dead. He is mad.

2154
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:03,020
I must throw handbills after killing him.

2155
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:06,920
Let's kill Dr. Ramakrishnan to save the world.

2156
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,950
Only then, people will know about him.

2157
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,390
Will they really understand?

2158
02:13:14,430 --> 02:13:14,920
They won't.

2159
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:17,760
They will even call us fools.

2160
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:20,500
These are the people who died in
Dr. Ramakrishnan's research.

2161
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:21,500
Stop scrolling.

2162
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,370
I know her.

2163
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:27,740
She is Jyothi's brother's daughter.

2164
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,350
Really?

2165
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:30,850
She died because of him.

2166
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,920
If you hadn't stopped me from
killing Ramakrishnan,

2167
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:35,110
she might have been saved.

2168
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:41,250
She is my grandma.

2169
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,990
She is admitted in his hospital.

2170
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:45,790
You've done a grave mistake.

2171
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:06,420
I won't mind anything.

2172
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:08,250
But if you get the body, I must get my share.

2173
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:09,560
Send a few policemen with me.

2174
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:13,730
Let 2 of you go with him.
Others get into the car.

2175
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:18,760
Police have surrounded us.

2176
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:26,000
You go & search there.

2177
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:30,000
Even the rowdies are here.

2178
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:32,540
By now, E must have killed Nellai Mani.

2179
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:35,250
We must snatch the body before
he hands it over to the police.

2180
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:36,650
Kill E if he tries to stop us.

2181
02:14:37,150 --> 02:14:39,640
Because the body is worth Rs. 15 lakhs.

2182
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:42,260
We can make money only if we
give the body to the doctor.

2183
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,660
You go this way. I will go this way.

2184
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:44,520
Come, let's go.

2185
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:45,590
Give me betel leaf.

2186
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:55,640
This will happen in our lives.

2187
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:56,980
Don't get confused.

2188
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,370
Rowdies will kill me for money.

2189
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,950
Government rewards Rs.15 lakhs for my body

2190
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:05,460
It's people's money.

2191
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:07,050
Only you must get it.

2192
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,980
What are you talking?
Money is not important.

2193
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:09,980
I've a gun.

2194
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:12,980
What will you do?

2195
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:14,390
I will shoot anyone who steps in.

2196
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:15,620
How many will you shoot?

2197
02:15:16,190 --> 02:15:17,890
As many as I can. Till I die.

2198
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:18,990
Why should we both die?

2199
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:20,860
One is enough.

2200
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,290
I'm already dying.

2201
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,840
Rowdies will hack me to death.

2202
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:31,430
If the police get me, they'll torture me.

2203
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,680
You kill me.

2204
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:43,120
Sir... - If you shoot them to save me,

2205
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:44,500
you will also be in their hit list.

2206
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:46,180
Ramakrishnan will win in his attempts.

2207
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:48,680
Do as I say.

2208
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:49,990
They are coming.

2209
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,490
I've thought about it.

2210
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:53,700
Put that down & take this.

2211
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:57,240
Shoot...

2212
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,100
Sir, I can't.

2213
02:15:59,470 --> 02:16:02,440
I die laying my hopes on you.

2214
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:06,800
Stop wasting time.

2215
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,220
Shoot.

2216
02:16:11,690 --> 02:16:13,240
They will fight for my body.

2217
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:16,920
But you must respect my sacrifice.

2218
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:20,830
Trust people. Be true to them.

2219
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:27,260
I wanted to tell you a lot.

2220
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:48,720
I feel bad for leaving you all.

2221
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:51,990
Okay.

2222
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:54,630
It's your first time with a gun.

2223
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:56,630
Aim properly.

2224
02:16:58,970 --> 02:17:00,090
I shouldn't struggle much.

2225
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,540
I should die instantly.

2226
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:10,520
Ready... shoot.

2227
02:17:12,050 --> 02:17:12,670
Ready...

2228
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:16,300
Wait.

2229
02:17:20,390 --> 02:17:21,480
Down with profit making.

2230
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:43,380
Friend.

2231
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:25,720
This is a dead end.
Let's go the other way.

2232
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,840
We must take the body before
another gang comes.

2233
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:28,890
Come... fast.

2234
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:32,820
The body is missing.

2235
02:18:35,070 --> 02:18:37,230
The body which E is carrying
is Nellai Mani's body.

2236
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:44,440
Quick...

2237
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,650
Beat them & take the body.

2238
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:54,080
He is a good man.
He sacrifices his life for us.

2239
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:55,780
Leave the body.

2240
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:02,060
Tell them to leave the body.

2241
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:03,590
He is like our leader.

2242
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:05,660
Take it fast.

2243
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:25,440
<i>Make it fast.</i>

2244
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,610
<i>Let's go through market an</i>
<i>take the body to our house.</i>

2245
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:29,880
<i>They shouldn't get the body.</i>

2246
02:19:30,830 --> 02:19:33,090
<i>How dare you take our dead body?</i>

2247
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:47,940
<i>Come on E.</i>

2248
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:54,410
<i>We shouldn't lose the body.</i>

2249
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:04,440
What? What?

2250
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:44,830
<i>A warrior's life has come to an end.</i>

2251
02:20:46,810 --> 02:20:53,440
<i>Though dead he will live in you...</i>

2252
02:20:55,910 --> 02:21:00,980
<i>A death that defies death...</i>

2253
02:21:01,390 --> 02:21:07,020
<i>Where were you born...</i>

2254
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:12,660
<i>Taking rest here...</i>

2255
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:18,700
<i>Have the bullets sang a lullaby to you?</i>

2256
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:24,700
<i>Has your bloodshed gone waste?</i>

2257
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:30,140
<i>Your breath will stand</i>
<i>against cyclones...</i>

2258
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:36,150
<i>You're the man to change</i>
<i>this decaying world...</i>

2259
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:21,970
I curse myself for loving a man who
makes money from dead bodies.

2260
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,970
I don't feel sad leaving you.

2261
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:34,250
But I'm worried for leaving
a beast like you alive.

2262
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:35,540
Shit!

2263
02:22:36,950 --> 02:22:38,220
Jyothi...

2264
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:40,210
She is going away...

2265
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:43,050
He is a good man.

2266
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:44,650
Don't take hasty decisions.

2267
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:46,930
She is going away.
Tell her that you are a good man.

2268
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:48,460
Jyothi... Aunty...

2269
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:50,260
Tell her that your love is true.

2270
02:22:50,470 --> 02:22:51,020
He is going away.

2271
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,670
What do you want me to tell her?

2272
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,470
Do we take birth to love, eat & die?

2273
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:02,880
How can I love her after seeing
the life taking viruses?

2274
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:06,210
Such viruses must be eliminated
from this world.

2275
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:07,980
And people must live in peace.

2276
02:23:16,390 --> 02:23:18,020
<i>This country must survive...</i>

2277
02:23:18,130 --> 02:23:19,930
<i>You go on a rampage...</i>

2278
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:23,830
<i>Let your brain become</i>
<i>your weapon to destroy evil...</i>

2279
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:25,630
<i>Work hard to shed sweat...</i>

2280
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:27,530
<i>It's a sin to let it go waste...</i>

2281
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:31,470
<i>Become Atlas to carry this</i>
<i>world on your shoulders...</i>

2282
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:33,340
<i>Know whom you should protect...</i>

2283
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:35,240
<i>You are a missile...</i>

2284
02:23:35,350 --> 02:23:37,320
<i>Our heart is a mountain...</i>

2285
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:38,950
<i>Where there is a will there is a way...</i>

2286
02:23:39,050 --> 02:23:40,950
<i>Your will break the mountain into pieces...</i>

2287
02:23:41,290 --> 02:23:42,850
<i>Where there is a will there is a way...</i>

2288
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:47,320
<i>Your will break the mountain into pieces...</i>

2289
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:08,530
<i>Save people.</i>

2290
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:24,850
E... how come you are here?

2291
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,620
I have also learnt to perform operations.

2292
02:25:30,170 --> 02:25:31,690
You sucked our blood.

2293
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:33,770
I want you see yours now.

2294
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:37,500
I will rip your intestines and
check your fat level.

2295
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:41,640
I want to see your brain which
calculates money all the time,

2296
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:44,870
And whether you've a heart or not.

2297
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,440
No E.

2298
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:53,750
I'm not E anymore.
I'm Dr. E.

2299
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:56,120
Shouldn't I be honoured
with a Doctorate?

2300
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:02,430
No. I will give you money.

2301
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:03,600
Rs. 10 lakhs.

2302
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,640
Rs. 50 lakhs... Rs. 1 crore.

2303
02:26:09,740 --> 02:26:11,870
Come here. Come closer.

2304
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:22,750
Please don't kill me. Rs. 2 crores.

2305
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:24,380
Grandma, he wants to buy
everything with money.

2306
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:27,120
Isn't there anything which can't
be bought with money?

2307
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:30,200
My grandma is worth more than you.

2308
02:26:55,120 --> 02:27:04,030
No. I beg you.

2309
02:27:06,530 --> 02:27:09,440
Now come closer.

2310
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:49,640
E, please don't kill me.
- I've no other choice.

2311
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:53,380
Only if you die, people will know about
this place through paper & TV.

2312
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:56,750
Only then they will believe me

2313
02:27:56,850 --> 02:27:59,220
If you don't die,
people won't believe me.

2314
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:00,460
Stop.

2315
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:30,610
Inventions are made to provide a better living.

2316
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:33,650
To kill people, you don't need
any research or development.

2317
02:28:36,330 --> 02:28:38,060
No E.

2318
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:42,190
When people can't afford
to buy medicines,

2319
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:44,800
why do you create medicines to kill them?

2320
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:49,930
When people are against war,
why develop new weapons?

2321
02:28:50,410 --> 02:28:51,900
When everyone is trying to
eradicate dangerous viruses,

2322
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:53,640
why do you create them?

2323
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:04,810
To save the world,

2324
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:09,920
viruses like you should die.

2325
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,860
Rs. 10 LAKHS REWARD FOR
CATCHING E ALIVE OR DEAD.
