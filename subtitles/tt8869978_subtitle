1
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,450
"Breaking News!"

2
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,280
"Terror strikes in Delhi once again!"

3
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,820
"Five explosions in the space of 
40 minutes across the glorious capital."

4
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,780
"..Delhi targeted by terrorists!"

5
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
"Blasts kill 30 and leave 
more than 100 injured."

6
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,740
"Indian Mujahideen have taken 
responsibility for the blast."

7
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,900
"A short while after 
the bomb blast in Delhi..."

8
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,360
"...a journalist received an 
email from the Indian Mujahideen."

9
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,530
"India has faced numerous terrorist 
attacks in the past 12 months."

10
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,650
"These blasts have left 
400 dead and thousands injured."

11
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,030
"Delhi Police Special 
Cell fails once again."

12
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,820
"Not only did they fail to stop the attacks, 
they also weren't able to catch the terrorists."

13
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,450
"Terrorist attacks cripple 
Delhi Police Special Cell."

14
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,240
"What is ACP Sanjay Kumar doing?"

15
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
"Where are the security 
agencies of our country?"

16
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,490
Pressure, case, pressure.

17
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,490
I've been hearing 
that for almost a year.

18
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,280
I know what you're going to say.

19
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,530
You're under tremendous pressure since 
those series of bomb blasts in Delhi.

20
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,110
Isn't that right, Sanjay?

21
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,570
How many more medals 
are you looking to win?

22
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Isn't six enough already?

23
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,570
Do you know that your medals,

24
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,280
honor, and your duty...

25
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,990
Our marriage is falling apart, Sanjay.

26
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Actually, 
there's nothing left between us.

27
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Our friends and relatives keep

28
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
asking me over and over again...

29
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,360
...what the hell are you doing 
in this house, Nandita.

30
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Then you should leave.

31
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,240
Really?

32
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,650
That was the only thing 
left to say.

33
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,740
I must go.

34
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360
Can you drop me 
to the travel agent's office?

35
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,650
Give him a call,

36
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,650
he'll deliver the tickets at home.

37
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,400
- You can take the other car... 
- Ram Singh.

38
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,490
I think...

39
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,780
I'll drop you.

40
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,070
Go get ready.

41
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,990
Drop me here.

42
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,860
- But you were... 
- You were right.

43
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,700
I should have got the 
tickets delivered at home.

44
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,200
And go to the parlor instead.

45
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,320
What? Now?

46
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,780
- Pull up here, Maan Singh. 
- Sir.

47
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,860
Sanjay.

48
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,820
I thought after all 
the time we spent together...

49
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,240
...you will ask me to stay.

50
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,490
This was just an excuse to come along.

51
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,400
Your decision to leave is correct.

52
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,570
So why should I stop you?

53
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,990
Anyway...

54
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,360
- Maan Singh, let's go. 
- Sir.

55
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,150
- Yeah, Wazir. 
- KK sir and I are ready.

56
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,860
- Please get here. 
- Yes, I am on my way.

57
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,490
But don't engage 
until I don't get there.

58
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,360
Yes, sir. I'll pass on the message.

59
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:44,990
'Everyone please note that today's Iftar 
will be at 06:40pm in the evening..'

60
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,780
- Yeah? 
- Sir.

61
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,200
Sanjay sir doesn't want us 
to engage until he gets here.

62
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,610
- Let me do my job. 
- But...

63
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,700
- Jeetu, everything under control upstairs? 
- Yes, sir.

64
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,570
Let's move. Move, move.

65
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,360
Jaiswal, let's move, let's move.

66
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,200
Sir, KK sir has gone inside...

67
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,030
Why did you open fire?

68
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,570
Who gave the orders to engage?

69
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,700
Well, sir... 
Well...

70
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,740
KK...!

71
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,400
Sir...

72
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,070
Get down. Cover the area.

73
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
Take them to safety. Now. 
Get in.

74
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,530
Get inside.

75
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,950
Hurry up. Hurry up.

76
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,280
Get inside! Inside.

77
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,320
- Inside. 
- Let's go.

78
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Hurry up.

79
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,610
That way.

80
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,860
Sir...shots are being 
fired upstairs, sir.

81
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,490
Shots are being fired upstairs, sir.

82
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,400
Get out of here.

83
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,780
- KK... 
- Yeah?

84
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,780
- KK, are you all right? 
- He's been shot twice.

85
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,990
Jeetu, get him to 
a hospital immediately.

86
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,070
Okay, sir.

87
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,320
Let's go.

88
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,650
- Ma'am, shall we begin? 
- Yeah.

89
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,490
Ma'am, there are around 18 missed calls.

90
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,030
Nandita, the Special Cell has engaged 
in some kind of encounter.

91
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Sanjay was leading the inquiry, 
am I right?

92
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,610
I was a little anxious because 
you weren't answering my calls.

93
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,360
Just call Sanjay and 
make sure he's okay, alright?

94
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,360
And don't worry. 
I'll send someone else to cover it.

95
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,360
Okay.

96
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,780
This morning at 10:30, 
in the Okhla University area...

97
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,610
...the Police engaged in a shootout

98
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,400
with a group of terrorists 
hiding out here.

99
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,070
We have information 
of two Police casualties...

100
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,820
- ...and one of them is seriously injured. 
- Open the door! Hurry!

101
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,240
As you can see, 
the injured police officer is being...

102
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,400
Keep your eyes open, sir.

103
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
Let's go, Wazir.

104
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,650
Let's go. Come on.

105
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,780
Let's go.

106
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,240
Let's go.

107
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,450
Give way!

108
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,360
Get out of the way!

109
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,360
Give way.

110
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,030
Sanjay pickup. 
Sanjay, please...

111
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,700
Ladies and Gentlemen:

112
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,490
Please come out...in huge numbers...

113
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,490
Sir!

114
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,610
Sir?

115
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,320
Sir. 
There are two boys inside.

116
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
There is no god but Allah. 
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.

117
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,740
There is no god but Allah. 
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.

118
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,030
Stop!

119
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,900
Stop!

120
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,360
Don't shoot me, sir. Don't shoot...

121
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,990
I am coming out. 
Don't shoot, sir.

122
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,780
I am coming out. 
Please don't shoot.

123
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,200
Please, don't shoot.

124
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,280
Please, don't shoot, sir. 
I will come out.

125
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
Please, don't shoot, 
sir. I will come out.

126
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,610
Check him for weapons.

127
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Okay, sir.

128
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,280
I will come out. I will...

129
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,990
-Get up. Come on.

130
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,700
Nothing, sir.

131
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,280
Get changed.

132
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,280
Hello, sir.

133
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,150
Sanjay speaking.

134
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,530
What on earth is going on, Sanjay?

135
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,320
Well...KK's been shot, 
and Wazir is injured.

136
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
I've sent him to the hospital.

137
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,360
And informed the Police Control Room.

138
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,490
Ashok and I are on my way.

139
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,110
- You know what to do? 
- Yes, sir.

140
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,150
Jai Hind.

141
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,030
Sir, I'll inform you.

142
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,490
The Commissioner!

143
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,360
- Let's go. 
- Sir...

144
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,030
Please turn on the news. 
I said turn on the news!

145
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,320
Nandita, what's going on? 
Is everything all right?

146
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,740
This morning at 10:30, 
in the Okhla University area...

147
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,740
...the Police engaged in a shootout

148
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,610
with a group of terrorist hiding here.

149
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,400
We have information 
of two Police casualties...

150
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,200
...and one of them is seriously injured.

151
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,700
As you can see...

152
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,820
Hello.

153
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,150
Maan Singh, where is Sanjay?

154
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,610
I've been trying to get in touch, 
why isn't anyone picking up?

155
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,990
Sir is absolutely fine, ma'am. 
He's just tied up at the moment.

156
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,240
Madam, KK sir was shot 
and he's been taken to the hospital.

157
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,650
Madam?

158
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,110
Madam?

159
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,700
Tell us who he is.

160
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,950
Keep this inside.

161
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,820
Tell us.

162
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,780
Who is he?

163
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,570
Do you know him?

164
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,570
You?

165
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,400
Do you know him? 
- I don't know him, sir.

166
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,400
No.

167
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,700
You don't, do you? 
- No, sir.

168
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,030
Take a good look. 
Do you know him?

169
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,860
I haven't done anything, sir.

170
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,320
- Did he say anything yet? 
- Not yet, sir.

171
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,650
You haven't done anything?

172
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,070
Then what is all this?

173
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,320
What is it? 
Huh?

174
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,780
Sir...

175
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:55,240
'Delhi Police is torturing us, 
they are making life hell for us.'

176
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,320
'This isn't the first 
time they have done this.'

177
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,150
'Let us all join hands together and

178
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,990
raise a voice against 
this Police nuisance.'

179
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,360
'Let's not allow them 
to conspire against us again.'

180
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,490
- Sir. 
- Yes?

181
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,360
We'll need backup.

182
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,280
The force is on its way, Sanjay.

183
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,990
Just hold on.

184
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,900
'Delhi Police is always 
conspiring against us.'

185
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,820
'They sometimes arrest 
our innocent Muslim boys.'

186
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,450
'They nab them without 
arrest warrants.'

187
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,700
'They charge them with false charges.'

188
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,320
'This has become a common 
trait of the Delhi Police now.'

189
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,820
Sir, the ambulance has arrived.

190
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,150
We won't tolerate this bullying.

191
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,740
We won't tolerate this bullying.

192
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,400
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

193
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,950
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

194
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,490
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

195
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,070
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

196
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,610
We won't tolerate this bullying.

197
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,280
We won't tolerate this bullying.

198
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,490
Sir, KK entered from the other door...

199
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,070
...which was open.

200
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Our men say that the boys opened fire...

201
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,990
...KK and Wazir both 
sustained injuries.

202
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,200
We took down these two boys. 
Sadiq and Adil.

203
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,280
The third one Tufail has surrendered.

204
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,360
But the other two 
are still at large, sir.

205
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,400
- Down with the Delhi Police!

206
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,240
- Down with the Delhi Police!

207
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,820
How did KK get shot?

208
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,450
You were only supposed to investigate?

209
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,530
Who gave orders to engage?

210
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,570
This operation should have 
been carried out quietly and smoothly.

211
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,570
- Down with the Delhi Police!

212
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,950
So how did it turn into this circus?

213
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,400
Answer me.

214
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,860
Sir, KK, and Wazir...

215
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,320
- Down with the Delhi Police!

216
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,650
- Down with the Delhi Police!

217
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,950
- Down with the Delhi Police!

218
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,950
- Down with the Delhi Police!

219
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,950
They were only following my orders, sir.

220
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,740
They were only following 
your orders you say.

221
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,570
- Down with the Delhi Police!

222
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,780
For your sake and mine, 
I hope you're right.

223
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,280
Remember, you're known for one thing.

224
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,780
And that's following orders.

225
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,780
And your orders were to investigate,

226
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,490
and not to engage.

227
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,740
- Down with the Delhi Police!

228
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,610
I'm heading to the hospital.

229
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,740
- Down with the Delhi Police!

230
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,070
- Down with the Delhi Police!

231
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,650
- Down with the Delhi Police!

232
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

233
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,900
- Down with the Delhi Police!

234
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,570
- Down with the Delhi Police!

235
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,820
'They have brutally 
killed innocent children.'

236
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,950
'They have spilled innocent 
blood on our streets.'

237
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,240
- Down with the Delhi Police!

238
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,610
- Down with the Delhi Police!

239
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,030
- Down with the Delhi Police!

240
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,740
- Down with the Delhi Police!

241
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,990
- Down with the Delhi Police!

242
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,700
- Down with the Delhi Police!

243
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,740
- Down with the Delhi Police!

244
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

245
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,860
- Down with the Delhi Police!

246
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,030
- Down with the Delhi Police!

247
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

248
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,610
Are you okay, Nandita?

249
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,570
Can you read the bulletin 
in this condition?

250
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,950
My husband always keeps lecturing 
me about how duty comes first.

251
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,700
Even before me.

252
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,990
I guess its time to show him today.

253
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Give me 10 minutes.

254
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,780
I am not okay,

255
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,450
but I will be.

256
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,820
What's the matter? 
She looks pretty upset.

257
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,110
Her husband Sanjay 
is on the Special Cell...

258
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,650
There's nothing to worry about.

259
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,030
Everyone knows that 
these encounters are fake.

260
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,780
They just dragged those boys 
down there and gunned them down.

261
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,650
Come on, Rashmi, you can't be so rude.

262
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,240
Oh, please! What Rashmi?

263
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,200
There was some kind of 
internal departmental rivalry...

264
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,820
...between KK and Sanjay.

265
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,570
They staged this fake encounter 
because of the Delhi bomb blast.

266
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,070
My fellow officers.

267
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,900
The time has come to throw 
our arms and ammunition in the garbage.

268
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,990
The new ACP will be joining us soon...

269
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,610
...and he will give us a crash course 
in computers.

270
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,070
You no longer have to exercise your 
brains or brawn to catch the culprits.

271
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,700
We just need to turn on our computers...

272
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,700
...press shift + enter

273
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,900
and the culprit will be apprehended.

274
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,030
Right?

275
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,320
Sir, many have come and gone 
In front of you.

276
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,450
And pretty soon they all start 
to see your point of view.

277
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,650
And that will be the case 
with the new officer as well.

278
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,860
Don't be under any delusion, all of you.

279
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,320
Starting today we will 
all function like computers.

280
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,900
We'll follow a set parameter. 
We'll follow a set...

281
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
Jai Hind, sir.

282
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,860
Sorry, I couldn't come earlier.

283
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,200
Head constable Balbir Singh, sir.

284
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,780
Sub Inspector Wazir Singh, sir.

285
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,740
Sub-Inspector Jeetender Kumar, sir.

286
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,490
And, sir I...

287
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,570
Kishan Kumar Verma, 
batch of 1992 from DANIPS.

288
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,030
Joined the Delhi Police force 
on 26th July 1992 as Sub-Inspector.

289
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,530
Promoted to Inspector 1997.

290
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,700
Transferred to the 
Delhi Special Cell in 2000.

291
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,030
Number of gangsters arrested; 60.

292
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,070
Neutralized; 35.

293
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,780
Including the dreaded 
Abdul Hashmi of Daish-e-Mohammad.

294
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,070
Gallantry Medals received; 2.

295
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,490
Sir.

296
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,820
Isn't there a way, KK...

297
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,320
Can I call you, KK?

298
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
Sir.

299
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,740
Isn't there a way, 
KK, where I can learn something

300
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,570
from your experience...

301
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,110
...and teach you something in return

302
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,280
with my new ideas.

303
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,950
Sorry, sir. 
We were just trying to lighten the mood.

304
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,950
I can understand.

305
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,280
Can we get to work now?

306
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,610
Or as I say...

307
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,860
Reboot and Restart.

308
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,530
Sir.

309
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,860
Sir, the Joint CP 
has called you down to the Headquarters.

310
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,650
Listen to me first. 
One by one. Please, please.

311
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,240
Everything will be answered.

312
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,530
Well, a Delhi Cell team, under 
ACP Sanjay Kumar...

313
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,070
...were surveilling an organization 
for the last 13 months.

314
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,320
And according to our information...

315
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,320
...the organization is 
called the Indian Mujahideen.

316
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,200
We were tipped off that a key suspect 
of the Indian Mujahideen...

317
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,150
...was hiding at L-18.

318
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,700
Look there.

319
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,530
In L-18 Batla House of 
Okhla area in South Delhi.

320
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,450
So a team led by Inspector 
Kishan Kumar Verma...

321
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,900
...and backed up by ACP Sanjay,

322
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,950
went there to verify the information.

323
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,650
That's what the Police always says.

324
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,360
It's the same old story every time.

325
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,650
The Delhi Police fired 22 rounds 
in return fire...

326
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,030
...resulting in the death of two terrorists, 
Adil Amin alias Bashir and Sadiq.

327
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,360
Were these boys from Delhi, sir?

328
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,240
These boys were not from Delhi.

329
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,900
They were from UP, Nizampur...

330
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,360
...and were living on rent 
at L-18 Batla House.

331
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,900
We've been told that they 
were students of Okhla University.

332
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,360
Your inputs, sir.

333
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,400
We are still investigating that.

334
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,320
But according to the 
information gathered by us...

335
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,110
...they were involved in the 
recent blasts in UP, Gujarat, Mumbai,

336
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,360
and most recently in Delhi.

337
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,950
In fact, the Delhi module 
of the Indian Mujahideen

338
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,280
was being run by Adil Amin.

339
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,740
He was getting direct orders 
from the Bhatkal brothers.

340
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,280
The Special Cell of Delhi Police 
carried out this operation alone,

341
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,950
So I would like to congratulate 
Joint CP/Special Cell Jaivir.

342
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,280
DCP Ashok Kumar, ACP Sanjay, and...

343
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,780
Sir, Inspector KK Verma, 
and Constable Wazir Singh's reports...

344
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,820
Constable Wazir Singh 
is out of danger...

345
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,360
...and Inspector Verma's 
surgery was a success.

346
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,400
Isn't that convenient, sir.

347
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,700
No Police officer has 
ever died in such encounters.

348
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,280
How can you say that!

349
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,450
Media needs to get their facts right!

350
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,360
You print and show unverified facts!

351
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,900
Yes, Jeetender.

352
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,110
Sir, please come to 
the hospital immediately.

353
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,740
Sir...

354
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,950
Sir, may I?

355
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,650
Hello.

356
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,650
I am ACP Sanjay Kumar.

357
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,200
KK was a brave officer.

358
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,650
Careful, dear.

359
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,030
Control yourself.

360
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,820
KK Sharma's is being paid homage.

361
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:57,320
From the people, who considered 
him a role model and a messiah.

362
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,700
- Down with the Delhi Police!

363
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,110
- Down with the Special Cell...

364
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,610
- Down with the Delhi Police!

365
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,400
When we raise a question,

366
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,150
why do they think that we doubt them?

367
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,650
Weapons-armed!

368
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,150
Fire!

369
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,780
People claim that they 
were innocent students.

370
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,030
And this was a fake encounter.

371
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,990
- Ideal son, ideal father. 
- Long live KK Verma.

372
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,780
- Ideal son, ideal father. 
- Long live KK Verma.

373
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,820
- Ideal son, ideal father. 
- Long live KK Verma.

374
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,740
- Down with the Special Cell...

375
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

376
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,820
What's the point of an inquiry?

377
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,530
The Police and Politicians are 
equally involved.

378
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,990
This is what the Police always do.

379
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,360
When they faced extreme pressure...

380
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,990
...they dragged out the students 
in Batla House.

381
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,110
It's amazing that 
the investigating officer

382
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
hasn't been suspended yet...

383
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,950
...nor an inquiry has been ordered.

384
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,360
What on earth is going on?

385
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,900
Sanjay Kumar is a monster 
who needs to be shunted out.

386
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,320
- Down with the Delhi Police!

387
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,240
- Down with the Delhi Police!

388
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,860
- Down with the Delhi Police!

389
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,860
Rashmi, you were absolutely right.

390
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,570
The Police are facing 
a number of allegations.

391
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,700
Yes, absolutely.

392
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,070
The new spin will be that 
this encounter was fake.

393
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,950
And tell the producers to bring 
some of these jokers into the studio.

394
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Rashmi, you will run primetime tomorrow.

395
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,360
- Sure. 
- Alright?

396
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,740
Nandita.

397
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,320
You should take leave for a few days.

398
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,820
Before throwing dirt on anyone, 
you shouldn't forget...

399
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,530
...that Inspector KK Verma 
from the encounter team is no more.

400
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,740
His wife Shweta became a widow 
at the age of 29.

401
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,490
And his young daughter, 
who is still in school...

402
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,740
...doesn't need to hear that

403
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,400
her father staged a fake encounter 
just so that you get more viewership.

404
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,110
Nandita.

405
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,900
Alright, let's go. 
This meeting is over.

406
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,030
Jeetender, a young police inspector...

407
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,400
There are many more names. 
Balbir Singh...

408
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,150
He ran after the most notorious

409
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,780
gangster and rapist of Dehradun 
Bablu Dhondiyal for 6 kilometers...

410
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,700
...before finally apprehending him.

411
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,450
We did a story on him, right? 
There's another name.

412
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
Winner of six Presidential medals, 
ACP Sanjay...

413
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,200
And two innocent boys were shot dead.

414
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,070
who could have probably won 
seven medals someday.

415
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,110
I wasn't in that room, nor were you.

416
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,030
You have no evidence against the Police.

417
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,150
And you think Sanjay will come home

418
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,820
and honestly tell you...

419
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,150
...that he killed two innocent boys.

420
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,200
In this case, 
you would even refute God if He...

421
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,200
You know what, Nandita.

422
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,070
I think your personal bias is 
making you ignore the truth.

423
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,110
I wish you all knew 
what my personal bias

424
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,030
thinks... 
...about the Police and Police officers.

425
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,070
We want this fake encounter 
to be investigated by the NHRC.

426
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,740
We've accessed the post mortem reports.

427
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,240
And it clearly indicated that 
the deceased was tortured first.

428
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,240
Exactly.

429
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,610
This is Sadiq's post mortem reports.

430
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,030
It clearly shows that 
they were shot in the head.

431
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,070
His body is covered with brutal marks.

432
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,950
As well as on Adil's body.

433
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,150
- Look here... 
- Let it play.

434
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,900
We want to tell our viewers,

435
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,530
looking at these bullet wounds...

436
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,740
...the forensic experts believe 
that they were shot at point blank.

437
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,070
It's pretty clear,

438
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,900
The Special Cell officers 
shot them at point blank.

439
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,820
We'll move the court 
against the entire Encounter Team.

440
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,860
Ajay Chauhan from Ekta Party

441
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,740
is meeting with the people 
around the Okhla University area.

442
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,450
Let's go and talk to him.

443
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,610
Yes, sir. Sanjay speaking.

444
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,280
Only CP sir or I will 
give a statement to the press.

445
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,320
Don't worry. 
We will handle everything.

446
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,530
Just focus on your investigation.

447
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,950
The boy who was caught, 
Tufail, take his statement.

448
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,070
Yes, sir. Jai Hind.

449
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,200
You look worried, Tufail.

450
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,400
Why would I be worried?

451
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,700
I have not done anything wrong.

452
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,860
I am just a student.

453
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,820
At the Okhla University.

454
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,320
Sir, we're being framed.

455
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,610
Like him?

456
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,110
He is responsible for 
13 bomb blasts across India.

457
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,820
Or...

458
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,860
Like him?

459
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,400
He shot Inspector Kishan Kumar Verma.

460
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,650
Do you know where he is?

461
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,530
I told you, I don't know, sir.

462
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I told you.

463
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,820
I am being framed, sir. 
I really don't know.

464
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,610
I am just a student.

465
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
I came here to study. Sir, I... 
Sir, I don't know anything.

466
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,280
- I am telling the truth, sir. 
- Speak up.

467
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,820
If you say that, 
he has done this then I am proud of him.

468
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,860
Every Muslim should feel proud of him.

469
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,450
They are Mujahids.

470
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,820
Mujahid?

471
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,780
You feel proud?

472
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,950
Of course, I do.

473
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:40,320
Sharia law allows us to lie or hide 
a few facts under certain circumstances.

474
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,320
Our men can only help our 
people if they are free.

475
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,360
And the things 
they will do outside?

476
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,360
They will kill innocent people.

477
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,320
Does this qualify as helping 
the community or education?

478
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
Or helping it progress?

479
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,150
You don't understand.

480
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,780
Then help me understand as well 
as your community.

481
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,070
Explain.

482
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,740
You won't understand.

483
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:11,150
Because you follow the IPC 
and I follow a different book.

484
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,200
Our holy book.

485
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,740
In our holy book it is said that one should 
raise one's voice against injustice.

486
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,320
We will get rewarded in the end.

487
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,950
What has been happening so far?

488
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,530
Ayodhya.

489
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,240
Gujarat.

490
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,110
The riots that followed.

491
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,110
Our people were targeted.

492
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,650
We are taking revenge for that.

493
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,450
It is justified.

494
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,650
We are permitted to do this.

495
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,950
End of story.

496
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,400
So only the 100 members 
of IM have read this holy book?

497
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,780
Don't the 170 million 
Muslims here know how to read?

498
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,110
The shrapnel from the bomb you plant 
kills dozens of Muslim in a train...

499
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,700
Where is that justified?

500
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,110
What did you say?

501
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,820
Your book?

502
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,570
Explain the meaning of this verse.

503
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,530
You cannot read Arabic, can you?

504
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,450
[Arabic Verse] Do good 
not by ruining anything

505
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,740
[Arabic Verse] Do good 
not by ruining anything

506
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,950
[Arabic Verse] Do good 
because Allah likes it.

507
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,490
[Arabic Verse] Do good 
because Allah likes it.

508
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,780
Do good not by ruining anything.

509
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,700
Do good because Allah likes it.

510
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I won't explain the Koran 
to an illiterate like you...

511
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,650
...who claims to understand Islam...

512
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,610
...and considers it his 
duty to kill innocent people.

513
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,030
You are right.

514
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,610
You have been framed.

515
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,320
You have been brainwashed.

516
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,400
About what's written in this holy book.

517
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,030
About what happened 
to you on this holy land.

518
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,820
There are no angels 
waiting for you in heaven.

519
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,570
A room much smaller than 
this one awaits you in prison...

520
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,360
...where you will rot the 
rest of your misinformed life.

521
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,320
When I will manage to 
nab this friend of yours.

522
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,360
Sir, the camera was switched off.

523
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,200
Wazir will identify him.

524
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,650
No.

525
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,990
He had thin eyebrows.

526
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,320
Like women have.

527
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,650
That's what everyone was saying.

528
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,110
Everyone?

529
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,860
You didn't see him properly?

530
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,780
Yes, but then I got shot.

531
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,950
I did see him, sir.

532
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,200
Get up.

533
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,280
Which one of them shot you?

534
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,110
Wazir's testimony is completely bogus.

535
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,780
We have no evidence to support it.

536
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,570
What's the point of going to Nizampur?

537
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,860
And your witness, 
the one you caught alive...

538
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,530
...is no help to us either.

539
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,490
Rewind it.

540
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,450
Start talking.

541
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,320
Sir, I...

542
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,780
I told you, sir. 
We're just students, sir.

543
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,280
- From the Okhla University... 
- Not that!

544
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,700
- What had I told you? 
- What?

545
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,200
I am from MI, sir.

546
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
What? From where? IM!

547
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,320
From IM, sir.

548
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,320
I am from IM, sir.

549
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,490
Louder. Louder.

550
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,360
I am from IM, sir.

551
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,070
Louder.

552
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,400
Sir, I am a student 
at the Okhla University.

553
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,900
I have not done anything wrong! 
I don't know anything!

554
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,400
Switch off the camera.

555
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,990
- I am telling the truth. 
- Switch off the camera.

556
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,490
I don't know anything, sir!

557
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,860
He backed out before 
we could move to the court.

558
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,030
Any other witness or evidence.

559
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,320
Sorry, sir. 
Sorry.

560
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,860
Yeah...

561
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,450
If this boy's telling the truth.

562
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Okay. 
-Then how did the guns get there?

563
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,200
Excuse me, sir. 
We have a tipoff on Arif.

564
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,650
The one who managed to run away.

565
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,240
He's at the News Express 
Office for an interview.

566
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,530
He claims that they are innocent

567
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,360
And are being wrongly framed... 
...the Police will kill us.

568
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,530
Please save us. 
That's what he's saying.

569
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,280
Vijay.

570
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,530
You cannot barge in like this.

571
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,320
You have no authority.

572
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,820
Get the camera teams ready.

573
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,320
I'll call the Commissioner.

574
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,650
Camera, come on get it ready.

575
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,360
Sanjay, what is the meaning of this?

576
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,320
Madam, that boy...

577
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,860
He is an accused 
in a major terror crime.

578
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,610
We have a warrant against him.

579
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,860
Sir.

580
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,820
This is completely wrong. 
You cannot take him like this.

581
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,700
- Keep quiet. 
- You cannot take him like this.

582
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,950
Where are you going.

583
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,240
You like giving interviews.

584
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,570
You can't do this. 
You can't do this.

585
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,990
Sir... 
-Get the camera.

586
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,860
- They will kill us. 
- You.

587
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,820
We'll take his interview.

588
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,610
First, answer our questions.

589
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,280
What's going on?

590
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,490
What is happening?

591
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,030
The case is already 
pretty controversial.

592
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,740
And now this.

593
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,820
Mr. Leherwal, 
this can do more harm to the Government.

594
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,320
You have no idea how 
many calls I had to make,

595
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,150
and palms I had to grease.

596
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,200
What evidence do you have to

597
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,360
prove that these boys were terrorists?

598
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,860
Or are the protestors right...

599
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,570
...that you're holding innocent boys

600
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,990
in custody and this is just a sham.

601
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,490
Sir, please have a look.

602
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,610
This is the confession 
of the boy in our custody.

603
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,400
And these are his accomplices.

604
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,740
If I don't interrogate them... 
...they will never tell us

605
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,780
about their other 
accomplices and conspiracy.

606
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,530
Then we will never 
know who all are involved.

607
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,320
Mr. Laharwal, 
please explain to your officer.

608
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,280
No one's stopping 
you from arresting them.

609
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,110
But don't target only one community.

610
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,490
Sir, we are not targeting anyone.

611
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,740
Keep a balance.

612
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,740
Arrest some of our 
own for the other cases.

613
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,900
Sir, please read the evidence.

614
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,650
According to the investigation, 
Nizampur is...

615
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,950
- Mr. Laharwal. 
- Yes.

616
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,320
I would like to talk to you alone.

617
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,490
- Sir, with all due respect... 
- Mr. Laharwal.

618
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,990
Release that boy Arif who 
was arrested at the News Studio.

619
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,320
Sanjay, you will just 
make things worse in Nizampur.

620
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,950
Sir, this is a copy 
of Dilshad's passport...

621
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,200
...which we found in L-18.

622
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,030
The address is from Nizampur.

623
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,400
We should prepare 
a team for Nizampur, sir.

624
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,110
The ruling party in 
Nizampur have issued a

625
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,030
statement in the favor 
of those boys, Sanjay.

626
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,280
And since that's where 
Sadiq and Adil belonged from...

627
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,320
...even they are against Delhi Police.

628
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,820
And out here, a representation 
has been sent to the LG.

629
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,360
We'll be pressurized 
for a judicial inquiry.

630
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,450
Then what are the 
instructions for me, sir?

631
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,320
Don't resist inquiry, Sanjay.

632
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,280
When people started raising questions

633
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,490
on this encounter...

634
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,610
...the Crime Branch immediately 
started investigating.

635
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,400
No one will be convinced 
with an internal inquiry, Sanjay.

636
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,030
- Sir... 
- Sanjay! What is your problem?

637
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,320
If you haven't done anything, 
then let there be a judicial inquiry.

638
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,950
What is the issue?

639
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,320
A judicial inquiry will 
only demotivate the cell.

640
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,650
We haven't apprehended all the members

641
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,570
of the Indian Mujahideen's 
Delhi Module, sir.

642
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,070
My team should be busy investigating,

643
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,280
and not answering questions.

644
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,820
How will we fight terror 
with a demotivated cell?

645
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,490
You tell me.

646
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,740
- Is that the only reason, or... 
- We're not lying, sir!

647
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,400
Even you think we're lying, sir?

648
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,400
I always said that the Batla 
House encounter was a false encounter

649
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,780
and I hold by that. 
They need to do a judicial inquiry.

650
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,860
The Police Officer who died...

651
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,610
...he was given transfer 
orders five days before his death.

652
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,320
He was in search for opportunities 
to stop his transfer.

653
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,320
Even you believe all of this is a lie.

654
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,490
Not anymore.

655
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,070
Why?

656
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,450
Why not?

657
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,400
Because the man who 
fell in love with me...

658
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,450
...barged in a news channel today

659
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,240
and did what anyone with 
guilt could've never done.

660
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,280
If he were guilty, 
he would think twice.

661
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,030
The man I love would've done what 
you did only in a circumstance where

662
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,820
he didn't know what to do.

663
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,280
That was your desperation, Sanjay.

664
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,610
Because no one wants to hear you out.

665
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,530
I could have died.

666
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,360
But I survived.

667
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,110
I can get suspended.

668
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,110
And there might be no way out.

669
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,150
Instead of trying to explain it to me...

670
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,150
...you should explain it to 
yourself and go back home.

671
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,150
Home?

672
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,650
Go back home?

673
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:54,360
"Haven't you already hurt me enough?"

674
00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:01,110
"You've come to hurt me some more?"

675
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,780
"I am barely alive."

676
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:13,700
"Have you come to take my soul?"

677
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:22,200
"Why did fate unite us?"

678
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,320
"You've left me in tears."

679
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:35,030
"Once again, you've broken my heart."

680
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,280
A judicial inquiry has begun 
on the Batla House encounter.

681
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,740
What is your opinion on this subject?

682
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,070
Who gave this department the right

683
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,280
to kill innocent kids?

684
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,900
Who has given them the license 
to kill the innocent?

685
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,280
Why wasn't he wearing 
a bulletproof jacket?

686
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,110
Sir, we all decided that 
since it was the month of Ramadan...

687
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,110
...the presence of police 
could create a tense atmosphere.

688
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,150
This Special Cell is the headquarters

689
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,400
of fabricated cases against innocent.

690
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,070
Only after an inquiry 
can the truth be determined.

691
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,780
Are Special Cell Officers 
our saviors or monsters?

692
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,280
We'll know that only after an inquiry.

693
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,400
Batla House Encounter...

694
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,320
A topic of heated debate 
between the people of India

695
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,530
and political parties. 
And even continues to date.

696
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,240
Use the back gate instead.

697
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,610
Jai Hind, sir.

698
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,070
Jai Hind, sir.

699
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:24,990
Jai Hind...

700
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,450
'They are so cruel.

701
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,530
'They shot them in the back.'

702
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,320
'They let their bodies 
lie like they are orphans.'

703
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,990
'They let them rot 
like some stray dogs.'

704
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,200
- Hello, sir. 
- 'That too on the street!'

705
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,820
How did KK get shot?

706
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,110
We arrived a lot later.

707
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,200
How did KK get shot?

708
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,450
Your orders were to investigate? 
Not encounter. 
They claim they are innocent.

709
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,280
It's a fake encounter.

710
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:14,030
If someone gives up his life 
for the sake of our security...

711
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,400
...and claiming that he was 
killed by the Police...

712
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,070
Many people have doubts,

713
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,280
Was it really necessary 
to kill those boys?

714
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,280
When we showed Sonia ji 
the photos of the incident...

715
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,530
Things have heated up post 
The Batla House encounter.

716
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,490
"You should leave me, once again."

717
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:23,820
"Heed my advice, if you love me."

718
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:30,070
"I am anyway as good 
as dead without you."

719
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:36,320
"I just keep wandering around." 
"I just keep crying."

720
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:42,610
"I have lost myself in your love."

721
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:51,320
"You've left me in tears."

722
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:57,530
"Once again, you've broken my heart."

723
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,990
"You've left me in tears."

724
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,990
"Once again, you've broken my heart."

725
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,530
"You've left me in tears."

726
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,860
Hide each piece in 
different parts of the house.

727
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,150
The closer they are,

728
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,490
the sooner I'll die.

729
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:51,320
-Special Cell 
-Down down.

730
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,110
-Sanjay Kumar 
-Down down.

731
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,240
No more Police Brutality.

732
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,280
No more Police Brutality.

733
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,860
Tell Jeetender and Balbir 
to update me on Bhatia.

734
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,400
- I've to update the Joint CP. 
- Okay, sir. Right away.

735
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,070
No more Police Brutality.

736
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,950
No more Police Brutality.

737
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,110
- Down with the Delhi Police!

738
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,110
- Down with the Delhi Police!

739
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,570
Special Cell 
- Down down.

740
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,450
Sir, here's the file on Bhatia.

741
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,070
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

742
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,990
Delhi Police. 
- Down! Down.

743
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,820
Yes, sir. Sanjay speaking.

744
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,900
Congratulations, Sanjay.

745
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,530
The Ministry has decided 
to give you the President's medal...

746
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,360
...and the Ashok Chakra to KK.

747
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,200
- But sir, until the case isn't solved... 
- Sanjay, all in due time.

748
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,700
- But how, sir, our hands are tied. 
- As I said, all in due time.

749
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,070
Call up Nandita and celebrate.

750
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
If only we could get 
permission for Nizampur.

751
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,780
Dilshad is the key 
to the whole case, sir.

752
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,650
We've put in a request, Sanjay. 
But it's a little complicated.

753
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,280
- Maybe these awards... 
- But, sir.

754
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,320
Sanjay. We have put in a request.

755
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,240
- Jai Hind. 
- Yes, sir. Jai Hind.

756
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,820
We're getting medals.

757
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,400
Gallantry for us, 
and Ashok Chakra for KK.

758
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,360
Great.

759
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,700
Congratulations, sir.

760
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,320
But, what about Nizampur?

761
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,530
Nothing now.

762
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,280
They want us to celebrate.

763
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,900
Pardon me, 
sir, but even they are celebrating.

764
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,650
See...

765
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,150
The Minister is hosting 
a rally in Nizampur today.

766
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,490
To celebrate how they made 
Delhi Police dance to their tunes.

767
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,400
Delhi Police 
- Down down.

768
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,150
Delhi Police 
- Down down.

769
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,070
We have orders to celebrate.

770
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:27,780
But they didn't specify... whether 
we celebrate in Delhi or Nizampur.

771
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:48,240
Our children, their children.

772
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,650
What was their fault?

773
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,450
That they dreamed about a better future.

774
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,740
Dreamed of a brighter future.

775
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,070
They wanted to study.

776
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,320
And in order to get 
justice for our children

777
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,950
who died in the fake encounter...

778
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,360
...I am even prepared to 
take a bullet if I have to.

779
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,280
- Down with the Delhi Police!

780
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

781
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,740
- Down with the Delhi Police!

782
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,820
Our youth are still struggling even 
after so many years of independence.

783
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,450
Everyone knows.

784
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,610
Our community is being suppressed.

785
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,990
Is this only your country?

786
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,320
That officer is from Delhi.

787
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,990
We have equal right over this country.

788
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,200
Our youth...

789
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,530
Sir, that officer is from Delhi.

790
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,530
And look at their audacity.

791
00:58:52,820 --> 00:59:00,400
That same Special Cell team from Delhi 
has come here to torment us now.

792
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,280
- Down with the Delhi Police!

793
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,320
- Down with the Delhi Police!

794
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,610
- Down with the Delhi Police!

795
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,780
- Down with the Delhi Police!

796
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,320
- Down with the Delhi Police!

797
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:15,150
- Down with the Delhi Police!

798
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,780
- Down with the Delhi Police!

799
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,200
Sir. Shall we call for backup?

800
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

801
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,650
There is no point.

802
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,280
SP sir is on the line.

803
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,740
He wants you to leave.

804
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,360
Go back.

805
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,700
Talk to him.

806
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,240
Dilshad. 
- They are here to arrest me.

807
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,860
Stop.

808
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,150
Why you.

809
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,360
Move. Move.

810
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,030
How are you, Dilshad.

811
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,900
I'll leave you with sister 
Rashida and go to the market.

812
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,530
Be a good boy.

813
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,860
Greetings.

814
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,700
God Bless.

815
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,240
Oh, God.

816
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,400
- Ruksana, Police. 
- Run!

817
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,360
Hit him. Our brother is innocent.

818
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,780
We won't tolerate 
this brutality anymore.

819
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,450
How dare you barge in our house 
and take brother Dilshad.

820
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,650
- Get in, sir. 
- Come on.

821
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,740
-Get in, sir.

822
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,280
Lock the doors.

823
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,950
Yes, sir. 
Lock the doors.

824
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,070
- Let's go. 
- Drive.

825
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:40,320
Let's go, Maan Singh.

826
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,700
Shift to reverse.

827
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,740
Why isn't the car moving?

828
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:48,610
We won't tolerate Police Brutality.

829
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:54,360
- You bloody... 
- No!

830
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,070
Our child is innocent.

831
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,400
Bring Dilshad out.

832
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,070
Bring him out.

833
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,070
Don't let Dilshad go.

834
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,030
-I'll shoot. 
-No!

835
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,700
What are you doing?

836
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,950
Let go. Let him go.

837
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,900
So?

838
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:46,320
Did you like the grand 
welcome our Nizampur gave you?

839
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,320
Take this uniform off

840
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,900
and wear a leash instead.

841
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,450
Then I won't ask you 
to take any action.

842
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,490
You are right.

843
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,150
We are the government and 
they are government servants.

844
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,240
They will only follow my orders.

845
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,320
Am I right?

846
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,200
You want to leave Nizampur, right?

847
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,070
You can leave. Alive.

848
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,650
Go.

849
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,320
Hey.

850
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,320
Move. Make way.

851
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,240
- Down with the Delhi Police!

852
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,280
Let's go, Maan Singh.

853
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,360
- Down with the Delhi Police!

854
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:38,950
- Down with the Delhi Police!

855
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,110
- Down with the Delhi Police!

856
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,070
'Hi, you've reached 
Sanjay Kumar's voicemail.'

857
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,820
'Please leave your 
a message after the beep.'

858
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,240
You went to Nizampur without 
any permission or a warrant.

859
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,570
You should've left 
your resignation on your desk instead.

860
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,400
This was the most stupid 
thing to do, Sanjay.

861
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,320
Do you understand?

862
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,450
This case is over even 
before the court decides.

863
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,240
It is all over. You're finished.

864
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,820
The NHRC has finally accepted 
the petition for an investigation...

865
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,570
...on the L-18 Batla House encounter, 
or should we say massacre.

866
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,570
Maybe soon it won't be easy to 
just pick up someone from the street...

867
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,280
...and shoot them dead 
in a fake encounter.

868
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,900
The people already believe 
that the Special Cell is guilty.

869
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,990
We're just waiting for 
the court to pass judgment.

870
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,950
According to our sources, 
well known advocate Shailesh Arya...

871
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,110
...will personally defend 
the case on behalf of those boys.

872
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,490
I've made the court accept your appeal.

873
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,240
Mr. Shailesh, 
what will be our next step?

874
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,150
What can we expect exactly?

875
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,990
The Police are already 
making plenty of mistakes.

876
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,570
They even filed the FIR pretty late.

877
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,360
If the opinion is in our favor, 
the entire cell will face trial.

878
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:14,900
Listen...

879
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,030
We've been invited over to Mr. Khurshid's 
place in the evening for dinner.

880
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,530
Be ready. 
I'll send the car to pick you up.

881
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,780
Fine. But come home soon.

882
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,650
But Shailesh...

883
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,240
what if the court throws the 
case out because of some technicality?

884
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,860
Then we'll wait for the 
Police to make another mistake.

885
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,280
And the Special Cell has 
been making many mistakes lately.

886
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,530
The people already believe 
that the Special Cell is guilty.

887
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,950
We're just waiting for the court...

888
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:43,950
Hello.

889
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:45,360
Yes.

890
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:46,860
Yes, madam.

891
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,280
Yes, they have just walked in.

892
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,150
Yes, I am leaving in 5 minutes.

893
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,360
You've spoiled our entire image.

894
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,990
Just hope his encounter story is true.

895
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,860
And not some kind of an adventure.

896
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,280
Otherwise, transfer or suspension 
is too little a punishment.

897
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,780
There's no saying what 
punishment the court will decide.

898
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,490
Get the car.

899
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,200
Yes, sir.

900
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,280
The UP CM is sparing no effort 
to take advantage of this situation.

901
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,150
We finally managed to get 
this controversy under control...

902
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,820
...but look what you 
went and did in Nizampur.

903
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,860
Are we anti-minority?

904
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,490
Sir, we aren't either.

905
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,650
- We're just doing our job. 
- Please tell your officer to shut up.

906
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,860
We've already announced 
medals for everyone.

907
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,450
And now we can't go back on our word...

908
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,150
...otherwise, we will look like fools.

909
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,200
I am sorry for his misadventure 
but I believe that...

910
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,950
We're giving them medals, aren't we?

911
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,490
Huh... 
What more do you want?

912
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,950
And please don't forget.

913
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,820
The government never made any allegations 
against you for fake encounters.

914
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:05,360
Make sure you explain to him...

915
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,950
...to stop trying to be a hero.

916
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,030
Sir, if these medals are for some 
sort of Political balancing, then...

917
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,070
So?

918
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,070
So what?

919
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,030
What will you do, Sanjay?

920
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,320
- Then we shouldn't accept this medal. 
- Then don't.

921
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,030
You're free to throw it on their faces.

922
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:35,990
You will just give them an excuse to 
pin everyone on you and the department.

923
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,400
- But, sir. 
- Sanjay, please...

924
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,860
Don't you get it?

925
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:44,320
You're this close to getting suspended.

926
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:50,780
Everything you lived for, 
Fought for, and stood for...

927
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:56,360
...country, honor, 
duty, will all disappear in a snap.

928
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,400
Just like this.

929
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:06,360
What is the meaning of this life, 
effort, and courage...

930
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:13,150
...when my own country is stopping me from 
respecting its law and doing my duty.

931
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,860
It's already over, sir.

932
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,950
And it's stopping all 
of you from seeing the truth.

933
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,200
The country which allows you 
to do your duty without doubting you...

934
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:30,200
...doesn't exist anymore.

935
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:33,610
Don't behave like a child, Sanjay.

936
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:37,900
One more thing...

937
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:25,780
Don't even think for a second that 
you're not worthy of this medal, Sanjay.

938
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,030
Their method might be wrong.

939
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,570
But you earned it the right way.

940
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,740
And, don't ever forget that.

941
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,150
Yes, sir.

942
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:45,110
Late Inspector KK Verma 
and ACP Sanjay Kumar.

943
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,990
Murderers are being honored with medals.

944
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:50,360
What else can we expect 
from the government?

945
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,110
But we're not going to stop at this.

946
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,030
Our fight shall continue.

947
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,700
'Take it.'

948
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:09,610
'How many more medals do you want?'

949
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,900
'How much more blood do you seek?'

950
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,820
'You murderer!'

951
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,820
'Till when will you 
keep taking innocent lives?'

952
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:18,320
'Blood thirsty...real terrorist.'

953
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,200
'How many more medals do you want?'

954
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,990
Sanjay!

955
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,570
Sanjay!

956
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,740
It won't come off.

957
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,070
And none of this will stop, Sanjay.

958
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:02,900
If all this is too 
overwhelming for you...

959
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,820
...then at least take 
the help of a therapist.

960
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,860
If this continues,

961
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,240
you'll be finished.

962
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,820
Where is it?

963
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,530
Who?

964
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,740
Sanjay. Sanjay.

965
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,700
Sanjay. 
Sanjay, please.

966
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,610
Sanjay, stop it. 
Maan Singh.

967
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:31,240
Sanjay, please listen to me. 
Sanjay, please...

968
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,450
Where are the remaining pieces?

969
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,200
Where are the remaining pieces?

970
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
What do you want to prove?

971
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,200
Do you want to finish this for good?

972
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:35,450
Then do it.

973
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:45,740
At least this way you'll prove that your 
enemies were right and you were wrong.

974
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,610
And that you tried to 
kill those innocent boys.

975
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,700
I am tired.

976
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:57,780
I am tired.

977
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,990
Every day I ask myself 
the same question.

978
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,530
Were we wrong?

979
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,530
Was I wrong?

980
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,900
I can't take this anymore.

981
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:10,570
Is this a threat? 
This transfer request?

982
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,820
Get back to work, Sanjay.

983
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,110
I am not being allowed to, sir.

984
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:23,740
I went by the book during 
the 2-year-old investigation...

985
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,610
...and yet I lost an officer.

986
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,150
Now we are just playing games

987
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,780
instead of giving him justice 
and getting his killer punished.

988
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,070
I keep on saying this, sir.

989
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,360
Wazir said Dilshad shot KK.

990
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,070
He's the key to this whole case.

991
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:50,320
Once we have him, we can prove 
that this wasn't a fake encounter.

992
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:53,570
Dilshad, sir.

993
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,530
You know, your mistake in 
Nizampur was not that you went there...

994
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:03,530
...but it was that you 
didn't bring him along.

995
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,320
If you had brought him along...

996
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:14,320
...then we would all be pushing 
each other to take the credit.

997
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,150
Try... not to make that mistake, again.

998
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,240
Yes, sir.

999
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,780
But if you go to Nizampur...

1000
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:41,320
...then I'll have to take 
this threat to the ministry.

1001
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:50,780
So, I'd advice you 
not to go after the mouse...

1002
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:57,150
...but instead, 
lay a trap to get him out.

1003
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,400
Sir.

1004
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,650
Sir's order?

1005
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,700
There it is.

1006
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,400
I am a dancer, Dilshad.

1007
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:48,030
If I was that type, then I 
wouldn't be wasting my time with you.

1008
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,400
You are special.

1009
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,820
Even you are very special to me.

1010
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,150
Really? 
- Yes.

1011
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,820
Then I guess she must 
be more special for you.

1012
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,150
Who?

1013
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:02,610
The one whose call you wait for all day.

1014
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,070
Oh, God.

1015
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,360
I am getting a job in the Gulf.

1016
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,070
- Gulf? 
- Yes.

1017
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,820
That's what we talk about.

1018
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,610
And, will you leave 
me here to dance forever?

1019
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,360
I will take you with me.

1020
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,650
Really?

1021
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,280
Yes.

1022
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,990
- I am waiting for the phone call. 
- Yes.

1023
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,490
First, we go to Nepal, and then Dubai.

1024
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,070
Uma.

1025
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,950
Aka Victoria.

1026
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,150
I saw your plan, Sanjay.

1027
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,490
I know I am going to regret this.

1028
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,360
But, go ahead.

1029
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,360
Hurry up. Or we'll miss him.

1030
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,070
"I dwell in your eyes."

1031
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,360
"I deserve to be in your heart."

1032
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,240
"You are a traveler." 
"I am your destination."

1033
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,950
"Love can be found in abundance."

1034
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,200
"You just need to take the plunge."

1035
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,900
"Come on, take me into your arms."

1036
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,780
"What sort of a drunk is he,"

1037
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,110
"if he has no sorrows?"

1038
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,450
"That drunk has nothing left," 
"the one who doesn't have me."

1039
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:28,200
"My companion! My savior! My love!"

1040
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,450
"O my beloved!"

1041
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:36,780
"Come closer, 
let there be no unfulfilled desire."

1042
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:41,320
"O my beloved!"

1043
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,990
"Come closer, 
let there be no unfulfilled desire."

1044
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,700
"Let the beat go."

1045
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,360
Pandey!

1046
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,280
Someone find out what's wrong.

1047
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,610
Didn't pay the bill or what?

1048
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,700
Call up Yadav.

1049
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:58,450
You don't want us to 
die wanting now, do you?

1050
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,070

1051
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:17,030
"I want a beloved like you."

1052
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,820
"I don't need money or peace."

1053
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:30,150
"I want a beloved like you."

1054
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:34,700
"I don't need money or peace."

1055
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:39,360
"You are high on my 
beauty at the moment."

1056
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:43,610
"The one who sacrifices 
for me is the luckiest."

1057
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:48,570
"What sort of a drunk is he," 
"if he has no sorrows?"

1058
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:52,950
"That drunk has nothing left," 
"the one who doesn't have me."

1059
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,650
"My companion! My savior! My love!"

1060
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,950
"O my beloved!"

1061
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:03,240
"Come closer, 
let there be no unfulfilled desire."

1062
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,820
"O my beloved!"

1063
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:12,570
"Come closer, 
let there be no unfulfilled desire."

1064
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,950
Oh no, not again!

1065
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,570
What's wrong with the lights?

1066
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,610
Someone switch on the generator!

1067
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,570
Leave me. What are you doing?

1068
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:29,700
Leave me.

1069
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,740
Leave me.

1070
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,240
- Get her inside. 
- Let me go.

1071
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,030
Hey!

1072
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:52,570
You've been in the 
country for 7 years, Huma.

1073
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:55,950
Do you want to go home now?

1074
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,780
No, no, please.

1075
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,240
- My entire family... 
- My entire family depends on me.

1076
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,200
My brother is studying medicine...

1077
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,740
...and my three sisters 
are also studying.

1078
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:07,900
Right?

1079
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,110
Please, sir. Don't send me back.

1080
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,860
I will do whatever you...

1081
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:21,200
If you keep making such offers...

1082
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,070
...then you'll never go back home.

1083
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:32,030
Your future hangs 
on one simple question.

1084
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,780
I don't get it.

1085
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,950
I know him.

1086
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,400
I mean I just saw him while dancing.

1087
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:44,860
I don't know much about him.

1088
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,900
This stranger called 
your cellphone 16 times.

1089
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:04,030
As I said, 
your future hangs on one question.

1090
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,070
Congratulations, you're going back home.

1091
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,070
Sir, I can't quit my job.

1092
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:16,030
I'll be dead.

1093
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,200
I understand.

1094
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:19,740
I have the same problem.

1095
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:23,490
So let's help each other.

1096
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,610
Hello.

1097
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,450
Hello.

1098
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,860
Yes, it's me. 
Pilibhit Market.

1099
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
Close to the border. 
White Omni car.

1100
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:57,490
Number...BA-10-C-3329.

1101
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,900
Day after tomorrow morning, 7:30 am.

1102
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:02,740
First, we cross the border. 
Then go to Dubai.

1103
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,400
Boss' instructions from Pakistani.

1104
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,320
But this isn't the number you gave me.

1105
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,650
Why did we change the number?

1106
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,200
Hang up. Hang up.

1107
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,740
Just do as you're being told.

1108
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:18,740
Day after tomorrow morning, 7:30 am.

1109
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,030
Jai Hind.

1110
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:05,740
Make sure all lines are clear. 
- Clear, sir.

1111
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,780
Open it.

1112
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:46,400
All positions clear?

1113
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:48,030
Sir, in position.

1114
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,400
Sir... 
I think we're out of range.

1115
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,700
Sharma in position, sir.

1116
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:54,900
Come in, Jeetu.

1117
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:58,700
All posts report.

1118
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,150
Check if you're getting 
any signal outside.

1119
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,490
Hello. 
Hello, sir, walkie check.

1120
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,570
Hello.

1121
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,240
- Hello. 
- What happened?

1122
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,070
Check.

1123
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:37,820
There's no signal.

1124
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:38,820
Give it to me.

1125
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:42,860
Jeetu, can I ask you a question?

1126
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:48,900
Do you believe catching Dilshad 
Will be the end of our troubles?

1127
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,570
I don't have the slightest clue.

1128
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,280
This thing has gotten out of hand.

1129
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,740
The other day, 
my son was saying to me...

1130
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:57,820
"Papa, are you going to..."

1131
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:03,320
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1132
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,320
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1133
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,240
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1134
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,450
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1135
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:11,820
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1136
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,700
Did anyone see Dilshad get in the car?

1137
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,530
Sir, I didn't see anything, sir.

1138
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:16,780
No, sir, we didn't.

1139
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,200
I repeat, 
did anyone see Dilshad in the car?

1140
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,110
Sir, the car's moving 
towards Jeetender and Wazir.

1141
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,740
Sir, Sharma speaking. 
Chacha has already left.

1142
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:25,820
Sir, shall we move?

1143
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:26,780
Sir, shall we move?

1144
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,320
Shall we move? 
Do we engage?

1145
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,610
Sir... 
Oh, man...

1146
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,900
- Okay, engage. 
- Engage, come on.

1147
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:53,320
Yeah...

1148
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,320
Yes, brother. I am on my way.

1149
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:56,030
Okay.

1150
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,360
- Okay, Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

1151
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,240
Who was that?

1152
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:04,530
Saif.

1153
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,570
Just checking...

1154
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,450
...whether they are taking 
us to Nepal, or Prison.

1155
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:20,280
What is this? 
Dilshad was supposed to come.

1156
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,240
Look ahead.

1157
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,860
And just keep driving.

1158
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,950
Long Live 
- Ekta Party.

1159
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,070
What would you like?

1160
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:34,030
Momos?

1161
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,900
Hey!

1162
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:44,320
Don't you have any manners?

1163
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,070
Can't control yourself 
around a beautiful girl?

1164
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:46,490
What happened?

1165
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:48,700
Delete it right now. 
Or else I will break your phone.

1166
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:49,570
Delete it right now.

1167
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,030
See, this is what I was telling you.

1168
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,110
Take me away from all this.

1169
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
He was taking my pictures.

1170
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,860
Delete it right now.

1171
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:55,820
Beat him.

1172
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,820
He was taking my 
pictures with his phone.

1173
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,280
Beat him.

1174
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,950
They are beating him.

1175
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:01,450
I will show you.

1176
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:03,950
I will show you.

1177
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,820
- Let him go. 
- How can I?

1178
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,610
I said let him go. 
Calm down. Calm down.

1179
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,990
Jeetender, Wazir, let the car pass.

1180
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:31,070
Dilshad is not in the car.

1181
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,150
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1182
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,530
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1183
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,240
Let the car go. 
I said mission abort!

1184
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,780
Jeetender, Wazir, come in.

1185
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,950
Shit.

1186
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,450
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1187
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:51,820
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1188
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,200
- Long live...

1189
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,820
- Long live...

1190
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,990
- Long live...

1191
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:59,110
- Long live...

1192
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,900
- Long live...

1193
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,900

1194
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:04,950

01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:07,240

01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,490

1199
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,530
- Long live...

1200
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:24,110
- Long live...

1201
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,860
- Long live...

1202
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,820
- Long live...

1203
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,070
- Long live...

1204
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:32,030
- Long live...

1205
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,030
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1206
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,860
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1207
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,900
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1208
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,740
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1209
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,700
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1210
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,240

1211
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,900

1212
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:46,780
- Long live...

1213
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,990
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1214
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,530
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1215
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:52,900
- Long live... 
- Ekta Party.

1216
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,400
- Sir, we were... 
- He was just cross-checking.

1217
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,110
He's still in the cafe, 
and not in the car.

1218
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,110
Then let's get him.

1219
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,030
If he's thought this far,

1220
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,280
then he must have 
made other arrangements.

1221
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,900
Call Balbir and tell 
him to let the car pass.

1222
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,700
Okay, sir.

1223
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:09,610
Balbir. The car's heading your way. 
Don't stop it.

1224
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:26,740
Come forward.

1225
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,610
Drop the barricade.

1226
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,320
We've already spoken to Mr. Thapa.

1227
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,530
Let him through.

1228
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:46,860
Sir, uncle, and nephew are on their way.

1229
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:48,740
Sorry, sir.

1230
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,280
Yes, brother. 
I've reached safe and sound.

1231
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,070
Give the phone to him.

1232
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,320
Yes.

1233
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:57,530
Here. Talk to him.

1234
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:04,110
- Hello. 
- Yes. I'll see you on Friday.

1235
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,360
Okay.

1236
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,530
Special Cell has taken 
Dilshad Ahmed in custody...

1237
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:18,280
...and arrested the so-called murderer 
of KK Verma.

1238
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,780
According to our sources...

1239
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,110
...a special team of the Special Cell

1240
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,530
were planning for months... 
...to arrest Dilshad.

1241
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:28,110
News Express 24/7 has 
this exclusive CCTV footage...

1242
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,740
...from a hotel in Nepal.

1243
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:33,650
This is where the operation 
to arrest Dilshad was carried out.

1244
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,280
Run. Run.

1245
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:46,860
According to our sources, 
all the formalities have been done...

1246
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,700
...and the Nepal Government 
has handed over

1247
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:53,110
Batla House accused 
Dilshad to Delhi Police.

1248
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:58,740
We still don't believe that 
Dilshad's been arrested by Delhi Police.

1249
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,570
If Delhi Police doesn't let 
Dilshad go free...

1250
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,110
...then we'll start a campaign 
on a large scale.

1251
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,650
Stay back. Stay back.

1252
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:23,650
Keep them out.

1253
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,990
Don't worry.

1254
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,820
You can't escape,

1255
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:15,110
nor can we kill you.

1256
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,740
We have a motive to keep you alive.

1257
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,740
You are lucky.

1258
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,280
Ms. Sharda. Congratulations.

1259
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,320
The Police finally made that mistake.

1260
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:52,570
Mr. Arya, can you really prove 
Dilshad Ahmed is innocent in the court.

1261
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:58,530
I will prove that every officer, 
connected with this case...

1262
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:03,610
Regardless of their rank... 
...each one of them, guilty.

1263
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:09,320
The plight these innocent 
kids' families have faced...

1264
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,820
These policemen's families 
are about to face something even worse.

1265
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:17,900
"Aim for the sky..."

1266
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:20,740
KK entered from the other door, 
"Change the course of the river."

1267
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:22,450
...which was already open...

1268
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:23,450
Sanjay, look up.

1269
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,740
Now please don't play with 
your ring and your fingers.

1270
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,150
What happened at the L-18 that day?

1271
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:30,950
KK entered from the other door...

1272
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:34,240
Just look into the lens 
and answer confidently.

1273
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:36,450
At L-18, KK and Wazir...

1274
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,030
Don't hesitate, don't say er.

1275
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:41,280
Just look into the lens, 
how difficult is it?

1276
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,610
I can't do this.

1277
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,780
"Be the sea..."

1278
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,530
Sir... 
KK?

1279
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,530
"Keep the fire burning..."

1280
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,990
'Why did you arrive late?'

1281
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:04,280
"One who God protects..."

1282
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:09,280
"...can never perish."

1283
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,450
"On the path of truth..."

1284
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:14,780
It's a mental illness...

1285
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:17,900
...also known as post traumatic stress disorder.

1286
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,030
KK entered from the other door, 
which was already open...

1287
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,450
He opened fire,

1288
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:25,150
which resulted in the death of two men.

1289
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,320
Adil and Sadiq.

1290
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,070
And two of them are still at large.

1291
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,950
"One who God protects..."

1292
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,490
I'll be back...

1293
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,150
VC sir.

1294
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,700
Why don't you meet Sanjay once?

1295
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:44,780
I don't talk to murderers.

1296
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,610
You always blame the Police 
of being prejudice.

1297
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,280
But calling them murderers 
without hearing their version...

1298
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:54,950
...is also a kind of prejudice.

1299
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,320
You shouldn't be complaining 
about the police department.

1300
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,700
After all, you are just like them.

1301
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,280
Okay, but only 5 minutes. 
Only for you.

1302
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,570
VC sir,

1303
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:11,490
Sanjay doesn't talk 
more than 5 minutes anyway.

1304
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:15,900
Mr. Sanjay...

1305
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,240
Adil Amin, 
whom you claim to be your student...

1306
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:20,860
...his Allahabad University 
degree is a fake.

1307
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,280
Here's a reply from 
Allahabad University.

1308
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,070
You granted him admission 
without any background check.

1309
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,280
I could've filed a case...

1310
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,990
...but first I wanted to 
know your side of the story.

1311
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,450
It's always important to 
know the other side of the story.

1312
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,360
I never wanted to discuss 
the encounter with you.

1313
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,530
My five minutes are up.

1314
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,740
"One who God protects..."

1315
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,650
Your time starts now.

1316
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,490
One down.

1317
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:52,200
"One who God protects..."

1318
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:55,200
"Don't care whether its day or night."

1319
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,030
"Don't care about the 
distance or the companion."

1320
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:02,780
"Create such a stir that 
makes everybody wonders."

1321
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:05,530
"Don't care whether its day or night."

1322
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:08,320
"Don't care about the 
distance or the companion."

1323
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,490
"Create such a stir that 
makes everybody wonders."

1324
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:12,070
It's very important to define...

1325
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:14,070
...that this case is not to ascertain

1326
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:16,200
whether the Batla House 
encounter was a fake or not.

1327
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:20,030
This case is to prove whether 
Dilshad was present on the scene or not.

1328
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:23,240
"...cannot be challenged by anyone..."

1329
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:26,110
"One who God protects..."

1330
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,740
"...can be harmed by none."

1331
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:32,320
"The one whom God protects..."

1332
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,360
"One who God protects..."

1333
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:42,610
"One who God protects..."

1334
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:47,740
"...can be harmed by none."

1335
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,570
Shall we?

1336
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,320
Where to?

1337
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,150
To win.

1338
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,200
Good morning, sir.

1339
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:42,570
"Everyone knows the 
truth about Paradise, but..."

1340
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,740
Sorry...it's a nice thought.

1341
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,860
Your Honor, the events 
that transpired was...

1342
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:56,150
Delhi is gripped by a series of 
Bomb blasts on 13th September 2008.

1343
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,280
The Police, 
especially the Special Cell...

1344
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,110
...were under tremendous pressure.

1345
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:06,610
From the Government.

1346
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,070
And from the public to some extent.

1347
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:12,030
The real perpetrators carried 
out their job and fled.

1348
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:17,150
But the Police now had to produce 
these wrongdoers.

1349
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,950
According to local witnesses... 
...the Police were already

1350
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:24,360
surveilling Okhla University.

1351
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,820
Targets were chosen.

1352
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,030
A place was identified.

1353
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,650
A conspiracy was hatched.

1354
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:35,030
And a fake encounter was carried out.

1355
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:41,360
The Police were now keeping 
a constant watch on Batla House.

1356
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,360
As soon as I saw you, 
I knew you like her.

1357
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,950
Don't pull my leg.

1358
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:03,610
On 18th September,

1359
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,570
they took these boys in custody.

1360
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,490
Speak up.

1361
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,740
What are you going 
to say in your statement?

1362
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:11,700
We're from MI. 
- What are you going to say?

1363
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:15,530
It's not MI. 
That's IM.

1364
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,740
Indian Mujahideen.

1365
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,360
Your Honor, 
they were so brutally tortured...

1366
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:25,150
...that even on the following day,

1367
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,360
after the so-called fake encounter...

1368
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,900
...the center of focus was not

1369
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:29,400
on their numerous bullet wounds...

1370
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:31,780
...but on the lacerations on their body.

1371
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,860
But, they were kept 
in a vegetative state.

1372
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:36,990
Interesting.

1373
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:38,240
Why?

1374
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:41,950
So that the time of death 
in the post mortem report

1375
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,900
is close to the time of the encounter.

1376
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:46,990
Fantastic!

1377
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:52,450
Intelligent.

1378
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:58,070
After which those boys were moved 
to L-18 overnight.

1379
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,900
Close the curtains.

1380
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:16,820
Yes, sir.

1381
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:28,530
Hello.

1382
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:29,860
Yes, sir. 
- Yeah, we're here.

1383
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:31,360
Okay, sir.

1384
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,700
Should I dispose of them?

1385
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,610
No, sir.

1386
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:34,820
They are still debating over it.

1387
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:35,610
What?

1388
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,530
What are they still debating over?

1389
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:39,320
Yes, they are still in the meeting.

1390
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,240
Fine. Get on with the formalities.

1391
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,280
It's 4 am already.

1392
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:45,030
They have asked to wait, sir.

1393
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:46,780
This is too much.

1394
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,900
Fine, I'll wait. 
Of course.

1395
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:50,150
- Call me back. 
- Okay.

1396
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,490
Sir, please let us go.

1397
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,570
As***!

1398
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:01,240
At least let me pee in peace.

1399
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:03,700
We came here to study.

1400
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:06,780
Order some dinner for them.

1401
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:08,700
People are still 
debating over their fate.

1402
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,530
There's an entire panel 
deciding what to do with them.

1403
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,820
We'll find a connection eventually. 
Then no one's going to ask.

1404
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,900
And as morning approached...

1405
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:40,030
Congratulations.

1406
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:45,450
The panel...has granted 
you safe passage.

1407
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:47,360
We are innocent, sir.

1408
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:50,030
That's why the government is 
letting you go.

1409
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,530
Stop crying, silly boy. 
- We haven't done anything.

1410
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:54,610
- We are innocent, sir. 
- Hear me out.

1411
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,400
You guys are free to go.

1412
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:57,820
- We don't want to run away... 
- Run away.

1413
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:00,780
- I am letting you go. 
- Stop crying.

1414
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:02,110
You are innocent, I know.

1415
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,950
Run away...

1416
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,700
I said run away.

1417
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,900
Stop you bas***!

1418
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:09,280
As***!

1419
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,610
Case solved.

1420
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,280
Your Honor, B.Sc Computer Science.

1421
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:33,900
Please take a look at 
these certificates and records.

1422
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,450
All of them were innocent students.

1423
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,570
In fact, some of them 
weren't even in college.

1424
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:41,700
They are innocent school kids.

1425
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,900
Marks on the knees. 
Lacerations on the back.

1426
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,150
And even on the head...

1427
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:54,320
Next, I would like to question

1428
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:57,030
ACP Sanjay Kumar, 
the investigating officer.

1429
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,400
And I'll prove this encounter was a fake.

1430
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:04,860
And that my clients are innocent.

1431
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:06,570
Sanjay Kumar.

1432
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,450
ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1433
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,740
What is the place of 
occurrence for this incident?

1434
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:40,530
Any guy who reads the newspaper 
can tell you that.

1435
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,650
Mr. Shailesh, please stick to the point.

1436
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,400
I am sorry, Your Honor.

1437
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,070
Did you enter flat no. 108 of L-18 
immediately after the incident?

1438
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,240
- Yes. 
- Why?

1439
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:55,530
Because I heard gunshots 
coming from above.

1440
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,530
How many flights 
of stairs did you climb?

1441
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,360
What?

1442
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:09,280
It's a simple question.

1443
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,150
How many flights of stairs?

1444
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,740
While taking fire, a person 
counts his blessings...

1445
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:14,570
...not the flight of stairs.

1446
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,820
Spare me the drama, and give 
me a straight answer, ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1447
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:19,990
46.

1448
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:24,110
And did you see this boy 
anywhere whilst those 46 steps.

1449
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:28,820
No.

1450
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:32,700
But you've charged him 
for escaping the scene of crime...

1451
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:35,200
...and murdering one of your officers.

1452
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:37,900
And, how did he escape 
when you never saw him?

1453
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:45,950
My officers Insp. KK Verma 
and Sub Insp. Wazir Singh...

1454
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:48,360
...clearly saw him escape 
from L-18 Batla House.

1455
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,780
ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1456
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:53,570
Unfortunately, we cannot summon Insp. 
KK Verma here.

1457
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:57,610
Mr. Shailesh, please. Have some respect.

1458
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:01,030
I am sorry, Your Honor.

1459
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,700
Wazir Singh has clearly identified 
the accused Dilshad in this court.

1460
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,900
He's a Police officer, after all, 
his statement can be corrupted.

1461
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,240
But please don't lie in order 
to falsely accuse my client Dilshad.

1462
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:13,490
Your remaining officers claim 
that they haven't seen him.

1463
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:14,650
True or False.

1464
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,240
The Police searched their house 
and the house adjacent to it.

1465
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:22,900
So how can Dilshad still escape?

1466
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,700
This entire case is a fake.

1467
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:26,070
Dilshad was never on the scene.

1468
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,490
I am going to ask you again, 
ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1469
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:33,490
Except for Wazir Singh, did 
anyone see this boy flee from the scene?

1470
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:35,950
Answer me.

1471
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:37,400
Did anyone see him trying to flee?

1472
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,400
Don't stay quiet. 
Answer my question.

1473
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,490
- Did anyone see him escaping? 
- Objection, Your Honor.

1474
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,450
Badgering the witness.

1475
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:43,780
Objection overruled.

1476
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,450
ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1477
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:47,240
Please answer this question.

1478
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:53,070
Did you?

1479
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,610
No.

1480
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,700
We didn't.

1481
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,400
"Everyone knows the 
truth about Paradise."

1482
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,990
It's over even before it began.

1483
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,280
The whole damn case is ruined.

1484
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:41,400
- The facts of investigation... 
- Investigation!

1485
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:44,860
Nobody gives a damn about 
your investigation, ACP Sanjay Kumar.

1486
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,360
This court, along with all 
the courts around the country...

1487
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,820
...also rely on perception to an extent.

1488
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:52,650
And thanks to you 
and your investigation...

1489
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,650
...the Delhi Police are facing trial 
like murderers.

1490
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:58,240
Did your investigation reveal that..

1491
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:01,860
all the boys you arrested 
or killed were students.

1492
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:02,780
Yes.

1493
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,400
Innocent students?

1494
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,490
Like Adil, 
whom you killed so brutally...

1495
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,650
I said, students.

1496
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:11,650
I never said they were innocent.

1497
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:13,450
And definitely not Adil.

1498
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:15,820
For God's sake, 
at least tell me the truth.

1499
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,070
Truth.

1500
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:19,490
The truth?

1501
01:51:21,650 --> 01:51:23,200
Whose version of truth 
do you want to hear?

1502
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:26,030
The Police?

1503
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:29,360
Ever worn a bulletproof jacket?

1504
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:31,740
Ever been shot at?

1505
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:35,240
How can our truth be alike?

1506
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:37,110
You look for evidence.

1507
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,570
And we, a reason to save everyone.

1508
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,150
You tread carefully, trying 
not to break the norms of the law.

1509
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:45,400
We've to think about how we 
can uphold the Law by breaking it.

1510
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,490
You don't want to hear 
about the investigation, sir.

1511
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,900
But unfortunately, I have nothing 
other than this investigation.

1512
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:55,610
Nothing!

1513
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,240
These people were blowing 
up the very courts

1514
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,320
where you're hearing the 'truth'.

1515
01:52:07,490 --> 01:52:09,070
Lucknow, Faizabad, Varanasi.

1516
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:10,490
And who took responsibility 
for the blasts?

1517
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:13,490
The Indian Mujahideen took 
responsibility for the blasts.

1518
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:16,110
In fact, 10 minutes 
before the blasts occurred.

1519
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:17,450
Emails.

1520
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,610
The new way.

1521
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,400
A different style.

1522
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,360
And in this way,

1523
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,570
the Indian Mujahideen 
began taking responsibility...

1524
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,860
...even before the blasts occurred.

1525
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:31,400
Jaipur.

1526
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:33,570
13th May 2008.

1527
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:34,650
Five explosions.

1528
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,610
Look Sanjay...

1529
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,990
And this time they went a step further.

1530
01:52:39,110 --> 01:52:40,700
They attached videos 
of how they planted bombs

1531
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,860
on cycles in their emails.

1532
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,150
They were toying with us.

1533
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,700
13 blasts in one year.

1534
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,990
Making us dance to their tunes.

1535
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,150
These boys and their benefactors, 
Bhatkal Bandhus.

1536
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,780
Riyaz and Iqbal.

1537
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,820
Hello.

1538
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,650
This time it was more than three.

1539
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,650
I saw that.

1540
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,070
Very good.

1541
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:00,490
So, should I send the email?

1542
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:01,570
Of course.

1543
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,240
Okay.

1544
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:05,990
All the emails that we received 
in connection with the Delhi Blasts...

1545
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:07,450
...came from your cyber cafe.

1546
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:08,900
Here's a copy.

1547
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:10,070
What do you have to say?

1548
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:11,110
Sir, you can check the register...

1549
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,360
Don't show me.

1550
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:14,860
Birbal, shut it down.

1551
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,820
They were always a step ahead of us.

1552
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:20,400
When we started keeping a 
constant watch on the Cyber Cafes...

1553
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:23,490
...they started using 
open WiFi accounts.

1554
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,030
They made us look like fools.

1555
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:32,150
But then they got closer to 
us before we could close in on them.

1556
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:36,070
Delhi.

1557
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:40,490
Listen...

1558
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,400
Remember I told you 
to look for a place to stay.

1559
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:43,610
Now I need something a little bigger.

1560
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:45,360
Fine, I'll speak with father.

1561
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,700
- I think his boss' flat is empty. 
- I see...

1562
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:48,650
L-18.

1563
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,650
Come, brother Adil.

1564
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,360
I guess the place was 
closed for a long time.

1565
01:53:55,450 --> 01:53:56,900
No one's been living here recently.

1566
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:57,570
Hmm...

1567
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:11,200
Police Verification is necessary.

1568
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:13,990
Hmm.

1569
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,650
- Hello. 
- Hello. Come in.

1570
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:29,110
"We will continue 
to fight till the end..."

1571
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,950
"We will never let you win."

1572
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:38,360
"We will continue 
to fight till the end..."

1573
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,110
Come in.

1574
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,570
Come in. Boys.

1575
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,610
Was it a pleasant journey?

1576
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,490
"This is a battle of honesty 
against dishonesty..."

1577
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:54,610
"It's a battle between good and evil."

1578
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:59,740
"This is a battle for purity."

1579
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:04,700
"This is a battle for our goodness."

1580
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:09,860
"We fight for purity..."

1581
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:12,780
I always said they 
have been using technology.

1582
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,240
And technology is a double-edged sword.

1583
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,240
It was coming in use to them,

1584
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:20,110
and now it came in handy to us as well.

1585
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:21,860
Dump Data Analysis.

1586
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,110
We analyze conversations 
between random telephone

1587
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:27,860
numbers before and after bomb blasts.

1588
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:32,070
When some keywords like blast, 
pressure cooker, soap, goods...

1589
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:37,360
...are used in a conversation, 
we investigate those numbers.

1590
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,490
During our analysis, 
we stumbled upon an Eastern UP number.

1591
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,570
The number belonged to some Dr. Sahil.

1592
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:46,570
He ran a Unani Clinic during 
the day and recruited new boys at night.

1593
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:49,320
There was constant communication 
between these five numbers...

1594
01:55:49,570 --> 01:55:52,110
...but the calls were 
only received on PCOs.

1595
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:55,150
There was no communication 
between the mobiles.

1596
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:59,900
But Dr. Sahil, who was hard to find... 
...broke protocol once,

1597
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,740
- and called on the number in Delhi. 
- Hello.

1598
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,150
Hello, Dr. Sahil speaking.

1599
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:06,150
What happened?

1600
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:07,860
Brother Adil?

1601
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,950
According to call data records,

1602
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,360
the number on which Dr. Sahil called...

1603
01:56:14,110 --> 01:56:16,030
...was in the Okhla University area.

1604
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,450
Adil. The trump card of our case.

1605
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:20,820
Absolutely.

1606
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:24,530
The person who owned 
this number was present

1607
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:26,650
in L-18 Batla House, 
flat number 108 that morning.

1608
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:30,030
So you see, sir.

1609
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:31,740
No doubt he was a student...

1610
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,280
...but also the most dreaded operator 
of Indian Mujahideen.

1611
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,820
It's true that fake 
encounters are a reality.

1612
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:46,570
We may have done it too.

1613
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:50,030
Weapons have been planted,

1614
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,570
which we bought using our own funds...

1615
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:55,820
...in order to secure a conviction.

1616
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,150
Not because Police and Criminals 
have a dispute over some property.

1617
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:03,780
Or we're born murderers.

1618
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:08,070
Or that we enjoy killing 
and torturing them.

1619
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:10,650
Not even for the reward.

1620
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,570
The money which the government gives

1621
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:15,070
for killing a terrorist...

1622
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:19,150
...is lesser than what traffic police 
can earn in a week.

1623
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:23,240
Because Police aren't the only ones 
who break the rules.

1624
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:25,450
People do.

1625
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,900
The Police often give examples 
of the Municipality workers.

1626
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,860
If someone doesn't 
get their hands dirty...

1627
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,740
...then soon it will 
contaminate everyone.

1628
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:38,990
So did you dirty your hands for us?

1629
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,400
Does it even matter what I say, sir?

1630
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,700
You need to prove that.

1631
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,610
Can you prove it?

1632
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:58,490
Doesn't sound like that after 
hearing the defense's arguments.

1633
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,200
Do you know what a binary opposition is?

1634
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:05,070
Good vs Evil.

1635
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:09,150
The war's been on since the beginning.

1636
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,240
Between good and evil.

1637
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:13,490
We all know who wins in the end.

1638
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:15,570
So the problem is not about winning.

1639
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:18,780
It's about the price 
one has to pay for it.

1640
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:22,450
Your Honor, ACP Sanjay Kumar's 
statement tells us...

1641
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:27,650
...that IM has given us evidence 
of IM and Adil's involvement.

1642
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:31,280
Otherwise, they would never be killed 
or apprehended.

1643
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:35,030
Electronic Surveillance doesn't lie.

1644
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:40,990
You can verify my statements through 
IP addresses and Mobile CDR data.

1645
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,280
We have phone records 
of Adil and Dilshad's father.

1646
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:48,900
Dilshad couldn't explain any connection 
between Adil and Dilshad's father.

1647
01:58:49,110 --> 01:58:55,450
Doesn't that prove that Dilshad regularly 
communicated with Adil on that number?

1648
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,360
What's more...

1649
01:58:58,530 --> 01:59:01,990
After the blasts, he even 
reserved a train ticket from L-18...

1650
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:04,200
...and even traveled on the same train.

1651
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:08,360
Doesn't that prove 
Dilshad's presence at L-18?

1652
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:16,740
Your Honor, final prosecution exhibits,

1653
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,400
and the public rests.

1654
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:19,280
Thank you.

1655
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,450
Counter. 
Defence Council.

1656
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:29,820
Thank you, Your Honor.

1657
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:34,610
Does that mean you 
only went to arrest Adil?

1658
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:35,820
Yes.

1659
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:40,320
I'll begin with a good morning.

1660
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:41,860
"Good morning, sir."

1661
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:43,570
"I am here on behalf 
of Teraphone Mobile company."

1662
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:45,860
"Since you recently switched 
from postpaid to prepaid..."

1663
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:47,070
"Prepaid to postpaid."

1664
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,900
Oh yeah...

1665
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:49,530
- "Prepaid to postpaid." 
- "Prepaid to postpaid."

1666
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:51,240
- "Prepaid to postpaid." 
- "Prepaid to postpaid."

1667
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:52,320
Postpaid.

1668
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:52,860
Sir.

1669
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:55,280
Sir.

1670
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:58,320
Shall I send Jitender 
in for Adil's verification?

1671
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:01,110
Yes. I'm on my way.

1672
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,030
Sir.

1673
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:03,990
Jitu.

1674
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:05,490
Okay, sir.

1675
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,740
What?

1676
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,860
Good morning, sir.

1677
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:16,530
I am here on behalf of Teraphone.

1678
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:17,200
So?

1679
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,240
You recently switched 
from prepaid to postpaid?...

1680
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:23,240
What's the name?

1681
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:24,360
Adil Amin.

1682
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,450
That's done.

1683
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:27,150
- Are you Adil? 
- Yes, and it's already done.

1684
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:27,780
Now leave.

1685
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:30,320
Can you please confirm 
your details once...

1686
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,740
Just go.

1687
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:34,450
Doesn't your company 
know what month this is?

1688
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:35,610
- Sorry, sir. 
- Everyone's resting.

1689
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,990
- Come back in the evening. 
- Sir, what time in the evening?

1690
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:39,400
- Goodbye, brother Adil. 
- Come back soon.

1691
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:40,700
See you in the evening.

1692
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:50,820
Jeetender saw Adil Amin 
alias Bashir in L-18 Batla House.

1693
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:57,110
But we didn't know that 
there will be other armed men

1694
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,900
of this module present on the scene.

1695
02:01:01,070 --> 02:01:03,280
That's where the problem begins.

1696
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:06,360
The moment you entered L-18 Batla House.

1697
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:10,400
What were the marks 
on Adil and Sadiq's body?

1698
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:41,200
Open up.

1699
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,320
I can't see a thing, Dilshad.

1700
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,610
The view's blocked...

1701
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:47,950
Delhi Police.

1702
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:48,950
Dilshad.

1703
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,740
Dilshad.

1704
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:50,900
Sadiq.

1705
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:53,570
Hide. Hide.

1706
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:54,900
- Are we in danger? 
- Go inside.

1707
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:55,950
Hide. Hide.

1708
02:01:58,860 --> 02:01:59,700
Come here, take this.

1709
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,110
Hide over there.

1710
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,570
Adil.

1711
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,320
Open the door, you swine.

1712
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,030
Sir, the back door is open.

1713
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,740
Dilshad.

1714
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:12,240
Adil.

1715
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,450
Adil.

1716
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:15,360
Shoot him.

1717
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:43,400
ACP Sanjay Kumar, 
I repeat my question.

1718
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:45,280
What were the marks 
on Adil and Sadiq's body...

1719
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,280
When one gets shot... 
...he falls on his knees.

1720
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:52,700
He has no control over his body.

1721
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:54,570
He falls flat on the ground with a thud.

1722
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:00,450
Then what else do you 
expect to find on the body?

1723
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,570
Lacerations on the back.

1724
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:06,780
- Wounds and bruises on the legs. 
- Wait a minute.

1725
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:09,990
Take a look at this too.

1726
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:13,360
Your Honor, 
may I approach the witness?

1727
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:15,070
Thank you.

1728
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,280
Take a look.

1729
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,700
He's been shot in the head.

1730
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:26,700
Headshot wounds.

1731
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,610
How did Sadiq get shot from above?

1732
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,450
Were you guys hanging 
from the ceiling fan?

1733
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:33,990
Shooting from above?

1734
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:41,780
Your Honor, 
this clearly establishes that

1735
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:44,400
Sadiq was shot somewhere else.

1736
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,400
How?

1737
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:50,360
My knowledge about guns 
and bullets are quite okay.

1738
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:53,860
How does your statement 
get clearly established?

1739
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:55,610
In the crossfire...

1740
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:57,900
How can anyone get shot in the head 
in a crossfire?

1741
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:00,950
You must be firing like this, 
and Sadiq was firing back like this.

1742
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:02,990
He wasn't waiting to get shot.

1743
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:05,570
Or, he wasn't running with 
his head lowered like this...

1744
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,990
Exactly.

1745
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:16,610
That's how he bolted for the other door.

1746
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:18,780
Just like you did.

1747
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:23,820
In a standing position, our bullet 
would've hit him there or somewhere else?

1748
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:30,240
Your Honor, he was hit by an 
AK-47 round.

1749
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:34,360
If he was shot in close range, 
then his head would've exploded.

1750
02:05:39,490 --> 02:05:40,700
And as I said...

1751
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:43,400
My knowledge about guns 
and bullets are quite okay.

1752
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:48,900
We returned fire after 
those boys fired at us.

1753
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:52,860
The residue was found 
on Adil and Sadiq's hands...

1754
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:55,030
...which was also confirmed 
by the Ballistic reports.

1755
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:57,650
But the neighbors claim 
that you first tortured them...

1756
02:05:57,740 --> 02:06:00,200
...and then killed 
them on the location.

1757
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:02,570
When we brought them 
to the scene of the crime

1758
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:04,860
after torturing... 
...then why didn't they stop us?

1759
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,950
Was the entire University 
campus sleeping?

1760
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:11,030
It was the month of Ramadan.

1761
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:13,860
People normally stay 
awake till late in the night.

1762
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,990
They even wake up for Sehri.

1763
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:19,450
They could've said that to the court.

1764
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:22,900
But you didn't take any 
witnesses from that area.

1765
02:06:22,990 --> 02:06:23,990
Then why don't you?

1766
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:25,450
I have no objections.

1767
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,530
Thank you for the advice.

1768
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,320
I'll think about it.

1769
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:37,530
But you should reconsider that. 
You might get in trouble.

1770
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:39,320
So can you...

1771
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:42,450
When I'll ask your so-called witnesses,

1772
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:44,860
who claim to know the truth...

1773
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:48,780
...then why don't they know 
at what time and date did the Police...

1774
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:50,950
...bring those innocent 
boys on the scene and kill them?

1775
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,360
How many flights of stairs did you say?

1776
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,700
46, wasn't it?

1777
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,490
We climbed up 46 stairs 
which lead through,

1778
02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:03,450
four floors and 8 flats.

1779
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,570
And at least 60 people live 
in these 8 flats.

1780
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:13,240
Did anyone of them see 
any of us take these boys upstairs?

1781
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:19,990
Did anyone of them testify on 
your behalf proving your point of view?

1782
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:25,650
Arya sir, the scales 
are tipped in our favor too.

1783
02:07:27,490 --> 02:07:29,150
And if you're looking to settle scores,

1784
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,030
then be fair.

1785
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:35,360
It's the honorable judge's duty 
to give a fair judgment.

1786
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:38,570
My job is to ask questions, 
and yours is to answer them.

1787
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:42,280
So, please...

1788
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,740
Let's believe that your 
Police is very efficient.

1789
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:51,280
There was Police upstairs, 
Police down below.

1790
02:07:51,570 --> 02:07:54,490
And yet two boys managed to escape.

1791
02:07:55,530 --> 02:07:56,650
Ridiculous.

1792
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:01,200
Get inside.

1793
02:08:04,110 --> 02:08:06,360
Our men were looking in the direction 
of the firing...

1794
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:08,700
...and not at Dilshad and Javed's face.

1795
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:13,530
So except for Wazir, no other 
policeman could identify Dilshad.

1796
02:08:13,610 --> 02:08:14,570
You are lying.

1797
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:15,320
You brought them...

1798
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,740
If we were lying, 
we would've killed everyone.

1799
02:08:18,610 --> 02:08:20,200
Why would we arrest Tufail alive,

1800
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,820
when we knew that he could turn hostile.

1801
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:24,570
And that's what happened.

1802
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:29,200
Why would any cruel 
and stupid Police officer...

1803
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:32,110
...who stages fake encounters 
keep anyone alive?

1804
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:37,070
And say that we're 
not going to kill you...

1805
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:41,530
...so that you can, later on, 
prove Mr. Arya's theory right.

1806
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:47,110
You're trying to cover up your mistakes.

1807
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:49,150
You delayed in filing the FIR.

1808
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:52,740
Our colleague Insp. KK Verma was 
fighting for his life in the hospital.

1809
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:54,070
And we were there with him.

1810
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:56,740
People normally get 
delayed in such situations.

1811
02:08:58,240 --> 02:08:59,820
I am sorry, so did the Police.

1812
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:05,530
One of your colleagues shot KK Verma 
due to an inter-departmental rivalry.

1813
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:08,200
Your Honor, what's the point of 
presenting this hearsay in the court?

1814
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,110
Hearsay?

1815
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,900
It was clearly evident 
in the Police Headquarters.

1816
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:12,950
That's just utter rubbish 
with no evidence to support it.

1817
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,150
Your Honor, I object.

1818
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,240
Objection sustained.

1819
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:17,030
Remarks will be removed.

1820
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:19,860
Mr. Shailesh, 
stick to the facts, please.

1821
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:25,280
Mr. Sanjay, there's a picture 
doing the rounds in the media.

1822
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:27,820
During the encounter.

1823
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:30,070
KK Verma's shirt...

1824
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,900
Ashok Chakra recipient 
Late Inspector KK Verma.

1825
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:38,650
There are no bloodstains 
on the front of his shirt.

1826
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,320
This clearly indicates that 
someone shot him in the back...

1827
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:55,610
One of your Police officers 
shot him in the back.

1828
02:09:55,900 --> 02:10:01,240
I agree...there were no bloodstains 
on the front of KK's shirt.

1829
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,360
But you can ask any ballistic expert...

1830
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:07,740
Contrary to what they show in films 
when you get shot from the front...

1831
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:10,070
...the blood doesn't 
spread from the front.

1832
02:10:12,150 --> 02:10:14,110
The blood loss is from the exit wound.

1833
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:21,200
Calm down. Or you'll be shown out.

1834
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:33,280
I know that the press, 
activists, and you, have many questions

1835
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,530
about L-18, don't you?

1836
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:38,570
But I have only two questions...

1837
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:42,240
...and I am sure none 
of you have an answer.

1838
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:46,110
Your Honor, if I am allowed to ask.

1839
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:56,450
How did the Delhi Module 
of the Indian Mujahideen

1840
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:58,490
fall apart Post the L-18 encounter?

1841
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:05,700
Why no one took responsibility for 
the blasts through emails ever again?

1842
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:09,240
Second and last question.

1843
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:15,860
Till date, 
when has any inspector ended up dead

1844
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:18,360
in a fake encounter?

1845
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,860
Does anyone have a single example?

1846
02:11:23,570 --> 02:11:24,650
Anyone?

1847
02:11:33,570 --> 02:11:34,780
You may go now.

1848
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,490
I know what everyone wants.

1849
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,990
You want these boys 
to be proven innocent.

1850
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:50,360
- I object, Your Honor. 
- But they won't...

1851
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:52,650
Because some of their 
friends are telling them...

1852
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:56,070
...that this country is suppressing you.

1853
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:57,360
What is he saying, sir?

1854
02:11:57,450 --> 02:11:59,570
- Mr. Sanjay, please. 
- And you must stand up against it.

1855
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:02,530
Because our enemies 
are teaching them that

1856
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:03,740
through the Bhatkals

1857
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,950
What is this rubbish?

1858
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:06,900
Sanjay, enough. We have got it.

1859
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:10,990
No one's explaining to 
them that the entire system

1860
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:12,780
as well as the law 
is in a general breakdown.

1861
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:14,650
ACP Sanjay, I order you to go.

1862
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:17,700
The entire country and the 
world is facing repercussions.

1863
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:20,280
And not just one community.

1864
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:25,530
I don't claim that they 
haven't been treated unfairly.

1865
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:26,530
What is he saying?

1866
02:12:26,610 --> 02:12:30,240
And I cannot claim that 
their actions were justified.

1867
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,360
Please, take him out.

1868
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,740
But a responsible Police 
officer of India is not their enemy.

1869
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,950
They have only two enemies.

1870
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:40,280
Those who support their 
community in every wake of life.

1871
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:43,650
And those who oppose their 
community in every wake of life.

1872
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:48,700
Me...I am not their enemy.

1873
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,530
I am listening.

1874
02:12:50,610 --> 02:12:52,030
I want him to be proven innocent.

1875
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:53,780
Yes. Excellent.

1876
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:54,530
Amazing.

1877
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:56,110
- We won. 
- I object, Your Honor.

1878
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:57,240
What's going on in the court?

1879
02:12:57,610 --> 02:12:58,570
Order in the court.

1880
02:12:58,650 --> 02:12:59,610
Please take your seat.

1881
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:00,950
Everyone, please settle down.

1882
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:02,400
- Please don't embarrass us. 
- Will you, please...

1883
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,530
Please maintain the 
decorum of the court.

1884
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,990
Please take your seat.

1885
02:13:14,070 --> 02:13:14,650
I'll do the needful.

1886
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,610
Settle down.

1887
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:19,360
- Please settle down. 
- Please take your seat.

1888
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:20,490
What happened?

1889
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,570
You spoke for more than 5 minutes.

1890
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:25,530
Please sit down.

1891
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,860
I will remove the remarks.

1892
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:34,610
In the case of State 
Vs Dilshad Ahmed, the court...

1893
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:37,240
...wants to set an example like the one 
in State Saurastra AIR Vs Ahir Raka Khima...

1894
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:41,610
...1956, SC217.

1895
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:43,610
Where the Apex court believed...

1896
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,610
...that an honest police officer's testimony...

1897
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:48,610
...is acceptable like an honest citizen.

1898
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:50,450
'On 25th July 2013,

1899
02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:54,030
the court ruled in favor of 
Sanjay Kumar and the Special Cell.'

1900
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:56,570
'But a part of the 
society and the media...'

1901
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:58,530
'...were not pleased with this ruling.'

1902
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:03,490
'They didn't believe in an Officer 
with 6 Presidential Gallantry Medals.'

1903
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:05,240
'They kept accusing him.'

1904
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:06,950
'They kept suspecting him.'

1905
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:10,950
'Although, another fact 
came to light after three years.'

1906
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:15,860
'In a TV interview, 
a Commander of ISIS said...

1907
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:22,240
...that a boy from his group, Sajid... 
...who ran away from Batla House...

1908
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,360
Following the Batla House encounter, 
the land of India became hostile to us.

1909
02:14:26,650 --> 02:14:29,700
The intelligence agencies 
and the ATS pursued us.

1910
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:31,950
It became difficult for 
us to carry out armed actions.

1911
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:35,200
But we remained patient 
and prayed to Allah.

1912
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:38,900
He guided us and we managed to escape.

1913
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:41,280
'On that day, Sanjay Kumar and the Special 
Cell were once again proven right.'

1914
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:45,360
'Sanjay Kumar is now 
one of the most decorated

1915
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:52,450
Police officer of India with 
9 Presidential Gallantry Medals.'

1916
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:55,360
'He is in the Special Cell, 
fighting against narcotics.'

1917
02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:56,570
'They still get questioned.'

1918
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:59,280
'But those with clear 
aim and objectives...'

1919
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:06,070
'...ignore them, do their duty 
and continue fighting for India.'
