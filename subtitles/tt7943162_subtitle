1
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,520
'Awesome'

2
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,880
'Good times around the corner'

3
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,440
'Auspicious days will favor'

4
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,400
'Alandur
Trichy'

5
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,720
'A new innings and fresh beginnings'

6
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
'Joys to bloom anew
All your dreams will come true'

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,760
'This house will soon revel
fame and fortune as well'

8
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,760
'Lo and behold!
Auspicious events will unfold'

9
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Near a temple and a lake...

10
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,880
...like Goddess Lakshmi, a spouse
for the prince of this house

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
The perfect bride

12
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
In case she doesn't show up...

13
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,320
...bad events should follow

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,920
So says our own Delphi, Jakkamma

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,720
'A canopy should be raised
in front of this house'

16
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,840
Food should be served
to one and all

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,560
'Whether the future holds
good or bad for the family...'

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,720
'...rests in the hands of
the lady of this house'

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,200
'It is the oracle of Jakkamma'

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,440
'Happy days are round the corner'

21
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,120
Aravalli akka, what's news?

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
Last night I believe
our local soothsayer...

23
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,000
...predicted good events will follow
or else misfortune will fall upon you?

24
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Were you eavesdropping?

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,080
As if that's my occupation
all the time!

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
I come from a better
lineage than that

27
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,960
The wind just carried
his words into my ears!

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Good event means a wedding

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
What does he mean by misfortune?

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,640
My funeral!

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Why are you cursing yourself?

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,760
As if it can't be your son
Kuzhandhai's wedding?

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
I know of a girl
in a 'cow dung' family

34
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,520
Why don't we finalize
that alliance for your son?

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,760
I want to ask our astrologer
if wedding bells will ring for him

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,760
- Good idea
- See you

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,480
'Please come and sit here'

38
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
- Give me the horoscope
- Greetings, sir

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
5th house is occupied
by sun, moon and venus

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,760
7th and 8th houses

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
[mutters under his breath]

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Horoscope is like Lord Krishna's!

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,240
You can find him
amidst girls always

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,640
No, it's the opposite
Girls make a beeline to him!

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,480
Tomato...tomato...tomato...!

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
'We have arranged item-wise'

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,920
'Please come and buy our tomatoes'

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
Don't you have Bangalore tomato?

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,960
We don't buy from a state
which denies water to us

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,880
Buy fresh ones
from Tamil Nadu

51
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Don't start by
getting into trouble

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
Come, madam

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Tomato...toma-

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Tomato...tomato!

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Pure and fresh
red tomatoes

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Tomatoes, dear
Full of cheer!

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Tomato...tomato

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,400
He has to be on a job
24x7x366!

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,840
At the same time
he won't stick to the same job

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
True, he gets bored easily

61
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,400
'Fish...fish...fish!'

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,880
Cat fish, Butter fish
Indian spiny loach

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
'Please come
ATM also available'

64
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,320
'Fish...fish...fish'

65
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Cat fish
Indian spiny loach

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
Fish...fish...!

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,040
1st cater to the men's needs
They've been waiting for too long

68
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
'They won't look at me!'

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
I know why your brain
is working this way!

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,160
You guessed
So do it

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,640
He has business acumen
to even sell stale stuff

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,760
You bet! In case
he's unable to sell the fish-

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Dried fish...dried fish!

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
'Dried fishes of
all sizes and shapes'

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,120
Dried anchovy, dried ribbon fish,
dried tilapia fish

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
So smooth, you won't feel the fish,
beer, rice or your life slip by!

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,400
You can even use it as dowry

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,000
With guarantee and warranty

79
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
How can you offer
warranty for dead fish?

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Business tactics

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
Knowledge?

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
He can't read and
I can't tell the time

83
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Bro, 1 tea

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,520
With one vada

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,880
Don't lean on me, you mop-head!

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,960
'As if he's Shakespeare
Pretending to read!'

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,720
He'll read newspapers in Telugu,
Malayalam and Hindi word to word

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
Telugu, Sachin-

89
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Bro, finished seeing the photos?

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
No cool news to relax
or hot news to drool!

91
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,640
You must read only
Malayalam news

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,000
You read so many papers daily
On the whole what is the news?

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,120
The same news is expressed
by all of them creatively

94
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,720
No variety, huh?

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
8 hours ago...

96
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,480
...what we read in Facebook,
Twitter, WhatsApp is refurbished

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
8 hours later they print this

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,360
Newspapers were the
source of news for us

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,440
But now we feed news to the Press!

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
Where is the country?

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,920
- He beats uncle Scrooge hollow!
- Bang on!

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
Won't even extend his hand to anyone

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
Bro, how are you?

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
I don't shake hands

105
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll lose my power!

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,040
- How is business?
- You're bad at this, get lost

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not only bold
but also brave

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm worse than hero Kamal Haasan!

109
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
- What do you mean?
- In bravery!

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,920
If I lose a nail,
you'll lose your arm

111
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,400
His stars will make his tongue run

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
He'll spin yarns too

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,000
He has been going in circles

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,960
Around the same girl
for the past 3 years

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,440
(humming a film song)

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
Stop, Gayathri

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,000
Hi

118
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,080
- Wait
- Why are you hounding me?

119
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't know why I'm in love with you

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
But I love you

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,600
I hate seeing your face

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,480
Please go away

123
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,760
Just a minute

124
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
You hate the sight of me
But don't find me repulsive, right?

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,160
My folks find me offensive quite often

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
I turn a deaf ear to even that!

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
Go...go...off you go!

128
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,880
What about his wedding?

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,200
Generally people face problems
only after marriage

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
But for him...

131
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
...marriage is the vortex
of his problems!

132
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Will any untoward incident
happen because of this?

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
Yes

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,960
Plenty!

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
He has to be on his guard

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,920
He is likely to get married
only for the next 3 months

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,040
He crosses that, he won't
marry for another 6 years

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
So he has to get married
within 3 months?

139
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,640
'Story-Screenplay-Direction
Vallikanth'

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,160
1 minute, wait, Gayathri

141
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
[humming]

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,680
Gayathri, please stop

143
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
- Gayathri
- Yes

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,000
- Someone is following her
- Yes

145
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,120
How many times to tell these boys
to flirt with a pretty face?

146
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,400
Gayathri, wait

147
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Smart Alec, stop!

148
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,520
How long have you
been hounding her?

149
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,520
3 months

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,880
I've been in love and
following her for 3 years

151
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
I saw her on January 1st

152
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
On 14th wished her
'Happy Pongal' and smiled

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,640
She walked away silently
and next day wished me

154
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
That was my friend's birthday

155
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,360
On April Fool's day she claimed
she had never loved me

156
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,200
My friend Omagundam chided me
and told me to ditch her

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
- I broke up
- With me, not her!

158
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,360
Breaking up with your best friend
is the worst thing to go through

159
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
The day I apologized to him...

160
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
...was Telugu New year's day!

161
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,800
Told her I'll never
trouble her again

162
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,440
1 week...!
I couldn't take it

163
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Though I went in so easily
I couldn't come out

164
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,720
- Were you locked in?
- On April 14th I met her again

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,320
She was mad at me, I said,
'Be angry, but don't hate me'

166
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
- He praised my dialogs
- Me, huh?

167
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,800
After that, Labor's day,
Ramzan, Independence day

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,280
- Lord Krishna's birthday
- Ganesha's birthday!

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,600
All the festivals in our calendar

170
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,960
He greeted his girl
even for your grandma's funeral!

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,240
Why make him babble?

172
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Even Diwali, Milad un-Nabi,
and Christmas-

173
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
The festival of lights in Tiruvannamalai

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
He goes quite often

175
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Even on Children's day
I am running behind her like a kid

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
So she is my girl

177
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Looking at her, ogling,
spying on her, drooling

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
...making a pass, honking

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Don't try any of these with her

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
- That's my job
- We are jobless anyway!

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
Whose side are you on?

182
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
- You
- Then hit him

183
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,960
Hey! Why tell me all this?

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
How dare you retort!

185
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,720
Why did you hit me?

186
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,280
Buffalo!
Punch him

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Get lost
Rascal!

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
- Like it?
- No

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
Is that why you stuffed yourself?

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,640
Hunger knows no taste

191
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,200
- Did you see my horoscope?
- Yes, I did

192
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,040
You told everyone, if I don't
marry within 3 months

193
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,400
...I won't get married
for the next 6 years?

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes, I said so

195
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,800
You should've told me first

196
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,600
Now I've wasted 6 days

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,360
Only 2 months
and 24 days left

198
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Why ruin my life, ma?

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
You were following a girl!
I thought I'll clinch that alliance

200
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,520
That won't work

201
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
Shall I try talking to her?

202
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
You've been in love or what?

203
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
To find a bride for you
I don't have to fall in love

204
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,000
Being a girl is enough

205
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,760
But she should be a girl, right?

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,080
Who...?
I sent men to hit you?

207
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,480
Who is your son?

208
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
How can you ask me this?!

209
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
- Don't you know my son?
- No

210
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
Hey, come here

211
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,120
He's my son

212
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,160
Hey, if you like him say 'yes'

213
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,480
Otherwise say 'no'

214
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,080
Don't laugh derisively

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,040
I can't help laughing
looking at your son!

216
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,600
Does she think she is
God's gift to mankind?

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
Hey! Who the hell is he?

218
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
Hey, I have no clue
who he is

219
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,400
2 or 3 fellows followed me
One of them must have hit him

220
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,680
For your stupid face,
2 or 3 chaps hit on you?

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Don't pick a fight with me

222
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Ask whoever hit him

223
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
Don't you dare yell at me

224
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
My son-

225
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,680
Why do you interrupt
our conversation?

226
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,480
Let me 1st talk to her
Then your turn

227
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,160
Do you love my son or not?

228
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
3 chaps are interested in me

229
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
Which is your son?

230
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
My son has been in love with you
for 3 years, don't you know him?

231
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
I know chaps who are in love
for 4 or 5 years diligently

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,400
I don't know them

233
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,320
This bashed up face
is also one among them

234
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,600
What is this, son?

235
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,480
Kuzhandhai, come here
Find out what's in her mind

236
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
This chap, huh?!

237
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,680
If you're disrespectful
I'll clobber you

238
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
All that's fine, do you
love my son or not?

239
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,960
I don't love him
nor anyone else

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
Okay, you don't have to
be in love at all

241
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Why get into that unholy mess?
Also time is running out

242
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,040
We'll fix the wedding
straight away, pick a date

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
Wedding...?

244
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Are you deaf or what?
Didn't hear me?

245
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,320
Are you a mother or a mack?

246
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,720
Don't be so offensive, Gayathri

247
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Get lost!

248
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,800
- Why are you begging her?
- She just insulted me

249
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,520
Instead of defending me
you're pleading!

250
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,000
- Poor amma!
- Get lost!

251
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,920
'Amma, where are
you rushing to?'

252
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
'Don't do anything drastic, ma'

253
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Why are you yelling?

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
- This is my house
- You run and save her

255
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,960
I'll hang myself to death

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,640
Please come out, ma
This isn't our house

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
A female insulted me
in the most vile manner

258
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,720
Instead of slapping her cheek...?!

259
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,480
I can't live hereafter

260
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll die

261
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,760
Why do you hurt me like this?

262
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
I am worried for her

263
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,960
- Old lady, move
- Clear out

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
I'll just hang myself

265
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,360
Why should I be insulted
because of you?

266
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,960
Why should I live
having given birth to a son like this?

267
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,920
Take out the tiles

268
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,400
Why are you removing the tiles?

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
To give cable TV connection!

270
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,960
- She's about to hang herself
- Commit suicide, huh?

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
Gayathri, if that lady
commits suicide...

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,600
...I'll make sure you vacate

273
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,800
Go, bang the door

274
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,880
Have you gone
to the police station?

275
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,040
Ma, why are you doing this?

276
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,720
'Don't come this side
Sit over there'

277
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,040
This has become a routine for you

278
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
You come out

279
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
- I can't cut it, get down
- I'll hang myself

280
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,440
Don't untie it

281
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,520
'Narrow escape'

282
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,040
Why do you do this, ma?
This is the 93rd time

283
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
You try to commit suicide
every 2nd day

284
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
Trying to pacify you
is real torture

285
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Your silly prank will end
in disaster one day

286
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,720
If any door is open...

287
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
'...you step in with a rope
to hang yourself!'

288
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
- Brother?
- What...?

289
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,280
93rd time, huh?

290
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
She does this often?

291
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,920
Not often, uncle
All the time

292
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
That's her entertainment

293
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,520
She'll do it twice a month

294
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,840
Usually in a relative's house

295
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
But this time, lucky you!

296
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
That lady is mad as hell
and running

297
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,480
That's a different lead
We'll know tonight

298
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
What lead?

299
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,840
Nosey parker!
You'll go deaf if I hit you!

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Amma!
Step mother!!

301
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,800
'Why is she hogging like this?'

302
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,440
Looks like I won't
have any dinner left

303
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,600
- 'Let me taste 1 dried fish'
- Take your hands off

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,680
'Delicious!'

305
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,240
'No wonder she's relishing it'

306
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,360
Amma...?

307
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,600
What happened to you?

308
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,200
Why did you want to die?

309
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,360
You should deep fry
dead dried fish

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,640
And be alive to cherish us
eating it with relish!

311
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
'She cares two hoots!'

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,240
Why did you want to die?

313
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,640
I'll hit you with my broomstick

314
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,160
Kuzhandhai

315
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,360
Let's go see that girl from
that 'cow dung' family at least once

316
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,240
How can I set my heart on
another girl right away?

317
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,720
I fell so quickly in love
I can't come out that easily

318
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
Just open the door
and step out

319
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,880
What silly excuses!

320
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,600
- Ma, what happened to you?
- Junk fellow!

321
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,000
'Are you a mother or a mack?'

322
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,520
'Ma, why are you doing this?'

323
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,560
Ma, why are you sleeping at night?

324
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Spoiling my sleep!

325
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
I don't know what you'll do

326
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
We'll meet the girl
you suggested

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,080
Fix that alliance
and I'll marry her

328
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,560
'What happened to him?'

329
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,480
'Keeps changing his mind!'

330
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,040
We haven't seen the bride
You're talking of dowry!

331
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,920
What's wrong with my son?

332
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
Then why don't you
bring him on a horse?

333
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Where are both the grandmas off to?

334
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,440
To buy coconut

335
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,880
Why has this maid
caked her face with make up?

336
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,240
Howzzat?!

337
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,960
We are seeing a bride
for my son Kuzhandhai

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
I am so glad to hear this
Wish you luck

339
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
I am still a bachelor

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,640
This bride has a sister?

341
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,560
Sridevi...my dear?

342
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,520
- Come, dear
- Kamal Haasan is waiting!

343
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,800
She is coming
Why keep nudging me?

344
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,800
Do you have the habit
of going to the gym?

345
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,200
- Did you notice?
- Yes, I did

346
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,720
You like this 'Miss Bun', huh?

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,880
She doesn't seem the right catch
for you, kindly avoid

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,520
Why are you saying so?

349
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,840
Beautiful girls are like lightning

350
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
They will vanish in a flash

351
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,120
She is like a lamp
She will light my life steadily

352
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,920
Who can change your fate?

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Go, stick your head
on the rail track!

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,360
Keep quiet!

355
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,760
Where does the groom work?

356
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
He's a commando in the army!

357
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,960
- I was just being funny
- Shut your mouth

358
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,760
He's a vegetable dealer

359
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,600
'He is very sincere in his job'

360
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,080
His job changes
according to the season

361
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,080
He'll sell fish

362
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,680
He'll dry left over fish
and make money in that too

363
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,200
- Retail business?
- He's such a big scientist!

364
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,240
I told you to reject her
right in the beginning

365
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
She's rejecting you

366
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,520
It's such a shame!

367
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,040
Forget it

368
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,960
We are thick skinned when
we get insulted, that's all

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
Some are lucky in
their 1st attempt

370
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,880
Others may have to
try 2 or 3 times

371
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Will take off in
course of time

372
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,360
Keep try
Keep on try

373
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,920
What do we do next?

374
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Look for the next bride!

375
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,720
What a lousy job
Like a roadside Romeo!

376
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
'Orange...orange...orange'

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,360
Please come and buy
Fresh orange orange

378
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,080
1 kilo is Rs 50 but we give you
a discount, only Rs 40

379
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,800
Hello, Ranjitha
How is Swami Nithyananda?

380
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,560
Orange...orange...or-

381
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,960
Malgova...ripe mango, exotic!

382
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,880
Make up your mind

383
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,640
Are we selling oranges or mangoes?

384
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Aunty turned our orange into mango!

385
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,200
Her husband is coming out of jail
Want him to go back?!

386
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Malgova...orange...orange...!

387
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
How much longer will we
yell and sell, road to road?

388
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,440
To sell tomatoes for 5 and 10 bucks,
is a back breaking job

389
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,960
Let's plan something

390
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,200
I agree

391
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Even if we earn
no one respects us

392
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,880
That's why I can't even
find a bride easily

393
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,600
Let's take a magnificent shop
in a market for lease in Chennai

394
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,760
Get into wholesale business

395
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
Let's do it
Long live India!

396
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
- Trust your mother to call
- Pick up

397
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,280
Tell me, ma

398
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,640
'We are seeing a bride in Ponmalai'

399
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
'Come home early'

400
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,760
Only you can do this, ma

401
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Only yesterday a girl rejected him
That scar hasn't healed as yet

402
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,440
Won't he feel bad
if you see another girl?

403
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
I won't feel bad
Give me the phone

404
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,160
No scar or bar, ma

405
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,360
All that's healed

406
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,640
Let's go tomorrow, ma

407
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,880
Only 2 months left

408
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,800
Please mom

409
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,440
'Okay, let's go'

410
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm feeling giddy
Give me an orange

411
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,600
Look who is coming

412
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,120
Our dear motor-mouth!

413
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,640
Hello, Aravalli akka

414
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,360
Where are you off to
with son and monkey?

415
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,760
- Wine shop
- Coming?

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
'Seeing' a bride for my son

417
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,600
What is this?

418
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,960
If it's just once, it's alright

419
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,160
But does it look good if you keep
announcing you're bride hunting?

420
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,760
'Charcoal' is going overboard

421
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,400
What about the girl from
the 'cow dung' family I suggested?

422
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,280
That girl did not like
my son selling vegetables

423
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,440
- Really?
- Don't disturb amma and that ghost

424
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,600
Her walk reminds me
of a pumpkin rolling

425
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Let her keep rambling

426
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,880
If we say we are vegetable vendors
we will be looked down upon

427
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Say it as 'market' in English, no-

428
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,080
Add 'ing' to 'market' and say
he is into Share Marketing

429
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,280
What if they ask details?

430
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,520
From the market, we share
Keep it simple, okay?

431
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,080
I'll do all the talking
Follow me silently

432
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,160
'Malliga, when did you come?'

433
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,280
Hey, don't forget
my improvization

434
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,960
Zip your lips, eh?

435
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,840
Karunkuzhali

436
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,640
Come and greet our guests

437
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,440
'She's hidden like the heroine
in Bharathiraja's films'

438
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,280
'Show your bright face soon'

439
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,560
Greet everyone, my dear

440
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,120
Icing on the cake!

441
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,040
She has powdered
her face with coal

442
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,920
Even I don't like her
Let's scoot

443
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,360
That's alright
Color can be corrected

444
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,960
She has good features

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
Like my mother

446
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,160
- He's insulting you!
- How could you?

447
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Keep quiet, ma

448
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
Just 2 months left
for me to decide

449
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,440
Or else I must wait for 6 years
I can't be celibate for so long

450
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
- Leave it
- Let me say 'yes'

451
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
You'll resort to Family Planning!

452
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,360
What's the groom doing?

453
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,080
We are busy talking

454
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,360
I wanted to know your profession

455
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,680
Ah...yes...work

456
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
- We are into marketing
- Yes

457
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,600
Marketing?

458
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
- What is that?
- You nitwit!

459
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,840
Share marketing, huh?

460
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
- Yes...yes
- Exactly!

461
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,680
He isn't dim at all!

462
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,680
Share marketing is dicey

463
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
Suddenly rises
Fluctuates a lot

464
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,080
Is it an elevator?

465
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,960
'Many big shots have invested heavily
and committed suicide'

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,800
In the last 6 months
25 suicides in Tamil Nadu

467
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,240
216 in India

468
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,240
In the global level, 989 victims
died because of this share market

469
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
- Beautiful!
- Clap for him

470
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,720
I've invested in millions
Lost every single penny

471
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,000
And now renting
this run-down house

472
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,920
You didn't die, huh?

473
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,400
'It's like gambling'

474
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,160
The groom I'm looking for...

475
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,480
...can even be a peddler selling
vegetables or even dried fish!

476
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,960
'Traitor! You used
big sounding words'

477
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
Even if he earns Rs 200 a day

478
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,680
...he should stand on his own feet

479
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,160
He should be self sufficient
And work hard

480
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
Head is spinning, eh?

481
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,560
I'll smear dung on your face
when we step out

482
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,640
Trying to add fuel to the fire?

483
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,040
Get up, let's go

484
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,880
'Appaaaaa'

485
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
Let's escape

486
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,480
Listen, God often tests
only the good hearted

487
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Definitely

488
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,840
Why did he target you?

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Bad God

490
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
This too shall pass!

491
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,360
It went above my head

492
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,280
If tomorrow I become like Ambani

493
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,480
...such experiences will be useful
for my autobiography

494
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
I should fill at least 250 pages

495
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,560
A book with only 65 pages
will be a damp squib!

496
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,000
My autobiography
shouldn't be a song book

497
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,160
It must be part of
the school syllabus

498
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,920
Call her, unable to bear this insult
she's planning to hang herself

499
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
Ma...amma!

500
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,480
Don't try suicide again, ma

501
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,920
We can't rescue you
from the rooftop, ma

502
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,560
Listen to me

503
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,680
If we save her
we are in for a dried fish feast!

504
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,880
Maaaa!

505
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,040
High five!

506
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,680
Please pump water for me too

507
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,920
Yesterday she had such a long face

508
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,880
'What is bothering you
Aravalli akka?' I asked

509
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
'Not 1 girl wants to
marry my son' she said

510
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,160
Who will fall for her son?

511
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Don't you agree?

512
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Thinking he's Mr World or
something, she is so damn picky

513
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,560
That black pot will
only get a matching kettle!

514
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,920
Kuzhandhai, don't be upset

515
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,880
There's someone for you out there

516
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,680
100% she will be devoted to you

517
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
She will love only you
till her last breath

518
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,560
We just have to find out
where she lives!

519
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,920
Why are you staring at me?

520
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,760
Come here
What happened?

521
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
My wife beat me up, sir

522
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,040
That's common in most houses

523
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,560
Tomorrow is our MLA's wedding
Make all the arrangements

524
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
I'll come and collect the payment

525
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,560
"Cash, dough, dollar, rupee, money
Peso, pound, paisa, paper money"

526
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,680
How can they waste that cake?

527
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Why are you back so soon?

528
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,840
What's this decoration in aid of?

529
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Hey...'Attack'!

530
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,840
Head deep in debts and
you show off with false prestige!

531
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,200
What about the catering order?

532
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,560
MLA cancelled the wedding order

533
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,880
He fixed a big catering firm from Madras

534
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,680
Whether local or out-of-towner
the basic recipe cannot be changed!

535
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,680
But no one can beat my flavor

536
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,880
I'll get my daughter married in this
same town with a feast to remember!

537
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,880
Shelve your daughter's wedding aside

538
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,480
You haven't paid interest
for 2 months

539
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,000
You settle that first

540
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,880
If not this MLA, some other
politician, if not A, then B

541
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,200
I'll fleece someone
and settle my debts

542
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,680
Let's play a game of cards

543
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,040
"Don't look down upon girls, buddy"

544
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,120
"Don't you have sisters, tell me?"

545
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,560
'Rotten tomatoes!'

546
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,040
Not a single girl in this town
is suitable for us

547
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,760
I've received an alliance
40 km from here

548
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,320
Let us go and look up that girl

549
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,600
We have done this so often, ma

550
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
How many girls will reject me!

551
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,760
Usually a video is shot of the wedding

552
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,320
But I have shot my life
in all possible angles

553
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,720
And I have a portfolio

554
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,120
You show my photo and
I'll come once they agree

555
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,280
I've crossed that stage with them

556
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
You just have to decide

557
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
Let's just see her in person

558
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,520
She's right
Tomorrow is a holiday

559
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,360
We'll make it a jolly trip

560
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,440
Let's go with a mindset
she'll reject and humiliate you

561
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
How will you be upset?

562
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Am I being funny?

563
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
I'm ridiculing him
and he's laughing

564
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,600
I don't like this formality, ma
You tell the whole world about it

565
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,840
When every girl I see rejects me
I feel so humiliated, ma

566
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,360
So do we!

567
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,640
I won't tell a single soul, dear

568
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,040
- Swear on a stack of betel leaves
- I'll go and get it

569
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,680
What new nonsense is this?

570
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,880
What is this promise?

571
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Go freshen up, sleepy face!

572
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,800
Like father like son!

573
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
She pampers him and
dances to all his tunes

574
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
Promise me now

575
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,120
- You too
- I promise

576
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,840
Regarding formally 'seeing'
a bride for you, I swear

577
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
- We won't blab to anyone
- We will blabber!

578
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,760
What did you say now?

579
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,640
His hearing is sharper than a knife

580
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
We won't blabber

581
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,240
Listen to my idea
to keep this under wraps

582
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,960
Got it? Go now

583
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,040
So tough to get
1 square meal here

584
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,880
Ma, I'm going to Trichy
for my friend's wedding

585
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,600
'He's so depressed, he is
forever in a groom's attire'

586
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,720
'We should also be
on our guard I think'

587
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,760
'Why is this pregnant pig
coming towards us?'

588
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,280
Why are you walking
without 'Kuzhandhai'?

589
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
If I was married
kids would tag along

590
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,400
- You don't wave your wand
- Fat hopes!

591
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
He thinks he is funny

592
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Not 'Kuzhandhai' as in 'kid'
but your friend

593
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,080
Don't know where he is
I'm off to the market

594
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,480
You're wagging your
tongue too much

595
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,280
I'll stuff and snuff you in this sack

596
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,160
You and your amphora-mouth!

597
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,920
- She's a bad influence!
- He called me a frog-mouth, huh?

598
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,080
Akka, in this same way
my mother-in-law ridiculed me

599
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,080
She hinted I croak like a frog
I lost my cool one day

600
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,760
I mind my own business, no?

601
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
She provoked me

602
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,800
I picked up the grinding stone
and smashed it on her head

603
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,160
And closed her chapter
Now she smiles at me from a photo!

604
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,280
Hey! Paechi

605
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm off to the temple
Keep an eye on my house

606
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,480
Okay , akka
Pray for me too

607
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,320
Wonder whose head will roll today

608
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,160
New trick, huh?

609
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,080
Akka, something fishy
in their stories

610
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,520
All 3 of them are spinning
different tales

611
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Maybe they are seeing
another bride for him?

612
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,760
As if the stink of a dead fish
can't be sniffed!

613
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,680
How are you, Aravalli'ka?

614
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Where are you going?
Got the ticket?

615
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,160
The chap in the next stop
who gets in will buy

616
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,720
Let me add the BGM here

617
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
[humming]

618
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
'I hate your face
Turn away'

619
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,560
'Look at your face in the mirror first!'

620
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,320
'They are sitting very casually'

621
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,000
Sister, is he the one?

622
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,520
3 tickets to Allur

623
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Money?

624
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,080
The chap in the next stop
who gets in will pay

625
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
Shameless!

626
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,800
3 tickets

627
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,040
Rs 18

628
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,920
You are a group of 3
Why sit separately?

629
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,080
We have a vow to fulfill
for Lord Ganesha

630
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,600
- Mind your business
- You look like Ganesha!

631
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,560
'Allur
Tanjore'

632
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,440
How much farther?

633
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
My legs are hurting
Will you ask that man?

634
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,320
- Which is Balu's house?
- 'Attack' Balu, huh?

635
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,000
The yellow house over there

636
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,480
'Attack' Balu

637
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,600
Even the name spells danger!

638
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,120
'MLA's son is coming'

639
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
Greetings, brother

640
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,080
'Who is he?'

641
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
'Looks like a computer graphics toy!'

642
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,080
'Why has he covered his face
with a moustache?'

643
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,720
The mother looks like she will
take good care of our daughter

644
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,880
But his friend looks
like a boogeyman

645
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,320
Looks like this is a decent family

646
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
Even after looking at the father's face?

647
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
Don't joke

648
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,720
How are you?

649
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm fine

650
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,160
Buddy, your search ends here

651
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
How are you so sure?

652
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,760
Obvious from the parents' faces

653
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,360
The girl will be sad
she was born to them

654
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,560
Imagine how my sister
will look, if I had one

655
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,080
'How will his sister look?'

656
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
Beyond imagination

657
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,440
Same with your bride now

658
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,440
Magizhini, serve coffee
to our guests, dear

659
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,880
You can sniff the aroma of
my daughter's coffee 10 towns away

660
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,640
Is he your real father?

661
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,080
Did you take a good look?

662
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,680
You bet I did

663
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
She's soooper

664
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,840
How can I even express my joy?

665
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Click a snap, quick
I'll need it later for 1st look

666
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll make it a teaser!

667
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,480
Just ensure her father's
wild face doesn't butt in

668
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,280
She looks good

669
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,640
Why are you fiddling
with the phone?

670
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,960
Uploading aunty-virus

671
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,600
You go inside

672
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,000
To hit on another man's wife is a crime

673
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,760
- Another man's wife
- Of course

674
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,360
She'll anyhow reject you

675
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,880
Then she'll marry someone else

676
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,400
Let's scoot before she chases us out

677
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll go first
You follow next

678
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,120
'Attack' uncle, I'll step out
to take a call from USA

679
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,360
No rush, take
your own sweet time

680
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
'I am unable to bear your torture!'

681
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,960
She's a stunner

682
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
She'll reject me for sure, huh?

683
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,760
It's a feather in your cap
if such a stunner rejects you

684
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,320
It will add to our family pride

685
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm okay even if she rejects

686
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,960
Hello, buddy, buy a big bottle
of booze for tonight

687
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,040
'What's the occasion?'

688
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,200
So-so looking girls
reject him left and right

689
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,520
This one is a chic chick

690
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,280
She'll surely say 'no'
Call the gang and be ready

691
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,360
- 'For what?'
- To lament as usual

692
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
This groom should say 'okay'

693
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,960
God...somehow make her say 'yes'

694
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,400
'God, make her agree
I'll light a special lamp for You'

695
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you like the groom?

696
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,200
- I like him
- Shall we agree?

697
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,200
I like him as well

698
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
- What now?
- Wait patiently

699
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,680
Let them open up

700
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,200
We can fix the date

701
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,760
My daughter-

702
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,400
We think so too

703
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,120
Even you like her?

704
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,840
She likes me?

705
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,160
We can fix an auspicious day
next week for the engagement

706
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,400
He is agreeing to this alliance?

707
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,280
Fix it on a day
the market is closed

708
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,880
We run a wholesale business

709
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
We will be slightly busy

710
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,760
Heavy loss even if we shut
our business for a day

711
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,480
Yes, uncle, very soon we intend
opening a branch in Chennai

712
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,040
So we get vegetables
delivered daily

713
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,000
Sure, aunty
You just need to pay

714
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,000
I just committed a big order

715
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,400
Can be settled next month

716
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,320
Don't turn up at my doorstep

717
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,240
He's asking for some money

718
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,360
These chaps thrive on bad timing!

719
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,960
You should be in the right state
of mind to give money, right?

720
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,360
Buddy, did you notice?

721
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,160
Of course, I did

722
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,280
Looks like we hit the jackpot

723
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,440
This will be our personal bank

724
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,440
You get married first

725
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,800
We'll usurp everything

726
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,800
We are very happy
Have a safe trip back home

727
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,560
I don't normally shake hands

728
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,960
I will lose my power, right?

729
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,400
He will give his hand only to
our daughter, note that point?

730
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,200
Of course I did

731
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,080
Thank you
Godspeed

732
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,040
Uncle, wake up your mother
She's fast asleep

733
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,280
'Simpering idiot!'

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,360
- Wait
- Why?

735
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,560
Turn back and see her

736
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,320
Why?

737
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,840
I think of you as Cupid
Don't lose your touch!

738
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,320
I know the girls from our village will
hide behind a window and eye the groom

739
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,360
Are you sure?

740
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,720
My dear lad

741
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,440
"With her 'squid' eyes she caressed me"

742
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,840
"My heart most willingly
set itself on fire soulfully"

743
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,400
"Her waist tempting
Her bosom tantalizing"

744
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,760
"My head and mind went a-reeling
with this enchanting feeling"

745
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,560
"Was she created from clouds cottony?"

746
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,080
"This temptress makes
my mind spin dizzy"

747
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,560
"I am her 'kumkum' red
on her pretty forehead"

748
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,960
"She devoured me whole
heart, body and soul"

749
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,480
"She kills me, this darling
without any warning"

750
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,520
"I've lost myself; helplessly
Let me know if you find me"

751
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,520
"Butted by her bovine eyes
shall I die with a happy sigh?"

752
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,880
"Bewitched by this darling
shall I scorch in her breath sizzling?"

753
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,280
"Like spinach her silken tresses"

754
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,960
"This warrior has fallen defenseless
for the eyes of this princess"

755
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,520
"She is the soothing
smoke in my beedi"

756
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,080
"She is the froth in
my beer spiritedly"

757
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,440
"She's the heroine I
every film I see"

758
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
"Daughter-in-law is she
on TV soaps soppy"

759
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,520
"If she comes home you know
thunder storm will also follow"

760
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,040
"If she stands near me, my dear
like the 'bachelor button' flower"

761
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,400
"I need soda sprinkled on me
for I'll faint in sheer ecstasy"

762
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,840
"Like a lithe banana
stem is this lassie"

763
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
"I befriended her to
make her my lady"

764
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,480
"She's no 'dosa' ordinary
But roasted crisp with ghee"

765
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,640
"Trust me
She's so tasty"

766
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,240
"She is sweet watermelon juice
I'm just a lame, useless piece"

767
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,600
"No one can hold a candle near
my darling angel here"

768
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,320
"You're my yearning daily
like the 1st sip of morning tea"

769
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,600
"With her dove eyes, she touched me"

770
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,240
"My heart lit aflame spontaneously"

771
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,560
"Her dainty waist tempting
Mountainous curves tantalizing"

772
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,040
"My heart and mind a-reeling
I'm left with no other feeling"

773
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,000
"Was she woven from clouds cottony?"

774
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,480
"This glamdoll makes my mind spin wantonly"

775
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,840
"I am her 'kumkum' red
on her fair forehead"

776
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,280
"She swallowed me whole
heart, body and soul"

777
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,760
"She kills me, this darling
without any warning"

778
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,240
"I've lost myself; hopelessly
Let me know if you find me"

779
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
- Rasathi is missing?
- Kuzhandhai's wedding

780
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,040
That's the talk of the town

781
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,040
Aravalli akka, you think
we are here to watch a film?

782
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,680
You went to see a bride
for your son

783
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,800
We are very keen to know
what was the outcome

784
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,240
Why don't you give us
a detailed account?

785
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,240
As if you are letting me talk

786
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,720
The girl we saw is
like an angel!

787
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
She is highly qualified

788
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,360
A daughter-in-law
who goes camping?

789
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,760
It is 'comp-ooter'

790
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,120
Are you still stuck in this village?

791
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,000
What are you old cronies doing
sitting here on this porch?

792
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,360
Hey Kuzhandhai

793
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,480
We are happy
you're getting married

794
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,840
You should be wearing
a silk shirt like a groom

795
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,440
You're wearing a shirt
that looks like our skirt!

796
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,440
Okay, I'll wear your skirt as a shirt
or cover myself as a bedspread

797
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,760
Forget that, grandma

798
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,000
Why do you have
a traffic signal on your forehead?

799
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,560
- Sooper
- What rubbish!

800
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,800
All the chatterboxes and old hags
go and do something useful

801
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,600
Hey old football, clear out

802
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,600
Sweet is ready and so is
Gayathri's rivet to nail her!

803
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,360
Blaze of fire, bro
Close in on her, go

804
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,880
Get down now!

805
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,440
Why are you following me?

806
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,680
Didn't like your face
So following your back!

807
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,720
I told your mother
I don't want to marry you

808
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,920
- Now what?
- Bro, pass the sweets

809
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,840
Sweet, huh?

810
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,040
- Take 1 and share 50-50
- Birthday, huh?

811
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,080
Be blessed

812
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Who are you to bless me?

813
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,240
Thank you for rejecting me

814
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,120
I've seen a girl
who resembles an angel

815
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,920
Imagine, waiting for you to reciprocate
Then taking you out on a date

816
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,200
'He loves going blah blah blah'

817
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
Get married and walk
with our kids on the road

818
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,400
Bah! Disgusting to even
think of all that

819
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,920
Is your head spinning?

820
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
If you talk like this
even my body will spin!

821
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,840
It has to spin

822
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
How often I've circled you!

823
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,920
99% of the boys run behind girls
more than the earth rotating

824
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
This is his own dialog

825
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,120
Look here with
your eyes wide open

826
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,880
Take a good look

827
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,200
Don't grimace
Get lost!

828
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,560
Why waste our time!

829
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,480
Anyone will be scared
seeing your face!

830
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,680
"Into my life walked an angel
No more hassles, only miracle"

831
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
Who is our next target?

832
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,000
Coal powder face Karunkuzhali

833
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,360
Looks like Trichy bus stand
Gate is missing

834
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,840
Karunkuzhali's father

835
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,160
Come out

836
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,280
Why are you sleeping
at such an odd hour?

837
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,720
- That's routine
- Is that so?

838
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
- Hey, come out
- Make it fast

839
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,720
Don't we have other houses to visit?
Whole family is dark

840
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,040
Come out, you wig head!

841
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,800
What brings you here
so late, with a trousseau tray?

842
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,400
I told you right then

843
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,360
I don't approve of a groom
working in the share market

844
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Did you know the shares of
most companies are rock bottom now?

845
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,200
We haven't come
to finalize this alliance

846
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,080
- We are here to thank you
- Why?

847
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,800
I have found a girl
like an angel

848
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,920
Hey Pig-face!

849
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,320
- Don't call him that in front of me
- Sorry, bro

850
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,920
He thinks he is Bill Gates
Sharing news on shares

851
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,320
Look at this pseudo-nerd face!

852
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,600
You invested in the share market

853
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,800
Do you have the receipt?

854
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,600
3 coffees, 6 fritters
Totally Rs 54

855
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,320
We came the other day

856
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,880
Take it

857
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,880
You missed out
2 bottles of water

858
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,320
- 2 bottles?
- Yes

859
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,480
[muttering]

860
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,640
- Rs 94 then
- Tips Rs 6, huh?

861
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,440
Let them share
Rs 3 each

862
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,160
Don't go near her

863
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,920
I told you not to go near her
You never listen

864
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,680
Take the flower
out of your hair

865
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,640
Bro, this spirit-face is
my mother-in-law to be?

866
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,520
This fritter face
my father-in-law?

867
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,840
Aiyaiyo! Disgusting
to even imagine it!

868
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,160
He is taking a royal dig at you
You're standing like a buffalo

869
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,520
Take this and
make juice for your family

870
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,920
- Become fair at least then
- Charcoal family!

871
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,840
Who is she?

872
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,160
Stick-face!

873
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,720
1 minute

874
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,160
I never rejected you

875
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,680
I thought this tin-box was
the groom and said 'no'

876
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,840
If I you are the groom...

877
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,440
...I am 'double okay'!

878
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,320
- What a crappy family!
- My 9 planet-mascot!

879
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,880
I was wandering
with Saturn by my side!

880
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,800
I must thank my friend and not you

881
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Thank you, bro
You saved me

882
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
Now that you've seen
my best friend, see you!

883
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,880
Didn't you shoot
my 'making' trailer?

884
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
Show it to her family

885
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,200
Trailer isn't necessary
'First look' will do

886
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,440
Take a good look
This is my bride

887
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,120
Look at it as long as you want
She'll soon belong to me

888
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,680
'Show it to her father'

889
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,680
Had your fill?
She is an angel

890
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,680
- He's deriding me, ma
- Get lost!

891
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,480
Crowd, disperse

892
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,080
'Show is over'

893
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,840
'Why are they both hitting on him?'

894
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,480
What's with you, huh?

895
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,000
Kuzhandhai is 'sold out'
Don't get it?

896
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,680
Kuzhandhai is no longer
available, clear out

897
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,600
Jobless females!

898
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,520
- I want to dance now
- Is it so?

899
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,520
- You should join me
- Show me

900
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,240
This is too tough for me

901
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,840
Will you follow me?

902
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,000
"My mother's earring, 'jumki'
my father stole discreetly"

903
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,200
"My mother guzzled quid pro quo
my father's beer in toto"

904
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,880
That vegetable vendor
has got an angel for a bride

905
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,760
Yesterday his mother Aravalli
was sitting on her porch

906
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,320
Bragging away to glory she has
found an angel for her son

907
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,160
What gives her so much joy
rubbing salt on others' wounds?

908
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,240
Let's see how long
she will keep bragging

909
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,760
'Torture started, huh?'

910
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,760
'200000 loan shark!'

911
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,680
50,000!

912
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,480
Why don't you pick that darn phone?

913
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,160
As soon as 5th of every month dawns
all the loan sharks call me

914
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,800
- Switch it off
- Is it okay if they come home?

915
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,040
I want my breakfast soon

916
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,360
I'll shower and eat

917
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,520
Inform 'Attack' Balu
the headcount from our side

918
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,360
Hello uncle,
it's me Kuzhandhai

919
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
Hello, Kuzhandhai

920
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,600
Is it aunty?

921
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,560
Aunt, where is uncle?

922
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,000
Uncle is in the restroom

923
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,680
- Hello
- Hello

924
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Your voice is garbled

925
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,200
I'll give you another number
Note it down

926
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,800
I don't believe this!

927
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,160
I can't hear

928
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,960
- Hey stupid fellow
- Stupid huh?

929
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,720
[whispering]

930
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,760
Who is it, dear?

931
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,840
Our relative

932
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,920
What happened to your voice?

933
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,680
Money lender

934
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,280
Don't tell him I am here

935
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,360
Bro, aunt is a little weird

936
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,240
Wants me to call her in another #

937
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,240
Won't you talk
to her hereafter?

938
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,600
How can I?

939
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,320
You think she is testing me?

940
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,080
I should be extra careful now

941
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,960
Ganesan

942
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,320
Moorthy

943
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,360
Subbhaiya

944
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,920
Your sister has to be present

945
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,240
- What do we do?
- Too late now!

946
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,560
No one wanted to marry me

947
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,880
Won't anyone volunteer
to be my sis?

948
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,000
Shall I bring my girlfriend?
She is like a sister to you

949
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,320
We can all go in a van

950
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,760
Why hire a van
for the 'flower' ritual?

951
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,120
Ask them to come
by bus directly

952
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,840
Then your guests won't turn up
Is that okay?

953
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,840
Keep quiet

954
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
We should spend
for our function

955
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,400
She beats Uncle Scrooge hollow!

956
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,200
Aunt is calling from her # now

957
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,880
It's wrong only if she calls from
another number, talk to her

958
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,360
- I'll talk later
- Pick up the call

959
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,120
What are you both whispering about?

960
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,240
- Nothing, ma
- Write down the list

961
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Moron!

962
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,400
Chokupandi

963
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,000
Rosa akka

964
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,880
What weird names!

965
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,480
Are they even worth inviting?

966
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,960
I feel like pelting them

967
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,720
What is sir's name?

968
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,400
- Omagundam
- 'Fire pit', huh?

969
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,000
Your phone is ringing!

970
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,280
'Your hobby is to take a dig at me!'

971
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,840
- Hello
- Hello, what?

972
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,680
Why didn't you call me?

973
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,920
- Matter of respect, aunt
- Aunt, huh?

974
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,440
I'll clobber you
I am Magizhini

975
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
Magizhini

976
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,080
- Bro, Magizhini it seems
- Then continue

977
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,480
Yes, don't shout

978
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,600
How many guests
for the 'flower' ceremony?

979
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,320
About 50 of us

980
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,440
Why so many guests
for this simple ritual?

981
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,160
We will bring many flowers!

982
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,040
No need
Just call 20 people

983
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,680
We can't organize
a feast for so many

984
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,480
- Okay
- What, 'okay'?

985
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,520
- Say 'Okay, di' affectionately
- Okay, dear

986
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,520
Don't talk in a husky voice anymore

987
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,880
- Why?
- I am getting goosebumps

988
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,520
Okay

989
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
Good night

990
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,760
Even I am feeling odd

991
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
You are already looking dazed
Clear off!

992
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,320
[devotional song]

993
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,800
- 1 minute
- What?

994
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,960
I am getting engaged formally
2 days from now

995
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,720
Don't follow me
That's it

996
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,600
[indistinct chatter]

997
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,520
Why did this politician call me?

998
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,160
Is the MLA in?

999
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,720
He's in a resort in Koovathur!

1000
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,160
Bro, 'Attack' Balu is here

1001
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,760
Hello, Balu
Please come

1002
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,920
'Welcome seems too hearty!'

1003
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,400
- Good morning
- Please sit

1004
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,360
Sit down, Balu

1005
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,960
Good morning

1006
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,640
Greetings, Balu

1007
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,840
'Why are all these
money lenders trooping in?'

1008
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,920
'Do they plan to
beat me to a pulp?'

1009
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,040
'Bonus, huh?'

1010
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,160
- Why did you want to see me?
- Where is the groom from?

1011
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,680
You've arranged everything
without a word

1012
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,280
What is his profession?

1013
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
He is a wholesale business man

1014
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,120
He supplies vegetables
to Andhra, Kerala and Karnataka

1015
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,960
According to the season
he changes the items

1016
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,160
Expect me to believe this?

1017
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,960
Only what can't be sold here
you'll trade outside

1018
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,880
Your daughter has
a groom right here

1019
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
What are you saying?

1020
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,320
Our MLA's son Gemini Ganesan
is in love with your daughter

1021
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,200
Love, huh?
My daughter?!

1022
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,040
He insists he will marry
only your daughter

1023
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,400
My daughter and
this politician's son?

1024
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,320
He cancelled my catering
for his daughter's wedding

1025
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,080
And brought in
caterers from Chennai

1026
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,200
How will he accept me
on equal terms?

1027
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,800
Which youngster listens
to his parents these days?

1028
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,680
Think about my proposition

1029
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,680
Your groom-to-be
is just a middle man

1030
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,280
But this lad here
owns 100 acres

1031
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,880
He is a big shot

1032
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,760
He is just a mediator

1033
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,360
- What, man?
- Leave all that

1034
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,520
'Isn't this God's will?'

1035
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,240
He cancelled your catering order
a few weeks ago

1036
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,560
But now he is at the mercy of
your daughter for his 3 meals a day!

1037
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,960
Why are you serving tea?
Serve juice

1038
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,120
Whatever it is, my son-in-law
must be on his way for the engagement

1039
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,200
How can I stop him or the guests?

1040
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,440
So many weddings have been
stalled in the last minute

1041
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,320
This is just an engagement

1042
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,680
'We'll tackle him'

1043
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,600
'He seems a good choice'

1044
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,200
Balu, drink this mango juice

1045
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,320
25% of your loan has been
paid by our bro here

1046
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,440
Imagine how he will
pamper you after the wedding

1047
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,800
You wanted a sister
for the ritual?

1048
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,520
- My girlfriend
- I can see for myself

1049
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
What can you see?

1050
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
He is jealous of our combo

1051
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,200
Has everyone left?

1052
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,440
- Shall I ask uncle?
- Call him

1053
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,960
He is not even worth calling

1054
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,920
Shut up! Otherwise he will
create a ruckus

1055
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,240
Uncle, we left
What about you?

1056
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,000
Akka, have you left?

1057
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,480
We saw 23 girls for him
No one was the right catch

1058
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,200
'Sivaraj from Chennai'

1059
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,560
'You asked for a shop on lease
That's finalized now'

1060
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,160
'Come next week and
pay up the advance'

1061
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
- Okay, anna
- Hey bro

1062
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,520
We got the shop in Koyambedu

1063
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,680
- Really?
- Magizhini is our lucky mascot

1064
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,040
- Thanks to my girlfriend
- I'll clobber you

1065
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,000
Buffalo! I'm praising you
Don't stamp my foot

1066
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,080
He has finally found a girl

1067
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,760
What twisted logic!

1068
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,000
What are you saying?

1069
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,120
Our guests are on the way here

1070
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,760
How can you change
your mind now? Don't, dear

1071
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,960
It's our daughter's future

1072
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,200
This is a prestigious alliance
Go inside

1073
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,320
- Don't keep chatting
- Uncle is calling

1074
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,200
We will be there
in half an hour

1075
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,120
Don't come, my wife's brother
doesn't like your profession it seems

1076
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,280
Not only that

1077
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,440
He wants his son
to marry my daughter

1078
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,520
So this function is cancelled

1079
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,880
What do you mean, uncle?

1080
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,080
We have already left
How can you stop-

1081
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,000
- He is asking us not to come
- Let me speak

1082
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,920
Anna, let's discuss it in person

1083
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,280
We are close by

1084
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,440
It won't work, madam

1085
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,960
I am cancelling this alliance

1086
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If you still come
I'll resort to violence

1087
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,120
Don't be angry

1088
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,040
Go inside

1089
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,800
Why are you doing this?

1090
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,920
Why did he change his mind?

1091
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,920
Call everyone and
tell them not to come

1092
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,960
- Uncle, where are you?
- Outside the bride's house

1093
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,480
Don't go inside

1094
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,880
I heard about it
Can I go in and talk to them?

1095
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,240
Not necessary

1096
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,720
I don't mind falling
at their feet and pleading

1097
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,920
We don't have to
lose our self respect

1098
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,360
Please leave

1099
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,800
I think we have a puncture

1100
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,600
Amma, please stop

1101
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,160
'Let's see how long
she will keep bragging'

1102
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,560
'Are you a mother
or a mack?'

1103
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,320
'Does it look good if you keep
announcing you're bride hunting?'

1104
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,400
'Who will fall for her son?'

1105
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,720
'He is likely to get married
only for the next 3 months'

1106
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,080
'He crosses that, he won't
marry for another 6 years'

1107
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,640
We said 'no'

1108
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,520
They came forward and agreed

1109
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,840
Call and give her
a piece of your mind

1110
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,400
She is dead meat, man

1111
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,200
I thought you're beautiful
It won't work for me

1112
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,280
'I wanted to reject you'

1113
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,120
Only your father said 'yes'

1114
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,720
Now why are you
giving us some lame excuse?

1115
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,280
'Yes, I am only a fish vendor'

1116
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,000
I am a shameless fellow

1117
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,320
Are you an angel?

1118
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,080
'Can't I find anyone else?'

1119
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,720
You will marry someone
worse off than me

1120
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,880
Your parents will watch you suffer

1121
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,280
Sorry

1122
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,600
My mother and I pleaded
and fought with my father

1123
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,120
They have brainwashed him

1124
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,280
'I understand your situation'

1125
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,760
After seeing me

1126
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,920
...you told the girls who rejected you

1127
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,600
...that I'm an angel

1128
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,600
'I heard you were so happy
and you derided them'

1129
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,800
Tomorrow, you will land up here

1130
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,160
I am marrying a girl
who is an angel

1131
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,720
You'll yell at me, right?

1132
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,560
I won't step inside
a temple hereafter

1133
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,160
If I go, I will pray to God
for you to get a better bride than me

1134
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,000
What can girls like me do?

1135
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,560
We can only cry
without anyone's knowledge

1136
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,840
Or we can upload our feelings
as status in WhatsApp

1137
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,160
Our freedom is limited

1138
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,520
She feels really bad about this

1139
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,440
Amma is running over there

1140
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,600
- Amma, please stop
- Stop, amma

1141
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,320
'Please stop, ma'

1142
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,280
- Amma, wait
- Listen to me, ma

1143
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,000
'Let's go back home'

1144
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,480
Ma, please

1145
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,120
Amma, wait

1146
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,000
Don't run

1147
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,320
Bro, give me the phone

1148
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,240
Wait and watch
what I do to him

1149
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,320
- Tell me
- Yov! Balu

1150
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,200
You cancelled my wedding
all of a sudden

1151
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,320
'I won't forgive you'

1152
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,400
My mother tried to end her life
and is in a critical condition

1153
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,240
Just like how you humiliated us...

1154
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,040
...I will do the same to you

1155
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,440
I will make you regret
missing such a good groom

1156
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,760
I'll insult you
in front of everyone

1157
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,480
I want to see you suffer

1158
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,560
Hey! Listen

1159
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,000
'She and her damn apology!'

1160
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,600
- What is it?
- Nothing, ma

1161
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,360
Here...drink this

1162
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,240
Royal pain, I swear!

1163
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,400
Watch your step, ma

1164
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,400
Slowly, you can make it

1165
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,920
My legs are killing me

1166
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,200
Open the door

1167
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,240
Careful

1168
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,920
Sit down gently

1169
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,960
Gently

1170
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,160
Lift her feet

1171
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,320
Ouch! Careful

1172
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,840
Ma, let's stop all this 'looking' at brides
and matching horoscopes for a while

1173
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,480
If you don't get married
within the next 2 months

1174
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,680
...you have to wait
for 6 long years

1175
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,960
I don't believe in astrology

1176
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,320
Instead of being rejected all the time
I would rather wait for 6 years, ma

1177
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,200
As if my 'wife' is yet to be born!

1178
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,200
As far as I know
this scheme is over

1179
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,880
I know she is already there

1180
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,680
Fine but where?

1181
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,280
Let's go to Chennai and focus
on our wholesale business

1182
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,560
- Okay
- That's all

1183
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,440
Stay with me
for just 2 months

1184
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,360
Go to Chennai
when I am on my feet again

1185
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,640
Okay, ma

1186
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,040
Take some rest
We'll be back soon

1187
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,040
Don't keep your feet
in the edge, shift a bit

1188
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,440
I'll get you fresh mutton soup

1189
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,840
We'll tell Sivaraj we'll come
to Chennai 2 months from now

1190
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,760
Hey! Why is she sending me
'Good morning' messages?

1191
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,560
Going overboard
enquiring about amma

1192
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,640
Don't get hyper

1193
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,160
It's a big deal getting
a message from a girl!

1194
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,680
Reply adding 'very'
in good measure!

1195
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,400
- What 'very'?
- Very very good morning

1196
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,600
Be generous!

1197
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,640
How can we blame her
for her father's misdeed?

1198
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,840
Let's go

1199
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,720
Let's eat here

1200
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,520
'Take your hands off your armpit'

1201
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,640
God knows where he's fiddling!

1202
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,320
Banana leaf substituted by paper!

1203
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,840
She's asking if you ate?

1204
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,440
Hey! You're bang on

1205
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,120
Bro, when a girl is pining
for you day and night

1206
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,200
...means you are in her heart

1207
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,480
None of my business, but check her
WhatsApp status and display picture

1208
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
Bro, check this out

1209
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,520
I told you so!
Serve me some 'sambar'

1210
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,720
When an angel smiles
at you, don't ignor-

1211
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,000
Hello...what are you up to?

1212
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,840
What does she think of herself?

1213
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,040
How does it affect her
if I eat at the right time or not?

1214
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,640
She asked you...?

1215
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,880
You messaged and she replied, right?

1216
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,720
Yes, bro

1217
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
"What happened, my precious?"

1218
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,960
Hey!

1219
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,760
Why is Tamannaah upside down?

1220
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,520
Do I resemble Tamannaah?

1221
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,800
Buddy, I'm missing her terribly

1222
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,320
- Let's go see her
- To be attacked by 'Attack' Balu?

1223
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,520
I'll be buried alive, no way

1224
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,320
Son roams like a street dog
Mother is sleeping like a log!

1225
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,040
I love your mole

1226
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,800
Why did you come now?

1227
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,440
- Go
- I came to see you

1228
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,440
My father may show up

1229
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,320
Bye

1230
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,280
I want to talk to you

1231
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,640
This evening we are 'seeing'
the minister's daughter for you

1232
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,720
- No way
- I'm talking to you

1233
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,440
I'll only marry 'Attack' Balu's daughter

1234
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,600
I'll clobber you!

1235
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,000
Still pining for her?

1236
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,040
Not now but always
she is my sweetheart

1237
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,760
You spurned your love
for money and power

1238
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,840
You married a minister's sister

1239
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,320
I can never be like you

1240
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,000
If you force me to marry
the minister's daughter

1241
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,600
My mother is no more
I'll denounce my bond with you

1242
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,280
And walk out of this house

1243
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,040
Hello

1244
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,240
Hey...!

1245
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,000
Will you come over
to meet me now?

1246
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,920
You want me to get
beaten up by your father?

1247
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,520
How about a 20-20?

1248
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,680
What is that?

1249
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,320
You come 20 km to meet me

1250
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,760
I'll come 20 km to meet you

1251
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,560
We'll meet half way
in the usual lovers' haunt

1252
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,080
I'll be there

1253
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,040
Okay

1254
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,680
"My firebrand darling"

1255
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,520
"Your beauty zaps me;
I'm floating"

1256
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,120
"Lost track of nights and days"

1257
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,640
"Floored, on the ground
I lie in a daze"

1258
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,960
"Girl who fights with me"

1259
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,840
"In your laughter lovely
I crumble to dust dizzily"

1260
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,720
"I'm a coin tossed on
the wall, I fall flat"

1261
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,720
"I am your cheerleader, howzat!"

1262
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,760
"Benumbed seeing you
my limbs don't move"

1263
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,880
"Though night creeps in
I can't sleep even a wink"

1264
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,360
"You made me swirl in a whirl
full 360 degrees circle"

1265
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,560
"You collided into me
with mother's love unconditionally"

1266
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,280
"I don't get it, dear
I'm in a haze, unclear"

1267
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,920
"Your eyes mesmerize me
Lifting my spirits to infinity"

1268
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,680
"My fiery girl dazzling"

1269
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,440
"Your beauty bewitches me;
I'm floating"

1270
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,320
"Lost track of date and days"

1271
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,320
"Floored and dumbfound
I lie in a daze"

1272
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,280
You do all this for your mother, huh?

1273
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,720
Why don't you talk to your husband?
Maybe he will consent now

1274
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,880
You try talking to that man

1275
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,960
But still

1276
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,960
I try

1277
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,280
Try my level best, okay?

1278
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,600
"If you stand before me unexpected
I become a string of flowers scented"

1279
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:51,360
"Without a goodbye if you leave me
like a cowrie shell in mancala I'll be"

1280
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,040
"Hey! My innocent princess
I feel like a coconut crushed to pieces"

1281
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:02,840
"I'm crumpled in thoughts of you, dear
for our love to merge sure and sincere"

1282
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,720
"Tempting teenage-girlie
I no longer feel hungry"

1283
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,640
"Since our 1st hug
I'm bitten by the love bug"

1284
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,440
"Think of you 24x7 wherever
I'm not fibbing, I swear"

1285
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,400
"I'll die if you leave me
I'm not kidding, sweetie"

1286
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,040
"I'm not joking, dear
Not teary eyed either"

1287
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:22,200
"Till this moment, according to me
There is no one like you, absolutely"

1288
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,920
"My firebrand darling"

1289
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,880
"Your beauty zaps me;
I'm floating"

1290
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,560
"Lost track of nights and days"

1291
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,720
"Floored, on the ground
I lie in a daze"

1292
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,400
"Hey! Girl who fights with me"

1293
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,080
"In your laughter lovely
I crumble to dust dizzily"

1294
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,080
"I'm a coin tossed on
the wall, I fall flat"

1295
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,640
"I am your cheerleader, howzat!"

1296
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,000
- You know Aravalli madam
- Yes...so what?

1297
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,160
She asked our daughter's hand again

1298
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,320
I'll murder you

1299
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,320
And say you died of a heart attack!

1300
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,600
I anticipated this

1301
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,960
Only if he doesn't object
it's a problem

1302
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,720
Let me 1st become financially strong
and then fix our wedding

1303
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,720
Okay then

1304
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:10,360
"I was a stony terrain, arid and bare
I turned into a pond thanks to your care"

1305
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:16,200
"Your lotus-red eyes alluring
bring the best feast in me recurring"

1306
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,840
"Like slicing a palm fruit deftly
in your eyes you've imprisoned me"

1307
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:27,680
"I stood tall, touching the skies yonder
With just a whisper you made me surrender"

1308
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:33,440
"Your love turns me into a bunch of keys
dangling on your waist to do as you please"

1309
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:39,280
"You made a bull out of me from a mere deer
Why do you hoard me like a treasure, dear?"

1310
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,000
"You make up after a fight
You flirt with delight"

1311
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:47,080
"You offer yourself to me
Day and night selflessly"

1312
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,680
'Chennai
Koyambedu'

1313
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,200
"Your beauty zaps me; I'm floating"

1314
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,960
"Lost track of nights and days"

1315
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,120
"Floored, on the ground I lie in a daze"

1316
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,080
'Kuzhandhai Wholesale Vegetable Shop'

1317
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,280
Why isn't he picking the call?

1318
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,240
Why aren't you
picking amma's call?

1319
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,840
She's jobless!

1320
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,080
Talk to her

1321
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,280
Bro, don't pretend to work

1322
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,720
How are you, son?

1323
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,040
No complaints
Top of the world!

1324
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,240
Don't beat around the bush
Come to the point

1325
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,360
What is Magizhini saying?

1326
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,920
Same old story

1327
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,280
Her father dislikes me

1328
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,120
How does that matter?

1329
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,520
She likes you, right?

1330
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,080
Ask her if she's okay
with a register marriage

1331
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,960
We have just 6 days left
as per our astrologer's prediction

1332
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,880
We must get you married by then

1333
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,640
I'll try to convince her

1334
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,760
- Hang up now
- Sneezing smell!

1335
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,640
If lovers want to get married...

1336
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,680
...the parents won't accept
or bless them

1337
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,080
Only if we get married
they will come around!

1338
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,320
Pack your bags and come away

1339
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,720
So I will just walk
out of my house

1340
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,400
I'll get the 'idli'
You prepare the chutney

1341
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,720
We can run a mobile eatery
and survive, okay?

1342
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,160
- We can add 'parotta' to our menu
- By all means!

1343
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,200
First talk to my mother

1344
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,560
How can you throw such a bombshell?

1345
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,800
There are no auspicious dates
in these 6 days

1346
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,240
Isn't the date fixed based on
the auspicious time usually?

1347
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,840
Why don't we change it
to an ordinary day?

1348
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,520
How can we break tradition?

1349
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,920
Once in a lifetime event
We should be choosy

1350
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,400
8th and 9th day after New moon
are considered inauspicious

1351
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,760
But those days also have
certain auspicious hours

1352
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,640
'It's just our mindset, aunt'

1353
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,960
Somehow with your weird logic
you've convinced me

1354
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,160
How many guests on your list?

1355
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,320
May be around 40-50

1356
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,040
In that case from our side
will it look good...

1357
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,400
...if only Magizhini and I
show up for the wedding?

1358
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,800
You have a point
Then listen to me

1359
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,480
Should you invite everyone
without uncle's knowledge?

1360
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,000
What are you suggesting?

1361
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,400
Wow...!

1362
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,680
I can't believe how wonderful
a son-in-law we have got!

1363
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,520
Buddy, this Friday I'm getting
married at the temple

1364
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,240
- You must come
- Super news

1365
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,440
The wedding may or may not happen

1366
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,280
What nonsense is this?

1367
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,400
- I fell in love with a girl
- I know

1368
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,320
- Her father is a holy terror
- Then?

1369
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,280
In case he gets wind of the venue...

1370
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,120
...and brings the police to stop it

1371
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,480
Don't get upset

1372
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,520
I've arranged the feast
at a hotel, nearby

1373
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,600
If we get married bless us and eat
Otherwise enjoy the feast!

1374
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,760
Inviting me for
your wedding or a riot?

1375
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,080
My wedding is almost a brawl
Our astrologer has predicted it

1376
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,440
I can handle it, come

1377
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,040
The alliance that clicked on both sides
was cancelled at the engagement stage

1378
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,600
She loves that boy it seems

1379
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,760
Clobber you
What audacity!

1380
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,480
Tell her I will
butcher and bury her

1381
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,480
Brother, don't get tense

1382
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,480
She's ready for the last resort

1383
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,760
She's adamant
she will marry only that boy

1384
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,440
Yesterday she tried committing suicide

1385
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
I stopped her
in the nick of time

1386
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,280
And promised her
I will find a solution

1387
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,080
I have arranged their wedding
this Friday in a temple in Chennai

1388
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,280
As her uncle and aunt

1389
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,560
You are my brother
So as her uncle you should...

1390
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,520
...conduct the wedding for me

1391
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,040
Keep this news a secret

1392
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:41,800
Especially my husband should not know
You should take that responsibility

1393
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,680
Shall I take leave?

1394
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:52,720
My dear, our daughter has to
attend an interview in Chennai

1395
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,120
How long will she sit idle
and jobless at home?

1396
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,520
Why don't you let her
attend this interview?

1397
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,200
I realize she has a point

1398
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,400
Will she get a fat salary?

1399
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,320
It will be a lump sum

1400
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,560
Then this Thursday and Friday

1401
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,400
We can send her
for this interview

1402
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,880
Listen, the company
sets the interview date

1403
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,320
- How can you decide?
- You are outdated

1404
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,040
Astrology is trending
as a fashion now

1405
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,760
This company owner
is into karma-astrology!

1406
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,040
As per her horoscope

1407
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,120
...you should tell which day is good
Thursday or Friday?

1408
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,800
You are an almanac maniac!

1409
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,160
I meant you can refer it

1410
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,960
'Rohini' star
Taurus sign

1411
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,840
Wednesday, Thursday, 8th and
9th day from New moon day

1412
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,640
Both the days are so-so

1413
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,040
Friday seems okay

1414
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,160
- Ask her to go on Friday
- You think so? Okay

1415
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,320
This will be her 1st trip
to Chennai to get a job

1416
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,200
How can she go alone?

1417
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,680
If you accompany her...

1418
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,640
...you will be her lucky mascot

1419
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,920
Mandharai...come here

1420
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,720
I'll be back

1421
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,440
Are you mad?
Why do you botch things up?

1422
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,240
Imagine if he comes with me!

1423
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,240
You don't know his psyche

1424
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,000
If I say 'yes'
he will say 'no'

1425
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,320
Trust me

1426
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,760
Only I'll be coming
with you to Chennai

1427
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,360
Oh no! Mandharai

1428
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,480
These interviews are a pain
You accompany her

1429
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,480
I told you so?!

1430
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,680
All of you should be
in 'action' mode

1431
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,480
Remain alert also

1432
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,320
And most importantly

1433
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,080
If you see any policeman

1434
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,520
The signal is 'B'

1435
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,760
Then all of you must hide...okay?

1436
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,160
Hey...come here

1437
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,280
Are you attending
a Party meeting?

1438
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,240
Give it to me

1439
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,520
He looks like Sellur MLA
How did he come here?

1440
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,440
[Kalakeya language in 'Baahubali']

1441
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,800
Give me the sacred ash

1442
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,280
Long live Magizhmadhi!
'Baahubali' I and II!

1443
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,000
Mix this sacred ash in the lake

1444
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,440
Pay attention

1445
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,560
Don't stick together in 1 spot

1446
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,640
Spread and be alert

1447
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,760
Only then it will be easy to escape

1448
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,040
Go now

1449
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,640
Still they are in threes
like cricket stumps!

1450
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,640
Priest, did you overhear
our conversation?

1451
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,720
As long as you didn't, it's fine

1452
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,720
[Holy chant]

1453
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,880
Where is everyone?

1454
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,720
'She isn't picking my call'

1455
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,760
'What is she up to?'

1456
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,400
- Chant faster
- Auspicious time is nearing

1457
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,960
Bride, groom, friends & co
Oblivious and obvious, please come

1458
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,920
Coming

1459
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,960
Sit down, quick

1460
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,600
Priest, will you speed up?

1461
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,280
Stop your singing
Bless the sacred thread

1462
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,960
Don't be a pain
Finish your chant fast

1463
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,200
How many 'Swahas' will he recite?

1464
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,000
Good lord! This man
is calling me nonstop

1465
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,560
Pick up, you lazy lump!

1466
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,560
- Give the sacred thread
- Good time is yet to start

1467
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,440
Forget time and tide
Do the needful

1468
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,160
- Whom should I give?
- Give it to me

1469
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,800
Son-in-law, catch!

1470
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,840
'I tie this sacred thread around your neck
O maiden with auspicious attributes'

1471
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,880
Knot it 6 times instead of thrice
for a very strong bond

1472
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,480
Thank God, we didn't
face any problem

1473
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,240
So you think!
This is just the beginning

1474
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,600
If my husband gets to know of this
blood bath it will be

1475
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,400
He's calling me again
I'll be back right now

1476
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,720
How long I've been
trying to reach you

1477
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,480
Don't you know to answer?

1478
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,360
We just came out of the interview

1479
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,600
Is that so?
How was the interview?

1480
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,120
Sooper!

1481
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,800
Lower your tone and chant!

1482
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,880
'Both of you stand-'

1483
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,560
Everything went off well

1484
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,600
Only grievance you were not here

1485
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,960
Why don't you
congratulate our daughter?

1486
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,040
Of course, let me wish her

1487
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,160
Dear, your father
Go ahead, talk

1488
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,160
Appa...?

1489
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,800
My warmest wishes

1490
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,960
My dear, even if I am
not with you now...

1491
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,440
'...my blessings are always with you'

1492
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,840
From now on,
your future will be bright

1493
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,400
- Thank you, pa
- 'Let me talk to your mother'

1494
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,400
Yes, dear?

1495
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,400
How's the company owner?

1496
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,360
He's a wonderful boy

1497
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,720
Why don't you wish him too?

1498
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,120
Why should I wish him?

1499
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,520
He is the one who has given
our daughter a bright future

1500
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,640
Just express your gratitude

1501
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,640
Our daughter is in his care, right?

1502
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,080
Fine, I'll wish him

1503
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,800
1 minute, hold

1504
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,520
Your father-in-law
Talk to him

1505
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,640
Please, for my sacred thread's sake

1506
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,600
My dear boy

1507
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:05,160
- Good morning, sir
- Thanks for giving my daughter this job

1508
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,120
'You should only take
good care of her'

1509
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,480
She's young and innocent

1510
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,400
Make allowances for
any mistake on her part

1511
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,680
Her life is in your hands

1512
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,680
Don't worry about all that

1513
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,920
I'll take care of your daughter
much better than you, sir

1514
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,840
Just watch how she will
blossom in the future

1515
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,200
Hold on a minute

1516
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,920
Your voice sounds familiar to me

1517
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,920
Meet me in person
My face will be familiar too!

1518
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,680
'Let me talk to my wife'

1519
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,600
I'll ask aunty to talk

1520
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,400
Yes, dear?

1521
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,400
What is her salary?

1522
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,040
He's asking about her salary details

1523
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,880
Tell that madcap
it's around Rs 25,000/-

1524
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,480
Rs 25,000 it seems

1525
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,000
Starting salary is Rs 25000?

1526
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,920
He wants to know
if starting salary is 25000

1527
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,760
Why is he such a pain?
Tell him it is incremental

1528
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,560
'Why is he such a pain?'

1529
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,080
'Tell him it is incremental'

1530
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,200
- 'Whaaat?'
- Nothing

1531
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,520
I meant the salary
will increase gradually

1532
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,800
Then let her keep around
5000 for her basic expenses

1533
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,960
'Ask her to deposit the balance
20,000 in my account'

1534
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,480
We've borrowed left, right
and center, we can repay now

1535
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,160
Sure, uh...er...can I
ask you something?

1536
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,560
Shall I stay with her for a while?

1537
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,640
I can help her settle down
Ensure she's comfortable, right?

1538
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,240
Supervise everything
and then come home

1539
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,360
I'll talk to you later

1540
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,560
My dear son-in-law

1541
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,280
On the 1st of every month you must
deposit 20000 in his account it seems

1542
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,600
Whaaaat?

1543
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,720
Rs 20,000?!

1544
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,720
Head is spinning

1545
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,720
'Attack' Balu has nailed us solid!

1546
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,000
I paid Rs 650 for this
Lift your hand

1547
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,440
For my dear friend Kuzhandhai
to make babies

1548
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,000
I'll lose my power

1549
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,720
Eat some almonds
Aphrodisiac it seems

1550
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,600
Bro, what do you have in mind?

1551
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,120
You are so wrong

1552
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,280
She is really young

1553
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,360
What?

1554
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,760
I want to discuss our future
whole of tonight

1555
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,960
I won't even switch off the light

1556
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,040
Bye, huh?

1557
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,040
Even I feel like eating this

1558
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,600
How helpful is that!

1559
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,360
Let me store its potency!

1560
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,240
Bride has gone inside

1561
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,360
Let me see what his move is

1562
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,120
I'm feeling shy
and kind of weird

1563
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,560
Are you feeling shy?

1564
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,360
I'll switch off the light

1565
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,120
He switched off the light!

1566
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,400
He said he intended
discussing their future

1567
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,600
Seeing her face
he changed his mind

1568
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,280
Let me see how he faces me
in the morning!

1569
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,560
Why did you switch on the light?

1570
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,040
- No need all this?
- Which 'all'?

1571
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,600
Kissing

1572
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,400
Cuddling

1573
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,080
- Canoodling, huh?
- All these

1574
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,960
- Why?
- Hey Kuzhandhai

1575
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,560
Are we ready to have babies?

1576
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,880
Think about it

1577
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,800
My father is such a terror, he will
force me to marry someone else

1578
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,680
Anything might happen

1579
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,920
Until my father knows about
our wedding and consents...

1580
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,600
...let's not indulge in
all these hugs and kisses

1581
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,200
Is it so?

1582
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,000
They didn't do anything?

1583
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,560
Good lord!

1584
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,280
My darling child

1585
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,360
Why are you doing this?

1586
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,040
Give me a grandchild
in 7 months, zip zap zoom!

1587
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,640
If we have a grandson...

1588
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:08,080
...and he pees on your father's lap
that man's temper will cool down

1589
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,400
How can I do all this in 7 months?

1590
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,840
I want you to conceive
and you try to convince me!

1591
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,800
Your father was a premature baby

1592
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,720
The trauma of being
married to your father

1593
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,320
...you can erect a statue
for me on Marina beach!

1594
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,200
Ma, appa can do anything
at any time to ruin our lives

1595
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,280
That's why I firmly think
this should happen first

1596
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,160
Please give me a grandchild, my dear child

1597
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,600
Agreed?

1598
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,360
- Let go of my hand
- Come in fast

1599
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,680
In daytime, huh?

1600
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,200
Did we follow the tradition
of auspicious dates?

1601
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,880
Usually it is 1st wedding night
Let's change history today!

1602
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,240
It will be interesting

1603
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,840
- Get out
- Why are you chucking me out?

1604
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:06,640
"My heart so disobedient
beats erratic in excitement"

1605
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:11,920
"My heart loaded with passion
looks for you in anticipation"

1606
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,680
"Just a fleeting glimpse of you
I became light as a feather, it's true"

1607
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:22,520
"Head felt dizzy, I flew
completely without a clue"

1608
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,760
"My heart so headstrong
runs a marathon"

1609
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,200
"My heart brimming with emotion
looks for you with expectation"

1610
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:38,400
"One brief glance at you
I'm light as a feather, your beau"

1611
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:43,720
"Head felt giddy, my princess
I flew completely clueless"

1612
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,920
Where are you going off in a huff?

1613
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,560
Don't they need their privacy?

1614
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,760
Now you're talking!

1615
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,880
"The whole town looks
up to the sky above"

1616
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,280
"Your love for me is beyond that I know"

1617
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:15,520
"Hearing you speak words so sweet
my heart fills up with joy complete"

1618
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,520
"In the sweep of your lashes intense
canals turn into green fields dense"

1619
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:26,280
"Like the clouds drizzle prolific
without anyone asking specific"

1620
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:31,360
"You come along too
to live as a couple true"

1621
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,120
"To live and love without fear
as my wifey dear"

1622
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:42,160
"Trust me, no one can hinder
Come, let's make out together"

1623
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,280
Look here, boys

1624
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,320
Every month you must pay
your interest promptly

1625
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,760
I am 'Attack' Balu's daughter now

1626
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,640
I've removed my sacred thread

1627
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,040
- First pay my father
- Take

1628
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,800
Only after she started working
look at the glow on her face

1629
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,440
Then what? Her boss
takes good care, right?

1630
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,400
Accept it
Apple phone it seems

1631
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,800
"If biting cold wind blows
over you, dear"

1632
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,840
"I'll protect you like a flower sincere"

1633
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:24,280
"Your scent like a lingering lullaby
makes my mother pamper you like a baby"

1634
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:29,480
"I was like the Aloe vera plant thorny
You made me a mirror smooth and shiny"

1635
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,160
"You love like a swing tranquilizing
will comfort me always revitalizing"

1636
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,240
"Won't sleep take a nap too
along with us to refresh anew"

1637
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,360
"Me and you, you and me
We will play till eternity"

1638
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:51,000
"Happiness stays always with us
Shower me with your caress"

1639
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,280
"My heart so disobedient"

1640
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,040
"Beats a tattoo in excitement"

1641
01:26:56,080 --> 01:27:01,480
"My heart loaded with passion
looks for you in anticipation"

1642
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,840
"Just a fleeting glimpse of you
I became light as a feather, it's true"

1643
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,280
"Head felt dizzy, I flew
completely without a clue"

1644
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,880
How many months
since you were married?

1645
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,960
- 3 months
- 3rd month in 3 months, huh?!

1646
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,960
Why is he calling me now?

1647
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,040
Good news for you

1648
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,040
Even I must share
a piece of good news

1649
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,080
First let me tell you

1650
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,600
MLA has consented for the wedding

1651
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,720
Whaaaat?
He has agreed, huh?

1652
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,680
- Aunt, what happened?
- My head is spinning

1653
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,720
Hello, are you there?

1654
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,320
I am here

1655
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,080
Even I must tell you
this good news

1656
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,080
Our daughter has been promoted

1657
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,000
Her boss is right here

1658
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,400
Please wish him

1659
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,680
I should thank him, not wish him

1660
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,040
That's what I meant

1661
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,240
Please tell him

1662
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,760
Just a few words
Talk to my husband

1663
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:27,040
You kept your word and
promoted my daughter so soon

1664
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,280
Just wait and watch

1665
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,120
I'll take your daughter
to a totally different level!

1666
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,920
Even now your voice
sounds so familiar

1667
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,800
Come in person
I'll look familiar too

1668
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,320
Okay, son
Let me talk to my wife

1669
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,920
Hello, dear?

1670
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,720
He says he'll take her to another level
Will he hike up her salary?

1671
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,360
Er...I don't...1 minute

1672
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,840
He is asking if she will
get a salary hike?

1673
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,480
Even this 20,000 is tough
Only rise in position, that's all

1674
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,080
- Salary won't be hiked
- Your father is jobless!

1675
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,440
- Obsessed with money
- This is a prestige post

1676
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,320
Like a minister's post you mean

1677
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,720
- Exactly
- I will come soon

1678
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,080
'One Month Later'

1679
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,240
God, till my baby is born, my father
should not find out I'm married

1680
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,760
'I grow old making dosa'

1681
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,760
Please protect me

1682
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,840
Twenty two

1683
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,200
- Come here
- What?

1684
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,840
Ever since she came
I've been noticing

1685
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,040
Hasn't our daughter become plump?

1686
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,200
She hasn't put on weight
Just expecting

1687
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,120
Expecting pizza, burger that she eats
in Chennai here, butter-fingers!

1688
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,080
What?

1689
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,200
She licks butter off her finger
and so she's glowing

1690
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,040
Ask her to be on her guard

1691
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,240
Her boss might promise her a bonus
and give her a baby instead!

1692
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,600
That's bound to happen

1693
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,320
He is himself a baby!

1694
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,640
For past few weeks
you're sounding like a parrot

1695
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,320
He is suspicious now

1696
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,840
[dialogs from 'Vaaranam Aayiram]

1697
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,600
'I must tell you this'

1698
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,440
'You are so beautiful'

1699
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,720
I am asking you to marry me

1700
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,680
'Go wherever you wish'

1701
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,640
'Go to Paris or wherever'

1702
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,520
'But marry me and then go'

1703
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,800
'I want to clobber the man
who invented Dub Smash'

1704
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,720
What has upset you?

1705
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,200
This fellow bugs me with
his photos and dubsmash

1706
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,600
Give me your mobile
I'll handle this gurkha!

1707
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,800
'I don't love you'

1708
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,320
'I don't like you'

1709
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,160
'I don't think you are beautiful'

1710
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,120
'But I'm scared
all this will happen'

1711
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,320
'Think and tell me'

1712
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,000
'Sambar' Gemini!

1713
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,280
Bro, act like Kamal Haasan
to this Gemini Ganesan

1714
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,440
Apple phone?

1715
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,400
'How do I operate this?'

1716
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,400
Who is it?

1717
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,960
- Hello
- 'Who is speaking?'

1718
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,640
This is 'Attack' Balu here

1719
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,720
'Attack' Balu?

1720
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,760
Basket ball, huh?

1721
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,760
- Give the phone to my daughter
- Who is she?

1722
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,880
Magizhini

1723
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,240
There is no one by that name here

1724
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,440
Hang up, I say!

1725
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,320
Hey! Listen
I called our daughter

1726
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,720
Some random man is talking

1727
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,200
'Aunt, this is the right time'

1728
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,000
Atleast now tell him the truth

1729
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,400
Wrong timing

1730
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,360
Did you think he is a holy terror
because his name is 'Attack' Balu?

1731
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,960
Nothing of that sort

1732
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,400
He has suffered
2 heart attacks already

1733
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:30,520
Just once more and the doctor said,
'We have to send him up'

1734
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,160
I'll give you an idea

1735
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,560
If you break the news point blank,
he'll be shell-shocked

1736
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,480
Either he will have another attack
Or I will end up in prison

1737
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,080
3rd option he'll take a stone
and crack your skull into 2!

1738
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,200
Then it will be a 'gone case'

1739
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,200
So what you do is
go straight to uncle

1740
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,680
Simply say 'Maybe Magizhini
is in love with someone'

1741
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:56,120
Our daughter hasn't come home
for the past few weeks

1742
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,880
May be she is in love
with her boss?

1743
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,960
Look here, if something
like that happens

1744
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I'll make them stand before me
and split them into two

1745
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,720
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes
I will bury them

1746
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,040
Don't get tense, dear

1747
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,160
Our daughter is not so gutsy

1748
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,800
My crooked brain
came up with this doubt

1749
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,080
Lean back and chillax!

1750
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,040
'Lips are like roses?'

1751
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,200
This village Romeo
tortures me no end

1752
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,880
Why are you obsessed
with your phone?

1753
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,720
Hey! You started the ball rolling

1754
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,720
Looks like very soon
I'll fall in love with him

1755
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,520
He impressed me too much!

1756
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,560
'My sweetheart'

1757
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,960
Read this message

1758
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,480
I love you today

1759
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,760
Hey! Chee

1760
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,160
What are you doing?

1761
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,360
Shall I tell you something else?

1762
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,160
I can see only his face
even when I sleep on my tummy

1763
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,880
What a turnip-face!

1764
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,440
All this won't work out

1765
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:11,320
What does your daughter think of herself?
I've called her past 15 days

1766
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,400
I think you were bang on
about her boss 'banging' her

1767
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,200
Let's go, only you know her address

1768
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,320
She has too much work
in her office it seems

1769
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,080
Only now she told me

1770
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,120
Why will our daughter deceive us?

1771
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,080
I didn't imply she will deceive us

1772
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,040
I don't want to get deceived!

1773
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,640
I'll book our tickets
Be ready

1774
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,040
I feel really tired

1775
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,680
Let's go next week

1776
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,800
- Where did you go?
- Get ready

1777
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,720
Gone case, huh?

1778
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,040
I knew the station master
So I got the ticket on loan!

1779
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,600
'That loan shark is here'

1780
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,960
'He will badger me
for his dues'

1781
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,960
Hey Balu!

1782
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,120
Come here

1783
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,400
Where are you off to?

1784
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,200
To Chennai to see my daughter

1785
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,040
- I'll be back soon
- Wait, man

1786
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,600
2 years you were paying interest

1787
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,960
Past 2 months not even that

1788
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,240
This won't work
Settle your account

1789
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,600
Let my daughter
marry our MLA's son

1790
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,640
After that I'll repay
my loan and more

1791
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,640
Hey Balu

1792
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,680
Your daughter has married
someone in Chennai already

1793
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,720
Don't you know?
Whole town is aware

1794
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,680
Don't you dare
malign my daughter

1795
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,280
You don't want
this wedding to happen

1796
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,320
You'll lose face

1797
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,640
Don't paint her out
to be virtuous

1798
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:22,120
Your daughter has loose morals
You're spitting fire at me!

1799
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,560
If you dare deride my daughter
I'll slaughter you

1800
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,320
- Yes, aunt
- Son-in-law

1801
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,280
On the way back from
booking our tickets...

1802
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,400
...he picked up a fight
with that loan shark

1803
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,360
'Chopped his hand in a fit of rage'

1804
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,800
His brother-in-law is
a high level police officer

1805
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,720
My husband is now in jail and
we can't even take him out on bail

1806
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,680
'What do we do now?'

1807
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,600
Listen to my idea, aunt

1808
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:09,400
My husband chopped a man's hand

1809
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,120
So he is in jail for 15 days
on a non-bailable offence

1810
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,120
My son-in-law asked me
to ask you for a favor

1811
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,000
If you grease the required palms
I'll bring him out tomorrow

1812
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,400
We will give any lump sum you want

1813
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,560
But instead of a fortnight

1814
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,360
My son-in-law wants to know
if he can be kept inside for 4 months, sir

1815
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,360
Tell me, aunt

1816
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,360
The lawyer says
4 months isn't possible

1817
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,160
Then?

1818
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,040
'He says the only provision
is for 6 months!'

1819
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,480
Superb!

1820
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,720
Magizhini will deliver the baby

1821
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,000
We will manage somehow

1822
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,280
Soooper!

1823
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,080
Okay, I'll do as you say

1824
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,720
"Dreams unfulfilled in life's journey"

1825
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,760
"Patterns of multi hued 'rangoli'
blown away by the wind heedlessly"

1826
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,240
Don't worry, uncle

1827
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,840
I'll bring you out
in 2 days, mark my words

1828
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,480
'Fat hopes! We ensured
you're in for 6 months'

1829
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,000
[song from 'Neengal Kaetavai']

1830
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:21,120
"Boats heading to the shore unbidden
considering even oars to be a burden"

1831
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:24,240
'My dear, even if I am
not with you now...'

1832
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,920
'...my blessings are always with you'

1833
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,080
Coming, dear

1834
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,560
I would've been happier if you had
chopped off that jerk's neck!

1835
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,880
'How dare he malign our Magizhini!'

1836
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,680
I am stuck here for the past 2 months

1837
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,880
Magizh doesn't want to
visit me even now?

1838
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,520
How can her work be so important?

1839
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,080
She has got a promotion

1840
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,960
Her work load must be heavy

1841
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,360
What about her salary?

1842
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,000
It will be credited
in your account on the dot

1843
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,760
'Time's up
Please leave'

1844
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,160
- Do you need to be told specially?
- See you, dear

1845
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,560
He doesn't behave
like a politician's son

1846
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,920
Sends childish messages

1847
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,600
He isn't even letting me sleep in peace

1848
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,520
He is really desperate
Let me reply

1849
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,960
Can we both go on a honeymoon?

1850
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,480
Thanks to this phone
I only see 'terrace' moon!

1851
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,640
That's it, switch off

1852
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,880
He is killing me, I swear

1853
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,960
Don't plague me with questions

1854
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,240
One of you tell me

1855
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,160
Your husband has done
something wrong

1856
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,840
Hey! You there!

1857
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,400
I thought you'll be out
only after 20 days

1858
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,600
How did you come out so soo-

1859
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,880
Are you asking how
I came out early or why I came?

1860
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,160
Just a general knowledge question

1861
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,800
They released me earlier
as an ode to Annadurai

1862
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:54,320
My daughter never visited me
even once when I was in prison

1863
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,560
Even that is okay

1864
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,120
He made my daughter
work damn hard

1865
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,040
And he hasn't even paid her
for 2 months

1866
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,600
I feel there's something fishy here

1867
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,200
Let's go to Chennai right away

1868
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,320
Why go right now to Chennai?

1869
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,200
Why get so worked up?

1870
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,880
Did I call you to Pakistan?

1871
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,680
Get ready, I'll borrow
some cash and come

1872
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,200
What will I do now?

1873
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,880
Son-in-law

1874
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,320
She will deliver in another 15 days

1875
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,280
We know that already, doctor

1876
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,320
Will it be normal or Caesarean?

1877
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,840
How can you even ask me this?

1878
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,800
Obviously Caesarean

1879
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,480
Then why can't you
deliver the baby now?

1880
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,640
Why are you in
such a tearing hurry?

1881
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,720
Today is Tuesday

1882
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,440
It isn't an auspicious day

1883
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,520
That's okay, doctor

1884
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,480
You can fix the surgery
for 12:01 a.m, Wednesday

1885
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,040
'Hurry' must be your middle name!

1886
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,400
'Attack' Balu will attack me, doctor

1887
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,160
Please save me, doctor

1888
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,920
I'm ready to pay any amount

1889
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,360
Its okay
Risk is yours

1890
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,840
Admit her right away

1891
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,320
Thanks doctor

1892
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,560
'Chennai Koyambedu'

1893
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,680
Finally in 1 piece
Get down

1894
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,200
Don't hassle me

1895
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,920
Change your saree
and come out fast

1896
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,160
Only if you push a bit
it will start

1897
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,960
Hello, son-in-law

1898
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,360
We had breakfast
and coming to your place

1899
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,920
I just admitted Magizhini
in the hospital

1900
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,240
Surgery is only tonight

1901
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:49,640
So take uncle on
a tour around Chennai

1902
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,720
Let's meet tomorrow

1903
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,920
Is that the plan?
Okay, done

1904
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,600
Watch how I take him
for a soooper ride!

1905
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,320
He's here
I'll hang up

1906
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,880
Made me push
the moment I land here

1907
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,080
Is it a bullock cart or mobile cart?

1908
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,880
Which area?

1909
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,960
It's either Anna arch
or Kalaignar arch

1910
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,560
Akka, 1st one is Arignar Anna arch

1911
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,520
I'll take you straight there

1912
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,840
Will you know
when we reach there?

1913
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,240
I know, I'll show

1914
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,680
Insides are shaking!

1915
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,040
- This is the area, let's get off
- No, not this one

1916
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,280
I think...it's Kalaignar Nagar!

1917
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,720
- You mean K.K.Nagar?
- That's the place

1918
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,360
Good catch! I'll take them for
a solid ride and line my pocket

1919
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,240
Why has our daughter
switched off her phone?

1920
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,760
She must be at work
Don't bother her

1921
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,400
My chest is paining

1922
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,960
'Aiyo! 'Attack' Balu will convert
this auto into an ambulance!'

1923
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,640
- 'Akka, what's your name?'
- Just shut up!

1924
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,400
Drive slowly

1925
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,680
'Can't go on'

1926
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,160
This time I'll find
the right address

1927
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,880
This area doesn't seem familiar at all

1928
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,440
Bro, go back to
the spot we got in

1929
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,640
The point is-

1930
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,360
Don't point here
You took me for a ride, huh?

1931
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,640
I'll rip your insides out

1932
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,840
Take me to a decent hotel

1933
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,080
- How much?
- 5050

1934
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,520
- Whaaat?
- Rs 50 discount for you

1935
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,240
- Give only Rs 5000
- I have only 5000 on me

1936
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,480
See you, bro?

1937
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,160
- Give me at least 1000 back
- Come along

1938
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,760
I didn't walk away
just to fight with you

1939
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,880
I thought you both
needed some privacy

1940
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,400
Shouldn't both the families
get united or not?

1941
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,000
That's the only reason
Don't get me wrong

1942
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,840
My darling daughter-in-law!

1943
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,120
Good luck
Godspeed

1944
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,240
Go slowly

1945
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,920
Don't rush
Slow down

1946
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,800
I can hear a baby crying

1947
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,560
Baby and mother are safe

1948
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,800
Who is this darling?

1949
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,080
Look at me

1950
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,920
Look at your father

1951
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,000
Why is my son-in-law
calling me at this time of night?

1952
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,960
Aunt, you're now a grandma

1953
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,120
Please talk a bit louder

1954
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,880
I can't hear a word

1955
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,360
You're a grandma now
Special status

1956
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,680
Are you asking for uncle?

1957
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,240
Hey! Hag of a grandma!

1958
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,640
- My ear is blocked
- You have a grandchild

1959
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,600
I'll return your money
with interest, get lost!

1960
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,120
He's a royal pain!

1961
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,400
Am I a grandma now?

1962
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,880
I'm soooo happy

1963
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,720
Then we'll both come home
tomorrow morning?

1964
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,080
No, aunt, she'll be discharged
only tomorrow evening

1965
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,400
Bring him the day after

1966
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,000
Until then show him
the rest of Chennai

1967
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,040
Okay then

1968
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,880
- Sister!
- Bro, good morning

1969
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,920
- Are you back?
- Please come

1970
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,720
Sir, please push my auto

1971
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,840
Hey, get down

1972
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,240
You'll listen to this chap
and not me, huh?

1973
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,240
Then how do we find the address?

1974
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,800
Look, I arranged a car

1975
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
- Get into the car
- Akka...akka

1976
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,960
Roam around the city
with your wife!

1977
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,440
How did he get here?

1978
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,080
Don't go, akka

1979
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,240
Aren't you familiar with
all the places in Madras?

1980
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,800
Why are you worried now?

1981
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,640
The 2 men seated behind
are my left and right hand

1982
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,160
They know all the routes
Like Google Map

1983
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,840
Aunt, there are too many alleys in the city

1984
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,560
Very tough to find any address

1985
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,920
Why don't we directly
go to Magizh's office?

1986
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,200
Give me the address

1987
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,720
This is why we need
our son-in-law with us!

1988
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,800
Lord Rama! Save me

1989
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,160
Both the ex-chief ministers
saved me yesterday

1990
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,280
Who will save me today?

1991
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,680
I thi...think it is-

1992
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,760
Office is some Denmark or Dominoes

1993
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,840
Where do we go, boys?

1994
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,560
Boss, I'll give the right directions

1995
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,880
Driver, turn left

1996
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,400
Driver, take this right

1997
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,480
Are you mad?
We must go left

1998
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,240
Bro, turn left

1999
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,120
Anna, take this right

2000
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,400
How dare you rough me up?

2001
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,440
Left...take this left

2002
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,720
Take a sharp right

2003
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,120
What is this nonstop left and right?

2004
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,040
Stop the car

2005
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,160
Get down

2006
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,520
'I'll run for my life'

2007
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,000
This is a left
and right for you!

2008
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:05,320
Go straight and dash
your head at that dead end!

2009
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,800
Bro, please stop

2010
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,760
Where are these IT companies?

2011
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,320
In OMR and ECR roads

2012
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,280
Heroes SSR and MGR, huh?

2013
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,600
OMR and ECR

2014
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,600
Go straight and take the left

2015
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,520
...then right

2016
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,480
Left and right

2017
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,600
Again another left

2018
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,360
What's wrong with him?

2019
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,480
You carry on
We'll take care

2020
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,000
Oh my goodness!

2021
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,640
Is my daughter working
in such a tall building?

2022
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,320
- Let's go inside
- Hello, who are you?

2023
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,520
All because of you

2024
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,760
I'll tell my dad

2025
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,080
I'm really bugged
Go back to the hotel

2026
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,800
If you don't show me the place
I'll push you under a speeding bus

2027
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,320
- I'll go back home alone
- Wait...driver

2028
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,400
Can you see that tall building
on the right side?

2029
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,160
Stop the car right in front

2030
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,280
I think that's the one

2031
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,200
Son-in-law, is that the one?

2032
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,720
Why are you standing here?

2033
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,200
'God, please save only me!'

2034
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,960
Please come

2035
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,280
This is her house
Come inside

2036
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,280
Magizhini...?

2037
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:56,280
Didn't you tell me
she's staying with some girls?

2038
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,040
I see only men's clothes here

2039
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,480
- Uncle
- Don't interrupt!

2040
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,480
Nowadays girls wear men's clothes

2041
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,800
- Why be suspicious?
- Underwear also?

2042
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,720
- Uncle
- Shut up!

2043
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,840
If you keep asking me questions
like bullets off a gun

2044
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,120
...how can I answer?

2045
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,520
Give me some time to think

2046
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,920
Why is a baby hammock here?

2047
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,960
With a baby in it!

2048
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,280
That is...how do I tackle this question?

2049
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:26,320
There's an aunty next door

2050
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,600
Could it be her baby?

2051
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,200
Let me take a look at the baby

2052
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,000
This baby is such a sweety-pie

2053
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,680
I feel like becoming a grandma too

2054
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,840
You look at the baby too

2055
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,320
'Oh God!
Help me'

2056
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:46,680
- This baby resembles our daughter
- Let me see

2057
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,680
You are so right

2058
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,440
Carbon copy
of our daughter

2059
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,160
I have this sudden doubt

2060
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,920
Maybe our daughter
has married her boss

2061
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,760
Could this be their baby?

2062
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,840
Hey! Magizh

2063
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,840
Don't get in my way

2064
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,320
'Magizhini, come out fast, dear'

2065
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,960
Father

2066
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,360
We did this without
your knowledge, forgive us

2067
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,840
I am so sorry

2068
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,520
Please forgive me too

2069
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,160
I was the one
who conducted her wedding

2070
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,400
Who is our son-in-law?

2071
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,600
That...that is someone you-

2072
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,760
Who is our son-in-law?

2073
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:36,960
Is it her boss?

2074
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,800
Say yes...say yes

2075
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,320
Yes, pa

2076
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,280
Boss...boss?

2077
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,240
Hurry-

2078
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,400
Why is he here?

2079
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:48,040
Hello, 'Attack' uncle

2080
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,760
Good lord!
Is he our son-in-law?

2081
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,120
- Yuck!
- Why can't I be your son-in-law?

2082
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,600
You raised a parrot
and gave it to a bear

2083
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,440
How dare you!
I'll have you pounded to a pulp

2084
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,600
Come out fast
He's calling me a bear

2085
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,000
Come out fast, I say

2086
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,040
I've seen you somewhere

2087
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:09,480
I came home to ask
for your daughter's hand

2088
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,440
What are you doing here?

2089
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,160
I'm the husband of your daughter!

2090
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,480
- I'm also with them
- Yes, dear

2091
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,000
Didn't he swear he will humiliate me
in front of all our friends and family?

2092
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,360
Please note down this address

2093
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:02,800
Aunt, take money from his pocket
for hospital expenses

2094
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,600
'He's tight fisted
even during an attack!'

2095
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,920
So you didn't get any attack?

2096
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,840
If our friends and family find out
about this wedding...

2097
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,560
...imagine the disgrace I'll face

2098
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,040
Except you everyone is aware

2099
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,480
- For that loan shark
- He knows from A to Z

2100
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,400
- Was he speaking the truth?
- Yes

2101
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,080
We have been tricked royally

2102
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:30,480
- You marry some other girl
- Don't go, pa

2103
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,960
Are you angry?

2104
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,880
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something

2105
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,320
Who cooked for her wedding?

2106
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,080
We arranged it in a good hotel

2107
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:39,440
I was planning to cook
16 different dishes

2108
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,360
I couldn't cook for
my own daughter's wedding!

2109
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,200
- Uncle, Magizh?
- Grasshopper!

2110
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,280
Where did you buy this mobile?

2111
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:47,760
Yov! How did you get this?

2112
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,960
It's been with me from day 1
Hangs often

2113
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,880
If you text me
I'll chop your hand

2114
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,480
'No girl
No mobile'

2115
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,040
I wanted to conduct
the 'talk of the town' wedding

2116
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,320
You've humiliated me in front
of all my kith and kin, Mandharai

2117
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,320
Function, huh?

2118
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,960
'Wonder who is the caterer here'

2119
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,840
Why are you here?

2120
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:19,080
Your wife said you wanted us
to come for a catering order

2121
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,760
Me...?
What function?

2122
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,880
Look over there
You'll know then

2123
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,040
Naming ceremony of Jr Kuzhandhai
presided by 'Attack' Balu

2124
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,520
Please come, bro

2125
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:36,240
Move...give way

2126
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,080
VIP baby is coming, right?

2127
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,600
You sleep here, my darling

2128
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,360
Hey, what's happening here?

2129
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,520
How many more bombshells
will you throw?

2130
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:47,120
3 days since the baby was born

2131
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,760
- Let's name the baby, hurry up
- Fine, 'Hari'!

2132
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,040
Give way...move aside

2133
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,840
Who is this blocking the way?

2134
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,840
Go back

2135
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,880
You invited everyone
and made me look a fool

2136
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,720
- Lunch is ready
- Stuff it down your throat!

2137
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:52,440
Name the baby after my father
Muthukaruppa Ponnambalam

2138
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,600
Not possible

2139
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,720
Why not?

2140
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,880
You didn't agree to my choice of groom

2141
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,760
Don't I have the right
to name the baby?

2142
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,040
Rights, procession, palanquin,
turban, all intact

2143
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,360
Can we conduct a 'Jallikattu'
with a Jersey cow?!

2144
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,840
Our grandchild is a girl!

2145
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,040
- Granddaughter?
- Then what?

2146
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,240
Okay...fine

2147
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,160
Name our granddaughter...

2148
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,360
...after my mother Muthaayi

2149
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,360
Muthaayi...?

2150
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,120
- 'Mutaai', you mean candy?
- Muthaayi as in pearl!!

2151
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:20,080
Shall we name her Muthaayi?

2152
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,960
Don't agree

2153
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,160
- Tell your father
- How can I?

2154
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,800
He is coming up with
names like popcorn and biscuit

2155
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,480
Sounds terrible...Muttayi!

2156
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,440
- I told you not to call him
- Sounds like a bakery item

2157
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,720
- You like the name or not?
- Not 1 bit

2158
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,880
What's the big conference in aid of?

2159
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,200
Name her Muthaayi

2160
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,560
- Okay
- No need!

2161
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,600
Muthaayi

2162
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,360
Muthaayi

2163
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,880
Muthaayi alias Divya!

2164
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,520
- Why Divya?
- Sri Divya!

2165
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:50,880
Muthaayi sounds old fashioned

2166
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,600
Muthaayi at home
Divya in school

2167
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,280
Don't I have a right even in this?

2168
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:57,000
You are the sole cause!

2169
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,400
Divya...?

2170
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,800
Muthaayi...!

2171
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,680
Muthaayi

2172
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,240
My precious grand-princess!

2173
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,480
Come son-in...bro, please come

2174
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,760
Gift for the baby?

2175
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,360
Take it

2176
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,720
Let's go eat

2177
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,520
Don't want our guests
eating a cold lunch!
