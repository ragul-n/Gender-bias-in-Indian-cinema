00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,640
Land

3
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,880
In the evolution of
human civilization...

4
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,410
...land has played
an important part

5
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,360
As civilizations developed...

6
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,640
...humans wanted to
produce their own food

7
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,850
They converted forests...

8
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,030
...to agricultural lands
making it conducive for existence

9
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,960
Lands they toiled in
became their God...

10
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,670
...their religious rite and
a caste ritual

11
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,960
Land became power!

12
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,020
From our myths and epics...

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,520
to the present
wars fought to expand borders...

14
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,020
and to assert power...

15
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,200
...enslave the losing side

16
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,720
Even in Independent India...

17
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,770
land ownership and deprivation...

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
and the social status
associated with it...

19
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,990
...are all unwritten laws

20
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,860
Even after many centuries...

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,070
...this hasn’t changed much
in our villages and our cities

22
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,400
A considerable amount
of land in the cities...

23
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,430
...is retained by the slum dwellers
through their labour and numbers

24
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,950
We call them the ‘urban poor’

25
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,300
They face severe
oppression in this country

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,310
Corporate companies...

27
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,720
and land mafia feel that...

28
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,850
the land of these
under-represented people...

29
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,760
...is ruining the beauty of the city

30
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,040
That they are unclean...

31
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,850
...and are criminal hubs
They want these people to be thrown out

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,820
People are removed brutally
from their own land

33
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,460
They are either thrown
outside the city...

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,420
...or into match box sized
housing projects

35
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,550
They live and die, with no land
to call their own

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,950
This happens in all our cities
with all of us as the eyewitness

37
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,020
India’s financial capital...

38
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,800
...Mumbai is no exception to this

39
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,080
I am reporting from the open laundry
in Dharavi’s 90 feet road

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,590
The State assembly elections
are round the corner

41
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,490
Ruling Party Chief Haridev Abhyankar...

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
...announced 'Pure Mumbai’ scheme
in the last term

43
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,490
A plan to demolish huts
and build apartments instead

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,460
Keys to newly built houses
are handed over in many places

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,590
'Puja' for the first building in Dharavi
is going on now

46
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,110
‘Arise’, a people’s movement here
is opposing this project

47
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,120
Come along, you will see...

48
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,280
The ‘Bhumi Puja’
is happening on one side...

49
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,890
...and protests by 'Arise' movement
right behind

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,870
This first opposition to the scheme
has created a furore among the residents

51
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,370
Move

53
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,390
Turn it off!

54
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,500
Stop filming!

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,660
Sir, Camera!

56
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,140
(slogan)
We wash clothes every day.

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,740
We wash clothes every day!

58
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,380
We work hard every day.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,570
We work hard every day!

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,330
Our houses are ours to keep.

61
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,400
Our houses are ours to keep!

62
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,040
'Our land is ours to keep.'

63
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,870
'Our land is ours to keep!'

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,820
Start!

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'

66
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,120
'Our jobs are ours to keep!'

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,790
Damn!
Hey, Move!

68
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,350
- Our rights are ours to keep!
- Hey, stop

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,620
- We will never give it away.
- Stop I said

70
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,220
We are the owners and
we don’t have a problem

71
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,240
What is your problem?

72
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,680
Hey, you are the Secretary

73
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,920
You would have a plan
to mint money out of this

74
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,280
You will leave these people hanging?

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,800
Are you the authority here?

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,390
Dharavi is going to be
filled with buildings

77
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,350
Saving the ‘dhobi ghat'!

78
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,110
Hey!

79
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,230
This ‘Akka’ has been here for 20 years

80
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,490
What will she do
if there is no place to work?

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,880
'Our rights are ours to keep.'

82
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,370
- Brother is here. Come
- Let’s go

83
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,690
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,930
I thought there won't be
any problems

85
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,990
- Yes
- Look what is happening

86
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,430
- Don’t worry about it
- Resolve it somehow

87
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,040
He will come here straight

88
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,880
Don't pick a fight with him
I warn you

89
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,030
Why are you all scared?

90
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,010
Huh?

91
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,230
We are just protesting right?

92
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,350
Start!

93
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,480
(slogan)
Our jobs are ours to keep.

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,130
Our jobs are ours to keep!

95
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,150
- Move them
- Yes, Sir

96
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,360
- 'Our rights are ours to keep!'
- Go back! Move!

97
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,510
'We will never give it away.'

98
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,900
'We will never give it away!'

99
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,400
We wash clothes every day.

100
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,000
We wash clothes every day!

101
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,630
Our rights are ours to keep.

102
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,570
- 'We will never give it away.'
- Shut up!

103
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,250
You will demand any damn thing
if it comes for free?

104
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,550
What did you give for free?

105
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,420
Is Dharavi your father’s property?

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,540
Your father owns this?
Tell me!

107
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,040
Huh?

108
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,610
'Anna', listen

109
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,520
It's unfair to give houses for some
and not for the others

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,500
In the name of 'Pure Mumbai'...

111
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,860
...you remove only the slums
Is that enough to make India clean?

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,560
Take everyone's consent
before you decide

113
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,060
Hey!

114
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,930
Aren’t you my relative's son?

115
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,010
What work do you have
on 90 feet road?

116
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,210
Hey, this is my Party’s project

117
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,240
Look!

118
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,660
Don’t create a ruckus
Take your people and leave

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,450
Ok?

120
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,170
I won’t spare you because
you are my relative

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,880
Go back to your work

122
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,770
- Go on, do your work
- Ey!

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
'Finish this before evening...'
- Sssh sssh!

124
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,780
I won’t be intimidated
by your rowdyism

125
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,420
I am a Marathi girl!
I live right here

126
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Hey, shut up!

127
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,210
You know who you are talking to?

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,460
- I know. I can see!
- How dare you?

129
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
Get down!
Step down!

130
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,220
Don't you dare raise your voice!

131
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,710
Shut up!
Stop it!

132
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,220
- Stop it!
- 'Arrest them!'

133
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,540
I give you 5 minutes

134
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,220
Get out of here. Understand?

135
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,170
Why are you bossing around?

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
You wag your tail for the
money they throw at you, right?

137
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,810
How dare you...

138
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
Devi Akka!

139
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,110
Hey! what the hell

140
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,310
Thrash them
Throw them out

141
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,290
Let go! Let go!

142
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,650
Lock your arms!
'Patil, 'lathi' charge them'

143
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,280
Hold hands
Lock! Lock!

144
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,940
(slogan)
Arrest them! Arrest them!

145
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,980
Arrest them! Arrest them!

146
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,490
Arrest them! Arrest them!

147
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,580
Chase them!

148
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,030
Vishnubhai! How dare you
demolish the dhobi ghat!

149
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,340
Let's see what becomes
of your arrogance in a bit

150
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,490
Stay right here!
I will go get him

151
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,490
Beemji!

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,790
Listen to me
Don’t go

153
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,520
Don't go

154
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,020
DON'T...!

155
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,450
EYYY!

156
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,560
Listen!

157
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,240
DON'T GO!

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,480
BEEMJI!

159
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,920
Listen Kaala,
2 runs out of the last ball

160
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,260
Hit it slow
I will take over

161
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,140
'Go on, big man!'

162
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,920
Ya right!

163
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,620
He will do it

164
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,410
- Let’s see
- He will!

165
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,990
Just 2 runs!
‘JUJUBI’

166
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,730
Anna, hit a six!

167
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,950
Watch my game now

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,250
Hey! Bowl
Bowl I said

169
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,690
Target the stumps
It is our game. Easy! Easy!

170
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,220
All Alert!

171
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,420
Hey, hold on

172
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,330
Now what!

173
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,240
Are you ready?

174
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,470
- Put it now
- Come on, Kaala!

175
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,360
BOWLED!

176
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,270
OU...!

177
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,270
'Hey! Not out'

178
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,830
'What is it Brother-in-law!
'No...Not Out'

179
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,120
Rajappa!
This is a No Ball

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,970
What is it Bawa?

181
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,120
No ball, see!

182
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,530
Pa, out!

183
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,150
No ball!

184
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,150
Wide
Wide ball!

185
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,540
Superb Umpire!

186
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,410
Bawa, what say?

187
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,800
'You are the best'

188
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,060
- WIDE
- You and your stupid cricket!

189
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,070
Wide!

190
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,650
'KAALA!
They are demolishing the dhobi ghat'

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,580
They beat up my mother

192
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,490
'Lenin and Bharathi are protesting'

193
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,060
'It’s Vishnubhai, Kaala'

194
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,160
Vishnubhai!

195
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,140
Siva!

196
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,070
'We want Justice!'

197
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,650
'Justice! Justice!'

198
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,350
'We want Justice!'

199
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Siva Anna

200
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,440
We have taken up this protest

201
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,300
Don't deviate it

202
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,580
Take them all and leave

203
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,080
Justice! Justice!

204
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,890
We want Justice!

205
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,310
Justice! Justice!

206
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,540
We want Justice!

207
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,140
NO!
Siva Anna!

208
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,210
Siva!
NO!

209
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,590
Hey, what is this?

210
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,870
This is a Law and Order problem

211
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,210
I would have to ‘lathi' charge you

212
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,060
Go on, let's see

213
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,450
Let’s see you lay a finger

214
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,320
Shut up!

215
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,220
Do it
Let's see

216
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,640
Sir, just one second

217
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,960
'Saet'…Sir

218
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,480
Let’s compromise

219
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,640
I have sunk all my
investments in this

220
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,710
If this project doesn’t take off...

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,700
...my family will be
stranded on the streets

222
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,400
Please Saet

223
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,270
I will do as you say

224
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,720
Not bad huh?

225
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,740
A horse does eat dry grass
in desperation, huh?

226
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
You think we are...

227
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,340
...mediating for commission here?

228
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,600
One tight slap
you will get

229
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,410
They have hidden this
from Kaala’s knowledge

230
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,120
Then something must be wrong

231
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,970
300 families will lose their jobs

232
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,800
Out of them 200 families
will not get houses

233
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,110
Such culprits!

234
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,740
Here comes Vishnubhai!

235
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,910
What?

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
At the sight of you...

237
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,630
...we will tremble in fear, is it?

238
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,400
Anna!

239
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,510
If you were getting involved
why would I be here?

240
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,170
I thought he was
over-enthusiastic

241
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,120
I am gradually rising in
the ranks of the party

242
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,250
If I close this deal…

243
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,920
…they have promised a seat
in the upcoming MLA election

244
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,990
You have to...help me

245
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,870
Am I not your brother, anyway?

246
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,740
Hey!

247
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,090
When you need something
you call him your brother...

248
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
...shower him with love

249
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,210
These people should suffer
for your good reputation?

250
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,990
- That’s your plan, right
- Exactly!

251
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,570
When you become a politician
you lose all your dignity, huh?

252
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,970
Shameless people!

253
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,730
Having a field day
because you have support?

254
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,570
Don’t forget your rank!

255
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,380
Ey!

256
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,160
Shut the hell up!

257
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,430
'Hey Builder!'

258
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,250
Only you can talk

259
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,560
Anna, don’t create problems
Please stop

260
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,900
Kaala Saet!
They are trying to cheat you

261
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,370
We are people who wash clothes
Who will speak for us?

262
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,560
Where would we go, if not here?

263
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,760
'Aren't they doing this
because we have no support'

264
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,000
Anna, she is lying

265
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,320
We consulted everyone

266
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,100
Right?

267
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,370
'Didn't you threaten me?'

268
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,810
Everything is happening with
permissions and procedures, lawfully

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,580
HEY!!

270
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,460
Are you talking about the law to us?

271
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,080
We know how to respect the law

272
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,700
And if it oppresses us,
we know to....it too

273
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,700
You are going a bit easy on us...

274
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,410
...only because of some laws that favor us

275
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,520
If not wouldn't you have
thrown us 7 seas away?

276
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,380
Look!

277
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,420
If you want your work done...

278
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,860
...repair everything you've damaged
and change your design

279
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,180
They wash clothes for a living

280
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,450
They will do it right here

281
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,320
What she says, is the law
Got it?

282
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,850
S...Saet!

283
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,480
Get it!

284
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,700
Will we act against Anna’s words!

285
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,480
No sir!

286
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,460
Anna, we have to do
what you say, right!

287
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,000
Builder! Listen to him

288
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,550
I will leave now, Anna

289
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,630
Patil! Let’s go

290
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,030
Hey, Beemji!
- Kaala

291
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,240
'Who was it?'

292
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
He is the one

293
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,140
- Him, is it!
- Anna...

294
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,260
Devi...!

295
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,890
Hit him back

296
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,900
Ma, why are you hesitating?

297
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,420
Go beat him up, go

298
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,340
Anna...!

299
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,340
'Go, Akka'

300
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,550
Because she said
all those things...

301
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,550
Don’t listen to them
and do something stupid

302
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,550
'Lenin, let her go'

303
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,590
They can only rally with their flags

304
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,500
'They know nothing else'

305
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,540
You bloody...

306
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,010
Take it

307
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,780
'Superb!'

308
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,210
We know to hold a flag...

309
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,270
...and to hit back

310
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,630
Yes! Fantastic

311
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,820
You raise a finger again
I will thrash you

312
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,170
Hey, who are you messing with!

313
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,020
'Ey! why are you screaming?'

314
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,940
TAKE the hits!

315
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,200
You are the reason for this

316
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,560
You think I am a dud
to be beaten up by a woman?

317
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
One stab...

318
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,250
EYYY!

319
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,360
Stop...Stop

320
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,350
Who are you to
raise your hand against him!

321
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,030
Huh?

322
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,220
If Dharavi is a tiny India
with all castes, religions, languages

323
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,980
He is its King
He is its Counsel

324
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,600
If he gives you an order
shut the hell up and do it

325
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,370
Do it!

326
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,520
We are nobodies here

327
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,780
Nothing absolutely

328
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,260
He doesn't realise that
your flag is flying for too long

329
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,520
He doesn't

330
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,010
An out-dated flag
must be lowered, right!

331
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,030
Hey...wait till the elections

332
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,580
We will take care of this

333
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,860
Let's hoist a new flag!

334
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,400
'Searching for your sunglasses?
It has fallen off'

335
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,070
Hari Daada is watching you!

336
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,700
- Move!
- 'Hey, off!'

337
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,810
-'Run!'
- Leave all of you

338
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,630
Bawa!

339
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,980
Let me share your
magnificence on facebook

340
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,300
'Grew up in the waters of 'Tamirabarani'
Untameable, that's why'

341
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,960
Loafing!

342
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,660
When he was young
he went around picking fights, alright!

343
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,960
At this age...why can’t he just
spend time with the grandkids?

344
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,480
Instead…

345
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,320
“Groom from Bombay”
How proud they all were!

346
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,400
I am the one suffering now

347
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,890
Aunty, it is “Mumbai"

348
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,840
Ya right!

349
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,040
Look, you have put
too much salt in this

350
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,230
Add tamarind water
Your Uncle won't like it

351
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,960
As if she is the
only good cook around

352
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,820
Taking on other people's fights!

353
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,050
They have all agreed
to build houses

354
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,400
Why should he go and interfere?

355
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
Ma, is this the first time
this is happening?

356
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,500
Come here, I need
to speak to you

357
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,830
Listen, speak to your father directly

358
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,680
As if I don’t know

359
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,260
Hey!
Tell me this

360
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,220
You grew up right here, correct?

361
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,360
This salary and job became possible
from here right?

362
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,790
Now why do you find
Dharavi unacceptable?

363
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,730
Is your wife provoking you?

364
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,080
- Hey, What did I do?
- Why do you involve her?

365
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,140
Let Dharavi end with me
I don’t want it for my kids

366
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,870
Fine. Tell your wife
to stop watching Hindi soaps

367
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
Hey, which bone did you break today?

368
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,980
Nothing Ma

369
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,540
Like father, like son
Uncle was also fighting

370
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,510
He will fight, of course!
Let me see how long

371
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,840
Even the daughters-in-law
don’t respect me

372
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,880
See...

373
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,240
I can buy him some meat...

374
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,160
...and make some soup for my husband

375
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,560
What will I give this one?
"VIGITARIAN" he will say

376
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,720
Aunty! It is not "VIGITARIAN"
It’s VEGETARIAN

377
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,620
So?!

378
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,110
I can only say VIGITARIAN
So what?

379
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,860
Hey, why are you hurting my son?

380
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,990
- As if he is a child
- You know it only now!

381
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,090
He has no brains

382
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,020
Don’t you have aplenty?
Give him some

383
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,350
Kids!

384
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,680
Don’t fight when you play

385
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,810
- Soori!
- What is it, Ma?

386
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,530
Why are you letting the money fly?

387
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,500
Where?

388
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,180
Speak money and
he will be all ears

389
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,420
- Rajappa!

390
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:24,870
Yes Akka

391
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,060
A friend must give good counsel

392
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,800
Why are you provoking him?

393
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,560
- You are always right
- Maama, sit facing the east

394
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,550
Why now?

395
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,830
Just do what I say

396
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,610
You are the talk of the town

397
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,230
Everyone was like...
“Kaala said this...Kaala did this”

398
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,820
You were the centre of attention

399
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,790
Listen, evil eyes should be warded off

400
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,880
- Akka!
- 'Ok?'

401
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,380
You yell at him non-stop

402
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,480
But still ward off the evil eye
What an art!

403
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,170
- Go on!
- 'Hey! Shut up'

404
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,260
Akka, wait!

405
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,550

- Look, the revolutionary is here

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,360
‘Hello, Nephew!’

407
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,010
Did you wash and dry
the clothes clean?

408
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,090
You are trending on facebook

409
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,320

413
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,790

420
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,550
Without him, they would have
washed clothes on your head

421
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,530
What say?

422
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,730

423
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,310
Leave me out of this

424
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,480
Tomorrow he will come with Bharathi...

425

...is Zareena Madam

604
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,680
She has won many international awards

605
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,080
For the urban poor
in African countries...

606
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,010

Her coming to Dharavi...

609
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,640
...was made possible

612
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,220
As our first task...

613
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,320
...we have to get a quotation
ready for the tender

614
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,530
We need to mention
our fundamental needs

615
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,720
Attach it with the quotation

616
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,270
If the Govt. likes it...

617
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,310
...they will pass our tender

618
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,310
- Am I right?
- 'Yes, Yes'

619
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,960
Now...

620
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,850
Let's list everything
we need, one by one

621
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,990
When you hurry
to the toilet in the morning...

622
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,560
...is it possible to
squat peacefully?

623
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,270
Non-stop knocking

624
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,720
We should first put an end
to this public toilet nuisance

625
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,670
Right! A toilet in each house
will be good

626
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,650
But, how will you
meet your lovers then?

627
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,400
That is where I met
my husband first

628
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,600
My parents never let me
step out of home

629
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,800
I would meet my husband
when I went to use the toilet

630
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,570
- ‘Go now, too’
- Buzz off

631
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,950
What other things
do you need?

632
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,840
Akka, we need a playground

633
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,860
We need schools
and colleges here

634
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,000
I want a Gym

635
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,780
Hospitals, drinking water,
good roads!

636
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,200
No privacy in the house
for a couple to sit and talk

637
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,320
You stay up like an
owl to hold hands

638
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,330
By the time you kiss…
That’s it

639
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,510
Ya right! You say your
side of the story

640
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,670
Such a tiny space
with adolescent kids

641
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,580
You know how embarrassing it is?

642
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,250
A place to lie down comfortably
at least before I die

643
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,640
That’s all!
- Bro!

644
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,710
Fellow students say that....

645
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,650
...Dharavi is a dump yard, an ugly place

646
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,460
We must change the
name “Dharavi” first

647
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,340
You are right!
Say the name Dharavi...

648
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,830
...and the police
pull you in some case

649
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,970
We have to make
the 'Vinayak' Temple bigger

650
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,590
That is our identity, right?

651
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,610
What about the Mosque?

652
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,340
So many Telugu and Tamil Muslims
helped build it

653
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,550
Let's not forget that

654
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,430
Cross road, 90 feet, Kalyanwadi…

655
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,080
...people should stop living in
neighborhoods divided by caste, Bro

656
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,070
‘Absolutely. Well said'

657
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,740
Ma'am!

658
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,480

659
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,110

660
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,500
I...

661
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,480
I was born and brought
up in Dharavi

662
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,870
My family lived
right here in Beema Chawl

663
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,600
Whose family there?!

664
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,310
We are Muslims from Tamilnadu

665
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,050
When I was in school...

666
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,100
once...

667
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,730
...a riot took place here

668
00:28:59,170 --> 00:28:59,930
That's when...

669
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,110
That's when we left

670
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,800
I have gone around
the whole world

671
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,720
Rio…in Brazil…

672
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,420
- The Olympics venue?!
- Yes!

673
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,760
That city has many big slums

674
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,020
There...

675
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,220
Even when I worked there

676
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,070
The place...

677
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,770
The place I was born...

678
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,680
...must also be like this
was my constant thought

679
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,750
But...

680
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,720
I couldn't come to Dharavi

681
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,670
It has happened today

682
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,650
I have come with a resolution

683
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,390
So...

684
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,070
But...

685
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,360
...I can’t do anything alone

686
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,230
It's our Dharavi

687
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,740
We must develop it together!

688
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,820
When Dharavi was a garbage dump
nobody worried about us

689
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,560
We are now the
centre of the city, right?

690
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,100
Everyone’s eyeing us now
- Rightly said

691
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,660
Govt. is backing them too

692
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,840
We have to be careful

693
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,410
If we stand together
nobody can do anything

694
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,750
-'Salaam'. 'Salaam'
- Sure Bawa. One tight slap!

695
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,210
- Yes Kaala
- We must!

696
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,170
Electricity Board, I tell you!

697
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,750
- Sister, good tea. See you
- Thanks, Anna

698
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,430
Bawa!

699
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,780
A new group has joined hands
with “Arise” Movement, you heard?

700
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,190
For every new building in Dharavi...

701
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,760
...Perumalsamy gets two flats free

702
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,650
Like a bribe

703
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,540
These people are
unaware of it

704
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,890
Why can’t they consult us?

705
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,510
- Haven’t you slept Bhavani?
- Not yet, Anna

706
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,330
Nobody's here, Bawa

707
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,330
Ya!

708
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,910

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,720
W-W-When did you come?
Did you e-e-eat anything?

726
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,610
- Are...you good?
- Why? What happened?

727
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,450
Is your mouth
typing a telegram?

728
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,570
'Calm down! Relax!'

729
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,140
'My Akka is making amends!'

730
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,360
Coffee or tea?

731
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,980
‘COFFEE, COFFEE!’
She drinks...

732
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,600
'Coffee, it seems
You haven’t forgotten?!'

733
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,490
Rajappa!

734
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,360
Akka!

735
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,250
Come in

736
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,060
Get up from here

737
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,030
You too
- Ok Akka

738
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,240
Hey, Akka is creating
a space for my Bawa!

739
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,000
Get in all of you

740
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,260
- Move
- ‘Are you all here?’

741
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,940
Go clean the jeep, go

742
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,820
Akka, give me a coffee too

743
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,240
'Bawa, You carry on'

744
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Hey, Kiddos! Stop peeping

745
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,720
Get in

746
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,150
Bawa is struggling to talk
Staring at him!

747
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,320
(clears throat)

748
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,550
So nice Karikaala

749
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,570
It is so nice to see you

750
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,050
It's been so many years and...

751
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,380
You look...you look well

752
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,310
Wow!

753
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,910
You can talk so much, is it?

754
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,670
It has taken me so many years
to know this

755
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,770
So...

756
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,510
How are you, then?

757
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,200
Are you going to be here from now?

758
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,770
Why?

759
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,000
You want to send me back?

760
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,630
I am going to be here

761
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,290
I am going to work here

762
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,610
I need to meet builders
regarding the tender

763
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,690
I need your help

764
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,710
I will stand by anything
that is good

765
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,060
Lenin works with you, right?

766
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,610
Lenin…

767
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,590
Lenin is very supportive

768
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,170
You have brought him up well

769
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,910
Very active…Bold…

770
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,750
Just like you!

778
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,650
Why less?
Add more...

779
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,510
No!

780
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,400
'Sugarless coffee is all you will get'

781
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,180

S...Sorry!

785
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,710
Coffee is good

I know Englees!

788
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,840
- Thanks
- 'Nice'

789
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,600
'No mention'

790
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,380
- Akka. Come here
- Ya!

791
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,490
Joking unaware of the situation

792
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,030
What is it?
What?

793
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,800
Ex- lovers have met

794
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,870
They will have so much to talk

795
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,280
Why are you a hindrance?

796
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,050
One slap
your head will turn

797
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,610
Charumathi!

798
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,090
Ey, Bharathi!
Look, she is calling

799
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
She only responds
if you call her 'Bharathi'

800
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,600
- Wait. Eat something
- No. No

801
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
My daughter is waiting

802
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,810
- Some other day
- Alright

803
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,290
See you all

804
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,200
'Come often, Bawa will like it’

805
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,240
Bye, Karikaala

806
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,160
See you

807
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,790
'Lenin!'

808
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,790
Akka!

809
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,590
How do they drink this?

810
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,910
Why do you drink it then?

811
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,660
Those days…

812
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,570
'…this land was filled with
sludge and wild grass'

813
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,800
'When our people came here
for jobs, with their kith and kin'

814
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,740
'Veerayyan would
help them make huts'

815
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,270
'He was the centre of everything'

816
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,670
'Huts with 4 logs and a tarpaulin'

817
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,390
'Then half built walls and tin roofs'

818
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,840
'We owe our life here, today...'

819
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,550
'...to your grandpa Veerayyan'

820
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,980
'Every time...'

821
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,030
'...we tried to set up a place
there were so many problems'

822
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,560
'This Hari...'

823
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,080
'...big leader...my foot!'

824
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,950
'He was a nobody
compared to Veerayyan'

825
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,300
'Hari was supported by the ruling party'

826
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,140
They waited till we
took a space, readied it and built houses

827
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,280
Then they would come to...

828
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,150
...chase our people away

829
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,760
Brave Veerayyan!
He would not allow it

830
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,210
'Youngsters from the make-shift dorms
backed him'

831
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,550
'Hands that toiled in farms
Won't they know to take up arms?'

832
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,370
'Hari Daada couldn’t do anything here'

833
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,890
'Veerayyan ruled over Dharavi like that'

834
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,260
Hari couldn’t take it

835
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,420
Suddenly...

836
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,650
...Indira Gandhi declared Emergency

837
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,860
'Hari used the situation
and entered Dharavi with the police'

838
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,130
'To protect themselves
Veerayyan and Kaala...'

839
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,980
'...jumped into
Pathamadai Ayub’s house'

840
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,220
'There was no electricity back then'

841
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,350
It was pitch-black

842
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,490
Zareena came with a chimney lamp
and stood in front of Kaala

843
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,250
Wow! Just wow!

844
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,120
Bawa was swept away

845
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,710
Uncle's heart must have
skipped a beat, right?

846
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,200
Absolutely. Absolutely!

847
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,280
'Akka. Look!'

848
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,490
They had just started
SIWS Junior College

849
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,130
My College...

850
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,370
the water pump
at the coconut tree chawl...

851
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,490
at the toilet near the temple...

852
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
...Aurora theatre

853
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,210
I didn't miss out
on a single place

854
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,300
I followed her
like a madman

855
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,090
The news about our love
spread like wildfire

856
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,520
We never expected that...

857
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,890
his relatives and my relatives...

858
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,730
...would accept
our relationship so soon

859
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,760
A life with my favorite person...

860
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,610
...was starting and I was excited about it

861
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,500
Thinking about it
makes me happy still!

862
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,710
But…

863
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,010
In his desperation
to take over Dharavi...

864
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,870
this Hari Daada...

865
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,180
...was trying to finish
off Veerayyan somehow

866
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,190
He used Kaala’s wedding
as an opportunity

867
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,840
They killed anyone
who came their way

868
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,360
Our people didn’t know what to do

869
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Hari Daada slaughtered Veerayyan
in front of Kaala’s eyes

870
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,140
The wedding stage was blazing

871
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,100
That day, that fire...
separated Kaala and Zareena forever

872
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,840
Our dreams went up in flames

873
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,780
To get to know
that Karikaaladu was fine...

874
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,470
...took me so many years

875
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,180
Fearing the riots,
my grandparents...

876
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,830
...took me to Nasik

877
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,150
At that age I couldn’t
decide what to do

878
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,890
A Pastor sent me
to the US to study

879
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,850
Showing riots as a reason
they banished Kaala

880
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,460
Almost like an exile
We didn’t know where

881
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,070
Kaala was so lost
with no information on Zareena

882
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,950
We couldn't find out
about her at all

883
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,840
He started growing the beard
Hasn’t taken it since

884
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,570
'I got married unaware of all this'

885
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,790
Hindi sad songs, all the time

886
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,210
♪ Between you and me ♪
It would go on and on

887
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,660
Will I be quiet?

888
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,660
I would even the score
with an "Ilayaraja" song

889
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,520
‘Zareena!’
He would call in a hurry

890
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,890
Then he will salvage it somehow

891
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,750
I used to curse my fate

892
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,570
Doesn't dad love you?

893
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,760
Go ask Kaala that!

894
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,970
He is a nobody
without this Swarna

895
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,180
'Aunty!'

896
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,610
I think Uncle is smitten by Zareena

897
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,440
Why wouldn’t he!

898
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Doesn’t she look like "Madhuri Dixit"?

899
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,920
'Hey! My Akka is the best'

900
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,110
Come in, Zareena

901
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,150
No. I got some work

902
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,470
Lenin?!

903
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Lenin?
Let me call him

904
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,150
Hey Lenin!

905
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,170
Where is he?
Hey, LENIN!

906
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,180
- Pa?
- Uncle?

907
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,870
- Wh..wh...where is he?
- What happened Uncle?

908
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,960
- WHERE?
- Up there

909
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,460
There!

910
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,060
Where the hell did he disappear?

911
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,530
- Hey! Come soon
- What happened?

912
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,650
- Zareena is waiting
- Who?!

913
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,290
Zareena is waiting!

914
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,250
Quick. Go

915
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,500
'Hello, Madam'

916
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,510
What is happening?
- 'Were you busy?'

917
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,750
'I was getting ready'

918
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,180
What's all this ruckus?

919
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,030
'Looks like it will rain'

920
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,660
'Ya.Ya.'

921
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,120
- Lets leave?
- Yes

922
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,680
- Bye - See you

923
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,520

…is still clear in my memory

958
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,540
I was so scared

959
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,870
The way you were
looking at me!

960
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,830
I know

961
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,370
You covered your knees
when I saw you

962
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,370
Threw a dupatta over yourself

963
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,340
You were wearing
a rose colour shirt and...

964
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,150
...a brown colour skirt

965
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,590
It hasn't left my eyes still

966
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,980
Wow!

967
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,300
How well you remember!

968
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,240
Do you like me so much?

969
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,480
Beyond words

970
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,150
Until now

971
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,290
I never thought...

972
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,330
...this would happen

973
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,910
But, this life…

974
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,590
…is so strange

975
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,020
It realises some dreams

976
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,670
And ruins some realities

977
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:21,730
Sorry!

978
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,080
Listen, how are you
so young still?

979
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Very funny!

980
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,230
I am being serious

981
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,280
Look at me

982
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,200
Old and grayed!

983
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,230
But you?

984
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,450
Thanks

985
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,670
My daughter’s friends
say this too

986
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,420
Hey, I was just joking

987
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,090
You took that seriously

988
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,700
Don’t you feel that
you missed me?

989
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,840
I feel that a lot

990
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,740
That we will
meet again like this...

991
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,190
...never occurred to me

992
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,820
Swarna trusts me so much

993
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,140
I should make sure that
she isn't disheartened, even mildly

994
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,250
Because...

995
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,640
...I am her universe

996
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,760
Just me

997
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,650
Even now...

998
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,380
...she would know
that I am meeting you

999
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,490
But she didn't say a word!

1000
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,740
Your life...

1001
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,480
...will not be affected
even a bit by me

1002
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,100
Don't ever fear that

1003
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,330
I know

1004
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:18,930
What is this, Karikaala!

1005
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,280
I am not your Zareena

1006
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:25,570
I have changed

1007
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,300
Completely

1008
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,390
To be that person
in your memories...

1009
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,730
...is all I want

1010
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,870
I...I...feel
a bit weird

1011
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,160
Like, Swarna...

1012
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,460
...is right...
next to you

1013
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,450
Let’s go Karikaala

1014
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,280
Please...

1015
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,450
...don’t call me that

1016
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,700
Ok!

1017
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,560
I will leave now

1018
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,320
♪ My darling

Sleeping with my eyes open
Can’t you see?

1024
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,280
Hey!

1025
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,950
I just went to have
a chat with her

1026
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,900
Did you?

1027
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,650
My eyes were filled with you

1028
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,360
I couldn’t even look at her

1029
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,950
Oh! What flattery!

1030
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,360
Look! I am going
to my native place

1031
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:47,890
Why?

1032
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,690
You think only
you had lovers?

1033
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,700
I was in Grade 8
at a Govt. school

1034
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,730
Walked all the way

1035
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,350
Drum player Perumal

1036
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,690
Was behind me like a madman

1037
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
I liked him as well

1038
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,530
But you
brought me here

1039
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,480
Listen, book a ticket

1040
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,460
I will go
have a chat with him

1041
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,980
Just like you

1042
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,080
Rules should be the same, right?

1043
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,580
Hey!! Swarna...

1044
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:11,970
Swarna...!

1045
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,000
She is not the Zareena
I had known

1046
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,500
She seems like another person

1047
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,100
She feels that
I have changed too

1048
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,220
Really?

1049
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,100
Why would I lie?

1050
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:20,900
Then say that you love me

1051
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:21,590
Hey!

1052
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,810
You won’t say, is it?

1053
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,600
Hey... No...No…
I love you my dear

1054
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,300
I love you my darling

1055
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,590
I feel like crying
But I won’t

1056
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,580
Why should I?

1057
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,290
No…No…
You shouldn’t cry my darling

1058
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:34,930
I love you

1059
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,040
So...

1060
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,420
...were you really
in love with Perumal?

1061
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,220
It’s raining. Wow!

1062
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,810
-Good rains right?
- Ya right!

1063
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:58,970
Bawa!

1064
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,140
Same message is being forwarded
for the 9th year now

1065
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,400
Idiots. I am receiving

00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,570
‘Really?’

1067
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,750
We are going to do what
no one else could in Dharavi?

1068
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,420
How you made fun always!

1069
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,720
Watch what we do now!

1070
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,590
- Is it?
- 'On my way Madam'

1071
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,820
My dear Nephew!
Is Dharavi getting a golden makeover?

1072
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,540

'Nobody can criticize us anymore'

1075
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,790
Ya, ya!

1076
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,010
'Bring that hero
of your Asura clan too'

1077
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,590
- 'OK?'
- Ya!

1078
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,360
‘Dharavi: Now
Let’s see how this is going to change'

1079
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,620

'You can avail free treatment
ONLY during weekends'

1089
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,090
- Noticed the golf ground? - Superb
'Where do we get money for this?'

1090
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,710
'Let’s sell the buildings
along the main road'

1091
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
What do you think?

1092
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,420
That's not our sector
- 'We don't need freebies'

1093
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,960
- 'This side'
- 'Now you think!'

1094
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,280
'Isn't this a silent revolution
for quality!'

1095
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,320
- Thank you so much
- Thank you!

1096
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,880
So kind of you!
Thank you

1097
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,490
- Thank you so much, Sir
- Thank you so much

1098
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,620
Wow!

1099
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,440
It’s so overwhelming

1100
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,040
Saw how our new Dharavi
will look?

1101
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,050
Huh?

1102
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,560
Our Architect sir...

1103
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,510
...and our Builder
deserve a round of applause

1104
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,950
Dharavi WILL have a new name!

1105
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,670
Dharavi will be
truly liberated now

1106
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,390
Yay! My friends will visit me now
Superb!

1107
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,650
Sir, why do we need a golf course?

1108
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,730
Cricket, football and kabadi
are our games, right

1109
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:46,940
Hey! Quit blabbering

1110
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,790
Lenin!

1111
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,650
What’s wrong in what he said?

1112
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,300
Why do we need a golf course?

1113
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,930
Hey! It’s ok. It’s ok

1114
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,870
Everything has to become
high- class

1115
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,110
'Otherwise, how will your friends
respect you?'

1116
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,070
- 'Huh?'
- 'Exactly!'

1117
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,520
Your happiness...

1118
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,660
...is our priority

1119
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,630
Zareena Ma’am is here
to do exactly this

1120
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,880
This is a victory
for all of us!

1121
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,510
Ey!

1122
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,410
Applaud for Hari Daada’s victory!

1123
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,060
What are you looking at?

1124
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,180
Idiots! Go on

1125
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,950
Carry on! Louder

1126
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:17,930
You will never understand!

1127
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,030
What are you all talking about?

1128
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,080
Because Vishnu
can’t do anything directly...

1129
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,580
...you have come
in the name of change is it?

1130
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,050
He appreciates you
and you praise him

1131
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,930
You think we are mad!

1132
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,180
Uncle, you have started
your nonsense, is it?

1133
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,080
Hey! Why are you threatening him?

1134
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,600
Isn’t that the truth!

1135
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,360
Don’t you know
who Manu Builder is?

1136
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,680
Shiva, why are you
saying this?

1137
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,330
Good things are happening in Dharavi
Be happy

1138
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,590
You want these people
to live in this muck?

1139
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,910
Who came to us
when we were living in muck?

1140
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:44,990
Now...

1141
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,570
...because we have made it liveable

1142
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,460
They come drooling!

1143
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,750
We have Bandra Kurla complex
on one side

1144
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,280
And 5 railway stations around

1145
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,490
'Commuting from Dharavi
to anywhere in Mumbai is easy'

1146
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,250
That's the reason

1147
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,660
MLA sir, wait!
Don’t misinterpret this

1148
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,670
This is not our motive
'Who is this half-wit?'

1149
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,610
Stadiums and golf grounds
it seems

1150
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,400
It takes 74 acres
to build a golf ground

1151
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,190
Let's say you build it in 50 acres!

1152
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,270
Why should we give all that land
and end up in 225 sq.ft houses?

1153
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,570
Are we idiots to exchange
a goldmine for chaff?

1154
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,720
Ey! Bharathi

1155
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,030
Attached toilets in a house
is enough, is it?

1156
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,130
Ya! You will raise buildings here

1157
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,920
Won’t Kaala’s reputation be dented?

1158
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,000
- Hey!
- Ey!

1159
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,560
How will he survive then?

1160
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,450
He needs a share, Madam

1161
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,730
Give him that
He will be quiet

1162
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,750
Come let’s go
-'Silence!'

1163
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,000
Nonsense!

1164
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,610
Stop it
Stop it, I said

1165
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,250
So many Govts.
So many builders

1166
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,740
But nothing has changed

1167
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,620
Nothing has changed
since the time I left

1168
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,410
You have concerns, you have problems?
Then give it to me in writing

1169
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,200
KARIKAALA!

1170
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,450
You create a ruckus and
leave without a word?!

1171
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,000
Huh?

1172
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,140
Listen, let me come
straight to the issue

1173
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,740
This is our land

1174
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,430
Land that our ancestors created

1175
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,150
Ask the Govt. to help us

1176
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,490
We will build our own houses

1177
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,650
And keep it clean

1178
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,490
I guarantee you that
We all do

1179
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,990
What do you all say?
- (people agree)

1180
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,130
Govt. will do everything, is it?

1181
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,900
What will the Govt. do then?

1182
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,670
Don’t say that the Govt. is in debt

1183
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,700
Govt. officials and politicians
steal off welfare schemes and live comfortably

1184
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,610
Where did that money come from?

1185
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,690
'On the point!'

1186
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,020
You sell this land now, right now

1187
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,330
Just the land will fetch you
400 billion!

1188
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,830
You want us to give it all up
and live like losers?

1189
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,220
Hey, Rebel leader!
Shut this market and come home

1190
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,560
Infuriating…!

1191
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
Stupid people!

1192
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,320
Give me that spanner

1193
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,550
'Why are you breaking it?
Ma, don't interfere'

1194
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,070
'What?'

1195
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,140
Grandpa...Lenin Pa is
breaking something

1196
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,710
Let's just do our job, alright?

1197
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,860
Ey! Where are you going?

1198
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,860
- Listen to me
- Let go off me

1199
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,360
I am going to slap you now

1200
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,510
Where are you going?
- Ey!

1201
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,670
All that you broke now
are what I earned

1202
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,790
What your brothers earned

1203
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,770
I will break it all

1204
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,320
So biased all the time

1205
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,250
Say to my face that
I have no rights

1206
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,340
Beating around the bush

1207
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,870
Chi...why are you crying?

1208
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,880
Why did I give you that
Revolutionary's name

1209
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,070
I am unable to even yell at you

1210
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,620
Did I ask you?
I will change that name

1211
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,480
You keep quiet!

1212
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,700
Don’t cry my darling

1213
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,370
Let’s change that name

1214
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,470
We will call you Veerayyan...
Not that name

1215
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,750
Keep my dad's name
"Muniayya"

1216
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:38,290
Ma!

1217
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,680
I look funny to you too?

1218
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,140
Ganging up

1219
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,760
Hey, does it look like a movie hall?
Get lost, I warn you

1220
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,260
It’s ok dear

1221
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,140
What?

1222
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,160
We gathered a group
to do some good things

1223
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,730
He ruined it all

1224
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,890
Only he knows everything

1225
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,650
Ya...

1226
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,680
We are the pawns for your rebellion?

1227
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,700
Why not?
Are you the decision maker here?

1228
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,700
Lenin, watch your tongue!

1229
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,890
I am quite
because you are my brother

1230
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,260
What will you do?
Lay a finger, and you will get no respect

1231
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,800
What will you do?

1232
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,290
How dare you talk back!
I will slap you tight

1233
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,510
- Going on and on
- Wait! Relax!

1234
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,830
This is between us!

1235
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:14,600
Hey!

1236
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,600
The girl you are in love with, Bharathi

1237
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,170
Have you ever gone to her building?

1238
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,910
15 people live in those houses, suffocated

1239
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,370
Why do we need buildings
if we get only the space of a hut

1240
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,200
So?

1241
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,600
Show me a place wtihout problems!

1242
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,290
He has come to construct apartments...

1243
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,430
...not bungalows

1244
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,650
They come with money in mind
not people's welfare

1245
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,320
How will they build good houses?

1246
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,780
Hari Daada that too…

1247
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:38,070
When was the rich
concerned about the poor?

1248
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,730
Show me one unselfish person
Let me see?

1249
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,090
This is why...

1250
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,050
...you shouldn't do anything

1251
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
We shouldn’t do anything, is it?

1252
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,560
And you? Rowdyism is all you know

1253
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,730
YES! I am a rowdy

1254
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,650
People you bring are good?

1255
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,000
With money and power
rowdies become patrons!

1256
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,450
No understanding
of the land and it's people

1257
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,760
You read 2 books and go around
muttering change and revolution

1258
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,280
Understand the basics first!

1259
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,210
Yes sir, our heads are filled with clay

1260
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,950
Siva Anna

1261
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,700
You started it all, right?

1262
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,080
Poor Zareena madam

1263
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,210
So much blood

1264
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,810
Let them rot here

1265
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,200
All for them and...

1266
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,680
Oh! Wow!

1267
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,610
Everyone’s going to cry
that he is not leading their revolution!

1268
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,070
Go on! Leave

1269
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,260
I will, ofcourse

1270
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,110
I have an education and a job
I will take care of myself

1271
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,240
Slipper me if I ever
talk on their behalf

1272
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,420
Imbeciles...

1273
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,870
Muck-brains!
That's why they live in this dirt

1274
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,110
Who do you call dirty?!

1275
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,170
- Don't
- Maama

1276
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,210
Dirt is it

1277
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,460
Dei...Dei

1278
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,530
Kaala is angry

1279
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,480
Cry

1280
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,830
Don’t talk to him Pa

1281
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,890
'He has gone mad'

1282
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,730
'Cry I said'

1283
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,170
'Cry, you idiot'

1284
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,000
Yes!

1285
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,140
We are dirty and poor

1286
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,160
You grew up comfortably right

1287
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,120
That’s why these 'muck-brains'
appear low to you

1288
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,020
According to you...
whether we like it or want it

1289
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,840
We must live on the road you lay

1290
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,520
Drink the water you pour

1291
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,280
And eat the rice you give away

1292
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,520
If we refuse, you will say
"Starving dogs..."

1293
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,110
"...look at their audacity"

1294
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,570
Someone like you has
no place in my house

1295
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,210
Get out!

1296
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,500
Only if you suffer
you will understand life

1297
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,270
Ey! Send him out

1298
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,510
- Send him I said
- Maama, wait

1299
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,170
Where will he go?
Doesn't he have to think?

1300
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,560
He thought we will
stop him from going

1301
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,990
If you push him to leave
where will he go?

1302
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,300
Poor thing

1303
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,690
My sweet heart!
Dei

1304
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,350
Go be some place good

1305
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,790
Eat at the right time

1306
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,420
Take care of your health
My dear one. Ok?

1307
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,920
WHA...?

1308
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,920
What is this crowd, huh?

1309
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,390
My dear Nephew!
Going on a tour?

1310
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,020
Huh?

1311
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,010
What a swanky bag!
Long trip, is it?

1312
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,530
Buy me a souvenir
when you come

1313
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,080
Hey, cat on the wall...

1314
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,560
I will kill you first

1315
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,730
Why are you getting irked?

1316
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,180
Get in. All of you

1317
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,030
(religious chants)

1318
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,310
Oh Lord Ganpathi!
'Moriya!'

1319
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,360
Hey, isn't the elevator working?

1320
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,760
'Where are you going?'

1321
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:37,750
Hey!

1322
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,270
Are we here or further up?

1323
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,400
Come!

1324
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,900
Where are you going, Akka?

1325
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,230
To the Temple, Bharathi

1326
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,210
Ok!

1327
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,070
Come

1328
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,570
Let's go out

1329
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,800
Lenin!

1330
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,440
Think about it, Lenin

1331
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,740
I feel that Kaala is...

1332
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,530
...doing the right thing

1333
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,350
- Siva
- Ma, shall we move?

1334
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,660
- Where is Dad?
- Back there!

1335
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,190
Ey! Quick

1336
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,490
You know Zareena's house
for sure, right?

1337
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,860
I know, Kaala
Come, let’s go

1338
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,370
Don’t drop me off
somewhere else

1339
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,620
Kaala, I know every
nook and corner here

1340
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,830
Why are you scared
like a kid?

1341
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,970
Scared is it?!
Move

1342
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,560
Why are you getting tensed Kaala?

1343
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,540
Hurry up!

1344
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:51,890
- Sit, fast
-Kaala is going alone somewhere!

1345
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,980
Brother, Kaala is going via Sion
We got a call

1346
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:56,490
What?

1347
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,570
Kaala is going alone

1348
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,740
We can finish him off now

1349
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:00,490
- Sure, it’s him?
- Yes

1350
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,050
- Confirmed?
- Yes!

1351
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,850
He is right here
Quick! Quick

1352
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,810
Take left!

1353
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:22,730
This is the house, Kaala

1354
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,720
Why are you scared Kaala?
I am here with you right?

1355
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,380
Cool

1356
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,720
Hey! Buzz off

1357
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,160
See, didn’t I tell you?

1358
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,570
Leave…!

1359
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,080
Carry on! Have fun!

1360
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:58,860
Hi...!

1361
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,090
Hi...!

1362
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,390
Kaeira, go to the other room

1363
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,310
Kaeira, beautiful name!

1364
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,520
Kaeira means Black in Greek right?

1365
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,830
Yes. It means “Kaala”

1366
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,550
Kaeira finish your homework. Go

1367
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,430
You both talk
I'll go. Ok?

1368
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,370
Errr...

1369
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,590
I don’t know what to say!

1370
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,180
If you were alright...

1371
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,070
...none of this will matter

1372
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,810
KARIKAA…

1373
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:28,790
Sorry

1374
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,550
I am totally fine

1375
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,670
I heard that you were hurt
That’s why I came to see you

1376
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:35,460
Thanks!

1377
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,130
Thanks a lot Karikaala!

1378
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,500
Sorry, Sorry!
I should call you KAALA

1379
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,130
So much concern!

1380
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,000
I am ok!

1381
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,610
I will leave now

1382
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,200
What good has come
to the people who trust you?

1383
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,390
What were you doing
all these days?

1384
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,630
Could you bring a single builder?

1385
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,330
That poor Architect…

1386
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,560
So...

1387
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,800
What you say
must happen here, is it?

1388
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,140
You know nothing beyond rowdyism

1389
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,740
I am not the one
to get scared of all this

1390
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:08,700
Don’t spill your words in anger

1391
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,250
You don’t realise
who is behind all this

1392
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,890
That’s the truth!

1393
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,000
That Hari…

1394
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,390
…can’t be involved directly

1395
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,500
He comes disguised as a builder
behind your NGO

1396
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,470
You are just crazy
refusing to see this

1397
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,350
Stop it!

1398
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,690
Don’t judge me!

1399
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,850
Crazy, is it?
Am I crazy?

1400
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,190
I know what I am!

1401
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:26,890
Ok?

1402
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,670
I was born here too

1403
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,190
You treat me like
I support Hari Daada

1404
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,970
You want to settle
your enmity with him

1405
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,090
And you use people
as lambs to this slaughter

1406
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,380
I won’t let it happen

1407
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,210
I know how exactly
to implement this scheme

1408
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,090
I will do it, Mr. KAALA

1409
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,210
Hello…

1410
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,030
"Africa- return" Madam

1411
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,580
I will always be
selfish about our rights

1412
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:02,700
My people are not lambs
to be slaughtered by anybody

1413
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,310
You can't lay a single brick
in the name of Manu Builders!

1414
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,560
Listen Kaeira’s mother!

1415
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,440
You haven’t seen my
downright rowdyism yet!

1416
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,790
You will!

1417
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,450
Got it?
Please do!

1418
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,750
Karikaala!

1419
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,320
Hey! Don’t roam
the streets aimlessly, alright?

1420
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,920
I am not doing that Kaala

1421
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,570
Concentrate on taking care
of your mother, alright?

1422
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Ok!

1423
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,250
Hey, why are you going this way?

1424
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,690
Let’s- Let's go this way, Kaala

1425
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,140
Why are you turning around?
We have to go this way

1426
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,690
Kaala, wait…

1427
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:00,730
Why this detour?

1428
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,770
Why are you doing this?

1429
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,320
- What happened?
- Kaala!

1430
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,710
They have rounded us up

1431
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,360
Stop the bike
I said stop!

1432
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,370
Hey! Go

1433
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,840
Kaala!

1434
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,990
Step back, I said

1435
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,250
What’s up guys?

1436
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:31,850
Setup is it?

1437
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,100
I, Veerayyan’s Son,
Am standing all alone

1438
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,050
Come on, if you have the guts!

1439
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,090
Let’s fight it out

1440
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,230
Pa!

1441
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,810
I will finish you off first...

1442
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,480
...then your father

1443
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,180
I will kill you

1444
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,540
- Bro! Come let’s go
- Let's move

1445
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:45,990
Beemji!
Come

1446
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,370
Couldn't you have told me?

1447
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,480
You sent our son
anyway, right

1448
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,840
Even if you don’t utter a word
your every breath tells me...

1449
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,160
...what runs in your head!

1450
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:34,830
Oh!

1451
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,540
Is it?

1452
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,640
Tell me what I am thinking now?

1453
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,780
I know, Mr. Karikaala!

1454
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,320
'KAALA!'

1455
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,090
'KAALA!'

1456
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,990
What happened?

1457
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,060
KAALA!

1458
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,420
They killed my son!

1459
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,940
My son is hanging dead!

1460
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,870
My son is hanging dead there, Kaala

1461
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,860
My son is hanging there

1462
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,410
'BEEMJI!'

1463
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,960
'Look what they have
done to you'

1464
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,920
'Who else do I have?'

1465
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:22,960
'Oh! Damn!'

1466
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,530
Beema!

1467
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,730
'When will I hear you
sing after this?'

1468
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,130
Kaala!

1469
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,370
Come!
Bring him down

1470
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,200
♪ Will he come alive?
Tell us Kaala!

1471
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,680
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

1472
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:51,210
♪ How many more lives?
Tell us Kaala

1473
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,520
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

1474
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,050
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

1475
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:59,190
We will get him
Where will he go?

1476
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,690
Sir?
'Where is Vishnu?'

1477
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,800
Right here, Sir
- 'Tell him, too'

1478
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,760
I will, Sir

1479
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,970
Sunil brother had called

1480
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,580
Hari Daada has told you
not to surrender

1481
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,790
It’s a matter of his prestige

1482
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,150
His men will come now

1483
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,990
Go with them

1484
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,310
Nobody can touch you!

1485
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,000
Being with them
is safer than the prison

1486
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,200
Ok?

1487
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,050
All ok?

1488
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,140
Let’s leave

1489
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:08,520
Patil, See you!

1490
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,940
Kill him, now!

1491
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,370
Hey! Kill me!

1492
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,300
Come on!

1493
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,280
They killed him, Sir

1494
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,370
(announcement on PA)

1495
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:05,950
Move! Give way please

1496
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,180
Anna, Move and give way

1497
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,640
Move all of you
Move

1498
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,950
Give way!

1499
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:15,690
Give way!

1500
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:44,180
Welcome! Welcome!
Hari Daada

1501
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,160
I am so glad
you came here!

1502
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:56,340
Right!

1503
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,960
You are Kaala Saet!

1504
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,270
I have heard a lot about you

1505
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,320
But seeing you
for the first time

1506
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,200
I see you everyday

1507
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,140
You are omnipresent!

1508
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,440
Great!

1509
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:14,870
Pleasure is ours

1510
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,670
Siva, my second son

1511
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,830
My friends

1512
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,710
Namaste

1513
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:29,860
My Sons, Daughters-in-law

1514
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,130
Namaste

1515
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:31,910
My wife

1516
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,110
Namashkar

1517
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,530
Thank you!

1518
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:36,890
It’s ok

1519
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,340
This is 'Aasami'

1520
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,330
Bawa, what about me?

1521
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,240
My close pal Rajappa!

1522
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,600
He looks like a good man

1523
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,600
You are right

1524
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,880
In his white and white…

1525
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,400
Shut up! Is it enough to wear white?

1526
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,080
He didn’t even drink water
from our house

1527
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:10,100
I wanted to meet the person
messing with my dreams

1528
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,540
Just came to take a look

1529
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:14,730
Take a good look then

1530
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,700
It was nice meeting you
and your family

1531
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,500
Now, let Dharavi be
a memory of your past

1532
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,470
Because from now
Dharavi will be mine

1533
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,610
Just mine!

1534
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,260
Sister, take care of him

1535
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,720
Hari Daada!

1536
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,460
I didn’t say
you could leave!

1537
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,370
You could have
entered Dharavi at will!

1538
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,770
But to leave
you need my permission

1539
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:07,020
Let's move!

1540
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,310
Take left

1541
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:20,170
Ok! Right!

1542
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:29,980
'Let me see'

1543
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,500
Hello, Sir

1544
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,350
They have blocked the entrance

1545
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,320
We are trying

1546
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,740
We are locked up here

1547
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,150
What are you doing, huh?
Do something!

1548
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,560
Patil, what happened?

1549
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,320
Sunil just called…They are…

1550
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:16,230
- Don’t tell me what’s happening there
- We are trying, Sir

1551
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,920
Daada, we are trapped
It will be difficult to get out

1552
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:24,220
We must shoot all of them down
Then we can leave

1553
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,900
How many bullets do you have?

1554
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:34,380
Hello

1555
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:35,990
'Has the Minister arrived?'

1556
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,670
'Ask him to call me'

1557
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,120
'Hey!
Look here!'

1558
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,060
What happened?

1559
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,260
Lost your sense of
East and West in Dharavi?

1560
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,690
Kaala’s house is right here

1561
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,710
Apologise and go home soon!

1562
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,120
Go!

1563
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,650
Give him way!

1564
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:54,510
Take permission and leave

1565
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,850
Can I leave?

1566
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,070
Kaala Saet, can I go?

1567
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,130
This is Black Fort

1568
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:32,790
My Fort!

1569
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:38,350
You can’t take even a
fistful of sand out of here

1570
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:40,270
Get out!

1571
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,600

01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,430
Ahaana, look here!

1584
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,170
- Grandpa!
- Show me

1585
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:33,640
Show me also

1586
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,530
Grandpa...

1587
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,790
Your video is on facebook

1588
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,350
Who is Kaala, Grandpa?

1589
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,150
Ravana!

1590
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:54,550
The Demon King!

1591
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,440
Thinks with his ten heads

1592
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,680
So...
Ram will kill Ravana?

1593
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,060
Grandpa, why are you laughing?

1594
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:21,660
Vaalmiki has written it that way!

1595
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,970
He must be killed right!

1596
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,180
Sir, this is Zareena

1597
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,090
ZAREENA!

1598
01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:00,200
She is working towards
getting people's consent

1599
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:02,100
Sir...

1600
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:05,610
Sir, I am very sorry about
what happened in Dharavi

1601
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,840
But...

1602
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,800
If your company refuses...

1603
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,580
...our people will really suffer

1604
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,070
Actually sir, there are
only very few people...

1605
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,560
...who are misguided in Dharavi

1606
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:20,450
'Because some people oppose
everyone shouldn't suffer, right?'

1607
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,100
I have always thought about
people's welfare

1608
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,460
'Absolutely'

1609
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,180
- What is his name?
- 'Who?'

1610
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:27,940
Kaala

1611
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,100
KAALA

1612
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,460
Ya, Kaala

1613
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,830
To err is human, right?

1614
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,400
For one person's mistake...

1615
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,620
...why punish another?

1616
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,290
Get the consent
for the scheme

1617
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,650
I will stand by you

1618
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,500
I want to make this country, clean...

1619
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,670
...and pure

1620
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:47,970
'Ya. Absolutely'

1621
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:48,910
'Thank you Sir'

1622
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,230
We were hoping the same

1623
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,050
And don't worry. We will get the consent
as soon as possible

1624
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:58,340
You come all the way from Africa

1803
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,150
"What you are talking"

1804
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,350
English, is it?

1805
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,620
Pa, I want to talk to you

1806
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:14,730
Go ahead, Son

1807
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,120
You are my universe!

1808
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,130
What do you want?
Go on

1809
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:19,920
Kids! Go in and sleep

1810
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,480
Why?

1811
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,290
Kids are just playing
Why send them?

1812
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,390
What do you want to talk?

1813
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,750
It is so nice to see
you and mom together

1814
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:32,780
You struggled to bring us up

1815
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,880
We live well now

1816
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,000
We have no other complaints

1817
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:37,880
But...

1818
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:40,160
Hey! Why are you hesitating?

1819
01:34:40,730 --> 01:34:41,720
Actually, Pa

1820
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,660
Because you disrespected Hari Daada...

1821
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,670
...his men are landing up
in this one's office

1822
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,710
He wanted to leave home

1823
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:50,180
I convinced him to
talk after the ceremony

1824
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:51,900
Leaving?

1825
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,660
Let us all leave!

1826
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,490
We are doing well in our lives

1827
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,090
Why compromise?

1828
01:34:57,210 --> 01:35:00,730
So many people have left Dharavi
after becoming Doctors and Engineers

1829
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,190
Why live in this hell?

1830
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,330
Atleast the next generation
can be peaceful, right!

1831
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,700
Who lacks peace now?

1832
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,050
Are you all scared?

1833
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,440
If they both were scared, they wouldn't
have brought us all up so well

1834
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,130
Have you forgotten?

1835
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:13,280
Who is he?

1836
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,510
Isn't he the one
who killed Veerayyan grandpa

1837
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,970
Listen...!
You should never fear

1838
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:18,960
Swarna...

1839
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,530
Didn't you tell them stories
of our brave Vijayanagara women?

1840
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,150
- What did you teach them?
- Like they will listen!

1841
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:26,910
You have decided to leave, right?

1842
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,960
Nobody here will stop you
Leave!

1843
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,740
You can't stay a minute more

1844
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,000
If you do...
I don't know what I will say

1845
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:34,040
Hey! Stop!

1846
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,430
Is this how you
speak to the children?

1847
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,200
Hey, listen...

1848
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,380
She is just joking

1849
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,290
Aunty! Why are you getting angry?

1850
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,180
We shouldn't say anything, is it?
It is for all our good, right?

1851
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:43,970
Ey!

1852
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,990
Staying united in tough times
is the nice part. Understand?

1853
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,900
It is such a small problem
Why are you pushing him around?

1854
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:55,900
One tight slap!

1855
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,280
Uncle, just shut up

1856
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,650
Such a drunkard!

1857
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,090
I am talking to my father

1858
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:01,020
- Mind your business
- EY!!!

1859
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,560
How dare you
disrespect elders!

1860
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,880
If you leave this place
problems will disappear, is it?

1861
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:09,070
You will change your place,
your language...

1862
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,440
...your food

1863
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,800
Leave your land and people
to live like a King elsewhere is that life

1864
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,240
If you want things to change
do it from here

1865
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:19,470
He left this house too

1866
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:20,620
But did he leave Dharavi?

1867
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,810
He and I might have
a million differences

1868
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,640
But I don't doubt
the respect he has for this land

1869
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,520
I am a tree
who grew right here

1870
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,130
Burn me or bury me
But right here!

1871
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:34,490
- Actually...
- 'Ey!'

1872
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:36,610
Another word and..
Get in!

1873
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:37,540
Go!

1874
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,350
Get inside

1875
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,240
'Go'

1876
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,490
'Let's talk in the morning'

1877
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,270
Think they can
take me for a ride

1878
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,520
Must show them my real self
now and then

1879
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,480
Rajappa!

1880
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,330
Bring that bottle here

1881
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:51,210
- Huh?
- It is ready

1882
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:52,530
- Right here
- Ey! Shut up

1883
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,530
Maama, sit now

1884
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:56,250
Maama!

1885
01:36:56,890 --> 01:36:58,360
Listen to me

1886
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,820
- Sit, Please
- For your sake

1887
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,880
Alright

1888
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,240
Idiot!

1889
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,070
Hey Patil!

1890
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,180
Come! Come!

1891
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:16,900
Sir!

1892
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,660
Why are you late, brother?

1893
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:19,620
The celebrations just got over

1894
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:20,600
It's ok

1895
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,600
'Rajappa!
Take care of them'

1896
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,260
Come Patil!

1897
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,920
Is half a bottle ok with you?

1898
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,710
Uncle! Calm down

1899
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:27,500
Hey! relax

1900
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,020
A whole army is here

1901
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,320
It's alright!
'Come! Come!'

1902
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,000
'All of you must eat'

1903
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:32,870
- Swarna!
- Huh?

1904
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,230
Is there enough food?

1905
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,620
Maama!
Keep quiet

1906
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:37,470
What's happening?

1907
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,940
What's up?

1908
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:40,010
So many of you are here

1909
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:41,860
There is a warrant for
Vishnu Bhai's murder

1910
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,350
Murderer has surrendered right?

1911
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:44,690
- Why are you here?
- Don't create problems now

1912
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:45,940
Come to the Police Station

1913
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:47,020
Come!

1914
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,290
Try laying a finger!

1915
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,350
Move back!

1916
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,000
Move!

1917
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,380
Grandpa!

1918
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,950
SSSHH!

1919
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,300
Relax
Don't worry

1920
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:17,030
Kids will get scared
Let's not create commotion

1921
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:19,060
- Patil
- Sir

1922
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:22,200
You want me to come to the station
Right?

1923
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,140
- Yes Sir
- Ok!

1924
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,350
Bawa! Hold on!

1925
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:26,790
What is this habit of
arresting at night?

1926
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,460
He will come in the morning

1927
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,720
Hey, Sivaji!

1928
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:34,230
How are you?
Kids are good?

1929
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,270
Make them study well!

1930
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,810
Maama!
Maama!

1931
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,400
Sir!

1932
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,960
Hi!

1933
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:48,980
Hi!

1934
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:49,880
Yes Sir!

1935
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:50,850
Hey, Sivaji

1936
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:53,010
I didn't study

1937
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,830
If only I had the chance to study...

1938
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:56,440
WHOA!

1939
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,790
We must educate the kids

1940
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:00,730
Sure Sir. Absolutely
- Ok?

1941
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,260
My father is there
I need to talk to him

1942
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,950
Education
Very Very important

1943
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,430
We didn't study

1944
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:11,490
The kids must study well

1945
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,720
- It's all your mercy
- EDUCATION

1946
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,410
Hey...Kumar!

1947
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:23,920
Who brought you here?

1948
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,160
Patil...
- Sir?

1949
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:27,430
Release him!
Huh?

1950
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:35,220
Oh!

1951
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,530
Couldn't handle
all the food you ate?

1952
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:41,150
Took a stroll to digest is it?

1953
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,990
One tight slap
they will get!

1954
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,200
Actually, Minister's
people approached me

1955
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,420
They wanted to settle
this by talking

1956
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,060
That's why I arranged to
meet without further delay

1957
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,400
Let's talk it out Anna

1958
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:01,090
Minister, is it?!

1959
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,160
Namaskar
Namaskar

1960
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,070
Live long!

1961
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:09,590
You have contacts
at ministerial level?

1962
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,670
Crafty guy you are!

1963
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:16,160
Can we fly
the peace flag now?

1964
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:16,890
Yes Anna

1965
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,150
Let's do that!

1966
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:20,020
Why sit here for that?

1967
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:23,760
Let's sit in front of my house
and resolve this matter

1968
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,390
Swarna will offer us hot coffee

1969
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:29,040
- What do you say, Kumar?
- Actually Anna

1970
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,220
- Hey Patil!
- Sir?

1971
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,720
Is this why you brought me here?

1972
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,230
Couldn't you have told me?

1973
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:35,390
Sir, wait...

1974
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,420
Come

1975
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,120
Let's go
- Hey, where are you going?

1976
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:39,800
I need to talk
Sit now

1977
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:43,630
Kumar!

1978
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,440
Who is this again?

1979
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,750
Anna, he is the Minister
Don't you know?

1980
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:50,440
OH!

1981
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:51,790
Minister?!

1982
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,250
Namaskar!

1983
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,390
Yes. Yes.
Sit

1984
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:56,000
Are you good?
- Ok. Ok

1985
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,180
Your wife and children are good?

1986
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:01,150
Which is our Ministry?

1987
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,450
Seeing good money?

1988
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,890
Money. Bribe?

1989
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,380
Anna, why are you doing this?

1990
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:08,270
- Just asking about bribes
- Just sit, I said

1991
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:09,710
Don't you know how to behave!

1992
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,860
Hari Daada's words have
a bearing in the Govt

1993
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:18,670
Ok?

1994
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:21,380
Nothing can happen in Dharavi
without your consent, I hear

1995
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,880
Is it?
Kumar was talking about it

1996
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,320
Is it?
- Yes Anna

1997
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:27,730
Hari Daada is a good, honorable man

1998
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,400
He will forgive you
if you apologise

1999
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,070
I will arrange for a meeting

2000
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:32,720
Seek apology!

2001
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:34,580
'Kumar!'

2002
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,430
Who is this guy?

2003
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,710
(man giggles)

2004
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:39,090
Hey, get out

2005
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,880
- What is that sound?
- Nothing

2006
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,150
Why are you resisting Saet?

2007
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,430
Such influential people...

2008
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,460
I am doing this for our good

2009
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,430
If you do something stupid

2010
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:50,370
You will land us all in trouble

2011
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,460
I am quiet only because
we have known each other

2012
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,210
I will break your head, open
Step back you idiot

2013
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,980
I thought you were a respectable man

2014
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:05,620
I am trying to
resolve this amicably

2015
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:08,250
Only because you have
people's support here

2016
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,080
Let me talk to Hari Daada

2017
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,260
Let's end this

2018
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,010
How many children do you have?

2019
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:17,660
Three, is it?

2020
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,450
Four
- FOUR?!

2021
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,830
A house for each of them

2022
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,880
A house in your name

2023
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,630
A place for your factory

2024
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:26,240
All this...

2025
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:27,220
For you

2026
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,180
Just don't interfere in this scheme

2027
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,800
(whispers)
Kumar...

2028
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:37,310
I won't hurt you
Come close

2029
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:38,670
(whispers)
What Anna?

2030
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:41,230
- Kumar!
- Yes

2031
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,860
Who is this idiot?

2032
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:45,090
Why are you doing this Anna?

2033
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,460
Are you kidding me?

2034
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,260
You won't get out alive

2035
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,970
Migrant dog!
You want to rule Mumbai?

2036
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:54,170
Ey!

2037
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:57,630
Get involved again and
I will crush you to death

2038
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,630
What fun!

2039
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,520
What absolute fun!

2040
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,000
Go ahead if you have the gall

2041
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:08,540
One more word and I will...

2042
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:16,770
(indistinct argument)

2043
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,630
Welcome!
Welcome!

2044
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,210
Hari Daada!

2045
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,560
Namaskar!

2046
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:36,700
You are here too, is it?!

2047
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,960
Tell me this...

2048
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,290
Who is this?

2049
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:42,340
Thug?

2050
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,090
Blabbering nonsense

2051
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,220
Who sends him for peace talks!

2052
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:49,290
I told you already
No more talks about Dharavi

2053
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:52,780
Bring it up again
You won't sparkle in white anymore

2054
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,650
''Meeting over''

2055
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,300
Ok?

2056
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:56,020
"Over. Meeting"

2057
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:59,650
You...I have my eyes on you

2058
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:01,990
How dare...

2059
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:09,660
Sivanna...

2060
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:11,280
...they are beating your father

2061
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,540
'They are beating up dad'

2062
01:44:18,570 --> 01:44:19,560
Apologise!

2063
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:20,700
Do it

2064
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,170
Touch Kaala's feet

2065
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,320
Buzz off, Idiot

2066
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,190
Kaala, this is not your mistake

2067
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,760
Who I am
Where I am from...

2068
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,500
...you don't seem to understand

2069
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:35,850
People fear me

2070
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,500
After all your mistakes...

2071
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:40,380
...I am ready to forgive you

2072
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,270
Release Kaala, right away!

2073
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,920
Release Kaala, right away!

2074
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,420
Release Kaala, right away!

2075
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:56,920
I have a status in this society

2076
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:02,310
Only I know the things I did
to arrive at this status

2077
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,960
How many people I killed!

2078
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:08,410
Right here in Dharavi...

2079
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,570
...how many riots I engineered!

2080
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:12,890
I am trying to forget it all

2081
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,120
But you keep reminding me

2082
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,360
When you killed Veerayyan, you didn't expect
his son to be the end of you

2083
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:22,890
Right?

2084
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:27,180
(slogans)

2085
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,700
(slogans)

2086
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,330
(slogans)

2087
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:33,470
Sir...

2088
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,010
Too many people have gathered outside

2089
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,080
Media is here as well

2090
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:37,930
Please...

2091
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:39,880
It is not advisable
to do anything now

2092
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:41,630
(glass shatters)

2093
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:46,220
(people revolt)

2094
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:57,180
Everyone gets a chance in life
to rectify their mistakes

2095
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,290
I have a good opportunity
to do the same

2096
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,270
You murdered Vishnu...

2097
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,080
Defeated me in the elections...

2098
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:07,340
Shamed me and...

2099
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:07,880
Daada...!

2100
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:11,500
Daada don't do anything now

2101
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,300
Please...please understand

2102
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:19,330
How dare you laugh!

2103
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,570
You have no fear

2104
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:26,640
The fearless and the idiot
are divided by a thin line

2105
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:30,070
You won't understand
even if I tell you

2106
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:31,480
Time will tell you

2107
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,610
Proof and Justice
will not matter then

2108
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,270
I won't do anything now

2109
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,730
All those people shouting outside...

2110
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,170
will put you on an altar, garland you
worship you and...

2111
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,970
...make you into a God
That must not happen

2112
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,570
Hey, let him go

2113
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,510
Laid a finger on me right!

2114
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,980
Ok dude!
OKAY!

2115
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:42,690
Why is he such a fanatic?!

2116
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,710
I want him to burn in hell

2117
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:46,110
How dare he hurt you!

2118
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:47,920
I am so angry that...

2119
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:50,200
...I want to hack him to pieces
and go to jail

2120
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,220
Hey! Shut up!

2121
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:53,250
You think I would let him hurt me?

2122
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,270
Wouldn't I have thrashed them all

2123
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:56,960
That's what I thought too
Can he lay a finger on my Maama?

2124
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,680
All that's fine
What is this on your face?

2125
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,870
You punched yourself, is it?
A mark of your valour?

2126
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:04,790
Stop laughing

2127
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,640
'He will rot to death'

2128
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:07,790
'Idiot!'

2129
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:10,010
Why did you let go of him?

2130
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,000
Of course I didn't

2131
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:12,260
I broke his mouth open

2132
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:14,250
I even brought a tooth
to make you believe

2133
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,440
Really? Let me see
- Yes

2134
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,270
It was right here
Where did it disappear? Where?

2135
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,310
Are you looking for this?

2136
01:48:19,330 --> 01:48:20,700
-Is it?
- Let go! Stop!

2137
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,460
Hey, why are you hiding that now?

2138
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,750
It is all going beyond limit

2139
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,780
She comes there
stands there and weeps...

2140
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,980
...and when I see
she wipes off her tears

2141
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:34,380
I don't know where
all this is going

2142
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:35,380
I will wait to watch

2143
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:36,910
Hey! Stop it

2144
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,480
Was she there?
- Huh?

2145
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,880
Look at your eyes widening!

2146
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:45,680
If I wasn't there
you would have married her, right?

2147
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,440
Tell me frankly
This heart can take it all

2148
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,830
I love you darling!

2149
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:54,820
Wow! Ppah!

2150
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:58,200
Your words filled my ears
and went straight to my heart

2151
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:10,980
Swarna!

2152
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:12,380
Swarna

2153
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:14,580
Are you ok?

2154
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,950
MAAMA!

2155
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:26,690
PA!

2156
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:43,910
Siva!

2157
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:52,460
Siva...!

2158
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:54,550
Siva!

2159
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:44,900
This house has lost its light!

2160
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:49,250
My Sister, my angel that fed me!

2161
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:52,430
Has left us forever

2162
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,170
The guardian of this house is dead!

2163
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:16,340
♪ She was the light of our lives
She has disappeared into the darkness

2164
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:21,010
♪ This place filled with dance and song
Has now lost all its charm

2165
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:23,820
♪ The place you lived
is now a graveyard

2166
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:26,270
♪ Tears have swept
our dreams away

2167
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,810
♪ We lost the one
who loved us so much

2168
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,110
♪ Darkness has now
engulfed our world

2169
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,750
♪ Remembering the love you showered....

2170
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,820
My Brother-
all of you must have known

2171
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:38,510
My...

2172
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:41,790
My Mom-
Mom too

2173
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:47,550
Lenin

2174
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,290
Before one could understand
what is happening...

2175
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,240
...so much happened

2176
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:10,620
If I was also responsible
in some way...

2177
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,480
...I will never
forgive myself

2178
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:17,740
This...

2179
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:20,340
This is not just
Lenin and Karikaalan's loss

2180
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,510
This is a warning for all of us!

2181
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:25,250
You question them
and they kill you?

2182
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,500
That is just fascism!

2183
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,810
Pure Mumbai Plan
must not be implemented

2184
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:33,860
Don't get too emotional Madam

2185
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,720
You don't get to decide
if this will happen or not

2186
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,410
Do only what you came here for

2187
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,300
Don't say unnecessary things

2188
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:43,300
What the hell are you talking?
You will lose your respect...

2189
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:44,730
Hey Perumalsamy...

2190
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,960
You are the one talking unnecessarily

2191
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:50,110
Go tell Hari Daada!
This project will not happen

2192
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,530
This place is ours

2193
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,890
Understand?
Get the hell out of here

2194
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,290
Anna...get out of here

2195
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,650
Hey! Get out

2196
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,710
'Praise be to Lord Ram
My brothers and sisters'

2197
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:03,590
'This is the voice of my heart'

2198
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,070
'Voice of Mumbai'

2199
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:08,910
'When Mumbai is hurt
even a bit...'

2200
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:11,100
'...the people responsible for it
lose their arm'

2201
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:13,300
'One doesn't know how'

2202
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:16,140
Digital Dharavi...

2203
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:19,330
...and Pure Mumbai!

2204
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:23,120
I salute these Govt. schemes

2205
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:26,620
The dirt that plagues these slums...

2206
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,880
The poverty...The darkness...
I want to change it all

2207
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:38,580
'March on Hari Daada
We stand by you!'

2208
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:42,060
Some people want to
defeat this plan

2209
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:46,930
You must root out
these anti-nationals

2210
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:51,840
My victory...

2211
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,510
...is your victory

2212
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:56,450
Your victory

2213
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:58,350
Is the Nation's victory!

2214
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:01,260
'Long live Maharashtra'

2215
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:13,980
'What happened?'

2216
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:16,490
'There is no water'

2217
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,510
It has been two days now

2218
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,550
Bawa, he has begun his game!
One tight slap!

2219
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:30,030
Sir, why are you locking it?

2220
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:31,400
Why are you locking?

2221
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,500
Hello, what are you doing?

2222
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:34,690
Wait! Wait!
What Govt. order do you have?

2223
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:35,490
There is a limit for everything

2224
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,370
One tight slap!

2225
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:42,940
We...

2226
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:45,240
...must do something

2227
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:48,280
Stop crying
I will get you crayons, ok?

2228
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:00,100
Thank You

2229
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,150
What are you doing, Grandpa?

2230
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,990
A weapon shouldn't get rusty

2231
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:08,050
It must remain sharp always

2232
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,980
This belongs to our ancestors

2233
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:14,460
Kaala is here!

2234
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,380
Let him in

2235
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,530
Come Kaala
Come!

2236
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:05,870
Come

2237
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:16,710
Come in

2238
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:27,960
Sit

2239
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:38,680
I wanted to kill you, actually

2240
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:41,150
Things went wrong

2241
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:42,640
The mistake wasn't mine, but God's!

2242
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:47,120
Your wife and son...

2243
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,650
I am sorry

2244
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,380
Please, forgive me

2245
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,270
Sit

2246
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:58,920
Sit down!

2247
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:09,700
(clock chimes)

2248
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:14,210
Mangal dear!
Get some water

2249
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:15,480
'Yes grandpa'

2250
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,940
- 'Careful
- Yes! Yes!'

2251
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:28,690
Hey...

2252
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:31,830
Take Grandpa's blessing
Should I tell you all this?

2253
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,040
No dear!

2254
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:37,130
Namaste is enough

2255
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:38,910
Namaste!

2256
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:40,720
Sweet girl!

2257
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:47,530
(whispers)
Grandpa!

2258
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,910
He seems to be a very nice person

2259
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:50,920
Don't kill him

2260
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,100
Go!

2261
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,180
She says...

2262
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:03,480
...you are a very nice person

2263
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,420
"Don't kill him!"

2264
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:10,380
Why will I kill you
if you don't get in my way

2265
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:13,510
You can't kill me

2266
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,090
Because...

2267
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:17,340
I am KAALA

2268
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:18,720
God of Death

2269
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:20,860
King "Yama"!

2270
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:22,660
Let's see

2271
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:24,800
Who the God of Death is!

2272
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:28,340
KAALA...

2273
01:58:28,990 --> 01:58:30,270
What sort of a name is this man?

2274
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:33,450
It disgusts me when I say it

2275
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,690
This black colour...

2276
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:40,800
...is ugly to look at

2277
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,260
Irritates my eyes

2278
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:47,810
White is pure

2279
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:49,990
Black is dirty

2280
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:52,790
Irritates you, is it?

2281
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,470
What an ugly thought

2282
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:58,430
The problem is in your perception

2283
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,840
Black...

2284
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:01,220
...is the colour of the Proletarait

2285
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:03,640
Come see in my chawls

2286
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:06,460
Dust scatters into a rainbow

2287
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:11,540
Hygiene, clean and pure

2288
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,510
These are your masks!

2289
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:15,490
What do you actually want?

2290
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:16,770
Land?

2291
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:20,620
It was in someone's name yesterday
and will change hands tomorrow

2292
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:23,040
When you die the six feet
will not be yours permanently

2293
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:25,470
Why are you so maniacal?

2294
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,440
Hey, tell me something new

2295
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:30,010
I know very well that
everything will be right here

2296
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,840
I can't take anything
up there with me

2297
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:34,470
Six feet land is all I get

2298
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,930
Nothing is permanent

2299
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:39,560
Lord Krishna has spoken in my ear
I am not unaware of all this

2300
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:42,960
Even then, that land...
for two days even...

2301
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:45,270
...should be in my name
and I will be happy

2302
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:46,460
Do you have any problem?

2303
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:47,480
Yes I do!

2304
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:50,230
To you, land is power

2305
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,070
To us it means life

2306
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,610
Get it?

2307
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:04,110
And power is my life

2308
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:08,370
Power is what I live for!

2309
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,770
If I throw stones
at every dog on the road

2310
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:17,910
I will never reach my destination

2311
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:24,670
I am using my power
for good things

2312
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:27,850
If it looks wrong to you,
it's your problem

2313
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:30,640
Anybody who opposes me...

2314
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:32,260
...will die

2315
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:38,660
"Arjuna" stood confused in the war-front
What the Lord did that day...

2316
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:40,900
...is what this Hari is doing today

2317
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:45,140
If stealing my land is your dharma
and your God's dharma...

2318
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:47,350
...I won't even spare your God!

2319
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:49,860
I made a small mistake

2320
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:54,130
Your wife and son
died because of me

2321
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:56,540
I feel guilty about it

2322
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:00,210
That's why I let you into my house

2323
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:03,200
What right do you have
to sit in front of me?

2324
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:05,270
You must know who you are!

2325
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:07,900
I don't like to remind you constantly

2326
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,500
Throw your pride aside

2327
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:12,350
Come apologise to me!

2328
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:15,340
Just two feet
Put an end to this

2329
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:15,800
Come

2330
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,480
The distance is the same

2331
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:23,150
Touch my feet

2332
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:26,850
I will decide if I want to
punish or forgive you

2333
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:32,080
Hold on!

2334
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:33,150
Hold on!

2335
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,590
I didn't come here to fight

2336
02:01:41,590 --> 02:01:45,990
You mustn't think
that my loss has shattered me

2337
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:49,410
You might have power

2338
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:54,640
I have thousands of people
as my support, family and companions

2339
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:59,080
You can't do anything in Dharavi
I came here to say exactly that, all alone!

2340
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:01,310
Hear me out Hari...

2341
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:04,790
My ancestors wish!

2342
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:06,590
Kaala's promise

2343
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,120
I won't spare you

2344
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:11,380
Stab me in the back, if you will

2345
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:20,190
Grandpa!

2346
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:21,490
Grandpa!

2347
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:23,990
Thanks for not killing him

2348
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,600
Nice person!

2349
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,000
'How dare you!'

2350
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:40,810
Go! Get in!

2351
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,760
Did you tell everyone
to come fetch water?

2352
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:54,740
One by one

2353
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:56,120
Patience!

2354
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:58,840
Patience!

2355
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:01,140
Perumalsamy, what are you doing?

2356
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:01,970
What is this nonsense?

2357
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:02,500
Why are you doing this?

2358
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,930
We don't need this
Who permitted you to issues tokens?

2359
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,910
'Who are you to evict us?'

2360
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:14,310
'We won't leave this place!
Get out of here'

2361
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:19,370
Ey! Who cut the electricity?

2362
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,920
Huh?

2363
02:03:20,110 --> 02:03:22,010
If you shut the electricity
we will get scared, is it?

2364
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,250
My body is a power hub!

2365
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:27,700
Hey you all
Come stand in queue!

2366
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:29,520
Take as much electricity
from my body

2367
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,840
I can supply power
to the whole of Dharavi!

2368
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,290
Grandpa, isn't your name Karikaaladu?

2369
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,410
That's right...

2370
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:38,740
Why Grandpa?

2371
02:03:38,770 --> 02:03:44,150
Why don't you have a modern name?
Such an old name Grandpa!

2372
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,730
Sweetie, it is a classic Telugu name

2373
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,950
Oh!!!

2374
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:50,680
Grandpa, why do they call you Kaala?

2375
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:54,400
He is dark skinned right
That's why he is called that!

2376
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:57,980
Hey! That also...

2377
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:00,560
Remember our village festival every year?

2378
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,380
Grandpa has been given
that God's name

2379
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:04,820
KAALA...

2380
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:07,680
...according to our people
is our saviour

2381
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:09,690
Grandpa, are you a gangster?

2382
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:12,590
No he is a rowdieeee!

2383
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:18,100
Earlier, when you questioned a bad guy
you were called a rowdy!

2384
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:21,340
Now it has all changed

2385
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:25,290
When someone is unjust to you
and you hit back...

2386
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:27,000
...they brand you as rowdies

2387
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:32,440
My father questioned oppression
They killed him

2388
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:36,250
I had a mad determination
to avenge his death

2389
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,650
The blind rage was taking me nowhere

2390
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:42,350
Swarna 'ma made me realise this

2391
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:45,570
You are scared of Swarna 'ma right?

2392
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:47,590
SOOO scared

2393
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,760
She is my angel, sweetheart

2394
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,440
My guardian angel!

2395
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,390
The people who killed
our Uncle and Grandma...

2396
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,710
...will kill us too
My friends were talking about it

2397
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,860
But I said...

2398
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,490
"We are Kaala's grandchildren
Nobody can harm us"

2399
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,120
Shut up! Don't talk
more than you should

2400
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:07,230
Why are you chiding them?

2401
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:08,270
They are just...

2402
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:09,420
Listen to me, my darlings

2403
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,400
You have to be compassionate, always

2404
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,860
Let all this fighting end with me

2405
02:05:15,130 --> 02:05:15,870
That...

2406
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,870
That's why I lost my Swarna...

2407
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:21,740
...my captain Siva

2408
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:25,390
Damn that drink!

2409
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:28,530
If I wasn't drunk that day...

2410
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:34,420
...I wouldn't have
lost them both

2411
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:38,200
If you keep mourning the dead
who will think of the living?

2412
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,330
Aims and ambitions!

2413
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:45,010
Siva didn't know any of that

2414
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,120
"I will die for my father"
he would say

2415
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,430
'That is all he knew'

2416
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:56,160
It is painful, yes!

2417
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:00,370
But we should lose nothing anymore

2418
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:03,120
Be brave!

2419
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:04,510
We will stand by you

2420
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:08,130
That's right
We mustn't lose anything

2421
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,850
We will support you
All of us

2422
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:12,660
Uncle, please get up

2423
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,160
Kids haven't eaten too

2424
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:15,580
Come let's have dinner

2425
02:06:15,690 --> 02:06:16,710
(glass breaks)

2426
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:18,590
Hey, who's that?

2427
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:20,740
Nothing. Don't worry

2428
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,900
They have set fire to our house!

2429
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:30,980
Get out fast!

2430
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:08,310
Kaala, my books are burnt

2431
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:10,810
How will I go to school now?

2432
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:16,530
Bawa!
Bawa!

2433
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:17,730
Come take a look

2434
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,490
Come

2435
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:20,680
My wife's photo...

2436
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:22,320
Bawa!

2437
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:25,680
This is all I had left

2438
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,970
This is gone too

2439
02:08:27,110 --> 02:08:28,300
Gone!

2440
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:28,960
'PA'

2441
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:30,120
Pa...

2442
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,530
15 earthmovers...

2443
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,680
200 policeforce...

2444
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,830
...mercenaries in addition

2445
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:37,230
They want to evict us all today
by burning or demolishing

2446
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,190
Mani Saet is issuing eviction tokens

2447
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,140
Zareena and Bharathi are fighting
Let's go!

2448
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:52,750
There is no need!

2449
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:55,810
You are the reason for all this
These houses are burning because of you

2450
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:57,580
You burnt these houses down!

2451
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,950
This is your responsibility

2452
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:00,590
You are fooling all these people

2453
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:03,000
Don't you dare raise a finger!
You are an Inspector

2454
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,950
You haven't filed the FIR

2455
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:08,980
'Why are you here?'

2456
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,550
Listen, good thing
we didn't lose more

2457
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:28,500
I am saying this as your MLA

2458
02:09:28,730 --> 02:09:30,530
Hari Daada is involving
the state machinery

2459
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,350
'Don't do anything unnecessarily'

2460
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:44,170
Kaala!

2461
02:09:45,450 --> 02:09:46,300
Stop it, Patil!

2462
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:47,030
Shoot!

2463
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:48,380
MOVE!

2464
02:09:48,570 --> 02:09:49,670
Shoot, let's see

2465
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,810
Shoot me if you can!

2466
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:54,410
Shoot me!

2467
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:55,270
Shoot me first!

2468
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,420
Do you have the guts to shoot?

2469
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:59,010
Will you get out alive, if you do?

2470
02:09:59,030 --> 02:10:01,070
Shoot me, shoot!

2471
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:02,300
(slogan) GET OUT OF HERE

2472
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:04,200
GET OUT OF HERE

2473
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:07,970
Hey...khaki uniform!

2474
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:10,840
What audacity to point a gun here!

2475
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:13,370
You are possessed by power

2476
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,880
Run away before we exorcise you

2477
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:15,990
I will return!

2478
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:17,630
I will!

2479
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:31,080
We are worried about
what will happen now

2480
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:33,550
He has burnt the houses today
It will be us tomorrow

2481
02:10:33,570 --> 02:10:34,230
He won't

2482
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:35,870
As long as we have
the strength to slog...

2483
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:37,110
...he would want us to obey him

2484
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:39,380
...and slave for him

2485
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:40,810
He wants us
as his slaves!

2486
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:42,590
He is threatening us
We must get scared

2487
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:43,990
That is his intention

2488
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:46,610
How long should we live in this fear?

2489
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:48,610
We should just die, instead

2490
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:49,490
Why should we die?

2491
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,320
Our lives are beyond death!

2492
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:52,510
We MUST live!

2493
02:10:52,570 --> 02:10:55,400
So...should we sign
the bond of slavery?

2494
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,070
We are slaves to nobody

2495
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:59,260
We created this city
We created Dharavi

2496
02:10:59,310 --> 02:11:00,760
We have a right over this

2497
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:02,330
This city doesn't exist without us

2498
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:03,600
We must make him understand this

2499
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:06,140
We should stop working for him

2500
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:08,190
(slogan) Yes we will!

2501
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:10,490
Our body is our only weapon

2502
02:11:11,010 --> 02:11:12,790
The whole world
must know about this

2503
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:13,670
Organise everyone!

2504
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:16,380
Hey! Where are you?
Come to Dharavi. NOW!

2505
02:11:16,570 --> 02:11:18,790
Kaala has called for a strike
Let's leave, come on

2506
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:21,140
They are asking everyone to come back

2507
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:22,580
Strike is it?
Kaala has announced?

2508
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:24,160
Come! Come!
Let's go!

2509
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:26,080
Tell me, dear
- Kaala is calling you

2510
02:11:26,110 --> 02:11:27,400
It's a strike, Pa

2511
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:29,420
Bro! Can you get down please?

2512
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:30,390
I can't take you

2513
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:31,910
Why?
- Strike

2514
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,750
This is a protest
to prove ourselves

2515
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:42,300
Where are you?

2516
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,490
Are you here?

2517
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,580
Wait! Who are you?
- Press, Sir

2518
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:48,350
We are seeking rights

2519
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,450
Not alms

2520
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:52,270
One demand!
Let's say it loud and proud!

2521
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:55,140
This land will belong to us
Let's say it loud!

2522
02:11:55,170 --> 02:11:56,420
Land is our birthright!

2523
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:57,950
Land is our birthright!

2524
02:11:57,970 --> 02:12:00,910
Land is our birthright!

2525
02:12:01,210 --> 02:12:02,420

02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,650
"...when you know ways
to kill Ravana"

2702
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:42,980
Translation

2703
02:22:44,050 --> 02:22:45,390
Matali asked Lord Ram...

2704
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:45,900
Daada!

2705
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:48,710
Look at all these offerings to God!

2706
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:51,240
There is only one thing missing

2707
02:22:52,170 --> 02:22:53,990
Go bring his head!

2708
02:22:57,020 --> 02:23:00,220
"The time has come
to destroy the demon kingdom"

2709
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:04,390
"The time has come
to destroy the demon kingdom"

2710
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:17,620
Nobody should come in
- Nobody will

2711
02:23:17,830 --> 02:23:21,070
(announcement on PA)
Agitators will be arrested!

2712
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:26,980
"Both sides had only one agenda
To take each other's lives"

2713
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,160
Hey, go that side

2714
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:37,080

'Attention People of Dharavi'

2716
02:23:40,310 --> 02:23:42,650
Don't...Don't come out
Shut the door!

2717

'Section 144 is applicable
with immediate effect'

2718

Go look!

2719
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:25,140
I saw 2 men near VOC tower

2720
02:24:25,370 --> 02:24:27,190
They are looking for us!

2721
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:29,100
We have to be careful

2722
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:30,200
We will!

2723
02:24:32,650 --> 02:24:34,050
Hari Daada's men are everywhere

2724
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:35,580
Where?
- Round the corner

2725
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:36,430
At the junction?

2726
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:38,880
- What is happening?
- Nothing Pa. Just talking

2727
02:24:45,230 --> 02:24:46,060
Go look in the chawls

2728
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:47,600
Look there

2729
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:51,530
"The war between them
was escalating rapidly"

2730
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:05,760
Hey! Who the hell are you?

2731
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:08,200
Don't follow the language?

2732
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:10,660
None of you should be here
Run away!

2733
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:11,400
GO!

2734
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:13,720
What are you glaring at?

2735
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:15,420
One tight slap and...

2736
02:25:24,410 --> 02:25:25,410
Come on!

2737
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:29,510
"The first time Rama...

2738
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:33,050
...chopped off the head
of Ravana with his arrow"

2739
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:39,380
"Just when that head
touched the ground..."

2740
02:25:39,630 --> 02:25:44,840
"...another head cropped up
on the shoulders of Ravana"

2741
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:53,920
"The second head of Ravana
was cut off"

2742
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:58,180
"Soon after that, another
rose into view again"

2743
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:02,400
"Ram kept chopping the heads"

2744
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:06,680
"But heads kept cropping up"

2745
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,330
'Kill him, now!'

2746
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:19,190

02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:24,760
'Karikaala!'

2749

You are their target

2750
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:28,890
One night!

2751
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,540
Just this night!

2752
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,840
We will win

2753
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:33,500
Let's wait!

2754
02:26:33,530 --> 02:26:34,810
So what if I die?

2755
02:26:35,220 --> 02:26:36,570
Aren't you all there!

2756
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:39,540
Each one of you here is Kaala!

2757
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:53,130
KARIKAALA!

"...entire forests and
the humankind"

"...and all creations trembled
in fear"

2763
02:28:08,530 --> 02:28:09,400

"HAIL"

2772
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:57,340
Kill him

2773
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:42,090
"The weapon pierced Ravana’s body
and fell to the ground"

2774
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:44,820
"Praise be to Lord Ram!"
Hail!

2775
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,870
Born to rule!

2776
02:30:46,980 --> 02:30:48,330
Born to rule!

2777
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:03,460
"The arrow that pierced
through Ravana’s heart"

2778
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:05,590
"That glorious arrow"

2779
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:07,970
"Got out of his body"

2780
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:11,210
"Carried Ravana’s sinful soul"

2781
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:14,370

the police led the riot...

2786
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:46,470
...and damaged public property

2787

2788
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:52,260
...Dharavi Inspector Pankaj Patil
has been arrested

2789
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:55,980

'But when we asked the
People of Dharavi about the same...'

2792
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,850
Idiot! What nonsense are you saying?

2793
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:08,640
Kaala was sitting
near the Buddha temple

2794
02:32:08,660 --> 02:32:09,490
Get lost!

2795
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:11,130

Buzz off!

2796
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:14,200

Didn't he rise from death?

2797
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:17,550
There isn't anybody
who can kill Kaala!

2798
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:19,670
This is Kaala's fort!

2799
