1
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes son. Those four boys,
those boys...

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
...whom you've sent to Nepal,
as soon as they reach Nepal...

3
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,500
...take their passports and settle
them in some Guest House. - Greetings.

4
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,900
Yes. Hey, I have been in this
business since twelve years.

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't teach your father
to dig graves. Yes okay.

6
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,900
Give me the chip.
Use the Mumbai one.

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,100
Sit.

8
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,000
What happened?

9
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
That Desai builder from Ghatkopar.
We had to take one million from him.

10
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
He asks for some more
time again and again.

11
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,600
This builders make more buildings...

12
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,600
...but take lesser
protection from us.

13
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,700
Make him understand. If he doesn't
pay at the right time...

14
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,700
...it won't take more time to
blast his slab for Pathan.

15
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,900
Yes, Pandey, what is it?

16
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,700
That Raeez Bhai. - Yes.
- The film producer.

17
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
He is asking for 2 millions.

18
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
His film's shooting is starting
from tomorrow.

19
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
This Raeez won't mend his ways.
Four of his movies have flopped...

20
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,100
...and yet, he is making
movies on credit.

21
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Why do these people make movies?

22
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,200
Do they make movies for
picnics with the heroine?

23
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,800
I can't understand this
passion of Plywood.

24
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,300
Not Plywood, Bhai.

25
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Bollywood.

26
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,000
Is it so? Yes? - Bollywood, Bhai.

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Do you know a lot? Do you
know English? - No, Bhai.

28
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,900
Do you want to go in the movie line?
- No, Bhai.

29
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,100
Yes?

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,300
Then what wood is it? - Plywood.

31
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,100
Say it a bit louder, it's raining.
- Plywood, Bhai.

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,500
Greetings, Bhai.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,100
What happened? - What else?

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
We've got information. Those
Raghu Shetty's men.

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
They will kill someone
from the Walia group.

36
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,100
If you say so, shall
I kill all of them?

37
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Shall I pump bullets in that wretch?

38
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,600
No. Cool it. Your brains
are just like your father.

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
You are very hot headed.

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,200
So, what should I do?

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,400
This Ravi Shetty is
a very big rascal.

42
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
We will have to wet his pants.

43
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,600
Call him up.

44
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Hail the name of Shiva!

45
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Bhai, Pathan had called up.

46
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
He told us that if we touch anyone...

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,500
...from the Walia group, everyone
will be in trouble.

48
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Fie on your life, Pathan!

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Why do you act smart staying
in Pathanwadi?

50
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
It's nothing.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
He has the support of the Minister
Manik Rao and Walia.

52
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,800
But their government will
not hold for many days.

53
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
These people forget that even we...

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
...have the support of
Gaikwad and Yadav.

55
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,100
So what if they are
in the opposition?

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,600
Hey, why are you so tensed?

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Don't stop our boys.
Tell them to go...

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,200
...and fire a couple of rounds
on the Walia group.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,100
Okay, sir.

60
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
As soon as the firing starts,
they will wet their pants...

61
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
...and the money will
start pouring in.

62
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Mr. Tripathi,
how are you? - I'm fine.

63
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,200
Where is Mr. Walia? - He must
be coming any time now.

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
Do you bet on horses too?

65
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,800
Tripathi! I don't bet on horses,
I bet on mares.

66
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,200
Greetings, sister-in-law.

67
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,800
Hey, she isn't a sister-in-law.
She's a bird.

68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
A bird for the mood.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mr. Walia.

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,900
Roshni, Mr. Oberoi will be
coming in the afternoon.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You pick him up from the airport
and go to the farmhouse directly.

72
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,500
I'll meet Mr. Merchant.

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
Sir. I'd brought some
items to...

74
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
...make up our VIP guest's mood.

75
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,500
Talk to Tiwari.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Congrats on the new textile
mill in Nashik.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,300
Mr. Merchant has called you
in the President's box.

78
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,300
I'll meet him after the race.

79
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Which horse have we bet on?

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,400
You are making a mistake, Walia.

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Today belongs to Black Sheep.

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Because, Pradhan has
bet money on it.

83
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Isn't it?
- We shall see, we shall see.

84
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Did you see that? Didn't
he taste defeat?

85
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Blackship is ahead.

86
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,200
Remember. Pradhan always
bets on the winning horse.

87
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
That's the difference between us.

88
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,100
You always bet on the winning horse.

89
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,100
And the horse on whom
I bet my money...

90
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
...he has to win under
any circumstances.

91
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Call Pathan and Manik Rao.

92
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,800
Don't move. - Hey, don't touch
me. - Yes, we will see you.

93
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come to the police station
first. - Easy, easy.

94
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
Are you coming or not? - Hey,
don't push. - Hey, move.

95
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
You shoot? You shoot at Mr. Walia?

96
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,700
I will break your limbs.

97
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
I put your father Raghu
Shetty behind bars...

98
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,900
...and still you haven't
seen your worth?

99
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
What did you tell him?

100
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
What were you told?

101
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,900
Walia is our man. Don't
even look at him.

102
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,400
And you asked extortion from him?

103
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,000
And you dared so much
as to finish his game?

104
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
How much do you talk, Bhai?

105
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,300
How much do you talk
to this bloody fellow?

106
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,800
How much do you talk?

107
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,800
Come on, Bhai, I'm hungry.
Let's eat something.

108
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,800
At least catch your breath, son.

109
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Shoot them.

110
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,200
Please take care of him.

111
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,100
Greetings. Greetings.
Please have a seat.

112
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
Mr. Manik Rao, in the
past eight months...

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,900
...Mr. Gautam Walia is the
fourth businessman...

114
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,900
...who has been attacked
by the underworld.

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you have to say
about this Law and Order?

116
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,400
See, these small incidents are
part and parcel of the daily life.

117
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,700
The police are doing their job.

118
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,200
And the law and order situation
is perfectly normal.

119
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
You're saying that the situation
is perfectly normal.

120
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,700
Whereas the increasing
extortion threats...

121
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,100
...on the business community
and the film industry...

122
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
...show that the underworld
has developed wings.

123
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
It's nothing like that.

124
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,200
Those who have got the
extortion threats...

125
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
...have been given government
security.

126
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,200
Now, the question about the
underworld activities.

127
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,900
All of you know very well.

128
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
That since the past
four years, ever...

129
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
...since I've taken the reins
of the Home Ministry...

130
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
...there has been a
decrease in these activities.

131
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,300
But... I promise that
in the coming days...

132
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,500
...the underworld will be
completely wiped off.

133
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,300
Greetings. - Greetings.

134
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
Thanks for putting Raghu
Shetty inside.

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,300
He dared to lay his hands on you,
Walia, he had to go inside.

136
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,100
Rest assured.

137
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,900
Yes, my new hotel is opening today.

138
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Please don't forget to
come in the evening.

139
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,400
Hey, how can I not come in your
party? Has it ever happened?

140
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,700
' Intoxication.'

141
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,000
'One Juliet has offered her heart.'

142
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,600
'She has killed the
whole atmosphere.'

143
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,300
' People die for my eyes.'

144
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,600
'They live everyday
just looking at me.'

145
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:37,700
' Hey the inebriation
has taken effect! '

146
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,100
'Some hopes are the
pretexts for living.'

147
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,600
'Only those have dreams
who have sleep.'

148
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,900
'There is a searing pain
in the heart everyday.'

149
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,200
'The hearts of lovers
are sold everyday.'

150
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
How are you, Seth Hirachand?
- It's just your blessings.

151
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
When did you come back from Surat?
- It's been two days.

152
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Please have a seat.

153
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Walia... - Yes, tell me. What is
our financial position? - Yes.

154
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
The 1500 million that you'd given
me has been transferred...

155
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,200
...to your Swiss bank account
through the unofficial channel.

156
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,100
And the 700 million
that Mr. Manik Rao...

157
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
...got as commission for the
government land, that...

158
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,700
...has been transferred to your
joint account in Singapore.

159
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
This is the position.
If there's any...

160
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
...other service for this humble
servant, please tell me.

161
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Hirachand Seth, we have
a great need of money.

162
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,200
Elections are round the corner
in the coming 6 months. And we...

163
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,200
...don't want to make a coalition
government like other states.

164
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,700
Please don't worry about that.
What are we sitting here for?

165
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
How much ever money has to sent...

166
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
...to whomsoever and wherever,
send it.

167
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,300
All that is all right. But
our Cheddha brothers...

168
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,900
...and our Judge Sahni, what
about their matter?

169
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,600
Yes, Judge, what is your problem?

170
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,500
What can I tell you?
I have a major problem.

171
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,300
On your bidding, I gave a decision...

172
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,400
...in Cheddha brother's
favor in that...

173
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,400
...slum land matter, near the
airport dispute.

174
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,200
I was to be given 2000
millions for the same matter.

175
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,900
They have sent just
300 millions till now.

176
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Till date, the market value
of that land is 4000 millions.

177
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Should I chase him around
to take my payment?

178
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,900
Or should I look after my own
work? I am not a beggar.

179
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,500
Even we are not beggars.
We are businessmen.

180
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,900
I had told you, there are some
problems. We need some time.

181
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,900
But nobody is ready
to understand here.

182
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't think that we will
be scared, Walia.

183
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
If you've a source
in the state cabinet...

184
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,100
...we can reach the national capital.

185
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,200
You dare to turn back
from your words?

186
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
You and your company
are indebted to me.

187
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
And you are forgetting it?

188
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Do you remember that
Vishal Builders' fellow?

189
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,700
People think that he was
killed in an accident.

190
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,400
But I had a major hand to
arrange for his mourning.

191
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,300
And as it is, you know that I have...

192
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,800
...a principle, I don't
forgive any mistake.

193
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,700
' Intoxication.'

194
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
What is your problem?

195
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,200
See, you don't have
a license and you...

196
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
...are talking on the mobile too.
- Yes, so what will you do?

197
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
You will have to pay a fine. - Do
you know who I am? - Who ever you are.

198
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm the son of this area's member
of the legislative assembly.

199
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm the son of Mr. Mahtre, undersatnd.
- Sir, you will have to pay the fine.

200
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Hey, I told you, don't
eat my brains.

201
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,600
Who are you? - Silent!

202
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Hey, you crook,
if a cat grows...

203
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,700
...her tails, she doesn't
become a lioness.

204
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,700
And from today, use this snap
in front of your chums.

205
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Not in front of SI Vikram
Singh, Crime Branch.

206
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,400
If you ever do such
an act again...

207
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,100
...this hand won't be worth
eating and washing. Understand.

208
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Come. I will take you
to your father now.

209
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,800
I will make you visit the
Mantralaya. Come on.

210
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,700
Yes, Goswami. I'm Khalid,
from the Crime Branch.

211
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes, greetings. Listen, friend.

212
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Please print some photo
in your paper. Yes.

213
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
No. What I'll do now.
The next time...

214
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,100
...that sir does an encounter,
I will take a dead body...

215
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
...put my foot over it,
and take a few snaps.

216
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
You will have to put
it in your paper.

217
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,600
Why not, I will give
you five thousand.

218
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,800
Yes, even I need some promotions.

219
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,300
I am hanging here as a head
constable since long.

220
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,400
Okay?

221
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,900
Farewell.

222
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,200
What is the complaint?

223
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,400
Sir, my wife has run away, sir.

224
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,100
What are you saying? What
did you do? Tell me too.

225
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Hey, this is a crime branch, such...

226
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
...complaints aren't registered here.

227
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,200
The banyan tree on the curve
of the road ahead.

228
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,400
There is the sixteen
number beat there.

229
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
Go and register it with Shinde.

230
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Yes. He's an expert
in catching wives.

231
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,200
His own wife had run away
five times, isn't it?

232
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
Is it so? - Yes, go... go.
- And listen.

233
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,300
Tell him properly, whether your
wife is fair or dark complexioned...

234
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,100
...was she fat or slim,
male or female.

235
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Go... go you fool, go.

236
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,700
Hey, Namdeo? - Yes, Khalid?

237
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,000
Are your pockets empty? - Why?

238
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,300
I've to spit. - You're
joking, Khalid.

239
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Don't you know that it had come
in the papers yesterday?

240
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,800
What? - Eating betel leaves
leads to mouth cancer.

241
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,100
What are you saying? Oh God!
I'll stop from tomorrow.

242
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
So what? Will you stop
eating betel leaves?

243
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,600
No, I will stop reading
the newspaper.

244
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,700
Leave this vice, and start
drinking milk from tomorrow.

245
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Hey, do you know? Yesterday a man...

246
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
...died in my locality while drinking
milk. - Hey, how did he die?

247
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,400
He was drinking milk, and
the buffalo sat on him.

248
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
You too, Khalid!

249
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,200
I will tell you, sir, right now.

250
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,500
Kill that wretch!

251
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
Come. Come.

252
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,700
Hey run! Hey run!
Move away! Quickly!

253
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,000
Hey! Hey I will kill her! - Help me. -
I'm telling you!

254
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,300
You are acting smart? You
like becoming a Bhai?

255
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,900
I will kill her, sir. I will kill
her. Yes, I will kill her.

256
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,900
If you kill her, you will
save yourself?

257
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,900
It seems that you are
new in this business.

258
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,100
What is your name?
- What did you say?

259
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Your name is not in the list. Yes?

260
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,300
Have you joined recently?
- Yes. I have joined recently.

261
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
If you've joined the
company recently...

262
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,700
...leave the company quickly.
C'mon go.

263
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,300
Didn't I tell you to leave her?
Or else I'll kill you, wretch.

264
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,200
Leave her.

265
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,300
Give the revolver and surrender
yourself. Quickly.

266
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,500
Rascal, you will be
saved now. C'mon go.

267
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,500
You think that Appa is a fool?

268
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Appa has come from Mangalore.

269
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,400
Don't think that I have
come from Alibagh, Pandu.

270
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,700
It seems that the
municipality dogs...

271
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,000
...are dying lesser than
my men in this city.

272
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,900
You know Pathan's actions,
don't you?

273
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,600
Explain it to the police. - You
don't worry. I will take care.

274
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,600
I will talk to you later.

275
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,900
Till when will this police
bloodshed continue?

276
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Sir, till when will this
police whim work?

277
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
You will have to answer
the common people.

278
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
See, please wait. Please wait.

279
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Please have a seat.

280
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
When will you understand
your responsibility?

281
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,500
The human rights are terming these
daylight encounters done by...

282
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
...the police as the tyranny
of the police force.

283
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,200
If you can't mend the police image,
at least don't degenerate it.

284
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,800
Sir, they were Pathan's shooters.
If I would have left them...

285
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
I know about you.

286
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,000
Nobody is nabbed alive by your hands.

287
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,600
Do you want to be a media star
by doing these encounters?

288
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
But the people whom I killed, had...

289
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
...extortion and murder
cases against them.

290
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,600
And I'm being questioned...

291
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,200
You're his senior in
the crime branch.

292
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
You should make him understand.

293
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Please forgive him. He is young,
he is hot tempered.

294
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,700
If he doesn't kill at this age,
and doesn't fight...

295
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,700
...then what is the
use of this youth?

296
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,900
Please have mercy and
stop this philosophy.

297
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
So then, how was your day?

298
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,900
Just like everyday.

299
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Did something else happen today?

300
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,900
Your mood doesn't seem good.

301
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,000
Should I tell you something?

302
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Whenever you go to work
in the morning...

303
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
...I am tense all through the day.

304
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,000
My sight is always on the doorway.

305
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I think about God in my heart.

306
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,500
The importance that you give
to your work and your duty...

307
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,300
...please give some part
of it for us too.

308
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,600
After all, who else...

309
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,700
...who else do we have
other than you?

310
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,400
I understand.

311
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,500
I understand.

312
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,400
But what can I do? This work...

313
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,900
They tie my hands behind my back.

314
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
And then they tell me
to catch the culprits.

315
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
If one senior officer comes...

316
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
...who will untie my hands,
I will do away...

317
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
...with this concept of
muscle power from this city.

318
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,100
Are you Ramji Bhai's man? - Yes.

319
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,800
Hey? Have you come to deal?

320
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,900
Are you Ramji Bhai's new man?
- Yes.

321
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,500
Hey, are you scared of the police
that you're hiding your face?

322
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,200
Tell your Ramji Bhai.

323
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,100
Now, I have got the plates
of making 1000 rupee notes...

324
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,100
...not five hundred, understood?

325
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,100
Take this material worth 50
millions and go away from here.

326
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,900
And tell Ramji Bhai that I should
get my commission by evening.

327
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Manjeet Bhai! - What is it?

328
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,700
This crime branch man was watching
us. See, we found this on him.

329
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Hey, bring him here.

330
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
Come, you are a
police man, isn't it?

331
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I will show this bloody fellow!

332
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,500
Hey, were you standing
outside and keeping an eye on us?

333
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Who else is with you?

334
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,300
You rascal! You don't know who I
am! I'm everyone's father! Father!

335
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,700
Tell me who is with you?

336
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,700
Tell me or else I will put the
rest of the five inside you.

337
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What are you
staring at? Blow him up!

338
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,600
You have a passion to
become a father, isn't it?

339
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Recognize your father now.

340
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,000
You have broken the
spine of the gang itself.

341
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,400
Sir, only a couple of
people are left.

342
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,800
After catching them, the
gang which makes fake notes...

343
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,900
Don't worry about that.

344
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,800
The new officer, who is coming,
will look after all that.

345
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,900
New officer? Why sir?

346
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,000
You have been promoted
because of your good work.

347
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,700
You have been transferred
to the Mumbai Crime Branch.

348
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Sir, should I consider it to be
a promotion or a kick off order?

349
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,700
What has happened to you, Patnaik?

350
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,700
Do you know how much money has
to be paid for this posting?

351
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,300
That money of yours is saved.

352
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,300
And then the income
above that is different.

353
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:09,200
Tell me something. How much did
you get to move me out from here?

354
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,900
Take this. These are your
transfer orders. - Okay, sir.

355
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,200
If this is the result of working
honestly, then it's all right.

356
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,300
Here is the file.

357
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
If I come to Mumbai from Pune
for even a few days...

358
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,300
...you can't even take
care of such a small task?

359
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,900
You do know that the
show is in a couple of days...

360
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
...and it has been
delayed as it is.

361
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,200
Now listen. Arrange the clothes
and coordinate the models too.

362
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
I will arrange
everything else once I come back.

363
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,300
Kiran, actually. - Enough.

364
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,200
I came to Pune especially from
Mumbai to spend some time with you.

365
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,500
And we had talked
about this a week ago.

366
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,000
At that time, sir said,' Come,
I am relatively free.'

367
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Om, do you know how many fashion
shows of mine have I adjusted?

368
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,300
And you've changed the time three
times over the phone since morning.

369
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,100
Why are you silent now?
- I've been transferred.

370
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,500
Which city will I
have to come to now?

371
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,500
Mumbai. - There, now
even Mumbai will...

372
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,600
You use the blade on my man?

373
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,800
Where is Mangesh? - I
don't know. - Where is Mangesh?

374
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Didn't I tell you that I don't know?

375
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,100
Hey, sir, don't touch me.

376
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,900
Even I know the law.

377
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,200
What did you say sir?

378
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,900
Nothing. I'm scared. I'm really
scared. Another Bhai knows the law.

379
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,900
Sir, why don't you too walk according
to the law? - Should I? - Yes.

380
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,000
Get up! Get up, you bloody!

381
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hey? - Yes? - This isn't a
service revolver, is it?

382
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,800
No. But it gives
excellent service sir.

383
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,600
Use one bullet and two die.
And the third dies out of fright.

384
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
So Khalid, what did you see?

385
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Sir I saw... When you were
asking him questions...

386
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,600
...he was acting impudently. - Then?

387
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
Then you told him,
'Brother Pawle please give me...

388
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
...some respect,
I'm human too.' - Then?

389
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,700
Then he said that you aren't human,
you are a police man. - Then?

390
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,700
Then you gave him a final warning and
he moved ahead with a gun. - Then?

391
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,100
Then you shot in
self defense and Pawle was...

392
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
...killed because of his own mistake.

393
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Just like everyone else was killed.

394
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,100
All this happened legally, isn't
it? - Totally sir, undoubtedly.

395
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,800
Then arrange to send his
dead body for the post mortem.

396
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,900
Hey, do you piss
before you speak every time?

397
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,500
This is a police station. Not your
in-law's place.

398
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,600
Who will clean it, if you
piss around here and there?

399
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Tell me.

400
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,500
You'll get Mangesh in
the Lakswadeep Bar, sir.

401
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Khaild? - Yes? - Who's there on
the night patrol? - Mr. Vikram.

402
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,000
Sir, Mr. Vikram has
caught Mangesh Ustra.

403
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,800
Have you come, Appa?
Go, go and have some fun.

404
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Bhai! Bhai!

405
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,500
You shout? You shout? You use blades?
You use a blade on a police man?

406
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
You are a Bhai? Are you a Bhai?

407
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,500
There is only one Bhai in Bombay.
The police man, understood?

408
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,900
The biggest Bhai! The
biggest Bhai! Understood!

409
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,900
You use a blade on a police man?
- This is social cleansing.

410
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
The khaki washing place.
- You hit Appa's man?

411
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,300
You hit Appa's man?
Hit him again!

412
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,300
Hit him again and see!
Use the blade again and see, rascal!

413
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,600
I had learnt it a long time ago
that wherever I join for duty...

414
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
...I should join it a day earlier.

415
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
The reality comes out.

416
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,700
What did you say your name was?

417
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,200
Tell him your name. - I'm
asking you. What is your name?

418
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,700
Khalid. - What? - Khalid.
- Spit the betel outside.

419
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,300
Go!

420
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,400
It's done. I spit it inside.

421
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,700
See, with taking the charge
here I will make you understand...

422
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,700
...that there are some responsibilities
attached to this uniform.

423
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,000
These people may be criminals,
but they are human.

424
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Even they have some rights.

425
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,300
Did you remember some joke? Tell me.

426
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,800
It's a joke sir. Whom you call
humans, are Pathan's shooters.

427
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
For them, killing someone
is like having their food.

428
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,900
These bloody ones should
have their limbs cut off...

429
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,900
...and made to sit on the streets.

430
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:21,900
And you? Instead of explaining these
people, you were eating peanuts?

431
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
What is the meaning of
hitting these small fries?

432
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,500
If you've such a passion to show your
strength, catch their godfathers.

433
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,700
See, you don't know these people.

434
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,200
Their contacts are
much higher than the law.

435
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,600
It seems that both of us have
studied different books of law.

436
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,200
All I understand is that the
law has the highest contacts.

437
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,700
Listen... what is their name?
The file, bring it to me.

438
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,500
What is it called in
your Mumbai tongue? - Bhais.

439
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,200
Go and bring their accounts to me.

440
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,600
He will be a very big trouble, sir.

441
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,300
He tells me to spit the betel out.

442
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,300
It is betel worth fifteen rupees,
and that too for free.

443
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,300
Is it something to spit out?

444
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,800
He is an immature clay pot. Let's see
till how many rains can he survive?

445
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,500
You are eating betel again? Come,
we will have some tea.

446
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,700
Just a minute.

447
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,900
What is the matter?

448
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,400
My wife has gone to
her mother's house.

449
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,400
Arrange for a maiden
or two. Make my mood!

450
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,100
Your wife goes to her mother's
house, and you give me the trouble.

451
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,800
What can I do? I can't tolerate it.
- Okay, get aside, I'll arrange.

452
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Go... go.

453
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,900
But you can't be wrong. - Mr.
Manik Rao! How are you?

454
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,500
Walia, your parties are
always very interesting.

455
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,000
Your parties and no interest,
impossible.

456
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Today is a good chance
to speak to Pradhan.

457
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,000
It will be better if
we speak today itself.

458
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Manik Rao wishes to
speak to you about something.

459
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,900
Please don't worry.

460
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,300
I will just...

461
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,400
Mr. Manik Rao. How is
your government working?

462
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Our government will be going on.

463
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,300
If you come with us too,
it will be more glorious.

464
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,900
So, what was I speaking about? Yes!

465
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,900
The petrochemical plant near Hazira
in Gujarat which is worth...

466
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:12,000
...6000 crores I want 25 percent of
its shares in my son's name.

467
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,100
That means partnership.

468
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,100
You are very intelligent.

469
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,800
Our relation will be
strengthened in this way.

470
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,600
We can do small and big
deals together in future,

471
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,600
See. Mr. Manik Rao, I
respect you. But you do know...

472
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,100
...that my support and
loyalty is with the opposition.

473
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
That means, it is
with Yadav and Gaikwad.

474
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,300
They have been sitting
in the opposition for...

475
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,600
...the past four years.
What is their worth?

476
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,600
We will form the
government the next time too.

477
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,600
You will benefit, if you help us.

478
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,400
Please excuse me, I am a
businessman, not a political leader.

479
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,900
You may have the habit of changing
friends and parties, I don't.

480
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,700
What did he say? -
He didn't accept it.

481
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Please don't worry.
I will arrange it.

482
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,500
Walia, it's better if
you explain it to him.

483
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,500
Who doesn't know him?

484
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,100
Hey, Khalid, it's my number.

485
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,100
Hey, you are my friend. Whether I
go or I do, it's one and the same.

486
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,100
No. If you are my friend, come home.

487
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,700
Have tea and snacks,
no friendship here.

488
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,300
See. You are
obstructing the path of the Law.

489
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,800
I will put you
inside for putting a spanner...

490
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,300
...in the work of the law!
I won't leave you!

491
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,000
Khalid Bhai, Peter
will go inside now, come.

492
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,000
Is your name written inside there? -
And if it isn't, I will write it down.

493
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,000
If you're in the police force,
even I am the...

494
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,300
...personal driver for
the High Court judge.

495
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
I will write the
name of my whole family!

496
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,400
Write it down. Don't make
noise here, go inside. Go!

497
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,100
He's speaking. Hey, come on!

498
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,000
Khalid Bhai, I have a tension.

499
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,300
Hey, you were inside since half an
hour and you still had a tension?

500
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,300
Inside there, against my wife's name.
My residence telephone number has...

501
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,400
That wretch writes Rs 50
only against my wife's name!

502
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,100
What are you saying?
Only fifty rupees?

503
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,100
This is too less.
You don't worry.

504
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,100
Take some coal and
add a zero to the fifty.

505
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,100
It will be five hundred,
the matter is closed.

506
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,100
What five hundred?
Khalid, my wife's...?

507
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Hey, sorry. This is too bad. Sorry.

508
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,300
Let this writer
come in my hands...

509
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
...I will write off his
death certificate, you'll see.

510
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,500
I know who has written it.

511
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,700
Is it so? - Yes. -
Who is it? - Peter.

512
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,900
No... not Peter. - What no? What no?

513
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,200
He will write it today too.

514
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,500
You don't believe? I'll differentiate
between the box & the water right away.

515
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Hey, Peter, please don't write it.

516
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,900
I will write it. I will write it a
thousand times, am I scared of you?

517
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,400
Did you see that?
Did you see that wretch?

518
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,700
I made him understand a lot outside.

519
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,300
Please don't write like
this about Tawde's wife.

520
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,300
At least don't write 50 rupees.

521
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,300
He said, I will
write 5 rupees today.

522
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,400
How can someone afford 5
rupees in such expensive times?

523
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,500
He's gone Khalid. I swear, he's gone
today. You don't come between us.

524
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,400
For my wife's sake. Don't come
between us. He's gone today.

525
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,800
I'm a police man. You don't worry.

526
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
I always come in the
very end. You blow him up!

527
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Peter, come out. Come out, Peter.
- Hey who is it? Let me wash up!

528
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,500
What do you write?
What do you write?

529
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,600
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me take the box at least.

530
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,700
Hey, I have still to write. -
Hit him! Writes a lesser cost!

531
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Hey Champak, get the newspaper.

532
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
Will you read all the news yourself?

533
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,600
And bring me some tea. Strong tea!

534
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,600
Here, it has come.
The welfare fund installment.

535
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,600
What welfare fund? If you take it,
you will spend your conscience...

536
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,700
...if you don't take it, how will
you give money to your informer?

537
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,200
From our salary?

538
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Take this Khalid. Distribute
this amongst everybody like always.

539
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,200
That is all right. But who
will give it to the one above us?

540
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,200
You. - Me? Do you want to kill me?

541
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,000
I have a wife and kids. You
give it to him. It will look good.

542
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,800
I don't like his face.
You go and give it to him.

543
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,100
Oh please no, dad. He
doesn't like my face.

544
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,000
Hey, do this. Please
tell it to Mr. Vikram.

545
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,300
Hey, one doesn't throw
stones at a sleeping tiger.

546
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,900
If he claws you, he
will make you bald.

547
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And the beating that you get after
being stripped is a different thing.

548
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,900
Hey, leave this poetry. He
is sitting in the Irani Hotel.

549
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Go and give it to him.
Don't be scared, go.

550
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,900
The constable has
a lighter blood...

551
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,900
...didn't you make me
the sacrificial goat?

552
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay come on, Farewell.

553
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,300
Sir... Greetings.

554
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,500
This... - What is this?

555
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,400
Lakshmi. - Lakshmi?

556
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,900
The paper Lakshmi. - A bribe?

557
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,400
It's not a bribe. It's
the public welfare fund.

558
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,900
It's for us. It's like every time.

559
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,300
Do you know, Khalid?

560
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
I can suspend you because
of this action of yours?

561
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,800
I... - Pick this up.

562
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,400
Why are you scolding
this poor man, sir?

563
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,600
Even I think this to be an informer
welfare fund. To maintain an informer.

564
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
You do know what the
salary of a constable is...

565
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,100
...five thousand three hundred
and twenty eight rupees.

566
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,800
No sir, it's four
pennies less in that.

567
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,200
It's twenty seven rupees
and ninety six paise.

568
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,500
The municipality sweeper earns
more than us, who sweeps the streets.

569
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,800
They have to run their
homes in this money.

570
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,500
The rent for the house,
the studies of the children...

571
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,500
...the daughter's marriage
and father's medicine.

572
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,500
All of it has to be done in this.

573
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,600
How will these people survive?
And you know very well...

574
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,600
...how many people in
our police force...

575
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,700
...are getting tired of
life and committing suicide.

576
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,300
They are weak. A
policeman doesn't work for money.

577
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,000
It is done for the respect
and dignity attached to it.

578
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,600
It's done for the
glory of the department.

579
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,700
If you've such a passion for earning
money, go on the streets and sweep it.

580
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,200
He is a strange man.

581
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,900
First of all, he doesn't let us
litter, and then he tells us to sweep.

582
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,000
The King Harishchandra
left and kept his sibling here.

583
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,000
We will have to rear him.

584
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,400
Hey, bring a bun and butter.
- Sorry. - Come.

585
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
What do they think I am?

586
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,200
A common police officer offers
his senior a part of his bribe...

587
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,500
...as if he is offering
him a part of his duty.

588
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
What do these people think?

589
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,300
Job, uniform, even
every man has been sold off.

590
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,100
I feel that these people,
I should... - Om.

591
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,000
Come without any tension
about your work sometimes.

592
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,500
At least sometimes I should feel that
your duty doesn't stand between us.

593
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:20,300
' I have a plaint against you.'

594
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
' It has never been such, nor do
I have and not will I ever have.'

595
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,800
' Love with someone else.'

596
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,600
' Neither did I ever have... '

597
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,600
...' nor do I have, and
nor will I ever have.'

598
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,500
'These days and these
months will get spent.'

599
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,900
'These moments and this
time will be scattered.'

600
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:52,900
' But the love will never
decrease from this heart.'

601
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,300
'We will never be in the
weather of separation.'

602
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,400
'This love with someone else... '

603
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:26,300
' Neither did I have, nor do I
have and nor will I ever have.'

604
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,600
Sir, this area
belongs to Yusuf Bhai.

605
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,000
At one time, he used to sell tickets
for Sholay in black at Minerva theatre.

606
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,600
He earned a lot, he started
showing his muscle power...

607
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,800
...and is the biggest
Bhai in Pathanwadi.

608
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,000
This area belongs to Raghu Bhai,
Raghu Shetty, Shetty company.

609
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
There are many bars which
serve liquor in the quarter system.

610
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
He has been
arrested twice under TADA.

611
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,700
He has four full murder cases and
two half murder cases against him.

612
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,500
And this... this area
belongs to Sameer Bhai.

613
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,600
He used to smuggle
watches in Crawford market.

614
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,900
He made money in
powder later, in drugs.

615
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,900
He has been arrested
in the '93 bomb blast.

616
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,500
The case is still going on.

617
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,900
The rest of the area, this one,
which Bhai does this belong to?

618
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,500
Sir, this isn't the property of
any Bhai, it's a sister's area.

619
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,600
Meeraben Joshi. She is a
very dangerous woman, sir.

620
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,600
She has even slapped a
policeman a couple of times.

621
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,800
If these areas belongs to Bhais
and sisters, which is our area?

622
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,000
This is our area sir.
This is our area.

623
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,000
Where the two of us
are standing right now.

624
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
Comfortably and safely.

625
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,000
No tension or any pollution.

626
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,100
Totally safe and sound.

627
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,800
Have you taken up this
job to stay safe and sound.

628
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,800
If you sit just like this
in the crime branch there...

629
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,100
...are four bhais today, tomorrow
there can be eight bhais too.

630
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,800
Not eight, sir. Eighty.

631
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,800
And then eight hundred.

632
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,100
If our hands are tied with this same
speed and if we can't do anything.

633
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,200
If you want to know the answers to
this question, go & ask your superior.

634
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,400
Go and ask your colleagues. Try to
take a look inside this department.

635
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,200
And try to understand this system.

636
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,600
You will get your answer, sir.

637
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,500
My duty time is done.
I will take your leave.

638
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,300
Jai Hind!

639
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,500
Does he work according to the watch?

640
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,000
And whatever he does,
he only eats peanuts.

641
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,500
Was he born like this?

642
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,700
He was the hero of our crime
branch once upon a time, sir.

643
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,500
He used to work for
twenty four hours.

644
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,500
If his vehicle would pass
any road of the section...

645
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,500
...even the strongest
would develop cold feet.

646
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,600
I mean to say,
they would get scared.

647
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,800
He used to do duty with
all his heart and soul.

648
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
But what did he get in the end?

649
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,300
Even his wife left him.

650
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,600
He had decided to change the system.

651
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
The system changed him.

652
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Our system is something like this.

653
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,300
And on top of that,
Walia, Pathan and Manik Rao.

654
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,300
The three of them
have come together and...

655
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,800
I will take your leave sir.

656
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:56,700
Yes, Om. See, that Appa is
going on an encounter once again.

657
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,700
Count them, sir. All
four of them are in there.

658
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,300
There isn't even one less.

659
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,700
Khalid, they are humans understood?
Show some humanity towards them.

660
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,100
Ask them what they want
with the quarter in the night.

661
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,100
Indian, Chinese or that...

662
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,900
Sir, these are the
worms of the drains.

663
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,400
They kill men for
five thousand rupees.

664
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,400
Killing them isn't a crime.

665
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,000
It's pure social service.
Social service!

666
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,400
Naik, this service revolver
which you've put in your pants...

667
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,900
...it isn't used to play games that
you will shoot wherever you want.

668
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Sir, this isn't some small game.

669
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,700
These people have full
support of people like Walia.

670
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,400
With the help of these people,
he works his underworld network.

671
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,500
Tomorrow, he will send
lawyers and get them released.

672
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,400
They will go out and
murder four civilians.

673
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,300
Who will be responsible
for their deaths, sir?

674
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,300
If you have such a
passion for encounters...

675
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,300
...leave this job and
go and join those Bhais.

676
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
You want job satisfaction, isn't it?

677
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,600
Go, go and shoot there.

678
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,700
Is he a police officer
or a health minister?

679
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,400
I mean he tells me not to
eat betels, he tells you...

680
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
...not to eat peanuts, he
tells him not to phone a friend...

681
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
He tells him to become a Bhai.

682
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,700
It seems that I will have to
look for another job, I swear.

683
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,200
Yes, Khalid, if this
is the situation...

684
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,300
...after some days there
will be only one police...

685
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,500
. officer in the whole
police department, Hari Om!

686
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
Hari Om Tatsat!

687
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Say Patnaik. - Yes!

688
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,000
Come, let's have a drink.
- At day time...

689
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,500
Break the law to save the law.
It looks as a bad joke.

690
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,600
When a human receives power
then he becomes a beast.

691
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Have you taken the responsibility
to fight against...

692
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,400
...the system? There are
others who do their duty.

693
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,400
Yes, Kiran. The rest of
them just do their duty.

694
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,500
Sir! - Greetings Sir!

695
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Finished! I have received
information that 4 shooters...

696
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:54,100
...of Pathan are hiding at
the timber mart in Mahim.

697
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Have you ever seen yourself in
the mirror? - Did you say something?

698
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
He said that why to catch them...

699
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,400
...we'll just shoot them down.
Right? - I spoke in Hindi.

700
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,000
And you can understand the language.

701
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,700
Come, Mr. Khalid. Let's
obey sir's orders.

702
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,900
Let's raid them.

703
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,800
Catch them all.

704
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
Catch them. Take them away.

705
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,400
Come on, sir is asking to
catch them. Come on, go.

706
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,500
You all go there. You come here.

707
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,100
Bring him!

708
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,800
Quickly! Hit him! Take him away.

709
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,900
No sir! No!

710
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,100
Sir he... It's me. Sir, they are all
poor workers. It's none of them.

711
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,400
Greetings, Patnaik sir. I'm Pathan.

712
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,600
Congratulations for your new post.

713
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,200
Heartiest congratulations.

714
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,700
I have heard a lot about you.

715
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,200
Sir, you will get nothing by
troubling these poor people.

716
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,700
They are all workers here. And
nothing is illegal here.

717
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,500
I don't know why the Press
are calling us Bhais (Don).

718
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,100
I respect you very much.
You can ask Vikram sir...

719
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,400
...ask Appa. Ask your department.

720
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,300
I always donate for good deeds.
I donate at the Ganpati festival.

721
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,800
Every Friday I feed the poor.

722
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:38,500
All kinds of donations. What
you call... social service.

723
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,400
And that's why many
people respect us.

724
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Even I have connections
to the top level.

725
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,400
If you are in trouble
sometime then tell us...

726
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,100
...l'll do whatever I can.

727
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,900
Can I tell you something, Pathan?

728
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,300
Our weakness is greatly responsible
for your strength.

729
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,900
But not all men are alike.

730
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,600
Can you see this stick?

731
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,400
The government doesn't give
this to play with it.

732
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,600
The day I get furious I'll
shove it your rear...

733
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,000
...and remove it from the top.
Both your eyes will pop out.

734
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,500
And you always mention that
you know these politicians...

735
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,700
...you know these businessmen.

736
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,200
I'll strip and thrash them and
drag them afterwards.

737
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,900
Their big talks will get over.

738
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:51,900
And yes... I'll definitely take your
procession in Pathanwadi.

739
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,800
Remember this.

740
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,800
Brother, he talks too much.

741
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,800
The soda is only worth
when it is in its bottle.

742
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
When the cork is removed
all the froth is out...

743
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,900
...and all that remains is...
- Water! - Water!

744
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,500
Send money to Kelkar,
he had tipped us.

745
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,600
I'm having a headache, get me
something to drink. - Yes!

746
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,600
Whatever you say, Vikram sir,
our new sir sure has the guts.

747
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,900
He is strong as iron. - Yes,
he's like iron.

748
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,900
Let him get the air of the sea. It
won't take time to rust the iron.

749
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,400
But, I pray that iron
should never rust.

750
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,000
Vikram sir! - Sir, you are here?

751
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,500
Why, they let you enter only
by your class? - No sir!

752
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,300
Sit down.

753
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:58,600
Today, seeing your confidence,
I remembered...

754
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,400
...a lot of things. I remembered
that even I was like you.

755
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,100
But you have already seen...

756
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,100
...the results of performing
one's duties honestly.

757
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,200
You have your whole
career ahead of you.

758
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
My journey is almost over.

759
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,700
I hope that you will keep your
confidence till your last breath.

760
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,300
Or else this system
is very merciless.

761
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,300
If you try to tease it
then this system can...

762
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,800
...even break the greatest
of the people.

763
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,400
Even I had opened the blindfold
from the eyes of the law.

764
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,000
And showed them... Iook...

765
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,000
...what is happening underneath
your noses.

766
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,900
But nothing happened. And
I created my own system.

767
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,200
They will commit a mistake while
doing illegal work.

768
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,800
And to be safe from us they have
to be lucky all the time.

769
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,700
Pradhan, think once more.

770
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
Mr. Manek Rao will be disappointed.

771
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,600
I don't want you to
have any problem.

772
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,000
You have threatened me
so sweetly, Mr. Walia.

773
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,300
Tell Manek Rao that nothing
is going to happen.

774
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,700
And yes, it would be better
if you don't waste yours...

775
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,800
...and my time by talking
on this topic again.

776
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,000
He won't agree.

777
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,700
My information is perfect,
Mr. Manek Rao.

778
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,900
Recently, Pradhan has
paid this 120 crores...

779
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,700
...to Yadav and Gaikwad. And
it's just the beginning.

780
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,000
And the matter is not about
his money power...

781
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,900
...it's the support behind him.
- You are right, Mr. Hirachand.

782
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,300
Or else at the time of the
elections we will be kept thinking...

783
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,200
...that we'll buy their MLA's.
And we'll find out...

784
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,300
...that they have already bought
our MLA's. - Yes!

785
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,400
There is no honesty in politics.

786
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,900
That's why it's very important
for Pradhan to be...

787
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,100
...with you, Mr. Rao. - Right! -
I don't know why these people...

788
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,300
...don't understand a straight
point. We always have...

789
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,900
...to use crooked ways to get
the work done straight.

790
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,900
It seems that I have to give
this job to Yusuf Pathan.

791
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,100
There is only one thing
to understand, Pathan.

792
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,100
I support Yadav and Gaikwad.
I can't understand...

793
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,600
...that why can't Manek
Rao understand this.

794
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,700
Hey, Mr. Pradhan... today
Yadav and Gaikwad...

795
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,800
...need you. You don't need them.

796
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,700
Now, how can you talk business
to the opposition...

797
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,900
...the way you talk about
the government.

798
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,400
I don't want to learn about
business from a person who...

799
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,300
...sell movie tickets for black.

800
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
Hey, why are you eating our brains?

801
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,400
Bhai is trying to
tell you something...

802
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,400
...and you can't get it
in your brains or what?

803
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,500
Silence! - Look, Bhai,
what is he talking?

804
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,500
This is not a road-side
shop by your street.

805
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,400
This is Ajit Pradhan's house.

806
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,000
If you don't have the manners
then at least lower your voice.

807
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,900
It doesn't matter, Mr. Pradhan.
He's childish.

808
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,700
Nothing! Let's go.

809
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:44,400
He's very childish. But even
you are acting like a kid.

810
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,700
With small mistakes
you suffer huge loss.

811
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,500
Hey! Who are you threatening?

812
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,500
Let our rule take over
in the next six months.

813
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,100
The first thing I'll do is get
you killed by the police.

814
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,000
Then you and your crazy
Bhai will be...

815
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,600
...found somewhere in
a sewer like dogs.

816
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,300
You are childish! -
I made him understand.

817
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,800
If you are then, you are.
Come, let's go.

818
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Cussing me!

819
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Yes, sir, over here.

820
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,900
Sir is here. Sir, one
question, please.

821
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,000
As you know that Mr. Pradhan...

822
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,200
...was a well known celebrity
of this city. - Yes sir!

823
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,400
He had quiet good political
connections.

824
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,900
That's why this case has been
handed over to the crime branch.

825
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,100
Hey, make it fast. - Bring
it here, quickly.

826
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
That's why I tell you,
if you want to eat...

827
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,200
...kebab then eat it in Mahim.

828
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,200
You are right. It tastes
very good. - Yes!

829
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,200
What's wrong with him?
