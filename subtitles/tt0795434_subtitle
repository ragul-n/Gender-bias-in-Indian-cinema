and send you to jall

609
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,085
when you would come out

610
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,486
you would be a grand parent

611
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,028
and me vlrglne father

612
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,227

you don't do any thlng

614
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,499
because whenever
you try to do somthlng

615
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:15,061
It goes opposlte

616
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,204

617
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:19,908
and me my wlfe

618
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,536

623
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:43,788
thls Is the tlme for true love

624
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,098
If she would see that love

625
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,895

01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,105

old Identlty, relglon

If thls talk reached
Punjab

876
02:03:37,777 --> 02:03:40,746
they would make
fun of me

877
02:03:41,247 --> 02:03:42,908
no, no, no
thls wont work

878
02:03:43,115 --> 02:03:45,709
thls Ilst Is gettlng too long
you are Invltlng too many people

879
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:48,613
It would be too expenslve
cut out some names

880
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:50,185
I have cut name of
Hansmukh Bhal Patel

881
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:54,826
why dld you cut hls name
I have known hlm for 20 years

882
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:57,090
and you dldnt see
hlm for last 18 years

883
02:03:59,231 --> 02:04:01,859
ok Invlte hlm
but on the condltlon that

884
02:04:02,067 --> 02:04:05,002
he would'nt eat
thls Is a good Idea

885
02:04:06,172 --> 02:04:07,662
and who else should I
ask to not to eat

886
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:12,071
even better Is to charge
the guests per plate

887
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:14,941
and earn money from your
daughter's weddlng

888
