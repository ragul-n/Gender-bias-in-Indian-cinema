your luck is so messed up

Even your shoes are in tatters

00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,475
Your luck is so messed up.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,605
My father says...

63
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,568
son, you hold your destiny
in your own hands.'

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,645
But if I go by his words.
Which I seldom do, then by God...

65
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,942
my destiny is fast asleep!

66
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,213
Do colleges also have morning assembly?

67
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,177
No man.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,670
Only school teachers are obsessed
with morning assembly and uniforms.

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,099
College is all about scoring girls.

70
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,166
You're right man.

71
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,199
In government schools,
it's guys chasing guys!

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,702
You know Amit from the 12th grade?

73

Yeah.

74
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,548
He was in the toilet yesterday
with Rahul during assembly.

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,444
Are you serious?

76
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,377
Of course!

77
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:57,433
We'll walk hand in hand,
we'll walk hand in hand,

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,115
We'll walk hand in
hand someday;

79
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,499
Dude, we can easilyjump over this wall.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,275
Why break our backs over this stupid hole?

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,099
Choocha!

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,445
We have only a couple
of days of school to leave our mark behind.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,266
That's all we've been doing
for the past two years.

84
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,099
Trust me. this year we will graduate!

85
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,021
I swear on your mother!

86
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:26,280
Dude, is it difficult to bunk
lectures in college?

87
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,599
No man.

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,102
You can do anything you want.

89
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,266
Study if you want to,
otherwise forget it.

90
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,770
Lounge in the canteen, hang around...

91
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,099
take in the scent of beautiful girls...

92
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,266
try and score with them...

93
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:43,337
kiss them anytime, anywhere...

94
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,766
no one bothers.

95
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,440
Sounds exciting!

96
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,344
Dude we're going
to college together!

97
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,999
I'll become someone's boyfriend
on the very first day.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,536
Hello May Day...

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,766
Attention... the wall is about
to be breached!

100
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:56,336
Fire!

101
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:13,166
Dear god, you are the almighty.

102
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,443
You know everything there is to know...

103
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,511
but I'd like to remind you once again.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,632
Please get me migrated into
Shalu's college this year.

105
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,699
It didn't happen last year, but this year
please make it happen.

106
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,099
I will offer prayers daily.

107
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,477
Please. God.

108
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,466
Bishop College.

109
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,277
Just reminding you since there are
so many colleges.

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
Bachelor of Commerce, 2nd year.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,273
Give him your exam roll number as well.

112
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:17,275
Sir...

113
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,680
there was a cooking gas cylinder
along with these milk cans...

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,542
now its gone.

115
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,108
Did you see anyone take it?

116
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,140
No, brother, I don't drink milk.

117
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,766
In college. the girls will be...

118
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,610
Shut up, Choocha!

119
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,032
Stop sucking up.

120
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,266
Or I won't go with you.

121
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,371
Sorry bro.

122
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,532
Just that I'm really excited.

123
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,166
We'll sort you out,
but for now, be quiet.

124
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:51,668
Okay...

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,771
I am sure it will be fun.

126
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,442
Stop...

127
00:07:58,433 --> 00:07:59,673
look...

128
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,775
Sardarji, want to buy a gas cylinder?

129
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,043
Half price!

130
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:58,448
What are you staring at'?

131
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,010
I found it on the street.

132
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,274
Cylinder?

133
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,766
Yeah.

134
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:03,541
You found it?

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,266
Yeah.

136
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,099
On the street?

137
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,666
Yeah.

138
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,045
I'll beat the crap out of you.

139
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,466
You bloody dope head...

140
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,599
selling my own cylinder back to me'?!

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,274
Whoa... I'm not a thief.

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,211
I found it on the street.

143
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,266
How does it belong to you?

144
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,008
I'll tell you!

145
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,599
Okay... fine...

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,666
you can keep it.

147
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,305
As a gift.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,503
I am very rich anyway.

149
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,544
All my money's gathering dust...

150
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,668
Just leave.

151
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,373
Sardarji...

152
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,603
how about a plate of chole-bhatura?

153
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,778
Can't you hear my
stomach growl?

154
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:02,768
<i>Chow...</i>

155
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,370
give him a serving of chole-bhatura.

156
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,603
Here you go.

157
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,766
Dumbass, can't you serve properly?

158
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,474
You think I'm a homeless beggar?

159
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,036
What the...

160
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,632
You think this is your father's wedding
reception to feed him for free'?

161
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,443
Why don't you slice me up
and add me to his dish?

162
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:24,448
You think this is a soup kitchen?

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,603
Hello?

164
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,710
In five minutes.

165
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,105
I'll be there.

166
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,273
Now he's got angels falling for him
where are you off to?

167
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,766
Dad, that was Raju.
He's clearing our dues today.

168
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,270
Did Raju rob a bank last night...

169
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,599
that he wants to clear our dues?

170
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,666
You think I'm an idiot?

171
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,613
He really called me,
I'll see you later.

172
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:50,782
What a bad start to the day.
I can't even set my beard!

173
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:19,342
10 more seconds and
I'd have taken the bus.

174
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,466
Have I ever been late?

175
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,140
You know what my dad's like.

176
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,205
He can't set his beard unless
he yells at me every morning.

177
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,102
How was the movie yesterday?

178
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,468
It was okay.

179
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,266
You never take me along
with your college friends.

180
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:39,599
I'm in college too.

181
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,171
You aren't in college,
you're studying through correspondence.

182
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,144
It's the same thing.

183
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,766
Anyway, I'm coming to
your college next year.

184
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,145
So hang with us next year then.

185
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,543
You've become very rude lately.

186
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,434
Never mind.

187
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,205
You'll show me around
your college today?

188
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:03,112
I've been asking you for so long.
Say something.

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,705
Fine!

190
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,310
Only if Pandit lets us go.

191
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,271
Who is Pandit?

192
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,511
What's u p, Panditj I?

193
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,304
Nothing new...

194
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,143
it's the same grind everyday.

195
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,666
I'm stuck in his shithole
for other reasons

196
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,546
or I would've quit this job long ago.

197
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,771
You see this room?

198
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,673
Back home the bull knocks up cows
in a room bigger than this.

199
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,432
You're right. Panditji.

200
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,873
My dad said the same thing
to my mom.

201
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,099
Anyway, tell me something...

202
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,099
how much do we have to score
to make it to college?

203
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,545
At least, 85 %

204
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,137
You must be kidding!

205
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,999
You are kidding yourself
to even think about college.

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,447
All year round you make
life hell for others.

207
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,276
Now it's your turn to feel the heat.

208
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,773
There is another way in...

209
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,913
If you want, I can pull some strings.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,536
Panditji, any way will do.

211
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,632
We'll tear through the roof,
if necessary.

212
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,442
Tell us what you can do.

213
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,644
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.

214
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,766
What do you mean out?

215
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,338
Out. Choocha, out!

216
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,779
When he says they're out,
he means they've been leaked.

217
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,666
Holy shit Panditji!

218
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,271
Please do something for us.

219
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,999
Consider it done.

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,766
Come here a day before every exam.

221
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,508
50,000 rupees
for every exam paper.

222
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,110
Fifty?!!

223
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,343
That's too much!

224
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,210
I'm charging others 60,000.

225
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,366
This is a discount for you.

226
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,677
Why'? Do you fancy us. or what?

227
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,440
He's so vulgar!

228
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,445
Shut up!

229
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,432
Panditji, you'll give us
the real papers right?

230
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,432
My papers will have better
printing than the real ones.

231
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:58,499
Get the money in place.

232
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,104
You only have a week.

233
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,612
Seven days only.

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,274
Get it?

235
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,999
Panditji, can we
walk around the college once?

236
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,536
I really want to go inside.

237
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,476
Never seen one.

238
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,376
Please don't say no.

239
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,114
Please. Panditji.

240
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,766
Come on Sunday
and I'll give you a tour!

241
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,179
Why? You want us to come and hang around
with the gardener's daughter?

242
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,366
Five minutes is all we want...

243
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,599
we'll be out in two!

244
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,766
Try to understand
you can't go in!

245
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:20,472
Panditji...

246
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,277
can he go in with me?

247
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,440
He's only going to drop me off, please.

248
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,107
Take.

249
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,179
Panditji, how could you let him in'?
Even he doesn't study here...

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,373
But his girlfriend does.

251
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,599
Huh! She's not his girlfriend.

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,046
I've seen her with Monty
a lot of times.

253
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,099
Really? Monty?

254
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,499
Yeah.

255
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,604
You mean, cheating?

256
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,740
Shut it Choocha.

257
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:52,176
Panditji, please let us go in
or he won't stop until Sunday.

258
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,441
Please.

259
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,266
Okay. okay...

260
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,766
Listen. if anyone asks.
Say that you are Zafar's cousins.

261
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:02,338
Is Zafar the big bully here?

262
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:04,369
Not a bull. but a cow.

263
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,611
He was the cool dude some years ago.
But is lying low now.

264
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,499
I pull strings for
people all the time...

265
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,639
but Zafar once pulled strings for me.

266
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:37,308
A star shines in my soul

267
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:44,042
And shows me the path

268
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,378
Shows me grace in an unfinished note

269
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,011
And

270
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,771
And

271
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,443
Lord, I can't take it anymore

272
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,311
Say something

273
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,143
Lord, open the doors of destiny

274
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,046
Please open them

275
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,699
Lord, I can't take it anymore

276
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,544
Say something

277
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,376
Lord, open the doors of destiny

278
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:29,277
Please open them

279
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,041
All my dreams

280
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,272
Are shut in a box

281
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:40,376
Lord, make a hole in that box

282
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,343
Lord, I can't take it anymore

283
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,266
Say something

284
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,099
Lord, open the doors of destiny

285
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,774
Please open them

286
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,109
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,140
They speak to me every day

288
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,432
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes

289
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:29,141
They speak to me every day

290
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,143
They are in my eyes. in all I say

291
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,773
Yet so far from my reach

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,139
I've lost all patience

293
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,206
Give me some mantra

294
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:47,780
I've been vying for your
attention for so long

295
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,177
Lord, I can't take it anymore

296
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,044
Say something

297
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,766
Lord, open the doors of destiny

298
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,475
Please open them

299
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,444
Lord, I can't take it anymore

300
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,277
Say something

301
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,144
Lord, open the doors of destiny

302
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,773
Please open them

303
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:18,432
A star shines in my soul

304
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:23,266
And shows me the path

305
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:28,267
Shows me grace in an unfinished note

306
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,315
Let the tune be completed

307
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:35,213
A rhythm is at play

308
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,332
And melody flows

309
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:42,214
This continues

310
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:47,266
Sometimes with words. sometimes without

311
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:52,717
Our conversations. continue

312
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:58,711
A star shines in my soul

313
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,502
Dude!

314
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,999
You play the violin just like
Shahrukh does in his films.

315
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,999
Fantastic!

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,999
There you go again making
a jerk of yourself!

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,604
It's a guitar, not a violin!

318
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,543
Right?

319
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,047
Hunny. stop embarrassing me
in front of strangers, okay?

320
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,366
Whatever it is,
you are really good.

321
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,108
What course are you in?

322
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,999
I don't study here.

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,766
Oh, so you teach music?

324
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,713
Like Shahrukh Khan from
'Mohabbatein?

325
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:31,766
Hey!

326
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,442
He doesn't teach here
and you don't study here.

327
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,466
Aren't your five minutes up yet?

328
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,999
We were just leaving, relax.

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,379
Before we leave,
won't you introduce us to Zafar?

330
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:46,346
Let's see what breed your cow is.

331
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:50,205
That's like asking if the sun is out
on a hot, sunny afternoon.

332
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:53,111
You are standing in his presence.

333
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,132
Him?

334
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,339
That's amazing, Panditji.

335
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,532
I've decided that as soon as we get
admission, I'm taking up the guitar.

336
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,699
Hunny. girls are crazy for guitarists!

337
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,476
Chicks will stick to you like magnets if
you've got a guitar.

338
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,446
Hey... time is up!

339
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,340
You better get the money in time.

340
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,999
You're top breed. for sure, brother!

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,037
Seven days only, get it'?

342
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,776
So, Mr. Rockstar...

343
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,707
do you intend wasting your
talent over here?

344
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,006
When will you hit the big time?

345
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,171
Huh?

346
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,434
Album?

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,604
I'm asking because I'm worried about you.

348
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,666
I've known you for six years.

349
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,599
You rocked this place for the first three.

350
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,773
The other three I still don't understand.

351
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,432
Anything clicked yet?

352
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,344
No, Panditji.

353
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,599
They know my face so well at all the
auditions and reality shows...

354
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,320
they don't even let me in through the gate.

355
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,776
As for recording an album,
that's another ballgame altogether.

356
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:53,766
How could that be?

357
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,212
I mean, here you play so well.

358
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:56,599
I get your music, they don't?

359
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,102
It's not their fault.

360
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,437
These strings are tied to someone else.

361
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,545
When that person is away,
the music also goes away.

362
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,143
Touching.

363
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,774
I get what you're saying.

364
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,372
Keep playing-

365
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,307
If you need any help. let me know.

366
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,772
This is my new visiting card.

367
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,207
Look...

368
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,302
it has my picture too.

369
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,509
What do you think?

370
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:24,337
Good.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,707
Carry on... see you later.

372
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,343
Dude, I have a dream.

373
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,666
On our first day of college...

374
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,442
we will enter on horses.

375
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,466
You riding the white horse...

376
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,766
and I on the black...

377
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:48,099
wearing black sunglasses,
long leather boots with zippers...

378
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,466
red shirts and black pants.

379
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,538
Shirts buttoned up to the collar.

380
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,143
Dude, girls will kill for us.

381
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:59,709
That reminds me...

382
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,568
I forgot to tell you
about the dream I had this morning!

383
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,110
You jerk!

384
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,666
All you've done is talk nonsense all day...

385
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,146
missing out on what's really important.

386
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,199
As it is,
you've had a dream after bloody ages.

387
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,332
Sorry, dude.

388
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,599
The thing is I dream every night,
but sometimes I forget.

389
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,374
So anyway...

390
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:18,180
I saw. you were at the Jumbo Circus.

391
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,200
And ajumbo,
I mean an elephant goes wild...

392
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,766
and instead of playing with a colourful
ball, it takes you in its trunk...

393
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,678
and starts banging you on the floor.

394
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:32,766
That's when I get there
and rescue you from its trunk.

395
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:36,681
Then I wrap the trunk around my hand
and whack it with one blow.

396
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,701
Knock-out!

397
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,432
You bloody scoundrel...

398
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:45,666
elephants banging me on the floor,
horses dragging me...

399
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,766
next it'll be a donkey kicking me...

400
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,271
Smart ass. a little puppy
scares you to bits...

401
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,109
and you think you can whack an elephant!

402
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:53,702
Knock-out'?!

403
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,599
Dude, you can't control what you
see in a dream.

404
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,766
A dream is a dream.

405
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,041
Anything is possible.

406
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,432
Anything is possible!

407
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,037
Shut up now!
Let me figure it out.

408
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:07,307
Mad elephant... elephant...

409
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,442
elephant as in Ganpati.

410
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,766
As in?

411
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,110
Lord Ganesha!

412
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,443
Lord Ganesha?

413
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,999
Bloody Englishman!

414
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,638
Indian Gods are so colourful!

415
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,146
Dude, don't confuse.

416
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,199
That was Lord Hanuman,
this is Lord Ganesha.

417
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,702
Hang on to Lord Ganesha.

418
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,338
Lord Ganesha...

419
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,275
also known <i>as</i> Shri Ganesh.

420
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,308
And 'a whack with the hand'...

421
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,432
a hand has five fingers...

422
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,776
five!

423
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,612
So it's number five on Shri Ganesh.

424
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:41,768
Let's go.

425
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,104
Here they come again.

426
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,678
A hundred tickets for Shri Ganesh,
number four.

427
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,045
Shri Ganesh... number four...

428
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,104
Do you have number four?

429
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,210
No.

430
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,476
Sorry, we're out of four.

431
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,477
In that case,
we'll go with number eight.

432
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,442
Number eight...

433
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,775
Do you have number eight?

434
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,108
No, out of eight too.

435
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,444
Really?

436
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,272
What do we do, Choocha?

437
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,045
Let's take number three.

438
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,766
Three?

439
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,474
No, I think we should go
with number five.

440
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,432
Screw what you think, let's go for three.

441
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:55,532
I don't get you...

442
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,599
Don't argue.

443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,271
I want number three.

444
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,366
Oh no. number five.

445
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,632
Dude, shut up!
Why don't you get it?

446
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,766
Tell me, do you have number five?

447
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,440
This is not fair, Hunny.

448
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,266
Hey! I asked for number five,
not your daughter's hand in marriage.

449
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,144
Hurry up, it's almost time for the draw.

450
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,169
Scoundrels!

451
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,669
Pulled a fast one again!

452
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,199
Cut, cut...

453
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,700
Sorry.

454
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,432
Lucky 13...

455
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,107
Sir, sir...
the talkback is off...

456
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,442
Start!

457
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,174
What's wrong?

458
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,599
Even pirated CDs don't
get stuck like you do.

459
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,766
We've done 13 takes.

460
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,007
Lucky 13!

461
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,175
Get back in tune
and start singing.

462
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,110
Come on, start...

463
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,777
Sir, I can't do it.

464
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,111
Sir, I'm unable to sing.

465
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,766
Let's pack up for today.

466
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:26,609
Pack UP?

467
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,278
If you're calling the shots here,
what do you want me for?

468
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,211
You think. I'm here for your autograph?

469
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,999
If you can't sing, get lost.

470
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,104
Out!

471
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:39,432
Call the percussionists in.
Let's see what they can do.

472
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,999
Listen Mr. Rockstar,
if you continue to sing like this...

473
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,210
very soon you'll be sporting wrinkles,
but your album won't see the light of day.

474
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,035
Now get lost!

475
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,442
Sir...

476
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:14,102
Yes?

477
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,766
Did you see anyone steal
my motorcycle tyre?

478
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,610
No brother, I'm not married.

479
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,704
You dopehead!

480
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,610
Stop right there!

481
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,800
Lali...

482
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,276
Although it's none of my business,
I'd like to tell you something.

483
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,713
Look I know you're hurt but...

484
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,510
it's not necessary that your school friends
remain friends in college too.

485
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,275
A lot changes when
you are in college.

486
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,466
You start a whole new life.

487
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:06,110
Ma'am, that doesn't mean you
give up on old friends for new.

488
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:07,466
No, not at all.

489
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:10,209
Friendship doesn't end
but priorities change.

490
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,544
Sometimes, a person's tastes also change...

491
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,011
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say.

492
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,773
Take care.

493
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,605
Excuse me. ma'am!

494
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,766
I meant her.

495
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:56,266
Ma'am, don't you teach at BCMC?

496
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:56,767
Yes.

497
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,713
Ma'am, I want to transfer
to your college next year?

498
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,305
Good luck.

499
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:06,771
Sure, but what I mean is...
if you could teach me...

500
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,509
Me?

501
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,299
Take tuition classes.

502
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,179
I tried but all batches are full.

503
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,111
Moreover most of the syllabus
is completed.

504
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,633
So, how can I help?

505
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:19,274
Ma'am, don't you teach accountancy?

506
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:20,104
Yes.

507
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,372
I heard from Shalu.

508
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,204
Ma'am, I find accountancy tough.

509
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:25,432
I can't figure it out...

510
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,777
whereas, I've studied
all the other subjects.

511
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:30,770
Sorry, ma'am.

512
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,043
<i>Ma'am, please ma'am.</i>

513
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,466
Accountancy is very difficult.

514
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,504
Look. don't get me wrong.

515
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:40,146
I know why you are doing this...
don't rush into it.

516
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,266
No, ma'am, I'm not rushing.

517
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,109
Please. ma'am.

518
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,170
Alright...

519
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,177
we'll begin this evening,
at my place.

520
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,432
Will you manage?

521
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:59,140
Yes, ma'am. no problem.

522
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,278
Thank you, ma'am.

523
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:06,176
Listen. think about what
I was trying to tell you earlier.

524
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,270
It will help you.

525
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:08,134
See you.

526
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:13,768
I've thought about it...

527
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,544
I have a point to make.

528
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:22,173
When I go out with another girl
in the same college...

529
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,272
that's when she'll realise.

530
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,277
Today is your last day in school.

531
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,999
Your board exams begin in five days...

532
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,378
and today you'll get your
roll numbers.

533
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,482
Only those students whose attendance is
more than 75% will get their roll numbers.

534
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,343
There are two dimwits who won't get them.

535
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,672
Stand up as I call out your names.

536
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,174
Dalip Singh and Vikas Gulati.

537
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,440
Wow.

538
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,433
Standing up even before
your names are called.

539
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,469
Excellent!

540
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,543
Sumit, take this...

541
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,770
and distribute these roll numbers outside.

542
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:16,707
You two... come here.

543
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:27,999
Scoundrels, if you weren't attending
my tuition classes...

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,999
I'd have never given you your roll numbers.

545
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,104
Here.

546
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,610
Got my tuition fees'?

547
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,110
Yes sir.

548
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:38,011
Put it here and get lost!

549
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,273
Sir, which college did you attend?

550
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:48,046
I mean, was attendance
compulsory there too?

551
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,666
Let me remind you. numbskull...

552
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:54,342
this is the year you make
a hat trick of failures.

553
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,632
You're thinking about college and...

554
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:59,206
I'm thinking about where I will
put you in this classroom.

555
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,269
Now get lost.

556
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,766
We shouldn't have given him the fees.

557
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,440
Now, how will we arrange the money
to pay for the question papers?

558
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:19,266
If we hadn't bought roll numbers off him, we
couldn't even have appeared for the exams.

559
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:22,599
And if you take that many days to come up
with a dream, how will I arrange the money?

560
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,432
Where is today's dream'?

561
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:27,279
Dude, I dream every night but
I don't always remember it.

562
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,699
Remember that Hollywood film...

563
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,644
Inception?

564
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,305
The one with the Titanic' hero...

565
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,432
It was shown that they use needles
to get inside the brain.

566
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:35,766
Why don't you come up with
something like that?

567
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:38,304
Then you can poke some needles in me
and watch my dream with me.

568
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,145
It's not easy to remember my dreams.

569
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,860
Are you going to burn
a hole in the building?

570
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:18,667
You stroll by, to get close to me

571
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,311
You stroll by, to get close to me

572
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Sometimes you look in my eyes,
sometimes you gaze at my walk

573
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:35,279
Sometimes you look in my eyes,
sometimes you gaze at my walk

574
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed

575
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:45,767
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me

576
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Am barsariya, ho Am barsariya

577
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,333
Dude. Your confidence
frightens me sometimes.

578
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,211
And your own face doesn't?

579
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,475
You can't be bird watching here.

580
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,343
Think about the exams!

581
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,779
We have five days to pay Panditji.

582
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:13,599
Another year we'll have to rot in school.

583
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,102
Shut up, you jinx!

584
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,599
Can't you be happy at my progress'?

585
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,772
Yeah right!

586
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:22,278
Once in 1st grade.
Twice in 6th grade...

587
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,507
and for the third bloody time in the 12th.

588
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:25,633
Progress!

589
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,179
Who fails in the 1st grade, man??

590
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,276
Will you be my friend?

591
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,376
If yes, then hold the kite up.

592
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:13,433
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed

593
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:18,767
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me

594
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:28,210
Ambarsariya

595
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,699
So, you want to be my friend?

596
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,203
If I didn't want to,
would I hold up the kite?

597
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,666
Yeah... but only friends, nothing more.

598
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,305
Don't ever say 'l love you' to me.

599
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:47,679
Of course not.
Why would I say, 'l love you'?

600
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,266
You're not my girlfriend.

601
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:52,599
Anyway, I already have a girlfriend.

602
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,046
Really? What's her name?

603
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,340
First tell me yours.

604
00:37:57,434 --> 00:37:58,777
Priya. now tell me her name.

605
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:03,133
Jasmine. she is in college.

606
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,613
She's a year older than me.

607
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:08,333
Actually, I have a thing for mature girls.

608
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,999
You get
to learn a lot from them.

609
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,446
Really? What mature things
has she taught you?

610
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,176
Well...

611
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,780
she taught me how to kiss.

612
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:20,107
What's there to teach in a kiss?

613
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:24,276
Not your regular kiss,
a mature kiss.

614
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,011
French kiss!

615
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,766
French kiss?

616
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:29,711
What's that?

617
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,344
You know what it is.

618
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,507
I really don't know.
Tell me, please.

619
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:44,282
You put your lips together and...

620
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:45,274
What?

621
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,273
You put your lips together
and let your tongue do the magic.

622
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,643
That's French kiss.

623
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,109
So...

624
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,599
you've French kissed this girl?

625
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,446
Of course! Every time we meet,
we French kiss.

626
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:08,299
I don't want to be your friend.
You talk dirty.

627
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,299
Great.

628
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,999
You were the one who asked
what a French kiss was!

629
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,276
I don't care,
I don't want to talk to you, ever!

630
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:20,381
And if you ever come to the roof again,
I'll make sure my dad thrashes you.

631
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,706
Now that's what you call a crash landing!

632
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,507
Okay. so...

633
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:51,433
debit is what comes in,
credit is what goes out.

634
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:54,499
This is the basic rule
for all general entries.

635
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,447
Apply this rule and
make a general entry for Rent paid.

636
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,546
Ma'am, this is the only
entry I can't get right!

637
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,206
Write... rent debit, credit cash.

638
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,999
Ma'am, why do we credit cash?

639
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,708
When we get rent
shouldn't we debit it. instead?

640
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,766
This isn't the rent you get for
your shop.

641
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,043
This is the rent you
have to pay.

642
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,699
Oh! This is that one. Right.

643
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,179
Now I get it.

644
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,543
Now apply the basic rule to it.

645
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,110
Which rule?

646
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:30,499
What do you mean, which rule'?

647
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,309
I just told you a minute ago.

648
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:33,677
Oh! That one...

649
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:40,440
Debit what comes in,
credit what goes out.

650
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,278
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

651
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:53,309
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

652
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,269
What's next?

653
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,828
Zafar. I know what music
means to you...

654
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,447
but you have other
responsibilities too, don't you'?

655
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,610
Neetu?

656
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,613
I need your support...

657
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:23,604
not pressure, please!

658
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:25,609
Pressure?

659
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,109
Okay-

660
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,674
How much more time do you need?

661
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,510
Perfect!

662
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:33,544
Now you doubt me?

663
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,212
Listen. I didn't say that.

664
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,740
But this way it can go on forever, right?

665
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,540
Be practical, Zafar...

666
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:45,599
music is good as a hobby.

667
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,341
Music isn't my hobby, Neetu.

668
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:53,042
So what am I... your hobby or...

669
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,466
Oh come on, Neetu... seriously...

670
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,099
don't behave like a kid.

671
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,138
I'm not behaving like a kid.
But you sure are.

672
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,342
Tell me, music or me?

673
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,444
Neetu!

674
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:04,674
Music or me?

675
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:12,771
Music.

676
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,002
Remember one thing Zafar...

677
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:41,009
if you fail to make it as a musician,
I'll never forgive you.

678
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,705
Because you're sacrificing
our relationship for your music.

679
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,308
Remember this.

680
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:22,445
Find a fix. find a quick fix

681
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:27,307
Find a fix. find a quick fix

682
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,432
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

683
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:36,779
Find a fix. find a quick fix

684
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:42,282
Find a fix. find a quick fix

685
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,333
What's cooking, bro'?

686
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:45,176
Nothing.

687
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,442
Sure seemed like something.

688
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:49,140
A little social service.

689
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:52,333
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.

690
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:54,766
I wanted to line up my buyers before
I go buy them.

691
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:56,542
But they're all
a bunch of bloody losers.

692
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,277
That's true.

693
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:02,433
You also want papers?

694
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:04,436
No, no. I'm taking tuition classes.

695
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,035
Huh!

696
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,699
Like tuitions have ever helped anyone?

697
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,111
I'm taking tuition classes.'

698
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:09,433
Actually, you're right.

699
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:12,176
Accountancy is like a
twisted pretzel for me!

700
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,146
I just don't get it.

701
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:19,113
But not for 12th grade,
I need papers for 1st year college.

702
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:19,999
Can I get them?

703
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,276
But aren't you studying
through correspondence?

704
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:24,440
So what?
It's the same thing.

705
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:26,766
College and correspondence
- The same thing!

706
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,766
If it were the same. we'd be
Doctor Hunny and Choocha by now!

707
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:29,609
Tell me, please...

708
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,136
Dude, go and meet Panditji.

709
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,044
College and correspondence...

710
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,341
Who? The BCMC guy?

711
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,211
Yes, he can pull a lot of strings.

712
00:44:39,267 --> 00:44:40,599
Meet him and say,
'Hunny referred your name.'

713
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,766
He will fix things for you.

714
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:42,472
Okay?

715
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,137
See you.

716
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:43,807
How much is it'?

717
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:45,666
Never mind. brother.

718
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:46,441
<i>Chow...</i>

719
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,441
64 rupees.

720
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:51,170
If you want to save yourself

721
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,533
If you want a future

722
00:44:53,534 --> 00:44:55,999
From here and there, from anywhere

723
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,536
Grab what you can

724
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,666
You have to reach here.

725
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:04,171
Mr. Narayan Pandit,
from rags to riches.

726
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,611
How're you, Panditji?

727
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,007
Fine...

728
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,271
God's been kind.

729
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,466
What brings you here?

730
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,777
Hunny told me you leak exam papers.

731
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,101
What the...

732
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,433
Keep it down.

733
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:23,607
You're asking for papers
like they're candy!

734
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,603
Sorry.

735
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,042
Which grade?

736
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,111
Now don't keep it so low
that even I can't hear you.

737
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,433
Bachelor of Commerce,
first year. correspondence.

738
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:44,708
Only the accountancy paper.

739
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,546
I don't mess
around with the university...

740
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:57,336
But I can fix you up with something else.

741
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,199
As in?

742
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,146
You want admission in this college, right?

743
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:01,533
Yes!

744
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:02,604
I knew it.

745
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,314
I don't think you can get in on merit.

746
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,476
But if you donate 250.000 to the
President's fund, your seat is fixed.

747
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:12,533
President's fund?

748
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,207
Yeah... full guarantee.

749
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,341
I will get the form
signed and sealed, myself!

750
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,043
Listen carefully... seats are limited.

751
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,699
You delay and
you'll be hanging around for another year.

752
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,337
Okay?

753
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,109
Only two hundred and fifty thousand!

754
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:28,708
Two hundred and fifty thousand!

755
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:30,337
Two hundred and fifty thousand')?

756
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,433
You son of a gun.
Have you lost it?

757
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:35,142
Which college takes a fee of 250,000??

758
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:39,099
In my time we studied in makeshift
schools at a two and a half rupee fee...

759
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,670
that also sometimes we didn't pay.

760
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,099
250,000!

761
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,366
As it is nothing gets in
through your thick skull...

762
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,041
Forget bloody college
and sit here at the shop with me.

763
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,666
All he does is waste his time...

764
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:51,699
hanging out in college
or chasing girls.

765
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,010
And he wants. two hundred
and fifty thousand!

766
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,999
I can't help you.

767
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,766
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

768
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,371
Someone will come...

769
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,633
Zafa r...

770
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,599
I don't know how this happened...

771
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,375
he was perfectly fine
when he left home.

772
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:22,042
The doctor suggested that it's better
we admit him to a private hospital.

773
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:25,271
For that we need about 100,000 rupees.

774
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,373
And then some
more for treatment.

775
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,599
How will we manage that?

776
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,705
Take a look at him.

777
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,099
Here you go...

778
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,466
we've taken the blood sample.

779
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:39,674
You can submit the urine sample
at the desk outside.

780
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,274
Zafa r...

781
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:09,270
my father thrust a
butcher's knife in my hand...

782
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,473
but your father won't do that to you.

783
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:17,607
Make music with your heart, not your mind.

784
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:52,646
Find a fix. find a quick fix

785
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:57,547
Find a fix. find a quick fix

786
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,642
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

787
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:06,706
Find a fix. find a quick fix

788
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,304
If you want to save yourself

789
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,666
If you want a future

790
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:15,147
From here and there, from anywhere

791
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:16,703
Grab what you can

792
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,512
Find a fix. find a quick fix

793
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,699
The world doesn't rest on hope

794
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,476
The world rests on a quick fix

795
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,499
The world rests on a quick fix

796
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,310
Up and down, everyone is a hustler,

797
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:36,333
A huge hustler, heavy hustler

798
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:38,599
You come make your mark too

799
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,046
You come make your mark too

800
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:45,009
Make your mark

801
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:47,372
Happy birthday, Pradhanji.

802
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:50,208
Welcome my dear Bombay princess!

803
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,608
Your timing is perfect.

804
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,433
I was just thinking about you.

805
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:55,344
Really?

806
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,999
I thought you were giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

807
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,104
Hello ma'am...

808
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,699
I love the way you play with words.

809
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,611
Strikes a chord every time!

810
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,673
Let's talk business.

811
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:11,780
Dimple has sprained her leg
and only you can dance like her.

812
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:13,999
I'll pay you well.

813
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,377
Set the stage on fire, today!

814
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,001
Hi sexy!

815
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,107
Are you out of your freaking mind?

816
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,533
Come on... you look like a bear.

817
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,099
By God. the audience won't enjoy it.

818
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,166
You want me to make
an ass of myself for your audience?

819
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,266
I'll pay you three thousand more for this.

820
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:43,766
Six!

821
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:44,302
Four!

822
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:45,766
Done deal. trim down the jungle.

823
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:46,999
Go... shave it off.

824
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,035
Dare you move!

825
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:50,299
Is it your father's bloody crop, you jerk!

826
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,266
Pradhan, you better step aside or...

827
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,266
I'll actually set fire to the stage!

828
00:50:55,267 --> 00:50:56,433
Hey... listen to me.

829
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,099
Hunny...

830
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,199
how will we arrange the money?

831
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,440
Don't go!

832
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,666
Pradhan, I'll dance.

833
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,099
You
can even tweeze my eyebrows off.

834
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,599
Look at this.

835
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,511
Unnati. Unnati

836
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,774
Shake it baby, Unnati.

837
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,044
Your walk is sweet like sugar syrup

838
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,099
Unnati Oh. Unnati.

839
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,635
Shut up!

840
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:14,643
Let's go.

841
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:15,633
Let's go.

842
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,272
Pradhan, I'll dance better.

843
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:33,767
Dude...

844
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,309
our destiny isn't sleeping.

845
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:37,540
It's bloody dead!

846
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,344
Time flies

847
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:46,999
Catch up with it

848
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,500
Come on.

849
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:50,204
Get into someone's pockets

850
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:52,533
Or fall at someone's feet

851
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:55,037
If you want to save yourself

852
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,366
If you want a future

853
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,699
From here and there, from anywhere

854
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,180
Grab what you can

855
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,299
I always meant when I said that...

856
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,042
I don't guard a college.
But a treasure.

857
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:10,779
The first few months may look bleak, but
you'll see the results in a year or two.

858
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,543
Trust me. it's as good as a pension.

859
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,771
Hello Panditji.

860
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,774
How nice to see you, Sardarji.
You've come at the right time.

861
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,433
Would you like some tea?

862
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:22,344
Sure.

863
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:23,368
Have a seat.

864
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,274
What have you decided?

865
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,466
Is it possible to get a discount?

866
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:34,099
How can I give a discount on
a discounted rate?

867
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,333
People are paying 350,000.
You can ask Zafar here.

868
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:39,177
What have you got to worry'?

869
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,146
You're the only son of Mr. Billa,
the famous restaurant owner.

870
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:44,433
His one stir in his pot
will churn out 250,000!

871
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:46,436
He will stir fry me in
the same pot instead!

872
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:50,141
In that case,
enjoy your first and last cup of tea here.

873
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,272
Oh come on Panditji...

874
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:55,213
has anyone ever walked out
of here empty handed?

875
00:52:55,267 --> 00:52:58,499
Your flattery won't help,
let's get straight to business.

876
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,599
You've got only three days to go,
have you managed the money?

877
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,171
The thing is Panditji...
we haven't got the money yet.

878
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:06,276
But I have a kick-ass idea.

879
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,099
I'll pay for all the
question papers in one go.

880
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,046
All I need is
someone to bankroll us.

881
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:15,110
I wouldn't even bankroll my own son.

882
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,299
No of fence, but I'm sure your fathers
stand by your own father!

883
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,112
It's not a children's savings plan,
it's a business investment.

884
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,704
Really? What's this business
that I don't know of'?

885
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,535
The thing is...

886
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,646
our Choocha is a golden goose...

887
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,766
every morning he lays a golden egg.

888
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:36,433
I mean, every night he has a dream.

889
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:38,533
The next morning I break that dream down
to a lottery number.

890
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:40,104
Hold on!

891
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,514
I take the world for a ride.
Don't you try to hoodwink me!

892
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:47,276
Playing lottery is banned
in Delhi for 10 years.

893
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,170
Panditji...

894
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,099
you may be older,
but we are wiser.

895
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,276
You sit here in this cubicle, while we've
visited every nook and cranny in this city.

896
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,432
Delhi has four borders,
that's where lotteries are sold in bulk.

897
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,276
All you have to do is
mention our name there.

898
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,043
If it were a small amount,
we wouldn't bother you.

899
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,499
But this calls for millions.

900
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,666
Your investment. our skill...

901
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,305
profit for all, what say'?

902
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,766
Listen. you day dreaming jerk...

903
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:16,043
I'll be right back with Zafafs stuff.

904
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:19,599
Have your tea and get going.

905
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,704
Zafar. wait for me.

906
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:22,778
Trying to sell a dream to me.

907
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,173
Don't worry. Choocha.
Panditls an idiot.

908
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,440
He'll regret this later.

909
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:35,345
Yuck, the miser hasn't even added sugar.

910
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:36,928
Can you please add some sugar, Choocha?

911
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:44,169
What are the returns like?

912
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,432
Brother. the more sugar you add,
sweeter the tea will be.

913
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,599
Absolutely!

914
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,080
100,000 will give you a million,
200,000 will give two million.

915
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,707
You want to invest?

916
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,111
No...

917
00:54:56,133 --> 00:55:02,015
not me. but I know just
the person for that.

918
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,644
But...

919
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,445
But what?

920
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,340
You'll be asked for collateral.

921
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,599
Of course, we have no objection to that.

922
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,341
We have a necklace on us.

923
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:14,711
Was the tea too hot?

924
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:21,110
Panditji, where's
Bholi Punjaban these days?

925
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,700
What?

926
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,769
You heard right.

927
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,376
Move...

928
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:37,208
Zafar. are you crazy?

929
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,712
What have they brainwashed you with?

930
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,533
Don't fall into their trap.

931
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:42,673
They'd even sell their fathers.

932
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,003
Don't get into their mess.

933
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:48,544
I'm the one who is in need.
Please take us to her.

934
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:50,768
Please.

935
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:57,770
Fine...

936
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:02,340
I'll take you to her
but 10% of the deal is mine.

937
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,143
Why don't you take it all and
turn this shithole into Taj Mahal?

938
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:08,705
Panditji, who is this birdie named
Bholi Punjaban...

939
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,602
whose feathers we haven't counted?

940
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,774
Birdie?

941
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,510
That's right!

942
00:56:36,534 --> 00:56:38,104
I am a hustler.

943
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:41,773
Bholi only has an innocent sounding name.

944
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,347
The moment she speaks, it's as if
a tsunami has struck the river Yamuna.

945
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:48,599
Follow me.

946
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,275
Those deflated balloons on your roof
belong to your husband.

947
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,599
Your son stares at my chest all day...

948
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,432
with his tongue sticking out like a dog.

949
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:59,175
If you say another word,
I'll set two bulls free in your house...

950
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,111
will strip your whole
family down in public.

951
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:04,132
Oh God, she's made our lives hell here.

952
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:06,766
I think it's better to sell this house
and move away.

953
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:09,509
Fall prey to Bholi's abuses and...

954
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:14,779
your soul won't find a
hole to escape the body!

955
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:16,533
Put Jagbir on the job...

956
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,445
make sure they leave the house.

957
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:19,433
Yes, madam.

958
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:23,780
Bholi has got her hands
in every illegal business.

959
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:26,532
Yes? Hello?

960
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:27,375
Are you done'?

961
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,781
How many parties?

962
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,273
Madam, two parties have
deposited 50,000 each.

963
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:35,347
More, more, call more or...

964
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,599
I'll make you dance until you're sore.

965
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,340
Yes, madam.

966
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:42,044
Mention Bholi's name
and politicians tremble in fear...

967
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,013
and the biggest of stars wet their pants.

968
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:48,207
Hello beauties,
did you get the payment?

969
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,109
No, madam.

970
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:52,499
He said he is the minister's P.A.
and he won't pay ever again.

971
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,207
Is that so? Dial him for me.

972
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,433
Hi. good afternoon.

973
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,380
I'm John Miller.
Calling you from London and...

974
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:01,499
I'm glad to inform you that...

975
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,777
your email account has won
500,000 British Pounds.

976
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:05,599
Hello?

977
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,103
Say hello to your mom!

978
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:11,342
You may be the Minister's PA but
I don't give a damn.

979
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:12,441
Bholi...

980
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:15,266
you are going too far!

981
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:17,144
You won't get the payment.

982
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,273
Listen. the minister is in
a good mood today...

983
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:24,044
send some college girls over
to his farm house.

984
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,266
If the minister is in a good mood.
Why don't you please him?

985
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:28,433
I'll send over some hot oil.

986
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:29,344
Get it?

987
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,499
First payment, then enjoyment.

988
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,535
Now hang up!

989
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:34,669
Here.

990
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:39,311
Bholi Punjaban isn't any little birdie,
she's a hawk.

991
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,173
The last nail in the coffin.

992
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:49,643
Ah!

993
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:52,170
Pandit, what a surprise!

994
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,766
Haven't seen you in a while.

995
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:56,807
Hope you're not suffering
from some secret disease.

996
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,146
Of course not. Bholiji.

997
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:05,180
Actually, these days my wife
showers me with lot of love...

998
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,111
so I didn't feel the need to drop by.

999
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:09,379
So then, are you looking to adopt a girl?

1000
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:10,606
Not at all.

1001
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,646
These boys here have
an investment scheme.

1002
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:14,475
Really?

1003
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,633
I thought they're here to
propose marriage to me.

1004
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:21,999
Listen. I don't deal with insurance agents
and bankers anymore.

1005
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,274
They are not those guys...

1006
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,304
Panditji, let it be.
I'll take over from here.

1007
00:59:27,434 --> 00:59:30,108
Madam, I am Hunny
and this here is Choocha.

1008
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:32,438
What?

1009
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,800
Dalip.

1010
00:59:35,434 --> 00:59:36,606
No, the other one?

1011
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:40,338
Choocha.

1012
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:43,268
Choocha?

1013
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:44,336
Interesting.

1014
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,666
And that's your captain?

1015
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,433
No madam, I am the captain.

1016
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:51,311
This is our coach, Zafar.

1017
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:53,669
Shoot.

1018
00:59:54,534 --> 00:59:55,766
The thing is...

1019
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:58,043
our friend Choocha here
has a God given gift.

1020
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,299
He has a dream every night.

1021
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:05,300
The next morning I use my God given gift to
break that dream down to a lottery number.

1022
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,633
We buy a lottery of that number,
the number is drawn and...

1023
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,113
we win, as simple as that.

1024
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:14,442
Are you done'?

1025
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,205
No madam, not yet.

1026
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,145
So madam, here's how it works...

1027
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:30,299
when we play 220 rupees, we win 2,000.

1028
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,333
When we play 2.200.
We win 20,000.

1029
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:37,766
If we play 220,000,
we will win 2 million!

1030
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:42,045
If you can lend us that 220.000.
We'll split the jackpot.

1031
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,044
Moreover, you can have 250,000
from our share...

1032
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,333
as an advance payment
towards the leaked question papers.

1033
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,494
So, how do you like the plan?

1034
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,678
I've come across a lot of
salesmen in my life...

1035
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:56,110
but never one who sells dreams.

1036
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:57,199
Trust me. madam.

1037
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,599
Every time Choocha has
a dream we hit the jackpot.

1038
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,772
You can check.

1039
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,444
Even if I believe in what
you'vejust said...

1040
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:09,766
what do you have as
collateral for my investment?

1041
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,441
Bholiji, they have a necklace.

1042
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:14,170
Do you?

1043
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,712
Bloody worthless freeloader...

1044
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:31,179
trying to pawn me
a fake necklace.

1045
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:33,506
Disgusting!

1046
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,266
How would I know?

1047
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:39,499
Ever since I was a child,
my mom would wear this for functions...

1048
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,312
and tell everyone.
'look at my expensive necklace'.

1049
01:01:43,334 --> 01:01:45,041
I did not know, I swear on her.

1050
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:45,466
Great!

1051
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:47,699
Like mother. like son.
What a fraud family.

1052
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,373
Now get lost.

1053
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:51,607
Bunch of losers.

1054
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:54,675
What if I give you something
as collateral?

1055
01:01:57,767 --> 01:02:01,146
What the hell is happening here. Pandit?

1056
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,276
You brought an entire gang?

1057
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,766
Planning to get me busted?

1058
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:05,768
Ne, Bholiji...

1059
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,766
he had no idea
I was following them.

1060
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,610
I came because
I need the money too.

1061
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,999
If its okay,
I can get something for collateral.

1062
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,709
You can shove all your
collaterals up your behind!

1063
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,680
I will only invest for
something substantial.

1064
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,644
How about the deeds to my shop?

1065
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:26,112
Which shop?

1066
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:28,141
Billa Sweet Shop.

1067
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:32,209
You are Billa's son?

1068
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,610
Yes, you know my dad?

1069
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:40,278
Yes, very well.

1070
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:50,477
Alright, see you tomorrow with the deed
and the lottery number.

1071
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,774
Thank you, Bholiji.

1072
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:58,771
Get one thing inside
your tiny little brains.

1073
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,533
If my money goes down the drain...

1074
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,275
I'll take back twice as much.

1075
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,599
If that sounds good, come back tomorrow.

1076
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,012
Otherwise. eat, drink and make merry.

1077
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:15,305
I'm thinking, if we
double the investment...

1078
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,099
we'll get 4 million,
instead of 2.

1079
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,511
Two for us and two for Bholi.

1080
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,599
Don't be greedy, Hunny.

1081
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,638
It's a sure thing and we won't have
to go to her every time.

1082
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,199
You think Bholi will agree?

1083
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,680
Without a doubt!

1084
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:29,766
So, even I will get 500,000 instead
of 250,000.

1085
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:32,043
Yes, everyone will get 500.000.

1086
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,007
Okay-

1087
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:40,099
Wonderful!

1088
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,699
I do all the hard work
and everyone else has all the fun.

1089
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,475
You haven't slept yet?

1090
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,343
Dude, I don't see your chole-bhatura
working on him.

1091
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,638
The chole-bhatura from our sweet shop
could knock a horse out.

1092
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,475
Dude, how's the lassi?

1093
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,376
Wait a minute.

1094
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:02,633
I hope he doesn't get knocked out so badly
that he doesn't remember the dream.

1095
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:05,699
Don't worry. I've added a lot
of almonds in the lassi.

1096
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,441
Watch how it makes his brain run.

1097
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:14,346
Superb lassi, man.
Well done, Billa!

1098
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:23,266
Now come on Choocha, go to sleep and
dream something nice and crispy.

1099
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:27,147
Don't worry brother,
you'll be served something incredible.

1100
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,466
Hunny. as soon as we get the money
I want to buy a pair of jeans.

1101
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:40,633
The kind that are ripped at the knees,
like Salman Khan wears.

1102
01:04:40,634 --> 01:04:43,114
And Fila shoes, with red soles.

1103
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:47,612
Okay. I'll sleep.

1104
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,340
No, notjeans...

1105
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:59,444
I'll buy cargo pants
with multiple pockets.

1106
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:01,633
And in every pocket bundles
of 100 rupee notes.

1107
01:05:01,634 --> 01:05:05,047
We'll spend like crazy
and have butter chicken every day!

1108
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:07,037
Good night.

1109
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,310
Hunny. can you come up on the bed'?

1110
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:30,171
I don't like it all alone.

1111
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:02,999
I just can't fall asleep.

1112
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,480
Idiot, do you want to suck
on my thumb now'??

1113
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,501
Go to sleep!

1114
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,608
You are excited, aren't you?

1115
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:14,043
I'll play a nice tune,
it'll help you relax.

1116
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,533
That sounds good.

1117
01:06:15,534 --> 01:06:19,107
Hunny. meanwhile, why don't you
give me a nice head massage.

1118
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,774
It feels really good
and will help me fall asleep.

1119
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,609
My legs are aching after standing
at Bholi's place for hours.

1120
01:06:52,434 --> 01:06:53,777
No Lali. you don't have to...

1121
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,477
but okay... if you insist.

1122
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:01,136
Feels so good...

1123
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:04,288
Can you turn off the lights?

1124
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:18,109
Turn off the lights,
I just can't find sleep.

1125
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:24,674
You won't find sleep
even if you turn off the lights

1126
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:34,453
When will I find a beauty
to turn off the lights for me?

1127
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:44,200
Go off to sleep Choocha,
or else Bholi will wake up.

1128
01:09:24,267 --> 01:09:25,302
I won't spare you.

1129
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:26,142
Get away.

1130
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:30,274
<i>Here... Wham... ham'.!</i>

1131
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,600
Choocha...

1132
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,305
Choocha...

1133
01:09:36,267 --> 01:09:37,007
Hey!

1134
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:38,533
Choocha...

1135
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:40,139
Wake up.

1136
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,204
What happened?

1137
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,042
Come on, out with the golden egg.

1138
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:00,637
Why are you all staring '?

1139
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:02,169
Hurry up or I'll punch you.

1140
01:10:02,534 --> 01:10:06,107
Dude, you know
I don't remember it easily.

1141
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,444
Give me a minute.

1142
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:10,505
Choocha. come on.

1143
01:10:13,434 --> 01:10:15,471
Yes, now I remember...

1144
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:18,140
I saw that...

1145
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,166
you...

1146
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,043
I'>

1147
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,372
I saw that you were...

1148
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:28,275
dead.

1149
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:31,368
Listen to me...

1150
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:36,667
I saw that you were dead
and the four legs of your bed...

1151
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,707
were slowly turning into the
four ends of your coffin.

1152
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:46,375
Then Lali, Zafar and Panditji and I..

1153
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:49,643
Carry your coffin
to the crematorium.

1154
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:53,011
As I am about to light the pyre...

1155
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:57,039
your butt catches fire.
You wake up with a jolt and...

1156
01:10:57,334 --> 01:10:59,433
start running towards thejungle.

1157
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:02,176
And you run into...

1158
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:05,610
none other than Bholi Punjaban!

1159
01:11:05,634 --> 01:11:10,276
Who transforms into a lion
and swallows you.

1160
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,166
As soon as I reach there...

1161
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:17,616
I shove my hand in Bholi's mouth,
who is now a lion...

1162
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:19,204
and pull you out.

1163
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,137
Your butt's still ablaze.

1164
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:28,313
Anyway, I get furious,
I walk up to Bholi...

1165
01:11:28,334 --> 01:11:33,334
look her straight in the eye and
tear her face in two.

1166
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:35,999
One part I throw east, the other west.

1167
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,500
Knockout!

1168
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:49,514
Four legs of a bed. four ends of a coffin,
four shoulders...

1169
01:11:50,334 --> 01:11:52,143
the number is definitely four!

1170
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,546
A burning pyre'?

1171
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:59,447
Pyre...

1172
01:12:00,634 --> 01:12:03,513
pyre comes from fire...

1173
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:06,266
So it's the Goddess of fire. Ma Jwala.

1174
01:12:06,267 --> 01:12:07,177
And?

1175
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,110
Dude, the...

1176
01:12:09,134 --> 01:12:10,204
Lion!

1177
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:15,344
Lion is what the Goddess Vaishno rides on.

1178
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:18,008
So, we're sure about the Goddess.

1179
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,774
Goddess Vaishno is
also known as...

1180
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:24,344
Durga.

1181
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:27,273
So it's number four on Jai Durga.

1182
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:29,774
Come. it's time to party with Bholi.

1183
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:32,276
What about your burning butt though?

1184
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,169
Listen. you minister's pet.

1185
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,666
Get this once and for all!

1186
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:41,766
First you make the payment,
then you get the delivery.

1187
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:42,609
Got it?

1188
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:43,633
If you haven't...

1189
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:46,547
come here and I'll make sure
you get it.

1190
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,669
Bye!

1191
01:13:00,434 --> 01:13:02,641
I didn't think you'd turn up.

1192
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,133
Well, here we are...
loaded with ammunition.

1193
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:04,771
Just say fire.

1194
01:13:05,434 --> 01:13:07,466
You have a way with words. I must say.

1195
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:08,766
Out with the name and number.

1196
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:11,133
Sure, but I have something
else to tell you.

1197
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:14,199
You see, the jackpot amount is not nearly
enough now that the partners have increased.

1198
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,545
I was wondering if you would
invest 440,000 instead of 220,000.

1199
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,341
The profit doubles
and everyone is happy.

1200
01:13:19,367 --> 01:13:20,166
What do you say?

1201
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,441
Unbelievable!

1202
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,166
Trying to sell me another deal!

1203
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,168
Fine.

1204
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:29,013
I'm ready to play any amount
you want me to!

1205
01:13:29,434 --> 01:13:33,041
But hear me out once again...

1206
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,445
If my money goes down the drain...

1207
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:39,176
I'll shove my hand up your behind
and grab twice as much.

1208
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,137
Still want me to raise the investment?

1209
01:13:43,267 --> 01:13:43,711
No...

1210
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:46,179
Bholiji, 440.000 is good.

1211
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:49,674
In fact. let's just stay at 220,000.

1212
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,513
Sorry madam,
let's keep that deal open for the future.

1213
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,044
Right now, let's just play 440,000
on Jai Durga number four.

1214
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:13,711
Listen Damroo, bet 440,000
on Jai Durga number four, for me.

1215
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,333
Yeah, today's draw.

1216
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:17,109
Call me as soon as the number is out.

1217
01:15:12,434 --> 01:15:13,276
<i>Te“ me, Damvoo'.!</i>

1218
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,604
Okay-

1219
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:52,475
Yes?

1220
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:55,641
Who wants to go first?

1221
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:01,637
Madam, trust me,
I've never gone wrong with my formula.

1222
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:04,166
Perhaps he said four
and you misheard it.

1223
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,510
Why don't you check again?

1224
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:08,666
Why don't I shove the phone
down your throat, you smartass'?

1225
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:10,544
That way you can keep dialling.

1226
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,305
Get it?

1227
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,599
Bholiji, what about my shop deeds?

1228
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,442
Shut up!

1229
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,610
Coach, you better control your team!

1230
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,171
Yes?
How do I get back my money?

1231
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:31,133
Don't whisper in his ear.

1232
01:16:31,134 --> 01:16:32,204
Speak up, loud and clear.

1233
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,000
Madamji, I told...

1234
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:34,502
Shh!

1235
01:16:35,434 --> 01:16:38,766
Madamji, I told him that we
should work out installments.

1236
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:41,179
We'll pay back a little every month.

1237
01:16:42,434 --> 01:16:43,344
Why not?

1238
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,199
I'll come up with an EMI scheme.
Just for you.

1239
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,113
On this note slap yourself real hard.

1240
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,308
<i>Why'?</i>

1241
01:16:51,501 --> 01:16:53,666
Slap yourself or he will do it.

1242
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:56,477
I'll do it. don't bother him.

1243
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:00,110
Harder.

1244
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,670
<i>HEY"</i>

1245
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:06,166
Is that good?

1246
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,339
Happy?

1247
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:16,433
And you, Billals little puppy,
should I call him?

1248
01:17:16,434 --> 01:17:19,108
No, please don't call dad.

1249
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,374
Well then,
tell me how you intend to pay me back.

1250
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,374
We don't have the money.

1251
01:17:24,134 --> 01:17:27,047
If we had,
we wouldn't have come to you.

1252
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,274
We needed the money to get into college

1253
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,345
But here you need the money to get out.

1254
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:43,041
In that case, why don't you tell us
what to do'?

1255
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,540
As he said, we don't have the money.

1256
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:09,707
I just have one way out for you.

1257
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:15,141
There's a rave party tonight
at the Faridabad-Gurgaon border.

1258
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,478
And this is what you'll have to do.

1259
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,670
I'll give you some pills that
you have to sell there.

1260
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:26,441
Each pill is for 3,000 rupees.

1261
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:28,113
And you'll have 500 such pills.

1262
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,713
You think it'll sell at that price?

1263
01:18:34,434 --> 01:18:36,277
Like hot cakes!

1264
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,045
It will be teeming with
the rich and wealthy.

1265
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,180
$0?

1266
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,043
Alright madam, we will do it.

1267
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,105
Do you know what those pills are?

1268
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,339
Whatever they are,
we have to sell them.

1269
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:03,766
I don't think Bholi is ready
to negotiate.

1270
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:05,371
It's an order, not a request.

1271
01:19:05,434 --> 01:19:06,999
How will you sell the pills?

1272
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,445
Just like you sell samosas at your shop.

1273
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,544
Hunny. tell him to shut up.

1274
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,013
Relax! Even I am afraid.

1275
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:17,174
But shedding tears or raising your voice
won't get you anywhere with Bholi.

1276
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,045
Let me know if you have another option.

1277
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,540
Dude, which of these is the door?

1278
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:29,041
Move out!

1279
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:33,547
500 pills and no
hanky-panky with the money, okay?

1280
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,305
Chooch!

1281
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,169
You're staying with me.

1282
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,601
I knew it!

1283
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:49,274
Looking at the love for me in your eyes,
I didn't want to leave.

1284
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,599
Let them go.

1285
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,443
In fact.
Even the Chicago Bulls should go.

1286
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:58,308
My stories will make you fall
head over heels in love with me.

1287
01:19:58,334 --> 01:20:00,644
Go on. I'll be fine.

1288
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,273
In my 30 years on earth
and 16 year career...

1289
01:20:04,301 --> 01:20:08,600
no one has ever
yapped such bullshit around me.

1290
01:20:08,601 --> 01:20:09,999
I really don't get you.

1291
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,536
Who do you think you are?

1292
01:20:11,601 --> 01:20:13,774
Talking rubbish all the time!

1293
01:20:16,267 --> 01:20:18,508
You can leave, he remains here.

1294
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:21,166
Another thing...

1295
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,544
if you get into any trouble...

1296
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,511
I don't know you and you don't know me.

1297
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,605
All I care about is my money.

1298
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:30,146
Otherwise you'll be joining
my handicapped army.

1299
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:35,377
Get it?

1300
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:36,609
Now leave!

1301
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:39,133
Lali...

1302
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:43,276
why don't you give me your phone,
that way I can stay in touch.

1303
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,214
I mean, you shouldn't think I'm ignoring
you guys just because I'm with a girl.

1304
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:06,600
Priya...

1305
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,670
Yeah?
What do you want'?

1306
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:13,099
Can't I call you?

1307
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,603
Hurry up, I need to study
for the exams.

1308
01:21:17,767 --> 01:21:19,269
Here.

1309
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,510
What's this?

1310
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:23,446
The latest chartbusters.

1311
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:25,610
Why are you giving this to me?

1312
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:27,433
It's a gift, just take it.

1313
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:28,777
But why?

1314
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,766
Listen. there's a fabulous
party happening in Gurgaon later.

1315
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:34,099
And you're coming with me.

1316
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,306
Have you lost your mind?

1317
01:21:35,334 --> 01:21:37,100
There are still three days
to go for the exams.

1318
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,433
And anyway, I'll give you the
question paper the day before.

1319
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:40,311
You can easily learn the answers.

1320
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:44,670
I don't want your CD,
I don't want the papers...

1321
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,340
and I don't want to
go to the party either!

1322
01:21:47,367 --> 01:21:49,711
Why don't you take your
girlfriend with you?

1323
01:21:50,267 --> 01:21:51,337
Well...

1324
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,278
we broke up today.

1325
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:57,713
What do you mean, broke up'?

1326
01:21:58,467 --> 01:22:00,447
What's it to you?

1327
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:03,106
Are you thinking of me as
your boyfriend?

1328
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:04,699
What nonsense!

1329
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,600
It's not like you've
said 'l love you' to me.

1330
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:09,775
If I do. will you reconsider?

1331
01:22:11,434 --> 01:22:12,640
Go away.

1332
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,274
Not fair.

1333
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:18,599
I thought I'd take you along
and we'd have a great time.

1334
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,699
I had such a tough time
convincing my friends about you.

1335
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,304
And now you're playing hard to get.

1336
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:26,533
We're gentlemen,
I'll bring you back home safe?

1337
01:22:26,534 --> 01:22:29,378
Don't complain later that
you couldn't attend the party.

1338
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,166
What excuse do I give at home?

1339
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:33,475
Make up anything.

1340
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,741
Say you are staying over
at your friend's place to study.

1341
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:42,278
Fine, I'll come along.

1342
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:44,766
Pick me up from outside the Jain temple.

1343
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:47,166
Great, I'll pick you up at 9pm.

1344
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:50,046
And no salwar-kameez, okay?

1345
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,177
You should look hot.

1346
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:57,111
Priya!

1347
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:01,606
I love you.

1348
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:17,208
What's the big deal about this pill
that it costs 3,000 rupees?

1349
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:21,545
For that amount.
I could get a month's groceries...

1350
01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:24,607
or pay ten years of school fees...

1351
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:27,045
or buy ten pairs of jeans...

1352
01:23:27,634 --> 01:23:30,114
And this one pill is worth so much?

1353
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:33,200
There's definitely a big deal,
got to figure this thing out.

1354
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:35,266
Hunny. stop talking nonsense!

1355
01:23:35,267 --> 01:23:37,474
Each pill is accounted for.

1356
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,377
Don't create another mess.

1357
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:41,100
As it is, you've brought a girl along.

1358
01:23:41,101 --> 01:23:43,638
Will you stop with the sermon!

1359
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:45,305
Have you ever been to a party?

1360
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:47,610
Stags like us are not allowed in.

1361
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:50,103
But a girl helps open doors.

1362
01:23:58,434 --> 01:23:59,499
Look...

1363
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,774
here comes our passport.

1364
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:00,013
<i>I must say...</i>

1365
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,638
there's something amusing about you.

1366
01:25:03,767 --> 01:25:06,099
What's with your dreams?

1367
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,603
There's a very long story to it.

1368
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:12,275
I'd like to hear it.

1369
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:16,178
If you say so.

1370
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:22,344
Madam, it begins more than 20 million
years ago, when I was a little boy...

1371
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,700
Hold on!

1372
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,339
How many years ago?

1373
01:25:25,367 --> 01:25:28,600
Were your ancestors even born back then?

1374
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,100
This isn't right.

1375
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:34,049
Just because I love you
doesn't mean you can interrupt me.

1376
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,377
This is howl narrate my story
and it begins 20 million years ago.

1377
01:25:37,434 --> 01:25:39,641
You either hear the story
or pass me that plate.

1378
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:41,373
I'm sorry.

1379
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:44,466
Narrate it the way you want, alright?

1380
01:25:44,467 --> 01:25:45,605
Shoot!

1381
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:51,180
It begins 20 billion years ago...

1382
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,378
It's all good now?

1383
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:12,371
I'm here, and so is my friend

1384
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,442
It's all good now?

1385
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:17,200
I'm here, and so is my friend

1386
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:19,477
And an evening of great fun

1387
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:23,033
The chance is good, have fun

1388
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:26,379
Make the most of this

1389
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:29,766
The chance is good, have fun

1390
01:27:29,767 --> 01:27:33,271
Make the most of this

1391
01:27:34,434 --> 01:27:37,599
And that's when Chacha
Nehru called me from the moon...

1392
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,000
and I said. "Yes, Choocha speaking.“

1393
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:40,922
So Chacha Nehru said...

1394
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,106
Who knew the world could be spirited

1395
01:27:58,434 --> 01:28:01,533
With dance and music,
with rhythm and clapping

1396
01:28:01,534 --> 01:28:05,133
That I would get both love and money

1397
01:28:05,134 --> 01:28:08,433
I was ruined till now,
now I'll have every joy.

1398
01:28:08,434 --> 01:28:10,471
With a click

1399
01:28:12,134 --> 01:28:15,445
With a click I could get
all my heart desires

1400
01:28:15,467 --> 01:28:18,380
Now we can have chicken
for two meals everyday.

1401
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,378
It's all good now?

1402
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:24,371
I'm here, and so is my friend

1403
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,442
It's all good now?

1404
01:28:27,467 --> 01:28:29,199
I'm here, and so is my friend

1405
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,476
And an evening of great fun

1406
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,033
The chance is good, have fun

1407
01:28:35,034 --> 01:28:38,379
Make the most of this

1408
01:28:38,434 --> 01:28:41,766
The chance is good, have fun

1409
01:28:41,767 --> 01:28:45,271
Make the most of this

1410
01:28:56,601 --> 01:29:00,133
Ignore the words of the sane

1411
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:03,433
Darling, why not speak the words of love?

1412
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:06,766
If you ever want to go shopping.
Come here

1413
01:29:06,767 --> 01:29:10,199
I've set up a shop of dreams in my eyes

1414
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,510
lam putting my heart up for sale

1415
01:29:13,701 --> 01:29:17,166
lam putting my heart up
for sale at half the rate

1416
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:20,512
I've split my head banging
it on your door

1417
01:29:20,534 --> 01:29:23,140
It's all good now?

1418
01:29:24,101 --> 01:29:26,103
I'm here, and so is my friend

1419
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:29,166
It's all good now?

1420
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:30,766
I'm here, and so is my friend

1421
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:33,199
And an evening of great fun

1422
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,545
The chance is good, have fun

1423
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,133
Make the most of this

1424
01:29:40,134 --> 01:29:43,445
The chance is good, have fun

1425
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:47,040
Make the most of this

1426
01:30:35,467 --> 01:30:36,172
Catch him.

1427
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:39,166
Leave him, Go after that guy!

1428
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:39,508
Quickly.

1429
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:40,308
Catch him.

1430
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:25,372
Priya...

1431
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:29,504
are you my girlfriend?

1432
01:31:35,134 --> 01:31:36,169
Answer me...

1433
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:40,308
I even said 'I love you'.

1434
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:43,042
<i>P ﬂy a”;?</i>

1435
01:31:44,434 --> 01:31:45,433
Talk to me.

1436
01:31:45,434 --> 01:31:48,133
Remember what you said on the roof?

1437
01:31:48,134 --> 01:31:50,136
Sir, there's no one else around here.

1438
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:53,043
Let's go.

1439
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:09,606
<i>P ﬂy a”;?</i>

1440
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:11,601
Priya...

1441
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:16,105
What do you think of yourself?

1442
01:32:16,367 --> 01:32:19,314
What's wrong?
What did I do?

1443
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:21,200
What did you do?

1444
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:24,011
You lied and brought me to
a party of drug addicts.

1445
01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:26,480
Right now you tried to
take advantage of me.

1446
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:28,105
Yet you're asking what you did!

1447
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,344
I was stupid, I got carried away...

1448
01:32:33,034 --> 01:32:35,776
I thought you really liked me.

1449
01:32:36,434 --> 01:32:40,466
I always believed there was
some innocence behind your pranks.

1450
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:43,710
I considered you a good person,
but your intentions are pure evil.

1451
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,533
That's not true, Priya...

1452
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:47,099
I really like you.

1453
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,272
Don't you touch me!

1454
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:51,477
You are a no-good scoundrel.

1455
01:32:51,501 --> 01:32:52,605
A Pest!

1456
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:56,705
Never show your face again.

1457
01:33:09,434 --> 01:33:11,471
Sir, he seems to be a pro at racing.

1458
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:13,772
But his motorcycle is his downfall.

1459
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:15,647
It's thumping roar will give it away.

1460
01:33:57,601 --> 01:33:59,012
Do you know Neetu?

1461
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,510
Tell me, how do you know her?

1462
01:34:01,534 --> 01:34:03,533
Don't answer my question
with a question.

1463
01:34:03,534 --> 01:34:05,166
How do you know Neetu'?

1464
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:05,770
Who is it?

1465
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,671
- Zafar.
- Lali.

1466
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:18,339
What's the meaning of this?

1467
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,108
And at this late hour?

1468
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:24,105
Ma'am, I'll explain everything.
But first please hide this somewhere.

1469
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:25,509
What's in it?

1470
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,433
Ma'am, it has...

1471
01:34:27,434 --> 01:34:28,599
Neetu, it's drugs.

1472
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,513
The cops are after us.
Please hide this somewhere.

1473
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,445
Yes, ma'am. please.

1474
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:35,707
Ma'am, please...

1475
01:34:37,634 --> 01:34:38,510
Ma'am, please...

1476
01:34:51,767 --> 01:34:52,609
Where's the packet?

1477
01:34:52,634 --> 01:34:54,033
Sir... what packet'?

1478
01:34:54,034 --> 01:34:55,377
I don't understand...

1479
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,442
Now do you?

1480
01:34:58,034 --> 01:34:59,342
Where did you hide the packet?

1481
01:34:59,367 --> 01:35:02,666
Sir, sorry, I was afraid and
that's why I lied.

1482
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,476
Tell me, where is the packet?

1483
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,533
Sir, it fell somewhere in the commotion.

1484
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,376
I swear.

1485
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:08,469
Check the place.

1486
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,766
Sir, why are you asking
about the packet?

1487
01:35:11,767 --> 01:35:14,043
You don't know why I'm asking?

1488
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:14,766
Smartass...

1489
01:35:14,767 --> 01:35:15,643
Sir... you...

1490
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:17,600
Hold that thought.
I'll be right with you.

1491
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:18,266
Answer me.

1492
01:35:18,267 --> 01:35:22,181
Sir, the packet you're talking about probably
contains take away menu's of his restaurant.

1493
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,373
Which he is saying he dropped somewhere.

1494
01:35:24,434 --> 01:35:25,344
Yes, sir.

1495
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:28,208
Are you his counsel?

1496
01:35:29,434 --> 01:35:32,176
Then you must be knowing
the colour of his underwear too.

1497
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:34,337
Isn't it?

1498
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,278
So, tell me. what was on
the menu besides marijuana?

1499
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:44,300
Sir, I don't even drink dark chocolate,
let alone do drugs.

1500
01:35:44,334 --> 01:35:46,336
You can test if you want.

1501
01:35:46,367 --> 01:35:50,500
Sir, I have a catering business, thought
I'd fetch some orders for future parties.

1502
01:35:50,501 --> 01:35:53,277
And right now there aren't too
many weddings taking place.

1503
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:57,112
If you were innocent,
why did you run?

1504
01:35:57,534 --> 01:36:00,344
Sir, as soon as I got there,
it was chaos.

1505
01:36:00,367 --> 01:36:04,199
People were screaming, 'run,
the cops are here!'

1506
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,611
And so I ran.

1507
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:09,548
My dad always says, 'stay away
from cops and thugs'.

1508
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,511
They're two sides of the same coin.'

1509
01:36:11,534 --> 01:36:15,141
I don't know about thugs, but you
should definitely stay away from cops.

1510
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,433
Come on.

1511
01:36:16,434 --> 01:36:19,033
Narrate the rest of your story
at the police station.

1512
01:36:19,034 --> 01:36:20,166
And call your old wise man too.

1513
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:20,599
Sir... no, sir.

1514
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,374
Did you find it'?

1515
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,443
Excuse me. who are you?

1516
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:25,771
How did you just barge in to my house?

1517
01:36:26,434 --> 01:36:29,608
He will tell you, who I am.
Just showed him my ID.

1518
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:33,210
He made us run after him like dogs
for 45 minutes.

1519
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:36,139
There's nothing here, sir.

1520
01:36:36,534 --> 01:36:37,699
What's the meaning of this?

1521
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,475
How can you search
without a warrant?

1522
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:41,339
How do you know them?

1523
01:36:41,367 --> 01:36:43,266
I am Neetu, and this is Lali, my student.

1524
01:36:43,267 --> 01:36:44,769
He takes tuitions from me.

1525
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,276
And this is my fiance, Zafar.

1526
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:52,610
You give tuitions at this hour?

1527
01:36:53,767 --> 01:36:55,678
Listen. I too have graduated.

1528
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:58,181
I've been a student and a teacher.

1529
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,511
And I've been engaged quite a few times.

1530
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,999
You're fortunate that
we didn't get the packet.

1531
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,166
But don't think you are free.

1532
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:09,478
Come and see me
at the police station tomorrow.

1533
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,035
Get it?

1534
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:12,136
Let's go.

1535
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:21,008
What is it that you're studying. anyway?

1536
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:22,766
Sir...

1537
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:25,000
Debit what comes in...

1538
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:26,708
credit what goes out.

1539
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:47,175
I can't believe you could
stoop so low.

1540
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:50,709
Ma'am, how do you know Zafar'?

1541
01:37:51,434 --> 01:37:53,100
I'll deal with you later.

1542
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:55,012
Sit over there.

1543
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:58,347
And you, cat got your tongue?
Speak up.

1544
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:01,775
No matter what I say,
you won't believe it.

1545
01:38:03,034 --> 01:38:04,206
How nice, Zafar!

1546
01:38:05,334 --> 01:38:07,109
Why did you ever walk into my life?

1547
01:38:07,334 --> 01:38:09,433
You've messed up
my peaceful existence.

1548
01:38:09,434 --> 01:38:11,710
You're neither with me
nor have you let me go.

1549
01:38:12,501 --> 01:38:14,105
And your ego!

1550
01:38:14,634 --> 01:38:17,478
You could have told me,
at least said a word.

1551
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,766
You can apologise a million times...

1552
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:21,270
but couldn't share your
problem with me?

1553
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,306
Excuse me. ma'am!

1554
01:38:24,334 --> 01:38:28,510
Ma'am, please tell me
where you hid the packet.

1555
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:30,099
Have you completely lost it. Lali?

1556
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,545
You still want the packet?

1557
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,760
I flushed it down the toilet.

1558
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,500
What?

1559
01:38:36,167 --> 01:38:37,646
You flushed it?

1560
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:39,544
Have you lost your mind?

1561
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:41,266
Do you know what you've done?

1562
01:38:41,267 --> 01:38:42,439
Lali. behave yourself!

1563
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:44,708
Behave myself?

1564
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:47,543
You flushed 1.5 million rupees!

1565
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,513
And with it my shop's deed.

1566
01:38:50,534 --> 01:38:52,445
Did you give it any thought?

1567
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,480
You already seem to have a thing for Zafar.

1568
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:58,547
Why didn't you tell me you
are his girlfriend?

1569
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:00,444
You betrayed me!

1570
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:01,466
What rubbish, Lali?

1571
01:39:01,467 --> 01:39:02,599
How did I betray you?

1572
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:07,606
When a crumb was stuck
in my moustache, didn't you brush it off'?

1573
01:39:08,201 --> 01:39:10,772
Didn't you rest your hand on my shoulder,
while riding with me on the bike?

1574
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:14,608
Didn't you want Shalu and me to break up,
so something could start between us?

1575
01:39:15,334 --> 01:39:17,666
Why did you do those things
if you didn't like me'?

1576
01:39:17,667 --> 01:39:18,766
Oh God!

1577
01:39:18,767 --> 01:39:21,033
I didn't know you were such a fool!

1578
01:39:21,034 --> 01:39:22,377
I didn't betray you.

1579
01:39:22,434 --> 01:39:23,606
Idiot!

1580
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,013
Can I use your phone?

1581
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:45,276
Please?

1582
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,146
Yes, Choocha speaking.

1583
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:09,099
Choocha. we're in a terrible mess.

1584
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,133
What did you say?

1585
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:10,612
Choocha?

1586
01:40:10,634 --> 01:40:11,766
Give me the phone.

1587
01:40:11,767 --> 01:40:12,766
Who is this?

1588
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:14,166
Listen Choocha or whoever you are...

1589
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:15,646
don't you drag them into any mess,
get it?

1590
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:16,766
Hello. madam...

1591
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:19,373
how dare you call me Choocha.
Do you even know me?

1592
01:40:19,434 --> 01:40:21,166
Listen. it's me, Lali.

1593
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:23,647
Lali or lollypop,
don't you call me Choocha!

1594
01:40:23,667 --> 01:40:26,166
And why are you talking in
a girl's voice?

1595
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:28,443
That's not me,
that was Neetu madam.

1596
01:40:29,301 --> 01:40:33,215
Oh I see.
It's a cross connection.

1597
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:35,700
Hang up and call me again.

1598
01:40:35,701 --> 01:40:36,475
Hello?

1599
01:40:44,767 --> 01:40:46,678
Yes, Choocha speaking.

1600
01:40:47,034 --> 01:40:49,199
Listen. it's all over.

1601
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,679
We have no idea where
Hunny and Priya are.

1602
01:40:50,701 --> 01:40:53,272
And we've also lost the pills.

1603
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:56,766
All I can say is
we were saved by a whisker!

1604
01:40:56,767 --> 01:40:59,441
I suggest you escape too.
And I mean it.

1605
01:41:00,034 --> 01:41:00,774
Do you hear me'?

1606
01:41:01,434 --> 01:41:03,710
Hello?

1607
01:41:06,034 --> 01:41:06,671
Hello?

1608
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,146
Yes Khanna. did you raid the party'?

1609
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:38,011
Yes, but the narcotics
squad was also there.

1610
01:41:38,334 --> 01:41:39,766
Whom did you send
this time with the pills?

1611
01:41:39,767 --> 01:41:41,144
He escaped with it.

1612
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,100
Escaped?

1613
01:41:43,101 --> 01:41:44,512
Bloody government mongrel!

1614
01:41:44,533 --> 01:41:46,766
You aren't there
to sniff out useless things.

1615
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,474
At least once be on time.

1616
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:51,113
You ruined the entire plan, you idiot.

1617
01:41:51,667 --> 01:41:54,388
What if he comes back with the packet now?
Nothing I could do to him.

1618
01:41:54,434 --> 01:41:56,471
It's a loss... hang up now.

1619
01:42:00,367 --> 01:42:03,033
Madam, Choocha run...

1620
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,775
Then you also run, son of a gun!

1621
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:06,503
Run!

1622
01:42:06,534 --> 01:42:07,274
Yes, madam.

1623
01:42:10,467 --> 01:42:11,033
Hello?

1624
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:12,775
Dude, what have you gotten me into?

1625
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:13,999
Where's Hunny?

1626
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,766
I don't know.

1627
01:42:14,767 --> 01:42:16,266
The cops raided the place
and everyone escaped.

1628
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:18,543
And you conveniently got to a girl's place.

1629
01:42:18,601 --> 01:42:19,306
Fantastic!

1630
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,272
You got me screwed.

1631
01:42:21,434 --> 01:42:23,345
I'll come and get you.
Where are you'?

1632
01:42:23,601 --> 01:42:25,444
I'm near Yamuna market.

1633
01:42:25,467 --> 01:42:27,600
Hurry "P!

1634
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:29,774
Don't forget to get me a cola.

1635
01:42:32,634 --> 01:42:33,169
Cola?

1636
01:42:49,034 --> 01:42:49,766
Madam Bholi...

1637
01:42:49,767 --> 01:42:52,475
man on ground,
holding Bobby's balls.

1638
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,444
What to do?

1639
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,504
Break his hand and bring him fast.

1640
01:42:55,767 --> 01:42:56,609
Okay. madam.

1641
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:15,777
Yes, where are you going?

1642
01:43:19,267 --> 01:43:20,143
Where are you going?

1643
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:21,475
Stop.
Where are you going?

1644
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,376
Where are you going?

1645
01:43:50,301 --> 01:43:51,302
Cola?

1646
01:44:02,267 --> 01:44:04,372
She's not called Bholi Punjaban
for nothing.

1647
01:44:05,467 --> 01:44:07,344
Don't even think about running away.

1648
01:44:07,767 --> 01:44:11,681
Anyway, you losers won't have passports
to get out of the country...

1649
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,666
and if you hide anywhere here.
She will hunt you down.

1650
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,375
Panditji, we're not here to be insulted.

1651
01:44:18,434 --> 01:44:20,074
Tell us if you've got a solution to this.

1652
01:44:20,767 --> 01:44:22,542
You can do away with the attitude.

1653
01:44:23,467 --> 01:44:27,472
I suggest, you go to Bholi
and let her do what she wants to.

1654
01:44:27,767 --> 01:44:30,111
In that case,
should we stand straight or bend over?

1655
01:44:40,134 --> 01:44:41,340
Pandit is right.

1656
01:44:42,167 --> 01:44:43,510
Are you serious, Zafar?

1657
01:44:43,534 --> 01:44:45,199
Of course, I am...

1658
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,113
or else let me know if
you have another option.

1659
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:01,706
I knew you were a hustler
when you told me about the dream and...

1660
01:45:02,434 --> 01:45:05,108
gave me your fraud mom's fake necklace!

1661
01:45:05,334 --> 01:45:09,009
That's when I knew that
you are a pain in the butt!

1662
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:14,144
I feel like letting my men loose on you and throw
you into the Yamuna river. tied to a big rock.

1663
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,379
But if you drown.
I won't get my money back.

1664
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:21,707
Now, listen to me carefully...
last chance...

1665
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:25,506
You have 24 hours...

1666
01:45:26,467 --> 01:45:30,005
to get me back my money. 2.5 million.

1667
01:45:33,367 --> 01:45:34,999
2.5 million?

1668
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,637
Yes...

1669
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:39,209
two-point-five million.

1670
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:44,007
880,000 for the lotteries
and 1.5 for the pills.

1671
01:45:44,201 --> 01:45:47,045
Bholiji, that adds up to 2.38 million.

1672
01:45:47,101 --> 01:45:48,512
What's the extra for?

1673
01:45:48,534 --> 01:45:51,014
Bloody Einstein!

1674
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,342
The extra is for pardoning you.

1675
01:45:54,367 --> 01:45:58,372
To be honest you guys are actually
worthless but I am quite generous.

1676
01:45:59,467 --> 01:46:04,007
2.5 million or else Billa's restaurant
will be my new address.

1677
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,503
Are you sure?
You don't want me to come with you?

1678
01:46:28,434 --> 01:46:30,471
No, let it be, I'll manage.

1679
01:46:31,534 --> 01:46:37,450
The world can read the wisdom
of the texts

1680
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:43,516
and yet it won't find contentment.

1681
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:53,301
Two and a half letters ofjugaad

1682
01:46:54,434 --> 01:46:59,434
Two and a half letters ofjugaad

1683
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:07,107
If read, you will be set

1684
01:47:17,601 --> 01:47:22,099
There is fighting everywhere,
there is sorrow

1685
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,433
Become alert

1686
01:47:24,434 --> 01:47:26,766
Become alert

1687
01:47:26,767 --> 01:47:31,599
Don't go around in circles,
O innocent one

1688
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,133
Now, focus on your goal

1689
01:47:34,134 --> 01:47:36,705
Now, focus on your goal

1690
01:47:36,767 --> 01:47:41,767
Focus on the goal.
On the innocent goal. focus.

1691
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:46,433
The deadline

1692
01:47:46,434 --> 01:47:48,766
Is killing everyone

1693
01:47:48,767 --> 01:47:51,199
Even in their sleep,

1694
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,600
Everyone's running a race

1695
01:47:53,601 --> 01:47:56,100
If you want to save yourself

1696
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:58,433
If you want a future

1697
01:47:58,434 --> 01:48:00,766
From here and there, from anywhere

1698
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:02,766
Grab what you can

1699
01:48:02,767 --> 01:48:07,600
Find a fix. find a quick fix

1700
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:12,433
Find a fix. find a quick fix

1701
01:48:12,434 --> 01:48:17,266
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

1702
01:48:17,267 --> 01:48:22,114
Find a fix. find a quick fix

1703
01:48:22,367 --> 01:48:24,766
If you want to save yourself

1704
01:48:24,767 --> 01:48:27,266
If you want a future

1705
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:29,599
From here and there, from anywhere

1706
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,599
Grab what you can

1707
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:36,133
Find a fix. find a quick fix

1708
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:38,444
I don't know how we will get the money.

1709
01:48:38,467 --> 01:48:40,344
We're getting deeper into this mess.

1710
01:48:40,367 --> 01:48:43,371
I don't understand why you
didn't tell the cops everything.

1711
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:46,033
Are you kidding?

1712
01:48:46,034 --> 01:48:47,707
The cops won't believe our story.

1713
01:48:48,267 --> 01:48:51,166
They suspect us
I was the one being chased.

1714
01:48:51,167 --> 01:48:53,773
The cops could lock us up for life!

1715
01:48:54,434 --> 01:48:55,466
And...

1716
01:48:55,467 --> 01:48:57,766
if my dad hears about it.
I'm dead for sure.

1717
01:48:57,767 --> 01:48:59,678
There has to be a solution.

1718
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:02,041
Dude...

1719
01:49:04,467 --> 01:49:06,378
I wanted to tell you that...

1720
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:10,177
I had a dream last night.

1721
01:49:10,701 --> 01:49:12,305
Are you crazy?

1722
01:49:12,767 --> 01:49:15,099
Thanks to your dream we
are in this mess today.

1723
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:18,274
Despite how my dad is,
he loves the restaurant...

1724
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:21,646
and won't survive if he hears that
he has lost the restaurant to Bholi.

1725
01:49:22,601 --> 01:49:24,342
Took us for a ride... both of them.

1726
01:49:24,367 --> 01:49:27,000
Who asked you to follow
us to Bholils place?

1727
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:28,674
You came on your own
blowing your own trumpet...

1728
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:30,700
and handed over the deed to Bholi.

1729
01:49:30,701 --> 01:49:31,766
On top of that you're arguing,

1730
01:49:31,767 --> 01:49:33,000
after losing the pills.

1731
01:49:33,001 --> 01:49:34,033
Why shouldn't I'?

1732
01:49:34,034 --> 01:49:35,604
That's my shop at stake.

1733
01:49:36,434 --> 01:49:38,166
We win the lottery every time.'

1734
01:49:38,167 --> 01:49:39,111
What happened this time'?

1735
01:49:39,134 --> 01:49:40,200
I'll break your face.

1736
01:49:40,201 --> 01:49:41,100
Shut up Choocha!

1737
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:42,546
Dude... it was my mistake.

1738
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,045
We are in this mess thanks to me.

1739
01:49:46,601 --> 01:49:50,139
That night,
I couldn't sleep thinking about the riches.

1740
01:49:50,767 --> 01:49:54,112
All of you fell asleep and
I was awake all night like an owl.

1741
01:49:54,634 --> 01:49:58,446
I pretended to be asleep
next morning fearing Hunny...

1742
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:03,314
cooked up a dream
and that's why the number didn't click.

1743
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:05,166
Why didn't you open your mouth then?

1744
01:50:05,167 --> 01:50:06,703
We would've requested
Bholi for more time.

1745
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:09,304
Sorry, I was afraid.
I goofed up.

1746
01:50:09,334 --> 01:50:11,333
But this dream is real...

1747
01:50:11,334 --> 01:50:13,100
and Hunny's formula is rock solid too.

1748
01:50:13,101 --> 01:50:15,445
It's no use accepting your goof up now.

1749
01:50:15,467 --> 01:50:16,633
It's useless even if it's real.

1750
01:50:16,634 --> 01:50:18,545
It's not useless.
Hunny and I have a record.

1751
01:50:18,601 --> 01:50:20,308
If it's a record,
you can play it all you want.

1752
01:50:20,334 --> 01:50:21,633
Who will give the money?
Your pop?

1753
01:50:21,634 --> 01:50:22,433
Lali!

1754
01:50:22,434 --> 01:50:23,200
How much do you want?

1755
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:23,702
Neetu!

1756
01:50:23,768 --> 01:50:24,371
Neetu ma'am.

1757
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,266
Have you lost your mind?

1758
01:50:30,267 --> 01:50:32,440
Yesterday you were angry
at me and now you're getting into this.

1759
01:50:32,467 --> 01:50:34,700
Do you have any other option. Zafar?

1760
01:50:34,701 --> 01:50:37,033
If they are telling the truth,
perhaps it's possible that...

1761
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:39,266
If and perhaps in
the same sentence, Neetu.

1762
01:50:39,267 --> 01:50:41,304
Do I need to say anything more?

1763
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:44,543
Hunny. I've heard enough of your crap.

1764
01:50:44,601 --> 01:50:46,308
No more arguments, please.

1765
01:50:46,334 --> 01:50:51,099
Right, until yesterday all of this sounded
like music to your ears, now it's crap!

1766
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,166
Yes, we all had our needs...

1767
01:50:53,167 --> 01:50:55,204
got carried away, especially me.

1768
01:50:55,701 --> 01:50:58,375
We got greedy, took a shortcut
and got involved with a hustler.

1769
01:50:58,434 --> 01:51:00,166
Well, you suggested the hustler's name.

1770
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:01,600
Perhaps you are hand in glove with her.

1771
01:51:01,601 --> 01:51:02,699
That's enough!

1772
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:05,442
Zafar... Lali... Neetu madam...

1773
01:51:05,767 --> 01:51:07,600
for once please believe
what I'm saying.

1774
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:08,766
I swear on my mother.

1775
01:51:08,767 --> 01:51:12,010
We are failures when it comes to studies,
but never with the lottery.

1776
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,707
So, what was your dream?

1777
01:51:39,167 --> 01:51:40,009
Say it.

1778
01:51:40,034 --> 01:51:41,274
Lali. what are you doing?

1779
01:51:49,167 --> 01:51:51,340
Fine, you can do as you wish!

1780
01:51:51,367 --> 01:51:52,766
Count me out, thank you.

1781
01:51:52,767 --> 01:51:53,268
Zafa r...

1782
01:51:53,434 --> 01:51:54,435
Zafa r...

1783
01:51:54,601 --> 01:51:56,171
Zafa r...

1784
01:51:59,601 --> 01:52:00,602
Never mind him...

1785
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:04,605
you carry on.

1786
01:52:12,634 --> 01:52:15,699
Don't get angry on hearing it.

1787
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:17,433
Come on already!

1788
01:52:17,434 --> 01:52:18,378
Okay-

1789
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:25,434
I saw that, while chasing a falling kite,
a mad dog bites you.

1790
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:30,339
Then you start barking like that mad dog...

1791
01:52:30,367 --> 01:52:34,433
and go around in circles
chasing your own tail.

1792
01:52:34,434 --> 01:52:38,610
Somehow I get there and
as the mad dog jumps at you...

1793
01:52:39,034 --> 01:52:42,379
I send it flying with a kick.

1794
01:52:42,434 --> 01:52:47,611
Then I lift the other mad dog,
that is you, up in my arms...

1795
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:52,100
and in slow motion I take you
to the veterinarian.

1796
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:54,766
You take a liking to me and...

1797
01:52:54,767 --> 01:52:58,613
keep licking my face all
along the way.

1798
01:52:59,367 --> 01:53:04,367
The veterinarian pierces
you with big injections...

1799
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:08,444
transforming you into
my friend Hunny again.

1800
01:53:12,534 --> 01:53:16,266
Choocha.
You actually dream these things?

1801
01:53:16,267 --> 01:53:17,678
Or always cook them up?

1802
01:53:18,367 --> 01:53:21,200
I mean, I'm the one who's
getting screwed every time.

1803
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:23,511
Except for the last one,
all dreams are real.

1804
01:53:23,534 --> 01:53:24,672
I swear.

1805
01:53:25,134 --> 01:53:26,272
Of course.

1806
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:29,475
It's better to be hounded
by Bholi than to have a friend like you.

1807
01:53:30,634 --> 01:53:32,099
Don't say that.

1808
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,602
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1809
01:53:33,634 --> 01:53:36,547
Don't I always save you in the dreams?

1810
01:53:37,534 --> 01:53:40,606
Dude, if you're through with the reunion,
can we decode the number?

1811
01:53:49,534 --> 01:53:51,445
Number!

1812
01:53:55,134 --> 01:53:58,547
Dog...

1813
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:01,306
A dog bit...

1814
01:54:02,434 --> 01:54:03,435
with his teeth.

1815
01:54:04,167 --> 01:54:07,774
And a dog has 32 teeth.

1816
01:54:08,434 --> 01:54:10,345
3 plus 2 makes 5.

1817
01:54:10,768 --> 01:54:15,012
When a dog bites...

1818
01:54:15,434 --> 01:54:18,033
you get 14 injections.

1819
01:54:18,034 --> 01:54:20,266
1 plus 4 is also 5.

1820
01:54:20,267 --> 01:54:21,541
The number is five.

1821
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,007
What colour was the dog?

1822
01:54:29,634 --> 01:54:31,170
You or the mad dog that bit you?

1823
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:34,603
Black.

1824
01:54:38,134 --> 01:54:39,442
Black dog...

1825
01:54:43,434 --> 01:54:46,040
Black dog is...

1826
01:54:47,267 --> 01:54:48,644
Bhairo Baba's pet.

1827
01:54:48,667 --> 01:54:52,171
And Bhairo Baba's temple
is behind the old fort.

1828
01:54:52,767 --> 01:54:55,043
The old for! is in Delhi and...

1829
01:54:57,201 --> 01:54:59,613
Delhi's old name is...

1830
01:55:01,767 --> 01:55:03,474
lndraprastha.

1831
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,375
Indraprastha lottery number five!

1832
01:55:10,301 --> 01:55:12,699
We got the number,
what about the money?

1833
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,111
I can help you with some.

1834
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,599
My savings and other investments
add up to about 300,000.

1835
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:22,199
125,000 is for Zafar's dad's treatment...

1836
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,146
You can use the rest, if it helps.

1837
01:55:24,767 --> 01:55:27,611
What about Zafar?

1838
01:55:29,101 --> 01:55:30,375
Zafar is not ready to listen.

1839
01:55:39,267 --> 01:55:42,043
Well, we need more money...

1840
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:45,104
I can manage some
but we'll still fall short.

1841
01:55:45,667 --> 01:55:48,599
I will get the rest.

1842
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,433
No, Lali. your restaurant is already...

1843
01:55:50,434 --> 01:55:55,213
Precisely why I have to see this through.

1844
01:56:19,534 --> 01:56:22,276
And what plans do we have?

1845
01:56:36,434 --> 01:56:37,378
Hello?

1846
01:56:39,334 --> 01:56:40,369
Who is it?

1847
01:56:41,667 --> 01:56:43,544
My mother!

1848
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,102
Hail thee!

1849
01:56:51,767 --> 01:56:56,682
The Mother Goddess has called on me
from the temple

1850
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:07,638
Hey... you better stop laughing. okay?

1851
01:57:07,667 --> 01:57:09,766
We're artists renowned for our art.

1852
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:10,766
Our art is priceless.

1853
01:57:10,767 --> 01:57:12,678
Sure, if you say so!

1854
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,509
Both of you do look cute.

1855
01:57:14,534 --> 01:57:15,478
I'm going in now...

1856
01:57:15,501 --> 01:57:17,208
don't want to miss your entry.

1857
01:57:19,434 --> 01:57:21,436
Dude, what's down there?

1858
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:22,669
Where?

1859
01:57:22,701 --> 01:57:23,201
Dude!

1860
01:57:23,534 --> 01:57:27,277
Hail the Goddess of the lions

1861
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:31,600
Long live your reign

1862
01:57:31,601 --> 01:57:35,777
Long live your reign

1863
01:57:38,267 --> 01:57:41,146
Always be praised

1864
01:57:49,334 --> 01:57:52,440
If I was the lion of your temple

1865
01:57:53,301 --> 01:57:54,609
That's our cue.

1866
01:58:01,034 --> 01:58:02,099
All the best. dude!

1867
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:06,014
I would take you on my back
and through the jungle

1868
01:58:06,034 --> 01:58:10,346
I would be blessed by you every day

1869
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:15,177
If I was the lion of your temple

1870
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:20,382
If I was the lion of your temple

1871
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:25,140
If I was the lion of your temple

1872
01:58:25,667 --> 01:58:30,013
If I was the lion of your temple

1873
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:46,513
If I was the peacock in your garden

1874
01:58:52,467 --> 01:58:58,110
If I was the peacock in your garden

1875
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:07,007
If I was the peacock in your garden

1876
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:15,277
The peacock in your garden.
If I was the peacock in your garden.

1877
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:22,446
If I was the peacock in your garden

1878
01:59:25,267 --> 01:59:26,610
Where the hell is Choocha?

1879
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:37,379
If I was the peacock in your garden

1880
01:59:59,434 --> 02:00:00,766
The entire amount for what?

1881
02:00:00,767 --> 02:00:02,542
Last time he didn't perform.

1882
02:00:02,601 --> 02:00:04,199
Today you ruined the costume.

1883
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,474
Won't I take it out of your money?

1884
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:08,766
What about the trouble I went through?

1885
02:00:08,767 --> 02:00:13,000
By God. Pradhan. I've seen enough swindlers
but you beat them all.

1886
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:14,600
You're taking advantage of our innocence.
Aren't you?

1887
02:00:14,601 --> 02:00:16,308
Innocence, my foot!

1888
02:00:18,167 --> 02:00:20,272
Hello... Lali...

1889
02:00:21,334 --> 02:00:24,500
We didn't get as much as we expected...

1890
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:29,007
I'll try and figure some other way.
But I suggest you push a little harder too.

1891
02:00:43,767 --> 02:00:47,199
Dear God, I don't know what's going
to happen today...

1892
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,440
or how it will finally unfold...

1893
02:00:48,467 --> 02:00:50,276
I leave it all up to you.

1894
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:51,766
Please. get us through.

1895
02:00:51,767 --> 02:00:53,610
You know what's best for us.

1896
02:00:53,634 --> 02:00:56,444
Just get us out of this mess, please!

1897
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:19,140
Brother. the dopehead ran away
with the petrol tank.

1898
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:24,371
Thank you sir, which way did he go'?

1899
02:01:24,601 --> 02:01:26,274
No man, I don't eat non-veg food.

1900
02:01:41,167 --> 02:01:42,111
Where is he?

1901
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,200
Bloody dopehead,
I won't spare you today!

1902
02:02:13,201 --> 02:02:14,771
Why are you after my motorcycle?

1903
02:02:15,001 --> 02:02:17,481
Whoa, take it easy.
What have I done?

1904
02:02:17,501 --> 02:02:20,166
This fuel tank is from
your aircraft, is it'?

1905
02:02:20,167 --> 02:02:21,475
What have I done?

1906
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:24,099
If it's not mine. is it yours?

1907
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:25,773
On your feet, you jerk!

1908
02:02:26,001 --> 02:02:28,100
Time to take you to the cops.

1909
02:02:28,101 --> 02:02:30,012
Then we will know whose tank it is!

1910
02:02:30,034 --> 02:02:32,275
Fine, let's go.
You think I'm afraid?

1911
02:02:32,767 --> 02:02:34,110
I'm not a loser.

1912
02:02:34,534 --> 02:02:36,707
I can buy the cops at
the snap of my fingers.

1913
02:02:38,167 --> 02:02:40,511
My pockets are overflowing with money.

1914
02:02:40,767 --> 02:02:44,271
Look at this
take a good look...

1915
02:02:46,434 --> 02:02:47,208
What?!

1916
02:02:48,167 --> 02:02:50,613
Never seen so much money
in one go, have you?

1917
02:02:51,334 --> 02:02:53,143
Dumbstruck, aren't you'?

1918
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:56,271
How come you have all this money?

1919
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:58,766
Remember I had told you...

1920
02:02:58,767 --> 02:03:00,644
my money is gathering dust.

1921
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:03,433
I have 12 shops in Gandhinagar...

1922
02:03:03,434 --> 02:03:04,606
all leased out.

1923
02:03:05,201 --> 02:03:07,272
I even file my income tax returns.

1924
02:03:07,767 --> 02:03:09,610
All my wealth is white...

1925
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,307
only my deeds are black.

1926
02:03:14,167 --> 02:03:16,147
What will you do with this money?

1927
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:18,340
I'll make paper boats and
leave them in the sewer...

1928
02:03:18,367 --> 02:03:19,368
you've got a problem?

1929
02:03:24,101 --> 02:03:26,775
What if I double your money
in a few hours?

1930
02:03:30,367 --> 02:03:31,175
What do you say?

1931
02:03:32,601 --> 02:03:33,671
Sardarji...

1932
02:03:34,368 --> 02:03:36,314
are you high on something too'?

1933
02:03:36,334 --> 02:03:38,211
Shut up!
Or I'll slap you hard!

1934
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:41,301
I'm not taking your money for nothing...

1935
02:03:42,534 --> 02:03:44,775
you can have my motorcycle as collateral.

1936
02:03:51,634 --> 02:03:53,773
Alright, you can have it.

1937
02:03:55,334 --> 02:03:57,177
Keep your motorcycle too.

1938
02:03:58,434 --> 02:04:01,347
Meet me at the
temple near the river after 4 pm.

1939
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:03,512
To hell with double.

1940
02:04:03,534 --> 02:04:06,174
Bring back what you take.

1941
02:04:06,767 --> 02:04:09,543
Not like I can take all
this with me when I die.

1942
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:12,047
Here you go.

1943
02:04:14,367 --> 02:04:16,040
And don't forget the petrol tank.

1944
02:04:19,267 --> 02:04:20,547
Guess what, I found some more...

1945
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,440
keep this as well.

1946
02:04:27,367 --> 02:04:30,439
Loafers. wasters, bums,

1947
02:04:30,634 --> 02:04:34,100

We're fortunate we're bums.
We've got dreams in our eyes.

1959
02:04:57,168 --> 02:05:00,445
Every dream is worth a hundred billion,
studded with diamonds and pearls

1960
02:05:00,467 --> 02:05:03,766
In the durbars of Delhi, there
are many who think they're princes.

1961
02:05:03,767 --> 02:05:07,133
One look at us and they
wet the ground they stand on.

1962
02:05:07,134 --> 02:05:10,343
We eat. we forget. we hit and we run.
Out of our way!

Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!

1985
02:06:37,134 --> 02:06:39,266
Impressive.

1986
02:06:39,267 --> 02:06:42,111
You all are bunch of scoundrels,
including your coach.

1987
02:06:43,167 --> 02:06:45,647
Managed 2.5 million in one day!

1988
02:06:45,667 --> 02:06:48,199
You sure you haven't printed
these notes yourself?

1989
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,646
Madam, you can take your own time
and check each one!

1990
02:06:50,667 --> 02:06:52,340
Smartass!

1991
02:06:52,368 --> 02:06:54,533
One sniff and I'll know
which ones are fake.

1992
02:06:54,534 --> 02:06:55,342
Get it?

1993
02:06:56,134 --> 02:06:58,444
I had some other plans for you.

1994
02:06:58,467 --> 02:07:00,166
I thought I'd give you a hard time.

1995
02:07:00,167 --> 02:07:02,167
Get you to do some more work...

1996
02:07:02,168 --> 02:07:04,266
Nevermind.

1997
02:07:04,267 --> 02:07:04,768
Dismissed!

1998
02:07:11,467 --> 02:07:13,600
Yes, what's the matter?

1999
02:07:13,601 --> 02:07:15,099
Why are you still here?

2000
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:16,545
Waiting for my wedding?

2001
02:07:16,601 --> 02:07:19,100
Madam, go ahead, give us a hard time,
get more work done...

2002
02:07:19,101 --> 02:07:21,604
It's not like we are waiting
to click pictures with you.

2003
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:23,477
This covers the payment for the job done.

2004
02:07:23,501 --> 02:07:25,208
What say we do this again?

2005
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:26,601
What?

2006
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:37,266
Here's 700,000 advance...

2007
02:07:37,267 --> 02:07:38,507
got any more pills?

2008
02:07:40,434 --> 02:07:43,108
Once a scoundrel.
Always a scoundrel!

2009
02:07:44,534 --> 02:07:46,036
What do you say. coach?

2010
02:07:47,634 --> 02:07:49,477
I say. go for it.

2011
02:07:49,501 --> 02:07:50,605
Really?

2012
02:07:53,301 --> 02:07:54,466
Where will you sell them?

2013
02:07:54,467 --> 02:07:58,108
Just give us the stuff.
We'll figure how and where to set up shop.

2014
02:08:02,101 --> 02:08:03,637
Brilliant!

2015
02:08:03,667 --> 02:08:06,341
I'll make sure I'm there
for your opening night.

2016
02:08:08,134 --> 02:08:10,171
I'll give pills for a million.
Make the most of it.

2017
02:08:37,267 --> 02:08:37,767
Let's go.

2018
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:52,649
Loafers. O Loafers,
your luck is so messed up

2019
02:08:53,301 --> 02:08:59,013
Even your shoes are in tatters

2020
02:08:59,767 --> 02:09:02,441
Your luck is so messed up.

2021
02:09:57,301 --> 02:10:00,373
Loafers. wasters, bums,

2022
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:02,637
A ghost ran away with your underpants

2023
02:10:04,534 --> 02:10:07,344
Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!

2024
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:18,204
Neetu, bring everyone over
to the police station.

2025
02:10:20,101 --> 02:10:20,704
What?

2026
02:10:21,167 --> 02:10:22,703
What happened that day, sardarji?

2027
02:10:24,634 --> 02:10:27,274
Sir, we were afraid you wouldn't
believe us.

2028
02:10:28,434 --> 02:10:30,778
We only wanted to return
the money and leave.

2029
02:10:32,367 --> 02:10:34,108
What if I still don't believe you?

2030
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,441
Sir...

2031
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:44,166
Zafar is as innocent as a cow...

2032
02:10:44,167 --> 02:10:45,009
an artist.

2033
02:10:45,634 --> 02:10:48,205
Lali here... is a saint.

2034
02:10:51,634 --> 02:10:55,207
Every bad deed possible
we've had our hand in it.

2035
02:10:56,167 --> 02:10:59,341
Sir, we tried selling those pills
because we needed money.

2036
02:10:59,368 --> 02:11:01,644
Never realised that we were selling poison.

2037
02:11:02,534 --> 02:11:05,777
It was fortunate that
you raided the party...

2038
02:11:06,634 --> 02:11:10,514
and those pills went down the gutter
instead of somebody's blood-stream.

2039
02:11:11,301 --> 02:11:12,302
Sir...

2040
02:11:13,701 --> 02:11:16,113
please think about Zafafs plan.

2041
02:11:17,034 --> 02:11:20,174
You'll get what you want and
we'll be even with Bholi.

2042
02:11:24,467 --> 02:11:25,707
If you...

2043
02:11:27,501 --> 02:11:29,037
still feel...

2044
02:11:43,367 --> 02:11:44,038
Okay-

2045
02:11:47,534 --> 02:11:49,104
She won't refuse your offer.

2046
02:11:51,001 --> 02:11:53,379
She's always looking
for scapegoats like you.

2047
02:11:53,434 --> 02:11:55,004
To sell her stuff.

2048
02:11:55,634 --> 02:11:57,433
It's great if her stuff sells...

2049
02:11:57,434 --> 02:11:58,640
and if it's confiscated...

2050
02:11:59,434 --> 02:12:02,000
she has her moles in the
police department...

2051
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:03,446
who give her stuff back to her.

2052
02:12:04,601 --> 02:12:07,639
But it's guys like you
who get mired in her plans.

2053
02:12:11,468 --> 02:12:13,106
Make sure. she doesn't suspect you.

2054
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,033
Thank you, sir.

2055
02:12:19,034 --> 02:12:21,446
We won't give up the money...

2056
02:12:21,467 --> 02:12:23,276
moreover, we deserve a reward...

2057
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:26,180
and to be part of the Republic day parade.

2058
02:12:28,334 --> 02:12:31,008
Hello... May day... May day... Ready!

2059
02:12:32,767 --> 02:12:35,338
Sir, what if you get delayed?

2060
02:12:35,368 --> 02:12:39,200
What if your binoculars are hazy
or car tyre is punctured...

2061
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:41,767
or your mother calls you back home.

2062
02:12:41,768 --> 02:12:43,645
Or what if a traffic cop stops you...

2063
02:12:44,601 --> 02:12:50,677
Let there be a country of loafers
and make me the President.

2064
02:12:51,267 --> 02:12:54,476
Sing with me now, brothers and sisters.

2065
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:57,766

Who thought I was no one special

2085
02:16:21,134 --> 02:16:24,206
It is their mistake

2086
02:16:24,534 --> 02:16:26,309
