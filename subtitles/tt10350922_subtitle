1
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,881
I made mashed eggplants today.
No french fries for you.

2
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:09,761
Why, mom?

3
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,298
Yes, no french fries.
That's all you want to eat.

4
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,840
Your teacher's been complaining
that you never finish your lunch.

5
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:18,423
Either you want french
fries or those fried smilies.

6
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,506
I've told you many times
not to look at that place.

7
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,215
But why, mom?

8
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,131
Aren't you asking too many questions?

9
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,173
Keep walking.

10
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,065
I said no, didn't I?

11
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,732
Anjali.

12
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,774
- How are you, dear?
- Hi, Aunty.

13
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:38,899
- Where are you coming from?
- I am fine.

14
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,107
Just a routine checkup.

15
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,899
Great. When is the due date?

16
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,107
Anytime. Anytime

17
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,857
- All the best.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,190
Take care.

19
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,315
And don't hesitate to
call if you need anything.

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,315
Okay.

21
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:50,774
Take care.

22
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:51,815
Let's go, dear.

23
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,565
Oh no!

24
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,190
Good night, sister.

25
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,482
- You are coming to sleep right?
- Yes. I am coming.

26
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:21,065
The door's open. Come in.

27
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,315
Why aren't you coming inside?

28
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:44,940
Sister.

29
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,149
Where are you?

30
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:06,649
Sister.

31
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,024
Sister...

32
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:07,774
Palak.

33
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,232
What happened?

34
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:13,940
Sister...

35
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,857
Sister, I dreamt someone dragged
me to that land and killed me.

36
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,630
I told you not to get...

37
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,047
...the veil from that land.

38
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:25,589
But you never listen.

39
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,214
Till that veil stays in the house...

40
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,672
...something terrible will always happen.

41
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:30,922
Where is that red veil?

42
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,839
No, don't...

43
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,297
Don't hit me!

44
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:24,339
Please tell him not to hit me.

45
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,922
My father does not have money for dowry.

46
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,380
This isn't about dowry,
it's about the spirit.

47
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,880
I've dealt with thousands of spirits!

48
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,464
No one's ever admitted
of being possessed!

49
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,797
I'll have to beat him out of you!

50
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:41,005
Stop it.

51
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,422
I said I am not possessed.

52
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,089
This girl has been
possessed by an evil spirit.

53
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,172
- Kailash.
- Yes, Baba.

54
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:51,297
Bring me a milk glass.

55
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,547
Here you go, Baba.

56
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:57,880
"Abracadabra! Hocuspocus!"

57
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:04,089
"Evil spirits and witches...begone!"

58
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,422
Here's the proof,
of that evil spirit's ash.

59
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,839
Bring me a vessel, Kailash.

60
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:15,464
Here you go.

61
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:19,797
"Evil spirits and witches...begone!"

62
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,297
I AM A WITCH.

63
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:31,172
- Baba!
- All hail Baba!

64
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:34,255
Baba! Baba! Baba!

65
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:38,130
You're mighty and powerful.
You are strong, Baba.

66
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,464
Baba, you drove the
spirit out of this female.

67
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:41,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

68
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,172
Baba, you're great. Bless me.

69
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:46,380
- Bless me, please...
- What are you doing? Who are you?

70
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,380
Hey...

71
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:50,255
I saw it.

72
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,630
That evil spirit has now possessed Baba.

73
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,297
- What nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

74
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,839
- I've been possessed...?
- Yes.

75
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,255
- That's impossible!
- I saw it myself.

76
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,755
It's impossible.

77
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,964
I'll prove it to you.

78
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,297
Where's your vessel, Baba?

79
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,130
Kailash!

80
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:04,880
Kailash, yeah.

81
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,047
Look at this.

82
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,005
This is that milk glass.

83
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,089
It's empty.

84
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,589
Nothing in here.

85
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:11,964
I'll place it here.

86
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,255
And what did Baba say?

87
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,714
"Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and caldron bubble."

88
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,422
OM

89
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,380
What is this?

90
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,005
See...Baba's possessed too, isn't he?

91
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,172
- Isn't he?
- Yes.

92
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,297
- Isn't he?
- Yes.

93
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,755
What yes yes yes?

94
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,922
This glass is made of aluminium.

95
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,130
Baba applied mercury
chloride while cleaning it.

96
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:46,089
When Aluminium reacts with
mercury it forms an aluminium amalgam.

97
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,214
This lesson is taught in class seven.

98
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,297
And where's the other vessel.
Give me.

99
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:52,547
See...

100
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:53,922
It's filled with water.

101
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,130
Look.

102
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,339
See.

103
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,214
There's Another chemical
called methyl orange...

104
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,130
...which this Baba used
earlier to write on the wall

105
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,380
"I am a witch".

106
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:08,589
It reacts with water
to form a red colour.

107
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:09,922
It's not blood.

108
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,172
Look it up on Google.

109
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,339
Even kids will tell you this.

110
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,130
And yes. There's no such thing as ghosts.

111
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:23,797
If I ever see a real ghost,
I swear I'll wear bangles.

112
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,214
You mean this Baba is an imposter.

113
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:27,964
There is no ghost.

114
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,422
He is possessed, alright.

115
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,589
Possessed by greed.

116
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,880
Possessed by avarice.

117
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,005
Baba, I've everything on video.

118
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,130
If you ever try to rob anyone again...

119
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,964
...I'll upload this video on youtube
and download you in jail.

120
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:41,797
Understood.

121
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,505
Come here you.

122
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,714
Come here.

123
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:52,339
- She is your wife? Right?
- Yes.

124
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,255
She's my sister.

125
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,047
If you ever misbehave
with her again, then...

126
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:00,547
What was that for?

127
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:02,755
Then what is this? What is this?

128
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,714
Thank you, brother.

129
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:07,964
You saved my marriage.

130
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:10,839
Don't worry, sister.

131
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,339
It's the beginning of your happiness...

132
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:18,839
- ...and, Baba, your wicked life's...
- End! End!

133
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,865
"Passengers are requested
to fasten their seat belts..."

134
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:26,755
"...because there are no
exit doors on this vehicle."

135
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,005
"Thank you for dancing to our beat."

136
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,255
"Dinner's served."

137
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:35,053
Rashmi, what are all
the preparations for?

138
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:36,428
How many times have
I said call me aunty?

139
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:37,761
It's not polite to
call adults by their name.

140
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,636
My teacher says humans
are known by their name.

141
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:43,886
But what are you doing?

142
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,136
Today is your uncle's
and my wedding anniversary.

143
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,553
Asif will be here
any minute with my gift.

144
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,303
I want to surprise
him before he surprises me.

145
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:55,553
My gift.

146
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,220
Ta-dah.

147
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,011
I am in no mood for games.

148
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:07,511
Aah...don't you have
anything to say to me.

149
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,845
Yeah, I did go to the doctor
to get my eyes checked up.

150
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,345
He said I won't need glasses.

151
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,970
Use some eye drops,
and it'll get better.

152
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,053
Aren't you forgetting something, Asif?

153
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:26,136
Tomorrow is the 31st of March.

154
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,136
We've to file our IT returns.

155
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,678
Thank you so much.
We shouldn't be charged penalty.

156
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:34,261
Quickly make me some masala tea.

157
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,261
- I'll fill-up the form. Come fast.
- Forget it.

158
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,720
Can't even remember our anniversary.

159
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,053
Asif...

160
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,803
Asif...

161
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,428
Asif...

162
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,803
- Asif...
- Hey...

163
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:26,803
When did you do all this?

164
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:29,345
When you were busy making tea.

165
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:34,720
Start.

166
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:36,553
Thank you.

167
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:40,345
In these three-years you
never let me miss my family.

168
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,345
That's a lie.

169
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:44,011
If you weren't missing them...

170
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,136
...then you wouldn't be
thinking about them today.

171
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,803
I know you pretend to have
forgotten them only to make me happy.

172
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:54,136
And I wish I could return
you your family as a gift.

173
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,803
But I'll try my best.

174
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,553
My Phone?

175
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:04,178
Finish.

176
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,095
Hello, Rashmi.

177
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,720
How are you, dear?

178
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:09,470
Mom!

179
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,595
After so many years?

180
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,261
I haven't talked to you in three-years.

181
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,303
But I couldn't hold back today.

182
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:17,678
I was missing you.

183
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:18,803
How is papa?

184
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:20,303
He's okay.

185
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:24,386
But he's never been
happy since you left.

186
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,636
He's become very irritable.

187
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:26,428
Listen.

188
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,011
Happy Anniversary.

189
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:31,095
Our 25th Anniversary is coming up.

190
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,178
I want you and Asif to come over.

191
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,636
It will be really delightful
if the entire family's together.

192
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:39,803
But, papa?

193
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,136
He doesn't even want to see my face.

194
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:43,553
Don't worry about him.

195
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:45,720
I'll handle him.

196
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,053
If nothing else then I'll say
it's you who I want as my gift.

197
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:50,928
You just come

198
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,386
Of course we will come Mom.

199
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:53,678
We will surely come.

200
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:56,678
Asif.

201
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,553
Mom has invited all of us home.

202
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:04,428
We're finally going
to meet Sachin and Ratna!

203
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:07,970
Call them grandma and grandpa.

204
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:12,178
Let's take someone else's child
and leave him with the neighbors.

205
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:14,178
Call them grandma and grandpa.

206
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,511
But Asif, why did they not
call you two home for so long?

207
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,220
Sit.

208
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:22,553
Sit. Sit.

209
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:23,636
Now listen.

210
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,803
Your uncle and aunty
eloped and got married.

211
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,803
They did that thinking that
the elders will eventually forgive us.

212
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,220
Meaning your grandpa and
grandma will eventually forgive us.

213
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:39,386
But your grandpa, meaning her father,
is a kind of a dictator, persistent...

214
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,345
Let me speak.

215
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,053
He couldn't digest the
fact that I am a Muslim.

216
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,053
Is he still stuck on
the Hindu-Muslim conflict?

217
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,511
Yes, son, he's still stuck
with the Hindu-Muslim conflict!

218
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:51,428
He's never met me or
your aunt post our marriage.

219
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,220
But now...

220
00:18:53,553 --> 00:19:00,178
I'll show father-in-law, that Rashmi,
your aunt made the right choice.

221
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:04,928
- And her husband is husband no...
- Zero!

222
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:08,178
- He's no. 1.
- Yes, no. 1.

223
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,511
Look uncle, I drew our family tree.
- Did you talk to a doctor.

224
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:18,928
Wow! We're looking like fruits.

225
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:20,470
I'll come and check.

226
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,636
What's the matter?
Why are you in a bad mood?

227
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:34,970
Are you two okay?

228
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,095
Are you okay, son?

229
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:37,803
Yes.

230
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,303
Yeah.
- Sorry.

231
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,303
Shaan, are you all right?

232
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:43,845
Yes.

233
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,136
Rashmi

234
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,470
Anjali.

235
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:15,886
Oh my God.

236
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,636
- Look at her.
- Rashmi.

237
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,511
How are you?

238
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,928
I am fine. Congratulations!

239
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,011
Thank you.

240
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,345
Palak is all grown up.

241
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,803
Is everything okay?

242
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,053
Yes, everything's fine. But...

243
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:33,136
What about you?
Did your father finally accept you?

244
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,095
No. But mom said she will convince him.

245
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,053
It's their 25th Anniversary,
and that's why they have invited us.

246
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,261
Great.
And who is that? Is he your son?

247
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:42,303
No..no..

248
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:43,761
Shaan, come here.

249
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,553
He's the son of Asif's older brother.

250
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,345
His parents died in an accident.

251
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,553
So he's been living with us since then.

252
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:50,303
Come on.

253
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,970
- Hi.
- Say hi to aunty.

254
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:53,886
- Hello.
- Hi.

255
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,386
And he's my husband, Asif.

256
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,553
Asif, you remember I was
telling you about my friend Anjali.

257
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:58,595
- Hi, Anjali.
- Hi.

258
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:00,595
- That's my sister Palak.
- Hi.

259
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,428
Uncle, why is aunty so fat?

260
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,428
She's not fat, she's pregnant.

261
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,261
By that logic Sooner or later even
your aunty will be fat...

262
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,553
Shut up, Asif.

263
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,386
But when is the due date?

264
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,553
Anytime. Anytime.

265
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:14,886
Grandpa, let's play statue.

266
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,720
No, dear.

267
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,220
Your grandpa has chest pain.

268
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:20,053
- Granny...
- Ratna, it's alright. Let her play.

269
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,678
Okay, I'll make lemongrass tea for you.

270
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,886
Okay, I'll go first.

271
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,261
No, grandpa, me.

272
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:28,678
- Okay, fine.
- Lets Play.

273
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,345
Ratna, see who's at the door.

274
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,261
Statue!!!

275
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,220
Mom.

276
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:42,636
How are you?

277
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,220
God bless you.

278
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,011
It's been so long.

279
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,720
You are looking so cute.

280
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:49,470
Come in. Come in.

281
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:51,595
And who is this? Your nephew?

282
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:53,595
- Touch Grandmom's feet. Touch her feet.
- Shaan.

283
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,928
Come here, Shaan.

284
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:59,386
We came to meet you, and you left us.

285
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:00,886
- Who are you?
- Yes.

286
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:02,970
Grandpa, you lost the statue game.

287
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:03,678
Statue?

288
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,720
Yes, we were playing the statue game.

289
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:06,636
Who are you...

290
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:08,428
...that declared me dead on arrival.

291
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:10,095
- I...
- Listen.

292
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,678
I called them.

293
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:14,303
- He's Rashmi's husband, Asif.
- Yes.

294
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:16,428
And that's his nephew Shaan.

295
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,636
It's a special occasion.

296
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,511
It's our marriage anniversary.

297
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,303
And I wanted the entire
family to be together...

298
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,595
...so please, let it go!

299
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,886
My family's with me
on my marriage anniversary!

300
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,803
I don't want outsiders!

301
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,845
What are you doing?

302
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,470
What...

303
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:36,428
No need....

304
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,595
Sachin!

305
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,386
They are not outsiders!

306
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,220
They are my family!

307
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,095
- I invited them here!
- The whole family is crazy.

308
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,720
And they are going to stay
with us for a couple of days!

309
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:52,136
And listen Sachin, this is
not a request, I'm telling you this!

310
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:53,595
Heard that.

311
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,220
You already destroyed
my life the way you wanted to.

312
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,678
She is drunk again.

313
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:03,803
- Hot flat-breads.
- Thank you, sister-in-law.

314
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:06,803
Can I offer you a hot flat-bread?

315
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,095
- You know what, sister-in-law.
- Yes.

316
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,720
The food is delicious.

317
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,136
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

318
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:19,886
By the brother-in-law, what do you do?

319
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,553
What is your profession?

320
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,428
I conduct religious programs.

321
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,970
Where ever we can we serve
the followers with our music.

322
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,803
"O, Goddess..."

323
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:32,720
I've a strong voice.

324
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,470
Wow!

325
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:36,636
Brother-in-law, that small medal there...

326
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,386
You got that for your singing.

327
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:39,345
Of course.

328
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,470
And the big one is for quitting.

329
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,386
He's just joking.
Joking...

330
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,345
By the way, Asif,...

331
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:52,845
what do you do?

332
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,803
I eat...what else?

333
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:58,928
I mean besides eating
and declaring people dead...

334
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:01,053
...what else do you do?

335
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:03,511
He deals in granite and white marbles.

336
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:04,928
- Okay.
- Marbles?

337
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:08,095
You mean playing marbles.

338
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,720
He is also an investigator.

339
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,470
Like the ones that come
on TV 'Savdhaan India, CID'.

340
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:14,678
"Something's not right, Daya."

341
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:15,470
That way?

342
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:16,636
No, no.

343
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:19,345
He's the senior member
of the "Jaago Avam Committee".

344
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,678
You mean he's a security guard.

345
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,595
My husband is not a security guard.

346
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,928
His organisation spreads awareness
against ghosts and spirits.

347
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:28,845
Heard that, Sachin.

348
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,803
Our son-in-law drives
away ghosts and spirits.

349
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,386
Suits him!

350
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:36,261
If he can drive off with our daughter...

351
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,886
...driving away ghosts and
spirits is no big deal for him.

352
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:44,220
Son, don't mind him.

353
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:45,636
Finish your food.

354
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:47,553
I never do.

355
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
Where do we play cricket today?

356
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,386
The neighbours in that
lane are always complaining.

357
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,178
And there are no playgrounds nearby.
Where are we going to play?

358
00:24:57,303 --> 00:24:58,095
Wait a minute.

359
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,761
I met Anjali aunty on my way here.

360
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:03,928
And there's a big ground next to her house.

361
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:06,511
Come here.

362
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:07,428
Listen.

363
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,553
I've heard weird things happen there.

364
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,345
There is a Ghost there
- Ghost!

365
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:17,011
There is no such thing as a ghost.
Spirits don't wander.

366
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:20,386
Spirits attain peace
(Shanti) after death.

367
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,553
Mama!

368
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,678
What's wrong with her?

369
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,970
Her name is Shanti. That's why.

370
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:28,386
Why are you all so scared?

371
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:29,595
Come with me.

372
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:32,136
We will go and play
on that ground today.

373
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:34,845
- Come on.
- But uncle, mom said no.

374
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:39,636
Shruti, If I see a ghost
on that piece of land, I swear...

375
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:41,928
I swear I'll wear bangles.

376
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:43,886
- What will I wear?
- Bangles.

377
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,011
Come on.

378
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,428
- Come with me. Let's go.
- Come on.

379
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:51,678
Come on, guys.

380
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:53,303
Come on, get down everyone.

381
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,678
We're finally here.

382
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,011
No need to be scared.
There's nothing here.

383
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:58,595
There are no ghosts here.

384
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:05,261
Come on.

385
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:07,678
- You know what, let's go play there.
- Yes, that's a nice place.

386
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,511
- Come on, let's clean up.
- Clear everything.

387
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,761
Come on. Clear this out.

388
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:13,720
Clear this one too

389
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,678
And this one...and that...

390
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:17,553
Sprinkle water.

391
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:19,303
Sprinkle water.

392
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,553
Here too. Come on.

393
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,386
Come on.

394
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:24,886
Come on.

395
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,928
Hold it.

396
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:04,553
Come on, children, to your positions.
You be the wicketkeeper.

397
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,511
Wait.

398
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:14,386
I told you...
I told you this place is haunted.

399
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,720
Listen...Kids...
- Wait.

400
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,053
Asif, you should run too.

401
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,345
There is no ghost!

402
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,678
"O, mother goddess..."

403
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:03,553
"Dear mother goddess..."

404
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:07,178
- "Bless me...bless me with your grace."
- Son... son... break this for me, son.

405
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,261
Break this coconut for me.

406
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:10,886
Please...
I am in a hurry.

407
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,011
Break it...

408
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:14,386
Son, will you break this for me?

409
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,261
I am busy.

410
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:16,595
- Hold this.
- Okay.

411
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:18,178
Hey...

412
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:19,470
What are you doing?

413
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:21,095
Do you want to break the floor?

414
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,261
Stupid Man

415
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,678
Wow!

416
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,345
What power!

417
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:46,303
You're fit, boss!

418
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,720
Where's this smell coming from?

419
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,011
Is it coming from the stumps?

420
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,136
How can it be coming from the stumps?

421
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,095
Keep it away.

422
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,678
Give me those, son.
I'll wash them in the basin.

423
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:20,803
Do you want to dirty the basin too?

424
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,261
Wash it outside.

425
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,345
Hey, Mr. Spreading
Awareness Among people.

426
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:27,970
Take some water.

427
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,095
No common sense at all.

428
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,220
No, no...

429
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:36,553
Sorry.

430
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,595
Always treating me like a servant.

431
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,178
Where are you two going?
Go and get dressed.

432
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,970
We'll have to light incense sticks
to get rid of this stench.

433
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,603
Mom!

434
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:56,311
What's wrong?

435
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:58,894
Were you two quarrelling?

436
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:00,394
No.

437
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,644
I heard someone weeping.

438
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,561
But we were asleep.

439
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:05,728
I see...

440
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:07,644
Okay fine, go back to sleep.

441
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,478
- But what's wrong?
- Nothing, go sleep.

442
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,436
- Are you okay?
- I said sleep.

443
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,061
Mother.

444
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:28,228
Who is there?

445
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:30,436
Who is crying?

446
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,978
"Oh Holy One,
bless me with your strength."

447
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:29,311
"Oh Holy One,
bless me with your strength."

448
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,103
"Oh Holy One,
bless me with your strength."

449
00:34:32,311 --> 00:34:35,519
"Oh Holy One,
bless me with your strength."

450
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:42,978
I didn't see anything!
I didn't see anything!

451
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:04,478
Ashwini, why don't you believe me?

452
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,894
Last night I saw a dark shadow here.

453
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,353
I think it was a ghost.

454
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:18,269
Mom, if you don't mind, did
you have one drink too many last night?

455
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,644
No. As usual, I had just one bottle.

456
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:23,769
- One.
- But I am telling you it was a ghost...

457
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,728
The ghost is in your mind, mom.

458
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,728
Since what age have you been drinking?

459
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:33,353
Since adolescence.

460
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:36,103
I mean...since the time I can remember.

461
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:40,228
- Are you able to sleep?
- I can. But keep waking up.

462
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,019
Any difficulty in breathing?
Are your lungs working fine?

463
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,811
Yes. I do feel breathless.
I feel breathless at nights.

464
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,019
Like a balloon?

465
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,519
Yes. But all these symptoms are
common when one has blood pressure.

466
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:50,644
How is this connected with that shadow?

467
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:53,103
There's no connection,
but this a reaction.

468
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:56,186
This illness is called Sciophobia,
meaning fear of shadows.

469
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,103
Having a phobia of shadows.

470
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,894
It's a mental illness.

471
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:06,394
You should get yourself treated
by some doctor so that this phobia...

472
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:12,103
First, you declared me dead on arrival,
and now you're saying she's crazy.

473
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:13,436
Great.

474
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:18,144
The scariest ghost in your life is him!

475
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,061
- He's the dark shadow...
- Asif!

476
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:21,478
He's my father!

477
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:23,061
- Then why does he keep scaring me?
- Shut up.

478
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:24,978
Why does he keep roaming
around like ghosts?

479
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:26,978
Asif, what are you doing?

480
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,103
You embarrassed me
in front of my family.

481
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,061
You're not the member of your organisation
here, you're a member of this family.

482
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:35,103
We came here to impress them,
not to scare away ghosts.

483
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:38,269
Seriously.
You can never do anything for me ever.

484
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:45,436
Rashmi, never say I
cannot do anything for you.

485
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,644
I can anything for you.

486
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:52,811
Even things that you never imagined.
I can buy the for you.

487
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,061
Liar.

488
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,311
Am I a liar?

489
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:01,269
You don't believe me, do you?

490
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,269
Fine.

491
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:05,603
Let's go in my dreams.

492
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,561
Deepak. Deepak.

493
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:56,603
"O Mother Goddess...!"

494
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,394
Dee...

495
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,228
Deepak.

496
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,144
The wooden horse in
the store-room is rocking.

497
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:03,978
Let it rock.

498
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:06,394
What do you mean let it rock?
It's rocking by itself.

499
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,769
- By itself?
- I am scared.

500
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,519
Don't be scared. I am there.

501
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:12,894
Yes, come on.

502
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:16,478
What ghost will be scarier than us.

503
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:18,353
- Is it wise to go empty-handed...
- Don't be scared.

504
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,894
Shall we carry a stick as well?

505
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:21,144
Come on.

506
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:22,811
Look.

507
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:24,394
Careful.

508
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:25,936
Come on.

509
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,853
- What's wrong?
- See. It's moving by itself.

510
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,853
See, it stopped.

511
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,353
How can it stop like this?

512
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:10,686
Wind...

513
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:13,519
It was the wind.

514
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:18,561
Good night.

515
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,103
You and your ghost.

516
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:37,394
It was just my imagination.

517
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:39,436
My imagination.

518
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:44,228
What is it?

519
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,811
Why did you leave me alone?

520
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:48,644
Let's go.

521
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:53,728
(Sanskrit Chant)

522
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,061
Panditji.

523
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,144
Panditji, please help us.

524
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,686
Strange things are
happening in our house.

525
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:30,394
We can hear weeping and
laughing sounds at night.

526
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:32,811
And we also saw a dark shadow.

527
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,019
I think our house is
haunted by an evil spirit.

528
00:44:36,186 --> 00:44:37,603
Please help us.

529
00:44:37,728 --> 00:44:42,978
I cannot tell you in detail
about the problem in your house.

530
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,936
For that, you must conduct
a special veneration at home.

531
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,644
"Glory to Sri Hari."

532
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:57,644
To find out whether your house
is haunted by an evil spirit or not...

533
00:44:57,936 --> 00:44:59,811
...we'll have to pass
through three stages.

534
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:04,144
But priest, we might not survive
at the end of these three stages.

535
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:04,811
Quiet!

536
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,519
- Stage one; Astitva Vidhi.
- Yes, Panditji.

537
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:10,686
Stage two; Vikram Vidhi.

538
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:15,103
And stage three and final stage;
Uddesha Vidhi.

539
00:45:15,686 --> 00:45:21,644
To perform these three venerations, you'll
need Lord Shiva's three-eyed coconut...

540
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:25,269
...a hungry cow in stage-two,...

541
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:30,436
and a drop of blood from one
of your family members in stage three.

542
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:37,353
Yes, mom.
He said the blood of a family member.

543
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:39,103
I am an outsider.

544
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:42,186
And I am busy.
I've a religious program to conduct.

545
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:43,728
For this temple.

546
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:44,894
Good.

547
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:49,436
Keep the rest of the family
members busy in that program.

548
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:54,269
Because except for these two,
we don't need anyone else.

549
00:45:56,936 --> 00:45:58,978
Why is this religious program so silent?

550
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:00,311
Start the program?

551
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:01,603
When is it going to start?

552
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:03,269
Hurry up and start it.

553
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,811
This is why we're here.

554
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:06,353
Where is that Deepak?

555
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:07,936
No sign of Ashwini and Ratna either.

556
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,186
- I'll go check on them.
- When is it going to start?

557
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,061
Hurry up.

558
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:15,769
Hurry up. Hurry up.

559
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:19,894
Where is Deepak?

560
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:24,144
What are you doing here?

561
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:25,561
I've lost my voice.

562
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:27,936
What? Who is going to sing now?

563
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:29,686
Ask this cook.

564
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:30,811
Deepak?

565
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:32,936
- Then you sing?
- How can I sing?

566
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:34,561
Then your husband will sing.

567
00:46:36,186 --> 00:46:38,311
No. I am not singing.

568
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:40,478
No, no, I won't sing.

569
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:41,519
I've no idea.

570
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:43,853
I can sing movie songs,
not religious discourses.

571
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:46,561
But Mother Goddess is the
one who makes films too, Asif.

572
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:50,519
- You have to sing.
- I...

573
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,478
You'll have to sing
to impress my father.

574
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:53,603
- Come on.
- I...

575
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,478
I can't sing!

576
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,894
Glory to Mother Goddess!

577
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,107
Come on whoever it is.

578
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,066
Look, Deepak's here.

579
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:01,441
It's going to start now.

580
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,649
Where were you?
People are screaming!

581
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:06,607
I lost my voice.

582
00:47:06,899 --> 00:47:08,149
What did you put in your mouth?

583
00:47:08,816 --> 00:47:10,274
Who is going to sing now?

584
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:20,024
"I am a beggar..."

585
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:23,316
Tune change, uncle.

586
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:01,232
'Stage 1; Astitva Vidhi.'

587
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:02,732
'In this stage,...

588
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:08,316
you must keep Lord Shiva's favourite
three-eyed coconut in the centre of the house.'

589
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,107
Sorry.

590
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:12,982
- Keep it?
- Yes.

591
00:48:13,232 --> 00:48:15,941
'If there's an evil
spirit in your home...'

592
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:19,232
'...then the coconut will start spinning
in its place.'

593
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,982
Om Namah Shivay!

594
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:34,149
Om Namah Shivay!

595
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:43,357
Om Namah Shivay!

596
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:49,066
It's not spinning.

597
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:50,607
There is no ghost.

598
00:48:56,191 --> 00:49:00,441
Mom...it's spinning!

599
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:04,191
- Spinning!
- And it's spinning pretty fast!

600
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:07,274
33 % confirm.

601
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,357
Stage two; Vikram Vidhi.

602
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:15,357
In this stage, you must feed food
cooked in your home to a hungry cow.

603
00:49:16,024 --> 00:49:17,607
Someone's going to have a feast today.

604
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:22,482
Either the cow...or the spirit!

605
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:25,732
Mom, this side...come on.

606
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:30,316
Cowboy. Cowboy. Bring the cow.

607
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:32,149
Is this the time to speak in English?

608
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:35,982
O Mother Cow.

609
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:37,774
Please.

610
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:40,857
Cow.

611
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:55,607
Hey, cow...

612
00:49:55,982 --> 00:49:58,357
Come back.

613
00:49:58,482 --> 00:50:00,607
What are you doing in there?

614
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:02,149
Cow. Cow.

615
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:04,607
It's coming back.

616
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:07,107
What are you doing?

617
00:50:08,232 --> 00:50:09,524
Someone catch that cow.

618
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:13,607
My cow! My cow!

619
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:16,066
This place is haunted! Run!

620
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,857
We know. You run away from here!
Get lost!

621
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,399
- Ashwini. Ashwini. Ashwini. Ashwini.
- What?

622
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:32,024
We're 66% confirmed
that this place his haunted.

623
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:34,274
I cannot stay in this house.
Come on.

624
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,149
My husband built this
home with a lot of love.

625
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:37,857
How can I leave it?

626
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,816
Listen... Listen...
One final test. Let's perform that.

627
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:42,899
- Please, dear.
- Mom, we'll both end up dead.

628
00:50:43,024 --> 00:50:46,357
No, dear.
One last test. For my sake, please.

629
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:47,941
Mom!

630
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:51,066
Third and last stage,
which is extremely difficult.

631
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:54,399
This can also put your lives at risk.

632
00:50:54,649 --> 00:50:57,691
In this stage, you must turn
off all the lights in the house...

633
00:50:58,232 --> 00:51:02,941
...and one of you will have to
drop some blood near the lamp you lit.

634
00:51:03,982 --> 00:51:07,774
Hail Goddess. Hail Grandma. Hail my mom.

635
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:11,649
- Come on.
- Don't leave me alone here, Ashwini!

636
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:15,482
Let's just give one drop
of blood first and then leave.

637
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:18,941
Hurry up, mom. Or he'll come here.

638
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:22,066
Hurry up. Or it will come here.

639
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,816
- I can't do it!
- You can't do it!

640
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:25,149
No!

641
00:51:25,607 --> 00:51:26,941
Why did you hit me?

642
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:29,732
Why did I hit you? Why you...

643
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:31,816
Hurry up will you!

644
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:34,774
I can't do it. My hands are slipping.

645
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:35,732
Slipping?

646
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:36,816
Slipping?

647
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:38,024
Take that.

648
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:41,191
One drop of blood and you cant....

649
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:43,607
- Hurry up will you!
- I am.

650
00:51:46,524 --> 00:51:49,024
Even in this situation,
you want respect.

651
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:52,399
Hurry up or I will kick you hard.

652
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:54,357
- Hurry up!
- Yes, I'm trying.

653
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,399
Hurry!

654
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:56,691
Hurry up!

655
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:03,107
Now run.

656
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:08,649
'After that, you must go to a safe
place outside the house and wait there.'

657
00:52:08,899 --> 00:52:12,566
'By doing this,
you'll be able to see the evil spirit.'

658
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:18,316
'If the evil spirit licks the blood,
that will mean...'

659
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:21,857
'...he is thirsty for someone's blood.'

660
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,899
Mom...I see something.

661
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:37,482
Yes! There is something.

662
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:38,441
Who is it?

663
00:52:39,107 --> 00:52:41,316
Could it be an animal.

664
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:53,982
100% confirmed.

665
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,607
Lets run away from here.

666
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:02,107
- Oh no! My pawn is gone.
- Yes!

667
00:53:02,232 --> 00:53:04,357
Shruti, its evening already...

668
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:06,482
...and your mom and grandma haven't
returned yet.

669
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:07,774
I didn't see them at
the religious program either.

670
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:08,816
Where are they?

671
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:10,107
They are at the temple grandpa

672
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,982
This headache is killing me.

673
00:53:14,732 --> 00:53:17,316
There's no one to make
lemongrass tea for me.

674
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:20,899
Yes.

675
00:53:21,524 --> 00:53:23,691
- Shaan, it was my turn.
- No, mine.

676
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:35,399
Papa...

677
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,649
Papa, Asif keeps me happy.

678
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:46,774
And Shaan is like a son to me.

679
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:49,899
We're like a complete family, papa.

680
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:54,399
I can't tell you how happy I am.

681
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:59,607
But that doesn't
mean we have everything.

682
00:54:01,232 --> 00:54:02,316
We don't.

683
00:54:05,107 --> 00:54:07,191
We still need your blessings.

684
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:09,941
You haven't accepted my husband yet.

685
00:54:15,357 --> 00:54:18,024
Can I make lemongrass tea for you?

686
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:21,357
Yes, and put some poison
in it and get it for me.

687
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,691
Father, your anger is justified.

688
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:57,524
And we'll leave in a couple of days.

689
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:01,691
But before we leave,
there's something I want to say.

690
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:08,899
In Islam, do you know why
'Namaz' (praying) is so important?

691
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:12,774
Because we believe that the distance
between a problem and its solution...

692
00:55:13,149 --> 00:55:15,441
...is the distance between
the knee and the ground.

693
00:55:17,107 --> 00:55:19,941
When we kneel down,
all problems come to an end.

694
00:55:21,816 --> 00:55:24,149
And every time I have kneeled down,

695
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:28,691
it has been for the sake of
your daughter Rashmi's happiness.

696
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:32,316
And her happiness is now in your hands.

697
00:55:34,357 --> 00:55:35,482
Please accept us.

698
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,982
You wanted tea, didn't you?

699
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:43,191
Can I make lemongrass tea for you?

700
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:44,524
I'll make it really good.

701
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:47,274
Okay.

702
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:50,191
I'll get it right away.

703
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:52,066
Do you want to break my knee?

704
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,982
Sorry. Sorry.

705
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:55,899
He is completely crazy.

706
00:57:42,524 --> 00:57:43,149
Father.

707
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,357
- Your lemongrass tea.
- Yeah.

708
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:50,816
Look, Sachin's drinking
tea made by Asif.

709
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:54,899
Did you put sugar?

710
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:56,482
Two spoonfuls. Do you want more?

711
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:57,941
I have sugar (diabetes)

712
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:00,649
I drink tea without sugar.

713
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:51,107
Asif. What happened?

714
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:52,732
Where are you going?

715
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:55,607
Why are you looking like this?

716
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:17,066
I won't spare them!

717
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:28,252
Panditji!

718
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:31,502
The spirit licked her blood, imagine.
What do we do?

719
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,794
That spirit is too powerful.

720
01:00:34,502 --> 01:00:37,085
And it's beyond my
ability to control it.

721
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,502
I can tell you about such spirits...

722
01:00:40,627 --> 01:00:44,169
...but the solution to
this problem is not with me.

723
01:00:44,877 --> 01:00:46,794
Pardon me. Glory to Goddess.

724
01:00:47,419 --> 01:00:48,502
What kind of a priest is he?

725
01:00:48,627 --> 01:00:50,585
He can tell about the
problem but not the solution.

726
01:00:50,669 --> 01:00:52,585
Such doctors should
get their license revoked.

727
01:00:52,669 --> 01:00:54,335
He's a priest, not a doctor.

728
01:00:54,669 --> 01:00:57,127
See, I'm losing my mind, mom.

729
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,460
Mom, I know a priest, Father D'Mello.

730
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:01,544
Father D'Mello who?

731
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:07,252
Father D'Mello is the guy whose
Cross can destroy any evil spirit.

732
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:09,085
- I'll call home and...
- Shut up.

733
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,169
Keep your ideas to yourself.
They won't work here.

734
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,794
If you know a priest,
even I know a shaman.

735
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,044
Prophet.

736
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:17,960
I remember now.

737
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:21,002
Shahnawaz, I have his number.

738
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,960
Why didn't I call him earlier?

739
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:24,294
I'll call him now.

740
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:25,335
Come on.

741
01:01:30,272 --> 01:01:30,960
Hello.

742
01:01:31,794 --> 01:01:32,544
Hello.

743
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:34,460
Baba... Babaji...

744
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:36,413
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

745
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,169
Ratna, speaking. Ratna.

746
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,335
Tell me, Ratna.

747
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:42,377
What do I say, Baba?

748
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:46,127
Some impure,
tainted, uncouth, devil's spirit...

749
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:50,127
...has entered our home and
trying to destroy my family.

750
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:51,919
Baba, my saviour, God forbid...

751
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:53,419
Do you have a solution?

752
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,502
Right now I am in The Dargah of Ajmer

753
01:01:55,752 --> 01:01:57,169
I will return in 2 days.

754
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:57,835
I see...

755
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,627
But I'll pray for your safety.

756
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:04,460
Go home, you'll be safe from the spirit.
I'll pray for you.

757
01:02:04,919 --> 01:02:05,960
Okay, Baba.

758
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:07,960
Come to the mosque day-after-tomorrow.

759
01:02:08,335 --> 01:02:09,127
Okay.

760
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,169
Thank you, Baba. Thank you.

761
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,710
May god reward you with kindness

762
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:14,919
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

763
01:02:15,044 --> 01:02:16,919
Amazing, mom.

764
01:02:17,044 --> 01:02:21,002
Urdu huh!

765
01:02:21,669 --> 01:02:23,085
- Let's go home, dear.
- No!

766
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,669
I won't go home.

767
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:27,585
I'll go anywhere but not home.

768
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:32,044
Your father-in-law built this
home with a lot of love and hard work.

769
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,460
Come on, dear, let's go home.

770
01:02:33,585 --> 01:02:36,377
If we don't leave that house, we'll die!

771
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,877
We won't die.

772
01:02:38,002 --> 01:02:40,044
Babaji said he'll fix everything.

773
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:41,085
He will pray for us.

774
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,877
He said things will be
okay for the next two days.

775
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:43,919
Come on, dear.

776
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:45,127
Smile.

777
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:46,044
Let's go.

778
01:02:47,252 --> 01:02:47,919
Let's go.

779
01:02:50,669 --> 01:02:53,044
Baba will set things right.

780
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,585
Everyone must have gone for shopping.

781
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,544
Where were you two?

782
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,835
- Don't you want to go shopping?
- We do.

783
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:03,502
- We'll get dressed in 10 minutes.
- Come on, hurry up.

784
01:03:04,835 --> 01:03:05,627
Coming.

785
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:07,585
- Stupid people.
- Papa...

786
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:09,835
Asif wanted to go shopping as well.

787
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:11,335
Can he join us?

788
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:13,377
Okay.

789
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:17,627
Thank you.

790
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:25,419
That one...
No, it's that way.

791
01:03:25,544 --> 01:03:27,585
Not this one. It's very...

792
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:28,669
Thank you, papa.

793
01:03:30,627 --> 01:03:32,502
Take that off. It's not sunny here.

794
01:03:36,752 --> 01:03:38,169
But you are so resplendent.

795
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:40,085
How about this one?
I am thinking for Rashmi.

796
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,335
Ya. Its good

797
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,002
Take a look.

798
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:45,835
Rashmi.

799
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:48,377
Take a look at this one.

800
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:51,044
Isn't this majenta colour nice?

801
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:52,544
The colour is beautiful.

802
01:03:52,669 --> 01:03:54,544
- Try it on.
- Okay.

803
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,252
Asif, should I try this on?

804
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,169
Yes, go ahead.

805
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,710
What are you looking at?

806
01:04:04,794 --> 01:04:05,669
Ratna...

807
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:12,627
I always thought that Rashmi
chose the wrong guy for herself.

808
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:14,002
But now...

809
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:15,669
I feel that...

810
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:20,127
Asif is the right guy.

811
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:27,335
Even I couldn't have found
a better match for Rashmi.

812
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:28,794
You should tell her that.

813
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:29,794
It will make her happy.

814
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,794
Tell me...

815
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:33,210
Pathetic.

816
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:35,085
Asif, is this looking pathetic on me.

817
01:04:35,294 --> 01:04:37,252
No, it's nice. It's Double colour.

818
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:39,460
Exactly, double colour.
Keep this aside.

819
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:40,377
Yes, madam.

820
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,169
How much?

821
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,544
Asif, you should buy
one for Rashmi as well.

822
01:04:43,669 --> 01:04:46,044
- Surprise.
- You will like this one, madam.

823
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,002
It's light blue. See.

824
01:05:17,544 --> 01:05:18,502
Hey mister...

825
01:05:20,669 --> 01:05:22,044
Show me that red sari.

826
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,335
Yes, that one...up there.
Show me that one.

827
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,085
Yes.

828
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:25,960
That one.

829
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,419
Mister...

830
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:41,419
...and that one.

831
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:43,794
- This one.
- Yes, show me that one.

832
01:05:44,627 --> 01:05:45,377
Yes that one.

833
01:05:49,085 --> 01:05:52,002
No, not entirely red. Show me that one.

834
01:05:54,252 --> 01:05:55,752
Hey idiot, what are you looking at?

835
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,960
I said show me the saris.

836
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:08,794
Asif, Rashmi will never
wear such loud red colour saris.

837
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:12,835
They are not for her.

838
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:16,627
These sarees are for me.

839
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:21,419
Joke.

840
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:23,627
Joke?

841
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:30,627
That red one and that one and that one
and that sari with a stitched border.

842
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:32,377
Show me these four saris.

843
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:42,835
Thank you, mister.

844
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:46,627
Asif, what are you doing?

845
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:48,252
Asif...

846
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,002
Why are you behaving like a female?

847
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:52,044
This is not funny anymore.
Let go of the saris.

848
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,960
I said don't touch me.

849
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:17,794
Excuse me. Can I try?

850
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,835
Thank you.

851
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,627
What is he upto?

852
01:08:02,919 --> 01:08:04,377
Tell me how am I looking?

853
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:07,210
You tell me how am I looking?

854
01:08:07,335 --> 01:08:08,669
This is a first-class fancy sari.

855
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,960
Where are you looking?
I am talking to you.

856
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:12,752
Look at me. Why are you looking at her?

857
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:14,794
How am I looking, tell me?

858
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:15,877
You're looking good.

859
01:08:16,002 --> 01:08:17,002
I'm looking good, right?

860
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:17,919
I Love you.

861
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:19,335
You tell me...

862
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,960
What colour blouse should
I wear with this red sari?

863
01:08:24,002 --> 01:08:26,044
Leave me. How dare you touch me?

864
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,002
Aren't you ashamed? Pervert!

865
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:46,960
Who made me wear this sari?

866
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:51,460
Aren't you ashamed making
a mockery of your son-in-law?

867
01:08:56,835 --> 01:08:58,419
He slapped me and left.

868
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,502
But ...You slapped him first.

869
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,252
Mom, this is very nice.

870
01:09:04,544 --> 01:09:05,127
Let's buy it.

871
01:09:05,252 --> 01:09:07,794
Come on, let's buy it.
Let's go pay the bill.

872
01:09:07,919 --> 01:09:08,752
Ashwini.

873
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:39,669
Deepak.

874
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:40,919
Deepak.

875
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:03,960
- Did you see?
- What?

876
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:06,502
Your husband...on the terrace...

877
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:08,627
He was wearing bangles and dancing.

878
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:11,252
Have you lost your mind?
Who is this then?

879
01:11:11,585 --> 01:11:12,835
Who is it?

880
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,252
Oh no... how?

881
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,169
Hey...

882
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,794
It must have been a bad dream.

883
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:29,335
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I saw it myself...

884
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:30,710
See...

885
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:09,002
Who are you?

886
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:11,419
Laxmmi.

887
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,169
Laxmmi?

888
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:17,794
No!

889
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:21,460
No, Leave me. Don't kill me please.

890
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:23,835
If you had messed with me alone...

891
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:26,335
...then 'Karma' would've punished you.

892
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:27,669
No!

893
01:13:27,752 --> 01:13:30,085
But you messed with my family.

894
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,877
Now I am Karma...

895
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:36,169
- Pankaj, now I am going to make you pay!
- Please let me go

896
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:37,544
No!

897
01:13:45,252 --> 01:13:47,377
Baba, when are you coming home?

898
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:49,669
It's the inauguration
of our new building.

899
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:51,210
We need to perform a veneration.

900
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:52,919
I will return in two days.

901
01:13:53,044 --> 01:13:55,252
I'll send you a list
of items for the veneration.

902
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:59,669
And listen, you'll only benefit from the
veneration when the entire family takes part.

903
01:13:59,752 --> 01:14:00,627
Yes, Baba.

904
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:03,669
- Just come over.
- Okay.

905
01:14:06,919 --> 01:14:07,794
Pankaj...

906
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:11,710
Sir, Pankaj didn't show up today
and his phone's also switched off.

907
01:14:13,627 --> 01:14:16,044
He must be drunk out of his wits,
brother.

908
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:18,044
He'll come back once he's sober again.

909
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:21,585
He's never done this before.

910
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:31,002
Our geyser's not working.

911
01:14:31,627 --> 01:14:33,085
Can I use your bathroom?

912
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:33,960
Yes.

913
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:36,919
Asif. Asif.

914
01:14:38,252 --> 01:14:41,585
What were you doing last night
on the terrace wearing bangles?

915
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:50,960
You should see a doctor.

916
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:54,460
Me...

917
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:55,627
I... Listen...

918
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:02,127
Why is he telling me to see a doctor?

919
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:04,085
But no one's going to believe me.

920
01:15:04,627 --> 01:15:06,585
He's clearly denying it was him.

921
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,585
I think I should go see a doctor.

922
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:13,794
But I am sure it was him. I am sure...

923
01:15:14,085 --> 01:15:17,294
What is he doing in there for so long?

924
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:30,460
I left my shampoo inside.

925
01:15:30,745 --> 01:15:32,169
Don't use it.

926
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:58,169
Turmeric!!!

927
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:13,210
We must tell her.

928
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,085
- Yes, it's important.
- There. There.

929
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:18,127
You know, there was turmeric
all over the bathroom floor.

930
01:16:18,294 --> 01:16:20,419
I nearly slipped and fell.

931
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:22,919
And she is sitting here peacefully...look

932
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:28,127
Do you know what
Asif did in my bathroom?

933
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,419
- What did he do?
- What?

934
01:16:32,002 --> 01:16:33,669
He went to bathe in my bathroom.

935
01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:35,210
I had kept a bowl of turmeric.

936
01:16:35,335 --> 01:16:37,627
He applied the turmeric
all over his body.

937
01:16:38,335 --> 01:16:40,752
I am telling you Rashmi,
something's not right.

938
01:16:42,502 --> 01:16:43,419
What is she saying, mom?

939
01:16:43,544 --> 01:16:44,627
She's been blabbing like this
since yesterday about bangles, and...

940
01:16:44,752 --> 01:16:45,960
Bangles!

941
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:51,210
Mom, he was wearing bangles and dancing
last night and walking on the terrace. I swear.

942
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:55,502
And he was draping a sari on
himself like a female in the sari shop.

943
01:16:55,627 --> 01:16:56,585
He slapped me.

944
01:16:56,765 --> 01:16:57,377
Yes.

945
01:16:57,502 --> 01:17:00,627
- Really. I swear.
- I swear.

946
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,502
If you guys don't like
Asif then just say it.

947
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:05,294
Don't falsely accuse him.

948
01:17:05,419 --> 01:17:07,752
Why would we falsely accuse him?

949
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:08,669
Move.

950
01:17:08,794 --> 01:17:12,502
I mean...mom,
I was going to say I've an idea.

951
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:13,794
I have an idea.

952
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:15,002
Where is Asif?

953
01:17:15,127 --> 01:17:16,377
- Where did he go?
- Why?

954
01:17:16,794 --> 01:17:18,044
Tell me, please.

955
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:20,294
He's gone to meet Khaleel
and will be back by evening.

956
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:21,127
Very good.

957
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:24,627
When he comes back, we'll send
him to the guest bathroom to freshen up.

958
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,544
I'll keep a bowl of turmeric.

959
01:17:26,627 --> 01:17:29,544
And see for yourself how
he bathes with the turmeric.

960
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:36,253
- He'll never say no to you.
- I will not say.

961
01:17:36,337 --> 01:17:38,712
I can't tell him, mom.
You tell him.

962
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,628
He respects you.

963
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,795
Just a minute.

964
01:17:42,753 --> 01:17:44,545
He's here.

965
01:17:45,049 --> 01:17:49,170
Asif. We were waiting for you.

966
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:51,295
Come, let's have dinner.

967
01:17:53,163 --> 01:17:55,420
- I'll bathe first.
- Yes...

968
01:17:59,122 --> 01:18:00,788
Asif, you must be tired.

969
01:18:00,913 --> 01:18:02,163
Use the guest bathroom instead.

970
01:18:02,288 --> 01:18:03,830
I've kept your clothes in there.

971
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:12,955
Where is my shampoo?

972
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,038
I kept it back.

973
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:25,747
Yes!

974
01:18:26,038 --> 01:18:28,288
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's go.

975
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,580
- Papa. Come on.
- Rashmi, come on.

976
01:19:02,997 --> 01:19:05,080
You didn't believe me, did you?

977
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:08,163
See what your husband's up to.

978
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,788
Come and take a look.

979
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,413
Rashmi... Rashmi... look...

980
01:19:40,163 --> 01:19:41,205
Careful.

981
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:13,580
Hail Lord. Hail Lord. Hail Lord.

982
01:20:15,455 --> 01:20:18,455
What? Let's go. Come on.

983
01:20:31,872 --> 01:20:33,080
- He's here.
- He's here.

984
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:35,122
Talk to him.

985
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:39,844
What's wrong, sister-in-law?
Why are your hands trembling?

986
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:42,205
No, that's not it.

987
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:47,760
Why is everyone staring at me?

988
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,635
Brother-in-law, stop staring
at me and stare at your food.

989
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,302
Don't jinx my food. Come on.

990
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:54,677
Asif.

991
01:20:56,093 --> 01:20:58,093
Ashwini said that two nights ago...

992
01:20:58,218 --> 01:21:00,010
...you were wearing bangles
and walking on the terrace.

993
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:03,052
Ah yes, you said the same
thing to me in the morning.

994
01:21:03,427 --> 01:21:04,635
When was I in the terrace?

995
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:06,218
She saw you.

996
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:08,635
You wore a sari in the
showroom in front of everyone

997
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:13,052
And you applied turmeric
all over your body in the bathroom?

998
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,718
Mother-in-law,
did you have one drink too many?

999
01:21:16,843 --> 01:21:19,510
Excuse, why are your feet yellow?

1000
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,718
Why are you hiding them now?

1001
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:25,135
Why are behaving like females?

1002
01:21:25,215 --> 01:21:28,010
Stop lying.
We all saw you applying turmeric.

1003
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:30,593
I saw you dancing on
the terrace wearing bangles.

1004
01:21:30,673 --> 01:21:32,343
What are you up to Asif?

1005
01:21:40,677 --> 01:21:41,968
So you all know.

1006
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:45,135
Well, that's a good thing.

1007
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:48,010
Come, let's eat.

1008
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,343
Why are you talking like that, Asif?

1009
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:52,843
Dancing on the terrace! Wearing a sari!

1010
01:21:52,968 --> 01:21:54,177
Applying turmeric!
Why are you behaving this way?

1011
01:21:54,302 --> 01:21:55,302
Answer me!

1012
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:58,302
- Take your hands off.
- Answer me!

1013
01:21:58,677 --> 01:22:00,760
- Take your hands off.
- Answer me!

1014
01:22:01,135 --> 01:22:02,968
- Take your hands off.
- Answer me!

1015
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,510
Take your hands off!

1016
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,097
How dare you hit a woman?

1017
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,763
Now I'll show you.

1018
01:22:16,888 --> 01:22:18,055
Let's see how you feel.

1019
01:22:22,763 --> 01:22:25,930
Deepak. Deepak. Deepak.

1020
01:22:29,347 --> 01:22:32,347
So...are you seeing stars?

1021
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,097
Your mouth's twisted.

1022
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:37,930
Ashwini, your husband, this idiot...

1023
01:22:38,638 --> 01:22:41,222
He's twisted, but he's yours.

1024
01:22:43,097 --> 01:22:45,222
Don't kill him. Let him go.

1025
01:22:45,347 --> 01:22:46,222
No...

1026
01:22:46,347 --> 01:22:47,055
Yes.

1027
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:53,888
Get out!

1028
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:56,055
He hit me!

1029
01:22:57,888 --> 01:22:59,888
He hit me!

1030
01:23:02,263 --> 01:23:03,472
Idiot!

1031
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,638
How dare he hit a woman.

1032
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:16,055
Tell me, granny, if someone touches you,
won't you hit him?

1033
01:23:17,013 --> 01:23:18,930
- Won't you hit him?
- No!

1034
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,597
- Huh...
- I will hit him! I will...

1035
01:23:21,722 --> 01:23:23,097
Yes!

1036
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:25,347
Look at him lying there like a bull.

1037
01:23:26,388 --> 01:23:27,930
I just want to break his face....

1038
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:50,555
Who cooked the lentil?

1039
01:23:53,388 --> 01:23:54,305
This fatso

1040
01:23:54,888 --> 01:23:55,513
Was it you?

1041
01:23:56,638 --> 01:23:59,472
Hey granny, I asked who made it?

1042
01:23:59,597 --> 01:24:00,972
I did. I did.

1043
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,680
It's delicious.

1044
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:20,722
Who is he?

1045
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,805
Who is he?

1046
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:34,555
Son, why are you eating...
with your...left hand?

1047
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,888
- Mom...you're a good cook.
- Yes.

1048
01:24:58,763 --> 01:24:59,847
Thank you.

1049
01:25:04,972 --> 01:25:07,972
Chintu, you come and eat too.

1050
01:25:08,222 --> 01:25:09,055
Come on.

1051
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:13,763
Who is this now?

1052
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:16,847
Wow...! Chicken lollypop!

1053
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:20,388
Aunty, can I take a chicken lollypop?

1054
01:25:20,513 --> 01:25:21,263
Yes.

1055
01:25:25,222 --> 01:25:26,763
But I won't eat here.

1056
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:27,888
I'll eat there.

1057
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,347
I'll sit here and eat.

1058
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:31,930
Chetak. Come here.

1059
01:25:32,347 --> 01:25:34,138
Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

1060
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:35,638
Lets Run. Quick

1061
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,305
You've been asking too many questions.

1062
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,847
"Why are you wearing bangles?"

1063
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:46,888
"Why did you apply turmeric?"

1064
01:25:46,972 --> 01:25:48,097
"Why did you wear a sari?"

1065
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:51,847
I've come here for an important job.

1066
01:25:52,097 --> 01:25:56,430
If anyone interferes
or tries to disrupt my work...

1067
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,972
If anyone tries to interfere in my work...

1068
01:26:01,097 --> 01:26:04,013
If anyone tries to stop me...

1069
01:26:04,222 --> 01:26:05,888
...then he'll get a beating.

1070
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:08,138
Okay.

1071
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,138
See you.

1072
01:26:09,263 --> 01:26:10,972
I have to go and kill someone

1073
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,763
Bye, mama.

1074
01:26:13,722 --> 01:26:14,263
Bye.

1075
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,513
Bye...

1076
01:26:27,597 --> 01:26:28,722
Hello, how are you sir?

1077
01:26:28,972 --> 01:26:30,055
Keys... please.

1078
01:26:31,513 --> 01:26:33,222
- It's really very nice.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1079
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,138
Thank you.

1080
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:35,055
Come.

1081
01:27:03,722 --> 01:27:04,430
Come.

1082
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,597
You've stopped calling me these days.

1083
01:27:08,722 --> 01:27:09,680
You don't either.

1084
01:27:09,805 --> 01:27:10,805
Okay.

1085
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:28,388
Nothing.

1086
01:27:28,513 --> 01:27:29,055
Yeah...

1087
01:27:29,305 --> 01:27:30,055
Come on.

1088
01:27:30,763 --> 01:27:32,513
Let's have a drink.
And then order food.

1089
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:34,680
I am starving.

1090
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,847
It's nothing.
Just a power fluctuation, that's all.

1091
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,305
Ohh...I was scared.

1092
01:27:55,055 --> 01:27:57,013
Why were you scared? I am here!

1093
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,097
Who is it?

1094
01:28:02,388 --> 01:28:04,263
Who is it?
- Who is there?

1095
01:28:05,347 --> 01:28:06,513
Who is it?

1096
01:29:00,138 --> 01:29:01,305
Who were they?

1097
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,055
That was my father, she was my mother.

1098
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:06,055
My entire family's here to have dinner.

1099
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,222
Then I am leaving.

1100
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,388
Then get lost.

1101
01:29:08,513 --> 01:29:10,013
The hell with you. Disgusting.

1102
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:12,930
Will you leave if I tell you to?

1103
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:14,722
I am scared.

1104
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,388
If you're scared, then let's just leave.

1105
01:29:18,847 --> 01:29:19,972
Will he come back?

1106
01:29:33,805 --> 01:29:36,472
Son, get up. I must use the bathroom...

1107
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,388
Hail Sri Krishna!
Hail Sri Krishna! Hail Sri Krishna!

1108
01:29:44,972 --> 01:29:45,930
It's me.

1109
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:46,930
Rashmi.

1110
01:29:47,305 --> 01:29:48,055
Thank you.

1111
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:51,013
Papa, we must do something.

1112
01:29:51,138 --> 01:29:54,097
Yes, dear.
We had wrong notions about Asif.

1113
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:57,138
He's not a bad person,
he's just possessed by an evil spirit.

1114
01:29:57,638 --> 01:29:59,305
We should help him out together.

1115
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,388
Yes...

1116
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:03,680
Today We'll take him
to Shahnawaz the shaman.

1117
01:30:03,805 --> 01:30:06,597
Yes, mom, he asked us to come after two days.

1118
01:30:06,888 --> 01:30:09,263
But...we'll have to take Asif to him.

1119
01:30:09,388 --> 01:30:10,305
Yes.

1120
01:30:10,597 --> 01:30:13,722
Is he Asif or is he...

1121
01:30:13,847 --> 01:30:14,888
How would I know?

1122
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:18,680
You know what, let's go check together.

1123
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:21,847
Go see.

1124
01:30:33,638 --> 01:30:35,305
Why is everyone standing in a queue?

1125
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:36,430
Where is Rashmi?

1126
01:30:36,555 --> 01:30:39,055
Rashmi, can I get some medicine?

1127
01:30:39,263 --> 01:30:41,847
I've a headache and body ache.
It's puzzling.

1128
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:44,180
We take the beating,
and he feels the pain.

1129
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:49,930
Asif, look what's wrong with Deepak.

1130
01:30:50,013 --> 01:30:52,138
He isn't feeling well.
His mouth...

1131
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:53,930
Why is his mouth twisted?

1132
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:55,388
He's not well.

1133
01:30:55,513 --> 01:30:58,055
So we've to take him to the Shaman.

1134
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,513
Because If we don't,
he'll lose his mind completely.

1135
01:31:00,972 --> 01:31:03,305
- So we're taking him there.
- Why take him to a shaman?

1136
01:31:04,222 --> 01:31:05,430
Take him to a doctor instead.

1137
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:06,847
On second thought, go ahead.

1138
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:07,930
You should come too.

1139
01:31:08,013 --> 01:31:08,888
Who said that?

1140
01:31:11,722 --> 01:31:15,013
When the family is in trouble,
shouldn't you support them?

1141
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:20,638
Fine, I'll go get ready.

1142
01:31:42,722 --> 01:31:43,597
Greetings.

1143
01:32:19,513 --> 01:32:22,930
Mom, I'll go buy a
blanket for the offering.

1144
01:32:23,013 --> 01:32:24,388
Yes, of course.

1145
01:32:38,138 --> 01:32:39,513
Asif, let's go inside.

1146
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:45,013
Deepak... Let's go.
Push him. Push him.

1147
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:47,055
Asif, let's go inside.

1148
01:32:47,513 --> 01:32:50,722
Asif, you must go inside.

1149
01:32:50,972 --> 01:32:51,722
Leave me.

1150
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:56,847
- Asif, let's go inside.
- Leave me.

1151
01:32:58,763 --> 01:33:00,930
Asif, you must go inside with me.

1152
01:33:02,888 --> 01:33:05,013
Let go my hand.

1153
01:33:05,138 --> 01:33:06,805
Asif, you must go inside.

1154
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:07,513
Let go my hand.

1155
01:33:10,347 --> 01:33:11,430
Asif, you must go inside.

1156
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:13,263
Please listen to me. Let's go inside.
Let's go together.

1157
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:14,472
Quiet.

1158
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,472
Come inside.

1159
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:17,222
No.

1160
01:33:17,513 --> 01:33:19,305
I said come inside.

1161
01:33:19,597 --> 01:33:19,930
No.

1162
01:33:20,013 --> 01:33:20,972
Come inside!

1163
01:33:26,847 --> 01:33:27,930
Come inside!

1164
01:33:28,388 --> 01:33:29,305
Come inside!

1165
01:33:29,847 --> 01:33:30,597
No.

1166
01:33:41,888 --> 01:33:44,555
No, no...

1167
01:33:51,138 --> 01:33:52,388
The ghost is gone, mother.

1168
01:33:52,513 --> 01:33:54,430
Baba... Baba... is the ghost gone?

1169
01:33:54,555 --> 01:33:54,972
No.

1170
01:33:55,555 --> 01:33:57,138
He's too powerful.

1171
01:33:57,347 --> 01:33:59,263
- There's much left to do.
- Oh, God.

1172
01:33:59,388 --> 01:34:00,930
What else do we need to do?

1173
01:34:01,138 --> 01:34:04,055
I'll come to your house
tomorrow and perform a veneration.

1174
01:34:05,805 --> 01:34:06,388
Allah!

1175
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,384
Hello.

1176
01:34:52,577 --> 01:34:54,217
Tawde. Open.

1177
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:22,044
I want their murderers in two days.

1178
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:24,502
Or else you are next.

1179
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,728
No.

1180
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:16,214
Uncle, why are you wasting time
here instead of praying at the mosque.

1181
01:36:17,005 --> 01:36:18,714
What? Why are you staring at me?

1182
01:36:23,255 --> 01:36:27,819
Listen, this time you get lost, not me.

1183
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:29,005
Do you know why?

1184
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:31,255
Because you might
be the king of your area...

1185
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:33,214
...but here...

1186
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:37,854
Lights...

1187
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,654
I am the queen.

1188
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:47,732
Live life queen size!

1189
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,339
Stop all this!

1190
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:00,297
Hey...

1191
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:01,922
I said...

1192
01:37:02,214 --> 01:37:03,464
Stop it!

1193
01:37:03,589 --> 01:37:05,714
Enough of this charade.

1194
01:37:05,839 --> 01:37:08,464
Come on, leave my house.

1195
01:37:08,714 --> 01:37:10,130
Are you all deaf?

1196
01:37:10,547 --> 01:37:16,422
Salim uncle,
as always your daughter Firdaus

1197
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:19,964
will be waiting on Junaidpur
Railway station platform.

1198
01:37:20,214 --> 01:37:25,964
But as far as I know,
she is standing on the railway tracks.

1199
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:27,755
Don't believe me?

1200
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:32,130
Fine, watch this Live TV footage.

1201
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:33,880
Watch.

1202
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,880
This is live TV footage.

1203
01:37:36,005 --> 01:37:38,255
My daughter! My child.

1204
01:37:38,505 --> 01:37:39,839
Let her go.

1205
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:41,980
Let my child go.

1206
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,464
Don't listen to him.

1207
01:37:44,339 --> 01:37:45,505
Keep praying.

1208
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,839
No! My daughter!

1209
01:37:48,422 --> 01:37:49,255
Keep praying.

1210
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,247
- Don't listen to him.
- My child.

1211
01:37:50,327 --> 01:37:50,766
Keep praying.

1212
01:37:50,846 --> 01:37:52,047
- Let me go.
- This is not the truth.

1213
01:37:52,172 --> 01:37:53,964
Do I let her go? Do I?

1214
01:37:54,089 --> 01:37:55,880
Do I let the train crush her?

1215
01:37:56,005 --> 01:37:56,589
No.

1216
01:37:56,714 --> 01:37:57,755
Let my daughter go.

1217
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,422
- Well, I'll let the train run over her.
- Let my daughter go.

1218
01:38:00,505 --> 01:38:01,964
- Let her go.
- Let her go?

1219
01:38:02,089 --> 01:38:03,630
For God's sake...

1220
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:11,464
Now, remember the next
train is due in 10 minutes.

1221
01:38:11,714 --> 01:38:13,755
I'll give you one chance.

1222
01:38:13,835 --> 01:38:15,422
Go and save your daughter.

1223
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:17,130
Hurry up.

1224
01:38:17,554 --> 01:38:20,422
- Keep praying.
- Your daughter's going to die! Run!

1225
01:38:20,505 --> 01:38:21,875
He's creating illusions with his powers.

1226
01:38:21,955 --> 01:38:23,714
Your daughter is fine.

1227
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,380
Don't go. Stop.

1228
01:38:25,464 --> 01:38:26,755
Stop.

1229
01:38:27,365 --> 01:38:30,047
I guess everyone's missing their family.

1230
01:38:31,714 --> 01:38:33,964
Do you want to know what they are doing?

1231
01:38:34,089 --> 01:38:35,067
Then watch.

1232
01:38:42,755 --> 01:38:44,297
Mother.

1233
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:46,380
Don't do that.

1234
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,797
- My son.
- Keep praying.

1235
01:38:48,877 --> 01:38:50,047
Let my daughter go.

1236
01:38:50,286 --> 01:38:51,589
Keep praying. Keep praying.

1237
01:38:51,714 --> 01:38:52,797
What's going on?

1238
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:55,505
I've small kids.

1239
01:38:55,585 --> 01:38:57,675
- Keep praying.
- Run. Run.

1240
01:38:57,755 --> 01:39:00,964
Run away. Run away from my home.
I said leave.

1241
01:39:01,089 --> 01:39:03,797
Get out. Leave.

1242
01:39:03,877 --> 01:39:06,172
Leave.

1243
01:39:14,672 --> 01:39:17,422
Fatso, when will you go?

1244
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:21,422
You can toy with my people but not with me.

1245
01:39:21,814 --> 01:39:25,880
I've no weakness which
you can use to overpower me.

1246
01:39:26,547 --> 01:39:32,297
But I do have the power to weaken you.

1247
01:39:33,422 --> 01:39:36,047
I have Holy water blessed by Baba.

1248
01:39:40,422 --> 01:39:42,130
No! Not that.

1249
01:39:42,339 --> 01:39:44,839
Come out of Asif's body.

1250
01:39:45,664 --> 01:39:46,047
Come out.

1251
01:39:46,172 --> 01:39:47,755
Listen to me...

1252
01:39:48,172 --> 01:39:49,464
Don't mess with me.

1253
01:39:49,672 --> 01:39:51,964
I said...don't throw
that water on me.

1254
01:39:52,089 --> 01:39:53,547
Come out of Asif's body.

1255
01:39:53,672 --> 01:39:55,670
Hey fatso...
don't throw that water on me.

1256
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:56,589
I said come out!

1257
01:39:56,714 --> 01:39:57,880
I won't go.

1258
01:39:58,005 --> 01:39:59,005
Come out.

1259
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:01,422
This is my home. I won't go.

1260
01:40:01,547 --> 01:40:03,922
Okay, okay...
I'll come out. I'll come out.

1261
01:40:04,047 --> 01:40:04,922
I'll come out.

1262
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,255
I said I'll come out.

1263
01:40:15,214 --> 01:40:17,172
Come on.

1264
01:40:18,604 --> 01:40:20,589
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1265
01:40:26,964 --> 01:40:29,964
Tell me who you are?
Why did you come here?

1266
01:40:30,255 --> 01:40:31,880
What is your name?

1267
01:40:32,255 --> 01:40:32,880
Tell me!

1268
01:40:33,172 --> 01:40:35,505
I'll tell you.
I will tell you everything.

1269
01:40:36,214 --> 01:40:39,589
My name is Laxmii.

1270
01:40:50,297 --> 01:40:51,297
Run.

1271
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:30,714
- How dare you...trouble her.
- Stop, mother.

1272
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:36,380
Instead of assuming
that a transgender is a curse...

1273
01:41:36,464 --> 01:41:39,630
...she's dedicated her life
for the good of the society.

1274
01:41:39,755 --> 01:41:46,297
Men like you wouldn't spare
anyone or anything wearing a sari.

1275
01:41:48,172 --> 01:41:50,297
And what did you tell Geeta?

1276
01:41:50,797 --> 01:41:54,047
Transgender is supposed
to beg and cheer.

1277
01:41:54,214 --> 01:41:55,339
Listen, everyone.

1278
01:41:55,755 --> 01:42:00,922
The 2014 election provision form now
has three columns instead of two.

1279
01:42:01,179 --> 01:42:03,797
Male...Female...and Transgender.

1280
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:07,505
Now we'll run for elections and win.

1281
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:11,797
And we'll do what you
couldn't do in all these years.

1282
01:42:11,922 --> 01:42:13,005
We transgender.

1283
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:15,505
You men can keep cheering.

1284
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,214
And you... you...

1285
01:42:19,089 --> 01:42:22,068
- Mother... Please, mother, let him go.
- Move. Move.

1286
01:42:22,148 --> 01:42:24,089
- Move, Geeta...
- Laxmii.

1287
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:25,297
Stop!

1288
01:42:26,422 --> 01:42:28,297
Do you want to get arrested
after killing him?

1289
01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:31,005
Throw away the stone. Throw it away.

1290
01:42:31,339 --> 01:42:35,172
Abdul uncle was the
only one I listened to.

1291
01:42:36,169 --> 01:42:38,297
My own parents disowned me.

1292
01:42:38,549 --> 01:42:40,464
Come on...come on...get out!

1293
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,839
Get out.

1294
01:42:44,172 --> 01:42:45,294
Get out of my house!

1295
01:42:45,374 --> 01:42:46,062
Get out.

1296
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:46,880
Quiet.

1297
01:42:47,505 --> 01:42:49,839
If I tell him to wear a watch,
he wears bangles!

1298
01:42:49,964 --> 01:42:52,214
If I tell him to wear pants,
he wears a skirt!

1299
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,547
If I tell him to use talcum powder,
he uses turmeric!

1300
01:42:56,081 --> 01:42:57,964
All his actions are that of a female!

1301
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:00,255
I am cursed to have you.

1302
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:04,797
Father, every day when you beat me,

1303
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:07,797
I feel something is lacking in me.

1304
01:43:08,487 --> 01:43:12,777
I try to change myself, but I can't.

1305
01:43:13,261 --> 01:43:15,464
God has made me like this, father.

1306
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:21,755
I've read this happens due to hormones.

1307
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,797
This is not my fault, father.

1308
01:43:24,056 --> 01:43:28,047
Science! Science!
Trying to teach your father right and wrong!

1309
01:43:28,277 --> 01:43:29,795
Get out of my house!

1310
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,005
- Get out!
- He didn't listen to me.

1311
01:43:31,464 --> 01:43:34,339
How could I explain to
him that God made me like this?

1312
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:37,089
Sir, can I get something to eat?

1313
01:43:37,214 --> 01:43:38,255
Get lost!

1314
01:43:41,768 --> 01:43:42,259
Son...

1315
01:43:45,524 --> 01:43:46,297
are you hungry?

1316
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:47,089
Yes.

1317
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:51,765
- ABCDEFG...HIJK...
- Come. This is my house.

1318
01:43:51,845 --> 01:43:54,797
He wasn't my family or kin.

1319
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:58,630
But he heard the whimper
of a starving kid and took me home.

1320
01:43:58,755 --> 01:44:01,505
I want to eat, father. I'm hungry.

1321
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:04,380
Your food is ready. See.

1322
01:44:04,547 --> 01:44:06,547
And here is your favourite.

1323
01:44:06,672 --> 01:44:07,797
Chicken lollypop.

1324
01:44:08,005 --> 01:44:09,922
And this is for you

1325
01:44:10,591 --> 01:44:11,089
Eat.

1326
01:44:12,172 --> 01:44:12,880
Say hello.

1327
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:13,839
Hi.

1328
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:16,380
Me too.

1329
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:23,839
He's different.

1330
01:44:25,419 --> 01:44:26,672
He has a weak mind.

1331
01:44:27,672 --> 01:44:28,297
Eat.

1332
01:44:36,005 --> 01:44:37,047
Why are you crying?

1333
01:44:37,755 --> 01:44:39,214
I am different,

1334
01:44:40,714 --> 01:44:44,505
that's why my father
cast me out of the house.

1335
01:44:46,547 --> 01:44:48,172
I am a stigma on him.

1336
01:44:48,297 --> 01:44:49,380
Stigma?

1337
01:44:50,339 --> 01:44:52,464
On the contrary, you're a miracle.

1338
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,005
When a man's born, he's called 'Shiv'...

1339
01:44:56,533 --> 01:44:58,922
...and a woman's called 'Shakti'.

1340
01:44:59,729 --> 01:45:01,586
But they both dwell in you.

1341
01:45:02,676 --> 01:45:04,755
You're 'Ardhnareshwar' (God).

1342
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:07,089
You are Ardhnareshwar.

1343
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:11,214
What's your name?

1344
01:45:13,422 --> 01:45:14,765
Laxman Sharma.

1345
01:45:23,877 --> 01:45:26,460
From today you're no longer Laxman Sharma,...

1346
01:45:27,857 --> 01:45:29,684
...but Laxmii Sharma.

1347
01:45:34,279 --> 01:45:38,002
I stayed up all night thinking
about our baseless society.

1348
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:41,293
How they are afraid
of accepting people like us.

1349
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:42,752
It's true.

1350
01:45:43,156 --> 01:45:46,252
Society hates us because we beg.

1351
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:48,556
And do other wrong deeds.

1352
01:45:48,848 --> 01:45:51,973
So I decided not to follow that path.

1353
01:45:52,473 --> 01:45:54,139
Then I met Geeta.

1354
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,514
Even her parents had cast her out.

1355
01:45:56,764 --> 01:45:59,014
Abdul uncle, she is Geeta.

1356
01:46:00,014 --> 01:46:01,348
She is also like me.

1357
01:46:01,889 --> 01:46:03,639
But I want her study.

1358
01:46:10,306 --> 01:46:15,598
Geeta and her mother used their
life savings to buy a piece of land...

1359
01:46:15,723 --> 01:46:21,973
...where she's going to build a school,
hospital and housing centre for transgender.

1360
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:26,306
Geeta will fly to Delhi tomorrow
and discuss the party's agenda

1361
01:46:26,431 --> 01:46:29,848
with our leaders for the
upcoming election campaign.

1362
01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:34,556
I will request Geeta to
come on stage and say a few words.

1363
01:46:55,598 --> 01:46:57,181
I am overjoyed.

1364
01:46:57,931 --> 01:46:59,922
Our dreams are finally taking shape.

1365
01:47:01,098 --> 01:47:02,473
And all the credit goes to

1366
01:47:05,514 --> 01:47:06,848
my mother.

1367
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:11,057
Mother, please come up here.

1368
01:47:58,883 --> 01:48:00,966
First of all, hello to everyone.

1369
01:48:02,966 --> 01:48:09,508
After reaching a stage in life,
it's crucial to stay there for a while.

1370
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:12,674
And look back.

1371
01:48:13,655 --> 01:48:18,383
And thank the people who helped you.

1372
01:48:22,508 --> 01:48:27,216
And I would like to thank
Abdul uncle first.

1373
01:48:32,966 --> 01:48:36,383
Who gave shelter to two orphans.

1374
01:48:36,828 --> 01:48:38,299
Raised us.

1375
01:48:40,299 --> 01:48:44,924
And made Geeta capable of doing
something for the transgender.

1376
01:48:48,591 --> 01:48:51,341
Secondly, I want to thank Geeta...

1377
01:48:53,008 --> 01:48:57,216
...who made transgenders
proud with her hard work.

1378
01:48:58,258 --> 01:49:04,341
And proved if we're given
a chance the sky is the limit for us.

1379
01:49:09,216 --> 01:49:11,299
People call us transgender,

1380
01:49:12,716 --> 01:49:13,674
eunuchs,

1381
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:16,716
and other names.

1382
01:49:23,036 --> 01:49:26,799
When my father found
out that I am different...

1383
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:31,008
...he threw me out of the house.

1384
01:49:32,193 --> 01:49:33,508
He disowned me.

1385
01:49:36,798 --> 01:49:38,716
If he had put me through school...

1386
01:49:39,036 --> 01:49:41,049
...then even I would've been
an engineer or doctor today.

1387
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:50,633
I neither boozed, gambled
or kill someone that he punished me.

1388
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:54,799
God made me like this.

1389
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:58,383
It's not my fault.

1390
01:50:11,285 --> 01:50:15,508
But if anyone has children like us,

1391
01:50:16,679 --> 01:50:18,216
please don't disown them.

1392
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,383
Give them education like other children.

1393
01:50:23,685 --> 01:50:26,674
Every child gets the wings to fly

1394
01:50:27,418 --> 01:50:32,168
and the fear of heights
from their parents.

1395
01:50:34,209 --> 01:50:35,543
The choice is yours.

1396
01:50:36,668 --> 01:50:39,543
What do you want to give your children?

1397
01:50:40,126 --> 01:50:42,043
What do you want to give them?

1398
01:50:49,753 --> 01:50:51,251
Superb!

1399
01:51:02,876 --> 01:51:04,459
Geeta, have you reached?

1400
01:51:05,168 --> 01:51:06,168
All the best.

1401
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,293
And take care.

1402
01:51:08,876 --> 01:51:10,584
Laxmii.

1403
01:51:11,334 --> 01:51:13,043
Someone's taken over your land.

1404
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:12,756
Are you Girja?

1405
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:13,798
Stop her!

1406
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,631
Come on!

1407
01:52:33,048 --> 01:52:33,923
Hey...

1408
01:52:34,423 --> 01:52:36,381
I toiled hard to buy that piece of land.

1409
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:38,590
Aren't you ashamed
to usurp a transgender's land?

1410
01:52:39,548 --> 01:52:40,298
Hey!

1411
01:52:40,673 --> 01:52:42,215
Don't try to be a hero
with your goggles on.

1412
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,590
Get lost.
Come on.

1413
01:52:43,827 --> 01:52:44,798
Why you...

1414
01:52:47,022 --> 01:52:47,881
You fool.

1415
01:52:48,298 --> 01:52:50,090
You said Laxmii is a woman.

1416
01:52:50,962 --> 01:52:52,298
You didn't tell me she is transgender.

1417
01:52:53,215 --> 01:52:54,923
Do you know what a big sin we committed?

1418
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,965
Her curse could've
turned our lives into hell.

1419
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,340
You're absolutely right.

1420
01:53:00,965 --> 01:53:02,340
We don't want them to curse us.

1421
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,548
Here.

1422
01:53:03,798 --> 01:53:06,340
Return the land to her and apologise.

1423
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:12,173
We made a big mistake.

1424
01:53:12,298 --> 01:53:14,131
I did it for her sake.

1425
01:53:14,465 --> 01:53:18,340
If she wants to return the land,
Then I won't interfere.

1426
01:53:18,881 --> 01:53:22,048
You'll never face any problems from us.

1427
01:53:27,631 --> 01:53:29,506
I got too violent in a fit of rage!

1428
01:53:31,298 --> 01:53:32,548
I am so stupid.

1429
01:53:33,756 --> 01:53:35,381
I was completely wrong about you.

1430
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,548
Please forgive me if you can.

1431
01:53:41,798 --> 01:53:43,090
Here are your papers.

1432
01:53:43,381 --> 01:53:44,965
Ohh...

1433
01:53:45,215 --> 01:53:46,715
No. I'll pick it.

1434
01:54:16,006 --> 01:54:17,381
Laxmii.

1435
01:54:17,506 --> 01:54:19,256
Laxmii.

1436
01:54:19,673 --> 01:54:21,173
Laxmii.

1437
01:54:23,006 --> 01:54:24,673
Abdul uncle...

1438
01:54:26,423 --> 01:54:30,215
These people usurped our land.

1439
01:54:31,548 --> 01:54:33,340
When I came here,

1440
01:54:33,798 --> 01:54:36,381
they made fake promises
about returning the land.

1441
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:40,090
And stabbed me.

1442
01:54:42,548 --> 01:54:44,673
They are monsters!

1443
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:48,048
Hey...

1444
01:54:54,215 --> 01:54:55,965
Abdul uncle!

1445
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:06,423
Abdul uncle!

1446
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,298
Father. Father.

1447
01:55:10,923 --> 01:55:12,840
Father. Father.

1448
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,423
You killed my father.

1449
01:55:17,673 --> 01:55:19,923
- I won't spare you.
- Why you...

1450
01:55:20,048 --> 01:55:21,256
You killed my father.

1451
01:55:21,381 --> 01:55:22,548
I won't spare you.

1452
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,006
Hey...

1453
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,298
Did you really think all this is true?

1454
01:55:33,256 --> 01:55:34,840
We're playing a game.

1455
01:55:34,923 --> 01:55:35,840
Game...

1456
01:55:36,215 --> 01:55:36,923
Do you want to play too?

1457
01:55:38,506 --> 01:55:39,173
Cops and robbers.

1458
01:55:40,256 --> 01:55:41,548
See...what I have?

1459
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:43,923
Gun.

1460
01:55:47,423 --> 01:55:47,965
Gun.

1461
01:55:48,256 --> 01:55:51,840
First, shoot me, then shoot yourself.

1462
01:55:53,756 --> 01:55:55,340
- Come on.
- We'll play a game.

1463
01:55:55,798 --> 01:55:56,423
Game.

1464
01:55:56,965 --> 01:55:58,465
Come on.

1465
01:55:58,590 --> 01:55:59,965
- Let him go.
- Shoot. Shoot.

1466
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:01,965
Yes.

1467
01:56:03,533 --> 01:56:04,340
Come on.

1468
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,298
See...game.

1469
01:56:08,923 --> 01:56:10,215
Now shoot yourself.

1470
01:56:10,423 --> 01:56:11,798
Shoot yourself.

1471
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,840
Laxmii, you don't know anything.

1472
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:17,673
We'll play this game.

1473
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,256
Yes...shoot yourself.

1474
01:56:21,381 --> 01:56:24,506
Shoot. Shoot.

1475
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:26,381
Let him go.

1476
01:56:27,232 --> 01:56:28,131
Shoot.

1477
01:56:28,256 --> 01:56:32,715
ABCDEFG...

1478
01:56:32,798 --> 01:56:34,548
- JKLMNOP...
- Shoot.

1479
01:56:35,051 --> 01:56:36,732
- Shoot. It's just a game.
- QRSTW...

1480
01:56:36,812 --> 01:56:38,173
Bravo. Shoot.

1481
01:56:38,587 --> 01:56:39,840
Just a game.

1482
01:57:00,173 --> 01:57:02,590
I won't spare you!

1483
01:57:05,266 --> 01:57:07,340
Brother. Let's throw these bodies in the sea.

1484
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:12,215
If the body gets washed up the shore,
it can attract the Police.

1485
01:57:15,173 --> 01:57:18,006
Laxmii bought that land
with a lot of hard work.

1486
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:20,048
Bury them there.

1487
01:57:20,756 --> 01:57:22,465
It'll be some use to them.

1488
01:57:22,881 --> 01:57:24,173
It's said...

1489
01:57:24,631 --> 01:57:29,006
...it's a good omen to build something
on land where a transgender is buried.

1490
01:57:35,923 --> 01:57:41,173
They buried me in the land
which we bought with our hard work.

1491
01:57:42,048 --> 01:57:44,048
I had so many dreams
attached with that land.

1492
01:57:44,965 --> 01:57:48,048
Tell me, is this justice?

1493
01:57:52,756 --> 01:57:55,756
Laxmii, come inside this bottle?

1494
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,548
No. No.

1495
01:57:57,798 --> 01:57:58,881
- Come on.
- No.

1496
01:57:59,423 --> 01:58:00,590
Tomorrow is full moon night.

1497
01:58:00,881 --> 01:58:04,798
If I don't kill Girja tomorrow,
then Geeta will never get this land.

1498
01:58:04,881 --> 01:58:06,423
And this land is for transgender.

1499
01:58:06,548 --> 01:58:12,041
You were wronged, Laxmii,
but you can't keep killing people.

1500
01:58:12,215 --> 01:58:13,881
Allah has blessed me with a power...

1501
01:58:14,215 --> 01:58:16,317
So I can control powers like you.

1502
01:58:16,324 --> 01:58:19,673
This family came to me seeking help.

1503
01:58:20,256 --> 01:58:22,506
- I will do my duty.
- No, no.

1504
01:58:22,715 --> 01:58:23,423
Come on.

1505
01:58:23,548 --> 01:58:26,256
- No, no.
- I said, come inside the bottle.

1506
01:58:26,715 --> 01:58:27,506
I won't.

1507
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,340
Come inside this bottle.

1508
01:58:29,465 --> 01:58:31,881
I'll come.

1509
01:58:32,006 --> 01:58:33,215
- I'll come.
- Come on.

1510
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:34,798
Come on.

1511
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:38,256
Let me out.

1512
01:58:38,506 --> 01:58:39,715
Let me out.

1513
01:58:41,868 --> 01:58:44,131
I've blessed this talisman.

1514
01:58:45,162 --> 01:58:46,756
This will keep you safe.

1515
01:58:49,756 --> 01:58:50,256
No.

1516
01:58:51,424 --> 01:58:52,048
No.

1517
01:58:52,423 --> 01:58:53,340
Asif...

1518
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:57,715
...you always joked that you'll
wear bangles if you see a ghost.

1519
01:58:58,150 --> 01:58:59,048
Today you did.

1520
01:58:59,893 --> 01:59:03,298
Listen to us and wear this
for everyone's safety, Asif.

1521
01:59:03,727 --> 01:59:07,048
Please listen to him, Asif.

1522
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:10,006
Please.

1523
01:59:18,645 --> 01:59:19,756
Wear it.

1524
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,131
Don't take this thread
off for three days.

1525
01:59:27,681 --> 01:59:30,881
If you do, the spirit will come back.

1526
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:34,131
I'll go throw this bottle in the sea.

1527
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:41,548
Let me out.

1528
01:59:41,673 --> 01:59:42,965
Let me go.

1529
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:44,965
Leave me.

1530
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:46,381
Let me out.

1531
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:50,465
Let me out.

1532
01:59:51,423 --> 01:59:52,756
Let me out.

1533
01:59:55,298 --> 01:59:58,006
I won't spare you, Girja!

1534
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,997
Baba, only you can help us now.

1535
02:00:07,381 --> 02:00:09,840
Baba, my kin are dying one-by-one.

1536
02:00:10,298 --> 02:00:11,256
And now I am scared.

1537
02:00:11,601 --> 02:00:12,798
Give me a solution, Baba.

1538
02:00:19,007 --> 02:00:22,298
You killed a transgender and his family.

1539
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:25,673
And now your family members are dying.

1540
02:00:26,087 --> 02:00:27,590
She's not just a transgender.

1541
02:00:27,715 --> 02:00:29,798
Her powers have increased three-fold.

1542
02:00:31,798 --> 02:00:33,840
Baba, is there a way out of it?

1543
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:34,798
Yes, Baba.

1544
02:00:38,571 --> 02:00:39,381
There is one.

1545
02:00:41,825 --> 02:00:43,298
Today is the full moon night.

1546
02:00:43,923 --> 02:00:46,715
All the transgender
will gather by the seashore.

1547
02:00:47,756 --> 02:00:50,131
And dance around the holy fire.

1548
02:00:50,598 --> 02:00:51,881
After they leave,

1549
02:00:52,286 --> 02:00:58,090
you must dig out their bodies
and burn it in the pure fire.

1550
02:00:58,674 --> 02:01:03,548
And their souls will
attain salvation at dawn.

1551
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:06,215
And she cannot harm you.

1552
02:01:09,156 --> 02:01:11,506
Asif...Asif...Palak called.

1553
02:01:11,946 --> 02:01:13,371
Anjali's been taken to the hospital.

1554
02:01:13,451 --> 02:01:14,755
There is some pregnancy complication

1555
02:01:14,835 --> 02:01:16,298
Her husband isn't
answering his phone either.

1556
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,985
I think we should go.

1557
02:01:20,309 --> 02:01:20,506
Let's go.

1558
02:02:33,244 --> 02:02:34,968
We must get rid of those three bodies today.

1559
02:02:35,048 --> 02:02:35,916
Hurry up.

1560
02:06:19,788 --> 02:06:21,038
Look, they all have left.

1561
02:06:23,288 --> 02:06:24,871
Hey, come on. Get the bodies out.

1562
02:06:24,996 --> 02:06:25,621
Come on.

1563
02:06:26,871 --> 02:06:28,371
Hurry. Hurry.

1564
02:06:28,496 --> 02:06:30,204
- Hurry.
- Come on.

1565
02:06:32,204 --> 02:06:32,663
Come on.

1566
02:06:33,204 --> 02:06:33,871
This way.

1567
02:06:35,204 --> 02:06:36,496
Hurry. Hurry.
Come on.

1568
02:06:37,996 --> 02:06:38,579
Come on.

1569
02:06:39,288 --> 02:06:39,996
Come on.

1570
02:06:41,204 --> 02:06:42,579
Throw it in.

1571
02:07:10,329 --> 02:07:11,746
Hurry.
Come on.

1572
02:07:27,996 --> 02:07:28,954
Come on.

1573
02:07:30,371 --> 02:07:31,038
Hurry.

1574
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:33,329
Come quickly.

1575
02:08:33,454 --> 02:08:34,413
Come fast.

1576
02:08:34,621 --> 02:08:36,246
Come on.

1577
02:08:36,496 --> 02:08:38,079
Come quickly.

1578
02:08:39,538 --> 02:08:40,913
Come on, come!

1579
02:08:42,538 --> 02:08:43,413
Come on.

1580
02:08:45,621 --> 02:08:46,788
Come on Come.

1581
02:08:46,913 --> 02:08:49,121
What are you doing there?
Come fast.

1582
02:08:49,246 --> 02:08:50,454
Please come.

1583
02:08:52,788 --> 02:08:54,788
No.

1584
02:08:59,579 --> 02:09:00,788
Come, come!

1585
02:09:31,329 --> 02:09:33,329
No!

1586
02:09:54,286 --> 02:09:55,121
Temple.

1587
02:10:23,913 --> 02:10:25,204
Where is Laxmii?

1588
02:10:25,538 --> 02:10:27,163
Call him. Call him.

1589
02:10:27,288 --> 02:10:28,163
Where is she?

1590
02:10:28,288 --> 02:10:32,121
Laxmii!

1591
02:10:48,038 --> 02:10:51,163
Come on. Come on.

1592
02:10:51,621 --> 02:10:54,829
You can't come in here.
You can't. This is a temple.

1593
02:10:54,954 --> 02:10:55,871
Come on.

1594
02:10:56,413 --> 02:10:57,788
You can't come in the temple.

1595
02:10:57,913 --> 02:11:00,538
The night will end after three hours.

1596
02:11:01,413 --> 02:11:05,079
And with the crack of dawn,
you'll be gone forever.

1597
02:11:06,954 --> 02:11:09,288
After that, you cannot harm me.

1598
02:11:09,413 --> 02:11:10,496
You cannot harm me.

1599
02:11:10,621 --> 02:11:11,913
Come on.

1600
02:11:13,329 --> 02:11:14,288
Come on.

1601
02:11:31,996 --> 02:11:32,871
Come on.

1602
02:11:34,371 --> 02:11:37,496
You can't come in here.
You can't come in the temple.

1603
02:11:56,163 --> 02:11:58,538
So what if Laxmii can't come in.

1604
02:11:59,371 --> 02:12:01,163
But Asif can.

1605
02:12:58,121 --> 02:12:58,996
You're Asif.

1606
02:12:59,246 --> 02:13:00,996
I would've been scared
of you if you were Laxmii.

1607
02:13:34,038 --> 02:13:35,329
Laxmii!

1608
02:14:26,413 --> 02:14:27,829
No!

1609
02:14:35,246 --> 02:14:36,954
No! No!

1610
02:16:18,621 --> 02:16:19,996
Put those posters up there.

1611
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:21,038
Okay, sister.

1612
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:28,038
What are you thinking, Asif?

1613
02:16:29,538 --> 02:16:32,163
Frankly there wasn't much
difference between Laxmii and me.

1614
02:16:32,788 --> 02:16:35,163
I would eradicate the fear
of ghosts in people.

1615
02:16:35,663 --> 02:16:36,621
And Laxmii...

1616
02:16:37,038 --> 02:16:39,454
...wanted to eradicate the ghost
of inequality from society.

1617
02:16:39,579 --> 02:16:40,579
Absolutely right.

1618
02:16:41,371 --> 02:16:45,038
We've created a rift by classifying
them as male, female, transgender.

1619
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:48,329
But, when it comes to emotions...

1620
02:16:48,538 --> 02:16:50,454
...we're all the same.

1621
02:16:51,038 --> 02:16:52,579
Thank you, brother Asif.

1622
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,496
You did so much.

1623
02:16:54,871 --> 02:16:56,204
For all of us.

1624
02:16:56,579 --> 02:16:58,704
And I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1625
02:16:58,829 --> 02:17:00,371
Now rally for the elections...

1626
02:17:00,496 --> 02:17:02,038
...win and throw a party for us.

1627
02:17:02,163 --> 02:17:04,246
Of course. I will throw
a party for everyone.

1628
02:17:04,579 --> 02:17:05,121
Sister. Sister.

1629
02:17:05,496 --> 02:17:08,538
The goons from the opposition
party are burning our posters.

1630
02:17:08,663 --> 02:17:11,496
They are breaking everything in their
path and heading for our complex.

1631
02:17:14,371 --> 02:17:16,204
Laxmii will wreak havoc again.
