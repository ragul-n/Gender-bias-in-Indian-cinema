1
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,544
Sleep eludes me

2
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,467
"Today's paper, Miss Sarika."

3
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,477
Mother..? I've just come.

4
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,984
Who? oh no! No way.
Don't begin now.

5
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,397
I can't come to Pune now.

6
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,937
I'll call you at night.
okay. Bye.

7
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:38,611
I'd gone to the washer man
so I got your clothes too.

8
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,352
- Why did you take the trouble?
- It's no trouble at all.

9
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,948
- Count them. They're 8
- My hands..hold on.

10
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,225
Your clothes..

11
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,369
- Meena has gone to her
parental home. - So..?

12
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,305
You were cooking.
I've got a tiffin.

13
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,534
We could eat together.

14
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,975
"- Don't be formal.
- Mr. Kamdar, please leave."

15
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,980
or I'll have to tell
your wife about this.

16
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,656
- You misunderstand me.
- Not one bit.

17
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,325
Please go away and stop making
excuses to come to my house daily.

18
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,617
- Give me a minute.
- You may take an hour.

19
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,460
I don't mean this.

20
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,470
What can I do for you?

21
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,977
I need details of a flight
to London via Frankfurt.

22
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,523
Will you join me for lunch?

23
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,337
"Sorry, I don't go out
for lunch with strangers."

24
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,933
I am Karan Rathod and
your name is Sarika Vartak.

25
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:51,940
- We're no longer strangers.
- Knowing names doesn't make us pals.

26
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,947
But it's very important to
know names to make friends.

27
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,961
"Fool, you turned him down!
My God! He's so cute"

28
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,705
"I'd have gone with him for lunch,
breakfast and dinner if I were you."

29
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:35,918
Are you following me?
I thought you liked me..

30
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,423
So you followed me over here.

31
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,332
I'm kidding.

32
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:07,620
- We drink the same coffee.
- Half of lndia does.

33
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,961
Does half of lndia drink this coffee?

34
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,922
- Are you okay? - I chased him
because he was half my size.

35
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,392
Yet such people could be
carrying knives...

36
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,428
So you think I'm a hero?

37
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,275
I risked my life to get your purse.

38
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,346
Nobody does that for a stranger.

39
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,946
"lf not lunch, will you have a
cup of coffee with me? Here..?"

40
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,365
"- what do you do? - A little
everything, a little nothing."

41
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,230
Meaning?

42
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,967
Call you in an hour.

43
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,374
"Meaning stocks, shares, sensex"

44
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,377
My job is quite boring.
Tell me about yourself.

45
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,971
Do you like living alone?

46
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,478
- How do you know I live alone?
- 15 packets of noodles.

47
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,652
Either you live alone or
you have lots of kids.

48
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,991
Lots of kids.
Where do you stay?

49
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,735
In a suitcase.

50
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,337
I often come to Bombay for work
I live in a hotel.

51
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,511
"Mom is in Europe, Dad in USA.
They're divorced."

52
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,008
They're happy. So am l.

53
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,022
"Yes, tell me.."

54
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,290
When?

55
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,696
- All well? - Somewhat
and somewhat not well.

56
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,144
- Then..? - Then what?
He had his coffee and left.

57
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,253
"l too finished my coffee,
caught a bus and went home."

58
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,254
What..?

59
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,001
You..? What're you doing here?

60
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,678
Following you.

61
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:20,418
Been waiting for 2 hours for you
to come out so I can drop you home

62
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,957
Don't tell me you believe that!
I had work in the bank across.

63
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,958
"l saw you. Anyway, I'm going
to Juhu. Shall I give you a lift?"

64
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,306
So you took my advice?

65
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,972
- But...
- Again.

66
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,512
So you work in a travel agency.

67
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,655
My travelling is only from
home to office and back.

68
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,589
And weekends at Pune.

69
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,995
- What does your Dad do?
- He was a mining engineer.

70
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,002
Now he's retired.

71
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,352
I'll have a cup of tea
or coffee if you insist.

72
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,625
Who is Vidyadhar Damle?

73
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,959
He teaches drums in Africa.
He's my landlord.

74
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,985
- You really have many kids.
- Can you find me?

75
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,993
This..no this one..

76
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,446
"Tea, coffee or cold drink
What do you want?"

77
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,950
Actually I want to kiss you.

78
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,439
You asked me what
I wanted and I answered.

79
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,982
Not because I said this...

80
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,482
But because I made you angry.

81
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,680
- What is wrong?
- What? Nothing.

82
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,945
- Don't want to eat lunch?
- No.

83
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,958
"Miss Sarika, this is for you."

84
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,736
"Somebody left it
at the door, I just.."

85
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,967
You must've read the note.

86
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,482
I don't want to talk to you.

87
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,940
Lock up..

88
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,958
- Where do you want to go?
- I thought it's empty.

89
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:08,367
- It is. The meter is up
- Fare is 2 bottles.

90
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,465
Come on in. We'll drop you home.

91
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,970
"lf you won't sit in
the cab, neither will we."

92
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,644
- We'll walk with you.
- Step by step.

93
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,980
Sit in the taxi.
We hailed it for you.

94
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,420
- Get the cab..
- Who is he? Her Pop? - Let me see

95
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,599
My arm!!

96
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,276
Stop the cab!!

97
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,940
He broke my arm! Wait for me!

98
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,215
Come on.

99
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,948
- For what?
- For what??

100
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,294
- If you hadn't come in time..
- They were hired hoods.

101
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,960
They work in a beer bar.

102
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,962
"- What's your problem?
- You have a problem, not me."

103
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,232
You don't know what's true.

104
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,970
I broke his arm.
I'll have to pay an extra 10000

105
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,918
- This is no joke.
- You're joking.

106
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,646
Alone on the road at midnight.
What if something had happened..

107
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,918
Wear the seat belt.

108
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,938
For you.

109
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,608
open it.

110
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,946
- This is very..
- Expensive. I know.

111
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,460
- I can't take this.
- I'm not asking you to pay.

112
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,298
I'm serious. I can't take it.

113
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,697
I got you a gift.

114
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,903
I should've got you
a pen or some flowers.

115
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,402
So you could keep them
in the cupboard or notebook.

116
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,577
But you can't accept a necklace.

117
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,649
For me buying this
is like buying a pen.

118
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,920
I bought it for you.
I didn't look at the cost.

119
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,587
I liked it so I bought it

120
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,955
Shall I put it round?

121
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,296
- Got caught in traffic.
- Where's your luggage?

122
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,300
- What luggage?
- Did you come to say bye?

123
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,963
- Come with me.
- And my work?

124
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,967
India's tourism industry won't
come to a halt if you take leave.

125
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,983
- You're coming back on Tuesday?
- No guarantee of anything.

126
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,328
Who knows I might return on Sunday..

127
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,991
I meant next Sunday.

128
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,497
"No, mother. The holiday season is on."

129
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,002
So we have to work on Sundays
too. I'll come next week.

130
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:14,418
What's the matter? These days
Dad doesn't talk of settling me

131
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,017
You said you're coming on Sunday.

132
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,953
"l said, you can't be sure
about anything in life."

133
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,626
You're looking very pretty.

134
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,970
I'll be back.

135
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,464
Come in.

136
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,968
You could've called earlier.
I'd have made something else.

137
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,313
It's very good.

138
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,980
I can easily catch you when you lie.

139
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,252
Is that so?

140
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,990
We'll ask each other 5 questions
and the answers should be lies.

141
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,268
What is this?

142
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,746
What's the colour of your shirt?

143
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,958
"- Do your parents live in Pune?
- No, in Timbucktoo."

144
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,227
"- You work in the stock market.
- No, I'm a gangster."

145
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,957
- How many questions is that?
- Two.

146
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,301
- You lose.
- Hold it!

147
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,635
Let's not count this.
Let's do it again.

148
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:59,321
You have many girl friends?

149
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,487
You're the first girl I love.

150
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:20,502
Was..this the right answer or..

151
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,276
It's my turn.

152
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,616
"You tell me, if it's right or wrong"

153
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,549
It was the right answer.

154
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,375
Last question. Can l
stay here with you tonight?

155
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,575
- Yes. - okay.
I'll stay if you wish.

156
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,316
This was the sixth question.

157
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,928
What is the matter? Is it
because we're not married?

158
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,933
or because you don't trust me

159
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,440
I trust you.

160
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,339
- What's wrong?
- It's a rat!!

161
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,536
"- What? - I swear it's
a rat, I'm not joking!"

162
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,347
- What's the matter?
- A rat! I wondered what's wrong.

163
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,953
- It's not funny. Why're you
laughing? - okay. I'll find him.

164
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,443
- one second..
- Don't open it!!

165
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,947
It will come out!
What are you doing?

166
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,949
- There it is! - Don't kill
it! Get it out of here!

167
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,462
- What is this? - There's
a drain in the corner.

168
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,303
- He ran away hearing you scream.
- You find it funny

169
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,964
Why does my screaming
seem funny to you?

170
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,965
- Come down.
- I won't.

171
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,970
I'm not stepping down.

172
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,591
You come for 2 days
then you vanish for 4

173
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,929
- I don't want this. I want us..
- It's not for you.

174
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,431
It's for me.

175
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,934
So I can call you
whenever I feel like it.

176
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:56,285
"l have an off on Saturday,
I want us to go to Pune."

177
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,445
To my house.

178
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,315
No.

179
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,409
- Do me a favour?
- Yes.

180
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,920
"l have a friend, Abhijit
who lives in Nashik."

181
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,923
He's flying Hong Kong this evening
but first he'll come to Bombay.

182
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,590
He doesn't know anyone in Bombay.
Shall I send him home for 2 hours?

183
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,924
- I don't' have to show him
the sights? - offer him coffee.

184
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,934
He's your friend. I'll give
him coffee and lunch too.

185
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,937
I'm Abhijit. Karan..

186
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,440
Please come in.

187
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:07,283
I was watching TV so..
put the bag down there.

188
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,951
- Have you had lunch or..?
- Yes.

189
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,363
- Tea or coffee..?
- Tea.

190
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,629
I'll make it. Please sit till then..

191
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,923
What are you doing here?
Sit there comfortably.

192
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,418
I'm fine.

193
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,924
You may change the
channel if you wish.

194
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,928
"No, it's fine."

195
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,611
- Do you know Karan for long?
- Yes.

196
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,618
Which airline are you flying by?

197
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,953
How much sugar? Two spoons?

198
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,361
Are you going to Hong Kong for work?

199
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,465
Just a minute.

200
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,970
Yes. In Andheri.

201
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,386
"Yes. okay, be there in half an hour."

202
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,983
"Yes, I have work...
I must leave."

203
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,739
I'll take it before flying..

204
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:08,667
"Gangster Prakash Sahay alias Mama
was shot by the police in Juhu, Bombay"

205
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,999
According to the crime investigation
unit of Mumbai Police Crime branch..

206
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:17,010
Prakash had come to Chandan
cinema to kill an industrialist.

207
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,007
Sahay alias Mama..

208
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,956
He was wanted in many cases
of murder and extortion.

209
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,566
- Your friend..
- I know.

210
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,637
- Did he leave anything with you?
- His suitcase.

211
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,973
- Throw the suitcase out.
- Where do I throw it?

212
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,583
- I don't have time to explain.
- But what's happened? His name..

213
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,481
Get rid of the suitcase.

214
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,987
I'm taking the evening flight
You get rid of the bag.

215
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,992
Under no circumstances must
you mention me if anyone asks..

216
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,997
- Do you trust me?
- Yes but..

217
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,508
- Where do I throw the bag..?
- Anywhere! Just do it!

218
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,981
Is this Sarika Vartak's house?

219
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,655
Does Sarika Vartak live here?

220
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,989
Yes but she isn't home.

221
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:23,406
- Who are you?
- l..I'm Rathod.

222
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,939
- What's in this?
- Clothes. - open it.

223
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,616
No. I mean I couldn't
find the keys at home.

224
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,619
- Where is it?
- The key is lost.

225
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,951
I was going to get a duplicate made

226
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,638
Are you Mama's aunt?

227
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,976
Please talk properly.
I haven't done anything.

228
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,714
"How many times must I say,
I know no Mama or Sahay"

229
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,987
"- Everything..
- Quiet, bitch!"

230
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,987
Singing the same tune for 2 hours!
How did he have your address?

231
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,601
Under no circumstances
must you mention my name.

232
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,966
He was in the Wanted list.
He had to go sooner or later.

233
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,469
Why are you crying?

234
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,645
Honest..I didn't even know him.

235
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,987
- l..
- only slept with him or..?

236
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,482
Did you work for him?

237
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,265
This is a police station.

238
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,932
Crying doesn't help here.

239
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,498
only talking helps.

240
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,433
Speak...

241
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,955
There's somebody to see her.

242
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,962
I'm Sarika's friend.

243
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,376
- Is he also her friend?
- He's my brother.

244
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,971
I know Sarika for a year and a half

245
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,650
You are mistaken. Really..

246
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,976
Forget about her.
Talk about yourself.

247
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,916
You know her for a year and a half..

248
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,524
That means you too are involved

249
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,198
She only works with that
girl in a travel agency.

250
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,269
only work. That's why she's here.

251
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,933
Friendship is way off.
She hardly knows her.

252
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,405
I thought it's just
a case of accident..

253
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,939
Shut up. Don't waste madam's time.

254
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,946
She has lots of work.

255
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,457
Where's the food?
Give us some food.

256
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,632
Shut up. Is this a hotel?

257
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,238
It's a government cow shed.

258
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,649
Bitch!!

259
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,921
What are you staring at?
Never seen blood?

260
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,427
Come. Somebody is here to see you.

261
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,948
Your lawyer. Karan sent me.

262
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,616
- Where's Karan?
- He's busy in some work.

263
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,287
- Urgent work.. What?
- I don't know.

264
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,366
He said he'll come and tell.
Please sit here.

265
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll explain.

266
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:25,571
Karan met this Mama or
whatever a few months ago.

267
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,247
He said he was Abhijit. Had
a grape business near Nashik.

268
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,408
All dealings in grape
business is in cash.

269
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,912
Karan was investing his money.

270
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,516
They had become friendly.

271
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,921
Who knew he was a gangster.
He had neither grape nor Pop.

272
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,937
Did the police trouble you?

273
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,934
The police think I'm with
that man Prakash Sahay

274
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,943
- Where is Karan?
- He's in Bangalore.

275
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:18,452
Let me tell you..the facts are
we have done nothing.

276
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,362
Nothing will happen to you.

277
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,958
We'll go to court. Let the police
say anything. You don't worry.

278
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,461
"The judge will ask,
how did you get the suitcase?"

279
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,465
Tell him this Mama came to your house

280
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,969
And said he's your school friend
Sita or Gita's brother.

281
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,382
"Said, she'll call and
forcibly left the suitcase."

282
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,984
No call came.
You saw the news on TV.

283
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,982
You were taking the bag to
the police when this happened

284
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,655
- Sign here.
- But I was scared.

285
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,658
I lied to the police that..

286
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,661
What you said to the police
has no meaning in court.

287
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,002
The court needs evidence.
Which the police don't have.

288
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,498
We'll be home in 2 hours.

289
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,335
Sahay's finger prints
were found in her home.

290
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,003
Also some costly items.

291
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,609
"Mobile phone, diamond jewelry.."

292
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,008
She can't buy them
in her stated income.

293
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,678
This is her neighbour
Mr. Kamdar's statement.

294
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,014
He has seen them together.

295
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,688
Hence I can confidently say
she was Sahay's mistress.

296
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,628
And worked for him in the underworld

297
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,629
Judicial custody for 3 weeks.

298
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,469
Mr. Kamlesh! You said
I'd be home in 2 hours.

299
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,635
- Don't worry. I'll appeal...
- They're taking me to jail!

300
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,971
"What do you mean,
don't worry? Where is Karan?"

301
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,308
one minute. I'm trying his
mobile but can't reach him.

302
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,977
- He maybe in the flight.
- Flight..? - And who is Kamdar?

303
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,581
He's my neighbour. What's..

304
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,988
- You should've told me!
- There was nothing to tell.

305
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,655
- What could I say..?
- Will you decide what to say?

306
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,987
- No - I should know
what'll happen in court.

307
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,497
This is a legal matter.
Screaming will worsen it.

308
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,596
I'll take a date as early as possible.

309
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,998
We'll sue them and demand
compensation for defamation.

310
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,272
Come on.

311
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,504
It's a matter of a day or two.

312
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,958
Hurry up. Come on.

313
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,968
"1 1, 12, 13, 14.."

314
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,973
"16, 17, 18.."

315
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,988
Hurry up.

316
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:07,987
Sign and stand there.
You come forward.

317
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,000
Stand straight.

318
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,604
You're the new chick.

319
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,945
Want a biscuit?

320
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,543
Take it!

321
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,947
This is a great place.
You get great food.

322
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:48,960
"Listen, stay away from one woman."

323
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,529
She's crazy. A real bitch.

324
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,406
She's committed 4 murders.

325
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,974
There's a woman in the next
cell with a bandaged head..?

326
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:07,980
She fought with Dolly and
Dolly bit her ear off!

327
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,387
And spat it out. Steer clear of her.

328
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,255
What's your name?

329
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,266
And yours..?

330
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,940
Go to sleep. Go on.

331
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,717
What's the matter?

332
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,391
- What did you do to her?
- What did I do?

333
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,586
She's scared of rats.

334
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,423
- What's wrong?
- Scared of rats!

335
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,515
Get in line!

336
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,617
"Mother, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me."

337
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,949
- What happened?
- I don't know.

338
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,456
- But what happened?
- one small mistake..

339
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,366
- The gangster..
- He's not a gangster.

340
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,563
He was his friend. He didn't know..

341
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,567
What did he do? Ask her
what will she do?

342
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,976
What's your friend's name?

343
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,248
What..?

344
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,322
I didn't know.

345
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,926
- Ever heard his name?
- No.

346
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,595
- Ever met him?
- No.

347
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,925
- Simply believed your daughter.
- My daughter doesn't lie.

348
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,934
- Don't yell. I can hear
- The corporator has been waiting..

349
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,438
Ask him to sit.

350
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,676
You were in government service.
What was your salary?

351
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,344
- Rs. 9000.
- Your daughter earns 1 2000

352
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,218
It's enough but not in Mumbai.

353
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,618
Whatever you earn isn't enough here.

354
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,622
"Perfume bottles, cell phone.."

355
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,954
"Clothes, nail polish..
Where will these come from?"

356
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:20,960
They come from good families but
no father knows what the girl does.

357
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,371
She doesn't lie!

358
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,589
Work fast and you'll get thrashed!

359
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,610
- The lentils smell of soap.
- Then wash your hair with it.

360
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,461
Who is this swell babe?

361
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,241
She's new.

362
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,476
What's the name?

363
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,389
Name!

364
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,720
What did you do? What??

365
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,596
Answer questions.

366
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,502
- Leave her.
- Did I do anything to you?

367
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,504
Did l..? What?

368
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,419
What did I say? Leave her.

369
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,190
She's not answering me.

370
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,955
Get moving.

371
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,959
Move off.

372
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,959
See you later.

373
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,470
Come here.

374
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,986
- What's your name?
- You two are always out.

375
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,990
- Go away.
- We're going.

376
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,597
"Madam Pramila, they've come.
Sir wants you to talk to them."

377
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,492
"Carry on, I'm coming."

378
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,730
It's a matter of 2 weeks.
Everything will be fine.

379
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,999
"Till then, take care."

380
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:23,013
- Keep this.
- What is it?

381
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,947
Razor. You'll need it.

382
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,953
- Why do I need it?
- This is a jail. You'll need it.

383
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,964
- But I don't want it. I..
- As you wish.

384
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,370
Who is Premila?

385
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,448
Sadubhai's wife.

386
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,976
Don't you know him?

387
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,253
Where have you come from?
He was a notorious gangster.

388
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,483
He was bumped off by a rival gang.

389
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,987
Pramila killed both and came here.

390
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,490
She runs the gang from here.

391
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,266
She's very influential.

392
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,496
outside and inside.

393
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:23,677
She can get out when
she wants but it's safe here.

394
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,440
Police and gangsters
both can lose their lives.

395
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,711
When is Pramila's hearing?

396
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,477
- Why?
- Just asking.

397
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,663
- Come on. - Where?
- Just come.

398
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,494
"l said, come on."

399
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,942
- Where are you taking me..?
- Quietly come with me.

400
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,434
Go in there.

401
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,958
I met him at a party.
A friend introduced us.

402
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,961
I had no idea he was
part of the underworld.

403
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,967
"I'm calling all my contacts,
all my friends everyday."

404
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,140
I'll get you out of here very soon.

405
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,982
My entire work centers
around my reputation.

406
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:24,262
"lf my name comes up in this,
years of effort will be wasted."

407
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,338
Nobody will trust me.
Everything will be ruined.

408
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:38,608
I don't know how to say this but..

409
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:45,444
"for my sake, bear it
for another few days."

410
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:05,567
What a man. Left his wife in jail..

411
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,969
- And is free...
- No. Don't say that.

412
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,514
He told me he's trying his best.

413
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,714
"ln a few days, he'll have me out."

414
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,481
Good. This place isn't for you.

415
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,935
- ordered anything?
- No.

416
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,351
Who is it?

417
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,959
Got scared?

418
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,643
- Eight million? - Yes. Tomorrow.
- Where? - London.

419
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,421
Need 8. In London.

420
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,924
Note the number.

421
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,369
Everything is fine.

422
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,929
He'll call you.

423
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,934
Heard you have a girl friend
What's the problem?

424
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,607
- There's no problem.
- of course.

425
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,611
Her father is moving court.
He's got a date next week.

426
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,285
- So?
- What does that mean?

427
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,951
She's charged with MCoCA.
She can't hold out.

428
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,454
What if she mentions your
name during interrogation?

429
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,361
And if she admits to the crime?

430
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:19,298
But why will I confess
when I didn't do anything?

431
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,501
The police have lots
of evidence against you.

432
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,313
You'll go in even if
you don't confess to the crime.

433
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,911
"lf you do admit, the
matter goes to the judge."

434
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,915
And the judge is a good man.

435
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:43,422
Tell him you knew the man a little
You did small jobs for him.

436
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,925
Tell him you're sorry.
Shed some tears.

437
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,429
The judge will look at your record.

438
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:58,436
You are educated.
Belong to a good family.

439
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,540
You have an honest job.

440
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:02,949
He'll give you a warning.

441
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,616
He'll sentence you for 10-15 days
but you've spent a month in jail.

442
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,447
So there's no problem in that.

443
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,624
"Tell you something,
strictly between us.."

444
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:21,300
Judge Saklecha showed
this path to Karan.

445
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,309
Karan wants you to be out
as soon as possible.

446
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,910
- So what do we do?
- l..

447
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,907
I want to confess.

448
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,915
Are you admitting on your own?

449
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,191
Yes.

450
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,593
You're from a good family.
You are educated.

451
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,926
You even had a good job.

452
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:58,932
I can be lenient with those who
get into crime due to circumstances.

453
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:04,272
You did this of your own
will only out of greed.

454
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,949
I have no sympathy for you.

455
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,946
7 years of rigorous imprisonment.
No parole.

456
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,362
Judge..sir..

457
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,956
Why don't you say something?

458
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,368
"Just a minute, there's a mistake.."

459
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,962
Just a minute. Please.

460
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,704
"Your Honour, just a minute.
There's some misunderstanding."

461
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,973
Hold on. There's
some misunderstanding.

462
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,989
He hoodwinked you!

463
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:03,336
Now do you understand?
He's connection to the underworld.

464
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,407
He would've been trapped
if you'd mentioned him.

465
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,276
He framed you to save his skin.

466
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:19,011
She wants to meet you.
Sweetheart is threatening..

467
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,014
She'll tell the police about you.

468
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,961
What will you tell the police?

469
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:32,965
That Karan involved you?

470
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,632
Try and understand this.

471
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,964
The police have no record on Karan.

472
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,967
They might possibly
make inquiries. So..?

473
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:43,968
What will it prove?
That you slept with Karan?

474
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,974
Like you slept with Sahay
and God knows how many others?

475
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,977
Sleeping with you doesn't
make Karan a gangster!

476
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,321
I'm explaining to her.

477
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,997
I can understand the
state of your mind.

478
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,994
So I don't mind you threatening
about mentioning me to the cops.

479
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,000
I can't say much
for I am helpless.

480
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,350
I know you'll face
difficulties in jail.

481
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,347
"But believe me, in a few days
you'll get accustomed to it."

482
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,950
It's not as if I'm not
trying to get you out.

483
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,955
This judge turned out to be
a fraud. others won't be.

484
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,359
"ln months or a year,
he'll be transferred."

485
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,562
A new judge will be appointed
We'll reopen the case.

486
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,464
You should be brave. Be strong.

487
01:03:58,968 --> 01:03:59,957
Who?

488
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:06,965
"We're not allowed to call any
prisoner here like this, Madam."

489
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,703
Who's dead?

490
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,138
Her father?

491
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,339
Wash these too.

492
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,244
Hey! Wash the clothes!

493
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,113
Let me go.

494
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,954
Hey water-baby... haven't you
heard me? Damn you!

495
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,538
Throw that knife away!
The wardens are coming!

496
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,481
out of my way! What the
hell is going on here?

497
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,354
Gomti... what have you
been upto?

498
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,289
You there... come here!

499
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,952
What's happening here...?
Speak up!

500
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,620
Madam... it was that...

501
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,970
How would I know?
I was washing my clothes.

502
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:50,982
one good thing surely comes out of
the betrayal Karan has handed you.

503
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,395
It has given you strength.

504
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,131
There's a tiger hidden in everyone.
You need someone to provoke it.

505
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,643
You can now spend seven years
here in peace.

506
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,675
I have no intention of staying here.

507
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,417
Meaning?

508
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:24,352
I want to get out of this place.
Will you help me?

509
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,363
What are you going to do?
Kill him?

510
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,371
Not so easily.

511
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:52,385
Carry that... don't just watch.
- Careful.

512
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,408
They're asking me to go to Sangli.
How will l?

513
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,414
My husband and kid are here.

514
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,178
I asked them to send Asha.
She has no children.

515
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,353
But they ask me to either
go away or quit the job

516
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:28,351
"That's not fair, is it?
Are you hearing me?"

517
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,360
Don't worry. I'll look into it.
Go on.

518
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,973
A fire's broken out!
Someone fetch some water!

519
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,386
Hurry! Get some water!

520
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,656
A fire has broken out!

521
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,395
A fire has broken out
in the kitchen!

522
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,112
Go!

523
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,620
Fetch water! From there!

524
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,367
What are you doing...?
Get back... get some water!

525
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:16,987
Move in.

526
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,129
Move it guys.
No meeting today.

527
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,982
What...? But how?

528
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,109
A fire broke out in the prison.

529
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,450
"A few women slipped out,
and she was one of them too."

530
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,980
That's good... good for her.

531
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,324
I'm in a meeting.
I'll call you later.

532
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,330
Is everything else all right?
- I've bought a new car.

533
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,333
Contessa. White

534
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:39,563
When will this be done?

535
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,968
"Hello, sister...
are you okay?"

536
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,971
Is Bandya there?

537
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,936
Pramila's like a sister to me.

538
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:46,336
"Should you need anything... anywhere,
just phone me."

539
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,549
Where is Karan?

540
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:43,329
Are you out of your mind?
- Where is Karan?

541
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,467
I'm not sparing you!
I'll have you hanged!

542
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:48,925
I'm not sparing you!

543
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:59,346
I'll ask you one last time.
Where is Karan?

544
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,584
They say he was drunk
and fell off the balcony.

545
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:18,357
No one saw anything. They think it's
a case of accident or suicide.

546
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,290
Suicide?
- Yes.

547
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,956
Why would he commit suicide?
He has been killed by someone.

548
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:30,502
I had told him to take
Nagrath's case lightly.

549
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:36,637
And those guys of the estate. I wonder
how many guys he caused losses to.

550
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,379
You mean one of those guys
have bumped him off?

551
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,108
Yes. But who was it?

552
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,957
In which room is Mr Karan Rathod
put up?

553
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:42,961
one moment.

554
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,972
Room number 3023.
Would you like to talk to him?

555
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:51,371
No thanks. Would 3022 or 3024
be available by any chance?

556
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:53,970
"one moment, ma'am."

557
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,143
"I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Those rooms are not available."

558
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:03,150
But you can have the room
bang opposite his.

559
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,380
Will do.

560
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,991
"Would you fill up this form, please?
- Sure."

561
01:23:25,928 --> 01:23:27,919
"I'm okay, Mother."

562
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:31,925
"No, I'm not in Bombay. I..."

563
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:36,928
I can't tell you right now.
I'm with a friend.

564
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,339
"You don't know her, Mother."

565
01:23:39,608 --> 01:23:42,941
"But what have you done, Sarika?
- No point in discussing all that now."

566
01:23:43,345 --> 01:23:47,338
"You mustn't cry, please. You can
do that much for me, can't you?"

567
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,942
"Please... talk to me, Mother."

568
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:55,346
From Delhi. Used a pre-paid
card to call.

569
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:58,119
Under a fictitious name.

570
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:40,330
I've been noticing you for 2 days.
My name is Krishna Varghese.

571
01:24:47,242 --> 01:24:51,338
"lf you work for my album, I can
make you famous overnight."

572
01:24:51,947 --> 01:24:53,073
What do you do by the way?

573
01:24:53,215 --> 01:24:56,343
I won't take much of your time.
My studio's nearby. In the city.

574
01:24:59,354 --> 01:25:02,346
What were you saying?
- I can introduce you everywhere.

575
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,358
I can send your photographs
to the top agencies.

576
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:28,914
"A moment of ecstasy,
and a sweet high"

577
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:39,326
Was it me...?
or was it someone else?

578
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:46,333
"Unblemished, innocent,
blameless..."

579
01:25:46,935 --> 01:25:50,928
Iike a nymph from paradise...

580
01:25:51,106 --> 01:25:55,338
she took the breath away

581
01:26:07,956 --> 01:26:11,357
There used to be a beautiful woman

582
01:26:23,205 --> 01:26:25,298
So what went wrong...

583
01:26:26,441 --> 01:26:29,308
"with the beautiful woman
who once was?"

584
01:26:30,545 --> 01:26:33,241
Where is she...?

585
01:26:33,482 --> 01:26:37,316
"the beautiful woman
who once was?"

586
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:48,327
Killer eyes...

587
01:26:49,331 --> 01:26:53,324
black-hearted...

588
01:26:54,236 --> 01:26:57,330
"the footfalls, I could not hear"

589
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,341
the silence was deafening...

590
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:07,338
eyes shed tears...

591
01:27:07,949 --> 01:27:11,942
"l kept crying,
while he laughed"

592
01:27:17,959 --> 01:27:21,360
"There was once
a beautiful woman"

593
01:27:33,175 --> 01:27:35,905
What happened...?

594
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:39,303
"of the beautiful woman
who once was"

595
01:27:40,182 --> 01:27:42,912
Where is she...?

596
01:27:43,085 --> 01:27:46,316
"the beautiful woman
who once was?"

597
01:28:11,346 --> 01:28:17,342
What occurred in a moment?

598
01:28:20,355 --> 01:28:26,294
"My face was lost
in obscurity"

599
01:28:30,132 --> 01:28:34,296
Fires rage in my eyes

600
01:28:34,436 --> 01:28:38,896
"My lips are firm
in resolve"

601
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:42,902
"The one that was,
has gone into hiding..."

602
01:28:43,912 --> 01:28:47,905
"who's this...?
No, it isn't me"

603
01:28:55,924 --> 01:28:59,325
"There used to be
a beautiful woman"

604
01:31:35,884 --> 01:31:37,283
Is it necessary to meet
so late in the night?

605
01:31:37,519 --> 01:31:39,885
"Not later, right now.
Sir wants you right now."

606
01:31:40,555 --> 01:31:42,887
What are you doing? What?
- Let me make a call.

607
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:45,549
Don't touch me.
- You're going with us right now.

608
01:31:45,894 --> 01:31:47,293
Move it!

609
01:31:49,898 --> 01:31:53,891
Karan... Iet's go.
only for five minutes

610
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:33,534
What is the problem?

611
01:32:38,046 --> 01:32:39,877
Karan is here.

612
01:32:42,884 --> 01:32:44,215
Sit down.

613
01:32:53,895 --> 01:32:57,058
Why're you so serious?
Smile

614
01:33:25,226 --> 01:33:26,557
Has he gone to sleep?

615
01:33:53,955 --> 01:33:54,944
Go

616
01:33:57,592 --> 01:33:59,025
Go upstairs.

617
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:21,381
"Make your men see reason, Sanjeev.
They have no manners."

618
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:26,313
"l told them to drag you here,
wherever and whatever state you were in"

619
01:34:28,923 --> 01:34:31,255
So you've found time to spare
from the girl?

620
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:48,935
Has my work been done or not?
- No.

621
01:34:49,944 --> 01:34:51,343
Why not?

622
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:56,344
"lt'll be done, Sanjeev.
Nagar-bhai took ill and..."

623
01:34:56,484 --> 01:35:00,944
To hell with your Nagar-bhai.
- I had to take him to the hospital.

624
01:35:01,523 --> 01:35:03,957
He's not dead. Is he?

625
01:35:04,259 --> 01:35:08,286
How much have you been paid till now?
- Two.

626
01:35:11,132 --> 01:35:13,600
I didn't pay you that amount
to listen to stories.

627
01:35:13,968 --> 01:35:16,960
You were paid to do a job.
When will the job be done?

628
01:35:17,372 --> 01:35:20,364
In fifteen or twenty days.
- Fifteen? or twenty?

629
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:23,542
Twenty.

630
01:35:25,914 --> 01:35:28,314
"For twenty days,
I won't telephone you"

631
01:35:28,483 --> 01:35:31,316
"Even after twenty days,
I won't."

632
01:35:37,926 --> 01:35:40,918
"All right, Sanjeev. What else?"

633
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:43,329
How's the elder brother?

634
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:47,057
He's very happy with you.

635
01:36:02,951 --> 01:36:04,475
Everything's been sorted out.

636
01:36:05,954 --> 01:36:07,353
Give me a smile at least now.

637
01:36:19,367 --> 01:36:23,303
"Yes... I told you,
I'd be free in half an hour."

638
01:36:23,905 --> 01:36:25,896
I'm coming over to pick you up.

639
01:36:26,608 --> 01:36:30,237
What will we do so late in the night?
Watch TV.

640
01:36:37,919 --> 01:36:40,911
"Yes, brother? He's upstairs"

641
01:36:41,089 --> 01:36:42,920
Karan has gone down just now.

642
01:36:43,324 --> 01:36:45,918
Really? I'll take a look.

643
01:36:57,639 --> 01:36:59,334
Have you gone to sleep?

644
01:37:06,948 --> 01:37:11,351
Please come here immediately.
Karan has... killed Sanjeev.

645
01:37:12,954 --> 01:37:14,945
Marfatia's money is also missing.

646
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:05,330
I want Karan.

647
01:39:24,886 --> 01:39:28,287
"The receptionist has arrived, madam.
The one you wanted to talk to?"

648
01:39:48,076 --> 01:39:49,907
Did you see her
coming or going with anyone?

649
01:39:52,313 --> 01:39:55,214
"Did she receive any calls?
- No, ma'am."

650
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:03,914
"one thing, ma'am. When she arrived,
she specially requested..."

651
01:40:04,058 --> 01:40:07,926
for a room next to Mr Rathod's.
one Mr Karan Rathod.

652
01:40:20,942 --> 01:40:22,341
What are you doing?
Let me go!

653
01:40:27,281 --> 01:40:28,873
Who are they?

654
01:40:56,511 --> 01:40:57,500
What's up?

655
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:05,909
"What happened?
- You ask that, you sonofabitch!"

656
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,323
What happened?
- You've killed Sanjeev!

657
01:41:14,562 --> 01:41:16,928
What?
- You've killed Sanjeev!

658
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:38,041
Who killed Sanjeev?
- You!

659
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:40,278
Cut the crap!
- No crap! It's the truth!

660
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:42,286
"Minutes after you left,
we found him dead"

661
01:42:03,544 --> 01:42:05,910
"Believe me, brother.
I haven't killed Sanjeev."

662
01:42:06,047 --> 01:42:07,537
Lies!
- Why would I kill him?

663
01:42:08,316 --> 01:42:10,307
Lies! He's lying!

664
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,711
"Look in Sanjay's house. If not there,
check out Nautiyal's godown."

665
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:40,566
Why would I kill him?

666
01:43:41,942 --> 01:43:43,341
What happened?

667
01:43:43,944 --> 01:43:44,933
What?!

668
01:43:47,948 --> 01:43:50,940
Where's Bilal right now?
Bilal?

669
01:43:52,486 --> 01:43:53,953
"I'm shocked, brother."

670
01:43:54,955 --> 01:43:56,354
He's gone insane.

671
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:59,949
Where will he go? Must be
somewhere here in Delhi

672
01:44:00,361 --> 01:44:03,956
We'll find him. And fix him

673
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:13,971
The situation is very bad.
Just run away.

674
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:17,367
But why must I run away?
I've not done anything.

675
01:44:17,978 --> 01:44:21,379
Bilal is the one who stole the money.
That sonofa...

676
01:44:21,615 --> 01:44:25,312
To hell with all that.
Save your life. Just run away.

677
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,218
Take my advise. Get out of Delhi.

678
01:44:36,931 --> 01:44:38,922
Any news?
- I've come to ask you.

679
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:42,330
Any calls?
- I called so many places...

680
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:44,938
there's no trace of him.
But we're not sparing him.

681
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:49,332
You looked everywhere?
- Everywhere I could.

682
01:44:49,577 --> 01:44:51,943
Brother had called.
He sounded very upset.

683
01:44:52,246 --> 01:44:53,941
What were you guys doing there?

684
01:44:55,349 --> 01:44:57,613
You killed a goat in the bathroom?

685
01:45:00,388 --> 01:45:04,950
All I know is that he left
this place in Patel's car.

686
01:45:15,102 --> 01:45:18,367
"You know me well, sir.
Make them understand that l..."

687
01:45:18,973 --> 01:45:21,373
"Yes, I knew they had
a fight going, but..."

688
01:45:22,643 --> 01:45:23,905
I'm at the airport.

689
01:47:38,913 --> 01:47:40,312
I can't believe this!

690
01:47:40,915 --> 01:47:43,907
How have you been? I've been looking
for you for so many days!

691
01:47:43,984 --> 01:47:46,316
What happened?
- Nothing... what are you doing here?

692
01:47:46,921 --> 01:47:51,324
"l escaped from there, Karan.
With half a dozen other girls..."

693
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:53,585
"And you once told me that
you work in Delhi, didn't you?"

694
01:47:53,928 --> 01:47:57,329
"Karan, I called every Rathod
in the telephone directory, but..."

695
01:47:57,464 --> 01:48:00,922
And then I wondered
whether you were around at all.

696
01:48:01,068 --> 01:48:03,332
Whether you were in Delhi
or somewhere else in lndia.

697
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:06,337
I wondered how I'd find you.
And l...

698
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:09,931
I can't believe it that
I'd find you here like this

699
01:48:11,245 --> 01:48:13,941
You must be happy too...?
What is the matter?

700
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:18,942
There are men after me.
They want to kill me.

701
01:48:19,153 --> 01:48:21,553
What...?
- It's a misunderstanding.

702
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:24,885
I'll be there in an hour.

703
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:26,554
What happened?

704
01:48:27,895 --> 01:48:31,558
"Your place at Hauz Khas?
C'mon, it's only for a day or two!"

705
01:48:32,299 --> 01:48:35,200
"No, I can't go there.
And you know that well."

706
01:48:41,909 --> 01:48:44,309
"Sarika, where are you staying?"

707
01:48:47,114 --> 01:48:50,914
"What is the matter, Karan?
- Nothing."

708
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:54,310
Kamlesh called to say that
you had run away from jail.

709
01:48:55,556 --> 01:48:58,320
Didn't you contact me?
- I did.

710
01:48:58,926 --> 01:49:02,327
"l called Kamlesh's house so many
times, but no one takes the phone."

711
01:49:02,463 --> 01:49:06,923
Then I got to know that he had
fallen off the balcony and died.

712
01:49:08,102 --> 01:49:10,935
He didn't die on his own.
He was killed.

713
01:49:11,338 --> 01:49:14,330
Killed? Who killed him?

714
01:49:14,475 --> 01:49:16,340
The same guys who want to kill me.

715
01:49:18,946 --> 01:49:22,347
"After you went to jail, I got
trapped with the underworld."

716
01:49:23,884 --> 01:49:27,285
Kamlesh and I were gathering
evidence to save you.

717
01:49:27,888 --> 01:49:30,880
They got to know and
they killed Kamlesh.

718
01:49:32,292 --> 01:49:34,886
They've framed me for
someone's murder too.

719
01:49:35,195 --> 01:49:37,527
I can't even go to
the police now.

720
01:49:40,901 --> 01:49:42,892
"So what are you
going to do, Karan?"

721
01:49:44,304 --> 01:49:48,536
That which I must do to
save my skin. I'll have to

722
01:49:50,911 --> 01:49:52,902
"I'm with you, Karan."

723
01:49:53,914 --> 01:49:57,907
"Having spent time in jail,
I've learnt to fight back too."

724
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:27,869
A jail-mate got me this place.
It's absolutely safe.

725
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,300
Yes? You've done it for me?

726
01:50:51,905 --> 01:50:55,306
It's Bilal who killed him and
vanished with the money.

727
01:50:55,909 --> 01:50:58,901
They'll say anything!
I want Bilal all alone. That's it.

728
01:51:00,914 --> 01:51:02,905
"What will you do with
where I am, Amrish?"

729
01:51:04,184 --> 01:51:07,312
Can you do it for me?
or can't you?

730
01:51:14,928 --> 01:51:16,919
Who are these men
that are following you?

731
01:51:18,098 --> 01:51:20,498
"I'll explain everything
to you later, Sarika."

732
01:51:24,037 --> 01:51:28,269
"You have a cell-phone charger?
- oh yes, I'll give it to you."

733
01:52:45,886 --> 01:52:48,878
"Karan, for a little while..."

734
01:52:50,290 --> 01:52:52,281
can't you forget all this?

735
01:53:26,927 --> 01:53:28,087
Give him the phone.

736
01:53:28,929 --> 01:53:29,918
Hurry up.

737
01:53:32,332 --> 01:53:34,926
"Call his place, go there
or do what you will..."

738
01:53:35,068 --> 01:53:37,332
all I want to know is
where is Bilal.

739
01:53:38,338 --> 01:53:41,933
"How many men does he have?
You can do this much, can't you?"

740
01:53:42,943 --> 01:53:44,342
Call me back soon.

741
01:53:56,957 --> 01:53:58,948
"Where will you go, Karan?"

742
01:54:02,095 --> 01:54:05,963
I have a friend in Jaipur.
They have a huge mansion.

743
01:54:06,266 --> 01:54:08,962
"We can get a car, money...
everything there."

744
01:54:09,269 --> 01:54:12,602
"Let's go someplace faraway
from here, Karan. okay?"

745
01:54:18,378 --> 01:54:19,367
Yes?

746
01:54:20,213 --> 01:54:21,475
What?!

747
01:54:29,323 --> 01:54:33,555
"You hate me.
- What... are you saying, Karan?"

748
01:54:33,927 --> 01:54:37,920
You will go to Bilal and
tell him that you hate me.

749
01:54:38,231 --> 01:54:40,324
He will believe what you say.

750
01:54:41,568 --> 01:54:43,934
You will tell him
where I am hiding.

751
01:54:44,938 --> 01:54:49,341
I want Bilal all alone.
And only you can do it for me.

752
01:54:51,211 --> 01:54:52,701
But who is Bilal?

753
01:54:53,046 --> 01:54:55,947
The owner of three factories.
A garment exporter.

754
01:54:56,216 --> 01:54:58,116
But he's definitely
an underworld man.

755
01:54:58,352 --> 01:55:01,583
The bodies we found in the hotel
were his men.

756
01:55:01,955 --> 01:55:04,355
But what has all this to do
with your case?

757
01:55:07,594 --> 01:55:09,357
Where will I find Bilal?

758
01:55:16,536 --> 01:55:17,969
I want to meet Mr Bilal.

759
01:55:20,974 --> 01:55:23,909
Yes?
- I want to have a word with him.

760
01:55:24,911 --> 01:55:27,539
There's a girl outside.
She says she knows where Karan is.

761
01:55:42,929 --> 01:55:44,328
Where is Karan?

762
01:55:57,577 --> 01:55:58,942
Sit down.

763
01:55:59,246 --> 01:56:02,340
And what did you think?
Your men could kill me?

764
01:56:02,949 --> 01:56:05,349
or that I'd run away from Delhi
out of fear?

765
01:56:06,086 --> 01:56:09,351
It was a fantastic move.
But you picked on the wrong man.

766
01:56:09,956 --> 01:56:11,947
"Where is Marfatia's money, Bilal?"

767
01:56:12,092 --> 01:56:14,617
"What?
- Money, rupees... where is it?"

768
01:56:14,961 --> 01:56:16,121
You're insane!

769
01:56:17,964 --> 01:56:21,957
Hurry up!
- How'd I know where the money is

770
01:56:22,102 --> 01:56:24,900
You don't know where the money is?
- You must tell me.

771
01:56:25,205 --> 01:56:26,900
You're the one who
has the money.

772
01:56:28,542 --> 01:56:30,203
"l don't have much time, Bilal."

773
01:56:30,911 --> 01:56:33,311
I see. You're high on pot.

774
01:56:33,547 --> 01:56:36,311
You're the one who killed Sanjeev.
And you stole the money!

775
01:56:38,919 --> 01:56:41,911
"lf I had killed Sanjeev,
why would I come here?"

776
01:56:42,222 --> 01:56:44,315
Think about it!
Why would I come here?

777
01:56:48,595 --> 01:56:50,927
If you haven't killed Sanjeev...

778
01:56:51,932 --> 01:56:54,924
"it means there was someone else
present there, that night"

779
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,336
Who? Who...?
- How'd I know who?

780
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:03,933
Let me talk to brother.
Let me telephone him.

781
01:57:04,177 --> 01:57:07,340
I'll tell him that you
didn't commit the murder

782
01:57:08,181 --> 01:57:10,945
I'll kill you and the money
won't be any good for you

783
01:57:11,218 --> 01:57:14,244
Give me the money and run away.
I'm giving you a chance.

784
01:57:16,957 --> 01:57:20,358
The money is not with me!
- So you won't talk?

785
01:57:21,294 --> 01:57:22,955
You won't tell me?

786
01:57:24,898 --> 01:57:27,890
I'll tell you... I will.

787
01:57:28,034 --> 01:57:29,501
Get up... move it!

788
01:57:42,916 --> 01:57:45,544
Nobody's answering the phone at
Bilal's. Check what the problem is.

789
01:57:45,652 --> 01:57:47,085
"At once, brother."

790
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:17,438
Hold it!

791
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:31,296
"Mr Karan Rathod, we find dead-bodies
everywhere you go."

792
01:58:32,899 --> 01:58:36,300
"l don't know anything, madam.
I had come here to meet Mr Bilal."

793
01:58:36,469 --> 01:58:39,905
But I found these bodies.
And then you arrived suddenly...

794
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:42,198
and I thought...
- Where is Sarika?

795
01:58:42,909 --> 01:58:44,900
Sarika who? I don't know.

796
01:58:45,212 --> 01:58:47,407
Don't you live together in the hotel?
- In the hotel?

797
01:58:48,915 --> 01:58:50,906
No.
- Why?

798
01:58:51,318 --> 01:58:53,912
Isn't it living together when
you stay in opposite rooms?

799
01:58:56,656 --> 01:58:57,918
Remember now?

800
01:58:58,925 --> 01:59:02,554
Sarika who? The one who ran away
from the Bombay prison?

801
01:59:02,929 --> 01:59:05,921
The same Sarika who
murdered Kamlesh Mathur.

802
01:59:08,935 --> 01:59:11,335
Why would Sarika
murder Kamlesh Mathur?

803
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:33,882
Isn't it living together when
you stay in opposite rooms?

804
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:39,130
The same Sarika who
murdered Kamlesh Mathur.

805
01:59:39,299 --> 01:59:41,290
Killed? Who killed him?

806
01:59:42,902 --> 01:59:45,894
"lf you haven't killed Sanjeev,
it means..."

807
01:59:46,306 --> 01:59:48,604
there was someone else present there
that night.

808
02:00:06,926 --> 02:00:09,554
Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

809
02:00:15,235 --> 02:00:18,932
Although I felt for a moment
that we'd never meet again.

810
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,936
"Karan, we must get out
of this place immediately."

811
02:00:26,513 --> 02:00:29,880
"one second, Sarika.
I need to talk to you."

812
02:00:34,888 --> 02:00:40,292
"You faced a lot of problems because
of me, but you're still helping me"

813
02:00:40,894 --> 02:00:41,883
Why?

814
02:00:48,902 --> 02:00:50,529
"I'm in love with you, Karan."

815
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:54,029
Will you marry me?

816
02:00:58,912 --> 02:01:01,904
"Karan, the police
are after me..."

817
02:01:02,115 --> 02:01:05,312
and you're being followed by...

818
02:01:07,921 --> 02:01:09,320
We must leave.

819
02:01:10,924 --> 02:01:13,324
You didn't answer my question.
- Karan...?

820
02:01:14,928 --> 02:01:18,329
"You love me, don't you?
- oh yes, Karan."

821
02:01:22,335 --> 02:01:25,270
"We'll go to Nepal. And from there,
we'll go away to Europe."

822
02:01:26,873 --> 02:01:30,866
My mother lives there.
I haven't met her in years.

823
02:01:32,879 --> 02:01:35,279
I want to meet her with you.

824
02:01:37,217 --> 02:01:39,276
only tell me... where the money is

825
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:45,180
I know

826
02:01:46,893 --> 02:01:48,884
"Where is the money, Sarika?"

827
02:01:57,537 --> 02:02:00,301
Where is the money?
Where is it?

828
02:02:16,322 --> 02:02:18,085
I won't ask again.

829
02:02:26,866 --> 02:02:28,857
Where is the money?

830
02:02:33,873 --> 02:02:35,864
How did you kill Kamlesh?

831
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:40,274
And how did you kill Sanjeev?

832
02:02:42,182 --> 02:02:43,877
Quite a revelation
you've turned out to be.

833
02:02:49,088 --> 02:02:52,888
"That you could be so spicy,
I never realised when I had you."

834
02:02:58,531 --> 02:03:02,900
"The first time I met you,
I only wanted to sleep with you."

835
02:03:06,206 --> 02:03:09,903
"But I now think, I must
really fall in love once"

836
02:03:16,049 --> 02:03:17,311
Where is the money?

837
02:03:49,949 --> 02:03:52,349
What's this? Huh?

838
02:03:55,588 --> 02:03:57,112
You wanted to kill me?

839
02:03:58,658 --> 02:04:00,956
So here you are. Kill me.

840
02:04:01,261 --> 02:04:04,958
You've learnt so much in jail.
Take it!

841
02:04:05,365 --> 02:04:06,354
No?

842
02:04:14,974 --> 02:04:16,373
Where is the money?

843
02:04:18,578 --> 02:04:22,036
"Tell me where the money is, Sarika.
Else, I'll kill you."

844
02:04:24,083 --> 02:04:25,914
Burnt

845
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,080
Loudly!

846
02:04:28,321 --> 02:04:31,916
I burnt it!
- Lies! You are lying!

847
02:04:33,927 --> 02:04:36,919
I'm speaking the truth!
I'm the one who killed Sanjeev!

848
02:04:37,063 --> 02:04:40,328
"l took the money, ran away from
there and burnt the money!"

849
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,932
"Because I knew,
they wouldn't spare you!"

850
02:04:43,002 --> 02:04:44,936
"l wanted them to catch you,
to follow you..."

851
02:04:45,071 --> 02:04:47,938
"to torture you, to put you
through misery..."

852
02:04:48,107 --> 02:04:50,075
And so you burnt the money?
- Yes!

853
02:04:50,476 --> 02:04:53,343
Have you gone mad?
- I went mad... in jail!

854
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:56,344
"I'm sorry, Karan.
But I've burnt the money."

855
02:04:56,583 --> 02:05:00,349
"What can I do now, Karan? What?
I'll do anything you say!"

856
02:05:00,954 --> 02:05:04,355
I had gone mad with rage!
Please don't kill me!

857
02:05:05,658 --> 02:05:09,355
"I'll do anything you say, Karan.
Anything..."

858
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:19,366
This is exactly what you
will go and tell Nanda.

859
02:05:22,976 --> 02:05:26,309
She went to jail because of me.
So she wanted revenge from me.

860
02:05:26,913 --> 02:05:28,904
And poor Sanjeev
had to lose his life.

861
02:05:32,218 --> 02:05:34,209
Speak up! Tell brother!

862
02:05:35,922 --> 02:05:38,322
Speak!
- Sir...

863
02:05:38,925 --> 02:05:40,916
"sir, I haven't killed anyone."

864
02:05:41,928 --> 02:05:46,331
I haven't killed anyone.
I was in love with this man.

865
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:52,930
But he was with another woman in
the hotel. He drove me out...

866
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:56,932
Let her speak.

867
02:05:58,611 --> 02:06:03,605
I was returning Mumbai. He suddenly
landed at my place last night...

868
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:06,350
and said he wanted a place
to hide.

869
02:06:06,519 --> 02:06:09,352
He said he had ended up
killing someone.

870
02:06:09,956 --> 02:06:12,584
"That the underworld was after him.
Karan, please..."

871
02:06:12,959 --> 02:06:14,950
"Brother, she's lying!"

872
02:06:15,495 --> 02:06:16,484
Lies!

873
02:06:21,968 --> 02:06:24,903
And then he said
that if I took the rap...

874
02:06:25,038 --> 02:06:27,302
he'd give me a lot of money.

875
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,307
"And when I refused to do it,
he tied me up and brought me here."

876
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:33,310
Save me from him! Please!

877
02:06:33,413 --> 02:06:35,904
She's the one who killed Kamlesh.

878
02:06:36,215 --> 02:06:39,309
The Bombay police is after her!
You can telephone and find out.

879
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:42,310
Who Kamlesh?

880
02:06:42,455 --> 02:06:46,323
"l didn't even know
the gentleman, sir."

881
02:06:46,426 --> 02:06:48,917
Why would I kill him?
This man...

882
02:06:49,095 --> 02:06:50,926
She's talking any nonsense
and you're listening to her!

883
02:06:51,097 --> 02:06:53,930
"Ask her where the money is!
She says, she has burnt it!"

884
02:06:54,067 --> 02:06:58,333
"Burnt it...? Why would anyone
burn anyone's money, sir?"

885
02:06:58,471 --> 02:07:01,338
"Have you gone mad, Karan?
- I'll slit your tongue!"

886
02:07:01,941 --> 02:07:06,344
Why would anyone burn money?
Has this man gone mad...?

887
02:07:08,948 --> 02:07:11,940
"Enough!
- Save me from this madman, sir!"

888
02:07:12,118 --> 02:07:15,952
Save me from him!
- This one here is her gun.

889
02:07:16,122 --> 02:07:20,957
I guarantee it. This is the gun
that killed Sanjeev.

890
02:07:48,921 --> 02:07:52,322
Why would she kill my brother
to extract revenge from you?

891
02:07:52,458 --> 02:07:55,325
Because she's crazy!
- Where is Marfatia's money?

892
02:07:55,528 --> 02:07:57,553
Ask her! Don't ask me!

893
02:08:02,235 --> 02:08:06,569
You will die if anyone opens fire.
So listen carefully to me.

894
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:10,241
If I had killed Sanjeev
and stolen the money...

895
02:08:10,343 --> 02:08:12,334
I'd have been in Europe right now.
Not here!

896
02:08:13,946 --> 02:08:16,938
I have not killed your brother.
She has!

897
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,150
"She's the one who stole the money,
not me!"

898
02:08:20,253 --> 02:08:21,220
Ask her!

899
02:08:22,955 --> 02:08:24,047
She has escaped.

900
02:08:28,261 --> 02:08:29,285
She has run away!

901
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:45,901
Brother! The police!

902
02:08:51,918 --> 02:08:54,318
Come on out! Quick!

903
02:10:14,934 --> 02:10:16,333
Take a left.

904
02:10:28,414 --> 02:10:31,008
"The next slug will
rip through your skull, Karan"

905
02:10:31,884 --> 02:10:33,283
Take a U-turn.

906
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:27,498
"What's all this, Sarika?
- Quietly walk."

907
02:11:42,888 --> 02:11:44,185
Go on.

908
02:12:35,875 --> 02:12:39,276
What are you doing...?
What is all this?

909
02:12:41,347 --> 02:12:43,872
I thought about you
in jail everyday.

910
02:12:44,884 --> 02:12:46,875
What am I to do with you?

911
02:12:47,053 --> 02:12:49,886
"Now look, Sarika. What I did
to you was very wrong..."

912
02:12:50,222 --> 02:12:52,884
Mere death would be
far too little for you.

913
02:12:54,627 --> 02:12:59,530
I had to search so much
to find this place.

914
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:02,299
"Sarika, undo this lock,."

915
02:13:02,435 --> 02:13:04,903
Miles away from the city.

916
02:13:05,571 --> 02:13:07,232
Nobody comes here.

917
02:13:17,383 --> 02:13:21,319
You remember...?
I used to be scared of rats.

918
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:24,321
"Have you gone mad, Sarika?
Where did the rats come in from?"

919
02:13:24,457 --> 02:13:26,925
You used to laugh.
- Untie me!

920
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:29,557
You used to laugh.

921
02:13:32,331 --> 02:13:34,322
"ln jail, I was rid of all the fear."

922
02:13:35,935 --> 02:13:38,927
I'm not scared of anything anymore.

923
02:13:50,616 --> 02:13:52,948
I ask for your forgiveness
for whatever has happened.

924
02:14:13,305 --> 02:14:15,500
You think I can't
get out of this place?

925
02:15:09,562 --> 02:15:11,359
Karan's 1 10 million.

926
02:15:12,131 --> 02:15:13,962
I've done what I had to.

927
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:18,129
Now you can do
what you want to.
