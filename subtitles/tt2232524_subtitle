'I am this cinema.'

00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,325
'I was born in 1895.'

3
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,297
'I couIdn't speak when I was born.'

4
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,329
'I was siIent.'

5
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:10,019
'Then I Iearned to speak.
And sing as weII.'

6
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:14,417
'I was bIack and
white when I was born.'

7
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:19,190
'And I became coIoured
when I grew up.'

8
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:25,229
'Anyway, I don't wish to
bore you by teIIing you my story.'

9
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:30,275
'Anyhow this is the story
of a person who Ioves me..

10
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,436
..that is to say cinema.
Amar Joshi.'

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,645
'Why did you keep it from me?'

12
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,245
'ShouId you keep
it from me this way?'

00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,049
'Everyone is crying

14
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,118
'That's Amar Joshi for you.'

00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:48,593
'No matter what the fiIm is Iike,
he aIways watches.'

16
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:53,929
'Sometimes Iike this
and Iike this at other times.'

17
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,277
'Yes, this is London.'

18
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:10,039
'The Indians here are more
fond of watching Hindi movies..

19
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:12,208
..than the Indians in India.'

20
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:17,113
'CaII it being away from

23
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:31,263
'Before coming to London,
Amar Joshi was in Banaras.'

24
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:38,874
'He's been watching movies
since he couIdn't even speak.'

25
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:44,041
'And when he Iearned to
speak he'd Ieave for schooI..

26
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,948
..but he wouId return
from the video parIour.'

27
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,509
You want to watch the movie.
You don't have money.

28
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,180
WorthIess chap! Get out of here!

29
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,057
Stop, stop, brother. Stop.

30
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:59,090
'When he grew oIder he
opened his own video Iibrary.'

'In aII these movies..'

34
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,904
Have you Iost your mind!

35
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,198
You watched a few fiIms..

36
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,004
..and you imagine
you are Raj Kapoor.

37
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,409
You want to make a fiIm.
What do you know about fiIm making?

38
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:14,875
What do you know?

39
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,012
Father, that's why I want to
join London schooI of fiIm making.

40
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,416
London? Are you pIanning
on seIIing the house so you can go?

41
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,878
What good is my jeweIIery?
- Keep your mouth shut!

42
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:24,320
You are the one
who has spoiIed him.

43
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,086
The son onIy wants to
go so he can study, right?

44
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,925
To study? PeopIe his age

45
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:32,157
..and he wants to go to study.
And London of aII pIaces.

46
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,923
There is no age Iimit
for making fiIms, father.

47
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,468
There is no age Iimit
to go insane either, son.

48
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,862
PeopIe are right when they say if
you have a vendetta with someone..

49
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,999
..either you Iure
him into a court case..

50
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:46,068
..or drive your oIder son into
fiIms. He wants to make a fiIm!

London schooI of fiIm making.'

54
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,919
'And he vowed never to
return untiI he makes a fiIm.'

55

'He works here at night so he
can afford his tuition in the day.'

56
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,227
Hi, Amar!

57
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:13,795
'Amar thought of cinema whiIe
eating, drinking and even sIeeping.'

58

'This is the case of
a femaIe reporter Indu Verma..

Amar, Amar, Amar!
-What, what, what?

62
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,451
You got the best
fiIm director award.

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,987
The best director of the year.
- I did?

64
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,554
Whoa!
- Hey, great work!

65
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,454
So when are you doing it here?

66
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,858
Over here? No, no, no, no.
I'II make my first fiIm in India.

67
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,520
Have you gone insane?
- Why insane?

68
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,593
It is an Indian subject
so I have to make it in India.

69
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,164
What are you saying? - I've heard
it is very tough over there.

70
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:44,859
It is tough but..
You guys know Suraj, no?

71
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:48,031
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Suraj Pandey.
- He's very connected in BoIIywood.

72
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,205
HopefuIIy I wiII
get a chance quickIy.

73
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,934
'If his dream is fuIfiIIed..

00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:55,503
..very soon in the Indian
theatres Amar's scream..

75
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:58,942
..sorry, Indu Verma's
screams wiII be heard.'

76
00:05:59,051 --> 00:05:59,983
HeIIo.

77
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,452
HeIIo, I..
I.. HeIIo, is Suraj there?

78
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,414
Sir is in a meeting. Who is this?

79
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:05,955
Oh, he's in a meeting

80
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:09,426
Okay, pIease inform him
Amar Joshi caIIed from London.

81
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,962
Amar?!

82
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,831
Suraj?
- How are you?

83
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,094
I am good. How are you?

84
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,931
Work is good.
The shooting is on day and night.

85
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,063
Listen, I am coming to
Mumbai the day after tomorrow.

86
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,265
Mumbai? I have a shooting
the day after tomorrow as weII.

87
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,409
Why don't you just arrive at home?

88
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:34,243
You get swayed by Tina.
She is a Iiar.

89
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,550
I was onIy Iooking at her hand.
I wasn't doing anything eIse.

90
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,882
Excuse me.
Where wiII I find Mr. Suraj Pandey?

91
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,983
You don't trust me?

92
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,051
Excuse me.
- You aIways doubt me.

93
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,120
Excuse me, Mr. Suraj Pandey..
- Shut up!

94
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,324
Not you. You.. I am Iosing my mind.

95
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,198
Listen to me.
We shaII discuss this Iater.

96
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:54,899
Brother, where can I find Suraj?

97
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,141
It's been twenty-five episodes.
I haven't got one Iine to say.

98
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,010
They just get us into
a queue at aII times.

99
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,049
Excuse me, where can I find Mr.
Suraj Pandey?

100
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:12,818
Where wiII I get Suraj Pandey?

101
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,958
You wiII find him inside. He's
got a Iine to say today. Go in.

102
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,359
Come on, throw a card.

103
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,465
Say haiI Sri Ram!

104
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:23,096
Lord, the task has begun.

105
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:24,528
What task?

106
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,570
The ocean has begun.

107
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:28,601
Cut it! One more.

108
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,408
HaiI Sri Ram! HaiI Sri Ram!

109
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,306
HaiI Sri Ram! HaiI Sri Ram!

110
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,036
Lord, it's done.

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,348
The task of buiIding
the bridge on the ocean.

112
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,411
Yes. The task of cre..
- Cut!

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,084
Ravi!
- Yes sir.

114
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,485
TeII him the diaIogue properIy.

115
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,453
What's the matter?
- What is this?

116
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,549
What are you doing?

117
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,326
The task of buiIding
the bridge on the ocean.

118
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:50,987
The task of buiIding the bridge..
- You won't be abIe to do it.

119
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,497
Sorry, sorry. One Iast chance.
- One second.

120
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,227
I'm very sorry, sir.

121
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,961
I said Sati by mistake.

122
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:03,238
Ravi, you want me to
come and say the diaIogue?!

123
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:07,436
Cut it!

124
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:12,976
Lord!

125
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,979
Lord, it's happened.
- What has happened?

126
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,486
I got a headache.

127
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,955
Get someone eIse to say this Iine.

128
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,423
Ravi! Come here!

129
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,221
Where did you find him?

130
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:25,023
He does not know
to say the diaIogue.

131
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,359
The monkey can say it better.

132
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,332
Go bring a monkey that
can say the diaIogue.

133
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,026
Suraj?

134
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,794
Amar?

135
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,904
You said you're shooting with star..
- Listen.

136
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,199
Listen. Listen to me.

137
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's go from here. Come on.

138
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,038
Where are we going?

139
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,279
ApparentIy you dropped
the bags and came here directIy.

140
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:46,578
I did not recognize you.

141
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,479
The gIasses and
moustache has vanished.

142
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:52,149
Never mind me. Look at you.
I did not recognize you.

143
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,224
This is make-up. It wiII come off
when the shooting is over.

144
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,555
CouIdn't you find another roIe?

145
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,497
PIenty. But I am
deIiberateIy doing this roIe.

146
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:03,534
What do you mean?
- What I mean..

147
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,469
Look brother, this is show business.
Whatever is visibIe is saIeabIe.

148
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:11,001
But his price factor is
decided by where he is visibIe.

149
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,809
No, no. What are you saying?

150
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,509
I am teIIing you that the actor
who is visibIe on teIevision..

151
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,148
..is not saIeabIe in fiIms.

152
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,485
And I want to be visibIe in fiIms.

153
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,949
That's why it is essentiaI
my face is fresh.

154
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:28,254
And staying in Mumbai
is essentiaI to seII in fiIms.

155
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,124
And one has to have money to stay.

156
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:33,063
Hence I'm seIIing on teIevision
without showing my face.

157
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:34,189
Just for survey.

158
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,565
Not survey. SurvivaI.
- Yes, yes.

159
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,800
Your EngIish hasn't improved
as yet. - No, no.

160
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,530
It's aII addiction.

161
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:46,310
Not addiction. It is dedication.
- ExactIy.

162
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,278
Why are you saying
this in front of everyone?

163
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,872
So why do you try
to speak in EngIish?

164
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,246
I can speak but
I can't foIIow that..

165
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:54,218
..because you know
you has so much..

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,912
HeIIo.
- Yes.

167
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:57,956
You want me to send you

For which fiIm were

184
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,046
It wasn't a fiIm.
It was a shot for a seriaI.

00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,887
But you Iook Iike a fiIm hero.

At the start I had to struggIe

So say that.

The entire industry

00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,113
Suraj. - I won't Iet those
rascaIs get away with it.

Suraj, sit, sit.

00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,558
They couIdn't

00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:33,128
You see.. Did you see how
an extraordinary actor was..

00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,537
Made ordinary, right.
- Made me an extra.

244
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,305
I won't Iet the rascaIs get away.

00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,844
Industry men, I'm coming!

246

Amar, my head is aching.

258
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:45,270
Did you trick me into drinking
a IocaI drink instead of scotch?

259
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,904
If a Scotsman had drunk
so much aIcohoI even he'd be out.

260
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,504
WhiIe drinking I thought
it wouId faII short.

261
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,015
I wasn't getting a kick.

262
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:55,018
Did I say anything
unbecoming to you, Amar?

263
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,279

Check out the numbers in

00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:25,041
..but getting through
to fiIm offices is difficuIt.

279
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,250
So you've forgotten everything

Eat yogurt and you remain unhurt.

A hardcore journaIist.
She's very sincere, sir.

00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,227
And she's probing a medicine scam..

331

00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,516
What happens then is that it rains.

339
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,823
The heroine is eating
ice-cream in the rain.

340
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,583
Some hoodIums are
eating corn near by.

341
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,591
The heroine runs.

342
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,421
The hoodIums are chasing her.
The heroine faIIs.

343
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,024
The hoodIums are aII over her.

344
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,899
In this commotion the
heroine's sari rides up.

345
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:09,102
And our camera rides up too.

346
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:13,939
The heroine goes to the poIice
station to make a compIaint.

347
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:17,470
The poIice inspector teIIs
her to sit. I shaII make a report.

348
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,340
But Iet me make an enquiry first.

349
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:21,816
Second rape!

350
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,989
The heroine says,
counseIIor, pIease take my case.

351
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,182
The counseIIor says,
yes, I shaII take on your case.

352
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,954
I shaII sureIy take on your case..

353
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,495
..but Iet me prepare
the case first, my Iove.

354
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,097
Third rape!

355
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,400
The heroine gets there first.

356
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,267
But the hoodIums have
arrived there first.

357
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,400
The heroine fIees.
The hoodIums behind her.

358
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:48,010
Oh Lord!
The heroine's body is drenched.

359
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:51,077
The hoodIums are frisky.
- Enough, sir.

360
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,507
Enough of your story.
- Why?

361
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,553
Make a bIue fiIm if you must.

362
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,118
I'II make it. I'II make that as
weII but Iet's see your subject..

363
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,116
You are pretty frustrated, buddy.

364
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,154
Be that as it may.
He raped your story.

365
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,359
Why did you go to that
office in the first pIace?

366
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,594
How was I to know?

367
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:12,301
There was no sign outside..

368
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:14,531
..saying stories are raped
here aIong with the heroines.

369
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:18,602
Treat me to some coconut water.

370
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,136
Give me, give me.

371
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,877
This is caIIed struggIing.

372
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:32,083
You wiII find various kinds
of peopIe everyday, my brother.

373
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:34,653
I see.

374
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,124
That means I wiII
find good peopIe too.

375
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:39,862
It's good.

376
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:44,959
When you toId me a woman
is raped in your fiIm..

377
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:49,469
..I feIt it was one
more movie on moIestation.

378
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:53,938
Everybody is making
fiIms on sex these days.

379
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,346
Take a seat.

380
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,113
You won't beIieve this, sir.

381
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:02,409
One producer suggested Indu
get raped four to five times.

382
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:05,013
Four to five times?
- Yes sir. And that's not aII.

383
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,454
He even suggested
how the rape shouId be..

384
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:10,186
..who shouId rape her and
what the situation shouId be.

385
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,221
What can one say?

386
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,367
If one has to make
money showing bodies..

387
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,264
..one shouId make bIue fiIms.

388
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,829
ExactIy sir.
That's exactIy what I said.

389
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:24,107
Passion.

390
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,604
Passion of Christ.

391
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:29,341
How much money was earned?

392
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:30,979
Devotion.

393
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,142
Power onIy comes from devotion.

394
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,419
Mr. Joshi, in our community..

395
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,623
..a woman is conferred
the titIe of mother. A mother.

396
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,618
Sure, sir.
- Right?

397
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:41,449
She is considered a goddess.
- Yes.

398
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:51,367
If a goddess embodies
her and she exacts vengeance.

399
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,297
I don't get it, sir.

400
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:59,176
The goddess on a tiger.

401
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,239
On high speed.

402
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:03,941
A trident in Indu's hand.

403
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,284
Mantras are being chanted
in the background.

404
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,230
No!

405
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,024
Sir..
- What's the matter?

406
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,396
forgot to go to the tempIe, sir.

407
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,437
May I return after a visit
to the tempIe? - Yes.

408
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,271
I'II be back in two minutes, sir.

409
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:30,899
Did you visit the tempIe then?

410
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,140
I am pIanning on
going to the HimaIayas.

411
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,612
Making a fiIm is nothing
short of doing penance.

412
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,578
If onIy the producers
wouId understand.

413
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,488
Nobody understands
the emotion of my subject.

414
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,219
Everyone wiII understand.
Every dog has his day.

415
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,027
Quiet. You wiII have your day too.
Go to sIeep.

416
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,893
Good night.
- Good night.

417
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,964
I'm sorry.
I couIdn't controI myseIf.

418
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:03,306
So sorry.

419
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,935
See, I can see the
character of the heroine.

420
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:12,044
And the Iawyer and the
owner of the press. Superb.

421
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,010
You see, very touching script.
Very touching.

422
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,280
Thank you, ma'am.
- Touching.

423
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,446
Thank you very much.

424
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,857
I shouId be the one to thank you.

425
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:24,451
You see, after Mother India
no director has shown a heroine..

426
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,020
..in such a powerfuI roIe.
- Thank you, ma'am.

427
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,363
I've been wanting to make this
subject since two years, ma'am.

428
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:33,097
And what titIe have you thought of?

429
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:34,605
Ma'am, 'Scream.'

430
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,374
No, no. FIop, fIop, fIop.

431
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,943
The producer wiII starve.

432
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,312
Whose scream?
- Whose scream?!

433
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,347
Whose scream. K factor, okay.

434
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:49,285
From 'Kashmir ki
kaIi' to 'KaI ho na ho.'

435
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:54,322
And what was that? Jadoo..
- 'Koi miI gaya', ma'am.

436
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:58,488
Yes. 'Kabhi khushi kabhi gham.'
K factor. Super duper hit.

437
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,229
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:04,197
And what is the name
of the heroine's character?

439
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:07,097
Indu Verma, ma'am.

440
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:11,908
No, no. See, K. KamIa Verma.
- Okay, ma'am.

441
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:13,838
There shouId be a K.

KoIkatta, you see.

445
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,044
ShaII I do something, ma'am?

446
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:29,020
ShaII I change my name
from Amar to Kamar Joshi, ma'am?

447
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,458
Fantastic!
Then it wouId be amazing.

448
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:37,857
ShaII I return

449
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,370
Fine. Things wiII

Okay. I shaII Ieave then.

Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

453
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,873
AII you need is to add

454
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:56,178
Punjab cIoses when
he Iands one punch.

455
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,188
Sir, but my heroine..
- You can keep her.

456
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:01,417
There shouId be some
Yash Chopra type romance.

457
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:05,292
Chandni. When Sridevi
appears wearing a white sari..

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,896
..DeIhi and UP is cIosed.

But, sir, Indu Verma's rape..
- Keep it. Keep it.

460
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,036
There is great scope
for emotion in our story.

461
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:19,173
But Indu is aIone. Put her
parents and sibIings with her.

462
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:22,577
The frame shouId Iook fuII. Just
Iike 'Kabhi khushi kabhi gham.'

463
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:24,343
Oversees cIosed.

Sir, there is emotion, but..
- Keep it. Keep it.

465
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:33,318
Comedy. Funny scenes.
Johny Lever type.

466
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,925
What was the name of
that movie? Hera Pheri. - Yes.

467
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:38,825
It is a hit. ExactIy Iike that.

If the fiIm is made Iike
that Mumbai is aIso cIosed. Yes.

469
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,061
That is weII and good but..
- Keep it, keep it.

470
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:50,373
'Kaata Iagaa.'

471
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:56,443
Sexy item song number.
Like Kaata Iagaa.

472
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:58,112
Keep it.

473
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,812
Then Bihar, BhopaI, 20 branch remain

474
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,553
But sir..

Keep it. Keep this and keep that.
Keep everything.

476

So keep it. - What do I keep?
How do I keep it?

477
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:15,789
I am teIIing the kid

478
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,358
CoId drinks are here.
Drink it and cooI down.

479
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,272
UncIe said you owe him
four hundred twenty rupees.

480
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,207
TeII your uncIe I wiII
return it when I get a break.

00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:30,247
Try coming to me for an autograph.

00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:31,939
I am tired, man.

483
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,544
Come. Come.

484
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,823
Come. Come.

485
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,089
The one who has made
severaI fiIms on dacoits.

486
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,326
Why wouId he make
a fiIm on my story?

487
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,423
What's the harm in meeting him?

488
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,469
Meet him once.
- A story about a woman.

489
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:52,501
PIease handIe it, uncIe.

You Iooted the entire viIIage

00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,168
Now the dacoits wiII come..

492
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,825
You haven't become a dacoit
of your own wish. - Okay.

00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,525
Sethia of the dacoits..

..destroyed your parents.

00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:32,266
First you've got to avenge
them with bIazing eyes.

496
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,538
You take the gun and
pump buIIets into them.

497
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:38,847
Our movie wiII be a super hit.
The pubIic wiII appIaud.

AbsoIuteIy.

505
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,334
He just done direction
intercourse from..

506
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:01,031
Not intercourse.
I have done a course on direction.

507
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:03,403
ExactIy, exactIy, exactIy.
He's going to from London.

508
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:05,503
Who are you?

509
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:09,803
When you don't know EngIish,
why speak it?

510
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,415
Who are you, sir?
-Now you're worried about my hand.

511
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,152
Is this your first fiIm?

512
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,157
Yes.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:21,192
Very good.

514
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:25,155
Make a superb fiIm,
work hard on the story..

515
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:32,066
..that wiII shake the entire
industry and the audience.

516
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:34,600
Yes sir.

517
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:38,104
Now teII me your story in one Iine.
- TeII him. TeII him.

518
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,124
Mind bIowing.

519
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,231
You wiII bIow the audiences mind.

520
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,366
Freeze!

521
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:04,867
Thank him, thank him.

522
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,760
Thank you sir. Thank you.

523
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:08,464
Why don't you do this?

524
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,239
No.

525
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:13,040
Was Indu raped?
- She was.

526
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,469
Turn her into a dacoit.
- Do it, do it, do it.

527
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,407
We wiII, sir.

528
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,516
Wipe the vermiIIion off her head!

529
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:22,915
Hand her a gun and
turn her into a dacoit!

530
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:27,354
She wiII be give big hit.
Turn her into a dacoit.

531
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:30,019
Do it, do it, do it.
- Yes, yes. Done, sir. Done.

532
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,392
Your Iife is set, buddy!

533
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:36,058
Bring tea for this rascaI director.

534
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:39,896
I want to treat him to tea.
He's got a wonderfuI story, man!

535
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:43,369
Never mind tea. Bring water first.

536
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:45,570
How the...

537
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,845
I have started swearing
Iistening to him.

538
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,311
Was he a director or
a dictionary on swear words?

539
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,147
No, no. He just taIks Iike that.
He's made eight to ten fiIms.

540
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,152
He is abusive but if he Iikes
the story he wiII give you a break.

541
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:58,584
Instead of becoming
a director with him..

542
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,346
..I wouId prefer to
become a dacoit myseIf.

543
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,867
ShaII I begin narrating the
script to you, sir? -It's coming.

544
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,461
We shaII begin everything together.

545
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,247
Have some.
- I don't drink.

546
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:25,578
Go on, take it.
- No sir. Thank you.

547
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,281
WonderfuI, wonderfuI!

548
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:35,025
Look at her eyes.

549
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:38,221
They are just Iike Lara Dutta's,
aren't they?

550
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,665
Look at her nose.
Isn't it just Iike Ash's?

551
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,168
And her entire body..
What is that caIIed?

552
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,036
It is just Iike NicoIe Backman's.

553
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,373
Not Backman. It is Kidman.

554
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:55,469
What difference does it make?
- I am Ieaving, sir.

555
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,951
No, no, sit, sit. We shaII finaIise
both, the story and heroine.

556
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,044
No sir, some other day. Okay, sir.

557
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,589
No, no, sit. Listen to me.
- No, sir. PIease, sir. Thank you.

558
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:16,399
Is this your sitting?

559
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,561
Things aren't as you are thinking.

560
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,067
I am not thinking.
I am seeing everything.

561
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,538
No, no, she is.. Him.. Him..

562
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,103
Why are you hiding your face?

563
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:31,446
What?!

564
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:34,044
I am a director.

565
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,842
It's boring.

566
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:10,249
What wiII run or what not.

567
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,851
Nobody know this.

568
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:22,498
Nobody know,
What wiII run or what not

569
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:28,236
Everything is seIIing,
Don't when wiII happen.

570
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:32,436
Making that which
is Iike to heart.

571
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:38,515
Joshi has set out to make a fiIm.

572
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:43,114
I wonder when I wiII make the fiIm.
I was better off in Banaras.

573
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:47,046
I shouId have Iistened to
my father. I don't know what to do.

574
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,217
Go back.

575
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,428
In your dreams.

576
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:56,260
Such smaII taIk from you
in front of such a huge ocean!

577
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,898
What eIse can I do?

578
00:32:58,002 --> 00:33:00,095
It wiII happen, it wiII.
Everything wiII happen. -What?

579
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,537
The heart is an ocean.
The sea is in front of you.

580
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,069
Look, remain this way. You
shouId remain happy just Iike that.

581
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:09,907
Let's go and refresh our mind.

582
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:12,144
Where?
- Come aIong.

583
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:15,481
Where are we going?
- Come aIong, brother. Come.

584
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:18,953
This is caIIed a fiImy party.

585
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,056
Very good! Very good! Come on!

586
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:25,322
Where have you brought me?
- Do not worry. You wiII enjoy.

587
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:27,296
And now the bar is open.

588
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:30,967
Move! Move! I wiII get it first!

589
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,229
I wiII get to it first!

590
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,245
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

591
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:49,384
Suraj!

592
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,485
Hey! GIass..

593
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:54,188
Suraj! From where are you speaking?

594
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,059
One minute.

595
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:05,900
Suraj?

596
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,065
What's going on, Suraj?

597
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:14,905
The bar opened up.
- Yes. So?

598
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,942
It does not remain
open aII the time.

599
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:19,415
Take the gIass.
- No, no, I don't drink aIcohoI.

600
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,849
It's BIack LabeI, buddy.

601
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:22,852
Whether it's bIack or whether
it's white, I don't drink aIcohoI.

602
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,012
At Ieast hoId it in your hand.

603
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:25,578
If peopIe see two
gIasses in my hand..

604
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,086
..what impression wiII
peopIe have about Suraj Kumar?

605
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:31,554
I see. As though many
peopIe know you over here.

606
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:34,462
PIease don't drive me crazy.

607
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,957
Look!

608
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,327
I'II introduce you to him.
He's a veteran in the industry.

609
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,927
It shatters into pieces.

610
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:44,463
Greetings, sir. How are you, sir?
- Greetings.

611
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,339
God is mercifuI, sir.
This is my friend, Amar.

612
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,069
HeIIo.
- He's a director.

613
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,242
He has compIeted a course
on direction in London, sir.

614
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,297
I have an amazing subject for you.

615
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:13,459
Mr. Yash asked for it. Mr. Bhatt
asked for it. Mr. Raj asked for it.

616
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,900
But I wiII give it to you.
-ActuaIIy, sir, I have a subject.

617
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:21,174
Fantastic! WeII done!

618
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,078
That means you've
here fuIIy prepared.

619
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:25,046
Yes sir.

620
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:26,475
You probabIy need someone
to write the diaIogues.

621
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,211
We have you for that,
don't we, sir?

622
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:32,586
God wiIIing! It's his first fiIm.
It shouId be expIosive.

623
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,448
Yes, yes.
- Have you finaIised the heroine?

624
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:36,550
No sir. A IittIe..
- Tabassum.

625
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,528
Come over here. What are you
doing over there? - Yes.

626
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:42,464
I want you to meet him.
He has come from London.

627
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,397
He's done a course on direction.

628
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,233
He wishes to make a fiIm over here.
He's Iooking for a heroine.

629
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:49,330
What? Wow! - He is the one
about whom I toId you.

630
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:53,036
I wouId Iove to work with you.

631
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,502
You shouId take a Iook
at this aIbum for now.

632
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,446
It's hot and sensuaI.
It's beautifuI. Take it.

633
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:01,010
Look at it. Look at it.

634
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,151
It's nice. But we..

635
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,985
So I'II come to
your office tomorrow.

636
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,323
Office?

637
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:15,127
No probIem. I'II come to
your house tomorrow. Story sitting.

638
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,033
Suraj?

639
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:22,405
Look, Mr.
Khanna, he is making a fiIm.

640
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,998
'Pyar hi pyar, kitni baar.'

641
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:27,009
How many times wiII he
make a fiIm on the same subject?

642
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:31,203
One can't teII whether it's a
story of Iove or a story of Ioved.

643
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,248
Sit, sit, sit.

644
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,982
And the pubIic is very
smart these days, Mr. Khanna.

645
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,850
Forgive me but the
pubIic is very smart.

646
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:38,989
They know everything.

647
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:42,082
There's a star who appears
on teIevision everyday.

648
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,124
He is seen award sometimes.

649
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:46,129
He's seen seIIing a car sometimes.

650
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,957
Sometimes he is
seen seIIing biscuits.

651
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:49,556
So why wiII the pubIic watch him?

652
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:51,868
But sir, a fiIm doesn't
run without a star.

653
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:53,469
Yes, that is true.
- Sorry, sir.

654
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:21,856
Do you have a good subject?
- I do, sir.

655
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:23,923
In that case,
come see me at my office tomorrow.

656
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,161
Okay
- Of course, sir.

657
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,168
MobiIe. It's a very bad habit.

658
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:33,075
Take my card and come
and see me tomorrow, okay?

659
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,371
Thank you, sir.
- I Iike it. Good. I Iike it.

660
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:36,437
Thank you, sir.

661
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,940
Fifty to sixty heroines
were dancing over there.

662
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,075
Do your shooting over here.
It wiII be fun.

663
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:43,484
Okay sir. Okay,
sir, I'II see you tomorrow, sir.

664
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:45,549
But controI yourseIf.
ControI yourseIf.

665
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:55,232
Where are you going
so earIy in the morning?

666
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,000
I have a meeting.
- At the tempIe?

667
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:02,561
It is a fiIm office.
CaII before you go.

668
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:12,440
HeIIo.

669
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,451
Good morning.
May I speak with Mr. Monty?

670
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,986
He wiII come after 12:00 PM.

671
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,081
Okay.

672
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,145
What happened?

673
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,222
He caIIed me after 12:00 PM.

674
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,159
Go to sIeep for a coupIe of hours.
You can go after that.

675
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,430
I am not here to sIeep.

676
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:34,903
Don't scare me, brother.
Save your enthusiasm.

677
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,838
It wiII be usefuI Iater.

678
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:41,470
He's taking stress needIessIy.

679
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:46,074
No, no, Pandey caIIed yesterday.

680
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,377
He said, PIease come, Mr.
Monty and watch the triaI..

681
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,851
..and do a post-mortem on it.

682
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:51,817
So I did it. I did the post-mortem.

683
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:54,320
I said the fiIm won't run.
He got nervous. He asked me, why?

684
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,050
I said, How can it run?

685
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,885
There is onIy
Iocation in the fiIm..

686
00:38:57,962 --> 00:38:59,122
..there is no situation.

687
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,958
There are many stars
in the fiIm but no story.

688
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,791
There is a Iot
of action in the fiIm.

689
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:04,892
Bombs going off everywhere..

690
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,766
..but there is Iess
sensuaIity and comedy.

691
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,464
Come, come, come.

692
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:37,925
My business. I'm into three P's.

693
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:41,165
Poster, pubIicity and PRO.

694
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:46,832
But now I'm trying to enter
the first stage. Production.

695
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:51,142
I'm pIanning on making a
fiIm that's why I invited you here.

696
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:52,273
TeII me. TeII me the story.

697
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,409
The name of my fiIm is Scream.

698
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,554
Scream is a story on Indu Verma.

699
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,029
Hundred days.

700
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:18,939
Good pubIicity. SiIver jubiIee.

701
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:22,112
TabIe profit, twenty miIIion.

702
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,277
Whichever heroine does the
roIe she'II get nation award..

703
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,417
Tea or coffee?

704
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:30,011
No, no, no, no, no, no.

705
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:33,913
StruggIing this way won't bear
fruit. It does not work that way.

706
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:35,319
Are fiIms made Iike that?

707
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:37,616
FiIms are not made, darIing.

708
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,225
ProposaIs are made over here.
I know.

709
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:42,390
I am in the Iine.
I am in the Iine. I know.

710
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:50,568
The first thing we have to
do is snare a very good heroine.

711
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,539
Snare?
- I mean we'II have set it up.

712
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:56,603
We must set up the affair.

713
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,072
Once we have a
heroine in our grip..

714
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:04,486
..producers wiII get
in a queue outside our homes.

715
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:07,991
In a queue, darIing. I know it.
- Okay.

716
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,085
WeII, teII me something.
WiII what's her name?

717
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,195
She's doing very weII these days.

00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,458
Ash?
- Mohini. WiII Mohini do?

719
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,163
But wiII we ensnare Mohini, sir?

720
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,862
I mean to say,
wiII Mohini work with us?

721
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,501
DarIing, if you have a story,
I have a mother.

722
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,033
I mean, Gupta, her secretary.

723
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:28,974
HoId on a minute. Let me caII.

724
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,216
I. I made Mohini. EIse who was she?

725
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,515
Nothing. Nothing.

726
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:42,183
Nobody bothered to invite her
to the office. - I know. I know.

727
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:45,023
But I saw her.. What is it?
- TaIent.

728
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:45,993
Yes.

729
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:50,027
If a jeweIIer does not
authenticate a diamond..

730
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,532
..what good is a diamond?
- It is a stone.

731
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,103
Yes, it is a stone.

732
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:57,266
But this boy is a genuine.
- Yes, he's a diamond.

733
00:41:57,341 --> 00:42:00,833
Yes.
- But he needs to be poIished.

734
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,536
You wouId usefuI in this case,
Mr. Gupta.

735
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:05,013
We'II have to make that for him.

736
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:07,147
What?
- Breeze. Breeze.

737
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,875
Let me teII you..
- Sir.

738
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:11,344
What are you doing, Mr.
Gupta? You are eating Iemon?

739
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:14,220
Eat tomato, eat onion.
I've ordered so many things.

740
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:15,082
Eat.

741
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,389
We have to make breeze.
- Yes, we have make breeze.

742
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:18,428
But, Mr. Gupta..

743
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:22,491
..if we give this
boy a proper push..

744
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:27,126
If we give him a push this boy
wiII be superstar. I teII you.

745
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:33,043
What's the matter?
- You've started aIready.

746
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:34,969
What happened?
Have I said too much?

747
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:36,603
It appears as though
I've said too much.

748
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:40,405
But there is one probIem.
- What's the probIem now?

749
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:43,146
In Manoj's story..
- Amar!

750
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,184
Yes.
- Amar, sir.

751
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:49,055
In Amar's story Mohini
wiII have to act.

752
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:51,217
Doesn't Mohini act, sir?

753
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:57,194
She does, brother.
She acts very much..

754
00:42:57,267 --> 00:43:01,328
..but I don't know what
goes wrong in front of the camera.

755
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,172
It is a fIop.

756
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:06,175
I teII you,
why don't you do this, Gupta?

757
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,446
We shaII get her to act. Just
set up a meeting with her mummy.

758
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:13,005
You ruined my mood.

759
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,917
She is such a nasty woman I
wouIdn't Iet her stand next to me.

760
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:21,287
But set up a meeting with her.
- I cannot toIerate her mother.

761
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,121
I can't stand her. No!

762
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:24,626
Mummy.
- Okay. It's okay.

763
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:26,259
For a narration.
- Greetings, mummy.

764
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,228
Greetings.

765
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,827
Let's go.
- Come.

766
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,558
ShaII we begin, mummy?
Hurry up and start.

767
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:36,534
It's a very good script.
- I have written this script myseIf.

768
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,097

00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,213
Okay, I..

00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:57,255
Come quick. Why are you rambIing?
Push the swing. - Yes.

774
00:44:00,964 --> 00:44:03,159
The story is about Indu Verma.

775
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,424
A journaIist who is fearIess and..
- Harder.

776
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:09,302
Indu Verma's story is about a..

777
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:12,206
Not you.
I was teIIing her. TeII me now.

778
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:16,036
What were you saying?

779
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:20,812
Indu Verma is a journaIist who
is probing a fake medicine scam.

780
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:22,377
WhiIe probing..

781
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:28,218
What's the matter, mummy

782
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:32,328
It is such a funny text.
PeopIe send the most amazing texts.

783
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,989
It is very funny. I'm sorry.

784
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,258
Yes, teII me. Sorry.

785
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:41,300
As Indu Verma probes deeper..

786
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:47,037
..she Iearns that the
big businessmen in the city..

787
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:58,447
Come, come, come. Johnny baby.

788
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:00,980
So sweet!

789
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,818
Yes. What were you saying?

790
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:06,194
Speak.

791
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:16,130
In the party..

792
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,329
Nonsense!

793
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,167
Utter nonsense!

794
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:21,467
Excuse me?
- I'm not getting a signaI.

795
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:24,977
Why don't you use
this phone, mummy?

796
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:27,145
It's a Nokia phone.
It is a very good company.

797
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:29,412
It's a good phone. A new modeI.
It's a good phone. Use it.

798
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:32,284
Does it get a signaI over here?
And time? - It's an amazing phone.

799
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,148
This is very nice.

800
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:37,117
Your story is good too.
- Thank you.

801
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:38,489
So keep both of them.

802
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:43,228
Mr. Gupta, arrange a sitting.
- Yes, mummy.

803
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,503
No! No!

804
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:02,183
For God's sake,
pIease Ieave me aIone. Let me go.

805
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,048
You guys think

806
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:21,871
My name is Assistant Commissioner
of PoIice Rajini MaIhotra.

807
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:25,608
The best of them get
scared when they hear my name.

808
00:46:40,357 --> 00:46:42,018
This job is so thankIess.

809
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,070
She doesn't have money.

810
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:00,973
I wouId take it.
- ReaIIy?

811
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:02,336
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

812
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:04,545
Baby. I'II be back.

813
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:06,815
She's gone.

814
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,044
He wiII convince her.
He's a very crafty person. I know.

815
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:11,115
Baby, pIease. One second.

816
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:13,480
One second.

817
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:15,048
Listen, Iisten.

818
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:22,393

What happened?

820
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:26,232
She had to go to
a charity function, so..

821
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:28,032
Why don't you simpIy say
she's gone to cut a ribbon?

822
00:47:28,105 --> 00:47:31,074
These days they get a coupIe
of Iakh rupees to cut a ribbon.

823
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:32,836
Don't fooI us.
What time tomorrow?

824
00:47:33,377 --> 00:47:34,207

825
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:08,243
Very expensive.
- Ma'am, the shot is ready.

826
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:10,376
Very fast director.

827
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:12,882
I have to go now.
I'II see you tomorrow, okay.

828
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,211
But you have a great idea. Bye.
- Thank you, ma'am.

00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:17,350
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

830
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:19,082
But she did not Iisten

831
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:20,817
This is BoIIywood.
This is how things work here.

00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:23,451
She got an idea Iooking at you.
Let's go, Iet's go.

Yeah.

Ma'am, Scream is a true story.

836
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,011
True story?

837
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:45,413
You know what? I Iove true stories.

Yes ma'am. Good. Ma'am,

Wow! Hard core journaIist?

846
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:15,406
She has a very interrogating
nature. She's gets into everything.

00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:18,778
Ma'am, ma'am. I mean,

HeIIo.

851
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:28,017
Hi Didi!

852
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:32,224
It's a new Iove story.
Two hours wiII be wasted.

853
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:34,559
How do we manage this way?
Do something.

854
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:37,061
We have to conduct the meeting.
Do something eIse.

855
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:38,525
Do not worry.

856
00:49:39,136 --> 00:49:42,230
Why don't we have it at
the mansion day after tomorrow?

857
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,172
We shaII bowI the mother
and daughter at the same time.

858
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,619
'What's this?'

859
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:10,526
'WhiIe Iistening to the story
Mohini was transported eIsewhere.'

860
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,160
Is awarded to Mohini.

861
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:26,244
'You see how powerfuI
Amar Joshi's story is?'

862
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:29,545
'Both the mother and daughter
had tears in their eyes.'

863
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,652
'Amar's eyes? Let the movie begin.'

864
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:46,900
You're right.
This medicine is counterfeit.

865
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:49,937
And this is the report.

866
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:53,442
We have to bring such
big names out in pubIic, sir.

867
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,000
We have to expose them, sir.

868
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:58,107
We cannot do anything
without evidence.

869
00:50:58,982 --> 00:51:01,075
I shaII bring the evidence, sir.

870
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:02,880
Cut. Cut, cut, cut, cut.

871
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:06,048
What you need to do here
is underpIay the whoIe thing.

872
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:07,180
Speak normaIIy.

873
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:09,122
Let's not make it Iook
Iike a hardcore commerciaI..

874
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,090
..commerciaI fiIm.

875
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,455
The more you want to pIay..

876
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:13,586
Look, Mohini, a IittIe..

877
00:51:19,836 --> 00:51:20,632
Take two!

878
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:35,476
Cut it, cut it. Cut it, cut it!

879
00:51:37,187 --> 00:51:41,055
Mohini, don't do it so Ioud.
Sorry, don't overact. - Yeah.

880
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:41,988
Don't do it.

881
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:21,930
Mohini, are you okay?
AbsoIuteIy fine?

882
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:25,434
Why are you overacting?
Why are you being fiImy?

883
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,093
Haven't you ever raped any..

884
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,070
You wiII print that news?
Then print this news as weII.

885
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,304

886
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:49,548
We needIessIy get

887
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:50,991
Everyone must be asIeep as yet.

888
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:51,993
Suraj!

889
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:27,223
I don't know.
I received a caII just now.

890
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:28,195
Listen him.

891
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:56,220
Amar, did you speak with Mr.
Monty.. Oh. Sorry.

892
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:58,385
Finish it, finish it.
Did you speak with Mr. Monty?

893
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:00,094
No.

894
00:54:01,131 --> 00:54:02,257
Even his mobiIe is off.

895
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:11,199
Who is it? You want me to
break down the door..

896
00:54:11,274 --> 00:54:12,070
I'm coming.

897
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:14,003
Who gave you the right
to break that door?

898
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:15,039
Move!

899
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:18,214
Are you Amar Joshi?
- What do you mean?

900
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:20,509
His face suggests
that he is a director.

901
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,448
Get Iost!
- Hey, is your name Amar Joshi?

902
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:23,451
Yes.

903
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:25,218
Come with me.
Don has summoned you.

904
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:26,520
Don who?

905
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:29,358
Come with me and you wiII find out.

906
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:39,964
Greetings, priest.
- Greetings, son.

907
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:41,469
Greetings, priest.

908
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:42,866
Greetings, priest.

909
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:43,997
Greetings, priest.

910
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:00,515
HeIIo. What did he say?

911
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:05,618
Is that what he said?

912
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:08,023
Is that what he said?

913
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:10,123
So why don't you..

914
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,925
No, no. You can shoot him there..

915
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:15,129
..but shoot the rascaI
in the front on behaIf of me.

916
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:16,871
Okay.

917
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:22,538
Priest, didn't I teII you
to drag the director over here?

918
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:24,240
I've brought him, don.

919
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:28,479
Yes, I am director.

920
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,313
Sit, sit. I don't know you. Sit.

921
00:55:36,926 --> 00:55:38,416
This is your first time, isn't it?

922
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:41,863
Excuse me?
-This is your first movie, isn't it?

923
00:55:42,365 --> 00:55:43,297
Yes.

924
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:44,965
Mine too.

925
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:48,165
That movie of yours is mine.

926
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:52,069
Monty has borrowed
a Iot of money from me.

927
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:56,106
When it was time to
pay the interest he ran off.

928
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:01,116
Had he requested me, I wouId
not shoot him. But now I wiII.

929
00:56:01,184 --> 00:56:04,244
I wiII shoot the rascaI
nice and proper now!

930
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:07,485
Don't stress over it.
You shouIdn't stress over things.

931
00:56:08,124 --> 00:56:09,591
My name is Sudama BhosIe.

932
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,055
Sudama BhosIe never
Ieaves anything incompIete.

933
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,554
The picture has to be made.

934
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:17,899
You and I wiII get
together and make it.

935
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:22,862
You have Iearned abroad..
What's that in EngIish?

936
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:25,497
You shouId use
aII the tricks in it.

937
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:27,440
The picture shouId be a hit.
That's aII.

938
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:33,980
Don't stress. Don't stress,
give stress to others.

939
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,148
Mr. Director, pIease reIieve
her of her stress. This is Tina.

940
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,390
Hi. How are you?

941
00:56:45,595 --> 00:56:48,189
Tina?
- She wants to be a heroine.

942
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:51,362
Turn her into a heroine
and return her stress to her.

943
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:58,836
But we have a heroine
in our movie, don.

944
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:07,780
You returned the stress to me!

945
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:17,993
Why don't you make
her the heroine's sister?

946
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:22,022
That's a fantastic idea, don!
- That's a great idea, don!

947
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:24,191
Are the two of
you Abbas and Mastan?

948
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:28,469
What the director thinks, right?

949
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:35,274
This is too much.
I won't do this.

950
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,640
Look. In any case,
I won't do this movie.

951
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:43,317
Listen, think once again.

952
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:45,547
We shaII do something.
- What wiII we do?

953
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:47,348
What wiII we do?

954
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:49,920
Are you my friend or foe?

955
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:54,157
I am Iike a brother to you.
He is a don!

956
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:58,830
So what am I supposed to do.
Compromise?

957
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:03,096
He has Tina to compromise with.

958
00:58:03,373 --> 00:58:05,170
He isn't asking to sIeep with you.

959
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:08,308
Even I know that.
I am referring to my story.

960
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:11,814
What story? Where's the story?
Your story is cIosed.

961
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:15,449
Start shooting first or he wiII
shoot you in the back. Nonsense!

962
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,486
He wiII shoot! Let him shoot!

963
00:58:21,324 --> 00:58:23,019
Suraj.
- Suraj is damned.

964
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:26,494
If Tina were..
- Mind bIowing! Mind bIowing!

965
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:28,189
TeII, teII.
- What mind bIowing?

966
00:58:28,264 --> 00:58:29,390
Let me speak first.
- TeII me.

967
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,262
Anything you say
wiII be good. TaIk.

968
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:36,096
If I make Tina Indu's sister and..

969
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,304
Doesn't work.
Where do I get it?

970
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,502
Get it from anywhere but
get it to Mumbai. That's aII.

971
00:58:41,577 --> 00:58:44,205
Mind bIowing, brother.
I'm teIIing you. Mind bIowing.

972
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:46,443
ActuaIIy I was thinking..

973
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,508
..that I shouId
Iook sad and not cry.

974
00:58:50,053 --> 00:58:51,042
Fine. Just Iook Iost.

975
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,315
In any case your younger
sister comes to consoIe you.

976
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:55,618
There's a smaII scene.
I am here, sister.

977
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:58,426
ShouId we take that?
Okay, readu. TeII Tina.

978
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:01,896
How do I Iook?
- Very nice.

979
00:59:01,964 --> 00:59:03,158
Very nice, right?
- Yes.

980
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,964
Suraj, didn't you teII..

981
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:06,899
I toId ma'am to
wear an Indian dress.

982
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:09,004
Why? What about when you
get the heroine to wear minis..

983
00:59:09,072 --> 00:59:11,040
..and make them dance in the snow?

984
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,099
Look, this is not
that kind of fiIm.

985
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:15,875
You are pIaying the roIe of
a middIe-cIass girI here.

986
00:59:15,945 --> 00:59:19,506
I watch aII the fiIms. No matter
what cIass the heroine comes..

987
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:22,181
..she aIways dresses weII.
That's exactIy what I want.

988
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:23,912
And she must Iook good to don.

989
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,215
Ma'am, these cIothes
won't do in this fiIm.

990
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,448
CaII BhosIe.
- Yes.

991
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,823
No need to caII. The shot is ready.

992
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:34,089
You remember the diaIogues?
- Yes.

993
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:37,394
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on, come on. Come aIong.

994
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:39,495
How do I make the fiIm Iike this?

995
00:59:39,802 --> 00:59:42,168
You teII me to compromise
over everything. - God!

996
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:44,336
I won't be abIe to do this.
- Do not worry.

997
00:59:44,407 --> 00:59:47,274
Look at her cIothes.
- AII wiII go weII. Don't worry.

998
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:50,244
Take the shot.
Everything is in your hands Iater.

999
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:52,247
Ready, ready. SiIence!

1000
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:54,515
RoII sound.

1001
00:59:55,985 --> 00:59:58,215
Sister, I'm here for you.
Why are you crying?

1002
00:59:58,287 --> 00:59:59,276

Why pack up? What's okay?

1079
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:55,628

He gave me just one diaIogue.

01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,962
You took entire day to
say one diaIogue.

1093
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,561
Did Pundit say this to you?

1094
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:34,127
Forget him.

1095
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,131
What do you say?

1096
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,404

We've onIy originaI CDS.

No CD is pirated.

1103
01:03:57,393 --> 01:03:58,223
But aII this..

1104
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,500

Item song.

1112
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:20,373
Why item song?

1113
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:24,146
Because don has aimed
a gun at me.

1114
01:04:24,353 --> 01:04:25,980
Gun?

1115
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:27,882
What an originaI situation?

1116
01:04:27,957 --> 01:04:29,322
Not that situation.

I know.
- No, sir. You don't..

1118

Come on.

1122

What are you doing?
Why are you taking so much time?

1123
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,388
Suraj went to get horse.

1124
01:05:01,457 --> 01:05:03,254
ShouId we stop fiIming for it?

1125

Hey! Take this horse (gun).

1127
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:09,557
Don, we don't want this.

We want Iadder to cIimb up.

I thought you wanted gun.

1130
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,131
Director, if you want, you
can take it. - No, sir.

1131
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,468
Keep it. I've many.

1132
01:05:18,808 --> 01:05:19,866
Take, take.

01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:35,949
I am young and beautifuI.
I'm a fairy taIe.

1134

01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:06,382
The charm is speII-binding.

1138
01:06:06,555 --> 01:06:09,922
Eyes are intoxicating.

1139
01:06:09,992 --> 01:06:13,291
Everyone is crazy for me.

1140
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:17,798
Life has become a
punishment now.

1141
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:21,227
SaIute to Iove..
- Cut it. Okay.

1142
01:06:21,537 --> 01:06:23,300
Sir, sir, what a song?

1143
01:06:23,472 --> 01:06:25,940
I swear,
it's bIoody abusing song.

1144
01:06:26,142 --> 01:06:28,906
ExpIain to your EngIish director.

1145
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:30,935
He says he doesn't want song.

1146

I know very weII what
the pubIic wants.

1147

You're right, don.

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,224
Not appIe, but appeaI.

Then what is to mean

1154

Now I can say, he's my brother

1159
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,180
Not brother,
but he's your father.

Don't you understand?

Take my heart. Make me yours.

KindIe the passion in heart.

1174
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:34,263
The charm is speII-binding.
Eyes are intoxicating.

1175

No, I never even came

Everything is fine.

1247
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:58,981

1248
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:08,726

..I had come to make fiIms.

1252

1254
01:15:32,285 --> 01:15:34,685

1255
01:15:35,188 --> 01:15:38,123
I had come to make fiIms.

1256
01:15:38,258 --> 01:15:41,421
In BoIIywood.

1257
01:15:41,694 --> 01:15:44,993
In BoIIywood.

1258
01:15:45,098 --> 01:15:49,194
I had come to make fiIms.

1259
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:53,703
I had come to make fiIms.

1260
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:10,785
Brother. Can I get some money?

1261
01:16:11,057 --> 01:16:13,287
Oh God! What a Iuck!

1263
01:16:15,762 --> 01:16:17,491
Hey..

Super duper hit.

1270
01:16:32,745 --> 01:16:34,610
Financiers are standing

01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:36,509
..to finance fiIm.

1272
01:16:36,816 --> 01:16:37,942

Of course.

01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:46,655
Come. Sit down in my new car.

1278
01:16:46,726 --> 01:16:49,559
But this car..
- Tyre and battery are new.

1279
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:54,523
AsIam Baig.

1280
01:16:55,535 --> 01:16:57,332
He has written many spicy fiIms.

1281
01:16:57,537 --> 01:17:00,165
But now he's writing your fiIm.
- What?

1282
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:02,741
Yes. You're a Iucky boy.

1283
01:17:03,209 --> 01:17:04,972
Nothing wiII happen.
I'm used to it.

1284
01:17:19,759 --> 01:17:21,124
Did you write the scene?

1285
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:22,618
Yes, sir.

1286
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:24,189
Hmm. Read it.

1287
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:29,098
Sir, the scene begins..

1288
01:17:30,803 --> 01:17:32,771
..moon is rising.

1289
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:35,667
It's not.

1290
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:41,703
Sun is hiding.

1291
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:47,149
Sir, our heroine is going
towards coIIege.

1292
01:17:49,422 --> 01:17:50,446
She's not going.

1293
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:54,585
I mean, she's coming.
- Hmm.

1294
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:58,426
Yes. She comes towards
our neighbour Naresh.

1295
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,562
Towards Mahesh.

1296
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:08,430

1297
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:10,303
Towards Suraj.
- Suresh.

1298
01:18:11,411 --> 01:18:12,435
Sir.

1299
01:18:13,012 --> 01:18:14,070
She Iooks in anger.

1300
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:17,375
She doesn't.

1301
01:18:24,257 --> 01:18:26,487
I mean, she Iooks with Iove.

1302
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:28,983
And then..

1303
01:18:33,366 --> 01:18:35,300
..eyes are Iocked.

1304
01:18:36,536 --> 01:18:37,264
And..

1305
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,613
Song starts.

1306
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:58,246
Kid..
- Yes.

1307
01:18:59,992 --> 01:19:03,223
At times you shouId write
something without making me speak.

1308
01:19:03,429 --> 01:19:04,293
Yes.

1309
01:19:05,364 --> 01:19:07,264
You get saIary from the producer.
- Yes.

1310
01:19:08,067 --> 01:19:09,694
You get conveyance too.
- Yes.

1311
01:19:11,237 --> 01:19:13,296
You were haIf this weight when
you came from Benaras.

1312
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:17,202
HaIf weight is of Mumbai
fiIm industry. - Yes.

1313
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:20,575
So don't be disIoyaI.
You shouId write something.

1314
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:22,045
Okay.

1315
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:23,480
Monty must be here.

1316
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:27,476
Wow.

1317
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:30,647
Wow.

1318
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,055
Great.

1319
01:19:35,528 --> 01:19:36,324
Amar.

1320
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:38,187
My brother.

1321
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:42,128
You're not saying something
negIigent.

1322
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:43,063
Yes.

1323
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:46,002
You're saying a very big
thing in this fiIm.

1324
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:52,372
Not even big fiIm makers dared
to say such a thing in years.

1325
01:19:52,545 --> 01:19:54,172
Thank you, sir.
- Scream.

1326
01:19:55,448 --> 01:19:57,040
This fiIm is a scream.
- No.

1327
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,511
No, no. Not Scream but Rape.

1328
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,247
Baig, the fiIm has been
renamed to Rape.

1329
01:20:03,055 --> 01:20:04,488
It's wrong, madam.

1330
01:20:06,425 --> 01:20:09,690
What Scream conveys,
isn't in Rape.

1331
01:20:11,764 --> 01:20:13,493
This EngIish wiII..

1332
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:14,462
What?

1333
01:20:15,401 --> 01:20:18,529
This EngIish wiII doom us.
- Yes.

1334
01:20:18,604 --> 01:20:19,628
Sir, you're right.

1335
01:20:20,573 --> 01:20:21,437
SarIa..

1336
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:25,110
..this boy came from Benaras.

1337
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:30,073
And he'II make Hindi fiIm.

1338
01:20:31,217 --> 01:20:34,584
He needs guidance of
peopIe Iike us.

1339
01:20:36,589 --> 01:20:37,681
And so we're here.

1340
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:45,463
Indu Verma's scream
echoed in Mumbai.

1341
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:48,229
Now it'II echo in entire India.

1342
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:52,636
I've thought of a stunning entry.

1343
01:20:55,508 --> 01:20:56,668
But where is she going?

1344
01:20:58,578 --> 01:21:00,239
On hunt.
- Hunt?

1345
01:21:01,514 --> 01:21:02,538
In party.

1346
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:07,619
PeopIe are partying, not Indu.

1347
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,406
Undercover journaIist.

1348
01:21:36,983 --> 01:21:38,382
I understand journaIist,
Mr. Baig.

1349
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:39,748
But what was aII before that?

1350
01:21:39,986 --> 01:21:42,284
MotorcycIe and dancing in disco.

1351
01:21:42,555 --> 01:21:46,389
Amar,
dancing and singing is an excuse.

1352
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,026
The reaI topic is to make
heroine's entry memorabIe.

1353
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:52,758
You've done that, sir.

1354
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:56,362
Baig, you've gIued audience
to its seat.

1355
01:21:56,435 --> 01:21:58,767
Yes, Mr. Baig.

1356
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:04,001
I give one jubiIee
to this kid too.

1357
01:22:05,645 --> 01:22:07,613
JubiIee, my foot!

1358
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:10,745
TroubIed souI!
Why are you troubIed?

1359
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:12,241
What happened?

1360
01:22:12,718 --> 01:22:15,209
Nothing yet.
But a Iot can happen.

1361
01:22:15,288 --> 01:22:18,086
It wiII sureIy happen.
You don't be tense. - Why not?

1362
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:19,555
You don't understand anything.

1363
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:21,317
I was writing the
story of my fiIm.

1364
01:22:21,427 --> 01:22:23,327
Now as it's a big fiIm,
Mr. Baig is writing it.

1365
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:27,056
So what's there to worry.
He has written many hit fiIms.

1366
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,667
That's my worry.

1367
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:33,795
You want to make a fIop fiIm.

1368
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,671
I want to make my fiIm.

1369
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:37,264
Did you understand?

1370
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,502
You won't understand?

1371
01:22:39,078 --> 01:22:40,978
That's why you're struggIing
for so many years.

1372
01:22:43,015 --> 01:22:44,505
I understood.

1373
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:46,679
Story is yours,
but Mr. Baig is writing it.

1374
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:49,781
Mr. Baig's and your thoughts
are different.

1375
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:53,583
Look, he'II sureIy put something.
He won't Ieave it.

1376
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:55,755
But you don't Ieave your story.
Grasp it.

1377
01:22:56,028 --> 01:22:57,188
Grasp it.
- Yes.

1378
01:22:57,663 --> 01:22:59,460
I'II grasp onIy when
he Iet's go of it.

1379
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,065
It's futiIe.

1380
01:23:03,135 --> 01:23:05,000
He'II change..
- Amar, this is industry.

1381
01:23:05,137 --> 01:23:07,128
No matter what how much he graps,
you don't Ieave it..

1382
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:09,264
..and don't grasp what he Ieaves.

1383
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:11,102
Both shouId hoId what you've got.

1384
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,644
So I've taken it..

1385
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:15,213
Do you get it?

1386
01:23:15,614 --> 01:23:17,741
The worId seems to be
topsy turvy to you.

1387
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:20,078
Do whatever you want.

1388
01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:27,458
My dear. My beIoved. My darIing.

1389
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:31,060
Love me, madam. Satiate me.

1390
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,222
Eat ice cream.

1391
01:23:34,533 --> 01:23:37,502
The youth is crazy.
Let's pIay footbaII.

1392
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:39,294
Cut it.

1393
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:40,429
Cut it!!

1394
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:42,131
Don't you understand? Cut it.

1395
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,535
Son.

1396
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:46,171
Didn't the scene get dramatic?

1397
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:47,571
It was meIodrama.

1398
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,638
Have they gone mad to do this?

1399
01:23:50,616 --> 01:23:51,412
Sir..

1400
01:23:52,585 --> 01:23:55,383
..peopIe get mad under
infIuence of drug.

1401
01:23:56,455 --> 01:23:57,285
Drugs?

1402
01:23:57,656 --> 01:23:59,283
Now they take drugs too.

1403
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,222
I'm going to take drugs too.

1404
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:04,390
Amar. I've compIete confession.

1405
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:07,031
Confirmation.
- Yes, confirmation.

1406
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:09,158
Baig takes drugs whiIe
writing scenes.

1407
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:11,058
Whatever..

1408
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:13,564
I won't Iet it happen.

1409
01:24:14,306 --> 01:24:17,707
If there won't be drugs,
how wiII ThakraI enter?

1410
01:24:18,077 --> 01:24:19,339
ThakraI?

1411
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:21,102
Yes, ThakraI.
- Who is ThakraI?

1412
01:24:21,714 --> 01:24:24,342
In Mumbai he's the
biggest smuggIer..

1413
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:26,544
..of drugs and fake medicines.

1414
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:31,147
And Johnny Dcosta's arch rivaI.

1415
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,220
Johnny Dcosta?

1416
01:24:37,096 --> 01:24:39,189
How did one more character
get in my fiIm?

1417
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:53,643
Sweetie.

1418
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,248
Give me a fire, darIing.

1419
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:05,480
Johnny, don't be naughty.

1420
01:25:11,797 --> 01:25:14,527
He's editor of newspaper
for the worId.

1421
01:25:15,634 --> 01:25:18,728
But he dreams of getting
Thakra's chair.

1422
01:25:19,104 --> 01:25:21,595
Sir, you made Janardan
Dubey, Johnny Dcosta.

1423
01:25:22,141 --> 01:25:24,132
But he's an honest
man in my fiIm.

1424
01:25:24,276 --> 01:25:27,609
Honest man means smaII man.

1425
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:29,571
SmaII character.

1426
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:31,009
SmaII fiIm.

1427
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:33,518
Cut two. Dishonest man.

1428
01:25:33,819 --> 01:25:35,753
It means, big man.

1429
01:25:36,388 --> 01:25:37,412
Big character.

1430
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:41,283
Mr. Amar,
we're making a big fiIm.

1431
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,027
That's fine,
but the story is mine.

1432
01:25:45,364 --> 01:25:48,595
Brother,
I'm not Ieaving your story.

1433
01:25:49,401 --> 01:25:51,460
I'm onIy making minor
adjustments.

1434
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,095
Sir, what are you doing?

1435
01:25:53,172 --> 01:25:54,264
I'm spicing it up.

1436
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:56,398
Forgive me.

1437
01:25:56,475 --> 01:25:58,568
Spicing it up so that..

1438
01:25:59,712 --> 01:26:03,273
..it doesn't get bIand
on box-office.

1439
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:04,616
Yes.
- Got it?

1440
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:08,119
Baig, your presence has brought
gIamour in the fiIm.

1441
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,756
Yes, it wouId've been
better with stars.

1442
01:26:12,157 --> 01:26:14,717
Then caII some stars.
Who can stop you?

1443
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:23,230
Sir. Phone.

1444
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:28,399
Yes, Baig.
- Gaurav. - How did you caII me?

1445
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:30,575
Gaurav, I've written a
great roIe for you?

1446
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:31,803
When shouId I teII you?

1447
01:26:32,044 --> 01:26:34,171
I don't need to hear if you've
written the roIe.

1448
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:36,174
TeII me when to start
the shooting.

1449
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,449
Next week.

1450
01:26:37,616 --> 01:26:39,516
There is Mr. Kapoor's
shooting next week.

1451
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:45,751
Did Kapoor pay the money?

1452
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,752
He's making excuse for
2 weeks for money.

1453
01:26:47,993 --> 01:26:49,756
Excuses.
Then make excuse in giving dates.

1454
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:52,429
Mr. Baig is a jubiIee writer.

1455
01:26:53,465 --> 01:26:55,194
It's a big fiIm.
We'II get good money.

1456
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:57,259
Yes, sir.

1457
01:27:06,579 --> 01:27:07,978
HeIIo, star.

1458
01:27:08,213 --> 01:27:09,237
Hi, sweetheart.

1459
01:27:10,249 --> 01:27:11,614
I'm doing this fiIm onIy for you.

1460
01:27:11,984 --> 01:27:13,076
So sweet.

1461
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:14,679
Love you.
- Love you too.

1462
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:16,076
Bye.
- Bye.

1463
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:19,423
Wear tight cIothes.

1464
01:27:20,192 --> 01:27:22,752
What are you saying? ShouId I
wear tight cIothes.. - Mr. Baig.

1465
01:27:22,995 --> 01:27:26,021
See JuIiet with Romeo's eyes.

1466
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:27,325
What's happening, Mr. Baig?

1467
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,197
Romance.
- Romance.

1468
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:33,195
I'm taIking about my scene.

1469
01:27:36,275 --> 01:27:37,242
Look, Mr..

1470
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:39,238
..actuaIIy..

1471
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:40,669
..Renu..

1472
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,114
Who is Renu?
- No, sorry.

1473
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:44,406
Indu.
- Yes.

1474
01:27:44,483 --> 01:27:45,279
Indu.

1475
01:27:45,618 --> 01:27:49,452
There is a IittIe romance
between Indu and Iawyer.

1476
01:27:49,955 --> 01:27:52,048
But she was raped.

1477
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:55,592
That's why she needs a
support at this time.

1478
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:58,289
Now that eIderIy Iawyer
is giving her support.

1479
01:27:59,398 --> 01:28:02,196
Look, that 55 years oId man..

1480
01:28:02,334 --> 01:28:04,234
..himseIf needs support.

1481
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:08,966
Young peopIe needs young
person for support.

1482
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:10,165
But..
- Excuse me, Baig..

1483
01:28:10,442 --> 01:28:13,741
What's the difference if the
Iawyer is young or oId?

1484
01:28:15,514 --> 01:28:17,414
What?
- It makes a difference.

1485
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,648
It makes a difference.
- How?

1486
01:28:20,285 --> 01:28:23,345
Young Iawyer wiII fight
with vigour.

1487
01:28:24,423 --> 01:28:25,617
Anyway, what?

1488
01:28:25,991 --> 01:28:27,652
He's a Iawyer.
It makes no difference.

1489
01:28:27,726 --> 01:28:29,489
This and that..

1490
01:28:30,663 --> 01:28:33,655
If I say something,
you'II say it's onIy a fiIm.

1491
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:36,725
It's onIy a fiIm.

1492
01:28:37,302 --> 01:28:40,533
Oh.. I forgot, it's onIy a fiIm.

1493
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,008
Hey..
- Suri, shoot it the way he wants.

1494
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,637
Shoot what he wants.

1495
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:47,702
Gaurav Kapoor came in our fiIm.
- I think he can't do it.

1496
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:49,939
He forgot he's making a fiIm.

1497
01:28:54,586 --> 01:28:58,215
Let's waIk towards the moon.

1498
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:06,263
Let's waIk towards the moon.

1499
01:29:09,101 --> 01:29:12,366
Let's waIk towards the moon.

1500
01:29:15,474 --> 01:29:17,135
Come on..

1501
01:29:17,543 --> 01:29:20,011
Let's waIk towards the moon.

1502
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:21,303
When did he come?

1503
01:29:22,414 --> 01:29:23,506
In the Iast scene..

1504
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,607
..which baig wrote Iast night.

1505
01:29:27,753 --> 01:29:30,221
TeII our hero to stand
with breast out.

1506
01:29:30,355 --> 01:29:31,754
Not breast, but chest out.

1507
01:29:32,124 --> 01:29:33,785
Why do you ruin the EngIish?

1508
01:29:34,126 --> 01:29:34,683
Sorry.

1509
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,123
I didn't know you stay here.

1510
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:39,227
Me too.
- You too?

1511
01:29:39,531 --> 01:29:42,125
Yes.
OnIy Baig knows what happens here.

1512
01:29:42,267 --> 01:29:43,291
Pack up.

1513
01:29:43,368 --> 01:29:45,029
Today this scene wiII
be compIeted.

1514
01:29:45,104 --> 01:29:46,469
I came on someone eIse's set.

1515
01:29:46,538 --> 01:29:48,096
No, sir. It's our set.

1516
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:51,006
Look, Mr. Bag is sitting.

1517
01:29:51,076 --> 01:29:52,566
He's not Bag, but Baig.

1518
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:56,239
But where did the girIs
and modeIs come from?

1519
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:57,645
I don't know.

1520
01:29:58,117 --> 01:30:02,110
I'm a rocket with fire.
- And I'm a good rocket Iauncher.

1521
01:30:02,187 --> 01:30:03,586
I'II Iaunch you in my next movie.

1522
01:30:03,655 --> 01:30:05,213
Thank you, sir.
- What's aII this?

1523
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:06,482
Song is going on.

1524
01:30:07,493 --> 01:30:10,519
We had decided there won't be any
song in this fiIm. - Which fiIm?

1525
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:12,962
The fiIm that was sheIved even
before getting started.

1526
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:16,159
I'm not taIking about that fiIm.
- Look, now don't start it.

1527
01:30:16,535 --> 01:30:19,333
Look, sir.
We're making a new start.

1528
01:30:19,671 --> 01:30:22,504
Look, sir.
PIease don't do drama with me.

1529
01:30:23,075 --> 01:30:25,771
If you want to put a song,
say it cIearIy.

1530
01:30:26,145 --> 01:30:27,271
What nonsense is this!

1531
01:30:27,513 --> 01:30:28,673
Friend Amar.

1532
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,381
I'm making a commerciaI fiIm..

1533
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:33,244
..not art fiIm.

1534
01:30:33,318 --> 01:30:35,980
Sir, every producer says he's
making a commerciaI fiIm.

1535
01:30:36,054 --> 01:30:37,521
Every producer puts
song in the fiIm..

1536
01:30:37,589 --> 01:30:39,079
..but not every fiIm gets hit.

1537
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:42,723
Look, sir. Whether the fiIm
becomes hit or fIop..

1538
01:30:43,061 --> 01:30:45,086
..isn't in our hands but..

1539
01:30:45,297 --> 01:30:48,061
But sir, it's in director's
hands to make a good fiIm.

1540
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:50,497
So why are you forcing
a song in it?

1541
01:30:50,569 --> 01:30:53,060
Don't we need pubIicity
for a good fiIm.

1542
01:30:53,138 --> 01:30:55,129
Look, madam.
- Listen to me first.

1543
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:57,467
Who wiII do pubIicity,
music company.

1544
01:30:57,743 --> 01:31:00,075
Why wiII they do it if there
is no song in the fiIm?

1545
01:31:01,046 --> 01:31:03,947
Madam, no matter how good
the pubIicity is..

1546
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:06,049
..it can make a bad fiIm run.

1547
01:31:06,585 --> 01:31:09,315
But you'II make a good fiIm.

1548
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:12,386
And if good fiIm gets
good pubIicity..

1549
01:31:12,624 --> 01:31:15,115
..then what can be better?
- Very good.

1550
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:17,521
So Mr. Baig is writing the fiIm.

1551
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:20,027
I'm producing it.
You're directing it.

1552
01:31:20,098 --> 01:31:21,622
The fiIm wiII be good.
Right, Mr. Baig?

1553
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,991
What are you doing?
- What happened?

1554
01:31:24,169 --> 01:31:26,160
You've started puIIing
my Iegs too.

1555
01:31:26,405 --> 01:31:27,667
You make the fiIm.

1556
01:31:28,373 --> 01:31:31,399
I'm sorry, I scratched his
ear instead of mine.

1557
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:33,173
Amar.

1558
01:32:06,078 --> 01:32:09,172
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1559
01:32:09,781 --> 01:32:12,750
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1560
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:16,478
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1561
01:32:16,722 --> 01:32:21,250
Be it day or night..

1562
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:24,818
..I'm Iost in your thoughts.

1563
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:28,827
I swear by you.
O BeIoved. - Cut it.

1564
01:32:29,268 --> 01:32:30,132
Listen.

1565
01:32:31,236 --> 01:32:32,328
Take me out.

1566
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:34,295
Come, I never said no.

1567
01:32:34,473 --> 01:32:36,566
OnIy two of us. Let's go out too.

1568
01:32:36,642 --> 01:32:37,700
Then caII Monty.

1569
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:39,508
Promise?

1570
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:41,204
Monty, come here.

1571
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:42,671
Yes, madam.

1572
01:32:42,981 --> 01:32:45,415
Listen. WiII you shoot entire
song on one set?

1573
01:32:45,684 --> 01:32:48,551
The song is screaming..

1574
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:50,613
..to take it abroad.
- Yes.

1575
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:52,747
Who has stopped us?

1576
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:56,290
We'II go to New ZeaIand, HoIIand,
PoIand, wherever you say.

1577
01:32:57,729 --> 01:33:01,096
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1578
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,167
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1579
01:33:05,504 --> 01:33:08,598
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1580
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:13,304
Now I want to Iive and
die in your arms.

1581
01:33:13,478 --> 01:33:17,073
I was to cross every
Iimits for you.

1582
01:33:17,149 --> 01:33:22,678
This Iove won't dwindIe.
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1583
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:26,820
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1584
01:33:27,626 --> 01:33:30,493
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1585
01:33:39,271 --> 01:33:42,536
Under the roof of cIoud..

1586
01:33:42,774 --> 01:33:46,107
..I weave beautifuI dreams.

1587
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:50,275
My Iove is for you.

1588
01:33:54,086 --> 01:34:00,719
In siIence,
I hear your heartbeat.

1589
01:34:01,393 --> 01:34:05,056
My Iove is onIy for you.

1590
01:34:05,197 --> 01:34:08,530
Your charm, your gaze..

1591
01:34:08,734 --> 01:34:12,067
Your charm,
your gaze entice me.

1592
01:34:12,137 --> 01:34:15,163
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1593
01:34:15,607 --> 01:34:18,599
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1594
01:34:19,311 --> 01:34:22,303
BeIoved. BeIoved.

1595
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:26,213
Amar.

1596
01:34:27,152 --> 01:34:27,777
Amar.

1597
01:34:30,655 --> 01:34:32,282
Why don't you speak? Amar.

1598
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:37,255
Hey.
Why aren't you getting ready?

1599
01:34:37,329 --> 01:34:38,956
Don't you want to
go for shooting?

1600
01:34:42,134 --> 01:34:43,158
No, friend.

1601
01:34:44,069 --> 01:34:45,536
Enough of this shooting.

1602
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:53,043
Amar. Friend.

1603
01:34:54,446 --> 01:34:55,708
What happened now?

1604
01:34:59,051 --> 01:35:00,609
OId Iawyer became young.

1605
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:02,643
Indu feII in Iove
with the Iawyer.

1606
01:35:03,055 --> 01:35:05,046
Song.. now Indu's famiIy.

1607
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,486
She's not from an orphanage.
She'II have a famiIy.

1608
01:35:10,495 --> 01:35:14,124
Maybe you don't know what famiIy
Mr. Baig made for Indu.

1609
01:35:14,266 --> 01:35:18,293
This is a story of famiIy.

1610
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:22,740
This is a story of famiIy.

1611
01:35:23,475 --> 01:35:28,105
It has king and queen.
Mother and son.

1612
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,239
Papa and daughter too.

1613
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:34,146
This is my story.

1614
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:38,979
This famiIy is crazy.

1615
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:44,088
There is a boy and a girI too.

1616
01:35:44,162 --> 01:35:47,962
This is a story of famiIy.

1617
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:52,693
This is a story of famiIy.

1618
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:56,966
This is a story of famiIy.

1619
01:35:58,677 --> 01:36:01,703
What happened?
- Was it a famiIy or a coIony?

1620
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,748
Just think,
how can I make the fiIm?

1621
01:36:04,282 --> 01:36:08,742
Look, I accept Mr. Ba has
ruined this fiIm famiIy.

1622
01:36:09,187 --> 01:36:12,452
But think of your famiIy
and career.

1623
01:36:12,757 --> 01:36:15,021
The fiIm is about to get
finished. Just handIe it.

1624
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,091
PIease, handIe it.

1625
01:36:17,696 --> 01:36:18,594
Not me..

1626
01:36:19,564 --> 01:36:21,293
..but even God can
save this famiIy.

1627
01:36:22,434 --> 01:36:25,562
'Let's watch which new idea
did Mr. Baig think..

1628
01:36:25,637 --> 01:36:28,367
..of save Indu Verma
from being raped.'

1629
01:36:28,473 --> 01:36:31,306
But sir, my entire fiIm is based
on Indu Verma's rape.

1630
01:36:32,177 --> 01:36:35,146
But you've discussed
and decided..

1631
01:36:35,447 --> 01:36:37,005
..that Indu Verma won't be raped.

1632
01:36:37,048 --> 01:36:38,015
What the heII!

1633
01:36:38,717 --> 01:36:39,547
Son..

1634
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,654
..now your fiIm is a famiIy fiIm.

1635
01:36:43,989 --> 01:36:47,015
Did I teII you to put hero,
romance and song?

1636
01:36:47,192 --> 01:36:48,181
Just a minute.

1637
01:36:48,426 --> 01:36:50,485
You went to watch the fiIm with
your mother and sister.

1638
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:53,155
If a girI is raped in the fiIm..

1639
01:36:53,465 --> 01:36:55,626
..wiII you be abIe to
watch this with them?

1640
01:36:55,967 --> 01:36:57,025
WiII you Iike it?

1641
01:36:58,103 --> 01:37:00,435
Sir, are you with her or me?

1642
01:37:00,705 --> 01:37:04,141
I'm the fiIm's producer.

1643
01:37:04,276 --> 01:37:06,039
And this is my famiIy.

1644
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:08,272
I've to take care of
my famiIy member.

1645
01:37:08,346 --> 01:37:10,109
We aII are together.
Right, Mr. Baig?

1646
01:37:10,415 --> 01:37:12,576
But sir, I'm not with you.
- Amar.

1647
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:15,017
Amar. - Make your own fiIm.
- Amar.

1648
01:37:16,388 --> 01:37:17,616
Amar.

1649
01:37:18,256 --> 01:37:20,747
Why shouIdn't have got up from
there? - What couId I do?

1650
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,389
There are 10 more directors
besides me.

1651
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:25,789
Everyone knows what's going to
happen in my fiIm except me.

1652
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:28,727
So you.. - Sir, what wiII
happen after this scene?

1653
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,569
FiIm wiII be fIopped
after this scene.

1654
01:37:31,636 --> 01:37:33,331
Get going. We're coming.

1655
01:37:34,506 --> 01:37:37,100
Look, Amar. - Sir, where to put
the camera for the next shot?

1656
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:39,400
Find a cIean pIace
to put the camera.

1657
01:37:39,477 --> 01:37:41,570
Keep going. We're coming.
- Leave.

1658
01:37:41,713 --> 01:37:43,681
Ask that baig.
- Now don't send anyone.

1659
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:48,947
Amar, my brother.

1660
01:37:49,654 --> 01:37:53,181
Look, Mummy and baig
won't come and say..

1661
01:37:53,358 --> 01:37:55,087
..Amar, you can do what you want.

1662
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,025
It's impossibIe.
- So what shouId I do?

1663
01:37:57,162 --> 01:37:59,960
Try to save the fiIm
as much as you can.

1664
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:01,998
But make the fiIm.

1665
01:38:02,133 --> 01:38:05,227
If you Ieave the fiIm,
it makes no difference to others.

1666
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:08,372
They'II make someone eIse
compIete the fiIm. - Let them.

1667
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,965
Nobody wiII know you
Ieft the fiIm.

1668
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:12,066
Producer wiII say..

1669
01:38:12,143 --> 01:38:14,008
..Amar was fired as he
doesn't know the job.

1670
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:16,773
Your career wiII end even
before starting.

1671
01:38:17,749 --> 01:38:20,650
Are you trying to scare me?
- No.

1672
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,347
I'm trying to save
you and your fiIm.

1673
01:38:23,455 --> 01:38:26,253
The way Mr. Baig is trying
to save Indu from rape.

1674
01:38:27,692 --> 01:38:29,091
How shouId I expIain?

1675
01:38:32,264 --> 01:38:34,289
Listen to me.
- No, it's correct.

1676
01:38:34,366 --> 01:38:35,993
Amar, Iisten to Monty.

1677
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:37,728
FiIm isn't getting made
the way you want.

1678
01:38:38,103 --> 01:38:40,469
But he's accountabIe to the
financiers of the fiIm. - Yes.

1679
01:38:40,605 --> 01:38:42,664
After aII he's a answering
machine to the financier.

1680
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:44,167
Correct.
- What correct?

1681
01:38:44,342 --> 01:38:46,105
No, you don't say anything.
I understood.

1682
01:38:46,311 --> 01:38:47,938
Monty, Amar is saying..

1683
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:50,511
..wiII your fiIm become hit by
doing aII this? - Correct.

1684
01:38:51,216 --> 01:38:53,514
And the way Monty is thinking..

1685
01:38:53,585 --> 01:38:56,247
Just a minute. I'm taIking.
- You speak. - Just a minute.

1686
01:38:56,721 --> 01:38:58,120
TeII me, Amar.

1687
01:38:58,423 --> 01:39:01,256
When you started the fiIm,
it was 10 days scheduIe.

1688
01:39:01,726 --> 01:39:04,092
Did I stop you even once?
- No.

1689
01:39:04,663 --> 01:39:07,223
Why do you need to stop me now?
- I'm not.

1690
01:39:07,299 --> 01:39:10,427
Monty isn't stopping, Mr. Baig is.
- What do I do?

1691
01:39:10,502 --> 01:39:11,992
You compIete my fiIm.

1692
01:39:12,103 --> 01:39:14,970
Hey.. - Why do you need me if you
want to make such a fiIm?

1693
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,667
Monty is saying..
- Quiet.

1694
01:39:17,309 --> 01:39:18,333
I'm taIking.

1695
01:39:19,177 --> 01:39:21,008
Everyone needs everyone here.

1696
01:39:21,713 --> 01:39:24,409
But Amar,
the angIe of need has changed.

1697
01:39:24,983 --> 01:39:27,383
You needed me to start the fiIm.

1698
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:29,276
Today my fiIm is haIf compIete.

1699
01:39:29,454 --> 01:39:31,547

01:39:31,656 --> 01:39:32,680

1701

Yes, it's impotent

1702
01:39:36,027 --> 01:39:38,222
Not impotent but important.
- Yes.

1703
01:39:38,396 --> 01:39:40,694
You both need each other.

1704
01:39:40,965 --> 01:39:42,694
PubIic needs a good fiIm.

1705
01:39:42,967 --> 01:39:44,696
ShouId I make a pack for you?
I need it.

1706
01:39:44,936 --> 01:39:45,994
It's your work.

1707
01:39:46,538 --> 01:39:48,506
You drink for free everyday.
Make one for me.

1708
01:40:14,532 --> 01:40:16,466
You're fair and I'm dark.

1709
01:40:16,668 --> 01:40:18,966
We'II make a hot coupIe.

1710
01:40:33,718 --> 01:40:35,777
I'II save her from you, but..

1711
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:38,979

..you've aII the songs

1715
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:32,274
I don't know.
Write an action sequence for me.

1716
01:41:33,011 --> 01:41:34,205
I want to fight too.

1717
01:41:35,013 --> 01:41:36,037
With whom?

1718
01:41:36,714 --> 01:41:38,045
With whom?

1719
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:55,657
I don't know.

1720
01:41:56,634 --> 01:42:00,126
But if romantic hero

1721
01:42:01,806 --> 01:42:03,171
..then I'II romance too.

1722
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:04,599
How?

1723
01:42:04,676 --> 01:42:05,802

1724
01:42:06,144 --> 01:42:08,578
Wow! It's great, sir.

01:42:15,653 --> 01:42:16,711
No chance, sir.

1729

Cigarette smoking is banned.
- Right.

1730
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,058
But toiIet going isn't banned,

1731
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:22,649
No.
It's on Ieft hand side. Go there.

Don't go by Iength.
Go by emotion, sir.

Now the rest of the song wiII

1741
01:43:07,238 --> 01:43:08,136
How?

1742

Don't Iet him escape.

Shoot!

1779
01:46:38,316 --> 01:46:40,147
You were fIuttering too much.

You want to fIy.

Shoot him.

Great! It was fun.

1791
01:47:20,992 --> 01:47:22,016
What fun?

1792
01:47:22,527 --> 01:47:23,653
He took the heroine.

1793
01:47:24,028 --> 01:47:25,552
But you'II get the credit
for the fiIm.

1794
01:47:27,165 --> 01:47:27,722
How?

1795
01:47:28,766 --> 01:47:29,755

Amar. My audience went weII.

1808
01:47:58,963 --> 01:48:00,760
There wiII be 3 queues

1809
01:48:01,265 --> 01:48:05,463
One of producer. One of girIs and
one of income-tax peopIe. - Yeah.

1810
01:48:05,536 --> 01:48:08,198
CongratuIate your friend.
He compIeted the fiIm on time.

1811
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:10,268
Sir, constipation.

1812
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:13,074

If you've constipation,

You'II get reIief in 10 minutes.

1815
01:48:17,348 --> 01:48:19,339
Sir, not his stomach, but
his EngIish is bad.

Mr. Amar.

1819
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,423
Your fiIm is being the taIk
of the entire industry.

1820
01:48:30,094 --> 01:48:32,392
Don't forget me after the
fiIm becomes a hit.

1821
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:34,597
How can I forget you, sir?

1822
01:48:35,466 --> 01:48:36,990
Whenever I'II watch the fiIm..

1823
01:48:37,568 --> 01:48:38,967
..I'II think of you.

1824
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:42,336
Mr. Amar,
you seem to be a bit angry.

1825
01:48:43,174 --> 01:48:44,198
Right, Monty?

1826
01:48:44,275 --> 01:48:47,608
Mr. Ba,
he doesn't know what he has made.

1827
01:48:48,246 --> 01:48:49,645
Sorry. I'm puIIing your ears.

1828
01:48:49,747 --> 01:48:51,510
He doesn't know what he has made.

1829
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:55,146
When I'II show him the theatricaI
promo of his own fiIm..

1830
01:48:55,253 --> 01:48:56,948
..he'II understand everything.

1831
01:49:00,124 --> 01:49:02,649
Monty Chaddha Present.

1832
01:49:17,742 --> 01:49:25,239
You have kindIed the
passion of Iove.

1833
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:33,451
The enemies of Iove
are chasing.

1834
01:49:33,524 --> 01:49:36,982
Come on.

1835
01:49:37,094 --> 01:49:38,356
Come on.

1836
01:49:40,398 --> 01:49:44,334
Amar Joshi!
- Down! Down!

1837
01:49:44,435 --> 01:49:46,369
Amar Joshi!
- Down! Down!

1838
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:48,495
Amar Joshi!
- Down! Down!

1839
01:49:48,572 --> 01:49:50,733
Amar Joshi!
- Down! Down!

1840
01:49:52,009 --> 01:49:53,135
Sister, remember..

1841
01:49:53,277 --> 01:49:54,710
..it's our responsibiIity
to take..

1842
01:49:54,946 --> 01:49:56,345
..revenge of Indu Verma's insuIt.

1843
01:49:56,447 --> 01:49:57,573
She's not aIone.

1844
01:49:57,949 --> 01:49:59,280
We'II teach that scum a Iesson.

1845
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:00,442
Very good.

1846
01:50:01,052 --> 01:50:02,952
Sir, mind bIow job.

1847
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:05,011
Not mind bIow job,
but mind bIowing job.

1848
01:50:05,456 --> 01:50:07,287
Hey..
- Not traffic, but terrific.

1849
01:50:07,425 --> 01:50:09,120
Promo is better than the fiIm.

1850
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,421
This is caIIed marketing.

1851
01:50:11,662 --> 01:50:14,153
If you put it before the fiIm,
fiIm becomes super duper hit.

1852
01:50:14,365 --> 01:50:17,732
And Amar, it wiII be my tribute
to Guru Dutt's 'Pyaasa'.

1853
01:50:18,302 --> 01:50:19,200
Why not Don?

1854
01:50:19,403 --> 01:50:21,064
Don is aIready remade.
- Yes.

1855
01:50:21,339 --> 01:50:24,103
Every big fiIm maker
is making remake..

1856
01:50:24,175 --> 01:50:26,234
..of oId fiIms and mocking it.

1857
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:27,641
This is going on these days.

1858
01:50:28,312 --> 01:50:29,540
I don't know what's going on..

1859
01:50:29,613 --> 01:50:31,274
..but our fiIm won't
Iast for 4 shows.

1860
01:50:31,349 --> 01:50:33,613
What is he saying?
- No, sir..

1861
01:50:33,751 --> 01:50:35,480
Sir, he means..
- Did I caII him for this?

1862
01:50:35,553 --> 01:50:38,249
He says it's a smaII fiIm,
so not 4 shows..

1863
01:50:38,322 --> 01:50:40,153
..but 6 shows wiII be screened
in a day. - ReaIIy?

1864
01:50:40,224 --> 01:50:42,385
You don't understand.
- Then it's fine.

1865
01:50:42,626 --> 01:50:44,457
Amar, just watch where this
fiIm wiII take you.

1866
01:50:45,129 --> 01:50:46,926
That's Amar Joshi. Come on.

1867
01:50:46,998 --> 01:50:49,398
Hit him!
Come on! He shouIdn't escape.

1868
01:50:49,467 --> 01:50:51,958
Come on! Hit him.

1869
01:50:57,575 --> 01:51:01,136
Sister!
Sister! What are you doing?

1870
01:51:01,712 --> 01:51:02,736
Sister.

1871
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,412
What are you doing?

1872
01:51:18,262 --> 01:51:21,322
Where are we stuck?

1873
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:31,669
Because of your reaI story where
did you get me trapped?

1874
01:51:35,713 --> 01:51:38,045
Friend. I..

1875
01:51:38,382 --> 01:51:40,646
I toId you not to Ieave Mr. Baig.

1876
01:51:40,718 --> 01:51:43,278
I toId you to keep
hoId of the story.

1877
01:51:43,687 --> 01:51:46,349
I didn't know poIice
wiII hoId us.

1878
01:51:48,692 --> 01:51:51,286
Look, the women thrashed
us bIack and bIue.

1879
01:51:51,662 --> 01:51:53,687
Hey,
wiII the poIice thrash us too?

1880
01:51:54,298 --> 01:51:55,788
I'm very sacred.

1881
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:00,564
I'II sit there.

1882
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:05,140
Brother, I wonder what twist
he brought in the story.

1883
01:52:06,243 --> 01:52:08,234
Oh friend.. this isn't justice.

1884
01:52:08,579 --> 01:52:11,070
ReIease us.

1885
01:52:11,582 --> 01:52:14,278
You take the story
and make the fiIm.

1886
01:52:14,685 --> 01:52:16,243
HeIIo. Mr. Baig.

1887
01:52:16,787 --> 01:52:17,811
Mr. Baig.

1888
01:52:18,055 --> 01:52:20,114
What happened, Monty?
Did you see a ghost?

1889
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:23,385
I'm ruined. I'm bankrupt.

1890
01:52:23,594 --> 01:52:24,652
What happened?

1891
01:52:24,762 --> 01:52:27,094
When Amar,
Suraj and I were coming..

1892
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:29,098
..down the stairs of theatre..

1893
01:52:29,233 --> 01:52:31,064
..we saw a group of
women approaching.

1894
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:32,567
Those women were very hot.

1895
01:52:32,636 --> 01:52:34,729
No, I mean they were very angry.

1896
01:52:34,805 --> 01:52:36,705
First they sIapped.
Then hit with sIippers..

1897
01:52:36,774 --> 01:52:38,139
Then with sandaIs.

1898
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:40,040
Then they hit us with anything
that came in their hand.

1899
01:52:40,111 --> 01:52:42,272
I escaped when I got a chance.
You know I'm very smart..

1900
01:52:42,346 --> 01:52:43,643
..in such matters. I escape.

1901
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:46,575
But poor Amar got trapped.
PoIice arrested him.

1902
01:52:46,717 --> 01:52:48,708
It's good. Look..

1903
01:52:49,186 --> 01:52:51,154
..fiIm wiII get free pubIicity.
- What?

1904
01:52:52,389 --> 01:52:54,289
It wiII get free pubIicity.

1905
01:52:54,658 --> 01:52:56,523
Let the director be
behind the bars.

1906
01:52:56,594 --> 01:52:59,119
When the fiIm is reIeased,
get him reIeased too.

1907
01:52:59,430 --> 01:53:00,795
Both wiII be reIeased at once.

1908
01:53:01,232 --> 01:53:02,631
Impact wiII be great.

1909
01:53:05,202 --> 01:53:08,501
Monty, you're very Iucky.
This is good news.

1910
01:53:09,306 --> 01:53:12,366
More the controversy, more the
curiosity among the pubIic.

1911
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:14,101
Wow.

1912
01:53:14,278 --> 01:53:15,370
That's good news.

1913
01:53:16,147 --> 01:53:19,082
Monty, more the curiosity..

1914
01:53:19,283 --> 01:53:20,580
..more pubIic wiII come.

1915
01:53:20,751 --> 01:53:21,809
It's good.

1916
01:53:24,555 --> 01:53:26,386
You've made a nice setting.

1917
01:53:26,724 --> 01:53:29,022
Indu Verma wiII agree
for a smaII amount.

1918
01:53:29,193 --> 01:53:32,162
And by then,
even the pubIic wiII know it.

1919
01:53:33,197 --> 01:53:34,323
Oh my God.

1920
01:53:34,698 --> 01:53:35,722
Oh my God.

1921
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:37,700
I didn't think about it.

1922
01:53:40,004 --> 01:53:42,302
First time director
behind the bars.

1923
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:46,168
First time director Amar Joshi.
And Indu Verma..

1924
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,242
Yes.

1925
01:53:50,748 --> 01:53:51,680
God.

1926
01:53:51,749 --> 01:53:52,773
3,00,000 rupees?

1927
01:53:54,385 --> 01:53:56,615
You're bargaining as if you
want to buy vegetabIes.

1928
01:53:57,087 --> 01:53:59,146
Forgive me, madam.
3,00,000 rupees are enough.

1929
01:53:59,223 --> 01:54:01,020
I can buy entire market for it.

1930
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:02,516
And uItimateIy..

1931
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,625
..we both are doing business.

1932
01:54:04,762 --> 01:54:06,992
How dare you?
What are you trying to say?

1933
01:54:07,064 --> 01:54:10,227
No, no. You didn't understand.

1934
01:54:10,301 --> 01:54:12,769
I didn't mean that.
You're getting me wrong.

1935
01:54:13,137 --> 01:54:15,037
We both are doing business
uItimateIy.

1936
01:54:15,172 --> 01:54:16,730
Business?
- You teII me..

1937
01:54:16,807 --> 01:54:19,503
..what wiII I take from 3,00,000
and what wiII Indu get?

1938
01:54:19,743 --> 01:54:22,473
Indu wiII get justice and
Iots of pubIicity.

1939
01:54:22,613 --> 01:54:24,012
She got justice.

1940
01:54:24,148 --> 01:54:26,207
And pubIicity can't
fiII your stomach.

1941
01:54:26,283 --> 01:54:28,148
Then send her to me.
I'II fiII her stomach.

1942
01:54:29,053 --> 01:54:31,578
I'II give her 3,50,000 rupees.
Not a penny more.

1943
01:54:31,655 --> 01:54:34,180
Either take it or Ieave it.
It's your wish.

1944
01:54:35,025 --> 01:54:37,425
Monty,
what kind of an offer is this?

1945
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:39,959
You've made such a big house.

1946
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:43,428
Come on.
Increase it a IittIe more.

1947
01:54:44,101 --> 01:54:45,261
A IittIe more.

1948
01:54:47,104 --> 01:54:49,231
Madam, now I won't increase.

1949
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:51,667
But I'II come forward.

1950
01:54:53,244 --> 01:54:57,510
I'II give you a roIe
in my next fiIm.

1951
01:54:58,449 --> 01:54:59,143
Me?

1952
01:55:01,151 --> 01:55:02,516
You don't beIieve me?

1953
01:55:03,153 --> 01:55:07,590
TeII me, when did you Iast
see your face in mirror?

1954
01:55:08,425 --> 01:55:09,517
This morning.

1955
01:55:09,693 --> 01:55:11,354
I'm Prakash Chapekar
from Zee News.

1956
01:55:11,428 --> 01:55:13,760
Tomorrow director Amar Joshi's
fiIm is going to be reIeased.

1957
01:55:13,998 --> 01:55:15,488
Today he's getting reIeased
from jaiI.

1958
01:55:15,566 --> 01:55:18,501
Let's find out what impact this
controversy wiII have on his fiIm.

1959
01:55:18,569 --> 01:55:20,332
Did Indu Verma watch your fiIm,
Mr. Amar?

1960
01:55:20,404 --> 01:55:22,133
She saw the fiIm and
she Iiked it.

1961
01:55:22,573 --> 01:55:24,302
Mr. Amar,
do you want to say something?

1962
01:55:25,175 --> 01:55:26,642
I said no comment.
- Sir, teII me..

1963
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:28,541
..why is your fiIm
so controversiaI?

1964
01:55:28,612 --> 01:55:30,546
First Sudama BhosaIe,
now Indu Verma..

1965
01:55:30,781 --> 01:55:34,148
Ups and downs are part of Iife.

1966
01:55:34,285 --> 01:55:36,776
Was his going to jaiI
a pubIicity stunt?

1967
01:55:37,154 --> 01:55:39,622
What are you saying?
Is this the way to taIk?

1968
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:43,016
TeII me, does a director go
to jaiI for pubIicity?

1969
01:55:43,093 --> 01:55:45,186
I don't Iike this nonsense.
- Leave it.

1970
01:55:45,262 --> 01:55:47,526
I won't Ieave it. He's wrong.
- It wiII come off.

1971
01:55:47,598 --> 01:55:49,031
He can't do anything, I'II..

1972
01:55:49,099 --> 01:55:51,033
Move your hand or your
ear wiII come off.

1973
01:55:52,236 --> 01:55:53,965
Amar, your fiIm is going
to be reIeased tomorrow.

1974
01:55:54,038 --> 01:55:55,972
Do you want to say anything
about the fiIm?

1975
01:55:56,507 --> 01:55:58,407
What can I say?
FiIm wiII be reIeased tomorrow.

1976
01:55:58,742 --> 01:56:00,607
PubIic wiII say whatever
they've to.

1977
01:56:00,778 --> 01:56:03,474
It's a hit. Super duper hit.
- Take my interview too.

1978
01:56:04,281 --> 01:56:06,044
Come home and take the cheque.

1979
01:56:08,452 --> 01:56:10,147
Amar Joshi's taIked
about fiIm Scream..

1980
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,211
..which was into controversy
from the start..

1981
01:56:12,289 --> 01:56:14,382
..has reached the
audience at Iast.

1982
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:16,422
Let's see if the audience Iiked..

1983
01:56:16,493 --> 01:56:18,290
..the new director's fiIm or not.

1984
01:56:18,662 --> 01:56:19,788
How you Iike the fiIm?

1985
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:21,156
FiIm is very good.

1986
01:56:21,332 --> 01:56:23,459
Amar Joshi has made a good fiIm.
- Superb. Mind bIowing.

1987
01:56:23,634 --> 01:56:26,398
It's nice. He tried to make
something different.

1988
01:56:27,538 --> 01:56:28,596
And you?

1989
01:56:28,706 --> 01:56:31,300
Direction and choreography is
good. FiIm is very nice.

1990
01:56:31,575 --> 01:56:33,065
Super hit.

1991
01:56:35,612 --> 01:56:37,739
Gaurav is so cute.
I Ioved him in the movie.

1992
01:56:40,751 --> 01:56:42,719
It's very good.
- Superb. - Nice songs.

1993
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:52,060
I don't know what to say
on such occasion but..

1994
01:56:52,996 --> 01:56:55,089
..at the moment Iike this
aII I can say is..

1995
01:56:56,066 --> 01:56:57,431
..thank you very much for this.

1996
01:56:57,534 --> 01:56:58,728
The jury..

1997
01:56:59,603 --> 01:57:01,298
..and of course the audience.

1998
01:57:03,006 --> 01:57:04,667
Sir. This story is..

1999
01:57:05,142 --> 01:57:07,474
..of a smaII schooI in
a smaII viIIage..

2000
01:57:08,412 --> 01:57:10,175
..where smaII kids..

2001
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:12,676
..come to study.
- No, no.

2002
01:57:14,017 --> 01:57:15,382
SmaII schooI..

2003
01:57:16,053 --> 01:57:17,987
..smaII kids, smaII viIIage..

2004
01:57:18,722 --> 01:57:20,417
Everything shouId be big.

2005
01:57:20,591 --> 01:57:21,990
Everything shouId be big.

2006
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:23,751
Turn schooI into coIIege.

2007
01:57:24,061 --> 01:57:26,427
Cambridge, Boston.
You know, make it an university.

2008
01:57:26,663 --> 01:57:28,528
And take the fiIm abroad.

2009
01:57:28,732 --> 01:57:30,597
Sir, these are schooI students..

2010
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:32,498
Not schooI..
- Sorry, sir.

2011
01:57:33,137 --> 01:57:36,402
CoIIege students go
to Agra on a trip.

2012
01:57:36,707 --> 01:57:40,404
Not Agra, but America.
Turn Jaipur into Japan.

2013
01:57:40,644 --> 01:57:42,475
Take the fiIm out. Make it big.

2014
01:57:42,546 --> 01:57:45,310
We won't make art fiIm but
commerciaI fiIm. Okay?

2015
01:57:45,516 --> 01:57:49,111
Sir, what wiII the kids do there?

2016
01:57:49,186 --> 01:57:50,653
Romance. Outdoor romance.

2017
01:57:51,155 --> 01:57:53,020
If there is romance,
there wiII be songs.

2018
01:57:53,157 --> 01:57:55,557
ThriII, action. Drugs.

2019
01:57:56,693 --> 01:57:58,320
Heavy excitement.

2020
01:57:58,695 --> 01:58:00,720
Get out. Let's make a big fiIm.

2021
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:03,158
Think again. Think something big.

2022
01:58:03,233 --> 01:58:05,463
I mean,
