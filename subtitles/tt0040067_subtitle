3
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,516
This Kanhaiya is a
strange one in our house.

4
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:48,114
See the pile of clothes on
my bed as if there is no other place

5
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:57,394
Oh, the bundle has started moving.
Oh, It is you there!

6
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:02,314
Sudha, what a lovely name.

7
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,634
You know the meaning of Sudha.
It is nectar.

8
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:16,434
And you are the lady of nectar.
Nectar shouldn't be kept covered

9
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,474
It should be admired by the eyes.

10
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,994
It appears,
you do not like electric light.

11
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:35,634
Somebody has said, Light is not
good for such occasions.

12
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,834
In the hour of happiness, where
is the place for anything that burns.

13
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:46,354
This is funny, the more I
want to come close...

14
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:48,914
the length of
your veil increases.

15
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:55,874
I have also sworn,
either I stay or this veil.

16
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,394
In the end,
what I dreaded has happened.

17
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:36,394
That what I didn't want to happen,
has happened.

18
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:42,514
Why does a person want
to live in a world of dreams.

19
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:49,354
And what is the reality of
these dreams. Like drops of water.

20
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:53,114
Which on slightest hindrance,
break into droplets.

21
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,594
Wasn't it a dream that
a beautiful girl like you...

22
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:02,474
would be able to stay with
a ugly man like me and be happy.

23
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:11,794
I had told my father,
& your mother, but they ignored me.

24
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,764
They said,
character is greater than a face.

25
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:24,714
But what is my character?
It reflects the ugliness of my face.

26
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:31,274
But I was not ugly like
this from the beginning.

27
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:35,474
Looking at me,
people did not scream.

28
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:41,554
Alas. If I was ugly
from the beginning...

29
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,594
What has happened today
wouldn't have happened.

30
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,789
If it hadn't happened,
it would have been so good.

31
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:00,109
Alas, if you hadn't been so
beautiful. Alas, if I hadn't been...

32
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,229
so handsome as I was. Alas,
if I hadn't been so attracted...

33
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:13,469
to beautiful girls as I was.
Alas, if I hadn't been so fond...

34
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:23,029
of dramatics as I was.
When I was ten years old...

35
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:32,149
What is this, mother?

36
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,069
No evil eye should
be cast on my dear son.

37
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,349
Are you listening!

38
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,989
If you could press this tie.

39
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,029
I will just do it.
Let Kewal go first to school.

40
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,149
So that Kewal can go to school!

41
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,269
As if my going to
court is not important.

42
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,589
Look son, go straight to school.
And when the school closes...

43
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:05,709
come straight home.
Don't stop anywhere, don't halt...

44
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,749
don't even talk to anybody.

45
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:13,309
Good boys go straight to school,
come straight home.

46
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:17,189
- Got it?
- OK, but my money!

47
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,469
Listen once again. Go straight
to school, come straight home.

48
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:34,029
Don't stop anywhere, don't halt
anywhere, & don't talk to anyone.

49
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:42,429
Don't stop anywhere.
And don't talk to anyone.

50
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:50,949
Don't halt anywhere, don't
wait anywhere, don't talk to anyone.

51
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:55,349
Wait, I am also coming to school

52
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:29,669
Gentlemen.. Gentlemen...
Tonight, at 10 O'clock...

53
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,789
Mangaldas Market, New Edward
Theatrical Company will hold...

54
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:37,709
the famous drama Bilwa Mangal
in which India's famous actor...

55
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:45,909
Master Shankar & Zarina work.
Today's is the last show.

56
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:55,309
Tickets are only 10, 5 & 2 Rs.
1 and 8 Annas. Only 8 Annas.

57
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,149
Only 8 Annas. Come Gentlemen.

58
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,909
- Give me one.
- No, not for kids.

59
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,349
- And me?
- Yes, its different with you.

60
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:26,389
When Alexander attacked India,
Taxila's King Amthi &...

61
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:32,749
Trans Jhelum King
were fighting with each other.

62
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,549
If the war was not there..

63
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,469
The Greeks would not have
come like a storm into India.

64
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,029
Our country wouldn't have
accepted defeat so easily.

65
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,549
These household fights have...

66
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,269
made us slaves not
once but several times.

67
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:55,109
And that is why we have
the fetters of primitivity on us.

68
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:02,309
When for the first time the Greek
armies came in front of Indian army...

69
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:08,349
their steps hesitated.
Indian Braves fought so bravely...

70
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,749
that the enemy was left trembling.

71
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,869
If at that time Alexandra didn't think
of a brilliant move, Greeks had lost.

72
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:26,069
He thought that at night
when the Indian Army was sleeping...

73
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:34,629
pounce on them.
There would be chaos. That night...

74
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:38,709
Tonight at 10 O clock,
in Mangaldas Park, the famous play

75
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:47,071
of Edward Company,
Bilwa Mangal, new play, new stage,

76
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:55,151
new dances, new songs.
Tickets only at 5, 2, 1 Rs & 8 annas

77
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:01,869
Remember Gentlemen, this
is the last play in this city...

78
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,029
Bilwa Mangal, Bilwa Mangal.
Only at 8 annas.

79
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,989
- Kewal.
- Yes Master.

80
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,309
- Repeat what I said.
- Sir?

81
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,149
Didn't you hear what I said?
Repeat what I said.

82
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:30,989
You were saying, Mangaldas Park,
Bilwa Mangal tonight at..

83
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,229
10 O'clock.
New dances, new songs, new scenery...

84
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,309
Tickets at only 8 annas.

85
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:40,509
Quiet!

86
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:55,389
I was saying Mangaldas Park,
Bilwa Mangal at 10 O'clock tonight.

87
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,189
I will show you.
I will show you the complete play.

88
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,149
Oh, I forgot the book.

89
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:17,509
- Will you sit here only?
- Let me fix this button.

90
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:22,309
Ok, come. Leave it.

91
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,389
Please leave it.

92
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:29,509
Let us go.

93
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:38,709
I heard there is a new
theatre company in the city.

94
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,069
Theater?

95
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:44,029
It is a devil's workshop.
It is not for decent folk.

96
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:57,349
- What is Kewal doing?
- He must be sleeping.

97
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,509
But why with lights?

98
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,869
He has your habits.
He is your son only.

99
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,116
Kewal! Kewal!

100
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,469
- He is sleeping.
- Sleeping! But he said...

101
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:34,589
But Nimmi. Is this the time?
Go back home, go. Good girl.

102
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,669
See yourself with my eyes.
In front of your beauty...

103
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,269
thousand moons look pale.

104
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,229
Why didn't you knock at the door?

105
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,629
Where was the necessity?
You had placed a rope.

106
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:28,349
- Placed a rope, where?
- See here.

107
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,789
- This looks a rope to you? It is a snake.
- Snake!

108
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,669
You don't know the difference
between a rope and a snake?

109
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,749
I hope you haven't become blind,
Bilwa Mangal.

110
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:41,229
May be. Too much of light
makes a man at times blind.

111
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:57,389
When I become big and make a theatre,
you will work in it?

112
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:58,629
Of course.

113
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:03,229
- I will become Bilwa Mangal, and you?
- Chintamani.

114
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:32,509
- How is the house?
- Friend, it is empty.

115
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,829
Clerk, give me a
ticket worth 1 paisa.

116
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,869
Listen Gentlemen. We are going
to stage for you Kewal Theatre...

117
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:05,949
Company famous Play, Bilwa Mangal.
New dances, new songs...

118
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:12,709
and in it famous actress Nimmi
Miss Nirmala, and Master Kewal..

119
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:18,229
Are working.
New dance, new songs and new scenery.

120
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:24,297
Tickets only 1 anna,
2 paise and 1 paisa. Booking there.

121
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,330
Give me the tickets.

122
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,829
You give the tickets,
I will put on the clothes.

123
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,749
Give me the tickets. Here is 10 paise.

124
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,897
- Give me the tickets.
- Move.

125
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,373
Kewal Theatre Company?

126
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,429
Give me tickets worth 2 paise.

127
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,466
Be careful.

128
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:24,229
Hey it is time, start the play.

129
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,709
- Has Nimmi come?
- No.

130
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,537
Start lifting the curtain.

131
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,937
- Song?
- Yes, song.

132
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:16,689
"You have only taught me love."

133
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:26,148
"You have only taught me love."

134
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:29,466
"You have only.."

135
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,811
Oh my nose!

136
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:41,149
- Has Nimmi come?
- No.

137
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,789
- Do you know anything else.
- No.

138
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:53,189
We don't want songs,
we want Bilwa Mangal.

139
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,709
- What happened?
- Nimmi has gone.

140
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,869
What?-Nimmi has gone.
With her mother, I saw her go.

141
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:07,589
She said she is going
to her uncle's place forever.

142
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,343
She was crying a lot.

143
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:12,189
- Nimmi has gone?
- She was crying a lot.

144
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:13,789
She must have gone by now.

145
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:17,069
They were going by
the 1 O' clock bus.

146
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,709
What is the time now?

147
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,709
It is still five
minutes to 1 O'clock.

148
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:24,709
What will happen to the play?

149
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,229
Without Chintamani,
can Bilwa Mangal play?

150
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,629
Close it. The play will not run.

151
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:53,783
Nimmi! Nimmi! Nimmi!

152
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,709
But Nimmi left.

153
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,989
The lights of my dreams
were switched off.

154
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,869
I couldn't do anything.
I was so frustrated.

155
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:10,229
Man is so helpless.
I was standing there.

156
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,389
And my life was going away from me.

157
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:22,349
Life appeared like the road,
long, dark, sad and desolate.

158
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:28,229
After several years when, with father,
we left Reshampur for Bombay...

159
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,709
and from school I went to college,
then...

160
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:57,549
This is Miss Nirmala Devi.
She has migrated from Jaipur College

161
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:02,509
Miss Nirmala,
we will have to make a place for you.

162
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:09,109
For the moment you sit down there.

163
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,726
- Taligram.
- Sir.

164
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,684
- William.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,251
- Biharilal.
- Yes, sir.

- We don't have a girl in our class. - No.
- Then who is she?

179
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,545
Girl? Where?

Kewal Khanna present sir.

Were you sleeping?

184
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,299
I had lost something.
I was looking for it.

185
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,874
What did you lose?

186
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,015
Silence.

187
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,491

You are Miss Nirmala?

192
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:49,059
- Yes, why?
- Just like that.

193
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,539
It is a very sweet name.

194
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,779
Were you called Nimmi
in your young age?

195
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:02,379
No, my childhood name is Munni.

196
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:10,419
- Are you from Reshampur?
- No, sir. From Jaipur.

197
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,156
Kewal Khanna.

198
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:18,419
You are fined 2 Rs.

199
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,739
- But why?
- Not 2 but 4 Rs. Get out of the class.

200
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:34,259
- But why?
- Every time you ask your fine will increase.

201
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:39,419
Pardon me,
but I will keep asking, why?

202
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,299
8 Rs -16 Rs, But why?

203
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:45,899
You were talking.

204
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:52,579
Thank you, at least I know why.

205
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:07,097
The minister of the state was
unaware of the state's condition.

206
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:18,827
- Kewal Khanna.
- Yes.

207
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:28,459
- I wish to apologise.
- Apology? What apology?

208
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:31,499
Because of me you were fined.

209
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:37,259
- Fined due to you?
- Talking to me you were fined.

210
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:45,019
I've been fined. The good part
is I was fined for talking to you.

211
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,179
- May I ask you something?
- Please do.

212
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,219
Why did you ask me my childhood name?

213
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:01,459
In childhood I too knew one Nirmala.
People called her Nimmi

214
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:06,979
She was very sweet. Really sweet.

215
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,779
- When was this?
- Some 100 years back.

216
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,259
- When I was 10 years old.
- Where is she now?

217
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:23,099
Who knows? She went then only.
I wrote several letters.

218
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,539
But didn't get a
reply to a single one.

219
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:34,779
I came to know she went with
her uncle. Now 11 years have passed.

220
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,779
You haven't forgotten her?

221
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:42,579
Can one forget life's
first wonderful dream?

222
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,379
- What did you say your Nirmala was called?
- Nimmi.

223
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,379
If you want, you can call me Nimmi.

224
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:01,419
Nimmi was just like you.

225
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:07,179
The lamp from one place...
The wick from another.

226
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:12,019
Today they are life companions.
The moon is the witness.

227
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:18,407
Traveller, look at the moon.

228
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:26,487
Traveller, look at the moon.

229
00:31:52,059 --> 00:32:00,059
Traveller, look at the overcast
skies, look at the skies.

230
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:13,219
Clouds cast a veil on the moon,
it is playing its game.

231
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:21,138
Oh, see the game of the clouds.

232
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:29,659
Traveller, see how the clouds
leave the moon in this game.

233
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:37,739
Look towards the moon,
oh traveller, look.

234
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:18,179
Look towards the waves,
Traveller, look at the coast.

235
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:30,019
She couldn't hide the tide
of emotions, looking at the moon.

236
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:35,539
When the tides met the moon,
the music rose to a crescendo.

237
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:38,339
The music rose to a crescendo.

238
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:51,139
See how the moon meets
the shore & look at that.

239
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:59,419
Traveller, look at the moon.

240
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,926
Prakash, when is the poetry exam?

241
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,918
In the first meeting, pal.
In the first meeting!

242
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,644
- Give it to me first.
- Oh man, I was about to ask you.

243
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,463
- Only you're left now.
- 10th pass. Oh my god!

244
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:28,944
I copied all the notes except economics.

245
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,572
You have it? We're all set now.

246
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,458
Hey man, let me read the poem.

247
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:43,864
- Check which meeting he is in.
- First meeting.

248
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,683
Mother, I am going.
Greetings father.

249
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,803
Where are you going, Kewal?

250
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:57,323
Today is University Dramatics
We're playing Shakuntala.

251
00:34:57,803 --> 00:35:01,363
- Hoping for an award?
- World lives on hope.

252
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,083
And when is your examination?

253
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:09,723
- On the 10th.
- Only three days left, isn't it?

254
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:16,483
- Yes.
- You said correctly, world lives on hopes.

255
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,455
Vocational education..
Greetings father.

256
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,228
Nirmala!

257
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:48,504
Nirmala!

258
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:52,796
Nirmala!

259
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,861
Nirmala!

260
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,099
Nirmala!

261
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:08,655
Nirmala!

262
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:16,245
Nirmala!

263
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:24,406
Kewal.

264
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,146
Nirmala!

265
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,075
Nirmala!

266
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:43,483
Since long I have
been waiting for you.

267
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,203
You know the drama starts
sharp at 9 'O' clock.

268
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:50,449
Kewal.

269
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:56,643
I know, but...

270
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,242
But what?

271
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:02,482
I will not be able to come.

272
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:13,882
- I can't say.
- Cant say, why?

273
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,362
Without you,
how will Shakuntala be played.

274
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,682
Hundreds of people
would have gathered there.

275
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:27,202
- I am helpless.
- What joke is this?

276
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:29,642
This is not the time to joke.

277
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:37,722
This is not a joke.
I can't play Shakuntala from today.

278
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:42,162
But why, you could have
told me two days before.

279
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:43,885
How could I tell you?

280
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:48,122
How did I know?

281
00:37:49,122 --> 00:37:51,802
Let us know what you didn't know

282
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:59,402
You see this Henna on my hands.
I have been engaged.

283
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,982
I am going to get married
the day after tomorrow.

284
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:13,082
- Your engagement? When?
- Today only, I didn't know.

285
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:23,322
But Mother & Father forced it on me.
He is going to England...

286
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:32,122
Who, your fiancee?

287
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:42,202
Yes. He wants to
take me along with me.

288
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,922
But what could I do, Kewal?

289
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:56,962
I was helpless, my hands were tied.
My lips are sealed.

290
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:07,322
Kewal, you are angry with me?

291
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,722
What will I do getting angry with you?

292
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:14,202
It was in my destiny.

293
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,642
I had only few days in my paradise.

294
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,522
Everything of mine has been looted.

295
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:26,336
Kewal.

296
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:29,802
Before going may I ask you something.

297
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,722
Tell
-Is it acceptable to you?

298
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,368
Tell me, Nirmala.

299
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:52,082
Call me Nimmi once. Only once.

300
00:39:56,402 --> 00:40:03,042
Nimmi, may you always remain happy.

301
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:10,762
May your life be filled
with smiles and song.

302
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:15,922
Let not the shadow of
unhappiness ever fall on you.

303
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:21,722
Wherever you stay, stay happy.

304
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:29,442
Let each night be full moon night'

305
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,002
May you never see
the darkness of no moon.

306
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:44,162
May you always remain happy, Nimmi.

307
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:11,322
I am alive, but there is no life.
I am a burning lamp but...

308
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:18,882
there is no light.

309
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:27,133
I am alive, but there is no life.
I am a burning lamp but...

310
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,333
there is no light.

311
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:59,882
Some moments have passed,
parting with somebody.

312
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:08,242
Some moments have passed,
parting with somebody.

313
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:15,842
Till today this fire in
my heart is still not subsided.

314
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:21,082
I am alive but there is no life...

315
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:31,740
I had only tears and
anger in front of me.

316
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:39,676
I had only tears and
anger in front of me.

317
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:47,642
The shore was in sight but
somehow my boat did not reach.

318
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:52,682
I am alive...

319
00:43:55,922 --> 00:44:03,922
A smile coming to the lips, it
is not possible. It is an affair...

320
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:18,802
of the heart and
not just a romance.

321
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:23,362
I am alive...

322
00:44:26,856 --> 00:44:34,562
The moon, the breeze,
the clouds are all mute witnesses.

323
00:44:34,794 --> 00:44:41,929
The moon, the breeze,
the clouds are all mute witnesses.

324
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:50,082
When you are not there,
there is also no charm in them.

325
00:44:50,842 --> 00:44:57,919
I exist as if there is no life.

326
00:44:58,522 --> 00:45:05,682
I am a burning lamp,
but there is no light.

327
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:14,232
I am alive but there is no life.

328
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:19,636
My number 220

329
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:23,398
Come on fast.

330
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,550
I have passed.

331
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:31,074
I have passed. My number is there.

332
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:37,962
See my roll number also.

333
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,783
What is it your number?

334
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,797
No. 425

335
00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:44,191
I will look for 425.

336
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:48,642
419, 420...

337
00:46:51,553 --> 00:46:55,082
421, 422.'

338
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:57,762
423...

339
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,542
Bilayti

340
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:03,402
What happened to my number?

341
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:06,158
424.

342
00:47:06,682 --> 00:47:07,769
What happened?

343
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,962
Why aren't you speaking?

344
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,214
What to tell.

345
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:22,538
Our company was only till here.
I have passed and you...

346
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:40,322
- 420, 421...
- 422.423,424...

347
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:50,602
I am telling you there
must be some mistake.

348
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:54,322
Listen, can't your
son fail by mistake also?

349
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:58,602
I knew from beginning.
Kewal's attitude was like that only.

350
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:02,682
Three days before the test,
Lord was playing Shakantula.

351
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:04,722
This also is my fault, isn't it?

352
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:07,122
Not yours, your love's.

353
00:48:07,602 --> 00:48:11,082
Whenever I wanted to say
something to Kewal, you held me.

354
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:15,642
- The result is that..
- Kewal failed. Isn't it.

355
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:20,402
I am only bad. Only I am to be blamed.

356
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,202
What have I said?

357
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:25,802
Besides saying what else you know.

358
00:48:26,522 --> 00:48:29,642
Kewal left at 7 O'clock
in the morning and hasn't returned.

359
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,202
And he hasn't...

360
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:46,162
When I grow up and make a company,
you will work in it?

361
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,375
Sure.

362
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:51,842
- I will become Bilwa Mangal, and you?
- Chintamani.

363
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:09,002
You please sit down. I will open.

364
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:15,962
And I plead with you
don't say anything to Kewal.

365
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:30,341
Kewal.

366
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,522
You have come.

367
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:39,562
Son, you aren't worried
when you go out.

368
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,842
You aren't even bothered about mother?

369
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,466
These hands heal a few wounds too.

370
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:08,922
If everybody starts passing
exam then exams will cease.

371
00:51:10,322 --> 00:51:12,922
It is the duty of each
human being to work hard.

372
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:17,306
And you left no stone unturned!

373
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:23,042
Yes, it is a fact that from your great
grand father downwards passing has...

374
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:27,602
had never been a problem.

375
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:33,482
Your mother says where
there is a will there is a way.

376
00:51:34,242 --> 00:51:36,522
Exams are held each year.

377
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,682
If not this year,
you will pass in next.

378
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:48,754
They say a falling rider,
can mount & ride again

379
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,898
You are also the same, Kewal.

380
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,722
When the colleges open,
you can join again.

381
00:51:58,802 --> 00:52:01,562
You must have heard
the story of the ant.

382
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:07,962
Yes. but now I don't want
to join college.

383
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:10,362
- What?
- I don't want to study.

384
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:13,522
- What did you say?
- I don't want to study.

385
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,362
Why?

386
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:17,602
I don't feel like studying.

387
00:52:17,682 --> 00:52:20,402
If you don't study, how will
you become a government lawyer?

388
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:22,492
How will you sit in chair

389
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,442
That chair on which
sat my great grand father..

390
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:27,562
My grand father and you.

391
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:30,602
- I don't want that chair.
- Kewal.

392
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:36,482
Mother, I can't resume studies.
And what are studies today.

393
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:40,421
Henry the 8th had 8 wives.

394
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:43,402
There is relation
in demand and supply.

395
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:49,202
A little bit of Sanskrit a little
of English and 50 marks for Hindi.

396
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:54,162
Is it all important?

397
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:58,002
I say if you spend one more
year in college, what harm is there?

398
00:52:59,002 --> 00:53:03,562
It makes a difference.
One year of my life will be wasted.

399
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:06,362
What job are you getting
in a Lord's office?

400
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:08,809
Another year of your
life will be deducted.

401
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:11,442
A lord's office is
not everything in life.

402
00:53:12,962 --> 00:53:17,122
Secondly I don't want to work also.

403
00:53:17,482 --> 00:53:20,722
Then you will roam around
like a loafer on the streets?

404
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:28,602
You may say that.
I want to make my theatre.

405
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:36,002
- Theatre?
- Yes I want to make my own theatre.

406
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:37,851
Kewal.

407
00:53:38,722 --> 00:53:41,242
What are you saying?
What has happened to you.

408
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:51,082
For the first time I have tried
to understand the world with my eyes.

409
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:57,691
I want to seek my own destiny.

410
00:53:58,158 --> 00:54:00,722
And if you get lost
seeking your destiny, then?

411
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:05,282
I will try and search my road again.

412
00:54:05,362 --> 00:54:06,563
Kewal.

413
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:10,082
Remaining in my house,
you can't search your own path.

414
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:22,042
Thank you father

415
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:26,362
You have removed the
biggest boulder from my path.

416
00:54:37,882 --> 00:54:39,522
Give me your blessings.

417
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:48,282
I am going.

418
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,882
Think again, Kewal.
It is not easy to make your own path.

419
00:54:55,242 --> 00:55:00,322
I know that. I myself
want to fall into difficulties.

420
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:03,122
I don't like easy routes.

421
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:06,522
I like twisted routes with thorns.

422
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:12,042
Give me your blessings, Mother.

423
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:14,282
You cannot leave me Kewal.

424
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:15,922
- I am helpless.
- Kewal.

425
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:21,042
Kewal, I touch your feet.
I plead to you.

426
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:25,762
Your love is spreading
thorns along my way, mother.

427
00:55:25,962 --> 00:55:29,922
- I will remove the thorns son...
- Mother.

428
00:55:32,922 --> 00:55:34,762
Mother, I am helpless.

429
00:55:36,068 --> 00:55:37,722
Don't increase my difficulties.

430
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,962
Why don't you stop Kewal.

431
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:50,162
I have heard many such threats.

432
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:53,042
Skies which thunder don't rain.

433
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:56,002
You will see,
Kewal will return tomorrow.

434
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,070
I know very well to Kewal.

435
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:06,200
He will not come.
I am his mother. He will not come.

436
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,762
I had said I want to find my own path.

437
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:28,184
I walked that way.
I faced problems on the way.

438
00:56:29,377 --> 00:56:31,098
Failures stopped me.

439
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:37,242
I have been two days on this road
facing problems. There is no money.

440
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:43,122
Stomach was empty.
But there was disquiet within.

441
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:52,746
I got tired, sat down, but
got up again, to walk on the road...

442
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,482
which I had chosen myself.
Which was the path of my life.

443
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:00,270
Theatre.

444
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:02,968
Theatre.

445
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:05,450
Theatre is my destination.

446
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:11,031
Till I reached my destination.

447
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:16,760
But still the destination
appeared so far.

448
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:24,501
So far. So far.

449
00:58:46,682 --> 00:58:50,002
And if searching for your
destiny you get lost, then?

450
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,079
I will try again to find
my path, father.

451
00:58:54,442 --> 00:58:58,242
Kewal, staying in my house
you cannot search your own roads.

452
00:58:58,532 --> 00:58:59,948
Thank you, father.

453
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:06,082
Father, you have removed
the biggest stone along my path.

454
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:13,202
Kewal I touch your feet.
Kewal, your mother pleads to you.

455
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:15,538
Mother.

456
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:24,442
Mother, I am helpless.
Don't increase my difficulties.

457
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:30,402
Think again Kewal.
Making one's own road is not easy.

458
00:59:33,642 --> 00:59:41,642
I know father. I want to
myself get into difficulties.

459
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:50,642
I don't like easy routes.
I seek twisted thorn filled paths.

460
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:10,962
This is not my story.

461
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:18,455
In all cities, in all houses,
this is what confronts all the youth.

462
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:23,082
This life is his,
but to make it is not in his hands.

463
01:00:24,522 --> 01:00:29,322
A fistful of earth, if the parents
want make it into a lovely idol,

464
01:00:29,402 --> 01:00:31,602
or make a plaything
without hands or legs.

465
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:35,002
I ask why we shouldn't
make our own lives.

466
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:42,602
My father is angry with me.
Our family is a family of lawyers.

467
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:45,882
When the first court
in India was opened..

468
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,642
My great grand father
was a lawyer in it.

469
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:52,602
How can a man of this
family make a theatre company.

470
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:56,842
How can he make a theatre.

471
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:02,802
My mother is also very unhappy.

472
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:10,362
Mother loves me a lot. All
the comforts of the world are there.

473
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:17,762
Still I left home. Mother,
how can I tell how helpless I am.

474
01:01:19,762 --> 01:01:26,842
I can never repay your love.
I remember those days when...

475
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:35,362
I used to fall sick, you would
cry and pray to God for my life.

476
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:50,002
But mother I am helpless.

477
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:57,482
I am tired and defeated.
I didn't scorn your love.

478
01:01:58,362 --> 01:02:03,482
I just left the house which
couldn't hear the screams of my heart.

479
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:10,442
Please forgive me,
and tell father...

480
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:16,962
I will not disgrace him.
I will take theatre to such heights...

481
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:25,162
that they respect it and
not make fun of it. Or laugh at it.

482
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,802
Mother..

483
01:02:57,002 --> 01:03:00,002
Great. Really great.

484
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:05,738
Very good! You speak nicely.

485
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:09,882
May I know whom I am addressing.

486
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:14,762
When you spoke it appeared
the sculpture of Ajanta was speaking

487
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:16,885
Really great.

488
01:03:17,842 --> 01:03:20,762
- Who are you?
- Your voice has magic.

489
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:25,082
And your face, wonderfully sad.

490
01:03:25,642 --> 01:03:31,322
- Tell me, Who are you?
- I am an artist, I make pictures.

491
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,322
Pardon me,
I don't want to make any pictures.

492
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,162
I am also the owner of this theatre.

493
01:03:40,402 --> 01:03:44,682
- You are in this theatre?
- Yes, I am the owner of this theatre.

494
01:03:45,962 --> 01:03:49,402
- Are you fond of dramatics?
- Yes.

495
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:54,722
- Have you worked on the stage? - Yes.
- When?

496
01:03:56,442 --> 01:04:00,322
Yes. About 100 years
back when I was 10 years old.

497
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:05,802
- 100 years back? How old are you now?
- 20 years old.

498
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:13,042
Oh, you seem to have suffered.
That is how it hurts you.

499
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:17,042
- Yes you can say it like that.
- Who was she?

500
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:18,202
Who was she?

501
01:04:21,242 --> 01:04:24,602
She was one.
I don't even know her name.

502
01:04:25,602 --> 01:04:27,002
I only know that..

503
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:30,242
When she danced, it appeared
as if the sun was dancing...

504
01:04:31,102 --> 01:04:33,242
in the ripples of the stream.

505
01:04:34,322 --> 01:04:38,882
That girl you will meet again.

506
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:43,802
Your devotion will not go waste.

507
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:46,366
And your penance.

508
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:48,202
And your Nimmi?

509
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:53,393
It's different about me.

510
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:56,842
My fate is like that.

511
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,202
I am somehow getting used to my fate.

512
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:08,082
Every moment of life
is burning my soul.

513
01:05:11,522 --> 01:05:15,517
- Ok, I will go now.
- Where will you go?

514
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,282
- Wherever my feet take me.
- Why don't you stay here?

515
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:30,282
- What will I do here?
- Do dramatics. Fulfill your desires.

516
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:37,202
- Really?
- Why not? Since ages this theatre is empty.

517
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:39,750
Many people have asked,

518
01:05:40,754 --> 01:05:42,103
but I have never said yes.

519
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,082
Nobody capable has ever asked me.

520
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:50,482
- But what is my capability?
- Your capability?

521
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:56,922
Your desires are so strong,
I am feeling embarrassed.

522
01:05:57,315 --> 01:05:59,962
Perhaps theatre is
not up to your capability.

523
01:06:00,602 --> 01:06:02,442
Will you take on dramatics?

524
01:06:04,242 --> 01:06:10,122
- Yes, definitely. But...
- But what?

525
01:06:11,602 --> 01:06:13,402
I will not work on salary.

526
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:19,482
Theatre will be yours, whatever
work you want to give me, give.

527
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:25,162
- Agreed?
- Yes, I agree.

528
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:30,602
- What is your name?
- Nobody told you my name?-No.

529
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:35,122
- It is Rajan. And yours?
- I too didn't tell you my name?

530
01:06:35,202 --> 01:06:38,522
- No.
- It is Kewal.

531
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:42,082
It means we two are alike.

532
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:45,442
The time will pass well
when two love stricken meet.

533
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:46,522
Certainly.

534
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:49,042
I will put all my
wealth on this theatre.

535
01:06:50,362 --> 01:06:52,522
- All your wealth?
- Yes, all my wealth.

536
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:59,423
- Why don't you believe me?
- Yes, I do believe. But...

537
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:03,482
- But what?
- Do you have four annas?

538
01:07:04,282 --> 01:07:12,282
- Yes, but why?
- I have not eaten for last 2 days.

539
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:27,842
From today we are
friends and partners.

540
01:08:28,618 --> 01:08:30,737
Leave me. Leave my neck.

541
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:33,442
Go, this is not a public shelter.

542
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:37,206
This is a theatre company. Go, Go.

543
01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:38,555
I want to meet Mr. Kewal.

544
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:40,899
Many like you come to meet Mr. Kewal.
Get out of here.

545
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:43,571
- Bilayati.
- Kewal!

546
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,589
Kewal! Kewal!

547
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,841
We are meeting after a long time.

548
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,002
How are you?
We are meeting after college.

549
01:08:53,202 --> 01:08:54,442
I am all right.

550
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:56,321
Do you do any work?

551
01:08:57,162 --> 01:09:00,322
- Yes I do Kewal.
- What work?

552
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:03,002
Measuring roads, hunting for a job.

553
01:09:04,002 --> 01:09:05,762
Tell me the truth.
You haven't found work?

554
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:08,882
- No, Kewal.
- Will you work with me?

555
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:12,562
A small work. What work?

556
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:14,522
- To Dance.
- To Dance?

557
01:09:14,602 --> 01:09:15,442
- To sing.
- To sing?

558
01:09:15,522 --> 01:09:18,402
- I will make you an actor.
- Me an actor?

559
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:55,881
At night the stars shine.
At night when the stars shine...

560
01:09:56,802 --> 01:10:01,882
my lover winks, and I die.

561
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:12,762
At night the stars shine, My heart
spreads its legs in your apron.

562
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:15,242
What should I do, God?

563
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:23,122
At night when the cuckoo sings..

564
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:31,322
My heart sways. And I die, God.

565
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:42,882
At night when the cuckoo sings,
he discloses our secrets.

566
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:49,242
What should I do God?

567
01:10:51,802 --> 01:10:59,802
At night when the moon shines,
Give me my heart slave.

568
01:10:59,932 --> 01:11:02,082
And I will die, God.

569
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:12,933
At night when the moon shines,
this heart can't live without you.

570
01:11:13,322 --> 01:11:15,242
What should I do God.

571
01:11:18,101 --> 01:11:26,101
At night when the clouds roam,
leave me my apron, or I will die.

572
01:11:31,482 --> 01:11:39,482
At night when the clouds fly,
my heart also flies,

573
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:42,242
What should I do God.

574
01:12:06,275 --> 01:12:11,275
Coming, Coming, Kewal Theatre
famous play coming Aag!

575
01:12:14,475 --> 01:12:19,275
But where is the girl? There
is no girl and the drama is coming.

576
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,515
- Listen. - Yes Kewal.
- Who has given the advertisement?

577
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:24,915
I have given.

578
01:12:26,195 --> 01:12:28,155
- You have given?
- Yes, why?

579
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:32,235
But where is the girl? Without her,
how will we run the drama?

580
01:12:32,502 --> 01:12:36,035
There is still plenty of time.
You are worrying unnecessarily.

581
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:39,395
I was worrying about it only.
But what is the matter.

582
01:12:39,845 --> 01:12:41,365
Come with me -But where?

583
01:12:41,562 --> 01:12:44,445
Come on.
You ask too many questions.

584
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,805
But what is this?
Why don't you tell me?

585
01:12:52,155 --> 01:12:54,885
The fruit of patience is always sweet.

586
01:12:57,525 --> 01:12:58,605
Cigarette?

587
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,405
Thank you.

588
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:05,863
Tell.

589
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:09,565
See there!

590
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:14,925
How will she be?

591
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:18,805
For which work?

592
01:13:19,507 --> 01:13:24,565
For the work of heroine, why?

593
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:28,717
No.

594
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:40,485
Rajanbabu,
this way you cannot get a heroine.

595
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,285
Then how will we?

596
01:13:45,285 --> 01:13:46,725
That I don't know.

597
01:13:47,725 --> 01:13:50,765
But in them there is no
girl worth becoming our heroine.

598
01:13:52,285 --> 01:13:55,445
There is more to see.
Atleast you should see all.

599
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:57,725
It is no use.

600
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,845
Atleast let us know what
is your requirement of a heroine?

601
01:14:02,645 --> 01:14:10,645
My choice,
a girl as innocent as a drop of dew.

602
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:17,805
As vibrant as a mountain stream.

603
01:14:18,445 --> 01:14:22,525
Who, if she cries,
the oceans also scream.

604
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:28,245
If she smiles,
she will make the world smile.

605
01:14:29,226 --> 01:14:36,765
Such a girl in whose eyes is wine,
whose voice has song...

606
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:39,805
and whose walk has magic.

607
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:43,074
How is she?

608
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,965
No! And this one?

609
01:14:52,005 --> 01:14:53,445
What do you think of this one?

610
01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:54,805
No.

611
01:14:55,565 --> 01:14:58,205
- And this one?
- No!

612
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:01,582
- And this one?
- No!

613
01:15:05,045 --> 01:15:06,165
And how will she be?

614
01:15:06,245 --> 01:15:07,245
No.

615
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:16,879
And this one? No, no, no!

616
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:20,685
There is no girl,
who can be our heroine.

617
01:15:21,245 --> 01:15:23,366
See some more
-It is no use.

618
01:15:23,446 --> 01:15:24,762
Kewal sir,
there is a girl who has come.

619
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,205
Tell them we have seen enough.
We don't want to see any more.

620
01:15:27,463 --> 01:15:28,544
Kewal sir.

621
01:15:28,836 --> 01:15:32,885
At least see her once. I have
also worked for 30 years in theatre.

622
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:37,085
Fact is sir, I don't want
to work through your experience.

623
01:15:37,549 --> 01:15:39,285
I want to learn my lessons myself.

624
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:41,365
Kewal sir. Kewal sir.

625
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:23,645
I heard there is a job here.

626
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:27,765
Yes, there is. What is your name?

627
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:38,264
I have no name.

628
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:40,805
You have no name?

629
01:16:40,885 --> 01:16:43,605
- How can that be.
- I told you I have no name.

630
01:16:53,778 --> 01:16:57,565
Where do you come from?
Where is your house?

631
01:16:59,302 --> 01:17:00,605
I have no house.

632
01:17:04,145 --> 01:17:05,572
I have no house.

633
01:17:07,605 --> 01:17:10,645
You have no house.
Then where have you come from?

634
01:17:12,405 --> 01:17:14,005
- From hell.
- From hell?

635
01:17:14,085 --> 01:17:17,525
Yes, from hell.
Today there is fire every where.

636
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,805
If Punjab isn't hell then what is it.
In this hell my parents..

637
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,605
My three brothers, and my two sisters,
have been consumed. In this fire.

638
01:17:27,085 --> 01:17:31,285
I lost my house, and my name.
You want to ask anything else?

639
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,625
Come.

640
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:51,650
Why does cuckoo make noise?
It brings to mind one's near one.

641
01:19:53,700 --> 01:20:01,700
Why does cuckoo make noise?
It brings to mind one's near one.

642
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:13,005
It makes one's eyes wet,
can somebody explain to her.

643
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:27,798
My heart lets out a sigh,
tell me what is my fault.

644
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:37,807
My heart lets out a sigh,
tell me what is my fault.

645
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:49,166
Tell the cuckoo not to sing,
one remembers one's dear one.

646
01:20:55,967 --> 01:21:03,967
My eyes get wet,
remembering those old days.

647
01:21:05,849 --> 01:21:13,849
My eyes get wet,
remembering those old days.

648
01:21:16,925 --> 01:21:24,925
My heart gets on fire,
Oh, somebody douse these flames.

649
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:39,420
My life goes on slowly,
and these memories put me on fire.

650
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:49,048
My life goes on,
and these memories consume me.

651
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:56,325
Please somebody explain to her.

652
01:21:56,565 --> 01:22:01,325
My death will come before its time.

653
01:22:18,085 --> 01:22:20,365
Wah, what acting.

654
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:26,085
What magic in your voice.
You sing so well.

655
01:22:26,685 --> 01:22:30,685
It looked as if for a
moment the world had stopped.

656
01:22:31,894 --> 01:22:38,965
It was as if an angel was
singing for the stars & the moon.

657
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:43,205
One should learn deceitful
praise only from you.

658
01:22:43,466 --> 01:22:50,325
Your song had tears,
smiles, and the colors of flowers.

659
01:22:51,485 --> 01:22:54,005
This was not a song it was magic.

660
01:22:54,277 --> 01:22:56,477
If you don't believe what
I say why don't you ask Kewal?

661
01:22:57,085 --> 01:22:58,405
Kewal, what do you think?

662
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,836
Kewal sir.

663
01:23:05,172 --> 01:23:09,712
Kewal sir.

664
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,336
Kewal sir.

665
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:25,965
Why did you come away like that?

666
01:23:31,365 --> 01:23:32,765
Oh just like that.

667
01:23:35,605 --> 01:23:37,645
You should have said something.

668
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:42,589
Said what?

669
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:49,045
That your song had tears, laughter.

670
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:53,125
The color of flowers,
and your sighs carried warmth?

671
01:23:53,845 --> 01:23:55,885
You should have said something.

672
01:23:58,384 --> 01:24:00,390
What is the difference
if I tell it now?

673
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,285
Your songs neither had tears,
nor laughter, nor the color of...

674
01:24:06,805 --> 01:24:09,125
flowers,
nor your sighs carried any warmth.

675
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,925
Any noise is not a song.

676
01:24:14,325 --> 01:24:17,965
Songs are sung from the heart,
and not from the throat.

677
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,525
But Rajan was praising me
to the skies -That is the difference.

678
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:28,045
Rajanbabu is an artist.
He can make pictures.

679
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:31,925
He doesn't know how
to put life into them.

680
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:35,405
He gets carried away
by the beauty of the face,

681
01:24:36,561 --> 01:24:38,405
I want to peep into the soul.

682
01:24:39,525 --> 01:24:46,165
His eyes stop at the skin,
whereas I wish to dive into...

683
01:24:47,203 --> 01:24:50,045
the depths of the oceans
and search for the pearls.

684
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:54,285
There is a lot of difference
between Rajanbabu and me.

685
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:59,325
He is a worshipper of the body,
and I of the soul.

686
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:03,165
I want to see the hint
of your soul in your eyes.

687
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:06,085
In your tears should be visible your,
drops of blood.

688
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:08,365
Your hands should have...

689
01:25:08,445 --> 01:25:12,445
the rays of the
sun and its fire too.

690
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:19,171
Your songs should be such which
should touch the hearts.

691
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:24,965
I will try... I will try.

692
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:33,725
I do not want that
you wilt before you flower.

693
01:25:41,931 --> 01:25:45,817
I want you to see at the
highest peak of success.

694
01:25:49,533 --> 01:25:57,071
Kewalbabu, I will try.
I swear that I will try.

695
01:26:19,284 --> 01:26:27,284
No tears in my eyes,
no sigh on my lips.

696
01:27:06,215 --> 01:27:13,055
No tears in my eyes,
no sigh on my lips.

697
01:27:13,135 --> 01:27:19,589
It has been quite a
time that I have smiled.

698
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:26,363
No tears in my eyes,
no sigh on my lips.

699
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:33,204
It has been quite a
time that I have smiled.

700
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:54,566
I have tear drops which
are formed in my eyes...

701
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:07,522
I have tear drops which
are formed in my eyes...

702
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:15,975
will they too slip away
from me and leave me bereft.

703
01:28:16,055 --> 01:28:22,630
Will they too slip away
from me and leave me bereft.

704
01:28:35,653 --> 01:28:43,653
I have no peace even after
getting destroyed...

705
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:56,424
I have no peace even after
getting destroyed...

706
01:28:58,103 --> 01:29:04,295
The heart which is on fire,
what peace can it have.

707
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:10,840
The heart which is on fire,
what peace can it have.

708
01:29:23,509 --> 01:29:31,509
Only the darkness of life
has remained steady with me.

709
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:44,229
Only the darkness of life
has remained steady with me.

710
01:29:45,735 --> 01:29:52,175
The heart which is extinguished,
how can it sparkle.

711
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:58,679
The heart which is extinguished,
how can it sparkle.

712
01:30:11,735 --> 01:30:16,935
- See this painting, Kewal, I have just finished it.
- It is good.

713
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:27,095
First see her, then see this.
How is it?

714
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:42,735
That is beauty. This is
just the silhouette, the shadow.

715
01:30:43,935 --> 01:30:48,055
What is it in this picture, that
it reminds me of Nimmi repeatedly,

716
01:30:54,455 --> 01:31:00,255
What is in this picture,
I see in this girl also.

717
01:31:05,205 --> 01:31:07,283
Nimmi.

718
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:22,815
I had made you as delicate
as the flowers, but...

719
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:26,455
who has placed a stone
in place of your heart.

720
01:32:27,163 --> 01:32:31,575
Rajanbabu, I am very happy today.

721
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:38,255
Today I have touched the skies.
He called me Nimmi and said...

722
01:32:38,802 --> 01:32:40,775
he likes the name very much.

723
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:43,008
Rajanbabu...

724
01:32:45,711 --> 01:32:47,822
Rajanbabu..

725
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:52,295
You are not saying anything.

726
01:32:52,735 --> 01:32:56,815
You are saying, so what
is the need for me to say anything?

727
01:32:57,535 --> 01:33:02,855
- You didn't like the name?
- No, it is a very nice name.

728
01:33:04,815 --> 01:33:07,855
Then why aren't you happy,
you look sad?

729
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:12,255
I look sad? No, where am I sad.

730
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:18,615
Today I am very happy. Very happy.

731
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:28,930
He called you Nimmi.
He calls you thus since he loves you.

732
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:41,495
Nimmi, today you have
truly touched the skies.

733
01:33:45,295 --> 01:33:49,935
Today I am very happy,
truly very happy.

734
01:33:51,724 --> 01:33:54,291
I have never been so
happy my entire life.

735
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,535
But you are crying.

736
01:34:06,615 --> 01:34:10,535
No, when happiness crosses limits..

737
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:12,735
It turns into tears.

738
01:34:13,735 --> 01:34:18,375
Look carefully in my
tears you will see my smile.

739
01:37:23,435 --> 01:37:28,295
Now go and rest,
We have a play in the evening.

740
01:37:29,648 --> 01:37:31,287
How was the dance?

741
01:37:35,935 --> 01:37:38,408
- It was good.
- Only good?

742
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:47,208
It was good. If you bring
in more flexibility in your body...

743
01:37:48,008 --> 01:37:49,568
it will be better.

744
01:37:51,528 --> 01:37:59,528
I will only accept when each
of your steps reveals the soul.

745
01:38:05,138 --> 01:38:07,016
My eyes.

746
01:38:18,888 --> 01:38:20,088
Taxi has come.

747
01:38:20,652 --> 01:38:21,895
All right.

748
01:38:25,246 --> 01:38:27,528
I am going home after a full one year.

749
01:38:28,128 --> 01:38:32,008
- I will ask my mother and father to see the play.
- Will they come?

750
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:37,448
I can't say about father,
but mother will definitely come.

751
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:43,808
She cannot refuse.
She will be happy seeing you.

752
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,801
She loved Nimmi also very much.

753
01:38:46,881 --> 01:38:50,528
Taxi is waiting.

754
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:57,448
Ok I will take leave.
We will meet in the evening.

755
01:38:58,368 --> 01:39:02,848
- I will give you one good news.
- What good news?

756
01:39:03,528 --> 01:39:09,728
I will tell in the evening.
If you hear, you will dance.

757
01:39:11,138 --> 01:39:17,888
Your heart will touch
the skies -Tell me now.

758
01:39:19,488 --> 01:39:22,368
No, I will tell in the evening.

759
01:39:33,048 --> 01:39:35,128
- So that is the story.
- What is it?

760
01:39:35,608 --> 01:39:38,928
- I knew it from the beginning?
- What did you know?

761
01:39:39,888 --> 01:39:44,408
I will tell in the evening.
If you hear, you will dance.

762
01:39:44,488 --> 01:39:45,888
Have you gone mad?

763
01:39:46,084 --> 01:39:49,368
Me mad? Just wipe the
sweat off your forehead.

764
01:39:49,448 --> 01:39:52,088
- You son of a...
- Come, come.

765
01:39:54,409 --> 01:39:56,382
- Kewal.
- Laxmi..

766
01:39:56,808 --> 01:39:59,248
- Where is mother?
- She is upstairs, MOTHER!

767
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:01,288
Mother, Junior sir has come.

768
01:40:02,408 --> 01:40:10,408
My son, my Kewal.

769
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:22,768
You remembered your Mother today.
I missed you so much.

770
01:40:24,571 --> 01:40:26,448
Let me see how you are?

771
01:40:28,888 --> 01:40:32,728
Come sit down, yes.

772
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:40,848
- Mother, I have to go soon.
- Where son? You have just come.

773
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:46,168
Mother, I am doing a play today.
I came to call you.

774
01:40:47,786 --> 01:40:51,408
- Where is father?
- He has gone to court. Wait till he comes.

775
01:40:51,799 --> 01:40:54,368
Some other time.
Say, will you come to see the play?

776
01:40:56,150 --> 01:41:00,164
Come and see what your
worthless son has done.

777
01:41:00,826 --> 01:41:01,880
Will you come?

778
01:41:02,128 --> 01:41:04,128
- Certainly I'll come.
- And father?

779
01:41:04,515 --> 01:41:09,088
- I will try.
- Mother, you should come, I will be waiting.

780
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:50,880
She is a sixteen years old girl..

781
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:55,164
She is a sixteen years old girl..

782
01:42:56,353 --> 01:42:59,368
Has fair legs and
there are anklets on them.

783
01:43:00,704 --> 01:43:02,866
Has fair legs and
there are anklets on them.

784
01:43:02,946 --> 01:43:10,946
They make our steps wayward.

785
01:43:20,473 --> 01:43:28,473
With sandal paste applied on hands,
who will not lose heart?

786
01:43:29,283 --> 01:43:35,838
Who will not lose heart?

787
01:43:42,568 --> 01:43:50,568
And seeing the moonlike face,
who would not say, Oh God!

788
01:43:53,688 --> 01:44:01,688
Everybody's gaze was on her,
She was sixteen years old.

789
01:44:20,328 --> 01:44:27,096
The moon tells its own story,
So why does anybody sigh.

790
01:44:27,637 --> 01:44:34,056
Why does anybody sigh?

791
01:44:34,339 --> 01:44:41,109
Seeing somebody's youth,
Why should anybody get tempted

792
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:48,122
Why should anybody get tempted?

793
01:44:48,514 --> 01:44:56,514
Seeing anyone's beautiful face,
why should anyone get lost?

794
01:44:58,648 --> 01:45:03,168
Why should anyone get lost?

795
01:45:08,848 --> 01:45:16,848
- Is anybody keeping track?
- It's a sixteen year old.

796
01:45:17,392 --> 01:45:21,848
She is now sixteen years old!

797
01:45:38,637 --> 01:45:41,328
- How was it?
- It was nice.

798
01:45:41,799 --> 01:45:45,568
Try to forget yourself
when you are on the stage.

799
01:45:45,648 --> 01:45:48,448
Forget all these for the moment.
Tell me what is the good news.

800
01:45:49,168 --> 01:45:50,596
- Should I tell?
- Yes.

801
01:45:50,676 --> 01:45:55,088
After today, the drama
I will do will be called Nimmi.

802
01:45:55,168 --> 01:45:58,248
But what is the good news?
What, isn't it good news?

803
01:45:58,705 --> 01:46:02,048
I thought it was some thing else.
What did you think?

804
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:06,928
Ok, we will talk later.

805
01:46:15,947 --> 01:46:18,380
- Mother.
- Kewal, my child.

806
01:46:18,608 --> 01:46:24,448
Son, may you live for 100 years.

807
01:46:25,663 --> 01:46:27,688
Today you have made me cry.

808
01:46:29,136 --> 01:46:34,008
See my tears have yet to dry.

809
01:46:34,447 --> 01:46:37,608
Mother, the fortunes of
this theatre have been kindled.

810
01:46:38,368 --> 01:46:45,448
Yes, but these tears will remain.
My eyes will always be wet.

811
01:46:46,732 --> 01:46:50,288
You are talking in riddles, mother.

812
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:56,448
Should I ask you something?
Once I had asked you once.

813
01:46:56,528 --> 01:46:57,826
Do you know when?

814
01:46:57,906 --> 01:47:00,368
When mother?-When you
were leaving the house...

815
01:47:01,328 --> 01:47:05,488
- That time you didn't listen to me.
- Then tell me what do you want.

816
01:47:05,853 --> 01:47:08,069
Kewal, I want a daughter-in -law.
Your bride.

817
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:10,191
- Mother.
- Kewal.

818
01:47:10,745 --> 01:47:12,786
Kewal. My child.

819
01:47:16,248 --> 01:47:17,728
- Have you seen Rajan?
- No.

820
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:38,029
Mr. Rajan!

821
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:43,703
Mr. Rajan! Mr. Rajan!

822
01:47:51,552 --> 01:47:52,731
Mr. Rajan!

823
01:47:56,991 --> 01:47:58,180
Mr. Rajan!

824
01:47:59,954 --> 01:48:01,327
Mr. Rajan!

825
01:48:07,413 --> 01:48:08,602
Mr. Rajan!

826
01:48:13,412 --> 01:48:14,412
Mr. Rajan!

827
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:42,008
I have made you,
I can destroy you also.

828
01:48:43,368 --> 01:48:45,048
I have given you birth,

829
01:48:45,368 --> 01:48:47,568
I will now put you
to the sleep of death.

830
01:48:51,928 --> 01:48:55,111
Call your Kewal and
tell him to revive you.

831
01:49:02,979 --> 01:49:04,201
Mr. Rajan!

832
01:49:14,408 --> 01:49:16,168
You came to meet Nimmi?

833
01:49:20,925 --> 01:49:23,048
She is dead.

834
01:49:27,328 --> 01:49:30,528
See? My hands are red with her blood.

835
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:33,168
These hands have killed her.

836
01:49:35,088 --> 01:49:41,128
- What have you done?
- What have I done?

837
01:49:42,048 --> 01:49:45,768
These paintings were my life.

838
01:49:47,528 --> 01:49:50,848
Consider as if I had
tried to kill myself.

839
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:55,688
- But why?
- As if you don't know.

840
01:49:58,365 --> 01:50:02,288
- Yes, I don't know anything.
- You don't know anything?

841
01:50:02,769 --> 01:50:06,689
You don't know that this is Nimmi,
whom I had seen only once.

842
01:50:06,969 --> 01:50:09,569
And I destroyed my peace for life.

843
01:50:09,929 --> 01:50:12,729
You don't' know she is the
one girl whose pictures I made...

844
01:50:12,929 --> 01:50:17,198
- and of no one else?
- No!

845
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:21,969
You don't even know that
my life is incomplete without her?

846
01:50:22,129 --> 01:50:25,369
- And she desires you? She desires you.
- No, No!

847
01:50:25,609 --> 01:50:26,809
You are lying.

848
01:50:32,449 --> 01:50:34,249
I am not lying, not lying.

849
01:50:37,121 --> 01:50:38,818
I am not lying, not lying.

850
01:50:55,929 --> 01:50:58,449
Tell me, what is the good news?

851
01:50:58,889 --> 01:51:00,609
- Is this true, Nimmi?
- What?

852
01:51:01,209 --> 01:51:03,769
That you love me
and that you desire me?

853
01:51:06,449 --> 01:51:09,769
- Ask your heart, Kewalbabu.
- I have asked.

854
01:51:12,489 --> 01:51:15,129
- What does it say?
- It says it does not.

855
01:51:15,489 --> 01:51:17,289
- It says Rajan.
- Rajanbabu?

856
01:51:17,649 --> 01:51:20,249
Yes, Rajanbabu,
his life is incomplete without you

857
01:51:20,667 --> 01:51:22,278
his songs are lifeless
without you.

858
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:27,929
But what about me?

859
01:51:29,529 --> 01:51:33,609
How incomplete is my life,
what do you know.

860
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:36,729
Rajanbabu is my friend.
I know him very well.

861
01:51:37,283 --> 01:51:40,289
Nimmi, what is there
in me that you desire me?

862
01:51:41,089 --> 01:51:42,809
What is there in you?
You want to know.

863
01:51:45,609 --> 01:51:50,329
He does not have such a face..

864
01:51:51,694 --> 01:51:53,249
And he does not have your blue eyes.

865
01:51:53,809 --> 01:51:58,449
He does not have golden hair.
Such blue eyes, such golden hair...

866
01:51:58,649 --> 01:52:01,809
Nimmi, he has his golden soul.

867
01:52:03,729 --> 01:52:11,329
Soul? You had said Rajanbabu
worshipped the body...

868
01:52:12,051 --> 01:52:14,169
and you sought
to peep into the soul.

869
01:52:15,409 --> 01:52:20,089
Alas, I wish you
had peeped into my soul.

870
01:52:21,122 --> 01:52:22,484
You should have seen..

871
01:52:22,564 --> 01:52:29,689
How many hopes,
how many dreams, I had for you.

872
01:52:31,049 --> 01:52:34,329
And these tears speak for themselves.

873
01:52:34,409 --> 01:52:36,329
All this is untrue
-Untrue?

874
01:52:36,849 --> 01:52:40,289
If that was so why did you
come every night into my dreams

875
01:52:41,009 --> 01:52:43,129
Dreams are all false, Nimmi.

876
01:52:46,289 --> 01:52:48,889
Then was all this just a dream?

877
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:57,409
- Nimmi. I am helpless.
- But I too am helpless.

878
01:52:59,929 --> 01:53:02,409
Rajanbabu loves you a lot.

879
01:53:03,249 --> 01:53:05,689
His heart lies tormented at your feet.

880
01:53:06,489 --> 01:53:08,689
At your feet also
a heart lies tormented.

881
01:53:10,237 --> 01:53:12,021
- Nimmi.
- Mr. Kewal.

882
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:14,097
Nimmi.

883
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:17,449
Excuse me, your scene has come.

884
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:23,689
What should I tell Rajanbabu?

885
01:53:25,297 --> 01:53:30,609
Tell her Nimmi is dead. Tell
him you have throttled her yourself.

886
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:41,889
Your marriage?

887
01:53:42,129 --> 01:53:47,769
No, no. As a human you
have to fulfil your duties first.

888
01:53:48,151 --> 01:53:51,769
Put your life at risk
and save the community.

889
01:54:10,889 --> 01:54:15,889
- You cannot go!
- Don't try and stop me. The fate of the country.

890
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:19,289
Is at stake.
My country is calling me.

891
01:54:19,929 --> 01:54:22,929
- It is a question of life and death for me.
- I am helpless.

892
01:54:23,169 --> 01:54:26,329
- I too am helpless.
- Don't increase my problems.

893
01:54:27,849 --> 01:54:32,049
- But my love?
- Tell it to stop. And get away from my path.

894
01:54:54,769 --> 01:55:02,769
Heart is broken.
Fate took it & broke it again.

895
01:55:05,089 --> 01:55:13,089
Heart is broken.
Fate took it & broke it again.

896
01:55:15,569 --> 01:55:23,569
There are no tears left in the eyes.
My heart is broken.

897
01:55:26,152 --> 01:55:34,152
There are no tears left in the eyes.
My heart is broken.

898
01:55:44,489 --> 01:55:52,489
In the world of aspirations,
love gets a bad name.

899
01:56:00,049 --> 01:56:08,049
In this broken life of mine,
love gets a bad name.

900
01:56:10,649 --> 01:56:15,569
Love gets a bad name.

901
01:56:16,009 --> 01:56:24,009
You made me yours,
and now after that you have left me.

902
01:56:26,369 --> 01:56:34,369
You made me yours,
and now after that you have left me.

903
01:56:54,988 --> 01:57:02,988
Desires torment the heart.
And the heart keeps burning.

904
01:57:10,469 --> 01:57:18,469
Desires torment the heart.
And the heart keeps burning.

905
01:57:23,449 --> 01:57:31,449
After putting me on fire,
you have left me to burn.

906
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:41,629
After putting me on fire,
you have left me to burn.

907
01:57:51,701 --> 01:57:59,701
Prosper and may you have plenty.
May all your wishes be fulfilled

908
01:58:06,999 --> 01:58:14,999
Prosper and may you have plenty.
May all your wishes be fulfilled

909
01:58:17,209 --> 01:58:25,209
By leaving me in the world,
you've made me a tale of woe.

910
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:35,409
By leaving me in the world,
you've made me a tale of woe.

911
01:58:37,689 --> 01:58:44,394
The heart is broken, fate has...

912
01:58:45,097 --> 01:58:48,578
- Fire!
- Fire!

913
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:31,001
- Have you seen Kewalbabu?
- No madam.

914
02:00:31,936 --> 02:00:33,590
Mr. Rajan is searching for him.

915
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:33,121
Nimmi, come near me.

916
02:01:34,165 --> 02:01:35,203
No.

917
02:01:36,652 --> 02:01:42,241
Why are you inching back?
Look into these blue eyes.

918
02:01:43,614 --> 02:01:46,761
These eyes you liked them very much,
didn't you?

919
02:01:47,354 --> 02:01:52,281
And these golden hair,
just touch them and see.

920
02:01:52,954 --> 02:01:59,830
Scared of me?
From this beautiful face?

921
02:02:01,462 --> 02:02:04,441
- I used to come in your dreams, is it not?
- No.

922
02:02:05,127 --> 02:02:13,127
Then why are you...
Nimmi, face isn't everything.

923
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:20,561
Golden hair does not
give company for long in life.

924
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:26,921
A dream, just with a small jolt,
melts away like wax.

925
02:02:27,754 --> 02:02:28,987
Mr. Kewal.

926
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:32,392
Kewal.

927
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,721
Somebody has come to see you.

928
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,601
- Let them come.
- Come.

929
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:51,921
Who?

930
02:02:56,024 --> 02:02:57,024
Who is it?

931
02:02:59,144 --> 02:03:00,144
It is me.

932
02:03:00,597 --> 02:03:01,597
Nimmi.

933
02:03:03,984 --> 02:03:09,584
Nimmi, sit down. How are you?

934
02:03:10,944 --> 02:03:17,064
- You have come alone?
- Yes, how are you?

935
02:03:20,544 --> 02:03:21,704
I am alright.

936
02:03:27,944 --> 02:03:29,544
You brought flowers?

937
02:03:32,704 --> 02:03:33,904
This ring?

938
02:03:37,224 --> 02:03:38,224
He has given.

939
02:03:39,818 --> 02:03:40,942
Who?

940
02:03:41,704 --> 02:03:44,104
- Rajan?
- Yes.

941
02:03:47,864 --> 02:03:51,984
- When is the marriage?
- When you become alright.

942
02:03:56,704 --> 02:04:03,704
I will pray for you both.
Once before I had prayed like this.

943
02:04:06,466 --> 02:04:14,466
Nimmi, may you always remain happy.
May you always smile.

944
02:04:20,704 --> 02:04:25,344
Let not even the shadow
of sorrow fall on you.

945
02:04:26,384 --> 02:04:31,904
Let every night of yours be
of full moon. Let total dark moon...

946
02:04:33,059 --> 02:04:39,104
never befall you.
Always remain happy.

947
02:04:41,469 --> 02:04:43,209
Always remain happy.

948
02:04:44,506 --> 02:04:46,766
Always remain happy.

949
02:04:47,674 --> 02:04:53,036
Always remain happy. Nimmi.

950
02:04:54,993 --> 02:04:58,024
Did she also disappear from your life?

951
02:04:59,123 --> 02:05:07,123
Yes, she just got
lost only in my blue eyes.

952
02:05:08,864 --> 02:05:16,024
She never got time to see
into my soul, reach my heart.

953
02:05:16,528 --> 02:05:24,528
- Has anyone reached your heart?
- Yes, - Who? - Nimmi.

954
02:05:27,144 --> 02:05:33,264
She wanted me.
Not my blue eyes or my beautiful face.

955
02:05:33,846 --> 02:05:37,304
- When was this?
- Some 100 years back...

956
02:05:37,904 --> 02:05:45,024
When I was 10 years old.
We used to study & play together.

957
02:05:46,584 --> 02:05:52,744
We used to dream together.
Now it looks a dream.

958
02:05:53,984 --> 02:05:56,664
But you haven't forgotten her?

959
02:05:58,104 --> 02:06:00,264
How can one forget.

960
02:06:01,251 --> 02:06:03,931
Nimmi's memories are settled
permanently in all corners of my heart.

961
02:06:05,586 --> 02:06:07,584
Just like the smell of these flowers.

962
02:06:10,304 --> 02:06:12,784
But even if she comes
in front of you...

963
02:06:13,435 --> 02:06:15,304
you will not recognise her.

964
02:06:16,971 --> 02:06:21,987
I will not recognise her?
I will recognise her amongst a lakh.

965
02:06:22,704 --> 02:06:25,464
- And she is one in a lakh.
- All lies.

966
02:06:26,192 --> 02:06:31,464
Even If she is sitting in front
of you, you will not recognise her.

967
02:06:34,464 --> 02:06:36,104
Have you recognised me?

968
02:06:53,224 --> 02:06:54,264
Recognised?

969
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:10,010
- Nimmi.
- Kewal.

970
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:14,346
Nimmi.

971
02:07:18,821 --> 02:07:20,161
Nimmi.

972
02:07:22,344 --> 02:07:27,624
Sudha, Nimmi.
I am not understanding anything.

973
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:30,584
Since you gave my name to others...

974
02:07:30,664 --> 02:07:32,864
I started calling myself Sudha.

975
02:07:34,128 --> 02:07:35,480
Nimmi.

976
02:07:37,064 --> 02:07:39,224
- May I ask one thing, Nimmi.
- Ask.

977
02:07:39,904 --> 02:07:43,944
I will once again make a theatre?
Will you work in it?

978
02:07:44,024 --> 02:07:45,048
Sure.

979
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:49,384
I will become Bilwa Mangal, and you?

980
02:07:50,064 --> 02:07:51,184
Chintamani.
