1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Stop. Stop here.

2
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:39,083
Quick...... we'll miss the train.

3
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,125
What took you so long?

4
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,125
Sorry darling. Come in.

5
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,833
Wait.... Did you close the door?

6
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,333
What's your name? - Nikhil.... why?

7
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
Father's name? - S. K. Pandey.

8
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,833
What do you do? - I work... in an office.

9
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,708
Apart from kissing girls what else do you do in your office?

10
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,750
What's your favourite food?

11
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,291
Your date of birth?

12
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:37,541
Who's she? Girlfriend? Or just time pass?

13
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,708
What's going on? What are you doing?

14
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,250
Love or lust?

15
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,458
Who are you? - You're asking me?

16
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,541
Who the hell are you? - You're asking me?

17
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:53,083
Yes, answer me. - See you soon.

18
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,666
Hey... wait a minute...

19
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,666
Who is he?

20
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:01,125
Hello. Mr. Mukherjee speaking? - Yes.

21
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,500
Calling from Inner Eye Detective Agency sir,

22
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,375
Mr. Dayashankar Joshi would like to speak to you.

23
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,208
Mr. Joshi from Inner Eye? - Yes sir.

24
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,000
Ok, connect it.

25
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Sir, Mr. Mukherjee is on the line.

26
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,208
Yes, Mr. Mukherjee? - Yes.

27
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:29,000
We have interesting news about your case. - Oh.

28
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,375
Can you come to our office?

29
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,291
No. Tell me over the phone.

30
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:41,958
The girl you selected for your son is having an affair..

31
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,833
with a guy called Nikhil Pandey.

32
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,916
We have proof.... photos of the boy and his house.

33
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:55,041
Can you get one of them together? - Yes, if you give us some time.

34
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:02,291
'Let it go.' - Than...

35
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,916
OK. Shall we continue?

36
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,416
'No, not necessary.' I will tell you.

37
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:15,666
I'll send a man to you with the photos and a bill tomorrow.

38
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,666
You paid an advance of 3000. 5000 is still due. OK?

39
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,416
Who is Dayashankar Joshi? Who?

40
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,166
Are you Dayashankar Joshi? - Yes, yes...

41
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you following me? You think I don't understand?

42
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,875
Who sent you after me?

43
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:05,708
Look, you are misunderstanding... No one appointed us!

44
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,250
Shut up.

45
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,541
What misunderstanding? Don't pretend.

46
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,958
That old fool...

47
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,041
I got your name, number, everything from his mobile.

48
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:21,166
Tell him I can't stand him.

49
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:28,833
His breath, his touch, his laugh... I despise everything. I hate him.

50
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,208
No, no madam, Mr. Sharma is a nice man.

51
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,250
He loves you a lot.

52
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,916
He showed me your old photo, said it was love at first sight.

53
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,958
He made cold coffee for me.

54
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,708
Believe me, it was great.

55
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,875
He's slightly possessive about you.

56
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:56,125
Stop talking nonsense. Why did you say no one hired you?

57
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:01,000
If you ever follow me again, I'll shut down your company.

58
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you understand? Don't forget.

59
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:15,458
Anwar, you've been here for ten years and you still don't know....

60
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,916
sniffers must work secretly. This is basic.

61
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,916
How did she know you've been following her?

62
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:33,875
If her husband loves her or not, it's none of your business.

63
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,583
In the Mukherjee case,

64
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,541
the way you asked names and took photos was not right.

65
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,916
You are ruining both your own and the company's reputation.

66
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:48,208
But I had to know if the girl was in good hands.

67
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,000
Did they really love each other or was the boy just having fun?

68
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
What if the girl got pregnant?

69
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,708
Shut up! Everyone is not an idiot like you!

70
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,708
Find out as much as you need, and flush off the rest. OK?

71
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:19,291
Our company has a good name. My father started it forty years ago.

72
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:25,583
He was a genius, the only Sherlock Holmes in the city.

73
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,583
Sir, you said that before.

74
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,041
Go to Mr. Mukherjee's house tomorrow and collect the cheque.

75
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,166
Take the photo of the girl and the documents he gave us.

76
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,166
You have a new case from tomorrow.

77
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,208
Sit down.

78
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you left-handed, sir?

79
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:25,750
Could you give part in cash? OK, sir... no problem.

80
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,500
Here's the balance payment.

81
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,500
Where is the original picture of the girl? I'll need it.

82
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,375
Here sir, I've also got other photos.

83
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,375
I handled the case, sir.

84
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,833
No picture showing them together?

85
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,791
Give me one more day, sir... I'll get one.

86
00:12:55,291 --> 00:13:02,416
No. I've checked on four girls.

87
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:07,291
They're all the same. Nonsense!

88
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:14,291
Mr. Anwar, such things don't happen in your Muslim community, do they?

89
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:23,583
You have strict social discipline. Girls and boys don't mix, do they?

90
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:30,291
Well sir, things are changing. - Bye dad.

91
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,833
Your son?

92
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,166
Looks like you sir.

93
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,416
You're looking for a girl for him? - Yes.

94
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,333
For this fellow?

95
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,708
Sorry Pradip. - Why are you so late?

96
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,666
Sorry, sorry... please don't mind.

97
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,958
Try to understand.

98
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,833
I told my parents...

99
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,833
How long can we wait?

100
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,875
Let's celebrate.

101
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,750
Where will we celebrate?

102
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,375
Any 5-star...

103
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:55,291
Really? - Sure.

104
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:04,083
What gift will you give me? - Surprise.

105
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,500
Pradip, I missed my date.

106
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,833
Meaning?

107
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,916
You idiot! You don't understand anything.

108
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,375
I told you to take precaution, but you didn't.

109
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,125
What if something happens? Nothing will happend, don't worry.

110
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,125
May I sit here?

111
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,541
That man is taking our picture.

112
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:39,250
That one?

113
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,250
Yes, the one with black glasses.

114
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,083
Hey! Stop!

115
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,916
Hey! Stop!

116
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,708
He's gone.

117
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,375
Mr. Mukherjee?

118
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
Who are you?

119
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,166
Wow! What biceps!

120
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,333
Isn't there a big picture of a horse in your house?

121
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,041
My god, it's great.

122
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,541
Who are you?

123
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,166
Your father is a lefty,

124
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,416
but has great handwriting.

125
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,000
Isn't your father looking for a bride for you?

126
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,750
Who the hell are you? - Wait, wait...

127
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,666
And you're going round with another girl?

128
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,166
Now she is pregnant!

129
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,375
You should marry this one. She's good looking.

130
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,666
Why are you bluffing your father?

131
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,250
How many bellies do you want to blow up?

132
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,250
You son-of-a-bitch!

133
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,333
Salam, Anwar. - Salam, Uncle. How are you?

134
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:03,500
You didn't meet my parents. They were a fantastic couple!

135
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Deeply in love with each other, like in that film - 'Amar Prem Kahani'

136
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:27,833
Sometimes I think, if they were so much in love, then why just me?

137
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,375
My uncle had fourteen children.

138
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,375
Don't ask how he had fourteen.

139
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,208
I think father wanted her to look young forever...

140
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:27,625
Are women just child-producing machines?

141
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,625
Too many children wears out a woman.

142
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,833
What do you think?

143
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,125
Say something.....

144
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,291
I'm doing all the talking...

145
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:58,041
Speak up, my dear.

146
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,291
Dad was a postman.

147
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,125
You know what a postman is?

148
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:12,916
He wore his uniform, set out on his cycle and..

149
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,333
delivered a thousand letters a day.

150
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:20,750
Every letter had a story.

151
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,333
One man got a job.... another one lost his.

152
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,625
Someone had a son... Someone had a daughter.

153
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:32,333
Strange, isn't it ?

154
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,916
Did you ever get a letter?

155
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,875
Who would write to you? Your old master?

156
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:48,916
He kicked you out of his house because you had a skin disease.

157
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:56,333
If you hadn't met me, you'd be wandering around the streets today.

158
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,583
Me too...

159
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,458
I was also new in this city, all alone.

160
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,666
You need a companion in the city.

161
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:12,208
And you started following me...

162
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,375
I looked back and you howled.

163
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:20,208
I understood you also needed a friend.

164
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,666
I've had too much to drink.

165
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,333
Lalu,

166
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:32,541
do you remember your mother?

167
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,541
I really miss mine.

168
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:43,833
My... Wait... Lalu...Lalu..

169
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,833
Come here... sit...sit.

170
00:21:53,583 --> 00:22:04,541
Mummy's father was a rich man. He died when she was a child.

171
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:09,166
I spent my school holidays with grandmother.

172
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:15,791
They had a big house... I'll take you to there some day.

173
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:22,375
I'll take you to meet someone...

174
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,166
...my dream girl.

175
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,041
Ayesha.

176
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:32,041
Oh my god! She was so beautiful.

177
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:43,458
Tall, fair, long black hair, Dimples....

178
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:50,208
I liked her so much.

179
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:59,458
She loved me, but our backgrounds were so different.

180
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:04,458
She had no guts...

181
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,458
No guts means no future... No future.... no life!

182
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,083
Her parents married her off...

183
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:24,083
She's gone.

184
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,416
I've had too much.

185
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,791
What now? Potty?

186
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:37,083
Just when I was getting into a good mood...

187
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,750
such a nice mood...

188
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,750
Lalu, let's go potty.

189
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:23,666
Have a grand shit... the envy of your friends.

190
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,791
Shame, shame, shame !

191
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,291
Look Lalu... look at the city.

192
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,500
How strange !

193
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,708
All the ghosts are rising up.

194
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:42,708
Even the ghosts in this city stab each other in the back.

195
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:48,000
They suspect each other.

196
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,000
Have you ever seen a ghost? Come.

197
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,541
What's wrong?

198
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:03,875
What's wrong?

199
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:09,250
I'm constipated...

200
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,333
My god !

201
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:14,333
Don't know when I'll shit again.

202
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,791
What's your problem?

203
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:47,791
Haven't had any sex for years.

204
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,791
My goodness !

205
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:12,291
What happened to you?

206
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:21,791
I haven't slept for ten years.

207
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,791
I've lost the pleasure of sleep.

208
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,125
Ohhh !

209
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,083
Come. This way..

210
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,916
Please wait here.

211
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:40,000
Plus what you told the office, I need more information.

212
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,000
Ok. Ask me.

213
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,416
Did your father stay alone in Jassidi?

214
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,833
Did you and your mother go there?

215
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,708
Sometimes.

216
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:55,250
He came home every weekend.

217
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,833
Did he have any servants?

218
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,333
No, he made his own breakfast.

219
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,666
Lunch was at the office.

220
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:11,458
He ate out for dinner or brought food home.

221
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,958
What did the police say?

222
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,583
Didn't you pursue the case?

223
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:20,333
We wanted to but they kept saying

224
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,333
it was a regular suicide case.

225
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,291
Did he have any friends there? Do you know anybody?

226
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:35,458
He had a few friends, but we only knew Uncle Manoj...

227
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,416
Manoj Srivastav.

228
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:45,875
They were colleagues. We met him every time we went to Jassidi.

229
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,375
Didn't he know something?

230
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:48,666
Did you ask him?

231
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,583
He said, he didn't know anything at all.

232
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,916
I also can't understand...

233
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:08,125
My father was supposed to have dinner with him that night.

234
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,750
I feel like Uncle Manoj is covering up something.

235
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,458
Covering what? Any idea?

236
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:18,458
No, but I'm sure he knows something....

237
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,041
OK...thanks.

238
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,041
Do you have a photo of your father? - Yes.

239
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,625
Is this you? - Yes.

240
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:07,625
He loved you a lot.

241
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:24,750
What's the time? Forget it.

242
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,166
What's the time?

243
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:33,791
It's bad times. - What's the time? - Eleven.

244
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,791
Stop. Stop.

245
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:40,791
Mr. Manoj?

246
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,458
Yes.

247
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,291
I'm Anwar.

248
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,916
Okay.

249
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:48,958
You recognised me?

250
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,208
I was sitting at a distance when you went to...

251
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,458
our office yesterday.

252
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:58,125
I intentionally kept quiet.

253
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:06,291
I wanted to meet you privately, so I phoned you last night at your hotel.

254
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:15,916
I couldn't say anything to the police, but I need to tell you everything.

255
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:27,875
This must be confidential. Sudhakar was my friend.

256
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,541
Before his death he told me about his gay relationship with Adarsh

257
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,583
I promised not to tell anyone. He had to kill himself.

258
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,375
That devil made his life hell.

259
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,375
I'll tell you everything. You can meet him in town tomorrow.

260
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,291
Uncle , some tea please. Two cups.

261
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:18,291
Come in.

262
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,541
Have a seat.

263
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,500
Sudhakar didn't want to continue our relationship any more.

264
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,875
Why?

265
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,875
I don't know.

266
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:05,875
He was never a very bold man.

267
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:12,500
But it was he who seduced me.

268
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,916
Actually, when he entered my life, I had someone else.

269
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:26,958
But he insisted.

270
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:30,958
Everything happened very fast.

271
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:37,666
It got serious. I loved him.

272
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,125
How long did you....?

273
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,458
Ten years.

274
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:31,000
Not one or two... but ten years.

275
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,708
Sudhakar went to Kolkata regularly, stayed with his family...

276
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,708
You never stopped him?

277
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,666
Why would I?

278
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:52,166
He missed his daughter.

279
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,833
He used to go to meet her.

280
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,250
As long as he came back to me,

281
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,250
I didn't have any problem.

282
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,250
What's my problem if he goes to meet his daughter ?

283
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,750
Why did he kill himself ?

284
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,916
I don't know.

285
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:40,625
He wasn't the kind to commit suicide.

286
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:45,208
He was a jovial fellow.

287
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:55,125
In fact, whenever I was down, he'd sing and dance ...

288
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:59,833
and cheer me up.

289
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:03,833
Did you quarrel before he died ?

290
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:19,083
Yes.

291
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:23,083
The night before that...

292
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,166
we had a big fight.

293
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:40,125
I got very angry and said I'd tell everything to Pushpa.

294
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,166
Pushpa?

295
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:45,000
His wife.

296
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,375
We knew each other.

297
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,375
Didn't Pushpa suspect anything?

298
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,625
Sudhakar was a different man in front of his family.

299
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:08,875
He was drifting away from me.

300
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,875
I could feel it.

301
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:20,708
He was planning to take a transfer to Kolkata.

302
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:27,291
When I found out, I was very angry.

303
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:32,750
I asked him, how he could do that to me.

304
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,958
I had no problem about our relationship,..

305
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,958
but he hid it till his last breath.

306
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,958
You know small town society...

307
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,541
bunch of hypocrites!

308
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:03,291
Everything has to be kept under cover.

309
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,958
I feel suffocated living here like this...

310
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:10,958
Excuse me.

311
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:24,625
You said you respect our relationship,

312
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,958
that's why I opened up...

313
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,958
and shared my life with you.

314
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Believe me, I never wanted him to die.

315
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:52,125
I still love him.

316
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,958
Can you please stop?

317
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:13,791
If it's the big job, we don't have that much time.

318
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,791
No no. It's the small one.

319
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:40,375
Hey, hurry up! How long will you take?

320
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,166
What are you doing?

321
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,333
Hey you !

322
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,458
Now what?

323
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:52,458
The hell with you!

324
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,791
Ayesha.

325
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:49,125
Ayesha, do you remember?

326
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:54,875
I remember you all the time.

327
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,875
I could never forget you.

328
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:04,416
Do you live here?

329
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:09,458
What do you do?

330
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,541
I teach in a school.

331
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,541
Oh, yes. You always wanted to be a teacher.

332
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:27,250
And you wanted to be 'nothing'.

333
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,666
What do you do now?

334
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,541
I follow people, I sniff around and...

335
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,666
find out about them.

336
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,666
Today, I've found you again.

337
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:47,375
Are you happy?

338
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:52,208
Does your husband love you the way I did?

339
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,833
Can we start again?

340
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,833
If you have children, we'll raise them up together....

341
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:14,541
You haven't changed a bit, Anwar.

342
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:19,916
You always lived in a strange world of your own.

343
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:23,458
I don't belong to that world!

344
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:29,416
You loved me a lot. You still do.

345
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:33,416
How could you give yourself away so easily?

346
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:43,041
I'm getting late. I should go now.

347
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,958
Ayesha, won't we ever meet again?

348
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,666
You?

349
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,625
Sorry, I came without informing you.

350
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:46,625
Come inside.

351
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:59,166
Sudha, you have such a nice name.

352
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:03,458
Who gave you this name? Your daddy?

353
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:08,916
Our agency will call later and tell you everything. But...

354
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,250
Don't tell them I've been here. - I won't.

355
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:19,458
If they know about it, I'll lose my job. Please.

356
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:23,708
Did you find anything?

357
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:32,125
Yes, I found that your daddy was a great man.

358
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:39,333
Everyone loved him. They talk about him even now.

359
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:48,375
He was friendly, helpful, charming. He loved you a lot, but...

360
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:53,916
But? But what?

361
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,166
Tell me..

362
00:45:56,666 --> 00:46:04,791
He was depressed. He wanted a transfer, but...

363
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:14,041
But everything about his transfer was settled.

364
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:17,416
He was confused.

365
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:22,666
Actually, he had a relationship there in Jassidi.

366
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:29,083
Mr. Anwar, my father was a decent man.

367
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,541
He loved my mother.

368
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:37,208
It's not possible that there was another woman in his life.

369
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:40,458
Not a woman.

370
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,125
A man.

371
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,625
What?

372
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,166
What?

373
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:52,333
Your father had a relationship with another man.

374
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,416
Rubbish!

375
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,833
It's not rubbish.

376
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,000
What proof do you have?

377
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,958
Proof. - Who is this man?

378
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,958
Proof, I don't have... - Than...

379
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:09,000
How can you say such a thing without proof?

380
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,041
I'll file a case against your company.

381
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,041
Get out of this house!

382
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,791
Don't get upset.

383
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,958
Doesn't a man have the right to live his own way?

384
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,458
Your father was a good man. These thing happen.

385
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:32,458
Shut up and get out!

386
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,458
What's the matter with you?

387
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:46,166
He was your daddy, and he always will be.

388
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:49,125
Get out or I'll call the police.

389
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,125
Get out.

390
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:19,083
Son, can you help me cross the road?

391
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:04,875
Where do you live? - Down that street.

392
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,541
Can you go alone?

393
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:10,000
OK then. Goodbye.

394
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,000
Why don't you come to my house? - Ok.

395
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:44,458
Where do you live? What is your name?

396
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:50,875
I live nearby... Bhowanipur.

397
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:58,041
My name is....Mohammad Anwar.

398
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,791
Where are you going? Sit.

399
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:08,416
You have to eat these. I have made them myself.

400
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:12,416
Try this first.

401
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:29,291
You look exactly like my son. There...

402
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,625
Where is he? Doesn't he stay with you?

403
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,500
He lives far away, in Dubai.

404
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,666
He's an engineer.

405
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,583
Does he visit you?

406
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:50,000
How can he? He's so busy. He works in a big company.

407
00:50:50,500 --> 00:51:00,416
He has a lot of responsibility. But I visit him quite often.

408
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,250
You go alone?

409
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,083
Yes, who is there to go with me?

410
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:10,375
I travel a lot..

411
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,708
I went there this morning to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday..

412
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,708
and returned by evening.

413
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,625
Do you understand ?

414
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:45,583
I go to my ancestral home in Benaras, where I grew up...

415
00:51:46,083 --> 00:52:01,416
and Kulu Manali where I went for my honeymoon when I was sixteen.

416
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:07,791
That's my husband.

417
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:13,291
He was very handsome. He loved me a lot.

418
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,791
Anyway, past is past.

419
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:20,416
Now I go to deserts, jungles... wherever I like.

420
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:25,750
I love to go places.

421
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,333
Whenever I feel like it... I just go.

422
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:37,333
Anwar, don't you go anywhere?

423
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,833
Come, let's go.

424
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:44,833
Remember, a long journey begins with just one step.

425
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:59,125
Gopal, come here.

426
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,708
Has Lalu eaten?

427
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,958
He won't eat when you're not there.

428
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:06,125
I gave him meat last night. He didn't touch it.

429
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:06,916
Did you bathe him?

430
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,541
I don't have time for my own bath.

431
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,125
See, such a crowd at the shop.

432
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,166
Did you take him out? - No. I couldn't.

433
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:19,333
He's been locked up for three days? - My boss didn't let me go.

434
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:20,416
Did he go for potty?

435
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:25,000
Maybe he did it in the room.

436
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,791
Give me the keys. - Catch them.

437
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:30,791
Gopal, come here.

438
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,916
Why this hunger-strike for three days?

439
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:53,916
No food, no potty, locked up for three days....

440
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:59,083
I have to go out and work. Otherwise, how could we survive?

441
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:03,083
How could I buy your food?

442
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,458
Let's go somewhere else.

443
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,375
Where do you want to go?

444
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,958
Mathura, Benaras, Kashmir, Darjeeling?

445
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,416
Tell me.

446
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:29,083
I met an old lady today!

447
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,291
I went to her house. She gave me sweets...

448
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:35,583
and sat next to me like my mother used to.

449
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:38,208
She was really something.

450
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,750
Every day she goes to a different place.

451
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,750
Great!

452
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,666
Let's go... let's run away.

453
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:55,833
No more sniffing, no more bothering strangers...

454
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,833
A place where you can eat, shit, run and have plenty of sex.

455
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:10,666
Every day I'd get you a new bitch.

456
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,625
If bitches got boring, you could have a dog.

457
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,625
Whatever you like...

458
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:24,291
Darling...look at me...listen...

459
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:28,291
I can't live without you. Tell me...

460
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,458
I love you... I love you.. - I love you, too.

461
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:49,166
You know, darling... I went to Sudha's place.

462
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:57,708
A lovely girl.

463
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:04,625
She looked like 'Hoori'... but that's too Muslim.

464
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:08,625
Or like a 'Devi'... but that's too Hindu.

465
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,666
Lalu...

466
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:24,625
What are you?

467
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:29,125
Hindu or Muslim?

468
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:33,125
Who am I ? I'm not sure.

469
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:44,166
Sudha's father is dead. She loved him very much.

470
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:49,541
Her father was gay. You know what that means?

471
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:53,625
A guy who slept with guys.

472
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:58,083
But Sudha's father slept with his wife too.

473
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:06,458
What are they called? I forget.

474
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:12,083
I told Sudha about her dad. Why hide it?

475
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:16,083
He was a good man. Does that change if he sleeps with a man?

476
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:26,291
Bring a kilo of 'Seemai'...

477
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:36,875
'Lalu are you remembering anyone? Your first love?'

478
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,958
'Here, have another drink.'

479
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,125
Unbeliever!

480
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:47,875
A Muslim can't take alcohol. It's a sin.

481
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:51,875
If you drink, you'll have to leave this place!

482
00:57:57,041 --> 00:58:00,541
Come Lalu... sit darling.

483
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:13,541
Did I tell you I met Ayesha?

484
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:23,791
She was as lovely as ever but... looked sad.

485
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:28,791
Why are so many people sad?

486
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:32,791
She kissed me, here, right on my lips.

487
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:46,375
When you are kissed by someone you love,

488
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:53,625
Time freezes..

489
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:57,625
the sun goes behind the clouds, and you suddenly feel so light!

490
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:10,166
Come everybody.

491
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:22,416
You don't know these things... not love, not pain,

492
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:26,083
not even a kiss.

493
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:30,083
Lalu, has anyone ever kissed you ?

494
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:40,375
Anwar open up. Open the door!

495
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,375
No, I won't.

496
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:53,416
Can't you hear? Anwar..

497
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:57,416
Go inside.

498
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:06,416
What do you think you're doing?

499
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:11,791
You can't take alcohol here,

500
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,666
I'm warning you.

501
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:19,333
Family people live here.

502
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:25,916
In an Arab country, you'd be stoned to death.

503
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:30,708
And you can't keep a dog here.

504
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:37,500
Dog? What dog?

505
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,625
Shut up.

506
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,875
This is only Lalu.

507
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,250
Shut up.

508
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,166
Follow rules or get out.

509
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:58,000
Don't worry, I'll make Lalu a man some day.

510
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,000
We'll throw you out of here.

511
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:20,541
Where is this office?

512
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:35,250
I'm from Kishangunge. My name is Baiju.

513
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,375
I need your help.

514
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:42,375
Come inside.

515
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:46,458
Sit down.

516
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,625
Relax. Tell me...

517
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,625
Can I have some water?

518
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,500
Anything else? -You sit down.

519
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,833
Don't get beaten up.

520
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,291
I left home early this morning.

521
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,208
Tell me.

522
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,458
What are your charges, sir?

523
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,833
Forget about the charges. What's the problem?

524
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:18,833
Anwar... - Sorry sir.

525
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:27,666
One more fish.

526
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:29,625
I'm in a taxi, on the bridge.

527
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:35,250
You sir? - I'm vegetarian.

528
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:41,083
I feel bad that you're treating me.

529
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,541
Eat as much as you like.

530
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:49,458
Do you know the house that your son worked in?

531
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:56,541
Yes sir. For six months I went there to collect his salary.

532
01:02:57,041 --> 01:03:00,458
Last month they told me..

533
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:05,333
he never came back from the vegetable market.

534
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:13,916
I don't know this city but I looked in so many places...

535
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:19,916
I kept sitting in front of that house.

536
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:22,458
The owner saw me but didn't say a word.

537
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:30,250
He walked past me but never said anything.

538
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,458
How old is your son? - Just turned eleven.

539
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,125
You sent such a young child to work?

540
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:42,958
What could I do, sir? I can't even feed myself.

541
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:46,083
The flood destroyed everything.

542
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:49,458
My older son was run over by a truck.

543
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:53,541
So this one had to go to work.

544
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,208
He had enough to eat and he earned some money.

545
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:01,250
Did the owner inform the police?

546
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,958
He said he lodged a complaint.

547
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:06,250
And then?

548
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:12,750
Police said they couldn't find any clues.

549
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,291
Why didn't you go to the police yourself?

550
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:26,208
They told me there can't be two complaints on the same case.

551
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:34,833
They wouldn't listen to me. I tried to ask my son's boss.

552
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,083
I pleaded with the police.

553
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:41,000
No one helped me.

554
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,916
Can you do anything, sir?

555
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,000
But our charges are high.

556
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,083
I paid at your office, sir. Didn't you see?

557
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:55,291
Yes, I saw. Where'd you get all that money from?

558
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:56,750
I sold my land.

559
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,166
Now what'll you live on?

560
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:02,458
I have nothing, but if you find my boy...

561
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:07,791
I can send him some place else.

562
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,083
What if he's not found?

563
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:16,875
Surely he'll be found. God looks after the poor.

564
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:20,875
I need some more rice, sir.

565
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:36,000
I'm Mohammad Anwar, private Investigator.

566
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,750
I want to talk about his boy who worked in your house.

567
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,416
'Namaskar'

568
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,166
Some water, sir.

569
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,416
Bring a glass of water.

570
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:50,875
I've told him all I had to say.

571
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,708
What could I do if his boy didn't return from the market?

572
01:05:55,208 --> 01:06:02,708
The police are searching for him. If found, he'll be returned.

573
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:06,708
Water.

574
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:14,208
I'm busy. I have guests. Go now.

575
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,458
Just one question, sir.

576
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,083
I have nothing more to say.

577
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:22,083
Please go.

578
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:27,416
Hello. Hello. Listen....

579
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:29,833
Come..only you.

580
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:33,833
Please come.

581
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:44,458
I'm Sudesh Kumar. - I'm Anwar...

582
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,958
I know all about it...

583
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:50,833
That fellow is my tenant.

584
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:54,708
He hasn't paid rent for seven months.

585
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:58,125
This month, when I asked for the rent he said...

586
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:02,666
I won't pay. Do what you like.

587
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:07,000
Listen, he's a criminal.

588
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,416
Criminal? - Yes !

589
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:17,666
I'm not sure what it is, but he's involved in something.

590
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:21,666
He gets kids to work in the house and after a while they disappear.

591
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:11,083
'Listen to a song about these evil days...'

592
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:15,083
'Lord Ram obeyed his father and went off into the jungle'

593
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:46,458
'These days where will you get a son like that?'

594
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:50,458
'Listen to a song about these evil days...'

595
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:04,333
What song is that, maestro?

596
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:08,333
Will you teach me?

597
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,208
Where does Khalil Bhai stay? - Why?

598
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:34,458
I need to know. - What the hell for?

599
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:38,458
I told you I need him. - Then go and find him.

600
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:55,250
Rat poison....

601
01:09:55,750 --> 01:10:00,125
Cockroach poison....

602
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:04,125
Bedbug poison.....

603
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,833
Khalil Bhai? - That way.

604
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:33,583
Salam, Khalil Uncle.

605
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:38,875
Salam. Who are you? What's your name?

606
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,791
I'm Mohammad Anwar.

607
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:46,666
Did you pray?

608
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:53,625
As a rule you should say your prayers five times a day.

609
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:59,083
If you don't, it's a sin.

610
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,541
Tell me what you want.

611
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:07,291
You know me, I'm the son of Maqbul of Gopalgunge.

612
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,583
Maqbul? Who Maqbul?

613
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:13,708
Your father-in-law's sister's son.

614
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:19,708
Maqbul? Yes, how is he? How is your mother?

615
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:24,833
They both passed away years ago.

616
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:31,000
Khalil bhai, I need your help.

617
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:43,791
Come inside. You can shut the door if you want.

618
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,958
Sit down.

619
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,583
Tell me.

620
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:54,583
Don't worry, they are trustworthy.

621
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,666
Where are you going? - Leave me.

622
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:09,416
Now...

623
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,750
Iqbal speaking. Khalil Sir? Tell me.

624
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,083
Where are you going?

625
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:29,083
What?

626
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:36,000
I'm coming Sir.

627
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,000
You kindled the fire, you shouldn't have doused it!

628
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,250
Khalil Sir instructed me, so I'm taking you.

629
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:54,500
I'm not into this business. It's bull shit.

630
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,125
But I keep an eye on it. I know who's doing what.

631
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:04,541
I told Shankar I'm bringing an agent.

632
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:09,875
They won't doubt me, but it's still risky.

633
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:15,166
Shankar is dangerous. You keep quiet over there.

634
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:20,625
Don't haggle about prices. I'll do the talking.

635
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,041
OK

636
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,208
What's the boy's name?

637
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,375
Bharat Maity.

638
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,791
Hindu? - Yes, why?

639
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,916
Just asking.

640
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:33,416
If we're lucky we might find him,

641
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:37,416
but they don't keep the kids in one place for long.

642
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,916
'Look into my poisonous eyes... I'm winking at you.'

643
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:58,916
'See my body slither towards you....'

644
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:13,625
'My slim waist, warm breasts....'

645
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,541
'Salam' Shankar. - 'Salam'

646
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:20,541
Come, Anwar.

647
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,000
Don't...

648
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,625
Are you Bharat?

649
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:59,625
Bharat?.... Bharat?....

650
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,791
Hey ! Who the hell are you? What are you doing?

651
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:11,291
What am I doing? What're you doing?

652
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:14,666
How can you do this.... buying and selling children?

653
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:18,958
Who are you? Shakarbhai he is runing...

654
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:22,541
Bring your own wife and kids. Make them dance!

655
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:26,541
Damn it! Are you human beings or a bunch of swine?

656
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:28,208
Don't you have kids?

657
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:29,458
Or are you impotent and don't have erections?

658
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,083
Erections? What erection is he talking about?

659
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:32,375
He's mad!

660
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,000
Bastards! I'll tell the cops and have you jailed!

661
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,000
Damn you ....

662
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:19,458
Hello...

663
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:41,375
It's you? Come, come inside.

664
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:56,291
Sit here.

665
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:06,625
I've been thinking of you...

666
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,708
How are you?

667
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,791
Good. And you?

668
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,583
I'm good too.

669
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:19,875
No, no... you're lying to me.

670
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:26,958
What are all those marks? - It's nothing.

671
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,958
Did you fight with someone? - No.

672
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,666
Keep this. It's a magic ointment.

673
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:55,666
It will make all the pain vanish.

674
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:59,500
Where did you go yesterday? Today?

675
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,458
I've stopped travelling for a few days.

676
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:07,125
I was slightly sick, you know.

677
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:10,916
The day before yesterday I went far away... to Jaunpur,

678
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,833
but I came back quickly.

679
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:16,083
Couldn't stay there..

680
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:17,583
Why?

681
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:27,791
I don't know.... just a little pain in the chest.

682
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:31,083
But you don't worry...

683
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,583
I'll be better soon.

684
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:38,000
And then finally I'll go out...

685
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:44,416
First to my sister in Bilaspur,

686
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:50,416
from there to Guwahati,

687
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:58,458
and from Guwahati...

688
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:03,166
Have you gone anywhere in all these days?

689
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:07,666
Yes, to my grandmother's house.

690
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:13,750
It's a lovely old mansion in a vast empty landscape...

691
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:22,208
surrounded by hills and a few trees.

692
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:27,791
My grandmother had a gramophone with a huge speaker

693
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:32,500
My aunt would play records to make me take a nap.

694
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,958
She danced along with the songs.

695
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,916
It was a treasure-chest.

696
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:46,916
You'd get old coins, key rings and whatnot from it's long, dark tunnel...

697
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:10,791
Have you done your homework? Hurry up.

698
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:29,875
Appu... Appu...

699
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:35,416
Call an ambulance. Give him water. Side please.

700
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:40,875
Appu, come here.

701
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,625
There was blood on his face, Ma.

702
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,708
Keep quiet. You don't need to worry.

703
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:46,833
Why did you run away like that?

704
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:50,625
What if you're late for school?

705
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:54,625
Don't ever do that again.

706
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:02,250
Hello..Hello..

707
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:05,000
Hello?

708
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,541
Why don't you say anything?

709
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,416
Yes, I'm taking Appu to school.

710
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:14,791
Yes, it's late. He had to go to his tutor first...

711
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,041
He's fine.

712
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,833
What number are you calling from?

713
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:25,083
Where is your mobile? It's been switched off for a month.

714
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:27,750
Why are you calling me from different numbers?

715
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,250
They're not Kolkata numbers!

716
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:37,916
What's going on? Where have you been?

717
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:43,583
Do you understand my situation?

718
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:53,458
How long can I go on telling people that you're on an office tour?

719
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:58,041
You're not thinking about anyone else.

720
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:02,041
Not even your own son!

721
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:09,833
You just want to do whatever you like!

722
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:13,833
What a blunder it was to marry you.

723
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:17,166
Yes?

724
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,666
I'm Malini Shukla.

725
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,000
I made an appointment over the phone.

726
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,000
Please sit down. Tell me.

727
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,416
You're Mr. Joshi?

728
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:32,666
Yes... No... Tell me the case.

729
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:34,000
Well, I...

730
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,000
Good morning sir.

731
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:54,166
Yes madam. I'm Dayashankar Joshi, owner of this agency.

732
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,041
What can I do for you?

733
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,625
I'm Malini Shukla.

734
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,666
I saw your newspaper ad and phoned you.

735
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:07,291
Tea or coffee? - No, thank you.

736
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:12,208
How can I help you?

737
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:16,958
I need to find somebody.

738
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:21,333
I'll pay your fee, but you must do the work.

739
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:26,333
It will be done. Inner Eye is a very reputed agency.

740
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:30,333
His father was the last Sherlok Holmes. Trust him.

741
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:38,458
Tell me, what's the problem?

742
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,583
I work in a private company.

743
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:50,958
My husband, Amol Shukla, is an executive in a big firm.

744
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,291
We have a son.

745
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:59,791
Your husband may be a big shot but we're not so small.

746
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,666
We'll find out all about your husband.

747
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:05,958
From the time he goes out untill he returns.

748
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,208
...with pictures.

749
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:12,208
You don't understand.

750
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:18,958
He left home a month ago.

751
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:24,708
He resigned from his office and disappeared

752
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:28,708
Did you inform the police?

753
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:36,750
No. It's too personal.

754
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:50,125
He keeps phoning me. He asks about us... about Appu.

755
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,458
Appu is our son.

756
01:24:52,958 --> 01:25:00,916
Strange! Don't you ask him when he'll return?

757
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:07,000
I do. He doesn't say.

758
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,666
He says he'll return when he feels like it. Then he disconnects.

759
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:17,083
Do you have the numbers he calls you from?

760
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:21,625
There are quite a few. I've tried them...

761
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:25,875
Mostly public booths from different towns

762
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,958
No problem. Don't worry.

763
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:35,375
Give us the list of numbers and we'll do what's needed. OK?

764
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:43,833
I need to know... were you on good terms?

765
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,833
Was everything OK?

766
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:53,458
Is he involved with another woman?

767
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:04,625
I don't know! Maybe...

768
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:07,250
But you have to find that out.

769
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:13,875
Hello. I just got a call from this number...

770
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:18,666
Is the caller there?

771
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,666
A tall, fair gentleman... His name is Amol...

772
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:34,125
What's the location?

773
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,958
OK. Thank you.

774
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:44,041
Taxi!

775
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:48,541
I have to go in search of a strange fellow.

776
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:57,458
He has a wife and son, a good job... but he left home.

777
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:01,208
We have to leave our home, too.

778
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:05,208
You know how that old grouch is troubling us.

779
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:15,375
I worry about you, Lalu. What would you do without me?

780
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:21,083
I had so many plans for you... to train you to be a great dog,

781
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:22,250
to win every dog show.

782
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:26,375
People would come just to look at you.

783
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:30,791
But I couldn't do anything.

784
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,250
Come here. Couldn't do anything.

785
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,416
Don't cry.

786
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:43,208
I love you so much.

787
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,708
You never touched alcohol before.

788
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:49,708
Now sometimes you drink more than me!

789
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:57,000
Let's have a party tonight.

790
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,791
We'll have rum with Coke. What do you think?

791
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:05,791
Good combination, isn't it?

792
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:10,208
I really love you.

793
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:17,375
But you should leave me. My life is such a mess.

794
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,375
I want you to have a better life.

795
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:28,583
Let's go. Rum with Coke?

796
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:39,333
This is a special day.

797
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:43,416
Special food... Special drinks.

798
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:48,000
First the Coke.

799
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:54,458
Drink, Eat it, Lalu.

800
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:58,458
Take it.

801
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:09,458
Cheers, Lalu. Don't be sad.

802
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:24,458
Tell me, what else would you like?

803
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:28,458
Shall I dance for you.... a striptease?

804
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:04,416
See Lalu.

805
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:08,416
See my striptease.

806
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:35,666
Oh my god !

807
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:39,666
Lalu, do you see what I see?

808
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,208
Are you really leaving this place?

809
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:55,166
What?

810
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:58,166
Where are you going?

811
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:03,416
Will you give me your new address?

812
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:08,541
You're a detective. Detectives can do anything!

813
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:13,083
They can shoot with both hands. I've read about it.

814
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:17,083
I read a lot of detective novels. I love them.

815
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:30,000
What's your name? - Nafisa

816
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:36,541
You're an eavesdropper, aren't you?

817
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:41,083
You're a detective, so you know everything.

818
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:45,541
Do you have a pistol? - What?

819
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:53,333
All detectives have a pistol. I've never seen a real gun.

820
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:57,333
Please show me one. Just once.

821
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:15,125
Nafisa.... Where are you?

822
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:16,583
Coming.

823
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:20,583
Nafisa.... Where you goes?

824
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:38,625
'I am risky, soda whiskey'

825
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:41,041
'Who do I belong to?'

826
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:43,458
'Whiskey, whiskey, lovely whiskey'

827
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:47,458
'Drink me straight and feel great!'

828
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:17,291
See grandfather.

829
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,291
Dear, where are you going.

830
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:23,291
Look's good.

831
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:14,583
Genuine? - Yes.

832
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:25,250
Male? - Yes.

833
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:30,041
Age? - Eight and a bit.

834
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:35,125
How much do you want? - 5000.

835
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:39,541
4000. Is that OK? - No bargaining.

836
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,375
But he's an old dog!

837
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:44,833
So what?

838
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:52,958
OK. I'm old too. We'll be good friends....

839
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:56,958
Here, take 5000.

840
01:37:00,125 --> 01:37:03,625
Here. Count it.

841
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:12,166
OK?

842
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:19,000
Come on. Get in.

843
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:33,791
Excuse me, sir.

844
01:37:34,291 --> 01:37:37,791
Do you have a card?

845
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:43,041
Thank you, sir.

846
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:46,333
Sir, do you drink?

847
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:49,166
I mean, do you take alcohol?

848
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:51,791
He drinks, sir.

849
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:55,333
He loves rum.

850
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:57,541
Please give him rum sometimes.

851
01:37:58,041 --> 01:38:00,000
He'll give you good company.

852
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,041
OK sir ?

853
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:06,458
Sir, would you mind if I'd come to see him?

854
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:10,291
Would you allow me?

855
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:14,291
Thank you sir.

856
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:22,666
Listen sir... Keep this money.

857
01:38:23,166 --> 01:38:26,666
Give him a treat on my behalf.

858
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:36,083
Lalu. Lalu.

859
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:43,833
Lalu..

860
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,791
Yes?

861
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:21,041
Where is she ?

862
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:24,833
Who ? Who do you want ?

863
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:28,958
The old lady who lives here. Her son is in Dubai.

864
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:31,000
She lives alone.

865
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:35,208
I don't know any old lady. We just moved in here last week.

866
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:39,208
You can ask the landlord if you want to.

867
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:12,875
Lalu.... Lalu....

868
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:36,708
Lalu....

869
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:41,083
Hey, that's my dog...

870
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:44,708
It's you ?!

871
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:48,708
Lalu, come on.

872
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:55,083
There he goes !

873
01:45:20,166 --> 01:45:20,291
'Anwar?'

874
01:45:20,791 --> 01:45:25,833
Yes, sir. I've just arrived.

875
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:28,791
I'm looking for a lodge.

876
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:31,125
I'll keep you informed, sir.

877
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:32,083
'OK.'

878
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:38,708
But sir, the place is amazing.... out of this world.

879
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,375
There's a peculiar kind of sound.

880
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:42,541
'A peculiar what?'

881
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:46,541
A strange sound... very familiar.

882
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,708
I think...

883
01:45:51,208 --> 01:45:56,791
Sir, when I was a boy,

884
01:45:57,291 --> 01:46:00,958
I used to swim across a river to a wide meadow...

885
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:03,750
'Hello..Hello..'

886
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:10,125
I heard this wind sound there. It brings back those days.

887
01:46:10,625 --> 01:46:11,875
'What are you saying?'

888
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:19,666
Sir, I've always wanted to return to my village...

889
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:26,166
I'm feeling good about this, sir.

890
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:29,166
'Anwar, don't talk nonsense.'

891
01:46:29,666 --> 01:46:31,000
'Finish your job and come back fast.'

892
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:31,875
OK.

893
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:34,916
'Find Amol. - OK sir.'

894
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:36,125
Yes sir, don't worry.

895
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:40,125
'I'll call you again.' - OK sir.

896
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:15,416
Hello. - Hello. 'Why don't you answer?'

897
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:17,250
I didn't hear the phone.

898
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:19,958
'You've got sand in your ears.'

899
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:22,375
Sir...network problem.

900
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:25,958
That's a lie. You're just not answering.

901
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:28,458
Maybe a missed call ?

902
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:32,875
Can't hear you...

903
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:36,916
Now I can hear you, sir.

904
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:39,416
'What's that sound?'

905
01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:43,416
'Anwar.... Anwar... Where are you?'

906
01:47:56,916 --> 01:48:00,416
TAILORS WANTED

907
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:31,416
Brother... Will you hire me?

908
01:48:31,916 --> 01:48:34,375
Have you worked before?

909
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:38,625
Not as a tailor but I can fix buttons.

910
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:40,583
I can learn stitching shirts and pants, too.

911
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:44,583
He's nuts!

912
01:49:36,291 --> 01:49:39,791
Amol....

913
01:49:40,666 --> 01:49:44,166
So Malini has hired a sniffer to search for me?

914
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:54,041
Does she think I have another woman?

915
01:49:54,541 --> 01:50:00,708
No it's not that. She wants you to return.

916
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:05,708
He has a wife and son, a good job... but he left home.

917
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:08,416
It could be something else.

918
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:11,875
Don't you want to go back? I don't know.

919
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:15,083
It doesn't really matter.

920
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:22,250
It would all be the same thing.

921
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,750
Everyone's life is 'same'.

922
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:29,708
My job is to follow people.

923
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:34,166
I've been doing it for ten years.

924
01:50:34,666 --> 01:50:37,375
It could have been different.

925
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:40,375
maybe not.

926
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:44,375
It doesn't really matter.

927
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:53,041
But you've got responsibilities... a wife and a son.

928
01:50:53,541 --> 01:51:01,958
Yes, but what if I don't feel like going back?

929
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:05,958
But your job, your friends and relatives?

930
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,500
I'm fine like this. I don't miss anyone.

931
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:25,250
But Appu, your son....?

932
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:35,791
If I ever do go back, it would only be for him.

933
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:50,833
Are you planning to stay here? No....

934
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:52,541
I might go somewhere else.

935
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:54,875
Where?

936
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:58,875
There're so many places...

937
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:07,458
When I was in college,

938
01:52:07,958 --> 01:52:14,208
I wanted to go to Antarctica. Live in the North Pole,

939
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:18,208
Igloo, stay in an igloo, marry an Eskimo girl and eat fish night and day....

940
01:52:25,208 --> 01:52:26,250
Then...

941
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:30,250
Then somewhere else...

942
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,916
Where're you going?

943
01:52:39,416 --> 01:52:42,916
Nature's call....

944
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:05,208
Lalu...

945
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:42,166
Amol.....

946
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:47,875
Amol.....

947
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:53,291
Amol.....

948
01:54:15,708 --> 01:54:17,000
Lalu...

949
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:21,000
come on.

950
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:42,625
Look at mom and dad.... They died long ago,

951
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:52,750
but even now dad delivers letters and carries mom on his bicycle.

952
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:56,750
Strange!

953
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:44,375
Ayesha ....

954
01:56:49,416 --> 01:56:52,958
Haven't you gone yet?

955
01:56:53,458 --> 01:56:56,875
Do you want something more?

956
01:56:57,375 --> 01:57:00,875
I want to see you.

957
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:13,541
Haven't you ever seen a woman?

958
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:20,208
It was always you, who I wanted to see.

959
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:17,458
Then I will play the record. If you sleep early.

960
02:03:48,541 --> 02:03:57,041
My eyes speak to your eyes...

961
02:03:57,541 --> 02:04:05,875
Your wishes whisper to mine...

962
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:14,833
Let my heart smile. May your heart smile, too.

963
02:04:15,333 --> 02:04:24,125
All these days I had only one world, Now with you I have two.....

964
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:32,291
My eyes speak to your eyes...
