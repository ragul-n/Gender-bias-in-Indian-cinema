1
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,791
After the independence of India...

2
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,791
Those were the days when the independent kingdoms 
were incorporated into Indian union.

3
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,500
The Nizam of Hyderabad opposed this proposal...

4
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:59,833
He sent forth the Razakars to destroy the Hindu provinces, 
temples and wealth to protect his kingdom.

5
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,416
It was under the Nizam’s rule.

6
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:08,333
Kollapur was a province nestling in the deepest 
of the Nallamala forest by the banks of River Krishna.

7
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,375
Raja Balakishan Rao was the king of the province.

8
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,375
Rajaratnam was his minister and confidante...

9
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:19,708
while Narsappa was a jackal eyeing 
the throne.

10
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:26,125
That day the king was in the temple of 
Lord Narasimha.

11
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:31,625
Offered a diety to the Lord with sandal paste 
available only in Nagulakona.

12
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,875
The Razakars attacked the temple at the opportune 
time with the help of Narsapppa.

13
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,416
While they were demolishing the temple…

14
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,833
He went to stop them…

15
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,041
The king lost his life fighting them.

16
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,458
With the entry of the police, 
the Nizam surrendered.

17
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,000
The country was facing the elections for the first time.

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,041
Cunning Narsappa contested as MLA of Kollapur.

19
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,416
Rajaratnam was aware of Narsappa’s evil ways,

20
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:59,208
He convinced Ramachandramma and 
made her contest against Narsappa.

21
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,750
In spite of all the political games played by Narsappa,

22
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,166
we had elected Ramachndramma as our MLA.

23
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,000
She treated the people equal to her son.

24
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,375
‘She built schools and hospitals…

25
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,041
She was an exemplary leader.

26
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,958
Revengeful Narsappa...

27
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:21,166
Found a pawn in Rajaratnam’s 
wayward son, Perumandlu.

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,541
Taking him under his influence,

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,750
Narsappa emptied the treasury with the help of Perumandlu and set fire 
to the royal palace, Rajamahal.

30
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,375
Our hopes and desires turned to ashes along 
with Rajaratnam and Ramachandramma.

31
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,625
Using Perumandlu and violence as weapons,

32
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,500
Narsappa has become an autocratic 
leader of Kollapur.

33
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,416
We don’t own our lands.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,083
We don’t have rights on our food.

35
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,208
We have no rights over our women.

36
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,500
Perumandlu was hand in glove 
with Narsappa for 30 years.

37
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,916
But because of political differences 
he filed his nomination against Narsappa.

38
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,416
Together they had sent quite many to the grave.

39
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,416
Now that they are separated, they are 
turning this town into a grave yard.

40
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,875
This is our village story.

41
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,041
Is there no one to question 
this injustice?

42
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,541
There is one guy, Narsappa’s brother Sekharbabu.

43
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,333
He finished his studies in city recently and returned.

44
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,666
He's our only hope for peace in future.

45
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,791
The 'Draupadi Vastrabaranam' drama by 
Shri Sarada Vijaya Natyamandali will begin shortly..

46
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,333
The third part of drama is about to begin.

47
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,416
It’s about to start…

48
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,208
Let’s go or we won’t find place 
in the front row.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,791
It’s the same old Draupadi and 
the same old disrobement. Sit down.

50
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,708
This topic is good, 
tell me more about it.

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,916

54

62
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,916
It would've been good if he had finished Kauravas.

63
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,916
There won't be 'Kurukskhetra' if he did so.

64
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,875
Krishna's policy is to stand by righteous but not slaying.

65
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,208
Krishna...

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,541

Where did he disappear?

69
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,208
Why are you getting worried?

70
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,708
It wasn't just the toddy shop.

71
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,166
Sekhar babu.

72
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,708
Sekhar babu…

73
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,958

74
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,000

Kollapur MLA Narsappa's brother 
Sekhar Babu was brutally murdered...

78
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,083
Violence between the two communities 
has been growing.

Priest! Who are these people? 
What's happening here?

80
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,500
Narsappa's men are killing 
Permandlu's men.

81
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,291
Police force is trying 
to control the situation

82
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,250
Who must have done that?

83
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,458
MLA must have did it.

84
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,083
Who else? That guy from the east.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,416
Guy from the east?

86
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,833
Perumandlu

87
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,750
Narsappa ignored Perumandlu 
ever since Sekharbabu came here.

88
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,458
Perumandlu got enraged from that moment.

89
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,500
This is a good chance, finished him.

90
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,083
Do you know who killed Sekharbabu?

91
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,083
Ghost? The curse won't be gone unless 
the person who killed her is dead.

92
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,958
Until then these murders won't stop.

93
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,958
Who?

94
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,333
She is the queen Ramachandramma.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,291

97
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,458
No one survived.

98
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,500
You too should escape.

99
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,166
Why should I escape?

100
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,416
This is my place.

101
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,416
I'm ready to face anyone.

102
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,833
These are the consequences 
if you rebel against Narsappa

103
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,708
I've killed your men and now 
I'll sacrifice you to my brother.

104
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,083
Catch him before he escapes 
from the forest.

105
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,125
Damn!

106
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,500
What kind of a place is this?

107
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,250
Are they human or evil?

108
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,625
Oh my god!

109
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,000
Instead of covering the fair 
Why are you bothered about investigation?

110
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,875
I've got used to messing up with 
dangerous things...

111
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,250
I would rather live on stone soup 
than die here now.

someone is gonna kill me for sure.

I am going back to my town. 
I'm leaving for good.

00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,666
- Sekhar Babu! 
- Long live!

177
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,500
- Sekhar Babu! 
- Long live!

178
00:14:51,583 --> 00:15:05,833
- Sekhar Babu! 
- Long live!

179
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,916
God took away the good guy 
 and left the demon.

180
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,750
I was suggested to install my brother’s 
statue in the temple.

181
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:27,125
God confined to four walls doesn’t 
come out to look after his people.

182
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,375
But Sekhar lived for the people.

183
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,916
That’s why I put up his statue here in public.

184
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:47,291
I shall not spare the man who killed him 
whether for power or for spite.

185
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:48,583
Right here.

186
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,875
I shall bury him right here at 
the feet of my brother.

187
00:15:53,083 --> 00:16:01,000
[COMMENTARY ON RADIO]

188
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,458
A police officer was abducted and 
killed by twenty Naxalites six months ago?

189
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,833
I also know those twenty were shot down 
by another police officer.

190
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,041
The government is sending the same 
officer to Kollapur for investigating the murder.

191
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:56,791
Greetings, Sir!

192
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,958
I am Yadagiri, S.I, Sir!

193
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,291
I have heard a lot about your greatness, Sir.

194
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,833
You got a long list of encounter killings, Sir!

195
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,458
I'm very happy to meet you, Sir!

196
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,500
I have done the whole 
preliminary investigation, Sir.

197
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,625
It was confirmed that the bodies 
belonged to Sekhar Babu and his men.

198
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,208
I have ordered for the forensic and 
postmortem reports, Sir.

199
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,708
Did you order tea?

200
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,333
No, Sir.

201
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,083
Hey, where are you going?

202
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,291
- I have to go inside. 
- You cannot.

203
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,708
- Why not? 
- You can't! That's it.

204
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,458
I have some work.

205
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,583
- I want to meet the officer… 
- No way!

206
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,625
Hey, I’ll just take a look.

207
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,125
It will only take a minute.

208
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,083
You are messing with a cop. 
I'll put you behind the bars.

209
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,125
You are too arrogant. Lets see.

210
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,125
Hey! Go away from here!

211
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,583
Tea sir.

212
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,333
Sekhar completed his education 
in town and came back recently, sir.

213
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,875
He has a good reputation in this town.

214
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,250
And he has no enemies.

215
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,500
This was Lord Narasimha’s temple, Sir.

216
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,666
The king of this region had built it.

217
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,541
It was closed down after his demise.

218
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:13,291
Later, a guy called Ranga Rao illegally occupied 
this land and made it his toddy shop.

219
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,666
He disappeared after the murder...

220
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,500
We are searching for him, Sir.

221
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,166
That night, we were all busy at the fair 
controlling the crowd.

222
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,500
We don't know what happened 
in this toddy shop.

223
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,916
This is the crime spot, Sir!

224
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,791
Sekhar was tied to this tree 
and brutally burned to death.

225
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
The whole town suspects Perumandlu, Sir.

226
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,458
He absconded.

227
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,708
From which tree is this toddy extracted from?

228
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:48,958
Sir!

229
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,375
Taste it and tell me.

230
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,541
Nice hairstyle for a police officer.

231
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,166
Sir, that's for a vow.

232
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:06,875
Sir! Kalki, Sir!

233
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:07,833
Kalki sir!

234
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,875
Let’s go. Hurry up.

235
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,000
Wait. Where are you going?

236
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,625
- I have to meet, Sir! 
- What for?

237
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,208
I have to tell him something.

238
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,916
He has no time for gossip.

239
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,333
He is very busy with the case investigation.

240
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,708
I'm not here for gossiping.

241
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,083
I have something important to share. 
Why don’t you let me in for a while?

242
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,625
No!

243
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,333
Just for two minutes.

244
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,333
No!!

245
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:41,583
Stop.

246
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,333
He is very busy with the investigation. 
Don’t disturb him.

247
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,833
I jumped over bigger walls than this 
to meet kaveri aunty in private.

248
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,666
This is a petty guest house wall after all.

249
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,250
So by investigation he meant drinking 
and listening to radio.

250
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,250
That’s a good shot!

251
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,166
That's the way to the safe.

252
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,500
Sir! I'm not a thief, I'm a journalist.

253
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,625
I promise, Sir. My name is Devadatta. 
I work for Navabharat press.

254
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,625
Nice to meet you.

255
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,125
Sir, I need to tell you 
something important.

256
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,541
Sir, food carrier!

257
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,833
- Keep it there. 
- Okay sir.

258
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
You were saying something.

259
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,375
I never understand who works for whom 
in this town, Sir.

260
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,291
Yesterday I almost got killed 
by Perumandlu’s man.

261
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,416
Sir! Sir! I know who killed Sekhar Babu, Sir!

262
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,791
Is it Perumandlu?

263
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,708
Perumandlu is a rouge, Sir. 
I don’t deny it.

264
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,166
But he is not such a fool to kill 
Sekhar Babu to grab his position.

265
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,666
He knows that he gets killed by 
Sekhar’s brother the very next moment.

266
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,041
Then who else would it be?

267
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Sir, the guy who killed Sekhar Babu is

268
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,125
Go. Let's go.

269
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,166
Yes that shot is unexpected 
delivery from the opponent.

270
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,000
Batsman back to pavilion.

271
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,750
He is in shock.

272
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,625
He will wake up in an hour.

273
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,791
Give him some tender coconut water 
as soon as he wakes up.

274
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,208
Who hired this coward for a journalist job?

275
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,875
You take care of him.

276
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:58,625
Okay, Sir!

277
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,583
You got hurt too.

278
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,583
It's miner doctor.

279
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,708
- Nurse, get the TT injection ready. 
- Ok, Sir!

280
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,291
Greetings.

281
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,000
How is he feeling?

282
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,500
He is fine, dear. He is recovering.

283
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,791
All thanks to you.

284
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,250
Not need to thank. He was brought in time.

285
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,375
I should bow to that police officer.

286
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,125
I don’t know where he is from. 
He appeared like a savior on time.

287
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,125
If he hadn't showed up, my grandson 
wouldn’t have survived.

288
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:46,791
What happened?

289
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,541
Are you the one who cleared way 
for the ambulance today morning?

290
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,583
This place is surrounded by jungle.

291
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:57,583
and yet dangers caused by people are more 
than the dangers caused by animals.

292
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,500
Be vigilant.

293
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,708
We get terrified to make a sound 
when Narsappa was around.

294
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,541
He confronted Narsappa.

295
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,708
Look there. That's him.

296
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,458
Greetings, Sir!

297
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:25,916
Tell me.

298
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,541
My grandson survived because of you.

299
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,125
How is he now?

300
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,666
He is recovering, Sir!

301
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,625
God bless you with a long life!

302
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,333
Lord!

303
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,541
Take your daughter-in-law.

304
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,000
BHALI

305
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,916
He is supposed to guard me...

306
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,541
Instead he showed attitude towards me... 
What about him?

307
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,208
I sent Yadi in the morning regarding this.

308
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,541
I told him to leave a warning but 
he dropped a bomb instead.

309
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,666
That police guy ran away in fear.

310
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,291
I'm Kalki IPS!

311
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,791
You have come to investigate 
Sekhar Babu’s case.

312
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:43,416
Starting from Palamuru to Nallamala, people come to me 
for help to solve their problems.

313
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,250
I solve others’ problems. 
Don't you think I can handle my own?

314
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,458
The victim is my younger brother.

315
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,583
I haven’t yet offered his oblations 
to the crows.

316
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,708
I will offer them to the vultures which 
will come for the body of his murderer.

317
00:26:59,208 --> 00:26:59,708
Go.

318
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:04,000
Have some toddy and sleep tight.

319
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,500
Go.

320
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,041
Well said. Well said.

321
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,708
Are you always so wise?

322
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,166
I have advised my higher officials 
the same.

323
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,958
I told them you can solve 
your own problems.

324
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,208
They didn’t listen and sent me here.

325
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,583
Person like you should offer 
a tiger for sacrifice.

326
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,958
why a petty sheep?

327
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,000
Hey! Get going.

328
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,916
I thought I would miss the world cup 
matches.

329
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,958
As you’re willing to do my work…

330
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,916
Let me go and enjoy.

331
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,291
This is election time.

332
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,791
Situations are nothing like 
before, Narsappa.

333
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,000
You know that there is a new party 
 for competition this time.

334
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,416
If you don't stop all these riots... 
I should answer my higher officials...

335
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,166
I can't be open to them about our agreement.

336
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,458
Give it a thought. Okay?

337
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:12,958
Hey, boy!

338
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,000
There is no one here.

339
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,625
Has someone come for me?

340
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:35,083
You think you are a Nawab under Nizam 
and people die to meet you.

341
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,083
- You! 
- Get lost.

342
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,083
Queen Ramachandramma must have become 
a vengeful spirit and killed him.

343
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,000
Holy crap!

344
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,916
Damn it!

345
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,833
Why are you bothered where people 
go in the night?

346
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,916
Has he gone to the temple 
to share some offering with you?

347
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,500
That’s an old ruined bungalow.

348
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,041
Snakes, Bats,...

349
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,083
Also ghosts

350
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,083
Who’s there?

351
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,458
Sir, it’s you!

352
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,041
I thought someone else and panicked.

353
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,291
You won't panic if it's me?

354
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,750
Sir, you’re the one meant to remove fear. 
Why will I worry, Sir?

355
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,833
It looks like you are writing 
a book on Kollapur.

356
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,333
Do you know what will happen 
if Narsappa comes to know?

357
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,291
I know, Sir!

358
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,625
I cannot go from here.

359
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,791
But if I stay, I'll end up dead.

360
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,291
You got to save me, Sir.

361
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,708
I’ll help you with the investigation.

362
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,458
You said you knew who killed Sekhar Babu?

363
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,458
Oh!

364
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,958
There was an attempt to 
murder Sekhar Babu,

365
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,208
a few days before his death, Sir.

366
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,875
A direct witness has told me.

367
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,833
During the recent festival celebrations.

368
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,541
Sekhar!

369
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,416
He’s on the tree. Catch him!

370
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,250
He is running away! Catch him!

371
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,916
Hey Anji!

372
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,791
Hey! Take him to the doctor.

373
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:18,958
Stop it!

374
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,833
Are you going to kill him?

375
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,791
Life is valuable, whether it’s mine or his.

376
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,541
Yadagiri...

377
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,083
Long live, Sekhar Babu!

378
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,458
Long live, Sekhar Babu!

379
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:38,125
Long live, Sekhar Babu!

380
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:42,125
Later that guy escaped from the cops.

381
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,583
But how come none of this was on record?

382
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,250
Even S.I Yadagiri hasn’t mentioned anything.

383
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,625
This town is full of Narsappa’s men.

384
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,625
You will not find a loyal person.

385
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:56,958
I found him.

386
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,958
Come to the government guest house early morning.

387
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:01,833
Let us begin the enquiry.

388
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,625
Sir!!

389
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,958
How did he entered my locked room?

390
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,250
Lock the doors.

391
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,875
But before that, latch it.

392
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,833
This place looks weird...

393
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,500
Is he practicing medicine or black magic?

394
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,958
Sir, once people come here 
they will die without a disease.

395
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,375
Had you sniffed at this flower little longer,

396
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,916
you would have been dead.

397
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,500
Why do you keep such plants out then?

398
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,875
Shouldn’t you be careful?

399
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,791
This is not money to hide it, Sir!

400
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:10,500
This is medicine.

401
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,166
I have a cure for all ailments.

402
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,916
Ask me without any inhibition.

403
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,166
Give this guy some extract 
to get rid of his cowardice.

404
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,708
Tell him the reason we are here, Sir!

405
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,208
He is making an x-ray with his eyes.

406
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,625
They had brought a man for treatment 
on the day of festival.

407
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,083
He's asking about Sekhar's guy.

408
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,958
Do you mean the guy with 
the poisonous arrow?

409
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,000
Poison?

410
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,916
It was the poison from the most 
dangerous white cobra.

411
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,875
It’s like a death sentence.

412
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,708
You will die just by touching the poison.

413
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,625
Where do we find it?

414
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,708
You will find it only in Nagulakona.

415
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,458
Nagulakona!

416
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,125
It was a small hamlet of thirty families.

417
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,875
It turned to ashes in a wild fire.

418
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:32,958
It started at night.

419
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,333
We don’t know how many people survived…

420
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,791
Parents, kids, old people all of them 
died in their sleep.

421
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,708
Can people sleep so soundly 
on empty stomachs?

422
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,791
That is how wild fire is, Sir.

423
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,375
Even a small spark can burn down 
a whole forest.

424
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,791
Dry soil aggravates the fire.

435
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,875
My shirt had a stain.

436
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,500
You could have wiped it off.

437
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:51,958
Why did you jump into the river?

438
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,958
I feel like a lost child in a fair.

You don't understand how worried I'm.

442
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,500
To save you, I held a snake instead of rope.

443

I'm lucky the snake didn't bite me.

444

It’s a second release.

Are these townsmen so talented?

00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,333
There was a story between 
Sekhar Babu and a Muslim girl.

Girl? Which girl?

464

00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,458

That lawyer’s daughter Asima

Father and daughter left town 
on the day after Sekhar Babu died.

00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,791
She did her double PG from Osmania.

530
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,416
She had a passion to do something 
for the town.

531
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,916
That is when she got this idea...

532
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:56,041
River Krishna reaches Srisailam crossing 
the Nallamala forest from Kollapur.

533
00:45:56,458 --> 00:46:05,375
My daughter felt a boating company here... 
It will turn this place into a tourist spot.

534
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,958
We asked you to stop at Madarsa.

535
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:09,125
But you sent her to the city.

536
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:12,500
Now look at her. 
She talks about boats and business.

537
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,916
I would stop her 
if she had selfish motives.

538
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,458
But this is for social welfare…

539
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,708
This is not good Mr. Lawyer.

540
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,333
No good will come out of going 
against religion.

541
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,208
Don’t involve religion in this.

542
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,333
I have read the Quran.

543
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,333
Keep quiet.

544
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,083
Brother.

545
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,041
what’s wrong in her thinking?

546
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,875
Tourism will develop in Kollapur and 
a lot of people will find livelihood.

547
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,708
The town will prosper.

548
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:40,500
The lawyer is right...

549
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,291
- Let's see. 
- Forget about the girl...

550
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,708
He did a lot of welfare for our society...

551
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,250
- If he is insisting... 
- Let's do it.

552
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:53,291
An idea from a woman’s mind is no good.

553
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,500
Drop dead then.

554
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,583
Who is that arrogant fellow?

555
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,000
Sekhar Babu!

556
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,416
Probably a birth from a woman 
is no good either, Salim uncle.

557
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:24,291
So kill yourself.

558
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,625
Our way of life has changed with time.

559
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:30,125
If we go brandishing swords on horses 
because our forefathers were invaders,

560
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,625
the police will break the bones 
and throw us in jail.

561
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:32,708
Sekhar Babu...

562
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,583
It is something related to their religion.

563
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,416
This is related to humanity.

564
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,083
You better stay in your limits.

565
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,583
Are you defining my limits?

566
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,208
Just try and understand.

567
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,583
Those who object now will follow you 
once it’s prosper.

Begin your company work.

569
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,916
Ask me for any sort of help.

570
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,458
I will see who will stop you.

571
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,041
Three boats carrying sixty people...

572
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,541
Started from Kollapur to Srisailam.

573
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,833
What happened, Sir?

574
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,166
Those boats never reached Srisailam

575
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,583
nor did they return to Kollapur.

576
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,041
My daughter had a good thought...

577
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,458
The incident took toll on religions...

578
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,333
That’s why we left the town.

579
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,500
You say three boats had sunk.

580
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,583
One boat is an accident

581
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:23,541
but three boats spell a scheme.

582
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:28,291
I advise you for your own good.

583
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,625
It is better you forget this matter 
and leave the town.

584
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:37,583
I suspect Sekhar Babu was killed 
because he tried to find out the truth.

585
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,291
Why didn’t you file a case 
in spite of being a lawyer?

586
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,625
I couldn’t find proper proofs.

587
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,250
The only witness refused 
to come to the court.

588
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:48,791
Who is the witness?

589
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,583
Samba Shivam!

590
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,583
You cannot bring him to the witness stand.

591
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,958
They have left.

592
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,666
On the auspicious occasion of Dussehra...

593
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:05,291
If you give ghaf leaves to elders 
and seek their blessings...

594
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,250
It is as effective as having 
sought God's blessings.

595
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:15,708
Sir, the officer is investigating 
inspite of your warning...

596
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,625
He met the lawyer...

597
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,375
He is asking information about 
the drowned boats

598
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,708
There is the bird. See it.

People are hunting us like pigs 
because we our with Permandlu.

Even a stone hearted man will show mercy 
when offered a mimosa.

Consider me you were Vibhishana 
and spare me.

607
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,708

00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,375
He told us so much... 
But yet he didn't tell where she is.

611
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,416
She was at home.

612
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,166
Is it?

613
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:56,750
She’s not here.

614
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:00,375
Do you think she killed him?

615
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,833
You should've beat 
the truth out of her.

616
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:08,416
Outside the toddy shop... 
There were pieces of broken bottles.

617
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,750
Some of the glass 
pieces had blood stains.

618
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:14,750
Forensics stated the blood 
stains belong to someone else.

619
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,625
You think the lawyer killed him?

620
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,833
The lawyer looks like cruel guy...

621
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,583
We're yet to discover who 
these blood stains belong to.

622
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,791
Then there is something wrong sir...

623
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,791
Sekhar helped them to organize 
boating company.

instead of a journalist.

01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:03,916
Kalki, what are you doing?

708
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:05,500
He is a Chinese Ambassador.

709
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,541
If something happens to him 
during the treatment,

710
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,583
there will be a war between 
the two countries.

711
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,041
Boys, guns down.

712
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,375
If you don’t let her save him,

713
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,125
I will kill him myself

714
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,125
Please start the treatment.

715
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,458
He is out of danger.

716
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:18,958
Indian doctor.

717
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:41,666
"He is the response to my request”

718
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:47,416
“He is the greatest gift of my life”

719
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:53,333
“Pace decelerates and a race begins”

720
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:59,291
“Someone like a shadow walking with me”

721
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:28,416
“I fell in love with someone mysterious”

722
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:34,458
“We became one in no time”

723
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:38,291
“This acquaintance”

724
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:44,333
“Creates a disturbance in my heart”

725
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:51,666
“He is the response to my request”

726
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:57,166
“He is the greatest gift of my life”

727
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:03,291
“Known…the juggler is known”

728
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:09,166
“Pace decelerates and a race begins”

729
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,250
“The flamboyant shower”

730
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,333
“Pursues me to unite”

731
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,291
“Never stop this pace”

732
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:21,000
“Let the race begin in the clouds”

733
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:24,166
“He and I…We are two!”

734
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,916
“Our hearts don’t like parting ways”

735
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:29,916
“We just got acquainted”

736
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,916
“You consider me your better half already”

737
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:38,250
"He is the response to my request”

738
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:44,291
“He is the greatest gift of my life”

739
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:48,625
After some months... 
My deputation period was done...

740
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,625
I was posted in Vikarabad.

741
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,791
I was about to tell her the same thing...

742
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,125
She called me.

743
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,250
Hello.

744
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,666
I'm going back home.

745
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,208
Please talk to my father.

746
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,791
You were so close in Kashmir.

747
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,416
Why are you distant here?

748
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,250
You guys don't talk to each other any more.

749
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,875
Tell me what happened after that, Sir?

750
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,916
After all I am a reporter.

751
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:23,916
I will not leave you until 
I squeeze the whole story from you.

752
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,041
Where does Samba Shivam live?

753
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:37,500
You mean the priest?

754
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,916
He went to Mallellatirdham 
to get water for anointing.

755
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,291
There he comes.

756
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,250
[CHANTING]

757
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,125
Priest...

758
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:09,708
We need to speak to you.

759
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:13,041
We are coming from Kabir Khan.

760
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,291
We need to talk to you about 
the sunken boats.

761
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,666
I have spoken to the right people 
about it.

762
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,750
Whatever will happen will happen.

763
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,291
[CHANTING]

764
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:36,875
“All desires of people are fulfilled 
in great amounts.”

765
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,291
The incantations you chant daily 
teach you

766
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:46,666
that people who reach out to Hanuman 
will certainly be helped.

767
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,333
You worship him every day.

768
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,541
Can’t you do us a small favour?

769
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,875
Sir is a police officer.

770
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,000
Kalki IPS.

771
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,166
Kalki!

772
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,375
The tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu.

773
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:07,125
I set out to Mallellatirdham for holy water 
as usual.

774
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,375
I could hear the chanting of Lord Shiva’s name.

775
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:14,166
That was the first time I saw steamers 
in this area.

776
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:21,500
The three steamers are full of devotees. 
The whole region was filled with fervor.

777
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,958
In the distance from the boats.

778
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:29,375
There were shapes moving in the water 
They looked like crocodiles.

779
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,458
As soon as the steamers approached them,

780
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,875
they sprang from water like whales.

781
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:40,000
Wearing masks six of them attacked 
three steamers.

782
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,625
There was no sound. Not a drop of blood.

783
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:48,000
People who tried to escape...

784
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:54,250
They hunted down every single person, 
killed them drowning them in water.

785
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,833
I had to silently watch the devotees 
getting swept away by water.

786
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,875
If you come to the station

787
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,666
Forgive me!

788
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,125
Mr. Kabir Khan had done a lot 
for our place.

789
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:25,041
I told him because he was feeling 
guilty of a sin he never committed.

790
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,041
I have dedicated my life to Lord Hanuman.

791
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:35,458
Please don’t expect me at the station 
or the court.

792
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,875
Your evidence can bring justice 
to those who lost their lives.

793
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:41,958
Hanuman can only help.

794
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,958
To wage the war.

795
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,291
It’s Rama.

796
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:08,875
Kalki Sir!

797
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:09,875
What happened?

798
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:11,708
Asima!

799
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,666
She is in my station. You can come.

800
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,041
Where is the warrant?

801
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,583
Where is the lady constable?

802
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,541
How dare you hit the lawyer 
for asking this?

803
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,041
How did you arrest my suspects 
without my permission?

804
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:35,041
Narsappa asked me to bring her.

805
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,958
Is this police station or his property?

806
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:47,208
Do this again and I will shoot you 
in an encounter.

807
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:07,291
Move! Your boss is here.

808
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,458
Where is she?

809
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,208
What is your business with her?

810
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,458
Mr. Kalki!

811
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:40,708
I have already cautioned you 
not to interfere in our affairs.

812
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:44,208
You are not here for sunken boats 
or razed huts.

813
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,625
You are here to capture 
my brother’s murderer.

814
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,958
If you are not capable, give up right now.

815
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,708
It’s her people who killed my brother.

816
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,375
Bring her to me.

817
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,000
It’s me who has to declare the murderer.

818
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,375
Bali!

819
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:06,458
How will you blame Asima a culprit 
without any evidence?

820
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,416
Is it to protect the actual murderer?

821
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:33,458
You accused Perumandlu and 
he disappeared

822
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:36,083
Why? so that there is no opposition?

823
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,833
You reached the crime scene as soon as 
the police arrived that night

824
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,500
as if you already knew about it.

825
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:50,416
Sekhar Babu was becoming 
more popular than you.

826
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:56,625
So did you kill him and now putting 
up a show, Narsappa?

827
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,750
I advised you in kind words, 
but you ignored it.

828
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:06,083
I sent men. But you never changed.

829
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,583
No more of your childish acts.

830
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,500
I will swallow you like a tiger 
swallows a chicken.

831
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,125
Well said! Well said!

832
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:18,750
Swallowing, drowning, torching

833
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,791
will never take place in Kollapur.

834
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,083
Your time is up.

835
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,916
Thank God! My work is done.

836
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,833
So, I’ll pack my things and leave 
if you drop me at the hotel, sir.

837
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:31,666
Sir! Tell me your opinion 
about the headline.

838
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,166
Elder brother murdered his younger brother 
for authority!

839
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:37,250
Headline is good but who is the brother?

840
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:39,541
Narsappa, sir! You said earlier, right?

841
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,250
Did you witness the murder?

842
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,708
No. How would I know?

843
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:43,833
I too don’t know.

844
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:45,875
Why did you give warning to 
Narsappa earlier, sir?

845
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:50,416
We need evidence to arrest someone 
but not to warn.

846
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:51,916
Why did Narsappa leave without 
saying anything?

847
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:54,000
It means that he is hiding something.

848
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:55,833
My bad!

849
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:59,041
I already thought how come I leave 
this place soon.

850
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:01,708
But, one thing is true.

851
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:06,916
Your warning was frightful.

852
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,541
But, there’s one issue.

853
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:09,791
What’s that?

854
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:12,583
Padma madam saw you from behind 
when Asima hugged you.

855
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:14,083
Did Padma see?

856
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,458
Sir! This murder mystery 
is not getting solved.

857
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:19,041
Tell the story happened between 
you and madam, sir.

858
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:20,666
Please sir.

859
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:53,666
We shouldn't wait anymore.

860
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,416
We must kill the cop.

861
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,791
Cops are politician's pet...

862
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:14,041
There is no point in killing them.

863
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,041
Our country is democracy for namesake.

864
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,458
But a place full of thieves.

865
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:30,416
We don't need to show mercy 
on these dogs.

866
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,833
All your men are dead.

867
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:25,458
Only you are left.

868
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:26,833
Surrender.

869
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,000
I'll shoot if you come closer.

870
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,000
No.

871
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,875
He is not a moaist.

872
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,125
He is school's headmaster. 
Moaist sympathizer

873
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:40,000
How can you shelter fanatics where 
Gandhi and Tagore are destined to be created?

874
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:45,000
Gandhi cannot destroy 
this feudalistic system.

875
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,583
We need people like Bose, Bhagat Singh.

876
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:50,083
No philosophy that wields a gun 
can reach its goal.

877
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:51,333
Why are you holding a gun then?

878
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,666
My weapon is for protecting democracy.

879
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:57,583
My weapon is to punish the government 
for looting people.

880
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:47,000
Calm down... 
Please don't cry.

881
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:02,750
Padma.

882
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:38,583
I didn't do it on purpose... 
It's my duty.

883
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,125
He is my Father.

884
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:43,458
I didn't know that, 
but I can't do anything in that situation.

885
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:45,750
Whatever might be the circumstances.

886
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,125
You killed my father, don't kill me now...

887
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,083
Go away!

888
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,083
I feel very sorry for you...

889
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,958
But I didn't commit any mistake.

890
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,708
"Put a halt to your loaded vehicle"

891
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:40,500
"Switch off the engine on heat"

892
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,083
"This road is my den"

893
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,541
"Have a beverage and chill"

894
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:50,166
"I've got toddy for you to get high"

895
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:55,541
"Why don't you give this 
beauty some attention?"

896
01:21:56,125 --> 01:22:00,041
"O' man, driving the lorry"

897
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:05,458
"O' man, make me go crazy"

898
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:09,083
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

899
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,708
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

900
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,375
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

901
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:17,208
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

902
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,750
“Shall I get your country chicken?”

903
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,708
“Will you taste my lips?”

904
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,250
“Shall I cook lamb curry?"

905
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,916
“Will I satisfy your heart’s desire?”

906
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:53,041
“I draped myself in sexy red, 
You don’t that drink anymore”

907
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:58,291
“With the silkiness of my cheeks 
You’ll feel inebriated”

908
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:03,708
"O' man, driving the lorry"

909
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:07,541
"O' man, make me go crazy"

910
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,791
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

911
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:14,375
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

912
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,875
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

913
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,541
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

914
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,916
“One impression here”

915
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,791
“Another impression there”

916
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,958
“Your intoxicated slumber is charged”

917
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,958
“It’s unlike when you are sober”

918
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:06,125
"Like this seekh kebab 
Enjoy the essence of my beauty”

919
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:11,166
“My tender cheeks… 
…Are nicely primed for you”

920
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,916
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

921
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:19,541
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

922
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,125
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

923
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,791
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

924
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:27,375
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

925
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:29,958
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

926
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,625
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

927
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:35,458
"Horn! Pom-Pom! 
Ok! Please!"

928
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,083
People listen to a sad song 
when they have a breakup.

929
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,958
It is a fun song in your case.

930
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,500
What happened? 
Why isn't the vehicle starting?

931
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:04,125
It never happens like this.

932
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,000
Sir, sir...

933
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,708
- Let's get out of this place... 
- What happened?

934
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:21,708
What's wrong?

935
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:25,583
Sir, there is a ghost in that bangalow 
that's why the jeep broke down.

936
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:26,666
Ghost?

937
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,333
I never saw one.

938
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:29,875
Let's go see.

939
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,833
Stop mocking me sir... 
let's get out of this place.

940
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:38,833
Who is he?

941
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:41,791
He is my hotel owner, sir.

942
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,000
He's been roaming at nights 
from the past one week.

943
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:47,541
Where is he going at this hour?

944
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,500
Let’s go and check.

945
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,083
I cannot see anyone, sir.

946
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:52,666
There’s no one here.

947
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,250
There is no one here, right?

948
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:10,333
We've heard stories about one-eyed monsters 
in our childhood...

949
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:12,416
I guess he is the same guy.

950
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,166
Sir, this is Kollapur King's palace

951
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,083
The Queen was brutally 
burned to death here.

952
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:28,458
Her spirit has been haunting 
the palace ever since.

953
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,416
I witnessed it a few times. 
Let's go back, sir.

954
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,750
Listen to me, sir.

955
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,416
Sir, you don’t get it. 
It was on to me.

956
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,750
It is very big.

957
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,166
Ghost….Ghost!

958
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:30,791
I told you that there’s a ghost here, sir.

959
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:32,333
No, sir. Let's go. Come.

960
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:34,291
Please sir, let’s go! No sir.

961
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,166
He is the hotel owner.

962
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:50,666
Who is this guy?

963
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:51,583
Ranga Rao!

964
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:53,375
He is the owner of toddy winery 
that was burnt.

965
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,666
I saw him while escaping from there 
that day.

966
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,083
Why did you kill Mr. Sekharbabu?

967
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,750
I didn't kill Mr. Sekharbabu.

968
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:06,958
I went to watch drama that day.

969
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:08,541
You can ask him if you want.

970
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,000
I don’t know him.

971
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,541
I just met him when I came to pee.

972
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:15,375
You are bringing him lunch everyday 
without even knowing him?

973
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:21,000
Sir will use hands only once.

974
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:22,666
He gives salvation later on.

975
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:23,625
Sir…

976
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,791
I love money

977
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:27,875
but I am not that bad 
to take someone’s life.

978
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:28,958
Believe me.

979
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,541
This is what happened that day.

980
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:41,000
Hey, Ranga.

981
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:42,833
Sir.

982
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:43,958
Coming.

983
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,208
Sir.

984
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:47,083
Ranga…

985
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,791
Your shop have the real festival celebration.

986
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,166
There’s nothing like that, sir.

987
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,000
Okay. My friends came from the city. 
Clear the place.

988
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:57,583
Normal day would be fine...

989
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,583
Today is a fest, sir. So, there’s demand.

990
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:02,583
Take it. It's a diamond watch.

991
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:05,791
Take my diamond watch to compensate.

992
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:07,916
I will get it vacated, sir.

993
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:10,250
Hey! Stop drinking everyone.

994
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,166
The store is closed for the day. Leave…

995
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,250
Leave.

996
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,583
When it is found that Sekhar babu 
died in my store..

997
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:20,791
Narsappa will kill me first

998
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:24,125
So, I disguised myself in a saree 
and hiding here.

999
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:25,916
I swear on my Goddess!

1000
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:27,625
I know nothing more than this.

1001
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:29,916
Did you find anyone suspicious that day?

1002
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,541
Anyone with knives or kerosene?

1003
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:36,250
You would anyway ask that question next. 
So, I asked.

1004
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,041
As it was a fair.

1005
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:42,041
Many outsiders will come. How can I say?

1006
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:49,375
Sir…

1007
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:50,458
What shall we do with them, sir?

1008
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:51,583
You tell me...

1009
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,666
It’s alright sir, let them go.

1010
01:29:54,958 --> 01:30:00,041
Sir! You remind me of 
our king Balkishan Rao sir.

1011
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:03,416
If felt the same thing...

1012
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
Even if they are feeling the same, 
it might be true.

1013
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,708
I should have a sword in my hands, 
But I have a pen.

1014
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:14,666
Datta!

1015
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,000
Datta… 
Sir !

1016
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:23,416
Sambasivam!

1017
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,083
Alias Raja Ratnam.

1018
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:45,291
Did you come for the priest again?

1019
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:46,166
Yes. Where is he?

1020
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,666
There! He’s going to Mallela coast.

1021
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,166
I usually pick him and drop him 
once everyday.

1022
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,125
Now he has been going thrice these days

1023
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:32,916
Why is he going the other way...

1024
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:34,583
Keep following him.

1025
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:29,083
Sir! Sambasiva has something in his bag.

1026
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:31,208
Carrier.

1027
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:33,166
Carrier? For whom?

1028
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:34,208
Guess.

1029
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:55,041
There is someone in the hut.

1030
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,333
Who did Sambasiva hide in this jungle?

1031
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,791
I said whatever I knew.

1032
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,416
I don’t know anything more than that.

1033
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:30,583
You know better than anyone here. 
Mr. Raja Ratnam!

1034
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:33,625
Kollapur Royal Institute Advisor...

1035
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:39,625
Whom did you hide in there?

1036
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:41,916
I'm talking to you!

1037
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:43,833
Is it queen Chandramma?

1038
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:44,916
Perumandlu!

1039
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:15,458
Perumandlu

1040
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:17,958
You've followed so far...

1041
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:19,000
Don't.

1042
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,500
You stay silent. You know nothing.

1043
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:22,708
He is a cop.

1044
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:23,916
It doesn’t matter to me if he is a cop.

1045
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,458
Perumandlu

1046
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:40,458
You should come to the station for 
helping Perumandlu the accused.

1047
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:47,458
Did you try to hide your son and 
escape him from punishment?

1048
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:55,166
I failed as a servant when 
I couldn't save the Queen.

1049
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,166
Watching my own son set 
the Palace on fire...

1050
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,125
I was dead as a father.

1051
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,291
I couldn't save anyone 
from the Royal lineage.

1052
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:08,833
Narasappa is the reason behind this.

1053
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:13,875
I hope my son realizes 
his treason and changes.

1054
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,166
It's a small hope.

1055
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,791
So you decided to save a 
culprit from punishment.

1056
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:22,333
I might save him from punishment 
but not from karma.

1057
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:06,000
Permandlu

1058
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:28,000
Priest!

1059
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:34,333
Priest!

1060
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:37,166
Nothing is a coincidence…

1061
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,125
It’s…

1062
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:44,916
It all happened according to karma…

1063
01:38:57,125 --> 01:39:03,375
“Hero, legendary hero… Spiteful star”

1064
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:06,333
“Courageous, Determined…"

1065
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:10,250
"Celestial conqueror”

1066
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:30,333
“Hey! Your fist is a thunder…Tenacious-like”

1067
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:34,958
“Hey! Timid creature. The most terrifying”

1068
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,875
“Impede your wickedness”

1069
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:38,375
“This is your battle”

1070
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:47,041
“You’re the axe that slays opponent”

1071
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:52,083
“You’d be the destructive creature 
for invading enemy”

1072
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:55,750
“Making it understandable by denial”

1073
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,291
“Let your roaring hunt begin”

1074
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,083
“Keep chasing like a wildfire”

1075
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:02,583
“The hero of sage’s daughter, 
You’re the champion in a tussle”

1076
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:04,791
“You’re multitude of Indra”

1077
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,666
“Your blood is dribbled everywhere, 
It's like a surging wave”

1078
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:11,958
“Your greatest weapon is your anger”

1079
01:40:18,916 --> 01:40:24,750
“Hey! Your fist is a thunder… 
Tenacious-like”

1080
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:27,958
“Hey! Timid creature”

1081
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,791
“The most terrifying”

1082
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:32,958
“Impede your wickedness, 
This is your battle”

1083
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,375
I am unwell, sir.

1084
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:10,666
I’ll come to you in couple of days.

1085
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:15,666
Sir!

1086
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:22,041
He went into the forest... 
So I sent our men to kill him...

1087
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,416
It's dusk. None of our men have returned...

1088
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:30,083
Is he a monster to kill so many men.

1089
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:31,958
He's a government servent.

1090
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:35,250
Bloody fools! You guys can't kill him...

1091
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:39,000
He'll be dead in my hands. 
I will kill him.

1092
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:47,291
What's with those masked men?

1093
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:49,166
What's with all the stabbing?

1094
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:51,875
What's with some man in exile?

1095
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,625
Forget that. Why did you bring 
Perumandlu home for a drink?

1096
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:57,833
He's a murderer.

1097
01:42:58,291 --> 01:43:00,583
He has committed many crimes 
in company with Narsappa.

1098
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:03,750
How could you believe he will 
testify against Narsappa?

1099
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:05,708
He is a very vicious and cruel person, Sir.

1100
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:07,250
You're taking a huge risk.

1101
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:13,333
To hell with risks.

1102
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:17,000
Awards and rewards are 
a consequence of risks.

1103
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,625
Who do you think killed Sekhar?

1104
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:21,166
Is it the archer?

1105
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:22,750
Is it Asima?

1106
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:24,666
Is it Perumandlu?

1107
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:28,125
I won't spare him.

1108
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:31,833
Vent your anger on Narsappa.

1109
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:32,541
Not here.

1110
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:37,000
What did Raja Ratnam 
tell you before dying?

1111
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:45,083
My dad was helpless and he would 
attribute everything to Karma.

1112
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:47,458
He’s dead now.

1113
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:50,166
Narsappa has made a fool of me.

1114
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:51,875
He betrayed me

1115
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,833
Why would he sit idle when you 
killed his baby brother?

1116
01:43:55,125 --> 01:43:58,791
Do you think so much commotion 
is required to kill Sekharbabu?

1117
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:01,958
Narsappa’s motive was to reduce 
my popularity in Kollapur.

1118
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:05,000
That’s why he turned a lie into truth.

1119
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:08,791
I even defied my father for him 
and looted the treasury.

1120
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,208
I set fire to the royal palace.

1121
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:13,583
I stood between him and death 
for thirty years.

1122
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,750
Yet he pushed me aside.

1123
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,000
That’s why I joined the new party.

1124
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:26,500
I used to wonder why he was tolerating when 
Sekhar was obstructing our usual business.

1125
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:28,375
I understand now.

1126
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
He wanted two birds at one shot.

1127
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:34,291
He got rid of his brother and 
framed me for the murder.

1128
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,333
I will not rest until I see his blood.

1129
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:39,250
[SNORING]

1130
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:50,750
You won't sleep until the revenge is taken.

1131
01:44:50,833 --> 01:44:53,250
You ate well and slept snoring.

1132
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,333
You are shameless.

1133
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,916
What is this, sir?

1134
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:50,625
New people enter the scene as if 
it is a archeological excavation.

1135
01:45:50,666 --> 01:45:52,000
Who are you, man?

1136
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:53,916
Why don’t you speak? What do you want?

1137
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,250
Vengeance!

1138
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:57,458
Oh! Do you want vengeance?

1139
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:58,583
How much?

1140
01:45:58,791 --> 01:45:59,916
Is little fine?

1141
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:01,541
You should get kicked!

1142
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:02,250
Hush!

1143
01:46:02,791 --> 01:46:04,333
Why did you plan to kill Mr. Sekharbabu?

1144
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:05,791
Sekhar babu?

1145
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:11,333
You’ve been following us from the time 
we came to that burnt hamlet.

1146
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:18,000
There is good chance for dry land 
to catch wildfire.

1147
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:20,291
But, there is no dry land near the hamlet.

1148
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:24,458
Houses were burnt and nothing happened 
to the trees around.

1149
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:26,083
It is true that the hamlet is burnt.

1150
01:46:26,458 --> 01:46:29,041
But, wildfire is not the reason. 
Tell me, what happened?

1151
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:31,791
They killed, sir.

1152
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:37,083
My mom and brother they killed everyone.

1153
01:46:52,916 --> 01:46:56,000
Let her go! Let my mother go!

1154
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:04,958
They don’t have the fate to live, sir.

1155
01:48:05,916 --> 01:48:07,791
I decided to kill him before I die.

1156
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:10,000
He should know my pain before he dies.

1157
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:12,083
So, I decided to kill his brother.

1158
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:14,083
Why did they slaughter an entire village?

1159
01:48:14,416 --> 01:48:15,166
I know.

1160
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:18,000
I will help you get justice.

1161
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:19,583
- Pattabhi! 
- Sir.

1162
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:22,500
Make arrangements for Suri to stay tonight.

1163
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,375
Okay, sir.

1164
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:33,166
Sir…

1165
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:34,625
Perumandlu!

1166
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:38,541
He ran away.

1167
01:48:39,458 --> 01:48:40,375
What shall we do now, sir?

1168
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,333
Simple! We should get a new glass.

1169
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:46,625
We can get another window but 
not Perumandlu who escaped from it.

1170
01:48:47,458 --> 01:48:48,333
Pattabhi!

1171
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:51,333
- Search entire Kollapur... 
- Yes sir.

1172
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,916
Especially Perumandlu accomplices’ houses. 
- Okay sir.

1173
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:56,083
- Arrange surveillance near Narsappa house. 
- Okay sir.

1174
01:48:56,166 --> 01:48:57,916
Perumandlu might attack Narsappa.

1175
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:00,375
We should arrest him before the attack.

1176
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:02,625
How will you capture Narsappa 
without Perumandlu?

1177
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,458
Your charioteer!

1178
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:06,916
Charioteer?

1179
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:18,916
Find out how he is doing.

1180
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:20,125
Why don’t you ask, sir?

1181
01:49:21,125 --> 01:49:22,000
Yeah! I can ask him too.

1182
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:23,083
How is he, madam?

1183
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,750
Why? Will you beat him again?

1184
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:27,416
Ask her to answer, Datta!

1185
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:29,416
Right foot is fractured.

1186
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:31,125
There’s a sharp cut near abdomen.

1187
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,375
Neck ligament has a sprain.

1188
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,458
Bruises and swellings in multiple places!

1189
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:36,333
There could be concussion 
due to head injury.

1190
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:37,750
How is the thumb finger?

1191
01:49:39,791 --> 01:49:40,375
What?

1192
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:41,625
How is the thumb finger?

1193
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:45,833
Imprint your thumb.

1194
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:50,791
I, Ranga…

1195
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:54,833
I purposefully attacked Kalki 
who’s the officer in duty.

1196
01:49:54,833 --> 01:49:58,916
I agree that Kollapur MLA Narsappa 
propelled me to do so

1197
01:49:58,916 --> 01:50:00,416
and submit this testimony.

1198
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:05,500
Hey.

1199
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:07,250
Ranga! Don’t be hasty.

1200
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,041
Give me those papers.

1201
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:16,250
Okay…

1202
01:50:53,583 --> 01:50:55,458
Datta! Find out if he has a daughter.

1203
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:57,416
If so, let’s go and ask for forgiveness.

1204
01:50:57,958 --> 01:51:01,958
She might think that we intentionally did it 
without knowing the truth.

1205
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:17,916
What is his physical condition?

1206
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:18,833
He is dead, sir.

1207
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,166
I will not ask how he is dead 
because I know you.

1208
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,916
But, Narsappa is ruling party MLA.

1209
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:27,000
This evidence won’t be sufficient 
to arrest him.

1210
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:31,250
A deadly fire!

1211
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:33,333
More than hundred people were burnt alive.

1212
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:36,125
We have live evidence, sir.

1213
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:43,083
The Nagulakona incident, 
it is not a wildfire.

1214
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:44,208
It is a planned attack.

1215
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:46,166
Suri is a witness.

1216
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:50,000
Narsappa, Perumandlu killed our people 
and burnt the hamlet, sir.

1217
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:51,000
Not just this.

1218
01:51:51,166 --> 01:51:55,750
They also killed 50 people by drowning 
boats going from Kohlapur to Srisailam

1219
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:57,916
Why did they do this?

1220
01:51:58,791 --> 01:51:59,583
Smuggling!

1221
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,333
In Kollapur not just animals 
and human beings...

1222
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,291
There is no protection for the forest.

1223
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:08,083
The moment I realized forest fire 
was not the culprit in Nagulakona,

1224
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:10,291
I examined the surroundings...

1225
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:14,166
I found all my answers in the river 
flowing by.

1226
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:18,916
There is only one reason for the boats to sink 
and the village to burn.

1227
01:52:19,291 --> 01:52:21,833
The sandalwood available in Nallamala forest.

1228
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:24,250
They burnt the hamlet down 
as they were an obstruction.

1229
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:26,291
Since there are no checks on the river,

1230
01:52:26,416 --> 01:52:28,125
they chose the river for transporting the logs.

1231
01:52:28,291 --> 01:52:34,708
They feared Asima’s boating company 
would attract crowd and affect the smuggling.

1232
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:36,166
So they sank the boats.

1233
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:40,166
I suspect Sekhar Babu was killed 
in an attempt to investigate this.

1234
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:43,083
This case will only close 
after Narsappa's arrest.

1235
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:45,291
I have evidence for all of it, sir.

1236
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,000
It is not easy to arrest Narsappa.

1237
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:48,416
The village is under his control.

1238
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,416
Give me permission

1239
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:51,833
Narsappa will be locked up by morning.

1240
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:05,291
Hey.

1241
01:54:05,625 --> 01:54:06,458
Hey.

1242
01:54:07,166 --> 01:54:08,166
Get up!

1243
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:11,291
Get up!

1244
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:13,666
You ate well and slept like lazy bugs.

1245
01:54:17,166 --> 01:54:18,416
Fatso! Wake up!

1246
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:22,416
Are you guys dead?

1247
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:23,958
Useless fellows!

1248
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:25,250
Get up!

1249
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:26,500
Get up!

1250
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:30,250
Bali, What happened to you?

1251
01:54:30,666 --> 01:54:31,500
Bali.

1252
01:54:52,958 --> 01:54:53,708
Shall we go?

1253
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:59,000
You're still alive only because 
I spared you.

1254
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:01,666
You blamed me for my brother's murder...

1255
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:03,625
You made a fool out of me 
in my own place.

1256
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:05,875
What you said the other day is true...

1257
01:55:06,083 --> 01:55:10,000
I should be sacrificing you. 
Not a lamb or tiger.

1258
01:55:13,416 --> 01:55:15,166
Well said...

1259
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,583
It's my turn now.

1260
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
I saw your weakness first...

1261
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:40,625
That is why I put this dove 
at your place.

1262
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:52,583
That day only I said to calm down… ! 
Did u listen?

1263
01:55:53,125 --> 01:55:54,750
You tried to kill me...

1264
01:55:54,833 --> 01:55:58,250
But it's not so easy to kill me.

1265
01:55:58,583 --> 01:56:00,083
I'm Kalki.

1266
01:56:02,125 --> 01:56:06,208
You thought I drank and slept 
after listening to you?

1267
01:56:06,666 --> 01:56:08,666
I was planning to trap you.

1268
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,583
We'll cross Kollapur before sunrise.

1269
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:14,500
Your time is up!

1270
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:22,083
Hey!

1271
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:24,291
You guys still didn't eat?

1272
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:27,458
We don't eat after getting drunk.

1273
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:30,041
if you don’t eat after booze.

1274
01:56:31,416 --> 01:56:32,666
You’ll puke

1275
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,500
What is that? Bloody idiot!

1276
01:56:39,583 --> 01:56:40,500
What are you doing?

1277
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:42,041
I'm going to pee, will you come along?

1278
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,083
It is not even morning yet. 
Why will they graze the sheep?

1279
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:06,916
Sir...

1280
01:58:08,416 --> 01:58:09,916
Something is fishy.

1281
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:16,666
Narsappa.

1282
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:18,208
Come.

1283
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Move. Move.

1284
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:31,333
Move!

1285
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:41,791
If you want to get me out of Kollapur 
before sunrise,

1286
01:58:43,291 --> 01:58:48,583
you should know history of Kollapur 
as well as me in total.

1287
01:59:34,625 --> 01:59:38,416
Two leaders Narsappa and Perumandlu 
were dead in Kollapur firing.

1288
01:59:38,916 --> 01:59:40,916
Investigating officer 
Kalki is found injured.

1289
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:44,875
Asima stands as a single candidate. 
Kohlapur will have good days ahead.

1290
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:47,333
You need to rest for two weeks.

1291
01:59:47,791 --> 01:59:49,041
Bring these medicines.

1292
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,750
Good.

1293
01:59:57,625 --> 01:59:58,375
Excuse me.

1294
01:59:59,458 --> 02:00:00,416
How is he feeling now?

1295
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:02,291
He is in too much pain, madam.

1296
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:04,208
But, he will be fine as you 
are here now. Come.

1297
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:08,750
Come, madam.

1298
02:00:11,958 --> 02:00:12,708
What happened, madam?

1299
02:00:13,625 --> 02:00:16,250
I misunderstood him all these days.

1300
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:20,833
I don’t know how to face him now.

1301
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:23,958
It is quite common for human beings 
to do mistakes.

1302
02:00:24,083 --> 02:00:25,375
Why do you think so much to get closer?

1303
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:26,500
You should think when you have to depart.

1304
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:28,666
Sir loves you a lot.

1305
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,791
He dreams about you in sleep.

1306
02:00:32,958 --> 02:00:34,041
Come madam...

1307
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:36,833
Please drink some more.

1308
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:52,666
Madam.

1309
02:00:58,791 --> 02:00:59,291
Padma…

1310
02:01:02,083 --> 02:01:05,750
Don’t misunderstand our relation.

1311
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:09,416
I believe in what I see.

1312
02:01:09,958 --> 02:01:10,916
Please wait.

1313
02:01:12,083 --> 02:01:13,750
I should share something 
important with you.

1314
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:18,166
I haven’t shared it with my dad…

1315
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:22,416
I have to tell you.

1316
02:01:23,333 --> 02:01:28,375
I came to know that someone 
sank my boats on purpose

1317
02:01:29,083 --> 02:01:31,958
I went in search of Mr. Sekharbabu 
after hearing the news.

1318
02:01:41,833 --> 02:01:42,750
Asima!

1319
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,333
What are you doing here?

1320
02:01:46,666 --> 02:01:49,333
My friends came for the fest. 
I am hosting a party.

1321
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:53,083
The boats didn't sink by accident...

1322
02:01:54,083 --> 02:01:55,125
Someone intentionally sunk them.

1323
02:01:56,333 --> 02:01:57,916
Whatever happened that day 
wasn’t a tragedy.

1324
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,291
They intentionally killed everyone.

1325
02:02:01,625 --> 02:02:03,083
A man who witnessed told me everything.

1326
02:02:03,125 --> 02:02:04,166
Who is he?

1327
02:02:12,916 --> 02:02:13,833
Don't worry...

1328
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:16,333
What is your plan now?

1329
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,083
I will approach the court. 
I need your help.

1330
02:02:20,166 --> 02:02:21,166
See, Asima...

1331
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,083
You’re saying that the boats were sunk.

1332
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:25,708
You might risk your life 
if you go against them.

1333
02:02:25,916 --> 02:02:27,250
60 people are dead.

1334
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:29,500
The one who did it must be punished.

1335
02:02:30,458 --> 02:02:31,083
Okay.

1336
02:02:31,416 --> 02:02:32,500
Tell me who that is.

1337
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:34,791
I’ll bring him safely to the court.

1338
02:02:35,166 --> 02:02:36,416
He is afraid.

1339
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:38,958
I will convince him and bring him.

1340
02:02:39,166 --> 02:02:40,416
I will not spare them.

1341
02:02:40,625 --> 02:02:42,541
They should be sentenced to death.

1342
02:02:42,666 --> 02:02:45,291
They were disguised. 
Whom will you lodge the case on?

1343
02:02:48,125 --> 02:02:51,208
How do you know that they’re disguised?

1344
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:05,500
My father will be searching for me. 
I am leaving.

1345
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,083
Take care, Asima.

1346
02:03:17,083 --> 02:03:20,083
It happens when you don’t 
take your steps carefully.

1347
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:23,333
My father might be searching for me.

1348
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,916
Tell me who that witness is.

1349
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:27,958
Perumandlu.

1350
02:03:31,833 --> 02:03:35,625
The one who said who did it must also 
say who made them do it.

1351
02:03:50,083 --> 02:03:52,125
He is a faithful person, Asima.

1352
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:54,666
But, he doesn’t do things 
in the right manner.

1353
02:03:55,166 --> 02:03:57,833
I asked him to burn the houses 
but he spared someone there.

1354
02:03:58,291 --> 02:03:59,583
He tried to kill me.

1355
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:06,833
He left one person alive 
when I sent him to drown the boats.

1356
02:04:09,333 --> 02:04:13,750
I will become the bad guy 
if I spare him today, Asima.

1357
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:08,125
Why did you cheat?

1358
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:10,458
Someone else will arrange 
the boats if not you.

1359
02:05:10,791 --> 02:05:13,875
No one will dare to arrange 
if they get drowned on the first day.

1360
02:05:15,166 --> 02:05:16,583
That is why I pushed you to do it

1361
02:05:18,083 --> 02:05:19,500
and got them drowned.

1362
02:05:22,666 --> 02:05:24,750
You are much worse than your brother.

1363
02:05:24,958 --> 02:05:26,750
Why are you comparing me with him?

1364
02:05:27,291 --> 02:05:29,416
Strength fears people.

1365
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,541
Anyone who fears will be meek 
until his fear is gone.

1366
02:05:32,916 --> 02:05:35,333
But, a faithful person will stay 
by your side forever.

1367
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:37,041
Tell me who witnessed it

1368
02:05:37,625 --> 02:05:38,750
and I will spare you.

1369
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,083
I will never reveal his identity 
even if my life is at risk.

1370
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:51,458
Leave me!

1371
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:54,333
Your corpse will be found in this temple 
tomorrow morning.

1372
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:59,166
The cops will shiver looking 
at your burnt body.

1373
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:14,500
The cops will take your burnt body 
to the hospital.

1374
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:16,916
The doctors will test 
you and say two things.

1375
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:19,791
First is that 8 people raped you.

1376
02:06:21,083 --> 02:06:21,916
Second...

1377
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,125
It will be about the injuries on your body.

1378
02:06:37,625 --> 02:06:39,125
Sekhar babu…Please.

1379
02:06:41,333 --> 02:06:44,416
They’ll find out in the morning that 
it is Muslim girl Asima’s body.

1380
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:50,083
People think that Asima is the one who took 
lives of 50 Hindus.

1381
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:53,958
They must’ve killed her to take revenge.

1382
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:56,958
This would be the gossip in the village.

1383
02:06:57,416 --> 02:06:59,000
There will be violence between 
the communities...

1384
02:06:59,416 --> 02:07:01,000
The village will turn into a graveyard.

1385
02:07:01,833 --> 02:07:03,750
I will come after some of them dead.

1386
02:07:04,625 --> 02:07:05,666
I will apply bandage.

1387
02:07:06,291 --> 02:07:08,833
People will treat me as deity.

1388
02:07:19,458 --> 02:07:20,708
Leave me!

1389
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:23,375
- Hey! 
- Boss!

1390
02:07:23,458 --> 02:07:24,625
Leave me!

1391
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:30,500
Sekhar babu, please leave me!

1392
02:07:35,291 --> 02:07:37,208
Sekhar babu please!

1393
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,500
Oh God!

1394
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:53,208
In order to save my reputation...

1395
02:10:53,916 --> 02:10:55,750
Kalki didn’t tell this matter to anyone.

1396
02:10:57,666 --> 02:10:59,500
We are not like Radha-Krishna!

1397
02:11:00,458 --> 02:11:02,125
We’re like Draupadi-Krishna!

1398
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:13,458
- Where is the phone? 
- I don’t know.

1399
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,083
I should make a call to Hyderabad. 
Where is the phone?

1400
02:11:16,166 --> 02:11:17,166
It is over there.

1401
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,000
SP sir.

1402
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,416
I should tell him.

1403
02:11:28,708 --> 02:11:31,833
I knew you'd do something like 
this when you asked sincerely.

1404
02:11:33,625 --> 02:11:35,083
I was expecting Narasappa

1405
02:11:35,333 --> 02:11:37,250
But you killed Perumadhal

1406
02:11:39,125 --> 02:11:40,458
Very smart move, Kalki.

1407
02:11:45,250 --> 02:11:46,750
Narasappa sent him, right?

1408
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:49,416
I just want to find him.

1409
02:11:49,625 --> 02:11:50,458
Suppose you found him.

1410
02:11:51,416 --> 02:11:52,166
What will you do?

1411
02:11:53,166 --> 02:11:56,083
I'll fire bullets as 
long as I'm content.

1412
02:11:56,416 --> 02:11:59,666
I'll bring Narsappa via Ghat road tomorrow.

1413
02:12:03,541 --> 02:12:04,875
Oh Kalki sir...

1414
02:12:05,416 --> 02:12:06,375
Get well soon.

1415
02:12:10,125 --> 02:12:11,708
This is your plan?

1416
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,250
Hello.

1417
02:12:14,666 --> 02:12:15,416
Hello, sir!

1418
02:12:16,041 --> 02:12:17,083
Can you hear me, sir?

1419
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:20,416
Sir! This is Datta speaking from Kollapur.

1420
02:12:20,583 --> 02:12:22,916
- Hello… 
- Son…

1421
02:12:23,166 --> 02:12:24,708
- Room no. 103… 
- Hey! Go away!

1422
02:12:25,166 --> 02:12:26,541
How is the case progressing?

1423
02:12:27,666 --> 02:12:28,750
Sekharbabu was killed by…

1424
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:30,416
Narsappa, Perumandlu were dead because of…

1425
02:12:30,583 --> 02:12:32,500
Not Suri, Asima or the ghosts, sir.

1426
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:33,708
Who is it?

1427
02:12:34,958 --> 02:12:35,708
Hello.

1428
02:12:37,166 --> 02:12:39,041
Room no. 103

1429
02:12:42,791 --> 02:12:43,541
Hello.

1430
02:12:44,833 --> 02:12:45,833
Hello Datta...

1431
02:12:46,958 --> 02:12:49,083
Who killed Sekhar babu?

1432
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:50,500
Hello?

1433
02:13:00,875 --> 02:13:02,208
Rama Chandramma

1434
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:05,500
- How are you? 
- I'm good.

1435
02:13:05,791 --> 02:13:07,083
Please come.

1436
02:13:17,083 --> 02:13:18,166
How are you?

1437
02:13:18,375 --> 02:13:19,250
I'm good mother.

1438
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:36,916
I couldn't save anyone 
from the Royal lineage.

1439
02:13:46,833 --> 02:13:49,416
You never tell me on which mission 
you are working.

1440
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,916
I didn’t know until Pattabhi called 
that you came to Kollapur.

1441
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:54,458
You never listen to me.

1442
02:14:08,333 --> 02:14:09,666
Mom! What are you looking at?

1443
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:12,750
Did we come here before?

1444
02:14:16,625 --> 02:14:17,291
No!

1445
02:14:17,875 --> 02:14:18,916
Why would we come here?

1446
02:14:20,458 --> 02:14:21,583
We have no purpose.

1447
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:31,500
Did the queen and prince escaped 
the attack on Palace.

1448
02:14:31,958 --> 02:14:34,750
Ramachandramma didn't tell Kalki 
about their past.

1449
02:14:36,291 --> 02:14:40,666
He came to Kollapur 
looking for his love.

1450
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:45,833
He started hunting for the 
culprits involuntarily.

1451
02:14:46,916 --> 02:14:49,291
In the same fire Narsappa 
set to the Royal palace...

1452
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:51,750
Narsappa's brother Sekhar 
Babu burned to death.

1453
02:14:51,875 --> 02:14:56,291
Why did government send him to 
investigative officer to solve the case.

1454
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:09,000
The animals he is bound 
to hunt are in fact human.

1455
02:15:09,208 --> 02:15:12,625
So he crushed and killed them.

1456
02:15:13,291 --> 02:15:16,500
Just like Narsappa destroyed 
Kalki's family using Perumandlu...

1457
02:15:17,291 --> 02:15:20,000
Kalki wrecked Narsappa 
taking advantage of Perumandlu.

1458
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:27,250
Kalki assumes he fulfilled 
his official duty for Kollapur.

1459
02:15:27,583 --> 02:15:30,333
In fact, he fulfilled his 
Royal duties for the people.

1460
02:15:30,791 --> 02:15:33,541
That means, according to the priest...

1461
02:15:33,791 --> 02:15:36,208
This isn’t a coincidence…

1462
02:15:37,208 --> 02:15:39,208
It happened according to karma…

1463
02:16:18,791 --> 02:16:19,916
Come dear.

1464
02:19:18,291 --> 02:19:19,791
Stop it! This is too much.

1465
02:19:19,916 --> 02:19:20,833
Too much?

1466
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,583
Tell everyone about the incident.

1467
02:19:23,791 --> 02:19:24,875
Tell them!

1468
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:26,208
Tell them!

1469
02:19:27,291 --> 02:19:28,041
Sorry, brother.

1470
02:19:28,958 --> 02:19:29,541
Sir...

1471
02:19:29,916 --> 02:19:30,958
What happened?

1472
02:19:31,291 --> 02:19:32,666
Why is he in such frenzy?

1473
02:19:32,958 --> 02:19:34,500
That’s how sincere police officers are, Sir.

1474
02:19:34,583 --> 02:19:35,416
Sir, just a moment.

1475
02:19:35,416 --> 02:19:37,833
Fury will only affect your Blood pressure.

1476
02:19:38,083 --> 02:19:39,500
How will it solve the case?

1477
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:43,000
Sir, you are an experienced officer. 
He is amateur. Spare him, Sir.

1478
02:19:43,958 --> 02:19:44,958
What is the matter?

1479
02:19:45,916 --> 02:19:47,166
Sir, a scientist is dead.

1480
02:19:47,416 --> 02:19:48,500
He is a Nobel Prize winner.

1481
02:19:48,625 --> 02:19:50,333
His body was found in a remote village.

1482
02:19:50,833 --> 02:19:53,083
His death suggests a super human hand.

1483
02:19:53,541 --> 02:19:55,458
But no one is able to solve the mystery, Sir.

1484
02:19:56,208 --> 02:19:56,916
Let’s go then.
