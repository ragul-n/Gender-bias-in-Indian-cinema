1
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,184
Tanjore.

2
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,464
I'll see who's that.

3
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,638
Why don't you come along?

4
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:36,648
I never feel isolated here.

5
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,525
You've just got the Job.
Anyway Chennai is not new to us.

6
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:42,987
Stay at our house.

7
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,025
That house is too big
for me to stay alone.

8
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,479
Where else are you gonna stay?

9
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,713
I'll stay with Nambi.

10
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,058
You've decided not
to listen to me.

11
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:02,261
-Why don't you buy a cellphone?
-If I need, I'll get one.

12
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,709
-Hello.
-It's Nambi.

13
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:07,023
-Yeah - What are you gonna buy?
Buy one for me too.

14
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:10,136
What's your plan?
When are you coming to Chennai?

15
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,248
It's all set, Just have to leave.

16
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:48,052
Life is a game of dice,

17
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:53,141
What keeps you rolling?

18
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:57,424
Desire is a serpent's touch.

19
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:03,215
We live bewildered.

20
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,739
Vetri, Observation class
is happening here.

21
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,229
You observed nothing, right?

22
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,556
Tell me what you observed?

23
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,486
The girl in the front
bench is on her phone.

24
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,328
Someone in the last bench
is having fish curry.

25
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,186
One is sleeping here.

26
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,427
The pen in your pocket is missing.

27
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,307
The 't' in Observation
is left incomplete.

28
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:50,566
-Nice observation, Vetri.
-Thank you sir.

29
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:55,215
It's common for Criminology students to either
select Cyber crime or forensic science.

30
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:58,337
You try for a Detective job,
your observation will help you.

31
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:06,833
-Whom are you looking for?
-I came to meet Govardhanan sir.

32
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:10,218
-So you didn’t come to meet us.
-Not so, even you all sir.

33
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,870
I got an offer, so thought
of meeting him about it.

34
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,022
It's been 3 months since he resigned.

35
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,519
-Why?
-He never discloses his personal thoughts.

36
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,856
This work was never
satisfactory for him.

37
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:29,104
It's his personal decision.
We could do nothing about it.

38
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,210
You were his last batch students,

39
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,475
So he has an emotional
bonding with you all.

40
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:36,692
Why don’t you meet him in person?

41
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,181
-Thank you sir.
-Sit down.

42
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:09,823
It was shocking to know
about your resignation.

43
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,512
I'm getting old and also have
to take care of my mother.

44
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,330
I was waiting for the right time.

45
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,290
Now I'm a consultant,
working on my own time, own pace.

46
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,351
What about you?

47
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,644
-I've got an offer.
-Very good.

48
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,371
Congrats, on your first offer.

49
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:43,996
Being a Detective is no easy job.

50
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,676
It's quite challenging
You got to be like a shadow.

51
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:53,052
The client you work for,
will never know how much you suffer.

52
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,869
-You'll never get recognition.
-Satisfaction at work is enough.

53
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,743
-When are you joining?
-Tomorrow.

54
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:07,344
Radical detective service,
We are a developing organisation.

55
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:13,826
We have customers from various sectors
-Individuals, Insurance, Banking sectors,

56
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:22,143
Apart from these, We would also do a
background checks for brides and grooms.

57
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:32,744
Company finance misuses or fraud
suspect details collection.

58
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:35,393
Collecting details about an individual.

59
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,890
Each Investigation differs.

60
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,339
Our core concentration is
Shadowing and surveillance.

61
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,397
Why are you interested in this job?

62
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,358
I like the challenges in this Job,

63
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,566
Also every moment which gives
me an interesting experience.

64
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,319
Trust is the base of our job.

65
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,681
When we collect personal details,
We would have to break the law.

66
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,111
Those details would turn out
to be vital for our clients.

67
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,820
Clients will believe on what we give
and we have to protect their identity.

68
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:14,494
The details about the
subject should be 100% true.

69
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:19,131
You should never get close to the subject.

70
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:22,444
Sometime you would never
gather any details.

71
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,571
They should never know your Identity.

72
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,213
He'll guide you with
your initial assignments.

73
00:09:44,537 --> 00:09:47,217
What do you think is
important for Shadowing?

74
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,402
Patience is important.

75
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,979
Ram, keep an eye on it.
I'll be back

76
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,270
Sir, you wanted to meet me?

77
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,982
You can place your order
and get it served.

78
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,103
-Sit down.
-It's paining!

79
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,361
How was your day at work?

80
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:18,546
Just joined, got the first
assignment, got to work on it.

81
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,155
What else?

82
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,685
I came all the way to
keep you informed.

83
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,157
We are gonna meet in the room anyway.

84
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:31,112
-You've come up here not just to
inform me, as well get your lunch done.

85
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:32,872
-Don't insult me.

86
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:38,458
Hey CID, have a coffee and go.

87
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,380
-Sir, bill.
-Give that to him.

88
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:44,796
Is he your friend?

89
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,139
-Rs.1,199.
-I didn't know about that.

90
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,389
But he eats well.

91
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:25,368
You aren't a drop in an ocean,

92
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:32,499
But you are an ingenious flame,

93
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:40,318
Each day of life is a war,
conquer it with your power.

94
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:48,731
No one to question your line of sight.

95
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:57,613
No impediments should change your path.

96
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:06,509
When you race over time..
Even the sky is under your feet!

97
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:16,191
You aren't a drop in an ocean,

98
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:24,996
But you are an ingenious flame,

99
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:33,307
Each day of life is a war,
conquer it with your power.

100
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:42,011
No one to question your line of sight.

101
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:50,912
No impediments should change your path.

102
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:59,950
When you race over time..
Even the sky is under your feet!

103
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:18,464
I need Call details, you can you can
get it for any number right?

104
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,454
We can get details of any number
but not VIP numbers.

105
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:26,578
His name is Vimal
I need his details.

106
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:31,843
-I'll call you once it's ready.
-I'll transfer the amount to your account.

107
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:51,962
You are the Shadow of Truth.

108
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:55,827
The budding grains at dawn.

109
00:13:56,287 --> 00:14:00,407
The shining sun is your house.

110
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:04,139
Live the dream every moment to realize it.

111
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,919
Being silent, destroys your identity.

112
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:12,836
Can ever lotus blossom in a land?

113
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,300
Be an ingenious flame.

114
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,695
Look into this for a minute,
I'll be back.

115
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:41,449
How many times have I told you not to
contact me in this number? don’t torture me.

116
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:44,183
I've just got one answer for you,
I can't do it now.

117
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,567
I told then,
But now I can't do it.

118
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,591
Madhavan's native is Thiruthuraipoondi,
he has no properties in Chennai.

119
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:19,751
I think this is your letter,
they delivered it to G1.

120
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,096
Come in.

121
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,519
We just have financial verification left,
very good job Vetri.

122
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:47,149
You should meet our consultant, Vallaba.

123
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:51,499
We were discussing about you yesterday.

124
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:56,852
-I was trying to reach you this weekend?
-Malto.

125
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,374
We've got Kamalakannan's Bank details.

126
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:09,842
We just have to get the audio
source from his house.

127
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:12,725
He has gone out on official work.

128
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,844
-If its urgent..
-Can you do something?

129
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,013
At times like this,
We should never look into their eyes.

130
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,492
If we do, Our face will get
registered in their minds.

131
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,264
Uncle, one minute.

132
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:12,464
What happened?

133
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,627
Where?
There is no one here.

134
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,924
He tried to open this door
and then went that side.

135
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,598
There is no one here.

136
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:31,134
-Did you see?
-I saw him.

137
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,830
Should be a thief.

138
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,269
Vetri, Wake up!

139
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:08,867
It's hard to reach you.
Why don't you have a cell phone?

140
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,964
A cellphone won't suite my job.

141
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:19,183
And I don’t need one.

142
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:24,883
Hey, What happened?

143
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,887
I was monitoring a guy
Kamalakannan for his company.

144
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:33,694
-So, We fixed an audio device in his house.
-Okay

145
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,190
Yesterday, I went to his apartment to bring
the device back knowing no one was there.

146
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,459
-When I was trying to open the lock..
-Did he come?

147
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:45,627
Ok, continue.

148
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:52,187
When I was about to open it,
suddenly a crazy girl came over.

149
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:57,142
She was shocked looking at me,
I left immediately.

150
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,377
She was telling others
that I was a thief.

151
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:08,234
That was on my mind the whole night.

152
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,868
That's how you look
from her perspective.

153
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,270
You were doing what was assigned to you?
This happens in your job.

154
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:20,198
Never repeat anything
against your conscience.

155
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,336
Whether it's Good or bad
you'll get used to it.

156
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:25,936
Think, how else you can handle this.

157
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,853
We'll get the audio device fixed
at Kamalakannan's house in 2 days.

158
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:43,967
Like the earlier projects, do
work in detail for this one too.

159
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,060
-She's?
-Do you know her?

160
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,238
She is Miss. Madhushree, you can find
the address details in the file.

161
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,879
Sadagopan and myself are
going out officially.

162
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:06,024
If you want anything regarding
this project contact my mobile.

163
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:50,997
Who created this sonnet,
just for me.

164
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:58,527
Am I your beginning or a
new verse or the end,

165
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:05,508
Is there a spark when our eyes meet
Is it an answer or a question.

166
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:13,206
I flew as if the world never existed.

167
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,783
What a surprise! You
are home, let's eat.

168
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,281
Whats that you're hiding?

169
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:46,208
-Official information?
-What's a big deal?

170
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:50,004
I did care for your official
papers, when they were scattered.

171
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:55,196
Hey, new project?
For which client?

172
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:59,613
-I don't about that.
-So now you got to roam around girls.

173
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:01,958
Who's that?

174
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,417
She's the one who saw
me the other night.

175
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,466
-Her personality?
-She's good.

176
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,636
I thought she would be different.

177
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:15,828
I thought some day, I could change
the bad impression she has on me.

178
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,463
-I don’t think it would happen.
-Why not?

179
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:25,033
Meet her tomorrow and tell that you are no
thief but a CID, make up something.

180
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,099
I am not supposed to talk or get close
to the subject as per office rules.

181
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:34,699
You are acting as if you work for the RAW.

182
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:37,764
You know, this job is my passion.

183
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,229
The passion is
for your job not with your company right?

184
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:45,476
Will meeting her trigger
an alarm in your office?

185
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:46,766
-Hey,
-Let it go.

186
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,679
You want to talk to her,
Do that first.

187
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,855
Do you say so?

188
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:58,996
What if they know about it?

189
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,532
What's wrong?

190
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:06,188
-It's hard to find a good girl these days.
-That's right.

191
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,429
We have thousands of companies.

192
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,188
You're talking as if I am
in love with that girl.

193
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:16,943
Should I say that,
I can see that in your face itself.

194
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:23,008
-Why does strange things happen to me?
-It does happen for your good.

195
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,690
Go, talk to her.

196
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:51,342
As the snow merges with the rain drops,

197
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:58,380
our eyes mixed with each other.

198
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:15,779
Who is it mom?

199
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,530
Is support from home enough?

200
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:23,475
Madhu, your friend has come to meet you
I've asked him to wait in the hall.

201
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,967
Friend?
I'll talk to you later.

202
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:38,305
Who are you?
What do you want?

203
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,458
I need to talk to you.

204
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,675
-Just 2 minutes.
-No, leave now.

205
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,468
Please, just 2 minutes.

206
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,270
Are you leaving or not.

207
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,939
Madhu, what's it?

208
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:54,609
Just 2 minutes.

209
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,339
I'm Kamalakannan's friend..

210
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:07,726
Actually that night.

211
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:16,165
That night you saw me in
front of my friends flat.

212
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:17,837
He works at Technomark.

213
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:23,436
I didn’t pay the rent for the past 3 months
So he kicked me out.

214
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,789
Now I am staying with another friend, But
my things are at Kamalakannan's apartment.

215
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:29,638
That was when...

216
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:33,788
I didn’t do anything else.

217
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:37,414
Don’t you believe me?

218
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:41,463
I'll find who you are.

219
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:48,641
Vidhya, can you answer me
without any questions?

220
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,346
What happened?

221
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:53,513
Anyone named Kamalakannan who works
at Technomark lives in your apartment?

222
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,014
Yes, there is..

223
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,799
That night you said you saw
someone, that’s the flat.

224
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,341
Does he have a room mate?

225
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:09,483
Yeah, why do you ask?

226
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,988
-How does he look?
-Haven't noticed much.

227
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:18,048
A useless guy.

228
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:24,433
5'11'' height, a lean body with a
short hair cut and a crazy look.

229
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,778
On the whole he's okay.

230
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,882
You haven't noticed much,
yet describe him clearly?

231
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,195
I'll call you later, bye.

232
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:37,157
That night seeing you...

233
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,607
Really sorry for being harsh on you.

234
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,071
It's my mistake.

235
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,505
This is my friend's house
I am a guest here.

236
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:49,684
Seeing you here,
Didn’t know how to react.

237
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,906
You could think why
am I telling this.

238
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,460
That day I saw you getting
scared on seeing me.

239
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,550
I know the first impression
would never change.

240
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,167
Still I wanted to talk about this to you.

241
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,599
I didn’t know a better place,
so I came to your home itself.

242
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,561
You should have courage
to accept your mistakes.

243
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
How was the coffee?

244
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,915
Sorry, forgot about it?

245
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:23,068
Thanks for your time.

246
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:42,217
You should have courage to
accept your mistakes.

247
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:50,492
You're good at narrating stories.

248
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:53,221
I met her just because you said.

249
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:57,016
I didn’t know what to say.

250
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,230
You could tell the truth instead
of thinking to make up a lie.

251
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,702
Next time, do speak with confidence.

252
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:06,543
Let your attitude speak for itself.

253
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:09,911
I'll get a water bottle.

254
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:26,316
Where can I find books related to 18th
century paintings? -It's in the first floor.

255
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:40,499
-Hi.
-What book?

256
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:47,492
I was searching for
books with such content.

257
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,696
Are you interested in Art?

258
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,902
No, but I read all books.

259
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:04,887
Don’t ask me something
specific, I might not know.

260
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:08,672
-Are you from Chennai?
-I studied at Chennai.

261
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,030
After mom's death, my dad settled
in my native. I'm here for my job.

262
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:19,196
I grew up in an orphanage in Bangalore.
Just moved to Chennai for the new job.

263
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:23,541
I'm staying at my friend's place
The place where you came down.

264
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,017
Sorry, did aunty question you?

265
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:29,969
What's the name of the guy who
left without having coffee?

266
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,310
-Sorry, I'm Vetri.
-Madhu.

267
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:40,133
We can't keep walking,
Shall we have coffee?

268
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:58,044
The food tastes great,
Do you come here frequently?

269
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:00,462
-You..
-Call me, Madhu.

270
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,606
Madhu, I am gonna introduce an
important person to you -Who?

271
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,191
He would have told a lot about me.
Don’t believe that.

272
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,963
I was gonna, but you
jumped in just before that.

273
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,067
He's Nambi, my best friend.

274
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,092
The one who cooked
all these dishes.

275
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:18,595
She is Madhu.

276
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:22,188
-How was the food?
-Simply superb!

277
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:26,004
There is nothing much to tell about me.

278
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,980
I know to cook well and that’s it.

279
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:32,323
Next time we'll plan something big.

280
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,015
Sir, one more thing.

281
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,840
Don't forget to pay the bill.

282
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,438
You continue..

283
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,667
His simplicity and the way he
carried himself is impressive.

284
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,193
Do you appreciate even
these small things?

285
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:55,179
Life is very short, So we have
to appreciate small things.

286
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:21,623
I sprouted as a Moon
From the seeds of Stars!

287
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:26,533
I lost myself..
Within the eyes of Beauty!

288
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:30,829
Sway your head..
To the music of the Rain!

289
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,669
Your babbles is a music in the heart..

290
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:40,158
If we unite..
Love will just be about us!

291
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:03,254
I sprouted as a Moon
From the seeds of Stars!

292
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,719
I lost myself..
Within the eyes of Beauty!

293
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:12,274
Sway your head..
To the music of the Rain!

294
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:17,116
Your babbles is a music in the heart..

295
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:21,313
If we unite..
Love will just be about us!

296
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:25,986
I sprouted as a Moon
From the seeds of Stars!

297
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:30,713
I lost myself..
Within the eyes of Beauty!

298
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:34,442
I told dad about you
He said he'll meet you when he comes here.

299
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:54,939
I do cook everyday, your
girl is here so you do it today

300
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,223
-It would be horrible
-I'll tolerate whatever you cook

301
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:08,555
All my unspoken silences..
Are filled by the Language of your eyes!

302
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:13,124
The times that I miss you..
The clock questions me!

303
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:22,964
You reached my heart.. Like the rain
droplets seeped through the sand..

304
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:26,589
You are the first woman of my life..
You are the only one!

305
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:31,441
Within myself..
I accept that..

306
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:36,412
If we unite in Life,
Love will just be about us!

307
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,240
She is short tempered, But will
believe what her loved ones says

308
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,205
Vetri, Professor.

309
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,433
If you are free come home
I need to talk to you.

310
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,448
Surely, when will you be home.

311
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:55,921
Come anytime, I'll be there.

312
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,614
Tell me.

313
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:04,685
He's an important person in my
career, can you come along?

314
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,059
-My friend Prushotaman is here too.
-Oh ok.

315
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:29,504
My mom would be happy seeing you all.

316
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:36,533
As a woman,
My desire for you grew immensely!

317
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:41,278
Every moment I lay my eyes on you,
I become Speechless!

318
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:45,557
Why am I expecting you?

319
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:50,011
I ask myself every day.

320
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:53,949
From now on, we are one!

321
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:59,058
I'll always walk by you.

322
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:03,586
If we unite..
Love will just be about us!

323
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:08,552
I sprouted as a Moon
From the seeds of Stars!

324
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:12,876
I lost myself..
Within the eyes of Beauty!

325
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:17,644
Sway your head..
To the music of the Rain!

326
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:22,685
Your babble is a music in the heart..

327
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,950
If we unite..
Love will just be about us!

328
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:31,116
I sprouted as a Moon
From the seeds of Stars!

329
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:36,489
I lost myself..
Within the eyes of Beauty!

330
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:45,981
Our core concentration is
Shadowing and Surveillance.

331
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,613
You should never get close to the subject.

332
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,851
Why, you don't love her?

333
00:36:00,846 --> 00:36:02,126
Tell everything to Madhu.

334
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,676
Later think about quitting the job.

335
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,015
Have to find the client who is
looking for her detail.

336
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:12,287
That’s next, first talk to her.

337
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,840
Tell about your Job and
how you got to know her.

338
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:22,546
-I'm afraid - First talk to her,
there is nothing to be afraid off.

339
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,538
-Madhu..
-Hmm

340
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:43,122
I want to talk to you
about an important thing.

341
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:44,226
Yeah, tell

342
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:50,326
Not like this, would like spend
some time and get relaxed.

343
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:53,107
Why are you smiling?

344
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:56,184
Tell it now or you
can only tomorrow.

345
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:02,996
Please, It's my friends wedding
reception cant miss it.

346
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,731
We'll go to the parlor..

347
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:12,076
Then show our presence at the function
and we can directly go to the restaurant.

348
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:20,709
It's your friends reception, right?
What have you got at the parlour?

349
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:24,608
I don't want to look gloomy.

350
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,955
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

351
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:32,917
Sir, please wait outside,
She'll come.

352
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:38,677
What happened?

353
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:43,294
-Any problem?
-I feel a bit uneasy.

354
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:47,249
-Shall we go to the doctor?
-I think taking rest will do

355
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:50,778
-Ok lets go.
-You finish this first.

356
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:53,586
Let's go.

357
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,030
You attend the reception and call
Nambi's number, then we'll decide.

358
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:04,527
Ok, you take rest I'll call you.

359
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:56,939
-Sir, This is Vetri.
-What's it Vetri?

360
00:39:56,964 --> 00:40:01,844
-My 2nd assignment, Vimal
an IT professional. - Yeah.

361
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,796
Just got to know his
death from a newspaper.

362
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,220
Is it so? They asked about
his attitude in his company.

363
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,209
We gave all his details to the client.

364
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,552
What's the news, Vetri?
Is it an unnatural death?

365
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:18,652
The newspaper says
it is an accident.

366
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
We'll discuss about
this with the client.

367
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,680
We can't go looking into every case.

368
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,207
What about Madhu's details?

369
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:32,928
Too much of pressure from the client,
When will it get ready?

370
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:36,709
It's ready sir.

371
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,494
You Forward her report to
my mail, I'll follow it.

372
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:01,421
Sir!
Sankaran sir!

373
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,048
Who's that?
Whom do you want?

374
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:14,298
Is there anyone named
Sankaran in this house.

375
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,707
He's dead.

376
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:20,649
-How?
-He fell of from the construction site.

377
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:24,942
-When?
-Hey, are you from the police department?

378
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,814
Hasn't the enquiry finished yet?

379
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:30,214
It's been 4 days
I had an enquiry.

380
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm his friend
Just came to meet him.

381
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,565
It's strange you are his friend,
don't even know he's alive or dead.

382
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:42,053
No one turns up when he is alive.

383
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:44,078
Now he calls himself as his friend.

384
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:24,211
Yesterday evening at work he
fell off from the 7th floor.

385
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:33,475
-He hasn't called me yet.
-Tell him I reached home.

386
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,740
-Tell him to call once he reaches.
-Surely I'll let him know.

387
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:43,386
Professor called 4 times and
Madhu 10 times repeatedly.

388
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:45,198
You've told her you were sick.

389
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:48,463
Cant you call her,
Look, how worried she is.

390
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:50,504
What happened?

391
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:07,484
These were my first assignments
that I collected details off.

392
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,647
Did you talk to someone
from your office?

393
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:16,063
Spoke to Sailesh, he said that their
company asked for the information.

394
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:19,058
He said he'll talk about
this to the client.

395
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:22,043
Companies do collect details, right?

396
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:26,075
There is no reason for their
company to doubt them.

397
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:28,036
Vimal has just got a promotion,

398
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:31,052
It's just been 6 months Sankaran
joined in this construction company.

399
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,016
It's just an accident
Why do you worry?

400
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:39,143
Where he lives, what he does,
and when he leaves from work.

401
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,850
Who his friends are, when he goes
on a long drive, his hobbies.

402
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,050
These were the information
I collected for the client.

403
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:50,419
I've given it all.

404
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:52,748
You say it's a murder.

405
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:56,458
Don’t know for sure!

406
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:00,683
Their back to back
deaths confuses me.

407
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,530
Hope nothing happens to others.

408
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:12,022
I am afraid,
I've taken a wrong path.

409
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:15,976
Nothing like that
Did you go look for others?

410
00:44:17,673 --> 00:44:21,433
Kamalakannan, Madhavan
Both their houses were locked.

411
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:24,058
Madhu?

412
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:26,724
She just spoke to me over the phone.

413
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:30,309
Give me your phone.

414
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:04,454
-Hello Technomark. - Can I speak to
Kamalakannan in Finance department.

415
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:07,799
He's on an official trip to Bangalore.
You are?

416
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:09,464
I'm his friend Vetri.

417
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:11,889
It's urgent
I couldn’t reach his mobile number.

418
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,462
If he calls, tell him to
call me on this number.

419
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:18,039
Name: Vetri

420
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:32,728
Yeah, tell me.

421
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:35,691
-I'm Vetri, I need to meet you.
-Vetri?

422
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:39,684
-I am traveling now.
-It's very important sir.

423
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:42,966
-Ok tell.
-Not on the phone.

424
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:47,336
It's better if we meet in person,
You tell the place, I'll be there.

425
00:45:47,718 --> 00:45:49,998
I am going to Thiruthuraipoondi
for my personal work.

426
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:53,983
-Which place over there?
-There is an agraharam....

427
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:56,888
That won't workout, I'll be back tomorrow,

428
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,591
However important it is,
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

429
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,463
Sir, anyone named Madhavan from chennai.

430
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,787
He's gone to the river bank
for his father's funeral rites.

431
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:42,496
Wait for sometime he'll be back.

432
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,553
Sir!

433
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:10,091
I spoke to you over the phone yesterday.

434
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,726
Sit down,
Let him finish his rites.

435
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,007
Go and dissolve this in the river.

436
00:47:41,802 --> 00:47:42,762
Wait, I'll be back.

437
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:24,196
Don’t keep thinking about it.

438
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:30,807
It happened before my eyes
and I could do nothing.

439
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,607
I am a reason too for his death.

440
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:38,424
Stop saying such things.

441
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:42,425
Did you know this was gonna happen?

442
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:47,917
Let it be your mistake, We'll never get a
solution if you keep talking about that.

443
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,772
Think what to do next.

444
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,875
Did you call your office?

445
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,031
Haven’t spoken to anyone.

446
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,425
How about informing the police?

447
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:07,379
-Nambi, they are looking for you.
-I'll come.

448
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:13,163
We have to do something,
before this happens again.

449
00:51:15,895 --> 00:51:19,135
-Hello I am Kamalakannan.
-One minute.

450
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:23,167
Are you the one trying to reach me?

451
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:25,232
I've been trying to talk
to you for the past 2 days.

452
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:29,737
I wasn’t in town, I got your
message from the receptionist.

453
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:31,162
Don’t talk from your mobile.

454
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:33,241
Just a minute.

455
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:37,697
-Can you call me from an alternate number?
-Why should I?

456
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:39,381
It's very important.

457
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:43,362
-Please.
-Ok tell me.

458
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:54,989
My name is Vetri.

459
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:58,943
-I want to tell you an important thing.
-But you haven’t spoken anything about it.

460
00:51:59,936 --> 00:52:03,096
This is about your life
I have to meet you in person.

461
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:05,584
My life?

462
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:07,266
There are people following you.

463
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,371
Your phone calls are being tapped,
you are in some sort of danger.

464
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:12,011
You don’t worry, I want to
talk to you about that.

465
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:16,772
Hello, Who are you?
You call and blabber nonsense.

466
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,197
Please believe me.

467
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:23,887
I don’t know who you are?
I've got nothing to know from you.

468
00:52:24,336 --> 00:52:27,136
-It's a waste of time.

KamalaKannan Sir!

476
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,084
Vetri, where are you?

477
00:55:36,204 --> 00:55:37,564
Madhu's phone is switched off.

478
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:40,417
You've got my phone.
Did Madhu call you?

479
00:55:42,189 --> 00:55:45,069
Hey what happened?
Did you meet Kamalakannan?

480
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:48,294
Nambi, We've got only Madhu to save.

481
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:50,768
What happened?

482
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:09,003
It's not safe to stay there,
Shift all our things to Nehru Nagar house.

483
00:56:09,314 --> 00:56:11,551
Delete all the details
about Madhu in my laptop.

484
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,336
I'm gonna see Madhu now.

485
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:51,984
-Madhu?
-How do I know?

486
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:55,529
Why aren’t you answering?

487
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,573
Hey, Where were you these 2 days?

488
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:00,684
Why do you look so tired?

489
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:02,933
What happened?

490
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,639
-Who is that?
-Vetri is here, let's get him a coffee.

491
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:16,993
What happened Vetri?

492
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,562
I kept calling Nambi,
Didn’t he tell you?

493
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:29,067
What happened to your phone?
Why is it switched off?

494
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:30,117
No!

495
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,477
I've been trying to
reach it for a while.

496
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:40,055
The battery is dead
I didn’t notice it.

497
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:41,941
Madhu, we are shifting
to our new home.

498
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,552
-Why?
-Dad's coming.

499
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:48,947
Oh! Anything special?

500
00:57:49,578 --> 00:57:51,458
He wants to meet you too.

501
00:57:51,483 --> 00:57:53,683
You have to help us in
setting up the house.

502
00:57:53,757 --> 00:57:56,717
Seems like you've got
plans on your own.

503
00:58:01,704 --> 00:58:03,264
Hi Nambi.

504
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:06,047
Surprising to see you both come separately.

505
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,280
Nambi, is dad coming?

506
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,449
Yes my dad is coming
-Even your dad is coming?

507
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,931
He's joking Madhu.

508
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:21,078
-You spoil sport.
-Hey, how do I know?

509
00:58:21,103 --> 00:58:22,543
Added more sugar for Nambi.

510
00:58:25,187 --> 00:58:30,107
Aunty I got to arrange things
can I pick Madhu tomorrow morning.

511
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:34,212
She's leaving to Vidhya's house
You can drop her when it's all done.

512
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:38,367
Where were you these 2 days? She missed you
a lot, at least you could've made a call.

513
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:45,105
Forget the problems
Looking at all this, you are very gifted.

514
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:51,317
Hey, after arranging things call Vidhya,
She'll pick you up.

515
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:56,993
Aunty, Will give you a
call once I reach there.

516
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:57,801
Okay.

517
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:02,553
Tell Vidhya that we'll
come for the function.

518
00:59:02,683 --> 00:59:04,283
We'll try to make
it tomorrow morning.

519
00:59:06,164 --> 00:59:09,124
-What happened to our car?
-Nambi's arrangements.

520
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:11,831
I'll ask Vidhya to call you.

521
00:59:22,171 --> 00:59:24,171
Play that footage from the beginning.

522
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,920
The name of the person
who died is Kamalakannan.

523
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:33,585
Koovam ring road signal, This is the vehicle
that passes the signal at the time of accident.

524
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,450
-At nights, they do drive rash.
-Looks like a hit and run case.

525
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,553
Enquire with the vehicle
registration number.

526
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:41,086
Try to trace the drivers face.

527
00:59:41,325 --> 00:59:44,805
And track the mobile of the
victim to gather information.

528
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,270
Do call me anytime if
you get any information.

529
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
Let's track the vehicle in other signals.

530
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:06,845
Do you know what you've done?

531
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:11,407
We've been very careful
in all our moves.

532
01:00:13,584 --> 01:00:15,584
Now the police investigation
is in upswing.

533
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:21,130
You shouldn’t have dealt with
Kamalakannan in such a haste.

534
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:23,551
You should've been patient.

535
01:00:24,608 --> 01:00:27,328
Till when?
Till he knows about us.

536
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:33,248
He doesn't have to shout it out,
his whispers are enough.

537
01:00:34,283 --> 01:00:35,563
Don't I know about that?

538
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:38,258
I think over everything thousand times.

539
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:42,364
Instead of thinking it over thousand times,
try doing it once.

540
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:48,078
It's not necessary for a
daring act to be right always.

541
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:50,782
You should learn to be prudent.

542
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:55,017
Hereafter even a small mistake,
we can't answer Vallaba.

543
01:01:14,168 --> 01:01:17,128
You are yet to get a job,
Why do you need such a big house?

544
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:22,689
Look at the questions
she is asking already?

545
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,945
You've got a bright future.

546
01:01:32,854 --> 01:01:34,654
The kitchen is spacious too.

547
01:01:35,856 --> 01:01:38,413
For bachelors this house is big.

548
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:45,304
When is dad coming?

549
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,610
He will come anytime by tomorrow.

550
01:02:05,778 --> 01:02:06,978
Do you think I am lying?

551
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,280
No!

552
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:12,801
Not even a small doubt?

553
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:16,626
When you believe in something,
It'll last till the end.

554
01:02:17,035 --> 01:02:20,315
More than myself,
I believe in you.

555
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:29,165
Sailesh, don’t be in a
haste in Madhu's case.

556
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,866
We've to be defensive
and save ourselves.

557
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:36,971
-Why?
-Listen to me.

558
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:51,777
Go out only if needed.

559
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,722
You get all comforts in here.

560
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:56,527
If Vetri comes looking for us?

561
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:00,533
-Hey, still you don't understand?
-That's what I mean too.

562
01:03:00,784 --> 01:03:03,904
Even before we think to
do something, he thinks ahead.

563
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:07,962
Don't you understand?

564
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:10,898
He'll surely come looking for us.

565
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,277
-Hi
-Hi, when are you coming?

566
01:03:32,302 --> 01:03:34,822
I've got guests here,
I'll pick you up later.

567
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:37,117
Where is Aparna?

568
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:39,483
This is not Aparna's house.

569
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,307
Hey, I'll be back.

570
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:44,572
What happened to Madhu's phone?
She was searching for it..

571
01:03:46,558 --> 01:03:50,998
I left it at Rukmani aunties home
to avoid her from being traced.

572
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,200
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Wait! Why are you going out now?

573
01:03:56,427 --> 01:03:58,147
We should know what's happening outside.

574
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,882
Do you think you can solve all this?

575
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:06,428
How long can you make Madhu stay here?

576
01:04:07,172 --> 01:04:08,812
She'll leave when Vidhya comes.

577
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,030
-What do you want me to do?
-We did nothing wrong.

578
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:14,527
Let's go to the police.

579
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:17,231
Will that solve all this?

580
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,880
You are afraid Madhu will
leave by knowing the truth.

581
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:27,667
Madhu shouldn't get into
trouble because of me.

582
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,577
Hey, I've an important
thing to say.

583
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,809
-Whats it?
-You asked about Kamalakannan that day.

584
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:40,462
Suddenly, he died in a road accident.

585
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:43,647
His room mate Satish, about whom I
was giving information the other day.

586
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,150
He's been taken for the police enquiry.

587
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:49,415
So there are lots of police out here.

588
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,731
Why did you ask about him?
Do you know him?

589
01:04:58,372 --> 01:04:59,132
Nambi!

590
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,436
Vetri, Why have you come
to my house itself?

591
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:10,861
Sorry, I need important information.
Just an emergency.

592
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:12,730
These numbers.

593
01:06:19,316 --> 01:06:22,636
-These are VIP numbers.
-No they are just fancy numbers.

594
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:27,662
I need the address and 3 month statements.

595
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:33,290
Ok, let you know once it's ready.

596
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:50,255
Why are you all silent?

597
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:08,020
Madhu, Is she your friend?
When did she come?

598
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:09,774
Hey, Sit down

599
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:22,498
So you are not Kamalakannan's room mate

600
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:25,103
Nothing you told me was true, right?

601
01:07:32,835 --> 01:07:34,755
Just answer this question.

602
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:39,089
When I first saw you, What were you
doing that night at the apartment?

603
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:44,123
I've got thousand questions.

604
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:47,493
Things happening now is confusing.

605
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,564
Give me some time
I'll tell you everything.

606
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:55,504
Please listen to me,

607
01:07:55,981 --> 01:07:57,981
Staying here is safe for you.

608
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:00,576
Madhu, nothing should happen to you.

609
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:05,102
Nothing more can happen to me,
You have hurt me enough.

610
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:07,451
Do Believe me!

611
01:08:07,992 --> 01:08:09,672
Listen to me, please.

612
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:13,941
Respect my feelings too Vetri.

613
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:24,559
You played your role so aptly.

614
01:08:33,907 --> 01:08:43,627
You are my vision!
What can I see without you!

615
01:08:45,175 --> 01:08:54,935
And so in my every song
You are the First word!

616
01:08:56,069 --> 01:09:06,269
I am you!
And you are me.

617
01:09:07,626 --> 01:09:12,506
Walk with me, my company!

618
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:17,552
You farther from me..

619
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:23,579
Makes my heart heavy!

620
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:29,437
In the corner of my eyes.

621
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:34,928
I see you at times that I most need to!

622
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:50,325
Tell me, Madhu.

623
01:09:51,452 --> 01:09:55,332
What happened?
You both are silent.

624
01:09:57,856 --> 01:09:59,416
Ok let's leave it for now.

625
01:10:03,603 --> 01:10:05,637
Do ensure she is safe here.

626
01:10:05,662 --> 01:10:07,382
This is an army officer's house.

627
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,647
Me and my daughter have been alone
all these days. I'll take care.

628
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:32,169
Hey, what she said haunts me a lot.

629
01:10:41,523 --> 01:10:46,683
The victim Kamalakannan had last spoken
to someone over his cellphone.

630
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,750
He told his colleagues he was
going to meet that person.

631
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,200
The same number is registered
in the office register,

632
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:54,882
While tracing that number.

633
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:59,060
A guy named Nambi has shifted
from that address to this house.

634
01:10:59,508 --> 01:11:00,508
Hey, come here.

635
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:05,199
I work for Easy Go packers and movers.

636
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:06,944
They said they needed to shift urgently.

637
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,722
As they didn’t have much
things we did it in an hour.

638
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:11,729
Are they in this house now?

639
01:11:12,257 --> 01:11:14,977
I don’t know that, but
we delivered it here.

640
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:21,692
He has spoken in the name of Vetri but
the number is owned by Nambi.

641
01:11:38,346 --> 01:11:39,757
Is there anyone named Vetri?

642
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,340
CID, he's inside.

643
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,452
I need to talk to him.

644
01:11:45,455 --> 01:11:47,175
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

645
01:11:49,591 --> 01:11:51,031
Are you his security?

646
01:11:52,704 --> 01:11:53,464
Military!

647
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:56,936
Is Military's name Nambi?

648
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:06,491
There is no vehicle on
that registration number.

649
01:12:07,372 --> 01:12:11,012
I doubt that short fellow..
Let's interrogate him.

650
01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:14,647
It doesn’t look so.

651
01:12:15,784 --> 01:12:18,304
Will he be boozing at home
after committing an accident.

652
01:12:20,244 --> 01:12:22,844
They are drunk, enquire
them in the morning.

653
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,050
Let's see.

654
01:12:33,304 --> 01:12:34,704
Who is Nambi?

655
01:12:35,459 --> 01:12:38,219
That's me sir
-You are the one..

656
01:12:39,674 --> 01:12:42,914
What was the last thing
you spoke to Kamalakannan?

657
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,488
Sir, which Kamalakannan?

658
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,468
He doesn’t know anything..
I am the one who spoke to him.

659
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,299
If you've got any questions,
do ask me?

660
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,539
The Sub-inspector has
asked to bring them both.

661
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:55,247
Both of you come.

662
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:58,352
You could have said
that before he hit me.

663
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,804
-Come sign it
-Sign in this

664
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:23,254
Madhu is outside

665
01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:40,151
Madhu!

666
01:13:42,816 --> 01:13:44,816
Don't convince me with your lies.

667
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:51,027
I shouldn't have kept it for so long.

668
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:53,118
Should have told it earlier.

669
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:56,881
You decide whether it's a truth or a lie.

670
01:13:59,866 --> 01:14:00,386
I love you.

671
01:14:17,977 --> 01:14:20,697
You are the first accused,
So you shouldn't leave the city.

672
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:25,657
-I don’t know who Kamalakannan is..
-The phone is yours right?

673
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:29,458
What is the name of the
inspector who arrested us?

674
01:14:30,043 --> 01:14:31,883
Inspector Raghuram.
Why?

675
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:33,758
Where can we meet him sir?

676
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:46,657
What has brought the military here?

677
01:14:47,777 --> 01:14:49,777
Sir we need your help.

678
01:14:50,338 --> 01:14:54,138
I think you could help us with the
information we have about the case.

679
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:57,371
Why should I believe you?

680
01:14:58,389 --> 01:15:01,989
You can find out if its true or
not in the investigation itself.

681
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:06,566
After completing my course in criminology,
I joined in a detective agency.

682
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:20,166
Where is that office?

683
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:22,441
Now you can't find anyone there.

684
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:24,989
I asked where the office is?

685
01:15:26,107 --> 01:15:28,267
So this is the Detective
agency you were talking about.

686
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:35,685
This side is closed
The entrance is on the other side.

687
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:40,985
The painting is completed
Go inside and see.

688
01:15:43,046 --> 01:15:45,046
Do you know about the
company that was here?

689
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:47,159
They have moved it to some other place.

690
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:49,477
Ask the complex manager.

691
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:53,195
Babu do you know about the
company that was here? - No!

692
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,060
No idea sir,
Ask the manager.

693
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:02,139
Shall we go inside?

694
01:16:02,652 --> 01:16:04,492
We'll get nothing inside Vetri.

695
01:16:05,348 --> 01:16:07,948
This is nothing new for fraud
agency to change places.

696
01:16:08,373 --> 01:16:12,773
In Mumbai and Pune there are more than
100 cases on Fraud detective agencies.

697
01:16:12,798 --> 01:16:16,318
Here there are no license and strict
measures to start a Detective agency.

698
01:16:16,343 --> 01:16:18,663
But few agencies serves us well.

699
01:16:18,946 --> 01:16:20,666
But most of them use it for wrong purpose.

700
01:16:21,162 --> 01:16:24,682
Like Money extortion, Black mailing etc..

701
01:16:25,051 --> 01:16:27,051
But nothing such in this case.

702
01:16:27,572 --> 01:16:30,132
Here there is no camera monitoring.

703
01:16:30,805 --> 01:16:32,325
No parking ledger.

704
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:34,850
No proper evidence about the company.

705
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:39,171
So we have a lot more to
learn in this case.

706
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,990
Sometimes even the small
things we miss out..

707
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:46,397
Could be an important lead for that case.

708
01:16:46,655 --> 01:16:50,215
Very small thing..
Which you may have felt not important.

709
01:16:51,063 --> 01:16:53,063
Which you wouldn't have informed me.

710
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,141
Shall we have tea?

711
01:17:09,223 --> 01:17:11,983
-Have you seen him?
-At times he comes here.

712
01:17:12,056 --> 01:17:14,336
-Where?
-To the company that was here.

713
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,577
Who else would come?

714
01:17:17,643 --> 01:17:19,483
Two of them would come daily.

715
01:17:19,947 --> 01:17:21,947
There is an other person too.

716
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:24,573
I never saw him after he came.

717
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:25,741
Any problem sir?

718
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:29,591
Just wanted to know about those two.

719
01:17:29,867 --> 01:17:31,227
Tell, what you know?

720
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:33,637
They would have told you something.

721
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:36,212
Think!

722
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:41,729
You've to meet our consultant
Mr. Vallaba.

723
01:17:42,044 --> 01:17:43,684
They would have talked
among themselves.

724
01:17:46,253 --> 01:17:49,053
-I was trying to reach you this weekend?
-Malto.

725
01:17:49,926 --> 01:17:50,566
Malto!

726
01:17:50,704 --> 01:17:52,704
-How much for the tea.
-Rs.10

727
01:17:58,346 --> 01:17:59,826
-You can go now.
-Okay sir.

728
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:03,459
We'll know more if we
enquire about this office.

729
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,620
Vetri, get a cellphone for yourself.

730
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:10,157
Think well
If anything comes up, give me a call.

731
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:16,085
Sir I can remember, I was supposed
to meet someone named Vallaba..

732
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,272
But I only know his name
I didn’t meet him.

733
01:18:19,297 --> 01:18:22,177
As the boy said,
He could have come before I joined.

734
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:25,178
But I'm not clear about
the other details.

735
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:28,051
Don’t confuse about the unclear things.

736
01:18:28,435 --> 01:18:29,795
Let's sketch their faces.

737
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:32,958
Matching it with our records,
will fetch us more information.

738
01:18:33,615 --> 01:18:34,935
Meet me tomorrow morning.

739
01:19:29,905 --> 01:19:31,386
-Hello.
-I got a call from this number.

740
01:19:31,419 --> 01:19:32,539
Dilipan this is Vetri.

741
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,884
I couldn’t find any details
for the numbers you gave.

742
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:40,014
Look in for other sources instead
of waiting for me, I'll keep trying.

743
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,379
Heart and the mind never gets along.

744
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:57,652
Heart goes with hope,
Whereas mind relies on facts.

745
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,839
Don't know if Sailesh would come here..

746
01:20:03,392 --> 01:20:06,632
Sometimes we do as our heart says,
which need not be reasoned.

747
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:17,123
Hey!

748
01:22:18,068 --> 01:22:19,108
Who is that?

749
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:24,390
-What's it?
-I saw something flashing inside the car

750
01:22:35,683 --> 01:22:37,803
-Hello
-Sailesh, where are you?

751
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:40,268
-Malto
-I just spoke to Vallaba.

752
01:22:41,413 --> 01:22:43,709
He asks us to be silent for 2 weeks.

753
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:46,854
So be patient, then everything
will fall in place.

754
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:56,960
You listening?

755
01:23:02,443 --> 01:23:05,243
There was something
flashing inside the car.

756
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:07,878
Why are you silent?

757
01:23:08,658 --> 01:23:12,818
Don't know if what you said would
happen, but what I said has happened.

758
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,067
He has come looking for us.

759
01:23:16,444 --> 01:23:20,004
He can do nothing to us,
Destroy the papers first.

760
01:23:33,594 --> 01:23:36,114
Did you list out the
number of cases for today?

761
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:44,204
-Sir, I am vetri
-Whats it'

762
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:45,925
Sailesh's house is in Anna nagar

763
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,414
Where in Anna nagar?

764
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,119
Just a minute.

765
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:58,249
How did you get these details?

766
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:01,339
Wait there, I'll come.

767
01:27:37,994 --> 01:27:39,994
Put the knife down.

768
01:27:42,232 --> 01:27:43,592
Put it down.

769
01:28:10,839 --> 01:28:12,999
-Follow all the formalities.
-Okay sir.

770
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:15,329
Look what happened?

771
01:28:16,123 --> 01:28:17,603
You could have waited for me.

772
01:28:18,162 --> 01:28:20,962
-Sir..
-This case is getting complicated

773
01:28:22,155 --> 01:28:25,115
We can't keep losing without
knowing their motive.

774
01:28:25,997 --> 01:28:27,717
I didn't do anything wrong.

775
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:29,484
Go and have your first aid.

776
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:30,890
Leave now.

777
01:28:31,902 --> 01:28:34,902
Chakrapani, try to avoid press and media.

778
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:37,399
See that no information
gets leaked out.

779
01:28:37,973 --> 01:28:39,973
-I'll talk to the superiors.
-Okay sir.

780
01:28:50,211 --> 01:28:52,211
Who knew it would turn out like this?

781
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:55,294
Before going into his house
I informed Raghuram sir.

782
01:28:57,095 --> 01:28:58,295
You could've waited for him.

783
01:28:58,974 --> 01:29:00,134
Can't you both keep quiet!

784
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:04,872
In a short while Sailesh came there.

785
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:08,090
Okay, We'll discuss later.

786
01:29:09,618 --> 01:29:11,818
He went into a room
as soon as he came in.

787
01:29:14,299 --> 01:29:16,139
I was watching from a nearby room.

788
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:21,811
Why did he go into that room?

789
01:29:24,417 --> 01:29:26,937
He knew I was in the house.

790
01:29:27,264 --> 01:29:30,271
Hey, Keep quiet for a while.

791
01:29:32,143 --> 01:29:37,263
I heard a sound from that room.

792
01:29:41,266 --> 01:29:43,666
Nambi, we should go there.

793
01:29:46,863 --> 01:29:50,063
I can't come home,
Please listen to me

794
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:54,021
Won't your dad go by bus

795
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,300
Do something,
we need to get into the house.

796
01:29:56,408 --> 01:29:58,128
You keep quiet let me handle this.

797
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:13,807
You cut the call,
I'll call you back.

798
01:30:14,919 --> 01:30:18,159
-What's it?
-Just came to get the car back

799
01:30:18,184 --> 01:30:18,904
Go ahead.

800
01:30:19,468 --> 01:30:23,108
You wouldn’t have had dinner
Have some Biriyani sir.

801
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:25,870
You guys care for us.

802
01:30:26,823 --> 01:30:29,623
His purse fell inside
please help us.

803
01:30:30,484 --> 01:30:33,717
Till the forensic report comes
no one should go inside

804
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:39,455
He has his prints all over the house
else you do check for us.

805
01:30:46,046 --> 01:30:48,926
You should come back soon,
go now.

806
01:30:54,175 --> 01:30:57,495
Hey, I didn't mean you.
Would I say so?

807
01:32:53,664 --> 01:32:58,504
Would you like your pre-paid mobile to be
converted to a post-paid connection?

808
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:19,532
It's a policy number

809
01:33:22,653 --> 01:33:24,653
-Policy number?
-Yes

810
01:33:24,678 --> 01:33:25,558
How do you say?

811
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:31,910
9 digits, Health insurance
or accident policy number.

812
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:39,400
As the first 2 letters are PN
it could be a PNGC policy.

813
01:33:40,226 --> 01:33:44,026
And its also has PNGC
water-marked on it.

814
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:54,336
I thought it would be a bank
detail or a locker number.

815
01:33:58,745 --> 01:33:59,905
Why are you silent sir?

816
01:34:01,363 --> 01:34:03,043
I'm informing you everything, ain't it?

817
01:34:03,579 --> 01:34:04,379
What's that?

818
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,500
Crime scene evidence

819
01:34:10,508 --> 01:34:12,268
How did an individual get it?

820
01:34:14,677 --> 01:34:16,397
Do you think you are
acting smart?

821
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:25,100
The confidence to face any questions
without fear is what I like about you

822
01:34:35,786 --> 01:34:37,506
Mr. Madhivaanan?

823
01:34:37,667 --> 01:34:39,827
He got transferred,
I'm in charge now.

824
01:34:40,067 --> 01:34:42,067
An important thing,
can we talk for few minutes?

825
01:34:42,268 --> 01:34:43,508
Wait in my cabin I'll come.

826
01:34:43,723 --> 01:34:45,803
Police department,
It's an enquiry.

827
01:34:45,828 --> 01:34:47,628
Whatever it is, wait I'll come.

828
01:34:47,943 --> 01:34:50,103
-Urgent sir!
-I'm in an urgency too.

829
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:53,151
I have to go and see the manager, Won't
he get angry if I don't meet him?

830
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:57,270
He comes once in a while, don’t know when
he'll come next, allow me to do my job?

831
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:02,567
Go meet him.. I thought only
my job filled with tension.

832
01:35:25,841 --> 01:35:28,321
-My system is slow.
-That's ok.

833
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:35,406
This is an accident insurance policy.

834
01:35:36,284 --> 01:35:40,084
The value of this policy
is 1 crore coverage.

835
01:35:41,006 --> 01:35:43,166
This is insured for a
person named Mr. Kamalakannan.

836
01:35:45,791 --> 01:35:47,551
This was taken 6 months back.

837
01:35:53,675 --> 01:35:57,515
The policy holder is dead, So..

838
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:01,363
The nominee or relatives
will get the cheque from the head office.

839
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:02,948
Once the claim is approved.

840
01:36:05,564 --> 01:36:08,964
Can we find other person's policy
details by their name and date of birth?

841
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:10,919
Let's see.

842
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:17,679
Can you give the details about who took
the policy and the nominee?

843
01:36:26,886 --> 01:36:32,006
I need the last six months
accident death reports immediately.

844
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,905
I'm at PNGC insurance office.

845
01:36:36,282 --> 01:36:40,522
Sir asked for Kamalakannan's
policy details, Do call him.

846
01:36:49,741 --> 01:36:52,021
Fax me all the details
I'll give you the number.

847
01:37:01,397 --> 01:37:03,917
Do collect everything
and send it to me.

848
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,323
Did he say anything else?

849
01:37:09,628 --> 01:37:11,628
Got any details about Sadagopan?

850
01:37:12,724 --> 01:37:14,724
-We have found Sadagopan itself, sir!
-What?

851
01:37:24,616 --> 01:37:27,878
I'm Vetri
I'm here to meet the branch manager.

852
01:37:27,903 --> 01:37:30,663
-Can you inform him that I've come.
-Sure sir, please wait.

853
01:37:35,187 --> 01:37:35,638
Hello.

854
01:37:35,674 --> 01:37:37,443
Sir, person by name Vetri
has come to meet you.

855
01:37:43,853 --> 01:37:48,853
I'm busy, don't let anyone in,
Cancel all my appointments

856
01:38:04,031 --> 01:38:06,631
Hi, I'm Vetri.

857
01:38:11,979 --> 01:38:18,877
-Have I come at a wrong time?
-No! No!

858
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:21,909
I was thinking something else.

859
01:38:24,734 --> 01:38:25,734
I'm Poornachadran.

860
01:38:29,494 --> 01:38:31,774
Sadagopan (a) Pooranachandran.

861
01:38:54,573 --> 01:38:58,093
Madhu, Did you take any insurance
policy in the last 6 months?

862
01:38:58,427 --> 01:39:00,427
Policy?
No!

863
01:39:00,531 --> 01:39:02,051
Accident insurance policy.

864
01:39:03,519 --> 01:39:08,039
Anyone at your office or
in your Bangalore home?

865
01:39:08,343 --> 01:39:12,183
I am sure I've got no insurance policy
Why do you ask now?

866
01:39:13,126 --> 01:39:15,206
Nothing to worry,
will call you back.

867
01:39:21,752 --> 01:39:24,432
All the policy numbers you gave are
accident insurance policies.

868
01:39:24,722 --> 01:39:28,602
All are worth 1 crore, and everything
is claimed except for Madhushree.

869
01:39:29,074 --> 01:39:33,594
One is sanctioned and another is pending.
Like this every one is in different stages.

870
01:39:35,259 --> 01:39:39,139
1 crore.. can he approve such big claims?

871
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:44,094
He can approve up to 1 crore but it has
to be sanctioned by the head office.

872
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:46,079
That's why he has come
down to office today.

873
01:39:46,865 --> 01:39:49,785
Can we take a policy without the
knowledge of the policy holder?

874
01:39:50,091 --> 01:39:53,691
Yes, we can.. there are
lot of loop holes here.

875
01:39:54,956 --> 01:39:57,756
There are certain criteria
for 1 crore policy.

876
01:39:57,912 --> 01:40:01,632
Based on that we would randomly select a
person and take a policy on their name.

877
01:40:01,905 --> 01:40:03,425
Even they wouldn't know about it.

878
01:40:03,981 --> 01:40:06,981
Before the insurance company
pay out a huge claim amount,

879
01:40:07,006 --> 01:40:10,092
They would verify it through
a detective agency.

880
01:40:10,117 --> 01:40:15,397
I and Sailesh set up a
fake Detective agency.

881
01:40:16,157 --> 01:40:20,277
We ensured that the policy
holder never knew about the policy details.

882
01:40:20,471 --> 01:40:24,191
A phone call to the policy holder about
their new policy itself is a big deal.

883
01:40:24,765 --> 01:40:28,085
The manager can stop that easily

884
01:40:30,097 --> 01:40:34,457
All those who have died have no
connections, How do you select them?

885
01:40:38,852 --> 01:40:41,372
Every company takes insurance
for their employees.

886
01:40:41,651 --> 01:40:46,211
We took the policy details
from the last year database.

887
01:40:46,424 --> 01:40:50,904
We randomly selected the ones who
have no parents and relatives.

888
01:40:51,407 --> 01:40:54,527
Among that we selected the
ones with very high income.

889
01:40:54,905 --> 01:40:55,985
I'll plan.

890
01:40:57,312 --> 01:40:59,112
Sailesh will execute.

891
01:41:08,477 --> 01:41:10,477
How did Vetri come into this?

892
01:41:10,628 --> 01:41:15,428
We had to monitor the everyday
activity of those selected?

893
01:41:16,393 --> 01:41:21,113
We needed lots of information to make
every murder look like an accident.

894
01:41:21,637 --> 01:41:25,117
That’s when we selected
a fresher like Vetri.

895
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:30,893
Vimal's dad William Mathew
has claimed 1 crore.

896
01:41:35,706 --> 01:41:38,266
Vimal's parents are dead.

897
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:44,477
How do you get that claimed money?

898
01:41:45,756 --> 01:41:50,316
As the dead persons have no relatives
we claim with their details.

899
01:41:50,808 --> 01:41:54,853
When we get the money from the
company, we share it among ourselves.

900
01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:03,442
Even an animal will hunt
only when it's hungry.

901
01:42:05,476 --> 01:42:07,196
Will you do anything for money?

902
01:42:09,764 --> 01:42:11,204
Who else is in this?

903
01:42:11,838 --> 01:42:15,198
Shankaran's policy too has been approved.

904
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:22,310
His father by the name of Vaidiyanathan
has applied for the claim.

905
01:42:26,704 --> 01:42:28,424
If we find him,
this case is over.

906
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:32,601
And finally..

907
01:42:33,364 --> 01:42:34,364
Who is Vallaba?

908
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:47,233
Sir we are calling from PNGC insurance
Is this Vaidiyanathan?

909
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:53,720
Your sons death insurance
claim has been approved.

910
01:42:55,156 --> 01:42:57,556
We'll deliver the cheque in person.

911
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:00,621
Just wanted to confirm the address.

912
01:43:00,989 --> 01:43:01,789
Tell me sir.

913
01:43:13,955 --> 01:43:15,035
Take him away.

914
01:43:16,896 --> 01:43:19,016
He is telling only what we know.

915
01:43:19,932 --> 01:43:23,492
There is a 3rd person Vallaba.

916
01:43:30,657 --> 01:43:35,537
This case will be a new experience for you,
Do as I say.

917
01:43:50,795 --> 01:43:55,635
Check if there is anyone in the house
Don’t stay more than 5 minutes

918
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:13,562
-Sir!
-The door is open, come in.

919
01:44:32,876 --> 01:44:34,036
Mr. Vaidiyanathan!

920
01:45:22,296 --> 01:45:24,896
Good job Vetri,
Sit down.

921
01:45:32,864 --> 01:45:38,344
Needs determine our lives! That’s what
brought me and Sadagopan together.

922
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,031
That’s what brought you here.

923
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:46,488
I was the one who wanted
you in this company.

924
01:45:48,834 --> 01:45:53,874
I had many students, but I believed
you will be with me at any situation.

925
01:45:53,899 --> 01:45:55,219
That’s why I selected you.

926
01:45:55,244 --> 01:45:56,444
You try for a Detective job,

927
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:57,530
I've got an offer.

928
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,030
What made you think I would be Inhuman too?

929
01:46:04,887 --> 01:46:06,887
Humanity?

930
01:46:07,472 --> 01:46:09,472
No one has that anymore.

931
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:15,017
We don’t even react to the evil
things happening around us.

932
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:17,042
We just see it as a news.

933
01:46:19,365 --> 01:46:22,405
I wanted to discuss this
So I invited you home.

934
01:46:22,711 --> 01:46:26,228
But you brought your friends,
I couldn’t discuss anything then.

935
01:46:26,451 --> 01:46:28,811
At the earliest,
I thought I could convince you.

936
01:46:30,578 --> 01:46:35,178
When you spoke to Sailesh after
Vimal's death, I tried contacting you.

937
01:46:35,444 --> 01:46:37,444
But you started enquiring.

938
01:46:37,644 --> 01:46:39,644
Vimal an IT professional.

939
01:46:39,799 --> 01:46:41,399
-Sankaran?
-He's dead.

940
01:46:43,672 --> 01:46:45,072
Professor called 4 times.

941
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:49,270
It's out of our hands.

942
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:54,970
You could've ended it then?

943
01:46:55,433 --> 01:46:58,713
More mistakes are done to cover up.

944
01:46:59,402 --> 01:47:02,362
If we had let them go
You would have gone to the police.

945
01:47:02,996 --> 01:47:06,436
Just to keep you away from
the police I bailed you out.

946
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:14,279
-Still you cornered me.
-If not me someone else would've.

947
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:16,689
You didn’t have to do this.

948
01:47:18,246 --> 01:47:19,846
Are you Vallaba?

949
01:47:20,795 --> 01:47:24,595
What do you know about me?
I completed my studies at 28.

950
01:47:25,011 --> 01:47:26,491
I couldn’t study anymore.

951
01:47:26,949 --> 01:47:33,789
I never got parental guidance, education,
relationships, marriage, at the right time.

952
01:47:34,013 --> 01:47:36,573
Why?
Here nothing is right Vetri..

953
01:47:37,455 --> 01:47:39,055
I was not satisfied with my life.

954
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:42,600
I wanted to give my mom the
best treatment in this world.

955
01:47:43,114 --> 01:47:45,914
Here no one cares about anyone.

956
01:47:46,482 --> 01:47:49,082
Intellectual minds are enslaved
by the cunning clever.

957
01:47:50,246 --> 01:47:53,326
As a professor i've done
a lot for the society.

958
01:47:53,886 --> 01:47:56,166
But this society has done nothing for me.

959
01:47:56,406 --> 01:47:58,086
Sadagopan came to me.

960
01:47:58,831 --> 01:48:00,831
I never worried joining with him.

961
01:48:06,908 --> 01:48:10,628
You never knew the solitary pain.

962
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:23,430
Why sir? Why are you self-centered?

963
01:48:24,262 --> 01:48:26,062
You've got a wrong perception.

964
01:48:36,612 --> 01:48:39,972
Sir don't do this!
We can get you out of this trouble..

965
01:48:41,134 --> 01:48:43,574
Accept your mistake sir!

966
01:48:43,713 --> 01:48:46,193
Do listen to me!
Don't get it wrong again!

967
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:51,392
Think about your mother
before you do anything wrong

968
01:49:43,089 --> 01:49:45,129
Headlines.

969
01:49:45,154 --> 01:49:50,537
The Manager of PNGC Sadagopan (a)
Pooranachandran has been arrested.

970
01:49:50,562 --> 01:49:55,682
For the series of murders relating
to accidental insurance policy.

971
01:49:55,972 --> 01:49:59,892
The Police commissioner has
informed that,

972
01:49:59,956 --> 01:50:03,356
Measures have been taken to
reduce crime in the city.

973
01:50:08,232 --> 01:50:12,192
Certain incidents will change our beliefs.

974
01:50:13,612 --> 01:50:16,212
Let this be a fresh beginning.

975
01:50:16,581 --> 01:50:18,461
Don't let out your passion.

976
01:50:48,511 --> 01:50:50,951
Madhu, when are they coming?

977
01:50:51,888 --> 01:50:53,568
They've already started.

978
01:51:03,786 --> 01:51:06,285
Hello Vetri, How are you?

979
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:11,768
-How was your trip?
-Why are you making me a driver.

980
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:16,535
Nambi, Do taste and give your comments
on the dishes I cooked..

981
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:21,355
Does she think I only know to cook?

982
01:51:21,529 --> 01:51:22,969
You were the one, who said so.

983
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,840
My friend Prushotaman, too is here.

984
01:52:24,256 --> 01:52:25,816
There is an other person too.

985
01:52:25,841 --> 01:52:27,801
I never saw him after he came.

986
01:52:29,585 --> 01:52:30,625
Are you Vallaba?

987
01:52:31,272 --> 01:52:32,912
What do you know about me?

988
01:52:33,365 --> 01:52:36,045
Intellectual minds are enslaved
by the cunning clever.
