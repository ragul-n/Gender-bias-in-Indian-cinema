1
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,375
Ravinder Reddy... Mallanna saying the good

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,833
40 villages and 4 Lakh people
walked under his shade...

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:24,458
Their hands left the swords
and got into hard work in his leadership

4
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,458
Fields got wet with sweat instead of bloodshed

5
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,708
Kids got educated

6
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,583
You too should study well like my sister, ok?

7
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,500
Mr. Venkataramaiah

8
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,375
Hello sir

9
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,791
Are you fine?
Fine sir

10
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,000
Son?
Yes sir

11
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,583
Hello sir

12
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,416
He completed his education.

13
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,666
He got a job in city and came for your blessings sir

14
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,708
Happy right?

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:03:01,458
When thought to live along with grown up son,
he says to migrate and live because of this job

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,583
See you sir

17
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,958
That God gives a boon only when requested

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,625
He donated his 2000 acres of land
without asking to the public

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
and became a God for this public

20
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,583
Where there is God, devil too exists at the same place

21
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,166
Name of that devil is Basireddy

22
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:26,375
If anybody asks how ego, jealous
and thirst for power look, he can be shown

23
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,791
Dad, if he builds the school there
we cannot continue mining.

24
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:33,958
We shall somehow stop him

25
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,041
Though he is equal in manpower and money to Ravinder Reddy,

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,041
there is no answer why the public is not with him

27
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,458
To oppose Ravinder Reddy and
to keep up his upper hand, he selected a weapon

28
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,125
That weapon is politics.

29
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:06,500
Though he could not become a leader,
thought can uphold the power,

30
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,333
he stepped into Uyyalawada with
a scarf on the shoulders becoming a politician

31
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:18,999
Hello Ravinder Reddy,
brother in law came back becoming a Minister

32
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:30,458
You brought in the politics to center of village,
which separates public into castes, communities and groups

33
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:31,708
What do you want to achieve?

34
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:36,499
What do you want to achieve getting them educated?

35
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:40,415
I am stopping,

36
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,708
I am stopping everything

37
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,124
Do you wish to better lives
by getting these rascals educated?

38
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,374
No,

39
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,749
we shall frighten and let them remain as slaves

40
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,041
Hey...

41
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,665
What is fear?

42
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,083
For Basireddy wishing to show domination with power,

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,707
shot from Ravinder Reddy
seemed like the paw of a lion

44
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:28,208
Unable to see his men not being able
to control the courage of Ravinder Reddy

45
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:33,458
and his sons with dead power,
in an insult is victimized to his own ego

46
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,499
You continue doing the final rites here for your dad
and he is getting hundreds married there

47
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:12,040
I am burning in revenge and pain

48
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,915
Priest sir

49
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,333
Yes...tell me sir.

50
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,874
Do you say some good happening within
an year of death in the house?

51
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,915
Yes.

52
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,708
Can I get married?

53
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:22,458
You will

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,415
Do arrangements of my marriage
too in that father in law?

55
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,790
Oh no, I just thought your father is dead.
Have you lost even your mind?

56
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,915
Taking villagers as his own,

57
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,249
not just as courage in their troubles

58
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:39,124
but Ravinder Reddy stood as a God getting
good done in the houses of poor.

59
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:40,333
Brother..

60
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,749
this 5000 acres is for schools, Colleges
and for University

61
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,333
It is not just enough to teach.

62
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,208
We shall give away rest of our lands
for Companies and factories

63
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,915
Then both education and jobs are right here

64
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,041
If this happens,
the word migration will not be heard in Seema

65
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,249
What happened brother?

66
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,165
Seeing your trouble to bring my
thoughts left as dreams into reality,

67
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,332
I am feeling happy

68
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,665
What is our trouble in front of your aim
that all should study, brother?

69
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:23,124
It is the luck done by this Seema to be
walking under your leadership

70
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,665
Aunty..How is my derss ?

71
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,749
All my beauty is yours

72
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,749
When shall we get sister married, brother?

73
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,624
Her wish

74
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,791
Brother
Yes

75
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,624
We shall get Collector sir, shall we start?

76
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,999
We will go and meet Collector sir.

77
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,582
You go and be at the temple.

78
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,166
Ok, move

79
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,124
I will talk to high command and get you an MLC

80
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,874
Ravi... that Pratap Reddy is not like his father it seems.

81
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,415
He wishes to marry and live good

82
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,291
Bear, nothing will happen

83
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,915
Hey, stop the vehicle

84
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,457
Namaste sir

85
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:42,540
Mallaiah
Sir

86
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:45,207
What are you seeing so, get her in the vehicle

87
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,749
Why trouble for you sir, you go

88
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,291
Come on...
Ok sir

89
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:50,291
Hey Suri, you come behind
Ok brother

90
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:54,540
Bear it up

91
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,708
We are going to hospital.
Be patient

92
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,874
Not just sharpness in the
weapon is needed to hunt the lion,

93
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,958
but Pratap Reddy thought he had
to wait like a fox for the chance

94
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:37,833
Ravi

95
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,708
Come on chop down Ravinder Reddy

96
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:54,332
Ravi...

97
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,874
Hey, nothing will happen to you...

98
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,791
Sir, my wife is into pains
and we got to go to the hospital sir

99
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,499
Leave sir, she will die... Sir...

100
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:11,790
Sir...

101
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,124
Sir, leave sir...

102
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,291
We said not to hit on our income
by constructing school.

103
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,582
Did you listen?

104
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,832
You hit my father and became a reason for his death

105
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,457
How did you think that I will leave you Ravinder Reddy?

106
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:38,332
Mallaiah...

107
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,958
You did a great mistake...

108
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:49,915
I thought to teach these public
to study giving up killing

109
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,666
If my aim is dying because of you

110
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,083
I will not stay calm seeing it

111
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:02,915
Brother...

112
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:04,749
Come on..

113
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,707
Peddanna, start the vehicle

114
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:09,957
Take to the hospital fast

115
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,916
Come on drive fast...

116
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,374
He got insulted by mom
and was called as a waste fellow,

117
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:32,749
but the truth that he hid the revenge in his sword in the
fist was kept as a secret till he killed Ravinder Reddy.

118
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,333
Though my breathe stops, my aim should not stop

119
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,874
For the aim of his brother to be alive,

120
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:19,332
Bhanumathi Devi decided to stand as the
courage in her people being as their courage.

121
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:30,582
They say Pratap Reddy killed Ravinder Reddy,
what is your answer to this?

122
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,290
True

123
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,416
It seems they arrested Pratap Reddy

124
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,707
Pratap Reddy is arrested and justice won

125
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,333
But the injustice to our Seema is still as it is

126
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,624
We shall give the judgment ourselves for that

127
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,582
That means..what are you doing now?

128
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,790
Pratap Reddy in pride feeling
to have killed the courage of Seema,

129
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:05,208
it did not take much time to know that the dead
courage is reborn ferociously in the form of Bhanumati

130
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,124
Bhanumati Devi to keep up her promise to brother,

131
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,291
started driving away the darkness from the roots.

132
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:19,457
She established a clear domination
in Seema with no enemies left behind

133
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,499
Though her popularity expanded all over the state,

134
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:37,833
Pratap Reddy was burning within as he was nothing
just in Rayala Seema because of Bhanumati Devi

135
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,540
She is frightened to death because of you, son in law.

136
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:44,832
That is why, it seems she is put her niece
somewhere far away for education

137
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,040
Shall I get her searched?

138
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,332
Her fear should become our strength uncle

139
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,374
That means?

140
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:58,124
That means, brother should come out

141
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,624
We killed Bhanumathi

142
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,082
You have nothing to fear about.

143
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,957
All the doctors are our people.
You have nothing to worry

144
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,958
Look Home... Come here

145
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:53,790
When will you let my son in law out

146
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,708
For Republic day..

147
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:56,082
It is already been three years since
you became the home, right?

148
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,957
I will include name of brother in the
list for Republic day

149
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:01,166
and release on the basis of good behavior

150
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:01,791
Can we believe?

151
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,332
Hey, you have been telling and we have been listening

152
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,249
Hey uncle, what is the mediation with him?

153
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,666
Take him out and appoint another

154
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,957
Name of Reddy sir will surely be
there in the press note to release soon

155
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,374
Believe me

156
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,041
Yes, we have become so after believing continuously

157
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,499
Niece of Bhanumati! Her fear is our weapon.

158
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,458
She is grown up.

159
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,707
We will keep that weapon in your hands
once you are out.

160
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:25,916
Do whatever you wish to

161
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:31,499
This is her childhood photo,
your brothers will somehow catch her.

162
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:41,290
Hello brother
Come brother, come. Be seated

163
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,458
You asked for a body guard
to safe guard your baby right?

164
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:48,499
Yes, is he there?

165
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,458
Come on, he will take care like the eyelid brother...

166
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,332
Hey, call Balu fellow

167
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:08,749
Brother, I cannot do running.

168
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,583
The road is blocked...

169
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,958
Who are they bro?

170
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,999
Three guys took over the land of an old man

171
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,499
Bapu has given that work to me

172
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,999
Will we do normally when a work is given?
I made those go mad

173
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,708
Look there, how are those mad guys coming

174
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,541
Stop dude.
He is exciting too much

175
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,165
Hey, I did not still hit you

176
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,374
Hey, when we are running to save you,

177
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,458
you do not look like leave till you get hit

178
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,958
Hey, are you overacting as I slimmed down?

179
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,832
I will snatch the nerves and make you dance idiots...

180
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:54,915
Hey, say guys

181
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:56,541
I said right, he is getting excited too much

182
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,332
Hey, what rascal?

183
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,249
Hey, he cheated us and took away 30 Lakhs.

184
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,041
Catch him somehow please

185
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,207
Turn the beautiful face.

186
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,332
I came as uncle said to bring the money bro

187
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,875
What money, we sold the lands right?

188
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,207
What have you done about me, then?

189
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,582
I am talking right?

190
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,125
Brother, you do not anything. Stay calm

191
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,582
What are these discussions?

192
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,374
What rascal, you do not like discussions?
Take these punches then

193
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,125
Hey..let's move.

194
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,332
Hey bro...
Move aside rascal

195
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,332
Where are you dispersing after starting the discussion?

196
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,999
Bro, you have no relations in Domalguda right?

197
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
No. - Thanks brother

198
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,124
Hey move, we shall go to Domalguda and settle there.

199
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,582
He will beat us like dogs being here
and we get the same treatment as that guy, move

200
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,125
All are getting excited today...
Bapu called asked you to come

201
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,291
Is it?
Move

202
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:54,416
Details of my baby...

203
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:58,374
That boy should not know
any other details than the girl.

204
00:17:58,582 --> 00:17:59,832
I am handing over to you with a confidence

205
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,583
Hey brother, there is justice in your story.

206
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,207
I have the courage.

207
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,874
You be without any fear, that is it

208
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:08,541
Hello Bapu...

209
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:09,541
He came.

210
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,500
Yes, come...

211
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:12,499
Be seated.

212
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,750
Why have you called me Bapu?

213
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:18,749
Nothing son, you should be as a body guard for his girl

214
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,249
But, she should not know that matter.

215
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,708
Payment is two lakhs a day.

216
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:27,249
But there will be a bit of risk son.

217
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,541
Hey Bapu, is risk any new to us?

218
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:32,666
No worry about life and payment is tempting.

219
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,207
Fix it

220
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,749
It does not go anywhere son...

221
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,875
Come on, is it always like that Balkampet?

222
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,499
We should often be like that Banjarahills

223
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,375
Anyone is a slave for money

224
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:14,541
Will the babe not appreciate having cash?

225
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,332
Whatever we have is zero tomorrow again

226
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:21,374
Come on fill the whole glass

227
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:28,708
These notes are the fate
They are the remote for this globe

228
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:35,875
This currency is the signature over the luck

229
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,416
All we need is the money

230
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,957
It is also funny

231
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,458
All we need is the money

232
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,124
What will you do with all this money?

233
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,500
I took up so much of pain to earn money as a child.

234
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,000
I got fixed to take the same trouble to spend the same

235
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,791
Pour the fire into the glasses

236
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,291
Fill the vacancy in the hearts

237
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:35,249
We got to fly in the air always like this

238
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,750
Think of the note so

239
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,707
Come on try to snatch the stars

240
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,208
Catch the kiss or miss

241
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,874
Finalize yes or no

242
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,249
Steal whatever you can

243
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,791
Hide that in your memory

244
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,000
All we need is the money

245
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,541
It is also funny

246
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,166
All we need is the money

247
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,499
Move on...by the way, what is your story bro..

248
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:14,291
I don't have any story..

249
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,666
But some day one story will come and connect me.

250
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,416
and I am the hero of that story

251
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,875
Hero... He is the hero... Hero..

252
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,916
Will not a turn come in my way?

253
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:38,374
For me to stand as a leader

254
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:42,082
This is so crazy life

255
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,500
Will what I wish not be my fate?

256
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:48,916
Will what is written not become a history?

257
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,707
My chase is the peace

258
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,250
It is smiles being with me

259
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,750
Will not the mischief look small?

260
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,625
Will not the luck be with me?

261
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,000
Success is my first friend

262
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,000
All we need is the money

263
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,458
It is also funny

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,541
All we need is the money

265
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,875
What dude?

266
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,125
Did knowingly or unknowingly?

267
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,875
Leave it, it just happened so

268
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:47,416
What leave out, feeling like
the guy doing surgical strike at the borders?

269
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,875
Who is he, your neighbor?

270
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:50,625
No madam

271
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,874
Your relative?
Damn, what is he a relative to me?

272
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,249
He is your villager.
No madam.

273
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,624
Then, is he introduced at the bar?

274
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,583
I do not go to bar at all madam

275
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,166
Then, instead to eat and sleep,

276
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,541
why did you get my sister married to a stranger, idiot?

277
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,916
I will tear away the cushion idiot

278
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:08,541
Madam

279
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:13,332
You look hard like the lady Gabbar Singh
and I will say you the truth, I promise.

280
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,333
Keep that first.

281
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:19,500
My Guruji said I will get married
by getting 10 love couples married

282
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:20,249
That means?

283
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,041
That means...

284
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:24,541
Number of your sister is nine
and if I get another marriage done...

285
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:27,332
I am almost near to my marriage madam

286
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:33,041
I will see to that you do not get married in this life, rascal

287
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:34,624
Round number 4

288
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,916
Hey bro, what happened?

289
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,499
I mean, that is...

290
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,208
Will I get a room in this house for rent?

291
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,583
Hey, I am already frustrated, go

292
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,499
Come on, why do you get angry bro.

293
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:55,541
Take commission if you need

294
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,083
What idiot, you give commission
to me for my house? Go...

295
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,707
Crazy dude!

296
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,791
I do not want all that bro, I need a room for
rent in this house adjacent to that house.

297
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,458
What are you making me go mad?

298
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,791
What is in that house? Is your lover there?

299
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:08,749
Looks like he would agree saying yes...

300
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,125
Yes, she is there
Lover?

301
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,832
Lover means you marry instead
of just watching films and eating ice creams too?

302
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,458
Come on, we love to marry right bro?

303
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,291
Is it? I will get you married bro

304
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,291
Then the rent

305
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,957
I get married only after that right?

306
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,582
Are you any stranger to take rent bro?

307
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,791
You are my brother
Then come on bro

308
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,666
Stay free, care free
Move bro

309
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:34,916
What is that car and what is this house?

310
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,250
What is your profession bro?

311
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:37,374
Painter

312
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,458
Oh, you do white wash?

313
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,916
Not white wash bro, I draw paintings.
I am an artiste

314
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:43,916
Oh! is it

315
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:44,999
Do not insult me bro

316
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,083
This is my drawer's room,

317
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,999
you stay here. Keep your luggage here

318
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh no!

319
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,291
You also play Guitar bro?

320
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,291
They say pains come down for music. You start,

321
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,749
I may feel better and cost of medicine will come down

322
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:17,749
Telescope?

323
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,125
What are you doing bro?

324
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,333
My life does not stay settled
without seeing my lover, bro

325
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:24,499
That girl should be in front of my eyes

326
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,166
You love more sincere than the CC camera bro.

327
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:29,874
I love the love you love

328
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,749
How would the girl look bro?

329
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,416
The babe looks so great bro

330
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,875
Why do you say so?

331
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,457
She is your lover right?
Why are you saying like you are seeing for the first time?

332
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:09,999
I mean, it is first time I am seeing
from this bro and thus is the excitement

333
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,625
You have answer for every question bro

334
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,291
Have you not been to office?

335
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,375
Thought will have breakfast and go

336
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,875
They serve in your canteen right?
Yes, they will

337
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,250
Good morning uncle

338
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,207
Say all these to your aunt

339
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,000
How long is this suppression for me?

340
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,916
Wait for some days uncle, we will fly away.
I am planning, right?

341
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
You too can follow me

342
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,000
Hey, high five

343
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,250
It would be great to fly away

344
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:44,249
Huh, what uncle? Is it down or up?

345
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,416
The bell would ring in the next five minutes.

346
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,041
I did not ask about shares but about your BP

347
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,499
Huh, where are you going so early in the morning?

348
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:52,707
Huh, does he need?

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,250
I am going to temple with friends.

350
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,582
Take Chintu with you

351
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:03,832
You would say I commented aunty,
but is that Chintu fellow security for me?

352
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,000
Huh, he would save if something happens to me

353
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,583
Say the truth, where are you going?

354
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:14,291
Marriage of Kavya, right? A small party

355
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,708
Do we not have the parties?

356
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:18,249
Ok, enjoy

357
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,291
your uncle does not like all these right?

358
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,082
Ask him to say all such to his students at his college.

359
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:26,041
Aadya does not like orders.
Ok, see you

360
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:29,291
Hey, they are leaving. Move fast bro.

361
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,082
Oh no, babes have left, they left...

362
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,916
Pirate brew... What is this bro like a new film title?

363
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,291
Cute!

364
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,457
Not film title, but a coffee shop

365
00:27:59,166 --> 00:27:59,791
Why did you hit?

366
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,041
What if not...

367
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,791
You moved around with her for whole year

368
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:09,000
and now leave her without even saying
break up as you got a fresh biscuit now?

369
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,333
What now, should I say break up?

370
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,791
Oh no, he is shooting questions...

371
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,583
Hey dry fruit,

372
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:22,749
who would give pick up and drops for her
from tomorrow if you suddenly leave?

373
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:26,499
Who would pay money for Pizzas and pubs?

374
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,249
Why so much ego for you to say break up?

375
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,208
Ok, break up!

376
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:33,958
You...

377
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:36,082
Why do you hit again?

378
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:41,625
Hey, rights to say break up are of girls
and not the boys

379
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,000
You say

380
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:43,916
Break up

381
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:46,791
Come on, push off

382
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,207
I will teach you the lesson...

383
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,791
You think I am a voter to be frightened
when you threaten idiot?

384
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,166
I am the shooter.

385
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:56,749
I will shoot you.

386
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:58,541
Hey dub smash... You go on

387
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:06,124
Do not give variety poses, get away dry fruit

388
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,250
How did she fall for you dude?

389
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,332
She still did not bro, I should now

390
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:16,707
You should?

391
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,124
She is like to throw down and hit

392
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,541
Bro, please do something

393
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,582
What please?

394
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,375
It is a bit difficult to, but my marriage is linked

395
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,207
Ok!

396
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,375
Bro, are you gents or agents?

397
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,916
I do not understand

398
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:41,582
Latest technology for love bro...
Every movement of the girl will be known to us

399
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,916
Sister..we will go to room.

400
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,541
Someone came?
Who came?

401
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,166
Oh no...

402
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,250
Hey, has anybody come home for a fight?

403
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,375
No sister.

404
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,375
Thank God

405
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:56,416
What happened sister?

406
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:59,082
Sravs broke up with her boyfriend right?

407
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,374
Yes, she uploaded on face book and we saw

408
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:03,332
You all bashed up together

409
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,291
Hey, I did not bash up.

410
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,457
I just gave a build up for body language

411
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,875
I just scolded and he got hurt
saying to teach me a lesson

412
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,541
I am tensed thinking he may come over to the house

413
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,916
When you fear so much, why do you give a build up?

414
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:21,957
What else to do guys,

415
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,416
I thought to do so much from childhood.

416
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:28,791
But they did not let me do anything on
the name of security and safety

417
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,250
They made sit at home in Inter.

418
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,166
They made me do Degree in distance

419
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,875
Where are boys, boyfriends and break ups in life?

420
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,916
I understood these will not happen in my life.

421
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,375
And thus...

422
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,416
You wish to say lies and live happily right?

423
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,375
What, dress change?

424
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:57,416
Good night
Bye

425
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,124
Just close your eyes bro...

426
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:03,082
It is been ages since I closed,
you can see as you have not closed

427
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:15,375
Hey dude, what have you done about
the work given by brother?

428
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,791
Hey what are you looking there
when I am asking something?

429
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:23,166
Oh no...

430
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,416
What is this mess? What is this bull shit?

431
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:31,166
Your brother is releasing on one side
and Bhanumati is on rise on the other

432
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:35,124
We did not find that girl and what are you guys thinking?

433
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:40,041
It seems she hired a dog to safeguard her niece.

434
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:43,166
I enquired all goons and bodybuilders in Hyderabad

435
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,916
He would be found somewhere

436
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,416
and it is like we found her when he is caught father in law

437
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:57,082
I should somehow talk and somehow get connected

438
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:01,541
Bro, you did not say what painting
and what colors you use. What is this bro?

439
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,833
What happened?

440
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,750
Oh, this?

441
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,999
Robbers fell in the house yesterday and I got hurt
when I was woman handling them

442
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:10,666
Is it?

443
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,374
Oh! what an over action.

444
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:13,082
What?

445
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,875
That is a dub smash, you go on

446
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,791
Are you really hit robbers ?

447
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:19,957
Why, you doubt that I am lying?

448
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,582
Not that..you only

449
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:25,332
That is not called beating but said bashing up

450
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,707
Hey, who are you?

451
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,166
Who, me?

452
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,166
I stay in the opposite house of madam

453
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,916
I came out not getting sleep in the night and...

454
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:40,291
I heard two male voices screaming. Shouting to save...

455
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,416
Madam entering overlapping those...

456
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:45,207
Left... yes, left leg right madam?

457
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:47,874
Yes, left leg

458
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,416
She gave a punch with right hand and I was stunned

459
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:55,750
She squeezed down one under the leg
and one under the hand... Idiots were almost dead

460
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
We generally see all such thing
in the films of Vijayashanti

461
00:32:58,707 --> 00:32:59,457
Yes, Kartavyam

462
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,000
Correct

463
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,875
But, madam showed such in live

464
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:02,499
Wow

465
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:03,374
Who is this fellow?

466
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Did you see?
I saw it all

467
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,000
Hey, let us move

468
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,332
Vijayashanti madam, selfie please... Madam...

469
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,750
One selfie
Damn it, go

470
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,375
She is like connected, right bro?
You got connected to these bro

471
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,666
Why are you looking so at that house sister?

472
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,541
The guy newly coming into the
opposite house is praising me a lot

473
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,624
I am observing why is he praising me so much?

474
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:47,916
Ok, then you observe

475
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,750
I will buy everything you need, sleep dear

476
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,500
Bro...

477
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,541
Why is this scream?

478
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:58,832
I need a puppy

479
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,083
OK.

480
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,457
How is it?

481
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,582
It is fat and cute like you

482
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,132
Do not worry, we are going now right?

483
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:08,840
Hi good morning madam

484
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,590
Good morning

485
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,132
Are you taking the dog for walk?

486
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,465
I am taking Bablu to hospital

487
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,007
Is Bablu the dog?

488
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:18,882
What is the breed of this?

489
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:20,799
Only rich like you look at the breed and grade

490
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:22,757
You do not have the heart to see the heart of this?

491
00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:24,174
Heart?

492
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,549
Your family members take you
to Care when you get fever.

493
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,507
You take care of this when it gets fever.

494
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:33,382
A dog on platform when in fever is not
taken care by even the God

495
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,674
This does not look like having fever.

496
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,132
Are you following me?

497
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:40,840
No, just coincidence

498
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,382
Hello, why are you going that way
when the hospital is that way?

499
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,090
Hello... stop...

500
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:47,799
Aadya..

501
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,590
Hi Kiran, are you fine?

502
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,007
Where is your new girlfriend?

503
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:58,674
Wow, she is acting great like a split personality

504
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:03,757
What, you were on rise that day in Coffee day.

505
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,632
Is it all done when I came with batch?

506
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,924
No, nothing as such Kiran

507
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:11,340
What have I done?

508
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:14,299
I just scolded and she hit right?

509
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,632
My foot!

510
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:20,007
Your motivation is more in hitting me than her frustration

511
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:21,465
Past is past,

512
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:24,965
I forgot and you too forget please

513
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:26,965
What rascal, shall I forget?

514
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:28,799
Is this any dream?

515
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:31,090
I came fixed for taking revenge.

516
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,465
I will not leave from here till I do something to you.

517
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,049
Hey, whom did you come to and what are you talking?

518
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:39,674
Once she steps in, you will see the
sequel of Osey Ramulamma film.

519
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:42,549
What idiot, are you overacting bringing in your assistants?

520
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:45,215
No Kiran, nothing as such.
You come here rascal

521
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:46,507
You cool man.

522
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,965
When I am trying to pacify that fellow
why are you instigating him?

523
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:50,257
You be quiet, you do not know anything.

524
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:55,465
She is thinking why bloodshed in a public place,
do not instigate madam

525
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,049
Oh no
You be cool dude

526
00:35:58,507 --> 00:35:59,840
What, are you thinking that today is Tuesday?

527
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,215
No Tuesday and Wednesday, shut up

528
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:03,799
Hey, what is your bloody discussion?

529
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,049
What are you saying a discussion?

530
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,424
Messing with fire as the colour is good
and messing with madam are both the same

531
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:14,507
I pray you, please stop your dirty punch dialogues

532
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,340
I give buildup saying lies and
now you are making mess feeling all that is true.

533
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,382
Shall we make the lies true?

534
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,340
Do you not feel to be said
that you bashed up all these guys?

535
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:32,257
How?

536
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:33,590
What how, rascal?

537
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,674
Hey... Mummy
Poor fellow is a man

538
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,590
More... more...

539
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:10,799
Relax

540
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,340
I said a lot as such lies to my friends

541
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,590
Come on, let us make even them true

542
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:17,174
Okay.

543
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:44,257
What to do said the hurry?

544
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:49,215
Heart said not to stop

545
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:54,465
Life is a sweet dream

546
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:59,507
Live it happily

547
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:04,757
Let me fly in the air today
Let me sing a new song like this

548
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:50,507
Happiness in me is enhanced huge

549
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:55,465
The sky is full of so many colors

550
00:39:55,715 --> 00:40:00,799
All this happiness in me is because of you

551
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:05,757
This is the friendship
and it is enough if you are with me

552
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Let me fly in the air today
Let me sing a new song like this

553
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,257
I have a boy friend in my child hood days.

554
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:23,174
He rejected me..
Stop

555
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,924
Stop, call to him.
Now he will propose me.

556
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,590
You know it is surprising that I am becoming you

557
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:02,799
Love and see dear heart, there is some wonder

558
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:07,757
You are the autumn and came to me

559
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:12,882
I am infinity and what else would I wish for?

560
00:41:12,924 --> 00:41:17,965
Let me fly in the air today
Let me sing a new song like this

561
00:41:27,924 --> 00:41:32,632
What to do said the hurry

562
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:37,590
Heart said not to stop

563
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:44,924
Hey, it seems that Pratap Reddy is going out, right?

564
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:48,340
What is good going out dude,
Bhanumati would end him once he is out?

565
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:51,132
He is not understanding, he is safe being here in jail

566
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:54,590
Hey, he may be a King anywhere but not in Kurnool

567
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,090
Jailor!

568
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,590
What is this Reddy Sir?

569
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:17,090
To hell with you, what is this?

570
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,924
When we are bringing you out on good behavior,
you have been messing in with something.

571
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:23,382
Two prisoners I the jail died fighting each other.

572
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:26,090
This should come tomorrow in the news.

573
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:31,424
But, the gossip that Pratap Reddy
killed them should go into the public.

574
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,257
Did you get the niece of Bhanumati?

575
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:36,715
We are on the same work.

576
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,882
Madam..

577
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:46,090
Madam, they are saying that Pratap Reddy has a link
to the two murders that took place in the jail.

578
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,007
Your comment on this?

579
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,257
We do not care about unnecessary matters.

580
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:54,215
Pratap Reddy doing so much being in jail,
will he leave if he is out?

581
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,507
How are you going to face this?

582
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:58,424
We are not so free to think about those

583
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:02,632
Our vision is all about developing our area

584
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,549
Then, can we think that you are diverting
your fear about Pratap Reddy like this?

585
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:10,049
Hey, what to fear about that fellow?
He is like dead coming here.

586
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,007
I am saying now, all of you write

587
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,715
We are giving ten crores if he is handed
over either dead or alive.

588
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:23,132
Brother is in anger, I am saying again.

589
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:26,924
That Pratap Reddy has no right to step in this Seema.

590
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,174
Leave now

591
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:33,174
Madam, one minute

592
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:45,382
See the photos

593
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:47,340
Aadya, call from your mother in law

594
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:48,799
Nice, right?

595
00:43:49,382 --> 00:43:51,257
Hi mother in law
Are you fine dear?

596
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,132
Fine mother in law

597
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,507
Is all your birthday shopping done?

598
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,840
Long back

599
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:57,674
Why not come down tomorrow dear?

600
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:58,632
Tomorrow?

601
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,757
Tomorrow is the Sangeet of Kavya, right Mother in law?

602
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,215
By the way, are you not coming?

603
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:07,382
We have our college opening right?
I cannot come dear

604
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:08,507
Ok mother in law

605
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,632
You wish on my behalf

606
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,257
Bye mother in law, love you

607
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:16,507
What is this?
See now

608
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:21,924
Aadya, come here once

609
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,590
Look here

610
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:28,424
Not coincidental,
but I think he is following on a purpose.

611
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:29,715
You think it is love?
I think so

612
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,090
I do not know about him, but it is love from me

613
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,257
You do not fall out like that.

614
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,174
First know what is in his heart

615
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:41,757
Let us call and invite him to City Center

616
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:43,632
No...No Teju...

617
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,132
Hello...

618
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,174
Balu...

619
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:51,174
I should meet you once.

620
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,507
Not possible Aadya,

621
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:55,007
I am going out on a small work

622
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,090
Say please...

623
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,799
Please Balu

624
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:04,882
Sorry Aadya,

625
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:07,507
I have a small work in City Center

626
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,424
How do he know?

627
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:15,090
Actually, I too am coming there.
We shall meet after your work is over.

628
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:20,049
Yes...

629
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:25,590
Bro, we will go to City Center

630
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,299
No thanks, I am not coming

631
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:31,882
Sentiment, I put an art gallery once there.
They made it an utter flop,

632
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:33,882
For your brother

633
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:36,299
Not for brother and will not come even for Tamannah!

634
00:45:36,507 --> 00:45:37,757
You go dude...

635
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:56,340
I am trying for you, what was the delay?
How long should I wait?

636
00:46:06,382 --> 00:46:06,882
Catch it once...

637
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,132
Catch...

638
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:10,882
Thanks

639
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,299
Sorry...
No problem

640
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:19,215
Where did you go?
Water bottle

641
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:20,882
Come, my friends are waiting

642
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,174
Hi Balu

643
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:30,090
What, all babes have called in for an assembly?

644
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:30,757
Hey Balu!

645
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:31,632
You come here.

646
00:46:32,174 --> 00:46:33,549
Aadya, you sit there.

647
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,840
Hey Balu..what is this?

648
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:38,882
Hey, you and Aadya... Photo is fine.

649
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,882
We are ok, what is you and that paintings guy behind?

650
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:47,215
Yes, what are you doing in our photo?

651
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:49,132
Hey, why were you there that day?

652
00:46:49,715 --> 00:46:54,132
That is, I and bro were going out on work that day and...

653
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:56,924
Yes Samosa, we should talk about that.

654
00:46:57,257 --> 00:46:58,965
His hand is golden hand

655
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,799
I am coming direct into the matter.
Are you loving or what?

656
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:04,299
What are you talking?

657
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:06,715
Hey, will you say or not?

658
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,840
Sasirekha Devi... Devi Sasirekha...

659
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:15,840
You point at my noe, make me sit at a mall
and want to make me vomit the truth?

660
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:18,799
Get out you dirty ladies, go...

661
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,132
He is not a type to tell but to make us tell.

662
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,049
You take care...

663
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:25,757
I will tell then

664
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:29,132
Hey, we are girls and should maintain some dignity

665
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,465
You said not to come?
You said brother

666
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:36,632
Framing is great!

667
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:38,507
Hey all you babes, fall in line

668
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:43,340
It is like revenge of brother will be cleared.

669
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:46,090
How to know who that girl is in these six girls?

670
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:50,924
The girl he goes behind is the niece of Bhanumati

671
00:47:53,632 --> 00:47:57,674
Men of Bhanumati are saying to do
whatever to face Pratap Reddy

672
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,715
They announced a gift of 10 crores to those
who catches Pratap Reddy alive or kill him

673
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,924
Somebody listen to my pain

674
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:09,424
What, you love that fellow
and thinking to express that to him?

675
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:14,174
But our family members are a bit different
and you think they would agree?

676
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:16,840
It is enough that mother in law agrees.

677
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:20,465
I will make him marry me even if none other agree

678
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:22,215
I cannot follow you

679
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:23,215
Go idiot

680
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:24,632
Cheers

681
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,007
Yes, say now son

682
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:32,215
Say this Bapu

683
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:35,924
They are paying 2 Lakhs a day just to save that girl means,

684
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:38,340
how much would they give to the guy marrying her?

685
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,507
Why about them to us dear?

686
00:48:41,424 --> 00:48:44,715
Nothing Bapu, my heart is onto that girl

687
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:46,049
You dirty rascal!

688
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,715
Son, we gave a word.

689
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:52,882
Never do something affecting our prestige.

690
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:55,090
Why do you get so angry? I just joked.

691
00:48:55,257 --> 00:48:57,299
Will joke be like this?

692
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:58,965
Listen, I will tell you a matter.

693
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:02,840
Money will be spent, love would die,

694
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:06,507
but only the name would be safe forever.

695
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:07,299
See you

696
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:22,965
Why is she so beautiful?

697
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,715
Come on, go to Charminar.

698
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,590
Move on...

699
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:36,715
Balu, stop. I should buy bangles.

700
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,090
Bro, one tea

701
00:49:56,257 --> 00:50:02,924
Madam, donate... Sir, donate!

702
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,590
How much do you get begging every day?

703
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:10,132
200 in regular sir

704
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:10,840
What is your name?

705
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,007
Munna

706
00:50:13,174 --> 00:50:16,507
I will add a zero and give. Take it

707
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:18,924
Wow, what a great day?

708
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:21,549
You are great sir, you should be great.

709
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:23,132
Where are you going idiot?

710
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:26,882
I have not given money for any goodwill.
But to share my pain

711
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:29,674
What pain for your sir?

712
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,090
Balu... Hey, how is it?

713
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:35,840
Buy it?
Is it?

714
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:37,965
How is the girl?

715
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:42,840
Oh no, she is shining like the new currency note sir

716
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:44,132
That is the pain.

717
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:48,007
I should be around her full day
but cannot take to the heart

718
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:52,090
Why not commit if it is so?

719
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,549
You are not understanding the matter.

720
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:57,382
How would you feel when a crore is
donated to you and said not to spend that?

721
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,049
Oh no, it is very bad sir.

722
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,340
To be frank, critical condition

723
00:51:03,382 --> 00:51:04,382
That is my situation

724
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:07,090
How is it?

725
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:11,049
Madam..
Sorry sir

726
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:14,132
Concentrate.... This is my pain

727
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:18,674
Come on, what is this a pain.
Just listen to what I am saying.

728
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:20,090
At my observation,

729
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,257
you are in love with that girl.

730
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,507
Well said... Go rascal...

731
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:28,549
Ok sir, have a good day

732
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:37,049
Idiot!

733
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,382
Our baby, we will take care

734
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:55,632
What dudes, taking the girl
and will you not take the boy?

735
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:03,715
Hey black shirt, are you the leader of this gang?

736
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,924
Hey Mallesh, finish him

737
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:18,257
He is giving orders with an ego of giving money.
What happened to your sense?

738
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,882
Hey, how much is he paying per day?

739
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:22,799
Ten thousand

740
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:25,757
If you have so much sincerity for just ten thousand,...

741
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:27,674
She is asleep

742
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:31,090
I am taking two lakhs a day
and how much dedication should I have?

743
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:32,924
Come here idiot

744
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:38,757
Hey, I should hit you
and by mistake is there a scope for you to hit me?

745
00:52:39,174 --> 00:52:39,715
No brother

746
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:41,007
Then why are these adventures?

747
00:52:43,215 --> 00:52:47,174
You look correct like a regular film rowdy.

748
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:48,924
It would be systematic when we both fight

749
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,924
He can bear about two to three shots

750
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:55,549
Bro, what happened to you?

751
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,549
Drink is been less in the night bro

752
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:03,840
Damn it! My mood to fight is ruined

753
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,757
What dude, is the boy absconded?

754
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:19,090
Sir, girl is missing

755
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,882
Hey start the vehicles...

756
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:04,757
Who is this white & white fellow?

757
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:11,382
So much of attitude to ask for a lift?
Is the road his property?

758
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:15,799
I should go to Kurnool

759
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,674
You will go up asking in wrong ways like this

760
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,174
I need to urgently go, take one Lakh rupees

761
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,465
Why are you still standing outside, please come in?

762
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:30,382
What happened?

763
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:32,299
My girlfriend sir, she is fainted due to dehydration.

764
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,674
Too much of Sun sir...

765
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:42,840
He is paying a Lakh per hour means,
no idea how much he gets.

766
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:44,674
Is he a real estate batch?

767
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:49,257
Sir, will real estate pick up after demonetization?

768
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:50,424
How do I know?

769
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:51,424
What is your name sir?

770
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:52,215
Prata...

771
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:54,590
Prasad Rao...

772
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:58,007
Gave a pause and said means it is not his name

773
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,174
I saw him somewhere... Where?

774
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:07,132
They announced a gift money of ten crores either
handed over alive or killed Pratap Reddy

775
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,299
Sir, what did you say your name?

776
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:11,674
I said right, Prasad Rao

777
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,465
He is Pratap Reddy, for sure he is Pratap Reddy

778
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:16,132
What happened?

779
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,757
Dirty AC sir, too much of Sun and see how is it sweating.

780
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:24,090
Wipe it sir

781
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,007
Oh no Pratap Reddy,
do you play like Kamal Hassan at me?

782
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:02,507
Shall we start?

783
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:04,257
Who are you?
I need lift

784
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:05,299
You should ask for that and then get in right?

785
00:56:05,424 --> 00:56:06,924
Every idiot asks and gets in.

786
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:08,674
The guy who gets in without asking is Maddy R

787
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:09,632
Who is that fellow in between?

788
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,799
The great Discovery channel
photographer, Mr. Madhava Rao.

789
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:13,632
It is me.

790
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:16,299
They show animals in the Discovery channel
and even people look similar

791
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:17,549
Let us start the journey dude

792
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,299
He looks like a bull and why does he say dude?

793
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:22,424
Hey, what is this rash driving?

794
00:56:22,715 --> 00:56:24,132
I am to take Padmasri...

795
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,090
Padmasri?

796
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,632
That is given to celebrities right?

797
00:56:27,257 --> 00:56:27,799
Hello...

798
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:29,965
they do not give Padmasri to celebrity

799
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:32,132
but one becomes a celebrity after giving that

800
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,340
Get to know first about award concept and then talk

801
00:56:34,882 --> 00:56:36,049
My foot
Who are they?

802
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:37,549
My Girl friend

803
00:56:38,382 --> 00:56:39,215
She is unconscious becoming weak.

804
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:44,132
And that fellow took a lift just like you
and is fallen unconscious

805
00:56:44,424 --> 00:56:46,299
Why not spread the cots so that
they would have slept happily.

806
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,799
What is your work?

807
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:50,299
Contract job

808
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:53,424
Where should you go?

809
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:56,799
No need of the destination for a nature lover,

810
00:56:58,299 --> 00:56:59,799
it is all about journey dude

811
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,257
What boy, looks like you are in some confusion?

812
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:04,924
Nothing sir

813
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:08,632
I found an item like the Kohinoor diamond
and thinking what to do with that?

814
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:09,840
Sell it off immediately

815
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:11,007
What was that?

816
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:12,340
I am saying to sell it off immediately,

817
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:14,465
if not some British may come and loot that

818
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,882
Boss, I am relaxed a lot

819
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:19,465
Hey, steering...

820
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,882
I am to take Padmasri

821
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,049
Will you have a cigarette

822
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:25,215
No habit sir

823
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:26,299
I have the habit

824
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:30,882
There is a good spark in you

825
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:31,882
I have a small work

826
00:57:32,424 --> 00:57:34,174
I have no work
Help me a bit

827
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:36,090
Then move on
Ok, move on

828
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,174
Boss, time for you to help me is come.

829
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:51,965
Get down

830
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:53,757
What my boy?

831
00:57:54,215 --> 00:57:55,090
Get down and I will say

832
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,174
Just help to carry this fellow

833
00:58:05,007 --> 00:58:06,882
What is the concept?
Carry this guy first

834
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,882
What is he eating, he is weighing so much?

835
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,174
Boss, this fellow is slipping

836
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,882
Wait for three seconds and I will get the rope

837
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,882
I will not have a pep when there is no perfection in work

838
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:33,090
What is this fellow so typical?
I wish to know about him.

839
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:36,840
Ok, why are you tying him to the tree saying to give a lift?

840
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,840
You are not opening the concept to me.

841
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:41,007
Hello, why are you not in live?

842
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,007
That is...
You will tell my foot...

843
00:58:43,465 --> 00:58:45,882
He would tell me, let me wake him up.
Hey..

844
00:58:49,882 --> 00:58:50,590
Who are you?

845
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:52,424
I will kill you

846
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:55,299
You tied as a precaution that he would shout right?

847
00:58:55,382 --> 00:58:56,049
Yes

848
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,590
Say dude, you say now.

849
00:58:58,007 --> 00:59:00,132
Say, I will listen with clarity. Say...

850
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:04,799
Idiot, are you any PA to Trump or King of Mysore...

851
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:05,840
You idiot...

852
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,424
Boss, he will die

853
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:10,007
What is his concept?

854
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:12,049
Concept later, first give the phone

855
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,799
You gave lift and I gave phone, carry on...

856
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:20,674
why are you putting hands in his pant pocket?

857
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,340
For number boss.
Okay.

858
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:25,049
You do not think of anything
and everything would go on well

859
00:59:25,674 --> 00:59:27,174
We see all the issues

860
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:28,674
Hey, see whose is this?

861
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:32,799
Hello, is Bhanumati Devi madam there?

862
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:34,965
Madam is in meeting

863
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:36,257
Who are you bro?

864
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:37,757
I am Masthan speaking

865
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:38,882
What is the matter?

866
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:41,424
I have a guy you wanted

867
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,132
Who is he?

868
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:44,340
Pratap Reddy, bro

869
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,424
What are you talking?

870
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,549
True bro, I found that fellow.

871
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:49,340
I just kept him tied to a tree right here

872
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:50,674
How to believe?

873
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,215
Boss, take off that cloth from his mouth

874
00:59:55,382 --> 00:59:57,215
Talk with the Doctor
Talk to Masthan

875
00:59:57,632 --> 01:00:00,465
Hey Masthan, you will die if you come

876
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:03,132
Hey, are you so mad? Will you kill the Doctor?

877
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,090
Where are you?

878
01:00:05,757 --> 01:00:06,674
Say one thing bro

879
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:10,090
You said to give ten crores either
by handing over or killing Pratap Reddy

880
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:12,215
Is it true or a joke?

881
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:13,882
It is true, where shall I come?

882
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:18,090
There is a village named Rangapur after crossing
Mahabub Nagar on your way

883
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:19,924
Come there and call bro

884
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:21,882
Ok, we are starting right away

885
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,715
Who is the mad guy giving ten crores for this mad fellow?

886
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,007
What is the concept?

887
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:40,049
To know the concept, you should first know about him

888
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,965
What is to know about him? He is a mad fellow, right?

889
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,799
Who is the factionist making both the states shiver?

890
01:00:46,465 --> 01:00:48,257
Who else, Pratap Reddy and he is jail now.

891
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,132
What... That means...
I will show you the visuals

892
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:01,257
That is it boss...

893
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,465
His bad luck and our luck. He is caught to us.

894
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,007
As we are good guys,

895
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:07,965
we are just handing him over to them
for ten crores instead of killing.

896
01:01:08,507 --> 01:01:09,215
This is the concept.

897
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:10,632
Why do you say we?

898
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:12,840
You did everything and why are you involving him?

899
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:13,799
I am leaving.

900
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:14,507
Wait boss,

901
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:17,299
total concept and design is yours for this entire scene.

902
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:20,299
Why do you leave in the middle?
Just cooperate a bit.

903
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:22,632
Are you into any freedom fight to cooperate?

904
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:23,965
I do not need this mess

905
01:01:24,382 --> 01:01:28,424
Go, it seems that Mastan is coming with
a hundred guys in great anger.

906
01:01:28,715 --> 01:01:30,132
He would come near and call to you

907
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:31,965
and you reply saying not here but somewhere else.

908
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:33,757
He would come there and chop you down.

909
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,465
Why did you fix me like this? What to do now?

910
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:37,340
You should wait

911
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:42,799
You said no habit?

912
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:46,590
I do not smoke regularly.
Smoking as I am into tension

913
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:48,590
You sell humans and why tension for you?

914
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,465
I unnecessarily certified you as sensitive

915
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:51,215
Come on quiet!

916
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:53,340
That fellow is coming with a hundred guys.

917
01:01:53,715 --> 01:01:54,882
This fellow alone is equal to hundred guys.

918
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,382
I am thinking how to manage these two

919
01:01:57,549 --> 01:01:58,257
How ?

920
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,840
That Masthan will come, we will give this fellow.

921
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,132
He would give us ten crores.

922
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:04,299
We will leave with the bag
and he will finish this fellow. Simple!

923
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:07,965
Money first and the guy only after that.

924
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,590
There should be a clarity in what we do.

925
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:11,132
Boss! You are back

926
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:13,049
See to that he does not backstab us.

927
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:16,049
Come on boos, he will be gone in an hour
and what will he do?

928
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:19,007
Ok, you think they really finish this guy?

929
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:19,590
Let us do one thing.

930
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:21,632
Wait for some time and we can see a murder in live

931
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:24,340
Will they play with him paying ten crores,
if not crazy by you?

932
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:26,257
Correct!

933
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,590
What if the girl in car wakes up now?

934
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:32,340
Point boss!

935
01:02:35,049 --> 01:02:35,840
Boss
Yes

936
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:39,299
You were just having a drink,
shall I bring something to snacks?

937
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,257
Will you leave him to me and go to bring sancks?

938
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,424
It is a sin to make a nature lover suffer.

939
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:45,299
Even the five elements will take revenge on you.

940
01:02:45,757 --> 01:02:48,132
You kept it in mind that
I got into the car without asking right?

941
01:02:55,924 --> 01:02:56,840
Safe for an hour

942
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,674
Boss, why do you look to be in a deep thought?

943
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:01,799
Nothing dude,

944
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:05,340
I want to capture face expression
of this guy dying in an hour

945
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:06,924
Why late, go on

946
01:03:13,174 --> 01:03:15,424
Hey, why do you move when I am shooting?

947
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:18,007
Hey, yours is a good photogenic face

948
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,215
No need of filters too.

949
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:22,882
If I show these photos to Rajamouli,
you are the villain in Bahubali 3.

950
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:26,840
He will not listen like this...

951
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:37,299
Hey, if I go mad will not wait
even till that Masthan fellow arrives

952
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,715
You know what is your deal?

953
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,549
Live or dead ten crores!

954
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,132
I will cut you like a chicken

955
01:03:45,757 --> 01:03:46,924
Will that Masthan fellow not come?

956
01:03:48,965 --> 01:03:49,507
Phone from that guy

957
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:52,215
Hey mental, your death bell rang

958
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,924
The born has to die and the dead has to be reborn

959
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,799
No egos to be had in the matter which is mandatory

960
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,632
Hey mental, happy journey.

961
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,549
Pratap Reddy, bye

962
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:33,340
Where?
Here

963
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:41,132
Where is he?

964
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:43,049
Boss, ask whether he brought the money or not?

965
01:04:43,215 --> 01:04:45,340
Why not you ask?
I thought you would be like an elder

966
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,549
Where is the money?

967
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,382
My boss is asking right, where is the money?

968
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:51,340
What is boss newly?

969
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:53,007
I felt build up would be better

970
01:04:53,674 --> 01:04:54,757
Have you used for a buildup?

971
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:56,424
Show the money..

972
01:04:57,132 --> 01:04:58,174
Come on give

973
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:04,924
Say them to put the money inside

974
01:05:05,424 --> 01:05:06,132
Why not you say?

975
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:09,049
You are the boss master, ask them

976
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,049
Put that money in the dickey

977
01:05:22,257 --> 01:05:25,424
Hey, you are acting at me and directing greatly

978
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:28,465
We gave the money right? Where is that fellow?

979
01:05:29,632 --> 01:05:30,507
He is at that tree

980
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,674
You are super boss, come on we will leave

981
01:05:35,257 --> 01:05:36,132
Move on guys

982
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,549
Hey Kill him ?

983
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,757
I am still surprised Balu,
how did we sell that Pratap Reddy?

984
01:06:58,674 --> 01:07:01,090
Is what they paid, a real money?

985
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:02,632
Boss, do not bring in a new confusion

986
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:05,007
Still, if this was said before
we would have taken a counting machine right?

987
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,007
Balu, how will someone sell co-human
to another human?

988
01:07:09,174 --> 01:07:11,424
Looks like you are in a confused
state of surprise and wonder

989
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:12,507
What?

990
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,132
I understood that you have
no command in Telugu language

991
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:22,007
Masthan! He may again say a party

992
01:07:22,257 --> 01:07:23,882
We shall say drink and drive on highway is wrong.

993
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:25,924
We shall not encourage such. Come on talk

994
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,007
Hello!

995
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:31,382
Brother, a mistake has taken place

996
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,924
He escaped and ran away

997
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:36,174
You dirty fellow...

998
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:39,007
It is not saying revenge on TV,
why so much to kill just one fellow...

999
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,007
You took 25 guys right?

1000
01:07:41,215 --> 01:07:45,382
Hey, not all these but be careful till he is killed.

1001
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:46,549
Balu, what happened?

1002
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:49,799
What happened? That Pratap Reddy escaped

1003
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:52,757
How is that?

1004
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,382
How? You hit on his leg and he slipped

1005
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:58,174
Later you said shot was great.

1006
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:03,757
He sat right there, untied himself, cut throats of others
and came on to the highway it seems

1007
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:05,090
We both are the balance now

1008
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,799
What boss, not talking anything?

1009
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:14,007
Boss, shall we have a chilled beer?

1010
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,382
What happened, Balu?

1011
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,798
What happened? Half is over...

1012
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,565
Has Satya taken food?
Yes, she had

1013
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,523
Hello..

1014
01:08:35,815 --> 01:08:36,732
where is baby?

1015
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:38,648
Her phone is out of reach

1016
01:08:39,773 --> 01:08:42,565
Today is her birthday, right madam,
May she is been for film with friends.

1017
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:46,232
Ok, ask her to call once she is back

1018
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:47,190
Ok madam

1019
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,565
I should speak with Bhanumati madam

1020
01:08:58,106 --> 01:09:00,106
Can you not see her talking? Be seated

1021
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,606
Ok madam
See you madam

1022
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:10,565
Hello Bhanumati Devi madam

1023
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,023
Hello

1024
01:09:17,315 --> 01:09:19,398
I think you love the public very much.

1025
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:22,440
You are not caring even when elders of big party have come.

1026
01:09:23,273 --> 01:09:24,231
Say the matter

1027
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:26,814
You might be aware.

1028
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,940
Pratap Reddy in jail is coming out on good behaviour

1029
01:09:31,398 --> 01:09:36,273
You will definitely need the support
of our party at this time is what we opine

1030
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:39,481
It will be known who needs right?

1031
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:45,607
You will have that much saying my people.

1032
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,648
Once he is out, he would first attack that public.

1033
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:52,190
Then he will attack over you.

1034
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:55,190
Are you not frightened when thought of it?

1035
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:03,314
We know how to safeguard ourselves.

1036
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,898
You can leave.

1037
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:27,648
Say about that fear to that fellow.

1038
01:10:28,773 --> 01:10:34,940
Because court may give a mercy but not this Seema.

1039
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:38,314
The next moment he steps in...

1040
01:11:14,106 --> 01:11:16,773
Brother, what happened that you are here?

1041
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:18,898
The people are not aware that you came.

1042
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:22,148
My farm house is just beside,
we shall go there and talk. Get up first brother.

1043
01:11:25,856 --> 01:11:34,523
TS 07 PN 7777, a girl and two gents...

1044
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:37,106
I want them...

1045
01:11:37,148 --> 01:11:39,148
Get up first brother.

1046
01:11:42,856 --> 01:11:45,523
What, a chase for slapping?

1047
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:48,523
No problem, I am on long drive with you right?

1048
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,315
Balu, who is sir?

1049
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,940
Sir! He is Maddy R and is of international range

1050
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,815
He is great man from Discovery channel
and the compass to guide our way

1051
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,939
He is Lord Hanuman to get us out of danger

1052
01:12:01,398 --> 01:12:03,940
This is not like praising
but scolding in a filthy language

1053
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:07,023
Balu, stop

1054
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:19,398
Balu, I will leave

1055
01:12:19,648 --> 01:12:20,523
How will you go?

1056
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,607
I will take some Lorry of Rajasthan and go

1057
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,648
Is the total risk mine? Do you not have it?

1058
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,565
What risk? You sold and took money

1059
01:12:28,023 --> 01:12:29,898
You said us till now and why do you change the talk now?

1060
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:34,773
You know the whole and
sole responsibility for all this to happen is you?

1061
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:38,064
You gave the idea to sell that Pratap Reddy,
you gave certificate that he is mad

1062
01:12:38,398 --> 01:12:40,606
and gave a third degree treatment
too tying him to the tree.

1063
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,357
You know how pity did
I feel when you were hitting him?

1064
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:45,940
Hey, are you hypnotizing me?

1065
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,273
Come on boss, give your phone once
Who again?

1066
01:12:48,523 --> 01:12:51,023
There is a great man Raghunandan Yadav
by name in Hyderabad, give it

1067
01:12:51,356 --> 01:12:53,689
Then, you speak only with great guys
and not with ordinary people?

1068
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:54,689
Do not frustrate and give the phone

1069
01:13:00,106 --> 01:13:05,606
99483... Bapu, I am unable to remember your number

1070
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,482
What should you speak so urgently?

1071
01:13:08,231 --> 01:13:11,939
We have that parcel right?
We shall find out which way should it be taken

1072
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:14,065
What parcel, is she not your lover?

1073
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:16,064
She is my client.
Client?

1074
01:13:16,273 --> 01:13:18,190
She has some threat and I am kept as her bodyguard

1075
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:19,981
You know it is a loss of two lakhs for me if she misses out?

1076
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:23,940
Why all these for me, does she know about this contract?

1077
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:28,731
some attack happened over her
and we came here escaping that

1078
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:31,439
Oh no, big story has run

1079
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:34,439
Boss, she is missing. Come, we shall go and search

1080
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:35,773
Huh, this again for me...

1081
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:47,523
Thank you
Give money

1082
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:50,565
Who is he?

1083
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:56,773
Why so much love on me dear?

1084
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:29,648
What I thought and felt in the heart,
I found in the eyes

1085
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:39,482
What is found in the eyes is written over the lips

1086
01:14:39,815 --> 01:14:44,898
Does this wind know you, this fragrance of flowers

1087
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:49,648
Do these flowers know dreams,
your smile is on every flower

1088
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:54,564
What is the name of this feeling
and what is this heart not stopping?

1089
01:14:54,648 --> 01:14:59,440
What is this stumbling word
and what is the language for the silence?

1090
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:43,315
Will you not come as rain drop to drench naughtily for me?

1091
01:15:43,523 --> 01:15:48,106
Shall I drop in as flying cloud making Sky as witness?

1092
01:15:48,148 --> 01:15:53,065
Hey my life, you moved me
who was without feelings

1093
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:57,981
Have you come to me my heart,
do you know this is true?

1094
01:15:58,356 --> 01:16:02,689
Everything is a celebration when you are here

1095
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:07,523
Shall I be as the earth in your steps?

1096
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:12,981
What is the name of this feeling
and what is this heart not stopping?

1097
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:17,982
What is this stumbling word
and what is the language for the silence?

1098
01:17:02,648 --> 01:17:07,315
Has the dirty night has seen in sedation towards us?

1099
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:12,273
Hey moonlight on earth, shall I share good feelings?

1100
01:17:12,315 --> 01:17:17,107
I have no shiver with you, I observed it my love

1101
01:17:17,148 --> 01:17:22,231
You made me shiver so in the cold of your looks

1102
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:26,648
Cover me so like the fire

1103
01:17:27,273 --> 01:17:31,690
Shall I put down the heat with your signals?

1104
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:37,231
What is the name of this feeling
and what is this heart not stopping?

1105
01:17:37,315 --> 01:17:42,148
What is this stumbling word
and what is the language for the silence?

1106
01:17:55,106 --> 01:17:56,648
What dear, a dream?

1107
01:17:58,648 --> 01:18:01,148
Have you seen uncle, how much he loves me?

1108
01:18:01,981 --> 01:18:03,523
He is mad about me uncle.

1109
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:06,190
He is into tension if I am missing even for a second

1110
01:18:06,273 --> 01:18:08,981
Tension is not about you, but over the money he gets

1111
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:11,523
It seems your people gave him a contract to save you

1112
01:18:12,023 --> 01:18:15,356
Hello, did you still not understand?
He is your body guard

1113
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:18,565
He brought you here by making you escape
when an attack happened over you

1114
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,982
Have you come as bodyguard for money?

1115
01:18:25,856 --> 01:18:26,939
Are you not in love with me?

1116
01:18:29,606 --> 01:18:30,439
I hate you

1117
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:36,482
What is it Balu, why do you not say
anything when she is scolded and leaving?

1118
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:39,523
When someone makes me frustrated while
I get this urgently, face will be like this.

1119
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:40,648
Come on go behind her
I will

1120
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:44,898
Madam, my money
What money?

1121
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,857
Ice cream money sir

1122
01:18:49,023 --> 01:18:49,731
Where is they?

1123
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:01,565
To hell with this life...

1124
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,339
He is not that guy father in law...

1125
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,464
Will you give the money, sir?
Hey, stop

1126
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:23,798
Hello sir.

1127
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:25,589
Where is that fellow?

1128
01:19:25,923 --> 01:19:27,255
He is gone aside for peeing sir

1129
01:19:27,714 --> 01:19:29,922
We did not get at that time
and thus came here sir

1130
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:35,048
Hello, what about the money?

1131
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:39,922
Why could you not say that before itself?
Why so much build up for that?

1132
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:41,548
What is the business here?

1133
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:44,215
My business is losing there.
I will leave if my 100 is given

1134
01:19:44,339 --> 01:19:44,964
Oh no!

1135
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,673
Will you die for a hundred, idiot?
Go from here. Go

1136
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,839
Sir, forgive me sir.

1137
01:19:52,798 --> 01:19:54,755
He is new Sir, he does not know this story sir

1138
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,255
Who knows here?

1139
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:58,590
Hey, where is that guy?

1140
01:19:58,755 --> 01:20:01,589
Sir, there is a great man named
Raghunandan in Hyderabad.

1141
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,048
He took my cell for calling him.

1142
01:20:04,505 --> 01:20:07,005
If you make a call and say we are here, he will come

1143
01:20:07,173 --> 01:20:07,923
Say the number

1144
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:12,797
Say Pratap darling...

1145
01:20:14,464 --> 01:20:20,505
If your partner and girlfriend are to be alive,
come and die with the money

1146
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,548
Ok, I will come and die.

1147
01:20:25,005 --> 01:20:27,548
Take care that no harm happens to baby till I come

1148
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,214
Brother, shall I cut a chicken for lunch?

1149
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:33,422
I will cut like a chicken

1150
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,380
Sir, a hundred concepts are running in the mind.

1151
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:41,423
I am unable to bear this tension.
Unable to bear sir...

1152
01:20:41,673 --> 01:20:44,380
Please sir, I beg you. Kill sir

1153
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:46,339
Stay back, hey come to a side

1154
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,089
What is your story?
What have you all done together to my son in law?

1155
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:52,548
Sir, I am a nature lover.

1156
01:20:53,255 --> 01:20:56,964
While traveling in car,
it gave trouble and got into his car accidentally

1157
01:20:58,089 --> 01:21:00,422
Sir coincidentally was
unconscious backside in the car sir

1158
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:06,298
He without any mercy tied sir to a tree
and sold to Masthan for 10 crores

1159
01:21:07,589 --> 01:21:08,755
Our sir is great!

1160
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,714
He immediately killed the enemies
and made us come here

1161
01:21:12,048 --> 01:21:14,340
Oh no, do you know whom have you sold?

1162
01:21:14,589 --> 01:21:15,464
Pratap Reddy!

1163
01:21:15,839 --> 01:21:16,964
He sold knowing that sir

1164
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,298
Do not say anywhere, it is an insult for us

1165
01:21:19,548 --> 01:21:21,965
Is this any Epic to say and move around sir?

1166
01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:26,214
Look, there is no mistake from you in
what has happened and why are you asking to kill?

1167
01:21:27,423 --> 01:21:30,048
That is... narration was mine right sir?
I said in favor of me.

1168
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,548
What exactly happened was...

1169
01:21:32,548 --> 01:21:34,755
Hey mental, your death bell rang

1170
01:21:34,964 --> 01:21:37,672
The born has to die and the dead has to be reborn

1171
01:21:37,964 --> 01:21:39,589
Hey, yours is a good photogenic face

1172
01:21:40,714 --> 01:21:42,547
Oh no, it is your luck that you are still alive.

1173
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:44,005
How much more time do I have sir?

1174
01:21:44,298 --> 01:21:45,548
Till he is back, that is it

1175
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:47,298
Keshava, did you get the line?

1176
01:21:50,755 --> 01:21:51,673
No brother

1177
01:21:51,839 --> 01:21:56,047
Look, it seems that girl is caught right?
Where did they keep? Call them

1178
01:21:57,048 --> 01:21:58,340
I need her father in law

1179
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:02,630
A revenge of 14 years

1180
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,048
I should wash in the village borders and step in

1181
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,214
But son in law,

1182
01:22:10,423 --> 01:22:13,255
knowing that you came out in advance

1183
01:22:14,339 --> 01:22:20,589
Bhanumati sent Masthan over you means
maybe plan you thought will not work out.

1184
01:22:21,005 --> 01:22:21,880
What to do now?

1185
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:26,214
If she knew this matter, she will not send his guy.

1186
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:28,714
She would directly come in

1187
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:34,798
I will take care of her, search where the girl is

1188
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,214
Baby...
What?

1189
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:39,090
They are torturing us so much
just meeting accidentally means

1190
01:22:39,964 --> 01:22:42,922
if that girl they are searching
for is caught, what would be her condition?

1191
01:22:45,214 --> 01:22:47,589
Uncle, I should say you a matter

1192
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,048
What?

1193
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:50,214
Where is your heart?
Here

1194
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:53,339
Hold it tight
I caught

1195
01:22:55,964 --> 01:22:59,172
The girl they are searching is, me

1196
01:23:01,673 --> 01:23:02,965
What are these twists, oh God?

1197
01:23:04,005 --> 01:23:07,005
What is the revenge in between you and those?

1198
01:23:07,298 --> 01:23:10,090
That is a long story, shall I say?

1199
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:13,089
I am dead listening to stories
from when I got into the car

1200
01:23:14,505 --> 01:23:19,005
Leave all these, how are you talking
so daringly sitting opposite to him?

1201
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:22,089
Dare is Balu right uncle?

1202
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,923
There... Balu has come

1203
01:23:34,798 --> 01:23:36,715
Brother, shall I kill?

1204
01:23:37,714 --> 01:23:42,380
Leave him for five minutes to me.
Before killing he should be introduced to fear

1205
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:45,839
He should know the need of death

1206
01:23:53,255 --> 01:23:53,755
Balu...

1207
01:23:54,339 --> 01:23:56,547
3 Minutes, I will take you in three minutes

1208
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,755
You will die in five minutes
and how would you take in 3 minutes?

1209
01:24:00,048 --> 01:24:03,255
Does anybody here hitting me know the story?

1210
01:24:03,298 --> 01:24:05,048
None knows the story here

1211
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:11,630
Then, shall we personally
speak for three minutes or...

1212
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:16,130
We will talk personally... Please come

1213
01:24:18,339 --> 01:24:21,380
Look boy, how will you take in three minutes?

1214
01:24:22,048 --> 01:24:23,548
I too thought the same father in law.

1215
01:24:23,714 --> 01:24:25,839
Father in law even for you?

1216
01:24:26,005 --> 01:24:26,714
Yes, it is so...

1217
01:24:27,298 --> 01:24:32,673
I thought how to take from when you called.
I did not get even one idea.

1218
01:24:33,589 --> 01:24:35,755
It takes 20 minutes to reach this location.

1219
01:24:36,089 --> 01:24:37,255
But it took 30 minutes for me.

1220
01:24:37,423 --> 01:24:39,173
Why?
Listen

1221
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:43,505
I felt uneasy while coming.
I stopped in between and had a tea

1222
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,714
Still did not understand.
Are you saying us stories?

1223
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:48,880
You look to be in a hurry.

1224
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,255
Some kids were playing Cricket and I joined them.

1225
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:55,047
Out..

1226
01:24:55,214 --> 01:24:57,422
I was bowled on the very first ball

1227
01:24:57,964 --> 01:24:59,547
and then I remembered words by our Bapu

1228
01:24:59,839 --> 01:25:04,380
He said we should not just think from our side
but also from the views of the opposite too.

1229
01:25:04,964 --> 01:25:08,422
There was not even 1% chance from my side

1230
01:25:08,505 --> 01:25:09,339
Yes...

1231
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,089
Thus I thought from your end and got a wonderful weapon

1232
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:12,715
What is that?

1233
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:15,048
Ego, you fellow has that in tons

1234
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:17,630
Added are over actions and I used that

1235
01:25:18,005 --> 01:25:20,005
How did you use that?
Switch on the TV once father in law

1236
01:25:23,423 --> 01:25:25,005
Pratap Reddy is a sensation

1237
01:25:25,298 --> 01:25:27,630
and here is a sensational news about such Pratap Reddy

1238
01:25:28,048 --> 01:25:35,048
A stranger called to our studio saying he has a
sensational news about Pratap releasing tomorrow

1239
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:39,005
We will be before you in some time about
what that news is and the details about that

1240
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:43,089
You to be released
28th came out today using your brains

1241
01:25:43,423 --> 01:25:44,923
You were caught to me because of your bad fate.

1242
01:25:45,214 --> 01:25:46,505
I sold you off because of my luck

1243
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:49,130
You to be dead came out killing them

1244
01:25:49,964 --> 01:25:51,589
Have you straight gone home
feeling happy to be alive?

1245
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:54,714
No, you had a meeting in between
at Mahabubnagar and messed with me

1246
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:58,464
I get frustrated messing with me.
Will I be silent?

1247
01:25:59,214 --> 01:26:00,714
I will disturb all

1248
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:01,673
How?

1249
01:26:02,048 --> 01:26:02,965
You ask how?

1250
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:06,589
I will call TV9 and say
Pratap darling is not in jail but with me.

1251
01:26:06,798 --> 01:26:07,673
They would say how,

1252
01:26:07,923 --> 01:26:09,880
I have the visuals taken by my Guruji right?

1253
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:13,965
I will send them by WhatsApp.

1254
01:26:14,005 --> 01:26:14,923
I have already seen those

1255
01:26:14,964 --> 01:26:17,047
Is it enough that you see them alone?
All should watch right?

1256
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:17,589
Oh no

1257
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:19,130
Then starts the frustration for all

1258
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:24,089
And then our Pratap darling will have same cell,
same bed and same jail food

1259
01:26:25,464 --> 01:26:29,130
For all these not to happen,
my frustration should come down

1260
01:26:29,923 --> 01:26:30,548
What shall we do?

1261
01:26:30,798 --> 01:26:33,130
Son in law, let us first send this guy from here

1262
01:26:33,464 --> 01:26:34,214
You are super father in law...

1263
01:26:35,298 --> 01:26:37,630
Words of your mouth have come from father in law

1264
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,214
You are a clever guy Pratap darling, shall I leave?

1265
01:26:45,173 --> 01:26:46,798
Sir..let's continue the journey.

1266
01:26:47,339 --> 01:26:49,505
Sir, there would be a hundred things in a party.

1267
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:52,089
Do not have any of these in mind sir.
We are all one.

1268
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:55,589
Hey...

1269
01:26:57,964 --> 01:27:00,130
You may escape from death this moment.

1270
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:03,673
But, that will always be chasing you

1271
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,380
Till you die

1272
01:27:06,548 --> 01:27:07,423
All the best

1273
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:12,714
Brother, phone of Bullireddy got connected

1274
01:27:15,423 --> 01:27:16,005
Say Bulli

1275
01:27:16,048 --> 01:27:20,965
That watch dog and niece of Bhanumati escaped
and are coming towards Kurnool

1276
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,505
I am sending the photos

1277
01:27:32,255 --> 01:27:33,339
Hey, go and catch

1278
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,005
Come on go..

1279
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:46,755
Hey, come on fast..

1280
01:27:53,339 --> 01:27:55,672
I cannot bear with these chase my God, I will jump

1281
01:28:00,464 --> 01:28:01,339
Why do you see so dude?

1282
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:04,298
He is youth and it would not work out for our age

1283
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:09,173
Are we saying hello to death
or is the death saying us hello?

1284
01:28:09,339 --> 01:28:11,464
No Guruji, we are cleverly escaping

1285
01:28:14,339 --> 01:28:15,505
Take out a bundle from that

1286
01:28:18,589 --> 01:28:19,755
Yes, I took out
Throw it out

1287
01:28:20,798 --> 01:28:22,755
Why do you stare at me so?
I said to throw that out, right?

1288
01:28:35,423 --> 01:28:36,923
we are getting caught because of this dirty car

1289
01:28:48,464 --> 01:28:49,464
Will she not come?

1290
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:51,589
Here she is... Come dear

1291
01:28:52,798 --> 01:28:54,505
Which way shall we go Guruji?
Right

1292
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,339
I think left is better

1293
01:28:57,505 --> 01:29:00,714
I pray you dude, first take us out somewhere from here

1294
01:29:00,839 --> 01:29:03,505
I cannot walk even straight
Should I carry her now or what?

1295
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:08,839
Hey, for the torture you both are giving me,
I will commit suicide writing down your names

1296
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:09,798
You wait a while uncle,

1297
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:12,880
there are many accounts to settle with him

1298
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:14,589
You move aside

1299
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,255
This will not settle any faster, I will leave

1300
01:29:16,423 --> 01:29:16,880
Guruji...

1301
01:29:16,923 --> 01:29:19,005
Oh no, please stop your Nandi acting

1302
01:29:19,214 --> 01:29:21,130
You introduced all the goons around saying me as Guruji

1303
01:29:21,173 --> 01:29:22,715
Will you please move aside
I will go madam

1304
01:29:23,048 --> 01:29:24,090
Guruji
Hey, go dude

1305
01:29:24,298 --> 01:29:25,465
Where will you go, idiot?

1306
01:29:27,089 --> 01:29:29,464
Say, do you not love me?

1307
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,089
No

1308
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,089
Saving me now
My duty

1309
01:29:36,298 --> 01:29:37,840
Oh no!

1310
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,130
Look into my eyes and say

1311
01:29:42,714 --> 01:29:43,505
Why should I see?

1312
01:29:44,548 --> 01:29:47,090
I hate touching and loving, stay away

1313
01:29:47,964 --> 01:29:48,714
You hate
Yes

1314
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,423
Shall I be away
Yes

1315
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:52,297
How far?

1316
01:29:53,173 --> 01:29:53,673
This much...

1317
01:29:54,339 --> 01:29:55,089
This much...

1318
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:58,505
This much... Is this ok?

1319
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:20,839
Is it for me?

1320
01:31:25,173 --> 01:31:26,880
Why did you stop? Hit!

1321
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:28,630
No problem, hit.

1322
01:31:29,423 --> 01:31:31,340
I will at least think you showed your love like that

1323
01:31:31,714 --> 01:31:34,130
What exactly is your problem?
Why so much ego for you?

1324
01:31:34,464 --> 01:31:35,880
It is all because I am falling behind you right?

1325
01:31:38,255 --> 01:31:41,048
If not say me how shall I say so that you understand?

1326
01:31:41,298 --> 01:31:42,630
You please speak up

1327
01:31:44,048 --> 01:31:44,630
Come, we will go

1328
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,673
I will not come, I will sit right here

1329
01:31:47,214 --> 01:31:48,880
Move
Rascal, leave

1330
01:31:55,173 --> 01:31:58,673
Madam, come in once madam

1331
01:31:58,755 --> 01:32:00,589
Move on...you come.

1332
01:32:01,714 --> 01:32:03,547
We all will die if you dry with a sleeping face

1333
01:32:03,714 --> 01:32:06,464
Who are you and why are you sitting here?

1334
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:08,130
I shall urgently go to Hyderabad

1335
01:32:08,839 --> 01:32:09,339
Oh, money?

1336
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:10,423
I will give

1337
01:32:11,464 --> 01:32:13,714
Here..
Here, keep it in the locket

1338
01:32:14,755 --> 01:32:16,964
You can go to Hyderabad,
but it is difficult if you say urgent

1339
01:32:17,714 --> 01:32:18,547
How did I say dude?

1340
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:20,505
Hey waste fellow, come on catch up...

1341
01:32:20,714 --> 01:32:24,797
Bheeshma lying on the arrow bed...
Hey, not lying but sleeping

1342
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:26,005
Something is fine sir

1343
01:32:29,089 --> 01:32:31,255
Hey, do not stop the bus. Go on, go on

1344
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,755
Who are you to say? I am the boss

1345
01:32:35,005 --> 01:32:36,255
Hey Krishna, stop the bus

1346
01:32:36,464 --> 01:32:37,047
Stop

1347
01:32:37,423 --> 01:32:38,548
Oh no, when said to apply the breaks...

1348
01:32:38,755 --> 01:32:40,255
Come sir, please come

1349
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:42,048
We will get 4000
You are super

1350
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,714
Come, give me the money

1351
01:32:44,755 --> 01:32:46,964
Guruji..What are you here?

1352
01:32:47,214 --> 01:32:48,964
Have I not said that Guruji will bring a vehicle for us?

1353
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:51,423
Are you all from the same batch?

1354
01:32:51,798 --> 01:32:53,255
What is the business?

1355
01:32:53,339 --> 01:32:54,547
That is...
I understood

1356
01:32:54,673 --> 01:32:56,755
The girl is beautiful and you look like a waste fellow

1357
01:32:56,964 --> 01:32:58,755
Both may have been in love and eloped together

1358
01:32:58,798 --> 01:33:00,215
Said great son in law

1359
01:33:00,255 --> 01:33:01,089
What is in the bag?

1360
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:01,630
That is..

1361
01:33:01,673 --> 01:33:03,965
What else other than the worn clothes and the ornaments

1362
01:33:04,173 --> 01:33:05,215
Is he too from your team?

1363
01:33:05,464 --> 01:33:07,005
He gave 2000 and said has to go to Hyderabad

1364
01:33:07,173 --> 01:33:09,798
I mean Guruji..
Understood, you need a waste fellow

1365
01:33:10,005 --> 01:33:12,339
You brought him for signature
when he was sitting without any work.

1366
01:33:12,423 --> 01:33:14,465
Hello, you know how to sign or a thumb impression?

1367
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:17,423
Hey, who do you think is Guruji?
He is a top photographer in Bombay.

1368
01:33:17,505 --> 01:33:19,005
You know the range is different when he touches?

1369
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:22,005
Wow, range is different if he touches?
No, she touched now

1370
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:26,548
Balu
Guruji

1371
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,089
This fellow is messing with our story
and is selling there

1372
01:33:29,798 --> 01:33:33,798
If he gets to know about our original story,
he would jump from the running bus and die

1373
01:33:33,923 --> 01:33:34,465
Hey, you stop...

1374
01:33:35,298 --> 01:33:36,965
Is it needed to put the guy giving lift into risk?

1375
01:33:37,005 --> 01:33:39,089
Why do you too say so Guruji?
Hey, what is that secret talks?

1376
01:33:39,255 --> 01:33:42,173
I mean, Guruji says that you may be an
artiste by the charm seen in your face

1377
01:33:42,214 --> 01:33:43,214
You said it great.

1378
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,255
Chittibabu Drama Company from Khammam,

1379
01:33:45,464 --> 01:33:46,964
but very famous even in Seema.

1380
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,880
I am Duryodhana cum proprietor,

1381
01:33:49,214 --> 01:33:51,130
he is Dharmaraju, he is Dussasan

1382
01:33:51,173 --> 01:33:51,673
Hello.

1383
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,380
The guy messing with me is Sakuni

1384
01:33:53,423 --> 01:33:56,340
and that lady messing you is Panchali.
Her name is Padma and is a great...

1385
01:33:57,005 --> 01:33:58,005
Guruji, your Padma is found

1386
01:33:58,589 --> 01:33:59,172
It's me.

1387
01:33:59,214 --> 01:34:02,130
This is not the Padma I need,
but Padmasri in photography

1388
01:34:03,423 --> 01:34:04,255
You stay calm

1389
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:07,714
Balu, I thought Drowpadi would be like Savitri

1390
01:34:07,839 --> 01:34:09,630
and what is she like Sunny Leone?

1391
01:34:10,089 --> 01:34:12,547
Son in law... What is the immediate duty?

1392
01:34:12,714 --> 01:34:15,464
You should shut and sleep as there is an hour of time.

1393
01:34:15,505 --> 01:34:16,005
Where?

1394
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:17,214
Where else, come on sleep

1395
01:34:17,339 --> 01:34:19,964
Krishna, I did not say you to sleep, you drive

1396
01:34:23,673 --> 01:34:25,590
Hey Kavya, did Aadya come there?

1397
01:34:25,714 --> 01:34:27,422
Hey, did her phone get connected?
No brother

1398
01:34:28,255 --> 01:34:29,089
Ok

1399
01:34:29,839 --> 01:34:31,339
She is not even been to Kavya it seems

1400
01:34:33,214 --> 01:34:36,047
Son, do you have any numbers of friends of Kavya?

1401
01:34:36,214 --> 01:34:37,589
I do not have numbers of anyone sister.

1402
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:38,964
Hey, say you did not take

1403
01:34:39,339 --> 01:34:41,297
There are so many at home
and does none have a responsibility?

1404
01:34:41,755 --> 01:34:44,255
We would think the girl going for
morning show to return home,

1405
01:34:44,298 --> 01:34:45,630
but will we think she would show us the first show?

1406
01:34:45,798 --> 01:34:47,840
Hey, how are you feeling like to sip the tea?

1407
01:34:50,298 --> 01:34:52,505
Where would she be?
How will I know?

1408
01:34:52,548 --> 01:34:53,173
You should know

1409
01:34:53,548 --> 01:34:56,755
Aadya went in the car along with
brother from the opposite house

1410
01:34:56,798 --> 01:34:57,965
How do you know?

1411
01:34:58,255 --> 01:35:00,714
I saw in the morning while going in the school bus

1412
01:35:01,548 --> 01:35:04,465
All of you be here,
I will see the end of that guy

1413
01:35:09,298 --> 01:35:10,798
Hey, why are you taking inside the house?
Stop ...

1414
01:35:13,964 --> 01:35:14,797
Get down.

1415
01:35:19,423 --> 01:35:22,215
Should make her play the role of Seetha once,
take her to forest and...

1416
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,380
Whose house did we come to?

1417
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:27,547
Go and ask them.

1418
01:35:35,255 --> 01:35:36,255
Do not forget 4000 sir

1419
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:38,590
It is like he is still in front of my eyes

1420
01:35:41,298 --> 01:35:43,215
Not before the eyes but we are in front of his cutout

1421
01:35:43,548 --> 01:35:47,130
Your sleep is not still down, we are dropped in his village

1422
01:35:48,298 --> 01:35:51,505
That means, have we come to Yamlok taking a U turn?

1423
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:56,589
Hey, what is this? Public is making a nuisance there

1424
01:35:56,714 --> 01:35:57,589
Leave about their nuisance...

1425
01:35:57,755 --> 01:36:01,089
Oh no, what is this? We called only 12
and why did 15 come?

1426
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,880
No chance that I pay those extra 3.

1427
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,965
Hello, these 3 are our relatives

1428
01:36:05,214 --> 01:36:08,089
Daughter of my sister, son of my brother,
they are in love.

1429
01:36:08,214 --> 01:36:09,672
They are not doing their marriage at home
and thus brought to get them married.

1430
01:36:09,714 --> 01:36:10,922
Why not do the marriage when they are in line?

1431
01:36:11,423 --> 01:36:13,255
I mean, our old fellow is allergic to relations.

1432
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:16,380
What I mean is...
Do not say anything

1433
01:36:16,464 --> 01:36:17,172
Balu..
Yes.

1434
01:36:17,673 --> 01:36:19,380
Brother, he is here because of bad fate.

1435
01:36:19,839 --> 01:36:22,255
If he enters the industry, would take over Kona Venkat

1436
01:36:22,714 --> 01:36:23,380
Who is he?

1437
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:24,048
Witness

1438
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:25,214
Witness or something else

1439
01:36:25,255 --> 01:36:26,673
Wow, great joke
Enough of your laughing,

1440
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,880
public is shouting there...
Come and get on to the stage

1441
01:36:28,923 --> 01:36:30,715
We are ready, having that is the only delay
What is it?

1442
01:36:30,755 --> 01:36:31,964
Color.
Oh color!

1443
01:36:32,048 --> 01:36:33,715
Hey drunkard Ramesh...Come.
Yes

1444
01:36:34,005 --> 01:36:36,130
Take all their luggage and throw it out
Why did you say so?

1445
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,214
He is a reverse guy and everything
should be said so to him

1446
01:36:38,298 --> 01:36:39,298
What about food then?

1447
01:36:40,548 --> 01:36:41,173
Uncle

1448
01:36:41,339 --> 01:36:43,797
(Song Playing)

1449
01:36:46,673 --> 01:36:47,173
Yes.

1450
01:36:47,298 --> 01:36:48,590
Can you give your phone for once?

1451
01:36:49,798 --> 01:36:52,798
Why do you request so much dear?
You are my niece.

1452
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,089
This phone is yours, take it

1453
01:36:55,714 --> 01:36:56,714
Thank you uncle

1454
01:36:57,339 --> 01:37:00,089
Why are you giving signals saying no...
Is she taking any of our property?

1455
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:03,255
What did babe ask? She asked for phone.
Where would she go giving it? She goes to a side

1456
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:05,047
It goes so when bad time starts
What, a punch?

1457
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:06,755
You have kept wrong time as your ring tone

1458
01:37:07,005 --> 01:37:07,964
and none can save you

1459
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:11,715
Do not stare for long,
you will die with your body bent

1460
01:37:11,798 --> 01:37:13,005
No, I am asking about who is the tailor

1461
01:37:13,755 --> 01:37:17,255
Come on say...
Say...

1462
01:37:17,673 --> 01:37:18,130
Say...

1463
01:37:18,298 --> 01:37:19,673
Come on call him
Take out the phone

1464
01:37:20,673 --> 01:37:22,465
Wow crazy sir,

1465
01:37:23,173 --> 01:37:26,173
though lived together for so long
I did not take his phone number

1466
01:37:27,505 --> 01:37:29,005
How?

1467
01:37:31,423 --> 01:37:32,380
Hello, who is this?

1468
01:37:32,839 --> 01:37:33,714
Hi father in law

1469
01:37:34,005 --> 01:37:34,839
Hey, Aadya

1470
01:37:35,089 --> 01:37:36,380
Where are you?
Put the speaker on

1471
01:37:38,005 --> 01:37:40,048
I already said right uncle? I have jumped away

1472
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,005
Hey, when did you say?
You and your dirty jokes...

1473
01:37:42,048 --> 01:37:43,340
You talk to her

1474
01:37:43,589 --> 01:37:44,380
Where are you dear?

1475
01:37:44,755 --> 01:37:46,923
I came to parlor with friends uncle

1476
01:37:47,173 --> 01:37:50,465
I will go to Sangeet of Kavya from here
and do not get tensed, ok?

1477
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:52,589
Call mother in law urgently, she is getting tensed.

1478
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:54,214
Ok uncle

1479
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:09,130
Hello
Hello mother in law

1480
01:38:09,755 --> 01:38:11,673
Baby, where are you?

1481
01:38:12,755 --> 01:38:14,880
You know I called so many times from the morning

1482
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,298
I mean, there is some problem
with the phone mother in law.

1483
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:19,798
I came out with friends.

1484
01:38:20,173 --> 01:38:22,173
Shall I call after I go to the Sangeet of Kavya?

1485
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:23,130
Ok dear

1486
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,464
Take care...

1487
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:26,589
Happy birth day.

1488
01:38:27,589 --> 01:38:29,255
I called to say this.

1489
01:38:30,048 --> 01:38:32,298
Thanks mother in law... Bye

1490
01:38:38,505 --> 01:38:39,339
How to do...

1491
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:42,964
Brother has come... Brother...

1492
01:38:43,005 --> 01:38:44,298
Where are you running idiot?

1493
01:38:44,714 --> 01:38:46,714
No! Hey, that fellow is arriving

1494
01:38:47,089 --> 01:38:49,380
I can see Guruji, no need of live commentary

1495
01:38:50,423 --> 01:38:52,215
What is this, why did brother not come?

1496
01:38:52,255 --> 01:38:54,130
No, he is on some other work

1497
01:38:54,173 --> 01:38:55,090
What other work?

1498
01:38:56,255 --> 01:39:01,880
Damn it, arranged this
program thinking brother would come...

1499
01:39:02,255 --> 01:39:04,548
He is talking something
Did you still not understand

1500
01:39:04,923 --> 01:39:07,090
He asked whether three came and he said yes.

1501
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:08,172
Have you seen that little finger?

1502
01:39:08,214 --> 01:39:09,589
That is our Aadya, me beside

1503
01:39:09,798 --> 01:39:11,923
and as you are the elder man for all of us
you are that middle finger

1504
01:39:12,839 --> 01:39:13,964
Hey, that fellow is coming this way

1505
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:16,255
Hey, get down the luggage

1506
01:39:16,298 --> 01:39:18,090
Guruji, make if you have any last call

1507
01:39:18,339 --> 01:39:20,214
Not the last but nothing else the
nature call will come now

1508
01:39:20,298 --> 01:39:22,840
Brother, why not taste some food and say?

1509
01:39:23,048 --> 01:39:24,630
Hey, are you still not ready?

1510
01:39:24,755 --> 01:39:27,589
Hey, why are you saying something
else when that fellow something else?

1511
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:30,005
I understood one thing.

1512
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:32,672
As I escaped without informing,
you have kept that in mind right?

1513
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,880
I from long wanted to do an experiment Guruji.
What is it?

1514
01:39:36,255 --> 01:39:37,839
Free translation and I tried that on you Guruji

1515
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,505
How is it.

1516
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,464
That means, a psychological murder?

1517
01:39:42,298 --> 01:39:43,840
Come on Guruji, let us go in

1518
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:47,699
Hail... To Sri Chittibabu Drama Company

1519
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,115
Not this bhajan, but do that make up

1520
01:39:49,157 --> 01:39:52,825
I am to take Padmasri and what is this?

1521
01:39:52,865 --> 01:39:53,449
What is the drama bro?

1522
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:55,491
Drowpadi Vasthrapaharanam

1523
01:39:55,575 --> 01:39:57,700
I have been watching that from childhood,
why not try something new?

1524
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,199
It is a super hit drama,

1525
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,490
still who would see if covered?
They would watch only when opened, right?

1526
01:40:02,407 --> 01:40:04,200
I will act, I will.
Ok you can act dear

1527
01:40:04,282 --> 01:40:05,615
She says to act right?

1528
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,157
Let us make her play Drowpadi
and her saree can be pulled

1529
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,075
Uncle...

1530
01:40:09,282 --> 01:40:12,240
Rascal, when my babe plays Drowpadi
you say to pull of her sari?

1531
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,241
We came till here as we got similarly connected

1532
01:40:14,365 --> 01:40:16,865
I see! You can play the role you like, my dear

1533
01:40:17,657 --> 01:40:18,490
Uncle,

1534
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,365
we shall roll sari to this guy and pull it off

1535
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:22,824
Hey, you go shave and come.

1536
01:40:22,907 --> 01:40:23,865
That means you are Dussashana

1537
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:24,575
Yes

1538
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:27,449
What about me then?
You can play Gandhari

1539
01:40:27,532 --> 01:40:29,615
She gets blindfolded and thus looks more good

1540
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:30,865
No double meaning in this, right?

1541
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,074
No

1542
01:40:32,115 --> 01:40:33,324
Come on search guys

1543
01:40:33,615 --> 01:40:35,032
Why are they following wherever we go?

1544
01:40:35,115 --> 01:40:36,740
His place and his house, it is his wish Guruji

1545
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,407
Still, we shall do something to hide from them.

1546
01:40:38,657 --> 01:40:39,740
They would kill if they see

1547
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,241
What character should I play and cover?

1548
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:43,157
Oh no, where do we get Drutharashtra as of now?

1549
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:44,657
Yes, I will play the role of Drutarashtra

1550
01:40:44,825 --> 01:40:46,075
But, no payment will be given

1551
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:47,324
Who needs your money?

1552
01:40:47,907 --> 01:40:49,657
If I happily close my eyes like blind, none can see me

1553
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,616
To hell with your over greed idiot

1554
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,740
To hell with your over greed idiot

1555
01:40:52,782 --> 01:40:53,865
Hey..who?

1556
01:40:54,365 --> 01:40:56,824
You will suit correctly for my cut out

1557
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:58,074
What cut out for even Drutarashtra?

1558
01:40:58,115 --> 01:40:59,240
Public will say get out

1559
01:40:59,282 --> 01:41:00,782
Correct.

1560
01:41:01,282 --> 01:41:02,282
What about your concept then?

1561
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:06,366
Wow, Balakrishnudu

1562
01:41:06,782 --> 01:41:09,740
Hail... To Sri Chittibabu Drama Company

1563
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:14,657
Parabrahmam...
Hey, you will have it, go...

1564
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,407
Bro Dussashana
Not needed

1565
01:41:21,032 --> 01:41:22,700
What is she, not letting me say my dialogue too

1566
01:41:23,575 --> 01:41:27,700
Hey Panchali, wife of five husbands! What is this?

1567
01:41:28,075 --> 01:41:29,907
It was good when enemies.

1568
01:41:30,615 --> 01:41:34,865
You make friends take me to
Mayasabha and insult making me go mad?

1569
01:41:35,115 --> 01:41:39,324
You laughed with all the teeth out
and made fun with your maids

1570
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:42,199
Come on laugh now opening up all your teeth

1571
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:45,157
In this full assembly in front of all these attending,

1572
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:48,491
this Suyodhana will insult you
by snatching away your sari

1573
01:41:48,865 --> 01:41:52,115
Come on bro, snatch that red border silk sari...

1574
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:54,907
Hey, Dussashana
Hey, what?

1575
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:58,282
What discussions again
for you guys losing in the cards game?

1576
01:41:58,532 --> 01:42:00,282
Why is he saying dialogue without script?

1577
01:42:00,325 --> 01:42:03,157
He is the owner and is changing as per his convenience

1578
01:42:03,365 --> 01:42:07,240
What are you into discussions?
Are you so great to oppose this Suyodhana?

1579
01:42:08,782 --> 01:42:10,575
What now, we shall pull the sari right?

1580
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:11,990
Why so much lag for that?

1581
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:13,616
It will be done if pulled...

1582
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:17,950
Do not be in a hurry Dussashana,
there is still time for that.

1583
01:42:19,075 --> 01:42:22,450
Audience do not have so much patience Sakuni uncle

1584
01:42:22,532 --> 01:42:24,450
When did you listen to me?

1585
01:42:26,075 --> 01:42:30,991
Guruva Reddy! Pass a word to
Kadapa Bireddy and Nandyal Nagireddy.

1586
01:42:31,325 --> 01:42:33,366
I need those at any cost

1587
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,949
Why he is coming this side ?

1588
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:38,490
Uncle, King Drutarashtra!
So much of insult for a lady in this assembly?

1589
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:40,616
Is this as per law or against law?

1590
01:42:40,657 --> 01:42:44,115
Hey, nothing you said can be understood.
Whatever you say, cover like this and say

1591
01:42:44,365 --> 01:42:45,740
Hey Krishna...
Guruji

1592
01:42:45,907 --> 01:42:47,407
That is my dialogue right
You wait dude

1593
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:49,616
What is that fellow looking at me so angry?

1594
01:42:50,032 --> 01:42:51,615
Guruji, you missed a small logic
What is it?

1595
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:54,865
You cannot see public playing Drutarashtra,
but they can see you right?

1596
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:56,532
Please save me

1597
01:42:58,032 --> 01:42:59,115
Hey, what is happening?

1598
01:42:59,157 --> 01:43:01,825
What else, death is sitting in the chair before us

1599
01:43:03,615 --> 01:43:05,074
Sir, be careful.

1600
01:43:05,532 --> 01:43:08,615
Hey, why are you sitting like you came for eating?

1601
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:09,365
Get up

1602
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:11,449
Is there no end for challenges?

1603
01:43:11,782 --> 01:43:12,950
Still, I should scold myself

1604
01:43:13,365 --> 01:43:16,074
Without taking just photos, I messed up into all dirt.

1605
01:43:16,325 --> 01:43:18,491
Are you still not into sense even after half is over, idiot?

1606
01:43:19,157 --> 01:43:21,115
Still, how did you bet on with wife in the challenge?

1607
01:43:21,365 --> 01:43:22,865
Father...
What?

1608
01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:24,740
Scoundrel!

1609
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:26,615
Still, you are the reason for all this

1610
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:29,241
I said not to connect as you will be into troubles.

1611
01:43:29,657 --> 01:43:30,365
Did you listen?

1612
01:43:30,782 --> 01:43:33,240
That Krishna will not care,
she would not leave the sari caught

1613
01:43:33,532 --> 01:43:34,532
and she does not stop scratching.

1614
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:37,032
You will lose life if caught, idiot

1615
01:43:37,157 --> 01:43:38,865
Shakuni uncle!
Son in law

1616
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:40,866
What is he ruining everything?

1617
01:43:40,907 --> 01:43:44,907
If Company artiste is neglected,
it gets ruined Suyodhana

1618
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:45,991
It gets splashed!

1619
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:54,741
A guy making lady go frustrated, a guy like me asking
for lift without enquiring is never happy says the history

1620
01:43:54,865 --> 01:43:55,574
You said well Guruji

1621
01:43:55,615 --> 01:43:58,449
You said great, all is going well

1622
01:43:58,825 --> 01:44:00,200
Jai Mahishmati!

1623
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:05,200
Stop, I will talk. We need a song

1624
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:05,865
Krishna...

1625
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:24,491
Midnight Sun does not let us sleep

1626
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:30,782

He gets ferocious when shouted

1635
01:44:59,075 --> 01:45:01,491

He brings a country chicken and says it is like me

1640
01:45:47,657 --> 01:45:50,865

He dips completely into the ghee bowl

1643
01:45:58,825 --> 01:46:01,741
Remembering toddy, he looks into the eyes

1644
01:46:01,825 --> 01:46:04,866
He brings in a full swing like the salted fish

1645

Oh God, there is nobody. Come on, get down fast.

1666
01:48:05,575 --> 01:48:06,700
This is the right time to escape

1667
01:48:06,825 --> 01:48:08,782
Hey, what dude?

1668
01:48:08,825 --> 01:48:09,325
Why did this fellow come?

1669
01:48:09,365 --> 01:48:12,615
When all your guys sitting there in line,
where are you going?

1670
01:48:12,782 --> 01:48:15,282
You danced and sang.
Will you not take our feast?

1671
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:17,157
No feast or beast, leave us sir

1672
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,116
How can that be?

1673
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:20,991
We cut the goat right? You got to taste the Seema food.

1674
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,907
Guruji, he says to respect even
if murdered, what to do?

1675
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:24,991
What will he lose, he says a hundred

1676
01:48:25,075 --> 01:48:27,866
Hey, how long shall I request?
Listen, I will say one thing

1677
01:48:28,157 --> 01:48:31,575
It is up to you only till you enter
into this Seema and to let you go is our wish

1678
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,740
Uncle, if you eat our food for once
you will not forget until you die

1679
01:48:36,782 --> 01:48:38,157
We will anyways die right?

1680
01:48:38,407 --> 01:48:39,657
Let us taste that and die, come

1681
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:42,450
Hey, what is that murmuring
Our body languages will be so

1682
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:43,615
Ok, come on
Ok, move on

01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,657

What is that?

1689
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,157
Photos, take them

1690
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:12,240
She does not know when to speak what?

1691
01:49:12,407 --> 01:49:13,365
I should urgently change place

1692
01:49:13,407 --> 01:49:15,450
Come on, stay put.
Sit down Guruji, enjoy happily

1693
01:49:16,032 --> 01:49:17,032
Look, he is coming there

1694
01:49:17,282 --> 01:49:18,907
What is that mess bro, what is the matter?

1695
01:49:19,407 --> 01:49:20,032
That is...

1696
01:49:25,365 --> 01:49:26,157
That has happened bro

1697
01:49:26,575 --> 01:49:28,407
Oh, story is good bro

1698
01:49:28,907 --> 01:49:30,740
It is been very long since we watched
a good faction movie.

1699
01:49:31,325 --> 01:49:32,075
What did you say?

1700
01:49:32,657 --> 01:49:35,240
He came from the jail and you sold him

1701
01:49:35,865 --> 01:49:38,365
He caught you and you got into our tempo.

1702
01:49:38,532 --> 01:49:42,032
We came to his area, we in enjoyment
and joking danced for sang an item song.

1703
01:49:42,532 --> 01:49:45,282
Brother, do not joke. The food is good

1704
01:49:45,907 --> 01:49:48,490
Not that bro
Hey bro, he is into his own mess

1705
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,366
Why are you trying to convince him again?

1706
01:49:50,907 --> 01:49:52,907
I am taking my way, you die your death

1707
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:54,450
Guruji, listen to me.
Uncle, come on stay back

1708
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:57,199
I should reach Hyderabad before the hand dries

1709
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,240
Where are you going?

1710
01:49:59,075 --> 01:50:02,116
Our Keshava Reddy is a good beauty lover.

1711
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:05,032
Come , I will get you gifts
Will they not give us gifts?

1712
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:08,657
Brother, whatever I am given should be the same he gets

1713
01:50:08,782 --> 01:50:11,490
Ok, I will
Come on, come

1714
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:16,241
You all be here, I will go to brother

1715
01:50:16,325 --> 01:50:17,491
Say that I am the boss sir

1716
01:50:17,532 --> 01:50:19,740
Shall we go and change the dress
Ok, come I will give you my dress

1717
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:21,449
Father in law called.

1718
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:23,907
They were not seen in the ten check posts around

1719
01:50:24,657 --> 01:50:26,157
They have not been even to toll gates.

1720
01:50:27,282 --> 01:50:29,200
That means they are somewhere around here

1721
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:32,074
You should search and bring them before me

1722
01:50:32,532 --> 01:50:36,032
Brother, all kids did a great dance.

1723
01:50:36,157 --> 01:50:37,325
Why not give them gifts?

1724
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:39,450
What is happening here and what are you speaking?

1725
01:50:39,782 --> 01:50:40,990
Go
Ok, going

1726
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:42,741
Stop
Yes brother

1727
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:45,532
Take these and stick in the neighboring villages

1728
01:50:45,615 --> 01:50:46,199
Ok Bro.

1729
01:50:46,282 --> 01:50:49,532
If you ask for share...
Here, our sir is not in mood.

1730
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,741
You take the gifts tomorrow in the morning

1731
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:52,449
Hey drunkard Ramesh
Yes

1732
01:50:52,532 --> 01:50:54,615
Take these and stick in the village

1733
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:57,491
Look, cots are laid in the backyard. You sleep happily

1734
01:51:00,282 --> 01:51:02,157
These are those, yes they are found

1735
01:51:02,825 --> 01:51:05,907
Are we any Naxals or Terrorists?
Why does he say to stick our posters?

1736
01:51:06,157 --> 01:51:07,075
They are better,

1737
01:51:07,282 --> 01:51:09,200
they come in the nights and go doing what they have to

1738
01:51:09,365 --> 01:51:13,407
What did you do? You sold that
Pratap Reddy in the day and mid noon on the road

1739
01:51:14,115 --> 01:51:15,282
For travelling in your car...

1740
01:51:15,325 --> 01:51:17,450
Brother, I saw.

1741
01:51:17,575 --> 01:51:18,950
You are in this photo right?

1742
01:51:19,325 --> 01:51:20,450
Do not tell this to anyone

1743
01:51:21,157 --> 01:51:22,490
What are you thinking to do with these photos?

1744
01:51:22,532 --> 01:51:26,032
You do not take tension bro.
Photos will be to the wall and white outside

1745
01:51:26,157 --> 01:51:29,200
We are all reverse right? Yes, ok!

1746
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:32,991
Guruji, I feel very frustrated.
I will go change my dress and come

1747
01:51:33,325 --> 01:51:35,825
You change the dress and come?
What are you talking?

1748
01:51:36,075 --> 01:51:36,700
Boss!

1749
01:51:38,032 --> 01:51:39,282
Is what all you said a truth?

1750
01:51:39,657 --> 01:51:42,740
Hey Chitti fellow, I have been saying from
when I got into the boss and you did not listen

1751
01:51:43,032 --> 01:51:44,325
but went on doing your own mess

1752
01:51:44,825 --> 01:51:46,407
How are you bearing these two sir?

1753
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:48,324
Not just mine is the story

1754
01:51:48,575 --> 01:51:52,616
That niece of you who left, her story is a blockbuster

1755
01:51:52,657 --> 01:51:54,907
Oh no, how are you so peaceful listening
to so many stories sir?

1756
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,532
This is called subtleness

1757
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:57,491
What is that sir

1758
01:51:57,657 --> 01:51:59,782
It is to be at peace even after knowing that you will die

1759
01:52:00,157 --> 01:52:01,615
I understood one thing
What?

1760
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,616
I will not die alone, I will take you too as company

1761
01:52:04,657 --> 01:52:06,407
Oh no, how am I related and why will you take me?

1762
01:52:06,615 --> 01:52:09,907
Crazy fellow, mine is a character
in this story of just taking a lift

1763
01:52:10,032 --> 01:52:11,490
Mine is just the character giving the lift

1764
01:52:11,532 --> 01:52:12,782
You think so dear

1765
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,032
Look at her going that way.

1766
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:16,907
You acted great in the role of her father in law

1767
01:52:17,825 --> 01:52:19,950
Hello, first sacrifice is yours

1768
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,782
What to do now sir?

1769
01:52:20,825 --> 01:52:21,782
We will sleep
After sleeping?

1770
01:52:21,865 --> 01:52:24,407
If possible we shall sleep or die in sleep

1771
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:29,200
He will not get sleep now. Have a sleepless night

1772
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:31,574
I do not know anything, I do not know anything

1773
01:52:32,282 --> 01:52:34,032
What Guruji, why did he still not sleep?

1774
01:52:34,157 --> 01:52:36,575
He just came to know the story
and where would he get a sleep now?

1775
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:40,200
I am going for a night walk.
Those guarding can do their duty

1776
01:52:42,407 --> 01:52:45,575
Baby, is romance required in such violent situation?

1777
01:52:46,075 --> 01:52:48,241
Hello, we are paying two lakhs a day uncle.

1778
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:49,824
Why not we make him do that much of work?

1779
01:52:49,865 --> 01:52:50,949
I do not know anything, I do not know anything

1780
01:52:51,907 --> 01:52:53,825
Balu
I will go

1781
01:52:54,907 --> 01:52:57,282
What more?
I do not know anything, I do not know anything

1782
01:52:57,365 --> 01:52:59,782
I have been waiting from so long to chat

1783
01:52:59,907 --> 01:53:02,032
Right here
Damn it, sleep

1784
01:53:02,657 --> 01:53:05,325
Maddy
All chances do come late, bad luck

1785
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:10,907
Look at those lilies, so bright like me

1786
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:13,657
Look at those Sun flowers, down like me

1787
01:53:19,407 --> 01:53:23,075
If that moon is me, the sky is my world,

1788
01:53:23,615 --> 01:53:25,865
all stars around me are my relatives,

1789
01:53:26,532 --> 01:53:29,115
the clouds coming and going are my friends....

1790
01:53:29,575 --> 01:53:34,200
The glow around the moon is... You

1791
01:53:36,075 --> 01:53:38,825
Moon looks beautiful only when that shining is there

1792
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:44,950
I keep very happy when you are by my side

1793
01:53:48,075 --> 01:53:49,200
Will there be no moment in you idiot?

1794
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:52,240
I spoke so much and o you not know
what to say in reply?

1795
01:53:56,115 --> 01:53:56,657
I will say.

1796
01:53:58,825 --> 01:53:59,407
What?

1797
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:03,949
The same you wanted to listen

1798
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,699
Say fast

1799
01:54:08,157 --> 01:54:08,865
Happy birthday

1800
01:54:12,282 --> 01:54:12,990
Thank you

1801
01:54:13,615 --> 01:54:14,740
Those wishing first will be remembered,

1802
01:54:16,325 --> 01:54:18,616
but can never forget those wishing last

1803
01:54:20,907 --> 01:54:22,032
Why will I forget you?

1804
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,575
I feel to sing a nice song now

1805
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:30,741
Sing, that Keshava Reddy will come
and even Guruji will come to sing chorus

1806
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,199
We all together will have a group song

1807
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:33,782
Huh! Move

1808
01:54:38,115 --> 01:54:39,365
Do not cry, manage

1809
01:54:39,490 --> 01:54:40,782
Brother, urgent

1810
01:54:40,825 --> 01:54:41,575
What Urgent?

1811
01:54:41,615 --> 01:54:42,907
we are dying here.
Come on

1812
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:43,741
come on..give it sir.

1813
01:54:43,907 --> 01:54:46,325
Call those three
Troup is ours and what to call those three?

1814
01:54:46,365 --> 01:54:49,490
Come on, they sang and they danced.
What have you done?

1815
01:54:49,657 --> 01:54:50,575
You just joined in the group

1816
01:54:50,615 --> 01:54:52,115
We shall filter all villages

1817
01:54:52,282 --> 01:54:55,115
Look, you should pay our money
No money nothing, say to whomever

1818
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:55,949
Not that sir

1819
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,490
Why is he getting so much emotional?

1820
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:59,200
We would have given that money, right?

1821
01:54:59,407 --> 01:55:00,782
Hey Chitti Babu
Guruji

1822
01:55:01,407 --> 01:55:02,700
What sir, what are you shouting?

1823
01:55:02,865 --> 01:55:04,407
All this mess has come because of you three

1824
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:06,490
We should anyhow catch those three

1825
01:55:06,575 --> 01:55:09,366
You will have it bad
if you say anything about those three

1826
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:12,741
Hey, what is this three and all
Nothing brother....

1827
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:15,282
Three came extra in their troupe yesterday night.

1828
01:55:15,407 --> 01:55:20,325
Actually they danced and sang
and this idiot is trying to take their payment

1829
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:22,407
Bring down those three..
Come on get down.

1830
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,366
Guruji, get down

1831
01:55:33,407 --> 01:55:34,700
Come on down...

1832
01:55:35,115 --> 01:55:36,615
Brother, vehicle is right here

1833
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,824
Be there, I am coming.
Sankar, start the vehicle

1834
01:55:41,075 --> 01:55:43,450
Where are you going again? Get down

1835
01:55:45,282 --> 01:55:47,950
Oh no... Hey stop... Stop

1836
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:48,699
Stop

1837
01:55:48,907 --> 01:55:49,450
Stop

1838
01:55:49,615 --> 01:55:52,699
You get down, you go back

1839
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:58,325
What bro, where are you going leaving me?

1840
01:55:58,825 --> 01:56:03,282
I tried hard and set a great figure for you

1841
01:56:04,075 --> 01:56:05,200
You think who is she?

1842
01:56:05,657 --> 01:56:09,240
The three who came yesterday
and the girl who was with them...

1843
01:56:09,325 --> 01:56:10,575
Here, have a look

1844
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:14,990
Is she good? I said you are a great beauty lover

1845
01:56:15,075 --> 01:56:17,782
Hey! These are the three we want...

1846
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:20,157
They would not have gone anywhere,

1847
01:56:20,282 --> 01:56:21,950
not even out of the border and we will catch them

1848
01:56:22,032 --> 01:56:24,700
Good long drive right?
They are coming, you cover

1849
01:56:24,782 --> 01:56:26,325
Send them
You go

1850
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:31,574
Go to the side there, not to the back

1851
01:56:32,282 --> 01:56:33,240
Hey
Hello sir

1852
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:34,574
Where are those?

1853
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,699
No idea, it got punctured and they went to have a tea

1854
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:39,199
Sir, it seems this guy is the father in law of that girl

1855
01:56:40,657 --> 01:56:42,407
I promise on brother, I am not her father in law sir

1856
01:56:45,657 --> 01:56:46,865
Guruji, run fast

1857
01:56:51,907 --> 01:56:54,450
Oh no, we are gone if caught.

1858
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,075
These dirty clothes in between

1859
01:56:57,032 --> 01:56:58,575
Run, run fast

1860
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:04,782
If I had run the same in Olympics,
I would have got a gold medal

1861
01:57:05,075 --> 01:57:06,241
Guruji, left...
Come on

1862
01:57:10,365 --> 01:57:10,990
Balu

1863
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:12,325
What?

1864
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:14,740
I cannot run anymore

1865
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,907
Guruji, careful about this bag

1866
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,657
Have you ever said careful to me?

1867
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:21,532
Careful

1868
01:57:21,657 --> 01:57:24,575
Come on run, they are coming Balu

1869
01:57:27,657 --> 01:57:28,407
Thank God...

1870
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:41,866
Give it here

1871
01:57:44,575 --> 01:57:45,200
What is that?

1872
01:57:46,407 --> 01:57:51,032
Guruji, I am tired a lot. I will rest for some time,
take care if they come

1873
01:57:51,075 --> 01:57:54,700
You want to rest?
How are you getting sleep in this situation?

1874
01:57:55,032 --> 01:57:57,325
Guruji, it would take two minutes for them to come

1875
01:57:57,907 --> 01:57:58,865
They scream after coming.

1876
01:57:59,157 --> 01:58:01,950
Then it takes five minutes
to get a thought to break the doors.

1877
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,907
We need someone by that time

1878
01:58:07,075 --> 01:58:09,366
Oh no, they have not given so much time for us.
Look, they have come

1879
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:13,407
Hey, I will kill rascal. Open the door

1880
01:58:13,825 --> 01:58:15,241
What, will you kill just for selling?

1881
01:58:15,865 --> 01:58:18,449
We are humans bro, how can a human kill another?

1882
01:58:18,825 --> 01:58:19,450
What Guruji?

1883
01:58:20,282 --> 01:58:22,282
Huh, you both talk about humans.

1884
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,075
Send the girl with you, outside.

1885
01:58:26,575 --> 01:58:29,116
What has she done in between bro?
Are you any mad or what?

1886
01:58:29,282 --> 01:58:31,490
To take revenge on Bhanumati Devi

1887
01:58:31,865 --> 01:58:36,740
Placing a knife on her neck,
Pratap bro wanted to step in Kurnool

1888
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:41,490
For the mess you did in between, it all has come till here

1889
01:58:43,575 --> 01:58:44,366
Oh no,

1890
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:49,782
just for selling I was thinking
why are all these chases and fights.

1891
01:58:50,825 --> 01:58:51,825
It is all because of her.

1892
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:56,991
Because of their revenge, we innocent are affected Guruji

1893
01:58:58,075 --> 01:59:00,991
We became the pawns in their game.
Correct

1894
01:59:01,032 --> 01:59:03,782
Open the door
Hey, we are talking here right?

1895
01:59:04,657 --> 01:59:06,825
Bro, will you leave us if we give her?
Yes, leave her

1896
01:59:07,825 --> 01:59:09,782
Yes, leave her

1897
01:59:10,615 --> 01:59:12,949
That is the matter Guruji.
We should leave her for us to live

1898
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,990
Poor girl? Do one thing, you be with her

1899
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,700
They would finish even you and the problem is solved

1900
01:59:19,325 --> 01:59:22,825
It is not like to be solved right now...
Balu listen to me

1901
01:59:22,907 --> 01:59:24,782
Kesava Reddy bro...
You come in and take her

1902
01:59:25,115 --> 01:59:26,907
Hey, ask her to come

1903
01:59:27,325 --> 01:59:30,241
You are crazy, why will she come to die? You come in

1904
01:59:39,325 --> 01:59:41,782
I had been thinking who, when you said
a guy has to come from so long

1905
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:45,365
You come in dancing even after knowing
the capacity and caliber of our guy?

1906
01:59:45,575 --> 01:59:47,282
You and your dirty face

1907
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:49,282
Say now rascal, how to go out?

1908
01:59:49,657 --> 01:59:52,450
You will not go out but die

1909
01:59:53,325 --> 01:59:54,200
Oh no, you will say now

1910
01:59:55,532 --> 01:59:56,700
Guruji, take that knife

1911
01:59:58,115 --> 01:59:58,949
For what?

1912
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:00,240
To manage the guys outside

1913
02:00:00,657 --> 02:00:03,200
Managing guys with a knife used to cut fruits?

1914
02:00:03,907 --> 02:00:06,575
Each guy outside is like so strong and I cannot

1915
02:00:06,825 --> 02:00:07,700
Ok, handle this guy then

1916
02:00:07,950 --> 02:00:10,616
Oh no, why is that fellow looking so violent? I cannot

1917
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,032
What to do then?

1918
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,574
Kill him and a problem will be solved

1919
02:00:15,657 --> 02:00:19,407
Why are you seeing bro, chop him
Do not leave bro

1920
02:00:19,532 --> 02:00:20,950
Hey, stop

1921
02:00:21,365 --> 02:00:24,824
I will take them to brother and chop these into pieces

1922
02:00:28,115 --> 02:00:32,449
You eat at our house, sleep at our house
and try to make us fools, rascal?

1923
02:00:32,782 --> 02:00:35,532
Even your death is here.
Why do you not speak up brother?

1924
02:00:37,075 --> 02:00:37,700
Brother...

1925
02:00:39,325 --> 02:00:39,991
Brother...

1926
02:00:41,075 --> 02:00:43,157
Oh no, what is this brother?

1927
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,866
You know what these fellows did?
What have they done brother?

1928
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:47,199
Keshava Reddy, drink

1929
02:00:51,825 --> 02:00:55,116
What have they done bro? How did you do so?

1930
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:59,282
Oh no... You rascal... hey!

1931
02:00:59,865 --> 02:01:03,573
Balu, he is a crazy guy...
Why not finish right there with the knife on the neck?

1932
02:01:04,032 --> 02:01:07,657
If he had so much brain, he would be with us in Hyderabad
and why would he stay back here?

1933
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:08,365
Correct!

1934
02:01:08,949 --> 02:01:10,449
But still I am hurt
Why?

1935
02:01:10,657 --> 02:01:12,907
Story is of here and even you have not said me

1936
02:01:13,532 --> 02:01:17,074
Either I say or not, she in a strong feel that you would come
and save taken a promise on Padmasri.

1937
02:01:17,365 --> 02:01:20,448
I have thus got convinced Balu. Have you got convinced?

1938
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:30,490
Where are we going?
Hyderabad via Kurnool

1939
02:01:31,157 --> 02:01:33,115
No, my village

1940
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:39,740
Balu, is it required for us in this tension?

1941
02:01:40,115 --> 02:01:41,657
He would now say where shall we go

1942
02:01:41,782 --> 02:01:42,865
When have you heard me?

1943
02:01:42,907 --> 02:01:43,740
Say Pratap darling

1944
02:01:43,907 --> 02:01:46,032
Hey, stop making fun

1945
02:01:46,615 --> 02:01:51,657
The people you want are with us. Speak with some brains

1946
02:01:53,324 --> 02:01:56,532
Hey, take this phone and give it there. Go

1947
02:01:57,282 --> 02:01:58,657
Hey, remove the ropes

1948
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:04,407
Hello son, are you fine?

1949
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,615
Bapu, I am fine

1950
02:02:06,865 --> 02:02:11,698
Son, you should safely drop that girl
at her mother in law in Kurnool

1951
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:15,365
Ok Bapu, what about you then?

1952
02:02:15,657 --> 02:02:20,574
You be without any fear son,
is there a man here to touch your Bapu?

1953
02:02:22,199 --> 02:02:24,282
You complete the work given to you and come

1954
02:02:24,699 --> 02:02:26,366
We will have a good party

1955
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:27,574
Will I stop when you say a party?

1956
02:02:28,032 --> 02:02:30,824
We shall make a celebration
in our area tomorrow evening. See you Bapu

1957
02:02:32,865 --> 02:02:34,240
Call your mother in law

1958
02:02:34,615 --> 02:02:36,157
How if you anger so much brother?

1959
02:02:36,824 --> 02:02:38,199
You should have said a word to me, right?

1960
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:40,866
What if something unexpected happens?

1961
02:02:49,615 --> 02:02:50,448
Hello mother in law

1962
02:02:50,615 --> 02:02:52,115
Hey, remove the ropes

1963
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:53,615
I will send our men

1964
02:02:54,074 --> 02:02:56,699
Sorry mother in law, not that I should not say you.

1965
02:02:57,282 --> 02:02:59,115
I thought to say clearly after I meet.

1966
02:02:59,365 --> 02:03:01,948
Not a game of kids, say where you are?

1967
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,198
Why do you shout like that mother in law?

1968
02:03:08,074 --> 02:03:15,657
The dare I had being with you and dad,
I am with the same dare being with Balu too.

1969
02:03:16,157 --> 02:03:17,699
He will bring me

1970
02:03:18,199 --> 02:03:21,032
I should speak once to him, give the phone

1971
02:03:21,949 --> 02:03:23,116
Balu - Yes

1972
02:03:23,157 --> 02:03:24,740
It seems mother in law will speak to you

1973
02:03:26,782 --> 02:03:27,282
Hello

1974
02:03:27,699 --> 02:03:32,616
Thanks a lot, bring our girl carefully to our house

1975
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:36,573
I will pay you as much money you need

1976
02:03:38,949 --> 02:03:45,032
You are not bringing just our girl, but our life

1977
02:03:45,615 --> 02:03:46,407
Ok madam

1978
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:51,782
Guruji
Yes

1979
02:03:52,032 --> 02:03:53,407
Still, what are these Seema people?

1980
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:57,782
Money to kill, money not to be killed
and when would they live?

1981
02:03:58,949 --> 02:04:03,699
When they have so much fear of life,
why not silently fall on the feet and compromise?

1982
02:04:05,782 --> 02:04:07,949
What do you know about my mother in law?

1983
02:04:08,865 --> 02:04:10,823
For the word given to her brother,

1984
02:04:11,407 --> 02:04:16,449
she stood as a support to 40 villages
and 4 Lakhs of public.

1985
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:19,865
What did you say just now? Fear...

1986
02:04:22,324 --> 02:04:27,991
That is not the fear rascal,
it is a war she is doing alone with a demon

1987
02:04:30,157 --> 02:04:34,324
What about you, idiot?
You think to be a hero for just saving me alone?

1988
02:04:39,865 --> 02:04:49,782
But still, liking a guy like you living
only for money is my mistake

1989
02:04:53,115 --> 02:04:56,573
Are you happy now?
Is everything happening as you wished?

1990
02:04:58,615 --> 02:05:02,073
She is a mad girl. She just reacted listening to your words.

1991
02:05:02,532 --> 02:05:05,532
I understood the meaning
and purpose behind those words

1992
02:05:06,782 --> 02:05:10,240
How greatly have you
diverted the love on you with just one word?

1993
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:13,698
I cannot say whether what you are doing is right or wrong,

1994
02:05:14,449 --> 02:05:16,407
but I can say that you are correct for that girl.

1995
02:05:17,865 --> 02:05:23,448
Come on Guruji, a post man cannot
put a letter in the pocket as it is good right?

1996
02:05:24,907 --> 02:05:27,949
We have to make it reach where it belongs to.

1997
02:05:31,449 --> 02:05:32,824
That is what I have to do now.

1998
02:05:38,282 --> 02:05:40,324
You leave sir
I will not go Balu

1999
02:05:41,407 --> 02:05:43,407
You took great care of me from yesterday

2000
02:05:43,824 --> 02:05:46,032
and do I not know how carefully would
you take care of that girl?

2001
02:05:47,032 --> 02:05:49,032
It is wrong to make the girl you loved suffer

2002
02:05:50,282 --> 02:05:53,074
You leave
I will not go, I will go nowhere

2003
02:05:53,824 --> 02:05:55,491
I too want to see where this story ends

2004
02:06:19,782 --> 02:06:24,157
Balu I did not just like this one hour in these 24 hours.

2005
02:06:30,782 --> 02:06:41,532
Two eyes are not enough, my heart is like sea of tears

2006
02:06:42,199 --> 02:06:52,949
Two eyes will not stop the hiccups
hanging the breathe to death

2007
02:06:53,324 --> 02:06:59,116
What shall I ask this minute?

2008
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:04,407
What shall I think of the vacuum without you?

2009
02:07:04,657 --> 02:07:10,324
Heart was very well till now

2010
02:07:10,365 --> 02:07:15,532
Do not wish for, it is slipped from the hands

2011
02:07:15,574 --> 02:07:21,199
Giving your wings and moving my dream

2012
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:26,573
Can you leave after knowing the happiness?

2013
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:32,532
Ask your thoughts about the weight of my eye lids

2014
02:07:32,574 --> 02:07:38,657
Which question knows the answer for my love?

2015
02:07:52,615 --> 02:07:54,198
DGP will arrive in 10 minutes

2016
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:56,157
Ok, take good care of all arrangements

2017
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:21,073
Not 100, 200 or 300 crores,

2018
02:08:21,407 --> 02:08:25,365
he said to pay so huge which would
not vanish for generations and I had to.

2019
02:08:27,657 --> 02:08:28,282
Hey...

2020
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,865
Your village gets burnt as you go on shouting, Bhanumati

2021
02:08:57,949 --> 02:08:59,824
Your school, factories and your public...

2022
02:09:00,324 --> 02:09:02,324
On the whole your total village will become a graveyard

2023
02:09:03,282 --> 02:09:03,865
Will you shout?

2024
02:09:04,449 --> 02:09:05,407
Come on shout..

2025
02:09:07,615 --> 02:09:10,698
You employed a hunting dog to safeguard the deer

2026
02:09:11,657 --> 02:09:15,324
Do you know how it is when that dog is hunted by a lion?

2027
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:16,699
You want to see?

2028
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:21,157
Leave my niece and my people Pratap.

2029
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:24,282
Kill me if you want to

2030
02:09:26,407 --> 02:09:28,407
I will fulfill your wish Bhanumati,

2031
02:09:29,449 --> 02:09:32,532
But before that there is a guy by the side of your niece.

2032
02:09:33,115 --> 02:09:35,032
I need that fellow

2033
02:09:35,490 --> 02:09:39,282
I want to see the fear in your eyes to be seen in his eyes

2034
02:09:39,782 --> 02:09:45,240
He should know the value of fear and
above that should know the ego value of Pratap Reddy

2035
02:09:47,115 --> 02:09:49,990
I will then kill you both.

2036
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:54,116
Till then sit keeping your mouth shut

2037
02:10:21,199 --> 02:10:22,074
Are you giving away the money?

2038
02:10:25,032 --> 02:10:26,449
I found a more valuable thing Guruji

2039
02:10:27,615 --> 02:10:29,198
But you left even that love right?

2040
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:34,116
I left the girl, but not the love

2041
02:11:11,324 --> 02:11:12,907
Hey...

2042
02:11:28,949 --> 02:11:29,824
Mother in law...

2043
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:30,990
Mother in law...

2044
02:11:36,324 --> 02:11:37,157
Mother in law...

2045
02:11:38,074 --> 02:11:40,657
I thought you were a hero messing with Pratap Reddy.

2046
02:11:41,782 --> 02:11:45,282
What are you running away like a timid guy?

2047
02:11:45,615 --> 02:11:50,490
Hey, I was on the duty of saving her
and thus just sold you on the roads and left

2048
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:53,448
But if I had known that it is to save from you,

2049
02:11:54,574 --> 02:11:55,741
your story would have ended right that day

2050
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:16,448
I do not need what happened before
I entered into your story

2051
02:13:17,282 --> 02:13:19,865
You are no more needed after I entered into this story.

2052
02:13:20,324 --> 02:13:21,949
I am the hero for the story

2053
02:14:52,407 --> 02:14:56,615
Hail to Bhanumati Devi

2054
02:14:56,740 --> 02:15:00,948
Hail to Bhanumati Devi
