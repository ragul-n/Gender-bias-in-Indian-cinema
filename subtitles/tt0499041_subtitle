1
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:22,979
Pornography or the business of making.
In addition, selling blue films.

2
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,978
Is a $56 billion industry.

3
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:30,654
It thrives on the exploitation
of the innocent.

4
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:42,979
KALYUG Review and
Synchronization by Angel.

5
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,979
He is Ketan Shah. Your lawyer.

6
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,982
He said that he would release
You from the prison.

7
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,990
Bhashkar, I did not say this.

8
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,591
Till the time I am not convinced
of the convict's innocence..

9
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,597
I do not take up the case.

10
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,201
Everybody out, please.

11
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,010
Out, please.

12
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,407
Bhashkar, you too. Out.

13
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:13,300
- Tell me something about yourself.
- What?

14
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,438
Everything. Right
from the beginning.

15
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:29,715
Since the time I have become mature.
I have known only 2 things.

16
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,457
Fear and pain.

17
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,531
<i>19 January 1990. That black day.</i>

18
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,797
<i>When we Kashmiri Pundits had
to leave our home and city.</i>

19
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,066
<i>We became refugees in our own
country. We lost everything.</i>

20
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,536
Sir, give me the luggage.

21
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,070
<i>Father came to Mumbai because
He had wanted the world.</i>

22
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,083
<i>To know about the pain and
sorrow of Kashmiri Pundits.</i>

23
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,082
<i>His dream was that some day
We'll return to our Kashmir.</i>

24
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,085
<i>He was a social worker.</i>

25
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,089
Wait, wait, slowly.

26
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,291
<i>He used to believe that if you
want to alleviate your pain.</i>

27
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,098
<i>Then you should give solace
to others who are in pain.</i>

28
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,502
<i>For 16 years he worked. That
too without getting tired.</i>

29
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,167
<i>And without stopping.</i>

30
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,310
<i>He always fought for
his principles.</i>

31
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,582
<i>And then one clay suddenly.</i>

32
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,124
- Kunaldar.
- Yes.

33
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,129
Do you recognize this watch?

34
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,467
<i>It was my father's watch.</i>

35
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,466
<i>In the crowd of Mumbai's
local train.</i>

36
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,530
<i>His hands had slipped and
he fell off the train.</i>

37
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,539
<i>He died.</i>

38
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,307
<i>His dream of returning
to Kashmiri.</i>

39
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,180
<i>Flowed as ashes in the water.</i>

40
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,598
<i>I could not even mourn.</i>

41
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,199
<i>Because Mumbai is a machine
that works day and night.</i>

42
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,213
<i>It does not give you
time to shed tears.</i>

43
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,807
14. 15.

44
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,344
Rishi. Is he your instructor or
you are his instructor. Go home.

45
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,548
Kunal dear, come. It is already
10 o'clock. Come.

46
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,691
Come, dear. It is 10 o'clock. Do you
want to build muscles in one day.

47
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,231
Do you want to close my
gym? Let us go home.

48
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,238
Tell me, which song
do you want to hear?

49
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,705
What difference does it make?

50
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,765
When you do want to roar
then use any language.

51
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,836
- Do I sing so badly?
- You felt bad. Do sing. Sing.

52
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,245
- Shall I sing?
- Yes.

53
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,251
You made me a lover.
You made me a lover.

54
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,627
- You made me a lover.
- Shall I tell you something?

55
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:54,064
Nobody can sing so badly
with such confidence.

56
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,922
Let us go.

57
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,271
Hey! Hey! Come on, take
out your money!

58
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,397
Come on!

59
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,805
Hey, smarty! What are you
doing! Shall I hit you!

60
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,183
Do not hit. Come on, take it out.

61
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,779
Give me this watch!
Take out this watch!

62
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,746
Hey!

63
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,284
Do not hit!
Do not try to act smart!

64
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,751
Hang on. Hang on.
Come on. You too take it out.

65
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,288
Do not try to act smart!

66
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,355
- Give me the watch!
- Take this.

67
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,783
What do you say? Get lost!

68
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,294
Go away, otherwise
I will thrash you.

69
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,694
Let us go, Kunal. Let us go.

70
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,468
This was. What happened?

71
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,771
- It is wrong.
- What?

72
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,307
- Buddy, it was my father's watch.
- So?

73
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,305
- I cannot live without it.
- So what will you do?

74
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,904
Kunal! Where are you going! Kunal!

75
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,577
Smarty, share it equally.
Leave it. Here comes that fellow.

76
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,847
What do you want?

77
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,914
- Get lost!
- Keep everything else. Just give me the watch.

78
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,653
Is the watch so expensive?

79
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,464
- It is the last memento of my father.
- Really?

80
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,533
- Yes.
- Shall I send you to your father?

81
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,663
- Kunal. Look.
- Don't talk about my father.

82
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,732
Kunal!

83
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,345
- Kunal!
- Fatso, takes him away from here!

84
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,347
Let's go. Kunal!

85
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,680
<i>Kunal, listen to me! Kunal!</i>

86
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,467
Kunal, enough. Now stop.

87
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,552
Take the watch. Leave me.

88
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,421
Kunal, stop.

89
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,835
Kunal <i>- I was able to
take back father's watch.</i>

90
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,630
<i>But I understood one
thing that day.</i>

91
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:03,038
<i>To eliminate darkness. We have
to light the lamp ourselves.</i>

92
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,780
<I>We have to wage our own battle.</I>

93
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,446
<I>We only have to burn in it.</I>

94
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,458
- Hello.
- 26297661.

95
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,123
There is a trunk call for you from
Jammu. Please stay on the line.

96
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,668
- Hello, Mr. Pushkarnath.
- Hello.

97
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,470
Sir, this is Siddhartha.
From St. Joseph hospital.

98
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,473
Since many days I have been
trying to contact you.

99
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,880
Hello. Look Pushkarnath
is not there. I am his.

100
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,476
- I cannot hear you. Hello.
- Hello.

101
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,489
Hello. I have called to inform you
that Anaz Renuka is now an adult.

102
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,081
You supposed to
come to take her.

103
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,492
Since you didn't come, the court
has decided to send Renuka to you.

104
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,157
Hello. Look, I am Pushkarnath's son.
And I don't know about any Renuka.

105
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,962
- Hello.
- I cannot hear you. Sorry.

106
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,094
Sorry, sir. We have no
other option.

107
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,502
Renuka will come tomorrow
by Jammutavi super fast.

108
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,506
- What?
- She will reach CST.

109
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:08,568
Look. I. hello? Hello? Hello?

110
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,198
Hey! Listen. How long
is Jammutavi late?

111
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,863
You are who are late. The
train arrived 2 hours back.

112
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,064
- What?
- Yes.

113
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,689
Renuka?

114
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:20,578
I am Kunal. Pushkarnath's
son. Sorry, I am late.

115
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,177
No problem. I thought
nobody will come.

116
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,657
Pushkar uncle has not come.

117
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:36,594
Maybe you do not know.
However, he expired 6 months back.

118
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,938
However, I came here because of
him. No problem. I will go back.

119
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:52,273
However... I do not have money
for returning.

120
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,014
You do not worry about money. But
do you want to return right now?

121
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,749
I do not have any other choice. I do
not know anybody else in this city.

122
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,958
I will return to Jammu.

123
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:12,893
Fine. Come, I'll buy a
ticket for you. Come.

124
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,900
- Take this.
- Thanks.

125
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,633
Come on, hurry up.

126
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,769
I have the ticket. But
there is a problem.

127
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,305
Reservation is after a week.

128
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,846
No problem. I will return
after a week.

129
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,121
I will return your money
as soon, I reach there.

130
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,124
However,.. where will you
live for a week.

131
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,185
Here, at the station only. I am
used to living alone. Thank you.

132
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,766
Renuka.

133
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,715
Look, I can't let you live here
for a week. You come with me.

134
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,181
No, I will manage to live here.

135
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,848
No. You come with me. I will
arrange for some place.

136
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:52,131
- I hope you will not have any problem.
- Problem? No problem.

137
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,795
- Big problem. Big problem.
- Okay, okay.

138
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,741
Look, I am telling you. No,
we will not allow it.

139
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,011
- Aunty, but..
- Shut up!

140
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,741
- Girls not allowed here!
- Understood! No problem.

141
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,808
If not girls, then you get people.
If not person, then you bring girls.

142
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,480
- What do you think! What do you think!
- Aunty.. enough.

143
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,486
How much will you scold!
She is a decent girl.

144
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,353
She is my guest. She has
come from Kashmir, aunty.

145
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,022
Only for 7 days.
After that she will go.

146
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,965
Come on, Delnaz. Let her stay
here. She is such a sweet girl.

147
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,767
Shut up! Such a sweet girl!
Shut up! And you get out!

148
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,364
And tell her to get out from here!

149
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,776
Aunty, please. Where will she go?
She has no other place to go.

150
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,905
Do you think I am an idiot!

151
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,731
You pay rent for a single person in
addition, 2 people will live here.

152
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:44,979
Is there an offer of one free with
one? You are trying to act smart.

153
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,781
Fine. I pay only a single
person is rent. I do not.

154
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,258
Only one person will stay.
She will stay here.

155
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,459
- Then where will you go?
- I will go to hell! Any problem!

156
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,806
No problem. No problem
at all. Any problem?

157
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,203
Come.

158
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:21,815
Actually.. nobody.. nobody visits
this place. Therefore, that is why.

159
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,019
And there is not much cleanliness.

160
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,956
Just give me 5 minutes.
I will clean up this place.

161
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,295
- Will you bury me in the ground?
- What?

162
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,031
How much more will you
make me feel ashamed.

163
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,107
As it is, you are doing
so much for me.

164
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,439
And I'm banishing you
from your own house.

165
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,911
This is not so. I'm doing all
this for my father's sake.

166
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,981
He used to like it.. whenever
I used to help others.

167
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,848
However, where will you sleep?

168
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,913
I? There only.. where
half the Indians sleep.

169
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,001
Come on, Delnaz. It's
so late. Go to sleep.

170
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,012
Come on. Come inside.

171
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,220
Seeing you, do I have to sleep?

172
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,557
Seeing you, do I have to sleep?

173
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,168
Seeing you, do I have to wake up?

174
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,175
I have to spend my life with you.

175
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,235
You are my life.

176
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:57,186
My heart beats for you.

177
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:05,184
My heart beats for you.

178
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:09,522
Seeing you, do I have to sleep?

179
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,003
Seeing you, do I have to wake up?

180
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,201
I have to spend my life with you.

181
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,540
You are my life.

182
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,600
My heart beats for you.

183
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:48,018
Since a long time there have been
many unsaid wishes in my heart.

184
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:59,972
Since a long time there have been
many unsaid wishes in my heart.

185
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,248
Come and hear them. Cast
the spell of love.

186
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:08,188
Come and hear them. Cast
the spell of love.

187
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,989
Do listen to me sometimes.

188
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:19,049
My heart beats for you.

189
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:27,205
My heart beats for you.

190
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,022
Forget it.

191
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,636
Hey fellow, come inside. Hurry up.

192
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:06,096
Why do I feel like I have loved
you since centuries?

193
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:18,108
Why do I feel like I have loved
you since centuries?

194
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,455
Come in my dreams
and make me yours.

195
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,401
Come in my dreams
and make me yours.

196
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,065
Do this favor on me.

197
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:37,546
My heart beats for you.

198
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:45,554
My heart beats for you.

199
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,090
Seeing you, do I have to sleep?

200
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:54,358
Seeing you, do I have to wake up?

201
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,367
I have to spend my life with you.

202
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,632
You are my life.

203
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:09,441
My heart beats for you.

204
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:17,635
My heart beats for you.

205
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:29,126
My heart beats for you.

206
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:37,187
My heart beats for you.

207
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:44,744
My heart beats for you.

208
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:50,414
My heart beats for you.

209
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,287
This is your ticket. And water.

210
00:21:55,147 --> 00:22:00,825
There is something to eat in
the bag. And keep 100 rupees.

211
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,422
For your expenses on the route.

212
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,365
500 and 300. And this 100 rupees.

213
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,171
The total is 900 rupees. I will
return it as soon as I reach there.

214
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,700
Do you want to bury
me in the ground?

215
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,176
I want to tell you something.

216
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,523
The happiness that you gave
me in those 7 days..

217
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,187
I would not have found
that even in 7 lifetimes.

218
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,656
I think life had some debts.

219
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,530
And it repaid it to me
through you. Thank you.

220
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,216
Fine. I will leave.

221
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,282
Bye.

222
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,454
Smile! Smile!

223
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,331
Delnaz darling, at least open
the lock of the camera.

224
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,509
If you don't open the camera,
then how will you click?

225
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:58,338
Shut up, old man. I do know.
Smile!

226
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,335
Now you click my snap. Come
on, hurry up. Come on.

227
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,472
Come on, hurry up. Come on.

228
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,544
Smile!

229
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,815
- Very good!
- Very good!

230
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,618
Thank you.

231
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,624
One minute. I will send him back.

232
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,956
- What is the matter, buddy?
- This is your wedding gift.

233
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,086
What is this?

234
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:23,364
Are you mad! Will you spend your
first wedding night here?

235
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,361
With uncle and aunty.

236
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,370
This is Hotel Ceaser Palace's
honeymoon room voucher.

237
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,372
You will spend your wedding
night there only.

238
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:35,377
- I cannot take this.
- Fool, this is my gift for you both.

239
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,846
Thanks, buddy.

240
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,984
Hurry up.

241
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,386
Yes, we will have
lunch there only.

242
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,603
Welcome sir. Good-bye.

243
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:05,933
- Hi.
- Hi, sir.

244
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,943
- We have reservation here.
- One second. Please.

245
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,677
- Mr. Bhashkar gave this.
- Okay.

246
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,081
- He said that you know about it.
- Yes.

247
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,420
So, see which room is available.

248
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,489
Hi.

249
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,511
<i>Hema.</i>

250
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,053
I'm sorry.

251
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,475
- Take this, sir. Keys.
- Thanks you.

252
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:25,146
- Hey! Give him honeymoon suite.
- Okay, sir.

253
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,817
Take this, sir.

254
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,761
Your room is there, a bit
upstairs. Thank you, sir.

255
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,691
Come.

256
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:43,213
Do choose from the lip, what
written on the lip.

257
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:55,225
Do choose from the lip, what
write on the lip.

258
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,581
Embrace me and immerse
me in my heart.

259
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,585
Embrace me and immerse
me in my heart.

260
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,053
Do recognize me.

261
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:14,111
My heart beats for you.

262
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:22,594
My heart beats for you.

263
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:30,612
My heart beats for you.

264
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:38,610
My heart beats for you.

265
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,757
Renuka.

266
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,166
What are you doing?

267
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,722
What are you chanting at
2 o'clock in the night?

268
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,089
Are you doing some
black magic on me?

269
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,794
Are you okay? I will have to take
you to the doctor tomorrow.

270
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,669
My wife has become mad.
At night, doctor..

271
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:33,800
Can't you keep quiet for 2
minutes? You talk so much.

272
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,678
How many times I have told you not
to interrupt me when I am praying.

273
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,411
God will become angry.
You never listen to me.

274
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,279
But why this prayer so late
at night? Am I going to die?

275
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,349
May your enemies die!

276
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,831
Then why all this? Just like that.
I felt like loving you.

277
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,893
I felt like looking at
you again and again.

278
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,229
If you see me again and again,
then you will get bored.

279
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,169
- I? Yes. I will get bored.
- Yes.

280
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,706
Before that I will die.

281
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,706
Now why are you staring at me?

282
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:21,117
Nothing. I was wondering what will
happen to this fool after me.

283
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,792
What will happen? Will I live
if something, happens to you.

284
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:31,060
- I have told God, if you are not there, then even I will not live.
- Really?

285
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,399
Yes. Nothing like
this will happen.

286
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,271
We have to live here only.
And we have to live a lot.

287
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,866
We have to laugh and cry.
And have loads of children.

288
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,137
- Lots?
- Yes.

289
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,747
Then we will grow old. You will
become old. I will become old.

290
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,217
- You know how you will look when you will become old.
- How?

291
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,751
And you'll scare me at night.

292
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,759
Then you will wake me
up at night and say.

293
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,762
"God, God, without your teeth."

294
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,766
Then you will blow. We will
have loads of fun.

295
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,180
Then?

296
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,319
Then, what happened?

297
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,121
For few moments, I do not
know why. However, I felt.

298
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:42,331
That the ocean of pain and fear
has gone far away from my life.

299
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,801
However, what did I know that it
will return as a storm.

300
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,011
And destroy everything.

301
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,086
- Wake him up.
- What happened?

302
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,822
- Come on. Get up.
- Leave me.

303
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,830
Take him along. Come on.

304
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,832
- Where are you taking us?
- Kunal.

305
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,095
Renuka! Renuka!

306
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,836
What have I done? Do tell me!

307
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,907
Leave me alone! Leave me!

308
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,042
Where are you taking us!

309
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,378
Where are you taking us! Leave me!

310
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,916
I told you. Go inside.

311
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,917
What have my children done!

312
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,386
My dear children. God!

313
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,393
- Smarty. Get in!
- Leave me.

314
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,327
Get in. Come on.

315
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,457
Sit here quietly. Sit.

316
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,203
Why have you brought me here?

317
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,878
Where is my wife?

318
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,218
Where is my wife? Where is Renuka?

319
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,622
I am asking you all! Renuka!

320
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,621
Do not shout! Keep your voice low!

321
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,890
This is a police station! Not your
father's house! Understand!

322
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,101
Who is she? Who is she?

323
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,438
- I do not know.
- Who is she?

324
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,377
- Tell me the name of your partner.
- What partner!

325
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,504
- Tell me.
- Don't touch me!

326
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,243
- What will you do?
- Don't touch me!

327
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,185
You will not give us the name!
What will you do!

328
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,119
I told you do not touch me!

329
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,920
Beat him! You thrashed a police
officer! Beat him up!

330
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,329
You thrashed a police officer!
Beat him up!

331
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,335
<i>Renuka!</i>

332
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,065
<i>Renuka!</i>

333
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,932
<i>Leave me! Leave me!</i>

334
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,138
- Is this Kunal's voice?
<i>- Renuka!</i>

335
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,339
Are you all beating him?

336
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,611
Why are you all beating him?

337
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,953
- Why are you beating Kunal?
- Sit here quietly.

338
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,360
- Tell us, what is your rate?
- What?

339
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,090

Renuka, the best moment

00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:47,168
The most precious
time for a woman.

371
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:51,400
Your husband has sold it and
made a blue film out of it.

372
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,177
<i>Your naked body is being
sold everywhere.</i>

373
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,180
<i>Children are seeing your blue film
on the internet and mobile too.</i>

Look Renuka, we will leave

Listen to sign and me
on the papers. Come on.

376
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,194
Whom do you want to save Renuka?

377
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,205
The one who says that you are.

378
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,434
The business of blue
films in partnership.

379
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:31,947
- No! He can never say like that.
- He has said it!

380
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,644
He has even signed on the papers.
Here have a look!

381
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,686
Look Renuka, he will
escape from all this.

382
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,617
However, you will
be stuck into it.

383
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,756
Listen to me, sign on it. Come on.

384

Do not get scared. Just sign.

386
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,258
You should do as told to you.

387
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:27,635
- Renuka! Renuka! Leave me!
- Catch him properly.

388
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,001
<i>Renuka, they are lying. Renuka,
do not listen to him.</i>

389
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,333
They want you to give
a testimony against me.

390
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,673
<i>Renuka, don't sign on any paper.</i>

391
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:40,273
<i>Renuka, they are trying
to implicate us.</i>

392
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,010
<i>Renuka, don't listen to them.</i>

393
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,382
Renuka, they are lying.

394
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,013
<i>Renuka, they want to give
false testimonies.</i>

395
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:53,723
<i>Renuka! Do not sign on any papers.</i>

396
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,425
<i>They want to implicate us! Renuka!</i>

397
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,526
Renuka, they are lying. Renuka!

398
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:06,507
<i>Renuka, I will not lie to you.</i>

399
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,801
<i>Do not listen to them.
They are lying.</i>

400
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:16,910
<i>Leave me! Leave me!
Renuka! Renuka!</i>

401
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:23,584
<i>Renuka, don't sign on any papers.</i>

402
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,422
<i>Renuka! Renuka!</i>

403
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,349
In this manner, my life
was taken away from me.

404
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,889
People really ruined it.

405
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,102
Mr. Shah.

406
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,377
18 years back terrorists had come.

407
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,937
Into our homes and thrown us out.

408
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,785
I was a kid at that time,
so I couldn't do anything.

409
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,622
But I can do something now.

410
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,853
Against those who have
made a blue film.

411
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,890
Please get me out from
here. That is it.

412
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,402
<i>We have just got the
news that the court.</i>

413
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,673
Has given bail to Kunaldar
in the blue film case.

414
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,011
So then let us talk
to Kunaldar. Come.

415
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,682
- Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Excuse me, sir!

416
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,422
Kunal, we want to know that the
acquisition that put on you.

417
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,998
Regarding the blue film. The
acquisition not proves yet.

418
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,723
My client is innocent.
Did you understand?

419
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,456
And as far the blue
film is concerned.

420
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,590
The people involved in all this can
ruin even your lives tomorrow.

421
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,965
- But who are these?
- Why are you asking the police?

422
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,833
However, who is this
porn star Annie?

423
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,429
We do not know anything.
We do not.

424
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,294
Know who they are and
from where they operate.

425
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:20,998
Sir, please just one question.
Please, sir!

426
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,520
Hello madam!

427
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,560
Hey, get your ass off that table!

428
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,657
Annie, where do you
think you are going.

429
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:45,860
I need to speak to her.

430
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,630
You cannot go in the boss is busy.

431
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,571
- You cannot go.
- I need to speak to her.

432
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:57,208
- That person is now out of prison.
- Which person?

433
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:05,153
The same guy from India whose
blue film is on our porn site.

434
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,619
You said nothing like
this will happen.

435
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,563
- I will take care of it. Do not worry.
- Oh ya!

436
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,574
Simi, we need to talk.
We have a big problem.

437
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,605
- Not now.
- Oh no! Simi, we need to talk.

438
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,276
It is urgent. Or else everyone
will be killing.

439
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:13,019
Later. In the evening.

440
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,214
Ma'am, please one question!
Please!

441
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:58,594
<i>Today we have Mrs. Simi Roy
who will talk about the.</i>

442
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,330
<i>Future plans of the FTC after
the sudden demise of her husband.</i>

443
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,236
<i>Good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.</i>

444
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,604
<i>I would like to thank all of you
especially my fellow Indians.</i>

445
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,079
<i>And all our supporters and all
those who have invested in FTC.</i>

446
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,982
What did I tell you? What
did I say to you?

447
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,786
I said.. look at me you fool!

448
00:46:56,847 --> 00:47:01,387
I had told you that for the next
seven days do not try to meet me.

449
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,190
It has not even been 24 hours
since my husband's death.

450
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,895
Tanya has her doubts now.
You idiot!

451
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,130
Therefore, what should I do!

452
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,668
Annie had come. She
was saying that.

453
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,208
The Indian government
has started an enquiry.

454
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,268
In addition, your
master plan has failed!

455
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,214
A huge havoc has been
created in India.

456
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,679
And our contact in the
police department.

457
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,777
Jadhav, there is an
enquiry made on him too.

458
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,188
So? What happened?

459
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,684
You know, we only had
planned all of this.

460
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:36,754
We only had put these cams. And
we had got that person arrested.

461
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,027
In addition, yes, this female
would commit suicide.

462
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,363
This even I was not aware.

463
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,062
However, look at
it this way, Vick.

464
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,800
We have enormous publicity
in addition, that too at no cost.

465
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,070
That person released
on bail, Simi.

466
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,272
Now it is enough!

467
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,712
Listen to me, stop
the business that.

468
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,306
We have started on
honeymoon couples.

469
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,444
I do not understand, Vick.

470
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,718
How am I going to compete
with Playboy?

471
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:06,192
Beaten Ushe and Penthouse sites.

472
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:13,100
You know Vick, if my husband could
not stop me from all this work.

473
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,729
Then what do you think,
will I leave all this?

474
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:22,868
- But Simi we..
- Relax, baby! Relax!

475
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,212
Look, tells Johnny to take
an off for a few days.

476
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,750
In addition, ask him to come here.

477
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,181
This person cannot do us any harm.

478
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:38,420
We are too big.
So calm down, Vick!

479
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,178
Even after going away from you.

480
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,451
There is still some part
of you left in me.

481
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:53,382
Whenever I remember you
my eyes go moist.

482
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:59,038
Even after going away from you.

483
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:17,588
Life, I am still
alive without you.

484
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:26,849
There is only pain within me.

485
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:36,025
I don't want to take even a
single breath without you.

486
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:45,868
Now it has become a habit
to live like that.

487
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,020
Even after going away from me.

488
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,954
There is still some part
of you left in me.

489
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:05,554
Whenever I remember you,
my eyes go moist.

490
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,112
Kunal! Kunal, what are you doing?

491
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,582
If you don't sleep then
you will go mad!

492
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:22,713
Did you find anything
about that manager?

493
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:24,915
Police says that there
was some manager.

494
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,927
Like this but he is not there now.

495
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,930
I think they will shut
the case too.

496
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,136
Kunal! Kunal! Kunal!

497
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:43,192
Even in the darkness you
are with me every moment.

498
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:53,068
In the brightness too you
are with me every moment.

499
00:51:54,945 --> 00:52:02,945
To forget a heartbeat from
the heart is not easy.

500
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:12,163
Now it has become a habit
to live like that.

501
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,368
Even after going away from you.

502
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,751
- Tell me, where will I find him?
- I do not know. Tell me!

503
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,977
- Tell me, where will I find him?
- I do not know. I have not seen him.

504
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,709
Sir, he found
in the City Bazaar.

505
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,580
I have seen him there once.

506
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:31,640
Whenever I remember you,
my eyes go moist.

507
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,057
<i>- How is your business?</i>
- It is fine, sir.

508
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,995
<i>- How much? 50. it is.
- Yes, sir!</i>

509
00:52:53,336 --> 00:53:01,336
Now it has become a habit
to live like that.

510
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:24,772
These thoughts!

511
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,781
Come back to me!

512
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:33,788
Remove them.

513
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:38,792
Delete them!

514
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:12,750
Now it is like a habit.

515
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,097
Yes, Shah sir. Kunal has
found some things..

516
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,157
From the manager of Cease's
Palace because of.

517
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,368
Which this blue film sandal can
be completely taken care of.

518
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,104
<i>Yes we have a bag
in which there.</i>

519
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,773
<i>Are tapes, an email and some cash.</i>

520
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,113
<i>The email am from Zurich.
It is written that.</i>

521
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,448
The manager should come
there as soon as possible.

522
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,318
<i>And there are a few tapes
of new honeymoon couples.</i>

523
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:44,848
<i>I think they are the same
tapes, sir. I am sure.</i>

524
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:48,521
<i>Yes, the email is with me.
I have read it myself.</i>

525
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,725
<i>Yes, it is in my hands.
Okay sir. Okay.</i>

526
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:57,864
Kunal! Kunal! Kunal!
What are you doing?

527
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,333
If we would have taken
this to the.

528
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,149
Police says that there
was some manager.

529
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:02,686
What will it do?

530
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,145
They will arrest a few
other innocent people!

531
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,562
The will harass them and hit them!

532
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,175
Police is involved with them.

533
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,777
I have seen that with my own eyes.

534
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,818
In addition, a law of ours cannot
do anything to them.

535
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,156
Is it? Therefore, the law cannot
do anything.

536
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,525
So then what will you do? Will
you go to Zurich behind them.

537
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,432
Yes, I will do that.

538
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,165
They will have to pay the price
for what they have done to me.

539
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:39,178
The people who are running this
site of lndyaa Passion.com.

540
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:43,183
I will ruin them. Its fine if
I have to give my life for that.

541
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,649
Hey there, baby! What about us?

542
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:26,208
100 franks that is all! Come on,
please! Hey, you freak man!

543
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,767
Your lips are juicy.

544
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,842
My heart is thirsty.

545
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,815
I find your body heavenly.

546
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,284
Quite good!

547
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:58,490
Your lips are juicy.

548
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,994
My heart is thirsty.

549
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,994
I find your body heavenly.

550
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,464
10 franks please!

551
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,951
Welcome to lndyaa Passion.com.

552
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:39,731
Hello! Sir, will you take a doll.
She is as good as a lady.

553
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,301
Where will I find her?

554
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,001
Sir that is very old fashion.

555
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:52,644
The fun that is there in the
doll is not there in a woman.

556
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,482
A girl leaves and goes.
She betrays too.

557
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,783
However, a doll will never
leave and go.

558
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:05,752
Buy it once and you will be
set for the rest of your life.

559
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,693
Where will I find this girl?

560
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,328
Sir, now the profit
that we earn by.

561
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:14,994
Selling a film is not there
in selling a girl anymore.

562
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:19,337
I will give you a discount. I will
give you this free with it.

563
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:24,004
If you want to earn more money,
then meet me outside.

564
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,621
- Hello baby!
- Hey! Hi there.

565
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:52,369
What is your name?
Ali. Where are you from?

566
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,571
Actually my clad was from Luck now
however, I am international.

567
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,904
How much do you earn?

568
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:05,011
In a week 200 to 300 francs.

569
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:10,480
I will pay you 2000, help
I find that girl.

570
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:17,055
- Are you a police officer?
- No! I am a journalist.

571
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,061
I am doing a research on the
sex rate of blue films.

572
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:24,128
Especially, what is the role of
these Indian females in these?

573
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,063
In addition, why only this girl?

574
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,142
1000 franks now.

575
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,407
And the remaining after
you make me meet her.

576
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:39,008
Fine, friend! I can do
anything for money.

577
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,423
However, listen to one thing.
If you are within.

578
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,515
Limits then you will make profit.

579
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:49,757
And the place that you are
going to, it is hell.

580
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,157
You must stick to your work,
Journalist sir.

581
00:59:54,557 --> 01:00:00,166
- When do we have to go?
- I wake up in the night.

582
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,505
Therefore, we will go then.

583
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,096
Stop the tramp! Please
stop the tramp!

584
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,650
Wait!

585
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,291
That chick there is hot, man!

586
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:37,160
Hey how is business doing, man!

587
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:42,693
- Hey sweetie, how you doing?
- Hey! How are you?

588
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,626
Hey, you let go!
<i>Leave me! Leave me!</i>

589
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:30,206
Whenever darkness
prevails sneakily.

590
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:35,723
Then the moon comes out from
behind and spreads light all over.

591
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:41,091
Everywhere there is intoxication.

592
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,327
Still the heart is
thirsty for something.

593
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:56,670
Whenever darkness
prevails sneakily.

594
01:03:56,732 --> 01:04:02,045
Then the moon comes out from
behind and spreads light all over.

595
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:07,417
Everywhere there is intoxication.

596
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:11,754
Still the heart is
thirsty for something.

597
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:54,233
There is happiness and
at times sadness.

598
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:59,730
Sometimes there is a smile and
at times, the eyes are moist.

599
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:04,471
Buddy, live every moment
with a smile.

600
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:09,881
You have to go through
every kind of weather.

601
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:15,287
Fun and anxiety all prevail here.

602
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:20,350
Enjoy them, beloved.

603
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:26,495
You get out.
Everywhere there is intoxication.

604
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:31,903
Still the heart is
thirsty for something.

605
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,563
Hello?

606
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:39,774
<i>Simi</i> The great Indian
image that you portray.

607
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,441
Come and see your daughter
has come to Tantra.

608
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:44,212
<i>And that too with her girlfriend.</i>

609
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:49,981
<i>Come and take her or else our empire
will not take time to shut down.</i>

610
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,246
Take a fag.

611
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,871
Have a smoke.

612
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:21,087
Find you are beloved.

613
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:26,284
Who says to be alone.

614
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:31,526
Loneliness is not good.

615
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:36,859
You are thirsty and a
drink is there too.

616
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:42,137
Have fun with them, beloved.

617
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:48,414
Everywhere there is intoxication.

618
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:53,580
Still the heart is
thirsty for something.

619
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:59,024
- Leave me! Leave me!
- Hey you!

620
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,294
Stop! Leave the child!

621
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,666
I said leave the child and go.

622
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,238
Hey!

623
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,437
What happened, Michael?
I think we just hit someone ma'am.

624
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,340
Shut up!

625
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,208
What else is going
to happen tonight!

626
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,738
Michael, quickly get him. I cannot
be seen. Go! Go, get him.

627
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:43,085
He was just running
however, this car dashed him.

628
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,461
What is wrong? What happened?

629
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,774
Come on, hurry up! Shut the door!

630
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,359
Come on Michael. Let's
get out of here.

631
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:18,356
<i>Are you ok. Listen, relax! We will
take care of you. You will be fine.</i>

632
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,472
<i>Are you listening to me or not?</i>

633
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,565
What have you done to yourself?

634
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,701
You drug addict!

635
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,802
<i>You had gone to Sin City!</i>

636
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,813
You take drugs in front
of everyone.

637
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,246
<i>Still now you are intoxicated!
And you want to drink more!</i>

638
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,083
What is wrong with you?

639
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:57,258
Tanya, your father and me have
worked so hard for all this.

640
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,732
In addition, it is for you baby!
It is for you.

641
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:09,433
- Who were with you with?
- Jessica.

642
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,834
My girlfriend.

643
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:22,249
Listen to me! And you
listen to me properly.

644
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,224
<i>I am a very modern woman.</i>

645
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,119
However, I cannot give you
the permission.

646
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:33,132
To make love to another woman.

647
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,269
<i>I really have had
enough of all this.</i>

648
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:40,567
Your father has just died 15
days back. In addition, you are.

649
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:46,306
Have some respect for
your dead father!

650
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:51,145
Respect? What respect
are you talking about?

651
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,148
I should respect my father.

652
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,158
In addition, you. I know what
you have done.

653
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,620
How did his death happen?

654
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,163
Tell me!

655
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,366
Who gave him an overdose
of sleeping pills!

656
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,765
Shut up, Tanya!

657
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:15,164
Keeps your hands off
me, you Simi Roy!

658
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,177
You have a boy friend and you.

659
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,804
Portray as if you are
sad on my father's death.

660
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:28,412
- I will kill you! I hate you!
- Get out! I will destroy you!

661
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:35,918
I hate you! I will kill you!
I hate your face! I hate you!

662
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,794
<i>I hate you. Bitch!</i>

663
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,580
I am sorry about all that.

664
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:05,257
No ma'am I am sorry.

665
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,886
I overheard your personal
talks by accident.

666
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,329
If I knew then I would
not go that side.

667
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,226
What is your fault in this?

668
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:16,892
You did not see me getting
insulted on purpose.

669
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:24,234
At times, I wish I were in India.

670
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:28,304
Maybe I would not have all this.

671
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,742
However, I would have a
well cultured daughter.

672
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,586
Anyway, how is your
arm feeling now.

673
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:40,787
- I am fine, ma'am. Thank you.
- Good.

674
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,455
- From where are you?
- From Mumbai.

675
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,000
I am Rajeev Chawla.

676
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,501
Maybe that is why you
did not recognize me.

677
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,332
I am Simi Roy.

678
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:55,500
I am the head of Swiss Telecom
Co-operation's head.

679
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:58,010
However, I am very normal person.

680
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:04,678
In addition, what is my reach; I
try to help Indians with that.

681
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:08,449
- That is why I got you from there.
- Oh!

682
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,552
That is why I am.

683
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,285
By the way, can I ask you what?

684
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,821
Was a person like you
doing in Sin City.

685
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,366
Ma'am, I am a journalist.

686
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,304
I am getting a story ready on...

687
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,363
Indian's in pornography
in addition, sex trade.

688
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:32,844
Ma'am you are here
since a long time.

689
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,608
Do you have any contacts?

690
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,310
I was wondering if you know.

691
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,875
Anything about lndyaa Passion.com?

692
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,797
You have asked me a
very weird question.

693
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,328
If you would have asked me
that about a charitable.

694
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:58,337
Institution, any school, any
college or a holy temple.

695
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,669
Then maybe I would
be able to help you.

696
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:06,075
However, passion.dot. I am sorry.

697
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,738
I do not know anything about it.

698
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:12,409
You are right ma'am.
Thanks anyway.

699
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,345
I will leave ma'am.

700
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,054
- Mr. Chawla!
- Yes.

701
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,430
Listen to my advice.

702
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:31,699
A story is not necessarily
the way it always looks.

703
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:37,637
Whatever seen on the outside,
inside it is not the same.

704
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,972
Be away from this world.

705
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,650
It is hell out there.

706
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:53,983
Taxi! Bell View?

707
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:10,400
Vick! You and Johnny come
to me soon. It is urgent.

708
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,752
Oh! My God!

709
01:16:27,814 --> 01:16:29,418
O my God! Again he has come!

710
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:34,498
Leave this place, Ali!
Come on, leave!

711
01:16:35,755 --> 01:16:38,497
- Ali.
- Look, why are you following me?

712
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,696
There is so much space here.
Go and sit there.

713
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,762
- Here, there. I will leave.
- Ali, listens.

714
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:46,434
Look, I do not want to work with
you. You are a mad fellow.

715
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:48,604
You are making me a fool.

716
01:16:48,702 --> 01:16:51,774
You are a journalist. Journalists
drink alcohol like me.

717
01:16:51,838 --> 01:16:53,647
They sit at home and work
on their computer.

718
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,448
They not shot like you.

719
01:16:55,709 --> 01:17:00,454
Look, friend. I am scared of
death. I do not want to die.

720
01:17:00,714 --> 01:17:02,990
At least not for a 1000 francs.

721
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:06,962
I know. That is why
I am come here.

722
01:17:10,991 --> 01:17:14,461
Take this. Your remaining money.

723
01:17:14,995 --> 01:17:18,465
This is my battle. I will
fight it alone.

724
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:24,980
I cannot bear the burden
of another death. Thanks.

725
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:29,681
Hey!

726
01:17:30,944 --> 01:17:34,983
What a man are you! People do not
pay even after working.

727
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:40,496
In addition, you are paying me
without doing any work. Who are you?

728
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:55,661
Sometimes I feel that when people
cry then God feels very happy.

729
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:02,512
Otherwise why would this
have happened to you?

730
01:18:03,677 --> 01:18:07,921
Listen to me.. in addition, go
away from here. Start a new life.

731
01:18:09,849 --> 01:18:13,524
You are locking horns with
very influential people.

732
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:21,696
- Forget all this.
- Forget everything.

733
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:27,705
Forget the humiliation that
these people gave me.

734
01:18:28,134 --> 01:18:32,708
Forget that child of 13 years old.
Who forcibly brought here?

735
01:18:34,874 --> 01:18:37,081
Forget her helpless innocent eyes.

736
01:18:39,713 --> 01:18:42,557
Forget that today right
now thousands of..

737
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:45,095
People's personal lives
be pried up on.

738
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:49,064
They are being shot so that it
be sold in this open market.

739
01:18:49,723 --> 01:18:52,567
So that this billion dollars
porn industry runs smoothly.

740
01:18:54,828 --> 01:18:58,105
You can forget it, Ali.
But not me.

741
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:09,118
I was so nicely drunk.
Now I have become sober.

742
01:19:09,743 --> 01:19:15,750
My head is spinning.
Take your money.

743
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:18,589
When I will finish off your work,
then I will take it myself.

744
01:19:23,923 --> 01:19:25,766
Let us search for your Annie.

745
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:33,606
Kill Annie.

746
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:39,141
Have you gone mad, Simi!
<i>What are you saying!</i>

747
01:19:39,205 --> 01:19:40,946
Ma'am is right.

748
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:45,021
You had told me that fellow has
come here searching for that girl.

749
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:50,626
It is right. Kill Annie. So
that he does not reach us.

750
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:52,826
What has happened to you both?

751
01:19:52,952 --> 01:19:55,831
We are businesspersons. We are
running a company.

752
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:57,835
Now we will have to
become murderers.

753
01:19:57,957 --> 01:20:01,097
Leaving the business of blue films,
we will have to murder others.

754
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:02,799
What is wrong with you people!

755
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:06,637
Yeah, Vick. You are right.
We are executives.

756
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:08,110
In addition, this is my business.

757
01:20:08,168 --> 01:20:12,173
For my business's sake, if
I can murder my husband.

758
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,846
Then I do not need to worry
about this petty thing.

759
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:21,149
Okay, Vick. You just
leave this thing.

760
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:26,191
Johnny, you will do this thing
for me.

761
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:32,836
I need a true man for this work. In
addition, not a faggot for this job.

762
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,207
I will do this thing.
I will do it, Simi.

763
01:20:40,834 --> 01:20:43,212
<i>Here. We have reached
your Anne's house.</i>

764
01:20:44,337 --> 01:20:48,012
Third floor, 305. Green park
Apartments.

765
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,093
Thank you.

766
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:15,980
Hey, buddy. Take this. Car
keys. You will need it.

767
01:21:17,103 --> 01:21:21,210
If you're alive, then we'll
meet again. Greetings.

768
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:36,847
Help me! Help me! Please help me!

769
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:20,089
Get in!

770
01:24:39,072 --> 01:24:40,312
Who are you?

771
01:24:45,178 --> 01:24:46,316
Where are you taking me?

772
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:52,920
Who are you? Why do not
you answer me!

773
01:24:54,253 --> 01:24:57,928
Stop the car! I said stop the car!

774
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:09,143
Who are you? Who...

775
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:10,682
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Get out!

776
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:11,734
- Who are you?
- Get out!

777
01:25:11,798 --> 01:25:13,948
Who am I! Look! Recognize me!

778
01:25:14,107 --> 01:25:17,145
You tell me, who am I! Come on!

779
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:20,157
I'm the person whose
life you have ruined!

780
01:25:20,213 --> 01:25:23,217
You killed my wife
in addition, you ruined me!

781
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:26,491
Come on, tell me. Who are your
friends in Indyaa Passion?

782
01:25:26,552 --> 01:25:29,965
Come on, tell me. Tell me!
Otherwise, I will kill you!

783
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:35,131
- Tell me!
- Kill me! Kill me! I am tired of running!

784
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:42,978
I am tired of being beaten!
Kill me! Kill me!

785
01:25:43,035 --> 01:25:51,035
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

786
01:26:06,993 --> 01:26:08,336
Who runs Indyaa Passion?

787
01:26:11,164 --> 01:26:14,008
Who do the business of
this Indian porn world?

788
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:19,013
Who brings these ordinary
girls from India to here?

789
01:26:22,275 --> 01:26:25,017
And on whose bidding had
you anchored that movie.

790
01:26:26,179 --> 01:26:30,025
Vick. Vikram Garewal
made me do all this.

791
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:36,022
I do not know who runs
this website.

792
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:42,501
I do know that many influential
people are involved in this.

793
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:47,042
They only run Sin City.

794
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:52,513
But why did you do all
this? For money?

795
01:26:53,306 --> 01:26:57,448
How much money do you earn?
1000 dollars? 2000 dollars?

796
01:27:00,379 --> 01:27:02,256
Why did you do all this to me?

797
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:07,221
Not for money. Do you want
to know why I did it?

798
01:27:08,554 --> 01:27:10,227
Do you want to know?

799
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:23,238
<I>The earthquake in Gujarat
destroyed everything.</I>

800
01:27:25,338 --> 01:27:31,254
<i><I<My house. My family. My God.</i>

801
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:43,098
<i>The destruction everywhere
around me.</i>

802
01:27:43,155 --> 01:27:47,103
<i>Killed my devotion, my God.</i>

803
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:56,446
<i>Under these circumstances,
my uncle gave me shelter.</i>

804
01:27:57,703 --> 01:28:00,115
<i>And one day when I returned home.</i>

805
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:02,517
<i>What is the need to count?</i>

806
01:28:02,575 --> 01:28:04,282
<i>Do count it. It feels good.</i>

807
01:28:04,443 --> 01:28:06,320
One. Two.

808
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:20,126
There is heavy rainfall.
Is not it so?

809
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,139
Did you repair your umbrella?

810
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,163
Actually, I mean.

811
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:58,331
Sir, forgive me. I will just come.

812
01:29:03,436 --> 01:29:06,178
Why did you throw the money
like this before the guests?

813
01:29:10,343 --> 01:29:12,380
Do you know this is the
disrespect of Goddess?

814
01:29:15,581 --> 01:29:19,358
Anita, do you know who
these people are.

815
01:29:21,354 --> 01:29:23,356
They are very affluent people.

816
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:27,197
Their business spread from
here to foreign. Do you know?

817
01:29:28,194 --> 01:29:31,198
And they are offering you a
role in movies. Do you know?

818
01:29:32,465 --> 01:29:35,605
Come. Come.

819
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:38,542
You sold me.

820
01:29:44,477 --> 01:29:49,722
- What?
- You are my uncle. You consider me as your daughter.

821
01:29:50,549 --> 01:29:52,392
You could not even provide
me with meals.

822
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:58,233
Meals! Meals do not come cheaply!

823
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:07,408
From where will I get
the money! From where!

824
01:30:07,566 --> 01:30:12,242
Government relief money
is already over!

825
01:30:13,406 --> 01:30:18,253
Meals! Hitherto I have been selling
household items to feed you!

826
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:21,756
I had 10 machines! 10!
Now only 1 is left!

827
01:30:21,814 --> 01:30:23,521
From where will I get the money!

828
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:26,722
Now I have nothing else left
to sell, my God knows this!

829
01:30:26,786 --> 01:30:30,734
If nothing left to sell, then
will a father sell his daughter?

830
01:30:31,424 --> 01:30:35,668
Tailor master. It is 3:45h.

831
01:30:35,795 --> 01:30:38,469
How long will your drama
of crying continue?

832
01:30:41,434 --> 01:30:42,606
Come.

833
01:30:45,604 --> 01:30:50,451
Come. You do not have to stay
here. Now you come with me.

834
01:30:51,444 --> 01:30:52,616
Come.

835
01:30:57,683 --> 01:31:01,563
Will you come obediently,
alternatively, do I have to tie you up?

836
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:02,850
Taking me away from my village,
Johnny first made me sell my body.

837
01:32:05,684 --> 01:32:09,359
Then when he came to know that
business of blue film.

838
01:32:09,421 --> 01:32:12,527
Is more profitable, he
brought me to Sin City.

839
01:32:13,826 --> 01:32:16,363
And he sold me to Vick.

840
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:22,377
Since then I have been doing..
What Vick made me do.

841
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:27,877
I have committed a crime, Kunal.

842
01:32:29,909 --> 01:32:32,048
I know that I am your culprit.

843
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:39,386
And for this you can punish
me in any way you want.

844
01:33:06,745 --> 01:33:14,745
A thing of yours amazes me.

845
01:33:14,954 --> 01:33:22,954
A thing of yours amazes me.

846
01:33:23,596 --> 01:33:31,596
It was my story. But
your heart cried.

847
01:33:32,037 --> 01:33:40,037
It was my story. But
your heart cried.

848
01:33:57,796 --> 01:34:05,796
Why does he look different
from the crowd?

849
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:14,071
I see God somewhere in your heart.

850
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:22,647
You were able to understand
my tears and wounds.

851
01:34:22,888 --> 01:34:30,888
Your behavior has made
I feel emotional.

852
01:34:31,664 --> 01:34:39,664
You lived my pain.

853
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:48,039
A thing of yours amazes me.

854
01:34:48,681 --> 01:34:56,681
It was my story. But
your heart cried.

855
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,544
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Ali.

856
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:20,748
<i>Hey, buddy. Where are you?</i>

857
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:24,827
Do you want to earn more money?
This time I will pay you double.

858
01:35:25,718 --> 01:35:27,823
What else left in this
world apart from money?

859
01:35:29,955 --> 01:35:35,098
I know. Listen. Anne
told me everything.

860
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:38,572
She trapped in their net.

861
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:42,074
She doesn't even know who the
owner of India Passion is.

862
01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:47,841
Vikram Garewal. Vick. Give
me the address of this man.

863
01:35:47,906 --> 01:35:53,857
- Fine.
- Hello. Are you fine, friend?

864
01:35:55,647 --> 01:35:56,853
First class.

865
01:35:58,751 --> 01:36:02,665
- Meet me tonight at Paradise club.
- Fine. I will come.

866
01:36:06,759 --> 01:36:07,999
Your work done.

867
01:36:09,762 --> 01:36:13,209
You are a sensible person.
You will progress a lot.

868
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,604
I wish even I was so sensible
when I was young then I would...

869
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:19,945
Have had much more money
than what I have right now.

870
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:26,616
However, remember one thing.
In addition, know it well.

871
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,623
You do not know me. You
have never met me.

872
01:36:32,885 --> 01:36:36,697
- I hope you understand.
- Fine.

873
01:36:36,955 --> 01:36:42,633
Just one more step. And
all this will be yours.

874
01:36:44,296 --> 01:36:49,177
There is a saying that if
everything is working out.

875
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:51,976
As per the plan then something
does go wrong.

876
01:36:53,806 --> 01:36:55,649
Are you going to ditch us?

877
01:36:56,041 --> 01:37:00,251
No, Johnny. Do not you know that
I do everything for money.

878
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,818
Relax people.

879
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:12,167
This is the place. There.

880
01:37:15,991 --> 01:37:17,167
Right here.

881
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:22,671
The journey from here
is only for me.

882
01:37:28,006 --> 01:37:33,217
Keep this. Return to your house.

883
01:37:40,853 --> 01:37:43,697
From the time, I
have become mature..

884
01:37:43,755 --> 01:37:46,235
Nobody has given me anything
for free, Kunal.

885
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,304
Not even a penny without
touching me.

886
01:37:51,964 --> 01:37:53,705
In addition, you...

887
01:37:57,102 --> 01:38:00,709
I cannot take this money,
Kunal. Please.

888
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:07,046
No need to feel burdened by this.
I am not doing any favor.

889
01:38:11,884 --> 01:38:14,728
Before meeting you,
I used to feel that...

890
01:38:14,786 --> 01:38:17,130
My suffering is the greatest.

891
01:38:18,223 --> 01:38:19,725
Only I have seen injustice.

892
01:38:24,062 --> 01:38:26,064
I am not giving you anything.

893
01:38:26,398 --> 01:38:32,747
Lighten the burden of
your heart. Thanks.

894
01:39:14,112 --> 01:39:15,785
Rocking place. Is not it so?

895
01:39:16,114 --> 01:39:18,321
All our three works done here.

896
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:23,792
Eating. Drinking. In
addition, dancing.

897
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:33,473
You sold your conscience
for how much, buddy?

898
01:39:36,868 --> 01:39:38,142
What?

899
01:39:39,071 --> 01:39:44,316
Do not try to act smart.
Where are they?

900
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:48,151
Hey!

901
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:52,820
I do not believe this.

902
01:39:57,222 --> 01:40:00,829
You knew that we are here,
still you came here to die.

903
01:40:02,995 --> 01:40:09,503
- Not to die, I have come to kill you.
- Really?

904
01:40:11,003 --> 01:40:13,847
Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai.
Johnny-bhai.

905
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:17,909
Johnny-bhai, listen
to me. Johnny-bhai.

906
01:40:21,013 --> 01:40:25,860
Johnny-bhai. He is just a kid.
Johnny-bhai, listen to me.

907
01:40:27,019 --> 01:40:28,191
Johnny-bhai.

908
01:40:32,024 --> 01:40:34,197
What are you staring? Kill me.

909
01:40:36,261 --> 01:40:40,869
If I survive, then you'll
die. Fire the bullet!

910
01:40:41,033 --> 01:40:43,877
Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai.
Johnny-bhai.

911
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:46,406
I do not like bloodshed.

912
01:40:46,471 --> 01:40:50,886
After I go, kill him, beat him,
cut him, do whatever you want.

913
01:40:51,076 --> 01:40:54,148
My work is over. Give me
my money. I will leave.

914
01:40:54,279 --> 01:40:57,886
I will give! I will give!
Give it right now.

915
01:40:57,949 --> 01:40:59,895
First, let me fulfill his wish.

916
01:41:09,061 --> 01:41:10,233
What a shot, Ali!

917
01:41:10,295 --> 01:41:11,365
Ali!

918
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:13,501
Sorry, Johnny-bhai.

919
01:41:13,565 --> 01:41:17,103
Hitherto, I had done every work
for money. However, not today.

920
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:19,913
Ali's conscience cannot buy.

921
01:41:22,074 --> 01:41:26,181
Leave him. Leave him!
Beat him, Kunal. Beat him!

922
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:28,915
Today, do not spare him! Beat him!

923
01:41:51,269 --> 01:41:52,339
Shit!

924
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:56,942
Hey! Kill them!

925
01:42:35,313 --> 01:42:36,986
Kunal, leave him! No, Kunal!

926
01:42:37,048 --> 01:42:39,528
Kunal, do not be mad!

927
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:45,000
We will deal with them later.
Let us go! Come!

928
01:42:45,056 --> 01:42:47,002
- Kunal!
- Leave him!

929
01:42:48,326 --> 01:42:51,000
Kunal! Let us go, Kunal!

930
01:42:52,063 --> 01:42:53,667
Ali, leave me!

931
01:43:12,617 --> 01:43:14,426
Go!

932
01:43:19,357 --> 01:43:21,428
NO! Ali!

933
01:43:34,206 --> 01:43:35,378
Ali!

934
01:43:39,044 --> 01:43:40,250
Ali!

935
01:43:47,044 --> 01:43:48,250
Ali?

936
01:43:54,044 --> 01:43:56,250
Give them. Ali!

937
01:44:02,044 --> 01:44:03,250
Ali?

938
01:44:10,242 --> 01:44:12,279
Ali! Ali! Bring the cab! Ali!

939
01:44:18,416 --> 01:44:22,262
Your friendship was
too heavy for me.

940
01:44:26,491 --> 01:44:29,563
It was not a betrayal!
It was not a betrayal!

941
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:32,105
You awakened my conscience, buddy!

942
01:44:35,433 --> 01:44:40,439
Fine. Now at least I will be
able to meet God's eyes.

943
01:44:41,172 --> 01:44:43,652
Ali! Nothing will happen to
you! Nothing will happen!

944
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:47,178
Listen to me. Listen to me.

945
01:44:47,245 --> 01:44:52,126
Simi Roy. Simi Roy runs
this business. Simi Roy.

946
01:44:54,286 --> 01:44:58,291
Do not spare her.
You have my oath.

947
01:45:01,293 --> 01:45:04,331
God is with you. God is with you.

948
01:45:06,298 --> 01:45:09,677
- O God!
- Ali! Ali!

949
01:45:09,798 --> 01:45:10,798
Ali?

950
01:45:10,998 --> 01:45:11,998
Ali?

951
01:45:13,204 --> 01:45:14,478
Oh! God!

952
01:45:14,504 --> 01:45:15,504
Ali?

953
01:45:22,314 --> 01:45:26,694
Ali! My friend! Ali!

954
01:45:40,332 --> 01:45:42,175
So as you can see our
company has done.

955
01:45:42,476 --> 01:45:44,372
Extremely well in the
last financial year.

956
01:45:44,502 --> 01:45:46,175
<i>Our stocks are booming.</i>

957
01:45:46,237 --> 01:45:48,444
<i>And our business has nearly
doubled itself.</i>

958
01:45:48,573 --> 01:45:51,179
In addition, I can safely say that
we are well on our way.

959
01:45:51,242 --> 01:45:53,188
To become the number one company.

960
01:46:03,722 --> 01:46:06,202
And to let you know more
about our company.

961
01:46:06,257 --> 01:46:08,362
Ladies and men, Mr. George.

962
01:46:24,609 --> 01:46:27,385
The police have found the
corpses of Johnny and Ali.

963
01:46:27,612 --> 01:46:31,492
That person is somewhere nearby.
And he can reach to us any time.

964
01:46:33,551 --> 01:46:38,227
I saw it in his eyes, Simi.
He is not going to stop.

965
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:42,729
Let us leave Zurich. Let's
get out of here. Let us go.

966
01:46:44,496 --> 01:46:49,241
Vick, why are you a man
only in bed.

967
01:46:51,403 --> 01:46:54,748
I do not need you. You fired.

968
01:46:56,508 --> 01:46:58,715
There is still time.
Come to your senses.

969
01:46:58,777 --> 01:47:03,658
Your madness to become the number
one.. will clay kill you.

970
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:07,460
Good-bye.

971
01:47:14,592 --> 01:47:17,436
- Hello.
<i>- You were right, Simi Roy.</i>

972
01:47:18,596 --> 01:47:21,270
<i>The story is not what
it looks from outside.</i>

973
01:47:21,433 --> 01:47:24,812
It looks different from outside.
Is something else from inside.

974
01:47:25,603 --> 01:47:28,948
<i>Your guise of decency will not
save your reality for long.</i>

975
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:31,953
My dying friend told
me everything. And.

976
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:35,822
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i> What
Is your name? Kunal.

977
01:47:36,681 --> 01:47:41,357
Look, listen carefully
to what I have to say.

978
01:47:43,621 --> 01:47:47,899
Yes. Indyaa Passion.com
is my site.

979
01:47:48,793 --> 01:47:53,833
<i>And I was the one who got you
arrested for marketing of my site.</i>

980
01:47:54,632 --> 01:48:00,310
However, your wife committed suicide.
I am not responsible for that.

981
01:48:01,573 --> 01:48:05,578
People who watch blue films
are responsible for this.

982
01:48:06,644 --> 01:48:09,318
<i>This is the rule of
demand and supply.</i>

983
01:48:09,647 --> 01:48:12,389
If there is a demand, then
we have to supply for it.

984
01:48:12,484 --> 01:48:15,590
If not me, then somebody
else will do it.

985
01:48:16,654 --> 01:48:18,725
<i>So don't take it personally, son.</i>

986
01:48:19,724 --> 01:48:27,724
This is the modern time. Here,
one's pain is show for another.

987
01:48:29,667 --> 01:48:34,343
You do one thing. Come
here. Let us meet.

988
01:48:34,606 --> 01:48:36,847
We will try to sort it out.

989
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:42,558
Money is that cure that
can heal all wounds.

990
01:48:43,748 --> 01:48:45,352
No, Simi Roy.

991
01:48:46,684 --> 01:48:50,632
Now I'll make your state same as what
you have made of the rest of us.

992
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:58,572
I will speak your language.
I am coming, Simi Roy.

993
01:48:59,697 --> 01:49:01,370
I am coming to get you.

994
01:49:58,423 --> 01:50:02,428
Sometimes we have to become bad
to do something good, Kunal.

995
01:50:05,697 --> 01:50:10,612
Believe me, I am not doing this for
you. I am doing it for myself.

996
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:39,734
Hi.

997
01:50:42,634 --> 01:50:43,942
What are you doing here?

998
01:50:44,002 --> 01:50:45,481
I have come to meet you.

999
01:50:49,807 --> 01:50:50,877
Let us go.

1000
01:51:24,909 --> 01:51:26,855
I recognize you. You rascal!

1001
01:51:27,045 --> 01:51:30,117
Are not you the one who had
crashed with my car?

1002
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:34,786
Why are you following
me like this!

1003
01:51:34,919 --> 01:51:37,119
What do you want? Speak!
What do you want! I will shoot.

1004
01:51:38,589 --> 01:51:40,000
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1005
01:51:41,926 --> 01:51:44,532
However, by doing this you will
lose the last chance.

1006
01:51:44,595 --> 01:51:47,132
To take revenge with
your greatest enemy.

1007
01:51:47,699 --> 01:51:48,871
Enemy?

1008
01:51:50,868 --> 01:51:52,541
Yes. Simi Roy.

1009
01:51:54,939 --> 01:52:00,048
- I need your help to ruin Simi Roy.
- Yes. How?

1010
01:52:10,888 --> 01:52:15,098
- Hello.
<i>- Simi there is a big problem.</i>

1011
01:52:16,828 --> 01:52:21,573
- What happened, Vick?
<i>- Simi, that Tanya.</i>

1012
01:52:21,632 --> 01:52:24,169
Vick. Stop crying like
a child. What happened?

1013
01:52:24,736 --> 01:52:27,114
<i>Simi, you did not watch
the TV yet.</i>

1014
01:52:27,739 --> 01:52:29,844
<i>Simi put on the goddamn
television.</i>

01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:32,581
<i>- Switch on the TV and see Simi.</i>

1016
01:52:53,865 --> 01:52:55,867
What do you have to say
about the sex scandal?

1017
01:52:57,135 --> 01:52:59,137
Was the sex scandal
about your daughter?

1018
01:53:00,772 --> 01:53:01,876
What did you say lndyaa
Passion.com?

1019
01:53:01,939 --> 01:53:03,539
Do you have any connection
with Sin City?

What did you say?
What is going on?

1021

What did you say?
What is going on?

01:53:07,675 --> 01:53:09,435
Who let them in?
Who let them in?

1023
01:53:12,283 --> 01:53:14,627
Who let them in?

1024
01:53:14,685 --> 01:53:18,792
Get them out of here.
Get them out of here.

1025
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:21,632
Get out of my house. Get out.
Get out. Everybody out.

1026
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:41,652
<i>Shockingly back in the

1030
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,667
<i>But it is believed that Simi
Roy owns lndyaa Passion.com.</i>

1031
01:53:52,723 --> 01:53:54,669

01:54:22,854 --> 01:54:28,361
Vick. Damn you! Bloody
hell. Vick. Vick.

1035
01:54:28,693 --> 01:54:32,698
You saw Tanya, on TV, on
my site. My daughter.

1036
01:54:32,864 --> 01:54:37,370
Vick. You bastard! Shut down
the goddamn site. Vick!

1037
01:54:37,869 --> 01:54:39,712
Shut it down.

1038
01:55:02,894 --> 01:55:04,896
Why are you trying to shut
down the website now?

1039
01:55:06,898 --> 01:55:08,900
Whatever you wished
for is happening now.

1040
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,905
The number of hits is increasing.

1041
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:18,747
Very soon lndyaa Passion.com is
going to become the No.1 Porn Site.

1042
01:55:19,911 --> 01:55:21,913
Now where did the custom
of your market, disappear?

1043
01:55:22,013 --> 01:55:23,933
And what about the policies
of demand and supply?

1044
01:55:27,218 --> 01:55:30,756
The agony of one person becomes
fun for others. Simi Roy?

1045
01:55:33,925 --> 01:55:38,032
Now your agony will become a joke
for the whole world. Understood?

1046
01:55:43,768 --> 01:55:47,306
I hate you. I will kill
you, you bastard.

1047
01:55:50,107 --> 01:55:52,781
You used to have great fun by
making blue films of other women..

1048
01:55:53,411 --> 01:55:56,358
And showing it to the world without
their knowledge. Did not you?

1049
01:55:56,948 --> 01:55:59,792
And now, when your daughter
is doing all this.

1050
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:02,210
With her own wish, you are
suddenly acting like a mother.

1051
01:56:15,066 --> 01:56:20,812
Why are you looking at me
like this? Yes, I did it.

1052
01:56:21,072 --> 01:56:25,987
I did all this. You took the
life of my father, right.

1053
01:56:26,143 --> 01:56:29,283
Because he had tried
to put a stop.

1054
01:56:29,347 --> 01:56:31,293
To your business of blue films.

1055
01:56:36,087 --> 01:56:38,829
That is why I did it
to get back at you.

1056
01:56:43,094 --> 01:56:45,836
God! How I wish I could
you kill you.

1057
01:56:46,998 --> 01:56:49,842
I wish I could kill you
with my own hands.

1058
01:57:01,178 --> 01:57:08,118
I will kill you. I will kill you. I
will kill you, you bloody bastard.

1059
01:57:09,178 --> 01:57:10,178
Sure?

1060
01:57:27,138 --> 01:57:28,938
I wish I could fire all
the bullets of this...

1061
01:57:29,202 --> 01:57:30,545
Gun into your body.

1062
01:57:33,277 --> 01:57:36,349
However, I remember the values
of my dead father.

1063
01:57:38,282 --> 01:57:39,886
When somebody has seen someone...

1064
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:44,228
Dying in front of him, he cannot
take the life of anyone.

1065
01:57:46,424 --> 01:57:48,563
Not even of a witch like you.

1066
01:58:57,294 --> 01:58:59,296
<i>In this unusual incident
of modern times.</i>

1067
01:58:59,363 --> 01:59:02,242
<i>Yesterday night in Zurich,
Tanya Roy killed.</i>

1068
01:59:02,299 --> 01:59:04,973

who was the head of.</i>

1069
01:59:05,035 --> 01:59:06,981
<i>Swiss Telecom Communication.</i>

1070
01:59:07,238 --> 01:59:09,478
<i>The main reason for this death
is due to the fact that...</i>

1071
01:59:09,622 --> 01:59:11,519
Simi Roy used to run
lndyaa Passion.com.

1072
01:59:11,575 --> 01:59:13,521
- Come soon!
- What is the matter?

1073
01:59:13,577 --> 01:59:16,456
<i>The Mumbai high court took
an important decision.</i>

1074
01:59:16,514 --> 01:59:18,554
<i>By releasing Kunaldar and
stating him as not guilty.</i>

1075
01:59:18,578 --> 01:59:20,988
<i>And CBI ordered to
do proper investigations.</i>

1076
01:59:21,051 --> 01:59:24,328
<i>Against all those who are
associated with lndyaa Passion.com.</I>

1077
01:59:25,156 --> 01:59:28,000
<i>Mr. Kunal's lawyer is now with us.</i>

1078
01:59:28,993 --> 01:59:31,997
<i>Kunal have not only proved
himself innocent.</i>

1079
01:59:32,062 --> 01:59:35,009
<i>But he has also freed
all those Asian girls.</i>

1080
01:59:35,065 --> 01:59:38,205
<i>Who trapped in this porn
industry due to helplessness.</i>

1081
01:59:38,269 --> 01:59:40,476
<i>And in which they were
doing business of sex.</i>

1082
02:00:13,304 --> 02:00:14,442
Thank you.

1083
02:00:21,312 --> 02:00:24,054
Do you know that this girl
was waiting for you.

1084
02:00:24,114 --> 02:00:26,060
The whole night with this flower.

1085
02:00:28,452 --> 02:00:35,062
Not only that, all the girls here,
who do have freedom.

1086
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:38,231
Because of you, are praying
for your long life.

1087
02:00:40,397 --> 02:00:43,606
- When is your flight?
- In an hour.

1088
02:00:45,402 --> 02:00:47,609
Now what are you going to do?

1089
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:53,254
I do not know. Suddenly
I have freedom.

1090
02:00:54,678 --> 02:00:57,249
I really do not know
what I am going to do.

1091
02:00:59,416 --> 02:01:03,091
Leave me. You are happy right.

1092
02:01:06,423 --> 02:01:09,097
You know Annie. When I came
from India to here.

1093
02:01:09,159 --> 02:01:12,106
I wanted to take revenge
against those people.

1094
02:01:12,162 --> 02:01:14,608
Who ruined my life.

1095
02:01:15,266 --> 02:01:18,110
Now even after completing
that objective.

1096
02:01:18,168 --> 02:01:20,114
I do not have peace.

1097
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:27,618
Today I understood that my father
used to say the right thing.

1098
02:01:29,446 --> 02:01:32,120
That to remove pain
from your heart.

1099
02:01:32,182 --> 02:01:35,459
Remove the thorn causing
pain in other is feet.

1100
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,201
Will you come with me?

1101
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:27,201
Human trafficking is the third
largest moneymaking business.

1102
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:29,201
After arms and narcotic
trafficking.

1103
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:33,201
Most women who are victims of
human trafficking.

1104
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:35,250
Land up in the porn business.

1105
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:42,201
It is time we fight
this menace together.
