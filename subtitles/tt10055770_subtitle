1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000


3
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,167
I don't see anybody here.

4
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,375
No one is here....

5
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,500
Who ...? Who are you?

6
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,042
No... no... please...

7
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,875
This is how the murders have happened.

8
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,125
When they were alone, the killer has brutally attacked them.

9
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,375
Sir, the jewels in the bed room are also stolen.

10
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:50,542
If the motive is for jewels, then why has he not taken Lalitha's jewels?

11
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,542
It is a personal revenge.

12
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,000
Where is the owner's dog?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,917
There was no dog here sir.

14
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,750
Then whose plate is this?

15
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,333
The dog should be nearby. Go search!

16
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,750
Sir!

17
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,500
The dog is refusing to come inside.

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Why is the dog not coming in?

19
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,375
It must be scared of something...

20
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,667
Just a minute!

21
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,167
Give me that phone.

22
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,875
Sir. There is no sim card in this phone.

23
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,958
This is the 'Dog Taunt' App.

24
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,250
When the app is switched on,

25
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,000
high frequency sound is emitted.

26
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,000
We are not able to hear this,

27
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,000
but the dogs can hear and they're afraid.

28
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,542
The killer used this app to control the dog.

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,000
He has come prepared knowing there is a dog here.

30
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,083
Why did he attack a small girl?

31
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,667
He has strangled her neck.

32
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,375
She might have seen the murder.

33
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,875
So, in his hurry he would have....

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,167
He was not in any hurry for anything

35
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,500
He was stable

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,458
Why should she alone be strangled?

37
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,750
This is very personal.

38
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:42,792
Inspector!

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,458
Sir.

40
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,833
Call all the securities who were on night duty yesterday.

41
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,250
Yes Sir.

42
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,542
These are the securities who were on duty last night in this area.

43
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,500
Both of you can go.

44
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:25,125
Sir inquiry?
Your inquiry is over

45
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,125
Let’s go! Let’s go!

46
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,333
Where are you both working?

47
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,333
Next street, second house, sir.

48
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,458
You?

49
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
Third house from here.

50
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,625
Did you both see anyone looking suspicious last night?

51
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,708
No, we didn't.

52
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,458
Why are you scratching your head?

53
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,417
Were you drunk?

54
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,292
You are a security. Don't you have your owner here?

55
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,292
Owner is out of town to attend a marriage.

56
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,042
What about you?

57
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,917
Owner lives in Singapore.

58
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,917
For 3 months in a year they come and stay here.

59
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,167
I oversee the Security and Maintenance.

60
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,667
Oh...You take care of everything is it?

61
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,167
Yes Sir.

62
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,292
Good for you...

63
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,333
Are you renting this place out illegally?

64
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,375
No sir. Nothing like that.

65
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,208
Pity you are not clever to take advantage.

66
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,125
Don't you wear a cap?

67
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,417
Sometimes, Sir.

68
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,750
Why is your dress wrinkled?

69
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,500
I was on night duty, Sir.

70
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:22,875
Come in Inspector.

71
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,292
The person who committed these murders....

72
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,292
...is Mr. Das!

73
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,875
Sir! Sir! It was not me...

74
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,208
Get lost!

75
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,667
Mr. Rudhran, why do you think he committed these murders?

76
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,375
Selvi is a very small kid.

77
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,208
He had been watching her when she went to school.

78
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,000
One day when she was alone, he took her and …

79
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,208
She has tried to communicate in her diary in her own way.

80
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,708
How are you certain that he is the killer?

81
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,042
Selvi had struggled when he was strangling her neck...

82
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:01,417
A red thread from his cap's logo was caught in between her fingernails.

83
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:04,667
There was also a phone with the 'Dog Taunt' app.

84
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,333
Securities use the app to control the dogs.

85
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,750
So, I interrogated all the securities in that area...

86
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,875
Everyone was wearing their caps, except one.
The red thread should have come from his cap.

87
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,667
The other security guards had wrinkled uniforms, because they were on night duty.

88
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,333
But this guy's uniform was fresh.

89
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,125
Based on these facts I confirmed the killer.

90
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,667
Your next case is in USA.

91
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:25,667
What do you mean? In USA?

92
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:29,542
Yes. Isn't your son Ajay working for Microsoft in Seattle?

93
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,750
Yes, Sir.

94
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,250
Rudhran, how long will you stay without talking to him?

95
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,375
It has been about 3 years, right?

96
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:37,625
Go to him

97
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,750
Forget the past. Go and stay with your son and mend your relationship.

98
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,875
But why, Sir?

99
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,167
You are going. Not as a police officer but as a father.

100
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,042
Hi dad!

101
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,042
Welcome to US

102
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,833
How are you?

103
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,875
How was your journey?

104
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,125
Give me your bag.

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,375
Where are the other bags?

106
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,833
It is there.

107
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,125
Dad, you go inside. I will bring the bags

108
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,250
Hello Dad.

109
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,875
Dad...come inside.

110
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,333
Do you like the house?

111
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,333
It's all Alice's touch.

112
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,875
I am feeling tired now.

113
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,417
Your room is upstairs.

114
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,458
Dad, this is your room.

115
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,000
That's Mount Rainier.

116
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,333
Still an active volcano. They say it may erupt any time.

117
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,500
Do you see those buildings? That's Downtown. We came through there.

118
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,083
When you wake up in the morning the view is beautiful.

119
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:55,833
Here is the TV... Wi-Fi network is Lakshmi Illam.

120
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:57,875
Mom's name!

121
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,417
It has been years since I saw this photograph.

122
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,667
Dad let me keep it in the living room.

123
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,083
We need one more like this with Alice.

124
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,042
Feeling sleepy?

125
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,125
Please go to sleep.

126
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,125
If you are hungry you can have food or fruits

127
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,958
I will see you in the morning.

128
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,083
Hi Rudhran?

129
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,708
You hesitated so much to go to America. How is life there?

130
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,292
When you stand on the balcony with a cup of coffee in the morning,

131
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,250
you are reminded of the crowded streets in India.

132
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,167
The Garbage truck comes without fail on Wednesday

133
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,625
You know how clean the Garbage Truck is?

134
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,500
Is the garbage truck important now?

135
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,333
Did you meet new people?

136
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,958
Yes. People are waiting in line to become my friend.

137
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,833
But I prefer to stay with my son and daughter-in-law.

138
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,500
Oh. Good. Finally, you spoke to Ajay?

139
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,167
Not only Ajay. Even the refrigerator speaks to me!

140
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,750
Eh!? Leave that...

141
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,458
How about your daughter in law?

142
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,667
What's the hurry? I have just started speaking to the refrigerator.

143
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,542
Confusing....What are you doing now?

144
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,708
Now? I am going to have breakfast.

145
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,625
Oh! What is for breakfast?

146
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,625
Hot rice cakes...

147
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,792
Drumstick curry.

148
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,792
Filter coffee along with that.

149
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,375
What happened?

150
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,167
Nothing. A small mustard seed was caught in my teeth.

151
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,167
Your smart mouth has landed you in a virtual jail!

152
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:13,167
New place... New people... just because you are bored, don't go looking for trouble.

153
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,167
That's all I can say. Take care. Bye!

154
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,792
I feel sorry for Syria. When will all this end?

155
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,458
Problems can be solved when people think rationally instead of being emotional.

156
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,458
Sorry. I think from now on I will cook what I want to eat.

157
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,458
This is like lemon rice in India.

158
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:20,208
Instead of something like lemon rice, I wish I could eat lemon rice itself.

159
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,125
Tell me where we can get masala and vegetables. I will go and buy.

160
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,458
Dad. Please try.

161
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,125
Eh! There is nothing here.

162
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,583
He has taken everything.

163
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,125
Are they all pranking me?

164
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,750
Sir. Do you speak Tamil?

165
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,958
I am Bharathidasan.

166
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,333
People call me Bharathi.

167
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,333
I am from Trichy. What about you?

168
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,583
I worked in BHEL for 32 years.

169
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,583
I have come to the US after that. You?

170
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,542
Is this your first visit? It's my second.

171
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,750
I never hear people speaking Tamil here!

172
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,750
Only if you give a chance can I speak

173
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,708
Shall we leave?

174
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,625
I came with my son, Ajay.

175
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,083
He is there.

176
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,167
Looks like dad and uncle have met.

177
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,083
On the other side is Ramya.

178
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,125
Do you know them?

179
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,375
I know her mother too.

180
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,583
Have you started your shenanigans?

181
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,208
My mom and dad.

182
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,292
Dad. We both work at Microsoft

183
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,375
What is car pool?

184
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,542
We both go to office in the same car.

185
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,375
They will also come back in the same car.

186
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,875
Look at him. He is shouting for not giving him a bag of chips.

187
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,167
Dad. Keep quiet. He is talking to his wife.

188
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,583
Stop your shenanigans.

189
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,375
As it is uncle does not like the US.

190
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,500
You don't like the US!?

191
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,458
Ask people like me who are experienced in US way of life.

192
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,708
Old people like us have a full-time job here.

193
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,375
What is that?

194
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,417
Going for walks!

195
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,750
Join me tomorrow.

196
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,375
There is a beautiful girl named Brittany on 130th street who....

197
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,917
My god. What is this?

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,333
I was about to say that she makes good coffee.

199
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,458
Be ready at 10 AM tomorrow.

200
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
I will come exactly at 10:30 AM.

201
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:03,833
Dad please. Sorry uncle. Dad will meet you when I come to pick up Ajay.

202
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,042
Bhai (brother)

203
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:24,167
Hi... He is staring like he's the Pakistan cricket captain!

204
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,292
You are right dad, he is from Pakistan.

205
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,583
It's been 3 months since we moved here.

206
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,292
I have not seen him talk to anybody yet.

207
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,000
In fact, his daughter is studying in Alice's school.

208
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,292
Okay sure. I am going to my room now.

209
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,875
Are you angry?

210
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:01,292
How can you be bored with a girl like her next door?!

211
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,917
How old do you think...

212
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,333
Approximately thirty years...

213
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,208
I was asking about us, not her!

214
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,208
♫ These faces, not strange anymore ♫

215
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:18,208
♫ These places, feelin' like home more & more  ♫

216
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,208
♫ I will become familiar with ♫

217
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:26,208
♫ new cuisines, my palate is catching up. ♫

218
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:33,208
♫ Strange! I am a stranger no more! ♫

219
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:38,208
♫ These faces, not strange anymore ♫

220
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:43,208
♫ These places, feelin' like home more & more  ♫

221
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,708
♫ Roadside tea shops ♫

222
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:59,208
♫ Chatting with friends ♫

223
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,208
♫ Traffic jams, the blowing horn ♫

224
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,208
♫ Lovers' faces!Oh! The longing, oh! The love..  ♫

♫ Filmstars peeking from posters... ♫

226
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,208
♫ Metro water trucks, plastic pitchers chasing them. ♫

227
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,208
♫ Filmstars peeking from posters... ♫

228
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,208
♫ Metro water trucks, plastic pitchers chasing them. ♫

229
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,208
♫ Cant see them here. ♫

230
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:26,208
♫ Oh the tragedy.. ♫

231
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,208
♫ I will soon miss feeling remiss ♫

♫ These places, feelin' like home more & more ♫

234
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:57,167
Uncle, bathroom is on the other side.

235
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,083
Oh ok! Sorry.

236
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,333
Do you like it here in US? How is life?

237
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,042
Everything feels new here.

238
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:24,000
But the quietness is kind of bothering.

239
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,042
If it were India, it would have been exciting with cases and investigations.

240
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:32,042
Retired life is not a T20 (cricket) match,

241
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,333
to always be happening and exciting.

242
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,000
It is more like a test match where scoring even 10 runs a day would suffice.

243
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,750
That is the beauty of it.

244
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,083
Haven't we seen these guys in our neighborhood?

245
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,667
Sir what are you doing?

246
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,667
Creating a ruckus at school!

247
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,917
Have to show them what a cop can do.

248
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:03,542
Hey! Who are you? What is happening here?

249
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:10,625
Go home!

250
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,750
Get lost!

251
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:47,375
Why are you getting involved in other people's business?

252
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,375
Those guys are usually loitering in our neighborhood.

253
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,125
What if they cause problems for us? What will we do?

254
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,875
Dad, he is from that group!

255
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,292
Dad! No, don't!

256
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,292
I'm going to call 911 and report them.

257
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:44,708
Why?

258
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,917
I've seen a 1000 people like this.

259
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,292
They bark, but they don't bite.

260
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:52,292
Dad, This place is not like India.

261
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,292
At least in India, dogs bark.

262
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:56,292
It does not even do that here.

263
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,708
I'm here to take care of it, son.

264
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,958
Dad, do you want to tour Seattle tomorrow?

265
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,917
Oh.. you don't have to take a day off for this....
Ajay: That's no problem, dad!

266
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,417
Dad, we can go right?

267
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,250
Dad, let's leave.

268
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,250
♫ Skin color different, depth of love (or loss) the same ♫

269
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,250
♫ Am I lost or am I new (person)? ♫

270
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,250
♫ Am I a new person here? ♫

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,250

279
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,167
Dad, do you like US?

280
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,458
You have everything here,

281
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,167
yet something is missing.

282
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,792
What do you think is missing?

283
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,208
Dad! What are the police doing in front of our house??

284
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,542
What happened, Bharathi?

285
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,583
Mona has been kidnapped.

286
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,500
No one knows what happened.

287
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,333
They are questioning Mona's boyfriend, Jeff.

288
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,750
Come, lets go inside.

289
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,625
Die!

290
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,917
This is how Mona must have been kidnapped.

291
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,458
What are you doing outside in the middle of the night?

292
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,750
Dad, The security system will be ON

293
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,875
all the time. Henceforth,

294
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,792
Do not go out at night anymore.

295
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:47,417
You should be in the house by 7 PM.

296
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,375
And when you go out you must text me.

297
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,917
Oh, you are imposing curfew on me!

298
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,958
You think you can dictate terms to me,

299
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:56,583
My foot!

300
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,458
Why is he behaving like this?

301
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:08,625
What was the need to go out now?

302
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,958
Mona has been kidnapped. So, why are we going to her store?

303
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,625
I am terrified.

304
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:24,292
Even now it is not too late. Can we go back?

305
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,583
This is unnecessary.

306
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:28,375
If you really felt that way,
you would not have come all this way.

307
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,125
There is no harm scoring boundaries in a test match.

308
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,167
Mona Photo Studio. This is the building...

309
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,042
Is that the same cop?

310
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,958
Let's go let's go. Else you might get caught.

311
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,417
Dad went investigating last night.

312
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,292
Come on in.

313
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,125
Uncle, I am hearing a lot of complaints about you?

314
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,333
Complaints about a cop? What complaints?

315
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,542
Heard you went investigating at midnight.

316
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:36,292
If there is a crime, some people will talk, some people will get in action.

317
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,417
Did Ajay ask you to interrogate me?

318
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,042
Where did you both go?

319
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,500
To Mona’s Photo studio.

320
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,292
Why? Only yesterday you got caught by the cops. Why again?

321
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:50,083
I went there only for the family photo.

322
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,917
I am home by 7 PM as per your curfew.

323
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,750
Dad... no iPad while eating.

324
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,250
Don't eat that. It has meat.

325
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,375
Oh, it looked like veg fritters.

326
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,208
Yeah right.

327
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:46,167
Dad... Don't think about the case now.

328
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,167
Rudhran sir, what Ajay says is correct.
Why are you worried unnecessarily?

329
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,667
Cops will take care of it.

330
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,208
Mom. He is also a cop.

331
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,458
But he is retired.

332
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:00,083
So what? I am still a cop.

333
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,250
Suppose I was a retired doctor,

334
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,083
And Bharathi has a sudden cardiac failure.

335
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,292
Careful! Drink this.

336
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,500
I was just joking!

337
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,625
Should I do nothing? Or should I treat him?

338
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,750
Dad. It requires skill to be a doctor.

339
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,375
But to be a cop skill alone is not enough.

340
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:22,000
It is not just a job, it is a frame of mind.

341
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,167
Not everyone can become a cop.

342
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:31,667
There's no need for cops... I'll tell you what happened to Mona.

343
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,292
Mom... Don't get started now.

344
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:36,583
Lets pause your investigations.
First, tell me who made the fritters?

345
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,167
And why is it burnt so much?

346
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,250
I think the man in the next house...

347
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,833
You're saying he burnt these?

348
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,917
He should have done something to that girl.

349
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,458
I have seen them exchanging angry looks often.

350
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,167
Isn't he a Pakistani?

351
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,083
Mom!!

352
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,042
Are you saying all Pakistanis are terrorists?

353
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:55,625
They should put a ban on you.

354
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:59,042
Wouldn't that be nice? I would have had a peaceful life.

355
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:01,042
I should have left you alone in India.

356
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:08,833
You said that the African-American man was creating trouble the other day, right?

357
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:16,083
Rudhran sir. Wasn't that the same day he picked a fight with Mona too, you said?

358
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:19,125
Both of you are stereotyping much like Trump.

359
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,583
Why is nobody suspecting Jeff?

360
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:25,500
In these types of crimes,
the boyfriend is always the main suspect!

361
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,667
He definitely looks like...

362
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:29,792
Ramya, aren't you stereotyping now?

363
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:34,417
You should not be biased in an investigation.

364
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,875
So, you mean Jeff is innocent?

365
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,542
No. I say he 'may' or 'may not' be a suspect.

366
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,958
Uncle, the US cops are different from Indian cops.

367
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:47,625
Wait. They would have thoroughly investigated before detaining him.

368
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:52,375
You only said the other day that Jeff and Mona had a fight.

369
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,125
Jeff should have done something to Mona.

370
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,458
Bharathi, Ramya is still immature.

371
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:05,250
If couples begin to kidnap and kill each other for small fights...

372
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,333
there won't be anyone left in this world.

373
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:12,875
Sir. Get Ramya married soon.

374
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,125
Ramya. Please, Wait.

375
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,167
Sorry for the trouble.

376
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:38,375
I should apologize for Ramya's behavior yesterday.

377
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,250
I should be the one apologizing.

378
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,583
Ajay told me about everything just yesterday.

379
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:48,583
I left everything back home for Ramya.

380
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:52,792
I came to the US to take care of her.

381
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:56,458
She was happy and settled.

382
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,833
Everything was going well until....

383
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,958
Adhi...... my son-in-law....

384
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:09,750
After he died, she was devastated.

385
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,875
Everything changed, even her behavior.

386
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:18,583
Depression, medicines, therapy, all put together....

387
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,667
That one accident changed everything in her life.

388
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:27,167
Sorry Bharathi. I should not have disturbed you.

389
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,500
You don’t have to apologize.

390
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:37,667
In fact, I need such a distraction.

391
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,417
Otherwise, I will also go mad.

392
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:42,625
Come on.

393
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,625
You need a change. Come with me.

394
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,833
Stella. Two.

395
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,000
Who is Stella?

396
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,042
That is the name of a beer.

397
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:09,917
Coming back to what we were discussing yesterday....

398
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:16,125
You said that Jeff could not be the person who kidnapped Mona. How?

399
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:19,417
When we went to Mona's Studio, I found some clues.

400
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,875
She goes to the studio only three days a week.

401
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:27,708
Mary is in charge rest of the days.

402
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,500
Mary looks after the studio very well.

403
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,083
That is not important now.

404
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:36,125
Kidnapper knew she was home that day.

405
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,042
He came through the main entrance.

406
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,375
No forced entry.

407
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:46,333
So, either Mona knows him

408
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:52,833
or it must be someone who Mona will not question to let in.

409
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:56,125
You mean like a plumber, electrician etc.?

410
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,333
That's a possibility.

411
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,083
How do we find who it is?

412
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,083
Bharathi!

413
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:09,708
I saw the kid before the police arrived at the scene the other day.

414
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,417
Which kid?

415
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:15,000
That kid with the skate board who hangs out in our neighborhood.

416
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,500
Why was he there at that time?

417
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
How is he connected with Mona?

418
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,958
If we talk to him, we might get a clue.

419
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,333
This boy Carlos......

420
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,000
Dad!

421
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,625
You are retired.

422
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,125
I have to keep reminding you again and again.

423
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:42,083
Why don't you watch movies on Netflix or Tentkotta like other Indian parents?

424
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,083
When have I done that?

425
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,458
Ok. You can go out with Bharathi uncle to the park etc.

426
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:51,042
I already spend so much time with him. I'm getting bored.

427
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,417
Then do something you like.

428
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,833
That is what I am doing now.

429
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,875
All this smart talk is good....

430
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,250
But you will not make an effort to speak with Alice.

431
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:07,458
How many times will she keep trying to speak with you!

432
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:11,458
You avoid her even if she tries to make conversations.

433
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:16,333
Poor little thing... She lost both her parents when she was a kid.

434
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,083
She has no one other than us!

435
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:24,042
Is falling in love such a big crime?

436
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:27,917
Even if it is, I am the one who did it!
Why are you punishing her?

437
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,500
Say something?

438
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,000
You are also behaving like an old-school person.

439
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:50,542
Have I ever told you love is a crime? Have I?

440
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:53,417
What a stupid question!

441
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,375
The crime was not that you fell in love,

442
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,292
nor that you told me...

443
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:00,583
But when did you tell me?! That was the mistake.

444
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:06,792
Did I not ask you before I made all arrangements for your wedding at our place?

445
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:11,333
You said yes for everything.

446
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,792
And just two days before the marriage,

447
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:19,667
You called and said you were not coming and that you were in love with Alice.

448
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:23,542
Did you even think about how the other girl will feel?

449
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,708
Did you at least think about me?

450
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,750
Okay... Leave that.

451
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:34,250
I raised you like a friend so that you don't feel lost without your mother.

452
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,250
You could have told me at least.

453
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:40,792
You all become too selfish after coming to the US

454
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:44,625
You think that the world revolves around you and you forget everything else.

455
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,125
Hey! Hey!

456
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:49,000
I am talking to you and you are walking away!

457
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,250
Hello Rudhran. How is life?

458
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,375
F#$% you. Put the phone down!

459
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:04,167
Rudhran Sir, Ramya told me Ajay was angry and left for work by himself instead of carpooling.

460
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,667
You can trust the person who says he does not like his father.

461
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:11,833
But not the one who says that he is more of a friend to his father.

462
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,042
Why? What happened?

463
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,083
This Ajay....

464
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,250
Forget it. We will discuss that later.

465
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,375
We have a new case to discuss.

466
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:24,208
Carlos, the kid on the skateboard has gone missing.

467
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,292
When was this?

468
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,792
Yesterday. We are headed to that crime scene.

469
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,792
Crime scene?!!

470
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:35,167
If we figure out how the crime is done

471
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,667
then we will understand many things about the criminal.

472
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,708
Why did he do it? Will he repeat it?

473
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,208
We will be able to answer these questions and more.

474
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,833
Damn! He totally flipped the story.

475
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,333
She is wherever we go!

476
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:28,000
She is a cop. She will be there at the crime scene.

477
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,292
Yeah okay... you are also a cop.

478
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:34,000
If you go wherever she goes, she will be there.

479
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,250
Leave all this. Why don't you try to pacify Ajay?

480
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:42,042
How can I?! He walks away in the middle of the conversation.

481
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:44,000
It's okay Rudhran.

482
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,833
We see our kids as friends, but we can't expect the same from them.

483
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,583
Also, Alice is a nice girl, Sir.

484
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:54,667
If you start talking to her, half your problems will be solved.

485
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:59,708
Sir. Will you talk to her?

486
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:07,333
So, we have to go back to that place early tomorrow.

487
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,333
Why?

488
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,792
To avoid the police.

489
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:12,708
What happened?

490
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,708
I banged my head on purpose!

491
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,750
Ajay, I want to ...

492
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,083
I am going to Bharathi's house.

493
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:47,583
I will be back around 7 or 8 PM.

494
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,958
Please inform Ajay.

495
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,958
Hmmm... She is a nice girl.

496
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,167
I spoke to Alice.

497
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,333
Does Ajay know that?

498
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,667
No. He is still angry with me.

499
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:08,125
I will tell him later in the evening.

500
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,125
Oh no! They have cleared everything.

501
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,083
Thank god!

502
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:18,750
What?

503
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,333
Nothing.

504
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:29,542
Even if he stops, these people don't leave us.

505
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,417
Bharathi... come fast.

506
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:06,250
The only thing he has not taken today is a plane.

507
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:09,792
Bharathi. Do you know how to swim?

508
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:15,833
What is this Rudhran sir?

509
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,875
You are peeping into Mona's house.

510
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:20,417
Or you are chasing these African-American men.

511
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:22,417
I don't understand what you are doing.

512
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,208
Be patient Bharathi.

513
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,375
These two cases are linked.

514
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:29,708
How?

515
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:35,667
We have all the answers to connect the dots.

516
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,500
We just need to ask the correct questions.

517
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:55,125
Hey! I need to ask you some questions. Do you have the time to answer?

518
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:02,750
You are in my mind. Speak in Tamil.

519
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,417
Pardon me, Sir. You can question me.

520
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:10,042
What is the connection between you and Mona?

521
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,083
Nothing except that we belong to the same area.

522
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,458
There is nothing more.

523
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:24,000
Exactly... there is nothing else as far as I know.

524
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,583
So this is not the correct question.

525
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:32,375
When Mona was missing what were you doing there at night?

526
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:36,833
I was doing what you were doing.

527
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,542
Walking!

528
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,042
You are a school kid.

529
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:45,083
Who would have kidnapped you?

530
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:48,333
Who else have you seen me with?

531
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:53,542
I have....

532
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:55,833
I have seen you with that guy!

533
01:03:55,833 --> 01:04:01,792
You followed me. I thought you would catch me. But you missed.

534
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,958
He is the one who gave you the bag. Right?

535
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,042
What is the connection between you and Carlos?

536
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:12,208
Did you kidnap him?

537
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:16,458
He threatened me too. Do you remember that?

538
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,750
What dear, are you scared?

539
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:25,167
Uncle it is not a sin to kill these types of people.

540
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,000
Ramya, what are you doing here?

541
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,500
Wow. She is very good looking.

542
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,000
You go away from here.

543
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,625
Enough of staring. Answer now.

544
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,833
Why should I take the trouble to kidnap him?

545
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,208
He will become unconscious if I touch him lightly

546
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:46,833
If not Paul who could have kidnapped you?

547
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,833
A monster

548
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,000
How did he kidnap you?

549
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,625
See the blood on this. He hit me with this.

550
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:01,542
Mona, he had attacked you with force as well.

551
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:04,667
Attacker knows you well.

552
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,417
Carlos, did he know you too?

553
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:10,042
No need for him to know me.

554
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,833
If he knows about me that is enough.

555
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,958
Mona, you...

556
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,042
Why are you still talking to this old man?

557
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:24,042
Wake up Bharathi. We need to get down here.

558
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:26,125
Wake up!

559
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,583
Oh look! Is that Sunny Leone?

560
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:28,708
Where? where?

561
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:32,083
Wow, she looks old. Did I sleep for 40 years!

562
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:38,667
Sir. Slow down, I might get lost in the crowd.

563
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:42,250
Bharathi, there is a similarity between the two cases.

564
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,750
How do you say that?

565
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:49,917
Mona was kidnapped from her house whereas Carlos was kidnapped from the road.

566
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:53,958
Mona is a working professional. Carlos is a school kid.

567
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:58,458
Mona is 30 years old. Carlos is a kid.

568
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,250
How can you connect these two?

569
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,292
Bharathi when I visited Mona's house

570
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:07,250
and visited Carlos' crime scene,

571
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,250
I found out one thing in common.

572
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:16,125
When he was dragging Mona's body in the garage,

573
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:19,333
he should have done that with a lot of effort.

574
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,500
Not clear, right?
Give me that bottle.

575
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,917
Imagine that I kidnapped Mona, and this is Mona

576
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,333
I attacked her and she fell

577
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,542
How would I drag her body?

578
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:36,125
I will pull her with her hands or legs.
Like this right?

579
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,708
So, the blood stains will be in a straight line.

580
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,917
But our guy is a bit weak.

581
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:49,583
He has paused in between while dragging the dead body.

582
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:52,333
That is why you see a pool of blood

583
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,333
wherever he had stopped for a while.

584
01:06:54,333 --> 01:07:00,667
When I checked the blood stains both in Mona's house and Carlos' crime scene, I confirmed this.

585
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:04,542
So, the kidnapper is a person with a weak body frame.

586
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:09,000
So, Mona's boyfriend Jeff can be ruled out.

587
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,417
It is not that difficult for him to drag these bodies.

588
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,667
So, my conclusion is that...

589
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:21,125
both have been kidnapped by the same person!

590
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,583
Same person?

591
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:24,917
Wait for me.

592
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,000
My only doubt is why should he do all this?

593
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,500
We will have to find out.

594
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,708
He has kidnapped two people from different economic status.

595
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:37,833
And that too in broad day light! Why?

596
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:41,708
There is only a few days of gap in between the two kidnaps.

597
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:44,042
That too in the same neighborhood.

598
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:49,042
The kidnapper has also attacked them with force.

599
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:55,708
He would not have done that if it was for money.

600
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:59,042
It is risky. And there have been no ransom calls.

601
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:02,792
If he had attacked a small boy so brutally,

602
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,750
he must be an experienced person.

603
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:10,625
Bharathi, if you solve five sides in a Rubik’s cube

604
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:15,333
the 6th side will solve by itself.

605
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,500
This case is like that.

606
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,958
We have found out HOW he did it.

607
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,958
if we can find out WHY,

608
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:24,958
then we can figure out WHO did it!

609
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,833
In my experience if someone is kidnapping with such vengeance,

610
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:36,833
I am sure this will continue.

611
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,583
Ramya what happened? Who?

612
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:11,333
Where were you dad?
I tried calling you so many times.

613
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,875
Our phones got switched off.

614
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,500
Dad ........

615
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:13,667
Alice. Please eat this.

616
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,083
Thanks dad.

617
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,583
Yes, they are involved in all of this.

618
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,000
He has threatened Mona and Ajay already.

619
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,250
Just the other day at the basketball court, Rudhran attacked a member of the gang.

620
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,750
Paul came looking for Rudhran the same night.

621
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,792
There was a tussle between them.
Mona called the cops on him.

622
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:03,417
That is when trouble started between Paul and Mona.

623
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:07,958
Paul threatened Mona and left the area.

624
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,250
What are they saying Rudhran?

625
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,458
The police have no evidence.

626
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:35,375
They say he is being accused because he is African-American.

627
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:39,292
Like how we use 'caste' in India, here they use 'Race'.

628
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:40,583
What are you saying?

629
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,875
This is the guy!

630
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,750
He is connected to all the missing people.

631
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,458
He is involved in Ajay's kidnap,

632
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,833
Mona's kidnap too.

633
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,417
He is responsible for all of it.

634
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,292
What are you thinking about?

635
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:00,750
No Bharathi. I feel we are missing something.

636
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:04,792
Paul is well built. But we theorized our suspect has a lean frame.

637
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,125
So, he cannot be the culprit.

638
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,375
What do you mean?

639
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:12,208
He might have hired somebody for kidnapping.

640
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,958
They came to our house and threatened us.

641
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,542
What other evidence do you need?

642
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:21,792
Or are you looking for warrant and evidence like the American police?

643
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,458
Only American police need all these.

644
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,792
I don't need all those.

645
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,375
Are the police here?

646
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:40,458
Sir. Where are you going?

647
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,458
Is Ajay there?

648
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,667
Sorry sir. You already warned me.

649
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,292
Because of me....

650
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,667
Why is he doing this?

651
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,708
Is it Mona?

652
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,083
What are they saying?

653
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,958
They say Paul is not connected with this.

654
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,375
They will investigate the case further.

655
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:08,167
But Mona's body was found at his place!

656
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,042
What could be better evidence than this?

657
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:12,583
We have become the alibi.

658
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,625
The day Ajay was kidnapped,

659
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:17,292
we were following Paul closely.

660
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:24,375
They say someone else killed Mona elsewhere and dumped the body at Paul's hideout.

661
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,708
Someone else?

662
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:27,750
How do they know?

663
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:32,250
Tire tracks and clues from vehicle movements indicate that.

664
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,042
Sorry Rudhran! It was me who took you there.

665
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:37,708
No Bharathi.

666
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,875
If you had not done that...

667
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:44,042
we would not have known somebody is trying to mislead us.

668
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:45,458
Misleading us?

669
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:50,167
If not Paul, then who else?

670
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:53,000
Has he slipped from our hands?

671
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,958
No Bharathi.

672
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:57,917
We are in fact only getting closer to him.

673
01:25:57,917 --> 01:26:00,083
He was quiet all these days,

674
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:03,583
but now suddenly he has revealed Mona's body.

675
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:04,250
Why?

676
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:07,500
If it is not Paul....

677
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,375
who else could it be?

678
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,500
How is Ajay involved in all of this?

679
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:18,833
He knows Mona, Carlos and Ajay.

680
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:22,250
He knew when Mona will be at home,

681
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,250
and when Ajay goes to the office.

682
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:30,375
He knows everything and has problems with everybody.

683
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,500
Not only that,

684
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,000
he knew we were following Paul as well!!

685
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,250
What?

686
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,208
Yes! He knows where we are going...

687
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,500
Our activities...

688
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
He is watching very closely!

689
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,375
But how?

690
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:47,792
Only two options

691
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,417
One,

692
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:52,250
he is watching us directly!

693
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,042
Or he has joined forces with

694
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:58,667
someone in our neighborhood and is doing all of this!

695
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:00,000
Whom do you suspect?

696
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,625
Why did you come out?

697
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,125
What happened inside?

698
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:17,125
I heard someone speaking.

699
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:21,542
Tell me Sir. What did you see inside the room?

700
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:25,250
Okay come, let's call the cops.

701
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,333
Be quiet Bharathi!!

702
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,500
What happened?

703
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:31,750
Majid has no connection in this.

704
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,792
Then the people inside the room?

705
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,833
I feel sorry for Syria. When will all this end?

706
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:48,792
They are Syrian refugees.

707
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,333
They are like Srilankan Tamils in our country,

708
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:57,000
with the same pain.

709
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,500
Like I am searching for my son,

710
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,208
they have lost their motherland

711
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:04,417
and searching for a home.

712
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:06,125
It is not Majid!

713
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:10,083
Do you think this is why Majid and Mona had problems?

714
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:11,000
Yes.

715
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,875
He has given illegal asylum to

716
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,875
these people which Mona did not like.

717
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:25,083
Sir, didn't you see Carlos' photo in their house?

718
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:27,500
So the reason for Carlos' disappearance....

719
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,083
Carlos and Najiba are in love.

720
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:32,667
He is seen around here because of Najiba.

721
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:37,000
On that night when Mona went missing...

722
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,375
He ran out of Majid's house

723
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,083
because he came to see Najiba.

724
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:46,750
What is this?

725
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,667
It is not Paul...

726
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:50,458
Not Majid either. Then who?

727
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,458
I don't know... I don't know who!

728
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:08,750
The Garbage truck comes on Wednesdays without fail.

729
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:17,542
Bharathi, when we went to Majid's house

730
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:19,292
wasn't the garbage bin full?

731
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:22,958
Yes sir.

732
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:31,292
Alice. We need to follow the garbage truck.

733
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:32,292
What happened, uncle?

734
01:31:32,292 --> 01:31:34,167
Ajay went missing on a Wednesday,

735
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,333
Garbage collection day.

736
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:38,708
The person who came today should have come on that day too.

737
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:42,417
He must have seen something. We need to find out. Let's go.

738
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,083
Where are you going now?

739
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,250
Dad... wait here.

740
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,500
Uncle see this daily report.

741
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,750
Give me that.

742
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,167
Look at the name list.

743
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,958
Look - the day Ajay went missing...

744
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,458
"Hunt" was the person who came that day!

745
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:49,167
Did you see someone?

746
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,000
He has seen something.

747
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:18,500
He says that he saw a black truck.

748
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:53,583
Come sir... let's go!

749
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:07,375
There are so many black trucks in this city.

750
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:10,917
How will you find out the truth with this one clue?

751
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:12,250
I don't know.

752
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,833
We have tried our best.

753
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:19,167
What else can we do?

754
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:35,333
We have come very close to him.

755
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:37,833
He also would know that by now.

756
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:43,833
Police also has tightened their grip around him.

757
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,917
If we don't do anything now

758
01:35:45,917 --> 01:35:49,917
Ajay's life will be in danger.

759
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:04,292
Uncle, Alice told me she needs to pick her car up. I will drop her there.

760
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,792
Please be patient Rudhran. You will find Ajay.

761
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,667
Take rest.

762
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:58,667
Sorry Ajay. I made a mistake.

763
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:02,542
I behaved like an ordinary father.

764
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:06,125
For a moment, I forgot I am a cop.

765
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:10,750
Like doctors who do not operate on their own kids?

766
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,750
Let me start over.

767
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,792
Who saw you last on the day you went missing?

768
01:38:15,792 --> 01:38:16,667
It was me.

769
01:38:16,667 --> 01:38:17,750
When did you last see him?

770
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:20,375
8 a.m. when I was about to leave for school.

771
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:23,625
Correct. This exact time is shown in the security hub.

772
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:27,792
After that, the door was opened again at 10:04 AM.

773
01:38:29,667 --> 01:38:32,292
Ajay should have opened the door. Right?

774
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:36,333
Next the door was opened at 10:22 AM.

775
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:41,708
So there is a gap of 18 minutes in between.

776
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:45,417
This is the time you were abducted...

777
01:38:45,417 --> 01:38:47,958
Ah! Hunt told us that he saw a black truck.

778
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:51,208
So, the black truck was used to kidnap you.

779
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,792
Did no one come to meet you

780
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:56,167
between 8 AM and 10:04 AM?

781
01:38:56,167 --> 01:38:59,708
Ramya! What time do you usually pick Ajay up?

782
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,833
10:30 AM

783
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,083
On that day?

784
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,333
I came at 10:30 AM on that day too.

785
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:05,500
Did you see Ajay?

786
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,167
No.

787
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:06,792
Why?

788
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:08,833
He didn't answer my call.

789
01:39:08,833 --> 01:39:10,833
I knocked the door. He did not open.

790
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:14,417
I assumed he went alone just like the previous day.

791
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:15,792
Previous day.

792
01:39:17,958 --> 01:39:20,542
That was the day I saw you last.

793
01:39:21,458 --> 01:39:25,000
You didn't go to office with Ramya that day?

794
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:27,875
Why did you go alone?

795
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:31,417
Don't you remember?

796
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:35,083
We fought on the previous day, in that anger...

797
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:38,167
No matter how much we fight,

798
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:40,167
you always come and talk to me after.

799
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:41,917
But you did not do that.

800
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:44,917
So, there should have been something else that

801
01:39:44,917 --> 01:39:48,625
made you leave without talking to me the next morning.

802
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,542
Ajay what is that on your face?

803
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:57,083
I have seen this somewhere else.

804
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:57,875
Where?

805
01:39:57,917 --> 01:39:58,625
Here.

806
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:05,542
These rashes are caused by some flower.

807
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:08,542
Yes. It is Dandelions.

808
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:10,542
Dandelions.

809
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:14,708
Both these rashes look similar to me.

810
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:17,667
I think you showed me where these flowers grow.

811
01:40:17,667 --> 01:40:22,125
Wherever you see the dots, the flowers grow there.

812
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:34,958
Your face has the same rashes as seen in Mona's corpse.

813
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:36,792
The day after the rashes appeared,

814
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,792
they abducted you.

815
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:41,875
So, you had gone somewhere and seen something.

816
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:44,417
Who did you see? Mona's killer?

817
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:47,292
If you had seen him, why didn't you tell anybody?

818
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:48,917
Why didn't you go to the police?

819
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:51,792
You didn't even tell me, why!?

820
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,000
Why did you hide this?

821
01:40:57,292 --> 01:40:58,375
I got it!

822
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,208
What happened sir?

823
01:41:34,333 --> 01:41:36,250
What are you doing?

824
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,750
I know who abducted Ajay.

825
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:38,917
What are you saying?

826
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:41,625
There is no time to explain. Where is Ramya?

827
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,958
She has gone to drop Alice.

828
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,500
Call her immediately.

829
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,583
It is ringing but she is not picking up.

830
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,500
Try for Alice.

831
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,000
Please dial now!

832
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,750
What happened?

833
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,625
Alice is also not picking up.

834
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:05,250
Rudhran, be careful!

835
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:16,792
Rudhran. Where are we going?

836
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:17,958
Odessa.

837
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:20,875
Why to Odessa?

838
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,750
Because Ajay is in Odessa!

839
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:26,375
What? Who told you that?

840
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,375
The day before Ajay was kidnapped,

841
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:30,125
he did not go to work.

842
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:32,958
He went to Odessa instead.

843
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:37,417
He had the dandelion flower rashes on his cheeks.

844
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:41,542
I saw the same rashes on Mona's body too.

845
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:47,958
Mona's autopsy reports had a list of places where these flowers grow.

846
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:52,792
When there is a list of places, how do you know it is Odessa?

847
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:56,208
If you ask the right question you will get the right answer.

848
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:10,208
Among those locations, Odessa is the only place that can be a day trip from home

849
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:13,375
So Ajay had to have gone to Odessa.

850
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:44,458
Since her childhood, Alice had seen only hell in her life.

851
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:47,917
Her mother was her only solace.

852
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:50,375
After her mom's death, the girl who was used to

853
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:53,375
being tortured started to give back what she received.

854
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:55,167
She erupted like a volcano!

855
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,708
She hunted down all the animals in her life.

856
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:15,625
She lived alone.

857
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:17,875
She chose loneliness.

858
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:24,000
She wanted to distance herself from her past and her past identity.

859
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,583
At one point of time she stopped thinking

860
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:30,583
about how to live and started to think about why to live.

861
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:33,208
Nicole became Alice.

862
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:39,583
We tend to think no one would harm children.

863
01:47:39,583 --> 01:47:43,875
That is why they become easy targets of abuse.

864
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:47,208
But Alice was different.

865
01:47:47,208 --> 01:47:53,208
She focused only on the animals under the human cover.

866
01:47:57,167 --> 01:48:08,417
Wielding the very weapon she used to defend herself, she started saving others' lives.

867
01:48:08,417 --> 01:48:12,458
She wanted to devote her entire lifetime for saving the innocent.

868
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:16,208
But destiny had something else in store for her.

869
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:21,750
Alice who had been seeing only animals in her life

870
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,625
saw a human being for the first time.

871
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:27,625
That was my son Ajay.

872
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:31,292
Ajay introduced her to a different world.

873
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:34,375
Though she was a bit reluctant at first,

874
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,125
she grew a liking for him too.

875
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:38,125
On one side her brutal past

876
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:40,792
and on the other side the pleasant present,

877
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:44,292
she started leading a double life.

878
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:51,125
That is when I came into her life.

879
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,167
Hello dad...

880
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:06,875
Mona was misbehaving with the kids coming to her studio.

881
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:16,917
Alice, being a student counselor, learned about this from one such kid abused by Mona.

882
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:27,792
Alice decided to hunt Mona.

883
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:34,750
Being a neighbor, Alice knew when Mona would be home.

884
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:37,208
When she got an opportunity,

885
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:40,208
she made Ajay and I to go on a day trip.

886
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:45,708
She made us believe she is not coming due to my discomfort around her

887
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:49,208
Both her plan and her family were important to her.

888
01:49:55,375 --> 01:50:00,958
Carlos sells drugs to his school friends and abuses them.

889
01:50:03,375 --> 01:50:06,583
She kidnapped him when he was alone.

890
01:50:06,583 --> 01:50:09,333
As the number of missing people started to increase...

891
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:12,292
There is a special report on missing people in

892
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:17,083
Washington State on the news.

893
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:20,042
Alice's childhood photograph was shown in that report and

894
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:24,292
they mentioned she had gone missing from Odessa 15 years ago.

895
01:50:24,292 --> 01:50:27,917
And the kid was named Nicole!

896
01:50:27,917 --> 01:50:30,792
Ajay was shocked to see that!

897
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:34,167
That was when he walked out of our conversation.

898
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:37,292
He started having questions about

899
01:50:37,292 --> 01:50:39,708
the person with whom he has been living with.

900
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:42,792
He wanted to know for sure.

901
01:50:46,292 --> 01:50:49,250
He decided to go to Nicole's place.

902
01:50:57,083 --> 01:51:00,250
He saw the other side of Alice there.

903
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,833
He also got the skin allergy there.

904
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:14,125
In his state of shock, he did not even talk to me.

905
01:51:16,583 --> 01:51:19,083
Nicole?

906
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:40,583
Alice tried to explain her side of things.

907
01:51:47,292 --> 01:51:48,792
But Ajay...

908
01:51:50,167 --> 01:51:52,167
So... she attacked him.

909
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:55,458
The next day,

910
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,875
I spoke to Alice for the first time.

911
01:52:04,833 --> 01:52:07,208
I am going to Bharathi's house.

912
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:11,500
The day Alice and I became friends...

913
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:15,125
... was the day trouble started between Alice and Ajay.

914
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:19,792
When Bharathi and I went to see Carlos's crime scene,

915
01:52:19,792 --> 01:52:23,250
Alice went to school to create her alibi.

916
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:26,208
She came home with the black truck.

917
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:29,375
The time was 10:04 AM.

918
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:32,500
That is when Hunt saw the black truck.

919
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:37,542
She took Ajay out of the house at 10:22 AM.

920
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:42,875
She set a crime scene at home before we came back.

921
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:47,958
She accused Paul during the police interrogation.

922
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:51,583
Only the American police need evidence and warrant.

923
01:52:51,583 --> 01:52:52,958
I don't require them.

924
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:55,708
Once she realized we were planning to follow Paul

925
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:59,583
she planted Mona's dead body at his hideout.

926
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:05,708
Alice believed everything would end there.

927
01:53:10,292 --> 01:53:13,542
She didn't expect me to continue the investigation.

928
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,750
Alice, we need to follow the garbage truck.

929
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:27,375
Only when we went to see Hunt did she realize

930
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:30,375
the police too are closing in on her.

931
01:53:35,958 --> 01:53:39,333
Uncle, Alice told me she needs to pick her car up. I will drop her there.

932
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:43,583
Alice decided to shift Ajay from Odessa.

933
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:47,125
That was when Hunt had called my phone

934
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:50,125
that I had left behind in Ramya's car.

935
01:53:50,125 --> 01:53:52,917
He had mentioned he saw

936
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:56,917
the same black truck in Odessa too.

937
01:53:56,917 --> 01:53:59,875
Alice! Hunt has seen the same truck in Odessa.

938
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:01,875
We need to tell Uncle about this.

939
01:54:01,875 --> 01:54:03,667
Alice did not want me to know this...

940
01:54:03,667 --> 01:54:05,208
So, she kidnapped Ramya too.

941
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:08,333
When I realized Ajay had seen something

942
01:54:08,333 --> 01:54:12,708
or someone in Odessa. Yet he had hidden that from me.

943
01:54:12,708 --> 01:54:16,375
That means it has to be someone close -
should be either Ramya or Alice.

944
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:19,375
Ramya's black truck was not as old as Hunt described.

945
01:54:19,375 --> 01:54:21,292
And her husband succumbed to an accident in that

946
01:54:21,292 --> 01:54:23,083
same truck which is why it was kept under wraps

947
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:25,958
So, I ruled out Ramya.

948
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:30,833
I went to Odessa in search of that black truck.

949
01:54:46,208 --> 01:54:50,458
The hunt that started with her father 12 years ago

950
01:54:50,458 --> 01:54:53,292
came to an end with me, her father-in-law.

951
01:55:27,125 --> 01:55:28,250
I am ok!

952
01:55:35,042 --> 01:55:35,833
I am alright.

953
01:56:02,833 --> 01:56:04,125
Ramya

954
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:07,125
Ramya where is my phone?

955
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:27,917
This is the Dog taunt app!

956
01:56:27,917 --> 01:56:29,375
When the app is switched on,

957
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:31,375
high frequency sound is emitted.

958
01:57:10,708 --> 01:57:13,292
Trust me dear. Let me help you.

959
01:58:15,958 --> 01:58:19,958
A new bud (child) arrives with a million dreams.
A million potentials in this world.

960
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:24,292
Venom filled pedophile monsters trying to crush them every nook and corner.

961
01:58:24,292 --> 01:58:26,667
What kind of a sick world is this?

962
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:30,167
How do we annihilate those monsters and save the innocent children?

963
01:58:30,167 --> 01:58:33,625
Let us build a fort.
Let us keep watch.

964
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:38,167
And defeat the monsters
while embracing the innocent!

965
01:58:38,167 --> 01:58:41,208
Let the buds bloom into full blown flowers...

966
01:58:41,208 --> 01:58:44,208
Freely...Wonderfully...as they should be!

967
01:58:44,208 --> 01:58:46,208
