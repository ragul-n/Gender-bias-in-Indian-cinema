1
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:39,413
Cigarette Smoking
Is Injurious To Health.

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,512
It causes cancer.

3
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:46,315
Cigarette Smoking
Is Injurious To Health

4
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,020
It causes cancer.

5
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:18,775
"Free Fall"

6
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,944
Who is it?

7
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,517
Amal, wait.

8
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,301
- Keep this.
- Thank You.

9
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,839
Godspeed.

10
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:45,498
Have a good flight.

11
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,073
- Thank You.
- You are welcome.

12
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:55,603
Let's go.

13
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:05,650
Hello Sir.

14
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,266
Thank you.

15
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,360
Good morning Sir.

16
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:18,426
Please Sir.

17
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,463
That's fine.

18
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,398
When are you coming?

19
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,436
Hold on...

20
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:25,669
Amal?

21
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,941
What are you doing here?

22
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,709
- Robin?
- Yeah.

23
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,444
Can you wait for sometime?
I'm on duty.

24
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:35,988
Sure. Come quickly.

25
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,015
Six thousand! That's all?

26
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,787
I manage somehow.
But with this much salary...

27
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,295
...nothing is left for home.

28
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,800
You are too used to struggling!

29
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:56,773
Let it go Robin.

30
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,308
You were saying something
about a job?

31
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,448
You don't have a passport?
Right?

32
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,814
Yes I do.

33
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,943
You need three things for this job.

34
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,882
Attitude.

35
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,749
Guts.

36
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,420
And confidence.

37
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,629
That's it! Nothing else!

38
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,921
How long are you working here?

39
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,565
Eleven months.

40
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:22,761
Eleven months...

41
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,698
Eleven months...

42
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:28,297
Look at her... with loads of bags?

43
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,310
You've ever gone home with
so many bags?

44
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:40,511
Two months after I got this job
I bought two...

45
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,581
...jute bags for mother and
my sister in law.

46
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:43,680
That's all.

47
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,625
What if you are in a much
larger mall than this one...

48
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,591
...your pockets loaded
with foreign currency?

49
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:56,864
And you can pick up whatever
you want from any shop?

50
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,962
You're asking me to dream?

51
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,630
Not at all.

52
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,266
I am placing you in my position.

53
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,707
I made my dream come true.

54
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,248
What's the job?

55
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,287
Ah! I'll explain everything.

56
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,754
I'll take you to my boss.

57
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:19,488
I used to like you.

58
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:23,393
You were such a good boy.
A bit too good!

59
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:30,664
I think it's time to turn you
into a bad lad!

60
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,401
When do you have off?
When?

61
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,703
- Day after tomorrow.
- Four thirty.

62
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:38,801
Mohammad Ali Park.

63
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,502
- You know the place?
- I'll find it.

64
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,468
You're the first Bengali who's on time.

65
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,349
Hey boy! Two strong spicy colas.

66
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,384
Get down.

67
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:22,314
Two glasses. Two...
Can't you hear me?

68
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,823
You'll go abroad at least
ten times a months.

69
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,617
Seven thousand rupees per trip.

70
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:28,786
How much is that?

71
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,520
Seventy thousand!

72
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,933
Ten times more than what
you earn at the mall!

73
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,529
You don't believe it?

74
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,702
Scared?

75
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:42,901
Here.

76
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,443
Forty rupees. It's super strong!

77
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,806
Amal, what's the meaning
of your name?

78
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,353
Someone pure.

79
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:04,987
What a bullshit name!

80
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,557
Get on.

81
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:26,911
Come.

82
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,688
So you are Amal?

83
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,320
Amal Kumar Biswas, Madam.

84
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:38,564
Sit.

85
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,659
Thank you.

86
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,698
Biswas... means trust...

87
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,531
It's a nice name.

88
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,307
I'll wait outside.

89
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,608
Who's there at home?

90
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,373
My home...

91
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,813
My mother, elder brother and
my sister in law.

92
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,655
That's a big family.

93
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,956
My father expired four years back.

94
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,886
You're not married?

95
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:13,931
No girlfriends?

96
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:19,902
Do you remember the expiry
date on your passport?

97
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,872
- No Madam.
- Have you ever been abroad?

98
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,776
Air travel?

99
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,374
That's all right.

100
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,745
Are you carrying a photograph?

101
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,354
Photograph?

102
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,291
May I click one?

103
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,930
Okay. Write down your address
and telephone number.

104
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,699
You'll get a call in a couple of days.

105
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,510
Where were you all day?

106
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,944
I had work.

107
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,881
- But it's your day off!
- Some other work, sister.

108
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,798
Sohag called thrice on the landline.

109
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,972
Why didn't you pick up your mobile?

110
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,839
Call her once. Is her health okay?

111
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,471
My phone was on silent.

112
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,508
She worries about you...

113
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,651
Mother and your brother had a
huge fight today!

114
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,555
About the Allahabad trip.

115
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,464
Your brother can't spare
any travel money this month...

116
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,760
She is furious.

117
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,433
- Can you spare some money?
- Me?

118
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,302
Let me see.

119
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:07,979
Now get me tea. Please.

120
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,872
She slept already?

121
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,525
You are all inhuman!

122
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,987
I broke my back raising you two.

123
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,891
Now you can't spare a little
money for me!

124
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,804
My sister is in Allahabad.

125
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,670
Haven't met her since three years!
Aren't you ashamed?

126
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,798
Mother...

127
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,311
I went for a job interview.

128
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,609
If I get the job...

129
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,642
...we won't have to worry anymore.

130
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:52,775
What job?

131
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,786
- You won't understand.
- Why?

132
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:58,346
It's an international business...
A big deal.

133
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,750
As if destiny has
ever been in our favour!

134
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:07,025
I pray everyday! Is it any use?

135
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,704
- Hello.
- Amal Kumar Biswas?

136
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,466
- Speaking.
- Give me your pincode.

137
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:24,310
Who is this?

138
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,544
You are Robin's friend Amal?

139
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,543
Give me your pin code.

140
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,881
- 700004.
- Good.

141
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:37,385
Meet Madam at 1 pm today.

142
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,656
Carry your passport.

143
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:40,994
Okay.

144
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:51,972
Hello.

145
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,739
This is Amal.

146
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,776
I need your help.

147
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,312
My passport is in your cupboard...

148
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,884
Please get it for me...
at Metro cinema hall...

149
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,449
But I'm going for a bath.

150
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,388
Do that later!

151
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,853
Hurry up and leave!

152
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,861
Okay...
But you call me when you reach.

153
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,727
I don't have balance on my cell.

154
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,427
- Sir!
- What's the problem?

155
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:17,603
My sister in law called.

156
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:21,398
My mother's fainted. She's still
unconscious...

157
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,401
- My brother is also not home.
- Okay. Okay.

158
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,310
You leave. I'll handle it here.
No problem. Go rush.

159
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,677
Thank you Sir.

160
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,670
I'll let you know later.
I have to rush now.

161
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:00,639
- Listen! Be careful.
- Okay.

162
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,410
I'll tell you why I've called you here.

163
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,779
It's really quite simple.
We will send you abroad.

164
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:13,622
You'll go to Dhaka, Bangkok,
Singapore, Shanghai.

165
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,522
We bear all expenses.

166
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,257
But when you return...

167
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,362
...you'll carry a few packages for us.

168
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,860
A car will be there at the airport.

169
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:28,737
The driver will take the packages
from you.

170
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,470
And that's the end of the story.
Simple.

171
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh! Next day take your
payment from the office.

172
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,985
I know something is bothering you.

173
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,481
What the packets will contain?

174
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,492
Yes... without knowing...

175
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,451
You don't have to worry about all that.

176
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,590
We handle the customs at the airport.

177
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,295
Okay?

178
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,428
You've got your passport?

179
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,629
Yes.

180
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:07,774
But Madam...
Will I get into any trouble?

181
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:13,615
You didn't get what I said?

182
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:20,825
Since you've never been abroad...

183
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:23,623
I'll send you nearby - Dhaka.

184
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,530
Visa will be done.
Come home at 3pm tomorrow.

185
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:35,396
You'll meet Mr. Badal Saha...
A very talented man.

186
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:38,375
He'll brief you about the work.

187
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:46,816
<i>"Do you know</i>
<i>Which way to go?"</i>

188
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,388

189
00:16:54,627 --> 00:17:00,497

190
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:06,736
<i>"Life races</i> by...

191
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,341
Who is it?

192
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,540
Aunty, it's me. Amal.

193
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,983
We are too used to each other!

194
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,756
Not a good habit!

195
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,795
- Sorry...
- It's okay!

196
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,955
This sudden rain...

197
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,767
It's taking me back to
our college days...

198
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,004
Damn!

199
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,868
Stupid!

200
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,341
Sorry. Sorry.

201
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:47,644
Oh damn!

202
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:48,945
I'm sorry too.

203
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,976
Wanted to impress me with your
good manners?

204
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:57,916
Probably...

205
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,958
I went for an interview today.

206
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,760
Oh! For which job?

207
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,855
It's not final yet.
So they haven't briefed me.

208
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,564
I'll even have to travel abroad!

209
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:12,564
Oh my God! Abroad! Where?

210
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,997
I don't know.

211
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:19,772
Oh! That's the best.
A strange land! A new city!

212
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:25,309
And you, a stranger amidst
countless new faces!

213
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,653
- You're pulling my leg!
- Not at all.

214
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:34,724
Have you seen your biceps?
I'm scared of you!

215
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:38,557
Anyway... Shovan is returning
to Kolkata?

216
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,799
Yes. But it's not good news.

217
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,398
Mother doesn't know yet...

218
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:50,904
...but brother's Hyderabad office
is shutting down.

219
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,971
Some employees are still
working on a low pay...

220
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,277
The rest have been fired.

221
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,880
Anyway... how was your interview?

222
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,590
I'm not sure. They were not clear...

223
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,523
You're not even clear about what
the job is!

224
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:11,889
It's good...

225
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,556
Let some things remain a mystery.

226
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,867
But he didn't say anything to me!

227
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,845
He came back so late...
Where was the time?

228
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,778
I don't believe it...

229
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:33,645
Moving to this country has been a curse!

230
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,787
Mother! Don't curse your luck
in the morning.

231
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,556
You're up?

232
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,020
Is it true?

233
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,821
First give me tea mother.

234
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,296
You are going to Dhaka?

235
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,003
Answer me!
Are you going to Dhaka?

236
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,706
I don't know. Give me tea.
Please.

237
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:08,585
Your father always wanted
to return to Dhaka...

238
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,847
...and touch the soil of his
homeland again...

239
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,684
Will I ever get to see that day?

240
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,920
Mother. Please!

241
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,295
I'll ask Manju to give you tea.

242
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,028
Manju!

243
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:31,308

Amal Kumar Biswas. Right?

251
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,072
Listen...

252
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:51,388
Don't be surprised.
My grandfather used to play...

253
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,857
...in Bangladesh. He taught me.

254
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,689
I came here at fourteen
when the Pakistani army drove...

255
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:03,360
...me away from Bangladesh.
I brought this with me.

256
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,931
That's when I started
this wedding band...

257
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,875
But no one calls us now.

258
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:16,046
Those were the days...
Now it's all hogwash!

259
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,678
Anyway. Let's come to the point.

260
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:25,020
You've never travelled abroad...
Correct?

261
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:32,358
We get many boys who've
never been on a flight.

262
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:34,422
Naturally, they've never been
to the airport.

263
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:38,334
We have a demo for them.
I'll show you.

264
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:39,561
Here.

265
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,513
But, we'll do this later.

266
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,309
First let's finish our discussion.

267
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,847
Okay Sir.

268
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,415
Call me Brother Badal.

269
00:22:54,453 --> 00:23:00,085
Listen! You need to know our system
very carefully.

270
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:03,618
But Brother! Is this job dangerous?

271
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:04,863
No.

272
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:06,989
The car will pick you up at
3pm tomorrow.

273
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,328
The driver knows your place.

274
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:14,532
System!

275
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,417
- Hello, Sohag?
- Where are you?

276
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:34,722
Just came out of office.

277
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:36,891
I mean, my new office.

278
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:40,955
I got the job.

279
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,726
There's some more good news.

280
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,864
Foreign travel?

281
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:50,603
Yes... I have to go to
Bangladesh tomorrow.

282
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:57,011
Be careful Amal...
There is trouble in Dhaka...

283
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:58,711
And I...

284
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:01,850
I'll hang up now Amal.

285
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,944
Sohag!

286
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:06,955
I'm okay...

287
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,959
Call me once you're back.

288
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,494
Abroad! On the first day of his job!

289
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,731
And a car pick up from home!

290
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,899
Seems fishy!

291
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,442
Why do you have to bother so much?

292
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:30,708
What if he gets into trouble?

293
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,011
Stop fussing! What trouble?

294
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:39,848
What did you get?
With your honest ways?

295
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,523
Couldn't even pay for mother's
Allahabad trip.

296
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,525
She's constantly complaining!

297
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,661
And look at this house!

298
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,635
Dirty water's seeping in from all sides!

299
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,964
What if anyone falls sick!
Really sick!

300
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:59,805
Then you can go to hell with
with your pride...

301
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:04,609
...honesty and your glorious past!

302
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:07,781
Don't be so righteous! Be practical.

303
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,878
I'm not being righteous!

304
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:12,285
If there's some trouble?

305
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:13,756
What trouble!

306
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,756
Idiotic! Bloody scared all the time!

307
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,930
He'll stay home all his life because...

308
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,488
...you smell trouble?

309
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,428
Or remain a security guard?

310
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,970
Not that! But going abroad!

311
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,873
What abroad?
He's just going to Dhaka!

312
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:32,410
What's the big deal!

313
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:35,645
And your mother! Praying since morning!

314
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:38,339
Her younger son is going abroad!

315
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,447
You guys are so melodramatic!

316
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:49,956
I've asked him to visit our ancestral
home in Bangladesh.

317
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:53,695
Give him your blessings.

318
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:58,562
Come.

319
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,897
Take this. Always keep it with you.

320
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:23,888

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,914
Listen!

362
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:30,385
Tell your boss Bachhu to stay
away from my locality.

363
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,794
I'll chop his legs and parcel
them home!

364
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,855
Yes...

365
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,696
Unable to control himself when
he sees a woman!

366
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,731
Hey!

367
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,934
Why are you staring! Idiot!

368
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,336
Mind your own business!

369
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:04,854
Hello Brother Habib.

370
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,363
Sorry, I'm late.

371
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:12,392
Our boys got caught at the airport.

372
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:15,738
Had to bail them out.

373
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,341
I see!

374
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:18,973
Not to worry.

375
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:23,680
They create a fuss if the weekly
pay is late.

376
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:30,477
In both our countries...

377
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:37,885
...without corruption,
we'll all stay hungry.

378
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:43,857
You were supposed to return today.

379
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:46,699
- Yes.
- Not today.

380
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:48,730
You'll go tomorrow.

381
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,570
There might be problems today.

382
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:53,642
Today you're free.

383
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:57,513
Go somewhere if you want.

384
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:02,979
Want to go visit your ancestral home?

385
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:18,495
Why should I not praise
your greatness?

386
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,331
I cannot but fear you...

387
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:29,745
The keeper of life and death,

388
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:44,486
and my trembling desires...

389
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:54,066
I pray at your heavenly gates.

390
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:02,011
<i>"My Lord..."</i>

391
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,943
<i>"My Saviour..."</i>

392
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:31,673
<i>"My Lord, Where did I arrive?"</i>

393
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:37,882
<i>"Bathed in tears,</i>
<i>your soil makes me alive."</i>

394
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:43,387
<i>"How do I part from this</i>
<i>heartfelt terrain?"</i>

395
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,818
<i>"Yet I know, it must</i>
<i>be so,</i> and..."

396
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,485
<i>"I shatter into million</i>
<i>pieces again."</i>

397
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:55,664
<i>"Under my feet, this</i>
<i>earth is breathing..."</i>

398
00:35:55,834 --> 00:36:00,965
<i>"Is he my kin, pulling</i>
<i>at my heartstring?"</i>

399
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:05,737
<i>"At the river bend,</i>
<i>every speck of sand..."</i>

400
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:13,274
<i>"...searches for a homeland."</i>

401
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:18,588
<i>"...searches for a homeland."</i>

402
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:35,671
<i>"My Lord, Where did I arrive?"</i>

403
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,842
<i>"Bathed in tears,</i>
<i>your soil makes me alive."</i>

404
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,943
<i>"Under my feet, this</i>
<i>earth is breathing..."</i>

405
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:53,689
<i>"Is he my kin, pulling</i>
<i>at my heartstring?"</i>

406
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:59,294
<i>"At the river bend,</i>
<i>every speck of sand..."</i>

407
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:05,565
<i>"...searches for a homeland."</i>

408
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:10,830
<i>"...searches for a homeland."</i>

409
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:28,417
Your father always wanted to touch...

410
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,356
...the soil of his homeland again.

411
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,730
We had trouble with the police today.

412
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:16,670
So I decided not to meet you in office.

413
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:19,641
Ayan will give you a packet.

414
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:23,412
There are two blue dots on it.

415
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:25,840
Blue...

416
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:29,385
It's our Kolkata code.

417
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,922
So that there's no trouble
at the airport.

418
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:35,549
Okay? See you.

419
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:15,824
Thank you.

420
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:18,629
Excuse me.

421
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:21,263
You have anything to declare?

422
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,335
Please wait.

423
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:27,976
- Where are you going?
- What?

424
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,540
- Where are you going?
- Kolkata.

425
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,638
Show me your passport.

426
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,450
What's in your bag?

427
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:42,256
What's in it?

428
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:43,422
Clothes.

429
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:44,654
Okay... Go.

430
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,955
Your passport? Boarding pass?

431
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,367
Passport!

432
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,425
- No?
- One minute.

433
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,837
Okay. Next please.

434
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:11,279
First time?

435
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:12,014
Yes.

436
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,580
There's a saying...

437
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,380
Be responsible for your belongings!

438
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:17,548
Here.

439
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:19,690
It's okay.

440
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,852
Hold on please.

441
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:50,717
What are these?

442
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:52,779
- Clothes Sir.
- Clothes?

443
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:53,881
From Dhaka.

444
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:55,583
Come this way.

445
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,924
Please let us go Sir, it's just clothes.

446
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,088
- Show me your passport.
- Here Sir.

447
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:01,889
Put these in the X - Ray machine.

448
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:09,395
What's the matter?

449
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:11,465
You wish to declare anything?

450
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,676
No... I...

451
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,568
Show me your passport.

452
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:21,477
Look at me.

453
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:23,913
Okay...

454
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:26,653
Go through the green channel.

455
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,455
Go.

456
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,309
So... Amal! Someone pure!

457
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:52,374
Idiot! Hop on!

458
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,749
Celebration time!
You've become a man today!

459
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:07,028
I don't drink...

460
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:08,492
I feel uncomfortable here...

461
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:12,295
So! Start now! You've a lot to learn!

462
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,736
There's no end to learning. Come on!

463
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,480
Hey! Cheers!

464
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:34,555
Come on! Drink up.

465
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:42,062
You'll get used to it.

466
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:48,396
You middle class Bengalis have
have spoilt this city!

467
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,609
Tagore songs and sweets!

468
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:54,836
Ban them for at least five years!

469
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:56,311
Go to Mumbai!

470
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,508
Everyone is racing there!
To get somewhere.

471
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,412
Understand one thing very carefully!

472
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:05,620
If sky is the limit
then you have to run!

473
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:08,253
To do that you need the right runway!

474
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,421
Look at me.

475
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:16,326
For me life is a runway.

476
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,634
Keep running so that you can fly!

477
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:24,001
Cheers!

478
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:31,812
Come on! Drink up.

479
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,374
My Sweetheart!

480
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,520
Mr. Robin Pandey!

481
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:43,789
You think you can hide from me?

482
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:47,358
The world is too small for that!

483
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:48,858
Who is this cute guy?

484
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:53,065
Amal... Meaning... someone pure!

485
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,936
That I can see very well.
Adrija.

486
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,508
The naughty ones call me Addy!

487
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:11,477
So Robin! What's up?

488
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:12,487
Going on...

489
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,623
What's happening these days?

490
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:15,984
Travelling - China, Bangkok,
Hongkong...

491
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:18,318
Excuse me...

492
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:21,692
Where are you?

493
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,659
This doesn't feel right.

494
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,705
He's an innocent boy.

495
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:31,871
You suspect something?

496
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:36,301
I hope he doesn't get trapped.

497
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:38,381
He's so naive and honest.

498
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:42,309
But what's the point in honesty
nowadays?

499
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:44,715
See my condition!

500
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:55,530
Flight was late. Just landed.

501
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,459
Will speak tomorrow.

502
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:16,283
Have another...

503
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:17,342
No... No!

504
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,685
I'll leave now.

505
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,856
We are all leaving sweety!

506
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:24,594
Come I'll drop...

507
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,687
By the way, where do you live?

508
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:27,920
Kumartuli.

509
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:30,893
Okay. I'll drop you.

510
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,932
No. No. I'll go alone.

511
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:35,705
Robin!

512
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,496
Listen young man!

513
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:42,000
Never refuse a beautiful woman.

514
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:55,318
Are you also into the
Import - Export business?

515
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:56,422
No.

516
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:01,321
I'm into tourism.

517
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:09,705
Listen... Don't address me so formally.

518
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:13,807
Loosen up a little bit.

519
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,510
But I don't even know you!

520
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,381
So know me fast!

521
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,780
Fast track is the only track.

522
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:26,512
Learn from Robin.

523
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:27,955
But I'm not Robin, Madam.

524
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:36,858
I hate this word... Madam!

525
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:42,503
Call me Addy...

526
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,332
Like all other naughty men.

527
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:50,372
You need to be a little naughty in life!

528
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:11,735
What's this?

529
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,804
You said you wanted to visit
your sister...

530
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:21,945
25...

531
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:23,980
26...

532
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:25,649
27...

533
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:27,513
28...

534
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:28,716
Damn it!

535
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:07,221
What's the matter sister...

536
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:13,490
The fuss your mother created
after you came back!

537
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:16,866
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

538
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:21,262
Yes... Even brother was looking glum.

539
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:23,801
Problems? Again!

540
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:25,772
Yes...

541
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,835
He's apparently really worried
about you!

542
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:34,249
I'm tired of his nagging Amal.

543
00:49:34,985 --> 00:49:37,249
You'll prosper... earn money...

544
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:38,912
But he's worried it's dishonest!

545
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:40,821
Can't he see his own condition!

546
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,658
We don't have money to raise a child!

547
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:48,962
I've had two abortions...

548
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,396
Been on birth control pills
since three years!

549
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,029
Please calm down.

550
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:56,730
Same drama every night!

551
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,502
Pride! His father never took a bribe!

552
00:49:58,575 --> 00:49:59,974
And I suffer due to his bullshit
principles!

553
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,536
I told him yesterday...

554
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,445
Enough of this nonsense!

555
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:16,317
Enough is enough! Do something!

556
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:17,955
Look at the state of this house!

557
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,788
Can anyone use that filthy bathroom?

558
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,833
Does no work but preach!

559
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:30,065
Please calm down.

560
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:31,700
Leave me alone!

561
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,449
How are you?

562
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,018
Can't understand how to put
it together!

563
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:28,726
How was your Dhaka trip?

564
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:33,002
Really busy.
Constantly on the move...

565
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:35,771
From one office to the other...

566
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:37,633
...to factory sites

567
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:41,970
But I visited father's ancestral
land by the Padma river...

568
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,678
Felt so nostalgic.

569
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,744
Now do you understand what
the job is?

570
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:58,828
There's no clear job description
in the Import - Export sector.

571
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:02,695
How did you get this job?

572
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,364
You don't have any experience.

573
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,898
Remember I told you about
my friend Robin?

574
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,834
He organised it through his
company's director...

575
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,576
Good! Very good!

576
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,281
Sohag...

577
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,415
Sohag...

578
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:33,753
Hope you are happy about my job?

579
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:36,464
No.

580
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:38,598
This is too complex...

581
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:41,334
Looks deceptively easy!

582
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:51,005
I don't know how to face
Sohag anymore...

583
00:52:54,017 --> 00:53:00,081
I asked for a medical
loan from office.

584
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,982
My boss laughed and said...

585
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,957
How can you ask for a loan...

586
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,762
...when the company is shutting down?

587
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:12,333
I'm going crazy.

588
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:19,538
Don't know why I'm telling you all this!

589
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:23,640
Why not Shovan?

590
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:28,917
But give me some time.

591
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,277
Let me see if I can manage.

592
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,955
Are you mad? How?

593
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,522
We need five lakh rupees!

594
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:40,756
You know chemotherapy is expensive.

595
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,855
Let's see.

596
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,993
Something will work out.

597
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:57,972
<i>"A drizzling breezy night</i>
<i>settles down..."</i>

598
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:06,353
<i>"My unfolded love letter rests</i>
<i>with a moody envelope..."</i>

599
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:17,595
<i>"Unknowingly I lean towards you..."</i>

600
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:27,300
<i>"A drizzling breezy night</i>
<i>settles down..."</i>

601
00:54:27,344 --> 00:54:35,547
<i>"My unfolded love letter rests</i>
<i>with a moody envelope..."</i>

602
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:46,891
<i>"Unknowingly I lean towards you..."</i>

603
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:16,590
<i>"This nameless love,"</i>

604
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:24,660
<i>"This dark- dotted beauty</i>
<i>that adorns your lips..."</i>

605
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:33,702
<i>"A lingering touch,</i>
<i>lifts my spirits."</i>

606
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:38,042
<i>"A drizzling breezy night</i>
<i>settles down..."</i>

607
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:45,583
<i>"My unfolded love letter rests</i>
<i>with a moody envelope..."</i>

608
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:58,567
<i>"Unknowingly I lean towards you..."</i>

609
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:07,504
<i>"Unknowingly,</i>
<i>perhaps... today."</i>

610
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:33,266
He's not familiar with Bangkok.

611
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:34,904
I'll send him with the group?

612
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,604
No. Send him alone.
He's educated...

613
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,609
Looks innocent too.

614
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:46,345
There's something about him...

615
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,984
Not like the others.
He'll be good for our work.

616
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:54,887
And for the first time, let it be
a tourist trip...

617
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:56,756
No work.

618
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:59,955
Okay. I wanted to send a gift for
Mr. Haq...

619
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,764
That's okay.

620
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:05,362
Make him speak to me later.

621
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:06,729
Okay, Madam.

622
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:18,009
- Hello.
- Sit down.

623
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:25,345
This has all the information
about Bangkok.

624
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,916
Study it carefully.

625
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,718
You have a morning flight day after...

626
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,890
Enjoy your first day in Bangkok!

627
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,727
No work.

628
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,831
On the second day you have
to run a small errand.

629
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:50,370
Carry this packet very carefully.

630
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:53,983
Keep this card.

631
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,309
Meet him.

632
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,784
You don't have to carry anything back.

633
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:07,559
Madam will decide if you'll be paid
for this trip.

634
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:12,493
Okay, Sir. Sorry... I mean
Brother Badal.

635
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:16,365
Here, take this.

636
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:22,302
Amal, let me give you some advice.

637
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:27,779
Think carefully before taking
lifts from strangers!

638
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:33,513
You'll get into trouble.

639
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:02,648
First time?

640
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:03,751
Yes.

641
00:59:04,454 --> 00:59:05,751
Purpose of visit?

642
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:07,518
Tourist.

643
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:08,956
Look at camera please.

644
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:14,894
Enjoy your visit.

645
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,595
Taxi. Taxi.

646
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:19,301
Quick. Quick.

647
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:20,831
Yes. Get in.

648
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:23,599
Taxi. Taxi.

649
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:48,823
Yes. Tell me...

650
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:53,392
No. He wasn't on the flight...

651
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,374
I'm going back.

652
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,542
Let's see what I can do...

653
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:06,880
I'll call you later.

654
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:14,423
If you don't mind my asking...

655
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,958
Are you upset?

656
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,294
I'm Amal.

657
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:29,495
First time in Bangkok...
on a vacation.

658
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:21,412
Look, look. You want?
Sexy! Sexy!

659
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:43,042
Hi sexy! You want some good time.

660
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:04,228
One minute. Don't move.

661
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,905
- Done.
- Thank God!

662
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:15,904
You made me sit for so long!

663
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:17,674
Come, see your portrait.

664
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:30,953
This is me!

665
01:02:34,064 --> 01:02:35,725
This is Gautam Buddha!

666
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:37,732
Like Buddha...

667
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:40,494
Not you, yet almost like you.

668
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:44,065
Maybe, you'll also give up
this material world some day...

669
01:02:45,008 --> 01:02:48,603
Do we really know our hidden desires?

670
01:03:50,507 --> 01:03:51,565
I'm Rijula.

671
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,899
How are you?

672
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,677
I won't be formal with you.

673
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:03,015
That's good.

674
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,345
You came to Bangkok for work?

675
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:07,748
Work?

676
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:11,986
No... Just a holiday.

677
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,970
What are you doing?

678
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,041
Just wondering...

679
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:34,346
If I jump from here...
will I live or die?

680
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:44,521
- Rijula.
- What?

681
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:48,828
Come. Let's go.

682
01:04:57,807 --> 01:04:59,866
I'm not religious at all.

683
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:04,277
But when I feel restless...

684
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:07,415
...sitting in front of Buddha calms me.

685
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:10,952
That's the only thing this city gave me!

686
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:13,946
The only way I can survive...

687
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:20,389
Tell me what's wrong...

688
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,922
I know it's personal.

689
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:24,899
You don't even know me.

690
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:27,462
That's not a problem.

691
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:31,940
Sometimes I trust a stranger more.

692
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:36,341
I also prefer to remain a stranger
in the crowd.

693
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:45,321
Let's go.

694
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:46,981
What's wrong?

695
01:05:47,056 --> 01:05:48,023
Let's go.

696
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:01,462
Sorry.

697
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:03,339
Sorry.

698
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:15,007
Bangkok has become really
unsafe for me.

699
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:17,636
I never thought this could happen!

700
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:20,439
I thought I'm working for
a travel agency...

701
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,683
But it turned out to be
an escort agency!

702
01:07:24,387 --> 01:07:26,981
I did a short course on travel,
tourism...

703
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:29,281
...and hospitality from Kolkata.

704
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,850
They sent me here on a six
month contract.

705
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:33,953
It turned out to be a complete fraud!

706
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:37,498
Now they want me to
sign a three year bond...

707
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:39,034
...and work as an escort.

708
01:07:40,636 --> 01:07:42,661
They even took my passport!

709
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:47,772
I stole it day before and ran away.

710
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:58,513
Staying here now is too risky!

711
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,252
But I don't have money for plane fare...

712
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:03,521
They didn't even pay me this
month's salary!

713
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:07,226
Someone from Kolkata
was supposed to come...

714
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,230
...and get my tickets done.

715
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,457
But he didn't come, didn't even call.

716
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:15,702
You come to know your true friends...

717
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:17,262
...only during crisis.

718
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:21,640
They're dangerous. Capable of
anything!

719
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:27,578
I couldn't imagine an educated,
sophisticated...

720
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:29,710
...woman can do this!

721
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:32,352
Took so much money for this sham!

722
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:35,748
She said "Girls we do honour
our commitment...

723
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:37,690
...for hundred percent placements."

724
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,690
"You've a choice between
Bangkok and Dubai!"

725
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:44,430
Thank God I didn't opt for Dubai!

726
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,266
Dangerous woman!

727
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:49,828
Incorrigible! She calls herself Addy!

728
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:54,641
The naughty ones call me Addy.

729
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,769
That's her punchline.

730
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,370
Bitch!

731
01:08:59,816 --> 01:09:00,976
Addy!

732
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:03,417
You know her?

733
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:08,289
No. No! How will I know her?

734
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:11,755
Sounds like she's into flesh trade...

735
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,666
By the way, you lied too.

736
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:25,002
You're not here for a holiday.

737
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,581
Do you know this place?

738
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,914
Welcome.

739
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,287
This way please.

740
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:18,417
Anisur Haq.

741
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:20,889
This is for you.

742
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:22,692
They asked me to give it to you.

743
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:32,773
- This is your first trip?
- Yes Sir.

744
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:34,542
Lucky!

745
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,374
Not everyone gets a free
trip to Bangkok!

746
01:10:56,899 --> 01:11:01,563
The girl outside the parlour...
Is she with you?

747
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,862
Why? Who is she?

748
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:09,444
Friend Sir... We were in college
together.

749
01:11:10,012 --> 01:11:11,843
She works here.

750
01:11:12,281 --> 01:11:16,308
We're flying back together tonight.

751
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:19,717
That's why I...

752
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:25,624
- Bring the girl inside.
- Yes.

753
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,788
Sir, your parcel.

754
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:33,832
Please come in.

755
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,963
Amal.
- Yes Sir?

756
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:45,607
So... I wanted to say...

757
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:50,348
I don't think
you'll get paid for this trip.

758
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,018
I know Sir.

759
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,982
Want to earn some extra money?

760
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:04,923
I didn't get you Sir!

761
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:10,396
You'll need to carry a leather bag
to Kolkata.

762
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:13,339
Check it in.

763
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,644
Our man will be there at arrival
to take it.

764
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:20,804
- Leather bag?
- You'll be paid well.

765
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:24,510
Check in luggage? Right?

766
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,817
You'll be paid well!

767
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:34,995
500 dollars.

768
01:12:36,932 --> 01:12:39,560
I don't pay anyone more than this.

769
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,359
Where will I get the money sir?

770
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:43,964
Don't worry young man!

771
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:46,941
You'll get it here.

772
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,077
But... keep in mind...

773
01:12:50,346 --> 01:12:52,405
Brother Badal...

774
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:56,642
...must not know anything about this!

775
01:12:58,487 --> 01:12:59,852
Not a word!

776
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:07,022
Go here at 8.30 pm.

777
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:14,795
Yes!

778
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,668
Such a beautiful city!

779
01:13:22,845 --> 01:13:24,472
Bad luck that I have to run away!

780
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:27,980
Why don't you get another job?

781
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,415
Are you crazy?

782
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:31,379
Don't you get how dangerous
they are?

783
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,685
It's a huge, dangerous nexus!

784
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:37,825
Though honestly, I fear myself a
lot more.

785
01:13:40,396 --> 01:13:41,693
What do you mean?

786
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:46,968
Their tempting offers...
Difficult to resist!

787
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,834
But if I give in, there'll be no return!

788
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,303
I'll always remain
a high-society call girl.

789
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:55,400
Easy money, big money!
It's a huge addiction!

790
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:05,252
It must be somewhere here.

791
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:06,580
Stop. Stop.

792
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:25,330
- Keep this.
- Thank you.

793
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:44,882
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you.

794
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,393
You're welcome.

795
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,788
Let's go.

796
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:53,690
Hello Sir.

797
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:57,694
Thank you.

798
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:13,379
Take the bag.

799
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:16,315
Not here.

800
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,590
I'll take it outside.

801
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,693
Okay. I'm coming from the washroom.

802
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:24,763
Get me a prepaid cab to Ultadanga.

803
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:29,803
I'll drop you. It's on my way.

804
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:33,836
Okay. Fine.
I'll be back in a minute.

805
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:36,604
- Excuse me Ma'am.
- Yes?

806
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:38,874
Please show me your passport.

807
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:40,939
Where are you coming from?

808
01:15:41,383 --> 01:15:42,577
Bangkok.

809
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,449
Do you have anything to declare?

810
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:46,785
Not really.

811
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:49,586
Please put your bag through
the X - Ray.

812
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:50,522
Why?

813
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:52,288
That's the rule.

814
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:54,486
What rule? What rule!

815
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:56,588
This is the rule.

816
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,630
But you're not following it with others!

817
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:01,261
You're imposing it on people who
already follow it!

818
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:02,269
Why are you getting excited?

819
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:03,896
I'm not getting excited!

820
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:07,704
Why are you harassing me?

821
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,300
No! I'm not harassing you!

822
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:11,936
It's okay. Let her go.

823
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:13,575
Madam. Please.

824
01:16:13,616 --> 01:16:14,947
Thank you. May I?

825
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:16,579
- Please.
- Thank you.

826
01:16:41,777 --> 01:16:42,573
Where's Rijula?

827
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:44,545
Hey listen! Hello!

828
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,012
- Amal?
- Yes.

829
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:48,913
Come on! Let's go!

830
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:54,548
You have Mr. Haq's card?
I'm Rafik.

831
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:55,783
Show me the card.

832
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,259
Where's the bag? Give it.

833
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,325
Bag! Give it!

834
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:10,231
I kept it inside a woman's suitcase...
Rijula

835
01:17:10,472 --> 01:17:13,703
What! Where is she?

836
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,276
- Rijula!
- Where is she?

837
01:17:27,922 --> 01:17:28,911
What happened?

838
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:30,282
- One minute.
- Where is she?

839
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,720
Sorry!

840
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:38,358
Hey! Where's the girl?

841
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:39,596
One minute!

842
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:40,634
What one minute?

843
01:17:40,902 --> 01:17:45,236
Did you see a girl with a
yellow and red suitcase?

844
01:17:45,306 --> 01:17:46,603
Wearing a blue top?

845
01:17:46,674 --> 01:17:47,663
Yes!

846
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:49,505
She left in Ramua's cab...

847
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:51,738
Hey! Where is the cab's garage?

848
01:17:51,813 --> 01:17:55,772
Moulali, Choton's garage.

849
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:57,441
Let's go!

850
01:17:57,852 --> 01:18:00,980
Give me her number. Come on!

851
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:03,315
- I don't have it.
- You don't have it?

852
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:05,423
Where does she stay? Address?

853
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:10,698
I met her two days back...
Forgot to take it.

854
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:14,531
What! No number! No address!

855
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:15,762
And you've put the bag in
her suitcase?

856
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,499
You think I'm an idiot!

857
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:20,871
Get in the car! Bloody idiot!

858
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:27,607
Anybody out here?

859
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:28,842
Who's there?

860
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,677
Ramua's parked his cab?

861
01:18:32,387 --> 01:18:34,184
Yes, ten minutes back.

862
01:18:35,356 --> 01:18:37,381
Call him, it's urgent.

863
01:18:37,558 --> 01:18:39,549
But he must be asleep...

864
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:43,455
Hey boy!

865
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,458
Didn't I tell you... it's urgent!

866
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:49,726
Go on... Hurry!

867
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:56,902
He's here.

868
01:18:57,445 --> 01:19:00,437
Sorry... We woke you up.

869
01:19:01,683 --> 01:19:04,584
A girl in blue top took your cab...

870
01:19:04,652 --> 01:19:05,983
...from the airport?

871
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,315
Where did you drop her?

872
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:10,885
Answer him.

873
01:19:11,959 --> 01:19:14,325
Outside Ultadanga Housing Estate.

874
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:16,454
You didn't go inside!

875
01:19:16,531 --> 01:19:17,793
No.

876
01:19:34,682 --> 01:19:35,774
Yes sir. I got the snap.

877
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:37,841
Her face is clear?

878
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:41,677
Yes sir. Don't worry. I'm trying
my best.

879
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:46,350
You boy! See this!

880
01:19:49,297 --> 01:19:51,197
What were you celebrating?

881
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:55,192
Thought you'd fool us?

882
01:19:57,839 --> 01:19:59,238
Stupid!

883
01:19:59,974 --> 01:20:01,464
Security!

884
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:04,377
Yes?

885
01:20:06,748 --> 01:20:08,375
Do you know her?

886
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:13,517
Did she get in this morning?

887
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:14,950
Are you cops?

888
01:20:15,223 --> 01:20:17,657
No. We've come from the airport.

889
01:20:17,892 --> 01:20:20,884
This girl took his bag by mistake.

890
01:20:21,462 --> 01:20:22,588
Oh!

891
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,256
Let me have another look.

892
01:20:26,534 --> 01:20:28,297
She looks familiar.

893
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:31,700
Check in Arati Mitra's flat...

894
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,398
...E/16.

895
01:20:35,643 --> 01:20:37,372
Anyone home?

896
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:39,941
Anyone home?

897
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:46,682
Yes? What is it?

898
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:47,910
Are you Mrs. Mitra?

899
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:49,417
Yes.

900
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:53,350
Will you call Rijula please?

901
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:56,759
Rijula? She doesn't stay here.

902
01:20:58,933 --> 01:21:01,424
But didn't she come here this morning?

903
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:03,231
Who told you that?

904
01:21:03,604 --> 01:21:05,299
She was a paying guest here.

905
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:10,242
- Left eight months back.
- You have her address?

906
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:14,715
She fought before leaving...
Why should she leave an address?

907
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:18,309
But she said she's from Durgapur.

908
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:20,951
She introduced a lady as her mother...

909
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:22,946
...who turned out to be a fake.

910
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:27,684
Any friends or relatives?

911
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:29,286
No. Sorry.

912
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:30,624
Listen boy!

913
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:36,430
Figure out what to do.

914
01:21:38,272 --> 01:21:41,673
I want the bag by 7 pm!

915
01:21:43,778 --> 01:21:47,646
Keep your phone on.

916
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:53,644
I've spent a lot of time on this.

917
01:21:54,555 --> 01:21:56,682
I've other things to do.

918
01:21:58,559 --> 01:22:00,857
I'll drop you home.

919
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:03,286
No. It's okay.

920
01:22:05,566 --> 01:22:07,329
I'll get down here.

921
01:22:09,303 --> 01:22:10,736
Where will you go?

922
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:14,197
Where?

923
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:17,971
Please.

924
01:22:19,814 --> 01:22:21,805
Think carefully...

925
01:22:24,485 --> 01:22:27,181
And listen... Come closer.

926
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,555
Closer.

927
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:35,553
Closer.

928
01:22:40,902 --> 01:22:43,837
Don't try to run like a child...

929
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,938
I'm still trusting you.

930
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:52,303
Understood?

931
01:23:00,788 --> 01:23:02,221
Go.

932
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:30,281
Your phone's ringing. Pick up!

933
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:42,157
- Hello.
- This is Rijula.

934
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:46,225
- What?
- I know you are angry.

935
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:50,361
- Please...
- Don't worry.

936
01:23:50,438 --> 01:23:51,905
I'll return the bag.

937
01:23:52,873 --> 01:23:56,434
Rijula. Are you playing games
with me?

938
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,344
No. Cool down.

939
01:23:58,512 --> 01:24:00,707
I'm at Salt Lake.
Beside Karunamoyee.

940
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:12,417
- Is Rijula home?
- You are?

941
01:24:12,493 --> 01:24:14,620
Amal. Please call her.

942
01:24:15,396 --> 01:24:16,727
Come inside.

943
01:24:24,872 --> 01:24:26,499
Where are you?

944
01:24:31,345 --> 01:24:32,403
Water...

945
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:38,876
- Sheela di!
- Coming.

946
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:43,485
Oh good. You're here. Come in.

947
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:46,860
This is my school friend's house.
She's out.

948
01:24:47,828 --> 01:24:49,159
Sit.

949
01:24:52,299 --> 01:24:53,493
Sit!

950
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,772
- Rijula?
- Yes?

951
01:25:04,512 --> 01:25:05,638
The bag?

952
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,339
Where's the bag?

953
01:25:13,454 --> 01:25:14,921
You don't trust me? Right?

954
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:16,213
Trust!

955
01:25:18,559 --> 01:25:21,187
That's what got me in this mess!

956
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:22,790
What mess?

957
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,527
- Why did you?
- Run away from the airport?

958
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:34,640
I saw Addy and her Sir at the airport.

959
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:37,710
I was terrified!

960
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,445
They were talking, didn't see me.

961
01:25:41,649 --> 01:25:43,708
I jumped into the nearest cab
and left.

962
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,247
What the hell!

963
01:25:49,557 --> 01:25:53,653
You said you were going somewhere
else... not here!

964
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:56,625
Didn't even think about my situation!

965
01:25:58,399 --> 01:25:59,593
Think what?

966
01:26:01,535 --> 01:26:04,766
If they kidnapped or killed you...

967
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,340
...would they get the bag?

968
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,240
Listen. I'll be honest with you.

969
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:19,346
I did feel greedy.

970
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:21,546
Wanted to know what's inside.

971
01:26:22,423 --> 01:26:25,881
So... you opened the bag?

972
01:26:27,294 --> 01:26:28,454
No.

973
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:33,694
I was waiting. Wanted to open it
with you.

974
01:26:33,868 --> 01:26:36,166
Please Rijula! This is madness.

975
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:38,235
Don't do it please!

976
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:41,297
Rijula. Don't!

977
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:45,345
This is not done in our line of work.

978
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,442
Rijula, don't be crazy!

979
01:26:48,716 --> 01:26:50,479
If you open the bag...

980
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:52,412
They'll blow my brains out.

981
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:54,716
Amal! Take the wrong turn!

982
01:26:54,789 --> 01:26:56,757
Or else you'll rot all your life!

983
01:26:57,358 --> 01:26:58,518
Leave it!

984
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,389
Don't behave like a melodramatic
film hero!

985
01:27:01,462 --> 01:27:02,759
Rijula!

986
01:27:08,469 --> 01:27:11,461
You didn't answer?
What are you doing?

987
01:27:16,544 --> 01:27:18,603
Please! Rijula!

988
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:21,778
One second, wait.

989
01:27:37,231 --> 01:27:38,425
Oh God!

990
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:41,234
Exactly what I thought!

991
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:51,234
What if they caught us at the airport!

992
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:08,624
Can you count money fast?

993
01:28:10,564 --> 01:28:11,724
Can you?

994
01:28:11,932 --> 01:28:12,921
No.

995
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:29,211
B*****d! He's not picking up.

996
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:31,183
Pick up! You idiot!

997
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:37,248
97, 98, 99,100...

998
01:28:38,692 --> 01:28:41,559
One lakh...

999
01:28:43,664 --> 01:28:46,724
- In all, that's one crore rupees!
- Rijula!

1000
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,667
- 20 lakhs, 10 for each of us!
- Listen to me!

1001
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:53,937
We can't take
money from here.

1002
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:55,774
I'll be in serious trouble!

1003
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:59,337
So? Take another job.

1004
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:01,442
Deny that you've taken the money.

1005
01:29:01,515 --> 01:29:04,848
Let me tell you Amal.
I need this money.

1006
01:29:05,853 --> 01:29:06,945
I need it badly.

1007
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:10,852
We have taken the maximum risk.

1008
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:12,985
Why shouldn't we take it?

1009
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,428
Even I need it.

1010
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:18,321
But not for myself.

1011
01:29:19,633 --> 01:29:20,793
Then who?

1012
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:24,933
I understand.

1013
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:29,239
But let the cash be here for now.

1014
01:29:30,277 --> 01:29:31,676
They might come to your house.

1015
01:29:32,413 --> 01:29:36,509
We might need to get out of the city.

1016
01:29:37,284 --> 01:29:39,377
Out of this country if needed.

1017
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,512
I have a friend in Melbourne.

1018
01:29:41,588 --> 01:29:44,250
Nidhi Verma. Close friend.

1019
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:46,589
Are you mad?

1020
01:29:47,261 --> 01:29:51,755
And why will I leave Kolkata?

1021
01:29:54,401 --> 01:29:55,891
What will I say at home?

1022
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:58,803
So? Many people have
transferable jobs.

1023
01:29:58,872 --> 01:30:00,339
One day here, one day there...

1024
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:01,567
What's the problem?

1025
01:30:02,242 --> 01:30:06,838
If you get caught say I'm responsible.

1026
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:08,912
It's not right, Rijula.

1027
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:37,438
Hello?

1028
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:40,647
Why weren't you picking up?

1029
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:45,409
Don't forget - I know where you stay!

1030
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:47,810
I've good news...

1031
01:30:48,856 --> 01:30:50,483
I'll get the bag.

1032
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:51,918
You still haven't got it!

1033
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:53,489
The girl called me.

1034
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:56,352
She's gone to Durgapur.

1035
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:58,457
She'll be back this evening.

1036
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:01,595
Actually...

1037
01:31:03,237 --> 01:31:06,968
...we fought in the flight.

1038
01:31:07,608 --> 01:31:10,270
That's why
she left without informing me.

1039
01:31:10,544 --> 01:31:15,709
Come home at 10.30 pm...

1040
01:31:16,717 --> 01:31:18,412
You'll get the bag.

1041
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:20,948
Are you cooking up a story?

1042
01:31:21,488 --> 01:31:23,922
Why should I... I have nowhere
to run...

1043
01:31:24,191 --> 01:31:29,527
Okay. Remember, 10.30 pm.

1044
01:31:29,863 --> 01:31:30,830
Sister!

1045
01:31:31,532 --> 01:31:32,590
Sister!

1046
01:31:38,172 --> 01:31:39,537
Where's the red bag?

1047
01:31:41,575 --> 01:31:42,803
Sister!

1048
01:31:44,344 --> 01:31:45,436
Sister!

1049
01:31:45,512 --> 01:31:47,503
- What happened?
- Where's the red bag?

1050
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:49,344
On top of the cupboard.

1051
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:55,288
I'll leave right now.

1052
01:31:55,355 --> 01:31:57,880
But I cooked your favourite
mustard fish!

1053
01:32:01,862 --> 01:32:03,557
No time to eat!

1054
01:32:05,732 --> 01:32:08,929
Pack these. I'll be late.

1055
01:32:09,536 --> 01:32:10,730
Where are you going?

1056
01:32:10,804 --> 01:32:11,930
I'll tell you later.

1057
01:32:12,206 --> 01:32:14,902
Here's your towel. Water's ready.

1058
01:32:15,742 --> 01:32:16,800
Go for a bath.

1059
01:32:16,844 --> 01:32:18,334
And then eat...

1060
01:32:18,779 --> 01:32:21,339
You look like a ghost!

1061
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:23,507
Where are you going?

1062
01:32:29,723 --> 01:32:32,317
Keep this in your cupboard.
Lock it.

1063
01:32:32,593 --> 01:32:35,460
It has important documents.
Don't give it to anyone.

1064
01:32:36,263 --> 01:32:38,231
I'll be back late... And then I'll
leave again.

1065
01:32:38,298 --> 01:32:39,424
Going out of Kolkata.

1066
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,762
Where?

1067
01:32:45,339 --> 01:32:46,465
I don't know.

1068
01:32:47,641 --> 01:32:48,665
What does that mean?

1069
01:32:48,742 --> 01:32:50,232
Forget that.

1070
01:32:50,611 --> 01:32:53,478
A man called Rafik will come
at 10.30 pm.

1071
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:55,448
Give this bag to him.

1072
01:32:58,218 --> 01:32:59,776
What's in it?

1073
01:33:00,687 --> 01:33:01,949
Why are you asking so many questions?

1074
01:33:02,189 --> 01:33:05,488
Just give the bag to the man!

1075
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,859
Do as I say!

1076
01:33:08,262 --> 01:33:09,695
Don't ask so many questions!

1077
01:33:19,206 --> 01:33:21,367
I'm under a lot of pressure.

1078
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:23,300
Not in the right frame of mind.

1079
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:24,738
Sorry.

1080
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:33,513
This perfume is for you.

1081
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:37,650
I'm in a hurry.

1082
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:39,555
Please pack these.

1083
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,261
Yes, Madam.

1084
01:33:50,237 --> 01:33:51,761
Madam wants to talk to you.

1085
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:55,238
Amal!

1086
01:33:55,309 --> 01:34:00,269
You must come to office right
after the tour.

1087
01:34:00,514 --> 01:34:02,846
There are no excuses for this.

1088
01:34:03,483 --> 01:34:05,383
- Did you meet Robin?
- No Madam.

1089
01:34:05,586 --> 01:34:06,951
He's not reachable since two days!

1090
01:34:07,321 --> 01:34:08,788
Go and find him.

1091
01:34:08,855 --> 01:34:10,686
He's your childhood friend.

1092
01:34:10,891 --> 01:34:12,688
Do it quickly! Now!

1093
01:34:12,893 --> 01:34:14,861
Okay... I'll go to his house.

1094
01:34:14,928 --> 01:34:17,294
His family knows nothing.

1095
01:34:17,364 --> 01:34:20,299
Let me check. I'll let you know.

1096
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,539
So! How was the trip?

1097
01:34:31,345 --> 01:34:32,869
Great, Brother.

1098
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:34,906
- Good.
- Oh...

1099
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,384
I had to return this leftover money.

1100
01:34:42,623 --> 01:34:44,181
Keep it.

1101
01:34:45,726 --> 01:34:48,286
You'll be going to Bangkok day after.

1102
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:51,497
Bangkok? Again?

1103
01:34:51,565 --> 01:34:52,327
Yes.

1104
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:54,230
But Brother Badal...

1105
01:34:56,236 --> 01:35:01,640
Actually mother is not well.

1106
01:35:02,409 --> 01:35:04,536
She might need hospitalisation.

1107
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:11,207
Brother is also not home. His wife
is alone.

1108
01:35:13,587 --> 01:35:15,214
Robin's also vanished.

1109
01:35:16,923 --> 01:35:19,448
And Addy is playing her games!

1110
01:35:22,262 --> 01:35:23,752
We must do something.

1111
01:35:24,398 --> 01:35:25,160
What do you think?

1112
01:35:25,565 --> 01:35:28,659
Hi handsome! How are you?

1113
01:35:28,902 --> 01:35:30,529
I needed your help...

1114
01:35:30,837 --> 01:35:35,137
I can't contact Robin. His phone is off.

1115
01:35:35,342 --> 01:35:36,366
Oh!

1116
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:38,309
He's not in town.

1117
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:40,912
How do I get in touch with him?

1118
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:42,273
Sorry.

1119
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:44,680
You can't...

1120
01:35:45,485 --> 01:35:46,884
Please help me.

1121
01:35:47,254 --> 01:35:48,881
There's a personal problem.

1122
01:35:48,922 --> 01:35:50,583
Oh really!

1123
01:35:50,891 --> 01:35:52,688
Personal problem!

1124
01:35:54,628 --> 01:35:56,186
I'm so sorry!

1125
01:35:57,431 --> 01:36:01,162
Okay. If he gets in touch...

1126
01:36:01,768 --> 01:36:04,259
I'll let him know.

1127
01:36:05,539 --> 01:36:06,335
That's for sure.

1128
01:36:06,406 --> 01:36:07,304
Thank you so much.

1129
01:36:07,374 --> 01:36:08,466
Bye.

1130
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:12,769
Feeling really depressed.

1131
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:21,253
Don't know how to handle this anymore.

1132
01:36:24,224 --> 01:36:28,456
You'll fall sick with so much worry!

1133
01:36:49,149 --> 01:36:51,174
This is for you. From Bangkok.

1134
01:36:54,788 --> 01:36:57,313
- Amal.
- Yes Aunty?

1135
01:36:57,824 --> 01:36:59,553
Will you eat something?

1136
01:36:59,826 --> 01:37:03,455
No, Aunty. Got to run!

1137
01:37:04,664 --> 01:37:06,791
That's all you're doing these days.

1138
01:37:11,371 --> 01:37:13,703
Is mother right?

1139
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,701
When will I be able to run away?

1140
01:37:20,714 --> 01:37:27,552
I am killing my family a little bit
each day...

1141
01:37:57,317 --> 01:38:00,286
Listen. Pune is a safe hiding place.

1142
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,520
Best in many ways. I'm getting
tickets done.

1143
01:38:04,858 --> 01:38:07,292
Train leaves at 9.55 pm.
Azad Hind Express.

1144
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:09,587
Come to the station on time.

1145
01:38:09,663 --> 01:38:11,494
Call you later.

1146
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:48,558
What nonsense! You're kidding!

1147
01:38:49,536 --> 01:38:51,697
No Sir... Twenty's missing.

1148
01:38:51,771 --> 01:38:52,931
Call him now!

1149
01:38:53,406 --> 01:38:56,569
I did that. It's out of reach.

1150
01:38:56,643 --> 01:39:01,546
I'll get a call from Karachi about
the consignment!

1151
01:39:01,948 --> 01:39:03,575
What will I tell them?

1152
01:39:03,917 --> 01:39:08,286
Let me see Sir. Don't worry.

1153
01:39:24,938 --> 01:39:25,870
Hello!

1154
01:39:26,206 --> 01:39:27,730
You slept so early!

1155
01:39:30,577 --> 01:39:33,478
- Who is this?
- Robin Hood.

1156
01:39:36,416 --> 01:39:41,319
Robin?
Where are you?

1157
01:39:41,688 --> 01:39:42,746
Hell!

1158
01:39:42,822 --> 01:39:44,483
That's what I told my family!

1159
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:45,782
Don't tell anyone I called.

1160
01:39:45,825 --> 01:39:50,262
Save my number under a different name.

1161
01:39:50,564 --> 01:39:51,792
Where are you?

1162
01:39:54,568 --> 01:39:57,662
I don't know. Really. I don't.

1163
01:39:57,737 --> 01:39:59,295
What's wrong?

1164
01:39:59,372 --> 01:40:04,503
I left Madam's job.

1165
01:40:04,678 --> 01:40:07,408
What are you saying?
What will you do?

1166
01:40:07,681 --> 01:40:09,308
I don't know...

1167
01:40:11,518 --> 01:40:13,418
Can't figure out anything...

1168
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:15,680
Amal! Listen to me!

1169
01:40:15,855 --> 01:40:17,720
Hello!

1170
01:40:52,926 --> 01:40:55,520
- Amal Biswas's room?
- That way.

1171
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:03,661
Amal? Amal?

1172
01:41:03,903 --> 01:41:05,234
Manju?

1173
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,668
Who is it?

1174
01:41:12,579 --> 01:41:13,477
Yes?

1175
01:41:13,546 --> 01:41:14,808
Where's Amal?

1176
01:41:15,782 --> 01:41:17,249
He's not here.

1177
01:41:17,283 --> 01:41:18,875
We know that.

1178
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:20,616
Where did he go?

1179
01:41:21,588 --> 01:41:24,557
He is out of town.

1180
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:27,619
Ask him to return.

1181
01:41:28,161 --> 01:41:29,560
What happened?

1182
01:41:30,797 --> 01:41:32,788
Ask him to return!

1183
01:41:33,299 --> 01:41:35,529
With the money! And ask for forgiveness.

1184
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:37,293
Or else!

1185
01:41:40,173 --> 01:41:42,164
Don't mind sister...

1186
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:44,943
...his dead body will come back home.

1187
01:41:48,915 --> 01:41:50,576
Let's go.

1188
01:42:05,532 --> 01:42:06,897
Who are they?

1189
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,227
No one.

1190
01:42:09,836 --> 01:42:11,861
They were looking for Amal.

1191
01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:13,496
Amal?

1192
01:42:14,274 --> 01:42:15,571
Why?

1193
01:42:18,712 --> 01:42:20,373
What happened?

1194
01:42:22,215 --> 01:42:23,876
Tell me what's wrong?

1195
01:42:27,487 --> 01:42:28,511
Manju!

1196
01:42:32,659 --> 01:42:34,320
Is Amal okay?

1197
01:42:34,394 --> 01:42:36,589
Yes...

1198
01:43:04,824 --> 01:43:06,587
Arrived from? Madam.

1199
01:43:07,227 --> 01:43:08,387
Bangalore.

1200
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:13,393
Mobile number please.

1201
01:43:16,402 --> 01:43:18,529
And Rs 2000 advance.

1202
01:43:29,682 --> 01:43:30,478
Thank you.

1203
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:32,450
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

1204
01:43:32,852 --> 01:43:35,787
Keep off my boys!

1205
01:43:36,422 --> 01:43:39,653
Madam! Compete with me.

1206
01:43:39,726 --> 01:43:41,489
I didn't say anything when you took...

1207
01:43:41,561 --> 01:43:42,823
...Robin away.

1208
01:43:43,797 --> 01:43:46,265
And now you're crossing all limits!

1209
01:43:46,733 --> 01:43:50,260
But who sets the limit? Madam!

1210
01:43:50,303 --> 01:43:52,669
Now you've taken the new boy too?

1211
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:56,270
Wrong information!

1212
01:43:56,342 --> 01:43:58,173
You think I'm a fool!

1213
01:43:59,612 --> 01:44:00,670
Bitch!

1214
01:44:11,825 --> 01:44:13,690
Pune has no hassles.

1215
01:44:15,628 --> 01:44:18,495
How about staring a small business here?

1216
01:44:20,233 --> 01:44:23,396
Our money will be the seed capital.

1217
01:44:26,406 --> 01:44:27,566
Seed capital!

1218
01:44:31,344 --> 01:44:33,642
You know the language of business well!

1219
01:44:35,648 --> 01:44:37,240
It's a common word.

1220
01:44:39,686 --> 01:44:41,654
Besides, I'm a commerce graduate.

1221
01:44:53,933 --> 01:44:56,299
- Yes?
- Sorry Madam.

1222
01:44:56,502 --> 01:44:57,935
Sorry to disturb you.

1223
01:44:58,404 --> 01:45:00,235
- May I come inside?
- Sure, come.

1224
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,205
Sorry Sir.

1225
01:45:05,845 --> 01:45:09,337
Madam you paid some advance...
- Yes.

1226
01:45:09,382 --> 01:45:11,748
But I didn't check it.

1227
01:45:11,918 --> 01:45:13,852
- Where did you get the notes?
- Why?

1228
01:45:14,721 --> 01:45:17,246
Madam, this is fake currency.

1229
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:27,561
Please give me new notes.
I'll fall into trouble.

1230
01:45:28,301 --> 01:45:30,360
How do you know it's fake?

1231
01:45:33,172 --> 01:45:34,298
Look!

1232
01:45:39,445 --> 01:45:41,413
Okay... I'll bring it to the reception.

1233
01:45:41,481 --> 01:45:42,505
Okay, Madam.

1234
01:45:42,582 --> 01:45:43,514
Madam...

1235
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:46,416
Don't keep this money with you.

1236
01:45:46,619 --> 01:45:47,847
You might get into trouble.

1237
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:50,751
Okay, Sir. Bye.

1238
01:46:43,609 --> 01:46:46,339
Sorry... Please check it.

1239
01:46:49,415 --> 01:46:51,178
Which horse will you bet on today?

1240
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,445
- Silvenia Number 7.
- Give me the keys!

1241
01:46:56,656 --> 01:46:58,783
Yes Madam. It's fine.

1242
01:47:03,162 --> 01:47:06,598
We have to win the race today!

1243
01:47:06,666 --> 01:47:07,860
Yes Sir.

1244
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:26,913
Let's go there.

1245
01:47:35,361 --> 01:47:40,958
First time? Bet on Number 7.

1246
01:47:41,367 --> 01:47:42,197
Yes!

1247
01:47:51,411 --> 01:47:53,675
- Place and win.
- Okay. Which one?

1248
01:47:53,746 --> 01:47:55,213
- This one.
- Okay.

1249
01:47:55,281 --> 01:47:55,804
Number 4.

1250
01:48:02,855 --> 01:48:05,221
Come on!

1251
01:48:05,825 --> 01:48:07,417
Come on!

1252
01:48:09,862 --> 01:48:12,831
Yes. God! We did it!

1253
01:48:12,899 --> 01:48:13,695
What's the rate?

1254
01:48:13,766 --> 01:48:15,666
Madam, fourteen for ten!

1255
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:20,797
Yes!

1256
01:48:22,942 --> 01:48:24,204
Come on!

1257
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:28,347
Yes!

1258
01:48:28,714 --> 01:48:29,908
One lakh fifty.

1259
01:48:33,886 --> 01:48:34,716
Two lakhs.

1260
01:48:34,887 --> 01:48:36,252
- Which one?
- Number 8.

1261
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,455
Yes! Yes!

1262
01:48:59,912 --> 01:49:02,779
We did it!

1263
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,413
Hurry up!

1264
01:49:07,353 --> 01:49:09,651
Give me notes of Rs. 500.

1265
01:49:09,956 --> 01:49:10,923
Okay.

1266
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:14,453
Hurry up!

1267
01:49:38,584 --> 01:49:39,778
What happened?

1268
01:49:47,426 --> 01:49:53,763
Listen! Stop being miserable
about me.

1269
01:49:56,936 --> 01:49:59,461
Your whole life is ahead of you.

1270
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:06,873
Instead, let me worry about you
while I'm alive.

1271
01:50:17,256 --> 01:50:21,352
I switched off my phone after
reaching Pune.

1272
01:50:24,664 --> 01:50:26,632
God knows what's happening
in Kolkata.

1273
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:28,833
Forget about Kolkata.

1274
01:50:29,702 --> 01:50:33,331
I mailed Nidhi when you were
in the shower.

1275
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,498
Told her about you.

1276
01:50:35,741 --> 01:50:37,538
Its late night there...

1277
01:50:38,344 --> 01:50:40,244
She'll get my mail in the morning.

1278
01:50:40,746 --> 01:50:41,906
We'll go for a holiday.

1279
01:50:42,181 --> 01:50:43,910
I've told her for a sponsor letter.

1280
01:50:44,183 --> 01:50:45,514
She'll be very happy.

1281
01:50:46,185 --> 01:50:47,482
We'll get the visa from Mumbai...

1282
01:50:47,553 --> 01:50:49,487
And a cheap ticket.

1283
01:50:50,489 --> 01:50:51,854
You want to eat?

1284
01:50:52,225 --> 01:50:53,783
Want to eat?

1285
01:50:53,826 --> 01:50:55,259
I'm hungry.

1286
01:50:56,862 --> 01:50:58,625
Mother, eat this.

1287
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:15,846
Hello, Amal!
Where are you?

1288
01:51:15,915 --> 01:51:19,316
Calm down... Listen.

1289
01:51:19,385 --> 01:51:23,378
Amal, don't return without the money!

1290
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:24,656
Rafik came?

1291
01:51:24,724 --> 01:51:28,751
Yes. Early morning...

1292
01:51:29,462 --> 01:51:31,259
He threatened us...

1293
01:51:31,297 --> 01:51:35,324
Asked you to return the money and
beg forgiveness...

1294
01:51:36,469 --> 01:51:38,699
I called you many times.

1295
01:51:39,505 --> 01:51:41,939
Your phone was switched off.

1296
01:51:45,578 --> 01:51:49,708
Okay. If they come again don't
say you've...

1297
01:51:49,782 --> 01:51:51,875
...spoken to me.

1298
01:51:53,386 --> 01:51:56,378
Pretend you don't know anything.

1299
01:51:56,422 --> 01:51:57,480
Okay.

1300
01:51:57,757 --> 01:52:01,887
Listen. One more bad news.

1301
01:52:02,962 --> 01:52:05,829
Sohag is in the hospital again.

1302
01:52:07,533 --> 01:52:11,560
She's so young! This disease!

1303
01:52:15,241 --> 01:52:18,677
Amal, please be careful!

1304
01:52:33,526 --> 01:52:34,550
What happened?

1305
01:52:36,395 --> 01:52:37,794
Is it Sohag?

1306
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:43,334
Wish I could send some money to Kolkata.

1307
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:48,502
Are you crazy? Money to Kolkata!

1308
01:52:48,574 --> 01:52:50,667
Let things settle down first.

1309
01:52:50,743 --> 01:52:52,267
Yes... you!

1310
01:52:57,383 --> 01:52:58,213
Yes... you!

1311
01:52:58,284 --> 01:52:59,376
Show me your I Card.

1312
01:52:59,452 --> 01:53:01,181
Officer! We're here for two hours.

1313
01:53:01,253 --> 01:53:02,481
Go ask the manager.

1314
01:53:05,825 --> 01:53:07,349
Where's your passport?

1315
01:53:07,426 --> 01:53:09,690
We've not been to the race course!

1316
01:53:11,297 --> 01:53:12,491
Let's go.

1317
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:20,568
- How much?
- Rs. Forty.

1318
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,234
Thank you.

1319
01:53:29,248 --> 01:53:30,875
How long have you been
working here?

1320
01:53:31,417 --> 01:53:32,611
Sir, 10 years...

1321
01:53:32,685 --> 01:53:34,448
How many foreigners are here?

1322
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:37,683
- None Sir.
- Nigerians?

1323
01:53:37,757 --> 01:53:38,655
No sir.

1324
01:53:38,724 --> 01:53:40,316
No Nigerians have checked in...

1325
01:53:40,393 --> 01:53:42,361
- Sure.
- Yes Sir.

1326
01:53:43,295 --> 01:53:45,195
Did the race course have a CCTV?

1327
01:53:45,765 --> 01:53:46,891
I didn't notice.

1328
01:53:48,634 --> 01:53:50,602
Pune is very unsafe for us.

1329
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:54,296
Yes sir. Showed them the guest
entry book.

1330
01:53:54,673 --> 01:53:55,867
Excuse me.

1331
01:53:56,442 --> 01:53:58,410
They asked if any foreigners
checked in...

1332
01:53:58,477 --> 01:54:01,776
...asked about Nigerians.

1333
01:54:02,948 --> 01:54:05,280
Some problem at the race course.

1334
01:54:05,684 --> 01:54:08,915
Yes. I'll get back to you Sir.

1335
01:54:09,455 --> 01:54:11,446
Excuse me. We want to check out.

1336
01:54:11,524 --> 01:54:12,388
Any service problem?

1337
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:13,720
No. We've to leave.

1338
01:54:13,926 --> 01:54:15,621
Get the bill ready.

1339
01:54:35,414 --> 01:54:37,609
We can't keep the fake currency
with us.

1340
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:45,681
Driver, take us through the cliff roads.

1341
01:54:45,724 --> 01:54:46,748
Yes, Madam.

1342
01:55:32,171 --> 01:55:34,731
- Good morning Madam.
- Good morning.

1343
01:55:36,275 --> 01:55:37,435
Get up.

1344
01:55:51,323 --> 01:55:52,847
Amal, get ready.

1345
01:55:52,925 --> 01:55:54,483
We have to reach the consulate.

1346
01:55:54,693 --> 01:55:56,183
There'll be a long queue.

1347
01:55:56,362 --> 01:55:58,227
We can't stay in Mumbai.

1348
01:56:19,785 --> 01:56:20,809
What does it say?

1349
01:56:23,856 --> 01:56:25,721
These two are very smart...

1350
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:28,217
They used the fake notes at the
Pune race course.

1351
01:56:28,427 --> 01:56:31,396
Now the cops are after them.

1352
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:34,428
Catch them, no matter what.

1353
01:56:35,334 --> 01:56:36,528
Yes.

1354
01:56:37,803 --> 01:56:40,328
They must have escaped from there.

1355
01:56:40,673 --> 01:56:43,403
I'm sending you their snaps.

1356
01:56:43,642 --> 01:56:46,907
Find them. Inform everyone.

1357
01:56:47,179 --> 01:56:47,770
Okay.

1358
01:56:48,681 --> 01:56:51,616
Mr. Amal Kumar Biswas?

1359
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:52,674
Yes Madam.

1360
01:56:53,519 --> 01:56:54,713
Are you married?

1361
01:56:55,754 --> 01:56:56,516
No Madam.

1362
01:56:56,555 --> 01:56:59,251
Have you got any income tax file?

1363
01:57:01,493 --> 01:57:02,425
No.

1364
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:03,753
Any bank statements?

1365
01:57:03,829 --> 01:57:06,354
Bank? Sorry Madam.

1366
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,831
How was the interview?

1367
01:57:08,467 --> 01:57:09,559
Not good.

1368
01:57:10,269 --> 01:57:12,464
Couldn't answer most questions.

1369
01:57:13,939 --> 01:57:15,839
Don't worry.

1370
01:57:15,908 --> 01:57:17,637
Everything will be fine.

1371
01:57:18,277 --> 01:57:25,445
Buy these things from Andheri mall.

1372
01:57:26,552 --> 01:57:28,611
It will take another two hours here.

1373
01:57:28,687 --> 01:57:30,348
I'll use your authorisation letter...

1374
01:57:30,389 --> 01:57:32,289
...to collect your passport.

1375
01:57:32,691 --> 01:57:34,921
Then I'll buy tickets,
Exchange dollars...

1376
01:57:35,194 --> 01:57:36,286
...and then return to the hotel.

1377
01:57:36,362 --> 01:57:39,559
Or else we'll be late.

1378
01:57:40,332 --> 01:57:43,267
Besides, it's risky to be together.

1379
01:57:44,703 --> 01:57:46,762
See you at the hotel. Take care.

1380
01:57:46,972 --> 01:57:48,667
- Okay.
- Bye.

1381
01:58:04,923 --> 01:58:06,413
- Yes brother.
- Got it brother.

1382
01:58:06,492 --> 01:58:07,720
Don't worry!

1383
01:58:07,793 --> 01:58:09,590
Okay. I'm informing everyone.

1384
01:58:09,662 --> 01:58:10,594
Got it!

1385
01:58:30,516 --> 01:58:32,245
Yes brother, found him!

1386
01:58:33,552 --> 01:58:37,215
At Andheri Mall. He's alone.

1387
01:58:38,757 --> 01:58:40,952
Yes brother.

1388
01:58:51,437 --> 01:58:52,961
I'm keeping an
eye on him.

1389
01:59:03,315 --> 01:59:04,441
Yes. Come quickly.

1390
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:07,775
- Try this for both of us.
- Sure. Smells nice.

1391
01:59:25,437 --> 01:59:27,905
He was here. But can't see him now.

1392
01:59:28,941 --> 01:59:30,568
Looks like he escaped!

1393
01:59:34,847 --> 01:59:35,779
Yes.

1394
01:59:36,915 --> 01:59:39,713
What? Escaped?

1395
01:59:41,353 --> 01:59:44,186
Don't let him escape from the city!

1396
01:59:44,423 --> 01:59:46,220
You sent anyone to the airport?

1397
01:59:47,426 --> 01:59:49,394
Idiot!

1398
01:59:50,429 --> 01:59:53,421
Why only domestic and not international?

1399
01:59:53,632 --> 01:59:55,657
He has passport and money.

1400
01:59:56,201 --> 01:59:58,863
He may go to Singapore, Bangkok,
Dubai... anywhere!

1401
01:59:59,571 --> 02:00:03,234
If the cops catch him he'll talk
in a second!

1402
02:00:03,442 --> 02:00:06,206
What's the problem if he goes abroad?

1403
02:00:06,278 --> 02:00:09,736
The cops have put a red alert on him.

1404
02:00:10,449 --> 02:00:13,316
He can get caught anywhere!

1405
02:00:13,452 --> 02:00:15,750
If he gets caught we're done for!

1406
02:00:16,455 --> 02:00:20,949
Yes. No. Checking is not at 1 pm...

1407
02:00:21,293 --> 02:00:22,658
Room keys please... 201.

1408
02:00:23,462 --> 02:00:25,157
No, it's at 12 pm.

1409
02:00:25,397 --> 02:00:26,455
Okay.

1410
02:00:27,566 --> 02:00:30,330
Madam left five minutes back,
with her luggage.

1411
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,562
She's cleared the bills.

1412
02:00:31,637 --> 02:00:33,161
Your luggage is in the room.

1413
02:00:34,273 --> 02:00:35,240
Here.

1414
02:00:35,307 --> 02:00:36,797
- She left?
- Yes.

1415
02:00:42,281 --> 02:00:44,613
The number you are calling is
either switched off,

1416
02:00:44,683 --> 02:00:46,548
...or not reachable...

1417
02:00:54,827 --> 02:00:57,352
The number you are calling,

1418
02:00:57,429 --> 02:00:58,896
...is currently switched off.

1419
02:00:58,964 --> 02:01:00,864
Please try after sometime.

1420
02:01:21,954 --> 02:01:24,718
Amal, bad news!

1421
02:01:25,858 --> 02:01:27,621
You didn't get the visa.

1422
02:01:28,627 --> 02:01:31,619
But I can't stay in India anymore.

1423
02:01:32,664 --> 02:01:35,827
I've got a cheap night flight.

1424
02:01:37,269 --> 02:01:39,294
I'm not cheating you.

1425
02:01:40,839 --> 02:01:44,775
Your money and passport's in
your shirt pocket.

1426
02:01:47,246 --> 02:01:48,713
Please don't be angry.

1427
02:01:50,249 --> 02:01:52,240
Maybe it's for the best.

1428
02:01:53,685 --> 02:01:58,486
If nothing else, you need to
stay for Sohag.

1429
02:02:00,659 --> 02:02:02,593
My best wishes to you...

1430
02:02:03,695 --> 02:02:04,753
Rijula.

1431
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:06,588
Have a good life.

1432
02:02:06,665 --> 02:02:13,969
Seeking joy...
Unfamiliar with sorrow...

1433
02:02:15,641 --> 02:02:23,548
Life races by...
Relentlessly.

1434
02:02:34,793 --> 02:02:35,851
Thank you.

1435
02:02:44,336 --> 02:02:51,572
Listen to your heart...
Break the shackles.

1436
02:02:52,477 --> 02:02:53,569
Rijula.

1437
02:02:53,845 --> 02:03:02,253
Listen to your heart...
Forsake these ties.

1438
02:03:04,656 --> 02:03:12,563
Do you know
Which way to go?

1439
02:03:14,299 --> 02:03:21,637
Life races by...
Relentlessly.

1440
02:03:26,645 --> 02:03:27,669
Hello.

1441
02:03:27,879 --> 02:03:29,176
Yes.

1442
02:03:29,781 --> 02:03:31,146
Yes brother.

1443
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:32,840
I'm keeping an eye on him.

1444
02:03:33,218 --> 02:03:34,412
Come quickly!

1445
02:03:42,294 --> 02:03:43,591
I don't know where you are.

1446
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:47,230
Your phone is unavailable...

1447
02:03:48,767 --> 02:03:51,201
Yet, I'm letting you know...

1448
02:03:52,604 --> 02:03:56,233
Sohag is in coma since last night.

1449
02:03:57,409 --> 02:03:59,377
Don't know if she'll come out of it.

1450
02:04:01,246 --> 02:04:04,841
She wanted to see you once.

1451
02:07:10,268 --> 02:07:12,600
Hey idiot! Are you blind?

1452
02:08:04,889 --> 02:08:05,856
Move.

1453
02:08:08,793 --> 02:08:10,283
Where is it
What are you doing?

1454
02:08:12,297 --> 02:08:13,764
Idiotic! Who is it?

1455
02:08:14,566 --> 02:08:18,366
Robin. It's Amal. Goons are
chasing me!

1456
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:20,738
They'll kill me! Please help me.

1457
02:08:21,006 --> 02:08:24,203
Where are you?

1458
02:08:24,509 --> 02:08:25,601
Andheri Link Road.

1459
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:27,275
Can you see the crossing there?

1460
02:08:27,545 --> 02:08:31,413
Take that lane. Go right.

1461
02:08:31,783 --> 02:08:33,375
Go straight.

1462
02:08:33,918 --> 02:08:38,582
Hello! Damn!

1463
02:08:39,357 --> 02:08:40,324
Hello Robin!

1464
02:08:40,392 --> 02:08:43,452
Wait. Hold on.
Don't hang up.

1465
02:08:49,467 --> 02:08:54,370
Hello Javed Bhai. It's Robin.

1466
02:08:54,606 --> 02:08:57,666
You have to help my brother at any cost.

1467
02:08:57,876 --> 02:08:59,275
Give him a pistol.

1468
02:08:59,678 --> 02:09:00,940
I'll tell him right now.

1469
02:09:01,346 --> 02:09:02,813
Can you see the hair saloon?

1470
02:09:02,881 --> 02:09:06,339
- Yes.
- Knock there.

1471
02:09:06,651 --> 02:09:09,518
Javed Bhai will help you.

1472
02:09:18,797 --> 02:09:19,627
Robin.

1473
02:09:19,698 --> 02:09:20,722
Come in...

1474
02:09:30,342 --> 02:09:33,573
Italian. Fully loaded.

1475
02:09:34,579 --> 02:09:35,546
Take it.

1476
02:09:37,716 --> 02:09:38,683
Put it in your back pocket.

1477
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:42,445
Take the right from here...

1478
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,819
Then left. Go straight.
You'll find the station.

1479
02:09:46,257 --> 02:09:47,554
Come on. Hurry up.

1480
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,334
Listen.

1481
02:09:59,604 --> 02:10:00,696
What do I do now?

1482
02:10:00,905 --> 02:10:03,271
Take the station road... Use the
footbridge.

1483
02:10:04,309 --> 02:10:07,574
Come straight to me. Kandivli.

1484
02:10:07,812 --> 02:10:09,643
I'll wait with my bike.

1485
02:10:09,814 --> 02:10:11,577
Be careful brother!

1486
02:15:44,916 --> 02:15:46,281
Hello.

1487
02:15:49,921 --> 02:15:51,183
Hello.

1488
02:15:59,597 --> 02:16:00,825
Amal?

1489
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,794
Amal?

1490
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:16,608
What happened? Say something.

1491
02:16:22,386 --> 02:16:25,753
Come back son...
Come home.

1492
02:16:26,657 --> 02:16:27,817
You've been through enough.
