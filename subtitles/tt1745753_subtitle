1
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,258
Move.

2
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:10,997
Today is the first day of
your Professional life.

3
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,568
First day.. that is
a memorable day.

4
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:23,210
New office, new situations and a
new life all together. lsn't it?

5
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:28,854
But Soni, you must fall
in love with your work.

6
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,818
By the way, which institution
are you from?

7
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:35,554
Jamunalal Bajaj.

8
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:36,458
Good!

9
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,859
But tell me something..

10
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:43,196
Why Financial Sector? There
are other sectors as well..

11
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,704
Actually l think .. finance
regulates every thing.

12
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:46,700
So..

13
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,939
But you know, working in the
banking sector is not very easy.

14
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,878
You always have to
chase your target.

15
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,944
There is cut throat competition.

16
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,418
And group politics will hinder
your performance.

17
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,821
You know what l suggest..

18
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,661
..keep your emotions aside
and work ruthlessly.

19
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,261
Then only you can succeed.

20
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:20,595
Yes sir.. l will be
there in a minute.

21
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:24,143
Ok Soni, don't worry, l am
there with you. -Sure Mam!

22
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,974
But, don't ever mix your personal
life and professional life.

23
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,104
Thank You!

24
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:35,919
Friends!

25
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,914
As you all know that despite
economic slowdown..

26
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,851
The lnvestment in Microfinance
sector is still robust.

27
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,865
But banks are facing
liquidity crisis..

28
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,834
l think, this is not
the right time.

29
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,634
But.. Sir, lf investment
is stopped..

30
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:58,543
l think the situation will bring
people back to poverty again.

31
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,741
Specially those hundred
of thousands of women..

32
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,177
..who largely depend on it.

33
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,077
Which means we have to stop
giving loans to NGO..

34
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,416
..or increase the
rate of interest.

35
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:13,426
But smaller outfit NGO can't
pay higher rate of interest.

36
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,990
And if we stop giving
loan to them..

37
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,493
..we might lose them
to our competitors.

38
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,857
Sir, if our bank could
overcome this doubt..

39
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:25,000
..and continue to give small
margin loans to NGOs..

40
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,172
..there'll be less
default in loan.

41
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,100
And as per our partnership model
this can be controlled.

42
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:31,973
Right.

43
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,708
Last month, SK Microfinance
lnstitution..

44
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,875
..added 4,00,000 new customers.

45
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,919
And their Loan recovery
status is 99.5 % ..

46
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,525
..much higher than any
conventional banking system.

47
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:47,925
So l think..

48
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,758
..actually this is a good time
to raise lending to MFl'S.

49
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,494
That's lmpressive..

50
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,658
..we should move it.

51
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,839
Meet our clients and thoroughly
check the papers.

52
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,276
Don't forget our target as per our
calculations on the partnership model.

53
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,278
And Tanvi, we must deliver..

54
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,815
..the bank has very high
expectations from us.

55
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:14,984
Sure Sir, Don't worry !

56
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,587
l'm not worried, l know
that you are there.

57
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,649
One more thing..

58
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,691
..you know that l'm going
abroad tonight.

59
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,293
l want you to attend RBl
governor's seminar.

60
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,655
lt's very important.
-Surely, sir.

61
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,089
Bye. -Bye.

62
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:36,166
Tanvi! My flight had been
cancelled due to fog.

63
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,438
Anurag is arranging tickets..

64
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,978
We may get confirmed tickets
in night flight.

65
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:46,051
Tell me, your plans
for tomorrow?

66
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:50,313
lt is difficult to tell Nikhil.
You know how we work..

67
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,886
Leave is impossible!

68
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:55,221
Ok, lets hope for
the best, bye !

69
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,461
Nikhil, lets leave.

70
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,478
Got the tickets?

71
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:21,981
Missing your wife! lt's a
matter of two days only.

72
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,056
Unlike you..

73
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,249
..we are not married for
a very long time.

74
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,252
l don't think you
remember that..

75
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:32,124
..lt is our wedding anniversary
tomorrow.

76
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,792
How long have you been
married? -Three years!

77
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,831
How three years slipped by!!

78
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:41,738
Nikhil!

79
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,402
l tell you one thing?

80
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:45,836
l think you should
go for a baby.

81
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,938
You know, kids are such bliss..

82
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:54,680
After coming from office
in the evening.

83
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,779
When l spend time with Shreya..

84
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,784

stressed anymore.

85
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,492
And l Think lt's high
time for you guys..

86
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,725
Complications may arise,
if you delay.

87
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,234
We are planning..

88
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,497

89
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:16,938

Happy anniversary!

Many happy returns of the day!

103
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,798
Where is Nikhil?

104
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,392
He must be up and about by now.

105
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,828
He came late night from Delhi.

106
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,271
Wait let me see..

107
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:31,866

108
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,906
Ok Dad, l'll tell him to

Same to you, Love.

112
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,563
l am leaving for office.

113
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,897
Shall l set the alarm or

114
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,570
Don't worry, l'll wake

115
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:03,768
Yes. -Ok.

116
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:06,872
l'll See you at dinner.

117
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,649
Why lndian Banking
System survived..

118
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,516
..the Global Banking
Crisis is because..

119
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,288
We had a very limited Exposure..

120
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,121
..to sub-prime mortgage assets..

121
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,925
But the same cannot be said..

122
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,464
..about lndian Economy..

123
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,329
..because we are much
more integrated..

124
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,605
..into the world economy today
than ten years ago..

125
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,205
You can call it a bitter fruit
of Globalization ..

126
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:46,880
Now the banking community
has to ensure..

127
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,585
..a healthy flow of credit..

128
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:53,186
..to the productive sectors
of the economy.

129
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,519
So, on that note..

130
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:57,060
l wish you all the best
ladies & gentlemen.

131
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,230
Motto of Every Company, in
every sector is to grow.

132
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,370
l mean same with your
Banking sector.

133
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:10,274
Today, is the consumer
expectation are really grown high.

134
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,237
They grown really high.

135
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,774
ln a competitive climate
like that..

136
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,373
lt's very important to
return the consumer.

137
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,245
As a fear of loosing the
consumers is always there.

138
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,084
And the costs must be kept down.

139
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:25,183
Ok.

140
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,720
But what's the solution?

141
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:31,255
Our BPO Company has helped
financial service clients like Banks..

142
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,861
Credit Card lssuers, to
meet these challenges.

143
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,734
Have look at the consumer
profile.

144
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,092
Excuse me!

145
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,668
David!

146
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,674
This seems interesting.

147
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,982
Sir, how much do you
think can we save?

148
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,948
About 30%-40% of your costs.
-Good Evening Maam !

149
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,720
No, l'm waiting for someone.

150
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,116
So, l guess, you are right!

151
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,223
So, then lets go ahead
with it, Ok.

152
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:04,559
Goodnight!

153
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,619
Goodnight!

154
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,331
l'm so sorry sweetheart!

155
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:14,571
lt's ok.

156
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,838
Tanvi!

157
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:21,444
What's happening to our life?

158
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,078
lt's our third wedding
anniversary..

159
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,452
..and we are not celebrating.

160
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:33,782
As if happiness is gradually..

161
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,492
..slipping out of our hands.

162
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,100
Why! We still have the evening..

163
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:45,536
..let's make the most of it.

164
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,204
You are Right, Let's go.

165
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:26,309
Life is insipid, without
the salt of your love.

166
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:38,384
Life is insipid, without
the salt of your love.

167
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:42,225
lt is difficult to..

168
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:55,170
lt is difficult to
live without you..

169
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,447
Lanes are deserted..

170
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:15,227
Lanes are deserted, without
glimpses of your face.

171
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,829
lt is difficult to..

172
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:31,806
'lt is difficult to
live without you.

173
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:20,387
Dreams in eyes, longing
at heart..

174
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,528
..meeting you brings
world of happiness.

175
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:37,242
You are in my eyes, in
my heart, in my world.

176
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:44,876
Without you nights are dark..
You are my moonlight.

177
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,144
Moonlight fades..

178
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:56,959
Moonlight fades if your shining
eyes are not there.'

179
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:09,403
lt is difficult to

Tanvi! Frankly speaking.

339
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:53,664
You made some plans
for our bank.

340
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,759
ln your absence bank will
employ another..

341
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,964
Asst. Vice President, for
executing your plans.

342
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,367
And who knows..

343
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:06,505
..that executive might be more
efficient than you are

344
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:11,771
Look, You get promotions as
long as you are performing.

345
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,252
You've every right
to raise a family.

346
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,616
l'm afraid; your desire..

347
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,182
..may ruin your promising
career.

348
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,058

349
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,289

the implications..

350
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:32,564
..of having a baby and being the
vice president of the bank.

351
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:34,996
You deserve both..

352
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:40,074
..but both cannot be achieved
at the same time, right!

353
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,020
My dear girl..

354
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:58,425

l know that..

358
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,600
l can either give them
time or money.

359
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,377
That's the way it is.

360
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,642
Anyway.. for you,
sky is the limit.

361
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:22,249
Whether you want to fly
high or creep along.

362
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,654
lt's up to you to determine.

363
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:32,456
Actually, we are all
over-burdened with our ambition.

364
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:34,788
That's why your boss said..

365
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,735
..either you become a mother
or make a brilliant career.

366
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:44,437
Had you been in my place-what
would you've done?

367
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,645
l would prefer to become
a mother. Any time.

368
00:32:57,155 --> 00:33:02,286
Don't you think that if
our career is good..

369
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:08,828
..we can give our children
better opportunities?

370
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:14,497
This so-called rat race for
better opportunities is never-ending.

371
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:19,199
But my boss is not wrong.

372
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:23,638
Till now, my career
graph has gone up..

373
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:27,181
..and pregnancy can
be postponed.

374
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,882
This is 21st century my friend.

375
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:35,784
lf you are not willing no body
can impose anything on you..

376
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:37,788
..not even motherhood.

377
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,025
But remember..

378
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:50,139
..this baby is as much Nikhil's
as it is yours.

379
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:53,274
So don't do anything
without telling him.

380
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,916
One second, Hello.

381
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:02,715
Doctor Nilima, Tanvi here..

382
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:04,885
lt's good that you called.

383
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,221
Your reports are here.

384
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,254
You could suffer from
threatened Abortion.

385
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:12,287
Your B.P. is very high too.

386
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,231
l'm really sorry girl..

387
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,594
..you need to take
complete bed-rest.

388
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,830
Hello, Hello, Tanvi?

389
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,598
Are you listening..

390
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,573
..can you hear me, Tanvi?

391
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,058
lndia has a huge pool
of companies.

392
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,063
Why do you think, we
should choose you?

393
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,562
Two reasons. Number One:

394
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,595
Our long experience of service
to lndian banks.

395
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:55,798
Our experts will help you to understand
the mentality of lndian consumers.

396
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:59,904
Number Two: High quality
services, at competitive prices.

397
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,452
The deal is done. -Thank You.

398
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,788
You know that Project.
Excuse me.

399
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:27,102
Hi! l am in a meeting right now.
l'll talk to you later.

400
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,736
Listen! -Don't wait for me.
l won't be back tonight.

401
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:32,033
Please Listen.

402
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:02,134
Mam !

403
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:12,180
lt's Ok.

404
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:18,179
For a few days. Set your
problems aside.

405
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,994
You are on the 12th week now.

406
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:27,096
Worst come worst, it should
be six to seven months..

407
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:29,792
lf you keep up the same
pace of work..

408
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,432
..you can expect another
very big jump soon.

409
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:34,569
May be just another year.

410
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:41,675
This baby is as much Nikhil's
as it is yours.

411
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:45,108
So don't do anything
without telling him.

412
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,193
Hey Tanvi! You know what..

413
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,032
..my presentation has
been accepted.

414
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,962
Let's go out for dinner.
Lets enjoy.

415
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:47,139
No. Go ahead,

416
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,478
..but l am not in the mood.

417
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,648
Not in the mood! Why?

418
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,918
What happened? Are you sick?

419
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,284
What happened?

420
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,861
Come on, speak up. Tanvi!

421
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,970
l am asking you. Come
on speak up.

422
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,336
So you think one needs to reply
when somebody asks something.

423
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:28,977
lt's very simple.

424
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,188
Simple!

425
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,157
l look sick because..

426
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:40,996
Because..

427
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,223
Because..

428
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:45,868
Today..

429
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,105
l got the baby aborted.

430
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:58,276
What?

431
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,050
What have you done?

432
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,514
Abortion.

433
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,587
But why? Why?

434
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,892
You don't even need to ask me?!

435
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:14,728
That night, l tried my
best to talk to you..

436
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,595
..but you had no time.

437
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,963
Could not you wait for me? -No!

438
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:22,396
l could not. l too had no time.

439
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:25,801
Why Tanvi? How could you!

440
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:27,676
How could l what!

441
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,007
How could you do this to me?

442
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,915
lt was not only your baby.

443
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,385
You are my wife. God damn it!

444
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,787
You still remember that
l am your wife!

445
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:46,090
l was undone..

446
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:51,599
l don't know what your
compulsion was.

447
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:55,498
But your heart..

448
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,945
Let's not talk about heart.

449
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:06,579
My compulsion---is my career.

450
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,216
Such a compromise for
career? Oh damn it.

451
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,352
What have you done, Tanvi?

452
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:22,290
One moment you make me dream
and in another shatter them.

453
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:25,257
You woman!

454
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:48,187
l feel something is lacking..

455
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:54,561
l feel something is lacking..

456
00:40:55,166 --> 00:41:00,570
l feel something is lacking..

457
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:07,674
l feel something is lacking..

458
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,819
Faces brighten, eyes smile..

459
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:24,693
Faces brighten, eyes smile..

460
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:29,356
..yet tears remain..

461
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:35,338
l feel something is lacking..

462
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,145
l feel something is lacking..

463
00:42:05,937 --> 00:42:10,397
A man should never dream!

464
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:16,336
Dreams are as fragile as glass.

465
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:26,416
Break very easily.

466
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:32,552
Brace yourself. Life is
full of ups and downs.

467
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:43,399
She is crazy about her
career you know.

468
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:46,867
She aborted the baby..

469
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,274
She did not even bother
to ask me.

470
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:55,478
Why?

471
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:00,523
l have already told my dad.

472
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:06,419
What do l do now?

473
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,266
What do l say to him now?

474
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:15,528
..that for my wife..

475
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:19,536
..career is more important
than a baby.

476
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:34,515
Just think, if it goes like
this, we can never become parents!

477
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:42,732
Don't lose heart!

478
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:45,064
There must be a way out.

479
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:55,205
Of course there is ! The way
to my doom, lead by my wife!

480
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:04,118
No way, no exit!

481
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,892
What happened?

482
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:13,357
After such a long time, God had
given you happiness.. and you..

483
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:18,028
l knew it, you will blame me.

484
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:21,933
But..

485
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,706
Tell me what would you do..

486
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,802
..if you have to give up
something that you cherish?

487
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:34,247
With my long hard work..

488
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,217
..l could bring my career
to this position..

489
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:41,285
..and now if have a baby.

490
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,854
Career, Career, Career!

491
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,385
You are a woman..

492
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:50,224
..and a woman's first priority
should always be family.

493
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:54,265
You mean.. a woman will have
to compromise always.

494
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,471
You don't call it a compromise.

495
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,111
There are so many women who
cannot have a baby..

496
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:09,049
And look at you.. Shame on you..

497
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,078
l could not even think of it.

498
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:14,281
You can tell me anything ma....

499
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:20,194
Could you hear what your
dear daughter said?

500
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:21,926
Shanti please..

501
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:24,557
Now. lt's useless to talk now.
Nothing will change..

502
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:29,531
Means.. you are supporting her.

503
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,069
You pretty well know that
she is wrong yet.

504
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,337
What else do l do?

505
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:41,709
Nowadays children want to live
their life in their own way.

506
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,584
Their thinking, planning
is different from ours.

507
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:47,923
At least you can
understand this.

508
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:54,191
Tanvi! You'll see that
your career will..

509
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:57,393
..never allow you to
become a mother.

510
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:20,556
Moments of happiness Pass by..

511
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:33,137
Eyes shed tears emotionally.

512
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,773
Dreams melt with them..

513
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:45,774
Like dust on a mirror..

514
00:46:49,153 --> 00:47:00,394
Like dust on a mirror sorrows
remain in the heart..

515
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:06,259
l feel something is lacking..

516
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:12,803
l feel something is lacking..

517
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:33,162
Nights pass morning's
dawn with new hope..

518
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:52,216
Waves of hope dwell
in the heart.

519
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:58,888
Mind reaches out and
touches the sky

520
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:08,158
Mind reaches out and
touches the sky

521
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:13,235
But the earth remains.

522
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:19,066
l feel something is lacking..

523
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:25,511
l feel something is lacking..

524
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:08,647
Dear Nikhil.. l tried to call
you several times today,

525
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:11,157
..to sort out my dilemma.

526
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:16,161
Between my career and & the
baby, What do l choose Nikhil.

527
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:19,602
l think, at this stage
if l go for the baby.

528
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:22,738
..there will be a break
in my career.

529
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:25,232
Tell me Nikhil, what do l do?

530
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,905
lf we decide to go
for abortion..

531
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:30,846
Doctor says, it must
be tomorrow.

532
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:34,910
She did write to me.

533
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,920
l did not reply her mail..

534
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,323
But couldn't she wait..

535
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,255
..go for an abortion without
my knowledge.

536
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:27,629
What will you do now? Leave her!

537
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,001
And you think that
you love her!!

538
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:34,872
Don't try to justify her
wrong doings, please!

539
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,248
l am not trying to justify..

540
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:43,581
But you see, just because
she is a woman..

541
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,554
..you can't impose your
wishes on her.

542
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,427
Cool down. At this juncture..

543
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:55,527
..be very patient to keep
the relationship..

544
00:50:57,101 --> 00:51:01,697
..or else you can't think
of having a family.

545
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,972
But.. -Look..

546
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:11,804
Take your time. Step into
her shoes Nikhil..

547
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,314
..then only you can understand.

548
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:21,810
l'm Sorry!

549
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:37,663
You know guys! lt's great
to be ambitious.

550
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:41,899
But to compromise even the
smallest of happiness for it..

551
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,001
l don't think it's right.

552
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:48,335
lf this goes on, you two can
never become parents.

553
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:50,277
Why do you say so?

554
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:56,449
Let me be the vice president,
then you will see..

555
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:58,983
Nikhil say something.

556
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,556
Don't you ever think that..

557
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,491
..there will be no end to this?

558
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,831
And mind you, time
waits for none.

559
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:17,033
ln that case, we'll
have to accept..

560
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:20,336
..that we can never have
a baby of our own.

561
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:24,805
Tanvi, can we do without a baby?

562
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,179
l mean, if you think that you
can, then its ok by me.

563
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:32,114
Hey Nikhil, don't
get so emotional.

564
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,687
This is not the end
of the world.

565
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,621
There are ways.

566
00:53:38,228 --> 00:53:41,561
lf you wish you can
adopt a baby.

567
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:46,134
By doing so, you will do
a favour to the country.

568
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,033
Nikhil's parents will
never accept.

569
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:59,171
They are so old fashioned
and we too..

570
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:02,149
There has to be a way out.

571
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:08,915
l've an idea.

572
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:14,720
l mean if you so wish..

573
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,936
Why don't you go for
a surrogate mother?

574
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:28,973
What?

575
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,705
This is a current and
burning issue.

576
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,816
Those who are incapable,
go for it

577
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:41,246
And guys like you, who want to
have the cake and eat it too;

578
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,550
This is the only
way out for you.

579
00:54:57,234 --> 00:54:58,929
ln the past one year..

580
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:02,329
..our clinic has very successfully
carried out our commitment..

581
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:05,105
..towards providing
surrogate mothers..

582
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,335
..to women who cannot bear
their own children..

583
00:55:10,214 --> 00:55:13,274
..and in this regard, l would
like to thank my staff..

584
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:16,581
..and these surrogate mothers..

585
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:21,518
Without whom we could have
never achieved our goal.

586
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:28,030
My secretary Mr. Srivastav has
details of successful cases..

587
00:55:28,832 --> 00:55:31,300
..which can be collected
from him.

588
00:55:32,336 --> 00:55:34,270
Now may l request Mr. Smith..

589
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:37,201
..to share his experience with
all of you present her

590
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:39,000
Mr. Smith..

591
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,269
Thanks doctor.

592
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:44,342
Actually we lost all hopes
of having our own child.

593
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:46,808
These doctors have made
our dream come true.

594
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,118
lf anything you have to..

595
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:53,284
Yes, we would like to thank Dr.Patel
and his clinic for all this.

596
00:55:53,657 --> 00:55:55,022
Thank you. -Thank you.

597
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,120
Now Ladies & Gentlemen, if you
would like to ask questions.

598
00:56:01,498 --> 00:56:03,898
Dr. Patel, what is
the success rate?

599
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:10,974
You see, lf the lady is 30 and
below 30, then its about 40-60% .

600
00:56:11,709 --> 00:56:16,112
Dr.Patel, lt's said that to
avoid problems of pregnancy..

601
00:56:16,513 --> 00:56:18,413
People have started hiring
surrogate mothers.

602
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:20,180
What do you say about it?

603
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:22,476
l've not heard anything
like this.

604
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:26,147
Do you agree that in the name of
serving incapable mothers..

605
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:28,787
..you have started making
a profitable business?

606
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:33,355
See we don't really have time to
think what people think about us.

607
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:36,356
So, Ladies & gentleman,
thank you very much.

608
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:38,862
This is enough for the day.
Thank you so much.

609
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:39,194
So after lnformation Technology,
Business Process Outsourcing..

610
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,232
..lndia is not only making its
dent in Medical Tourism..

611
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:45,868
..but also becoming a
hot destination for..

612
00:57:45,936 --> 00:57:50,236
Cheaply and efficiently providing
the services of Surrogate Mothers.

613
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:52,404
There are a lot of
women abroad..

614
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:57,171
..who would like to use services
of surrogate mothers..

615
00:57:57,414 --> 00:58:00,941
..to be able to pursue their
own career goals.

616
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:02,482
Daily ad's come with
requests like..

617
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:06,487
..needed womb on hire, adequate
compensation will be given

618
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,455
But it would be wrong
to say that..

619
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:10,720
..it is purely done on the
basis of Social service..

620
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:13,594
..rather it is a pure
business deal..

621
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:39,115
What are you thinking?

622
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,828
What do you suggest?

623
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,519
Surrogacy?

624
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,489
Seems to be a good option!

625
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:07,379
Sheela, giving a baby
for Mr. smith..

626
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,545
..you not only helped him
you helped yourself.

627
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:17,327
According to me, you will
get one lakh rupees.

628
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:22,657
But sir, you said..
2 lakhs rupees.

629
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:29,035
Oh yes, l have said.
But you see,

630
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:35,544
l had to pay for medicine,
food and accommodation..

631
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:39,738
l'll not spend it
from my pocket.

632
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:41,945
You can see the bills.

633
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,621
But sir, you have not said
all these before..

634
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:49,151
Send them in.

635
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:53,153
..and Dr. Patel was
telling that..

636
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:57,430
..you do this as Social
Service.

637
00:59:57,835 --> 01:00:00,633
Social Service.. oh yes.

638
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:06,467
There is an old proverb..

639
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,304
No service can be done in
empty stomach.. got me?

640
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:16,117
Ok next time l'll give
you more, happy?

641
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:38,001
Tanvi, for the first time, in the
office, l was thinking about us.

642
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,540
l think we should accept
Nikki's suggestion.

643
01:00:57,094 --> 01:00:58,083
What solution?

644
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:01,854
You don't have time, will the
baby fall on your lap from heaven?

645
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:04,666
lt's very simple.

646
01:01:05,068 --> 01:01:08,128
Our baby will grow in
some one else's womb.

647
01:01:11,808 --> 01:01:15,266
l mean, she'll just
bear our baby.

648
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:23,715
You can understand
ma.. it happens.

649
01:01:23,954 --> 01:01:26,923
Enough Tanvi! You have
lost your mind.

650
01:01:27,457 --> 01:01:29,152
You are not talking sense.

651
01:01:29,426 --> 01:01:31,917
Your child will grow in
another woman's womb!

652
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:33,619
Mom! You are not listening..

653
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,862
We are just hiring a womb
for our baby, that's it.

654
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:38,397
What!

655
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:42,005
But Nikhil, it's not as
easy as you think..

656
01:01:43,307 --> 01:01:47,141
..there will be lot of medical,
legal, social aspects.

657
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:54,179
And Tanvi, what will people say?

658
01:01:54,518 --> 01:01:56,452
Your neighbors, colleagues?

659
01:01:57,421 --> 01:02:00,618
You will have a baby.. without
any physical change?

660
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:05,893
l will tell them that..

661
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:11,058
l am incapable. -Tanvi!

662
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:17,906
Yes, we have decided.

663
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:24,506
Please mom, please dad..

664
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:32,120
..if you don't help
us, where do we go?

665
01:02:44,434 --> 01:02:46,299
Sir, they are here..
Please come...

666
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:48,736
Come in. Come Mr.Singh!

667
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:51,002
Good morning doctor!
-Good morning !

668
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,572
Please be seated. -Thank you.

669
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:56,677
Dr.Goenka had told me
about your daughter.

670
01:02:57,314 --> 01:02:58,008
Yes.

671
01:02:58,248 --> 01:02:59,476
We will definitely help..

672
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:02,416
..but l don't understand..

673
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:08,422
..why do you want the surrogate
mother to stay with you?

674
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:14,087
Doctor, we don't want the
whole world to know it.

675
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,824
You know doctor, Social stigma..

676
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:19,765
l hope you understand that!

677
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:21,370
Yes, l do understand.

678
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:25,768
But you also have to understand,
this is not common practice.

679
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,775
Just because you are insisting.

680
01:03:31,214 --> 01:03:32,340
l will try my best.

681
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:34,147
Mr. Srivastav! -Yes.

682
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,216
Mr. Srivastav will get
in touch with you.

683
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,552
..l will take care.

684
01:03:39,723 --> 01:03:42,351
We'll take your leave doctor.
-Ok, thank you!

685
01:03:42,392 --> 01:03:43,689
Thank you so much, doctor.

686
01:03:44,194 --> 01:03:45,183
Thank you.

687
01:03:53,136 --> 01:03:54,330
Srivastav. -Yes.

688
01:03:55,238 --> 01:03:55,966
Sir..

689
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:58,165
Do we have a candidate
for Mr. Singh?

690
01:03:58,675 --> 01:03:59,972
No, Not now..

691
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:02,638
But you don't worry.

692
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,938
l'll call our agent
in the village..

693
01:04:05,148 --> 01:04:06,843
Call him right now and let
me know what he says.

694
01:04:06,983 --> 01:04:08,814
..he will do something.

695
01:04:10,454 --> 01:04:12,820
Call him right now and let
me know what he says.

696
01:04:13,256 --> 01:04:14,416
Ok sir.

697
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:57,795
Stop..

698
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,571
Hello.. sorry, sorry,

699
01:05:07,944 --> 01:05:11,812
Actually we are enjoying music
after a day's work, yes tell me.

700
01:05:11,882 --> 01:05:16,251
Shukhlaji, how are you?

701
01:05:16,553 --> 01:05:18,680
l'm at your mercy.
-That's true.

702
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:21,623
But there is an urgent
task for you.

703
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,355
Please tell Sir.
-l need a woman immediately.

704
01:05:25,896 --> 01:05:28,729
lmmediately! lt's difficult..

705
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,090
..but it will cost
extra.. you know.

706
01:05:33,637 --> 01:05:35,468
Why extra charge?

707
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:41,507
As government takes extra charges
on 'lnstant ticket' reservation.

708
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:42,976
Understand?

709
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,243
Ok, done, then quickly arrange for
a woman and get your commission.

710
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:51,243
lf l get my commission
then rest assured.

711
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:53,413
OK.. Good afternoon.

712
01:05:56,393 --> 01:06:00,489
Sarala, Kamala, Vimala, Leela
all are in town now.

713
01:06:01,464 --> 01:06:04,695
How can l find one immediately!

714
01:06:04,968 --> 01:06:06,697
Can't produce immediately,

715
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:10,071
..but l have find one,
it makes me rich.

716
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:13,838
Don't stare, hold this.

717
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:35,425
Good Morning Pareshji!

718
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:37,099
Yes.

719
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:58,552
Oh! Back to square one.

720
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,251
Who will be of some use?

721
01:07:10,934 --> 01:07:14,199
Have to select one.

722
01:07:15,038 --> 01:07:17,404
Cant see her face.

723
01:07:21,478 --> 01:07:24,936
Sheela lives with them
and understands them.

724
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:33,017
Who's it?

725
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:36,186
Namaskar! -Namaskar!

726
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:39,291
What's going on? -Thinking.

727
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,422
What!

728
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:46,929
The villager's will face problems
if there is less rainfall..

729
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:49,901
..we have to save well water..

730
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:53,709
Any solution?

731
01:07:54,644 --> 01:07:55,508
From Where?

732
01:07:55,745 --> 01:07:57,007
From brain! -Whose?

733
01:07:58,214 --> 01:08:01,012
Obviously not mine!

734
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:03,484
Not yet.

735
01:08:04,854 --> 01:08:09,018
But water level in the well
is going down and down.

736
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:16,057
While going deep down
in search of water..

737
01:08:16,232 --> 01:08:18,962
..a man's intention
too become lowly.

738
01:08:19,135 --> 01:08:19,965
How!

739
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,271
Ok, l am leaving.
A lot of work to do.

740
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,309
Gouri!

741
01:08:34,818 --> 01:08:38,310
ls Mohan at home?

742
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:01,168
Mohan!

743
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:07,477
Mohan! Where are you hiding?

744
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:09,376
Ram Ram (greetings) Pareshj.

745
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:15,547
Don't flatter me. Tell
me, Am l your enemy?

746
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,626
What are you telling?

747
01:09:18,061 --> 01:09:22,395
Then, tell me when, you are
giving my money back?

748
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:27,899
Please, give me some
time Pareshji.

749
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,066
As soon as my materials
sold out..

750
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,007
l will definitely pay you back.

751
01:09:32,275 --> 01:09:35,142
Well, when is that D' day?

752
01:09:35,378 --> 01:09:36,402
Please sit down.

753
01:09:36,446 --> 01:09:39,711
Look, my daughter's in laws have
already reached half way.

754
01:09:41,684 --> 01:09:42,548
Raghu, water.

755
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:45,086
Hang your water! l'm
totally confused.

756
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:48,023
Only a month is left for
my daughter's marriage.

757
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:49,522
Please repay me.

758
01:09:50,527 --> 01:09:55,965
l'm sick and tired of asking.
Please repay me.

759
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:00,365
Rest, be assured Pareshji.

760
01:10:02,138 --> 01:10:04,470
l promise to give
your money back..

761
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:06,735
..well before your daughter's
marriage.

762
01:10:06,976 --> 01:10:08,068
Otherwise..

763
01:10:08,778 --> 01:10:09,836
l mean it.

764
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:11,379
Alright.

765
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:16,977
Gouri, you are the witness..

766
01:10:21,624 --> 01:10:22,522
Listen..

767
01:10:23,026 --> 01:10:27,895
..if not, l will set your
belongings for auction.

768
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,234
Children are weeping in hunger.

769
01:10:42,912 --> 01:10:44,709
There's not even a single
grain in the house..

770
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:48,042
..and this man is
smoking a beedi.

771
01:10:48,818 --> 01:10:49,876
Listen!

772
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:58,082
lf you just sit here, children
will have to starve.

773
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:02,687
You think that l am
not concerned?

774
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,200
Then.. feed them..

775
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:14,441
..or kill them.

776
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:16,469
Have you gone mad!

777
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:25,617
l don't even have money to buy
raw material. Shall l steal?

778
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:29,717
l don't know. After all, you
are head of the family.

779
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:31,760
lt is your responsibility
to feed us.

780
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:37,723
Leave this ancestral business
and setup a new one.

781
01:11:38,268 --> 01:11:41,897
What! You ask me to kick
my ancestral business?

782
01:11:42,338 --> 01:11:44,431
l won't spare you!
-Don't touch me!

783
01:11:44,507 --> 01:11:46,236
You dare to abuse my
forefather's business!!

784
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:47,400
Leave me alone!!

785
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:48,876
You abuse my forefathers.

786
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:59,147
l won't spare you. l kill you.

787
01:12:00,156 --> 01:12:01,521
Leave her!! Have you gone mad?

788
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:02,522
You leave me..

789
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:07,161
..today l shall kill her.

790
01:12:07,363 --> 01:12:09,729
Kill me, its better to die!!

791
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:18,071
Are you not ashamed to
fight like animals?

792
01:12:19,309 --> 01:12:20,799
What will the children think?

793
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:23,305
She doesn't understand.

794
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:26,610
'no work, no money',

795
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,345
She doesn't understand.

796
01:12:28,952 --> 01:12:30,214
..abuses children..

797
01:13:20,703 --> 01:13:21,863
What are you thinking?

798
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:37,883
l think our ancestral business
is no more sufficient to feed us.

799
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:44,356
You know, all the villagers
are suffering.

800
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:48,292
Gagan's family is starving...

801
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:51,790
..fighting like animals.

802
01:13:55,638 --> 01:14:02,339
Hunger, greed forces people to
do anything and everything.

803
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:09,649
Who knows what will happen
to us tomorrow?

804
01:14:11,254 --> 01:14:12,585
Think positive!

805
01:14:13,656 --> 01:14:16,819
God is gracious.

806
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:24,158
You have finished making
the idol for Thakur.

807
01:14:25,368 --> 01:14:27,632
Give it to him and
get some money.

808
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:33,403
Yes, that's the only way out.

809
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,111
Anything else? Sweet dish?

810
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:41,675
No, l'm so full.

811
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:44,483
How about an lce Cream?

812
01:14:45,421 --> 01:14:46,979
Just don't pamper me, Ok..

813
01:14:48,024 --> 01:14:49,389
l am not pregnant.

814
01:14:59,135 --> 01:15:01,501
l forgot to tell you,
Papa rang me up

815
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,507
What did he say?

816
01:15:05,908 --> 01:15:07,808
He said that he had a
talk with doctor..

817
01:15:08,344 --> 01:15:11,279
Surrogate mother will be available,
but will take some time.

818
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:23,421
Nikhil, think again.

819
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:30,557
Have we taken the
right decision?

820
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:32,561
Why do you think so?

821
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:34,870
We have already decided!!

822
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:40,968
Yes.

823
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:44,747
Press hard!!

824
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:52,682
How is the idol?

825
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:58,258
Will it decorate my bedroom?

826
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:02,557
Check it for yourself, my lord!

827
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:10,366
lf l like it, l will reward you.

828
01:16:11,407 --> 01:16:12,237
Show me.

829
01:16:12,675 --> 01:16:16,008
Just a minute. Raghu..
just a minute...

830
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:56,648
You scoundrel, what's this?

831
01:16:57,653 --> 01:17:01,316
Covering a female figure,
you call it art ?

832
01:17:03,459 --> 01:17:06,326
Naked figure makes you ashamed?

833
01:17:07,096 --> 01:17:09,587
Scoundrel, you consider
yourself an artist?

834
01:17:16,272 --> 01:17:18,832
Look, this is art.

835
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:22,740
lf you can make something like
this, bring it to me..

836
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:25,504
..or else get lost.

837
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:29,677
Don't look down. Look
here. Hold it.

838
01:17:30,786 --> 01:17:31,548
Scoundrel!

839
01:19:43,886 --> 01:19:52,089
Lord, Let flowers bloom.
Let the trees have fruits.

840
01:19:55,531 --> 01:20:02,528
Lord, Let flowers bloom. Let
the trees have fruits.

841
01:20:03,205 --> 01:20:11,169
Let the earth get as much
rain as she needs.

842
01:20:26,395 --> 01:20:34,632
lt is a very difficult time
, World is full of sinners.

843
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:45,607
lt is a very difficult time
, World is full of sinners.

844
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:54,052
Let the poor have some wealth.
Let the weak have strength.

845
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:13,001
Let cattle have a
bundle of grass.

846
01:21:13,109 --> 01:21:17,409
Let people have their
daily bread.

847
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:24,680
Let cattle have a
bundle of grass.

848
01:21:24,787 --> 01:21:28,018
Let people have their
daily bread.

849
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:32,325
Let the fields have
bumper crops.

850
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:36,591
Let people plough
their own fields

851
01:21:51,747 --> 01:21:59,654
All hands are stained.
All eyes are greedy.

852
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:10,695
All hands are stained.
All eyes are greedy.

853
01:22:11,233 --> 01:22:19,538
Cover the female body with a
cloth. Let her face have a veil.

854
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,420
l don't want to impose
my views..

855
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:39,884
..but you think again.

856
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:45,633
Are you sure of getting the
happiness you are longing for?

857
01:23:02,384 --> 01:23:05,581
Whose bangles? Gauri's?

858
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,354
You say that l sell these and
get my daughter married..

859
01:23:16,432 --> 01:23:17,160
Yes.

860
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:21,594
What do you think of
me? Am l so cheap?

861
01:23:22,771 --> 01:23:24,966
..that l sell these and get
my daughter married..

862
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:31,210
Had it not been my daughter's
marriage, l wouldn't have asked.

863
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:36,482
l feel for you.

864
01:23:38,454 --> 01:23:41,719
Take these back, you idiot.

865
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:43,855
So we are back to square one.

866
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,397
Please don't get me wrong.

867
01:23:57,773 --> 01:24:00,139
No one cares for art any more.

868
01:24:01,377 --> 01:24:06,371
l can't make cheap vulgar
commodities that are easily sold out.

869
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,315
l feel helpless.

870
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:14,683
Mohan! Don't worry.

871
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:17,422
Have patience.

872
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,350
Everything will be right.

873
01:24:21,664 --> 01:24:23,859
We had always been patient and
see where we stand today.

874
01:24:24,366 --> 01:24:30,635
l have learnt that money is
everything in this world.

875
01:24:33,509 --> 01:24:34,771
You don't worry.

876
01:24:37,446 --> 01:24:39,880
We will find a way out.

877
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:46,517
l have decided..

878
01:24:55,965 --> 01:25:04,634
..not to do the same work
that my forefathers did.

879
01:25:08,777 --> 01:25:14,682
While working with mud, l have
thrown myself into mud.

880
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:24,156
l promise not to make
earthenware after today.

881
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:36,867
l will find out something
else or..

882
01:25:38,407 --> 01:25:42,901
..leave this world
with my family.

883
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,744
Mohan, talk to Shukla once.

884
01:25:55,357 --> 01:25:57,086
He is an influential man and..

885
01:25:57,326 --> 01:25:59,157
..is well connected with
important men in town.

886
01:25:59,695 --> 01:26:04,257
He'd sent Sheela to town
and she earned a lot.

887
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:16,038
He may be of some help and you
could get rid of this Pareshlal.

888
01:26:39,868 --> 01:26:43,463
When l was sweet sixteen.

889
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:47,837
All city boys were eyeing me.

890
01:26:47,943 --> 01:26:53,176
Then came a miracle.

891
01:26:55,584 --> 01:26:58,747
Then came a miracle,

892
01:27:03,358 --> 01:27:06,987

01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:26,375
My beloved, l became
betel of Benaras.

896
01:27:49,538 --> 01:27:53,770
My look became arrow of cupid.

897

Friends become crazy
on my beauty.'

898
01:28:01,216 --> 01:28:05,084
My look became arrow of cupid.

899
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:16,197
They fell in love instantly my
youth drowned them in desire.

901

God! l became betel
of Benaras.

01:28:28,544 --> 01:28:35,882
God! l became betel
of Benaras.

Yes Mohan, what do you want?

905
01:29:12,321 --> 01:29:13,310

But for woman only.

What? My wife?

915
01:29:56,698 --> 01:29:57,392

916
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,297
What kind of job is this?

917
01:30:00,802 --> 01:30:03,703
Satua, Satua..

918
01:30:04,873 --> 01:30:06,306
Satua.. -Yes master..

Don't worry..

924
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:37,300
Shukla! What did you say?

925
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,535
You'd do if urgently?
l'm waiting.

926
01:30:44,046 --> 01:30:48,107
Srivastavji, rest assured,
your work is done.

927
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:51,980
Done! Send her then,
why waste time?

928
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:14,898
Hey Shuklaji! What's up?

01:31:15,644 --> 01:31:17,976
You tell me to do this?

930
01:31:18,513 --> 01:31:19,775
Why what's the matter?

931
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:25,583
You think my wife will bear
someone else's child?

932
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:28,389
Hey Satua! What did you
tell him? -Stop!

933
01:31:31,326 --> 01:31:35,353
l came to seek your
help not to beg.

934
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,927
l didn't come here for my wife.

935
01:31:42,404 --> 01:31:47,205
What of two lakhs, l won't sell
my wife even for fifty lakhs.

936
01:32:00,622 --> 01:32:04,388
l showed him the path to live..

937
01:32:05,727 --> 01:32:07,217
..in return he shows
his muscles .

938
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,324
Satua..!

939
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:14,129
Play some good music.

940
01:32:26,882 --> 01:32:28,372
lf it goes on like this..

941
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:33,279
..everything will be finished
with in a week.

942
01:32:36,024 --> 01:32:38,652
Children too will have
to go hungry.

943
01:32:42,864 --> 01:32:44,593
Why don't you meet Shukla.

944
01:32:45,033 --> 01:32:49,299
Sheela says that he is well
connected in the city.

945
01:32:50,472 --> 01:32:52,940
Don't mention him, he
is a scoundrel..

946
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:58,342
..says that only women
can do the work...

947
01:33:03,051 --> 01:33:08,887
To bear someone else's
child and deliver it.

948
01:33:11,793 --> 01:33:12,885
What do you mean!

949
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:17,360
The way cows, buffaloes,
animals have babies.

950
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:19,631
Human beings too can have
a child like that..

951
01:33:25,774 --> 01:33:27,401
How much will they
pay? -Two lakhs..

952
01:33:37,586 --> 01:33:38,814
What are you thinking?

953
01:33:45,227 --> 01:33:53,430
Helping an incapable woman
is not wrong after all!

954
01:34:27,802 --> 01:34:29,133
Congratulation! -Thank you!

955
01:34:29,437 --> 01:34:31,234
The Artificial insemination
has been done.

956
01:34:32,707 --> 01:34:33,765
Thank you so much.

957
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,570
So, there is no need to worry.

958
01:34:36,411 --> 01:34:38,311
Tanvi! You just have
to be extra careful.

959
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,814
l will take care of
her. Don't worry.

960
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,547
All the best! -Thank you!

961
01:34:56,464 --> 01:34:57,362
Come in.

962
01:35:43,378 --> 01:35:46,313
Why aren't you drinking milk?

963
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:51,044
After this, you have
to take medication.

964
01:35:52,487 --> 01:35:54,682
l have two children, this
is my third time..

965
01:35:54,889 --> 01:35:57,790
..and the are very
healthy & cuddly.

966
01:35:58,226 --> 01:36:00,660
lt will be the same this time.

967
01:36:01,429 --> 01:36:02,657
Come on, have the milk.

968
01:36:03,498 --> 01:36:04,931
You won't listen..

969
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:54,639
What happened?

970
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:57,385
Nothing just a bit..

971
01:36:58,687 --> 01:36:59,483
Tell me.

972
01:37:00,655 --> 01:37:01,679
Feeling sick.

973
01:37:04,826 --> 01:37:05,485
Come.

974
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:07,457
Nothing.

975
01:37:20,175 --> 01:37:22,871
Oh God, so much water.

976
01:37:27,449 --> 01:37:28,575
Didi..

977
01:37:30,085 --> 01:37:31,177
Come here.

978
01:37:31,786 --> 01:37:34,380
Go ahead, l am alright here.

979
01:37:35,256 --> 01:37:36,382
lt's tickling me,

980
01:37:36,624 --> 01:37:40,458
You know, the river in our
village seems so small now.

981
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,262
Didi, look there!

982
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:48,764
What!

983
01:37:53,475 --> 01:37:55,067
What is that?

984
01:38:02,684 --> 01:38:03,810
Look Sippi.

985
01:38:04,419 --> 01:38:08,378
What! Sippi.. you mean shell!

986
01:38:10,892 --> 01:38:12,519
lt has pearl inside.

987
01:38:13,528 --> 01:38:15,689
Just like my baby in my womb,
since last three months.

988
01:38:17,232 --> 01:38:20,395
How easily you can
compare Gauri!

989
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:22,399
l could not even think of it.

990
01:38:25,306 --> 01:38:26,398
There's another one.

991
01:38:27,842 --> 01:38:29,173
What did Gauri say?

992
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,481
Gauri! -Yes. -What did you say?

993
01:38:38,186 --> 01:38:41,246
Just like my baby is in my womb,
since last three months.

994
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,962
My baby!!

995
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,332
l have something to tell you.

996
01:39:26,501 --> 01:39:27,468
Yes.

997
01:39:27,769 --> 01:39:29,396
l think you won't mind. -No..

998
01:39:32,307 --> 01:39:35,003
Next time. Please don't
bring our son with you.

999
01:39:36,244 --> 01:39:36,903
Why?

1000
01:39:37,245 --> 01:39:38,769
He is no more a child..

1001
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:41,939
lf he smells something and
tells others at home.

1002
01:39:42,817 --> 01:39:44,808
Oh my god!

1003
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:52,751
l should have thought
of it earlier..

1004
01:39:53,428 --> 01:39:56,761
..ok, next time l
will come alone..

1005
01:39:57,532 --> 01:39:59,397
..and take you back home.

1006
01:40:00,568 --> 01:40:03,401
l can't come for sometime now.

1007
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:04,497
Why?

1008
01:40:05,974 --> 01:40:08,135
Choudhury saab himself
had come..

1009
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,941
..and requested me
to make an idol.

1010
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:14,139
lt was great..

1011
01:40:16,751 --> 01:40:19,914
..had l got this before..

1012
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:24,415
..you need not have
taken so much pain!

1013
01:40:24,926 --> 01:40:26,018
Forget the past.

1014
01:40:45,246 --> 01:40:46,304
Who are you dear!

1015
01:40:47,448 --> 01:40:48,676
With whom have you come?

1016
01:40:50,084 --> 01:40:53,144
Come on my son, have something.

1017
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:57,589
Whose child is he?

1018
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:00,827
Gauri's.. come on son..

1019
01:41:03,665 --> 01:41:05,929
..have some juice.

1020
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:14,567
Gauri's baby!

1021
01:41:16,644 --> 01:41:17,906
That's our baby!

1022
01:41:22,383 --> 01:41:23,372
You know what!

1023
01:41:24,585 --> 01:41:28,612
Everything has changed
because of this baby.

1024
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:32,923
We are the same..

1025
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:43,235
..same work pressure yet
everyday brings new happiness.

1026
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:47,972
So lovely!

1027
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:52,238
Gauri do you like this Saree!

1028
01:41:52,613 --> 01:41:54,205
They are very expensive.

1029
01:41:54,515 --> 01:41:56,574
ln our village people don't
use such costly clothes.

1030
01:41:57,418 --> 01:42:00,251
Tanvi is giving you,
please take it.

1031
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,720
Nobody ever gave such things
to my children.

1032
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:07,461
So sweet of you!

1033
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,022
May god bless you!

1034
01:42:11,332 --> 01:42:14,824
God has already blessed
me by sending you.

1035
01:42:17,138 --> 01:42:20,699
You purchased for everybody
but forgot my baby.

1036
01:42:25,446 --> 01:42:27,539
l didn't get you.

1037
01:42:28,716 --> 01:42:30,308
Have sense Tanvi,

1038
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:35,387
She means your baby.

1039
01:42:43,398 --> 01:42:46,299
See ! you've heard for yourself.

1040
01:42:48,169 --> 01:42:50,000
She always talks like this.

1041
01:42:55,576 --> 01:42:57,305
l am getting scared you know..

1042
01:42:58,379 --> 01:43:02,076
lf she becomes unwilling to
hand me over my child!

1043
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:05,645
Don't be impossible Tanvi.

1044
01:43:06,954 --> 01:43:08,854
Try to understand, where
she is coming from.

1045
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:12,658
She just casually says all
these, she doesn't really mean it.

1046
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:17,330
l don't know, l can't
stand this.

1047
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:21,597
l get real scared.
l feel angry too..

1048
01:43:21,803 --> 01:43:24,101
Cool baby. Cool..
Have patience.

1049
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:26,470
Every thing is going
to be fine, ok.

1050
01:43:29,777 --> 01:43:33,804
Ok, but l don't know,
sometimes..

1051
01:43:35,383 --> 01:43:38,682
..something happens. l just..

1052
01:43:48,362 --> 01:43:49,226
Listen..

1053
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:53,993
l want to tell you something?
-Go ahead

1054
01:43:58,372 --> 01:44:03,639
Gauri is so good..

1055
01:44:07,081 --> 01:44:13,213
..but l don't like something
about her.

1056
01:44:14,622 --> 01:44:15,384
What?

1057
01:44:24,398 --> 01:44:30,268
She mentions our
baby as her own.

1058
01:44:31,572 --> 01:44:35,440
Oh my god! Some one is really
getting jealous!

1059
01:44:36,844 --> 01:44:38,505
Don't take it like this.

1060
01:44:39,113 --> 01:44:41,843
She is bearing so much
discomfort for us.

1061
01:44:43,117 --> 01:44:45,483
Let her tell what she wants.
You don't take it to heart.

1062
01:44:48,556 --> 01:44:51,821
Yes, you are right..!

1063
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,258
Anyway, let us go to sleep.

1064
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:59,629
We've to go to the office
tomorrow. Ok, good night.

1065
01:45:08,676 --> 01:45:13,978
Cradle rocks, baby
girl rocks in it.

1066
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:19,142
Flying saucer should not
fly away, rock softly.

1067
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,583
Flying saucer should not
fly away, rock softly.

1068
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:29,888
On her small toes, the
baby doll walks.

1069
01:45:30,164 --> 01:45:35,158
With tiny wings, swallows fly.

1070
01:45:35,469 --> 01:45:40,463
Careful, baby doll should
not get hurt.

1071
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:45,835
Cradle rocks, baby
girl rocks in it.

1072
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:51,174
Flying saucer should not
fly away, rock softly.

1073
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,937
Want to play?

1074
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:18,739
Oooh! You are kicking hard.

1075
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,649
l'll spank you. No dear,
we will play..

1076
01:46:24,318 --> 01:46:27,515
Hey you naughty.. -Gauri..
who are you talking to?

1077
01:46:31,559 --> 01:46:34,255
Come over, give me your hand..

1078
01:46:36,797 --> 01:46:37,855
..the baby moved.

1079
01:46:38,933 --> 01:46:41,401
What! Since when! Just now.

1080
01:46:46,574 --> 01:46:47,768
How does it feel Gauri?

1081
01:46:47,942 --> 01:46:52,641
Very good. lt seems, the baby
wants to talk to me.

1082
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,708
Can l speak?

1083
01:46:56,884 --> 01:46:59,375
Sure, lt's your baby.

1084
01:47:08,896 --> 01:47:09,828
Hai baby!

1085
01:47:12,433 --> 01:47:13,695
Talk to mummy.

1086
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:16,296
Hai baby!

1087
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:33,177
Nothing is heard.

1088
01:47:34,855 --> 01:47:37,346
l think, he has gone
back to sleep.

1089
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:40,826
Back to sleep..

1090
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:48,430
Never mind, As soon as he
wakes up. l'll call you.

1091
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:49,936
lsn't it baby?

1092
01:47:50,037 --> 01:47:53,268
Tell me when you get up, l'll
call Didi (elder sister).

1093
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:11,417
Whom l have not touched.
How can l feel her?

1094
01:48:14,795 --> 01:48:20,825
With whom l have not
shared my breath.

1095
01:48:21,135 --> 01:48:26,596
l don't know why l
feel like this.

1096
01:48:27,341 --> 01:48:33,473
But thinking this way.

1097
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:38,616
My breathing gets stilled.

1098
01:48:38,986 --> 01:48:44,618
l feel something is lacking.

1099
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:51,355
So terribly lacking!

1100
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:58,967
Faces brighten, eyes smile.

1101
01:48:59,306 --> 01:49:03,743
But tears remain.

1102
01:49:04,311 --> 01:49:10,079
l feel something is lacking.

1103
01:49:10,718 --> 01:49:16,554
l feel something is lacking.

1104
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:36,041
Didi! What are you thinking?

1105
01:49:36,811 --> 01:49:37,800
Nothing.

1106
01:49:46,687 --> 01:49:50,214
Gauri! Will you give me my baby?

1107
01:49:51,258 --> 01:49:52,555
What are you talking about?

1108
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,524
Will the baby call me Mother!

1109
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,263
Sure, it will call you mother.

1110
01:49:59,767 --> 01:50:02,759
Look wherever a seed
comes from..

1111
01:50:03,571 --> 01:50:06,369
..they grow into the
lap of mother earth.

1112
01:50:07,341 --> 01:50:10,401
Your baby will call you mother.

1113
01:50:10,778 --> 01:50:11,972
You are so innocent.

1114
01:50:14,748 --> 01:50:18,309
l understand your feelings.

1115
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:23,918
You are incapable,
so you are afraid.

1116
01:50:26,794 --> 01:50:30,025
This is not true.

1117
01:50:32,366 --> 01:50:36,393
We have not told the truth.

1118
01:50:37,238 --> 01:50:37,863
What?

1119
01:50:40,074 --> 01:50:40,631
Yes!

1120
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:46,275
l can be a mother,
l am not incapable.

1121
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:57,119
Then.. why did you call me?

1122
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:07,528
l am supposed to get
a promotion..

1123
01:51:08,636 --> 01:51:13,369
..name, fame money everything..

1124
01:51:18,012 --> 01:51:23,712
..that is why l could
not spare time.

1125
01:51:26,287 --> 01:51:32,089
Because of name, fame and money
you do not want to bear a child?

1126
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:44,237
You are getting stressed. lt
will be harmful for the baby.

1127
01:51:45,406 --> 01:51:46,168
Baby!

1128
01:51:48,509 --> 01:51:51,307
You don't have time to
take care of the baby.

1129
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,113
What kind of Mother are you?

1130
01:51:55,916 --> 01:51:58,680
Can't you spare your
womb to your child?

1131
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,420
ln future if the child comes to
know everything and asks you..

1132
01:52:03,424 --> 01:52:04,948
That l wanted name
fame and money,

1133
01:52:05,059 --> 01:52:07,857
So l hired a womb to rear
and deliver you.

1134
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:11,554
You were like a goddess to me.

1135
01:52:13,867 --> 01:52:15,198
But you.. broke my heart.

1136
01:52:23,844 --> 01:52:24,936
Listen..

1137
01:52:52,473 --> 01:52:59,106
Tanvi, till date, l have always
supported all you decisions.

1138
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:03,010
Only because, l wanted
you to be happy.

1139
01:53:41,855 --> 01:53:42,844
What happened!

1140
01:53:45,793 --> 01:53:48,023
Shanta bai, come quickly!

1141
01:53:54,968 --> 01:53:56,595
And now Ladies and Gentlemen!

1142
01:53:56,804 --> 01:53:59,568

the field of Micro finance.

..her Commitment and invaluable
contribution.

1146
01:54:27,367 --> 01:54:29,961
Don't worry Gauri. Have you
informed the doctor?

1147
01:54:30,137 --> 01:54:32,128
..to tackle situational
hazards..

1148
01:54:32,473 --> 01:54:35,567
..her cooperation with
colleagues and juniors.

1149
01:54:36,443 --> 01:54:41,005
She has reached this position,
in a span of only 7 years.

1150
01:54:41,682 --> 01:54:43,843
Sister, just be careful! Please.

1151
01:54:44,885 --> 01:54:46,978
Don't worry Gauri! Nothing
will happen.

1152
01:54:47,921 --> 01:54:49,081
Well done Tanvi!

1153
01:55:08,008 --> 01:55:11,671
Thank you friends, for
all your cooperation.

1154
01:55:13,113 --> 01:55:16,913
Thanks for encouraging me
at every step l took..

1155
01:55:17,951 --> 01:55:21,318
l'm very happy, l'm
very proud of this.

1156
01:55:22,723 --> 01:55:24,156
She's has been admitted to lCU.

1157
01:55:24,258 --> 01:55:25,190
lCU! Why?

1158
01:55:25,392 --> 01:55:26,757
lt seems to be serious.

1159
01:55:26,827 --> 01:55:27,725
Oh god!

1160
01:55:28,028 --> 01:55:29,928
What to do now? -Ring Tanvi.

1161
01:55:35,803 --> 01:55:41,935
HR department is informing, that
Ms.Tanvi Sharma has been promoted..

1162
01:55:42,676 --> 01:55:45,372
..she is now a Vice-president.

1163
01:55:48,415 --> 01:55:49,677
Congratulations.

1164
01:56:00,661 --> 01:56:01,821
What happened?

1165
01:56:02,129 --> 01:56:03,960
She is not responding.
-Try again.

1166
01:56:13,006 --> 01:56:15,338
Hello! Yes Nikhil tell.

1167
01:56:17,678 --> 01:56:18,337
What?

1168
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,847
Doctors are doing their
level best..

1169
01:57:01,688 --> 01:57:03,383
..but the case is very serious.

1170
01:57:05,459 --> 01:57:08,951
l don't think, they will be able
to save the baby and mother both.

1171
01:57:10,898 --> 01:57:13,628
What shall we say to Tanvi?

1172
01:57:14,601 --> 01:57:17,934
Oh god! We have never
harmed anyone..

1173
01:57:18,605 --> 01:57:20,630
..still god is doing
this to us, why?

1174
01:57:21,742 --> 01:57:23,642
You will not get anything
by blaming God.

1175
01:57:25,012 --> 01:57:26,377
What we need to think now is..

1176
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,380
There is nothing to think about.

1177
01:57:41,495 --> 01:57:48,025
How can we take away the mother
from her two children, for our baby.

1178
01:57:52,973 --> 01:57:54,907
For our own interest..

1179
01:57:58,578 --> 01:58:00,671
..our benefit and happiness..

1180
01:59:22,963 --> 01:59:24,089
How is the baby?

1181
01:59:25,732 --> 01:59:28,997
You know l have brought
this toy for him.

1182
01:59:30,504 --> 01:59:31,664
One minute.

1183
01:59:36,376 --> 01:59:39,470
Look, l made it myself.

1184
01:59:40,914 --> 01:59:42,381
What else can l give!

1185
01:59:43,383 --> 01:59:47,012
Let's go, see the baby and
give this as a gift.

1186
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:53,084
What happened?

1187
01:59:58,698 --> 02:00:00,757
We have lost the baby!

1188
02:00:25,392 --> 02:00:26,359
Didi..

1189
02:00:31,498 --> 02:00:32,658
l am leaving.

1190
02:00:56,289 --> 02:00:57,278
Take care.

1191
02:01:01,161 --> 02:01:02,059
You too.

1192
02:01:04,364 --> 02:01:05,262
Good bye.

1193
02:01:16,409 --> 02:01:18,502
l don't want to go away
with a heavy heart.

1194
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,775
Can l say something?

1195
02:01:27,921 --> 02:01:29,479
Forgive me please.

1196
02:01:34,494 --> 02:01:38,954
l couldn't give you the
happiness, for which l came here.

1197
02:01:42,235 --> 02:01:45,864
May be god wants it this way.

1198
02:01:48,108 --> 02:01:49,336
He wants..

1199
02:01:51,211 --> 02:01:56,410
..you to experience all the
beautiful feelings of Motherhood.

1200
02:01:58,785 --> 02:02:09,184
To feel the baby kicking in
the womb, talk to it..

1201
02:02:11,898 --> 02:02:14,526
..to feel its breath
within you..

1202
02:02:17,103 --> 02:02:20,197
..to nurture it with your
own flesh and blood..

1203
02:02:21,441 --> 02:02:23,306
..to hold it in your arms.

1204
02:02:26,413 --> 02:02:28,005
l am just a little nobody.

1205
02:02:29,683 --> 02:02:35,952
Bliss of Motherhood is much
precious than name, fame and money.

1206
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:44,324
Forgive me for everything..

1207
02:02:45,699 --> 02:02:46,927
Good bye.
