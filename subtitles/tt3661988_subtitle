Seeing the way Vinu did all this, he surely needed money

874
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Then, his ATM transaction details would give us a lead

875
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:21,490
But, its hard to get details of a card without the owner

876
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:21,500
Let me see in my way
But, its hard to get details of a card without the owner

Let me see in my way

878
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,490
But, you know what is interesting?

Vinu was in this City for the past one week

Vinu was in this City for the past one week

01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:41,500
He went that lab 6 times to test blood samples.

AB positive O positive

887
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:06,290
When all such normal groups were repeating, he came back with another sample    For testing samples for blood group identification

888
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:06,300
At last..

His own blood group

900
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:28,300
After that Vinu did not or could not go to that lab

901
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,300
Since it was on that night

902
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,300
he commited suicide

903
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,290

He was searching for a blood group same as his
I am sure

905
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,300
He was searching for a blood group same as his

906
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:52,300
But that search which lasted for 6 days, stopped at the general hospital mortuary, on the 7th day

907
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:04,000
The 7th day that the God rested after creation for 6 days

908
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,760

Sir, his friend was missing

He came to identify the body

And its not an imitation

997
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,850
In a death certificate, doctor's word need not be the last word

998
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,850
A re-post mortem can be expected

999
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,850
But, none of the words in that report is going to be changed

1000

Your ego might not come in line with this

1008
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,840
But you are mistaken

1016
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,840
I might be mistaken

1017
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:29,850
If I have anymore doubts in that
I might be mistaken

1018
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,840

You see the irony, don't you?
They are my heros

1030
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:58,970
You see the irony, don't you?

1031

But I play to win

1035
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,180

But Sir, afer 3 hours..

1039

The body we took is not needed further. You can take it

1040
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:51,210
I can't do that
The body we took is not needed further. You can take it

1041
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,200
I can't do that

1042
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:53,210
You should. No need to give back the money
I can't do that

1043
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:55,210
You should. No need to give back the money

1044
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,780
Mr. Shaan?

1045
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:01,780
I am Victor. North CI

1046
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,770
We need to talk.

1047
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:05,780
 Get in
We need to talk.

1048
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,780

Shaan

1050
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:20,430
I spent lots of time to know about the rest of your story  
Shaan

1051
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:26,420
I spent lots of time to know about the rest of your story  

1052
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:26,430
But, now I need your version of that story 
I spent lots of time to know about the rest of your story  

1053
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:30,420
But, now I need your version of that story 

1054
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,430
For that I needed to meet you.  
But, now I need your version of that story

For that I needed to meet you.  

1056
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:36,430
I hope you understand
For that I needed to meet you.  

1057
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:38,430
I hope you understand

1058
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:50,430
I have a feeling that you would tell me the truth, may be because you're really scared  

1059
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:56,420
In that sense, I like you Shaan 

1060
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:56,430
Vinu's death.
In that sense, I like you Shaan 

1061
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,420
Vinu's death.

1062
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:58,430
Thats what is haunting the both of us 
Vinu's death.

1063
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:02,430
Thats what is haunting the both of us 

1064
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:14,420
You should say the story from where you stopped and till the Christmas night when I met you    

1065
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:14,430
You should say
You should say the story from where you stopped and till the Christmas night when I met you    

1066
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,430
You should say

1067
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:30,190
Sir, I will tell.

1068
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:30,200
I will tell you whatever you want to hear
Sir, I will tell.

1069
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
I will tell you whatever you want to hear

1070
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:36,200
But I need your help

1071
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,200
I can't take it anymore

1072
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:52,200
That night after the we parted, I didn't think where Vinu could be and who could come behind me    

1073
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:56,190
I wasn't in a mood to think about anything

1074
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:56,200
I was so isolated from everything
I wasn't in a mood to think about anything

1075
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,190
I was so isolated from everything

1076
01:28:58,190 --> 01:28:58,200
I was so isolated from everything

1077
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,190


1078
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:00,200
Next day, somehow I reached that lodge in Kuttalam 

1079
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Next day, somehow I reached that lodge in Kuttalam 

1080
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:08,190
No one were there

1081
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:08,200
I called to their homes and Green Meadow Orphanage from there  
No one were there

1082
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:14,200
I called to their homes and Green Meadow Orphanage from there  

1083
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:22,200
I understood that no one had contacted their families  

1084
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:30,200
After that, I tried them over phone many times 

1085
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,200
Their phone was switched off

1086
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,470
But

1087
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:41,480
On that Christmas night
But

1088
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,480
On that Christmas night

1089
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:01,290
Paracetamol

1090
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:01,300

Thanks

1093
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:16,100
Where were you till now?

1094
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,190
Where are the others?

1095
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,390
Tell me! Don't you understand what I am asking?

1096
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,400
I will tell Shaan
Tell me! Don't you understand what I am asking?

1097
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,400
I will tell Shaan

1098
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,780
Who is that?

1099
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:41,790
I will tell you. You just start the bike
Who is that?

1100
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,790
I will tell you. You just start the bike

1101
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:58,940
Where the hell are we going now!

1102
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,600
Where is Eby and Cycle?

1103
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:01,810
You just calm down Shaan
Where is Eby and Cycle?

1104
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:02,930
You just calm down Shaan

1105
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:03,610
I will tell you everything
You just calm down Shaan

1106
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:04,930
I will tell you everything

1107
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:04,940
All our problems are going to get solved
I will tell you everything

1108
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,940
All our problems are going to get solved

1109
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:34,790
Shaan, still so many questions are in front of us  

1110
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
But, your problem now is your own safety 
Shaan, still so many questions are in front of us  

1111
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,800
But, your problem now is your own safety 

1112
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,800
And I can provide you that

1113
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,960
Isn't he the Charlie you told about?

1114
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:07,880
Yes Sir

1115
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,090
Give me two days

1116
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:20,520
Within that time, all your problems will be solved 

1117
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,270
You can trust me Shaan

1118
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,990
Why did you bring him back here?

1119
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:42,120
He didn't tell anything new!

1120
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:44,570
Victor

1121
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:44,580
One of them
Victor

1122
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,570
One of them

1123
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:46,580
The one who knew about all the Vinu's plans 
One of them

1124
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:50,580
The one who knew about all the Vinu's plans 

1125
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,430
He is the reason for Vinu's death

1126
01:32:55,290 --> 01:33:00,300
After he died, he could have taken the body back to the Mortuary  

1127
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:08,190
Whoever that is, he was driving the ambulance that night  

1128
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:14,850
How can we say that he was one of them? 

1129
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:14,860
There are lot of other possibilies
How can we say that he was one of them? 

1130
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,860
There are lot of other possibilies

1131
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:22,450
If there is a 5th other than this 4 guys we know? 

1132
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,870
We can try analising this Victor

1133
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,660
Take Shaan Shehar

1134
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:28,670
Obviously he is not the one
Take Shaan Shehar

1135
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,670
Obviously he is not the one

1136
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:40,670
Because that night Shaan and Vinu were together in front of me   

1137
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:50,650
And that Van was behind my Jeep  

1138
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:59,650
So, Cycle Jessy and Eby are left  on the list

1139
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,990
Eby?

1140
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:03,000
As Sister Veronica told, Jessy and Eby started from Orphanage at 10 O clock   
Eby?

1141
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:10,990
As Sister Veronica told, Jessy and Eby started from Orphanage at 10 O clock   

1142
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:11,000
Vinu dies at 12 am that night 
As Sister Veronica told, Jessy and Eby started from Orphanage at 10 O clock   

1143
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,990
Vinu dies at 12 am that night 

1144
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:15,000
Ok.
Vinu dies at 12 am that night 

1145
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,990
Ok.

1146
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,000
But, the waterfalls where Vinu died could be reached in one and a half hours   
Ok.

1147
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,990
But, the waterfalls where Vinu died could be reached in one and a half hours   

1148
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,000
Surely, its possible to reach the falls within 12. 
But, the waterfalls where Vinu died could be reached in one and a half hours   

1149
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Surely, its possible to reach the falls within 12. 

1150
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,000
In that case could Eby the one took the body back to the hospital?

1151
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,000
True

1152
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:39,000
For Eby, its possible to reach Hill top waterfalls by 12. 

1153
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:44,990
He can also go to mortuary to return the body 

1154
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:45,000
But, the watchman at the mortuary told that the same guy who took the body came back to return it.  
He can also go to mortuary to return the body 

1155
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But, the watchman at the mortuary told that the same guy who took the body came back to return it.  

1156
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:56,990
And the body was returned at 10.30.  

1157
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:57,000
Its not possible for Eby to reach the hospital by then as he started from Orphanage by 10 only 
And the body was returned at 10.30.  

1158
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Its not possible for Eby to reach the hospital by then as he started from Orphanage by 10 only 

1159
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,520
Now lets move on to Jessy

1160
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:11,100
In this scenario, she has the least chances of commit this crime 

1161
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,860
As she has no motive

1162
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,570
She has nothing to gain from Vinu's death

1163
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:19,350
No

1164
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
We don't know if there is some motive.
No

1165
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,350
We don't know if there is some motive.

1166
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
If she has a motive which Shaan doesn't know?
We don't know if there is some motive.

1167
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,360
If she has a motive which Shaan doesn't know?

1168
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,500
Possible. But not probable

1169
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:30,380
Why?

1170
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:35,780
Jessy was there with Eby from the time started from the Orphanage 

1171
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:35,790
In between for Jessy to get an opportunity that Eby didn't get and that too with a motive we don't know yet

1173
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,260
The chances are too slim

1174
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:48,270
If Jessy is also ruled out?

The one who was in need of money now and then 

1180
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:11,580
Thats why he took that money from Vinu's Internet Cafe 

1181
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,130
And that has resulted in all whats happening

1182
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:19,620
First, he hid that even from his friends 

1183
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:19,630
It shows how desperate he is

No. Not at station. I will come there.

1192
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,010
May be coz I was in jail for 3 months for this

1193
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
With one look I understood

1194
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,010

01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,960
How much?

1205
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:44,970
Rs. 100
How much?

1206
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:46,970
Rs. 100

1207
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:23,960
Cyril Samuel?

1208
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,590
Where is your friends?

1209
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,060
Welcome Mr. Vinu Ramachandran

Welcome back from the dead

1211
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:27,070
Welcome back from the dead

1212
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:44,450
When the dead Vinu Ramachandran resurrects, 

1213
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:44,460
everyone will have many questions in bag for him

everyone will have many questions in bag for him  

1215
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,850
I know that you have found many lies to answer our questions during the journey here.  

1216
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,850
But you can save all that

1217
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:08,860
Because Police, Court , truth and justice are outside this court  
But you can save all that

Because Police, Court , truth and justice are outside this court  

1219
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:22,120
Here your story should satisfy just an individual, Shaan. 

1220
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:31,700
So like I said, you have no restrictions 

1221
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:31,710
You can start telling without any liabilities 
So like I said, you have no restrictions

You can start telling without any liabilities 

1223
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:45,550
Vinu?

1224
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:45,560
You can either tell those here 
Vinu?

1225
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:49,550
You can either tell those here 

1226
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:49,560
or we will all read that from a newspaper few days afterwards  
You can either tell those here

or we will all read that from a newspaper few days afterwards  

1228
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:03,070
But if I can bring you back from the dead in just 7 days,  

1229
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:03,080
You can imagine how far I would know about what you're going to say  
But if I can bring you back from the dead in just 7 days,

You can imagine how far I would know about what you're going to say  

1231
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:22,670
Still if you have the confidence to tell another lie 

1232
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:22,680
Go Ahead
Still if you have the confidence to tell another lie 

1233
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,670

1234
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:24,680
Take me on
Go Ahead

1235
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,680
Take me on

1236
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:33,230
After escaping from Charlie that day

1237
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:33,240
Somehow reached the lodge at Kuttalaam 
After escaping from Charlie that day

1238

Vinu

1240
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:11,110
Where is Shaan?
Vinu

1241
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:13,100
Where is Shaan?

1242
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:13,110
Eby, that Charlie is right behind us
Where is Shaan?

1243
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:15,110
Eby, that Charlie is right behind us

1244
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:19,150
I somehow escaped from them

1245
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:19,160
Then where is he!

I have no idea where Shaan is
Then where is he!

1248
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,160
I have no idea where Shaan is

1249
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,590
I told then itself

1250
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:45,600
This we won't be able to handle
I told then itself

1251
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,600
This we won't be able to handle

1252
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,320
If he gets into their hands again..

1253
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:08,000
Eby, what we will do now?

1254
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,000
They again came to my home..

1255
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:17,380
They just need us! Why the hell are they torturing our family! 

1256
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:22,340
Before tomorrow morning they will get to us, I'm sure 

1257
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:29,440
It was better to be dead!

1258
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,860
Cycle

1259
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:41,870
Charlie doesn't know that it was you who took the money
Cycle

1260
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:44,870
Charlie doesn't know that it was you who took the money

1261
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:51,330
Your problems could be solved if you keep low for sometime 

1262
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,920
But, Vinu

1263
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:03,510
From their eyes, money was lost from your shop 

1264
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:11,730
So, for Charlie its you who took the money 

1265
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:15,060
We don't have the money to return to them

1266
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:18,360
It in Crores

1267
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:24,240
They will come for you

1268
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,830
..till they get that money

1269
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:30,780
Otherwise 

1270
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:30,790
like cycle said, you should be dead 
Otherwise 

1271
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:34,790
like cycle said, you should be dead 

1272
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,130
If I die, will the problems end?

1273
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:45,430
Yes. It will

1274
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:57,730
To escape from all these we have only that way before us

1275
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,570
We are game

1276
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,520
Without any flaws

1277
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:03,530
Together!
Without any flaws

1278
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,530
Together!

1279
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:22,580
Normally, deadbodies which are not claimed by anyone are either used for academic purpose or cremated by the Government    

1280
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,970
Our chances lies there

1281
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,970
We should find a deadbody which is very much similar to you

1282
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,840
In your own blood group

1283
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:31,850
Then, post mortem is the only challenge
In your own blood group

1284

Then, post mortem is the only challenge

1285
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:43,970
A body if its cremated in your (Hindu) customs, there is no chances of re post mortem or identity check   

1286
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:43,980
Never
A body if its cremated in your (Hindu) customs, there is no chances of re post mortem or identity check

Never

1288
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,560
After death for 48 hours blood will not be clotted in different parts of the body 

1289
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:50,570
So, we can collect the blood then

So, we can collect the blood then

1291
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:02,540
Again, for group identification, dry blood from the body is enough 

1292
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:02,550
Most labs won't be able to identify if we add an anti coagulant in that

1299
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,190
Did you see? Its assistants who do the post mortem

1300
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:05,890
A doctor and few others

1301
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:05,900

We have catch them

1307
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:39,000
Knowingly we decided not to tell Shaan anything

1308
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,290
He won't agree

1309
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:46,000
We all knew that

1310
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:54,380
At last on that Christmas day, I found the body I required  

1311
01:48:56,590 --> 01:49:00,600
That day, I came to to my last night in this town 

1312
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,560
Eby, Cycle and me took the body now

1313
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:13,570

You come there fast

1317
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:26,580
Where the hell were you till now!

1318
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,160
Where are the others!

1319
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:29,170
I will tell Shaan
Where are the others!

1320
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:31,160

Da cycle, Shaan

1328
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:46,100
Don't be tensed. I will tell him

1329
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,980
You just follow us

1330
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:52,740
<i>I will tell you.</i>

1331
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:58,160
That day, we met first

1332
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:05,950
Shaan didn't know that Cycle was following us  

1333
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:13,630
Then it was the accident  

1334
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:18,290
Come we can go to hospital

1335
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:18,300
I told you there is no need!
Come we can go to hospital

From hospital I went to Cycle and we went to the hilltop  

1347
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:55,790

Ok

1353

1357

Eby. Where is he?

1358
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000

My question is how it happened to him
I know what happened to him

My question is how it happened to him

1361
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:37,560
I know you wouldn't pull a cliche here making it a mistake you did on the hilltop   

1362
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,940
So tell me

1363
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:44,950

You killed him
From your silence, a policeman could understand only one thing

You killed Eby, right?

1372
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,750
No. Vinu did nothing

1373
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:38,490
I will tell

1374
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:38,500
I will tell exactly what happened
I will tell

1375
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,500
I will tell exactly what happened

1376
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:10,320
Eby, I think I am getting cold feet 

1377
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,170
Vinu, you are a fool

1378
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:27,220
You only made evidences to prove that you committed suicide 

1379
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,920
Not only to make Christopher believe

1380
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:30,930
...but to make the world believe
Not only to make Christopher believe

1381
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:33,930
...but to make the world believe

1382
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:44,270
Tomorrow, your mother will identify any body she sees from here 

1383
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:53,780
Now from here, if you just slip from here, everyone will think of it as your suicide  

1384
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,400
Now anyone can kill you

1385
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:57,410
Even me.
Now anyone can kill you

1386
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,410
Even me.

1387
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:04,870
What are you telling Eby! 

1388
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:04,880
Jessy
What are you telling Eby! 

1389
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
Jessy

1390
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,800
We were together from our childhood days 

1391
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:20,810
Now, you guys made her my sister in your convenience
We were together from our childhood days 

1392
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:24,810
Now, you guys made her my sister in your convenience

1393
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:31,150
You should have understood

1394
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:31,160
Who she was to me
You should have understood

1395
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,150
Who she was to me

1396
01:55:33,150 --> 01:55:33,160
You should have understood
Who she was to me

1397
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:35,160
You should have understood

1398
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:41,420
I can't leave her just like that 

1399
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:49,920
If you die here, she don't have any option other than coming with me  

1400
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:56,350
If I wait a little longer, she will start to forget you 

1401
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:04,440
Then, he will be mine 

1402
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,860
I am sorry Vinu. 

1403
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:22,500
Cycle, Its been a long time since they left 

1404
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,250
They should have been back by now

1405
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:41,470
Vinu

1406
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:41,480
It was me who put that money in your Cafe and informed the Police  
Vinu

1407
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:47,480
It was me who put that money in your Cafe and informed the Police  

1408
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,520
But Cycle.

1409
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:53,530
He spoiled everything
But Cycle.

1410
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:55,520
He spoiled everything

1411
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:55,530
Else everything would have ended in that Police raid
He spoiled everything

1412
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:57,530
Else everything would have ended in that Police raid

1413
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:02,040
I shifted that money again from Cycle's factory

1414
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:09,540
But again you escaped from Charlie's hands and stood before my in that lodge  

1415
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:21,180
Then I prompted you to take a decision to die  

1416
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:26,440
My plan was not to help you out 

1417
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,650
It was made to kill you

1418
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:36,160
To kill you without any more mistakes

1419
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:56,930
<i>Jessy: Eby?</i>

1420
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:13,800
Why did you stop Eby

1421
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:18,050
Come. Come and kill me

1422
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:24,630
Didn't you tell that I was a fool?

1423
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:24,640
Ya. I am a fool 
Didn't you tell that I was a fool?

1424
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:28,640
Ya. I am a fool 

1425
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:30,640
All of us

1426
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,100
But I don't regret those

1427
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:36,110
Because I did that for us. All of us  
But I don't regret those

1428
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:42,110
Because I did that for us. All of us  

1429
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:48,370
But, you involved my mother and sister in all this! 

1430
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:51,750
How could you do all this?

1431
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:59,590
You were cheating us

1432
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:13,060
Vinu, Eby. Its just an issue between us right 

1433
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,780
We can forget all this

1434
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:21,270
Jessy. Leave it.

1435
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
Only we are here right
Jessy. Leave it.

1436
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,270
Only we are here right

1437
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
Leave it. Let it go
Only we are here right

1438
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,280
Leave it. Let it go

1439
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,830
Eby, Leave it

1440
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,290
No.

1441
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:42,630
Eby, you can't get away with this

1442
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:51,260
You did all this to kill Vinu right  

1443
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:55,060
That I can't forget, ever

1444
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:03,650
No. I don't need it 

1445
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:16,630
I never thought this would turn up like this 

1446
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:21,050
Vinu

1447
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:23,680
That money is in the Van

1448
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,970
I don't need that anymore

1449
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:38,430
Your problems became mine when that bag was put in your internet Cafe   

1450
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:42,780
I can't return the money now

1451
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:52,910
I cannot come back to you as your old Eby 

1452
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:00,050
Then why

1453
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:03,840
Why should I live

1454
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,970
I loved you very much Jessy. 

1455
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:17,190
I'm Sorry

1456
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:07,700
Eby!

1457
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:30,730
Eby's tormented body 

1458
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:30,740
Vinu's mother who identified it as her son's body  
Eby's tormented body 

1459
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:36,730
Vinu's mother who identified it as her son's body  

1460
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:36,740
That tattoo which Eby and Vinu shared 
Vinu's mother who identified it as her son's body  

1461
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:40,740
That tattoo which Eby and Vinu shared 

1462
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:44,700
Then identical blood group.

1463
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:44,710
Eby's death became Vinu's when all these came together 
Then identical blood group.

1464
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:48,710
Eby's death became Vinu's when all these came together 

1465
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:52,680
Even if most of it was coincidental, 

1466
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,890
It was in fact quite a brilliant plan

1467
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:11,190
But, still many questions are haunting you 

1468
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:23,620
From where Eby had this much money 

1469
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:27,620
Or should I say, counterfeit money

1470
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,960
Vinu

1471
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:38,970
Eby kept 1.75 Crores of fake currency in you Internet Cafe  
Vinu

1472
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:44,970
Eby kept 1.75 Crores of fake currency in you Internet Cafe  

1473
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,070
Grade-1 counterfeit currency

1474
02:05:57,820 --> 02:06:01,830
There was an Eby who you guys never knew 

1475
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:04,580
Eby you guys never understood

1476
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:10,170
Eby was one among hundreds of carriers Christopher Moriarty had 

1477
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:25,460
Eby used the money Christopher gave him to get rid of you   

1478
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:25,470
Its counterfeit money
Eby used the money Christopher gave him to get rid of you   

1479
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:27,460
Its counterfeit money

1480
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:27,470
If not used cautiously and got caught, it just won't affect him
Its counterfeit money

1481
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:33,010
If not used cautiously and got caught, it just won't affect him

1482
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:37,030
But the complete chain that works behind

1483
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:45,900
So, Christopher didn't look for Eby  

1484
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:45,910
He looked for the money
So, Christopher didn't look for Eby  

1485
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:47,910
He looked for the money

1486
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:52,300
The money that is there with you now

1487
02:06:59,630 --> 02:07:05,640
Knowingly or unknowingly because of Eby you became part of a big organized crime racket  

1488
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:10,690
But I believe that your role in that had ended with his death 

1489
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:24,150
I can just see you as few kids who did something when got really scared    

1490
02:07:33,370 --> 02:07:37,370
So, you can leave, leaving the money here 

1491
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:37,380
I can end all this my creating an FIR saying money was found in an unclaimed bag  
So, you can leave, leaving the money here 

1492
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:43,380
I can end all this my creating an FIR saying money was found in an unclaimed bag  

1493
02:07:46,170 --> 02:07:48,170
But make it fast before I change my mind

1494
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:48,180
Because the mercy that David Abraham is showing you may not be shown to you by Christopher or the Judiciary here   
But make it fast before I change my mind

1495
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:56,180
Because the mercy that David Abraham is showing you may not be shown to you by Christopher or the Judiciary here   

1496
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,020
Go on Vinu

1497
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:03,030
Leave the money. Take your friends
Go on Vinu

1498
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:05,020
Leave the money. Take your friends

1499
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:05,030
And go home!
Leave the money. Take your friends

1500
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:07,030
And go home!

1501
02:08:45,110 --> 02:08:47,110
See this as a final settlement

1502
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:47,120
Now, at this point, you should forget about this money  
See this as a final settlement

1503
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:53,110
Now, at this point, you should forget about this money  

1504
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:53,120
I give you my word
Now, at this point, you should forget about this money  

1505
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,110
I give you my word

1506
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:55,120
No will trouble you again for this 
I give you my word

1507
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:59,120
No will trouble you again for this 

1508
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:07,140
Good night

1509
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:15,230
Vinu

1510
02:09:41,290 --> 02:09:43,290
Da Shaan

1511
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:43,300
We thought of saying everything to you 
Da Shaan

1512
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:47,300
We thought of saying everything to you 

1513
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:49,140
But, Eby told not to

1514
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,310
Stop the Vehicle

1515
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:54,300
Da Shaan. Told you

1516
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:54,310
We never thought this will end up like this
Da Shaan. Told you

1517
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:56,310
We never thought this will end up like this

1518
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:59,270
Stop this vehicle!

1519
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,370
Whom did we give the money now!

1520
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:21,630
I asked whom did we give the money!

1521
02:10:22,910 --> 02:10:24,910
David Abraham Sir

1522
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:24,920
Who is this David Abraham
David Abraham Sir

1523
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,920
Who is this David Abraham

1524
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,930
What are you saying! You only made us meet with him 

1525
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,770
David Abraham IPS. Crime Branch

1526
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,440
We know him for just one night

1527
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:55,150
What surety we have whether he was David Abraham really?     

1528
02:11:09,210 --> 02:11:11,220
One Crore 75 lacs

1529
02:11:12,090 --> 02:11:14,090
Full amount is there

02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:14,100
